I could not beat the price, the check-in staff was friendly and quick, housekeeping was on top of their game and the PRICE!!!! The restaurants are not good though and the casino does nothing for me, no winning, no nice decor, no friendly faces throughout, but the rooms were ok. Ours was a standard I'm sure, but all you need a room for in Vegas is to sleep so to me the more important things are service, affordability and conveniance and this place had all three. I have stayed at the Venetian as well and there is NO COMPARISON, so if you have unlimited funds and you want to spend 450.00 a night on a suite go to the Venetian. If price is the number one factor, stay at LVH!!!",-PLRXBvkpTMO1T0SpIq_ZA,0,0,4,BqdRlKpk8d4XnEwBWM_l5A
18954,2011-05-23,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Let me be upfront and say that I am being a little harsh on the Las Vegas Hilton by giving it a rating of two stars - one that I feel should be reserved for the cheap motels that are located back away from the strip or down on Fremont Street.  But as a longtime Hilton Honors member (currently at a Silver membership level) I can't help but feel short changed and nickeled and dimed by this particular Hilton branch.  

For starters, the Hilton Honors program gives certain perks to members.  At other Hilton family hotels - even at the Hampton Inn - I usually have a complimentary water bottle and snack waiting for me in my room.  Internet is free by logging in with my Hilton Honors username.  Here, they charge $4.00 for a water bottle.  The ice room is nowhere to be found (I spent a lot of time looking).  And internet is $13.99 per night.  All of these extra charges are really off putting.  

While these charges are annoying, they alone are not enough to merit a two star rating.  That is attributable to the poor (or rather old) quality of their rooms, the lack of selection of things to do at the hotel, and the incompetency of staff here.  

On my first day here, I placed a ""privacy please"" sign on my door, only to return to find that my room had been made anyway.  This hotel offers a $10 voucher for every day that you call and ask them to ""go green"" (forgo cleaning service) the day before.  I did this but never got my $10 voucher.  

As for the quality of the room, on my Hilton Honors preferences, I have it listed that I like to be close to the elevator, for sake of ease when lugging around my luggage.  This is the first time however that I've been placed next to the elevator and have been able to hear the elevators running through the walls.  It was raining the day I arrived so I thought the elevator was the sound of thunder rolling, but I never saw any lightning.  The running elevator noise was particularly annoying when I was trying to sleep.  

Aside from this, the size of the room is decent.  The mattress quality is barely passing and the pillows are crap.  The bathroom tub is disappointing because it's small, but mainly because it traps moisture and so smells dank.  

I will say to its benefit though that even though it's located off the strip, the monorail connects directly to the hotel, so getting out to the strip is relatively painless ($5 for a single ride).  I only stayed here because I was attending a conference on-site.  Also, this is where Elvis played 837 sold-out shows, so there is some nostalgic history to this place.  

But ultimately I think for what you have to pay to be here, it's worth it to splurge and stay on the strip.  Or if you're looking to save, go ahead and go a few tiers lower so you can get one of those motels that offer free breakfast and internet.  

I remain a loyal Hilton Honors member, but I doubt I'll ever stay here again.",bAzdeuQiR80wVOLUh7ox7g,1,0,2,B04sc38byQjRhCbgSg650g

First we arrived early at 1230 and was told that they had no rooms available for early check-in.  That's understandable and I realized that it was a little early.  We were told that the room should be ready by 3pm.  We finally show back up at 3 and was told that they still had no rooms for us.  Instead they wanted to put us into a handicap room.  We refused and they ""found"" us another room.  After we walked up and opened the door, lo and behold the room was still dirty and not clean.  We call the front desk and told them about the situation and were given no other choices other than to wait for the maid to clean it.  This is the most in accommodating and unprofessional hotel I have ever stayed at.  After waiting outside the room for an hour the room is finally cleaned and we get to go inside.

With so many bad reviews I'm wondering if things could have changed in the past 2 months.  Both of my stays this year were great.  All of the employees were very nice, the rooms were decent, the buffet was excellent, the coffee shop was good (yes, it was expensive), Benihana was good, the show ""Raiding the Rock Vault"" deserves 5 stars, and we had a great time in the casino.  I agree that the parking garage is quite a walk, but if you park behind the sports book you walk right into the hotel.

57843,2014-07-04,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I stayed there recently as I accompanied my wife who was attending a convention. It was weird because when we checked in it was LVH, and by the time we checked out it had become Westgate. 

The location is great, near the strip but not on it. It is literally next to the monorail station for easy strip access ($5 each way), and for conventioneers its perfect as its right next door to the Convention Center.  Since its not on the strip it was easy to get in and out of with my rental car, which was important to me, as I was mainly there to play golf and check out Red Rock Canyon.

The room was ok. It was in the Central Tower. The bed was comfy. The bathroom was clean and functional, which is all I really care about, though it was bit dated. It could use a makeover. I had no issues with noise or odors. Overall I was content with the room itself. We had a nice view of the golf course behind the hotel with the mountains in the distance. The room service didn't show up until around 4 pm which we found inconvenient. For the last couple of days we opted out of room service and got $8 vouchers each day for food, drink or retail at the hotel. The room had a Keurig coffee machine, but they charged $3.50 per cup! Not cool. They also had water bottles in the for $4 each. No thanks. No fridge or mini bar. That nickel and diming really cost them a star in my rating. 

The casino was ok, not too big or crowded and easy to get around. The sportsbook room is huge and was a fun place to watch the World Cup which was going on at the time. All the dealers had t-shirts on pushing the hotel's ""Raiding the Rock Vault"" show instead of classic dealer outfits, which cranked the class level down a notch. The hotel really pushed that show, ""Classic rock by those who rocked it"". I'm sorry, I can't get excited about the keyboard player from the Lita Ford band, or the replacement singer from Quiet Riot. 

I liked the pool. It wasn't packed with rowdy bachelors or bachelorettes. They had a 2-for-1 drink special for happy hour.

The food options were ok, but nothing remarkable. On our last night, after most of the conventioneers were gone, some of the places were closed which limited our options. 

We talked with our waitress on our last night and she was excited about the change in ownership, as the new owners were promising to sink some serious money into the place. I think it's a great location (for those who aren't going simply to party), and with a refresh could become a great place.",e2gwYwhiTtmWwyFJGuKYRA,4,0,3,g1Z9G6vcmyuaDBkEnW9v9A
61102,2012-10-11,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"*just passing through*

The only reason I came by LVH is because it has a monorail station located conveniently near the front entrance, and I had to get to the strip from the adjacent hilton grand vacations hotel next door.

The reason I am writing this review is to tell you how hilarious I thought it was that I unintentionally and without warning stepped into the most ghetto fabulous hip hop club trying to exit the monorail and the hotel. To get to the monorail, I had to walk through this deserted bar/lounge space, which 4 hours later had turned into a straight up club. The music was awesome - just my style - and there was space on the dance floor so I took my time leaving the premises. However, let me just say this club is definitely for the LOCALS. and young locals at that. I was definitely a cougar to these little boys. Some of the guys were definitely cute (local ladies you're lucky), but I don't do younger guys EVER - I am into older men all the way. The ladies were looking a bit jersey shore with a ton of whored up makeup and just super trashy/skanky outfits...but if that's your type of one night stand, go for it. 

Luckily, I finally figured out how to exit the club and walked into the practically empty casino. I liked having my selection of slots and it wasn't smoky. Oh, and the employees were all very nice. So I'd go back to gamble in peace cause I don't want to be bothered with crowds and obnoxious people.

The Star Trek themed part of the casino is interesting. I went on the Star Trek experience ride before several years ago -- It was entertaining. The buffet at this Hilton is a good deal at under $20. 

As a Vegas arcade connoiseur I find the Hilton's arcade to be lacking. It is tiny and does not have much variety.

This is not your parent ""Hilton"".  Gone are the times of clean and neat and fun.
Very run down in the casino, lobby and most all public areas.   The pool is just a step above the Holiday inn express, the only thing that saves the pool area is that fact you can drink away you misery.

The rooms are tolerable but small.  Beds were way to soft.  HDTV nice.  HD channels? NOPE!  wth.  Half the channels in spanish, not that I go to Vegas to watch TV but when I get up to see the weather for the day I would like to see it in HD.

Was nice having a small fridge in room. A+ there.

Dont get me started with the elevators.  Minimum 15 minute wait for an elevator.  Make sure you dont leave anything in your room before you head out for the night.  If you do you might miss your show, dinner reservation etc.   We frequently had to ride up to the top just to get back to the lobby level.  Some people were waiting as much as 30 minutes for an elevator.   4 elevatrors service the north tower and only 2 were working. At least the hotel could man up and inform you at check in about the potential for a long wait.  But maybe this soon to be imploded landmark is trying to save electricity by using only half the elevators.

We went on a Groupon and I would never stay here on purpose again unless I got a review from someone I know who actually has stayed recently.

It is a palce to sleep and shower.  That is it.    No frills, long waits, cloudy pool water.

79589,2010-09-10,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I recently was back in Las vegas for the 12th time in 3 years and found myself back at LVH. 
I have stayed everywhere in Las Vegas and have found this place to be be the best place for my lifestyle. I dont enjoy places that are too busy or have a party vibe and the LVH fits in perfectly for what im looking for.
This time I only stayed 1 night but for a few hiccups I was once again happy.
I got to Hilton at arounf 230pm and got checked in very quickly. The front desk people were very friendly as usual. 
After I got to my room I  got my only 2 hiccups. First I was on the 3rd floor...LAME! I paid for an upgraded room and was told my room was going to be on a floor between 22-29 I think. I didnt complain because unless you do something totally horrible I will just deal with it. Second and last complaint was that the view from my window was of the golf course which is okay but if you looked down all I saw was the dumpsters. Okay, not exactly perfect but since I wasnt going to spend alot of time in my room and was only staying 1 night it wasn't a huge problem.
I got to my room and it was nice. It suited my needs for the day and was very comfortable. I quickly got unpacked and headed for the pool (which conveintly happens to be on the 3rd floor) and sat down by the pool and just relaxed. The pool had maybe 20 people in it and was very quiet..just the way I like it. Stayed at the pool for about an hour headed back to my room to get changed again.
After changing I made a B line for the gaming floor. I decided I wanted to play some slots so I found my favorite slot (Goldfish) and sat down and started playing. I decided I wanted a few drinks and found my cocktail waitress (which she was amazing...forget her name tho) and ordered some wine. She came back very quickly and this girl was on her A game because everytime I was about finished with my drink she was there with a new one. I stayed at the slots for about 2 hours maybe moreand decided it was time to go
 with an extra few bucks in my pocket and a very satisfied patron.
After that I didnt spend much more time in the hotel since I was meeting some friends down at Ballys but when I returned later that night I was hungry and stopped in at Paradise Cafe and got something to take to my room. I ordered an omlette with coffee. The omlettes there at Paradise Cafe are always great and the coffee is probably the best coffee in town. If I wasn't staying at LVH I would def make a special trip just to get coffee. I wish my casino had that coffee.
 After eating part of my meal I jumped into bed and had a wonderful sleep. The beds were comfortable and it was very quiet.
 The next morning I got packed up went to the front desk and checked out.
I lover this place. I have never had a horrible experience here. It's off the strip on the north end of town and its very quiet and easy to get in and out off. The atmosphere is great because its a more mature clientle. I will def be back at Hilton soon but I hope I can get off the 3rd floor.",qNArJBHeW7Zq6pVawljujQ,1,1,4,k-M9pU5p4Htk08SSlKXltQ

Cons: Rooms are what you pay for. Pillows are terrible. Rooms starting to show wear. Off the strip, staff appear to hate their jobs, pool isn't heated, a ton of kids (could be pro or con depending on you), but for a couple in their mid 20's, the pool was a circus. Subpar gaming. Lack of any good restaurants. My room had a keurig without any k-cups. You can purchase single k cups in the lobby for an absurd amount of money. And you are given two styrofoam coffee cups wrapped in plastic. They will charge you $3.50 for each cup that goes missing. $4 water bottles in room (typical). Oh and although its cheap, this place has $18 resort fees per day and you are charged a deposit for each night. For example, I'm here 3 nights and I was charged $90 in deposits alone. This is Because they bank on you taking the water, coffee, use the Internet, and need to be able to nickel and dime you. Be aware.

2.  Hotel check-in.  Ouch! There was a terrible line for check-in -- probably 150 people -- but they handled it quickly.  This was probably to be expected on the Friday of the Memorial day weekend.

3.  Property.  This hotel was formerly the Las Vegas Hilton.  It was one of the very best hotels back in the day.  Now there are dozens of fancy, themed hotels, so this hotel is showing its age.  It's just not exciting like the others.  The guest rooms were recently refurbished and quite nice but the building in general is showing its age.

The hallway was really noisy at night so there wasn't much of a sound barrier, and I could smell smoke in my room a lot. Other than that I like it and would stay there again if I can really get a non smoking room. I also noticed that the elevators were slow on a busy weekend.

""Refurbished"" means some new furniture (but not all, the chairs in the room are obviously over 20 years old) but it's the same, tired carpet and antiquated heating and cooling system. Be careful in the shower because the water takes more than four minutes to get warm (in an area that needs to conserve water no less) then it suddenly goes scalding hot and you can't adjust it down quickly.  The garden tub is a nice size, obviously, but it has seen a lot of use and is not welcoming.

There are no towel holders on the walls so wet washcloths have to lay on the sink or tub to dry if towels are covering the shower rod.  Many towels and washcloths are so worn out you can see through spots and all towels and washcloths are rough and scraggly.

I'm here with a group, registered under the group name, and I checked in at the same time as a colleague. Apparently we didn't have the same registration-types and my colleague got, basically, $135 and I got a bunch of useless coupons. I would have thought the gentleman at reception would have adjusted my reservation to give me the same deal rather than simply pointing out the discrepancy.

The casino is small, and the players are even worse.   Stay here, but don't play here.  The pit bosses are friendly and probably the best part of the hotel.

When we told him no sorry we cant help you out he just stayed by us waited a good 5 minutes then left. How scary!! I mean where was the security?? The next morning as we checked out and was waited for our ride in the lounge area by the other slot machines, I notice that man that was begging us for money last night was still in the hotel begging people for money in the same clothes from last night I knew he wasn't gambling because i'd watch him ask the waitress for a drink and sat on a machine and pretended to play but didn't put any money in.

1. Food Options - times are terrible.  Food is not readily available and several places are closed at odd times.  Sometimes feels like you are forced to eat at one place because it's the only restaurant open.  Buffet times are limited, Deli times are limited.  Limited to coffee shop and maybe a pizza place.

2. Valet Service - IS TERRIBLE!  If you pay for quicker service when retrieving your car, a.k.a. giving a valet driver a $10 or $20 in the corner, you will get your car right away.  If not, you will wait and wait and wait.  This was tested and proven and the valet office staff will tell you that if you're willing to do this, you WILL get your car quicker.

3. No fun for kids - nothing for kids to do at this hotel except to use the pool.

Everything about the place is sort of average to just slightly above. It was clean and had a decent size room but the casino is very under-whelming. We were out and about so much that it served the purpose of a decent place to catch a few hours of sleep between activities. Did not eat at any of the dining establishments as none caught our eye. The location off strip is a bit hindering but it is on the mono-rail which remedies that quite a bit. I will say if you are a sports junkie then definitely spend some time in their sportsbook.

I was pretty much the only person on my floor when I stayed there in March, except for 1 neighbor who woke up around 5am and smoked until breakfast. You can pretty much hear everything. And smell everything, obvi. My room was right across from the central tower elevators and I could hear the elevators every time they whooshed by or ping-ed open.

The only thing that really irritated me is that I paid 109 to reserve my room in advance and the day before I left, I was receiving spam from the hotel, saying I could stay there for $65 that same night if I reserved now. Maybe retarget your emails, Marketing. Not cool, esp since I had to pay an advance deposit.

Upon my return, I had to remove myself from their email list, bc I guess they assume everyone is a high roller and comes to Vegas every week. 

Maybe they should set up some better customer databases to store guest info...

In general, it was an ok experience. I just really loathe paying more than $100 for a bed to sleep on and a shower to get ready in. 

AND you have to pay for internet, $14/day. I hate how the more expensive a hotel is, the more they nickel and dime you. Give me a $50 Rodeway Inn any day. There is very little difference between a $50 hotel room and a $150 room.

I could walk to the Riviera, but I had a laptop and it was kind of heavy (half mile or so by the time you get off and onto the properties). I was revising a conference presentation and my dissertation; I didn't have a lot of time to explore the area.

You can ask for all of the upgrades you want, but when you check in put a twenty dollar bill between your credit card and license.  I did this last week and I got an end room that was three times the normal size with a couch, a great view of the golf course, clean, nice rug, not some of the hellholes mentioned here.  I was in the north tower that at least has some rooms that are recently renovated like mine.  From a room perspective this was a nicer and larger room than just about any I've stayed in.

The hotel itself, the casino was relatively lively but you are probably going to venture out to the Strip and downtown anyway.  The SDX downtown express is close, the Monorail stop is at the hotel and what could you want for forty bucks a night.  Go green, and you get five bucks a day to spend on coffee or whatever.  Check-in took five minutes at 2PM on a Thursday, again the guy behind the counter couldnt have been nicer and was generally surprised and appreciative about the twenty spot.  No matter how weak a hotel in Vegas is, they have nice rooms for the customers they want to keep. Spend 20 bucks and upgrade.

The only thing that sucked was the bar staff at the pool.  Slow, lazy, wouldnt take a voucher for free drinks with some lame-o excuse.

Short version- This place sucks. If you smoke and want to stumble between slot machines and your room, then maybe you'd have a good time. 

Long version - 

Arrival - the bell staff at the curb side were less than friendly. No offer for assistance with baggage, no welcoming feeling. Walking in you're greeted with a plume of cigarette smoke, which to most nowadays is very unpleasant. The main entrance drops you right into their casino. The front desk staff is nice enough, but not overwhelmingly happy you're there with them. I asked for a non smoking floor / non smoking room. After checking in, I made my way to the elevators. Got up to my room (10th floor), and went about unpacking. 

Hotel room - old carpet, a bathroom which looks like it's from my grandmothers house, and an air conditioning system which just crap. There must be something screwy with their HVAC system as it seems all of the cigarette smoke from the casino just gets pulled up into your room. Entering the room, the stench of cigarette smoke was even worse than the casino. The television signal was shoddy, with fuzz and blanking images. Getting over the room, I unpacked and went out for dinner. Unfortunately is didn't do a quality check on the bed before leaving...

Getting home rather late, I went back to my room. Pulled down the covers and was greeted with sheets which had cigarette burns in them. Awesome. Called house keeping which took 45 min to arrive. The attendant was kind, changed my sheets and I preceded to go to bed. 

Woke up the next morning and took a shower. The water is either scalding hot or freezing cold. Awesome. 

Cab drivers always know what's a good place and what's a bad place. The fact that there was always a 30 min line for cabs told me something was up. 

This place lives and dies on conventions. It's  not really ""attached"" to the convention center, although you only need to cross 1 street. 

There is a little restaurant where many eat breakfast in the am. Called ""paradise"". Trust me. It's not. My friend and I got each :
1 omelet
1 coffee 
1 juice 
Side bacon 
Side white bread toast

About the only good thing I could say is that the girl who checked me in was nice, but even she was frustrated because the computer she was working at kept freezing up on her.

The room I am in is roomy and spacious but considering that it hasn't been remodeled since the 50's (basing that comment on the style not the actual date) but I am going to check when it was built. The beds are old, the carpets are old, the bathrooms are old, the decor is old. I found a shard of metal in the carpet the hard way. The shower/bath won't turn off all the way so I heard that all night. The walls must not be insulated or thin but I could hear the neighbors all the time except when they were sleeping.

Unfortunately I cannot escape because Expedia won't help. As soon as I can figure out how to slam Expedia they are next, the customer service people in Asia can't figure out how to help except for regurgitating the pre-printed responses they are given to read back to the customer AND they cannot or will not transfer me to someone in the US.

I had read some terrible reviews and being the picky traveler that I am I was highly concerned. We arrived late at night to a very long check in line but it moved fairly quickly. They had no trouble locating our reservation and they were very pleasant in stating that they can't guarantee the number of beds, when I asked to confirm that our room was indeed a 2 bedded room. They did not have this in the room type we had reserved so she offered us an upgrade at no extra cost, she stated it was next to the elevator. It turns out it was across from the elevator, so I rather enjoyed that location. They were replacing the ice machine on our floor so I had to search for one and finally ended up locating one on the floor below us. It would have been helpful to have had a sign posted telling us where to go for ice while they were working. 

Although the LVH is not on the strip, it is just a couple blocks away and I fell in love with valet parking in Las Vegas. All the hotels we went to had complimentary valet. It is expected that you tip the gentleman doing all that work, but what is a few dollars for door to door service. Plus we never had to wait for our vehicle when picking it up, with the exception of the MGM Grand, they just seemed so expansive that they could not keep up with the amount of overheated guest. We did run into a few times where the LVH valet was full. I would have thought that they would have reserved some spaces for there own guest returning after a long day. That seemingly small detail would have probably bumped up my view another star. Especially since this happened more than once and self parking was a nightmare to navigate and secure a space. 

The pool was a bit over chlorinated for my liking but they provided more than a sufficient amount of lounge chairs. Also, we went during the happy hour so there was a DJ and 2 for 1 drinks. Bonus!

About the place.  The rooms were decently nice.  Good floor plan  clean.  Lobby was nice as was the casino.

First off, the place is at the end of the monorail.  That's not such a bad thing but be prepared to spend an extra $30 bucks for a 3 day pass.  Even then you do so much walking to get to the stations.  Because it's so far away once you are back at your hotel you don't want to leave again.  Plan on 20 minutes to get from LVH to the MGM grand.

The first night I knew it was going to be rough.  The walls are paper thin.  The hallways echo VERY VERY loud.  If anyone is talking, much less with a drunken yell be prepared to be woken up.  I could literally here my neighbors conversations, their bathroom habits and cell phone conversations.  It was RIDICULOUS.  I have never stayed in a hotel like this.  I did not get any sleep for the 3 nights I was there.

I wouldn't normally write a review but I got a nice surprise on my credit card bill after I left.  Even though the room was in my friends name and was ""comped"" I had ordered room service and didn't want him to pay for it.  Upon checkout I swapped the CC used for incidentals.  Turned out I ended up PAYING FOR THE ROOM! My friend called the Mgr and was told I didn't gamble enough to stay there free.  WTH.  It was free at checkin and after I leave it's not.  VERY poor business management in my opinion.  Had I known I was going to pay for a hotel I would have chosen one much closer to the strip and action.

I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Poor management and horrible experience overall.",_oiLrt6JH2Uk2XlrTJRKkg,2,0,1,RAZkLovtkbJWfjtuhuKEZw

334256,2014-03-08,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"First of all, a little context. We go to Vegas about once a month whenever we get bored with LA. That means we always grab last minute hotel deals, and we have stayed in a large number of hotels. Last week we went to Las Vegas for a show, and happened to stay at LVH. We are going again next week for the Supernatural Convention, and we will be at the Bellagio. Now, if I gave both the Bellagio and the LVH 4 stars, does it mean they are equally as nice? Hardly. Like many reviewers already know, you can score LVH at rock bottom prices. At one fifth of the cost of Bellagio, is the LVH only one fifth as nice? I'd say LVH is much better than that. It has the big Las Vegas hotel atmosphere (it used to be a Hilton). Big front entrance, bright and airy foyer, quick access to the check in counters (many large hotels make you grind through the casino area). Check in was quick and painless, although I must say that despite my effort to carry on a pleasant conversation with the clerk, she was all business and no smile. Curt, but not surly. 

The room faced the strip, though at an angle, so you are not staring down the center of the strip. Nice enough view anyway. The size, decor and cleanliness were good enough for a 3 star hotel. Bathroom was clean. While not flawless, it was well maintained. Shower pressure was fine even though it won't give you the tropical downpour experience that I prefer. The toiletries were of near-lux quality as well. The only issue I had with the room was the thin wall. While the entire stay was nice and quiet, in the wee hours of Saturday morning (5am) I was awakened by some couple nearby (next room or upstairs) going at it for 30 minutes. By the sound of it, she was definitely having a good time. You can chalk it up as a bother, but I'd say it was free entertainment.  

It's about price versus value. For the same cost of a nice dinner you get to stay in a pretty decent hotel, so don't be snotty and say this is not palatial or luxurious enough for you. Having said that, I have to take a star off because, along with many other anxious people, we had to wait 45 minutes for the valet to bring our car. Checkout time on Sunday is tough for all hotel valets in Las Vegas, but I didn't see any hustle from these guys.

Travis went above and beyond to ensure my stay was top notch, even sending my daughter a cake for her birthday! Btw, the cake was delicious. Overall, I was pleased with the accommodations.

346099,2012-08-14,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"LVH is getting an upgrade from me!

I wound up getting a room at The LVH the other night.  I'm not going to lie, I wasn't expecting much.

Well, I'm here to tell you I'm a believer in The LVH!  The room we stayed in was recently remodeled and very large and comfortable.  We had a standard room, but upgraded to the premium (as opposed to the classic). 

Here are the pros and cons of The LVH premium rooms and of the casino in general:

Pros:
-Very spacious rooms, recently remodeled
-Flat screen TV with plenty of channels
-Comfortable bed
-Well-lit bathroom, large shower, vanity mirror, and real hairdryer 
-Room and bathroom were spotless
-Friendly employees at check-in, easy to check-in
-Lots of deals to the restaurants for staying at the casino
-No ridiculous resort fee like every other casino in Vegas charges their customers
-It has a Vegas Monorail station
-Very close to Convention Center

Cons:
-Furniture a little worn
-Bathroom could be a little bigger
-Radio needs replaced with an iPod docking station
-Could hear the neighbors at 3 in the morning drunkenly talking about their exploits in Vegas
-Shower was cold at night (but was fine in the morning)
-Getting to the parking lot is a hike
-Check-in and check-out can get heavily backed up
-Casino is far from everything else in Vegas
-Casino is seriously lacking restaurant choices and interesting bars/lounges to spend the evening

Basically it comes down to this: Are you ok with driving or riding the monorail to visit the rest of Vegas and to get dinner?  If you are, you will save a ton of money staying here without sacrificing a comfortable place to stay.  We really enjoyed our room and on the Thursday night we were there we paid only $40.  $40 after tax!  The hotels on The Strip were going to cost at least $80 a night after resort fees and taxes, and that was for the Excalibur and Luxor which have older rooms than The LVH.  

If you are more concerned about convenience and don't want to worry about getting in a car to find dinner, then I would think about staying somewhere on The Strip.  If you would only be taking a cab to get around, you're going to lose a lot of the money you are saving on a room, so - again - I would think about staying somewhere else.

I really hope The LVH gets some new bars and restaurants soon to make their casino more of a destination that people would want to stay at.  Until then, I just have to take it for what it is: a nice hotel with an ok casino that's far from the real action in Vegas.

Four stars based off of quality of room and price I paid.  Still sticking with my two previous stars based off the casino alone.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,10,3,4,ESymIK3cdoEDa2WBrE1Qxg

The staff was amazing...helped to the best of their ability and always very friendly, especially the valet staff.  Like I mentioned before, I did the $20 sandwich and got the bedroom portion of a suite - complete with flat screen, fridge, new pillow top mattress and nice bathroom.  It is kind of weird that part of the Star Trek theme is still in the casino...but no Star Trek Experience; still plenty of games there to play.

It's one of the biggest conventions they have, so you would think that a little prep work might have gone into their hospitality. No. The room that I stayed in was dirty, but even stains I can get past (blood stain on me sheet that, after 3 days was never changed). The thing I can't get over is the service. I had arranged for breakfast to be brought to my room every morning. I called the night before and was told it would be to my room first thing. I stressed that I had to be out of my room by 8 in the morning at the absolute latest. They said, not a problem. 2 out of the 3 days, it never came. Just never came at all. After I called and called I was met with rude ladies who seemed more aggravated that I was bothering them than anything else. Also, I called them to have my tv fixed which wasn't working. I had to call 4 times to get even a timeline of when I might see someone. After a few hours, I decided to give it a go myself. I would seriously dismay any person from ever booking here. Being in close vicinity to the convention center is not worth the lack of service and filth that this hotel has to offer. 

I will say that there is one saving grace. The bell hops who brought up the food (the one time it came for breakfast) and the other time when we ordered dinner (extremely low in quality...I don't recommend it) were extremely nice. They were older and seemed genuinely concerned with our well being.

Reasons for the 1 star:
1) They nickle and dime you for EVERYTHING. Where most hotels have free coffee and safe service in the room, the LVH charges $3/day for use of the safe, and $4 single cup of kurig instant crap coffee, $4 for a bottle of water.
2) In-room internet: $15 a day per device. Really? To connect my ipad and phone both to wi-fi and my partner to do the same would have cost us $60/day!
3) The hotel itself has NO free internet zones. To get free wi-fi you need to walk all the way to the convention center that is happy to offer this service
4) Most of the restaurants close between 8-9pm. Lame. This is Vegas and you are a casino. There are also no 24 hour eating spots, after 1pm you are SOL.
5) Beds: Very poor.I had 2 beds in my room and both where tilted to the centre of the room. Uncomfortable.
6) The ""air conditioning"" in the room was horrible, either it was spewing out ice box temperature fridgid air or the heat was on. No happy medium.
7) TV: most of the channels are grainy, and those are limited to a dozen. Didn't even try for the pay movies due to the poor quality TV set.
8) The Pool: tiny and with little shade

Good points:
1) They have a green service that if you remember to call the night before and request your room not be cleaned they give you a $8 coupon to use for food.

When I first arrived to the LVH, I immediately noticed the type of crowd this hotel attracts. The majority of the crowd here appeared to be from the Bronx or from the ghetto. The hotel itself was out dated, old, and in need of remodeling. My room smelled like an old ashtray, the mattress caved in, and the bathroom was crusty along the edges.

The people who stayed across the room from mine were drug addicts. These people were wired up and did not sleep. For 2 days and nights, these people played loud music, yelling, screaming using profanity. I could not sleep a wink. Eventually, someone made a complaint to the front desk about all the noise. The front desk sent security to warn these people. Unfortunately, this made these people more angry. They began to turn the music full blast. They heard that someone made a complaint against them, so they retaliated against all the nearby rooms including mine. They starting kicking on my door, cursing and using threats. I was so stressed out, I had to cut my stay short.

I called the front desk to complain, but they didn't seem to care much. This was the worst experience I ever had staying in Vegas. Do yourself a favor, pay the extra money and stay at a nicer hotel.

Those of you familiar with The Orleans know it is not pretentious, but has some great amenities that are free or affordable. 

This time I planned a last minute trip and The Orleans was sold out. So Expedia had a great rate for The Hilton or LVH as they are now calling themselves. I got 2 nights (weekdays) for $150 including the resort fee. I hate resort fees. But anyway....

I checked in on a Monday night. Check in way easy and so was finding my room. Unfortunately when I got to my room there were several problems: a broken phone, a clogged sink, and a non working safe. And I have to add it was a very odd looking room with a good deal of unused space. 

I called down to the operator (there is no front desk) button. I was bounced around from the operator to the front desk a few times as no one at the front desk was picking up. Once someone did pick up I was put on hold for quite some time. Finally when someone answered they told me to come down to the front desk and they would switch my room. 

The switch was done easily and the room was nicer in general (east tower).  But the safe in my new room didn't work either. I called down to the front desk and they asked me if they should send someone up. Stupid question and of course I said yes. 

It took about 30?minutes but 2 polite maintenance workers came up. They fixed it easily. It seems as the previous occupant was a comedian and decided to lock a water bottle in the safe before he left. That was he end of the night. 

Today I strayed off by looking for the buffet. Although the hotel book in my room said it was open for breakfast it wAs not. So I left the hotel and went about my day. 

When I returned I laid out at their pool. The pool area is really nice and I consider it the highlight of the hotel. I will try to enjoy this again in the morning before I head back to LA.

The coffee place made fabulous lattes! While we were there, the Star Trek attraction was closed, as was a Mexican restaurant we wanted to try, but we were there not long after the economy nosedived. 

They (like all Vegas hotels) wanted to nickel-and-dime you for extras: $10/night for a mini-fridge, I believe $14/day for wifi, but we didn't need those things. FYI, there is a business center in the hotel, down the hall past the salon. They required a debit card and yes, it was kind of pricey per-minute, but perfect for us, since we wanted to do less than 30 minutes of work. 

We chose the Hilton because the purpose of the trip was a job recruitment, which we thought was at the LV Convention Center (literally right next door to the hotel). It wasn't, but again, not the hotel's fault. The biggest drawback was location: It's a LONG (~20 min.) walk to the nearest Strip property (the Riviera) and Deuce stop, especially if, like us, you're there in the summer. 

If you want to go to Fremont St., there's a CAT bus that stops right outside the hotel's gate, and there were always lots of cabs available. So be prepared to hoof it or take a taxi. Upside, there's a monorail stop attached to the hotel that stops at several point along the east side of the Strip.

THe down side would be that it is NOT on the strip, and although it might seem pretty close, it is not. it's like a 20 minute walk to the startosphere, and even then you are just on the crappy end of the strip.

It was about 1/3 of the cost of staying on the strip on a Saturday night and we were only going to be in the hotel for about 9 hours so I figured, why not? This hotel is in need of some serious updates. There was water dripping from the ceiling in the hallway leading to our elevator. The area was roped off with a garbage can in the middle to catch the water but it was still dripping on people as you walked by. The room was ok, bed was comfortable. We went down early to spend a little time at the pool before checkout. Not crowded like most pools on the strip, so that was nice. We went back to our room shortly before checkout so I could take a quick shower before checking out. I opened the shower curtain to find a puddle of black sludge on the floor of the shower. Needless to say, I decided against showering in it. When I told the front desk about it at checkout, she had a bit of an attitude that I was complaining because I didn't call anyone to tell them 1st. I tried explaining to her that there wasn't really time for that, as I had to check out. She gave me a free upgrade for next time, but I don't foresee myself ever staying here again!

513279,2014-01-14,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"My stay at LVH was from December 28 through December 31, 2013.

Overall, I felt the hotel was an acceptable venue. The room was comfortable, but showed signs of age, and the same could be said about the hotel as a whole. I think it's a reasonable choice for anyone looking for easy access to The Strip (via the Monorail) without paying Strip prices. A more detailed review follows.

We received a room on the 19th floor of the North Tower, which has not yet been remodeled. The elevator bank had five elevators, but as far as we could tell, only four were operational. There were multiple times of day requiring very long waits (up to five minutes) to get an elevator, and when going down, we'd often stop at almost every floor, frequently leaving people behind because there was no more room. When leaving our room, we took to pushing the ""up"" button and riding to the top just so we'd be guaranteed an elevator.

The room itself was a fairly average hotel room. It was clear that it was older and in need of remodeling. The most disappointing aspect was the television. I'd read online that the room would have a flatscreen TV, so I brought along an HDMI cable in the hopes of streaming video from my laptop. However, the TV was one of the oldest type of flatscreens I'd ever seen, and therefore had no HDMI connection. The picture itself was problematic because the aspect ratio was set to something odd and stretchy, and we were unable to fix it because there was no aspect button on the remote, and the ""menu"" button on the TV itself had either been disabled or was broken. On the positive side, the bed was quite comfortable, the room was clean, the bathroom was a decent size, and the tub was large. The shower pressure was on the weaker side, but not so much as to be problematic. I was also pleased that the a/c unit, while definitely old, worked well and was not annoying noisy when cutting off and on.

The dining that we did within the hotel was actually very good. We enjoyed meals at Benihana and at the Burger Bistro. Both were quite tasty. We were very surprised, however, to find that when we went to the Burger Bistro on a Saturday night, they were closing at 9pm. We took a seat at 8:45 without knowing this, and quickly found ourselves to be the only guests. However, the serving staff was still very pleasant and helpful, and did not seem bothered by our late arrival. 

My biggest frustration with the hotel related to their tennis facility. I was very excited to see that they had tennis on the premises, including a pro shop, and I had my tennis gear with me. The hotel advertised that the facilities were open daily from 9am to 5pm, and the pro shop was open until 3pm. So I headed down with my gear, and initially could not figure out how to even get to the pro shop. Many of the signs were faded and difficult to read, and I found that the main path, which is through the pool area, was closed off since the pool was closed. Eventually, I was directed by someone at the spa to walk around, which involved walking over a strange gravel path, behind the mechanical equipment on the roof of the building. And, as you might have guessed, when I got to the pro shop, it was closed, and all of the tennis courts were locked up. The sign on the door indicated that someone would return in 15 minutes, but it was fairly obvious looking inside that no one had been there that day, and probably in quite some time beyond that. I called the phone number on the door and left voicemail, but I never heard back from anyone for the duration of the trip.
I'm not much for shopping in these sorts of properties, so I don't feel like I can comment much on how interesting the stores were. We visited the gift shop a couple of times for sundries and found what we needed. A sweets shop appeared to be on the verge of opening, and the only other store I recall was focused on items with bling. 

My last comment would be regarding the parking. We parked consistently in the lot for the North Tower, which is a multi-story structure with no physical attachment to the hotel. Getting to the hotel involved a bit of a walk, including crossing an internal ""street."" I watched a number of people struggle to lug luggage across this path, and I couldn't help but think how miserable that would be in extreme cold or heat or rain. Certainly not ideal.

Despite the complaints, I would still be willing to stay here again, although it would not be my first (or second or third) choice. It's a functional hotel with a few perks, but it has quite a ways to go in order to be on par with its Strip counterparts. Hopefully, the construction we were able to see during our stay means they're working on it.",EDfEcGni8rKB0bvFGWoIKA,0,0,3,o6zatBVcvVA9jgf66fZHNg
518379,2014-05-05,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Just returned from a long Vegas weekend.  This place was AWESOME!  I was honestly worried after reading the reviews, but this place ROCKED in every aspect of accommodations that affected me.  

Check-in was smooth and they accommodated my early arrival.  There were 20 or 21 check-ins ahead of me and it took exactly 22 minutes for me to reach the counter.  I stayed in the East Tower on the 10th floor.  AWESOME ROOM.  Furniture still smelled new, carpet was new, view was incredible.  Bathroom remodel was rather plush, with nice furniture grade fixture and marble floors and shower walls.  Hot water instantly, great drainage, and plush towels.  Nice shampoo, and conditioner, and lotion.  Nice soaps, too.  Closet had real hangers.  Nice 37"" flat screen and a little refrigerator.  Staff everywhere was ridiculously cool-  Randy at check-in, housekeeping (sorry, I forgot your name!) and the various restaurants.  Everyone was way, way nice.  

Yes, there is a $20/day resort fee that sucks.  You do get in-room WiFi for a single device.  I couldn't log into it-  seemed overwhelmed with users when I tried using it.

If you are a sports bettor, the Superbook is AWESOME!  Whole staff there was fantastic!  Even the drink service was plentiful.  (Judging from my waking condition, one might say too plentiful...)  

Don't be too skeptical-  They've emerged from their BK period and pumped a lot of cash into the place.  I recommend finding the many discounters and giving this place a try.  Priceline has decent deals there, as do, I'm sure, all the others.  Monorail is right there.  Use the multi-ride discount if you need to get to the strip a few times.  Note the cab ride in traffic cost me $27.50 from the airport but only $18.50 returning.  Their deli closes intermittently.  This place is four Yelp stars.

The rooms:  The beds were nice  (I was staying in the ""premium tower"") but beyond that?  Out of date, the carpet was kinda ratty, the shower must have been built for midgets because the showerhead was so low I had to almost squat in the tub to wash my hair, and the drain in the shower was so slow that by the end of your shower you were standing in calf deep water.

This place is nice and clean, and quiet. Our room was on the 19th floor, which was a little unnerving hearing the wind whip by that high up. The hotel is older, but everyone there was so nice--from the maid to the front desk to the omelette station guy and everyone in between.

We stayed in a standard, non-smoking room that did not smell like smoke. The major complaint I have is that the shower head is way too low and would cause someone above average height to have to contort themselves in a dangerous way to perform the simple task of hair-washing, hoping they don't slip and get hurt. I might be speaking from experience.

Carpets had stains on them. But even the standard room was spacious! I did a cartwheel just because I had the room. Bed was comfortable.

Also didn't like the soap products. The air there is dry enough already, but the hand and body soap made it much worse. You're in the dessert--shouldn't you use moisturizing soap?

Another plus to staying off the strip: you don't have to battle all that ridiculous traffic. Just zip down the back road and turn when you get to the Riviera.",ezXgY9toZGgUbUlQeB3vgA,0,0,3,Gc1-UI58t9vZ4pR5Ci4DIw

We'd stayed here about 5 years ago and were given an occupied room(!). It was mortifying.  But I thought w/new owners and a re-do, it was worth trying.  Never, ever again.
It wasn't very clean.  Someone had either spilled a tray from room service or thrown up outside our room. It had been hastily wiped up.  I pointed it out to one of the housekeepers but it remained for the duration of our stay.  
There was literally no hot water in the morning...none.  So we had to shower/wash our hair in cold water. This was a business trip!  We needed to look decent. Not a fun way to start day.  
Food choices were mediocre, at best.  The only plus is that their staff was cordial.

656049,2012-09-18,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"This hotel has definitely seen better days. It took about 45 minutes to check in on a Friday afternoon. We were set up in the Central Tower on the 18th floor. Sometimes the elevators will randomly stop on a floor with people in it. Even though we were set up in a non smoking room you could still smell that good old stale cigarette smell that becomes the only thing you can smell while staying here. The carpet was visibly stained which was an immediate turnoff. We tried to activate the in room safe by calling the automated number provided (which stated that the safe would be activated in less than 3 minutes) and after 30 minutes we called the front desk to inquire when it would be active and they told us that ""we are really busy but I will try to get somebody up as soon as I can."" After about an hour we gave up on the safe and went out. The water pressure in the shower is a joke no matter what time of day you decide to shower. OK, so there are some of the CONS.

 Now the PROS. Their sports-book is huge and is set up very well for football viewing parties. They do not hold back on the drinks when you are gambling for which this is especially true in the sports-book, where we spent most of our time. They don't require drink coupons like most ""strip"" casinos require to get the free drinks. They are connected to the monorail which can save you some money if you wanted to travel to the other strip hotels. Their slot machines seem to give you some good play on your money so I didn't have too much to complain about there. They have a decent point system for their players and when you sign up you get $10 in free slot play plus if you provide an email address you get an additional $5. I played a few hours over the two days and received about $40 on top. 

This vacation was purchased on the cheap admittedly so that is the reason for the second star. However, I expected a little better for a Vegas hotel that has 3 1/2 stars. It is old and run down and it is very apparent they haven't put any money back into the property. There are Vegas hotels that are 20 years old or more (like MGM) but they are constantly upgrading them. I also read that this property is in the middle of foreclosure...makes sense. It is no wonder that Hilton took their name off of the property. This was probably the place to be....back when 80's opulence was still in style.",920XFIrqEOAnAhg7EePq1g,1,0,2,pqI26uA1WmXEb9nszwZMhQ

Well, I ended up calling the LVH because they had good rates on line but we were unable to confirm online room. I told the reservation agent our sad story and did not want our girls weekend to end. She transferred us to Casino relations. C. gave us a great rate and some gambling money. When we checked in they were extremely busy and asked us to wait for room. We were tired and a bit disappointed but not complaining. The lobby was great and we were going to do some shopping. J. from the front desk upgraded our room so we could check in immediately. The room was great with a fabulous view of the strip. 

The monorail stops in the lobby of the hotel so getting around the city would have been easy. But we only had one night with out our kids so we decided to stay in house. We found great food at the Chinese Noodle place inside Benihanna. We had a blast in the casino that evening and slept quite well in our comfy queen-size beds. The resort also offers several good shows right there in theaters on the property. 

I only have two complaints. I only mention them because I hope management will fix them. The air-conditioning would not shut off or adjust temp. We were freezing! So we just shut it off all together. Also, when we first arrived in our room it looked as if they had not quite finished cleaning. The bathroom trash was full and the towels were on the floor.

Check-in:  Great personnel but a long, long, long, slow-moving line. No, really. It's a long, slow line. Budget about 35 minutes to check in.

Getting Around: It's a maze. And not a well-planned out one. I proactively decided to limit the alcohol consumption on my visit the minute I tried to find the second elevator vestibule on the right on the diagonal, past the slot machines, monorail entrance, coffee shop...oh hell, I'm lost.

Room: Very tired with spots on the sheets, carpet, and bed skirt. And a Las Vegas spot is a whole different kind of spot, so you get a little freaked out. The shower had the water pressure of a high-end water pick.

Staff: They are stellar. Housekeeping was sweet as can be; room service guy was the smiliest, happiest, helpful person ever. The poor lady at check in was still a total pro. I suggest they double the pay of these people because they are top notch.

We waited for 2 hours for the room we reserved a month and a half in advance.  When we got there, it looked like the housekeeping staff had thrown the blankets onto the bed, wiped a cloth over the dresser top and left.  The toilet seat had been removed and was sitting in the sink (?) The curtains were half-ripped down and the pins that hold up the curtains were all over the floor.  Someone-  either housekeeping or the previous guest-  had tried to hide the broken curtains by stuffing the edge of the cloth under the rod, but they had fallen down anyway.  

We called to have all of this fixed.  We were told someone would be right up.  Two hours later...  nothing.  Called again, were told it would be fixed within the hour.  We went to dinner, and three hours later...  the room hadn't been touched.  After FIVE complaints in TWELVE hours, they finally upgraded us to a suite and comped a bunch of stuff, which earned them a second star in my rating, but I definitely still have the bad taste in my mouth.

Overall, my experiences at Hilton hotels have been dissatisfying.  The Vegas one was just generally unclean and unkempt.

When we arrived, parking in the garage had me a little concerned, I didn't see a security presence at all and it seemed a bit sketchy, but ultimately my car was fine when we left.

I also loved the access to the monorail, it was super convenient since the hotel is on the northeast side of the Strip, it made getting to the other hotels so much cheaper and faster than taking cabs.

I have been to Vegas over 20 times, and have stayed at various hotels around the strip, and even stayed at LVH like 10 years ago.

However, my latest experience has been horrible:

1. Upon checking into the room, the drapes weren't working. I called room service and had the nerve to ask me to upgrade to a newer room, meaning I'd have to pay more.

2. Room was old and dirty. Smelled like smoke too, even though I specifically asked for non-smoking room.

3. I pressed the ""Green"" button and spoke to room service to not clean my room. In return I'm supposed to get a voucher for some in-hotel purchases. They never sent the voucher. I called them and they said they had no record. Yeah right! And then, they still didn't give me the voucher! Have to call them again...

4. They charge internet access at $13.99 PER device per day??! What a joke! Cmon, what a ripoff!

5. Bath tub is DIRTY. 

6. Room service, front desk. They all have poor attitude when talking to customers. 

7. There are leak marks in the ceiling.

8. Hardly any power outlets anywhere in the room. Hard to do any work when power is far away.

In summary, this is the absolute WORST place I've ever stayed at in Vegas. It feels run down, and I'm never coming to LVH again!",5BbJSJREruYRtZHq0uCGvw,3,0,1,VdJnKAEJ2h0jl1tgG_EVSw

My room was dirty. There was soap with hairs stuck to it and a dirty wash cloth in the bathroom. The floor was obviously not vacuumed because there were pennies and gun wrappers on the in front of the couch and under the coffee table. This makes one wonder if they even changed the sheets! Also, the curtain rod was broken off and laying behind the desk and both TV remote batteries were dead.
I called house keeping twice to have someone come clean it.  Apparently ""Terry"" never conveyed the message because they never came.  A maintenance man did come fix the batteries--I had called the front desk for that.
The next day I went to the front desk and told them what happened. When I returned to my room later that day, someone had come---and neatly placed the dirty hairy soap that was left behind by the previous tenant on a new wash cloth and and it on the tub ledge. ???

The BADs:

Farther from the strip than expected. A fair drive compared to having a room right on the strip and about a twenty minute walk to get anywhere near the good stuff!

The rooms are mediocre. Good for the price but some things just said they tried to cut corners here and there. Nothing that actually matters for instance the hair dryers and the thermostat, but I have payed less for better. Even on the Strip.

Service isn't very friendly at all and aren't accommodating in any way. Not the front desk, not the small stores in there, nothing. Not enough staff to care for everyone that stays there.

The place is a little crowded. They have a lot of rooms that can fit a lot of people but everyone is funneled into the main area/elevators and you feel like your fighting off kids/people as if you were at a carnival that came to a town for the first time in 10 years. 

The GOODs:

Valet Parking: I don't even know where their parking garage was so this was nice:]

Nice view depending on your room.

The monorail goes RIGHT by so your in luck if you don't want to worry about driving.

They have nice restaurants as well as a Pizza Hut and some nicer small stores but the spa and pool area aren't much to be desired.

NO RESORT FEE!!!!! That's definitely a bonus when looking for a stay around the Strip.


OVERALL: This is a great place to stay unless you are picky and come to expect certain things from a hotel. You can find more convenient places to stay and I would suggest The Tuscany Inn:] Two blocks away from the crazyness of the strip and a VERY low price for way better rooms than the LVH.",DefBwAnBgqdqZpiiNXhU6g,1,0,3,CBnu_hVkCKmCOH-fRYB4_w

I left the iPod in the sheets unknowingly, and when we checked out, I must have left it there.

They sent someone up to look for it, but it was nowhere to be found, and housekeeping had already been through there.  It had not been turned in by housekeeping.

I don't know how many hotels hold housekeeping accountable, but they were never able to find out who took it.  Some housekeeping person has a very nice gift now.  

Bummer.  As for the hotel, we find it to be a good deal, so we stay there occasionally.  It has decent restaurants and lively hallways.  The rooms are clean and attractive enough.

As with most Las Vegas hotels, the moderate cost of the room is countered by overpriced services and restaurants within the hotel. For instance, Wifi costs $14 per day.
The only real issue that we had with the hotel was that they misinformed us about the hours of their pool. Telling us that it was open from 8am-9am, when in fact it opened an hour later at 9am. Not a big deal, but it was annoying to get up early for one last dip before a late morning plane flight, show up in hour bathing suits and sunblock, only to be turned away with no explanation.

Location: Great. Just a block or 2 from the Las Vegas Stip. Not uch traffic, though paring is a bit of a hassle. I wold enjoy it better if there was a connection from the lot to the hotel.

Walking in, I did like the hallways, the decor, and lighting, The location of the elevators is just around the corner frm the Front Check -In Desk. The Front Desk was very helpful and that's always a plus.

Hote Room: At first glance I thought this room looks amazing. A very busness type room with a little desk for those on business, with a jack for internet. I think the hotel would be eve etter if it offered WiFi service. The dressers were roomy
BED: The sheets were amazing, comfy, the pillow were plush and great. The bed however, for a remodeled hotel, seemed very old. And you know it was old when you lay in it your basically in a dip.
Bathroom: the bathroom again was no where near remodeld. The tiles on the wal were as old as I am. The shower head and water knobs were basically handging off becuse the sealant was possibly old. Not to mention I could not get the shower water to turn off....just kept running all nite.

Casino/Resturants: Casino was avrage thouh service was slow. We ednt to Benihana for dinner, and for such a resturant with ridiculously hgh prices....the foods suckd and i paid money for nothing...tisk tisk

Primarily this is their preferred hotel because of the sports book.  That is really the only reason to stay at this location in my opinion.  The rooms are decent and well maintained particularly for the price per night.  One positive is of all of the monorail stops this is by far the most convenient in proximity to the hotel lobby compared to other hotels on the monorail line.  This last visit will be the last for me personally for several reasons.  The casino is certainly one of the smaller and is 95% slot machines, no longer has a poker room and the restaurant choices feel more like a budget hotel in Orlando than a Las Vegas resort.  

The biggest problem we had was security.  We had a laptop stolen from our room the last night we were there.  The more troubling aspect was that we had another friend in a completely different floor of the hotel have their Ipad stolen as well.  Management essentially said there was nothing they could do and offered a free breakfast buffet as consolation.  There was no offer to attempt to offer the smallest of effort to resolve the issue such as reviewing key card access to the room for example.  

One night I left my key in the room and requested a replacement key at the front desk.  The room was registered in my friend's name but I was listed on the room.  I spoke to the front desk and they agreed to have security meet me at the room since they would not issue a new key since I wasn't the registered guest in the room.  I went to the room approximately 4 minutes after they said security would meet me.  The security guard flippantly told me he was about to leave because I was taking too long.  He could not have been waiting more than a minute which I found to be a bit rude considering I wasn't a drunk blathering idiot who had done something absurd.

It had been 7 years since my last visit and on my last trip I had inadvertently walked between 2 craps tables through the pit (this time I was a drunk blathering idiot).  Security followed me around for the next 45 minutes after this minor oops moment which I found a bit overboard considering I wasn't exactly casing the joint.  I find it ironic that they deemed a simple walking mistake to be a bigger concern than their staff actively stealing items from the guest rooms.

One night I realized upon hitting the lobby that I had left my phone in the cab.  Within 3 minutes of realizing this I asked the front desk if they monitored the cab line with security in hopes that I might have them review the tapes so I could at least get the number of the cab I was in to hopefully know who to call for finding my phone.  Knowing full well that every drop of the property is covered by cameras I was annoyed when he dismissed my request by suggesting they don't monitor that area of the property.  Thankfully the cab driver had my phone and brought it to me in his own personal vehicle after his shift.  It would have been nice if the staff had been as concerned about our happiness as a random cab driver was.

The sports book staff was really the only positive experience I had during this and previous visits and unfortunately is not enough reason to return to this hotel.",CJUyDS3djrf0N6xYZoUcOg,2,0,1,RPvAWASkN5RNOwSNJrQl4Q

($69 to $99 per night) - depending upon the time of year and days of the week.  The staff has always been helpful and friendly!  The long lines for check-in are normal for many mid-range hotels, but still annoying. Also, I am a big fan of air conditioning, and sometimes I have to request to switch rooms as my current assignment was ""hot"". (they have always obliged and facilitated my hot flashes) Finally, I am a water pressure snob, and sometimes the water pressure isn't the best. That that happens...even at $300.00 a night.  Nonetheless, the LVH  has been helpful and accommodating regardless of my personal needs.  I would recommend the upper rooms in the north tower which are a premium.  Those seem to be the most newly renovated (with the best ""cool"" air and the best water pressure) Still a ""bargain"" as compared to most Las Vegas hotels.  Bonus....the upgrade offered at ""check-in"" for $10.00 a night are usually worth the extra expense.  Also..FYI...if you booked your room through whatever source, and are required to pay the ""resort fee"" (see the fine print) That gives you free wi-fi for one device per night.  YAY....savings.

1011659,2014-02-19,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"This was the worst hotel I've ever stayed at in Los Vegas, and that is saying a lot since I've been to Vegas 30 times at least in my life. 

Due to a scheduling conflict here in Vegas, this was really the only hotel that had availability. I'm going to write the review now while it is fresh on my mind.

First, I checked in to my room and there is a dirty towel on my bed and another dirty towel in the sink. I called immediately and told the front desk and they seemed to not understand what I was asking for. Obviously I want to change rooms, the woman seemed appalled that I'd want to change rooms over 'a towel' as she put it. Anyway, I finally got to my next room, and it looked like it had been cleaned. The carpet is stained though, so it is tough to tell. I had just sat down on the bed and then the door knocked for housekeeping, so maybe this room wasn't cleaned. I just ignored it and assumed someone forgot they got this room.

The bed is horrible. Has to be 30 years old and just feels like you're laying on metal. They make you pay for tooth paste instead of offering it complimentary. Of the 20 other places I've stayed at in Vegas, they're the first to do that. 

The food was horrible, I ordered room service pizza and it came fried to the paper plate that it was on, so I couldn't even eat it unless I wanted to eat the paper plate as well as they were melted together (the crust and plastic plate). 

Please do not stay here. Book early and get a decent hotel. This hotel is an travesty and the only decent thing about the whole property is the Sportsbook. 

Also, the hotel staff are likely homeless Las Vegas residents based on their demeanor, intelligence, and attire.",FTn8VjG0TrUPWWXlZ9uPmw,0,0,1,-u51rB06ayqF6NXI7QUfsw

This hotel is 2 long blocks and a busy street/intersection away from the northern end of the strip (which is pretty much dead most of the time and devoid of night life) and to get to the center strip is a good 20 minute walk (unless one pays for the shuttle metro which is $). For someone who loves to swim laps for exercise the pool was a huge disappointment for me as it is too small for such a large hotel and has no ""deep end"". Also, I payed $165 for  Friday & Saturday nights and would expect this place to at least include free wireless internet which it didn't. Casino floor was a bit underwhelming. Also, this place has no nightclubs or other night entertainment and the crowd tends to be older and a bit more blue collar. The positives were my room which was very clean, had a new plasma tv, and great views of LV city from the 23rd floor. However, next time I would rather spend $20 more/night and hit the neighboring Wynn or TI hotels on the strip.",__k22nFkfhlXyiMWJVSEHw,0,0,2,eO-UT44H-mPpyJxPtB5Z3g

I am sitting here, one hour after checking in, waiting for a housekeeper to come and clean my tub which came populated with its own pubic hair. The TV remote is missing.  This is my third room so far.  The hallways and floor have not seen vacuums in quite some time. Most of the doors and woodwork is worn (but not worn out).  This is not quite a three star unless you're in any of the new rooms.  They are prettier and newer- and are a $10 upcharge if you want them. 

Room #1: One of the old rooms. I will add the picture of the unknown stain to this space.  Bathroom was musty/moldy/gross.  Hair on bed. Visible indentations on clearly worn out mattress- even with the duvet on it.  

Room #2: Bellman brought keys and dropped them off then split.  I made my way ten floors and over a tower only to find that the keys didn't work.  Waited, standing in the hallway, for 15 minutes for new keys to arrive. 

Room #3: Lovely. Great view.  Except for hair in tub and no TV remote. At least the internet works.  The bellman who led me to this room was super sweet. I wish I'd gone through my checklist more throughly before he left but I was exhausted.  I found the furry bits when I leaned over to run a (well-deserved) bath. And the missing remote when I went to look for the ... remote. The guy who brought the remote and the lady who cleaned my tub were both super apologetic and sweet but I really just wanted to take a bath and go to bed an hour ago.

The Hilton is located off the strip but close enough so that you don't need a car (you can take a tram to the strip).  In general, it's less crowded and feels less hectic than if you were to stay on the strip.  However, the line to check in was super long (it looked like the line at Disneyland for the Matterhorn!).  If you're a Hilton Honors member, you can check in at the signficiantly shorter VIP line.  My uber-smart husband started out standing in the 45-minute long line, and as he was waiting, he signed up to be a Hilton Honors member using his iPhone.  Then he moved over to he super short Hilton Honor's line and got us checked in in a couple of minutes.   

We upgraded our room from the basic room and it turned out to be large and generically decent.  They also have more basic rooms which haven't been rennovated, and I have a feeling those rooms may not be as nice, although I never got to see them.  Even though we had an upgraded room, there were still a few things that were inconvenient.  For two nights in a row when I took a shower at 1 am there wasn't any hot water.  Also you can't set a specific temperature for the heating/air conditioning.  The view outside of our room was pretty dismal (a country club community that looked a bit like army barracks because of the wired fence surrounding the compound).

So lets talk about the casino first. The casino is great - lots of games and the casino staff is awesome. The pit bosses and the casino hosts are excellent. The dealers - well its a mixed bag. Some of them are VERY old and cannot even talk or listen properly. The rest were good and it was fun playing with them. One dealer in particular - Bob was kind of unpleasant and rude, but the rest were good. The casino hosts are awesome! Good job everyone, especially Jason Jones - you rock man, keep up the great customer service.I am sure you'll earn a lot of faithful customers with your service.

Now the hotel staff - check in was pleasant. But that's it!

The housekeeping service is the worst I have seen. Our housekeeping wasn't done at all (and Yes we didn't go green to save the $8) - the housekeeping lady said she would send someone (this was at 9 pm when we reached our hotel back). No one came and we slept as is that night. Now we needed towels the next morning so they sent it, but I wish they had apologized and done it the same night. The housekeeping lady was rude. Again, hotel staff, please provide some customer training sessions to the housekeeping lady or hire someone who's at least polite. Now when we were checking out, we were going to be delayed and requested additional time. The front desk lady said we would have to pay for half a day to do this. What?? That was ridiculous especially since the hotel was mostly vacant that day.

One nice thing about the hotel is that the train station is right inside it (like Flamingo, but even closer). There are lots of places to eat (I wish they could add Chinese Fast food though). The coffee shops and gift shops are nice but a tad expensive. I wish they could serve bottled water at a decent rate. The coffee shop has a small bottled water for $3.75 which is ridiculously priced.

It is just literally down the street and if you're a person who likes to go out while you're in vegas and doesn't want to spend too much money on a hotel, then this is the place to stay. I have to agree the outside of the Hotel it does need an update... Inside of the hotel, has a variety of slot machines and tables like any other casino. One time we got coupons with free accommodations and that was a plus or with discounted stuff we can use while we stood there. 

The only problem we had is when I went with my parents and sibling... My parents wanted a smoking room and we got a non smoking and we had to wait for a bit and the one with the non smoking I remember some things were broken in the room so good thing we switched anyways. It took awhile but, still was worth a wait cause our rooms were better then non smoking. Anyways I stood there this past december again with family & boyfriend and my boyfriend and I had no problems even the staff were nice as well.

I know this hotel is pet friendly but that means that housecleaning had not changed the sheets!  (GROSS!!!!)

Dinner seating at Benihana was horrible due to a lack of customer service and clearly a language barrier. This is Vegas people!  Learn the language of the land.  Dinner was good but after experiencing the rude hosts, I won't be going back. 

The next day we had lunch at the Burger Bistro. The host was courteous. We sat and our waiter was not interested in introducing us to the menu or how to order from their a la cart menu.  The food tasted good but we had to ask for refills since our waiter didn't come back to check on us. We later saw him, asked for our bill and had settle the bill with the host because he was nowhere to be found. As we were walking out he told us that we were supposed to give him the bill but we simply told him that we were tired of waiting for him to come around. He laughed it off and walked away. We let the restaurant manager know and even she didn't apologize for the lack of service. 

Now if none of this is enough, we decided to leave the hotel at 8pm the night before check out morning (16 hours before checkout time).  We patiently waited in the check out line and no one acknowledged us. Finally, there are 3-4 front desk clerks open and available to help clients, they look at us and continue to chit-chat amongst each other. I finally asked what seemed to be a desk manager overlooking the clerks on the other side of the counter if any of those available clerks had the capability to help us check out. He said yes and finally at that moment a clerk invited to help me at her station since I am openly complaining about the lack of assistance. I tell her I need to check out, give her my room keys and she tries to hit us with a $50 early checkout fee. I had to remind her of the feces-stained sheets and then she waived the early checkout fee. I couldn't believe it! I didn't ask for a discount or comps and this Nasty hotel is still trying to hit me. You would think that I could check out early since it would allow them to clean the room (assuming they clean it at all!) and rent it to the next person.

For the condition of the hotel they should charge half   LVH wants to be something but really it's nothing. Better would be Mirage, Treasure Island or most anything else unless you need to be near LVCC then it's your best bet.

Facilities are old as the hills ... since I've been here (2 nights), I've reported a broken elevator, an elevator button falling through the wall, and the fact that the rotating door into the hotel stutters and traps you every time you enter the hotel. Now that we've covered the facility, let's talk about the room - I've had to lift the lid on back of the toilet 2x to stop it from running, hot water takes a good chunk of time to start up, and if you want to take a shower be prepared for half the water coming through the shower head, and the other coming through the bath tub spout onto your leg. I've had to take the stopper out of the bathroom sink because it doesn't let water through, and I'm writing this listening to the drone of the early 1970's heater whirring behind me. Nice new branding campaign, but we're stuck in the 70's here folks. I'd highly recommend staying at Mandalay, the Venetian, or the Wynn rather than this place. Having said that, the staff is fabulous and obviously has put up with a lot - please tip them very well as it's not their fault that their boss' won't spend the money to upgrade the basic infrastructure!

PS - DON'T EAT AT ANY RESTAURANT HERE UNLESS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR OVERPRICED CRAP. If you are wise you'll go to Aquaknox in the Venecian and lay down some $ for some AMAZING food and service. If you HAVE to eat here because your famished go to Paradise Cafe, get the Greek salad (quite good and HUGE) and ask for Bobbi, she's great and deserves the $.

We made a pre-paid reservation for 4 rooms a couple of weekends ago. We were beyond shock when 3 out of the 4 rooms where still very dirty when we checked in at 10PM! Yes 10PM, meaning they had several hours of extra time to clean the room! And I mean, junk all over the floor, bed unmade, etc. It looked like someone had a party in the 3 rooms. At that point, we were already a bit upset but managed to keep our cool.

But then when we went to front desk to complain about the situation, we were greeted with extreme rudeness by the so-called lady supervisor. All she said was there's only ONE housekeeper available at this time and she's not sure what time she can start to clean. What kind of hotel would only have one housekeeper available?!!! 

When asked if there was another room that they can just move us to, she answered ""we are fully booked today. so NO! If you want, I can give you your money back if you dont want to wait!"". 

WOW!! No apology or whatever.. Just plain rudeness! So went and talked to the manager who of course said that he's never had any complaints about the supervisor who was rude to us. Of course he protected his coworker and just said the same thing to us. At this point, we didnt even want to argue anymore as it was late and we were tired.

I had no problems with the room, checking in, or checking out.  Everything went fine.  The remote control for the television could have used a fresh battery but it wasn't a biggie.  I just had to do the old ""turn the batteries back and forth"" trick.

The bathroom was renovated and had a contemporary design.  The tub was huge, but the shower head was low.  Great if you're 5'8"" or shorter, but at 6'0"", I had to bend down just a tad to get my hair wet.

My one gripe about the hotel is the buffet.  It was outrageously over-priced at $20.  Although that was the brunch price, and alcoholic brunch drinks were included in the pricing, the food selection definitely left me wanting more.  Compared to a standard buffet like the one offered at The Orleans, for instance, the Hilton's buffet was absolutely junior varsity.

I will probably never stay here again.  Parking was a hassle.  The parking deck was not connected to the hotel so you had to walk across two roadways just to get into the hotel.  Quite the design flaw in my opinion.  Valet was full each time I tried to utilize the service...another ding.

Upon arrival I was told there would be a $20/day ""resort fee"" for the use of the work-out room and the Internet. Since my employer had paid for my room I wasn't too upset. Upon arrival in my room, I found it over all clean (a few stains on the sheets) and comfortable. There were not very many free TV channels to choose from; basic, local news channels and whatever channel shows like 'Friends' reruns come on. When I tried to log on to the Internet it asked for a credit card number; I called the front desk to ask why since they had already run my card for the resort fee. They said it wouldn't charge my card, but I didn't trust them so I never used my laptop. There was no free coffee (cups in room cost $3.50 and water bottles were available for $4.50). There wasn't a complimentary breakfast and everything cost 2x what it really should've. The bathroom shower head was old and gross looking and the bathroom tiles had mildew on them. Saturday night my neighbors partied loudly until 4am and I got very little sleep making my meetings the next day hard to get through. I realize this is Vegas and people are here to party but they should've blocked off a floor for the conference attendees; this could be blamed on ALA as well. 
Upon checking out I came to discover that my card had been charged $150 (refundable) for any incidentals. I didn't have any idea this would happen and I was informed that the money would be credited back to my account in 3-4 days. Thank goodness I had enough in my account to cover this and all the bills that are paid automatically or this would have been an issue but I didn't like being surprised like this.

Only complaint was the low water pressure in the shower and the extra charges for cable channels you should have got for free. We used the monorail to get down to the strip. Joined the players club and received free tickets to their Rock the Vault show which was fun. We arrived early at 10am and checked in within 5 minutes. Staff was very friendly.  Really liked the swimming pool. Restaurants were okay for the price.  My friend won 70.00 on the nickel slots. They give you a food or drink credit every morning of 16.00 if you go Green and don't have them clean your room. Just remember to call before 1am to let them know. That paid for our morning coffee and bagel!  Bottom line...  If you want to feel pampered don't stay here. Go to the Wynn or other hotels like that but be prepared to pay for it.  LVH is no frills.

I have a couple complaints, but my major one is the bed size request system. When I booked the room, I had reserved a king sized bed. When I drove in from Santa Barbara (probably got in at 11:30PM), I was told that I would be having a Queen. This confused me as I had reserved a King. According to the hotel, it;s on a first come, first serve basis. Basically, regardless if I made a reservation  yesterday or months in advance like I had, if other people check in before me, I could not get a King. Personally, I think this is a crap policy. IF you reserve a King, you should get a king. We were only staying for two nights, and they said I could move rooms, but not that night, I could for the next day. We weren't going to get adjusted, pack everything up the next day, move rooms, get adjusted again, and then leave so we just stayed in our room. They didn't offer to compensate or anything. They only offered the room switch after I keep complaining to the management. And I wasn't the only one with this issue.

When I'm at Vegas I normally stay at MGM-owned hotel because I'm an mLife member, but this was the weekend of the Mayweather fight and it was also the first week of the NBA playoffs so I was bound to spend an arm and a leg.

LVH showed up on the HotelsTonight queue and it didn't seem half bad.  For a good price I ended up getting a very spacious corner unit and free Wi-Fi.  That's something you don't get at some of the best hotels at the strip.  While the room looked good, it was when I got to the bed where things got weird.

The bed in my room looked to be one of those that flips over to the wall.  While I have no issue with that, the gap between the mattress and wall had so much lint and dust that is quite scary looking.  Don't get me wrong, the bed was clean, but the upkeep of what was behind it was rather concerning.

And boy was this cheap, as in, cheap in every way. The room was mediocre at best. The floors had stains of god knows what and the bathroom arrangement was retarded. Only the shower and toilet was on tiled floor, the sink is outside in the carpeted area. It  was... stupid. The walls were ridiculously thin and you can hear EVERYTHING. My friend told us about his bad experience with LVH with the maids throwing away all of his stuff had me paranoid so we stuffed our belongings in drawers and closets as well as took pictures of them to make sure we have proof. Luckily nothing happened but I do not want to go through that ordeal of feeling unsafe.

Besides that, we actually got an upgrade from our standard room to Grand suite for $20 at check-in because they only had double beds left by the time we got to Vegas.  Our room was pretty sweet for being only $50 (originally we booked this place at $30 or so!).

My boyfriend and I are part of the Hilton Honor's program so we like to accrue points for free rooms, upgrades and rewards. 

The bathrooms can use a little updating - the shower and floor tiles were light pink.

They have the worlds largest sportsbook, several cafes, Benihana's, TJ's Steakhouse, gift shops, fast food, daily buffets, nightly entertainment, room service and great access to the Strip via the monorail. We purchased a couple 3-day unlimited access passes for $28/person. Way cheaper than taxis!

What was the casting call like for that gig?

They have mostly ridden themselves of the Star Trek Next Generation theme in one of their central casinos, except for the remnants of Star Trek I saw in the men's room:  Klingon images, and a spacey interior.

This recession has hit Vegas kind of hard, and it might partially be my projected negativity on the mood of the city while we were there for a trade show, but Vegas seems a little sad right now.

The air unit in the room is central & digital & works great. They have special walls that are built so the wall covers the top part of the curtain. That way you can sleep all day no worry of bright sun. 
You are able to look out but the sun is unable to beam in that spot , which causes over heated rooms. Not a problem at Hilton. They also use black out drapes.

1472601,2013-05-13,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I have very mixed feelings about this hotel.  I booked an air+hotel deal through vegas.com which came out to under $500 for roundtrip flights from NYC and four nights at LVH, which sounded like a great deal at the time.  However, I recommend you shell out the extra money to get a hotel ON the actual strip, not ""just off the strip.""  

The bad:
First, other than the gas station across the street and convention center next door, there is absolutely NOTHING surrounding this place except shady and cheap hotels.  The walk to Encore alone is about a mile, which although doesn't seem like much, sucks because of the Las Vegas heat AND the fact that from there you still have to walk so much to get to where the life is- Venetian, Caesars, Cosmopolitan, etc.  Cabs are so expensive and the group I was with would end up caving and shelling out cab fare every night to get to and from restaurants/shops/clubs and they are not cheap!  The hotel is definitely dated and could use a bit of a facelift, but it isn't terrible.  The food in the hotel is obscenely expensive.  They had a Keurig coffee machine in the room, but it was $4 PER SMALL MEASLY CUP OF COFFEE.  Insane.  I ended up going to the cafe downstairs (called Fortuna) and paying $4.27 for a large coffee.  More bang for my buck I guess.  I'd recommend going across the street to the gas station for coffee, but I got lazy and didn't want to start sweating first thing in the morning.  The hotel also offers a go-green option where you opt out of having your room cleaned in exchange for your choice of either an $8 dining credit or $10 casino credit.  Out of the two days we did that, we got the voucher only once and when I called to complain they would not honor it saying my room ""wasn't in the system"" for going green, which was complete BS.

The good:
The rooms were clean and a decent size.  We ate at the Benihana the first night which was good, it was a very big restaurant and the service was good.  There were always cabs outside so it was easy to get one.  There is a monorail station at the hotel too, which we did not use but what's the point when it doesn't service the strip?  We did not use the hotel pool until the last day and to my surprise it wasn't too bad.  The pool was a nice size and the bar had a 2-for-1 happy hour with good drinks and a DJ.",LYOvyedhKD3eqs4dJrp6yQ,1,0,2,9MrujBcteGk_AMZSGZmgoQ

My sister did, but I slept on a squeaky futon...not much better.  The breakfast buffet was not bad.  During the weekdays the hotel is pretty dead.  Then the weekends start picking up.

Again...like I keep saying.  If you're going to stay in Vegas without a car, you should just spend more on staying on the strip because either way you spend tons of $$ on cab rides.",A5S0h5ACmIfRQMLchv8XPg,0,0,2,uw33uUBU5mqvaziVO28WPQ

I checked in there yesterday and the place is a complete dump now that Hilton dropped their franchise in January. Maybe it is because of this.

The service right now it is rock bottom, particulary of one of the front desk staff (Jennifer) that has been introduced to me as duty manager (who did not even have a business card). I reserved a room with a king bed and the front desk clerk offered a room with two double beds. Or another room right next to the elevator. Both rooms are in the central tower. The worst of them all.

I used to get good treatment here as Hilton Diamond. Not even talking about the benefits that are zilch for me now after re-branding but I would say that as a repeat customer with over 10 stays you might get a slightly better welcome than this.

I ended up just using the room as a storage and staying at the Renaissance nearby which is a very nice and modern hotel next to the convention center.

The toilet wasn't even flushed! GROSS! The vent had dust bunnies and it just dirty. The shower head was small and the water pressure is horrible! I had to wash my hair longer than I had to.

I had high expectations for staying at the Hilton and was sadly disappointed.  Aside from having the reservation wrong, there were other minor issues and one major that really put a bad taste in my mouth. 

We were short a bed, and where they graciously provided a roll away at 'no cost,' they neglected to provide  a blanket with the roll away so we had to call housekeeping for one. Nice eh?

And coffee. I would have loved to have had a coffee maker in the room. But no. I called housekeeping and asked, but was informed I needed to call room service and they would bring up a coffee maker. For a fee. For a fee. Super 8 provides them free! Maybe I have too high of expectations.

Next morning, with no coffee in my system yet, I was ready for a hot shower. But no. No hot shower. Cold yes. Hot no.

We checked into the hotel in the afternoon, got to the room and the room was 'used' the bed wasn't made, the soap was opened a towel on the floor in the bathroom. We called down to the front and they upgraded our room and brought us up a key. Problem solved, late checkouts often cause issues so it wasn't a big deal. 

Tip for families, North Tower by North Tower parking garage, the rooms cost an upgrade fee but you don't have to trek through the casino and you're right by your parked car if you park there. The rooms are upgraded and easy in and out. 

The second time I stayed there, I asked for a room North Tower by the N. towert parking garage and they hooked it up. The room was nice, clean and quick in and out.

Compared to the horribleness of the service, the amorphous brown stains on the bed headboard were actually sort of quaint and somewhat art nouveau.  The fact that they brag that they do not charge the ""resort fee"" other places do, but then charge 14 dollars per day per device for internet (usually included in resort fees) was actually business genius.  

I would give this place zero or negative stars if I wasn't so impressed at how they conned me into staying here for 2 nights.  Bravo LVH!",4czmXgeRfZdwu8nwjgNHFw,6,3,1,mOhyoTQv-tyU8W5-ZFfJbQ

The good:
Great value and great location if you rented a car and dont want to be stuck in traffic every time you go in or out.
Good looking building with a lot of history behind it.Lobby and public areas (casino, restaurants) looked refreshed or new. 
Rooms are spacious and beds are super confy.
Staff is a major plus.
Buffet is pretty good for the price.
Get a room on a high floor in middle tower. You are close to everything and the views are amazing

The bad:
NO MINI FRIDGE IN ROOM. Major overlook!
It looks clean and shiny at first but they need to give it some TLC. And please oh please...get rid of those silk plants near the elevators, they look old and dusty.  But like I said of all of those older, similary priced hotel, this one has to be one of the bests.
Water and cofee in room is crazy expensive.

Fair views of the surrounding mountains and the Strip from the higher floors (we started out on 6 and moved up to 17). The ""Going Green"" program is a nice perk; you can get daily $10 food vouchers...however, the hotel restaurants are somewhat lacking and when Benihana is open, everything downstairs smells like shrimp, which is kind of gross. Convenient on-site monorail access. I did not use the LVH casino, so no clue how that fairs. 

My biggest complaints are these: 1) We were on a non-smoking floor where it seemed that EVERYONE was constantly smoking. I stuffed towels under the adjoining room doors and our room still reaked. Which brings me to... 2) There are adjoining doors in EVERY room...one for each room flanking you. There were 2 adjoining doors in our room and, instead of having keyed deadbolts, there were bolts that could be flipped from either side and a simple slide chain. Drunkards and doors to other people's rooms do not mix and it's rather unsettling when someone tries to open the door to YOUR room in the middle of the night...only to be stopped by the snapping of the chain. There are safer, more sensible ways to execute an adjoining door. 

Also, we had a split reservation b/c the first 4 days of our trip were on our dime, while the remaining 3 were being paid by my husband's company. Despite how extremely common this must be for hotels all over the world, LVH could not get it together and we were plagued w/ ""complications"" from this the entire visit. It was never complicated, the staff or the system simply suffered from a total lack of communication.

Overall, the LVH is a fine and affordable Las Vegas option. It's way better than ghetto places like the Imperial Palace, Bally's and Harrah's.

The line to check-in was really long. It took us about 45 mins to check-in. The receptionist was professional. He answered all my questions. He made sure we got one of the updated room since they are still remodeling the Classic rooms. The only bad part was he guided us in the wrong direction to our room. 

House keeping was working on our floor. So the hallway was full of linens & room service carts. Which seemed odd since it was already 10:30pm. Then again it's a busy place, so maybe they are overwhelmed with work!!!

Our room actually looks decent for the price. Compared to the old classic room, it's a big improvement. There are a few issues like the faucet keeps leaking. Some of the furniture is scratched up pretty bad. The bed is comfortable. Overall for the price it's a good deal. 

Some of the down sides. You have to pay for wifi per night per device. Since, I am paying the resort fees. I get one device connection. Additional devices is $13/night. The bottled water in the room is $4.00/bottle. The coffee is $3.25/cup. What ever happened to complimentary??? On the house??? We usually never have coffee in the room. Most of the times I carry waters & sodas, so it's rare that I drink the water in the rooms. Specially for that price here!!!

Away from Vegas, this would be closer to 4.5 to 5.  When you go to Vegas you get so jaded about hotels but then you have to factor in dollar for dollar, what's your value?  I'm sorry, but this hotel, you can get for around $25-$45 a night if you plan right.  Now, compare that to other hotels for the same price.  Driving in, I literally saw the Travelodge, a total hellhole, for ""Starting at $39.""  Um, a dump for more than I was paying for a very nice hotel with a dose of everything.  

You have to know what you're getting... this hotel is a far better price than where it sits on the foodchain.  At the top, you have your;

Encore, Wynn, Bellagio, Venetian.

Then...

Palms, Mandalay, Monte Carlo, Luxor, MGM, etc...

Then...

NY, NY, Circus Circus, Harrah's, Golden Nugget, etc.

And this is right where the LVH would fall in line, right between that group and the following type;

Terribles, Palace Stations... 

Then...

Imperial Palace, etc.

Now... with that said, look at the prices for the top hotels... and look at a dump like the Imperial Palace.  For the price of a room at the Imperial Palace, which is still probably more expensive, you get a really solid Vegas experience.

However, there are some things on which to improve;

IMPROVEMENTS

#1 - ELEVATORS!!!!  It's ridiculous, the waits.  The reason why is that not all of them are working at one time and they are extremely slow.  Better yet, some elevators, like the one in the Central Tower (floors 1-15), at the far end on the right... it'll literally reset all of the floor numbers on every floor.  Numbers are pressed... then they vanish... you press them again... next floor, gone.  Then someone will get on and punch a lower floor, you go all the way back down and start again.  It's just absolutely the most ridiculously easy thing to fix and, clearly, this is not a priority.  There are literally crowds downstairs waiting, like 30-40 deep, at all hours of the day and night.

#2 - The trash by the elevators.  Over the course of the weekend, we noticed the same overflowing trash can for three mornings... where in the hell was housekeeping!?  (Management, it was on the 14th floor.)  And the crazy thing is that when the elevator would go down and open on some floors... different smells would loft in from the various other overflowing trash cans.  People on the elevator noticed it before me but you definitely could smell it.  

#3 - Controlling the people.  With a mid-level hotel, you get mid to low level people coming in.  There were kids at a basketball tournament, dribbling the balls in the lobby on the nice floor... nobody said a word to them but it just ruins the overall vibe... like, if they did that at the Bellagio, they'd be dragged outta there.  


I really see and like the potential in this hotel... how awesome would it be if they could tidy up those details and still offer these amazing rates?  But dollar for dollar, you're not gonna find this much to do or this nice of a hotel anywhere near these rates.  It's easily worth $100 week nights, $150 weekends... so when I got a room for $25 a night and $45 on the weekend nights, it's a steal.  Regardless, they need to get those elevators going because that's what everyone will remember... people were livid.

I'm giving it five stars because I always look at the 'wow' factor per dollar, and it's a no-brainer.  It's not perfect here but it's far more value per dollar than basically anywhere in town.",vXSw50X6SurDHp8MpOSvjw,4,1,5,sHDiRA0y3O7SZ_SAzM890w
1915697,2014-08-28,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"The worst. We convinced my parents to fly into Vegas as apposed to LAX and we would get a hotel for the night and following day so that we can spend the day there. We weren't able to check in until 2am because they have never been to Vegas so they were in love sight seeing. We easily found parking on the 2nd deck of the parking garage and my husband was able to get checked in fast. We got up to the room and it was so dirty! Tub was filthy, dirty towels were still on the floor, sinks had gunk in them, tissue on the room floor and the beds weren't made. My husband went back downstairs and got another room. We went to the new room we got and again the tubs were filthy but everything else was ok. My parents decided not to even bother getting another room and didn't shower. 

The following day I realized I was missing my sons diaper bag and figured I had left it in my parents other room but since I was so stuck on the room being filthy and it was so late that I forgot it. My husband went downstairs to the check-in to ask if it had been turned in and they contacted security for us and luckily they had it. My husband called me down because security said I had to identify it since my ID was found in it. I went downstairs saw the diaper bag and was happy but when I looked inside of it all of my cards and papers that were inside of my wallet were dumped in my diaper bag. Immediately I searched for my wallet (which was Michael Kors) and it was gone. I told the security guy that my wallet was still missing and he didn't really seem to care but he still called back up the security upstairs to ensure it wasn't turned in separately. Security didn't have it so we were told to ask the front counter again. The front counter had already told my husband they didn't hold any lost and found. A nice lady got the Manager to come talk to us but he was even worse. From the start he kind of looked at us like we didn't belong and what I was telling him about my wallet still missing wasn't true. He called up to the room we were first issued even though we had already told him the lady at the front desk said she just issued that room out. Of coarse the other guest didn't answer. He then went about saying that it can take up to a week to figure out what happened to my wallet but he can take our number down and he would call us. I went on to tell him that I got that wallet for my first mothers day so it was more of a sentimental piece than us caring how much it cost. At the end he didn't show any care of trying to find my wallet which was in my diaper bag that was turned in. He saw all the papers and my cards that were just dumped in there but nothing. 

All in all I will not be staying here ever again. Two filthy rooms, the tv didn't work, I had to get behind the tv stand and saw that everything was unplugged. The 2 waters bottles in the room cost $4 each and 3.50 for each cup of coffee and the Manager was worthless.

Granted, the line was about 50 people long because it was just after 3...and check in starts at 3. I suggest getting there a little early. 

I was able to change my room to two double beds instead of one king bed which was nice. The room itself was clean, the beds were made well and the window had a nice view of the strip. The elevators weren't slow...but if you pressed more than 4 buttons at a time it reset and you had to re-enter them. The AC in our room worked so well, and I'm thankful for that. I can't sleep when it's hot. I was taken aback however by the lack of water pressure. It was hot, but I couldn't even feel the water hitting my head. The outlets were hard to find and difficult to get to, and the only one that worked really well was next to the sink. The other ones were far too loose. The beds were really comfortable though.

Also, the K-Cups in the room MUST work on a sensor. All I did was pick one up to look at it ($3.50 for coffee?! Are you insane? I'll go grab a real latte for that!) and when I went to check out they told me I had used one. Be careful of that upon check out! She reversed the charge for me.

I visited the hotel out of curiosity, primarily to compare Hilton hotel properties (Hilton has announced that it is terminating it's franchise agreement with this hotel at the end of 2011). I thought I'd stop in for lunch, on my way to other sites. Well, that was kind of a mistake. There is only one place, other than a coffe bar and a Pizza Hut, to eat before 5pm.

There are a number of shops within the hotel, including a couple of hair salons (chains). The casino contained in the hotel lobby seemed busy and I noticed there was a VIP area.

I haven't been in the guest rooms, so can't really comment on them. I found the lobby and restaurant areas dated in regard to decor, but clean.

This hotel is attached to the Convention Center, making is very convenient to anyone attending a large convention there. The monorail also makes a stop there, which is important because it's not exactly in the middle of the action on the strip.

First off, the room was very old with dirty carpeting.   The wannabe flatscreen TV was there as a fixture because its quality was horrible.  Internet connectivity was not free, but available for $13.99 / 24 hr.

Was here with my fiance for a Passion Parties Convention, and since it's more her show I got to spend most of the time free roaming and playing.

Firstly, I'll give this place a good rate on their service.  We got a nice bonus package to most of the places in the hotel, so I spent some significant time everywhere except the spa.  

The real downers were with the room itself.  Dunno if it was just my room's location, but the hum of machinery pretty much in the background non-stop was an issue.  We weren't near any of the elevators (service or other), and were high up enough (24'th floor) to not worry about any systems on the roof of the rest of the place, so no clue what caused it.

Also, while the room was fairly nice, but had to get switched out of the first one because of unknown stains on the wall next to the bed.  Maybe I'm a bit of a douche for letting it bother me, but odd colored spatters next to where my head rest tend to make me feel less pleased about my surroundings. My second room also had some interesting stain decorations in it, but these I didn't manage to notice until the morning I checked out.

Really, location didn't seem an issue to me. I didn't really feel the need to rent a car, and the monorail made for a quick ride to the strip when I wanted to wander. Came and left as a group, so we ended up taking a limo both ways to the airport, which made that trip fairly easy.

He was working at the conference center, hence the hotel choice. He drove in from LA and was much later than my flight, and the hotel was nice enough to be able to transfer the prepaid room into my name so that I could check in. 

We were on the 24th floor with resort club privileges- not sure what to compare this to, because the room was pretty generic. We got a letter listing our resort level benefits, including lounge access on our floor to have a light breakfast, snacks, and wine/cheese social in the evenings, which was a nice touch. Also included free fitness center access, which I'd researched upon arriving and balked about the $20/day access fee- which is insane considering what is actually available. It's essentially a room of weight machines, some treadmills, and three outdated ellipticals. I was surprised. Used it for what I needed and left, but nothing there was worth even half of that access fee for the weekend, let alone the day. Room came with printer-- but I am still waiting, an hour and a half later, for someone to bring me the cord to actually USE it. Housekeeping says they're still looking for it and to go to the business center instead. Will do, but not thrilled about it. Also, my partner was a little annoyed not to get the slippers/robe listed among our amenities. 

I'm not a casino fan, so I didn't evaluate that, but the giant sports screen at the Superbook was pretty cool. Didn't want to do the buffet, so went to Paradise Cafe instead on my first night alone. Date and I did the sushi bar inside of Bennihana's the following night.  Having access to the monorail was a plus.

The entire place has that musty hotel smell (I noticed in Las Vegas there are two classes of hotel, those that smell like hotels, and those that don't). The rugs are shoddy. It's far away from everything on the strip. The buffet is GAWD AWFUL.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that whole back wing of the hotel is depressing.

  * Had some issues with CC charges after my stay and the operator was very nice!
  * Good value for a hotel in Vegas

CONS:
  * Rude staff!! If you hate working there, LEAVE?!  From the front desk to the bars and restaurants, no one is friendly.  There is an exception as we visited the front desk and I wish I got his name, he was VERY friendly and helpful.  

  * Rooms are dated and need sprucing up.
  * No hot water the first morning...luke warm the next.
  * The coffee in your room is NOT complimentary.  Watch out...$4 for a K cup of watered down, weak coffee. 
  * Bathrooms need major cleaning as one room in our group had rusted out areas and mildew along the caulking.  Duct tape holding up lighting.
   *Benny Binion would be disappointed that they don't follow his vision of free cocktails while playing slots...only for table gamers.

2092375,2012-04-16,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I needed two rooms for Friday night with a short notice of two days, and was able to book one through bookit.com, with a great rate and was very pleased: rooms were spacious, clean, nice and classy. It's 3 minute drive away from the northern end of the strip and I think the value was great for the price.

However, there were several frustrations which all relate to the customer service and not the great hotel room itself, so therefore no more than 3 stars: 

1) when I went to check in, I accidentally stepped to a wrong spot (a priority check in line). There were no lines for usual or priority clients. So the lady who checked me in later, asked if I am a priority member. I said no, and she made me actually go around and enter from the lay people's side. 

1) because of the communication errors between bookit.com and LVH (the LVH system showed one day earlier arrival), the check in process took nearly 30 minutes. 

2) The lady checking me in was staring her screen with frozen eyes and not caring if she put me to a hold for eternity or not. In the middle of the process I asked how long it's gonna take because I had booked a dinner and did not want to be late. She replied, 10-15 minutes. Not an apology, nothing, even though I had already been waiting for 15 minutes.

3) The check out process was painful as check in, a lot of financial confusion. Even though I had prepaid through bookit.com, the LVH had put a charge on my credit card, more than three times a sum (and it did not free up until 4-5 days after the trip). Also in addition to that, the lady trying to check me out gave me two bills of 447 something per room, I don't even know so big numbers. I was like ""WHAAT"" and when I showed my papers that I had prepaid, then she gave me another paper to make these new bills void. So I was never charged that 2x447. However, a lot of adrenaline for that money paid. 

4) I wanted to pay in cash for a bottle of water ($4), because I did not want to charge it on my card (I used my European credit card for the hotel room and every transaction costs an extra money) . So the lady checking me out told me not to worry about it - I thought it was nice gesture. Sure enough, 5 days later I still saw a charge on my card. I know it's not a million dollar bill, but it was still frustrating, especially as I had asked twice to make sure that I could pay for it in cash.

5) I also sent the hotel the feedback and nobody replied. So their customer service seems to be virtually non-existent. It seems that they are targeting large crowds and making their money on the masses of visitors, not from the quality.

We get to the room and I didn't know what to expect. I was surprised. The room was big, clean well lit and a nice view to the pool. I definitely needed to check the bathroom, and it was super clean and nice. No complaints at all.

My room wasn't too far from the elevator and I did not hear a thing. Maybe because by the time I got to the hotel the best part of the night was gone and drunk, who knows I had a great time and no problems with my stay at this hotel

2116377,2012-08-17,2,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I would say this hotel is a solid 3.5 stars! I was a bit nervous after reading some of the reviews but it is definitely NOT as bad as people make it out to be. I wouldn't dare compare it to Bellagio, Palazzo, Wynn...or any of those top notch hotels but in comparison to Riviera, Flamingo, Imperial, and those type of establishments...LVH holds up for sure! I've lodged in some of the best and worst hotels in Vegas and I would stay at LVH again solely on the quality that is given for the price. My bf and I paid $40/night (Thursday-Sunday). Can't find that bargain at Imperial which is such a trashy hotel. The rooms at LVH are big, clean, and the beds are very comfortable. The North Tower has all remodeled rooms but of course they are more expensive. 

The hotel itself is not exciting but the Oasis club was poppin' on Friday night. They do have a HUGE sports book, the casino is not that big, and the buffet is a good deal. Checking in was flawless and they were friendly, I never waited more than 30 seconds for the elevators, the parking structure is very close to the hotel. There are tennis courts and the pool is cool. Happy hour every day at the pool from 4p-8p, dj spins, 2 for 1 drinks, and $2 shrimp cocktails...I had a blast lounging at the pool all day. 

Best feature would have to be the monorail...it's INSIDE the hotel next to the Oasis club and is very convenient for getting to the strip. LVH doesn't have much excitement within walking distance so it's cool to ride the monorail. Single ride is $5 or there are unlimited usage passes to buy. Who goes to Vegas to stay in the room all day anyway?...LIVE IT UP!!!

Tip: GO GREEN (opt-out of housekeeping) every day and the hotel gives you $5 for food or $10 for slot play each say you opt-out. Pretty cool...I don't need housekeeping just fresh towels and emptied trash. 

As a first-timer maybe a strip hotel would be better but as a repeat offender...I mean visitor ;) ...LVH is a good deal! Give 'em a try!",SdyD3VeFsrzeR6WoOhhq4Q,4,1,4,NtG4c4J3GZx3MwEFjlcGBA

The check-in not particularly impressive as they almost discourage you from the room chosen with an offer for an upgrade at an additional fee - feels sort of cheap and underhanded like a car rental up-sell. However, some great selling points were that they have a very cool wine bar and coffee shop called Fortuna. You can purchase a wine card, sample wine and choose which wine not only to dispense and try but allows you levels of quantity. Somehow the wine is vacuum sealed to preserve freshness...if you want details on this, ask an engineer! :) We had trouble with the Internet within the first hour and this was a slight issue because a document needed to be emailed prior to 5pm. After working with tech support and determining the issue was not immediately resolvable, the manager graciously upgraded us to a room where the Internet worked and the doc was emailed out just in time. This is the reason I give a 4 star review...great customer service trumps BS experienced and thus in my opinion trumps all.

The pool was large and the waitstaff at the pool bar were friendly. 

There are remnants from the Star Trek Experience on the first level, so if you are a nerd, that's cool. 

The Sunday brunch buffet was a decent value. $19.99 per person including champagne. 

The room was clean when we arrived, and all appliances/amenities worked well. 

It was a good deal overall. Its hard to complain when the room is so inexpensive. 

Cons: The Comedy After Dark Show was terrible. We weren't seated until after 10:45pm for the 10pm show, and the first two comics were ""meh"", and the host was loud and not funny. The headliner was much better, but I was exhausted by the time he came out. 

The check-in line was long when we arrived on a Friday morning at 11am. 

Wifi for $14 a day is ridiculous. 

The bar staff located directly outside of the Tempo Lounge (the bar with video poker machines built in) were rude and completely ignored me for 5 minutes before I walked away in search of a drink elsewhere.

Check-in to the hotel was something I've never witnessed before! It was 8:30-9pm, and the wait was roughly an hour/hour-and-a-half! Pretty nuts, but for my first experience of a hotel in Las Vegas & looking at the casino in the hotel (the scale of hotels here is ridiculous, just huge!)- plus the time of year of my visit- it pretty much made sense. So although the wait to check-in was long, we didn't mind so much.

Overall, service was great. Good clean rooms, good house-keeping & a great view from each room I visited. However, the room was non-smoking yet the corridor reaked of smoke which leaked into the room a little. In addition, the air conditioning in the room was so excessive, each night I woke up with an incredibly dry throat & mouth which was very uncomfortable.There was no manual control for it, which is why I've made this particular comment.

2160993,2010-04-08,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I have only stayed at three off-strip hotels in Las Vegas, Hooters, Hard Rock and the Las Vegas Hilton and out of those three, it is number two on my list. One of the best things about the hotel is the offers. For a couple of years now, I have been offered a deluxe room with six free buffets, two free drinks at a bar, discounts off meals and the spa and there are virtually no blackout dates for these offers. It is pretty hard to complain about spending $130 after tax on room and food if you choose to utilize all the free buffet coupons. 

The rooms themselves are not bad, but make sure you upgrade to at least a deluxe room. The last time I went I forgot to upgrade and went into the standard room and demanded to be upgraded. The standard room has the beds that seem very small, the bathroom that is really small and what is weird is that the room has HDTV's but none of the channels come in HD.  What drove me nuts is that they wanted to charge me for using their safe, which was so small that it could not fin my 13-inch Macbook Pro. 

The deluxe room is much larger, seems much cleaner, the bathroom seemed to be redone recently and I do not believe I was charged for using a larger safe but I am not 100% sure about that. 

The casino itself is not very large if you play table games, a little bit larger for slot players.  I have done well playing blackjack there very early in the morning, like between 2AM-6 AM but every time I play there during the day, I get killed. The dealers there are also very old school, some will joke with you and join you in conversation while others will just ignore the fact that you are there. 

The buffet is not bad, seems better for breakfast. They have an omelet maker on duty that will make a very good omelet and the French toast is also very good. For dinner, you have your standard options, meat, seafood, salad and Mexican. I do not remember seeing sushi, not sure I would have eaten it if I did. 

The best thing about the LV Hilton is the pool and cabanas. The pool basically has its own floor and it is large and the cabanas they offer are very affordable. They come with tons of drinks, TV's, chairs and some even have a little grass patch to hang out. The spa is also very nice, with great saunas, a small but nicely stocked gym as well as a variety of different hot tub temps.

One thing about the Hilton is that the valet parking can take a very long time, especially if there is a show at the theater. Even as a guest, it can take 30 minutes to park your car and if you want your car back during a show, forget it. 

Overall, the place is not bad, with the deals I receive from the resort, I cannot always turn it down but it is never going to be my first choice.",Bkc9GEDZgOFwI2C1ky3jhA,0,0,3,W5v5EEMJ2zhHHpBSfajC7w

Stayed here recently and I'm glad I did. I walked through a lot of hotel casino's of around the same price range and all the other places reeked!!! Its nauseating how disgusting the other places smelled! and they looked drab, old and sad! But the LVH looked fresh, spacious, clean, modern! 

It's about a mile walk to the main main area of the strip! but as a New Yorker 1 mile is nothing! so my chum and i walked back and forth constantly. But if you want to walk from the hotel and walk the whole strip to the end that is 3.5 miles while we also walked a couple of times! Taxi's are available everywhere for those too tipsy to walk back. Surprisingly the taxi's were very affordable unlike everything else in Las Vegas.

Anyway, the hotel is pretty huge! they have 5 wings I believe. I was in the central wing and i was in a standard king room. King bed, tv, drapes that open and close with a switch, a whirlpool tub that felt amazing! and it was pretty spacious. I loved having the room all to myself! I didn't feel unsafe at all in this hotel. If you can ask for room 2349! you wont regret it.

There's loads of restaurants in the hotel. Oh, a huge plus is that if you choose NOT to have your room cleaned in the morning then they give you a 9 dollar voucher that you can use in any restaurant/cafe in the building. I used it for breakfast and ate for free! So that's a nice option to have because who really needs their room cleaned every morning anyway? I certainly don't! 

you get free wifi for one device if you pay the resort fee which i believe everyone pays at check in. 

so, i recommend this hotel. BUT if you're not used to walking a lot and don't want to spend money on taxi's back and forth then don't stay here. but, for those who don't mind spending money, or walking then choose this gem!

No I'm not a Star Trek fan, but am a fan of grown adults dressing up, and nerding out.. lol 

We ended up going here Saturday after we ate dinner to check out all the people dressed up roaming around the hotel after the convention was closed for the night..

2221378,2009-03-23,8,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"We've all heard it... ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas""... drunken evenings that find us entering our hotel rooms in the wee hours of early morning... a trail of stripper dust and poker chips leading the way to a bed we're thankful is soft and plush... (and good for at least a few hours of solid sleep before doing it all over again)...until that Walk of Shame that leads us to the taxi stand and awaiting airport... 

So let me begin by where it started... 

My stay at the Las Vegas Hilton was certainly pleasant enough... it was the LV Hilton that we chose to book, since our arrangements were decided somewhat late and we were looking for somewhere nice but on the less expensive side and in close proximity (less than a $20 cab ride) to the strip or downtown. 

My room was definitely a good bang for the buck... I stayed on the 11th floor of the Central Tower... the room was large, with a king size bed... flat screen TV... and ample lighting both inside and out, with a large window overlooking the spa and pool below...the down comforter and soft pillows on the bed definitely made sleep time pleasant. The room was very clean and at $140 a night, priced right. 

There are plenty of small touristy shops on the main casino floor... and several restaurants. Saddening that the economy has had such a dramatic effect on Las Vegas and many of the casino/hotel restaurants are now closed between 2pm-5:30pm... making a convenient, late lunch a major inconvenience... if you chose to eat at the LV Hilton before dinner time then your choice is pretty much a personal pan pizza from the 'Pizza Hut' towards the rear of the hotel (meh) or to hop in a cab and head elsewhere. 

Good thing the Monorail does make a stop at the LV Hilton... and one way tickets are $5 to the strip... which depending on the hour, can be much cheaper than cab fare. 

All in all, I was satisfied with the room... upon checking out though it would have been nice for the staff to ask if I enjoyed my stay...but customer service doesn't seem to be a concern to unionized folks these days... oh well...

2259214,2014-04-25,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Do not stay here!!!! It is not even worth the twenty dollar a night rate. I booked this room on a whim due to a last minute decision to leave for Vegas early with a midnight arrival. I had reservations for the rest of the weekend at a four star resort so my stay at the LVH was just for one night. With six medical conferences this weekend many of the nice resorts were either sold out had nightly rates $300 above their norm. I should have taken the tips by many other fellow Yelpers to stay somewhere else. The LVH is run down, off the strip, and the clientele here is what you would expect for a $20/night hotel. HOOD RAT, HOOD RAT, HOOCHIE MAMA!  The beds are the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in. The shower drains slowly, and each time you flush the toilet you will be worried that it will get backed up. I was excited to see a Keurig coffee maker in the room but I was instantly disappointed because you would like to enjoy your in-room Keurig there is a $3.50 charge. I only give the LVH one star because of the lovely woman running the craps table. Her customer service far surpassed my expectations of this establishment. She was the only hi-light of my stay at the LVH. I am a Vegas veteran from Southern California and in all my visits I have never been so excited for the 11:00 a.m. check out time until now.  I will NEVER stay here again! At the LVH you definitely get what you pay for.",QurTb3172g57PAZtmANBRw,0,0,1,10ICsqCqu5bp_FaRZr5p-A
2280947,2013-03-20,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"My hubby and I stayed at LVH in the beginning of February 2013 as we celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary at our most favorite place in the whole wide world...VEGAS!!! With that being said, when reading this review, please keep in mind that we have stayed at many different hotels throughout  the years.  

After reading mixed reviews about this property, we were cautiously anxious on how our stay would be. To our pleasant surprise, this off-strip property did not disappoint us as it seemed to others. Of note, it seems most people tend to stay in the ""regular"", cheaper, non-suite type rooms so that may have made a difference between our stay and theirs.  Maybe we were just lucky or maybe others are just hypercritical, I can't comment on others' experiences with LVH. Either way, our stay was pleasant, comfortable, and very enjoyable.  We were treated to a North Tower Suite which totaled more than a 1000 square feet of living space with a beautiful view of the Las Vegas Country Club, where we played a round of golf at during our stay. Our room included a full-sized wet bar in our living room, along with a murphy bed and comfy chairs and couches, two full bathrooms, a king sized bed in our bedroom, two flat screen TVs (one in the living room and one in our bedroom), a desk where you could do some work if needed, and a refrigerator.  Our room, on arrival, was very clean.  Yes, the furniture in our suite was a little outdated for 2013, but one must remember that the LVH is an older property so it should be expected.  Despite the furniture lacking a modern flair, they were all in good repair, and most importantly, clean and comfy! We had no problems relaxing in our suite each night, as we had a nice and quiet stay.  

LVH has a unique ""Go Green"" program where they give their guests vouchers for either food or casino play for each day that you decline housekeeping services.  We thought it was a pretty cool program and took full advantage of it. Both we and the environment prospered from this! 

I enjoy my daily morning workouts before starting my day, so I paid to workout at their fitness center.  I bought the 5 day gym pass so it only costed me $15 a day to workout.  You get a discount if you purchase gym passes in a batch rather than a single pass. The more days you buy, the bigger the discount! The fitness center admission includes use of their cardio and weights, along with their spa facilities and an area to freshen up with lockers and showers that is stocked with lotion, mouth wash, hair spray, blow dryers and the like to pretty yourself out after your workout.  The spa areas are not coed.  I'm a runner, so my main focus for using the fitness center was for the treadmills and elipticals. They have about 6 treadmills and two elipticals. I also train my lower body so I used some of the weight machines as well. There is a water cooler in the fitness room so you can stay hydrated pre, during, and post workout. This is not the biggest or fanciest workout facility, but it serves it's purpose well, is clean and well maintained, and is not overly crowded so getting on a machine is not much of a problem. Basically, it is, what it is.   

Check in/out was seamless and quick and all of the staff at LVH are courteous, helpful, friendly, and professional. We were quite  impressed with exceptional customer service of the hotel and casino staff.  There is ample amount of parking and if staying in the North Tower as we had, the walk to and from the parking structure was minimal.  There are no resort fees at this hotel and the price you pay per night for a room here is a great value.  This is by far no Bellagio or Wynn, and they don't claim to be, but if it's good value, good customer service, clean, quiet, and comfy rooms that you're looking for, look no further, as LVH is the answer.  Give this property a chance and see for yourself what they have to offer. You may be a pleasantly surprised as we were!",bYLXrYkURZPDD5Ct3__B2w,0,0,4,qgzOQ8yul44U3SNg33x62A

It's a terrible hotel - the lobby is outdated and smells like cigarette smoke. I had to wait 20 minutes to get my luggage from the Bell Desk because they couldn't find anyone. It may be cheap to stay here but you get what you pay for.,fdd2pI7flsmzcpdlvc-6CA,1,1,2,P1BSE1dMLqx2Z8_kQyAaAw
2287722,2014-04-28,4,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"LVH was good to us. It's off the strip a little, which I appreciated because it's nice to be away from the hustle & bustle. My husband and I stayed here for a last minute birthday getaway for a weekend and I booked this hotel like less than 24 hours before our arrival. I was satisfied with the pricing and it totaled around $225 for two nights including the $40 resort fee (which is a dumb fee, but it's whatever). 

Check-in was smooth & totaled about 7 minutes. We got there after dark so the line was pretty empty. I was fooled & got excited because the service agent motioned my husband and I to come to this secret-looking back room for check-in. I thought we were gonna get an upgrade or something! Not so much, haha.

The room was pretty simple. We had two queen beds, a flat screen TV, and it was pretty roomy. There was a table and two office style chairs. The room was very well-cleaned and well-lit and we were satisfied. The bathroom, on the other hand, was a little on the small side and it's pretty cramped where the mirror and countertop are. The mirror and countertop actually sit right outside of the bathroom and in front of the closet, if that makes sense. We got a non-smoking room but the hotel as a whole still smelled like smoke. But it's Vegas so we weren't too surprised by that.

I can't review the casino, Superbook, or food because we weren't in the hotel much for any of those. We did eat at Vince Neil's Tatuado cantina several times though for the late-night Mexican food and $1 shooters, which were delicious and definitely a plus!

Our main gripes were for the confusing parking and the elevators. Both are really out of the way and are difficult to get to. The second day was smoother but still difficult to navigate through. 

I'd stay at LVH again. It was worth what we paid for and was nice for us overall!",pkJj-2GRCF5VUuQUTaBwZw,5,4,3,3bjfEGhGNQGJSn2NdcTpjQ
2290786,2012-07-31,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"This Las Vegas Hotel (formerly Las Vegas Hilton) has seen better days. I had read reviews of this property and had hoped to avoid getting this property with my bid of 4 star in the South Strip zone.

The issues with this property begin with check in. Our check in took approximately 1 hour 45 minutes due to under staffing of the front desk. Since this is an extremely old property the layout of the check in check out area is an a dark low ceiling section of the first floor and the claustrophobic feel of the area combined with the sour mood of the check in personnel and other guests leads to an exhausting check in ordeal which puts any visit to Las Vegas off to a bad start. 

Speaking of other guests, due to the fact that the Las Vegas Hotel is now heavily pushing for the lower end of the price spectrum you get a high number of less than desirable guests in the property, especially on weekends. Many of these guests have multiple small children who clog up hallways etc until late hours and make this a destination that adults really should avoid.

Finally the hotel has a free nightclub that is straight out of Compton. Unlike the exclusive nightclubs in Venetian or Wynn's for example this nightclub attracts a different clientele (since it is free) and  is housed in the former Star Trek experience location.  

Also be careful in the parking garage at night as 1 of 4 elevators is broken and 2 of the remaining 3 had broken lights and fans making for an unsafe condition at night.

One last note..this property is approximately 2 blocks south of the strip so keep that in mind if you are unlucky enough to be visiting Las Vegas without a car and or want to be right on the strip.

I never thought I would say this but it would be best to just book a low end casino like Stratosphere or Flamingo for example that is at least on the strip and have better security and clientele than to bid for 4 star in th South Strip zone on Priceline.",KlCccMr0jc69PE3KcboCvQ,1,0,1,OdYsYw4Bl1m3KKTPXsMaAg
2293462,2013-09-04,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I stayed at this hotel on Thursday 8/29/13 through Monday 9/2/13 for the Labor Day Weekend. Honestly, this is one of the best hotels you can stay in Las Vegas for a reasonably low price. My rates for thurs $24, fri $44, sat $100, sun $36, my total price including resort fees is less than $300 for four nights and five days. That's an awesome deal for me. 

PROS:

-Parking garage is the best in Las Vegas, it's not like a crazy busy maze full of crazy taxi drivers and drunk tourists who go 50 miles an hour in the garage. It's very spacious, quiet,  and empty! You can get parking space next to the elevators and walkways easily. My room # 23-110 North Tower is right next to the garage. From my room, I can get to the garage in less than 5 minutes.

-The pool area is big and spacious, it has the cabanas and a DJ, you can request songs for him to play and he'll play them right away, because it's just the right amount of people, not overly crowded, which means he can cater to all your favorite songs. I felt like a VIP.

-The room I stayed in was nice and clean, the people that say it's a horrible hotel must be those uppity types. TIP: ASK FOR THE NORTH TOWER, these are the newly upgraded rooms.

-If you stay at the North tower, the garage is a straight line, you don't even have to go through the casino dragging your luggage like a lost puppy. 

-You receive to 2 for 1 tickets to Raiding the Rock Vault for staying at the hotel, it's honestly one of the best shows in Vegas compared to when I saw the Cirque Soleil Beatles on Saturday and paid $210 for 2 tickets and was completely bored throughout the show. Rock the Vault plays  for 2 hours straight playing live rock n roll songs from the 60's through the 90s, the bands made up of guys from quiet riot, guns n roses, foreigner, and so on.

-You can lounge out at the defunct Star Trek space lounge, it's cool because no one there and you can take pictures of the bar and spacy lounges and sleep there it's so quiet and cold. Perfect on a hot day outside.

-The monorail is on the hotel, you can use it to sight see Vegas and tour the strip north to south.

CONS:

-The shower head is place a bit low for my height and I'm not tall (5'11), you kinda have to bend to shower your hair.

-The reception on the tv is not HD but just standard.

Definitely my favorite hotel to stay cheap in Vegas and get great value for your money.",7p1Joun9AodqBBJIo_4Amg,4,0,5,-G3LsaW2TX1M-em0E0FJsg
2296371,2012-08-06,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"This hotel was'nt too bad. The only two downfalls I found were the elevators and its location far down the strip. So here's the deal with the elevators. There was often times a long line for the elevators, a couple times the elevator doors would open and close several times before finally closing and being on its way. 

What I liked about this hotel is the pool and the restaurants. TIP make sure you bring sandles, your feet will burn on the hot pavement. The pool water was very cool, a bit too cold for my liking but that's just me. The Jacuzzi are was nice and secluded. The water was warm how I like it and the jets were powerful. Also the restaurants at the hotel seem very good. TIP make a reservation for Benihannas. The first restaurant we tried was the steak house. It was expensive so we opted for cheaper items such as the appetizers and sides. The lobster soup was amazinggg!!!! The shrimp appetizer was good, the shrimp were huge but it wasn't as spicy as the title makes you think it would be. The spicy crab cakes were okay, I like the ones from the cheesecake factory much better. And the garlic mashed potatoes tasted like regular mashed potatoes to me. We ate at the buffet twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner. Both were excellent and exceeded my.expectations. 

Also the monorail boards at the hotel which is very convenient!",5tm4CI-ags6mdXip-KEZRg,1,1,3,r0vxgsGhDXpCX1PjOxhAkw

Since my hubby and I were paying, we looked for four reasonably priced rooms. That's how we ended up at the LVH.

We booked three Premium Rooms (as opposed to a Classic Room) and one Resorts Club room. None of the rooms were as advertised.  

The hubbyand I got to the hotel first and checked into our Resorts Club room. Unfortunitly, that took a while, even though it was a slow night, since the desk clerk wrote down the wrong room number on our portfolio. Once we called down from a house phone and received the correct room number, we noticed that the room was not as advertised.  The room ws supposed to have plush,spa robes, complimentary water, evening turn down service and a daily newspaper. This room had none of that.  The room was tired, run down and in need of renovation. On the plus side is the Resorts Club Lounge where you can grab coffee, beer and wine and snacks during certain times of the day.

The kids all arrived at different times and each had difficulties with their Premium Rooms. One of these rooms had a HUGE wet spot in the middle of the bed. Like someone had poured a bootle of water in the middle of a King size bed. They had to call housekeeping to get them a dry bed. ThePremium Room is advertised as having a refridgerator. None of the three rooms had one. Two of these rooms had broken bath  faucets. One broke off in my daughter's hand and she wasn't able to turn off the hot water without help. The other room's bath faucet progressively leaked throughout the four days.

You can tell just by walking in the lobby that tis is not a fancy hotel in Vegas. No fresh flowers to start with. It used to be so nice......

**There is NO FREE WIFI!!!**
Do not be decieved! It costs PER device PER day!

We paid extra for a ""strip view room"" but all we could see was the monorail and the Rivera. Furthermore this hotel needs an update especially the room's bathrooms. The dim lighting and that 70's pink tile made my skin crawl. The casino is nothing spectacular but it has all the games. There is no shuttle service that runs regularly to and from this hotel and airport... so plan accordingly.  

There are a few food options within the hotel. We ate at the burger resturant. It's was again ""okay"". It was a bit busy but it only seemed to have 3 servers working so patience is key. We also ate at the buffet for lunch. There are a few good options.  The only plus to me was there was free beer and wine ;).
 
I am not very likely to stay here again bc of the convience of the monorail to better yelp rated, comparable hotels in the area is simply too good to resist.

Checked into room. Before entering, there was an empty glass right by our door. Every time we entered and exited, we always saw the same glass. We left hotel two days later, and still... same glass in hall.
The room REEKED of smoke. I called the front desk to change rooms. I was told rudely that the hotel was full because of a body builder convention. But they would call me the next day so they could change my room. They never called. I called them instead. They gave me the same excuse.
When we went to bed, we went to deadbolt the door. The swinging lock on the door was previously shattered in two. Unusable. Then my wife touched it and the device broke off the door and into her hand. I looked at the metal, and it had a clean cut, which means someone in the hotel, I hope, had to cut into the room with lock cutters.
The toilet didn't stop running.  The shower constantly had a flow.
There were empty bottles under the bed. 
The 24 hour coffee shop was replaced by previously prepared sandwich and coffee house. I had the last sandwich they had, 1am, and it was horribly over priced. No fries, no chips. Just sandwich in plastic container.

2396555,2008-12-14,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Stayed here during Thanksgiving weekend and took the ""Winter Escape Package on their website. You stay two nights and get a free one night in the summer. I took a room in the North Tower according to a previous post, these rooms were supposed to be newly remodeled. 

My room was on the 24th floor, which was convenient because the concierge lounge they have for was just down the hall, quick access for ""free"" drinks and snacks with upgrade to the gold room keys. I think I would not get this upgrade again, because we didn't use all the ammenities that came with it to make it worthwhile. When you are in Vegas you wanna go out, not stay in your room of a ""has been"" hotel.

The room was just of average quality, with a disgusting bathroom. There was BLACK MOLD on the shower curtains and bathtub grout. There is no ventilation fan in the bathroom either. The people at the front desk counter were unhelpful and said that all the rooms were full and could not move us... just got the feeling that they didn't care since it wasn't their personal problem.

Since we got the package it came with free buffet tickets. The buffet was a poor quality too. Food items did not get replaced quickly once that they were almost empty. Freshness does not seem to be important when creating their dishes. I am just glad I didn't have to pay for it, you can eat here if you do not care about what you put into your system and fill up. 

Next time I will spend a bit more time to shop around for better deals at other hotels, of newer/better quality. I just like the fact that this hotel has a Monorail stop. Although this hotel is taking steps to try to keep up with the competition, it still has a long way to go.",wLh4YepDaBzQ1JMrj5fDzQ,2,1,2,-Ttp9T8Bgk71ouYOZlnEzw

I don't gamble much so never get any comps at the casinos, but it is nice bieng able to acces sthe VIP line for the buffet.  If you are a hilton diamond member you have access to the VIP line at the buffet and VIP checkin line and VIP lounge even if you don't gamble a penny in the casino.

I don't normally gamble but i was just playing quarter slots while i waited for my roommate and my baby sister to come out of the restroom.  My sister is such a lame ass but she nagged me until i broke down and let her go on this Vegas getaway so i let her use my old Driver's license to go to the bar.  I swear if 2 different bartenders didn't check our ID's, she would've been thrown out! i seriously feel that i'm bad influence heehe.  Anyhow, i won $40 from the quarter slot but the machine malfunctioned and didn't pay out! I called security and they took care of it immediately and on top of it, they gave me 4 free passes for their breakfast buffet!!! YAY, free food! The breakfast buffet wasn't that great but it wasn't bad food...i mean come on, after all...it was free :)  I can't believe they even gave us 8 free drink coupons too!  The room we got was pretty nice, it had fresh carpet,  a 40"" flat screen tv, and a fully stocked mini fridge which of course i wouldn't suggest taking anything out of since items in this mini fridge was expensive.  The valet guys there were super nice too.  The registration line was kind of long but it moved pretty quick, like within 15 minutes we were in front of the line waiting to check in.  The atmosphere is not really catered to young people but it wasn't an unfriendly place.  Seems like all casino staff were pretty nice.  Out of all the times i've been to Vegas, this time it seems pretty dead for a weekend.  Must be the economy.  Anyhow, i went to their TEMPO BAR & LOUNGE and although it wasn't one of those super busy or nice bars, i liked the fact that it was low key and not soo intense.

First off the food choices were great. On the weekends they have Champagne Brunch's, under $20 for all the delicious food you can eat and endless mimosas can you say winning? Also tried their new burger joint, the burgers were great and so where the crab cakes and nachos.  

Really enjoyed the pool was actually pretty nice, wasn't your packed out Vegas pool party but a great place relax and take in the sun. The also had a happy hour with some pretty good drink specials which is always a plus

As for the room, I thought it was pretty nice, plenty of space, comfortable beds and a gorgeous view! One thing I really enjoyed about this hotel was that it was smoke free which was great as a non smoker when roaming around the hotel.

The one disadvantage was its is not walking distance to the strip (Expedia said it was), so we did have to take a cab or the monorail to get to all the Vegas action. None the less still had a great stay here, didn't think it was bad at all.",pOjgCTg0sXvGVcJETxcq5g,3,1,4,ZlE-o8ati4mpuDcQ6USCnw

2482779,2009-08-18,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"This place needs to be imploded.  And if it weren't directly connected to the convention center, I'm certain it would have been imploded (or sold and renamed some third rate dump casino).

While walking in, the bellhop didn't even attempt to greet or otherwise assist with baggage.  Upon check-in, you're given the choice to upgrade to a ""renovated"" room for $20.  Problem #1.  So right away, they're taking away from your experience by saying ""well, if you're not going to spend more money, you're getting a less than stellar room"" ... Gold/diamond level members get the renovated room.  They didn't have a single bed, and the staff was unwilling to offer us a nicer room to get the room we had booked. Staff was lacking in general, I think they know they're working for a dump and hear it all day long.

After examining our first room, we found it to be pretty dirty.  I wouldn't have wanted to walk barefoot in that room.  Outside of the 1982 pink Formica tile in the bathroom, there was a stash of pubic hair on the floor.  A carpeted bath mat (gross).  The lamp shade was ripped in half.  Everything about the place felt like a low grade motel.  After finding the pubic hair, we called at 4am to complain and the next day we got upgraded to a renovated room in the East tower (2575).  It was nicer, but still below any other modern hotel's quality in Las Vegas.  I would call it ""partially renovated.""  DNA on the desk chair.  Also, the tub leaked so there was a stream of water across the floor all day, every day (a real waste in the middle of a desert!).  The place smelled strongly like sewer gas every time we entered the room.

The buffet is DISGUSTING.  And for $18 for brunch, not worth it.  Actually, if it were $8 I probably wouldn't go back.   Most disgusting, low grade food you've ever seen.  Everything is cooked to a shrivel and sits out.  Eggs benedict were inedible.  Super low quality everything.  Patrons that aren't smart enough to not leave the tongs sitting on the food (gross).  The only redeeming thing were the crab legs (snow crab though, not king).  But really, how many of those can one eat before you feel sick?   Only fake HFCS iced tea.  They have no club, so gold/diamond members get the buffet for free in the morning.  I felt so dirty just sitting there eating the food.  I'd classify the buffet quality to be on the level of Old Country Buffet, at best.

The casino is so-so, mayyybe on par with other dive casinos.  It's smokier than just about any dive casino I went to.   There's not enough of a border between the hotel and casino; the second you set foot in the hotel door you're encased in a stench that you won't not smell until you leave the premises. If you're staying there for a convention and not to gamble, this is probably annoying.  The crowd in general is older on average, nobody young purposely goes here.  The only time we spent gambling there, the power went out for a brief second and the slots rebooted mid-play.  The nearby Riviera (the closest casino to the Hilton--a 10 minute walk or so)--is just as old but smelled 100 times better and was a much younger crowd.  The sports book room is pretty nice--it's huge with projection TV's (though it needs an HD update).  Still a fine place to bet on some horses while getting free drinks.  Their roulette minimums were $10, when other comparable casinos would be at $5 or less minimums.  No rapid roulette.  Pretty sad that the minimums here were the same as the minimums at Wynn.

The Wynn/Encore are probably a 15-20 minute walk, and since you'll be looking for excuses to escape, probably a walk you'll do several times.

What's sad for the Hilton is their food pricing is about the same as Encore/Wynn's, yet anyone who has been to Wynn/Encore knows everything about those two places STOMPS the Hilton.  Hilton actually had the balls to have a page of appetizers on their room service menu where everything was $21-29 for a quantity of 6.  6 jalapeno poppers for $25.  6 chicken wings. etc etc.  Are they insane?

They nickel and dime you to death, more than just about any other hotel chain is doing right now.  $14 Internet.  No free water.  No free ""if you forgot"" toiletries.  No free business center.  They even charge $5-10 to accept a Fedex package for you, that's just insane. They charge a room service fee $2.50 *per person* 

There's no reason in the world to stay here, unless forced to because of a convention where employers require it.  Still though, there's a newish Renaissance on the opposite end of the Convention Center if you're needing to be close to the convention center.  Outside of that, there are much nicer hotels with much cheaper rates (i.e., MGM).

They're promoting that the building is 40 years old with posters and free T-shirts.. Guess what guys, AGE is not something you should be bragging about.

2485453,2009-12-02,3,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I'm seeing a lot of 2-star reviews for this place, honestly it wasn't that bad. It wasn't my choice to stay here and it probably won't be ever again, but facing the facts the rooms are decent to nice depending on which part of the tower you get to and it's relatively interestingly themed and has some cheap drinks to keep you here even though it's a little distance from the main strip. 

They have some decent eats and great late night prices, plus cheap tables. It's almost like a compromise between having a mediocre hotel with cheap tables AND good food ... with good being a ... relative term ...

Anyway, the only thing I have to complain about is that the showers are really weak and it takes longer than usual in a hotel to get hot water PLUS the shower steams sooo easily that its hard to take a shower with the bathroom door closed. Other than that, they have some great deals sometimes so it's not bad if you're driving to Vegas.",EiwxlbR8fb68lMgEXhcWKA,4,1,3,Epj6nI_laQMPFaBNin9ARQ
2502847,2011-11-23,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Just got back from Vegas and took a long, hot shower.  No, that is not me being influenced by Las Vegas' seedy underside; and it's not only because I was achy from the drive (although--man I forgot how long it is).  It is because I stayed at the Hilton and cannot vouch for the cleanliness of my surroundings.  Let me rewind.  When we arrived, I couldn't find much to complain about at first.  Check-in was quick and our room on the 25th floor was attractive to the eye.  The off-strip location was set away from the clutter without being isolated, due to its onsite monorail station.  But there were a few things that were bothersome.  Like the way the carpeting is so old in the casino that the smell of smoke just hangs on everything.  Like the fact that wi-fi was $13.99 a day (the reason I waited to write my review).  Like the fact that the room was lacking other common amenities, like a refrigerator and updated thermostat (although the former may be common in Vegas, due to the fact that they are trying to get you to spend money on going out to eat).  Or the fact that our sink backed up.  Or the irritating flourescent tubes right by the vanity mirror.  Or lame T.V. channel choices.  But still I was hedging on whether all these items earned the place a downgrade to a three--after all it *is* an older property.  But then my husband's cousin had to wait two hours for housekeeping to clean his room after a backed-up toilet situation and after calling twice for follow-up--they had to have different people come by for different purposes (one guy to plunge, one to mop, etc.).  Hubby actually had to walk down to the front desk so that one of their managers could talk to one of housekeeping's managers.  The three rating was confirmed.  And then my seven-year old (sure, it's a family destination) noticed the bitten-up pieces of cheese on our carpet in several parts of the carpet.  Ew.  That means they don't vacuum the carpet.  Definitely a downgrade to a two.  Sorry, but I expect basic cleanliness to give a hotel a three.  The lack of amenities is perhaps understandable given the low cost of the room; but the basics should never be overlooked.  Not my worst hotel experience (see my review of Naniloa Volcanoes Resort in Hawai'i)--but I expect much, much more from Hilton.",aCLc72gpsf8zbdayft5vtw,2,1,2,jyXKhdmeIqwpLK3TQjFHhg

Wireless internet.  be CAREFUL when opening your browser and paying for wireless service.  Make sure you use LVH Cox. or the wired connection cord in the room.   I made the misfortune of just paying and assuming it was the internet service of the LVH.  Instead it was some bad provider from Vancouver with crappy signal

My wife and daughter came from los angeles halfway into this business trip since she has family in the henderson area. I realized i couldn't expect my wife and child to stay in this room, so i went downstairs and asked if i could upgrade my room. When they answered that i was already in an upgraded room, i briefly died from choking back laughter, and then asked to be upgraded to a suite, which was an extra 55 dollars a night, and this was the experience:

There's no fridge, there was one in the cheaper room. The emergency exit sign is a laminated sheet of printer paper literally screwed into the wall. There appears to have been a shootout at some point in history based on the location of several large carpet stains located at the door, sliding window, corner, and foot of the bed. I thought someone was jackhammering outside the room until i found that the noise was coming from the air conditioner. The 3"" of dust covering the air filter did little to dampen the sound. The shower was awesome, huge and had like 14 shower heads, which dispense either an arctic ice blast or hot magma straight from the center of the earth at your choosing.

First the good:

1. The rooms are very large for Las Vegas. They have plenty of room to spread out and a nice, big bathroom. The beds were very comfortable and had these great chenille nap blankets on them. Also, instead of those nasty bed spreads they had down blankets, which is always a huge improvement.
2. The monorail station is SUPER close to the hotel. At the rest of them, you have to walk 8 miles to get on a freaking train.
3. Has a ""skywalk"" to the convention center. This may be the longest sky walk in the history of humanity, but that little bit of AC sure is a lifesaver in the middle of the afternoon.
4. I saw Barry Manilow getting on the elevators one night on my way back from dinner. On second thought, not sure if this a plus or a minus.
5. What we ironically dubbed ""Asian World."" Its Disney's Asian pavilion from Epcot stuck into your hotel with the world's largest Benihana. Pretty cool, but also deeply odd.

Neutral Depending on your Opinion:
1. GIANT Barry Manilow poster on the side of the building, Barry Manilow store inside, ect, ect... you get my point
2. SO MANY FREAKING LOUD slot machines. So, so many.

Negatives:
1. Mediocre staff. They don't try very hard, but they don't actively act rude.
2. Rooms need some updating. While they are large, the carpets, drapes, ect could have used a freshening.

With a Hilton Honors membership, you get free access to the health club (otherwise you have to pay a fee), which is a bonus if you wish to exercise.  The workout area was not that big but it was sufficient.  The spa is very nice and the pool area is nice, too.  For the price, I think this is a very good hotel choice, despite being off the strip.

I was so amazed at the service that we received as well as the open suite model that we stayed in.  

The only reason that I am not giving the hotel 5 stars is due to their club scene.

The one big draw back of the Hilton is the Buffet. It's not that big and the food is alright. Although you can get better food at another buffet, it's alright. Their fine dining restaurants are pretty good though.

The spa is great, the staff is friendly and personalbe. They are also reasonably priced and have many addtionaly amenities. They offer a range of massages, facials and body wraps/scrubs. There is a small gym, wet and dry saunas, a steam room and a jacuzzi. Very relaxing.

The casino is not that big, but the staff is very personable. You don't have to wander through miles of slot machines to find the pit.

I think most of the rooms have been renovated and at least have flatscreen TVs, refrigerators and a safe. Not the fanciest of rooms, but who comes to LV for the rooms? Hop on the monorail ($24 for 3 days unlimited) and take it to the strip. It runs til 3AM Fri-Sun so you can take plenty advantage of it. The coffee shop is kind of expensive for what it is and not impressive. Six of us agreed the best thing there were the onion rings. The deli by the sportsbook isn't bad if you're craving a sandwich. Benihana is always good. We didn't try the fancy schmancy restaurants here so I can't speak to them. So why 4 stars, you may ask? Well...it's the best deal for a room in Vegas if you're not getting comped. Here's what you need to do:

Call the LVH and get transferred to the Players Club. Sign up for a card over the phone. You might need to be transferred to them by the reservations people, but they'll do it over the phone. Now that you have a card, you can book the better rates even though you've never even played there. I've successfully booked 3 nights with a bunch of free crap (buffets, drinks, spa, etc) for $155 total a number of times over the last year; you can get these rates for any night of the week, weekends included. You can get the same price for 4 nights without the extra crap they give you if you don't care about that stuff. Don't be persuaded into paying extra for a strip view over the phone. When you check-in, try the $20 trick (google it if if you're not familiar). High rate of success using this here between me and friends. Also, you can press a button on your hotel room phone to ""go green"" and if you forego a room cleaning, they'll leave a $10 voucher under your door that you can use for food anywhere in the hotel, This is awesome...so your second night there, take your voucher with you and go grab a free sandwich at the deli...you know you're gonna be wasted and have the munchies when you get back from wherever you're coming from.",8dOqtvJubv4nUcl04XFU1w,4,0,4,xBVgZMsmN2BFmiA5z0Slow

Going during the height of convention season, it was close to the Convention Center and the price was right. When I went to check in, I was immediately asked if I wanted an upgrade to a newer room for an additional $20 a night. No thanks. But I would like a room with 1 king bed as requested, not 2 beds as they offered. No problem! When I checked into my room, there were 2 beds... not a big deal - at least I had another bed option. One was so lumpy, I can only imagine that it had one of those egg crate foam mattress toppers - you know, to sop up all those bodily fluids. I opted for the one that had a huge lump in the middle, making it an uphill battle to stay in bed all night. Now, I've seen those news shows that go into a hotel room with a black light and it illuminates all the nasties... so I never go barefoot in a hotel room. Ever. Good thing, because walking across the stained carpet, my shoes stuck to the surface in some areas. Ewww!!! The light bulb was burned out in the only lamp in the room. The bathmat, while most likely clean, had a huge black stain on it, which in my opinion, warrants a replacement. The bathroom,  overall, felt a tad dirty. Grout needs replacing, the fixtures in the shower were loose, the shower curtain had seen better days. And what was that yellow stain behind the door? Hopefully I'll never know... If they were giving away rooms, I'd never stay here again. The only plus was that the customer service woman refunded my ""resort"" fee (I used quotes, because really, can we call this place a resort?) The internet never worked in my room and that's really the only thing the fee was good for for me.

When I first arrived , after I had booked a room in a month advance, I was told by the check-in lady that our room had a lot of"" noise."" when I asked her she told me is right by the elevators. I did ask her ""why is it noisy? Is it because of people getting on and off the elevators?""
She then replied ""no sir I am NOT talking about people getting on  & off the elevators. I'm simply stating that there is noise due to the fact you can hear the elevators because it's located near the elevator shaft.""
This was not a good start........
We go to eat at vince neils (motley crue)restaurant cool place, very nice. However the service was not that great after a wedding party of 14 people showed up. My girlfriend had to complain and they gave us a discount.
Also other guests receive coupons with discounts for the restaurants we did not. 
Next thing I was not too happy with was when I placed a bet on the Oklahoma City Thunder vs Memphis Grizzlies apparently there was a point spread but the girl at the front desk did not make it clear. She simply asked over or under? Over or under? When I asked about the bet in greater detail she  simply said well you have to choose an over or under period. I was not very happy with her knowledge or her customer service skills.
We ate in at TJs Steakhouse. We had what we thought was a coupon from the front desk. The lady said it wasn't but that we could redeem it after checkout. Comes down to check out day the lady at the front desk said that it was not in fact a coupon. This led to further dis-satisfaction.
There is also a  free picture that we could take in the front lobby set up. we get a printout and frame. However when we went to take the picture they informed us that a voucher is needed as well. So we would have to go to the front desk to get the voucher and they would not take the picture of us until we did so!
Getting on and off the elevators we were asked several times by the same sales dude"" hey are you coming back to Vegas hey have you checked out? Hey would you like some discounts?"" We weren't very happy about being harassed.
Overall I must say that I've stayed in worse but I've also stay in a lot better. Usually the staff is very helpful especially when you are spending money in there casino and gambling. I received none of that from this casino. I know it is in a location next to the convention center.

2829227,2011-01-25,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I always stay off-strip in Vegas unless I can find an equally good deal at one of the South Strip hotels. So when my friends booked a room at The Hilton I wasn't concerned. We knew we would be using cabs or my car for everything anyway.

The hotel was nice enough but I REALLY wish the parking garage was connected to the hotel because during the cold nights (or hot summer days), lugging everything from the garage, outside in the chilly wind (blistering sun) to the hotel just seemed like unnecessary torture. Not to mention that the garage is VERY far away from the lobby. 

Our reservation was lost somehow so they ""upgraded"" us to a view room. I'm not sure what view they think is good, but staring at the neighboring Hilton tower and a sliver of boring North Strip is not a view. The other side of the hotel, and our original side apparently, overlooked the mountains and the real Vegas. I would have preferred that.

The room was spacious enough for 3 females and it was clean. Nothing special about the rooms really. If you are in Vegas to relax, you might enjoy the large shower/tub combination with included cushy bath mat but I personally don't take baths in hotels. It just grosses me out. The beds were comfortable enough and were great for the few hours we spent on them.

For a cheap hotel, it is really a shame that there weren't any $5 blackjack tables. We didn't gamble at The Hilton and opted instead to travel to Tropicana, Excalibur and the Orleans to get our fill. Circus Circus and Stratosphere could provide you with $5 blackjack tables if you just want to walk. 

We ate at the buffet to use our two free buffet passes and I was actually pleasantly surprised. I couldn't eat a lot of the stuff since most of it appeared to be laced with gluten, but the salad bar was fresh, the fruit was fresh, plain rice and fish and even a carving station. Not bad for the regular price ($12.99 lunch) and even better free. On Sunday morning we ate at the Paradise Cafe but it was only okay and actually ended up being our most expensive meal of the weekend. (see other review of Paradise Cafe)

Then on our last day, a Sunday, I happened to be watching the boring Hilton Channel on the TV while willing myself out of bed and the best commercial came on advertising the Hilton Football Center. It is basically a football lover's dream theater. My friends and I had already planned to spend our last day watching football, but this was the icing on the cake. (See other review for details of the Football Center)

Overall, for the price it was a great stay. It isn't luxurious or conveniently located but with the special deal we received ($150 for 4 nights) it's hard to beat... and I'm used to the Motel 6 on Tropicana as my go-to cheap hotel. I wouldn't pay more than $50/night though. You can stay at a more conveniently located hotel Center/South Strip for that price.

There are numerous ""hospitality suites"" here during conventions and I came to one on the top floor in one of their ""villas"".

First of all, if you need to go the the convention center, the location is great. It's just one Monorail stop. About five minutes door to door. That's valuable if you've got an early conference, and you were out too late the night before,

And the proximity of the Monorail is hard to beat. Right out front, and you're anywhere on the Strip that you want to be. Get a multiday pass, and you'll save time and money on cabs.

It's old, but clean. And the staff is good.

You get Hilton Honors points, perhaps the best hotel loyalty program out there.

And I love the sports book. I've watched a few games there. They have a large number of friendly chairs, and the crowd is friendlier than many other spots.

Look, if you're spending more than $100/night, you're probably overpaying. I've stayed there for $60/night before. If you're cheap like me, it can be a good deal.",PWY4cs87ohRouHVCOuStkA,5,0,3,qT_f8aBSEH6GqUS2qFqXWQ

3032607,2013-03-17,2,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I came to Las Vegas Hotel after having issues with my initial reservation at another hotel during a very busy week where it was impossible to find a room anywhere in Las Vegas. Luckily LVH had a room for me. When I checked in, i looked around the hotel casino and lobby and you can tell the hotel is old. The shops are very 1970s/80s.Not a bad thing, just not what I'm used to seeing. 

Now this is where my feelings were instantly crushed, As i opened the door to my room and saw the disaster that awaited me. Dusty carpets that I refuse to walk barefoot on. The bathroom had broken and chipped tiles throughout the floors and walls. There was rust around the old tub. I didn't want to picture myself showering in it. The color of the rooms decor was very unappealing. There was a lot of that dark orange/ brown color happening. 
The next morning, I spoke to the front desk and mentioned the condition of my room. The front desk staff concurred that some of the rooms conditions are old so she offered me one of there remodeled rooms for an additional $20 a night. I accepted and moved my things to the remodeled room. My new room made a world of difference. Completely new bathroom, no rust, no dust, cleaner carpets, my view was worse but I couldn't care less after witnessing that scary bathroom in my first room. If you stay at LVH, ask for a remodeled room. It's worth it and similar to Venetian standards. 

Customer service is off and on here. Some employees are nice and some are very rude. The front desk staff doesn't smile much either. 

The fortuna cafe night staff were awesome. The hot chocolate here was yummy.  Not sure of the two girls names that work here but could have been Kim or something close to that. They were great! The morning staff were  the complete opposite. Rude, letting customers get in front  of customers ahead in line, causing unneeded commotion between customers . The morning staff all spoke in Spanish which seemed as gossip since there were many unhappy customers. A quick note to the Morning staff at Fortuna , Spanish isn't that hard a language to understand now a days so be watchful of what you're saying ladies. 

My experience with the room service was not good. I ordered a hot chocolate at 10 pm and didn't get it until 11 pm. One hour for hot chocolate must be state of the art cocoa, right? Nope! I waited 1 hour for some brown water which cost me $15.

My wife, her best friend and I stayed here while in Vegas to see Guns N Roses.  Rachelle checked us in and was totally awesome!  She was pleasant, professional and had us checked in quickly and efficiently. I would say it took no longer than five minutes to check in on a Saturday afternoon.

The rooms were really nice.  New interior, two queen beds, a comfortable couch, a chair w/ottoman and a desk.  After getting settled we noticed that one of the beds had a chenille bedspread and one did not.  I called the front desk and let them know.  Five minutes later there was a knock at the door and one was delivered.

The bathroom was clean but a little on the small side.  One person getting ready at a time is about the max.  The tub is certainly big enough for two.

I book online for 2 rooms with 2 queen beds each. We get there, check in, go to our rooms. We get rooms with 1 king bed each. Okay I guess this is a mistake, they can fix it right? Nope. We go back down to the front desk and tell them, and they have no other rooms available. Now let's step back for a bit. Why the fuck are these guys gonna even approve my request online if they don't have the available rooms? Why waste my time like that? I'd rather have them deny us service because of unavailability rather than LIE TO MY FACE.
Anyways, they say there's nothing they can do, it's late so we just deal with it. However, the front desk says that we can call for a roller bed for free because of the inconvenience. Alright that's cool I guess. We go up and call for it. Guess what. We had to pay. I tell room service on the phone that front desk told me it was free, then they make me hold for way too long I just give up. LIED TO AGAIN LOL! 
About 3 hours later I call again and it finally comes. Only one though, we needed 2...
So this place is complete bullshit, don't waste your money here.
Also buffet is utter horse crap, it's like ~$30 for adult and the food is old, stale, and not fresh. Crab legs are dirty and greenish. Oysters are obviously spoiled (you can tell by looking, smelling, or tasting them). And the shrimp is store bought and frozen. 
Last thing, elevators here suck. 6 elevators for 25+ floors and it takes 40 minutes to catch one. Not to mention that the down elevators sometimes malfunction and go up and vice-versa.

This year, we participated as exhibitors at the same Expo and because some of the partners in the company are older, we thought it more convenient to stay at the Hilton again.  Should never have cancelled the reservations at the Embassy Suites.

This was someone else's room, so I only saw the ""guest area"", if I can call it that. It consisted of a nice sized living and dining room, kitchen and bar with a big flat-screen TV, comfy couches. Since I've never stayed in a suite, I have nothing to compare it to. Al-in-all, it's quite alright.",I9e80hahLUuqyvM0ft3EdA,0,0,3,CiC-YCYidQbeFn46XbtbYA

Checked in on a Thursday and they did not have the two queen bed room that I reserved half a year in advance. They ended up giving me a room with one king bed. They mentioned that a rolling bed would be sent to our room in 30 minutes. After calling housekeeping several times and asking for the bed, they finally delivered 5 hours later. This was at 5 am in the morning. Who knocks on your door at 5am??? I honestly don't know what took so long. The housekeeper on the phone kept saying that they would be up in 5 minutes.

Other than poor service there are other problems. There are no good food options at night and the location is far away from anything decent. They know of this and will gouge you on everything. A beer at the cafe was $9. That's a lot more expensive than a beer at a 5 star hotel like the Bellagio. I will never stay here again and would not recommend LVH to anybody.

Luckily we stayed at the LVH just 2 days before the Hilton Honors privileges disappears, so we were still able to get a room upgrade to a high floor in the North Tower (the nicer tower) of the hotel.

The location of LVH was always a little disappointing, being just north and east enough of the strip to make walking anywhere on the strip impossible. LVH is the last stop on the Las Vegas monorail, but it's far enough that it's faster to just hop in a cab to get to the strip.  Although the hotel itself is still well-maintained on the inside, the lower prices of the LVH mean the crowd is dumpier than usual clientele of the expensive hotels on the strip. I say this because instead of seeing people in formal wear in the taxi line around dinner time, most people are in casual wear, often sporting fanny packs.

Check-in and check-out took wayyy too long. The line is parked in turnstiles like you would see at airport security or an amusement park.  The buffet was also rather disappointing, but because our Hilton Honors status was still recognized, it was free, so the price was certainly right.

3234472,2012-01-03,5,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Wow. I'm still stunned at my experience from this hotel. Normally I stay at the TI, or Venetian, Mirage, but since I waited until the last second, and it was four days before New Years, I went against my better judgement and booked at the Las Vegas Hilton (aka Las Vegas Hotel). Well the room was more of a 2 star room, adequate, functional, with a bathroom that resembled a motel 6 bathroom. They basically added a 400 dollar flat screen which qualifies as a remodel nowadays at these hotels. But why do I give it  a one star rating? Well we wake up New Years morning and my fiance tells me she has a bug bite on her hand. Which I  kind of assumed maybe it was from a mosquito, except there was two bites right in a row?? Well at that point guessed who came crawling up the comforter? I was the actual resident of the room! Yes, you guessed it. We were not alone in that bed, it was indeed a disgusting BED BUG  in search of dessert. When the Las Vegas Hilton says free meals, they should qualify that! I had never seen a bed bug to that point so I trapped the little guy in a glass and googled him. It was a bed bug for sure, flat, looks like a tick, a little bigger than I imagined. So I took him down to the front desk and asked the manager (Melissa) what she thought it was. Surprisingly enough she had a look of  bewilderment. ""I don't know...."" was her response. I educated her and told her its a bed bug, apparently she's never seen a bed bug before???? So then the hotel went into response mode, and told me security would meet me in the room. I went up to the room to meet security. 30 minutes later no security. I called back down the front desk, and RC  told me security had some emergencies to deal with and to call back in an hour. He graciously offered me a free buffet while we waited. So, not being one to give up a free meal--I took him up on his offer. It was interesting that on the reason slip for the buffet, he didn't note ""bed bug infestation"" it was noted ""leaky tub""--Denial?  Well, buffet---below average--sounds good in theory---but it reminded me of airline food back when they served it ""free"". So I returned to the room, and waited for security. As we waited for security two more bed bugs beat them to the room. (Apparently the good word is out about the complimentary blood buffet in room 457). I called again downstairs to RC and he says Lee from security on the way to investigate. Lee shows up shortly there after looks at the one we captured and the other ones crawling around (who knows how more there are that we can't see, as they blend in well on the brown floor and furniture) and calls down to presumably RC to tell him yes, there's a bed bug problem.  So let me cut to the chase, here's their solution. Since I'm leaving the next day is to move me to an ""upgraded"" room, which is basically the  same room, plus a sofa and a bathroom that looks more in like it had been remolded in the past ten years. Noticing that it seemed that this remedy was all that would  be offered, I went to the front desk to request a refund. I believed this to be a simple and easy request. Alas they did not agree. I was told to take it up with ""risk management"". Who is risk management? Dissatisfied I then left a message for the hotel general manager Joanne Murphy to call me. Two days later, no call, apparently this is how they take care of their guests.   

In speaking with RC, and JR, of their management (yes apparently the ones that talk to you only give their initials??) They stated that bed bugs are in all hotels, the Wynn, Venetian, etc). My response, was--maybe. But what's different about those hotels is that they seek remedies to satisfy their guests, not try to sweep it under the rug or believe a fair remedy is to feed their guests disgusting buffet food.

I have to go now, I have to dry clean these clothes to make sure there's no eggs in them or otherwise I'd have my own infestation!,

Ok now for the review. So we are in town for a convention and wanted to stay a few days extra to enjoy Vegas. Decided to book a few nights at LVH because there was a deal I couldn't pass up on a travel site. So we check in and I ask about an upgrade to a room with a refrigerator and was told that there was the newly updated rooms for $20 extra a night with all these extra features like in room coffee and the requested refrigerator. Then in looking at the site there is not much difference in the $10 extra and $20 extra a night. In room coffee maker, yeah my morning caffeine. Until I pick up the cup and read the lid.... $3.50 per cup used. I can get a venti coffee at Starbucks cheaper. Even the room service coffee was a better deal at 2 cups for $5.75. $18 a day resort fee and I have to pay $3.50 a cup of coffee and can only connect one device to the wifi connection. While I am not a big fan of resort fees, usually don't complain too much when I have coffee, wifi, newspaper, gym etc.However,  the resort fee here doesn't cover much and only seems to be an additional fee to increase their bottom line. Now even with the fee, It was a better price than the other hotels with a price of $38 a night for a Thursday and Friday night with major conventions in town. That being said I don't think I will be staying here again.

We booked the Hilton for a convention with a group of 12 or so.  We were spread out all over the hotel so many of us had good experiences, however, I did not.  

The first room I was put in did not have hot water and it looked as if it had not been remodeled since 1970.  After a cold shower I went downstairs and asked what the problem was.  I was told that it was the entire hotel and it would only be for about and hour.  I then met my coworkers for dinner and asked if they had hot water.  They all had hot water!  Hmm somthing didn't add up.

So the next morning I was still in bed and my roomate comes out of the shower furious because the water was still cold.  I went downstairs to complain so they switched us to another room that looked like it was from 1970 only this time there were pubic-looking hairs all over the floor and the bathtub faucet wouldn't shut off.  We were already late to work so we had no time to switch again.

When we returned from work the elevators opened and the entire floor was under constuction except our room which we were locked out of.  I called the front desk and the came and gave us a key.  We then asked about the running water and they said there was nothing they could do.

3293773,2011-11-27,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"During it's heyday, the Las Vegas Hilton was quite possibly the fanciest casino hotel resort not on the strip. Nowadays it's become dated, a ""classic"" Vegas establishment in hotel speak, and is a destination for nostalgia seekers, folks visiting the Las Vegas Convention Center next door, or simply people who are looking for a deal off the strip.

As a hotel, the LV Hilton is more than adequate. Standard rooms are all oversized and the beds are solid. While the rooms may feel somewhat antiquated for some folks, they've done a decent job of attempting to modernize the themes, though there is always more work to be done. The suite selection isn't as vast as some off strip properties, but there is some opportunity to enjoy a quality amenities, especially in the villa suites which feature a space as large as 13,000 square feet. If Hilton heiress Paris were to stay the night, I have no doubt those rooms would be her *only* choice.

The casino here is a total flashback to the early 1980s. They do have a decent and more recently expanded sports book, but most of everything from their table layouts to the slot machines scream old school more than anything. Their player's club program doesn't have much sell for casino offers and even the multi-tiered program isn't much of an incentive when the amenities simply aren't enough to match the nearby competing casinos. But in the same token, the comp rules are less stringent and the casino staff is accommodating and friendly.

My biggest beef with the property is their awful dining options. When their ""high end"" selection includes the dreadful Benihana (http://www.yelp.com/biz/benihana-las-vegas) or the laughable Asian fusionesque Garden of the Dragon (http://www.yelp.com/biz/garden-of-the-dragon-las-vegas), it's easy to take issue with the rest. The classic buffet served here is a real sight to behold, with bland food being managed by a real unmotivated bunch of service staff. Instead of the confusing options, I will see on occasion a crowd of tourists over at the Pizza Hut Express (http://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-cafe-las-vegas), but I suppose even they know what's up here. It's real sad when I'll opt for the Paradise Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-cafe-las-vegas) before throwing any additional money or wasting comp dollars on any of the aforementioned establishments. 

Though nightlife plays an important role at most casinos, this isn't much of a strong suit with the Hilton. Their pool attracts folks from time to time during the summer, but it's not much to write about. Tempo Lounge (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tempo-lounge-las-vegas) shows a little bit of promise, but the overly cheesy decor and crowd is a real detraction at times.

Many folks have been screaming for a makeover at the Hilton for years. Until the day it gets one, it will remain one of the lower tiered properties among Sin City's eclectic collection of casinos.",ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,10,4,2,REcAzV2fbylFD5W_KTXsWQ
3298455,2014-01-27,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"My wife and I have stayed here many times during the 22 years we've lived in Southern California and have driven to Las Vegas. It was, for a while, ""Our Place"" in Vegas, that is, until Hilton pulled out and the ""LVH"" took over. The famous staff friendliness and professionalism steadily dwindled and we found other places to stay and make ""donations"" to. 

Well, the LVH sent us a slew of marketing communications recently and we finally took them up on their 3 free night, with food comps and gambling free play. The first night, upon arriving, we were asked to stop at the parking garage entrance by a very polite security guard so he could ""grab some information off your car"", which he did so quickly, then thanked us and waved us through. No biggie, and when asked, he explained they'd had a rash of vehicle break ins lately (a good reason right there to stay away?)

Upon returning the next evening after a day out, we were signaled to stop at the entrance to the parking garage by a different security guard (name started with first initial ""D""). He never said anything to us, until I started to inch forward thinking he was done with his silent interrogation, then he blew a gasket. He escalated the confrontation until I finally lost my temper and decided we were done, and would exit the parking garage, upon which he yelled ""f**k you"" several times at me.

We went into the hotel and filed a complaint with the hotel manager and head of security, then checked out 2 days early and went to our new favorite property, who welcomed us back and comped our room

Needless to say, we'll never return and I'd strongly recommend you find other accommodations too. So sad to see this historic property run into the ground!",AYOaZIpp6tfoiCCrs3sldg,1,0,1,75rCSOXg0HenSkkViA28tw
3300348,2007-12-06,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Can't say I'm very happy with our stay. First they got our reservation wrong and then felt that they were doing us a favor by giving us a ""free upgrade"". The upgrade was essentially what we reserved minus a bed. When we realized we were a bed shy and complained to the assistant manager again they said the best they could do was to provide us with a roll away bed. The next day I spoke to the manager and he was gracious enough to give us $100 off per night.

The next morning we found that several of our rooms had no hot water. We called and sent someone up to fix but even still the water was never hot in some rooms. it was tepid at best. When I spoke to a supervisor this morning about our lack of hot water he basically told us that since we already got $100 off and the free room (the room we originally reserved) that was all the compensation we needed. Gotta love it!

We called to ask for a roll away and they charged us $30 extra, we forgot something in our car(parked valet) they wouldn't bring the car up front for us. We had to go down go to the valet station and wait for them to bring the car around. We asked for extra towels which, took close to an hour and they only brought us one regular size towel and a small towel. 
The bed was comfortable. The room has a flat screen, no iPod dock (we brought our own just in case),  the bathroom had one sink and I noticed there was no blow dyer. I didn't even bother calling and asking for one that would probably be another 1 hour, my hair would be dry by then. Maybe no resort fees means no customer service.

3320797,2013-05-16,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I've been coming to this hotel for the past 15 years (when it was named the Las Vegas Hilton).  I've seen some decline in the hotel over the years.  On my last visit, I noticed the buffet (average quality/above average price) is now closing at 8:00 PM on weekdays.  The SpaceQuest bar (previously a well occupied bar) never opened during the week I was there (Early May/2013). Staff is friendly but somewhat frustrated by the hotel's precarious financial position.  

The bottom line is this hotel is struggling to compete with the new properties on the strip.  However, the room rates are extremely aggressive (as low as 25.00 per night during the week) and the hotel definitely represents a good value.  The rooms are adequate and clean and I think you will be surprised by the value this hotel is offering.  Are there better places to stay in Vegas?  Certainly... but you will pay a lot more to stay at these other properties.

A few thing to note: Room service is ridiculously expensive at this property; i.e. $12.50 for Potato chips/$20.00 for breakfast.  Shower head is too low in the shower and motion detector in the bathroom shuts off the lights in the middle of showering (potential safety issue).",wBlrf8c9BdNRXrONkokfkA,2,0,2,mijxpi6x57UgDqfOyTtYAQ
3321705,2011-08-05,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"We were comped for the room, but I still feel like the hotel could have been much better. The common areas of the hotel felt really crowded to me, probably because a lot of people get too lazy to make the trek to the strip. I don't blame them...no one wants to leave an air-conditioned space in the middle of a Vegas summer.

The resort also feels really dated. The ceilings in the room are really low and the room was not exactly clean. The bathroom, in particular really shows its age and the lack of attention paid to the cleaning of the tub, etc. Kinda gross actually. The furniture in the room was also quite dusty. Not what we expected from a Hilton.

Unexpected plus: the bed gave us a good night's sleep despite looking lumpy. I guess that the housekeeper was in a hurry when making the bed.

We thought that we'd be fine staying off the strip, but ultimately the location of this hotel is less-than-ideal. It was hella hot, so yeah...no way we were gonna keep walking...the on-site monorail is a good option though...

There were no cups and it took an hour to get some.  The next day the maid took them all.  The maid service was very mediocre. No new towels.  It was a pain to park far out and drag a cooler all the way across two parking lots and the entrance.  It looks like they have let this place go.  The room was quiet and the tv worked.

3343045,2008-12-05,3,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"DON'T Stay HERE If YOU want TO have FUN!! Ok, so we stayed here over Thanksgiving Break, my family was visiting the area and we took advantage of their promotion for a room for 2-nights, inc. buffets and drinks. Well upon entering the premises, it is nice, good lobby they moved along at check-in, but when we requested a different room, they were so not helpful, in fact she was very curt and suggested that we talk to the casino host...YEAH RIGHT, that guy sounded like a bookie at the ponies, if you know what  I mean. HE did not help AT all...in fact he made it sound like WE were BUGGING him, just to ask a damn question. 

Anyways, on that first day we went to go gamble at the sportsbook bar, we were checking out some bets and games, the bartender was so rude, and tried to rip is off on some drinks. We went to Tempo another night and this bar tender had some serious issues, he was just freakin rude to everybody. I don't get it....I figured that they would be happy to have work and to know people are still patronizing Vegas...

Anyways, the buffet staff is really nice, helpful, but the buffet was very disappointing, the oysters still had shell and all over them as if they were schucked by freaking 5-year olds. The internet is a rip off. The room wasn't bad, but it wasn't the room we wanted. Overall, would never stay here again, and would not reccommend any of ye Yelpers to stay there either. 

Needless to say, on our second night we went to The Hard Rock, Bally's and Paris...all awesome and we had a lot of fun there!! Went to the RIo and my honey bunch won another $1000 at video poker...That made everyything better.......

Had to wait in line for 20 minutes to check in, and this was after we had been awake for 30+ hours after driving and setting up at the convention center.

We get to our room, and it is stiflingly hot. The AC doesn't work. Lovely. We try to open the windows. They don't open, just in case you decide to throw yourself out of them once you realize how bad this hotel is. 

The showers are cold. You are lucky if you get above body temperature. Great for waking up, if you don't want to pay their Starbucks prices for one lousy 12 oz cup of coffee.

We were on a non-smoking floor, however, which the patrons didn't do. However, the cleaning staff lit up in the elevator area of our floor.

There were four outlets in the room. One for the TV and coffee maker, but we couldn't actually access it.  Next was the light on the desk, which had a single plug in area. Next was the one next to one of the beds, which was looser than most of the escorts in the area. We awoke most mornings to dead cell phones. The last was in the sink area. But not in the bathroom. 

The rooms are incredibly dark. Probably so you can't see the stains on everything.

We were facing towards the mountains, so one morning I got to see a beautiful sunrise, but mostly because the curtains were lousy.

I'm disabled. Having to walk so far to get to my vehicle is beyond inconvenient. It's ridiculous.

3398063,2013-07-06,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"JUST SAY NO!  Where do I start?  Had to stay here for a conference June 29-July 3rd.  Although I was impressed with the size of my room, here's the scoop:

1. LVH charges you for EVERYTHING!
-$20.00/per day Resort Fee (definitely NOT worth it!)
-$13.99/ per day to use Wifi  (Really?!?!)
-$1.00/ per local call made from the hotel room phone
-$4.00 charge for using in-room coffee & maker
-$4.00 charge for using in-room bottled water
-$3.00 charge at the concierge if you would like to print out your boarding pass
*However, you DO get an $8-$10 credit per day for each day you call the front desk to forego housekeeping services as a reward for ""Going Green"".

I fear the future may involve charging their guests for each toilet flush as well....laugh now, but wait for it! o_O

2.  Hotel is DIRTY, dingy and dated (think cheap 80's brass & glass decor and orange/yellow 70's furniture).  Walls in hotel room stained, hair from previous occupant left in the bathroom and tub, pool and lounge area disorganized and sketchy looking.  Wallpaper peeling off walls in the Conference Center, mismatched and dated furniture, HIDEOUS carpet, yellow & dingy sparkly things (from the smoke) hanging over the casino, dusty and dirty throughout.  Everything including the ""non-smoking"" rooms smelled like OLD STALE smoke.  

3. In room T.V. is a joke -they charge for everything and what few ""free channels"" they offer are pathetic! 

4.  RUDE staff everywhere -not just staff who work at the hotel, but I had the misfortune of witnessing staff bickering and fighting with each other IN FRONT of customers at both the Paradise Cafe (waitress upset with hostess for not seating diners in her section and came up demanding, ""Can I get a party?  You seatin' people, an' I been off break for 15 minutes and I ain't got no party yet.  Can I get a party?!""  Then waitress complains to other waitress about hostess, and hostess gossips to other hostess about that waitress); cranky staff at Blyss boutique (cashier chewed out her coworker in front of me for 5-full minutes because her coworker was late to work and the cashier was going to miss her bus...)  

5. Restaurants:  
*****TJ's Steakhouse -Delicious!  Pricy, but worth it.  Definitely the only ""good meal"" I had while staying here! :)
***Benihana's -Overpriced and the food was bland and surprisingly boring.  
*Paradise Cafe -OMG, this was the only place open most of the time, so one of my only options to eat.  Definitely NOT good!  Greasy breakfast, over dressed Thai Chicken salad, and major egos and attitudes between all of the waitstaff.  They also automatically charge 18% gratuity to all orders ""To Go"", so make sure you keep that in mind before you start to add an extra tip on the tip line.  If you aren't paying attention, you could end up overtipping them (and the service is definitely not worth it!)

so the downsides...the cleanliness of the room was definitely questioned.  the fridge had old food in it...i found chips on the floor...made me wonder how clean was the rest of our room.  the bathroom was super dark.  the toilet was slightly illuminated but the shower was pitch dark.  oh, and the creepy door by the tv stand which connects to the other room...it looks like they remodeled the entire room but forgot to change that old school door with a chain.  haha.  oh, and they charge $13.99/day for internet.  but it doesn't look like they charge resort fees so it balances out.  

if you opt out of cleaning your room in the morning, you get a $5 certificate for food or drinks in the hotel.  you also get a huge amount of coupons just by staying there...free spa, free drinks, free buffets, free gifts, free show tickets...FREE FREE FREE!  

the casino was pretty sad...hardly any people there...older slot machines...very few tables...a couple of the dealers were really friendly...but i don't think i saw anybody win.  but who goes here to gamble anyway right?

But caught Next, they did great and gave a good show with all the 90's hits. The crowd was mixed but mostly black.  Guys had on suits and the girls were dressed nice.  The bar was too packed. That is my only complaint. 

We headed out by the pool to watch the fireworks.  As you were walking towards the pool people were handing out party favors which was nice.  Everyone was out there kids, older couples it was beautiful. It was chilly but it's winter in the desert.  

We went back in and heard some live Reggae man was it the bomb this crowd was multicultural.  Although they only played one more song another Reggae band came on and jammed. It was by far the best New years eve ever!  It didn't hurt that the parties were free except the 105.7 party. I didn't even mind that they had a cash bar.

the casino isnt exciting and glitchy like the ones on the strip but if you just want to do a quick gamble, there are plenty of machines and tables. we took advantage of the happy hour at the Vince Neil Cantina and also did some wine tasting at the Wine and Coffee bar called Fortuna near the main lobby.

The good:

---Check-in was quick, and our room was ready at about 10:00 a.m.
---The view is decent, considering you're not on the strip.
---Mattress was pretty comfortable.
---The rooms are fairly big, even the standard rooms.
---Most areas were very clean.
---It's right on the monorail, so getting to the strip was very easy.
---Average-ish buffet. I might have felt better about it if it had been a couple bucks cheaper, but what was there was fine. Just not a huge selection.

The bad:

---Internet access costs $14 per day, per device. In 2012? Are you kidding? Thankfully I didn't need it.
---The whole place feels dated--tons of white marble, brass and ""glass"" light fixtures, and a Star Trek theme in what had to be one of the sadder bars in LV.
---Really heavy smoke in the casino areas. The place needs better ventilation.
---Super flat pillows, to the point where it was actually more comfortable to sleep on my wadded-up sweatshirt. My chiropractor's going to get more money from me than the slots did.
---Our shower faucet didn't turn off all the way. I'm not talking a few drips; I'm talking an actual stream of water coming out of the faucet for four days straight. It took three calls to get anyone to come look at it, and when the ""engineer"" arrived, he said there was nothing he could do. Fab.
---Also, the showers are super short. I'm only 5'7"" and I had to duck to get my head under the water; my 6'5"" husband didn't have a prayer. No water pressure to speak of, either.

Overall: It's much less expensive than the higher-end places, and the fact that it's off the strip means it's a lot quieter. That may or may not be your thing. I appreciated being able to sleep (despite the crap pillows), so yeah, it was fine. Not sure it'll be my first choice the next time I go, but it was OK. Nothing great, nothing horrible.

I won't lie, the bed was actually very comfy. The pillows were extra soft. Bathroom, decent size. Shower head was VERY low. I'm 5'9, & I had to bend down when I washed my hair. Imagine my 6'3 dad? Pressure is also pretty low. Towels aren't the softest.

When she went to talk with the front desk, she was helped out by an older guy. She said that it doesn't work, & we're wondering why. His response? ""Idk, go back to the gym & ask."" Mom: WHAT? You're telling me to go back there, when he doesn't know & when I ask you, you don't know? My mom was getting a little irritated & walked away, & the guy replied with, ""WHATEVER."" Mom: EXCUSE ME?? WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?? Him: Room number? Mom: NO, don't say whatever to me..forget it..you're no help."" I called front desk myself later on that day, & the friendly lady on the phone apologized for it happening, & I wasn't charged for it. It was that simple.

When I asked, the girl said not a problem that she will be on the 7th floor non-smoking. Great! Now, back to Mon evening, Tiffany was helping us. Absolute WORST customer service possible. My sister gave her her info, & she said, ""Ok, so you're set on the 18th floor with JAMES."" UH WHO THE FUCK IS JAMES?! Why the 18th floor? I immediately corrected her & said, ""She's supposed to be in the North tower."" In the most sarcastic and smart ass voice, Tiffany says, ""That's what I said.."" Do not start with me homie. I said, ""We don't have a James connected to her room, & the girl yesterday said the 7th floor, non-smoking."" Tiffany-That's not what it says here. Me-Idc what it says, I'm telling YOU what your co-worker told ME."" Tiffany-Well it says James.. Me-THERE IS NO JAMES. Her: Well, you're on the 18th floor.. Me:She's not supposed to be.. Her:EXCUSE ME, I NEED TO SPEAK WITH THE REGISTERER. Go the fuck ahead, & yet she still got her info incorrect, & smartly said she was going to get the supervisor. THANK THE LAWD. He wasn't any better. He never apologized for the inconvenience, he was being slightly rude towards us as well. He said, James isn't connected to your room, but it probably got mixed up because of Expedia. That would make sense if we used Expedia, which we didn't. You guys are so unorganized! They also said that they don't pre-assign rooms. If you don't do that, I don't understand why the other girl at the front desk told me that info. It just doesn't make sense. Rude ass Tiffany came back, & never said a word to us. Didn't look at us, & just handed us the room key. I really TRULY hope she gets fired.

The room they gave my boyfriend and I had two full beds, because they ran out of rooms that had kings. We pushed the two beds together to make one big one :) No, we didn't put the beds back when we checked out... oh well, it was their fault. 

The only thing that really bothered us was the monorail goes back and fourth frequently, and it made sleeping just a bit hard. If you're not used to a lot of noise while sleeping, do not choose this hotel.

We had a room in the east tower and as soon as we stepped in regretted leaving the comfort of our other hotel.  Now that the Sahara is gone, this place epitomizes the old Vegas.  This hotel and its casino are frequented by the older crowd and it shows.  The entertainment and decor is as dated as the crowd.  

Upon entering our room, we noticed that it was large, but dim and dreary.  The carpet was clean, but badly in need of replacing.  As if from some sort hotel horror story, we also noticed that the bed was part of a fold-up unit.  I thought those only existed in 100 sq. ft. apartments and seedy motels.  The area behind the bed looked a little dirty, but no bed bugs.  Aside from that, the remainder of the room, including the bathroom looked relatively clean.  However, this might also be the most no-frills Hilton I've ever encountered.  Only the basics are available (shampoo, soap, lotion), and not even a tray for the soap.

The only good part of the hotel was the casino, which was small, but had low limit tables and friendly dealers.  The morning and afternoon gambling crowd is a little sparse and results in $5 blackjack tables.

The bad: It's so far removed from the hustle and bustle of the Strip. The monorail becomes your best friend if you stay here. The lack of electrical outlets in the room is an issue, there were what appeared to be cigarette burns in the rug by the closet, and the bath had a drip I couldn't quite stop.

- Friendly staff!
- You receive a nice coupon voucher for the shops. I didn't end up using any of them, but I think a few would have been useful (i.e., Pizza Hut Express, $10 match play, and credit toward gift shops).
- It's very quiet in the halls. You can sleep like a baby.
- Complimentary wi-fi (just for one device, though). 
- You can take the monorail from LVH to the Strip. Easy peasy.
- The Go Green program gives you an $8 credit per day to any LVH beverage/food place if you opt out of having your room cleaned (not counting arrival and departure dates). 

CONS: 
- I requested a non-smoking room, and my room still smelled like smoke. I sneeze an awful lot when I'm around smoke, and I'm pretty sure my neighbors thought I was trying to sneezebox. (Haha? Play on beatbox? No? I tried.) 
- No tooth brush available. Shouldn't this come standard?
- Water pressure in the shower is pretty weak. 
- Thermostat is definitely a prop. No matter how high you push it up, the room stays so cold you'll wonder if you're in a Coors Light commercial.

The pool is nothing fantastic, but again, it's not that bad.  And their cabanas are some of the cheaper ones around at $125-150 before 2pm and then they drop to half price.  They come with 20 non-alchoholic beverages in the fridge, a TV, and a safe so you can lock up your stuff and hit the pool.  It did take quite a while for a server to find our cabana, but other than that it was a good experience.  

They don't have a ton in the way of food options, and you're off the strip in a not fantastic location, so you have to drive/cab/monorail your way to just about everywhere.  Since they have a monorail stop right there, it's sort of convenient, but at $12 a day, it can get pricey for larger groups.

The property has been sold to Goldman-Sachs, who surely intend to flip it. A smart buyer will pick it up due to its location adjacent to the convention center (and on the monorail, making it convenient to all other strip hotels). Who knows what will happen then, it's possible they would tear it down and start over, so this review may be moot. 

Renovation was still under progress as we stayed there, which implies that they will keep it up, but our room was very good, and the renos were not intrusive. When the hotel was built 40 years ago, it was the largest in the world. Not it is the 15th largest in Las Vegas. This makes me suspect a new buyer will tear it down anyway. 

A few negatives; the track lights did not work, and the curtains were very hard to move. Walls were fairly thin. But the beds were great and the room was large (Grand Room). There were no bedbugs as has been reported in the past. We got a fantastic discount rate but normally in convention weeks the place is fairly pricey, you are paying for the convenience of the location. 

Be aware that the ""$100 in coupons book"" included with the deal is worthless. You have to pay a lot more than the coupon is worth to use it, and it was good only in their very expensive and mediocre in-house restaurants.

Upon leaving Baymont Inn due to unclear and or miscommunication with Baymont reps, hotels.com transferred my booking from Baymont inn which was $100 plus $50 deposit (credit card no cash) to LVH which was $79 plus $18 resort fee per day, they accepted cash and a waived $50 deposit which was a great deal to me because we had cash more so then credit! Anyways upon arrival LVH staff was very helpful, friendly, and explained everything thoroughly to my understanding. The rooms were in pretty good condition, pretty roomy, free wifi, free gym (i guess that's what the resort fee covers). The ac felt soooo damn good in the room, as much as i wanted to go swimming it was hot as hell outside, 115 degree desert weather, the sun wasn't just hot it actually stung your skin. Although I lived in Vegas 10yrs ago, I'm a brutha born and raised in Cali, so i like hot, but not when you have to psych yourself out just to walk outside or get into a car. The gym was coo for what it was, got my swoll on! I like the location of LVH because its right behind the strip and if you know Vegas you know the back roads is how you avoid the major traffic mess on Las Vegas blvd. But for the price, the customer service, the room comfort, its well worth the value in my opinion which is why i give it a 4 star.

We checked in at 8pm on a Thursday night. Definitely in a time crunch if we had to get to Tryst by 10pm. I unpacked all of my shirts to find some wrinkles in them. So I thought I would bust out the iron. It just so happens that I had one that did not work. I called front desk, and it took a good 30 minutes before the maid brought another iron up. They even went out of their way and tested the iron to make sure it works. How nice of them! I ironed my clothes and was on my way out and made my deadline.

Having stayed at the Hilton before, we knew exactly what the setup was. So getting ready and getting in and out of the hotel was a breeze. I m not going to review the room so much this time around, but give a little insiders point of view. Our last room did not have a flat screen, and this one did. So I highly suggest asking for one of the renovated rooms. It seems like the furniture in the room was newer as well. Overall size and lay out of the room is in the same.  Our room was located on the 22nd floor of the central tower. Rooms in the quite east tower are $15 more a night. 

Another thing people don't know about is the parking. Don't park in the designated lot for guests! You will be walking a mile to your room. I always park in the ""Sports Book"" parking lot on the east wing of the hotel. Make sure you don't park in the sports book VIP spot or you will get a ticket. From here it is about a 10 minute walk, instead of a 20 minute walk to your room in the East or Central towers. 

The service all around the hotel was very. We didn't spend too much time in the room to really notice. They were gracious enough to offer us coupons for the weekend. It included coupons for drinks at the hotel, and dining/ room service etc etc. We didn't spend any of them because it was just a little too pricey even with the coupons.  With our room we got a great view of the fireworks over by the Palazzo (center strip).  This was an added bonus.

There was one minor annoyance with our bath tub. The drainage definitely needed some work done because the bath tub water came up all the way to our ankles whenever we took a shower. It was kind of like a bath/shower all at once. Another problem was catching an elevator. It seemed like the elevator system was not smart enough to detect that it is a full load and would stop at every floor when going down. It took anywhere from 5-10 minutes to catch one single ride. 

Other then that, I would love to stay at the Hilton again. I don't expect steals like this, but as long as I get a reasonable price, I will be back to use the place as a mattress and a cooler bucket for my bottles again.  The Hilton Las Vegas is still fit for the King.",nTcMFBHZV2vPnig0XLk-Hw,4,3,4,1fvTpYyTz1Y9IJt2PQorzw
3862288,2013-10-04,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Upon my arrival there were only a few people standing for check-in but there is no front desk staff available. I could understand the wait if there was people standing around. Then, I was dragged into a room by a staff and instead of expediting the check-in, it resulted to being much worst. The  VOLARIS cabin crew are being checked-in at that time and the clerk too them a while.
The clerk that was to help me to pass to another clerk check in another group and she said ""OH I CANNOT MOVED BECAUSE I AM BUSY"".  She said this in front of the customer/guest. She cannot move her chair because of her size (no offense meant). She ended up moving to the front to walk around the table to go to her table to check me in while another customer was neglected ahead of me. So I decided to let him go first and for me to wait again.
I worked in the airline industry and deal with hotels for my crew and these crew check-in process needs to be updated. Way too long to check-in 5 crew members.

Went to my room, checked the room itself, asked to be transferred to another room. I checked the room itself and bed, found some hairs on the mattress. Toiletries that's was in the room is half empty. Is this a leftover of the former occupant of this room?

My bathroom lights were out, so I called the front desk and was put on hold for a while ending up hanging up and calling back again. Roughly I was in the hotel at 3Pm and it took like 3 phones calls for the bathroom lights to be fixed. One maintenance guy came at at 8pm to fix the light but I cannot let him in at that time so I asked him for another time.

Then I asked for extra towels, it never happened. I ended up the next morning looking for housekeeping cleaning up the room to ask for extra towels. I asked for an extra towel regularly for my stay not for just one day but it never did happen.
Every time I go the LAS VEGAS I use the SPA. I visited and check the spa and nothing comparable to the others. Expensive and the value is not worth using it. 

The worst part of my stay is EARLY MORNING 9AM. I went down to Fortuna to buy coffee. It was pretty busy but not that busy. I ordered coffee and a pastry. I was paying and this rude cashier wearing eyeglasses told me PER SE word by word in a very rude manner ""YOU HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT YOU ORDERED  BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ORDERED"". If I woke up in a wrong side of the bed this morning, this will be a long discussion. This cashier clerk/barista has a look that looks like she is just working and not happy at all with what she is doing, arrogant and rude. As, I walk the lobby every day and see her I had to do something about it. That was my first and last time I bought something from that store.

My room was non-smoking but I smell cigarette burning in the room. I don't know if it was a guest smoking or the ventilation of the room itself. I called the front desk, so the nth time, I was put on hold again, ending up calling again and again. They offered to be transferred but I decline because I was going to check-out the next day. Front desk promised to spray the room with something, but I guess when I came back, it never did happen.

Upon my check-out I decided to do something about the Fortuna Shop and express my frustrations.

3878203,2011-07-04,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"My Review is for the Men's Spa, not a hotel room.  I stayed next door at the LV Hilton Grand Vacation Resort.  Since they do not have a spa, or other venues, and because I was at a conference, spent more time at this property.

The spa was excellent.  The price was fantastic ($20 a day).  Men's spa has private steam, dry and wet saunas, 2 whirlpools and 1 cold plunge.  There is fruit, bottled water and tea available, along with ice-cold towels and great attentive service.  The furniture in the relaxation room could be updated.  I would also like to see less staff sitting around in the relaxation area, so that the guests can enjoy (this was the case every day).  Additionally, why the Hell is there a TV with movies, infomercials or games blasting?  A spa should be relaxation...most spas now have quiet ,soothing music with a multimedia of relaxation pictures on their big screen, not loud TV which only incites people, not get them in the ""spa mood"".  

Other than those two issues, this was a nice get-away.  I would gladly pay more for this spa IF the mood was more tranquil (see above).  If I return to Vegas, will be back to the spa.",kArrysWF7WW8GguLNEx9lQ,1,0,4,NIZUWJRXQzXTcRiasYlMnw

If you have the resort club level, you gain access to continental breakfast which includes fresh fruit, danishes, coffee and OJ in the mornings, and from about 6-8pm you have access to a beer selection that can include, corona,becks, budlight and even Odoul's (non alcoholic) *wtf?*.  The monorail is connected to the hotel and it makes it extremely convenient to travel down the strip sans the traffic.  One of the things I loved MOST about this place was the sportsbook deli.  Offering FRESHLY fried onion rings and burgers amongst many other things at a reasonable price at ALL hours. LOVE it.  On the flip side-- Some of the cocktail waitresses were literally  nursing home old, and others were in their early 40s.  The casino was usually pretty dead during the day, and the pool area was very basic and underwhelming.  All in all if you wanna come party in Vegas and need a place to rest your head, then a renovated room in this hotel is what you want.  $28 for a monorail 3 day pass (you don't have to tip anybody) and it's just all around practical.",E7dNhALfxoE5OcH0ybH0Sw,1,0,3,Pwl7aAu7_odZRknOBDJNZg

3921913,2013-05-03,4,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I came here expecting the worst. A friend of ours checked-in before we arrived to the city and told us how ghetto it was. Seeing the low Yelp ratings didn't help neither.

This hotel is located on the north end of the strip. The older side of Vegas. Even the sign screamed old! They really need to update that. There is a large parking structure and plenty of outdoor parking, but I would recommend parking in the structure since it'll be a lot closer to the hotel entrance. 

Checking in was a nightmare. There were tons of people trying to snag a room without reservations, which held up the line. Our check-in, however, was fast and easy.

The guy helping us told us there was only a double room available with a queen bed. No big deal. King beds are a bit excessive if you ask me. What's better was he told us the room we were getting is much larger than regular rooms. I was so glad to hear that, but was still doubtful seeing the atmosphere.

When we finally saw the room, I thought it was actually really nice! It was significantly larger than standard rooms. There was a little bar area when we walked in with a sink and fridge, a large living room area connected to the bedroom, and a good sized bathroom with a shower and jacuzzi tub. Not too shabby! We definitely lucked out on this one with the price we paid. 

Our friend's room on the other hand was horrible... It was ridiculously small and the bathroom was a sorry excuse for a bathroom. You'll definitely feel crammed if you have 4 people.

I didn't even bother checking out the rest of the hotel, but it's nice that they have a monorail to take you to the strip directly from here. I found our room very comfortable. Plus, if you opt out of room service they give you $10 in hotel or gaming credit. Be sure to call before 1 am, though (or it doesn't count). They'll slip the credit under your room door the next morning.

I recently visited for a girls weekend of shopping & shows and after reading previous reviews, was almost ready to cancel for fear we were booked in a dump.   Sure, it's off the Strip and it's a little older - but it has a simple, no-nonsense facade & the interior lobby is elegantly understated.  Blazing crystal chandeliers and white 'marble' floors create an upscale look around the front desk & hallways.  

We had a package deal - 3 nights for under $180 including 6 free buffet coupons & two 2-for-1 drink coupons at the lounge and an assortment of other coupons for the hotel's restaurants.

The valets are quick, the front desk was helpful and check-in was smooth.  We had a room on the 15th floor in the East Tower with an expansive view of...ok, nothing.  But we could leave the shades open and not worry about being woken up by the bright lights of the Strip at all hours.  The beds were posh - I counted 7 different pillows on each bed,  something I always have to request more of.  The bathtub was amaaaaazing...super deep and extremely wide.  It was made for luxuriating in after a long day on your feet  - ladies, don't forget to pack the bath bombs & bubble bars.  We had a huge flat screen tv and a bonus in-room fridge.  The casino was near empty every time we walked through it except for the sports/betting area.  Giant projection tvs displayed football, soccer, horse & dog races and the place was always packed.  

We ate at the buffet for on 3 separate occasions, one meal a day for our 3 day trip.  The breakfast/brunch buffet includes a wide variety - crepes, french toast, pancakes, meats, eggs (scrambled, poached, Benedict, omelet), fruits, cereals, breads, desserts & complimentary champagne.  The dinner buffet had Asian dishes, home style foods (like fried chicken, corn on the cob, green beans), crepes, prime rib & roast, crepes, salads, soups, the biggest bowl of shrimp I've ever seen, crab legs, more desserts & complimentary beer or wine.  Everything looked fresh and was kept meticulously clean.  And hello, complimentary champagne, beer & wine, folks!

We tried to eat at several of the other restaurants, but kept finding them closed (after finding them at all - Hilton might want to invest in some more signage) inexplicably either for the day or for the between lunch & dinner hours.  The coffee/wine bar was always open & had a selection of cold sandwiches & pasta dishes to tide us over, but it really wasn't a substitute for the giant platter of sushi we had a coupon for.

The main Lounge/bar in the middle of the casino was always quiet.  Perhaps it's off-season or people are just chilling elsewhere, but we never saw more than about a dozen people there which is a shame since the interior of the lounge had plush chairs & super-comfy couches.

Overall a very nice stay at the Hilton - my only quibbles being signage (a few more to the garage would be nice for self parkers), the near random restaurant hours and the $13.95 PER DAY internet fee.

I have to have a comfortable bed or else I am a cranky person. Needless to say I was a cranky person the next day with neck pains. When I complained at check out all she said is that if I had upgraded I would have gotten a more comfortable bed which cost 4k dollars... DUH why didnt I know that!!

4031738,2006-10-09,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"The Hilton is my favorite chain hotel.  No matter what city you're in, you will always be faced with a clean and well maintained room.

The Casino is small here but it has changed for the better over the years.  The gaming floor seems to have gotten younger and livelier over the years.  Though I still don't gamble much here, it offers all the games that you might find else where. 

The Sportsbook at the Las Vegas Hilton is truly amazing!  I know some might argue that Caesars'' sportsbook is better... I have to disagree.  Never have I been able to find a good seat in the sportsbook at Caesars.  At the Hilton, there are over 50 big screen TVs with 4 or 5 giant screens and plenty of seats for you and your friends.  It truly is a sports fanatic's dream come true, especially on Sunday mornings during football season.

The Buffet here is just OK.  If you're looking for a good buffet this is not it.  Spend a few more dollars and head to the Rio or one on the strip.

Benihana is way overpriced.  Don't bother to eat here especially when there are so many other great places to eat in Vegas.

Here is a little suggestion...

If you stay at the Hilton often or plan on visiting the Hilton in Las Vegas in the near future, please go get yourself an American Express Hilton Rewards club card.  Just by being a member you'll become a Hilton Honors member and will have VIP check in as well as free upgrades and free access to spas and fitness rooms.  (The check in line was over an hour long and I walked straight up to the VIP line and was in my room within minutes.)

If you want to pamper yourself or the significant other, spend a few extra dollars and book a room at the Hilton Grand.  There are now two in Las Vegas.  Both Hilton Grand hotels are top notch and will provide quiet and comfortable during your stay.",u9OMTyNfiUqIUBO3cCybXA,4,1,5,UUvSYA4FCxcQkjpm85pRmQ

4074992,2012-08-28,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Not a good experience at all. I used to stay here when it was the Hilton and I was expecting Hilton quality. Now that it's under new ownership, I'm very disappointed.

It started when we were checking in. I've never seen a line that long to check in before. Took about 30 minutes. When we finally got up to the counter, the receptionist claimed they couldn't find my reservation. Although I made the reservation through a Bloomspot deal, it should have been booked. She said she found it for a future date, which would have been impossible since I was simply checking rates for that date, not reserving. It was only after 20 minutes of back and forth and showing her my confirmation e-mail from Bloomspot and my receipt that they indeed took the money for the reservation via my Paypal account that they suddenly ""found it"", and I only owed the tax.

We stayed on the 7th floor of the North Tower. There are 4 elevators but I swear only 2 are functional. The floor is supposed to be non-smoking but there was a heavy smell of smoke coming from the hallway. We passed by a room service cart outside of a room, where dirty plates and a condom wrapper were waiting for a housekeeper to wheel it away. That was at 5pm. That same cart was outside the room at 11pm, sans condom wrapper....o....k....

We got in our room, which was okay. The sheets were clean and so was the bathroom. The toilet had issues, where if someone in the next room over was showering, you couldn't flush until they were finished. We heard when everyone washed their hands, showered, or tinkled in our neighboring rooms, the plumbing was that loud. The water pressure for the sink and shower sucked also.

Our TV may have been flat screen, but the quality was poor and we constantly had issues with it.

About an hour after we checked in, our phone rang. It was Security, stating a previous guest may have left her glasses in one of the cabinet. After checking every nook and cranny in the room, we let him know that the glasses were nowhere to be found.

The following morning, while my husband and I were sleeping in, our phone rang. It was another Security person, stating the exact same thing, and half-heartedly added ""sorry if I woke you"". I informed him that one of his colleagues already called, and, again, there were no glasses in the room.

House keeping stayed on our floor for what seemed like all day. Since we stayed in the room most of the day, we heard/saw them. The room directly across from us was being ""cleaned"" from 4pm to 7pm. I heard a lot more chatter than cleaning.

That night, around 2am, thankfully my husband and I were still awake. Someone knocked on our door. We knew we couldn't have been loud because we were only watching TV. After my husband asked who was at the door, it was someone saying they were bringing us towels. WE DIDN'T ORDER ANY TOWELS, AND CERTAINLY NOT AT 2AM. When my husband told the guy this, he said he looked thoroughly confused, but finally walked away.

Checkout time, finally. Let's get out of here. Express checkout? You bet. Let's blow this Popsicle stand. Oh, what's that? Sir, you've been waiting for the elevator for 15 mins? 3 other elevators came in the span of another 15 minutes (not even exaggerating), which were all full. We got fed up and walked to the Central tower elevators, which came immediately and only had 2 people on it. Unbelievable.

I wish I would have read the Foursquare tips saying how much of a dump this place was (seriously, dump was in every single tip except 1) before I was already standing in that long line. Sure, they gave me a free bottle of Chardonnay and $10 free slot play, but it just was too little too late. Never again.",jPdIdvQrabOvYhcp9IiRqQ,4,0,2,KJne6cgabFOPsV_hY9CzAA
4077008,2014-05-30,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I""m pretty disappointed in Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. I definately don't remember   Las Vegas Hilton, previously named, being this unattentive and responsive to one of their guests. I decided to write their customer relations dept, who it seemed to be emailed to a ""TPIXLER but still have not received any type of acknowledgement of receipt. Won't ever be staying here again....no matter how desperate I get that for sure. 

Here is what I emailed on 05/05/14 if you guys want to read. 

LVH consumer relations,
I stayed  at your hotel on 05/XX-05/XX, this last weekend visiting Las Vegas. I used to stay at your hotel alot in the previous years in which I had great memories all around. I'm glad to see that it is still the same as when it used to be Hilton but with new rennovated sections, but also some servicing concerns. I am a long time patron of your hotel even if it was during the Hilton days. I am writing you today to address an issue directly instead of ""yelp""ing it or ""trip advisor""ing like everyone else does because I would really like to stay here again. 
Upon my arrival, your hotel's check-in was easy and gentlemen who helped me was very pleasant. He gave us a regular size smoking room near the elevator on the 12th floor. When arriving into our hotel room, it was as I remembered it with some upgrades such as the Keurig coffee maker...very nice. The bathroom seems to be decent but noticed some things that seemed to be not up to ""LVH"" standards i'm sure.  When taking a bath, there were two different porcelain soap holders, lower near the tub and higher up the wall about eye level. The higher up one had crusty dirt and grime that could be caked on from possible old soap residue covering about 1/3 of the holder along with a string of long hair. The lower soap holder was clean. Since i wasn't sure what that residue exactly was it was unpleasant to try to avoid my hair/body parts from touching that area while showering. It's not normal to get dirty when trying to get clean right?  
Another concern was the shower head and surrounding area. The covering/drywall area around the shower head was cracked and unprofessional looking. It devalues the entire room..almost like it's just a motel and not the vintage hotel as I know it as. The water pressure of the shower head was very low. Not to sound so negative but if I could fit into the sink, that would've been a more efficient shower honestly.
So those are my concerns from my stay. I hope you can forward my issues to someone who could help this situation and utilize them to better your hotel for your guests..possibly the hotel maintance manager and the specific maid of that room and floor who prepared the room for me. 
Thank you for your time.",YNIjW6dlbHPvpIj2ztJFYw,1,1,1,zQ96X-h9OP7ZKV5r_SZ6KQ
4077980,2013-11-13,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Stayed at this hotel on a business trip.
While I like the easy access to public transportation (monorail), and the fact that there's lots of entertainment options nearby (dining, casino, shopping-- lots of it in the hotel itself!), the hotel room conditions were HORRIBLE.

I went to take a shower, only to discover that the shower curtain was covered in mold. It was very obvious and had a distinct odor. I had to call housekeeping twice to get it removed. 

Everything in the room was in rough shape--the faucets and toilets were all cracked, and the bed's headboard was broken and falling apart.

The curtains/drapery were my sticking point. Whoever stayed in that room last did a number on them--they were broken, and off the automatic track. As such, they were stuck open and could not be closed. It took five calls to housekeeping/maintenance to get them to fix it...they just kept saying they would notify the ""engineers"" that I had called again.
It was horrible having to hide in the corner of the room so I wasn't exposed while changing, not to mention that having daylight in the room at 5 a.m. was not an enjoyable experience. 

I have never complained about a hotel before, as I'm usually easy to please. If it's clean and has a bed and privacy, I'm good. This place couldn't even offer me basic comforts.",QwI7zfWiB2L3e6Gkud75zQ,5,0,2,0Q4tNRDTwgt8yfRNCwVU9A
4083317,2013-06-10,6,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"The Las Vegas Hotel (a.k.a. LVH), the annoying relatively new name of the former Las Vegas Hilton, was where my guy and I stayed for 2 nights to cap off our recent vacation to 4 National Parks.  It's not a modern or sexy hotel and casino, we knew that beforehand, but we figured LVH would be a place to stay that would save us a few bucks and still keep us relatively close (1-2 monster blocks) to the action on the Las Vegas Boulevard strip.

I'll cut to the chase:  our room was dirty.  If you appreciate any or all of the following, then Room #1116 might be just the place for you:
* peeling yellowed wallpaper
* smeared windows
* discolored and moldy grout
* corroded fixtures
* drinks rings on furniture from previous guests
* dust
* $13.99/day for WiFi
* solicitation in the form of 3 pizza place fliers slid underneath our door during the first afternoon in the room

LVH does have a few redeeming qualities, hence the 2 stars:
* proximity to the Monorail
* a few really fun and not at all politically correct blackjack dealers
* the $8 credit voucher for each day of being green (i.e., passing up maid service)

Wouldn't stay here again.  Even the decent LivingSocial deal we took advantage of didn't inspire me to turn a blind eye to our unkempt run-down room.

Sorry, no photos.  It was more important for me to fill my camera's memory card with photos from the National Parks we visited.",lxt4LomsbAjBvk5POhDTEw,11,6,2,yVwrnAh_Rl9pN3bPi7JwjA

This hotel has a laid back and unpretentious vibe which I enjoy. Yes, there are hotels in Vegas that are more extravagant with more amenities, but if you want a hotel at a decent price with great service, I would highly consider this place.

TIP:  it seems as if the Central Tower is where their older rooms are located.  Try requesting rooms in the East or North Towers for the newer rooms.  I may be wrong about this, but everytime I've stayed in the Central Tower, I got a dated room that kind of looked cheap.",QyX0ftUy_CSKzg3gSiLpOA,3,0,4,XvX5Hnd1RpTzFVSwJPxj-A
4101528,2013-07-31,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Let me preface this negative review by saying while on vacation, I'm there for the scene and the sites, NOT the hotel ... therefore, I'm totally NOT a ""hotel snob"". But, I feel I must do my duty to protect other budget vacationers from having my same experience at this hotel. My family and I stayed for one night at the LVH in July 2013 and I have to say it is the ABSOLUTE WORST!!!

The negatives:

(1) stained carpet
(2) vertical green florescent line on the tv
(3) stinky bathroom
(4) bathroom floor was WET when we first entered our room
(5) dirty tile grout in the shower 
(6) loose shower tiles on the brink of falling
(7) and here's the worst of it ... in the shower, the hot water would only work if it was coming out the bottom faucet. If you turned on the shower head, the water immediately turned cold. What the hell is that all about???

The positives:

(1) Really cheap ... $29 plus an $18 resort fee. 
(2) When I called to complain about our room conditions, the hotel rep comp'd us the night's stay. So, we only had to pay the resort fee.
(3) Very nice hotel workers. (Maybe they know that the hotel sucks and are totally nice to make up for the garbage hotel they work in.)

We were actually pleasantly surprised by the casino floor. They had plenty of slots, a late night snack food restaurant and a lounge. It kept us entertained for a few late night hours after we got in, which was awesome since it is located off the strip and we were too lazy to drive anywhere.

The rooms on the other hand were just OK. I think my only complaint would be the shower leaking the entire time we were there. I was so grossed out by the towel inside the shower used to soak up the water that was dripping that I even avoided showering until we checked in to our other hotel.

4102974,2013-09-05,2,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Meh. Stayed here because we won the Priceline lottery (I use ""won"" very loosely here.) I won't complain about the location, even though it was a long walk to the strip, because I stupidly set the Priceline parameters to include this section.

The good - we had somewhere to sleep, relatively cheap, with a casino and drinks and food all downstairs. 
The guy at the front desk informed us upon arrival that we were near an elevator and moved us to a larger suite that was at the end of a hall for no charge.

The bad - Resort fee. I know these are common in Vegas, but usually you get something worthwhile for them. Nope. Just a coupon book for overpriced restaurants located in the hotel.
Air conditioner leak in our room. Huge lake in the kitchen that we kept slipping in.

The ugly - trash behind our bed. Shampoo and conditioner bottles obviously reused and half-full (half-empty?)

The phones do not have a button for the front desk, so I had to call the operator a few times just to get to the front desk and she acted like she didn't want to transfer me. They don't offer complimentary water or coffee.  Water is $4 per bottle and coffee is $3.50 per cup.  The refrigerator in the room wasn't plugged in and took a while to get cold.  I'm was in the Central Tower and the ice machines were in the North and East Towers.  

The thermostat is outdated and doesn't cool the room good.  The bathroom has ugly pink tile with 1 light that is very dim.  They give complimentary shampoo, conditioner, soap, and lotion, however my conditioner and shampoo were half full when we arrived.  I brought my own, but they reuse unused bottles. There was a stain on the wall. 

I ordered room service and while the staff was very nice the food was disgusting and threw it out.  I usually treat myself to room service once during my stay and I don't mind paying the overpriced items.  However, I was kicking myself for spending $31 on food that I had to throw out.  The only good thing was that if you call housekeeping and tell them you want to go green (meaning they won't clean your room), they slip an $8 food voucher under your door the next day.  So each day you go green, you get $8 to use towards food at the hotel.  

As far as the hotel price, it wasn't bad.  They had a special for $28 + tax/day and $20/day for the resort fee (which is a ripoff for this hotel, I expected better amenities).  I was originally booked for 5 days, but felt so uncomfortable, that I left after 2 days (the $50 penalty was worth it.  I booked a different hotel for the remainder of my stay and it was wonderful!!

They do not provide the bare minimum that you could expect from a given holiday inn. I even asked the concierge for qtips and they acted like it was a ridiculous request and tried to send me to the nearest pharmacy. It does not feel clean and is extremely out of date. This is especially frustrating if here on business.

Turned out to be what they call a ""premium room"" with new beds (on par or a little better than the Westin), premium bed linens, plasma TVs and high speed internet access. Pretty awesome for a comp room and I didn't gamble a dime to earn it.

GOOD: The Hilton has one of the best monorail stations, a one-minute walk from the turnstile to the hotel entry. Again, room was terrific. Service here is good.

BAD: The check-in line was 50-plus people deep when we tried to check in at 6:45pm and again at 11pm. I decided to stand in the VIP line and only had to wait in back of three people.  Two people after me, they canned the line so they could reassign the two VIP check-in staff to the regular line.

4164591,2011-07-06,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"All the other reviews are accurate. It's a standard Hilton, it's old and rundown but there are some pluses. The monorail is the number 1 plus because it is literally right out the door from the Hilton. A 3 day pass for the monorail is only $28 so it's a great deal. We had a free upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite and they didn't have anymore suites available so they just gave us two adjoining rooms! The staff is friendly and there is an option to 'go green', meaning you can deny room service on any given day of your stay and receive a $10 voucher for anywhere in the hotel, including restaurants and coffee shops. 

Here are the downsides of the Las Vegas Hilton. You save money on your room but you spend a lot of time on the monorail. If you are going to Vegas to see the strip and wander around drunk and gamble - the Hilton is not the place for you. Every time we wanted to go back to our hotel we had to find the nearest hotel on the strip with a monorail station and the hotels are so big that it is a long confusing walk to the monorail and it only runs until 3am. And everyone knows it gets expensive quick if you are taking taxis in Vegas.

The restaurants are not good and the buffet is a ridiculous price for being in an old hotel off the strip with mediocre food.

My biggest complaint was that the air conditioning in the Hilton is cranked up way higher than all the other hotels and I was freezing! We never even walked around the hotel because I was too cold and wanted to get outside as soon as possible.

I would recommend the Hilton for people that have events and conferences at the convention center, families, and anyone that is going to Vegas for other reasons besides seeing the strip. If you are going for the strip - stay on the strip.",OtA3JyBtxjl-Wo3l_iWmzQ,0,1,3,v0fFcexRc6fkGPevF363sA

My bride and I had to deal with a rattling AC vent and a loud nocturnal thumping that took the staff four days to locate and repair. The staff tries to be hospitable but the equipment problems are tough to overcome. Want a challenge? Ask for a non smoking room.

Check in here was a breeze at 4pm, and the lady was nice enough to change my room to a quieter location since she found that the room I had originally booked would have been next to the elevators. Thanks! The room was clean except for a few dubious stains on the floor, but I guess that comes with the territory. The biggest pro for me was how comfortable the beds were. Maybe it is the same when food tastes phenomenal after you have starved, but these beds were so comfortable that I felt rested even after 4 hours sleep. The biggest con for me was that it took 5 min for the water to heat in the shower. I was all about the ice cold showers after walking in the desert sun, but I don't like to wake up by freezing my arse off.
Two other bonuses were that they had a nice deli that was pretty cheap and the Paradise Cafe, open 24 hours, serves the yummiest breakfasts and has the nicest servers at 6am and they don't care if you are barefoot because your heels have worn a hole through your foot.

One big factor that I love about this hotel is the fact that it is a stop for the monorail. I love that the monorail goes any part of the strip, 12 bucks for an 24 hour day pass, count me in! 

I admit the bed here is really comfortable, my girlfriend says its a really comfortable pillow, but I mean thats hard to judge because everyone has their different opinions on comfyness. Me on the other hand it was too soft for me. 

Ive been to this hotel twice, and each time I play here I lose! It's not faithful to me here. They do have a small deli at the corner of the casino near the sports/horse racing area, which is open 24 hours. They also have a buffet as well, which I haven't been to during my two visits. 

In other words, this place is a great place to stay at, its not that far from the strip, again it also has a monorail entrance point for the easy part to get back to your room if you are piss drunk.

Pros: 
Free valet (although typical in Vegas)
Very nice staff
Not crowded (for me, this is a pro)
HH at the pool
Free lounge area w/ free WiFi, breakfast, wine, etc. if you can get a VIP card
The Benny Hana's looked kinda nice

Cons:
The place is upgraded, but it's still an older building
They charge for WiFi ($13.99)
They charge for use of safety box in the rooms ($3 per day)
Lots of geriatrics riding around on their red scooters (watch out!)
Not exactly on the strip
No hip clubs, bars, or restaurants 

Overall, not bad, but it depends on a lot of factors. If you're young and hip and into the ""in"" scene, this is not the place for you. If you're older and just want to enjoy a simple no frills kind of hotel for a decent price, the Hilton isn't bad.

Also, if you sign up for the gambling card (don't know the name) they give you $10.00 credit - and if you select GO GREEN on your phone (meaning they don't clean your room) you get another $10.00 credit to gamble with - that's the rumor on the street anyway!

One of the first things we usually do when we get into a hotel is to turn on the TB & just sit back for a little bit. Unfortunately, we couldn't do that because the TV wasn't working. Well, never mind since there is plenty to do in town.

4285042,2014-04-27,10,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Let me start by saying that I am only staying here for a show we are exhibiting at the convention center.  Booking this hotel was strictly due to to it's strategic location next to the exhibit hall.  Although, after making the haul back and forth from LVH to convention center via the monorail (south hall still too far to walk), I would suggest staying at the Renaissance right next to the convention center.   I felt stupid the first time I got off the monorail and saw the Renaissance right smack next to it. It made the haul back to this crappy hotel sting that much more.

Rooms:  I do agree with the other yelpers that the room was not updated, but at least mine was clean, thank God.  The TV reception stunk, the definition comparable to that of a box TV and no channels. Absolutely, no outlets!  It was like frontier town.  It is 2014, we have gadgets we need to power up, but LVH still only thinks we just need one for a hair dryer.  Between my iPad, iPhone, and laptop I had to juggle how much usage I used for each because there was not enough hours in the day to charge each one at a time.  Again, thank God my room was at least clean.

Casino: Depressing. This word probably sums up this entire hotel.  Half the time I could not tell if the people at the slot machines had expired or just taking a cat nap between pressing ""spin.""  By the smell of things, my first guess would be expired.

Food: This by far was the worst part of my stay.  First spot I ate was 888 noodles for lunch.  It was okay.  Took 20 minutes and asking three times to get my check. Just because it is Chinese cuisine do they really have to hire Chinese people that speak little to no English?  Second spot I ate was the Buffet. My three dogs would barf this back up.  Purine quality at best. You got free beer and wine with buffet purchase but I would rather spend 10 bucks for a drink then have to fight over the pig slop they are serving under hot lamps. And the clientele here was like a Springer reunion show.  It is 'all you can eat' folks, why all the pushing and shoving?  I felt like I was in the wild competing with the other predators for my meal.  I was throwing elbows left and right with the rest of them just for the hell of it after a while.  Third meal was the Paradise Cafe for breakfast.  I think they need to look up the definition of the word Paradise and then properly rename this place, Offensive Cafe.  The food and decor was just that, offensive.  I can't believe I even stayed after they sat me.  The last meal I tried there was Bistro Burger.  Waiter was bothered by having to wait on me and the burger was a step above Burger King, and I am not a fan of Burger King.  So now I get up and take the long haul on the monorail to the strip just for a meal that won't make me feel like something died in my stomach an hour after I ate it.  

Overall:  Food sucked a big one, clientele was like vacationing with Cousin Eddy's family from the movies 'Vacation' and this place is so far from everything you spend most of your time walking/cabbing/or on that damn monorail. Laborious.

That being said, the rooms are just fine!  Clean, good sized and modern.  My shower curtain bothered me because there were some splotches that I didn't make but, they immediately replaced it when I commented on it.  The low points actually deal more with the casino than the rooms.  They have greatly reduced the size of the gaming area and its disappointing.  They should add more games and bring back slots to the space quest bar and OPEN the dang bar up during the days .  some of my best memories are on one of those bar stools in the early hours of the morning. lastly, some one on this site said that the LVH does not give out free drinks while playing slots, only tables.  what BS!

* TV's POOR reception, not many channels, and half of those channels are hotel advertisements
* Elevators,.. Never experienced such slow elevators, they actually have rush hour traffic jams on these things. You literally have to account for this as part of your commute time to a show.

Minh and I met up with our friends who live in LV and we decided on coming here after dinner for some drinks. 

I cannot remember what the bar name was but it was a nice loungy type place. It had swag appeal and some pretty good prices on drinks. 

*Warning* this bar is limited so do not request any fancy drinks. 

Ashley and I ordered Sour apple martinis and the boys had beer. The lounge area was nice and dark, the music was okay. But all that mattered was us drinking and having fun! Drinks are semi stiff, and the bartender was a nice guy too! 

LVH hotel is not the type of place you would catch us hanging around at! Honestly, I really do not like the people who are here! On our way out there were a couple of guys (who were older) walking out and clearly, you could tell guy #2 had just a little too much to drink because he his friend was holding him up and trying to get him to walking straight. Well drunk guy by accident bumped into this chick who was walking past him with her friends, his buddy said ""sorry he's been drinking"" but that didn't stop her, she took off her sandals and went after him (think Jerry Springer style) yelling at him and trying to step to him. Holy poop it got real hood up in the LVH, any buzz Minh and I had was pretty much gone after that!

I guess I am a little partial to this place because of all the good memories I've had here the past decade. My father racked up a bunch of Hilton Honors points when he was traveling for work, and so we would always stay here for free or close to free. Granted, the casino and hotel are outdated and the size of the casino itself is a bit small (table games). Also, there is no poker room. But there is an awesome Benihana here where you actually have to take an elevator up to the dining room. There is also one of the best sports books in all of Vegas here as well (it's listed separately on Yelp so check out the reviews if you're a sports bettor). This last time we just visited for a couple of hours. There has always been a bit of a ghetto crowd here but this time it seemed more pronounced. It was mostly around the side casino though, where the old Star Trek exhibit used to be. However, the main casino and everything else were the same as before. The Las Vegas Hilton is home to many good times with my Pops and cousin who would visit from Germany just to go to Vegas. Basically, if you are not too high maintenance and don't mind hanging out off the strip, you will have a good time at the Hilton.

The first room we got had water leaking from either the toilet or the tub, not sure.  We called housekeeping and they transferred me to the front desk and they got us another room immediately.  The next room was fine.  The beds seemed smaller than queen beds, but it was good for one night.  I read other comments about hearing everything, but I didn't hear our neighbors.  That could be due to the fact that we didn't have neighbors or that we had gotten there so late that we were too tired to hear anything.

This year the lady at the front desk double talked me and said we have been upgraded from the Grand room to a resort club room for an extra $10 per night.  When we got up to the room, it turned out to be another crappy room.  I immediately called down to the front desk to complain but was told they sold out of Grand rooms.  They considered me upgraded because my room was supposed to have robes, slippers & a free bottle of water, NONE of which was in our room.  I was told to call housekeeping about getting those items sent up.  We were also given gold keys to another room on another floor, which apparently had food and drinks but only open limited hours so we never did have a chance to see that.  So, thats what they considered an ""upgrade"" and tried to charge me more for.  I ended up calling the manager the next day and they took $30 off but to me it wasn't worth it at all.

I'm in their player's club (whose player's club am I NOT in??) so they send me deals in the mail all the time.  $199 for three nights plus free buffets?  Yes, please!

I love this hotel because it was just remodeled, has a decent pool, several happy hours, they have inexpensive gambling, and a ton of  food options.  Also it is home to Barry Manilow, and the Star Trek bar, Quark's, home of the Warp Core Breach and Borg Sphere punchbowl drinks!  Nerd watching potential is high at the Hilton.  

Definitely request a renovated room.  Great beds, and if you can get them to put you in the North tower, that's the concierge tower and you get access to their 24th floor lounge with free snacks and drinks 6am - 8pm.  This plus free buffets equals not paying for much food and hence more money for gambling at the $5 tables (day time only).

No one contacted me back. OK then..just so you don't experience the same.....heres my review....maintenance  and housekeeping issues are present all over the hotel.  Some of the employees seem to be rude to guests Ir$$e in the club floor Sh@#la at the front Desk both should be working at a post office. The hotel seems to be a fragment of the Hilton. Dead on M-T-W so if I was spending modest I would get a better value elsewhere. The hotel overall is VERY dirty, public areas such as elevators haven't been clean in years. I had to change rooms myself because the tub  was black and mildewed in the bathroom, drain stopped up.  The only good thing is the beds they are comfortable...but make sure you have your Resort Key when entering the club room...despite signing in.... I was interrogated by the gal this morning. She made it clear not to move till she validates the list.  Moving on to reservations department - had to change a folio name on our company block ...had to remind agent three times spelling of the name of Jason  ....finally I asked her to write the name down..needless to say ad to get a manager to complete transaction.

The other big problem is that the walls are paper thin.  You can hear conversations and noise from all around.

IN GENERAL:
The front desk area was nice, but there was almost always a wait for check-in, key pick-up, etc.  The front desk staff varied from nice to end-of-my-shift-grumpy.  They have a ""Go Green"" program, which I thought was kinda cool.  If you don't want your room cleaned, press the ""Go Green"" button on your phone and they'll slide a $10 hotel voucher under your door in the morning.  Score!  You can also check out from your room phone, which saved us some time.  

Worst Paper Products Ever.  I know hotels aren't going to buy lovely Cottonelle and Puffs Plus for their rooms, but I'm not sure which was worse: the medium-grade sand paper tissues or the toilet paper that disintegrated on contact.  I never smelled cigarette smoke in the rooms, but every one of us got stuffed up noses the minute we walked in our rooms all week.  Something about the ventilation in the hotel is not right.  Also, there was a daily fee for WiFi access.  Boo hiss.  

NORTH TOWER:
I apparently got an upgraded room, which came with an extra sitting area.  There was a fridge, a nice tv, a couch, a couple of chairs, and a coffee table.  A colleague got a non-upgraded room across the hall, which was identical without the extra sitting area.  The room was super clean.  Everything looked pretty new, the carpet was in great condition, and the tile in the entryway and bathroom was gleaming.  Bathroom had a full-sized hair dryer and a garden tub.  Bed was super comfy, as part of the upgrade is an upgraded pillow-top mattress.  Other than the ventilation playing havoc with my sinuses, this was a great room.

CENTRAL TOWER:
Obviously built before the North Tower, this wing has seen better days long ago.  The bedding seemed clean and the bed was comfy enough, but the room had a general ""ick"" feel to it.  The carpet was very worn and stained.  There were a couple of used tissues on the floor behind the bathroom trash can.  The shower head was broken and flopped down, so I had to crouch and duck under it to wash.  No fridge.  It just felt old, outdated, and worn out.  It was like being in a totally different hotel.

My room was on the east tower on the sixth floor. It was pretty close to the elevators which was a little loud, but my ear plugs blocked out the noise. The non-smoking room was nice and suprising large. I liked that the sink and toilet area were separate. The bathroom was a little outdated, but clean, always a plus. I didn't enjoy the bed though, you could feel every spring in your back. Plus the pillows looked fluffy, but as soon as you layed on them they fell flat like a piece of paper. I had a nice view of the strip, but for some reason the LVH never had their sign lit up? Maybe the light bill is too expensive! :)
As far as the casino goes, pretty standard. The cigarette smoke was not over powering and gaming areas were clean. I enjoyed the sports book area the most. Nice, comfy seating and very attentive waitresses. The pool area was meh. The pool is not large at all, but was somewhat relaxing because it is not crowded at all. They also played a nice variety of music as well. The guy who walked around offering massages and sun tan lotion was CREEPY! I don't want those hands anywhere near me!
As many have already said, this spot is pretty far from the popping properties of the strip, but the monorail will get you there in minimal time. On weekends it also runs till 3AM.

At check in they asked if we wanted a remodeled room for $20/nt...uh no, otherwise I would've stayed at a nicer hotel, nice try though. If you opt out of housekeeping they give you $5 off any restaurant or $10 in free play...we opted to make our own bed. 

This is one of the monorail stops so that worked out well, we walked from the hotel to the strip and meandered all the way to the MGM and just took the monorail back...easy peasy.  A cab to Fremont was only $12.

The Paradise Cafe-Sooo over priced. Just toast will cost you $4 or $5. Again the coffee is $2.75 (Is there some price fixing going on here?) Any of the full breakfasts cost at least $9 and seems to be instant/already prepared type foods, not real cooking going on, except the omlets.
Good things: Free parking, friendly staff, monorail station in the hotel, much quieter than the main part of the strip, and its on Paradise/not Las Vegas Blvd.
The neighborhood is probably as far from the main strip as you can go and still have some safety.
Just saw another review stating to watch your credit card closely, I will definitely do this, I was a little concerned by Hilton's mandatory deposit and not telling me my total bill when I added a night (prior to arrival).

4608970,2012-10-22,4,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I don't agree with many of the lackluster (or worse) reviews of this property.  As others have mentioned, this was the Las Vegas Hilton up until January of this year, now it's known as the Las Vegas Hotel, or LVH.   I'd booked this hotel for 3 nights, primarily because it was one of the more inexpensive options of the larger and more well known Vegas properties (inexpensive being a relative term;  It was $152/night on Thur., $115/night on Fri. and $83/night on Sat. with a special promotion), but also because it's connected to the Las Vegas Convention Center where I was attending a trade show. 

I've stayed at several other Vegas hotels in the past (MGM Grand, Alladin/Planet Hollywood, Tropicana, Excalibur, etc.) and in my opinion, this hotel and the room itself ranked as good or better than all of those.  When I arrived, I was greeted by a bellman who asked if I needed assistance with my luggage (I didn't), another woman greeted me and held the entrance door open for me while another gentleman welcomed me to the Las Vegas Hotel and pointed me toward the check in desk. It did take about 5 minutes to get through the check in line, but the line moved steadily, and the check in personnel were great.

Based on other reviews of this property, I was expecting to find an old, broken down hotel with poor service.  I didn't find that at all.  My room was actually larger than the one I had at the Excalibur during my last visit, it was well appointed, there was both wired and wireless Internet available ($13.99 for 24 hours), the room was clean and everything was in ""like new"" condition.  It was outfitted with a 40"" flat screen TV, updated and modern wall coverings, bedding, furniture, artwork and draperies and a good sized desk so I could get work done while here.  There was a safe provided in the room and boutique soaps and shampoos from Kudos Spa. 

The only critical comments I'd make are that a few of the lighting fixtures in the lobby and elevator corridors, and the large ""LVH"" sign out front do make this place look a touch dated (1980's design and lots of brass), but those wouldn't take much to update, and outside of those items, and the fact that the main club looks a bit odd as it still has much of the decor and layout from the old, now defunct ""Star Trek Experience"" exhibit that was once located here, this hotel looks fairly modern and seems to be in good condition - certainly in better shape (and not as smokey and in some cases smelly) than many of the properties on the strip itself. 

I did notice a lack of food options at this hotel when compared to many other casinos in Vegas.  When I arrived, I was more than an hour later than I expected to be (thanks, American Airlines), and I had some work I needed to get done and a call I needed to take part in before meeting up with some business associates later in the day.   For this reason, I really only wanted to grab something quickly.  Unfortunately the options were limited.  They had all their regular ""sit-down and be served"" restaurants (Bennihana, Vince Neil's Cantina, TJ's Steakhouse, etc.) but when I went to the area that was mentioned in their signage for ""fast food"", I found only a Pizza Hut Express, Seattle's Best Coffee, and an ice cream stand.   I ended up going to their sports book area (the largest in Vegas, I believe) and grabbing something from the sports grill there.

Know that they charge extra if you wish to use the safe in the room, and though they have an offer where they'll give you a $5 food/drink voucher or a $10 gaming voucher if you call and refuse room service for the day, you cannot apply that during the day of check in or the last 2 days of your stay.   Therefore, during my 4 day stay, I could only take advantage of that offer once.  It would've also been nice to have a coffee maker in the room, rather than having to go to the lobby each morning for a caffiene boost.

It should be noted that, while this hotel is more or less connected to the convention center and there is a monorail station here to get you to the strip quickly, it's fairly far off the strip itself.   In fact, I had a room that more or less faced the strip, and my view was of the back side of the Venetian, Wynn and Encore properties, all a fair distance away.

In all, I'd definitely stay here again.  I found the staff to be friendly, rooms well appointed, modern and in good condition and had absolutely no complaints about my time here.  This is especially true when considering the price of this hotel/casino compared to many others in this city (excluding the off brand hotels/motels and known dumps like Circus Circus and the Stratosphere).",-VOylYXNq7sG6As966yTxA,8,5,4,RGDCZHz4ttvNx5mEwxynIA

4621452,2007-02-12,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"The only reason why I stayed here was because my brother was attending a conference at the Hilton Convention Center.  I had originally asked for a non-smoking room at the front desk and was surprised to see ashtrays in my room. I had to change rooms because the stench of the smoke was way overpowering.  After the person at the front desk said that it was an option to make my previous room a non-smoking room, (yeah, insert chuckle here) I was switched to a better room with no problem, but it was a little strange as it was a handicap enabled room - a minor annoyance compared to the poor amenities.  I don't even want to know what  kind of greasy whitish stain that was on the desk chair.  I'm normally easily pleased when it comes to hotel rooms, but was expecting more from the Hilton Hotels, such as the great experiences I had with The Embassy Suites and Hampton Inn (both part of the Hilton Hotels.)  I mean, I'm the type of person that loves camping and enjoyed roughing it in a third world country with not so pleasant accommodations.

The monorail is convenient to a certain extent.  Unfortunately, the monorail stops aren't in the most desirable locations.  If you're wearing high heels (like most women and sometimes men in Vegas,) don't even think about taking the monorail.  The extra money you'll spend on a taxi cab will be truly worth it.  When we also took the monorail to the Stratosphere, it seems we were dropped off in the middle of nowhere.  We had to walk half a mile or so to finally make it to our destination.

The only reason why I gave the Las Vegas Hilton a 1 star was because I thought Star Trek the Experience was a great playground for my dorkiness.  I don't think you have to be a fan to enjoy it, but if you're tempted to touch anything during the shows - don't - the starfleet officers take their jobs seriously and will phaser your hand off. :)",SFUlxAYt9Kasj1L2Bki5gw,1,0,1,GGnNLIquPZyhtmbaWnFJJg

I don't know what their criteria is for rating hotels, but I suspect they just wanted to have a second 4-star rated hotel listed for the convention center area. How could they possibly rate this Motel-6-like motel with the 4-star Renaissance hotel a couple of blocks away?
I suppose this hotel merits 2 stars on it's own, and you only spent $30 a night for it. However, if one bases one's rating on Priceline calling it a 4-star hotel, it only deserves a single star.

The first thing was we were looking for a bellhop to help us with our luggage due to back problems and couldn't find one anywhere. We checked in to our first room and discovered it was dirty and covered in cigarette burns. When we went back down to ask for another room, we decided to upgrade for an extra $20 a day. We got to that room only to walk into a shitty situation. Literally. The toilet was FULL of shit. I don't mean someone forgot to flush the toilet, I mean like someone was playing a nasty prank on us and didn't flush for 3 days.  How's that to start the vacation?

Then we had to wait for a plumber, who finally fixed the issue and then had to wait for housekeeping to come back because there was shit all over the floor. Management didn't offer us anything at all for the disgusting inconvenience nor did they offer to switch our room. We're even considering staying a few extra days but will definitely be switching hotels. What happened to the service and cleanliness The Hilton brand use to carry with it?

Spend the extra few bucks to stay down the way.

Okay same day update: I bitched and moaned and got one night of the upgraded room ($20) paid for and my $20 room service paid for. $40.

Once in the hotel, however, you have a bunch of shopping, including a nice little cabana shop on the pool deck on the third (?) floor.  The pool itself is a nice sprawling effect on the rooftop, which means you don't have to deal with car fumes that you'll find in a bunch of other hotels - some of the newer resorts have them hidden, but older places put you next to streets and parking lots.

Front desk ""manager"" known as ""Junior"" is the most unprofessional, rude and ignorant person Ive had to deal with personally or professionally. I was actually stunned by his blatantly ignorant attitude.

Some employess are true gems, others the bottom of the barrel. Junior Salvator is an example of the latter and im sure has cost this place dearly. I have had friends and groups in town and have sent them elsewhere due to this ...person

Granted its a faded glory BUT that solely due to Colony capitol the owners who had a unique licensing agreement with Hilton, which finally, they lost effective Jan 3 2012. Colony walked away from Resorts in Atlantic City and The AC Hilton, now the ACH, lost its franchise immediately and according to teh AC press hasnt paid taxes since 2009. This seems to be the way this company operates: Buy a property run it to the ground until teh bank takes over and declare bankruptcy.

The rooms are old. Even the fantasy suites on the 29th floor feature ( drum roll) A VCR!! I miss the 80's but REALLY?? Rugs look like they just removed the police tape from the crime scene, dirty musty and old. bathrooms are surprisingly clean however. The halls are long , floors uneven and dark. SIGNAGE IS HORRIBLE you will never find you way without a guide.

Spa is OLD SCHOOL which, if you like that, youll enjoy the experience. Gym is in the spa. There are separate male and female spa areas. rugs are filthy in the locker room. A hot tiny workout room with machines usually not functioning

Food: its BAD but at least its EXPENSIVE....... LVH is NOT a food destination. benihana is the best outlet but even that is very uneven. 

check in is amazingly slow- so slow its almost like a seinfeld skit, typing for minutes and minutes etc. Other properties are so fast.

Bedding and towels are old. very old and surely the cheapest they could rent. Amenities are hilton standard however that will change in 2012. beds are cheap. Few furnishings in the room

TV: Tired old box tvs and some rooms have plasmas BUT only a handful of channels and no HD which most other properties have.

Complains and problems fall on deaf ears. Its the only Hilton affiliated property that does not respond to emails when all you are trying to do is resolve an issue, which then in itself becomes and issue.

Vip lounge has its gems... This access is given to Diamond members instead of the lounge floor upgrade or access as required under Hilton Hhonors program ( they have the resorts club level-named to avoid policy compliance, not worth the price)

Parking is easy. Fast to get from car to room usually. Avoid sportsbook parking on sunday of course

Sportsbook is giant and loud. Table games frequently have high minimums. Slots run from 1980 models to newer games. Players Card program went from bad to worse. Low payback and comp especially since the other properties have upgraded their programs.

Many people have the same complaints over a long period which clearly shows the lack of ACTION from the property. Ive seen the innocous responses to some complaints posted here, but that ""lip service"" is only to alieviate the effect of the honest reviews.

If you get a cheap rate, and need a place to stay...well... actually, there are many superior properties ( South point, Orleans etc) that offer superior product at a low price,

We came here to help out for a couple weeks at the Bikram Yoga teacher training that was held here for 9 weeks.  That's right: 300 Bikram Yogis staying here for 9 weeks at a time, doing 11 yoga classes a week, plus lectures & posture clinic and Bollywood movies til 4am.  All of this happening in a casino environment.  It was a bit surreal at times.

As for the rooms, we staying in two different ones for 3 nights each, book-ending our stay in Vegas, since we used our timeshare in the middle.  The rooms were small but adequate.

The first room was 1516 & it was perfectly nice.  I thought the bed was firm & comfy enough & the tub was standard & clean.  The TV is kindof sad, tho, with not a lot of programming & movies are $15 each!  You can't even pause or rewind them - one chance to watch.  That's it.

The second room was 6-122 in the North Tower, which was located by the Scenic Elevator, which is a bit slow, but conveniently located near the gift shop & the yoga tent.  It was a little bigger with a mini fridge & a big, roomy bathtub.

The Las Vegas Hilton is simple and more understated than the mega resorts but, we came to appreciate that especially when enjoying the amenities of the place.  We rented a cabana by the pool on a whim and the staff spoiled us like crazy. We enjoyed the spa and the spa staff spoiled us like crazy.  The simple understated nature of this place meant it was more low key than the places on the strip allowing staff to be more attentive and enhance a weekend getaway/ anniversary celebration for  two parents who needed a break from tending to little ones.

A couple of other points about staying here --- it's easy to get to the Strip without hoofing it in the hot Vegas sun.  Simply hop the Monorail. It was very easy.  

Also, one very amusing point of interest in the Las Vegas Hilton is the Star Trek: The Experience. Guests are transported to the future battling BORG and Klingon.  You can eat and drink at Quark's Bar & Restaurant, shop at Zek's Grand Emporium and Moogie's Trading Post and walk through STAR TREK history at The History of the Future museum.

So then we walk into our room. The beds are small and lumpy and so sad looking. They are covered with sheets (no comforter). The coffee maker is keurig but it costs $3.50 to open up the cup with all the creamer/coffee grounds/etc so uh no thanks. but the WORST was the carpet! I'm pretty sure someone bashed their head in in that room because there were some suspect spots on the carpet and some totally black spots. IT WAS DISGUSTING. There was no way in heck I was staying in here so I called teh front desk and they said they would send someone up with new keys for us to move to a king bed (somehow they now had one). Points for them sending someone to me and not making me have to go back down. However, it took forever to have the person get there and when they did, they knocked, we answered, and then he had to go chase some guy down the hall because the guy had walked toward him, teh bell hop thought the guy was from our room and said ""are these keys for you"" and the guy said ""yes"" and just took them! What the heck? 

He got our keys back and we moved floors to another room (mind you as we were moving, another couple was in teh elevator talking about the pictures they took on their phones to show the front desk so they could switch rooms...so we weren't alone). Our new room was SO MUCH NICER. It had nicer carpet, the king bed was delightful, the coffee was still $3.50 but holy cow we were so much happier. 

The bed was comfy, the room stayed dark and it was quiet all night. Having the monorail there was also an added benefit and made it really easy to stay by the strip in somethign affordable but still have quick access to the strip.

it has fallen a bit since its glory days as the Las Vegas Hilton (now it's the Westgate), but still an above average & serviceable off-Strip casino/hotel; absolutely massive sports book, which includes a separate non-smoking area; eclectic and diverse crowd throughout the premesis; I love the big serene indoor lounge with the waterfall at the entrance to Benihana; not much of a place for shopping with many shops surprisingly closed early on a Friday night; sort of ran out of things to do here after a while; didn't like that the parking is separate from the hotel, so it's a moderately long open-air walk; best craft beer bet = hands down, it's at the Burger Bistro, but inexplicably this place closes at 9PM every night - I thought we were in Las Vegas?",sg3wRRtKMfugbO7A3AX4Ew,3,0,3,uV7dHCAAPa3I2JisfSlIAg

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The hotel grounds are very big, and well done.  The lobby was nice, and front desk very accessible from the front door/valet.  First big plus.  

Next, the rooms were fantastic.  Perhaps a little wear, beds were great, nice big desks, internet for a fee (wired and wireless), and a fairly decent selection of places to eat in the hotel (when we did not feel like going back out).  

Too, this hotel is on the one end of the monorail should you care to venture out without a cab.

They would have way better ratings, in my opinion,  if their service was better.  We arrived early, and the reservation staff informed us that the room was not ready yet.  That's fine (we were early after all)....we went into the casino and gambled for a bit.  He assured us that we would be able to check in after 3pm.

We get back in line after 3, and another staff member (with an attitude) tells us that the room is not ready and that she cannot (or will not) give us an estimated wait time.  I mean, come on....I just want to unpack my stuff and get ready for my dinner, which I had reservations for.

The manager was even more unhelpful.  She acted as if we were bothering her by asking her to give us some sort of time frame in which we would have to wander around the hotel like clean hobos.  Eventually, she just ended up giving us the keys to another suite and making it seem like it was US (me and my sis) that requested THAT particular room.  YOUR staff chose to put us in the room that wasn't ready!

So...we arrive at the room, and it kind of made up for the craptastic service.  Super spacious.  A parlor room that was huge, connected to a separate bedroom/reg. hotel room.

If you book the resort things get a little nicer, they have an exclusive (using the term lightly) lounge, give you free wi fi and even have complimentary wine and beer during the evening hours.

First I went to Tres Rios, The Vince Niel Place, and learned that the actual kitchen has been closed for 18 months and they only do happy hour drinks and appetizers, Literally thats all they open for, then I try to go to the Benihana garden and hit up the sushi bar they have in there to grab a few rolls for my wife and I and learn they are CLOSED FOR THE SUMMER, finally I have to go the cafe and order a boring grilled chicken sandwich.

overall it was good. 5 stars for service, 2 for plumbing so i give it 4 because attitude is everything! people were very nice to me. if they weren't i would give it a 3. i was on a non-smoking floor but at certain times of the day smoke did come up in the hallways. also people put cigarettes out by the elevators.

4916445,2012-04-27,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"A dear friend of mine escapes to Vegas every chance she gets.  I'd heard about the wonders of this hotel long before I had a chance to spend a night.  I'm happy that I had the chance, and I wish I had been able to see it in its prime.

We were lucky.  We managed to snag one of the rooms on the third floor.  These rooms do not feature an amazing view, nor do they feature over the top decoration.  Instead they feature a quiet elegance alongside a bit of throwback charm.  I was so sorry to have to check out after my only night staying in this room, and when I make it back to Las Vegas, this is where I will head.

The room was a split level, with the bathroom and beds at the top, then a few steps down to a small seating area and desk.  I was so pleased with what I found just outside the sliding glass doors. My own very private canopied lanai.  Just beyond my area was a walkway that ran the length of the hotel and connected all of the rooms on that side.  The walkway wrapped around the hotel and could easily have been used as a jogging path.  I believe it connected to the pool area, but did not have time to explore.  Next time!

Las Vegas is an interesting place, and my constant traveling companion is my young son.  I don't gamble and I don't drink, so we spent most of our time in the hotel hanging out in the small cafe in the walkway.  We had so much fun watching the wide variety of people walk by.  Who needs an expensive show?  Ok, we needed an expensive show.  We did not get to see one here, sadly, but I was told that the hotel does still have big names, and that the theater is pleasant.  

I was sad to see that the Star Trek themed lounge had been mostly dismantled.  It is now a strange mix of ""display"" and ""disturbing"" as a few of the electronic gizmos are still active in the bathroom.  Strange to be washing your hands and realize that there is a computer monitor behind the mirror.  As the code scrolled by, I realized that it might not be so sad that the displays had been removed.  

The hotel has a stop on the monorail system.  I was not able to make use of this, and was sad not to see more people taking advantage.  It is another item on my list of things to try.  

I found (as I often do) that the service was what will stay with me as I think back on my visit.  Because I was lucky enough to be with a friend who is a regular, I received service that was above and beyond.  (It might also have been partly influenced by the box of manapua I delivered to the front desk.  Always travel with goodies.  Always!) I know my friend well, and know that the service had to have started off well, as she would never have made this hotel a ""home away from home"" without this being the case.  Again, I look forward to my return visit, and expect that even without my friend by my side I will receive stellar service.

4933203,2013-01-16,2,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"We ended up staying at the LVH (in another, better time, The Las Vegas Hilton) because they had crazy cheap deals on Travelocity, which should've maybe been a red flag, but wasn't.  We ended up getting a deluxe room (a room with a King bed, mini fridge, small sitting area) for $60 a night plus 2 vouchers for a free beer or well drink and then $15 per person in dining credits and 25% off at the spa.  Though for the most part all the vouchers and freebies were awesome, I've definitely stayed in better for cheaper (here's looking at you, Golden Nugget!).  

Hubby and I aren't really ""Strip"" people--we tend to keep Vegas pretty low key and don't mind if we're out of the main part of the action, so the skeezy side of Vegas or downtown are fine with us, but the fact that the LVH is on the eastside of town should probably be an immediate turn off for you if you feel otherwise.  The hotel feels like it was once nice--it is enormous and labyrinthine, granted with a lot of ""defunct"" or not very updated areas--the hotel map isn't updated and most ammenities don't exist anymore.  The casino floor is almost entirely slot machines and is a small area, but good selection of games, clean and tidy, etc.  There is a huge sports betting lounge with bars and snack bar that looked awesome if you're into that thing and it was packed all weekend.

The rooms were an entirely different story. Though we were pretty happy with our room and it was fairly clean and updated and deluxe, we didn't get a King bed, but instead got stuck with two full beds and true to form in getting a discounted room, a lot of things didn't work in it--the fridge was defunct and had a sopping wet towel in it, the water in the shower never got hot, the bathroom light was almost impossible to turn on (it was a motion sensor jobby that didn't sense motion...instead you had to pound on it even get it to turn on), and the faucet handles on the bathroom sink were loose and very hard to turn on.  The room was quiet, but the people in our hall must've partied like pigs all weekend because there were always dirty linens and pizza boxes outside which seemed to take all weekend to clean up.  

The real part where I got miffed though was in the situation of our friends' room.  They had booked about a week after us and decided to get a suite, which they were going to pay $170/night for and which would come with the same dining credits.  The suite advertised stated that it was two separate rooms, the bedroom having a King bed and the second room having a sitting area and a Murphy bed (one of those awesome ones that comes out of the wall in all the James Bond movies!)  However, when we checked in, they were told that the King bed wasn't available and that their ""suite"" would have just the one room.  Um, last time I checked, this made it not a ""suite"" any more.  They were going to take it just to keep things easy, but when we got there, the room was just a big open sitting area and had obviously not been cleaned in a long time (there were WADS of dust bunnies behind all the furniture and inside the Murphy bed) and the furniture was dirty and outdated and there were condom wrappers under the bed.  The hotel tried to claim that this was the suite they had ordered and that they would still have to pay $170 for it.  What they should've said was ""Hey guys, we rented out the second half to your suite so we're collecting money on that one, too--have this shitty after-thought of a room that no one uses or cleans"".  Luckily, after a lot of arguing, the hotel gave them a new King room comparable to ours (but still not as nice) for the same rate we were getting.  This, again, was after telling our friends that there were no King rooms left in the hotel.  Mighty shady, LVH, mighty shady.

Another ""misstep"" the hotel made was the fact that the casino is overrun with prostitutes in the wee hours of the night.  There must be a hooker witching hour because as soon as the ladies in our party had retired, the ""ladies"" of the night appeared.  The men in our group, who had decided to stay out for a few more hours, were solicited by about five different girls each.  They seem to loiter around the bar and at the slot machines--is there something we don't know?  Is the LVH a place to pick up a paid companion?  Does the hotel have some sort of arrangement with the area's prostitutes?  They might want to check into that...

A plus for the hotel was the breakfast buffet--though much more humble than one of the big fancy ones, all-you-can-eat is $19.99 and includes champagne--this means your dining credits from the package you can book just about fully covers it--lots of classic breakfast favorites, but also lox and crab legs, really good donuts and of course, my favorite, biscuits and gravy and some yumptious pies and barbequed meats.  Uh-huh.

All in all, some nice ammenities, but definitely the hotel has seen better days and there is some sketchiness going on.  You should stay elsewhere for sure.",3hfz4MWc14zWNrrBi6wXEg,8,6,2,BDOz3bfYc-ng1O_wY-Mk_w

4987539,2012-09-06,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I have some good things and some bad things to say about this hotel.
Granted when we came it was a Friday afternoon. We were a little leery about the valet line. It was long and there weren't any indicating signs where to go or if any attendant would come to you. So, we did as what everyone else was doing. We got out of the car, got our luggage, left the key in the ignition and walked into the casino. Everything was fine.
When we got into the casino we saw there was a long wait to be checked in. We got in line and it went pretty fast. When we got to the head of the line we were pulled into the V.I.P room where we checked in and upgraded our room. Everyone was very friendly and very helpful. Our room was nice and very clean.
The only thing we were truly disappointed about was #1. The pool. It was very dirty and some of the clientele was wishy -washy. My fiance and I were really looking forward to spending the day at the pool, but decided against it. #2. The clientele. For every 5 women there was a ratio of 3 prostitutes. Plus their pimps. Which we weren't too keen on. We found ourselves wishing we would have booked elsewhere, but we couldn't because we were there for a wedding. One of the good things about this place is they give you a very nice wedding. The chapel was very nice and the reception was fun! We enjoyed ourselves.
It is a big IF, if I ever do go to vegas I would probably steer clear of the LVH and find myself going to a more upscale hotel and casino.",y2qdsqpAZDoAdunpe_XbYQ,1,1,3,SHgahTCtRTIWOqKdwTF06A

4996164,2014-01-28,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Based on *my* experience, I gave the p;ace 4 stars, but that does NOT mean it's a four-star hotel, and I think that's some people forget to take into account when writing a bad review of the place.

  When in Vegas with friends, I've always stayed at the Elara (former Planet Hollywood Westgate Tower) & I love that place -- but it's about $175 per night!

  I had to be in Vegas a few weeks ago for a convention, & was looking for a relatively inexpensive, decent place.   Being curious about it, I decided to book a room at the LVH via their web page.  For an average of about $75 per night (including their BS 'resort fee') I got a 'Strip-view' room.

 After making the reservation, stupid me got around to reading the Yelp reviews from over the past year.  Most were negative, and that got me nervous.  But I'm glad to say that despite the mostly unfavorable reviews, I decided not to cancel my reservation, and experience the LVH for myself.

I'm glad I did.     I checked-in on a Wednesday afternoon at about 5:45PM, and the process was smooth -- only about a 5 minute wait, and the staff person was friendly & fast.  As requested, I received a non-smoking room on an 'upper' floor -- 29th floor of the Central Tower.

   The Hotel tower is massive, & while it's really just one big structure, they've divided the guest floors into North, Central & South Wings and have separate elevator areas for each wing, though you could take any elevator to the appropriate floor & walk to your room.

  Not knowing anything better when I arrived, I parked my car in the I think it was the North parking structure.   As is the case with most large hotel parking structures, it wasn't extremely clean, and there were many signs up warning that the hotel is not responsible for anything stolen from cars.   That did make me a little nervous.   Contrary to what at least one other reviewer mentioned, there wasn't any security person standing at the entrance or exit stopping drivers.   The only security I saw in the parking structure (I always found a parking spot at the far end of the ground floor) were some CCTV cameras, but they absolutely did not provide coverage of most of the parked cars.   During the 5 times I was in & out of the parking structure, I never saw a security patrol, but that does not mean they weren't around.  I looked for, but never observed broken glass on the ground indicative of a car window being recently smashed.

  It was a very long walk from my car to the lobby area, and then from the elevator to my room, but it allowed me to see a little bit of the hotel.   The LVH was not at all crowded ever during my stay -- not the lobby, gambling areas, restaurants, sports book, etc.  I don't know how they can afford to stay in-business.

  I  was pleasantly surprised by my room --again, keeping in-mind that I was paying 'only' about $75 per night.    I did not pay extra for what they claimed to be recently updated rooms, so I assume I got an 'older' room, but it was very nice -- nice, soft bed with clean sheets, a nice desk area with extra AC outlets, etc.  The carpet was somewhat worn, but appeared clean.  If you really looked hard, you'd see that the wallpaper was coming loose in a few areas.    The only surprise was that the maid had left a dirty rag on the floor.    Bathroom was clean, and the shower head was about 6'2"" above the tub floor (another review mentioned a low shower head).   I took a shower that night around 10PM & the water temp was just right, though I couldn't get it excessively hot. Took a shower at 10AM the next day & then 8AM on the Friday morning & each time, water pressure & temperature was just fine.

  Claiming my room had a 'Strip view' was silly as the Strip was a couple miles away, thus the view wasn't really photogenic or even all that cool at night.  I could look down onto the LVH swimming pool/cabana & tennis courts area.    The pool is really small, and the lounge chair area very large.  The cabanas seemed pretty far away from the small pool.   As far as I can tell, the LVH isn't trying to market any of that 'beach club' stuff as of yet, and the pool area was closed during my January stay (despite it being sunny with daily highs in the 60s).  If you're looking for a place that has a nice pool though, I'd look elsewhere.     They did have numerous tennis courts -- perhaps 6 or 8 of them, & they looked nice.

  One very nice thing about the LVH that I've yet to experience at other hotels is that if you're like me & don't need or want maid service each day, if you let the housekeeping dept know (via phone call) that you don't want housekeeping service, you get a $7 credit coupon each day!   

  Buffet was OK for $20. Sports Book ain't all that great -- many of the TV screens were not HD.  Wifi was very good.  If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive off-Strip place, I recommend you try the LVH but I do honestly wonder if they're making enough $$ to stay open.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,4,0,4,z1SI-abHG0unyOoynYVtrg

For this trip I decided I was tired of wasting my money on a baller hotel room that I barely used and decided to book cheap here as I've stayed here when I was 21 and broke.  The hotel has significantly changed since then.  When I booked the room, they had a wide variety of rooms to reserve and their respective price points which gave you an idea that you get what you pay for.  So I went very cheap, booked their lowest priced room, no view, no freebies, nothing.

The front desk experience well, they just want you in and out before the line grows and I can't blame them, that line does get long.  I'll skip the details of what went on.  Checked into the room and it was pretty standard for any Hilton.    The room itself was very inconsistent.  It had a flat screen TV, a newer credenza but the rest of the furniture in the room didn't match, like the nightstands were from 10-years ago, the lamps were from 5-years ago, the carpet must've been changed in 2-3 years, etc.  However, the bathroom, man...talk about blast from the past!  It had the Hollywood style lights, you know, the two strips of white bulbs.  A pink countertop and a huge soaking tub/shower which was that faux marble looking crap that had to be from the 70's.  It felt like I was in that movie, ""Hot Tub Time Machine.""  Just because it looked old, I questioned it's cleanliness but that's just me.  Overall though, the room was great and the bed was super comfy, as if I've never slept any better in my life!

Oh yeah, the room safe didn't work but got charged $3.00/day for it anyways.  What a rip off.  I didn't notice it until I got the e-mailed folio but, it's not worth fighting over.

The pool area is disappointing.  They had no umbrellas or trees, not to mention the pool was quite small.

The rest of the hotel/casino was okay, it's mostly a chill, older crowd, but an oasis if you want to get away from the bustling strip.  Speaking of which, it's a little bit of a ways from the strip so you'll need a car or, just jump on the Monorail or the Deuce to find your way there.

If you do self-parking, it can be pretty hard to find a spot, especially during the evenings but, why bother with the hassle when there's free valet parking?  And PLEASE, tip the valets, they haul ass running through that 100f+ parking lot to get your car.

Overall, had a nice stay at the LVH.  I'd stay again but I'd choose a ""Deluxe"" or ""Superior"" room the next time around.",-vBbg7fTK3y8W0PtpzlLWQ,1,0,3,TkuBoCQB3gHcFUdMvfm0TA

The ceiling paint/material in the bathroom of the suite in the bathtub/shower area is peeling and exposed. There is rust or blood in the door frame area near the floor.  Not what I visualize paying $300+ a night for...

The refrigerator in (2) of the rooms are not working properly and make a loud sound to point that the guests in these rooms had to turn the fridge OFF to not be disturbed during the night.  Not ideal when you need to keep chilled water on hand during their 110 degree temps.

ALL 3 printers in the room DO NOT work properly.  We were told these amenities would be in the room and although they were present, to not have them functioning or repaired as promised is perplexing.

The A/C stopped working in one of the rooms.  I called for maintenance and it took about 2 hrs for him to arrive.  Outside temp was about 110 and when he arrived he confirmed the inside temp was about 80 degrees.  He stated that the main valve (in the ceiling was turned off during the winter and was never turned back on). He corrected the issue within 30 mins but was unable to address the fridge or printer issue.

A number of the sprinklers throughout the room are grotesquely rusted and should be replaced.

A number of elevators were not working properly in the facility so each time food was brought to the room it was cold because of the delay... When asked if there was a microwave we could use, I was informed there is not a microwave for use in the ENTIRE hotel.

We attempted to purchase a soda from the vending machine on our floor.  After paying the machine returned a 1 liter soda 1/2 empty and spilling everywhere.  I called down to the front desk and had issues with receiving a refund.  After requesting to speak to a manager due to the rudeness of the employee on the phone, he (Rodney, I believe...) stated he would apply a $40 hotel credit to our stay.  Upon checking out I was informed that did not occur.  I requested that he call me when he arrived to the hotel and I have yet to receive a call from him regarding this issue.

On several occasions housekeeping, DID NOT empty trash, vacuum, dust, wipe down counter tops, knobs, dresser, etc, restock towels or glassware when service was requested.  I understand things can get busy but with a hotel reservation costing around $2500, I am upset by the lack of service!",5Xq_WNCv0UO44khhfhOXSg,2,0,1,uYiY52vEfuUqp3PmEu_YDg

But everything I've seen when booking says it's FORMERLY the Hilton so that would lead me to believe you just read it wrong or misunderstood the word. Use this knowledge to gain more power.

The staff is awesome here. They are very kind they will probably remember your name if you stay there enough times. This is simply because it's not a huge hotel. 

The buffet is pretty good and has unlimited beer and wine for a pretty descent price. 

They have a pretty cool program called ""Go Green."" The way it works is if you don't get a housekeeper to clean your room during your visit, the hotel gives you a $10 gift card that is good toward any restaurant or the Starbucks downstairs. 

If you are going to a show at the Convention Center and you don't want deal with a lot of traffic or you don't want to pay $20 to $30 for parking, then give this hotel a try. 

If you want to head to the strip and you don't want to pay a Taxi or you don't want to drive, you can also try the Monorail. It stops at the LVH and it's only $10 per day for unlimited usage.

5085711,2012-05-30,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Elvis fan here!  I stupidly missed seeing the statue they had here but I did want to stop by to be in the hotel where Elvis performed quite often.  I did find the lobby of the show room and peeked thru the slits in between the doors to see the event space, the lined seats and stage but I didn't get to see much. But it was all kind of surreal to think of his many, many fans standing in line, climbing the stairs, buying merchandise all full of excitement.

I toured as much of the hotel as I could. I had time to kill. I bypassed the fast food station that you immediately see as you enter from the parking garage. The Wedding Chapel is then to your left and there is one room and a bridal room available. Event Planning research for me! They have special packages and you can also get married outside near a gazebo. Not the gazebo in between the hotel and the parking garage that you just came from. I confirmed that.

I then found myself at the entry way to the many ballrooms and convention center. The doors were unlocked and the place was dark and deserted. I made my way in and the amount of available space was plentiful. In one room that I walked thru, I couldn't even see the corner in the darkness. That's how large it was and how small I felt. Each room and every few 100 feet hung a great chandalier. To think of many conventions, weddings, special events and seminars occupy this space often. I did double takes at the pay phones on the walls and the many bathrooms that were available. So much stuff!

Eventually, I was done doing event planning research and taking photos of empty space and found myself playing Deuces Wild on a machine. I was waiting for the most senior cocktail waitress I've ever seen to ask if I needed anything. As she asked other people around me at other stations, she avoided me. Thanks, Lady. Thanks for nothing. I was really craving a spicy, virgin bloody mary. She deprived me. But I was doing well at the machine and cashed out with more money than I put in. Take that, LVH!

I have stayed at a few ""Hilton's"" over the years and many casinos in Vegas but had never stayed here before but my wife and I wanted to try something new.

 Apparently they don't believe in customer service at the LVH.  Maybe they didn't know that there is competition for travelers in Vegas?  They were rude from the moment we checked in until the moment we left.  The people at the front desk, the woman at the players club desk, even at the coffee shop acted like they wanted nothing to do with us.  So rude and uninterested in speaking to us.  My wife and I made it a point not to spend a penny here.  We saw shows at Ceasars Palace, and New York New York, ate at Paris, Mandalay Bay, The Flamingo, and Terribles casino.  We spent quite a bit over the last 3 days but not one penny at the LVH.  

The room was nothing special.  I've stayed at 6 different casinos now and would rate the quality of the room in the middle.  Nothing exceptional, nothing horrible about the room itself.  

When I've stayed at the Hilton in San Francisco they always treated me with such respect, the other casinos in Vegas made us feel welcome.  I would rather get a $20 room at the Palace Station than go back to the LVH.  I would rather spend a lot more at a casino that I enjoy being at then put one more penny in the pockets of the staff at LVH.

Stood in line over 30 mins to get a dirty room with 1 king side bed, that was all they had left. WTF! Shouldnt I havent gotten what I paid for? 
Went into the room, plopped on the bed, we were so tired considering we just drove 4 hours. As the day went on we notice the tub was dirty with hair it the tub. And the tub faucet would not stop running, we had to close the bathroom door. Gross. Left the room to go to the pool. Came back and heard a piecring noise. Me and my sister couldnt figure out where it was coming from. I picked up the alarm clock, messed with it for 2 mins trying to turn it off. Here is the kicker, it was UNPLUGGED, I was kind of freaked out! I opened the door and placed the damn alarm clock on the floor. An employee was walking by so I ended up giving him the alarm clock. Of course there was no way in hell we could of gotten another room due to it being sold out! The next day, Sunday found an eyelash on the ground and gum under the bed.

5124581,2012-12-01,4,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"LVH is a toss up between a 3 stars and 4 stars. I opted for 4 stars because my experience wasn't just ""ah ok"" . . . and I believe I can say I am more of a fan than not.

We were staying in Las Vegas for a family reunion and all the hotels my family prefers couldn't accommodate the size of my family (5 adults) at a reasonable price. Most hotels wanted to give us 2 rooms for about $100-$130 a night each, not awful but nothing special.

We came across a deal at LVH for a hotel suite for $124 a night which came with 3 queen beds, which was outstanding when comparing it to the offers of the other hotels. We booked 2 nights in the suite, however when we got there we opted out of the 2nd night because most of our family was heading back the next day so it would've been pointless for us to stay. They gave us no problems when it came to canceling; we didn't even have to deal with a cancellation fee which is rare.

The LVH is off the strip and probably not walking distance to the strip for most people. 

The overall hotel is quite big in my opinion; they have different towers, stores and structures which makes it feel like any other hotel on the strip. They have slots, tables, electronic poker and a sports bar. Their sports bar is probably one of the nicest I have seen in a long time. They have scoreboards nicely organized with all the bets as well as multiple big screens displaying different games. They also had individual cubicles where you can sit and research different teams and their stats. 

The Room
Our suite was far from a suite . . . it was two separate hotel rooms connected with a conjoining door in both rooms. One room was a regular King Bedroom and the other was a regular Two Queen Bedroom. Essentially we got two rooms for practically the price of one. Technically, I should have been upset because we didn't get exactly what we were promised. However, I think we ended up with something better. We were able to separate ourselves from my parents as well as have our own bathroom. 

Complaints
Like others have said on here the bathroom has a few flaws. Our showerhead was extremely weak and made it extremely hard for me to wash my hair and the drain in the tub was really slow. . . to the point were water wasn't going down in a steady flow. Normally I wouldn't complain about this but my parents noticed the same thing in their rooms.
Another issue I had with the LVH was that housekeeping came knocking at our door at 9a.m. I understand that they might want to get a head start on their day but honestly what are the chances the guest are gone at 9a.m. especially in Las Vegas. It might be a smart idea to see who checked-out before entering someones room.

Tip 
They don't have resort fees.
They give you $5 off if you ""Go Green"" by opting out of housekeeping.
It's a lot quieter than other hotels but still has the feel of a hotel on the strip.

5132770,2012-05-04,2,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Being a frequent business traveler I attend a few trade shows a year in Vegas and have been to this property many times. Especially since it is pretty much connected and right next door to the convention center it's hard to avoid. From it's days as the original Las Vegas Hilton to it's current incarnation as the LVH there is still not much for me here to really embellish on or recommend. It's one of the most boring casino properties in Vegas.

When I was here a few weeks ago I did notice some things in the casino area and bar areas had been redecorated, with a bunch of new digital slots machines on the floor, but it still has an empty drab feel to it. They used to house the Star Trek Experience here and had a space age casino designed and dedicated to it, but that is long gone and yet the shell of the casino still remains. It looks kind of weird and unfinished. The regular main casino floor is large enough with a good amount of table games along with a decently sized sports book, but there is no buzz here at all. It's like this place is still stuck in the 80's and the new regime here has it stuck in neutral. 

The times I have stayed here overnight were no big shakes either. The rooms are big enough but kind of plain. Clean but nothing to write home about. Along those lines the restaurants here are a total snoozefest. Benihana is their ""high end"" eatery - haha! Along with a lame Asian place and an even blander buffet it seems the best option to eat is their Paradise diner/cafe. Don't even ask about the almost non-existant nightlife here. The one big plus is that the monorail is close by to jump on and head to the strip with it's multitude of casino's and entertainment options.

It seems that the LVH is around mainly for convention travelers with it's convenience next to the convention center, and is normally the home base for many of the attendees and exhibitors. Still, why stay here when there are so many options along the strip in the same price point and a state of the art monorail system that can easily bring you back and forth within minutes?",YttDgOC9AlM4HcAlDsbB2A,3,5,2,8Pi46WXwMgQN4enkrZTAVg
5133051,2008-10-13,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I'd put this at about 1.5 stars, but am rounding up.  I was coming out to Vegas and had 3 nights booked at New York New York.  I had a last minute opportunity to come to Vegas 2 nights early, so I decided to look at hotel options.  Seeing that the Las Vegas hilton's price dropped from 299/night to 104/night at the last minute..I decided to help them fill the hotel.  

The hotel - I realize that this is the Las Vegas strip, and everything costs extra...but I really felt nickled and dimed at this hotel.  From the 3.50 bottled water at the pizza hut (4.00 in the room), to the 13.99/night internet, to the 6.75 bottles of beer at the bar.  The bright spot was the free parking, though that seems to be fairly standard out here.   The star trek experience was closed down... which was disappointing even though I'm not a trekkie.  The location of the hotel is not ON the strip... It's either a short walk, or a monorail ride away.

As a hilton diamond member, I received a room ""upgrade"".  Apparently the upgrade only gave me a bigger tv, and a more comfortable bed.  Considering the VERY limited channel selection, the big tv was rather pointless...though the bed was quite cozy.

The room - I liked the great water pressure in the shower.  I also thought the ""hydraulic toilet seat"" was a nice touch.  However, the negatives outweighed the positives.  The shower was designed for midgets.  The showerhead was literally at chest height for me... and I'm only about 6 feet tall !!!!.  Squatting while showering is NOT a comfortable experience.   The weather was rather chilly during my stay, and the heater didn't work worth a darn.  It literally took about 5 hours to get the room to a comfortable temperature with the heat cranked to maximum.  The windows were so dirty that it looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in years.  I realize that dust blows around in the desert, but it certainly shouldn't be THAT bad.  Add in the long wait for elevators in my tower, and it made the entire experience less than desirable.  Thank goodness I'm headed to another hotel, and am not relying on this place for my entire stay.",bE080rkVJZjGF_xjvniwSQ,0,0,2,gDeAgZXAU2PiLZUNo4Xp9g
5135141,2011-11-18,2,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"My first visit to Las Vegas -- my first time inside ANY casino -- was my stay at the Las Vegas Hilton.  This was a while ago.  Back when TI was called Treasure Island and they had pirates out front instead of sluts.  Back when Bellagio was still kinda new.

Back then, the Hilton was reasonable enough and offered something to warm over any geek (like myself) who needed a reason to even stand in Las Vegas:  Star Trek:  The Experience.  Yes... the Hilton had a Trek thing and Trek casino on the premises.  There to reassure my generation that, yup, Vegas likes YOU too.  

It was fun staying at the Hilton at that point, comforting to know I wasn't on the big bad ominous STRIP.  And this is coming from someone who lived 4 years in Brooklyn, okay?

But then years passed and return trips taught me something.  The STRIP doesn't need to be in capital letters.  Like it's a SCARY place.  It's actually a safe fun BLAST if I must use all caps for something.  And so why in the freaky-deaky world --

-- would you intentionally stay off the strip?  The hotel better be worth it, right?  Something extra special and extra different.  Or why bother?

Having recently visited the Las Vegas Hilton again, the best way I can put this is:  don't.  It's less than nothing special.  I actually found it very depressing.  The old girl has seen her last day, and unless she drops into Deep Space Nine for a retrofit, the bitch needs to be de-commissioned.

Why do I say depressing?

First of all, that funky and fun Trek casino that was on the premises warped out some time ago.  That's okay.  I can forgive that.  What I can't forgive is that they left half of it behind.  Out of good ol' cheap laziness.  So if you drift around the casino enough, you'll find a slot machine 'spot' housed inside half of what was the Trek exhibit.  It's... bizarre.  They could have turned it into a futuristic bar of sorts if they really needed to 'keep' some of the metal and glass crap from the Trek thing.  But no, that would cost $$$$... wouldn't it?  And so they essentially did nothing.

The Hilton offers a host of cheezy Vegas singer/impersonator types.  They perform in this teeny tiny showroom that houses no more than 50 people at once.  Yes, that's right, nothing says you're about to see an amazing act than a theater that holds 50 people in it.  50 entire people.  To glock how depressing this is, know that the Hilton -- JUST THE HILTON -- houses over 3000 rooms.  

The night I was recently there, they slid a wall away from this showroom to show you what you were missing.  Yes, right off the casino, a line of people who didn't pay to see some fool 'croon' were watching the 'spectacle.'   Some guy who's miserable job was to come out and pretend to be 1/1000th as popular as Wayne Newton.  It made me want to become an alcoholic just watching him.

My partner in crime and I ended up seeing comedian Gilbert Godfried there.  In that same room of 50 or less people.  That was populated by two middleaged greasy photographers with bad hair and worse suits trying to take your picture for big bucks... in an age where everyone carries digital cameras... in a room a showroom about as special as Wayne World's basement.  DEPRESSING.

And if this wasn't depressing enough, Gilbert was terrible.  Looked like an amateur.  And I really like this guy.

Need more?  You must be a glutton for punishment like me.  One of the 'big deal' restaurants in the Hilton is a Benihauna.  Yes, I enjoy Teppan Grill, but you can kinda get it anywhere these days.  True, you can't a Beni like the Hilton has... a giant village setting where you actually feel like you're in old Japan -- but the night I walked in there was a big hole in the ceiling.  Signs asking patrons to forgive the leaking water.  We walked out faster than we walked in --

-- which is just what I'm recommending YOU do.

If you need affordable rooms in an okay resort, try NYNY and MONTE CARLO on the strip.  They're less depressing, have more life to 'em, and are ON the strip.",h-brvh9UKmAOKb0Q-VZpgg,0,1,2,fAQGwK0J38s3rnqL89849Q

I am sure when Elvis lived her this was THE PLACE to be but it's not that anymore. I was in town for a convention at Bally's but didn't want to stay there as I wanted to stay at HHonors property. This place made sense because it's on the Las Vegas Monorail. I was happy with that as it felt like I was catching the subway to ""work"" every morning. I liked it and it helped me save a ton of money on cabs around Vegas. 

The hotel is massive and the casino  is nice.

Did not like this hotel at all. They charge for EVERYTHING. You would think coffee of all things, but no. There's a Keurig and next to that are 2 cups wrapped in plastic with the kcup inside I assume, $3.50. Water on the dresser was $4 I believe, seems free at first but read the note fully to not be fooled! 

I had the upgraded room with a fridge and pillow top mattresses in the north tower. I'm not sure if it's renovated since this used to be a Hilton, but I'm not impressed. Paint looks terrible in the restroom, scuff marks on the walls, there's a knob missing on one of the drawers. What really got me was the water pressure in the shower though, just sorry.

With the required resort fee you have to pay you're able to connect one device to the wifi. I had my wii with me and was ready to watch some Netflix. It didn't work so I called tech support & didn't get anywhere. I wouldn't be surprised if there's some kind of limit on how much capacity your device can have so you can connect to the wifi.

5158630,2011-11-07,2,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"Never again.  This place is supposed to be a 3-star property; not even close.  The rates were pretty good for the property & we wanted to stay at a place that was close to a friend who lives just across the way, but this was not what I signed up for.  Driving up, you definitely get the sense that the property is pretty damn old but I figured the rooms would probably be in a somewhat renovated state.  Nope.  

Well, apparently some of the suites have been updated but not the standard rooms.  I only know that the suites were renovated because when we checked in, we were assigned to a room on the 28th floor that turned out to be the middle section of a suite.  The room looked spacious with a full dining table, couch, flat screen TV, etc., but because it had no bed we immediately called the front desk and asked to be moved.  

We were reassigned to a room on the 25th floor which had a bed but looked like a total dump.  The curtains couldn't be opened because the curtain hangers or whatever were broken so the whole time our curtains had to be kept closed.  The flatscreen TV in the room appeared decent enough until we turned it on:  static-y/grainy ala a poor college kid's set where you have a TV but no cable service.

We decided not to ask for a different room or upgrade since we figured our trip would be short & we wouldn't be in the room all that much.  So the next morning we find out we have some ghetto ass LOUD neighbors who start yelling and hooting and hollering as though they are having a party at 8:30 a.m.  The room walls weren't all that solid to begin with (as clearly evident from the fact that as we were walking down the hall we could hear a woman who was clearly having what I can only imagine was an amazing orgasm) but the yelling and screaming sounded like we didn't even have a wall between us.  

So we leave the hotel in the morning to meet up with friends and have brunch, etc., and return to find that housekeeping never stopped by during the several hours we were out.  Awesome.  So we had to call housekeeping and specifically request that our room be turned.  Never had to do that before.  

I will never return to the property unless there's a significant remodel done to the entire place which is highly unlikely.  Next time, no matter how short the stay, I intend on just spending the money to stay at a decent property.

I come here to get outside and enjoy myself or go gambling until 9am without having to sell a kidney and I get all of that here. Now let me also say, I'm a bit boogie when it comes to my hotel preferences so I'm not all about cost. I have realistic standards and understand the concept of ""you get what you pay for"" but I have NEVER gone wrong with LVH. 

I'm not a big gambler so I love being here where the tables are hot but not incredibly expensive to join. There are a lot of options on the machines which is great for me because I love the penny machines, lol. 

Its right off the strip and not on a street that is too hectic or in the hub of all the traffic, I don't care for any of that. I had bad customer service at the check in counter once but I attribute that to the lady who had a bad attitude and not the overall service at the hotel. When I requested toothpaste they had it to me very quickly which lets be honest, is kind of a big deal because no one goes out of their room with a hot mouth (let's hope not!)

The room itself was very comfortable and didn't make me feel cheap. Now I understand this place isn't flashy like other hotels but I don't spend most of my time in my room, that's not why you come to Vegas! But when I am done with my daily adventure or need to rejuvenate I want to feel that I'm lying on clean sheets, the room is comfortable and I can relax.

5 stars because, as a players club member, they treat me FAR better than the rate they charge. As a road warrior who spends a lot of time in Vegas, the LVH is fantastic. By far the best Casino Hosts for someone who does not gamble a whole lot. I get treated like a King and that makes my Vegas grind so much better. 

Over the years I have stayed at pretty much every hotel on the strip. Unless you gamble heavily, most hotels have no love for you. The LVH is the exception but they are a little off the strip. Not an issue for me since I'm there for work , first and foremost. 

I highly recommend road warriors stay here and get yourself a player club card. Gamble a little on the slot machines or tables, to let them know you're alive, and then on your next trip, get a casino host assigned to you and milk them for upgrades. Often times, since vacancy is higher in the ""off strip"" hotels, I have been able to get awesome upgrades for standard rates. After calling on customers all day, who doesn't want to come home to a pimped out suite? 

Bottom line is that since the LVH came out of bankruptcy, they have proven loyal to the customers that are loyal to them. The old school Hilton feel is alive and well here, and unless that changes, they have earned my undying patronage. 

Gambling: My goal is to catch a good beer buzz off the free booze before I run out of chips. I also want to have a good time while losing my paycheck. The LVH has always done me right in this regard. Seriously,  the greatest dealers and pit bosses out there. I always have a good time.

Food: Meh. Sports book deli is pretty much it for late night. The buffet is adequate. Vince Neals' place is ok. The steak house is good. The rest are predictable chain restaurants.  Not amazing but they don't suck either.

Sports Book: If you like sports betting, this is a great choice. Best sports book in Vegas overall. 

Rooms: In over 50 nights stayed, I've never had an issue with cleanliness or maintenance issues.  And as someone who stays in hotels a lot, I do a thorough check for all manner of nasties and bugs.

Rates: I get mailers all the time from the LVH. My rate is usually around $20 with the rare exception that a big event is in town and they have a high expected occupancy. Yes there are resort fees and Internet charges, but it's still $40 cheaper than the next closest hotel.

5217193,2013-07-26,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I stayed here at least 6 times before it changed ownership to LVH and once afterwards it changed to LVH but apparently before they decided to charge $18 resort fee as others have mentioned. Previously during those 6 times, I booked the room for between $15-35 with no resort fee and even while paying such cheap prices, it's still not that great for LAS VEGAS due to competition. The hotel is located near the convention center which is convenient for business travelers but extremely inconvenient for anyone else. The driveway to the lobby is beautiful but very very pointless as you can get lost going the wrong way and driving mindlessly with wasted travel. This was probably designed back in the day when the hilton was a premier hotel and it helped to have a long driveway to the lobby for longer queues of taxi's. The positives are that it used to be cheap and have no resort fee along with easy access to the convention center. The negatives will take awhile. Since it changed ownership, it's no longer cheap and they now charge a resort fee which the hilton as big as it is knew that they HAD to charge no resort fee to attract people though apparently the new ownership is banking on tricking travelers into 'thinking' it's a new hotel or a state of the art renovation of which it's neither. The parking lot SEEMS conveniently located but once you park and start walking, you realize the parking lot is set up at the far far far side of the hotel lobby/room elevators so that you'll be forced to walk by the shops. The decor inside is old which other las vegas hotels have but don't charge what the LVH charges. Fortunately I drive but for anyone that doesn't drive, they're forced to either take ripoff taxi's or even worse, the tourist monorail that charges for 1 way, the same as a all day pass in nyc. Access to restaurants is pretty bad as I'm a active searcher for good food and I was LUCKY to find a place relatively nearby as the next nearest reasonable food was 2 miles away. If you don't like authentic Thai(not americanized thai crap) or casual local filipino restaurants, then you'll have to travel for food or starve. 

It's unfortunate but I think the new management decided to keep the hotel in bad shape and not bother with customer service while instead hosting more events in the convention center which would guaranteed customers who want convenience and all the while, charge premiums in the room for unsuspecting first time stayers. Basically like advertising a movie in a trailer as something it's not and not caring if you don't like it because they already made 10 bucks off of you. If you're looking for hotels that are inexpensive and comparable, gold coast is a no brainer, cheap rooms, well maintained, lots of restaurants inside, good gambling and not to mention, if you get bored...you can walk across the street to the RIO or the Palms.

I've already heard some negative situations regarding this management that are bordering a lawsuit so hopefully with enough negative feedback, they will be forced to either close shop or actually give a crap about their customers.",hBJeLyJeFSmDK-zXbdDLzw,3,0,1,ZHxJiA7yhCu98XeOTsqiTA

I got a great rate for a standard room on getaroom.com. When I checked in I was given the keys to room 2109 in the Central Tower, which is what I paid for, standard. When I got up to my room, I was thoroughly disappointed, It was one of the older rooms that had not been upgraded. I tried to talk myself into toughing it out, but after about 15 minutes I decided I couldn't take it. I went back downstairs and got an upgraded room for an additional $ 20 a night and it was well worth it. The upgraded rooms are par for the course for a Las Vegas 4 star hotel. The rooms are spacious and clean and it has a number of restaurants to choose from. It's only a block away from the Strip and is a very comfortable stay. When you book, avoid booking just a standard room and if you get room 2109 in the Central Tower immediately ask for an upgraded room.

With the discounted room, they offered $100 worth of dining vouchers...which were pretty useless, considering the 25% discount locals get with the players card ALWAYS was a better deal...

The room was huge, and was nice enough, for what amounted to about $60 a night.  The shower sucked, and the bathroom was TINY.

The place is still pretty low-rent and dirty.  My shower had grime caked into the floor, my heating did not work (it was historically cold when we went), the doors and walls were thin enough to hear everything outside... it was disgusting.

The rooms do have brand new 42"" LG LCD's. TV remote died during the stay. So I called the Housekeeping people (who fix things, etc.) and they didn't even know what TV I had.

Didn't even say enjoy your stay or anything.She didn't tell us about amenities of the hotel or tell us where anything was located.  I just knew that was a bad impression first off. When we arrived at the room, there were pillows n a comforter both with feathers and we were checked into a non-smoking floor. I was pretty upset so i called downstairs to get everything changed. I was on hold for 15 mins just to talk to the operator.. It took 2 hours to get new keys to our room. We went to our new room and still.. MORE FEATHERED PILLOWS... I called downstairs and was very pissed at this point. The housekeeper that answered the phone was very rude. I asked her about how long it would take the get the hypo-allergenic pillows to my room which in the first place i requested in our room.. She said about 20 mins.. I said ok, I explained the situation to her w/ my request in the first place and all she said was. DO YOU WANT THE PILLOWS OR NOT! I couldn't believe that she would give me (the guest) So much attitude... 1 1/2 hrs later, the pillows showed up... The following day, I called housekeeping again to request some fresh towels. 3 hrs later, they showed up.. I was so irritated with how bad their service was I was ready to check out. The day that we checked out.. I went up to the counter and yes, the same GSA that checked us in was there to check us out.. She didn't ask how everything was or how our stay was.. She just yelled very loudly.. YOU HAVE A 0 BALANCE SO YOUR SET TO GO... Everyone in line looked at us and I was very embarrassed.

Well first of all, the hotel itself wasn't too bad.  I stayed in the standard and the premium room, and for some reason, the standard room was slightly better (better tub, bigger room space, awesome hollywood style mirror, although they had an awkwardly raised toilet).  The only thing better about the premium room was the mini fridge which we kept stocked with drinks from the AM/PM across the street (hey, it's HOT here in July!) and the unraised toilet (yes it bothered me that much).  But the beds here are amazing!  I didn't want to get up most of the time...  But like other yelpers said, they have some major drainage issues (took at least 5 minutes after my shower for all the water to drain).

But now the reason why this hotel sucks.  They overbooked and wanted me to go to a hotel down the street the first night... uh, no.  So we stayed and got $20 credited (except no one told us that it was a food credit for use in the hotel only, until we asked about it on our day of checkout and two managers later, they told us that it was a food credit).  Kind of sucks because we ate at Benihana's, Superbook Deli, and Fortuna and didn't know to charge it to our room for the stupid credit.

I also had issues with their food and service manger Karen.  Basically my boyfriend and I like late night snacks, so we kept going to the Superbook Deli.  They're supposed to serve a ""special menu"" after 1am, and the normal menu until then, yet when we came at 12:50am, 12:40am, and 12:25am on different nights and they said they can only serve us the special menu.  Fed up after the THIRD NIGHT in a row, we called the manager (Karen), who had us on hold for ten minutes before answering only to rudely say ""oh, they're not supposed to serve you at all until 1am so just be glad you got any food.""  Uhh, the place is freaking open 24 hours and yet that special time between 12am-1am isn't part of 24 hours?  I'm not stupid, so don't treat me like I am.  Kind of disappointing, because the food was really good and pretty cheap.

Some of the rooms are renovated.  They'll try to upsell you a renovated room when you get there.  The regular rooms are dated, but ok.  This isn't a 5 star strip hotel.  If you're here, you probably got a deal, or saw the dirt low price.  The resturaunts are good, and the buffet is average.  The sports book is maaaasssssiiivvveee.  

See that dirt-low price?  Yeah, so did everyone else.  The place is now loaded with lower-end people.  I saw two fights with security the last time I was there; one involving no less then 5 security officers. (Jan 2014)

So, yeah, the Fremont crowd found this hotel.  Friday and Sat nights is Latino club night; the band is actually good if your in a Spanish mood.

5466132,2011-01-09,3,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"This actually used to be one of my favorite hotel/casinos back in the day.  Oh, how things have changed.

There are some goods, however.  If you are a conventioneer, you have instant and direct walking access to the main convention center.  But don't think about parking here for said conventions.  $30 a day for parking, Hilton?  Seriously?  That's robbery.  And greed.

The biggest disappointment is the killing off of Star Trek: The Experience over two years ago.  Despite this place being off-Strip, I made it a point to go here because they had such a fun and unique attraction here.  It would be one thing if they had something in mind to replace it, but either poor planning or the economy.... It's dead, Jim. 

The ""Space Lounge"" is still there.  An entire casino area with a heavy sci-fi theme to it.  Except there's no casino here.  It's a huge space themed area with a ghost town bar, no slots, a few couches, a makeshift stage, beer signs, and a few remnants of Star Trek themes.  All of this space, and nothing.  No life to it.  Couches and beer signs only make the emptiness and waste of the area seem more empty and pathetic.

With their main draw gone, what has replaced it as the headliner?  Benihana's.  Nothing wrong with the restaurant, but it's hardly unique or exclusive, even in Vegas.  The Hilton has a Pizza Hut Express here too.  Maybe they should promote that as their ""big draw"" on the marquee as well.  A huge Benihana sign covers up the old entrance to Star Trek.  With couches pushed in front of the entryway.  Again, just sad, and I'll be a big man in saying that they kind of broke my heart getting rid of one of my most beloved hang-outs here.

The arcade is dead as well.  Another blanketed off space that sits and collects dust.  Again, with two-plus years, no suitable replacement has been found for anything in this section.  A few shops that fluctuate, but that's it.  This is a lot of dead space to go unused.  

There's also the issue of the Men's bathroom in the main casino area.  Above every urinal is a picture of a lust-crazed girl staring over your bits with a camera, magnifying glass, tape measure, etc, while you pee.  The first time I saw this, it was ""ha ha"" funny, then when the laughter died, it just turned creepy and weird for me.  I actually selected a urinal based off which girl creeped me out the least.  She merely looked like she was casting spells at my nethers.  I could live with that.

Ladies: I must know.  Is there something like this in the girl's restroom?  When you close the stall door to do your business, is there a picture of some crazed guy making grabbing motions where your boobs would be?  Please message me and let me know.  I'd really like to know what the Hell you get in your bathroom after my gender's discovery.

As critical as I am being, there looks to be some sort of steampunk-themed club called ""Triumph"" there.  I want to check this out.  Atonement for the death of my beloved Warp Core Breach booze bowl?  We'll see, but it's going to have to be pretty good to replace the hole in my heart from that much booze for so cheap a price.

The sad part is, Hilton's one of those ""history rich"" casinos here.  Look up the history on this place.  A lot of awesome stars and vintage Vegas stuff happened here, which makes you wonder why this isn't represented more.

This place is great for convention visitors to stay, but that's about it as far as I can see.  They need to figure themselves out for everything else.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,5,4,2,NHQWhZve7UEaGLt7IwAyDw

Came here for a work conference- really wished I had booked elsewhere.  First I was given what I assume to be a classic room- next to the elevator bank.  The check lady informed me it was somehow the only non-smoking room left (in the middle of 100+ degree August?!) but that I could check back the following day to be switched.  The room smelled like smoke despite being a non- smoking room and I couldn't sleep with the racket the creaky elevators gave off all night.  The final straw came when I realized after taking a shower the next morning that the room didn't even have a hair dryer.  Got moved to another room- away from the elevator and yay, with a hair dryer!  Unfortunately, somehow didn't have hot water so I ended up taking an icy cold shower and needing to turn on the heat while it was 100+ degrees outside.

Room quality was not great on top of everything else.  Place feels old and run down- carpet is the type you don't want to walk barefoot on.  I hit up Expedia during the conference to see if I could find a cheap room in another hotel to switch to and found out LVH rooms were going for as low as $35!!  More than my org was paying for me but I would put the room value around that much.

Why is it that when your friends come into town unannounced they assume that you always have the time to hang out with them and gamble.  This happened to me today and I did have some time to spend but not as much as they'd like.  Just because I live in Las Vegas it doesn't mean that I am at the casino everyday.  

Okay, sorry, I am back now and here is my review of LVH.

As I was saying before, a friend of mine just showed up and wanted me to come out and hit the town with him before he left this evening.  So, we met up at LVH.  It isn't too far out of my way.  Now, I have lived in Vegas for a while and I have yet to step foot in this Casino.  And, this is my impression:

This must be the best place to stay if you are attending a convention as it is really close.

The parking structure was easy and plentiful.  I walked in and then began my hike to find the casino itself.  Walking by many shops, mini food court, bars and a club.  I like how it was spread out.  But, the casino was much further away than I expected.  I'm not big on the table games so I decided to get a players card.

The woman, who helped me out was great.  Not a big talker but was really efficient at her job.  She explained how to use the card and within 5 minutes I was off.  I liked that they gave me free money to start off with $15.  What a great deal for just signing up.  

We played for a while and then I had to get back to work.  I'll be back, when I have more time to spend.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,0,1,3,pBWT__S4Vb4gHfY9NrYT8Q

Back to smells. In my room it smelled like cigs, sewage, mildew. The variety changes overtime so it makes you think about the filtration or piping in the system. This company needs to revamp its HVAC system.

I got two rooms separated in different levels, one was 8; another one was 27, and I needed to request again for the baby crib. When I asked how would it be, the guy (front desk) said ""ask your travel agent, I don't know"" and when I asked if he was able to arrange the rooms at least on the same level... he said nothing was available, and the crib would be put on the system!

We had he do not disturb sign on the door because we didn't want to have to put our stuff away yet. We go out, come back 1.5 hours later, get cleaned up and head downstairs to wait for the in-laws before we left for our activites. We decided to put some money in the machines while we wait. My husband put money in, I grab my wallet to get some cash.....I'm wiped clean. 

I know if you're reading this you migh think that I was probably drunk and just lost everything on my own because in Vegas that's what happens right? No. I'm from Vegas so I know how to act and can recall every step from the night before to know for a fact that when we went to bed that night I had $150 in cash in my wallet. We went straight up to the room, searched everywhere just to be safe, and yes it was not there. 

My husband went to the front desk, they called security who came up to our room to investigate. He at first said ""So you know there was a safe you could use but you chose not to use it?"" First of all, I don't want ANYTHING stolen, so that's what locking the room is for, and my laptop wouldn't fit in the safe so I just have to not bring it just to make sure it's not stolen? And then he said ""well we have signs on our doors and in the closets saying that we are not liable for anything lost or stolen. Really!?!?! So apparently this is an issue of yours, that you have to post it. 

My husband said that when we left the room there was a maid in the hallway so the only thing I can think of is she saw us leave, saw us put the sign on the door and noticed I didn't have my wallet or purse on me so she assumed it was in the room. I hope she needed that money more than us because that is so disgusting and I can't even fathom the idea of someone doing that.

So let's start out with the good things...

The price would have to be the best thing it has to offer. $30/night.  Secondly, the bed was pretty good we had one of the upgraded rooms in the North Tower. The gym was decent. We got the resort package which was $40 a day. It seemed like it was worth it if you like unlimited beer/wine/cookies. It also included the gym/spa. They had a coffee machine which was broken and only had drip. So no cappucino/lattes. If you have an event at the convention center, this hotel is extremely convenient. I suppose this hotel would be good for you if you are one of those people that are always late. The monorail is next to the hotel. And that's about it for me with the good things...

Now to my things that I didn't like. When you have ghetto prices you get ghetto people. Go figure. The pool was filled with kids. I am not a kid. 
You know, its the details that make or break these hotels. The plasma TV was nice. BUT NO HDTV???? FUCK. FURTHERMORE THESE ASSHOLES BLOCK THE INPUT IN THE TV!! So, you can't connect your ipod/media player to watch your stuff. FUCK. I hated that the default setting on the TV stretched the 4:3 to 16:9 weirdly. These assholes have the balls to charge $13 per day per laptop for Internet. WTF? Thank GOD I have my wifi hotsopt. 

The lighting in the room was dim because they are stingy with the lighting. They have those compact florescent light bulbs. They are sooo ghetto that the light bulbs aren't even covered to look normal bulbs. The a/c in the room was obscenely loud. I called them to fix it and the guy shows up an hour later. I forgot that I called him! I hated the shower because I was taller than the shower head and I am 5'11"". I further despised the shower because it was dark in the shower because these tight asses didn't put a light in the shower area.

They give you a bunch of coupons, but with restrictions. I got excited when I first got a drink coupon but it had restrictions: no Grey goose, no name brand drinks. Jeez. It was also good for beer/wine. This place is in need of some major makeover. The Benihana looks like when they first built the hotel 30+ years ago.

Our biggest issue was the big mix up with our reservations - they didn't really honor what we had reserved and stuffed us into a one bedroom room when we requested two beds.

After that, there was a guy who tried to sell us a timeshare so we said no to that. We got to our room and were pretty happy. As I was unpacking, there were these loud ppl in the room next to us yelling and screaming. A couple minutes later security knocks on our door telling us someone was a complaint. We told them we just got there 5 minutes ago and that it was the other room. After they left, a couple minutes later we get a call from the front desk of the complaint. We told them that it wasn't us, so they moved us to a different room. They upgraded us to a Jr. Suite on the 27 floor (I think...) which was pretty cool (besides having to repack and move to a different room). It had a king bed and couch, which was much more roomy.

The only problems I had after was: a temporary outage on some light switches, the dripping faucet in the bathroom... and the fact that we were asked to keep our voices down since the hotel has a more older crowd that stays there. Ahem?! It's Vegas, isn't it? ...
The good things were: close to elevators (which were also close to the parking), free coupons for various things in the hotel, and... the monorail! It travels through the strip which saved us gas $ and time (pretty cheap compared to taxi).

I'd say I may or may not stay here again if I visited Vegas again. It was cheap so that's an important factor to me. But... I'm pretty young and only live once so there are plenty of Vegas strip hotels I could be staying at, too.",4pa5VXneosQXDnniYDGh2Q,0,1,3,KWTbmUvwUb_GvqeiG6vnYw

The next day our toilet overflowed and we called housekeeping. We wait 20 minutes, meanwhile we all haven't taken showers and there's water everywhere.

5641025,2013-06-15,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"We stayed here over the Labor day weekend as standard rooms in the hotel were available at a reasonable rate even at the last minute, reasons for which would become clear when we actually reached the place - its pretty beat up, dilapidated and run down.

Checking in took under 10 minutes even though there were tons of people waiting before us so not much to complain here.

The hotel is a good 12-15 minute leisurely walk to the strip from the hotel with no restaurants immediately outside the hotel apart from an ampm store attached to an arco gas station. We ended up eating most of our meals at the food court of the Riviera which is located on Las Vegas Blvd - this turned out to be a pain with about 20 minutes of walking as we could not take our car due to lack of parking on the strip.

The self service car park is not directly attached to the hotel but is a good 3-5 minutes walk from the hotel itself which was a pain. 

The hotel itself is very run down. Right of the bat the lever for the shower in the room was locked so tight that we were not able to get it to budge and had to call someone from maintenance to get it to move. Then it would not turn off and water kept dripping into the tub making a noise the entire day. When we complained, maintenance came and just tightened the lever back to the tight position rather than fixing the problem which meant another call to maintenance when we wanted to use the shower. Water in the sink would not drain normally and took almost 45 minutes to seep out slowly which gave a gross feeling. The air conditioning unit did not have a proper thermostat for control but only allowed for setting the fan speed from low to high which had no effect on the cooling it was hot during the day and chilled during night. On the second day all of a sudden the room refused to let me in with my key and then it was a treck down to the reception to get another key and guess what that also refused to work so it was back down to the reception where they simply apologized and gave me another key, but by now I knew what to expect and refused to budge till they called security to escort me to the room as it was my third trip. The people at the reception did not think that was required but I stood my ground - finally I'm sure you would have guessed by now that the key did not work even the third time and security had to override the lock to let me in and call the locksmith to have that fixed. So overall was not a very comfortable stay. 

Cleaning is done between 9-10 a.m. and if you skip that you can get a $8 coupon to be used in the casino or for some food but you need to call and let them know the night before. 

They provide water bottles and coffee in the room ($4 each) which I liked specially the coffee as there is no place to grab that near the hotel early in the morning.

Overall this would not be my first choice when selecting a hotel near the strip and I would prefer the Stratosphere, but it was not terrible considering that we got it at the last minute during peak time at a reasonable rate.",HdrdiwMYkhWI49lmNPeziA,2,1,2,TWqU0UEBhZeBn_uGpNH3Dg

5658558,2012-07-01,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"First of all let me say that while I am giving the LVH 4 stars, this is NOT a 4-star hotel. It is a 3 star hotel, maybe 3 1/2 tops, but I am giving them 4 stars for a few reasons.

You probably already know this by now, but the LVH is the Las Vegas Hilton (convention center) rebranded. The slogan is ""Same Fame, New Name."" The slogan should be ""New Name, Same Everything Else."" Literally nothing has changed in the 6 months since they changed the name. If you were blind folded when you walked into the hotel and didn't see the sign outside, when you took the blind fold off inside you would never know that you weren't in the Hilton. That's not necessarily a bad thing, just a fact.

They didn't remodel the rooms at all, but the Hilton rooms were fine. Good sized, clean enough, average bed. The only issue I have ever had with the Hilton/LVH's rooms is that they are almost all adjoining rooms. I don't like that as adjoining rooms are noisier but when I ask for a non-adjoining room I am told that the only non-adjoining rooms are by the elevators and you get extra elevator sounds. That is pretty sad. So just hope you don't get someone with kids in the adjoining room.

Now the things I really like about the LVH, I almost always get discounted rooms there. I am a gambler and as a result get good prices. Last trip I paid $40 a night on the weekend! Try finding that deal anywhere else in Vegas. Additionally, they give you a ""green"" option where you can turn down maid service and as a thank you they give you $10 a day food vouchers for any restaurant/buffet. As a result, for me at least, the LVH is a damned good deal and I can save my money for other things like the slot machines.

The LVH also gets brownie points for being one of the few hotels in Vegas where it doesn't take you 30 minutes to walk from your car to your room or to the casino. Most casinos make you walk through all their restaurants and stores to get to the casino. Not the LVH. Especially if you park in the back by the sports book. You are literally right there! Also, because it's not on the strip, traffic around the hotel isn't the zoo that it is at a lot of places. It's very easy to get in and out of the hotel.

As for the casino, it has a good mix of slot machines with most, but unfortunately not all, of the newest games. They also have a good selection of table games but sadly no poker room. The sports book is nice and large with every betting option you can imagine. They also have a special smoke free area where you can hang out and watch a game.

The pool area is nice. It's not on par with any of the bigger hotels, but again, it costs a lot less so if you really want the trendy kick ass pool party feel free to go somewhere else and pay three times as much.

Oh yeah, the LVH has a monorail station too, making it easy to get to the strip without driving.

If you are a first time visitor to Vegas I would suggest paying more and staying on the strip to get the full Vegas experience. If you are a Vegas regular the LVH is a great affordable option where you can save some money and have a stress free stay, but still be able to go do everything you want to do.",pS0h-b_aWVm-drm880T01w,8,1,4,KoeA83ntdxcdR7wkD8rQ1w

Pros:
-Nice rooms with different room types at a really good price. Hotel is in good shape because it used to be a Hilton
-Around the corner from the strip saves you on traffic drama but still close enough to everything if you have a car. If no car, there is a monorail station

Tip
- classic room is the entry level type of room and it has flat screen TV and that is the best part about it after the cheap cost

5682127,2014-07-14,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I live here in Vegas and good friends came to stay at the LVH (now the Westgate) and I met up with them (at the hotel) for two days during their stay.

The good:

The Vince Neil Cantina (in the hotel) serves truly excellent food. (I will be writing a review regarding that experience.)

My friend, as well as her husband, stated that their bed was comfortable.

Their room did have a small refrigerator in the bar console. (*Disclosure notice: The refrigerator was there, probably, because they had an upgraded room. I doubt that all of the rooms have a refrigerator....)


The bad:

The AC was blasting and made the room really, really cold. The temperature could not be adjusted in order to make the room a comfortable temperature. My friend resorted to wrapping herself up in a blanket in order to be comfortable. For the duration of their (several day) stay - she wore a sweatjacket whilst in their room.

When (on the very rare occasions) the AC *did* shut off - it sounded like someone was kicking the door in. I heard this happen, twice. Everyone in the room jumped when it happened (both times).

The showers did not offer hot water more times than not. My friend had reported the issue (and she had mentioned being able to have one shower with hot water) - but, for the rest of their stay it was cold shower central.

A brown flotsom was discovered in their shower stall. My friend could not determine the cause of the foam with brown specks in it residing near the drain of their shower. (It had bubbled up through the drain pipes...but the reason for that happening was unclear.)

The restaurants have really strange, inconvenient hours. Considering that Vegas is a 24-hour town...it was incredibly difficult to find a restaurant in which to eat at 9:00 p.m. - and, again, around 5:00 p.m. (Those times are pretty reasonable. I was shocked to discover that most of the LVH/Westgate restaurants were not open for meals during those time frames.)

The ugly:

The casino floor (which you have to walk through in order to get to the convention center, shops and restaurants) is absolutely filled with smoke. The worst I've experienced in *any other* hotel, anywhere. On (or off) The Strip. I doubt that filtration units are being put into service, at all.

There was a loud, drunken exchange outside their room at 3:00 in the morning (which awakened everyone in their family) during their stay. They were there for an event in which they had to be awake, early - so the drunken exchange should have been attended to by Security. But it wasn't. The drunken brawlers did (finally) exit the area of their own accord...but they never should have been allowed to disturb hotel guests for as long as they did. Hotel Security needs to be improved.

There is a $3.50 charge for a cup service package (drinking cup, Keurig K cup and, more than likely, creamer and sugar). At $3.50 PER CUP I can assure you that no one opened a package in order to discover exactly what was inside the coffee cup service package. With LVH/Westgate charging $3.50 (per cup) for hotel room coffee - it could be argued that the ""free"" drinks served to gamblers in Las Vegas casinos are no longer the most expensive drinks in town. $3.50 for room coffee is highway robbery. Most of the hotels offer a coffee pot along with free packages of regular--and decaffeinated--coffee. It is absolutely stunning that LVH/Westgate grossly overcharges what should be (and is, anywhere else in Vegas...) a basic room amenity.

There is a $14.50 charge (per person, per device) for WiFi. Again...this charge is highway robbery. Most of the hotels offer free WiFi. *Motels* sometimes charge for WiFi service (but even they charge a much lower rate) ... But you are not paying motel prices to stay at the LVH/Westgate.

The name of the hotel was changed just prior to the arrival of my friends - and they were not made aware of the change ahead of their arrival. In this day and age - the hotel should have (at the very least) sent their incoming hotel guests an email letting them know of the change. Not one of their guests were made aware of the change until they arrived, confused, at their hotel - the hotel which carried an entirely new name on the (small) marquee and no name at all on the large marquee. LVH/Westgate's marketing/branding regarding this takeover needed to be handled better and more gracefully than what (clearly) ended up happening. 

Overall (and all things considered) LVH/Westgate services, room, staff and amenities are not what one would expect when staying at a Las Vegas Strip resort. I have visited (as well as stayed at) many Las Vegas hotels on the Strip (and off). I would never recommend staying at this hotel. I think there are far better options available for consumers, trade show attendees, conference attendees and tourists. (Though I will say, again, that the Vince Neil Cantina has truly awesome food. That restaurant is well worth visiting. Just choose a different hotel in which to stay....)",0U5YWSWTlKVYkF3EJIrC2w,2,0,2,yxv39CRBfdkPY6spfVvNyQ

The biggest pro to the LVH is that by going through the hotel and walking across a small alley, you're in the Convention Center.

The negative is that you have to stay at the LVH.  The entire hotel is dated.  The check-in staff will try to upsell you on a room upgrade.  Go for it, for the refrigerator alone.  (A quick trip to the Target at Flamingo and Maryland will allow you to stock up on beverages and avoid hotel prices for drinks.)

The real downer of my trip is the constant promotions.  I went through the conference organizer who arranged a special rate of $79/night (before the $20 upgrade).  However, Hotels Tonight was continually offering rooms for $25/night.  When I asked the front desk staff about this, they told me I had agreed to the higher rate and there was nothing they could do.

We got to the room. As always, I immediately put my suitcase in the bathtub and inspected for bedbugs. Yay! No bugs. I then proceeded to pull out the nightstand to see if it was clean behind it, it was a little dusty, but overall clean. 

My main draw to this hotel was that it had a monorail station right in the hotel. It was perfect as a majority of the people in my group were staying at The Hotel at Mandalay, but I didn't want to spend the money.

Checking in was easy -- and actually, I enjoyed it lot. The front desk attendant was courteous, talkative and very helpful. Turns out you have to pay a daily fee to enjoy to gym amenities, but since I'm a Hilton Honors member, we was able to get the fee waved. 

The rooms are just old -- that's the bottom line. The varnish on my bathtub is peeling and the room had a musky smell. Beds are comfortable, but nothing extraordinary. My TV was also not working, and I called to the front desk to send up someone, but they never showed up.

We booked here because it  was one of the cheaper and better options for EDC. It's off the strip but we wouldn't be spending much time on the strip anyway. My bf did the $20 bill trick and it got us a room with a King sized bed in the East Tower with a view of the gold course and the Stratosphere. I think the rooms in the East Tower are the newer rooms which was technically the deal that we got for the $20. The room is clean and the furniture is sufficient for what we needed to rest. The hotel has an option that if you didn't want housekeeping, they can credit you $8.00 to spend in the hotel stores or $10.00 for slot play. Not a bad deal for going green.

The only set backs of the place is that the walls are pretty thin. We heard people talking and people could hear us talking. The guy next door was playing some pretty loud music but good thing it was when we were about to leave. 

The faucet for the shower didn't work and would not stay in place. It was either really hot water or really cold water. 

The hotel itself has a coffee shop and a Pizza Hut, but everything else is pretty dead. There is an empty casino hall and a small are for slot machines.

5782451,2013-07-19,10,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"I'm going to preface this review by saying that I stayed here for a few nights after receiving a special offer for a $22/night rate (plus an $18/night ""resort fee"" which gets you wifi--for one device--and not a whole heck of a lot else), so consider that the entire trip was done somewhat on the cheap when reading the following.

In terms of the condition of the hotel and the rooms, it's certainly not dirty or decrepit by any means, but it is aging and is overall rather bland--the owners' unwillingness to put any money into renovations is readily apparent. Look around and you'll see all kinds of remnants--there's an ""M"" festooning the storefront of the cubic zirconium shop, a relic from Barry Manilow's stint here. And the ""Spacequest Casino"" and surrounding areas, including the massive entrance to the now-defunct Star Trek Experience, have largely remained as-is, which means there is a huge inexplicably space-themed casino just off the lobby. Oh, and you can still see the enormous Star Trek insignia on the outside of the building when taking the Monorail elsewhere.

We encountered a number of niggling problems over the course of our stay. We checked in at approximately 11:30 PM on a Sunday night and were told at checkin that room service was 24 hours; indeed, even the screens in the lobby, as well as the menu in the guest directory, all seemed to confirm this. However, a phone call to room service revealed that it in fact ends at midnight. What's more, an attempt to order delivery (via the GrubHub website) resulted in a phone call from the GrubHub management telling us that they can't send delivery drivers to the LVH because (and this is a direct quote) ""last time they called the cops on the driver."" Apparently the hotel owners are so cheap and money-grubbing that they would rather you starve than order delivery--that, or resort to the late-night ""deli"" off the sports book which served little more than deep-fried crap from Sysco.

The nickel-and-diming doesn't stop there. Want to make a coffee in-room? That'll be $3.50, please. Those ""complimentary"" bottles of water? $4 each (though, in fairness, they only charged us $4 despite the fact that we drank about three of them each over the course of our stay). Want to use the landline with your calling card? That'll be $1. Oh, and want to use the sauna/steam room? That's $20 (per day), on top of your resort fee.

Housekeeping doesn't seem to give a crap about whether or not you're asleep. Starting at 7 AM on Monday, we heard extremely loud Spanish virtually non-stop through the wall for well over an hour as the housekeepers chatted away with each other while cleaning adjacent rooms. It wasn't exactly something you'd care to wake up to involuntarily.

As far as creature comforts go, the water pressure in the showers is ridiculously pathetic--indeed, Larry King's urine stream is likely more forceful than the dinky trickle that issued forth from the shower head. Additionally, the water valve in our bathroom wouldn't completely shut off, resulting in dripping that, while not particularly annoying, did seem wasteful. What's more, the ""hot"" water was really on the low side of warm; I was able to get truly hot water only on the last day of our stay.

Those are probably the main issues that we encountered. Again, I'm not going to completely pan the place--the beds are comfortable, the rooms are serviceable (especially if you can snag an upgrade), the in-room A/C is ice-cold, the elevators are fast, and the promo rates can't be beat, plus the direct connection to the monorail makes it a snap to get to the Strip.

Though I'm not old and always falling asleep OR looking to go shopping. It's far enough off the main strip that it's inconvenient to walk to. There is the monorail, but you gotta pony up some cash for that, and wait for the next one if you don't catch it in time.

The rooms themselves are fine, though the AC is loud as all hell. I never actually slept up there, just showered in the room we had between going out on the town (beacuse it's too loud, and because, who sleeps in Vegas?). We did some gambling downstairs, which has a nice enough casino floor. But no poker room (this is what dropped my review from 3 to 2 stars), which is annoying. So if you wanna play craps or slots or blackjack or the fake hold em they have at those little tables, you could do that. The food inside is all retardedly expensive and you might as well go down the street and find a taco bell. 

The building itself is huge, theres something like 30 floors and the rooms arent arranged perfectly square, theres Y intersections in the hallways and crazy stuff like that and you will for sure get lost while looking for your room, especially if you're drunk before noon (hey, they give free drinks at those craps tables, don't judge). 

If I was older, and coming in for the week or something, I might consider staying here. Or if there was 10 people willing to pitch in 15 bucks each for a place where they could shower, get dressed or black out for a bit each night (like we did, but with 3 people, everyone else was in PH, which was smart of them), I would consider the LVH.

3 things came to mind the first moment I walked into the hotel. OLD, CHEAP and GHETTO!! Don't know how to explain it but there was no positive aura about this place at all. It was ghetto. From the elevators to the carpet, this place looked like it was ready to fall apart. 

Once, we got into our room, we noticed the faucet leaking loudly! Plus the room was by the elevator so it was very noisy. The room itself was pretty decent sized, but everything looked old, except for the flatscreen tv. I called the front desk to be transferred to another room and told them the situation, the gal said to go to the next room. I told her it was too noisy. She said the hotel was really full(really?). She said to come down to the front desk and they would find me another room.

So we dragged all of our luggage back down. The dude that helped me was an idiot. As we specifically told him about the leaking and how they needed to fix it, he kept saying ""I'm sure they will fix it."" He looked agitated and wouldn't give eye contact. I don't know who trained him, but he doesn't want any responsiblity for the hotel's guests complaints. He should have said, "" I'll look into it and make sure that the problem is corrected."" Not ""I'm sure they'll fix it."" Does he even know when the leak started? Yesterday, a week ago, a year ago? Who's gonna fix it? Housekeeping? Roto Rooter? It's because of workers like him this hotel is under forclosure. I asked him for a room away from the elevator. He said they had one room left, as the hotel was really full(really again? sure didn't look like it). As we entered the room , I swore I smelled smoke but the room was non smoking. It was smaller than the first room and I questioned the cleanliness. My wife said the toilet paper in the bathroom was one that was damp, that dried up. Did someone drop it in the toilet or drop it on a wet floor? Is this place so cheap, that housekeeping won't even replace that? 

Normally, you would expect that if there is problem with a room, the guest's room should be upgraded, not downgraded like us. Long story short, you could not pay me to sleep here again.

They offered up a nice selection too at around $10/bottle.  The happy hour at Hacienda Margarita is great, granted the regular price of a mexican beer is $6 so at $3 it brings it down to a regular price.  With the appetizers also at half price, HH becomes an excellent deal.  The buffet was actually really good and included champagne at breakfast.

It did have a refrigerator but it seemed to be on its last leg.

When we arrived in the room, it smelled like mold and smoke (even though it was categorized as NON smoking), the carpet was dirty, and the hotel receptionist wont move our rooms unless we paid an extra 40 dollars per night to ""upgrade"" to a newly remodelled room. Being desperate for comfort and cleanliness, I went ahead and paid the extra 80 dollars to upgrade. I am writing this letter to communicate my disappointment to hotwire's online description of the hotel. I felt mislead and deceived from the hotel description. 
Moral: not all ""deals"" from hotwire leads to a happy ending.

5911076,2014-06-10,0,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"The LVH is hands down the best deal in Vegas. We have been coming here for over 20 years and have never been disappointed. It is our Go to hotel for large family and friend get togethers. The casino is the perfect size- we can always find each other- and gambling here is so much fun. The dealers and pit bosses are just so friendly and personable. They remember you ! If you do get a players card,no one  treats you better than the LVH.  Period. 
The restaurants here are amazing. We stayed here 2 weeks ago for our anniversary and tried everything. TJs steakhouse was outstanding with impeccable service. BeniHanas  had gorgeous ambiance, absolute top quality food,and again, superior service. We even went to the Hamburger Bistro for a quick lunch and were pleasantly shocked. It was great!  It's beautiful and the food was perfect. 
The men played golf through the LVH st the private Las Vegas c&c. They said the course was in excellent shape and the cost was  only 1/3 of what they pd  the last time they golfed in Vegas. The ladies went to the spa for  a facial and massage and were equally thrilled. The service is truly amazing.- from check in to the attendants in the locker/ spa area. You really feel like a VIP. We even booked a cabana after the men golfed. It was only $150. Was it fancy? No,but it had the fan,tv,fridge and lots of people bringing us lots of good  food and drinks. We were happy! Last year at a different Vegas hotel for a seminar, we paid $600 for a cabana. Just nuts. 
Oh and entertainment. We just saw Mo5saic  and loved it so much we  are spreading the word.  We dragged our men to the show and they adored it. It is a screaming deal. Don't miss it. 
Rooms. We have always been perfectly happy with the regular classic rooms, but this trip we upgraded to a suite and LVH blew us away. It was huge and gorgeous and the entire staff made us feel special.  A big shout out to the ladies in the VIP lounge. 

I don't write Yelp reviews,but I read them. I was so surprised by the unfortunate comments  and experiences  shared by others, I felt compelled to share mine.",KLOJdJlSwLcP6cD1GLlhpA,0,0,5,PqZIcEJDE41GcCNoc5e73g

Also, I swear there is a perpetual smell (not a good one at that) around the hotel.The casino is a whole lot quieter than the ones on the strip if you like that and there is always plenty of parking.

Overall, nice quiet area with a golf course. I wouldn't go here since I love the glitz and glamor of the strip, but I know plenty of you would like it (minus the smell and the long walk to the lobby and to the rooms from the entrance).",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,0,0,3,9nLL8DqV2AeEqo3djA0wAA

Sure there was some resort fees and taxes that were a bit more than expected, but I really enjoyed the amenities.

Pool was filled with kids, the dj played 90s tunes, but you know what, I really had a relaxing time.

I enjoyed staying at the Hilton.  It was a little tacky for a Hilton Hotel, but it was nice.  The room was large, great night's sleep, great view, amazing bathroom huge tub.  The staff was amazing.  The shops were fun.  The restaurants had good food, but could use improved service.  The whole place was incredibly clean.  And I highly recommend the Spa, a great experience.

5957587,2009-04-08,1,LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,"After reading some of the reviews by my fellow yelpers, I was a little worried about my weekend getaway booked at the Las Vegas Hilton. But I was scared for no good reason cause this place was awesome! 

When we first arrived there was a 20-30 minute check-in wait; however, because I am a Hilton HHonors member, we were able to use the VIP check in line and had our keys in hand within 5 minutes. Valet Parking is FREE and secure, so that was fantastic news. 

After unpacking our car and leaving the keys with the trusty valet, we headed up to our room on the 14th floor. We were in a corner room with a view opposite of the strip, but didn't spend too much time in our room looking out the window, so it was all good. The room was nice. Comfortable, clean, quiet and for only $70 a night. There was a slight stench of smoke in the air, even though we were on a non-smoking floor, but the air vent just passed it right along. 

We had already purchased tickets to see Carrot Top at the Luxor, so we decided to check out the casino downstairs. Make sure you stop to sign up at the Casino Club first. You'll earn money for every slot or table you play. And they give you a free t-shirt. You can either collect the cash before you leave or use the credit towards a purchase at the hotels bars or restaurants. My husband had a great plan, hit the slot machines by the front entrance, the casino wants others to be enticed to play so those machines pay out more... NOT! But we did have plenty of fun with $80 and free drinks on the nickel and penny slots. We met a very colorful and friendly cocktail waitress Cathy. She was awesome. Kept the drinks flowin and shared great stories. After a couple of hours and still quite early, we decided to try our luck at the BlackJack table. We had never played before and with $10 minimum bets, we were only willing to risk one bet each, lol. 5 minutes later and $80 up, the dealer insisted that we walk away with our winnings and enjoy the night! We were stoked and since then, addicted to BlackJack. 

We played some other nickel and penny slots in the other casino, on your way to the monorail, and won some big money. My husband won over $80 and I cashed in over $100. Now that's a pretty decent payout for the small slots and there were others all around us winning too. 

The next day we woke up tired, unable to breathe from all the smoke, and in great need for some down time. So we packed up and went out to the pool. Apparently, just that month they had completed a total upgrade of the pool area, to include these awesome cabana's. Available to rent for just $50 and comes with 2 lounge chairs, a cushioned wicker couch, 2 cushioned wicker chairs, 1 large and 1 small table, a flat screen TV, a mini-fridge, a phone, all the towels you want, and total privacy! We were able to close all the curtains and enclose ourselves into a world of seclusion (sigh), it was so relaxing. And after the room service brought our beer, it was heavenly. We spent all day out there sunning, drinking, and jacuzzi hopping. A nice little break from the busy smoke filled casinos and just the rest we needed for another night of FUN! 

We ate at a few places in the hotel also. Paradise Cafe, good tuna salad sandwich and fries. Very friendly staff too. Fortuna, excellent coffee and croissants. Beware, if you order soy milk make sure they use soy milk. When I noticed that the drinks we made with regular milk I demanded they be made again so I could see them using soy milk, and they obliged. The Ice Cream Shoppe, huge scoops on a waffle cone... late night snacks don't get much better than that. 

Another plus, the hotel is a monorail stop so the strip is really not that far off and the monorail is much cheaper than using taxi's. It seemed pretty safe and secure too. 

Check-out was easy. Since we paid cash at the time of check-in and put a credit card for incidentals, we were able to use the express check-out from the TV in our room. Just left the keys inside, waited 5 minutes for the valet to pull our car around, and we were off! 

All is all we had an excellent time! The hotel staff was courteous and helpful. The room was clean and comfy. The pool area and cabana was relaxing and calm. The casino was fun and exciting. The food was delicious. Our trip to Vegas was great and we will stay at the Las Vegas Hilton again. 

My only negative about this hotel and really all of Vegas as a whole... the incredibly suffocating cigarette smoke clouding all the casinos and pretty much any enclosed area. Note to all smokers: You don't need to smoke in Vegas, just breathe in the air and get your nicotine fix! I think I have lung cancer just from spending 3 days there. You'd think this booming city would have found a better way, by now, to clear out the air and make it more friendly to non-smokers and not so accommodating to cigarette smokers.

More important than any of that is the sheer amount of nipple slippage going on outside. If you are lucky enough to have a room facing the pool, park yourself in front of a giant picture window 'round happy hour and check out the free boob show*.

You have to pay for internet also, something they should have done away with a long time ago. Never the less, you get decent accommodations but bring money because the cafe and buffet are not cheap. We stay here because it's walking distance to our convention and easy to come back to the room and relax but after this year, we may choose different, nicer accommodations for a better value. This place is not cheap. The pool also had a DJ who was very loud and you could not have a conversation. It was very disappointing. Not sure if we would come back.
