Chicken has no flavor. It was like a paprika chicken finger to me. Can you just add a simple ingredient like salt? The couple sitting next to us asked one of the workers behind the counter for some extra seasoning. And season she did! She came out with a big silver seasoning can. They even asked for more even after a couple of shakes. Sauces were...aight. Maybe we had to drench our chicken in their sauces to get the right bite? 

One star for their fries. They were thin and crispy. Very good! I would go back there just to eat their fries. And another star for their cleanliness and design concept.

Customer service was ok. They were friendly. They forgot to give us our drinks. Beer for my husband and a cup for me to make use of their fountain machine. We had to remind them...twice.

343117,2015-12-30,0,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"Heard so much about his place. I think I was set-up. Aside from not being able to give less than one star, I can justify the one for the atmosphere and vibe of the dining room. That being the case, I'd rather enjoy the atmosphere with an order of KFC. This place did not fail to disappoint. Service was atrocious by front counter and non-existent by kitchen staff. Front counter had a lot of work but was rude and got orders wrong. Kitchen staff consisted of three people standing around asking each other how to make items. One guy had the nerve to make his own sandwich and began eating in the back while they were slammed!

The food was terrible. Chicken was soggy with a horribly, over-seasoned crust (use this term crust loosely) while the chicken itself had no flavor or seasoning at all. Fries sat around in a hotel pan waiting to be served, no heating lamps. Salads were pre-made in a cooler, which might have been the best way to go looking back. When my to go order was messed up, I waited 15 min for them to microwave instant gravy when I gave up and forfeited the $1 up charge for gravy fries. The best part was knowing the Mac and cheese was only available for a limited time. I was unfortunate enough to get a fresh batch and see how it was made. Pre-cooked noodles, sprinkled with yellow powder then tossed in the micro. I don't know what it was but it wasn't even cheese flavor. All that powder did was make the noodles greasy. The coleslaw would have been better if they had given me plain raw cabbage and a carrot. The slaw was watery and tasted like the inside of Panda Express spring roll mixed with a cup of sugar. Forget about the instant mashed potatoes & gravy - which made me wonder why they had gravy for mashed potatoes, but not gravy fries. 

Yes the chicken was made somewhat fresh. Mainly because they had incoming orders. Unfortunately I had to stop and wonder if I had ordered fish'n chips. Having worked in food service, I could tell they were burning oil and not changing it for at least a couple days. 

My guess is someone came in and opened a chain, gave it their best to get it off the ground and decided to sit back and collect their money without ever checking back on their investment. I hope it folds soon because that's a great location for something decent.",8nRjOjp8_vxu54O4nctcQw,0,0,1,mDns4Ail6dfpXrcxtOX3qA

510418,2015-06-26,0,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"Looking at a number of the other reviews I would say our experience was in line with many of them. I'll start with the overall environment, which feels very open and clean for a fast casual place. Cleanliness also seemed very positive.

For the service, we were pretty pleased. Ordering was quick and easy, the 'remotes' that signal when the order is ready worked great. Then during the meal staff was very attentive to clear away trash from our table and ask if our needs were being met.

As many others have posted I think it's the food and value we were most disappointed with. We've enjoyed Blue Ribbon before, as they run the kitchen at Brooklyn Bowl, which we really like. Unfortunately we ordered the tenders which are not prepared in the same way as the wings and fried chicken, they just didn't have much going for them other than being piping hot! Looking around the room we immediately wished we had gone for the wings or actual fried chicken, it looked pretty good. We tried two sides, fries and corn. The fries were perfectly acceptable and a small fed two adults plus a toddler. The corn was a little watery and too reminiscent of something right from the can...with a little seasoning added. 

Finally on the value front, I'd agree with many reviewers in that I was a little surprised by the overall price point for what you get. It's not way out of whack, but running a little high.

We'll probably try again and definitely skip the tenders, it is great to have another option in the neighborhood.

841484,2017-03-08,0,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"I always enjoy trying a new fried chicken place. Blue Ribbon's Vegas location is at a shopping area on the very outskirts of town (Summerlin) which was about a 20 minute freeway drive from the strip area. 

The restaurant is bright, spacious, well-decorated and clean. Service was order-at-counter with food brought to my table in a few minutes. Food is quite pricey for fried chicken. This is clearly a 'trendy' type restaurant with prices to match. 

The chicken itself was quite good. It was breaded without being overwhelmed, very slightly spicy, fresh and juicy. It was surprisingly messy - even though there was very mild spice, my fingers got very red as if it had lots of paprika. 

There were sauces on the side, mostly mixed with honey, and since I didn't want the sweetness I didn't try most of them. The BBQ sauce was ok. I would have liked more variety - teriyaki, ranch, etc.

The fries were bad. Very thin and crispy, no real sense of potato, just sticks of bland. Would have preferred to see something fresh cut and natural.

Just so I don't have to repeat it after every item...ALL of it was small portions that the prices do not warrant!
The coleslaw was sour.
Tea was a small- for $3 bucks
The firebird just didn't taste good and was hardly spicy.
The tender and party wing were both bland and seriously MINI SIZE. I really thought they would have more flavor after seeing pics.
The original sandwich was decent.. But it was only a little bigger than a slider.
The mashed potatoes and gravy was the only thing actually good and redeeming. They were really, really good...but like everything else, it had a small portion...MAYBE a little more than a cup, if that.

FOR HER: I ordered THE BLUE RIBBON -- the original with their special sauce. Came with lettuce, tomato, and pickled cucumbers (which was quite interesting). Wasn't too much of a fan of the signature blue ribbon sauce. It has a tinge of a mustard type taste... I also felt like the contents of the sandwich made the crispness of the chicken and bread go very soggy incredibly quick. Definitely no chik-fil-a. 

FOR HIM: He ordered the TENDER SUPREME -- 3 boneless tenders with a generous amount of skinny, crispy fries & a cup of coleslaw. The flavor of the batter was very tasty and paired very well with the variety of sauces, particularly the chipotle honey. I found all the sauces to be very interesting too, especially the wasabi honey and the brbbq sauce. If we ever come back, I'll probably opt to order this instead.

Bottom line: Not something I would go out of my way for, but their variety of sauces definitely was a nice signature twist. We are interested in trying the pulled chicken sandwich and the liver & onions next time if ever.",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,6,4,3,Js1tqdc3DTTG1hKBBlMyGA

1. Price: it cost almost $70 for 4 people to eat... at a ""fast food"" place. That, atleast to me, is crazy. 

2. The sodas: I know this isn't an ideal judgement, but holy sweetness. All the sodas tasted the same and as if someone had over powered the machine with sugar. 

3. Out of 4 people, only 2 really enjoyed their food. Of the two that enjoyed their food, they only like half their choices. Allow me to explain;

My parents got fried chicken, fries, and hush puppies. The fried chicken unfortunately wasn't ""the best"" and costed $18 for 4 medium size pieces. The flavoring was ""bland"" according to them. Hush puppies were extremely dry and crumbled with every bite. They were the 2 people that did not enjoy their food. 

My brother and I got The Rancher and The Firebird with Fries with the Works and a side of Smoked Mac & Cheese! The Mac & Cheese was great on the first bite (the top, crispy bite). But after that, the cheese tasted like it had been sitting for hours. The Fries didn't taste horrible, they just were not our favorite. ON A POSITIVE NOTE the sandwiches were great. 100% would return for the chicken sandwich. 

If I personally were to rate just the sandwich, this place would be a 5/5. However, when 80% of the meal isn't enjoyed by 3/4 of the people, the rating must reflect that.

First thing I saw was the Rancher and it sold me immediately. Continued to look but couldn't resist. We entered the restaurant and greeted nicely by everyone. Felt good and homely. Noticed the very open space, nice big windows, very retro, classy 50's theme? Correct me if I'm wrong yo. Lol.

Looked at the menu very easy to read but hard to break my decision to get the Rancher although their classic with the special sauce had me wondering what it was.. Temptations rised but I stuck to my plan. I got a PBR along with the Rancher. My girlfriend decided to get the Cheesy... One? Sorry can't remember the name 100%. I can only have an overload of cheese when I'm in the mood. We got the combos. Also two drinks. She got the honey tea and me the root beer. Paid I believe 36 for two combos. I gave her 40 and told her to keep the change. It was funny.. I guess people aren't used to getting tipped I didn't mind though. Was just hoping the meal to be good as pictured.

We sat down and they gave us the buzzer to get notice when the food was ready. I leaned it towards my girlfriend cause those buzzers be wild! Well we continued to take in the atmosphere. The drinks were even labeled in a classic feel. Cute signs everywhere. We both really enjoyed the logo because it's very simple, cute, and a very strong brand sign. We also saw their badass new age technology trashcans. 

The scary loud buzzer finally rings and I got up to get food. Sat down and we both had to angle our food to be social media worthy. I think we succeeded. I asked how my gf liked fries because she isn't used to like... Fast food type. She enjoyed then and pointed out there was no salt. They were  great but I couldn't wait for the sandwich. It wasn't exactly I saw in the picture or how I imagined. Seemed like less sauce drizzled. My girlfriends though with that cheese... It was lit. Too good looking. I bit into the sandwich and was amazing. The lacking of the sauce was. Completely worth it. The chicken was just.. Filled and compacted with flavor I couldn't believe. Following up with the pickled cucumbers it went so well togrther. It was plain out just delicious.  My gf felt the same offered me a bite and I took it. Hesitant cause she had yhe cheese I still bit into it and it was amazing as well. A gentleman walked around asking how everything was as well as delivering food to tables. I was confused because why give the buzzers if he also serves? Also asked if anyone needed ranch. Didn't ask us but we overheard the option which was fine. Grabbed some ranch from the cashier and it goes perfect with the fries.

Everything was really superb a lot over my expectations. The soda was really like soda. 50s feel as I stated earlier. Very cream feels. Not bad just not for me. The tub of fries is a lot to take in. If you can't finish one I recommend just order one combo or something. By the end of my meal I noticed TVs at the top. Sports. I didn't even realize that because I was SO into the food. My gf also pointed out an employee eating the meal. She figured if an employee can enjoy the meal it makes her feel safe. Lol.

Overall.. Enjoyed everything. Such great food. Highly recommend and will be going back to try their famous classic with their secret sauce. I can't wait! Hope my words could help anyone interested.

I ordered the Natural sandwich, Mac & Cheese and a side of Mashed Potatoes and Gravy. They gave us an electronic number to put at our table. As I waited at my table for our order I noticed that the electronic numbers weren't really much help. I observed the waitresses walking around clueless trying to figure out who's order they had. When our order was ready I watched them go to several different tables before bringing it to the correct table. Just seemed unorganized.

There are several sauces on each table. They taste decent but most of them are too sweet as they are mixed with honey. 

The Mac & Cheese was absolutely awful. It was dry, over cooked and not creamy at all. The overall flavor was not good and not worth $3.99.

The Mashed Potatoes and Gravy honestly tasted like they were made of powder. Instant mashed potatoes are not worth $3.99. :(

The Natural sandwich tasted decent, but they use such large pieces of chicken strips that it makes eating it difficult. 

In my opinion this place is overpriced and not worth the hype.  I'll probably try it once more, but I'll get the chicken strips and not bother with the sandwich or the cheap sides. Hopefully next time my experience will be better.

On our first visit the chicken was so dry and flavorless that I couldn't believe a place like this was open. Seriously...

I gave it one more chance because someone else in our group wanted it and I should have known better.  Typically I don't make it back to places that have really disappointed and this is a reminder of why I don't. It's just my personality. 

I couldn't eat one full tender here. The meat almost tastes as if it's not real. The look of it is appealing but when it goes in your mouth it just feels like something is very wrong. The blue ribbon chicken sandwich is also very bland and serves up the same tasteless piece of chicken. The mashed potatoes are bland and the hush puppies were decent. The winner was the Nutella milkshake which I thought was outstanding. I do enjoy the variety of sauces and my favorite was the wasabi honey but they weren't able to cover up that chicken.

The prices are very high in general for this type of food and you can get much cheaper items from several competitors that also taste great.

I love their gimmicky sandwiches that they come up with. It certainly is what brought me and my husband in. The crazy, themed concoctions bigger than your head on one bun; who wouldn't want to try that? 

I do think that their chicken is good. While I don't enjoy the seasoning, the quality of the meat is up there. I though their mac & cheese was okay, but nothing special (especially in this city, where there are 5 star mac & cheeses all over the place). I thought their house salad was bland and uninteresting.

Until Chick-fil-a opens I figured it was one of the few options for a chicken sandwich..however after my second visit, I don't think I'll be back. Although I give the place credit for offering monthly sandwich specials, I was extremely disappointed by their December sandwich (the Holiday Helper). Despite being filled to the brim with With house smoked mac & cheese, bacon and BBQ sauce...the Sandwich was bland. 
Given the high cost for a meal (+$2 for fries and slaw but no soda) and the lack of flavor...I'd recommend you walk across the street to Shake Shack as their chicken sandwich is more worth your money & calories. 

Dining area: I dined in on both locations and noticed that the dining area was consistently dirty. I Often saw new customers bus their own tables or eat next to other customer's trash. White bench tables could also use some cleaning as they were filthy and sticky.

1893114,2015-06-17,12,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"Cluck yeah, fried chicken! The newest spot to hit downtown Summerlin features the Bromberg brothers' take on your favorite fried feathered friend, available in tenders, wings, and sandwiches, with sides, salads, and sodas. That's a lot of alliteration.

SANDWICHES: The classic Blue Ribbon sandwich is a solid offering with special sauce, while the Bluebird kicks it up with blue cheese, red onion, and bacon. The chicken for both was super-juicy without being greasy, but the breading didn't adhere very well and the chicken itself didn't have much flavor. I appreciate that the blue cheese on the Bluebird is more of a sauce than crumbles, allowing for more even distribution of flavor.

SIDES: A small is just under $4, while a large is just over $7. Steep. Mashed potatoes didn't taste instant but also weren't worth the price. The small fry is a huge portion of skinny-cut seasoned spuds, great for sampling all of their dipping sauces!

DIPPING SAUCES: BRBQ (bourbon-tinged barbecue), Chipotle honey (possibly my favorite), habanero hot (is hot), wasabi honey (very slight wasabi flavor), and a couple of others. I felt that the sauces were a nice touch, but wish the chicken itself had more flavor. The multitude of sauces seem to be compensating.

SODAS: Their fountain drink station features cane-sugar sodas. I'm not generally a soda fan, but there was no button for water so I sampled a few and was surprised to really enjoy them. The ginger ale, crème soda, lemon-lime, and black cherry, in that order, were my top picks. There were a few I didn't try.

SERVICE. Here's where I'm torn on what to rate this place. I understand I went on their second day, but I experienced a few hiccups (charged incorrectly, then brought the wrong order). However, management was quick to apologize and fix the issues, and the service from one employee in the dining room in particular was awesome. Rounding up for that dude.

Overall, this spot is a bit overpriced for what you get, but it's in downtown Summerlin so no one's really surprised. Recommend the wing lunchbox combo (5 wings, fries, and a drink for $8) for a better value, only available 11-3PM, Mon-Fri.

Overall impression: 3.5/5

Menu was big, they get props for having a ""chefs selection"" that includes necks, gizzards, all the offal that isn't always offered. Variety of sandwich options as well.

Food was good, I got the Rancher sandwich which is the basic sandwich (fried chicken breast, lettuce, pickle, tomato) plus bacon and ranch. I loaded up with the habanero sauce as well, don't fear, it's very mild. I wish it was a bigger piece of meat tho, definitely more toppings than meat. Fries and cole slaw were good, they're the thin crispy fries which I prefer to the thick cut steak fries. Cole slaw was more vinegar than mayo which was a nice balance. While tasty, I feel that the he chicken took a back seat due to portion size, had to knock down a star.

Atmosphere was cool, place was clean, people were nice. There were a variety of honey dipping sauces on a sauce bar by the drinks, I only briefly tried them since I got the sandwich, the wasabi honey was interesting.

This place is perfect for a large group. You pay at the front, so you don't have to worry about splitting checks and they have lots of seating with 2 long tables able to accommodate up to 12 each. 

They also have smaller booths around the perimeter of the eating area so smaller groups would be comfortable too.

As a vegetarian I had the mac and cheese with cole slaw and fries. The fries were super crispy but overall the coke slaw and Mac and cheese by its self were nothing to write home about. I understand this is a fried chicken restaurant, but it was definitely lacking in hearty vegetarian entrees in that they had none, the only entrees I saw were salads.

Everyone else ate the chicken and were very happy with what they had. Apparently the first rule of eating fried chicken is to add honey as was posted on the table.  As such they have 3 types of honey (wildflower, chipotle, and wasabi) and one barbecue (BRBBQ) sauce.  

My husband got the August sandwich special ""BRFC Red Hot"" which was a double breaded fried cutlet with Sriracha chili sauce, Creamy ranch, and pickled cucumbers.

The chicken tenders which we split has nice seasoning on the outside but needed a good sauce or more spice to stand out. Fries were great, thin and crispy. Cole slaw was pleasant but very mild flavored.

Let me tell you, I am glad I tried it!  Not the best chicken I have had but definitely good.  I really wanted to try their monthly sandwich, the Chicken de Mayo, a fried chicken sandwich with chicken nachos, salsa, chili lime sour cream, cilantro and more on top.  It was a mess but also delicious.  I did take my time eating It though which made the chips go soggy but that didn't bother me too much though.  The meal came with fries which were great, a tiny thing of ok coleslaw, and a drink.  All of their pops are apparently homemade which is pretty cool.  I tried the black cherry, a personal favorite of mine and it was top notch, the ginger ale which was just ok, and the cream which was darn good.  I also got two wings on the side.  Although they were $2 a pop, I believe they were worth it because they are ""whole"" wings, with three sections.  I honestly found these better than the sandwich and didn't feel like they needed any sauce or flavored honey.  The meal was relatively cheap but when you go a la carte it gets pricey.  I was super full after eating everything and was completely satisfied.  If it were closer to me I would definitely come here more!",alr2xk5KBJXHd6zVuEqdDg,1,0,4,wnKCMk9MtJK0E4EgJZZD2A

Sauces were largely one note and uninteresting (2.5) service:it is counter service but on the slower side (3) value: meh.... I've had better. Pass on this place. (2.5)

Coming off of restaurant week where we had some very good fried chicken,  we headed to Blue Ribbon to see what the fuss is all about. 

The hubs ordered the chicken tenders and the lunch box with wings. The lunch box comes with fries and coleslaw.

The coating on the chicken is a bit weird. It is a bit too thick and is served overzealously with their poorly balanced spice blend (the paprika I think is overwhelming). Not a huge fan of this. The tenders were a trifle dry and the wings (mutantly large) fared better. 

The sauces seemed very interesting but in reality they are all one note... Honey. I could not eat much of the wasabi/chipotle/straight up honey because I did not want to eat candied chicken. They are all way too sweet with the exception BRBBQ sauce which was acceptable but not exceptional. The containers for dipping sauce had such a narrow lip that it was hard to really dip anything in there. We ended up squeezing the sauce directly on the chicken making for very messy eating. 

The shoestring fries are okay -  nothing to write home about. The coleslaw was too sweet for my tastes. 

He also ordered some gourmet soda and tried all the flavors while we waited. All of them were way too sweet in for both our tastes (the hubs likes sweet too!). That didn't help with the entrées we ordered.

Overall,  we really wanted to be impressed by this place but it all fell flat. Eh... Would rather pay more for something better. 2.5 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,1,1,2,Ked591m1u-g7FubYeAjNcQ

You can eat in there or take it out. It is so hard to find good friend chicken these days. This place is a bit of a drive for me as I live by the strip but I would def come back here to eat because it was that good. They also offer side dishes (had the coleslaw and I liked it).

I was in fried chicken kind of mood and decided it was time come get me some Blue Ribbon style. I heard mostly good things about the place and one general debate hearing is the fried chicken at Brooklyn Bowl (rumors heard is the kitchen is changing ownership) or Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken some of the best you can get in Vegas. I have had Brooklyn Bowl fried chicken talk about tasty fried chicken. Blue Ribbon is just as good!!

On my first visit went with the original The Blue Ribbon Sandwich. I figure probably good idea start with something that been stable on the menu for years?? It was awesome! Not often I rave about simple fried chicken sandwich. There nothing ordinary about this chicken sandwich. Sure your paying more then your mass market cheap chicken sandwich. Always one that believe you get what your pay for comes too food. Sure it not cheap sandwich but then again not going take you to the bank. It filling sandwich. The fried chicken is nice size, the breading and batter was amazing (fried chicken only good as the breading in my mind), the bread solid, and the dressing brought it all together. The breading. I love it! Not heavy, breading is well seasoned, nice crispy, light, and perfect balance cause the chicken pieces are full pieces. The gravy fries was the only thing that not a fan. Maybe not use Jersey style gravy fries. The gravy not thick brown gravy lighter gravy. They kick it up notch with paprika or cayenne or some seasoning give it kick. Put it this way the second visit made sure got regular fries. 

My second visit went for the 2 piece tenders. Talk about two huge tenders. Maybe cause am use to Raising Cane style chicken tenders. These tenders look like they were on steroids. Seriously! They were delicious. Talk about fries. The fries dwarfed the chicken tenders hard to believe but really had that much fries. The coleslaw thought was ok. Nothing that stood out came to the flavor. 

The sauces......I really enjoy that on every table have all sauces at your disposal. The only one never tried was the barbecue. It eating fried chicken need to stick too the stable different honey or hot sauce. Wasabi honey was my least favorite. I never tasted hint of wasabi. The chipotle honey was awesome and the hibiscus honey that was the star for me. The habanero hot sauce was solid. 

The menu selection has a nice diversity. Plus not often see fast food kind of look that serves beer on draft. More less can order by the pitcher if you want either PBR or Fat Tire. Also offer red and white wine. The soda fountain is different with cane based sodas. If looking for your coke or pepsi not going get it. I enjoy the fact had cream soda from fountain station. 

The service was awesome both times.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,6,3,4,LkedRtCHEFSVnw0vJjbkgQ

My friend and I ordered the two chicken tender combo (upgraded fries to be loaded) and the BBQ chicken sandwich.  Our bill totaled around $25, which is ridiculous.  Our food was good, but not $25 good.  The chicken is juicy and flavorful, but my tenders were a little chewy.  The fries are pretty good, but not really worth the $2 upgrade for loaded fries.  If you care, the bacon they use is much better quality than fast food restaurants!  Probably could have used more cheese, though.

The sandwich has their fried chicken, cheese, bacon, and sauce- pretty standard.  The bun is super soft, which I think rounds out the sandwich and makes up for the price (around eight bucks).  I added just a little more BBQ sauce because I like a messy BBQ sandwich.  This is what I would order if I returned.

I love the soda options (mmm... creme soda!) but again, expensive!!!

Long story short: way too expensive to frequently visit, but the chicken sandwich I had was great.  I would visit again if a friend really wanted to go because they hadn't visited yet.",4slxBUw4gqvUpMynoUN6dg,0,0,3,xi8Hkn8GVT8gN4hjGVWrVg

First of all I applaud this place for trying to be different with its dry run seasoning and unique cane sugar only soda pop... 

The chicken was cooked well and tasted great. The fries are awesome. Your tradition skinny fries you'd find in a bar. The cole slaw is different and sour style.

In short, it's good but growing up with Canes, this places doesn't compete. The chicken needed a sauce (canes sauces would've been great). The worst part is the price. Two orders of 2 piece tenders and two drinks was $28.

You get more at canes and $10 less plus better slaw, sauce, drinks, and toast bread.

The man that was cleaning tables is why I gave this place a 4 star. He alone gave best (only) service and was very attentive. Brought me ranch dressing, grabbed my forks, brought me my food, and cleaned my table when I was done.

My Hub and I where so looking forward to eating here after hearing all the hype, what a complete letdown! 

Dry, bland tasteless chicken. Side dishes that where subpar. A variety of dipping sauces that ALL tasted to sweet and icky.
Boasting about offering real cane sugar fountain drinks that tasted weird. 
I really wanted to try their milkshake, but for $6 in what would be considered a small size cup,  I said forget it! 

The prices are absolutely ridiculous!...like I already mentioned above^^^
$18.50 for 6 chicken tenders?!?! 
$14 for 10 wings?!?
$8 for large sides?!? 

The only thing that was decent was the gravy fries! 
which I would eat again....

....that is until I got home and couple hours later have been in bed doubled over with cramps running back and forth to the bathroom doing you know what!

We ordered the 2 Original Blue Ribbons (one with spicy peppers), small mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese, 2 drinks. First off, they give electronic buzzers but brought our meal to us anyways since it wasn't very busy. The soda is great- non brand, unique flavors, they even have creme soda which is a serious rarity. 

Our meals arrive and they are picturesque! But we quickly found out they were very difficult to eat like regular burgers due to their size. The chicken tasted incredible, great crisp, very fresh, not overly juicy like Canes but just right. The spicy peppers do have a bite to them so be careful. The special sauce is similar to In N Out's, still very good. The pickled cucumbers are just as stated, definitely still have the cucumber taste over that of a pickle- unique! 

The sides are pricey considering their size. The mashed potatoes and macaroni were good but nothing to rave about. The gravy certainly has the chicken taste that pairs with the meal.

The breading was overdone and the flavor wasn't great. The hush puppies were awful, dry, no flavor. The sandwiches were nothing special and neither was their house sauce which they don't give you as a side for dipping the chicken, it's just on the sandwiches and with the hush puppies.

The mashed potatoes and gravy were mediocre, slightly better than a KFC. The fries, while some may like, weren't my thing. They are a shoe string fry that seem to be dusted in a coating and maybe double fried, not sure.

When Shake Shack finally opened up and I saw the infamous restaurant right across the street, the smell of fried chicken and happy patrons lured me over. My husband and I finally went in (I never told him about the raw chicken so he could go in unbiased), and we were greeted warmly by the cashier. I didn't catch his name, but this guy was on top of his stuff - greeting, taking orders, serving orders, cleaning up tables, checking in on customers, all without a hitch IMO. He gave us great recommendations - he said get the wings and get the creme soda, and that's exactly what I'm going to do now every time I come here (I've been dying to come back since my first visit). The BBQ chicken sandwich we got was just okay and kind of soggy, so I really do think the wings are the best way to enjoy the chicken here. I loved the chipotle honey sauce and the wildflower honey. It reminds me of the chicken and honey at Brooklyn Bowl, without having to drive down to the Strip. Their thin cut fries are addicting and I liked dipping them in the chipotle honey sauce as well. My husband opted for the gravy fries - which I thought were good, but soggy, but he loved them. I don't even like creme soda, but the brand they use here is a must-have! They also have TVs if you'd like to catch a game here. Not the ideal set-up for game watching, but it does the job.

2972855,2017-08-21,0,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,Always anxious to try another recipe for fried chicken. I would say that this recipe is excellent.  I ordered the two white meat combo. That means you get a chicken wing and a chicken breast served with shoestring fries and a cup of their coleslaw.  A beverage is not included in the price of the combo which is a $2.50 add-on so for a meal and beverage you expect to pay about $16. You are given a buzzer while your meal is being prepared. The beverage bar is pretty simple and I tried their sweet tea which was sweetened with honey which could be an odd taste for those who are used to sugar cane sweet tea. The wait for the food was about 15 minutes and since it was fresh it's worth the wait. The chicken indeed is good. It has a matzo crust with very aggressive seasoning. That means it could be a little Snappy spice. The chicken was very moist as if it was brined before cooking.  The french fries were seasoned well and crispy. The coleslaw is a deli style not a kfc creamy kind. A word to the diet conscious person definitely loaded with sodium so watch out. You could blow your head off with too many of these delicious morsels.  The bathrooms were kind of clean in some of the tables had food on them. They have painted white benches as booths but yet it looks like they're dirty it could be a wrong choice to paint a bench white with feet marks you get a sense you're sitting on a dirty seat. They have a variety of sauces for the chicken and fries which are excellent. Maybe I missed it but all they need is to come up with some waffles with that chicken. I would go back for sure and would have to be conscious of what pieces I chose because of so much salt. The associates are very nice and efficient for a Sunday afternoon. Try it you might like it but Popeyes is cheaper and I think you get more for the dollar but it is something different to try.,pesJID974CXPUfe52GOd5Q,1,2,3,UDlA0vgx9hFiiHhjraqupw

3072519,2016-02-04,0,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"Been here twice now. I so desperately want to like this place. But there's just something off...

Menu: It seems that they've changed it recently...  Previously, you were able to order the usual 'wings' (drumsticks and flats mixed). Now they only do full wings (both pieces together) and tenders. The menu is a bit overwhelming. The wing combos are a little expensive and don't even include a drink. If you're already paying $10-$15 for a combo meal without the drink, I can't imagine shelling out even more for one of their sides. It just seems a little overpriced for where you are and what you get. 

Food: Prior to the menu change, I had wings and fries. I wasn't impressed by either. The wings were just too fleshy. And the fries were bland. Nothing special. I wasn't impressed by ANY of the sauces they offer but used the Habanero anyway for an extra kick. On my most recent visit, I decided to try a chicken sandwich. I got the Classic. It was decent. Also had some of the same bland fries. But for $8.50, I could have gotten 8 Hot N Spicy chicken sandwiches from McDonalds. They honestly taste better. However, my girlfriend had their special truffle chicken sandwich, and it was pretty good. It had cheese, truffle mayo, and sweet potato fries on the sandwich. Hers was totally worth it. Nothing I ate was BAD. Just not memorable or something I will crave. 

Drinks: Hate the natural sodas they offer. They all taste like ginger. The Freestyle Coke machines at Five Guys are awesome. Get rid of the natural sodas and put in one of those machines. The drink is important to the overall experience! However, the lemonade and sweet tea were both tasty. 

Ambience: Friendly staff and clean dining areas.  It is a welcoming place to eat. 

Overall, I feel like this place is still trying to figure itself out. They give you a buzzer but then try and hunt you down to deliver your food...  Maybe they just do this when its not too busy. But makes no sense. Why not give out numbers so they aren't taking food table to table. Simplify the menu. There is too much going on. You can easily cut costs by simplifying everything and then expand once you succeed with a more limited menu. Swap out the natural sodas for a freestyle machine or just regular soda. People are CRAZY about their favorite sodas. My girlfriend literally almost didn't want to eat here because she remembered they don't have Coke Zero. I want this place to succeed but have a feeling it will be gone at some point in the next year if it doesn't figure out what it wants to be.",ShpEmWgg_O6WWpHseZkHEQ,0,0,3,6FExUmzhNd-mTSwXh3_9HA

The food was hot and fresh and tasted so good. The chicken has a fair amount of seasoning  and it's super crispy! I loved that sauce , and the ones they had on the table. Try dipping your chicken into the wasabi honey or chipotle honey those were my two favorites! I also prefer the smoked Mac and Cheese as a side and it was really good!

Came in on 7/13 and honestly, I was a bit disappointed. 

Overall the food, while overpriced, was pretty tasty. They've got a nice mix of sandwiches vs. your standard Fried Chicken offerings. Some pretty solid sides round out the mix. I'm a big fan of homemade pickles and theirs didn't disappoint. 

The two ladies taking orders could throw a smile into the mix every now and then though as there was quite a bit of attitude coming from their end. I saw there was no Buffalo Sauce on the tables, but there was a sign touting the 'Homemade Buffalo Sauce.' When I asked, the girl stared at me and said ""every sauce we have is on the table. thanks."" Weird, but that's ok. I headed back to my table to chow down.  

Suddenly the guy busing tables came over with my sought-after Buffalo Sauce. ""I heard you asked for this, so I grabbed some for you."" What a champ. It was delicious. Honestly, its probably the best Buffalo Sauce I've had. This guy was actually the star of the show in regards to service. He was nice, attentive, and definitely going the extra mile. Even offered to refill my water for me. 

***Hey Management - This kid deserves some kudos!***

All in all, I'd rather make the trek to Chicken Shack in Henderson than return to BRFC. With that being said, if I was in the neighborhood and wanting some fried chicken love, I'd make another stop.

This sandwich special is a grilled chicken breast with shredded kale, green bell pepper, pickled cucumbers, avocado and vinaigrette dressing on a bun. The sandwich was tasty combination of veggies and the chicken was juicy and tender. The other items ordered was a fried chicken breast and french fries. The fried chicken was tender inside with a crispy skin. The taste of the crispy skin was different than other places and was not my preference. The skinny fries were hot and tasty. The portion size was large enough for two people although the small size was ordered. 

The restaurant has a bright and comfortable feeling. Seating is choice of tables or booths. Orders are placed at the counter and the food is delivered to you. Except for the fountain sodas that are self serve. A server continuously makes the rounds checking your satisfaction and removing finished items.

There are many choices for chicken just like burgers. At Blue Ribbon it's all about the taste of the fried chicken. It's just different to what I prefer. I will keep them on radar for the sandwich of the month.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,0,0,3,AjB6gUVg8-I8GRgikDJ_EQ

3306677,2018-04-14,0,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"I legitimately can't think of a better place for chicken than Blue Ribbon. I mean, DAMN this chicken is good! I never been happier to spend $13 on four chicken wings than at Blue Ribbon. They have mastered the art of frying crispy chicken that's moist and juicy inside. The seasoning on the batter they use is so good, I found myself licking my fingers after every bite to ensure I got every bit of flavor to my taste buds. Now let me tell you about the soda machine.

The soda machine has regular flavors, but every flavor is made w/cane sugar. What that means is this soda is sweet, full of flavor, and the carbonation packs a punch. The root beer, and black cherry are my favorite flavors, but I noticed a lot of people were getting the cream soda. 

Back to the chicken. So the key w/the chicken is to use some of the honey as a dipping sauce for the chicken. Don't drizzle so much honey that you wipe out the seasoning on the chicken, but rather use the honey to compliment the seasoning. I love the chipotle honey, and my fiancee was mixing the wasabi honey w/the wildflower honey for a honey concoction of her dipping delight. If you eat chicken at Blue Ribbon w/out honey, I think you're cheating yourself out of a better experience. 

And Blue Ribbon has $1 PBR drafts. One dollar. All day. All night. I love $1 beers! Plus I noticed the two times I've been there, soccer was playing on the flatscreens. I'm a huge soccer fan. Especially with a $1 beer in my hand!",UVrJsEjnT9mWCdWyWVm5Nw,0,0,5,PlSU3COd-nAfppIh2UhMdA

And the wasabi honey was a welcomed surprise. Also the service was great. They where fast and really welcoming and.
So why the 4 instead of the 5? 2 things. The sandwich was pretty hard to eat and it really just fell apart. Plus the other parts of the sandwich aside from the chicken itself where pretty standard. Iceberg lettuce and a tomato. Mehh. The sauce was great though.

My girlfriend and I went here because we tried this place out at Life is Beautiful and their chicken drew me towards them. The sauce was out of this world and I had to have more! So we finally got some time to drive over there (since I live in BFE from them) and it was totally worth it! We came in close to closing but all the workers there didn't mind at all and were still very helpful. They came around to the table to ask if we needed anything like a refill or to throw away things and I thought that was a great way to keep the relationship with the customers fresh and friendly. The sugar cane soda there always a sight for sore eyes! Actual sugar in these sodas and I loved it. Cream soda and root beer were the best for me. Lastly the food was just as I expected, beautifully hand crafted chicken made from the blue ribbon gods. The selection of sauce made it even better. Chipotle honey sauce was hands down my favorite. The shoe string fries on TOP OF THAT is beautiful! My favorite shoe string fries ANYWHERE! The only drawback I can think of is it's a bit pricey when it comes to getting meals for families. If you buy a burger alone, its worth it. But for a family, the ball park range is $50. So I suggest coming here for yourself and 1 other person, unless you eat as much of a 3 person family then I recommend somewhere a bit cheaper for this price. 
If you are in the mood for some great chicken at a reasonable price, I highly recommend it. The chicken is worth it alone, IMO (in my opinion)",Z278FCI7bG8wMEvZZtbVJA,0,0,4,1AY1Bqlg0OYG2Qq5rdrMGQ

1st time Blue Ribbon eater.

Ordered the 2 piece chicken finger plate. It came with fries and a 1oz cup if coleslaw. Was told it's decent size fingers. And they were right they were fairly large Chicken fingers. I only needed 2. It came with a crapload of fries. I would prefer more fingers and less fries. 

Anyway, I digress. Back to the review. The chicken fingers were somewhat chewy and seemed overcooked. The lightly dusted seasoning on the fried breading was pretty good. I also got a nice big chciken vein in one of the fingers. It was pretty gross. 
The fries are shoestring fries and trust me u get plenty of em with your meal. They should sprinkle them with the same spices they use on the chicken.

They have real cane sodas and plenty of sauces to choose from. Also there are no salt n pepper shakers on the table. You have to get the tiny packets from the condiment counter.

We tried a variety of other dishes besides the fried chicken...including collard greens and milkshakes. I highly recommend the strawberry milkshake.

A kid's meal only comes with one tender. I wish they used a more mild seasoning for the kid's meals. My guy didn't care for the spices. While I do like this place, prices are too high for a fast casual spot to make me a frequent visitor. The 2 piece tender meal didn't fill me up and that was around $12 for the meal plus a drink. I understand the quality is higher than fast food spots, but I can't spend $15 or more on lunch on a regular basis. If I bring the family the price triples.

I was hesitant to try this place at first because of the mixed reviews, but am so glad that I did give them a try because the chicken sandwiches here are legit. Everything is made fresh to order and they can get really busy in here, so remember that when you attempt waiting patiently for your order and know the end result will be delicious! Inside is very clean and the staff has always been friendly and helpful at answering questions I have about  the menu. I appreciate that I see them double checking orders before taking them to a customer to ensure the order is correct. They have about 8 sandwiches to chose from or you can customize your own. Sides range from smoked mac and cheese, coleslaw and spicy slaw, mashed potatoes and gravy, hush puppies, fries to corn and bacon. 

Smoked Mac and Cheese ($3.25 for small and $6.75 for large) - If it's just me, I get a small size. If my hubby is with me we have to get a large because the both of us need a fix. Yep, fix! This mac and cheese is addicting and worth stopping by for alone in my opinion. It's cheesy, creamy and tastes damn good.  

Cheesy Supreme ($7.50) - Crispy fried chicken, lettuce, tomato, pickled cucumber, blue ribbon special sauce and your choice of 2 cheeses on a toasted bun. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the pickled cucumber added a nice flavor I didn't think I'd like. For sure something I'd order again. 

Sandwich of the Month ($8.95) - This changes each month and isn't a sandwich that's regularly on the menu any other time besides its designated month. Some of my favorites are the Black and Blue and Lovebird, both of which I highly recommend checking out when their months rolls back around! Seriously, these sandwiches are big and I could not fit my mouth around the Lovebird to take a bite lol. Excellent flavor with surprising topping combinations that all compliment each other well. 

You can buy chicken by the piece or in a combo. They have whole wing, drumstick, tender, thigh and breast to chose from and they have a 4 piece mix option under the combos if you want to try a variety. Don't forget to check out their sauces and they have to-go containers also. Sauces are Wildflower Honey, Chipotle Honey, Wasabi Honey, Habanero Hot Sauce and BRBBQ. I like sweet sauces and their Wildflower Honey tastes great, so I have been drizzling that on my drumsticks and tenders.

They have Boylan's cane sugar fountain soda for $2.50 and freshly brewed tea, wine, beer and shakes. It's a bummer that the combos don't include a fountain drink, but if you are dining inside the refills are free at least. You can also choose from a couple salads and they have a kid-o combo. Monday thru Friday there is a Lunchbox Special for $8 that will get you 3 whole wings, fries and a drink. If you really have a hankering for livers and onions and crispy necks and heart gizzards they got that also lol.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,68,73,5,vvgf3XT0zmRZHPErbf92gA

It is a fast casual restaurant and the service was very quick. Rather than having traditional Coke or Pepsi fountain drinks, they offer the Boylan fountain drinks which are harder to find and better than most of the coke or Pepsi products. The cream soda was my favorite. I ordered the cheesy supreme, which came with American cheese, Swiss cheese, chicken, lettuce, tomato, and pickles and the Blue Ribbon Special Sauce. The bun was fresh and crispy and the sandwich was perfection. The Blue Ribbon Special Sauce and their ranch has a little bit of a pickle taste to it which was not great, but it complimented the sandwich well. It comes with a side of thin crispy fries and coleslaw, but I substituted the cole slaw with extra fries. Overall, the restaurant has great service, is clean, and has amazing food.

As we were driving around we also saw alot of other things that peaked our interest.  So I guess it wasn't a waste of time.  So they were fast and efficient.  We just ordered the chicken wing combos.   They were good, I like how they season the outside of the chicken, seems like once it's out of the fryer, they shake it in there seasoning mix.  And they give you so many fries, you can share it with someone.  Yes, it was good, but I wouldn't take a 30 min ride just to go and get it again. But, if your in the area, give it a shot!

Its like the Bobbi at Cap's but with chicken and mashed potatoes instead of turkey and mayo. The sandwich was yummy, everything works well together. My only criticism is that the sandwich was very messy to eat even after slicing it in half and I think a big reason why is because they put mashed potatoes w/gravy both on top of the chicken strips and underneath. 

I didn't order any fries, but one of the managers was kind enough to bring some with my meal which I greatly appreciated! I forgot what brand of soda they use but I like the change from Pepsi and Coke and that they use cane sugar vs corn syrup.

I mentioned it to the register clerk.  He told me they're trying to keep the prices at the same price they have them back east. The bill for my two young kids in me came to almost $50. I gave him $100 bill. He told me they do not take hundred dollar bills. This is also ridiculous. If you charge that much you better expect to take larger bills. Also, I learned at an early age, never refuse money. If you have a problem with forgeries, have systems in place to prevent it. Such as monetary scan mechanisms or those pens that you use to verify that the bill is real.   We sat down. The seats are white. So they showed the dirt off beautifully.  The food came. Delivered by a very nice server.  The food really was mediocre. All the food seemed to have a flavor of paprika on it. I have not had KFC in years but I remember KFC being much better than what we had for lunch, and considerably less expensive.  

OK, my suggestion to Blue Ribbon, is to reduce your price by at least 25% and except larger bills. A clean seat is also not a bad idea.",UW9dY5C1rzzZTaIlGbUv8A,6,0,2,YvARPI8GEf8jzu-bT_djAg

3737445,2017-01-02,9,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"BRFC is a solid place to try some really good chicken. I've been very happy on my recent visits to BRFC. Our chicken combos were tender, juicy, crispy, and flavorful. We like to order their chicken tender combos and dip them in all their different sauces. My husband and I really enjoy it and plan on returning. 

Pros: 

* Friendly & efficient service when you order at the counter 
* Clean and modern decor with plenty of seating/table options and large windows
* Large TVs (we watched football during one of our visits) 
* Combos include their shoestring fries and small cup of coleslaw
   Fries: skinny, crispy, salty, and plentiful | Coleslaw: a bit bland for my taste
* Their juicy chicken has a nice crisp crunch with a tasty and flavorful seasoning. 
  Their chicken is delicious with a slight spicy dry coating (a hint of cajun) 
  We do not find it to be greasy and the breading was light and not overwhelming 
* Their Boylan pop is served at a soda fountain and is sweetened with cane sugar and refillable
* Their iced tea is sweetened with honey or unsweetened and refillable
* Milkshakes are thick and creamy and my husband always orders one with his chicken
* Honey Dipping Sauce options: wildflower, chipotle and wasabi honey flavors 
  I LOVE all their honey options for my chicken tenders 
* Other Dipping Sauce options: habanero hot sauce and their own BRBBQ barbecue dip
* Lunch Box Special Deal:  M-F |  11am - 4pm  | 3 whole wings, fries, and a drink = 8 bucks 

Cons: 

* It seems a bit pricey for what it is. Essentially, it is priced a little higher than what you would expect for a chicken joint. You're looking at $10 - $15 a person for combos. However, I do find it to be a higher quality than most chicken joints. It's an upscale atmosphere for a 'fast casual' restaurant.

3794566,2015-06-20,7,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"My coworker who usually shows zero emotion showed so much emotion and raved about how delicious the fried chicken was at Blue Ribbon on the Strip, so I was stoked when this place opened! I really wanted to love this place since I LOVE fried chicken, but the bf and I were sorely disappointed after eating there last night. 

The menu had plenty of options with tenders, boneless thighs, wings, sandwiches, salads, sides, 3 draft beers, and cane sugar sodas. We each decided to go with the 2 pc tender meal ($9.75), a boneless thigh ($3.75), and a cane sugar soda ($2.75). The 2 pc tender meal came with a side of cole slaw and shoestring fries. Each table was stocked with a variety of sauces: Bahhhbq, Chipotle Honey, Wasabi Honey, Habanero Hot Sauce (their house hot sauce though personally I prefer buffalo), and... I feel like there was one more besides plain ketchup but I can't remember.

We were pretty excited and did our fair share of taking pictures of our food (we're THOSE ppl, I know) before diving in. Everything was alright - started with the fries which were pretty good, tenders had great breading and seasoning but were a little on the dry side in both orders, cole slaw was fresh and vinegary, and the ginger ale soda was refreshing. The seasoning on the chicken is already delicious itself so I didn't think there was much need for the sauces unless you were using the sauce to make the dry tenders more juicy. Overall, the above mentioned were good though I'd swap out the tenders to try the wings.

Here comes the big disappointment and my primary reason for dropping it from a 3 star to a 1: our boneless fried chicken thigh was UNCOOKED in the center!! It looked perfectly fried on the outside and we had started to peel off some of the chicken skin to eat and were excited because it was seasoned well and crispy, but upon tearing the thigh open we noticed the entire center was uncooked! Thank goodness neither of us jumped the gun and bit straight into the chicken thigh. It would be understandable (though still unacceptable) if maybe a tiny bit of the chicken was UNDERcooked, but we literally had an UNcooked center. 

It took us a moment to process the raw chicken we were staring at before bringing it to the counter to show them. The cashier that helped us said sorry and said they would redo the 2 boneless thighs. A few mins later we got back up to ask when they would be done and requested it to go since we had lost our appetites already. The gentleman that spoke with us seemed to be one of the supervisors but showed less apologetic emotion than the cashier. Meh. Our thighs were finally ready and was brought to our table boxed up with fries, a bottle of their habanero hot sauce, and a chocolate shake. The manager (I'm assuming) apologized and was very courteous. It was nice of them to throw in the extras along with our new order of thighs, but it wasn't able to erase our disappointment. 

When we walked out, there was a guy standing outside texting that sorta looked like Bruce Bromberg? but maybe not... Couldn't really tell because it was dark and he had glasses on. Anyway, he said, ""sorry again guys. They pulled the wrong piece out of the fryer too early.""  Ah, so that's why... Yikes?!?!

Maybe I'll give this place another chance eventually, but definitely not for a really really long time. I understand they just opened and may experience hiccups, but what a rookie, gross, and dangerous mistake to make on chicken when you're a fried chicken restaurant. There's too many other dining options in Downtown Summerlin for them to risk making a mistake this big. 

Overall- 
Service could improve to be more consistent from all employees. Dining room was clean and had TVs. I recommend taking a close gander at your chicken to make sure it's edible before consuming.",npRcNSwJp3443oxEEagCrA,35,5,1,2g9GFIiiUUiMcu4foroB2A

 It's located right off the 215 and the W Charleston Blvd off ramp in a trendy outdoor mall called Downtown Summerlin.  It's location is really accessible because they are located on the outer region of the mall.  S Pavilion Center Dr is the street you need to be on.  Plenty of parking on that side.
 I really suggest you order the 2 Piece White, which is a breast and a whole wing.  Let me start with the wing.  This was so good and so juicy that I'm really glad no one was in there watching me eat this.  I promise you I left no meat on the bone.  
 I left the breast for last because this is the order I ate it in.  After the delicious'ness of the wing, I dug into this thing with my fingers.  The meat was falling off the bone with little or no problems.  The juices were flowing out of this every time I touched it. It wasn't greasy and my friend, who didn't order the breast, actually finished his meal and went back to order one...I DID TOO!  I really couldn't get enough of it.  
 The meal comes with fries and coleslaw.  I'm not a fan of coleslaw, except mine, so I ordered double fries.  Glad I did!  If you are looking for great skinny fries, then you just found it.  The seasoning makes the fry and they have it.  
 I just wish I came here at the beginning of the week I was there, so I could have reviewed more.  Tons more on the menu other than what I reviewed but trust me on this one.

3875613,2015-07-21,0,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"Unfortunately the reviews are right, this place is a bit underwhelming. My friend came here a few weeks ago and despite the mixed reviews, the pictures looked pretty delicious so I had to try it out for myself. I came here this past Sunday and ordered the 2 boneless thighs meal which also came with shoestring fries and coleslaw. At first the pieces of chicken looked ginormous, but as I started eating I could tell the chicken was flattened and it consisted of mainly breading. The breading was good, but I thought it was kind of inconsistent considering the color of the seasoning was darker it some parts than in others. Is that suppose to be like that or are they still trying to get the grove of making this chicken since they are still fairly new? The coleslaw was pretty standard so that was good. I do like shoestring fries and they did a pretty good good. Just as another review said the sauces were nothing spectacular, but when you're here for the first time you feel obliged to try them. Although I did like the hot sauce and used that the most, actually it was hot at all but did add extra flavor when I dipped the chicken into it. The inside is nice and is your modern take on country-farm like. They keep this place clean and the service was good considering an employee stopped by our table and offered to refill my drink. To save money (because their prices are kind of ridiculous)  I just had a water, but their fountain drinks and ice teas weren't from your typical major soda beverage supplier.

3877220,2017-08-01,4,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"The onslaught of ridiculous chicken sandwich pictures on social media finally brought me to try Blue Ribbon. Although a new location just opened on The Strip, I found the parking situation to be much easier to navigate in Summerlin. My intrigue began almost a month ago when Blue Ribbon promoted a sandwich called The Smorgasbird - a double decker chicken sandwich stuffed with fries, barbecue chicken, grilled pineapple and sauce at a nice price point of $15. 

The challenge was to finish the bird within 5 minutes and to challenge other friends to do the same to be entered to win a free Hail Mary platter (that's 25 whole wings, 25 tenders, and a side). To sweeten the dean, $5 of that goes to the National MS Society, plus you get your choice of a free shirt or hat. It was win, win win, so I went for it. 

I skipped out on the actual binging challenge and split it with my sister. The chicken itself was good, but in the hodgepodge of different types of food all mixed together, individual flavors were difficult to discern. I did enjoy the skinny cut fries that they had. If you're feeling adventurous, try the chef's choice, beak to butt. While it wasn't for me, it's nice to see that no part of the bird is wasted and you can enjoy parts that some may see as delicacies such as the heart or gizzard. 

Overall, I found the chicken to be tender and juicy, but I'll have to try the original sandwich as well as the individual pieces. I love that they have different types of honey including spicy wasabi, which gives it an extra kick. I found the prices to be very reasonable, especially if you're coming for lunch and can grab lunchbox special for $8.

Came in to an empty restaurant around 4pm, caught off guard as I would've thought that would be their big rush? I guess this worked out well in my favor seeing how the time for order to eating would probably be greatly increased if it were packed.

I and the girlfriend ordered the 2 piece dark combo and the blue ribbon chicken sandwich with sweet tea.

The girl behind the cash register said $25 dollars with a straight face and said it would take about 15 minutes. I swiped my card and proceeded to grab a seat in the desolate dining area. When my buzzer finally rang after what had seemed a lifetime, I walked up to the counter.

I ordered dine in yet I still received a nicely designed paper bag with their logo, I guess to advertise the 10 foot walk from counter to table? I sat down opened up the bag yet to pull out another paper bag containing my food and soaked in grease. The portions were delightfully small in terms of the actual chicken and cole slaw, yet swamped with skinny fries screaming too much salt. The chicken had a decent seasoning (bit salty) and crunch yet was just lacking proper amount for price. All the sauces offered were horrendous besides the habanero sauce(this was oh so good). Read my tip on the sweet tea, it's over priced and falsely advertised. Also I didn't order this but I did notice $5 pints of PBR! Seriously? I can buy a lifetime supply of PBR for that price.

All in all the flavors were just ""ok"" nothing that screamed come back for more, specially from a place specializing in chicken? Step your game up Blue Ribbon and maybe we will come back!  I see why the place is so empty now. I'll walk next door to Public School instead.",vr6yQzmtC1MNM57tjJ-J0Q,0,0,2,pJg5_g8YV3LPSCdw12k3rQ

3993340,2015-07-02,0,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"I am a huge fried chicken fan, so when I saw this restaurant I was very excited to try it. The mainstays of their menu are chicken tenders and chicken sandwiches. I opted for the ""blue Ribbon"" sandwich, their mainstay sandwich, a side of fries, and a soda (free refills). The total came out to about $16.

The sandwich was good. I didn't think the chicken dry or greasy, enjoyed the seasoning on the breading, and enjoyed the fresh (and cool) lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles against the warmer chicken. Several different sauces are offered, all sweet. I tried them all, none of them wowed me. The fries are shoestring, not my favorite. The soda was...soda. Overall, I enjoyed the food and the service was above average. Being new, the restaurant itself was spotless. What really brought this place down were the prices. I guess I can understand the rents are pretty high at Downtown Summerlin, but close to $16 for a smallish chicken sandwich, shoestring fries and a soda is a lot!

Although there are a few higher priced eateries in Downtown Summerlin than Blue Ribbon, there are a lot of less expensive/better value choices too. On a plus note, all the packaging was biodegradable and able to be recycled!",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,2,1,3,1zkpPQEBZ9G9r2eaUBSBng

4001760,2015-06-21,10,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"To the owners of Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken, I would like to offer my heartfelt apologies just in case the spirit of my dearly departed grandmother appears and hits you with her cast iron skillet.  Yes...your chicken is that good.

As a transplant from the Great American Southeast, I am somewhat of a chicken snob, and have been continually amazed at the lack of quality fried fowl west of the Mississippi.  One of my fondest childhood memories is of grandma's cast iron skillet fried chicken.  Every Thursday night was chicken night, and man could she fricassee a bird.   It wasn't a meal as much as it was an event.

After joining the Navy in the 80's (yeah I'm and old dude) and moving to San Diego, I realized that the only easily attainable fried chicken was from the Colonel.  It may have been good stuff a long time ago when he was fryin' it up himself at his roadside diner, but in the decades that have followed Pepsi Co. has done an excellent job of turning it into an over-salted, polymer-laced, fast food facsimile of a bone-in Chicken McNugget.  Put another way...yuck.

Having recently moved to Summerlin Las Vegas, my wife and I have spent our weekends exploring the Valley's ample food scene.  To my chagrin however, all the highly touted chicken joints in town have fallen flat.  It seemed as if we were doomed to seek what pleasure we could from a greasy bucket of corporate squab emblazoned with the Colonel's evil grinning face.  I can almost see him in his secret control room under Mount Charleston, laughing maniacally as he watches us on the mini-cam inserted in one of our thighs by regional marketing.  Yeah, I know he is dead...or is he?

Then, just today, as I was strolling through Downtown Summerlin wondering what I would have for lunch, I stumbled upon Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken.  ""How good could this possibly be,"" I thought to myself as I stopped to look at the menu.   After all, I am sure it is just a KFC in disguise.  Skepticism aside, I was intrigued so I threw caution to the wind, went in, and ordered their ""Two Thigh"" dinner.  I waited about 10 minutes for my meal, and when it arrived it was fresh and beautifully prepared.  If you are a connoisseur of chicken, you know when you see a special piece of bird, and this was one of those moments.  I had not seen such a thigh since Baywatch was cancelled. This is where Grandma starts getting mad...

The coating was crisp, well-seasoned, and created a wonderful shell for the moist and tender thigh meat inside.  I doused my first bite with an ample portion of wildflower honey and began slip back in time.  I looked into the open kitchen and, just for a moment, thought I saw grandmother working the fryer.  This was good stuff.  

After a couple more bites of my glorious bird, I tasted my side of collard greens and was pleased to see that Blue Ribbon had gotten them right too.  It tasted just like it had come out of a South Georgia pressure cooker.  Grandma is really beside herself at this point...

Finally I took a deep swig of iced tea and was pleased to discover that Blue Ribbon knew their brew. Tea is extremely important in the south.  We drink it more than Budweiser at a NASCAR race, and it can make or break a meal.  In these days of soda fountain tea-flavored chemicals, a Pepsi Co. invention no doubt, finding an establishment that serves real tea is always refreshing. Grandma is now raising the skillet over her head...

In the final analysis, I have determined that Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken may well make some of the best fried chicken I have had the pleasure of consuming.  Grandma swings...  I am not sure if it is fast food or not but, in the words of the late Justin Wilson, it is so good you will want to stand up an' slap someone...but don't...just enjoy your meal.  Grandma's pan finds its target...sorry guys.",dZlInsG0HbDd0Di9W7Ml1A,11,3,5,lA-maHzOQMgAfMyDwgib5g

I had a chicken sandwich, while hubby had a 2 piece meal and our little had a chicken tender kids meal. It was a lot of food and reasonably priced. 

Was this chicken delicious and juicy? Yes! Was it life changing? No. But tasty nonetheless. The different honey options were a fun touch.

I wasn't originally a fan of their chicken, the shoestring fries, and the sticker shock. In my opinion, a combo meal at around $15 is just too pricey.  I have been back multiple times since my first two visits.  And since then, I have tried almost everything on their menu, including their sides and the monthly chicken sandwiches.  Either BRFC stepped up their game or I came to appreciate what they had to offer.  The fried chicken is very tender, fully seasoned (BRFC doesn't miss a spot), and juicy.  The quality of their chicken is a huge plus for me.  I know I'm getting at least 6 oz. of chicken meat when I have one of their chicken sandwiches.  My favorites include February's Love Bird, May's Chicken de Mayo, the Natural (grilled chicken sandwich), some parts of the Beak-to-Butt, and Da Whole Bird.  The service is always great too.

4063529,2018-06-04,15,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"As a fan of chicken, I'm always on a lookout for some great chicken and after trying BRFC's location on the strip and totally enjoying my visit I wanted to try this location when I was at Downtown Summerlin. 

First thing I noticed and liked about this location compared to the one on the Strip was the size of it. It's very spacious on the inside with lots of seating to accommodate small or larger groups of people. I just wish this location had outdoor seating as I'm a fan out eating outside when the weather permits. 

Inside was clean with all empty tables wiped down and the floors swept. The drink and sauce stations were wiped down and stocked. The restroom was also clean and stocked with all the necessities. 

Ordering was super easy and quick. The guy at the register was very friendly and gave options when ordering, unlike the other location. I and my guest ordered the Rancher Sandwich and the Cheesy Supreme sandwich (made this a combo for an extra $2). Both sandwiches cost $8.75 each. When we ordered a combo, the guy asked if we wanted extra fries or the cole slaw. We aren't slaw fans, so we asked for extra fries. This was a very nice option for us that the Strip location didn't offer to us. 

I love their thin crispy fries. They are well seasoned and perfectly cooked without being greasy. The chicken in the sandwiches was crispy and moist which is always a plus for me. Nothing worse than a dry chicken in a sandwich. However, I was a bit disappointed with this location for the fact that there wasn't much sauce on my sandwich so it overall was dry. I'm one that loves a nice juicy and messy sandwich. Good thing that they offer some sauces on each table as I was able to add a BBQ sauce to my sandwich to make it more flavorful and not so dry. Next time I'll ask if they can put extra sauce on my sandwich. 

Look forward to coming back again and trying something else new.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,33,30,4,MlpEuKsL2Ur_t7AIsNaXAw

Now let's talk about the actual fried chicken sandwich.  The chicken was fresh but was very bland - it tasted as if it was unseasoned.  The breading actually peeled off, which is one of my biggest fried chicken pet peeves.  Instead of one big piece of chicken, it was two chicken tenders, as a result, eating the sandwich was a very messy ordeal that resulted in the sandwich contents falling out all over the place.

2 chicken strips combo- 2 stars. It came with coleslaw which you can get as a spicy version. The chicken was soggy, not crispy at all, and had too much Cajun or some type of dry rub flavor that didn't taste good. The best part of this dish were the frozen shoestring fries. 

Hush puppies- 1 star. Can I give zero? it was the worst hush puppies I've tasted to date. There was nothing good going on with the flavors.

The menu has two main options, chicken combinations and chicken sandwiches. Then there are sides, shakes, beer, wine, and sodas.

They do offer a variety of sauces to create your own spicy sandwich though.

I had the Cheesy Supreme Chicken Sandwich and a side of Corn & Bacon. The sandwich was very tasty. I really liked the flavor of the seasoning used in the breading on the chicken. The flavors all seemed fresh. The BR special sauce has a nice flavor that went well with the chicken. The sandwich held together nicely so I was able to enjoy it without a mess. The Corn & Bacon was as described, nothing special. I tried my husband's mashed potatoes and didn't enjoy this at all as they didn't seem freshly made to me. I also snagged French Fries from my brother and found these to be quite delicious. Each table had a variety of sauces that could be used to customize the flavor of your chicken.

I started with the loaded shoe string fries that had cheese and bits of bacon on top. I dipped it in ranch sauce because it was a little salty but it tasted good.
My sandwich was pretty big and messy. There was a slice of melted cheese and sauce under the bun so I ate it with a fork and knife. I ate most of it except for the bread with their specialty honey selection. The Honey Wasabi had a little bit of kick to it but if you want something more spicy I would go with the Chipotle Honey.

Every single component of this sandwich was from a can or a box. Not one single bit was from scratch. Canned cranberry sauce, potatoes from a box, and Stove Top stuffing. Don't get me wrong, Stove Top stuffing has a time and a place, but when I pay $15 for a sandwich with fries this is not that time or place.

1. There are so many choices for sauces when it comes to dipping your chicken tenders! I would definitely recommend the barbecue honey and the ranch!

2. Their fries are skinny cut, but not too skinny. And they achieve the perfect crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.

3. Even their plain fries have yummy flavor all on their own and are seasoned very well.

4. But why would you get the fries plain when you can get them loaded?! Loaded with cheddar cheese, sour cream and bacon! So amazing! You gotta get it!

5. The chicken is moist and tender.

6. Awesome sodas at the fountain! I would strongly recommend the black cherry or the ginger ale.

4655204,2016-04-08,5,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"Blue Ribbon chicken brings downtown New York City to Downtown Summerlin. In the northernmost reaches of downtown Summerlin, this infamous downtown New York City restaurant opened its first location West of the Hudson River. 

   After a day of hiking in the rural Desert Wildlife Refuge it was time to hit up downtown Summerlin for my post-hike supper. It was also time to erase another mental bookmark. 

   Just like any downtown, parking can be inconvenient in a faux downtown. When I patronize downtown Summerlin, I usually park by Macy's. After hours hiking up in the Refuge, I partook in another hike to reach Blue Ribbon chicken. If you are in a hurry or tired, this is not a place I would recommend. 

   When I walked into Blue Ribbon, it was relatively busy. The window menu expedited the ordering process. At the counter, I exchanged $13.78 for a two piece white breast and thigh that included fries and cole slaw. After the transaction, the young guy handed me a buzzer that would buzz when my food was ready. Immediately he presented me with a plastic cup to fill up my beverage. Blue Ribbon stands out from the competition by featuring Boylan soda fountain beverage. Boylan is a New York based soda company known for using cane sugar in lieu of high fructose corn syrup. During the course of the post hike dinner, I'd savour the creme and black cherry soda. Say if I didn't have a sweet tooth and wanted a post hike beer with dinner? If that were the case, I could of ordered from a few choices of draft beer including PBR, and Fat Tire. By the time I was half done with the Black cherry soda, the buzzer went off. When the buzzer vibrated with the flashing red lights, there was zero need to leave my booth. A staff member delivered the food. 

   How would I compare this fried chicken to the typical fried chicken place? Technically I couldn't on account of the fact that it is a uniquely prepared fried chicken. Blue Ribbon chicken is made from a special recipe where the cook dips it in egg whites, coated with matzo meal and fried. The downtown Summerlin location adds a twist to the recipe with the following additional seasonings: dried parsley, basil, thyme, garlic, cayenne, paprika, and salt. The upshot was that my nose and taste buds were on the same page. Both of these organs took in a flavorful seasoned chicken breast and thigh. My taste buds communicated with my brain that the skin was better tasting than the white meat. Say if the chicken was plain tasting. If that was the case, on my table were a variety of sauces. The sauces on my table and every table were habanero hot, wasabi honey, barbecue, and chipotle honey. Between bites of the chicken, I'd devour the fries. Just like many of my chicken dinners, I saved the Cole slaw for last. 

    The chicken meat on my table wasn't the only white that stood out. The restaurant interior incorporated  bright white walls interspersed with plate glass windows overlooking the streetscapes of downtown Summerlin. The primary furnishings were the brown tables and the multitude HD TVs that were playing professional sports. The Boylan fountain also stands out as a shout out that Blue Ribbon is New York made. 

   Blue Ribbon served as an appropriate post-hike dinner. I wouldn't hike out of my way to eat in Blue Ribbon. The price is slightly high for fried chicken, that regardless of recipe is nothing extraordinary tasting. In conclusion, I settle on the opinion that Blue Ribbon is a good restaurant that is a nice addition to downtown Summerlin.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,8,3,28Kf4f3ZKo6VUe9DMolKow
4701558,2016-02-08,5,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"The fried chicken is delicious. The breading is relatively light while achieving a maximum crispy exterior. It's also seasoned really well with tasty spices allowing the chicken to be eaten without the necessity of sauces. I've tried all of the pieces of the bird: breast, whole wing, thigh (bone-in or boneless), and drumstick, plus tenders. The white meat (breast and tenders) has the tendency to be a tad dry, but the other pieces are really moist and juicy. The boneless thigh is a favorite since you get a lot of meat and it's easy to eat. The chicken can be purchased by the piece ($1.99-$4.95), combo meals served with fries and coleslaw ($6.75-$15.50), family style ($33.95-$41.50), or party platters (starting at $140).

I'm equally in awe of their sauces and the variety. BRBBQ, Wildflower Honey, Wasabi Honey, Chipotle Honey, and Habanero Hot Sauce. My favorite combination is their hot sauce and the wildflower honey; yum! 

The sides are decent. I really like the Pickled Cucumbers, Hush Puppies, and Mashed Potatoes with Gravy. They used to have Collard Greens that I enjoyed, but it's been removed off the menu recently. I haven't tried either salads or the Spicy Slaw. The fries aren't my favorite, but still tasty. The Fries With The Works ($6.50/$12.50) is heavily loaded with aged cheddar, bacon, and sour cream; good stuff. I added some gravy and it was amazing (too bad that isn't an option on the menu, but I'm sure you can ask for gravy with your ""works"").

I've only had one of their sandwiches, The Blue Bird (blue cheese, red onion, and smoked bacon), which is unique to the Las Vegas location. A good sandwich, but mine was heavy on blue cheese and it overwhelmed the sandwich. I definitely want to try the original sandwich to compare it to other chicken sandwiches in town.

I love that they have Boylan's Fountain Soda. A soda company from New York that was previously offered via bottle only can now be found at BRFC. I love their Ginger Ale and Black Cherry sodas! ($2.50 unlimited refills)

They have three beers (Maui Brewing Co. Mana Wheat, PBR, and Basin Brewing Co. Icky IPA) on tap and red, white, and sparkling wines on tap.

Yes, it's a little bit more expensive. Yes, their French fries are skinny, crispy, and delicious and no, the chicken isn't dry or tasteless. 

I've had a drumstick and thigh which were actually really good since it was fresh.
Today, I had the Blue Ribbon sandwich and it was great, but, I thought it was a little dry and could go for more of that sauce. I also probably should've asked for more so that is also my own fault. But seriously, the sauce is like a thousand island type of deal but really pulls the sandwich together. 

The loaded fries were great and reminded me of toppings on a baked potato. Bomb but heavy. Hush puppies were also pretty good - crispy & corny 

The pickles they use/make were really good and I don't even like pickles. 

So basically, get dark meat for fried chicken, fries are bomb if you love them skinny & crispy. Lastly, if you get a chicken sandwich - get extra sauce.",RnTfhTi7VVEAMzlBXKvDsw,2,1,4,2dub7NDknHIeq0c4XzvKqA

The lady helping us order was named Ronita. I was having a hard time deciding on what sides I wanted to try out and she was super friendly and did her best to advise me on what to try. I sadly am not a fan of mashed potatoes but she said those were her fav!.. I decided to go with a leg and thigh with a side of Corn & Bacon, my Mom ordered a chicken Sandwhich with fries ... The way its set up you get food delivered to your table... Be sure to remember some cash to leave a tip if you get the quality of service like I did. My drinks were filled any time they got low  and table cleared off  the whole time by an awesome dude named Sam.  After reading the reviews of this place I was not expecting to be blown away which might be why I was pleasantly surprised but I really did have an enjoyable experience here. I tried this place at lunch time on a Friday with my Mother. I opted to skip out on the soda offerings because as much as I am not picky concerning my chicken.. I am very picking when it comes to spending 2.50 a soda and cane sugar machine is awesome but had potential to be a toss up.. Next time I may give it a shot to see if I enjoy any of it. As you may have read in prior reviews they do put a seasoning on their chicken. It has a bit of a kick but for me it was the right balance of spice without being over powering. The chicken was cooked perfectly and I love the fact they offer HONEY  and hot sauce. The french fries weren't something I was in love with but they had a nice enough taste. I loved the Corn with Bacon it was delicious and helped balance out my meal. The sandwich that came with my Mothers meal was HUGE she couldn't eat all of it so I was able to take a bite and the Bun was really yummy and the pickled cucumbers helped give it an extra kick. I really loved this place. I know the price point isn't that great considering but if you are like me and love fried chicken and get sick of the quality offered by any of the fast food chains this place is worth the extra money. Just keep in mind you may get a better deal if you go ala carte. For us it was a little over $20 for my two pieces of chicken and small side plus my Mom's sandwich meal. We opted as stated to just go with water but they still were great about keeping that full and they offer wipes for your hands . I was BLOWN away by how attentive Sam was making sure we had everything we needed , not to mention making sure we were enjoying our food and had enough water. He was friendly and managing at least 6 other tables which all appeared to be taken care of. I can't wait to come back and try more things but if you keep in mind the location of this place and most things come at a higher price point for food its worth checking out. The quality of the food was all amazing and for me it was great service. I will wait till I try it this place out again to go full five stars but I could not let the great experience go undocumented.

Also, I understand they just opened but this wasn't really a quality issue as much as a quantity issue. However, the food or should I say the lack there of, was actually quite insulting. Charging $8+ for a small chicken finger on a bun and trying to pass it off as a chicken sandwich is downright criminal. Worse? How about $7 for a large fries. Yup... $7 for fries with no toppings or anything. Just fries. Plain fries. $7. For a portion size no bigger than you get in a large fries at McDonalds. Back to the sandwich... ordered ""The Rancher"" which states bacon & ranch dressing. Received ""0"" bacon. Also had asked for no cucumbers but they were on there. This is OK actually as I mentioned they just opened and these are kinks that need to work out... I'm OK with that. Not part of why I gave two stars... it only added to the frustration of the portion sizes and pricing.

The taste was pretty good... enjoyed the fries more than the sandwich but that also may have been out of pure anger with the size of the sandwich. Actually enjoyed the sauce options that I tried as well. The Chipolte Honey had a nice kick. 

Maybe I was over-hyped for this place? I see some folks enjoyed their meals. I felt robbed and won't be back until they fix the portion sizes. I have never been still hungry after an $8+ sandwich and fries. Wish them luck and hope they can fix these issues.

Let me start by saying that as chicken joints go, it is somewhat pricier than KFC etc. But you know what? You'll pay more for a burger at 5 guys than Mac's too, and anyone who's been to both will tell you there's no comparison. Which is the case here. This is simply the BEST fried chicken I have ever eaten. Crunchy, well seasoned coating, meat was moist and flavorful. Combos come with HUGE pile o'fries as well as coleslaw (if you can handle spicy, opt for the spicy slaw). Well worth the price, IMO.

Now for that other item. I am a big fan of chicken livers, and you can get an order of fried chicken livers with fried caramelized onions. Not for everyone, but definitely for me. Absolutely amazing!

Founded by the Bromberg Brothers and featuring the duo's first foray into the 'burbs, Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken arrived in Downtown Summerlin by way of New York earlier this summer and although the quick casual concept has been questioned for high prices as well as uneven cooking ever since opening it was with a friend and his child that I sat down for lunch on Saturday, almost every off-putting rumor soon confirmed.

Nicely lit and well adorned with amenities including motion sensing trash compactors, LCD televisions, housemade sauces, plus a fountain featuring artisan sodas from Boylan's, a visit to Blue Ribbon begins at a counter with smiling servers - the dining decisions largely sandwiches, combos, and sides with additional options for shakes or salads, plus single tenders, wings, or thighs.

Taking note of a few specials, the August-only ""Smorgasbird"" with a portion of the proceeds benefiting  Multiple Sclerosis offered in addition to perplexingly priced hush puppies - $3.75 for a half-dozen or $7.95 for ten - it was after some perusal that an order soon completed, the fifteen minute wait with one of those vibrating flashy buzzers spent sitting in one of several unpadded booths.

Certainly not a cheap meal, the total before tax and tip north of $55 for what would prove less than enough to sate a family of four were it not for the three excellent pieces of egg bread wrapped around the charitable sandwich, it was largely a matter of principle that the Smorgasbird was ordered and with two boneless cutlets spiced quite unlike the Bromberg chicken at Blue Ribbon or Brooklyn Bowl suffice it to say that each piece was almost too dry on its own to be enjoyable, the better bites found in barbequed bits serve atop cheesy fries tinged in peppers while anemic looking tomatoes made one question sourcing during the ingredients peak time of year.

Finding the tenders to be as oddly spiced and devoid of moisture as the cutlets while wings at least maintained their texture thanks to the presence of a bone, it was onward to sides that the meal progressed and although the hushpuppies were each quite small the flavors of sweet corn were thankfully prominent, the same not to be said of soft collards barely bolstered by pork let alone the 'adobo corn' which certainly would have benefited greatly from some salt.

At this point seeing the emperor for his lack of clothes while wondering why the duo opts to change their chicken at each venue when the original version is the one that earned them such acclaim, it was in a trio of shakes that the meal concluded and although none were particularly innovative each was clearly crafted of good ice cream, the vanilla trending a bit thin and mellow while the Nutella and caramel were decidedly sweet and thick enough to stick a spoon up straight.

Overpriced and overseasoned with little more than a 'name' to justify the hype Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken joins the likes of most of Downtown Summerlin's imported eateries, a situation that makes one wonder just how long the public will continue to bite.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,18,9,2,OG0NLNm_NoRpqbfmDEBBKw

Location - It's on the North end of Downtown Summerlin. There's easy parking and entertainment if you want to walk or shop off the calories after lunch or dinner. The restaurant has plenty of seats and lots of natural lights. I love sitting by the window and watching dogs walk by. 

Food - Best fried chicken in Vegas! We ordered the chicken tenders and wings during our first visit. The seasoning gives a little kick to the typical fried chicken dish. The French fries are just the right amount of crispy and there's so, so many different sauces to choose from. We also ordered the Mac n' cheese. It wasn't the most memorable dish compared to the rest but chicken and macaroni and cheese just feels right together. During our second visit we ordered the Firebird sandwich and the Rancher sandwich. The Firebird sandwich was so spicy (just the way I like it, hehe) and my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy his lunch as well. The sandwich is a pretty hefty size and I could only eat about half of it. On top of that, there's special sodas and iced teas. 

Service - The cashier was really nice. He offered his recommendations and made conversation - something that a lot of people falter to do. It progressively got busier as we ate and everyone was still getting helped.

I love that I'm not confused the minute I walk in. The menus clearly show you how to order, and the descriptions are fool-proof. We went with the classic Blue Ribbon chicken sandwich, and the tenders for the kids. I also got 2 extra pieces of chicken leg and their house salad. 

Don't waste your time with a salad at this place! I should've gotten 2 more pieces of chicken and skipped the salad. Not sure what I was thinking ordering a salad from a place known for their fried chicken, but that was my mistake. It's not that the salad was horrible, just nothing amazing. All of the attention should have been on the chicken, and whatever fantastic seasoning they put on it. The fries are fantastic! Not too salty, just right and they have a crunch to them... so delicious but frustrating as it's easy to just sit there and devour waaaay too many.

We ordered ""The Bird"" a family meal which is pretty much equals to a whole chicken. It comes with 2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 wings, 2 drumsticks and 2 large sides of coleslaw and fries. Also got ""The Pit""sandwich; crisp chicken with aged cheddar, bacon, slaw, and bbq sauce on bun.

Their fried chicken was super crispy, juicy, and flavorful! Doesn't compare to KFC, POPEYES, ETC... It's a bit pricier but your pretty much paying a gourmet fried chicken and you'll be wanting more.. trust me! 

The sandwich bun can be better though. It starts with its quality, plain and dry. It seems like an ordinary packaged bun store bought lol. Unlike other buns, they are a tad thicker and moist. So I'd rather order their chicken instead of sandwiches when coming here. Coleslaw I ain't to hyped for but can be improved by not being too plain.. add more color to it, more purple lettuce and carrots. 

Many dipping sauces to choose from. Wasabi honey is pretty good, like sweet horseradish. Chipotle BBQ honey, sweet with a little kick. I love spicy so ketchup and louisiana hot sauce will do for my chicken! 

Staff were great, seating area were clean except condiments. Those bottles need to be wiped after guests leave. We don't wanna touch greasy bottles and eat. Needed to wipe them myself. Other than that, I will be back for their chicken and fries!",5QjxYqp5nYKqfbSMjv1ztQ,1,0,5,WSwi7FMbFlLGSedLCovnvg

For add-ins, the wasabi honey is my favorite. It's just a hint of heat and sweetness, although the sandwich is good alone. Also, I am a fan of their fries and coleslaw. The fries are thin, shoe-string type and they are crispy on the outside and mashed potato-y on the inside, and not so greasy. I am usually not a fan of coleslaw mostly because I do not like mayo, but this coleslaw was pretty good! It is vinegary and not very creamy at all, which might not appeal to some people but was good for me. They also have their own recipe sodas and sweet and ice tea.

I'll get straight to the food, we got the 5 wing combo and the 2 boneless thigh combo.  The chicken was moist and the skin was crispy at least on the wings.  But there was a consistent lack of flavor in both the wings and the thighs.  I saw the famous seasoning dusted on the chicken, but it still lacked flavor.  The thigh and wing meat was also flavorless.  The wings are a better idea than the thighs.  The thighs are thick, meaning lots of flavorless chicken in between the fried coating.  And my thighs had a nice coating of oil/grease at the bottom that soaked through the brown tray, leaving the skin on the bottom of the thighs soggy.  We did not have this problem with the wings.  A positive is the portion size, very generous portion of chicken and fries.  The fries were nice and crispy shoe string fries, but the cole slaw side was forgettable.

I've never eaten in the restaurant, I have postmated it in the past and I will likely not let my laziness lead to another mediocre meal.

-Sandwiches. I've had a few of these. I've had the blue ribbon, the rancher, and the pit. All of them are just pretty bleh. The piece of chicken is huge and doesnt fit (one time I had two pieces of chicken so they would just fall right out). It tastes fine I guess. Basically the whole thing is a soggy mess. Doesn't work.

-Hush Puppies. Dry and bland.

-Smoked mac n cheese. Meh I guess this is fine but velveeta mac n cheese you make at home would even be better than this.

-Corn. It looks like the corn on the menu is different than it used to be but it used to be pretty pretty pretty bad.

Fries. Totally forgettable. Especially the loaded with the works fries and the gravy fries. Just kinda gross.

5. The price is well worth the amount of food you get.
6. Last but not least. There is a server named Sam. Nicest and most attentive server I have ever encountered in the many times I have ever ate at downtown summerlin. And he not only cleans the tables. He also keeps an eye out on ALL the customers and makes sure their dining experience is top notch. I pay a lot of attention to servers and it's a big part of whether or not I go back to a place. Everything from helping you refill your drinks. To grabbing more to-go containers and asking at the most appropriate times before I need anything. The most impressive part was how he handled the situation as he was the only server and there were many tables filled. I went to tell my coworkers he was the poster child of what the service industry should be!

Went above and beyond my expectations of a server at this restaurant. Service was 10 STARS!

I went to speak to his manager today 07/01/15 - and told him. Manager was also a very kind man - you can see his eyes light up when I told him about Sam.

Sam is outstanding - I even asked for his photo to let the world see how great service is highly appreciated.

I will be sure to come here again soon!!",aRCgIZC777LOtgv7J97tNQ,2,1,5,cWxJxm7AdVuvE9g2iTDQHQ

I originally came here on a date, and wasn't expecting much. I mean, it's chicken, how good can a random chicken shop possibly be?

Well, the truth slapped me in the face with delicious flavours and unique but trendy side dippings (Cough, Honey Sriracha, Cough.) 

The chicken wings are nicely sized, there's a lot of meat on each chicken, and they're always cooked to perfection. The crispy breading is undoubtedly almost on par with that of Roscoe's chicken and waffles.

Sadly, the date didn't go so well, but my fondness for this joint did, I've returned time and time again to Downtown Summerlin just for the chicken.

5653805,2015-09-03,0,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"My daughter and I stopped in to try this new spot in downtown Summerlin for a quick meal. This is a fairly new business and I was anxious to try as DTS posted an amazing, yummy looking photo on Instagram earlier that day made my mouth water.

I ordered the Blue Ribbon chicken sandwich (what they are known for) which I felt was really overpriced at approximately $6.79 and I made it a combo which included fries, cole slaw and a drink (add on another $2.50). My daughter ordered the kids meal which was one chicken tender with fries at over $5. We were given a pager that would tell us when our food was ready. I found their prices to be a bit high for a fast food joint.

We walked over to the soda machine which by the way they have their own soda which is ""cane soda"". My daughter chose the root beer, which neither of us really liked. We found a table to sit at and there were probably about three tables with people sitting and eating. I noticed the sauces on the table which I would learn I would need to use in order to give this chicken any taste.

Our food arrived in about ten minutes and was delivered by one of the staff who was very nice. I was excited to try my sandwich and decided to try the honey chipotle sauce. I took my first bite and was immediately disappointed. There was really no flavor to the chicken even with their ""special sauce"" and the honey chipotle. The bun was soft and the veggies were fresh but I have had better chicken sandwiches elsewhere! There was a generous serving of shoestring fries which were hot and crispy. The meal also came with cole slaw which had a weird vinegar taste....(not my style).

I would like to thank the young man who came by a couple of times to check on us and to see if we needed anything. He also promptly cleared our table when we were done. He was the highlight of our visit and deserves to be commended for providing great service.

Perhaps I picked an off day as I had planned on this meal being delicious, but instead I will stick with Popeyes or Canes for good chicken at a decent price!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,3,1,2,VoJgdkfrC2420SaUJgv6yA

I watched as he diligently worked the floor, made sure the customers had everything they needed and even stopped them from bringing their own trays to the trash. He seemed very thoughtful and even offered us some extra ranch as soon as our food was ready. They're lucky to have him!

The food was okay. Original, yes. The dry-rubbed chicken almost had that home-made touch to it and the fries were really good. I think where this place lacks is a signature sauce. While it offered plenty of Chipotle-something, Honey-something and BBQ.. It wasn't anything extraordinary or different from store bought. I felt it needed something else. It would have been okay except for the fact that for two adults, the tab was almost 30 bucks. We each had 3 pieces of chicken, fries and a drink. 30 bucks felt a bit steep for the meal. I felt for what we paid.. it just didn't match the price. Same thing at Caine's would've been half the cost and I wouldn't gotten their garlic bread.

If you get a drink, or a side, you're going to pay upwards of $15 per person - which is hardly affordable for non organic chicken fingers and fries.

Combos are your best value option because they come with fries and coleslaw instead of paying $3.50+ ala cart for sides. I made sure to double check that the fries weren't those disgusting crinkle cut fries ala Raising Canes before I ordered. I chose the 2 tenders & fries combo, and subbed pickled cucumbers for the coleslaw. It took maybe 10 minutes to come out, but the food tasted fresh.

The chicken has a dry rub coating - definitely needed sauce. Luckily every table has its own sauce caddy with bbq sauce, 3 types of honey and 2 hot sauces, in addition to the white sauce that the combo comes with.

I mixed the white sauce, ancho chipotle honey and wildflower honey and put it on everything. This sauce combo definitely made the chicken over the top and was incredible on the fries too.

3 stars is in no way bad. If it was more of a value, I'd bump up the stars. Maybe things are turning around for this place as my food was cooked well and tasted nice.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,1,0,3,dJBL8LiB4RGloMnh4WfONQ

5707103,2016-06-02,2,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken was featured on MSN / Spoon University as the 10th spot for the 25 Best Places to Get Fried Chicken in America, and we decided to visit the Las Vegas/ Summerlin location.

The restaurant is located half hour outside the Strip, in the Festival Plaza in downtown Summerlin, across the street from the Red Rock Casino.The GPS wasn't quite accurate, and the restaurant said to go past the Lazy Dog Cafe, and they were located across from Shake Shack and Wolf Gang Puck. 

We found the place, with plenty of parking and at 5:30 pm on a Monday, there was also plenty of places to sit inside.  We walked up to the counter and looked at the combination of chicken you could get.  Their chicken tenders were popular, and so were the chicken pieces.  I chose to get the White combination (breast and wing) which came with cole slaw and fries, and also an order of their tenders. Stephen ordered the same but with spicy slaw, while Mom got the 2 drumsticks.  The meal for 3 with drinks came to $42.

 The food came out within 10 minutes.  The chicken wasn't what I was expecting. It was coated in like a dry rub, more than a traditional buttermilk dipped fried chicken.  The outside wasn't crunchy but it did have a spice on it instead.  I would say its like the KFC fried chicken... its fried, but not crunchy fried.

 There were sauces to use on the chicken, which were mostly made of honey.  The sauce did add great flavor to the chicken, but on its own, the chicken was just ok.  I really loved the skinny fries, but the cole slaw was sub par.. very watery and not creamy.  They carry an independent soda company, as well as sweet and non sweet teas.

I would not go out of my way to eat here. However, if I were to visit Red Rock (the hotel/ casino or the national park), I would stop by here for lunch or dinner.",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,7,3,4,-hcxSZPwGXSpQDq6BBbIuA
5715390,2015-06-22,5,tMYYSWyTppDcF070Hmy-kQ,"Went there today 6-21-15 for lunch. Stood awkwardly at the front for about 5 minutes before anyone could be bothered to take my order. 

I got a three piece chicken tender combo. When I hear ""combo"" I automatically think fries and a drink....not the case here. A combo is just the tenders,  fries, and cole slaw. I thought that was weird...especially since the combo was over $12.  So I got the ""combo"" with a root beer and asked for my fries loaded (topped with sour cream, cheese, and bacon).  The total was almost twenty bucks...more than I want to spend for lunch.  

The place was pretty busy and there were only four open tables but they were all dirty.  I just sat down anyways...cuz' that's how I roll.  A little chicken crumbs never hurt anybody and I don't want to be ""that lady"" and ask to have the table wiped down.  

These tenders were not good, ya'll.  Yes they were fresh, they were hot, they were moist, but there is a weird dry rub on the outside and the inside is really bland.  I could easily make these in my kitchen.  They have many sauces to try to disguise their bland chicken:
1) Habanero hot sauce - Just gross.  No tanginess at all...just sweet and slightly spicy.  Skip it. I much prefer Frank's Red Hot or buffalo sauce. 
2) Barbecue- Standard barbecue sauce...tastes just like the kind you get at the grocery store. 
3) Wasabi honey- This is literally wasabi-flavored honey.  It is watery and disgusting and I don't know who in the world likes this. 
4) Wildflower honey- Once again....this is just plain honey.  Who is dipping their chicken in honey?  This place doesn't even have biscuits so I dunno why they have honey. 
5) Chipotle barbecue- See #2

The coleslaw was awful.  I actually spit it out.  It's just cabbage, carrots, and vinegar.  Yuck.  

The fries were delicious.  The root beer was delicious.  

Cane's is about twenty times better and half the price.  I have no reason to go back here.  If I ever did end up back here I'd try something else...like maybe the wings or a sandwich.  The tenders are not worth it.

*update* When I ate there I asked the cashier if I could substitute the cole slaw for the pickled cucumbers and I was denied but I've read a couple of yelp reviews where yelpers were allowed to do this.

Don't know if I'll eat here again. Maybe it was because i tried a sandwich and not chicken strips.

this place is good. it's not over the top amazing and i wouldn't come back here again if i wasn't in the area. i live in henderson and this place is located in summerlin so it is a far drive; 30 minutes. i ordered a combo called the drum line ($8.50) which is two drumsticks which originally comes with french fries and coleslaw. you can substitute both. however, in order to substitute the coleslaw, they only have two options. i believe it's either spicy mayo (i forget) or extra french fries. but in order for you to have extra fries instead of coleslaw, you need to keep the first set of french fries it comes with. so you'd get double french fries. the chicken was seasoned and it was good, but like i said earlier nothing special. their french fries are normal fries that are skinny. my boyfriend ordered a sandwich called the pit ($7.50) which has lettuce, bacon, bbq sauce, cheese. the bun was cold but overall the sandwich was good but didn't make him satisfyingly full and it's not worth the 30-40 minute drive. also for the price totaling $20 isn't a fair price for the quality of food. it's not even comparable to other chicken places.

Fried Chicken:
Looks heavily seasoned but can't taste anything. Have to eat it with their sauce. Their breading is very different from other fried chicken place but not in a good way. 

Mashed potato: 
For a large size it is pretty small and taste like any mashed potato. 

Cole slaw: 
Doesn't have much taste to it and I didn't finish it (which is rare because I usually finish any food that is in front of me)

They make their soda which is very interesting but I'm not a fan. 

Overall I think this place is on the pricier side for the amount of food you get. I think if I ever come back I'll probably only get their fries.",iGtInQDTZ89mKnkhFWdlfA,3,0,2,TWImFiPR8LDh_VZclWTNlw

My husband however thought his sandwich (the pit) was great but the spotlight of the experience was the regular French fries. 

The staff was very nice. Maybe next time I'll just try a chicken strip basket and not a sandwich.",vqe-wt1H-H6AksHY252-tA,1,0,3,4vbOsaIGxJ475DGA-qA8PQ

Staff is friendly. The restaurant is clean and has several TVs to watch. 
The drink fountain is not your typical - cane sugar drinks. Again takes a bit of getting used to.  I had the ginger ale - tasty, but took a bit to get used to
The place is more expensive than expected. Maybe because it's Summerlin? Three piece with a drink , including their string fries (these were very good and plentiful) was about $12.",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,1,1,3,-ohs8mOlhiKnPMvh5LtVIA
