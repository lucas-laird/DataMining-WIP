Their cheese pizza is one of the best in Las Vegas, plenty of cheese even if you don't order extra cheese on it. Very reasonable Prices and great family meal specials. 

Large Pepperoni Pizza + 2 liter of soda for $10 bucks. (requires a coupon, but they print millions of them) You can't beat that!",zFszUTKwfFIWK6EAYCyR7Q,1,1,5,FXt5DVhmBse9R8lnfU1wuA

Their pizza crust is out of this world, and if you ever have a large off site events, as in big office parties,  its phenomenal. Their antipasti salad presentation is worthy of any high end restaurant in the city. We usually get the pizza and wing special, and it is enough for our entire family of six with left overs the next morning (or at 3am if you get a hankering for some nice cold pizza and a beer in the middle of the night). The restaurant itself is very East Coast and homey; not a bar, but a great place for the kids to eat themselves into a carb coma while mom and dad have a beer and watch TV. Staff is beyond nice and the owners treat you just like they do out East; not pretentious, just like being at a neighbor's house for a few slices and some great wings.",4yG4J05aKzE2zov0Jr37kg,1,1,5,B0o1irXrYb3P7-wl18f7Tw

We decided to come here to order some pasta. Mama Luigi's is known for their pizza and next time that is what we will stick to. I ordered Linguine with Clams (white sauce) and the bf ordered the Chicken Parmigiana. My linguine was overcooked and the clams were from a can. What a disappointment especially since they charged 15.95 for that sucker. It also had so much ""sauce"" or rather buttah that I felt like it was more soup than anything. I didn't get to try the chicken parmigiana, but the bf said that the spaghetti was al dente and the chicken was good. Overall, I thought that it was cutely decorated inside and I will return for some ""pie"" instead of pasta.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,9,6,3,G9WCTr2ADAbZrQqdLNbkUg
