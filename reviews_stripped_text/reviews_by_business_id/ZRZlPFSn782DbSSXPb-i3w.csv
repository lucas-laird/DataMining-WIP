The only thing I actually ate was the omelet, that was freshly made at the omelet bar. Then I filled myself up on fresh fruit. The other food options were not so great, and the waiter never came to pick up the plates we were done with.   Even though it was breakfast, they had other options including fried chicken, fried shrimp, mashed potatoes, which looked like they were last week's leftovers. Upon leaving, they gave us a souvenir cup. I definitely would not pay to eat here. Hopefully, this place will be a part of their renovations.",PJaUi_p8ZqeeX2OfSAkCyw,0,0,2,Y4FpgEfgpcSOFGp4paBekA

I went here for dinner while wandering along the strip one night and I thought it was your typical buffet with a wide variety of options that weren't gourmet but still good.  I think the key is to choose the right options.  The crab legs were awesome and totally worth the $20 since I probably ate $30 of legs alone.  Other favorites included prime rib, mashed potatoes, and spicy tuna rolls.  Salad bar was just OK and so were the desserts.

This is a really good deal if you are hungry! The atmosphere is pretty tacky but it is within the Imperial Palace so that's to be expected.",Q6PIexKxto5LKJ6wEKvrwA,3,4,3,z-g6g9-n9GPIYuspynyzuQ

Unfortunately, it quickly became a ""hells no"" :(
Tuesday morning, circa 10:30am, there was no line and no wait for a table. Great! My tummy was growling, mouth salivating, and my mind racing with all the yummy things I was gonna pile on my plate. Got to our table and I promptly ran to grab a plate. Salad bar? Eh, not for breakfast.  Omlette bar? Looks alright, but I don't eat eggs. Pass. Meat station? Not for a vegetarian! I settled on a couple pancakes with syrup, diced potatoes, biscuit w/jelly and lemonade. Unfortunately, if you don't eat meat or eggs, your choices are pretty limited.

Pancakes were rubbery and the syrup is the cheap kind - thin, watery sweet stuff. Biscuit was alright, but cold. Diced potatoes tasted like the frozen generic brand from your local Vons. The lemonade (as well as OJ and apple juices) was not drinkable - i'm not kidding, I couldnt force this stuff down! It tasted like a powedered drink mix full of chemicals that they added tap water too. SO NASTY!

After not being able to eat anything on my plate (an amazement all on it's own for a fat girl), I went for my very last remaining options: Salad bar and pastry stations. Salad was ok - I piled it high on my plate and filled it with veggies. Pretty hard to eff that up. Pastries did NOT look appetizing at all, so I just grabbed a hard, plain crissant and was on my merry lil way.

Bottom line, I spent $13 to eat low quality salad and drink water. What a disaster! Seriously - dont be a cheapo when it comes to buffets - spend a lil more and skip this place!",AKU_tzrvCj70vNR7D6HTNw,11,3,1,-aGso5Cyfr9koo1BQqgJtQ

I always believe that competition spurs businesses to compete.  The buffet at Imperial Palace is terrible.  Not only is it terrible, it is a huge rip-off at $14.

I wish I could tell you that they did something right.  This is the worst food I had all weekend in Las Vegas and I never went beyond the Imperial Palace and O'Sheas.  Yep, Burger King and Subway were delicious in comparison.


**I'll let you all in on a little secret: smother the biscuit with gravy and let it sit for 10 minutes while you try and eat anything else you may have been tempted to eat.  By the time you get to the biscuits, they're a bit softer than before.**

The pancakes were dry and the syrup was not real - watery and tasted like pure corn syrup (real healthy....).  The biscuits and gravy were awful.  the biscuits were hard as a rock and gravy was nice and lumpy with a thick film on the top.  The chef at the omlette bar was extremely friendly and helpful, but he did not have a whole lot to work with.  Thumbs down for the taste on the omlettes.

Can they even get fruit right?  Well, some woman grabbed some oranges and bananas and loaded up her coat pockets.  The time we spent at the buffet was over one hour and they never replenished the fruit basket.

The coffee was not even memorable.  Maybe, that was the only ok thing.  I'm really surprised considering the number of alternative buffets in the city.  I think my friend owes us money for pursuading us to eat here.",N7_VO8LuXnwVLA2Z27ODjQ,2,0,1,lzCjKRH-2oJtVSOKPpcETg

Never having been to Las Vegas previously, some friends and coworkers who had already visited recommended seeking out some buffets to find food for a little more reasonable price. With that in mind, we thumbed through our hotel's directory until we discovered this place down the street, Emperor's Buffet.

The place felt a little grimy right from the start, like it was in some long-forgotten part of the hotel/casino that had only recently been rediscovered. The food tasted, ehhh, okay, and it certainly didn't resemble any sort of fine dining... but hey, you've gotta eat, right? So all was okay until an hour or two after dinner when, back at the hotel, my lady started feeling nauseous.

  Anyway, I went for the brunch yesterday.  Favorite dish?  The panko-crusted fried shrimp.  They were fresh, crispy, light and delicious!  The roast beef was quite tasty, just a little salty for my liking.  I didn't hit the salad bar, but it looked okay.  It had the basics.  The desserts all looked appealing.  I only tried a few, the cannolis and mini chocolate mousses were delicious!  Of course the plentiful peel and eat shrimp were a hit.  I didn't have the omelettes, but they were looking great.  People were going for them like crazy.  
  My only complaint was that the breakfast sausages and bacon weren't presented properly.  They should have had one of those drain inserts so that the meat isn't sitting in it's own grease.  When I went back for seconds, they were putting more out (of course they put the older ones on top FIFO *first in, first out*).

Nah, I'm sure there are bound to be equally bad buffets in our great nation, but the Emperor's Buffet is surely in the running. Let me preface this review by saying that the staff deserves a good four stars, as they were very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, from the defeated looking carving chef, to the tiki masks in a chinese themed restaurant, everything else about htis buffet was substandard. Chicken noodle soup without noodles, egg drop soup that didn't appear to have any eggs in it, prime rib that was bloody red and tasted it, most everything else dry or overcooked; sad, sad, sad. My wife said ""Well, the mashed potatoes aren't bad""; if the mashed potatoes were the best thing on your menu (and they weren't-the soft serve ice cream was), you have got a serious problem. The decor, as mentioned, is from the wrong part of the world, and that attention to detail seems to infect the whole dining area. If I hadn't just spent 2 hours starving in an airport shuttle waiting to get to the Imperial Palace, and another hour getting checked in, I would have had the energy to seek out another place to eat (like Hash House A Go-Go, fifty feet in the opposite direction).

It's Vegas, its a dam buffett and sometimes buffetts are cheaper then the restaurants.  Not the case for this one, its worth paying more to go to a restaurant.  Worse buffett I been to. Small selection, and OMG the food was all terrible.  I know at some buffetts some food can taste like its out of the box, or it rubbed up against the oven, but dam this is terrible. 

Sushi is all bad, the rice was mushy, chinese food tasted like it was the bottom of a burnt barrell, pasta was like canned food, american food was over cooked or just tasted like spoiled ass.  The salad bar was probably the only safe thing to eat.  Their desserts is even worse. I had a slice of apple pie and that tasted like plastic.

This magical pass allows you to enjoy all day access to the buffets at 7 different Harrah's properties. The price is $39.99 for Rewards Club members and $45.99 for non-members. It is seriously easy to sign up for the pass and worth the $5 savings. The best day to buy the pass is Sunday because the brunch buffets include the booze free of charge. Also, remember to check the operating hours at each buffet because they do vary.

Note: We did all seven locations (actually 8 buffets because we hit one twice) back to back in 11 hours.

The buffets included in the deal are: Le Village Buffet inside Paris, Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet, Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet, Flavors at Harrah's, Lago Buffet at Caesars, the Emperor's Buffet at Imperial Palace and Rio's Carnival World Buffet!

Emperor's Buffet at Imperial Palace-Ummm, one word...DISGUSTING! No really, skip this stop completely! Aside from the staff being nicer than pie, the space is dingy...downright squalid really, and the food is inedible. FAIL!!!",QmH5O1JHDOBvUqzr4vz5-Q,2,0,1,aK9ax0AZR1LDm6EiAupfRA

1. Le Village Buffet @ Paris
2. Emperor's Buffet @ Imperial Palace
3. Carnival World Buffet @ Rio
4. Spice Market Buffet @ Planet Hollywood

I feel bad for finally giving a one-star because I'd like to believe that the chef here actually cares a little bit about what he puts out there... I'd really like to believe that.

Well, upon walking into this hotel, you get a sense of... abandonment.  Seriously, I enjoyed walking through the place to find the buffet because I felt like I was in some lame B film set in a dying hotel.

One of the first things I noticed upon being seated was our server giving us paper napkins.  Le Village Buffet gave us actual cloth ones...

Later on, we kindly asked the server if we could get a Coke, and she impatiently replied that the machine was right ""over there.""  We guiltily pointed out that our initial order was never taken, and we didn't have cups.  At that point, our server sincerely apologized and took our drink order.  Ok, I lied.  My friend gave her our order, and told me about the incident after she sat back down... and I would LIKE to believe that the server was genuinely apologetic.  But who knows.

I'm ranting too long about a 1-star place though.  And I don't like to complain *too* much.  The food was... edible.  Ok, maybe it wasn't that bad.  I can't remember.

Our second stop during our 24 hour Buffet binge. And I must say, if this is what the Emperor is eating on a nightly basis, I feel sorry for him.

The food here is horrendous. It's old, it's stale, seems like food has been sitting there since the morning and we hit this place around 6pm. People always complain about those greasy, dirty Chinese Buffets but if given a choice, to paraphrase Patrick Henry, 'Give me Chinese Buffet, or Give me Death'. 

You wanna know how bad this place is? I saw rats leaving the buffet in masses and heading for the nearest dumpster.

The buffet is totally empty on a Sunday morning and the decor is reminiscent of a sad, forgotten, dimly lit tiki restaurant. The food is just not good. There is absolutely nothing special about this buffet.

The omlette bar had some fresh cut vegetables, but I agree the end result was not the best.  It is still probably one of the safer ways to navigate your way through this buffet jungle.

You can give some of the meats like bacon and sausage a try, but I cannot say it is going to be on par with Burger King or Mickey D's.  Well, how about a waffle or some flapjacks?  They taste like they were placed in someone's lab coat pockets for a day and then placed over heat.  The syrup - I think it's straight up corn syrup and water.  Might as well use the stuff as a chaser.

Any redeeming factors?  The service is average.  The chef at the omlette bar is a nice guy.  The silverware is clean and they have orange juice.  The coffee does the job, but do not expect the freshness you get from Juan Valdez and his mule.",VgUVbTX-dQoItaBXp0Yeww,0,0,1,If7hLqOTobt5HOrQY1WA8g

I've eaten all meals here, breakfast, lunch and dinner. I can't really knock them too much because they're one of the least expensive buffets on the Center Strip. The items are all basic stuff. Eggs and bacon (yummy turning into bleh) for breakfast, turkey carving station and fried chicken for lunch, meatloaf and roast carving station for dinner.
