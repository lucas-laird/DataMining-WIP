I ordered the Korean BBQ beef burrito. It consists of lettuce, cheese, queso fresco, white rice, Korean BBQ, and avocado. Accompanying the burrito was a handful of micro thin sweet potato fries that provide a nice garnish for the burrito.  

The beef has the same sweet flavor as bulgogi and the white rice is perfectly cooked. The avocado really puts this burrito over the top. I felt this was a true representation of fusion food.",HEzVlIJeVpwjiNCPXNM-aA,0,0,4,yX8TkKv4AsmQjuKXV9P5_g

But I hate to say it... I was pretty disappointed.  The tacos themselves were pretty good, but they put so much 'filler' with them to make it look like you're getting lots of food... that really annoyed me.

They brag about the ""3 different kids of lettuce,""  but really people... do you get excited about eating lettuce??  I don't!!  The meat hidden under the mounds of lettuce was pretty yummy but I don't feel like I should have to search to get to it.

I felt the same about their 'sweet potato fries.""  It's very clever how the cut them suuuuuuper thin so when they put a giant handfull of them on your plate, it looks like a massive mound of food.  But in reality there's nothing substantial there at all.

There was some kind of yummy dark brown sauce that came with the tacos that was super delicious.  If they had given me tortillas actually FILLED with their meat, with some of that sauce and a LITTLE bit of lettuce... I would have been a happy girl.  But instead, I left feeling pretty jipped.

It also came with the same sauces as the tacos. This I wasn't to fond of because the bread was so thick that I couldn't enjoy the sweet salty flavor of the marinated BBQ beef. However, this is how a torta should be. I would suggest maybe putting extra meat or ordering it (if available). The fries were not shoestring but smaller. It was a little too much for me. I am not a fan of these at all. And somewhere underneath these you will find the sauces and fork. WHY DO THEY DO THIS?  They do offer tortilla chips. I would go here again thats for sure.

They advertise themselves as ""LA Style"", but that is misleading. Their food is way better than what you get from the Korean taco trucks in LA. This place had a better taste, was less messy, and less greasy. The food tasted like true fusion cuisine. I've eaten at many of the Korean taco trucks in the LA area and while they are good, I've always felt that they were basically serving Korean food in a tortilla. This place balances the influences better to create something unique.

My only concerns were that their menu seems limited. They are a small place, but you'd think they'd at least be able to offer as many items as a taco truck. Also they are slightly overpriced. A burrito is $6 whereas they are usually $5 from the places I usually go to. You do get the sweet potato fries with them, but I didn't even finish mine.

Since our fridge has been dying a slow death this week, fresh vegetables have been a rare indulgence and I knew I wanted as many as I could find; that's when I remembered the mixed salad that they offered here.  

And with that salad, my friends, I quickly found myself in veggie heaven! The food came in TWO of the big plastic containers, wrapped up in a plastic bag. One of the containers had salsa, several of their special black sauces, several of the red spicy sauces, tons of their sweet potato strings and cuttlery. There was the lettuce mixture, plus; bean sprouts salad, carrots, cucumber, zucchini, spinach salad, cilantro, rice, wakame, spicy beef, shredded omelet, green onion and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting.

This place is so good and so hilarious!  I'll explain.

My first trip, I tried the spicy chicken burrito.  It's actually kind of sweet, which I wasn't expecting, but they gave me a bottle of their excellent hot sauce and that solved the problem.  It's super yummy!  It comes with avocado and a big chunk of cotija cheese in the middle.  I know the cotija cheese may sound weird, but is actually really, really good.  I talked to the nice man who took my order and he said they can make the burrito more spicy next time.

While I was there, they blasted I Will Always Love You by Whitney Houston, More Than Words by Extreme, and the theme song to Annie!  Crazy!  I Will Always Love You has been stuck in my head since.

Next time, I tried the beef tacos and ordered them actually spicy. Which apparently means you order them regular but spicy. The tacos were also very, very good.  Overstuffed tacos with lots of cilantro and cabbage.  You can't possibly keep everything in the taco but it makes a nice little salad when stuff falls out and they give you a fork so it's all good!  The friendly man taking orders came out and gave me a mixture of jalapenos, celery, and soy sauce to put on my tacos.  Very yummy and not overpoweringly spicy.

The music... they blasted Creep by TLC and, again, I Will Always Love You!  Nooooo!  Just when I got it out my head, now it's back.  :)

They are open 10am until 10pm... 9pm during winter.  Closed on Sunday.  This would be a great late night drunk place.  I can totally see myself trashed at 3am belting out I Will Always Love You while eating beef tacos.  But alas, not open that late.  I'll have to start getting drunk during the day.

The only thing I didn't really like is the sweet potato strings that come with each order.  Maybe I'm on sweet potato overload since it seems to be so common now.

2732723,2010-12-10,0,hkpP3kY_x_zVpVz8gQ0ErA,"This is definitely one of my favorite fusion taco stand places in town. It's right down the street from my work so I literally spent 5 days eating lunch here and figured out that if you call in your order to pick up, there is MUCH less waiting for your food which I assume takes a while because it's made fresh. 

I think my 2 favorite things from here are the burritos and the wings. The wings are a special that I don't think he serves everyday, but seems to serve pretty often. They're crispy, spicy, sweet, and sticky, and will even make you contemplate eating part of the napkin it got stuck to because it's so good. The burritos are really good too, and I like them because they're different. He adds some slices of what I think is cotija cheese inside, as opposed to whatever shredded cheese is used at higher-end to-go burrito places (ie, Zaba's, Chipotle, Cafe Rio, etc.), as well as avocado, and slices of tomoato. The rice is super tasty, I haven't been able to figure out quite what's in it and what makes it so addicting, but it's like a sticky white rice rather than the toasted mexican rice used in other places. However, I think the thing that I am least impressed with is the meat. I don't know if it's just because I think the meat-to-other ingredients ratio is off, or my expectations of flavor, but I honestly can't tell when it's ""spicy"" or not, or even what the difference is between the regular meats and the ""Korean BBQ"".  Nonetheless it hasn't detracted from my love for the food, although I do wish they'd expand their menu a bit more. As evidenced by the wings and their super-fresh ingredients, I think they could go far with more dishes if they had the capacity. 

The only other gripe I had is that I asked for tortilla chips a few times and the guy kept saying ""Yeah sure!"" because it's advertised on their menus, but to this day I've never gotten them. Maybe they think their sweet potato sticks are better, but some days ya just need a chip.",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,3,0,4,MO_4YirWD4-aGmVedhZNxg

I was in Las Vegas with my friends and we feel like having Korean food. For some reason, not a lot of place open on Sunday for korean food. I found this place on Yelp and decide to give it a try. The place is a fusion of korean and mexican food. 

I love the yellow truck-theme. It's like a mobile home that's serving food out of their window. It's entertaining to look at. If you want to sit and eat, there are chairs and table outside where you can enjoy the nice breeze.

I like the fact that the menu is not loaded with a bunch of stuff, but instead a few simple items like In & Out. So you don't get frustrated deciding what to pick. 

I order a burrito with korean bbq meat and it was so good! Usually am not a fan of burrito, but I love korean bbq meat! Their sweet potatoes fries that come with the meal was also something. The way it's very thinly cut make it very crunchy.

The mix with mexican food sounded awful at first quite frankly, but after my first bite I was hooked. Who knew bulgolgi went so well with avocados and sour cream?! 

Another great bonus is that you get sweet potato chips with your meal. Which frankly are better than any other sweet potato chip I've had in this town.

cause you're making great food son
your building is big and yellow
just like the sun

oh let me get that beef burrito
without a drink
munching on the sweet potatoes
within a blink
I ask myself where did my food go. 

Did any of that even make sense? 

9091 is the one of the newer gems of Las Vegas for street eats, it serves up health friendly Korean influenced items from tacos to chicken wings. The influence ranges anywhere from the large variety of vegetables, spices or the marinade used. Perhaps you should consider the bi bim bop (if available) burrito if you enjoy your vegetables. Most items will come with either tortilla chips or thin straw sweet potato fries, which I originally found a little difficult to eat because they were so crispy, but during my most recent visit they were slightly larger and less crispy, thus easier for my consumption.

Obviously by the creative name ""9091"" the place it is a spin on the ""gogi"" of Southern Cali, but I think it's as good or better than the ""original"" concept. 

On my first visit, I had just a few carne asada tacos to test them out. I went with a spicy sauce that they recommended and it was very spicy but had lots of flavor to it as well. I love this Hot sauce! (must have)

On my second visit, I had tacos again and tried the tortas too. They put in this mexican chesse or something with the combination of a ponzu like sauce... It just hits the spot. 
Oh... one thing to mention - they have these sweet potato ""fries"" that come with the tortas but beware - they are like needles and pokes your mouth if you are not careful. My friend really liked them but I was not that thrilled.  

All in all, I am so glad this place is open now and I hope they stay so I will always have a place to get my taco craving fix.",Ccq5GTRsr2xKvi8yARqzlA,5,1,4,LofSC2Fl2omQpWP42XlJSQ

My sis and I tried pretty much all their tacos minus the tofu:  Chicken, Beef, regular, Korean.  *YAwwnn*  We couldn't tell the difference between the related protein!  4 different type of lettuce, really?  If they're trying to make it the taco more dull then ""hollArrr!!!""  We eventually just set aside all the greens just so we can key on the meats for more oomph we we're expecting.  Sadly they did not amused us at all even with the 2 accompany sauces: red hot sauce, black sweet soy.  And to add to the insult they have a nice 2.1 speakers set up on their order window on party mode.  yay.

Their Bulgolgi CK Wings were likable, but i wouldn't order it again if i was in the neighborhood. 

Service was nice.  They made sure we kept warm with portable heaters on while we ate at their outdoor patio.  They even lend my sister a seat cushion so she didn't have to sit on the cold chair.

I'm unsure as to what part of this establishment makes it Korean.. but I am still working on that. I know it's meant to be fusion.. 

When I asked the guy behind the counter for an explanation of the flavors and sauces, he mentioned  no specific components and only used the words 'spicier' and 'sweeter' in reference to what the flavors were like. It was vague but I decided to give it a try anyway. 

I am pleased to say that everything was fresh, tasted great and was filling. Definitely someplace I would look to for a burrito now and then. I look forward to trying the other items. It was a limited menu, but given all the choices for food.. i think that this is a perfect thing. I am still confused as to what the seasonings were...as both burritos I tried were accompanied by a chili sauce and some sort of sweet soy sauce.. both good.. and both needed the sauces to liven up the burritos a bit.

It did take near 20 minutes for the 2 burritos to be made, which is due to the freshness of them I suppose.. but if I were on a lunch break, I might be a bit wary of going there. I was the only guy in line as well.. at the time.. there were 3 or 5 people sitting under the heater out front having food that all seemed to enjoy it as well. 

As I said, it was all very fresh and tasty on it's own which is why I am a fan and look forward to more.. but without any specific flavors that I can pinpoint, its just another good taco/burrito stand fused up for something different.. though not so different.

I read about this korean taco stand on yelp, and gave it a shot.  Let's just say the taste was nowhere near ""LA Style"" tacos.  

I ordered 2 tacos:

- Spicy Chicken - it seemed more sweet rather than spicy.  And the hot sauce they gave me, burnt my taste buds.  I mean I love spicy, but that was an overkill.

- Korean Beef BBQ - it was hella sweet! like nothing balanced anything out, it was just too sweet.  The tacos were topped of with way too much lettuce, it felt like I was eating a salad.  

The only good thing about my order was the sweet potato fries.  It was thin and crispy, made to my liking.  Maybe I just went on a wrong day, or maybe I didn't order the right style?  All I know is that everything was either way to sweet or spicy, there was nothing to balance it out.  Maybe I'd give this another shot and try their Torta or something.

I finally remembered it was there on Friday after my short work day, and it was so pretty outside so I went to the giant yellow bean shaped place.  The gentleman who took my order suggested a burrito for my first time, but I had just eaten chipotle the day before, so I opted for the Bibop salad.  I got spicy beef.  I had no idea the range of veggies that would land in my salad, but I was most excited about the eggplant!  That definitely was not listed on the menu but was a great addition.  There was enough food there for like 3 meals!

I point to the other side of the trailer (is that a trailer?) and he says to wait in my car and he'll bring it to me. Nice!

Long story short, that burrito was supremely good. Wow. Like I said, this is what I was expecting Korean fusion to taste like. I'm sorry to say (coz Ron is a nice guy) but it provided that little bit of extra flavor that I was missing from Hanshiktaco.

The menu is simple and reasonably priced with tacos, burritos, tortas, and salads. I ordered the spicy chicken tacos. They came heavily dressed in cabbage! Bravo! I love greenery. The flavors were definitely Korean, enhanced by two sauces on the side. One sauce reminded me of bibimbap dressing; the other a galbi marinade. Yum and yum. Plus, I am a huge fan of corn tortillas, and they double 'em up here Mexican street style. Last, but not least, the tacos are served with sweet potato straws. The needle-like nature of this side might not be the best, but even in slivers, the flavor is banging in a big way. I found myself greedily stuffing as many into my mouth as possible to capitalize on the flavor punch. Perhaps shoveling them onto the taco would be smart call, kind of like the old chips on a sandwich trick. 

They crank the music for atmosphere. The day we visited it was country! Talk about a culture collision: Korean tacos while listening to Tim McGraw.
