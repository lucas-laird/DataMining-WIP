With a group of 6 people, when we first got here it took about 15 min to even take our order, then another 15-20 to being the beers out, We ask to change the TV to the cardinals games, not even 15minutes later these three rich golf club looking white people come in and IMMEDIATELY get their orders taken, drinks came put so fast, we ordered pizza when we got here and somehow those people got their food first. The server, keeps going up to them asking how everything is while we are still waiting on a few of our drinks and pizza. Then just because they asked to watch the raiders game they changed our fucking game when every other fucking tv had their game. Bullshit. Then when we asked to change it back they had attitude. Not once did the server come up to us and ask how everything is. Everytime we come here it's the same thing. We have them one more chance and they suck. They do us more on the rich people. Terrible costumer service. The PTs on Fort Apache with the bartender Jennifer is the best one. Her service is ALWAYS on point. The server here is terrible, he walks around doing nothing, then comes out from the back always with food in mouth. Walking by like we haven't been waiting on our drinks n food. I work customer service. This place is the worst.

When i opened the door i wasn't sure i wanted to enter the Pub because of the strong smell of smoke (I have asthma...)
I entered anyway, i was starving!
the place was very open and well decorated, Modern and homey..
Feel like a chalet in Aspen 
I ordered some wings with sweet potatoes fries, and monkey ordered some boneless mild buffalo wing with curly fries 
my wings were crispy, delicious! service was fast 
they do not offer the option to select only flap or drums :) (we killed the wings lol nothing left)
I expected some homemade Ranch like at Hooters or Wingstop :(
they sell Pepsi sodas no Coke

seating area offers tables, bar or couches!! Love their lights fixtures very modern

Hubby and I went in grabbed? a seat, put a hundred each in the machine and waited for a bartender... She came in 5 minutes and I realize they were busy, so no big deal. We received really weak drinks and a food menu. She could only give us one menu -I guess they were short on menus. 40 min goes by, betting max, no refills and no one asked us what we wanted to order for food. We ran out of money at that point so we got up and the bartender says ""hey no refills?"" Really?!

I can understand if we were not playing max on the machines but we were. In fact there were only 6 gamblers of the less than 20 machines all being occupied. Of course we bailed no tip-never done that in my life....

We ordered the pizza, chicken nuggets, fries, and fish n chips. The pizza was a bit of a disappointment. The flavor wasn't all there for me and a little dry in taste. I usually go to Sierra gold and there pizza is always spot on and piping hot. The chicken nuggets and fish n chips were nothing spectacular, but it's bar food. They had servers walking around handing out samples of their beers every hour or so. They have happy hour that starts at 5pm, that include their pizzas,  selected appetizers and draft beers. They also have another late night happy hour as well. The bar and establishment is clean and the vibe is nice. I like how it doesn't smell like smoke yet.

3897006,2018-06-07,0,2zSr7jNNWpA-IfD74wOlTA,"I don't really post reviews unless its REALLY good or a REALLY bad location.

I'll start by saying that I have gone to this location a few times since they opened. I literally pass it twice a day every day. The location is nicely decorated; the food is good even though it's a bit overpriced, and people who work there are very friendly. 

HOWEVER, I have encountered a few issues. One time, I phone ordered food, picked it up and paid cash. I noticed I was short changed $5 or $10. I can't remember since it was in the beginning of the year. I didn't really care that much and simply didn't do anything about it at that point since I figured it was human error and I was in a rush.

To avoid this, I decided to start paying with my card. Well.....I just looked at my transactions when I logged into my account on my credit card and noticed that I was charged twice the last time I visited. The first charge, was processed for the amount totaled WITHOUT a tip and the second transaction was processed on my card WITH the tip. How annoying....Not sure if this occurs just at this location, or at all locations, but, I disputed the transaction without the tip since the second transaction with the tip went through. I have decided to stop going to PT's altogether. 

Also, their rewards point thing sucks since you must have your card with you so that you get your points. If you lose your card you have to open a new one, or at least that's how it was when I was a member a while back. It would be nice if you could just give them a phone number or email address so they can credit your rewards points, or you can track your visits/purchases through a phone app like most other places do. 

Hence, I haven't bothered with their rewards system for a while now since I have lost about 3 of their rewards cards. I have had to start a new rewards card and lost prior rewards points every time I lost one of their rewards card.

So, if you go to PT's, ensure you check your bill, get your correct change, and check online charges for duplicate charges. 

PT's is a big franchise in Las Vegas. There's at least one within a two mile radius to have to deal with these kinds of issues.",8umv64xVbmqa8_RbWVXJ3g,0,0,1,DMODMnS0Z2AhPumhegSRSA

For a PT's, the service isn't too shabby and the food is consistently decent. There are a few bartenders so you become familiar with the staff and they're all friendly. 

It opened last year so the bar's still fairly new - the inside is nice, clean, and has tavern like decor. It's never too smoky which is always a plus. There's also plenty of televisions which is nice for watching sports games!
 
I frequent this location for video poker and drinks mostly. It's right on the corner of Buffalo and Warm Springs so it's a convenient bar to meet for drinks in the Southwest part of town. 

Just don't get a dirty martini. I asked if they use any vermouth and they do not. Their olive juice tastes funny.",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,9,9,3,-m-mZHgYjAioBZjW5IqPVA

I ordered the chicken fries and a snakebite & we had a gilroy pizza for the table. The chicken fries were bomb! I'm not sure if they offer this appetizer at other locations or if it's new but definitely try it out. Tastes just like the one from Burger King! The gilroy pizza always hits the spot. I'm not sure what's all in there but it has sausages & it goes well with alcohol lol. The snakebite was good, can't really mess up beer you know. 

The service was alright, wasn't exceptional like how others made it seem. The establishment looks much bigger from the outside but it's pretty small when you come in.
