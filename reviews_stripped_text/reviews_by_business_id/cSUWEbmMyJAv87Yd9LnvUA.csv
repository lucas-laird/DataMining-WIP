Not a good look . I will not be going back. I heard from other students it wasnt great ,they also got sick , I had to try it myself.  I wish I took their advice.",lJ4NkD1LIfCCxcm2hU04vg,3,0,1,aK2WXfRqybFF2w6WADbXCQ

It's a new restaurant. Compared to most of the Filipino restaurants I've eaten at, this one is above the cleanliness meter. We even saw the owner organizing, constanly cleaning whatever mess he could find. 

Taste Quality: 4 stars
I wasn't really able to taste everything. They only offered meat selections. I'm a pescetarian so there wasn't a lot for me to eat. They completely had no seafood in their buffet selections. I did try one selection which was purely made with vegetables (mushrooms, zucchini, stringbeans, etc.). I don't think it's really an authentic Filipino dish but it tasted pretty good. 

Additionally, the chef and his co-owner were really nice; they offered to make me a tuna sandwich on a croissant bun. It tasted ok. Just needed a pinch of sugar. 

The other dishes they offered like kaldereta, fried chicken, etc. all looked good. I'm not sure about the taste. Unlike most Filipino a la carte style restaurants, the dishes in this restaurant weren't soaking in their own oil. I think that's a plus. 

However, though understandable, because they are a new resto, I think they need to expand their selections to at least include some sort of fish and a ""to order"" dessert like halo halo (which is a Filipino resto staple). 

Furthermore, they need to make sure to regulate the food temperature. The food I ate wasn't as warm. It should be kept warm or cold depending on the type of dish.

Customer Service: 5 stars
Customer service is exceptional. The owners were really nice. It was just the chef and his co-owner when we visited. They were attentive; asking us if there was something else we wanted etc. 

They even offered to make me a tuna sandwich because there wasn't anything else I could eat. The owner was even nice enough not to charge me buffet price because I didn't really eat anything else except one vegetable dish. 

Price: $
Pricing is also exceptional at $7.99 for buffet; which already includes drinks. For meat eaters, it's worth it. 

Recommend: Yes
Yes, I'd recommend people to try it. It's worth a try. For me, however, because of the distance from my home and the lack of pescetarian selections, it's just not a convenient place to go to. 

Additional comment:
They really need to trim that tree which was blocking their name logo. We had to go around and around at the center looking for their resto sign.",HdR-lOoagkl4pQC-xvBlyQ,3,1,4,jxjyuqIBBOeZo32yGNHHuQ

Judging by the quality of the  buffet they taste fresh, this are not like those typical filipino buffet. I really like the crispy chicken skin perfectly cook and melt in your mouth. The staff are very friendly, I will for sure come back for more.",7wClmFYs6QUNnm_NV4OK9A,0,0,4,kOa8R6CJJoCvPek5MOp0uw

923135,2014-07-28,0,cSUWEbmMyJAv87Yd9LnvUA,"My wife told me to check this place out about 2 weeks ago and was blown away by the cleanliness of the restaurant. It is by far, the cleanest Filipino restaurant I've ever been to and the restroom is clean too. Now to the food, overall, I like their food choices not too many like the other pinoy resto in town but just enough for me. When I was there, they had lechon kawali, tinolang manok, sisig, beef kaldereta, pork menudo, pakbet, spicy pork, pork and tofu, adobo, bistek, lumpia, etc. They don't put a lot of food in each chafing dish which is a good thing so the food just don't sit there for hours. They only had watermelon for dessert though which was disappointing but that's alright with me. They don't have a menu for catering and prices posted yet but they just opened the restaurant so I'll let that slide for my review. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to others. My son's birthday is coming up so I'll be ordering trays of food from this place. The price of the buffet is $7.99 with soda and tax included. I just hope this place stays in business because it's clean and the food taste great.",veuQbi8tdsD4h8jP1nu9PQ,0,1,5,FLoEN8NwIsCTlTUJWJgXUQ

1503499,2014-07-22,13,cSUWEbmMyJAv87Yd9LnvUA,"I'll openly admit that I haven't had much Filipino food, but the food I had here came with tons of bone fragments. Choking hazard, dental damage hazard, and simply not acceptable for restaurant food.

No signage, pricing, or menu available, just the dried-out and uncovered options at the buffet, labeled on the sneeze guard. I was handed a Styrofoam box to scoop my own rice from the cooker, and employee packed my two entr√©es of chicken adobo and curry chicken. Limited options, all looked dry, was disappointed not to have any soup or lumpia. 

$6 total was small for the heavy box of food I received, but you get what you pay for. Chicken in both dishes was of low quality with a lot of gristle, and bone fragments were everywhere. Sauces for both dishes were understated and borderline bland, neither had any spice to it at all.

The buffet style doesn't lend itself to high expectations in the first place, but Fiesta Filipino manages a much higher quality with fresher food... and no bone fragments.

EDIT: All you people posting 5-star reviews just because this place is ""so clean"", apparently you regularly give your business to dirty restaurants?!  Sorry, upholding the health department code isn't enough for me.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,5,2,0FP4Api2vvs2mCa6lbPiSQ

Yep, it's $7.99 with drink still included but now they added tax to the mix.  No biggie to me as long as food is good and hot.  Don't hesitate to ask for a pan change if food on line looks like it's been sitting, they will gladly whip up a refreshed batch.

Plus, now there's Netflix on rotation.
