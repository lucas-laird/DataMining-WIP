Generous portions of appetizers, including personal favorites such as vegetable tempura, chicken kabobs and beef carpaccio at non Strip prices and friendly service characterize this establishment. Prices for steaks are similar to most major chain steak houses and include buffalo meat cuts as well. 

As a gentile, the staff was very informative on describing the strict kosher rules that are in place when preparing the food items offered at this establishment, it was a nice educational side benefit during our visit.

Wine offerings include a impressive assortment of bottles from Israel, no hard liquor is served. 

Dining at the Village Steakhouse was a nice respite from the crowds and long waits that one often endures on The Strip.",ntlvfPzc8eglqvk92iDIAw,2,2,3,mKnI-sl_XmqnkvzjGWJRqg

The staff were fine the atmosphere nice the food was incredible. I may keep a dairy kitchen but I'm not a vegetarian and I don't often have chances to dine as I did that evening in Las Vegas. I wish the SF Bay Area had something like this. Its expensive but it was worth it and I felt compelled to give a generous tip. Roger was very helpful. I had the 20 oz rib-eye. I was concerned that it was going to be too big. It was HUGE but it was so good and so choice that the next day i found myself dwelling on the 26 oz. Next time, B""H. I wanted to try the buffalo but I figured the ribeye was a sure bet. I was correct and it was prepared to order and to perfection. My friend had the duck breast and she was quite pleased with it. The place is GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! None of the desserts that they offered called out to me though. Always room for improvement but I highly recommend the Village Steakhouse.   Supervised glatt kosher.  Go and enjoy you will not be disappointed.",MEdMurrCQwqh9pc28mCUbg,0,0,5,kb0JUY3Upbi6DB6gfqwNgg
