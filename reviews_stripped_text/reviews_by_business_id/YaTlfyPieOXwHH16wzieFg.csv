10782,2015-03-17,0,YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg,"So this is the second time in a couple weeks I've taken the time out of my body day to stop off and grab a bite to eat. Its also the second time in a row now that the line to get served has extended quite some distance. I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first time round...

I've now been stood in June for 18 minutes and still have several people before me. 

I love eating here, but the time it takes to get served is ridiculous. Sad to day it, but I just won't bother stopping by here any more for lunch. There's just not enough time in the day to justify it. 

My advice to everyone, don't bother between 12pm and 1:30pm",q3y5G3Kr0UKt2OxWEN-o9A,0,0,1,ERshBZa3cSANefxwyeaWDw

While in line, I ordered a fire grilled chicken burrito. The woman tried forcing the other chicken option when I protested she said it'd be 20 minutes for fire grilled chicken. How does that happen? Throwing up my arms- I decided to wait it out. To my left a woman ordered two tacos and was very specific about her order being separated. They botched that. Combining the tacos with one side of salad and rice. Since It turned into a huge line - I went to the checkout and use my full frequent customer card. Instead of checking me out I had to wait 10 minutes with two other livid customers. One of which had been waiting some time for napkins to be refilled and another fuming that he didn't get his desert for his son. What a mess. Needless to say, I paid and picked up my disaster of a burrito - over-packed with fire-grilled chicken and ripped in 3 places. Except they were convinced I hadn't paid yet. Had to present my receipt for that. 

With their kitschy slogan  ""every meal a masterpiece"" this was a charlatan's Jackson Pollock. Won't be back.",oa_TvUJy1DRQV9gIqVjxZg,1,0,1,Oy7UlQu71Xetidy745QqgA

86264,2014-08-18,0,YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg,I have been a loyal customer for years. I order a salad with extra steak and charged me $3.00 for extra steak sign states $1.50 not $3.00 steak was very much over cooked and not worth the $1.50 or $3.00 and extra cilantro. I always get an extra house dressing on the side ( one is never enough) lol. The last time I ordered my salad they where cooking fresh tortillas but when I ordered they tried to give me an old one that had be sitting around for some time. I didn't mind waiting. I asked for shredded lettuce for my salad and extra cilantro. Ordered 2 house dressings and A side of guacamole. The order was to go. I got home to find out guacamole was not on my salad like it's been for years. I was not happy at this point and called the number on the receipt. The air head on the phone said did you ask for it on the side I said yes. Then she explains to me that there have be a few changes to the sides and what comes with everything. When I walked in I seen new menu signs but not new side item that cost extra. This use to be my favorite place to eat but not anymore. The lady on the phone didn't even want to make me happy (like next time you come in we will fix it) she didn't want to be bothered with anything. You keep getting bad reviews everyone will need to find a new job. Very unhappy and I didn't deserve the attitude on the phone like she was to busy to talk to me and was rushing to get off the phone with me. Sorry but that's not good customer service I expect from a place like Café Rio. I won't be going back so you just lost a very loyal customer over young kids that don't care about customer service. It's very sad that I had to experience it. New rules should be clearly posted for everyone to see not just to the employee's to see. Very disappointed and will be telling my friends about it as well.

Mexican Grill that serves up fresh Mexican fare in the form of burritos, enchiladas, salads and quesadillas.  Had the Pork Barbacoa Burrito and it was excellent!  The pork is on the sweeter side, really fresh and slow cooked in a yummy savory sauce.  Love this rendition so much better than the spicy stuff they serve at Chipotle.  Actually, I would probably choose this place over Chipotle -- the food is just as fresh and has more flavor, and they don't just cake the toppings on.  The staff is awesome too!  They sing and dance and provide a convivial and friendly atmosphere for the patrons.  And did I mention the best part -- the playlist!  This place has a better playlist than most bars and restaurants I've been in -- some Weezer, Everclear, Blink 182, among others alternative favorties, and to top it off -- wait for it -- Journey's Don't Stop Believing!

The last two times that I have been to the Blue Diamond location I have had a horrible experience. 
The first time the cashier was extremely rude to me, she was unhappy that I was paying with my Café Rio points from my catering order. That is no reason to be rude to anyone. No thank you, no nothing. This is your job, if she is so unhappy she should just quit. 
The second time I stopped in I was close to this location so I decided to stop in during the lunch hour. It was a little busy but I was patient. I ordered a salad and I told the person no Pico, and I had to yell it over the glass and she was still was not listening to me because I had to say it numerous times. When she finally heard me it was too late and she he started to scoop off the Pico, then looked at me and in a very rude manner she asked ""do you want me to make you another?"" She was so rude but I said no, that's okay. She obviously did not want to. I checked out and I was so surprised that she was so rude, when it was her fault that she wasn't listening to what I wanted. She should have just made me another without asking. I headed back to the office to eat my salad, I picked the remaining tomatoes out and to my surprise I found a BUG on my lettuce. 
Well I wasn't going to eat the salad now that it had a bug in it. That was the last time that I will ever go to this location. This one is close to my house, and close to my job but I am willing to drive all the way to Eastern if I want Café Rio.",Z2d6O1Kabj0p8h3JMvJkAg,0,0,1,CsWTBwCsAvdggr6VTwY7YA

After today, I will not be going back. Reason being is, I had brought a friend of mine from back east to try it out. We finished eating and walked out to the car. I realized I had forgotten my cell phone on the table (roughly 2-3 minutes) so I went back in to get it. It wasn't on the table so I asked a few employees and eventually one of them had my phone in her apron. I was relieved and walked back out to my car. Once I got out to my car I noticed that my cell phone had been powered off. Hmmmm, interesting right? Why would someone power off a customer's cell phone within 2-3 minutes of it being left behind?? Because they had ill will intentions of stealing it! Common sense is if someone loses their phone and can't find it, one of the first things they do is CALL IT in hopes of someone with integrity will answer and give it back to it's rightful owner. So powering the phone off would make that nearly impossible. Of course, I went back inside and asked one of the employees what the girl's name was. The employee responded ""I don't know"". Really? You don't know who you work with? So, I then ask another employee, which happened to be the manager and she told me that her name was EMILY. Never did the manager ask what my concern was. I confronted Emily and asked her why she powered off my cell phone in such a short period of time of finding it and kept it in her apron instead of handing it over to her supervisor. She was speechless. I told her, you wouldn't have powered off my cell phone if you didn't have intentions of keeping it, right?  She then responded ""I have my own cell phone, I don't need yours. I turned it off so it wouldn't bother anyone if it rang"". Yeah, okay. The manager then came over and I explained to her what had happened and she seemed stunned and agreed that EMILY shouldn't have done that. What happened after that and if Emily was held accountable, I don't know. I had to leave for a meeting.  However, I did call the corporate office but, unfortunately, they are closed on Sunday.

I can not believe that there are 4 stars after our experience here. 

My friends and family wanted to go out to have a fun and cost effective meal for dinner and since this was one of our friends favorite places we decided to give it a shot. 

Wow, we were in for a surprise. We waited in a long line to finally get to the counter where we were rudely greeted with what do you want! Yep that's what she said we placed our order of 2 pork nachos and 1 pork salad and 1 grilled chicken salad. Then we were quickly rushed to the next rude lady that really pushed the customer service line to a new low she holds our salad and stares at us for about a minute and then says "" ok so what is that you want I don't have all day"" I couldn't believe it

Since this was our first time visiting this place I didn't really know it was like a subway where you pick your toppings! Sorry we are rookies!! 

I tell her we will take everything on it then she glares at us and pretty much just slops everything on there and looks up and says ok now what kind of dressing. We say um what are our options? 

What happens next I could not even explain in words that will justify her actions. She snarled at us dropped our plate on the counter and grabbed the next one in line to ours which so happened to be our nachos!! She looks at the other customer in line and asks them "" what do you want on the nachos"" 

Her face was priceless when the dude told her that those are not his!! She looks back at us and realizing that the next four plates are ours!! Decides to then be somewhat helpful. 

We finally make it to the register and even the person ringing us up says sorry about that is there anything else I can help you with!! 

Overall it was a terrible experience and over priced food. I don't know how there pork won awards as in my opinion it wasn't all that great and the customer service made this place terrible. 

The nachos were ok, I have had better at taco bell! There signature salad plate is a great idea and wasn't terrible but poorly executed. I would never recommend this place and I can find a better place to spend $45 bucks for dinner.",IzBQ-tzwG2GIPcb-Uo5gVg,5,0,1,ZYU8gyUOWEy-TOVb5pBHNw

As a general manager of another food establishment I understand the regular issues that can happen;
- someone taking an order incorrectly 
- someone making the order incorrectly 
- someone not performing a final quality check before the order is given to the guest 
These are all things that happen, and I would be the type of person to be understanding due to my job. 
My experience today was beyond unsatisfactory. 
First I called in my order around 12 with a 45 min quote for pick up. That's ok, it's lunch. I am stuck at my job all day anyways 630 am to 7 pm so waiting for a good lunch is worth it. I order the same thing everytime. When Alexis answered the phone she seemed side tracked and not interested; she didn't even repeat the order to me. My order was rang up correctly on my receipt though (I later saw) so it had to be someone on the line. I had my driver pick up the order for me; I buy them lunch every Monday. The total cost of it was $36 and some change, so it should be worth it. When I got my order it was completely wrong. The sauce was wrong. The burrito was wrong. The toppings were wrong. But the receipt was right. 

I call the location back and tell Alexis (who answers the phone again) that I wanted a refund on my burrito (just the part wrong) and she told me to hold and I went to a silent phone. Then mike got on the phone. I ask if he's the manager and he ignored me. He was so rude and short with me plus didn't even know the situation. I re-explained everything to him and he told me a refund couldn't be done without the card present. I ask him again is he the manager and he says no she is on the line. Now, I work at a food place remember? And I know when a guest calls, especially about a refund, you step away and handle the situation. I tell him I will hold till she is done and he says she has a meeting at 230 so she'll call me back before she goes. He takes my name and phone number down, and tells me she will call me back before her meeting. It's now been two hours and no call. 
This is the WORST customer service I have ever experience and if ANY of my employees treated someone this way or my shift leader did not address the situation immediately I would immediately reevaluate their role in my location!!!",N21bHo3lwDRk250SzvaNRw,3,0,1,rcxJEimygFER-wHERH_N2A

The next day rolls around and still nothing from him.  I called his cellphone and it kept going to a mailbox that hadn't been set up yet so I call the store.  You would think he would have seen the missed calls and called me back.  I called this store and they said he'll be back in a few days.  I call again in a few days and apparently just missed him.  Nine days had passed and I still could't get in contact with him.  I had waited on hold for 25 mins today only to be told to call back in 30 mins because they were busy.  I waited and called back.  The employee was rude and put the phone down to get Umberto.  I heard someone in the background say he had left.  Instead of the employee telling me this, she just hung up on me.  Now this becomes more about principle than two free meals.  I ended up calling their corporate office and spoke to Elaine.  She was very apologetic and instantly credited my account for the meals.  She also advised the Regional Manager.  For an Area Coach to not keep his word is not acceptable and reflects poorly on the company he represents.

It's so flavorful and perfectly prepared I rarely can convince myself to get anything else. When I'm a starving beast, I go for the burrito. When I feel like behaving myself, I grab some enchiladas, but honestly with their fresh ingredients and wide array of choices, I don't think a poor choice is possible. The man in my life loves the fire grilled steak tacos. 

Perhaps your first time around the ordering process may seem a bit stressful, there's a lot of cooks in the kitchen for sure. But once you get your favorites nailed down you'll be a pro! Pick certain items and you may even get a song (the nachos are most entertaining). They do have pick up with a dedicated register so if you can't handle the stress just call it in! There's usually a pretty decent wait at this location so this is a wise choice around dinner. 

Lots of drinks to choose from too, including my favorite the Mint Limeade. Refreshing and delish! The 5th star was a necessity as they also offer your choice of favorite hot sauce! Any place that provides more condiments than you know what to do with earns major bonus points in my book. Tapatio, cholula, YUM!

1007250,2017-06-26,0,YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg,"I recently visited the location on 4830 Blue Diamond Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89139 on Saturday June 24th.  This was my 2nd time dining at a Café Rio, the 1st time being a week ago at the location on Durango Rd.  I was highly impressed with the quality of the food and the service from my 1st experience, so I decided to stop by again at a location closer to my home.  Unfortunately, the 2nd time around was not a pleasurable experience.  I received lackluster service and encountered severely unprofessional staff members.
I arrived around 10pm and the store wasn't busy at all.  A few patrons in the dining room, and no one in line, so I walked straight to the front.  There were 2 employees present with their backs turned to the line, one of which was playing on her cell phone in clear view on the food service line (she ended up being the cashier).  After waiting for a bit, I was finally acknowledge by a female staff member who said ""we'll be right with you in a second,"" and she calls to the frontline chef who was in a back area.  After the frontline chef comes up, he asks me ""what do you want?"" to which I asked ""Do the nachos come with a protein?""  I was extremely appalled when he answered ""What?!"".  Not an excuse me, pardon me, or could you please repeat that?  But straight up ""What?!""  So after repeating my question, I continued on with my order.  
About halfway through ordering my 2nd item, another staff member comes up and asks the frontline chef about garbage bags, so the chef stops talking to me and starts talking to his coworker instead.  After finally completing my order, the frontline chef turns his back and starts angrily talking to himself, complaining about the one who asked him about the garbage bags.  I clearly hear him say ""n*gga"" multiple times, and the female staff member discretely tells him ""stop saying the n-word!  They might hear you!"" to which the chef didn't seem to care nor stop his rant.
At that point, my food was almost ready, and the female staff member could tell I was a little perturbed, so she was then extra nice and attentive to me, and decided to start using ""sir"" while adding the finishing touches to my order.  I then paid and promptly left the store.
I wasn't expecting a fine dining level of service, but at the very least acknowledge me, don't treat me like I'm stupid, be polite/respectful and lastly be professional.  I didn't experience any of the above at that location.  I work in customer service myself and have worked food service as well, so I get it.  Now, I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble or reprimanded, but I really wanted to bring this to your attention.  I'm a simple person, and very easy going, but the way I was treated and the way the staff acted was despicable.",5jPq6eQpxIhOYgw46kKU5w,2,0,1,gePYZspLvuU7h98DMcOJSw

First off the other reviews on how terrible the customer service is at this locaton are completely right. They rush you through the line so fast that you don't get enough time to tell them what you want and what you don't want on your plate, then when you get something thrown on that you didn't want, they get so mad if you have the nerve to tell them you didn't want that.

  I don't understand why the wait takes so long to  order because by the time you get helped you feel almost dizzy from the whirlwind of fast questions thrown at you. Its so bad that when I go there with more than two meals to order I litterally have to  rehearse my order so they don't get frustrated with me for taking up too much time. I hate it! 

We have tried to order over the phone and thats a nightmare too! They always get something wrong on it and I'm not sure if there is a designated cashier for to go orders because I have sat there for at least ten minutes before someone even acknowledges that I am there. 

Now that chicken salad.... we always get the grilled chicken salad with house dressing and its really yummy! A bit pricey but its a good size. I recommend getting a side order of the hot sauce which will run you another dollar but its great when I  pour a little on the salad too. The tortilla soup is also good. Another item that we get if you are not terribly hungry is a side salad, we order that with a side of grilled chicken and its also really good. The homemade tortillas are good enough to eat all by themselves. We really enjoy the food here I just wish the customer service was better because this is our closest location but we have no problem driving a little further for better service.",Z6QMLvzwiFKhFe_AYO0Csg,0,0,3,sIteco4pk49wPO4FM2vETw

That is what kept me coming back for quite some time. However, the negatives far outweigh the good at this point. First, the line is always horrendous. I'm not sure why this hasn't been addressed by management or corporate. Something is clearly wrong with the organization and the method in which they are preparing the food if the line is constantly backed-up. Second, the attitude of the workers is, generally speaking, horrible. They roll their eyes, reach over/breathe on the food, and they don't want to listen to the customer if he or she wants specific items on his/her salad. I'm not sure what the point of the employee building the salad is if they aren't very welcoming to the fact that I only want specific items on it. They act as though it's a huge hardship to put anything other than the generic ""everything"" on my salad. I hope people continue to gripe about the line and the service, because I think Cafe Rio is very profitable and this allows Corporate or Management to turn a blind eye (or they are just unaware).

1282235,2014-11-20,0,YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg,"I just never get tired of this place. 

Cafe Rio takes Chipotle's concept and puts it on steroids. Juicier meat, tastier sauces and dressings, and faster and friendlier staff. 

I most often order the salad which includes your choice of meat (shredded or grilled chicken, grilled steak, or barbacoa), your choice of beans (black or pinto), rice, lettuce, pico, guacamole, lime wedge, cilantro, cheese and tostada chips. You also get your choice of dressings, the creamy cilantro is to die for!  My favorite part of this is the chicken. I always get the shredded chicken and it is deliciously moist and packed with flavor. 

My husband orders the shredded chicken nachos, and he loves that they sing a silly song when he does. It makes me laugh every time. 

They give our daughter (11months old) a free quesadilla. This probably doesn't seem like much but as a parent who's been charged over and over for food that is inevitably going to end up on the floor, I totally appreciate it! 

The tortillas here are handmade (you can watch them do it) on site and they are so good! Sometimes I come in and just take one to go as a snack (though I would not recommend during lunch or dinner rush). 

It's the little things that take a place with good food and make it a great restaurant. This place has got it all and that is why I keep going back.",jOX6aVwI9sA-sQFWBZSsFw,0,0,5,rId2wLULM0l6roTCadXT8Q

Colleague 1:  I'd like a beef burrito
Loud guy behind counter:  We don't have beef!  We have steak!
Colleague 1:  Okay..steak.  Corn tortilla please
Loud guy behind counter:  Steak burrito!  Beans?
Colleague 1:  Yes, black beans.  Corn tortilla please
Loud guy:  Hot or mild?
Colleague 1:  I'll have that one (points), the fresh salsa
Loud guy:  That's pico de gallo!
Collague 1:  Okay..that
(by the way...he ended up with a flour tortilla anyway)

Loud guy:  NEXT!  (extra loud as if I'm not standing 29 inches in front of him)
Me:  Can I have salmon in a burrito?
Loud guy:  YES!  We have salmon!
Me:  Okay...salmon burrito please
Loud guy:  salmon-ay por favor!  (I'm pretty sure Spanish for salmon is salmón...no ""ay"")
Loud guy:  BEANS?!!!!!
Me:  yes, white please
Loud guy:  WE DON'T HAVE WHITE BEANS, WE HAVE
Me, interrupting loud guy:  PINTO BEANS! (and I pronounced it PEEN-toe in my best Spanish accent)
Loud guy:  Hot or mild (now not as loud)
Me:  Salsa roja and pico de gallo
Loud guy:  wet style right?  (then just pours enchilada sauce on before I answer)
Me:  Sure (as if I have a choice at this point)

By then, I think he was annoyed with me and just sent my burrito down to the next gal to add lettuce, sour cream and rice.

Look...I get it that some of us come from culturally diverse backgrounds and enjoy bringing the heritage to the workplace where it's appropriate.  But c'mon dude... Caucasians in the Southwest typically understand the ingredient list at Latin cuisine establishments.

Place my order with the first person in line and then order is taken over by another server who is not listening to the first person.  So I have to order everything over again, one fish taco meal, two chile beef tacos, chips and salsa-queso.  Pretty straightforward and simple, but they don't listen to you.
I was asked twice if I wanted cheese on the tacos, I said yes but somehow it never made it to the tacos.  When I noticed that the server was placing everything in one container, I reminded her that the fish taco was a meal..  She told me don't worry about it, my jaw is still wide open after hearing her talk to me like that!  Now I get to the cashier and she asks me for the whole order once again.  I still don't have my sides of rice and beans or the chips or salsa.  The cashier has to ask Don't worry about it for the rice and beans and chips and salsa, amazing.  So now I get the side dishes in a to go container, and she has to ask me if I want another container.  I say yes, because miss don't worry about it did not put it together as a meal.  After I pay for this mess, we go to our table.  The cashier tells me she forgot to ring up my chips and salsa-queso, but I show her the receipt with chips and salsa only rang up.  She tells me don't worry about it, and this time I dont!

We placed the order over 1.5 hours prior to scheduled pick up.  There is no warning, nor notice online stating times may vary so we showed up about 10 minutes late and told the order still isn't ready.  Our employee that picked it up, on the payroll clock, had to wait another 45 minutes for it to be ready.  Luckily the did provide a 25% discount on our order.  By the time it got to the our office, 1 meal was missing and 2 were made incorrectly, so we had to send someone back (10 minute drive each way)...slightly ridiculous...but we get mistakes happen.

Our office ws upset by the situation above, but still love Café Rio and food so much we tried again.  My coworker ordered a single Chicken Salad yesterday online and showed up and it was ready on time.  She brought it back, it was completely wrong and no meat in her salad.  At this point, lunch is about over so we can't come back to pick it up.

TODAY .. I order 2 salads online for pick up at 1pm.  I show up at 1:15 and am told it's still another 15-20 minute wait.  I told them to cancel it and left.

After I left I called to speak with a manager (Friday 9/25/15 around 1:30pm) and was told there isn't a manager on duty to speak to me on the phone and then told she isn't accepting calls right now.  I get that it's a lunch rush, however, I'm an angry and upset customer and the manager should be available.

At this point, 3 times in a row, the meal wasn't ready within a 15 minute time frame with no warning and our orders continually get messed up.  The staff members making the take-out orders need to be more thorough and just pay attention to the orders.  It's not a difficult job and to follow directions.  One time I understand, but when it continually happens it becomes unacceptable.

I will no longer bring our business to the Blue Diamond location and notice I'm not the first one with terrible reviews on Yelp either.  I think this staff and management needs to have another few training sessions.",c-Rr73ZGs04feEw_ff3c7g,2,0,1,3x1k6vcXBkHOaufwlf4nVg

So I asked for what I wanted and he didn't take time to ask if I wanted anything else before he asked the girl behind me what she wanted, so I had to rudely interrupt and say I actually have two more meals I would like to get, he then rolls his eyes and rushes through my order. Fast forward to the payment, I was charged for an extra pork salad so she then they only Gave me one of the two pork salads.. then I went to fill up my drink and one of the workers was cleaning the floor under the drink station so I waited holding my cup for

Decided to go with the 'award winning' Pork Barbacoa burrito, which while delicious, quickly fell apart in my hands leaving their sauce everywhere and causing me to have to get a knife/fork to finish it. The restaurant has a very similar ordering/seating arrangement to Chipotle/Qdoba. I was very pleased with the serving size compared to a similar meal at Chipotle, and with it being rather close to home, I'll be sure to stop by and try some other dishes (hopefully ones that don't fall apart after 2 bites).",O7AjVhZWhZx82jHybQDjwQ,1,0,3,OyuBV1_8jEUa2EJwn3Ph1A

1823495,2014-05-31,0,YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg,"I'm no expert when it comes to Mexican food, but I do eat out often and work in the hospitality industry. I enjoy eating here but the service has been very slow. Personally I think it's because of their ""Subway"" style of assembly line. There's no reason to have to speak to three different people for a to-go order. 

The prices are high for fast food ""Mexican"". I don't think they want to be known as fast food, especially since it's somewhat slow and made to order, but there is an uneasy feeling when the warm meat portion of your entree is sitting on the vegetable line for a few minutes before the next employee is ready to ask you what you're having even though you already ordered. Seems monotonous. 

Once my ""fire grilled steak"" sat for a couple of minutes, the next assembly line employee asked what I was having (even though I already ordered).  I realized the quickest option was to tell her, ""however it comes"". Still didn't matter as they were behind on orders. 

I came to a third employee who asked what my order was. Apparently they work on the honor system. This gentleman seemed to be the only employee with a sense of urgency. He attempted to get caught up on multiple orders that were well behind the ticket time. No one else seemed to care or understand. I hope he gets promoted to management. They need it there. 

3 stars for the average food. Would love to have it made to order as advertised.

I've been to other cafe rio locations before, and had to wait maybe 15-20mins which for me although not ideal is something I can deal with without crying like a spoiled baby. The thing I can't deal with is not the longer wait time which at this location was closer to 30mins (I've gotten on rides at Disneyland quicker) but the careless attitude of the staff in the preparation of the food, the clear as day feckless attitude towards customers which includes talking to other staff members about inappropriate behavior they had participated in the previous night, and an apparent lack of any leadership. 

Might I add that I am in no way prudish, I myself enjoy inappropriate behavior but while I'm at work I keep it to myself or I wait till patrons who could take offense are far from earshot.

Granted, the dining area is large and the queue is fast, and the prices are fair, but everything had a heavy, processed taste.

By ""everything"" I mean the beans/cheese/rice burrito and a pair of cheese enchiladas. The burrito (2/3 left unfinished) was a mass of funky beans with very little else going on. (The advertised peppers and onions and whatnot were just a floppy sprinkle on the side. The cheese and rice was almost non-existent. And it sure didn't taste like the advertised cotija.)

No name tags so who knows there names. Everyone else seemed to move at a snails pace and not give a crap.
First there were two phoned in/emailed orders that were large and being placed ahead of ours. So we literally stood at the window watching our food just sit there for close to 10 minutes. They need to get a quicker system or give customers that are actually there priority.  Don't let the food just sit.
Second, I was able to see a lot going on while I had to just stand waiting. An order of nachos had sour cream on it and they didn't want anything on it apparently,  and you would think it was a good thing they caught a mistake before it went out. However the person that seemed to be in charge, pony tail and glasses, told the larger gal with curly hair to just scrape it off. So she did just that, and then covered up what she couldn't get off with more cheese, the proceeded to run back thru to melt. Hope there aren't any severe allergies that can cause someone to be really ill...all because your lazy and didn't do it right the first time.
Then, while we are still waiting in the same spot at the end of the line just staring at our food sitting, a burrito fell off of the oven conveyor because another one came thru. But here's the thing, the second item didn't come thru and push it right off, it happened over a matter of minutes. And then when it fell, the sour cream gal announced it in a very ""oh well"" tone and NO ONE cared. It just sat on the floor. And sat. And sat...
After the other orders were finally done, the cashier acknowledged us though we'd been standing there for somentime staring at her and everyone else at the end of the production line. And when she did get around to acknowledging us she said ""give me a minute"". Wow. You know how long we've been standing here, and all we've just seen and you speak to me like I'm bugging you. I also asked her for a side of beans and I thought her head was going to quiet literally explode from the audacity of my request. She was so put out by it. 
Look, I didn't say anything because I was exhausted and only there because I didn't have the energy to cook for the family. And I knew that if I said something these people would have defended their crappy behavior because the one in charge was the same way. They just absolutely do NOT give a crap. About anything.

I love watching them roll out the torillas. Seeing all the fresh food, I know it is and it's good for me considering it's a fast food joint.

Clearly someone forgot that they were cooking chicken today because my chicken salad has several pieces of chicken that have 3rd degree burns. The char is serious on this poor bird. Extra sauce isn't helping, scraping off the char isn't working and it seems like my salad is going to have to go without its chicken friend today. 

This is the first bad salad I've had from CF and I pray this doesn't happen again. Rest In Peace chicken, for tho weren't edible and died in vein! Lol",V7cGEFexpXTY-jKWhqkHcw,2,1,3,aThmejphA7LgkyuFIcNdtA

The Eastern location has never disappointed me; however, in the past two online orders I've done for this Blue Diamond location, there's always something either missing or incorrect. Normally, I would disregard if something was missing if it wasn't anything major, but today, I ordered a chicken tostada, extra lettuce, black beans and no rice, lime on the side. My container had five bites of lettuce, a handful of cilantro, no lime to be seen, and beans in EVERY SINGLE BITE. Why would I pay for an extra 2oz of delicious tomatillo dressing when there's no lettuce!? The normal 2oz of dressing that it comes with was TOO MUCH for what I had today. 

I feel like I am eating sour cream and cilantro with chicken and beans that happens to have bits of lettuce. HORRIBLE. UNFORTUNATE for such a known name to have such terrible results when it comes to constructing food that is in a food line that only requires someone to read down the list of what to put onto a container.

You walk right in and there is colorful wallpaper everywhere, and after you wind through people eating you find the line queue. 

It was semi-busy, it took about 5 minutes to get someone to take my order which I thought was fairly fast considering how many people were online. Very fast assembly line system. I ordered the salad, pinto beans, with shredded chicken, I was through in about 2 minutes and paying for my meal.

My only negative is that while i was waiting for my meal to be made I asked the server a question and she looked like me like I had a thousand heads, she turned to her colleagues and they had the same reaction, finally someone came by and answered my question. I then realized they didn't speak english. All I asked was which was the spiciest sauce they had and no one can tell until someone save the day.

Great so I got my food and was told the Cholula and Tapatio were by the drink fountain. Awesome!!! What a wide array of hot sauce all at your disposal!! I filled my cup of water and grabbed me a bottle of Tapatio. I doused my salad with the hot sauce like putting out a fire with water hoping for the opposite effect. And I got exactly what I had hoped for. 

Once you dig through the top of the salad you hit pay dirt, the shredded chicken and it tasted fresh and very savory, had a good flavor. The whole salad sits on a large soft tortilla which you find yourself picking apart at the end, at least I did.

Tonight, my sister and I went to this location to pick up dinner.  I ordered two of the chicken tacos and she just wanted two orders of the flour tortillas to make her own items when we got home.  The guy behind the counter, wrapped up two rolls of two tortillas each and then urged us further down the line to finish our order.

We got to the end, behind one other patron, and the cashier grabbed one of our tortilla wraps and placed it on their tray.  My sister spoke up behind her that she had just given some of our order to the people ahead of us and the cashier snapped that there were others tortillas already rolled up at the previous station.  My sister and I looked through the window/sneeze-guard and noticed two other orders of tortillas that had been there for a while.  Uh, no.  I did not just order fresh food that I intend to pay for, to get somebody else's food that was left for who knows how long.

So, my sister reiterated that the wrap on the tray was ours and the cashier snatched them up and snapped loudly...""oh my god, they're all tortillas.""  Again, I ask...what the heck has happened to customer service?!

I snapped at the cashier to calm down and the manager asked if something had just occured to which the cashier told her that nothing had happend.  So, when we got to the front of the line and the same cashier asked if we needed anything else, I asked to speak with the manager.  With an eyeroll, the cashier pointed to the woman next to her.

I told the manager that I didn't appreciate what her cashier had snapped and the cashier chose that moment to interrupt with...""I wasn't even talking to you!""

Second woman in line asked me what I would like, I repeated my order, she placed my ingredients in the shell then placed burrito in the oven. Third lady asked what I orded, I repeated and said it's in the oven, she took it from the oven and pushed it down the line to a fourth lady.

When we went to eat our meals the burritos were predictably soggy, vaguely unpleasant tasting -- revolting beans -- and generally yucky.

I eat or at least used to eat at Cafe Rio about 1-3 times per week. 
I can agree with some of the other reviews regarding customer service, but I always ignored it because they generally make my food correctly. Plus the food is good and portions are huge. 
Well, I recently took a break from dairy, which makes me very sad, but it is what it is. 
Considering I usually order the grilled chicken tostada with creamy Ranch type dressing I was pretty nervous that it wouldn't taste the same without dairy. My friend recommended I get avocado instead of sour cream. Great idea, right? 
So I order my salad, no rice, no cheese, no sour cream, no dressing. Oh wait can I sub avocado for the sour cream? 
Counter guy: doesn't answer, just puts it in my bowl. Ok. Great. 
I get to the checkout and the cashier tells me it will be $. 95 to add guacamole. So I ask her, even though I didn't get cheese, sour cream or dressing? She doesn't reply and just adds the extra to my total. 

Normally, I may have said something, but I'm so tired of having to argue or complain to receive appropriate customer service. 
I think I'll give my normal Cafe Rio another try (on Eastern) but if I get the same treatment I may just be over this place. Obviously they don't care about my business. 
It's frustrating because the amount of guacamole that you receive is paltry. I mean for a dollar I should at least get a full scoop.

3652400,2015-08-17,1,YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg,"I finally gave this place a try, and while I haven't quite made up my mind about it, I will say this: the food is good.

I didn't love my experience here, to be honest. The food is terribly overpriced, about 9 dollars and change if you set your burrito up with everything chipotle offers at around $8.  That wouldn't be so bad, but the lady making my burrito rolled it up long before I was done telling her what I wanted on it. I guess they put their pico de gallo, lettuce and other veggies on the side, which is ok but I would have liked the choice to have it in my burrito.  With only meat, beans, cheese, salsa, and a little rice inside, the burrito was near impossible to pick up without collapsing and spilling out large amounts of messy filling. I'd recommend ordering your burrito enchilada style with sauce and cheese on top since you will be eating it with a fork and knife no matter what.

I hope I don't sound like a grump, I did enjoy much of my meal.  The tortillas are fantastic. They are handmade, hot, fluffy, surprisingly flavorful. I'd get another sloppy burrito just to experience that tortilla again.

I ordered the Barbacoa since I had heard such great things about it, but I did not enjoy it. It was very sweet, which is fine in most BBQ, but this didn't seem to have any outstanding flavor besides overwhelming sweetness. Im more of a spicy kinda guy so I think this was probably just a bad choice for me, though I think there could have been more smokiness to the meat. Next time I will try it with steak or grilled chicken.

What I really need to tell you about is their chips, salsa, and queso dip. You must order these items. I know cafe rio is expensive, but it is absolutely necessary that you add this to your order. The chips are decent enough, but the salsa is great.. Probably the best I've had in Vegas so far. I didn't care for the salsa they put on my burrito but this one was delicious. The queso was awesome. Not the best I've ever had but definitely better than anything else I've had in town, and certainly a must have from cafe rio.

There is a pretty terrific collection of bottled hot sauces to add to your food if you're like me and enjoy a little food with your hot sauce.


I thought the staff was friendly enough, the dining room was clean and orderly.  Despite my many gripes with this place, there is a lot to like and I think it's definitely worth returning to.",zFvW-hvtKJ7AAj_kZNXsBw,1,0,3,nNTkbo0fWl-DSK70MEKmOg

Came here on a Sunday night at 8pm. Proceed to wait inline and order food. There was only 1 person in front of us yet it took forever to get our food! The burrito maker kid messed up the burrito for the person in front of us 2 times so he had to remake it over and over. Then when it came to my turn i ordered a grilled chicken burrito basic toppings. He places it in the conveyor heater and proceeds to finish the 1st customers order. My burrito goes through the conveyor and comes out and just sits there...what was the point of heating it up if it get cold sitting there?? Finally the customer in front finishes. I get my burrito and order a side of chips+salsa. Again i wait for the guy to go in the back to get more chips. 

So i finally sit down to eat my burrito. Its not good at all. Its not even hot. The chicken tastes like the Tyson brand frozen stuff you get at the supermarket. The rice had no flavor, it was basically a tasteless burrito. The only thing that was good was the salsa for the chips. I really didnt see the hype for this place.

I tried ordering 10 chicken tacos but they didn't have enough chicken for 10 so I settled for what they had + some steak tacos. It was late so I understand and appreciate that they don't just have an abundance of ingredients out, ready for the next day the night before.

They have a ton of hot sauces to choose from which is just amazing because who doesn't like to have options?

-Burritos:  Kept it simple again.  Just the chicken and rice.  I'm not really into the messy wet burritio so I had them just add a small amount.  

Portions are huge and the meals are delicious.  Service is a quick cafeteria/assembly line type ordering. I like it.  At least you can see exactly how your food is being prepared.

The lines here are outrageous and I agree with the other recent reviews. PLEASE, corporate, PAY ATTENTION AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS LOCATION!

It wasn't always like this. Cafe Rio was a quick and easy place to grab a business lunch or to get takeout on the way home from a long day at work. No longer. After my most recent visit 2 nights ago (and a nearly 45 minute wait in line at 8 pm!!), I will now not only actively avoid dining here, but I will be sure to spread the word to everyone I know. 

People are not exaggerating about the wait times. The problem is, you never know just how long the queue will take when you line up. The employees are so slow and nobody tries to expedite the line. Cafe Rio is supposed to be a ""quick service"" restaurant but now it's anything but. 

There's no excuse. Zero. Zip. None. 

All I can figure is that Cafe Rio corporate and this location's manager just don't give a crap about losing customers. 

We used to go at least twice a week. Then that whittled down to once a week, then a couple of times a month then about once a month. Now it's gone to none.

I then saw them cleaning the vents by standing with their sneakers on the chicken grill. I promised myself I would never return and a year later I broke that promise. Never again will I return. . I visited on Sunday August 21st at 530pm. I felt so bad for the staff. 

I preordered my meal. When I arrived the cashier was on the phone calling her manager. I felt so bad for her as she was trying so hard. She should get a bonus. The conversation pretty much said the manager left, we have one person working the line, the dishwasher won't work the grill, and we are out of chicken, rice, steak, and salmon. She begged the manager to come to work to help and s/he was not being receptive about helping. 

She then returned and told the line for pick up orders to join the main line as they only have one person working the prepline and it would be quicker. 

I went in the prepline and ordered my meal. The lady was very nice and was trying to work fast. I give her loads of credit. Sadly I got the wrong order and burnt chicken when I opened my meal at home. Also I tried to use the app which had a B1G1 but told they can't honor it. 

To the management team- you should support your staff and have a manager during prime operating hours. I heard the employee say that the manager had another job to go too. I feel bad for that manager but schedule someone else. You should not run out of food and have one employee working the line. They were obviously stressed.

Sometimes the rice is undercooked and weirdly hard. Sometimes the meat seems overcooked and difficult to chew. Sometimes the person puts a boat load of cheese and other times it's barely enough.

Other than that, not much to note. Overall pretty big storefront with lots of seating space. I've been here during prime lunch and dinner times and it can get pretty busy but the staff is usually friendly and they move the line quickly so the wait is never long.

4702286,2013-02-08,3,YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg,"This was the first time I had a bad experience at this location, but it was so frustrating! 

I informed Associate #1 that I was ordering a salad. Before I could say anything else, he proceeded to throw a tortilla on the flattop with cheese. When he walked back, I had to inform him that I didn't want cheese. He just looks at me, then turns around, throws a container on the tortilla, and turns back around. Trying to be helpful, I asked my fiancé what he was ordering and it was also a salad, so I told Associate #1 that he would take that tortilla. No response. Oookay. So I quickly tell him, ""I'm having a vegetarian salad"" before he could assume anything else. Also, since it was Thursday, there was a tamale meal special that I hadn't tried. I wanted to give them a whirl, so I asked Associate #1 if I could order one as a side item, since I didn't want the meal. He seemed confused and I asked a couple different ways, but he eventually answers, ""Yes."" 

Then, it's on to Associate #2. She seems nice enough, until I ask her a question, then she appears obviously annoyed. I say yes to all the vegetables, but no cheese. She asks me what type of dressing I want and as I'm attempting to formulate a sentence to indicate the dressing that is Vegan-friendly (I couldn't remember the name of either of them and she didn't tell me what they were, but just kept asking me which one I wanted), she starts scooping the creamy one into a cup. I'm like, ""Um, ah, uh, I meant the other one...the Vegan one???"" While trying to point through the glass. ""It's vinaigrette."" Right. Then she just tosses it haphazardly to Associate #3, but it lands in the tortilla strips compartment. Nice. 

While she's finishing up, I began to wonder where was my tamale? 
Me: Um, I ordered a tamale in the side....
Associate #2: Did you tell him? (pointing at Associate #1)
Me: Yes.
Associate #2 to Associate #1: Did you get the tamale ready for her?
Associate #1 has the look of ""Oh crap, I forgot"" on his face and gets it together. Associate #3 was great and asked if I wanted sides with the tamale (rice, beans, pico, and lettuce). Sure, why not. I also asked for no cheese.

Now, we are at the cashier.
Cashier: Sure you don't want two tamales? It's the same price for one.
Me: Uhh, what??? I asked the guy if I could order a tamale on the side and he said I could.
Cashier: Oh. Weird. So you want the other one?
Me: Um, okay...well, yeah. If I'm paying for it, I might as well.

We sit down and I'm pretty annoyed. I've barely started eating when the cashier walks over to bring us the tamale.
Cashier: (as she is handing us the tray) Oh, did you want cheese on that?
Me: (staring at the obvious, melted cheese on the tamale): Uhhhh...
Cashier: If you don't want it, that's fine. We can make another one.
Seriously, why would you bring it over with cheese on it and THEN ask me? Or better, why didn't anyone bother to ask Associate #1 or Associate #2 about how I had ordered the first tamale just a couple minutes prior?

So $25 and one (disgusting) tamale later, I didn't finish my food and Ieft feeling disappointed and dissatisfied (really, two tamales and two salads for $25 with bad service, no thank you). Additionally, for a salad I typically love, I had absolutely no desire to eat it tonight nor will I want to again in the future. For an establishment that has the appearance of promoting Vegetarian and Vegan options, it seems to be a bother to every associate to request NO cheese melted on the tortilla and NO cojita cheese (and cilantro, which Associate #2 also didn't bother to ask me if I wanted or not) topping my salad. If I hadn't received such amazing service in the past where associates have asked me whether or not I wanted certain items or concerned themselves with what I want on my meal, then this experience wouldn't have stood out so much.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,8,2,1,2SAvbDiDSci4wEcGD02atQ

I give it a 1 star because of their customer service. It's horrible. Not by all employees but most. At one point every time I came and picked up my food my order was always wrong. The employee in the food line never properly greets you. They look miserable. I have heard many times in standing in the line about similar issues from other people.
I have even called this store a few times to tell a manager about how I found bones in my chicken and how my order was once again wrong.
I also noticed each time I come I owe a new amount of money. I get the SAME exact thing every time. So I saved 6 recipes and yep prices ranged from $6-$22 nuts.

Also depending on who's working you will get a stamp on your stamp card. Then when I question why I don't get a stamp I get a rude response and told to have a great day.

I downloaded this app just to make a review and this will also be my first review of anything ever. 

The last 4 times I have been to this location the service has got progressively worse. The first two times it didn't have anything to do with me and both times it was the same Asian employee. 3rd time the white kid with tattoos on his arms who might be a semi new hire and the 4'8"" Mexican lady that usually runs the cash register we the ones to  blame. 4th time was the most ridiculous visit. I walk in and there is only one person in line and he was getting steak nachos and asked for extra steak, which they were out of. He said he would wait because it looked like the steak was almost done cooking on the grille. I wanted a steak salad and I said I would wait as well. The front line person told the kid on the grille who's name I want to say is Jason or Chris that we need steak. Just so happened the two people behind me wanted steak also so at this point the whole line was stopped and everyone was just awkwardly standing there. So the front line lady told the grille cook again that we really need that steak right now and he just nods his head. I work in the industry and I know how people's misconception of time is so ill try to be very accurate. About 1.5 min later he starts slowly taking the meat off and putting it into a metal container, which I understand it need to cook all the way. He then proceeded to go into the back and get a new container of mean and then loads the grille up with the raw meat. At this point everyone is getting super aggravated. The front line lady tells him again that we need the steak asap. He slowly washes his hands and puts gloves on and then a metal glove over the food service glove and then a plastic glove over the metal. So it's been about 2-3 more min sense he put the raw meat on and then he starts seasoning it and waits about 30second and then he starts slowly and I mean slowly flipping the meat!!! The girl then again asks him for the steak now and he finally starts chopping it up. At this point there is about 12 people behind me.

Drinks: I am completely obsessed with the mint limeade here. So so yummy!

Chicken Quesidilla: Not super cheesy. More meat than cheese. Very Yummy.

[DECOR] 
I really like the decor if this fast food restaurant. They have hanging lanterns, colorful chairs and it feels like outside inside. Very Cute.

[SERVICE]
They don't explain anything on the menu for instance they'll ask if you wanted your burrito enchilada style but not willing to explain what that means. Your just supposed to know apparently. Also they didn't mention guacamole is additional. Found out at the register it was $1.25 extra which was no problem but they should have mentioned it.

No on can deny that the food is anything short of amazing at Cafe Rio. You can see the tortillas being hand made, tomatoes being crushed, and chicken right on the grill. The food is fresh and delicious.

However, you'll likely miss the visuals of the high quality food as you stare, baffled, at the inefficiency of the employees. Lacking any kind of leadership during any time of day, the staff grouchily fumbles through their tasks at snail-like speed, often making mistakes and never coming anywhere close to a smile. Organization is a word that doesn't exist behind the cooking line or in the sticky, dysfunctional dining room. The drink station offers great limeade and on-point horchata, if you can pull the soles of your shoes out of the syrupy, sticky floor surrounding it.

Don't even think of coming around dinner time unless your definition of a good time includes standing in line for an hour and listening to fellow patrons openly complain about the speed of service.

Maybe at some point my lunch and dinner funds will afford the staff a field trip to a Chipotle to learn how to work in an efficient, clean establishment.",QCoBkB_m0v9smTM9voMZMg,0,0,3,yRMwbJlbRtVNwaJNdkNQ1w

I'm not expecting Four Seasons treatment at a fast casual place, but can I get a hello and a smile? My god. They just stare and give nods instead of questions, put the wrong stuff on my order, despite very clear directions.

Then in the middle of order, there was some kind of molasses speed shift change. They had 20+ workers standing around chatting. Now a line of ten people forms behind me and I haven't moved. The new guy grabs my salad and starts loading it up with everything without asking. I had to start over. The workers are bumping each other, touching  everything, and joking around. 

Finally they try to get me to pay for someone else's meal, then try to over charge me. Just the worst.

I'd like to say I'll never be back. But in a few months I'll forget and be a glutton again.

This has always been a great restaurant with its convenient location and large seating area, but the work ethic of the workers is what brings it down.

5001166,2015-09-19,0,YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg,"I have eaten here one other time and would describe it as ""meh"". My first encounter took place about 6 months ago on a Wednesday during the lunch rush - high noon.  It was busy, but no big deal. As I got up to order though, the worker at the start of the line started yelling at me- like, YELLING at me ""WHAT DO YOU WANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????"" It immediately gave a prison mess hall vibe. Not to mention that the 37 people in front of me were not even starting to move any closer to the register so chill, homie. I ordered a chicken burrito. $1 extra for grilled chicken, on a $8 burrito... Somebody should tell these guys that it costs more to braise something for 3 hours than it does to grill it for 10 minutes. Throw some thighs on the grill and hit it with a little lime juice and salt and call it a day,  but dont charge extra for chicken- CHICKEN. He threw some rice, beans, and shredded chicken in a tortilla, and went for the sauce ladle in an attempt to slather everything in sauce and cheese. Enchilada-style is another up sell I am not interested in, and he seemed put off at my refusal. Then he sent it through a conveyor belt toaster oven exactly like a Quiznos sandwich. When it came out the other end I had to wait a good 9 minutes to seal the deal because there were so many other people's food in front of mine. It seems like you would want to put all the ingredients in a burrito before you roll it, but not Cafe Rio. They prefer to unroll and reroll after toasting it. Finally, some girl grabbed my cold-toasted-shredded-chicken burrito and asked if I want anything else in it. I was over it and said no to put myself out of my misery, and paid $12 for a chicken, rice, and bean burrito, with a small fountain drink. There was no trace of salt present in any one of the 4 ingredients, and it fell apart the second I picked it up. You would think that if someone does nothing but roll burritos day-in and day-out, and yells at people about their burritos, that guy can probably roll a pretty goddam good burrito. He totally didnt.
I came by to give them another chance tonight. It was 9:30 pm and they close at 11. The guy that previously yelled at me and gave me a shitty burrito wrap was eating at one of the tables toward the front, and another young guy was at first base on the line stuffing tortillas. I was looking to go big so I ordered a GRILLED chicken burrito and a taco  to boot. His response: ""We don't have any more grilled chicken."" They didn't run out of chicken- they decided not to grill any more chicken. I know this because when I asked for clarification he pointed to the two cooks in the back, threw them under the bus and told me they weren't making any more. 
I would have overlooked my first experience but this is dumb. I'm sitting here now eating my delicious Teriyaki Madness because they are friendly and competent, and the cooks don't decide to stop working an hour-and-a-half before the posted closing time.

The ambience of this place is good.  Brand new and clean.  This particular location can get a bit crowded though, especially during dinner hours.  Whats especially great is that you could just walk over to the Golden Spoon next door for some dessert =).

One of my main things I like to get is their steak tostada.  It's pretty much a taco salad.  They put a hard flat taco shell at the bottom and pile it high with some rice, beans, a ton of lettuce, sour cream, cheese pico de gallo, and those little tortilla chip strips.  I think it's a good option if your kind of watching what you eat (just x out the cheese and sour cream).  I really love their creamy dressing too.

If you're getting a burrito or tacos though, look out of the extras like sour cream and guacamole though - they cost extra and they don't tell you that when you are ordering.

The dining room and drink station were a wreck. In fact the signs above the horchata and strawberry lemonade were mixed up and the employee told me that they just never changed the signs and I should be able to figure out which drink was which?

How about we fix the signs and clean the area instead of arguing about my ability to interpret which beverage is mislabeled? I can see a diabetic consuming the wrong beverage and suing.

In general my observations are.. 

Pros:

Generous portions, fresh tasty food.

Cons: 

Can be pricy (let's remember this is still fast food), about $10 for a 3 taco steak order and no drink, you be the judge.

Consistently rude staff at the food assembly line (see other reviews)

Food although fresh, tends to be soggy and messy, and generally looks terrible.

Not sure how clean this place is, as I've seen dirty tables and cross contamination when staff refills and prepares the food.

Rude staff (I know I mentioned this but I must reiterate) 

Anyhow, ultimately I'm dissatisfied with this Cafe Rio location and I wouldn't recommend going. 

However, if you don't mind the rude staff that gives you plenty of condescending looks just because you take more than 2 seconds to decide between pinto or black beans, then go for it.

5499007,2012-05-08,1,YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg,"True fact. Since I discovered Cafe Rio, probably 95% of the burritos I've eaten have come from here.

They make Mission-style burritos here, with savory beans, cilantro lime rice (that is inexplicably beige), sauce and cheese on the inside along with your meat of choice, and lettuce and pico next to it in an aluminum tray. I almost always get the shredded, braised chicken and the hot red sauce. Unlike Chipotle's rubbery, greasy meat, the chicken and roast chile beef here are flavorful without overpowering the other flavors in the burrito. The aroma of the red sauce is intoxicating.

They run the burritos through a conveyor oven and then add veggies - a ""why didn't anyone think of it sooner"" innovation that keeps hot stuff hot and cold stuff cold. Hey, remember the McDLT? Nah, me neither.

Though the salsa fresca served here isn't anything special, their ""wall of flame"" covered in hot sauces is a great way to add heat and flavor.

Honestly? The best part of this burrito is the tortilla. Made fresh moments before you order, it's dense and mild and almost more reminiscent of a naan in some bites.

Service is generally very good here, and the staff definitely seems to have a cordial rapport with their guests. Some of the quirky chants I could do without, but it makes the place livelier than your usual burrito assembly line.

I would have gotten the three tacos with fire-grilled steak... except they were out of fire-grilled steak.  The person who ordered in front of me got fire-grilled steak... so I guess he got the last of it.  It was around 6pm on a Wednesday, so I'm not quite sure what that is about.  

Anyway, I ended up ordering a pork barbacoa taco and a chicken taco.  The barbacoa taco was fantastic... but super messy and just kept dripping all over the place.  However, I can handle a mess when the taco is this good.  Unfortunately, I can't really say the same for the chicken taco... but I did see that they offer an upgraded chicken, so I guess I must have ordered the chicken that they know is not their best chicken.  Strange thinking there.

The chips were out of a bag, but the queso was pretty good.  It had a little bit of a canned (or bagged) cheese taste, but the added peppers, onions, etc. made it pretty good.

5922106,2013-06-26,1,YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg,I think for a quick decent Mexican meal this is a good spot.  Not the kind of place you would go on a date but the food is good and the portions are good.  They make fresh tortillas right there and they're tasty.  I've had the enchiladas and the tacos here and they were good.  I think it is more of a lunch spot than dinner place but it depends on your mood I suppose.  They also have a great selection of hot sauces over by the soda machine so they are almost guaranteed to have what you like in that department.  I think next time I'll try the nachos because I am just a sucker for nachos!,gijqnKe5syCZj7al4kgxFQ,1,1,3,kZ5My-7EOJCfhgYr9eDdkA
5923647,2017-10-24,0,YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg,"I made an online order at 530 for a steak salad to be picked up at 645 and the order wasn't even started let alone the fact that there was an additional wait for the steak to be made. I'm not entirely sure what the delay time is between receiving an order to actually making it, but I would think that the desired pickuptime isn't the time to actually start making the order. The wait is the exact reason why I placed an online order to begin with, if I have to wait longer than somebody who just walked in, then what's the point?",lurboRM0_-3JQD29z6gO9A,0,0,2,VDZfaq3M7_SYysN5PFgo7Q
5927464,2014-01-18,0,YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg,"I love the food here, but that is the only reason I keep coming back. It's definitely not for the customer service. 

I went on a Sunday with my mom and sister and they are supposed to open at 11. Another customer walked in through the side door right at 11 as they hadn't opened the front door yet, so we followed. The girl behind the counter told us ""We'll be with you in a couple minutes, we're not open yet."" Really? Because the sign says 11 and it's 11. I've worked in retail before and if we had customers standing outside the building, we opened early, if not, right on time. You don't keep paying customers waiting, it's just bad business. You should be ready to open right when you are supposed to.

 Then I asked if they had any more Cholula because there was none on the shelf and the cashier just immediately answered no without even looking. So I asked for Tapatia. Again, immediate no. So I pointed to the bottle of Tapatia that I saw sitting behind the counter. ""Oh, that must be the last one!"" Oh thanks for going through so much trouble to do your job.

Oh and don't even bother attempting to order an extra taco. I tried ordering an extra shrimp taco once because the order comes with two and I swear it's like I asked then to perform the unspeakable. I told then I would pay the price for the single taco (You can order two or just one so obviously combine the price. I know it's expensive. I just want three tacos!) And the kid taking my order still had to consult with two other people before they would make me three. 

I love the steak and shrimp tacos and I crave the creamy cilantro dressing. If the customer service was better, I would have given a better rating.",OVEEHmbdl_B0Zo9kttbLfA,1,0,3,jZdBwHCBVS6C5_TcUfCJoA

It does get stressful; however, when you're ordering because it seems they are pushing you along very quickly, but it's all worth it.  Large portions, and have loved everything I've tried, although the pork is a little too sweet for my taste.",42LUxWiXgD6P4FHYZ3K9tA,0,0,5,qHnRkrh1_moTnEhUz5OAIg
5959933,2015-11-16,5,YaTlfyPieOXwHH16wzieFg,"I've never been a big fan of Café Rio, but given it's convenient location and online ordering, we decided to pick some up for a quick dinner last week. 

We placed our order and left to pick it up in the time scheduled. We arrived at the restaurant and the food wasn't ready yet. We weren't in a huge hurry, but they seem a little disorganized at this location. It took several people to handle our checkout and when they said my mom's bowl wasn't ready because the chicken was still cooking and would take another 15 minutes, they offered us a different protein. Since we didn't want the rest of the food to be sitting out while we waited for the grilled chicken she changed to shredded chicken. It was only after we decided that did we realize they hadn't even made the rest of the food yet, so there was really no need to change the order. 

The food was ok, but I don't see myself going out of my way to return to this location with better non-chain restaurants in the area I'd rather give my money to.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,12,6,2,54f3xkVR2U1KWjwxvXr55g

But let's get back to the Pork Barbecoa which sounds like a comic book Swine Pirate but is really a tasty and filling way to spend your lunch or dinner. We come here often and I've tried the other items but the PB is what I return for.  Plus my neices love how they display their happiness when you order extra meat.",OLd25x0N_CgF5053Iqs8xA,0,0,4,FngwWIT1Z7mOpK3_H14y4Q
