Apparently the chef thinks the more garlic you add the better . I like garlic as much a the next guy, however i could not eat the Cesar salad due to the amount of garlic. It's too much when its too spicy to eat due the the high concentration of garlic . The pasta is just ok , def. not worth the price . Especially the fact that this place calls itself OFF the Strip, and still charges the same as much better restaurants ON the strip. I Have lived in the neighborhood since this place opened and this was my first and last time . Not worth the price for the food they serve.",aahxmN1tsvlufuU_y4OT1A,2,0,2,tWoEeI3WuYl-yw7mkdXPyw

The chops were cooked to perfection which was covered in this great sauce with chunks of mushrooms and bacon.  The Chicken Parm is ridiculous!!!

The spaghetti with meatball and sausage (humorously known by those in the know as the ""Lance Armstrong"") pasta with marinara sauce is simply the best pasta dish I've had.  My girlfriend prefers the garbage salad which she said is spectacular.  I also highly recommend Zest's Linguine with white clams.  It's freakin' yummy!  Finally, don't miss the side of spinach.  It's never overcooked and is skillfully seasoned with garlic and olive oil.

Donna, the bartender/waitress, keeps her cool no matter how buried she is and she consistently takes the time to make us feel at home and welcome.  Jesse is great too.  The thing about Zest, is that it has a locals feel (think your favorite pub) with stellar food.  That's a powerful combination!  My only complaint is the bread.  It's consistently hard and somewhat tasteless.  However, overall this is one of my favorite, if not my absolute favorite, restaurants in Las Vegas.  5 stars are well deserved.

Service is friendly, and watching the chef work his magic in the kitchen makes you feel like you're in for something special.

 The waitstaff serves up a nice side of ""Brooklyn"" with every meal. We had the beef wellington and chicken saltimbocca (I think I butchered the spelling there!), and both were outstanding. 

One of their appetizer specials was scampi stuffed with cream cheese and horseradish, wrapped in bacon and baked in the oven and served with some type of amazing butter sauce. I don't think my heart could take it every day, but it might be worth heading to an early grave for! 

You can certainly head down to the strip and spend way more money, but you'd be hard-pressed to find better-tasting comparable menu items at any price.

Like many other reviewers we were offered the ""around the world"" option which involved getting little bites of a bunch of different appetizers -- one of each for each of us.  And it's a great (though not inexpensive) way to try everything.  

Our favorites were the steak and asparagus rolls and the Thai shrimp (stuffed with cheese, wrapped in bacon and served with a sweet and spicy sauce).  We probably could have stopped before the main courses and been happy, but we pressed on.  The salads were tasty, the pasta was perfectly cooked, the meatballs were huge yet tender and meaty, and the cheesecake (on the house for the birthday boys) was light and very good but not the best I've ever had.  Another favorite of ours was the rib eye sliced up for our tasting and served with delicious creamy horseradish sauce -- not very Italian, but really delicious!

On a side note, one of the people in our party doesn't eat beef or pork and her options were a bit limited.  When we asked for a shrimp without the bacon for her they were happy to oblige but it took a long time.

They charge a corkage fee of $20 per bottle, but if you want to order off they menu there were a few good and reasonable choices.

If you have a car, it's worth the drive to try it.  If you're taking a cab, it would probably be a rather expensive ride so you might as well just shell out the extra money on the strip (Rao's is pretty good).",WGwjcdAGsMCBNnnrc-Fzfg,0,0,4,699GqitoUT47vWQx4hXjNw

This place is in Southern highlands.  about 10 min south of Mandalay Bay.

They had a great selection from pasta to seafood to steak and chops.  I got there a little late and gotta say the only complaint was it was a little slow to get the food after we ordered but it really was worth the wait.

We started off with some prawns and chicken wings.  The wings were good with some sort of sweet glaze on em.  They also came with fries.  The prawns were a thai style sauce but wrapped in bacon.  They were really good but only got 2 so i thought for the price you should have gotten at least 3.

The main course I got some chicken wrapped in prosciutto in a Marsala type sauce.  It was great.  Chicken was very moist and the sauce had some mushrooms in which tasted great.  It came with a side of fresh spinach.

I will be here again for sure.  My buddies that go hear a lot said that if there isn't something on the menu you like you can tell them what your in the mood for and they will try to put something together for you.  Its that kind of service and quality of food which will keep this place here for a very long time.

When I balked the manager confronted me and said I should have had a reservation.

I was very impressed by the house salad of mixed greens with a nice and light balsamic dressing...so unlike the run of the mill salad.

For appetizers we had the sweet chili shrimp and the ribs.  If you like your ribs tough and tasteless, then don't order these because they fall off the bone and had a light tangy delicious flavor. The shrimp were very good and the biggest shrimp we had ever been served.

For entrees we had 4 cheese ravioli and the tortellini in a tomato cream sauce.  We lived in the heart of little Italy in Connecticut for many years and these two dishes were comparable to the best Italian restaurants we frequented.  I am a sauce snob and very fussy about my tomato sauce and this one exceeded my expectations.

I have saved the best for last....if you have any liking for rice pudding, you must try this one.  We have renamed it ""Beyond Rice Pudding"" because it is the best we have ever had...so creamy...like a cross between a tapioca and rice pudding.

And right at the finish line for SUPER desserts is the cheesecake which we took ""to go"" and had later in our hotel room.  Light, creamy and drizzled lightly with chocolate, strawberries and caramel.

We come to Las Vegas often and we will put this place on our ""must do"" list....well worth the 15 minute ride from the strip.

It was the best decision we ever made. Even though it is a ways from the strip, it was well worth the trip. The prices were amazing for the quality of the food. 

Never would have imaged from the outside of the place, what we found on the inside. We were extremely surprise. Nice size bar with a large variety of wines along with a number of different beers. 

As far as the food, I order the lobster ravioli and my boyfriend order the chicken saltimbocca both were full favored. Amazed at the quality of the food. After trying these two items, we are definitely planning to come back to this location to try more of the menu. This place could easily be placed inside one of the high end casino/resorts on the strip. The food was that great. We had eaten at a number of the high end restaurants on the strip and feel that this particular place could not only compete with them but would surpass a number of them. 

At the end of the meal, our waiter brought us a complementary slice of the their in-house made cheesecake which was over the top delicious. We were stuffed after the dinner but the cheesecake was to great to not eat the whole piece served. The cheesecake was served with strawberries in a strawberry sauce and some chocolate sauce on the other side of the slice which complemented it very well. 

We most also give extreme remarks to our waiter, Chris who made us feel welcomed and did a wonderful job of serving us.

1148322,2009-09-28,0,PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ,"We dined here on September 17, 2009 on a recommendation from a family member. Let me tell you, as soon as you enter the door you are quickly acknowledged, seated, and welcomed. So many other restaurants acknowledge you as if just going through the motions, but not here. Here they welcome you with a smile and treat you like a friend or family member. 

On the suggestion or our server, he recommended a assortment of appetizers, which I thought would be listed on the menu. Not so, he ordered us a handful of appetizers off the menu, four to be exact. So here's a list of what we had in regards to appetizers. 

1. Beef wrapped asparagus- great presentation, succulent and tender beef wrapped around a stalk of asparagus, with a mouth watering sauce that left me wanting more. 

2. Bacon wrapped shrimp with a sweet chili sauce- Now this was done right, the shrimp was moist and tender and the bacon cooked to perfection, the goat cheese added a a delicate touch and the right combination to compliment the shrimp and the bacon. The chili sauce had enough ""wow factor"" not to destroy or overpower the dish. I considered it my favorite appetizer and will be ordering another round next week when I visit. 

3. Crab cakes- What can I say? I love crab cakes, this was done well. The sauce sealed the deal, we were seriously contemplating ordering another one, but decided not to, as to give our palettes a crack at trying other dishes. 

4. I honestly can't recollect what we ate, but I think it had artichokes in it and I thought it would make a great bruschetta. Sorry, my memory failed me on this one. 

We then shared a ceaser salad that came with it's own homemade croutons. They were kind enough to split the salad among the two of us. I thought it was okay, pretty standard. 

I ordered the vodka penne as my entree and let me tell you, it was WONDERFUL!!!! 
The sauce was perfect, and complimented the penne quite wonderfully. They really know how to cook pasta, al dente (most restaurants 95% of the time overcook pasta)........... My husbands not a big fan of pasta, but let's just say he reconsidered after having a taste of my dish. 

My husband ordered the panko crusted pork chops with a Asian sauce and assorted veggies. We really enjoyed the tender and moist pork chops, you didn't have to cut it with a knife, that's how tender it was. However, I felt that the dish fell short. I probably would have preferred them coating the pork chop with panko (Japanese breadcrumbs), then frying, letting it sit, then slice and plate it. Then serving the sauce on the side, to accompany the chops. 

Heck, they can even be a little more creative and serve an array of sauces; such as aioli, pesto, or spicy ketchup. I felt like the sauce (sweet and sour) made the panko rather soggy, which wasn't that appealing to our taste buds and did nothing to enhance the porkchop. 

I was quite full by this point,  so pace yourself as you're eating as it's not a sin to take home leftovers (which we did). Even by being full, it didn't stop me or my husband from dessert. 
Let me tell  you, you just have to , I mean really have to, try their homemade cheesecake, made from top notch ingredients and get this, they don't use a mixer to concoct this together. One bite and you'll be hooked for sure, as we both were. The cheesecake was creamy and smooth and not to mention rich, a winner in my book. Just gives us a reason to go back and try the other thing's on their menu. 

The decor is simple and inviting with simple tables and chairs. The kitchen is set us so you can observe the staff in action. There is a bar with a couple of television screens that were set on sport channels. Yes, guy's it's a great place to impress your date and you get a chance to check out the sports scores (just make sure you keep more focused on your date as opposed to the television). 

Overall, the quality of the food for the most part is excellent, they really have a passion for what they do. Bring a big appetite, because portions here, were more than fair; if not bring in a reuseable container because you're probably going home with leftovers, especially if you had a couple of appetizers pre-entree. This place was moderately priced, the service was above and beyond what you're normally used to. Don't be surprised if one of the owners comes up to chat with you, as Tom and Al did with us. 

I would recommend making dinner reservations ahead of time, as it's gets busy during the dinner rush hour. 

With that said, we'll be back soon!!!

I've been in Vegas for 4 days. I've eaten at both Nine (at the Palms Hotel)  and the Palm (Caesars)  in the last 3 days. 2 'steak houses' that supposedly serve Prime Beef. No, not really. At over $50 for a steak, that just cannot be true. Prime beef shouldn't be this tough. And to miss a temperature in it's preparation is just criminal.  My room service steak from MGM Grand was way better.

Ok, so it's not for everybody. The service is a little bit different than most people are used to. To me, that is what sets Off the Strip apart from anything else. Everybody in the building will bend over backwards to help you out. 

The food is the best I've had on my trip, end of subject. So good, I'm going back tomorrow night as the ending of my trip.  The wine choices are outstanding. You're not going to find a Chateau Margaux here. You will not be disappointed with the offerings. 

They take care of you like family. The food is outstanding and you cannot beat it for the price. In comparison to Strip pricing, Off the Strip is just in a category by itself.",o4COFBmIzlYg1h5Ra8sAkQ,0,0,5,Ff_jHOwQwSmE8GFmgxGTUA

1258704,2010-06-23,0,PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ,"I went to this place to try somewhere different, as had found excellent reviews on another site.  It was quite a trip for us, but overall, well worth it.  

It is situated in a newer strip mall, nothing fancy but not old and dirty either.  It has a pretty open layout, and you can see right into the kitchen from the dining area, which is nice.  The place is extremely clean, nicely decorated, and has at least 3 flat screen TV's.  It is very noisy inside with the TV's blasting out sports, a somewhat cramped dining area, and the din of the kitchen.  This is not the place for a quiet romantic dinner, but a good place to take friends and people who like watching the game while they eat.

We didn't call ahead or make reservations, but it seems that is a good idea because they can be very busy.  Even though we didn't make reservations, the owner, Tom, was able to seat the four of us at the last open table right away.  He also introduced us to his brother, who was serving tables and was obviously a Lakers fan, he was wearing a sleeveless jersey, and had the Celtics - Lakers game at full blast.  I don't mind the casualness, but seeing a guy's pits while he's serving food is pretty gross (one star knocked off for that), luckily he wasn't serving our table. 

Our server was very friendly, but didn't make any recommendations.  Our party of four started with the unadvertised ""Around the World"", where you get to sample different appetizers for about as long as you like.  I only knew about the Around the World from reading other reviews.  We had the grilled artichoke hearts, Rolled NY - thin NY steak wrapped around asparagus and provolone, sweet chile & bacon prawns - my favorite, and pesto garlic bread.   

For our entrees we ordered the Chicken & Artichokes, Chicken Saltimbocca, Spaghetti Squash and Chef Al's Special Pork Chops.  I also ordered an entree of Chicken Fettuccine to go for the kid at home.  We got house salads with all of them.  The balsamic vinaigrette had a touch of honey in it, and was excellent.  The entree portion sizes were decent for all of the entrees, except the serving with the Pork Chops was huge!  Two very large chops, enough for two or three people.   Luckily my daughter's boyfriend has a hollow leg, and finished the entire plate by himself.   All in all, everyone raved about their dishes. I also expected to receive Chef Al's Potato Pie with my order, but instead got roasted potatoes.  When I asked Tom about it, he said he had too many complaints about the Potato Pie (being unhealthy) and was taking them off the menu.  He whipped up a special plate of them for us.  They were delicious:  mashed potatoes, with cheese and Prosciutto mixed in.  Awesome stuff, it would be a shame if he took them off the menu.  As an extra treat, during our meal Tom's brother made an appetizer of garlic bread, pesto, grilled peppers, onions, garlic and provolone and grilled it to a crisp.  He made enough for the entire house and went around giving them to everyone for free.  Now how often does that happen?  

The only ""mistake"" made during the night was that our server switched me from Pinot Grigio to Sauvignon Blanc.  But, she left me the extra half glass that was left over, so I wasn't complaining.  We were also treated to a slice of cheesecake to share, and by that point in the night, that's all I had room for.

Our tab, not including taxes or tip, came to $214. 

PROS: Superb food, super friendly owners and staff who treat you like a friend

Tomatio Bacon Bean soup:  Just the name of it made me try it.  OMG!  Delicious!!  I was expecting a small cup, and they gave me a bowl that could've fed 3 people!

Beef Stroganoff:  Cooked perfect and they used wheat pasta. Taste wasn't too strong, nor too subtle.  Excellent!

Spaghetti with two meatballs (each the size of a baseball) and sausage:  Very apparent this was prepared fresh!  The meatballs were tender, and evenly cooked through the middle.  

Chicken with mushroom / artichoke sauce:  I wasn't a fan to begin with, but it was cooked perfect as the chicken was tender / juicy.

Cheescake desert:  Like we could've past up their sweets menu.  Exquisite!

PORTIONS were plentiful!  PRICE was reasonable given the quality, diverse menu selection, and proportions.

It's off the beaten path in a shopping center.  Parking was okay.  The place was packed, but we lucked out and got a table.  Service was decent (not great, but not awful), but they were busy.  Food took a little longer than anticipated (we were going to a show afterwards), but you can't rush the quality (fresh fresh fresh prepared).

1296489,2013-05-31,0,PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ,"This is always a favorite local spot for us and we truly love the food. Great quality dishes with amazing flavor. We have always had good friendly service at this restaurant but it saddens me that our last visit left us not wanting to return. Our experience started off warm and friendly and we enjoyed our dishes as usual but 2 specific incidents regarding our service were quite disturbing. 

We discovered one of the martini glasses we were sipping out of was chipped in 2 places on the rim. When we told our bartender about it she didn't offer to exchange the glass or make a new drink, which would be the standard response in any establishment. She instead informed us she was trying to save on glasses and she would try to give another glass once my partner finished drinking that one in the chipped glass and she brushed it off as if we were to just deal with it. We insisted that she change it out for any other glass at this point due to the potential health risk.

When it came time to pay our bill it arrived 20 minutes after we asked. Once it finally arrived we waited another 25 minutes with no interaction from her. We decided to inquire again about paying our bill as we were under the impression she just forgot about us by this point as she continually passed us by. She finally took the bill and another 15 minutes went by with no interaction when we finally again inquired about our bill and she lost her temper on us stating that the machine was not responding and she wasn't only bar tending she was also serving food at the bar and she was very busy and had many other things to do besides take care of our check. Maybe she just assumed we had the time to sit there and wait over 50 minutes while she tending to the 2 other couples at the bar. Her tone was really condescending and rude.

That being said we have been to this restaurant numerous other times when it was much busier and the service was always timely and friendly so maybe she was just having a bad night. 

Neither of these situations are really a big deal if handled respectfully and with some industry standard communication to the customers.  Simple responses like ""sorry about the glass let me exchange that for you right away"" and ""sorry about the wait and thank you for your patience"" would have done just fine.

I don't enjoy going out for a nice dinner in the evening where I feel I am inconveniencing or bothering the staff and especially don't appreciate being ignored and then spoken to in a rude manner with no regard for our time so unfortunately we won't be returning to this establishment.",oB6dMD53ejop-8hQNHI7yg,0,0,3,tDZcmhGFD_oxrkTxvZWeZQ

We decided to go to dinner here based off of the reviews and boy were we disappointed.  We were barely greeted by the host/waitress and told to just pick a table wherever we wanted.  We waited several minutes for someone to come with a menu, and when they did they just dropped them off and didn't say anything.  While reviewing the menu, they brought us some water and asked if we were ready.  We decided to order the Rolled New York (because of all the rave reviews) and Rigatoni alla Vodka. 

We were basically the only people in the restaurant and the food still took forever.  The brought us bread with our drinks, and this was probably the saving grace of the entire meal.  When our food finally arrived, I was severely underwhelmed by how bland the Rigatoni alla Vodka was.  For what the sauce lacked in flavor, they seemed to try and compensate it with black pepper.  To top it off, it was way overpriced and not worth it one bit.  Every bite felt like I was eating a forkful of pepper...horrible.  The Rolled New York was nothing to write home about and the steak part was overdone.

The atmosphere was very casual and I could see why families and big groups would like coming here, as they wouldn't have to worry about behaving kids or loud conversation.

First off, the service and attentiveness were awesome. Our waitress was super friendly and happily answered all our (wife's) questions. Tom, owner, stopped by several times to check how we were doing. And . . because it was our first visit, they gave us a free cheesecake dessert, which was one of the best I've had and despite being a busy Friday night. 

As for the food, it was as advertised. We tried the beef wrapped asparagus, pork roulade, crab cake, NZ lamb chops and pasta w/ bolognese. Our favorite was the crab cake, which was mostly crab and a little breading. Not a pasta guy, I had the lamb chops which came in a very generous portion and was cooked just as ordered - medium.

I've been here twice, and both times the food was great and the service was attentive.  The staff the second time around was much more friendly, with several different people checking on us, even though they were crowded and very busy.  The first time I went there though, it was just my 11 year old daughter and me.  The distaste displayed by the waiter that I had brought a (very well behaved and mature) child in there was obvious and very strange to me. Even more so because the second time I ate there (with adults only) there was a little girl, maybe about 6 years old, running around the restaurant and in the kitchen.  Bizarre.  I wasn't offended.  Some people just don't like kids.  But I did find it odd.  I know they usually bring free dessert if it's your first time there, and I heard it offered to the tables around us, but it seemed that our waiter was trying to rush us out.  HOWEVER, he was attentive, if not friendly, and the food was good.  Location is perfect, so if we don't feel like sushi or tapas, we'll probably be back.

 This place is amazing not only in food but in service.  This place always remembers me every time I come here (Rita the best waitress by the way). Now on to the food, I've had the filet minon and its spectacular from the first bite to the last its like an orgasm with every bite its that good.

The second dish I had was something I've never heard of,  Scampi Stuffed Chicken wow is all I have to say. Its a chicken breast stuffed with shrimp served over noodles. Mouth watering right. 

And finally the Beef Wellington I never had a BW before it was soo good it tasted different with every bite and Rita my awesome waitress told that its better than Gordon Ramsay BW. I believe it. 

This is my favorite restaurant and I love I hope many people go its worth every cent you pay and I will be back.

When you first walk in, the place looks small.  You have a great view of the kitchen (not one of the positives, in my opinion).  Also, the food menu is listed on chalk boards above the kitchen, which is fine, unless you want to know the ingredients.  They do have regular menus, but it appears we had to ask for one, as opposed to being offered one. We were personally served by the owner, whom was very friendly and charismatic.  He suggested we do ""around the world,"" which was tapas-style eating with their appetizer menu.  We had originally ordered the crab cakes, sweet chili & bacon prawns (prawns w/ cream cheese, bacon, sweet chili sauce), and rolled New York (thin NY strip steak wrapped around grilled asparagus and provolone); however, we were soon informed that they had ran out of crab cakes, so we switched for the artichoke hearts.  He also offered us the scallops, the daily special, on a complimentary basis. We also shared half orders of house and Caesar salads and a half order of the Chef Al's Favorite Rigatoni.  The owner then also offered us a piece of cheesecake and dessert drinks free of charge to end our evening.

All of the food was amazing - everything was flavorful and also unique.  My favorite appetizer was the sweet chili & bacon prawns.  The sweet chili sauce was unlike anything I had ever had before.  Of course, anything with bacon also gets high ratings in my book.  The rolled New York was also interesting since I had never heard of rolled steak, but it was a good alternative to ordering a full steak (which they had available as well).  The salads were also flavorful - tasty dressings - and the pasta was amazing.  The fried zucchini garnishes and garlic cloves definitely made the dish.  Also, the cheesecake was extremely flavorful, better than cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory in my opinion.

I was extremely impressed with the customer service.  The owner offered great suggestions and I was grateful for the complimentary items.  I will definitely be visiting this place again!

It also offers takeout and apparently there is another location on West Tropicana.  You can also sign up to receive special offers via email or text, which (according to the owner) includes specials such as free bottles of wines, free dinners for 4, etc.",6N8scdRhsaGLZxvqriE7iw,0,0,5,deSD23OQBGPtEjikYZ-tqg

We ordered clam chowder soup for starters. The soup was ok, it seemed like they had to dump the left over  soup with dried up crust in a bowl for us. It wasn't bad, but you can tell that it was made 6 hours ago. 

Our main entree included pesto creme salmon with penne (mine) and my gf got halibut with rice and vegetables.

She was very nice about it and offered to change it for halibut, but my gf was ok with what she got. My pasta was very good and as I got the fish that I had ordered. 

We ordered their NY cheesecake, which I can say is the best cheesecake I've ever eaten. It was not too sugary and very light for a cheesecake. When the bill came the waitress didn't charge us for the cheese cake. The dessert was on the house since they messed up my gf's order.

Maybe I am not as picky as some of the negative reviewers here, but who cares if they have a single paint on a plain beige wall? Are we HGTV judges now? What I care is about the food! You don't like garlic? Oh well. I love it :) Everyone's taste is different; it doesn't mean the food is bad.

And by the way, that wall is gone :) They expanded recently, added a full lounge, and now the place gets so busy sometimes, I've had to make reservations.

The staff is super friendly. They know me by name, they recognize my voice on the phone and they are always smiling. :)

Tucked in the corner of a shopping center at Cactus and Southern Highlands Parkway, the setup is a small, casual bistro that looks like it might seat 40 or 50, including some seats at the bar and a small counter. The kitchen's open to the dining area, and in fact forms the entire back half of the restaurant. Prices are quite reasonable, and in many cases, the food is comparable to anything I've eaten, regardless of price point. Our waiter Tom was one of the owners, and his crew maintained a friendly, Brooklyn vibe with their excellent service. Our table shared an insane appetizer of stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon, baked, then served in a butter sauce, in addition to an outstanding garbage salad.

On their food I'd give them 3 1/2 stars. The Mussels Oreganata was very good, not over cooked, the panko crumbs gives it some texture and they give you extra bread to dip in the sauce. My husband and I are more on the savory side when it comes to flavor; my scampi stuffed chicken was a little on the sweet side, It was cooked perfectly and not dry though. My husband got the Al's special pork chops which were very tender and juicy, still more on the sweeter side than we'd prefer.

First of all, I love the space and atmosphere. It is casual elegance at its finest. It's very small and tucked away in a strip mall. It's dimly lit with a nice wine bar area. In addition to the physical menus, the entire menu is written on chalkboards above the main counter. The whole space is very open - you can sit at your table and watch your meal being prepared in the kitchen. It is not at all what I had pictured in my head back when first reading about this place. It is as if a small mom and pop deli mated with an upscale Italian eatery. It works wonderfully. And it is both a terrific date spot and family dining spot.

Again, we had already somewhat eaten prior to stopping in here, so we opted to share the chili prawns and rigatoni vodka (with a meatball added). And both were outstanding. The chili prawns were just this amazing combination of flavors. We just wished that there were more than two of them (as we happily would have made a meal of just those). The rigatoni vodka definitely held up to my high vodka sauce standards. The rigatoni was perfectly al dente and the meatball was pretty good too. And bonus points for the leftovers reheating well. You know something is great when it tastes good the next day after a spin in the microwave.

We didn't order dessert, but our server surprised us with a complimentary slice of cheesecake. The cheesecake was great and we loved that it was plated with both chocolate and caramel sauce drizzles.

The service was fantastic. Our server was very nice, inquired if this was our first time, how we heard about it, etc.

This is definitely a place high on the return visit list.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,4,5,4,2shjhC3iCLLTMwuIoSQOAw

When we came in we were greeted by a very friendly waiter. The restaurant was pretty empty so we were seated very promptly. 

The waiter went over some of their specials and explained the menu to us a little bit.

Appetizer
-tomato caprese: never really a fan of this dish but it was ok here. 

We split 
-beef wellington: we both had the Caesar salad with our entree and they weren't kidding when they said it's super garlicky. It was delicious. The beef Wellington was super juicy and tender and the knife cut through it like butter. The outer crust was very crispy and flaky and delicious. 
-lobster ravioli: this dish was a little lacking. The sauce was kind of bland. It just didn't have that much flavor. This was the only dish we were disappointed with. 


Now we paid for the check then decided to check out the dessert menu last minute. The waiter was really cool about it and just gave us a complimentary slice of cheesecake. He said that we had to try it and it's on the house. He wasn't lying when he said the cheesecake was delicious. It was very cream cheesey and the bottom graham cracker crust was delicious. 

Only reason this place didn't get 5 stars was because the lobster ravioli wasn't up to par. But everything else was spot on. Will definitely come back and try some other dishes.",XetOgmeZKHhpiauBCK_t1w,1,0,4,I5YncIrzrxVYPbqVM-YSag
2025236,2018-04-29,0,PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ,"I used to love this place but it has steadily declined lately. Today I went for the last time. It started by the fact that we sat there for a good 15 minutes before our drink order was taken (due to the delay, we ordered our food at this time as well). Then another 15 before our drinks arrived. Probably 30 minutes went by before the food started to come out. When I say ""started"" I mean, it all did not come out at the same time. In fact by the time I got my order, all 5 other people at our table (including 3 other adults, my 3 year old and 6 year old) had completely finished their plates.  When my order finally did come out it was wrong. 

I ordered the Mediterranean salad off the brunch menu. According to the menu, it was supposed to have the following: mixed greens, kalamata olives, feta cheese, orzo, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and asparagus. I asked for no tomatoes and added chicken for an extra $5. What came out was a salad with mixed greens, kalamata olives, feta cheese, cucumbers, chopped pieces of penne pasta, and chicken. There was no asparagus, no peppers and no orzo. FYI, chopped penne pasta does not equal orzo. I sent it back. At this point I asked for the salad to go because everyone had finished eating and my kids had reached their max restaurant sitting threshold. When I got home I opened the salad and it was still wrong. It had no peppers and no orzo--again, chopped penne pasta is not orzo. 

First, I do not fault the server. She was very nice and as attentive as she could be. She was the only person serving. There were 8 tables at one point and she was handling all of them the best anyone could. This is an under staffing problem and I blame management. 

Second, orzo is not penne pasta. If the menu states an item has certain ingredients, those should be the ingredients used. If there is a shortage of an ingredient for some reason and a substitution is necessary, then the patron should be told upon ordering. 

Third, order was wrong--twice. The chef should be trained to know what's in each dish on the menu.",CL49o-4PE76_JArgO38UoQ,1,0,1,XlnlPBCHxbno9WL5QlQwzQ

I won't go back, at that price point, there was just no excuse for the long wait and the poor quality of the entrees.

The place expanded to add more seating, and when it did, the overall quality seems to have suffered, or so my guest, a local resident, told me afterwards. He apologized for recommending it; talk about awkward.

The bread was even of poor quality; to be fair, the salad was really good, one of the best I've ever had at any price, the Really Trashy Garbage Salad, yes that's the name, was great; we got ours with mozzarella instead of bleu cheese.

I couldn't decide on wine so I was offered a taste of the two German rieslings. The castle was too sweet, so I went what I know... Dr Loosen. Love that one.  He did forget the lemons for our water. 

Bread is served skinny loaf with a couple of partial slices through and toasted to a crunch.  Butter packets on the side. 

The entrees came with salad, I requested and alternative as I don't eat salad.  They offered me a chicken  vegetable soup.  It wasn't terrible.  I did question of it came out of a can. It was very salty but would have been good otherwise. It did have carrots, potatoes, zucchini, and kale. 

Ordered the special, Sea Bass with sweet chili sauce. It arrived in the other lemon caper sauce.  He was eager to fix the issue and brought another fish in the sauce we ordered. The sweet chili had a kick and a sticky texture because of the sauce.  Was over powering in my taste and took away from the sea bass.  Friend loved it.  I preferred the lighter flavored and flaky texture of the lemon caper. 

The chicken fettuccine alfredo was great.  Creamy sauce good all around.  

Almost forgot my precious to go box and the bartender reminded me.  Server was friendly and attentive. Wanted to try the beef Wellington but seemed pricey.  Just a bit more than I prefer to spend here over other restaurant options.",jUZW1alRK8QvdZ-pH1OquQ,6,4,4,MwSdYjwZyrJZaa7zt-q0UQ

Everyone has different tastes, so I can see how maybe others think it's great. So you may want to give it a try and see if its for you. There are a lot of good reviews - I just have never had the pleasure of that experience here.
Last night was the last time we'll come here. Not only was the food average again, my son's meal came with a giant hair in his burger. It was cooked in to the meat. And hanging out on to the rest of the plate. I have no idea how the cook could have missed that while he was cooking or plating,  but he obviously did.
I had the chicken Tristina, and it was cooked with some fresh ingredients, but it was bland. The chicken was cooked well but the coating was soggy. The vegetables it was stuffed with included mushrooms, which I wasn't told, but didn't mind that. I was sharing with my son and wouldn't have ordered though because he doesn't like them.
The wait staff is always very kind, so I don't want this to reflect on them at all. I do feel the food is over priced, even though the portions are large. The ingredients seem to be fresh, but we have never had anything that was amazing or made us say ""wow"". My husbands words as we left were ""I feel disappointed, just not satisfied.""

I made reservations for 8-and waited till 8:30 to be seated.
I had to settle the bar bill before I sat down as it couldn't be transferred over and that took another 10 minutes while I stood there trying to hand her the signed check.
Anyway, to the point-my favorite braciole is still terrific, but I ordered 2 orders and got one plate w/4-only 2 per order? Maybe I'm wrong but wasn't there 3 before?
There are no longer any veal options available and it seems other items have been removed from the list.
The quaint menu board over the kitchen that previously listed the menu and specials is now filled with promotional messaging-like happy hour, football etc.
One of the meals the spinach was in limbo between just pulled from the earth to thrown in the pan and pulled. A sauce was over the veggies which was just no good.
They removed that entree and threw in a cheesecake so 5 star for their attempt to rectify the situation to the best.
My guest didn't even eat their entree and had it boxed after a couple bites politely stating she was full.
I'm just sad that OTS may be succumbing to the typical ""started out as a hole in the wall"" to grow too big for their britches losing sight of what differentiated them vs others.

Fine. I work on the Strip. I get the 5 star dining thing, and it has its place. But it isn't personal. It isn't supposed to be an everyday experience.  

Suppose I told you that there was a spot that could hit on great food and a comfortable atmosphere every time?  Would you want to go?  You would. 

Enter Zest. 

This particular trip was for brunch, which also happens to be my favorite. Getting to have steak and eggs for $14 is amazing. Adding on the ability to finish your daughter's panCAKES (emphasis intentional as they're baked not griddles) and Bloody Mary's for $5 and I'm ready to move in. Forget that it is the caloric intake equivalent to my week, the food is fantastic. 

Service doesn't get better and it embodies the heart of Vegas- personal and efficient. They treat you like family and deserve the same from you when you tip, so don't skimp.

2608601,2013-09-01,1,PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ,"Has gotta be one of my favorite local restaurants. It's food stands up to the big fancy named strip restaurants. My boyfriend lives right next to it over in the Southern Highlands area, so we go there or order take out often. The atmosphere is laid back,  full bar, with televisions, as well as a large dining area filled with lots of locals casually dressed, enjoying dinner and having a beer or a glass of wine.  What you get from the restaurant is kind of unexpected. You would never guess that such a good restaurant would be located in the middle of a Smith's grocery store plaza. Nevertheless, the food does not lie. 

Seeing as though I've been here countless times, I'll give reviews on the dishes I love most. For apps, my faves are the calamari, the mussels, and the crab cakes. The calamari is made to order, served super fresh and hot along side the tastiest chunky marinara. I think they marinate the calamari in buttermilk or SOMETHING for DAYS because it is literally the most tender, softest calamari I've ever tried. The breading is light and crisp, not overpowered by oil and grease! 

The mussels oreganata is also one of my favorite apps. It is served in the pan that it was baked in. The mussels are topped with a garlic, lemon, buttery bread crumb concoction, with a white wine sauce. So good!

The crab cakes are also amazing. They've gotta be the biggest crab cakes I've ever seen (although they HAVE gotten smaller over time:-/ ), with crab pieces the size of quarters/half dollars lol! They're pan fried and topped with a creamy lemon sauce. Delicious!

They also serve a delicious Caesar salad (or regular salad, if you prefer) before your entree. I love the Caesar salad--it's got a HEAVY garlic taste but that's one of the things I love about it. In fact, a lot of their dishes are heavy on the garlic lol! Garlic breath for sure haha!

For the entrees, I love to order the chicken artichoke, the lobster ravioli, or the filet mignon! The chicken artichoke is sautéed pieces of chicken breast and artichokes served in a lemon butter sauce with vegetables on top of delicious soft mashed potatoes.

I don't eat pasta much because I try to steer clear from carbs, but the lobster ravioli is delicious enough to make you forget and say, ""what carbs?!"" Lobster and cheeses stuffed into their handmade pasta, the ravioli is then tossed in a red sauce with chunky tomatoes and asparagus. Delicious!!

The filet mignon is supreme! Especially for a place that's not really a steak house, the filet is delicious. In fact, when I crave for a good hunk of meat, I'll take one of these to go! It's usually served with mashed potatoes and veggies. You can also have the filet wrapped in bacon and/or topped with Gorgonzola sauce, delicious as well!

Now for dessert. The only dessert I've tried there is their cheesecake. Which every now and then, the owners will complimentarily bring one out to first timers or regulars. It's creamy and rich, served with strawberry, chocolate and caramel sauces. Good for cheesecake lovers!

The beautiful thing about Off the Strip is that the staff is so friendly and accommodating, they'll make suggestions to your order, and will gladly make changes to any dish to accommodate your palate. 

The only negative thing I can say is that it is a bit more on the pricier side. Especially considering that it is such a casual, local, neighborhood restaurant.

The menu is a mixture of Italian and American dishes....I feel like it's more so Italian than American. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, comes with steak fries and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Milanese. I know it doesn't matter to some, but I love my food to be pippin hot. And pippin hot was what Zest delivered. To my surprise, my sandwich was on the smaller size. I finished the entire thing in one sitting. Normally I would have leftovers but nope...not here. It was just right for a dinner portion though. Boyfriend actually loved his dish more than I liked mine. I wasn't in the pasta mood that night, but next time, I want to give some of them a try. They looked (from Yelp pics) and sound really good!!!!

Service was attentive. Atmosphere was a nice locals-feel restaurant. Just be aware of the one person bathroom. Don't wait until you really have to go or else you risk running to the bathroom only to find out someone is in there. I don't know why restaurants do that. It should be against code laws to only have 1 bathroom per gender. Even most Mc Donald's have multiple stall restrooms.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,4,5,4,64GUfeYheDHYEOjqwpYo6A

Being the owner of a small restaurant in the Chicago-land area (Nu Crepes) I looked to Yelp for the answer. And boy was I happy to find OTS. 

The Beef Wellington was/is absolutely amazing. Cooked perfectly. Melt in your mouth goodness.The potatoes that comes with it should be against the law they're so good.  Caesar salad is the bomb. The steak wrapped asparagus (forgot the appetizer correct name) is so good it made my eyes roll back in my head. Tortilla soup made my husband sit up and speak if its goodness until the bowl was clean. 

Our server was so friendly she kept bringing us more bread and different salad dressings to try. You can tell she loved working there. She also gave us a free bottle of  Death Valley soda when I told her we just spent three days there. And of course just like many of the other reviewers stated, we were given a free slice of deliciously wonderful cheesecake. I overheard a brief conversation she had with another table when she brought the two gentlemen their free piece of  cheesecake...""what's the catch"" they said...she said, ""no catch, we're just nice"". Indeed they are and it shows in their food their genuine love for their restaurant, product and their customers.

Well according to the lower ratings they obviously haven't. That's why I haven't and won't return. The last 2 meals from this place stick out in my mind because they are DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT than the early days of us visiting what used to be Off The Strip. Fortunately the only thing that remained tasty was the rolled new york. But the taste stopped there. Both my mother's plates from the last two visits (both chicken dishes) were too bland. Salt much? Portions dimished by half from what we received under the previous name. My plates were the shrimp scampi and beef wellington. I remember the welly being dry and falling apart, (definitely not the mass of deliciousness the first time I tried it) but the shrimp scampi was the biggest difference/disappointment. The first time (back with the former name) that had to be the best plate of scampi IN MY LIFE. The garlic, perfectly cooked pasta, shrimp grilled to perfection, the parmesan, OMG. The second time, (under the present name) it was nothing but a lemony, overcooked bland of a mess. No garlic whatsoever, (Seriously?!? No garlic on a scampi dish AT ALL?!? Then its not scampi. Sorry.) and shrimp was rubbery. I was so appalled I had to look around to see if we were in the same establishment. Obviously the flavor left with the old name considering all the low reviews now. Its a damn shame, but this place is no longer on our list of favs for visiting Vegas. Its just not worth the time or money anymore.",IQ62Iq8LHA9lGD7LyU0nzQ,1,0,2,3jnhpAiyNU3ll0kpb-uFIg

Take a break from the ""chain"" places and the overpriced Las Vegas Strip ... you will be very happy at Zest Bistro!
Come ""home"" to a great meal and the friendliest folks in the business! When you walk into Zest, you know you've arrived at a special place. There is no better service in the city than what you'll experience with Donna - she's the best! You will be pleasantly surprised by Donna's upbeat and happy to see you hospitality - martinis - lemon drops - raspberry - always perfectly crafted. Jessie backs up the bar with a friendly smile and an aim to please attitude and makes an amazing Sangria. The wine by the glass menu is impressive - many favorites!
The expansive menu offerings cover all the bases, without compromising any one item. Gourmet Italian seafood entrees, traditional but not ordinary lasagna (amazing!), Happy Hour specials, pizza and flatbreads, chicken dishes, chops and steaks ... the best Caesar salad dressing (we try to remember to take an order of dressing home - it's that good!).
Save room for cheesecake!

The restaurant is located...you guessed right...off the strip.  About a 10-15 mins drive or $80 taxi ride (round trip) from the Strip.  Your amazing dinning experience starts when you walk in to the counter in front of the open kitchen.  You can order from the menu on the board overhead or next to you, or Tom can help you.  Then, find a seat at the tables or sit by the bar and let the great food comes to you.  I don't think you can order anything wrong from them.  The food is very well prepared--just real food as its namesake.  The wine list and the beer variety are very extensive for the restaurant of its size.  There are 2 deserts offered--cheesecake and rice pudding.  I had the cheesecake and it was the BEST ever, even on full stomach.  It was creamy and light---perfect ending to a perfect meal.

I didn't mention anything about service.  I didn't feel like I was being served--I felt like I was having dinner in my friends' kitchen table.  If I live in Vegas, Off The Strip-Just Real Food would be my restaurant of choice for our monthly gathering.

Walking into the restaurant, there's no dedicated hostess, hostess stand, so you walk in lost. While the other patrons of the restaurant just look at you awkwardly smiling. I was greeted by a nice random guy in a tshirt and hat talking to some of his friends at the bar. I'm going to assume he's the owner/manager.
Once my party was there, we were sat at picnic folding tables which means if you're sitting at the end, your feet have no where to go. The service was a mix of okay and terrible. Our server was a loud,
 exciting, bald gentlemen who did a good job with being attentive to our needs. When he got to me, I ordered the Beef Wellington because I've been told how amazing it is by my friends and by him. I asked, because it doesn't say on the menu, if the potatoes that come with this dish have pork/bacon in them because I religiously don't eat pork. He said they do, and he'll sub for something else. When I got my meal, I received a double order of zucchini and my beef Wellington. I said, no biggie, I had enough bread anyways. Half way through my first piece of ""Medium-Well"" Wellington (ordered Medium) I tasted bacon. So I asked our server, is there bacon in the Wellington? He said he doesn't know. But he'll find out. Shocking he doesn't know the proteins in a single dish that's the most expensive thing on the menu. He came back very sorry saying, yes, there is bacon in Wellington. He apologized and apologized and said he'll take it off the check. I decided not to reorder, and eat of my friends' plates. When we got the check, the Wellington was still on my bill. I'm not one to argue about paying, but that's ridiculous. The server screwed up when he was well aware of what I couldn't eat, the owner screwed up by not putting this on the menu, and it totally ruined this high expectation restaurant for me. I wasn't looking for a free meal, but with that kind of mess up, I'm shocked that this restaurant didn't take it upon themselves to do the right thing and hold themselves accountable for their own mistake.

They seemed very busy so I sat around and waited, they seemed very disorganzied with the way the orders are placed. The two people who were running things didn't seem to commincate very well. 

#2 experience,
Very different, getting ready to fly home to California. Decided to grab a bite before my flight we sat at the bar, drinking beers waiting for our yummy italian dishes to come out. The bartender was such a character, he was witty and gave us alot to talk about which really made my night. And he gave us beer for free, what a chill dude. 

I really like Off The Strip. 

It's been nothing but excellent. I always order the same thing because I'm so happy I found my perfect meal. Spaghetti with Sausage and Softball Meatball, Bacon wrapped Filet Mignon, and the house salad comes for free. Cheesecake is a must for dessert, and believe me I'm very, very, very picky about cheesecake. It's good enough to cheat on a diet for!

I ordered creme brulee french toast and I've had this before and really doubted it could be found somewhere else and they blew the other restaurant out of the water!! It was great tasted exactly like creme brulee!! But I would recommend getting the maple syrup on the side it can get too sweet. But I loved it and I loved the price it cost $7.50!!! And as usual we were greeted with a warm good morning and offered free drinks I got my fill of mimosas!! Yummmm!!

My cousin may start working there that might be even better!! Great place a must try don't judge a restaurant by it's strip mall location!! 

Some Negative: it's in Vegas and the pasta is too good to resist I may be a fat whale glad it's in Vegas then!!",SuxGbnuoWtL3kGF1CrF3jw,0,0,5,UJFsZxFZzQqauD_G7gre1A

I agree with many reviews stating the overuse of garlic. Just a bit too much for my taste. Garlic has its place but too much isn't a good thing. Gravy seemed very salty. I'll try it again maybe the chicken parmigiana.,3NW_sfFhRFxxmo3x4P7Dig,0,0,3,K3UdEbi8TzmfCB5VwnE3PQ

We had a large party, so we were able to try out a decent chunk of the menu.  Where this place really stands out is their steak (the ribeye was amazing!) and cheesecake.  This is quite possibly the best cheesecake in Vegas.  The calamari was really good as well, the sauce is what does it.  

Atmosphere is fairly plain, bar type.  For the price of the food, I was expecting a more comfortable, upscale bistro. 

All in all -  Food was delicious.  Atmosphere was unimpressive. Price was higher than expected. Most entrees were in the $30 range.",zHleq9YNYwy_n8Mgnf2eaw,1,0,4,jqYg5qKssFzZzTh6YhLXjQ

Back in December it was my dad, Sister, best friend and myself. I remember my best friend having the spaghetti and meatballs and I had the ""wit calzone"" I remember it not being so great. To be fair I don't remember why exactly but I was thoroughly underwhelmed with our food. 

Tonight Dad and I went again. Dad had the ribeye with house salad and I had the gnocchi Ragu with Caesar salad and we shared a meatball as an appetizer.  The meatballs are HUGE, pretty good and have a slight spice to them. Overall delicious. I can't speak for dads meal. My gnocchi were pretty mushy. I usually don't order gnocchi since it can frequently be ""wall paper paste."" It wasn't terrible, I ate my whole plate, but I was less than thrilled. The sauce and sausage was delicious and probably why I finished my plate. 

The service was great and they were quick to refill my water and iced tea right away. At the end of the meal Dad said ""this place is a pretty solid spot."" So he likes it. But I told him I wasn't thrilled with it and that I felt it was sub par. I can't speak for the pricing since Dad always picks up the tab.

If you stand waiting for someone to seat you, you end up standing right over another table.  So I guess there is no one to seat you, which is how we ended up at the bar.

I head to Vegas roughly once a month for whether it be for business or pleasure, and my girlfriend and I decided to do something different than we are completely used to... Which was to eat away from all the casinos and the strip.  She left it up to me to find something, and I had no idea where to go.  I decided to YELP where my next dinner was going to be, and I came up with this place.  

Upon entering the complex, you have this feeling of,""Really?!? THIS PLACE is rated this high? There must be a mistake.""  It was getting late, and we were starving.  We went in.  

The atmosphere was perfect for a ""date-night.""  There's a bar that's social on the right, and there were tables intimate enough on the left.  The view into the kitchen also sets this place apart.

I ordered the Pork Chops, and the girlfriend ordered the Liguine with Clams.  We paired that with a Russian River Pinot, and finished it their homemade Cheesecake.  The food was delicious; flavor and taste in EVERY bite.

All in all, an Amazing night.  We ended up speaking to Billy, and we found out we are from the same area in San Francisco.  Billy and the staff were awesome, polite, and top-notch in terms of overall class.

My wife's chicken dish was HUGE! A huge chicken breast fried to perfection covered in cheese on top of a bed of angel hair pasta. The sauce hot hot and full of flavor. 
The meatloaf was very tender and had different layers of flavor. I was a little disappointed with the mashed potatoes. They were instant potatoes. The same type I make at home. I like them, I just have higher expectation from a restaurant that serves amazing calamari. The gravy over the meatloaf tasted like it was from a package as well.

The food has been consistently good, after the expansion, service was a bit iffy but it seems they have pulled it together. These happen to be a few of my favorites:

1. Really Trashy ""Garbage"" Salad, mixed greens, salami, Provolone cheese, shrimp, capers, hearts of palm, cherry peppers, and mushrooms in balsamic vinaigrette & a big mound of bleu cheese crumbles. Hand down BEST vinaigrette I've had.

2. Spaghetti Squash over Pasta, spaghetti squash with fresh Rroma tomatoes, garlic,
onions, basil and Parmesan cheese on spaghetti. 

3. Chicken & Artichokes (this is my favorite protein dish)

4.Chicken Tristina, A breast of chicken stuffed with grilled vegetables and mozzarella cheese on penne aglio olio con broccoli. 

5. Beef Wellington, this blows Smith & Wollensky away, can't even touch it.

6. Lobster Ravioli. Need I say more?

I will say that the server was courteous and nice, but food and pricing was a different story. First off, the wedge salad was actually made with a half head of cabbage, to remake it took approximately 12 minutes. Second we ordered 2 ""Mother of all burgers"" which apparently for $12 don't include any toppings. When ordered the server stated, ""want those loaded?"" To which we answered, ""yes."" Which actually turned out to mean that they add on $8 in toppings turning it into a $20 burger. Not worth your time, drive north 3 minutes to Distill.

So, I've received two responses to this review which I will post below. Just to clarify the prices may be stated on the menu and I'm not disputing that. However, when you order something and the server says, ""Loaded? Do you want everything on that?"" I think most reasonable people assume they're not going to get a 60% up charge. And as for quality, it was ok, not great, not bad by any means. Anyhow, I'll let you all judge based on employee responses.",l0rZgNFwOzoq8pUkaIWvYg,21,4,1,eBZRNm-EPW9558bujgO05g

Incredible, there were no fresh clams, just bits of clams probably from a can, and not enough garlic to bother a vampire.

4072606,2010-01-23,1,PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ,"So i guess i fall into the group of people wo just recently went and couldnt figure out what all the hype was. My expectations were also set high by the reviews that i have read, not to mention the fact that i expect an experience when i dine out since i am paying for a meal out. 
Upon arrival i was wondering if i was in the right place, as the strip mall location wasnt what threw me off but more the way the place felt when i entered through the door. Tv's on the walls with the football game on, with a chalkboard menu on the wall above the kitchen area and only a dining room of 8 tables with not even a table cloth on the table. I dont know about you guys but if im spending $20+ a plate for a dinner i dont need to feel like im eating at a tavern. People actually leave the stip to come to this place? Okay enough about the location. 
This great service that everybody was talking about... where was it? I contacted the restaurant previously because i wanted to see if lasagna was ever on the menu as a daily special since this is something that i really like to order when im out. This was something that was made available which i was pleased with, no doubt. After that bit of service i had nothing else of the sort that was welcoming or made me feel as if i absolutely had to come back because this restaurant was on the top of its game on service. My server was a young man who although didnt do a bad job, didnt do anything extrodinary that made me want to return as honestly this is a big deal to me when i dine out. If the service is on point and welcoming chances are i will return. 
Now the food... the pre-dinner bread or lack there of. Was brought out a small bowl with 5 slivers (yes 1/8 inch slivers of a hard baguette as bread felt more like it was croutons for my overly dressed salad, which wasnt a bad house salad but just too heavily drenched in dressing. On to my lasagna which when it came out was VERY small which i felt, alright if this is making up in taste for what it lacks in portion ill be okay. Yeah, that wasnt the case my noodles were overcooked where it had to be cut with a knife. The sauce was just okay and the only nice part about it that differed from my own that i make at home was that Italian sausage was used in place of ground beef which im a fan of. But i still stopped for a snack on the way home because i was still hungry after my meal because my portion was lacking. 
I was looking for a place to replace my Italian restaurant that was recently closed for remodel at the Monte Carlo Casino, it was called the Market City Caffe. This was a place where the service was second to none, the food was excellent and the price points were right in line with what Off the Strip is offering. BUT i always left satisfied, always felt like they appreciated my business and i enjoyed my dining experience. For anybody visiting Vegas and thinks they should take the drive, save your time and effort and dine ON THE STRIP as its not worth the drive.",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,2,1,2,m2FVOnzIO2ZPokUeaIpO9g

You do need a car to get there from the strip.  We are staying at the south end of the strip, so it was about a 10 minute drive - well worth it!  We went on a Monday evening and were seated immediately.  I was happy right away as my favorite wine was on the menu, which is unusual.  I started with the wedge salad (it was a special that day).  It was great!  So many wedge salads come with half a head of lettuce, a few bacon bits thrown on and some cheap nasty bleu cheese - not this one!  The lettuce wedge was the perfect size - not too big.  The bacon was freshly cooked, the dressing wonderful, and the presentation lovely with sliced tomatoes and green onions.  My husband had the house salad and he said it was good.  For dinner, I had the scampi stuffed chicken.  It was served over angel hair pasta with some kind of wonderful balsamic cream sauce.  I wanted to lick the plate, the sauce was so good.  The chicken was delicious - it looked like a plain chicken breast, but inside - the most delicious shrimp scampi (how did they get it in there?!).  My husband had the rigatoni bolognese; he added on the ""softball"" meatball.  Our daughter plays softball - he had to have it.  It really is a softball-sized meatball.  He was very happy with his food as well.  I did taste his rigatoni, and it was good (I preferred my own meal, however).  For dessert we had to try the famous cheesecake and it was excellent.  I enjoyed every bite!  Caution - it was quite rich, and the slice was big.  Easily shared between two.  

The atmosphere is casual and comfortable.  No fancy dress required, which I love!  Donna was our server, and she was great!  So friendly and gave me good recommendations and advice.  We enjoyed talking with her for a moment at the end of our meal.  The service from everyone was excellent - timed perfectly, drinks were refilled quickly.  We did not feel rushed, which I very much appreciated.

If you're in Vegas with a car, definitely go.  Better food than you'll find on the strip at a much better value!",wqbvzgUjdiYKQ3LRxE5WSg,0,0,4,unN8T5YVijdJmSnIJZzowg

My shrimp scampi was tasty yet i also have to say it was super garlicy. Seems as if they just use way too much garlic.

My husband and I went by this restaurant last night to try some of their cheesecake that we heard 'Is To Die For!'
We walked in and were greeted by the friendly bartender who told us for take out just go to the back where the cash register was and they could help us with our order.  
First off, the ambiance for this place is really nothing to write home about and is very boring.  So we weren't impressed with that aspect of it. Like I said before, the bartender was nice, but I can't say the same for the guy at the cash register!
He was rude.  No greeting, no smile, and seemed bothered that we were only ordering the Cheesecake to go.  We even told him that we heard that the cheesecake was 'To Die For', and he didn't even blink.....he took our payment and said, 'It'll be up in a minute'......
I wanted to come back at another time and try and entree or more, but not now.
Service is a HUGE part of a business, and the service here made this customer not want to ever come back to this place again. We also will not be recommending this place to any of our friends or family.....

We had calamari (tasty)

He never brought us the complementary bread until I asked for it since I noticed all the other tables had bread.

4263362,2014-11-30,0,PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ,"I took my father here for his birthday dinner. It is located in the Southern Highlands Shopping Center, close to my favorite tapas joint, Barcelona. We did our homework prior, perusing the menu beforehand. My parents and I were very excited.

From outward appearance, it doesn't look like much. The same goes for the interior. It isn't a fancy place and most people were dressed casually. There is a bar to the right and the dining area is to the left, with basic tables with tablecloths. A good sign is a packed house on a Thursday night at 7pm. We had just missed Happy Hour, unfortunately.

We were seated at a 4-person table in the corner. We had just settled in and were immediately greeted by our sever, Jesse. He was warm and jovial, already making us laugh as he took our drink order: Martini for my dad, Sangria for my mom, and a Cucumber Martini for me. The drinks were one of the things that were basic. Nothing special here.

After looking at the menu, we found more things we wanted to try. We started off with an appetizer: The Rolled New York. It was the perfect amuse bouche. The description, Choice Black Angus New York Strip cut thin and wrapped around grilled asparagus and provolone with basil and sun-dried tomatoes. Dressed with a Marsala mushroom sauce, was exactly that. I don't like steak and I enjoyed this.

For my entree, I got the Orange Roughy Franchese. Per description, 
Orange Roughy lightly floured and pan fried with white wine and shallots. Presented with lemon butter sauce over angel hair pasta. I had never had this fish before. It was cooked perfectly, flaky, and light. The sauce was delicious. An abundance of pasta with a great portion of the fish.

My mom got the Lobster Ravioli. Per description, Ravioli stuffed with lobster dressed with mushrooms and asparagus in a sauce of red ripe tomatoes, cream and shallots infused with vodka. One of the better ones I have tried. I good amount of lobster per portion. A very nice sauce complementing the pasta. She enjoyed her choice very much.

The birthday boy was excited to try the French Pork Chops. Per description, Grilled and baked pork chops topped with cream, bacon, mushroom, and wilted onion over mashed potato. I am so happy that my father absolutely loved his entree. He couldn't stop raving over it. He is difficult to please and had zero complaints. The piece I tried was so good. I agreed with him that he had the best entree amongst the 3 of us.

They are served with a side salad, a choice of house (lettuce mix with cucumbers and tomatoes in a balsamic vinigarette) or Caesar salad. Basic, nothing special here. Also were given bread (sliced italian bread) and butter. Again, basic, as it sounds.

Our server checked in with us throughout the meal. It was the perfect amount and he came to us quickly for drink refills. His only added to the wonderful dining experience. My dad loves to joke around and he was able to make us all laugh. 

The kicker at the end was the slice of cheesecake that was brought out with a candle for my dad. I didn't have to ask for it and it was a sweet surprise for my dad. The cheesecake itself was top notch. Beats Cheesecake Factory's Original (plain) Cheesecake. You can tell that it is made inhouse. Cheesecake is my father's favorite dessert. It was the perfect ending to a near perfect dining experience.

At the end of the evening, the owner approached us to ask about our meal. He was gracious, inviting us back to his establishment.

The overall dining experience was an A+ in my book. The prices were reasonable to me. However, I am use to L.A.'s exorbitant restaurant prices, so take my opinion as you will. To the casual diner, yes, this place is a tad pricey. However, you do get what you paid for. 

We are looking forward to taking my brother and his girlfriend the next time they come to visit. A dining gem in a shopping center. A great local business to support.",1N4z5Okxbl9Bz6Min-ZYTQ,6,3,5,VLMl_en9vE6n73A6yjzTCA

The Wellington is superb and the spaghetti with softball meatballs is fantastic (especially for a to-go order since it's awesome the next day, too). Everyone comes out to say hi to our dog Bailey when we get food to go and it gives Off the Strip a community feeling. And for people wondering about the price: everything is worth more than every penny. The Wellington is the best one you will ever get for that price. And if you are on a budget, the meatloaf is inexpensive, filling, and super tasty. Or you can do your own meal out of some of the appetizers (shrimp scampi is great for a lighter dinner portion and the ribs are a meal).

4382286,2016-01-03,0,PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ,"We dined here for NYE. For NYE there was a special menu so I'll definitely have to come back in the future and try some items from the regular menu as well.

The location is interesting and probably not a location would be easy to stumble upon if you live somewhere other than Southern Highlands. My coworkers highly recommended this spot which is how I learned of this restaurant. Being in a shopping center does mean that there was ample parking and it was a quick walk from the car. 

I wasn't sure what the ambiance would be when looking at the menu versus knowing that it was in a strip shopping center. The menu lends itself to a fancier setting, but inside the restaurant is casual. To me it felt similar to the feel of a casual pizza spot. The good news is that you don't have to get dressed up for good food here.

We started with Crab Cakes and Short Rib Ravioli. The Crab Cakes were full of crab and well seasoned. The sauce on the crab cakes paired well with the crab flavor. Our waitress told us that these are made in house. The Short Rib Ravioli is made outside of the restaurant, but was delicious as well. The gravy like sauce on top paired well with short rib and the ravioli was a nice texture. We were also brought bread which was unremarkable and I'm not sure why they even bother serving it. It just didn't seem to be in line with the quality of the food here.

For the salad course we had a Greek Salad and a Wedge Salad. The Wedge Salad was good, but pretty standard. The Greek salad was a jazzed up version of the standard Greek Salad with plenty of feta and balsamic vinegar dressing.

For entrees we went with the Seafood Linguine Fra-Diablo and Prime Rib. For sides we opted for the Truffle Mac & Cheese and the Potato Au Gratin. The entrees and sides were all very generous portions. My husband enjoyed his seafood dish and the sauce on top. My prime rib was moist and had a nice herb flavor on the outside. The rarer parts had the best flavor. The Potato Au Gratin flavor was okay, but it was a bit dry and not the highlight. The Truffle Mac & Cheese was amazing. The truffle flavor was the perfect amount and I could eat this as an entrée. Loved this side!

Dessert was NY Cheesecake and Tiramisu. The NY Cheesecake is prepared in house and was very good. NY Cheesecake has a lovely, rich flavor. The chocolate on the side was delicious and could be enjoyed alone. The Tiramisu was probably the best I've ever had. It had more of an alcohol flavor than other tiramisus I've had, but it was done in a way that really enhanced the sweet instead of overpowering it.

The service was very good. My husband commented that he thought the service was up there with some of the best service we've had in town. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and gave us a lot of good information about the food. They were also efficient at clearing dirty dishes and refilling drinks. 

They also offer take-out which is nice. We'll definitely be back to try some of the usual menu items or at least to grab some take-out for a night at home.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,2,0,4,MzuDTvKGjBlu-ATWm7hyaA

The atmosphere is comfortable, cozy, & modern. The staff are very welcoming! Here is what we ordered:

Appetizer: 
Rolled NY - The steak was cooked perfectly with a great Marsala Sauce.

Salads: 
Caesar - sauce is not over powering with a hint of garlic, very good!
House - very fresh and tasty

Entree: 
Rigatoni alla Vodka w/ chicken - The sauce is better than Brio's Pasta alla Vodka. I could taste the tomatoes and the cream is not overwhelming. I asked to add chicken. I don't recommend it, because the pasta is good by itself. My chicken was on the salty side.

Chicken Tristina - Very delicious! the chicken was juicy and the sauce was light and fresh, a great compliment to the veggies and chicken. 

Did not have any desert because we were so full! The portions are generous. Everything tastes home-made and made daily. Staff appreciate's your business. I'd give it a 5 star if my chicken wasn't as salty. I'd come here again and recommend it to a friend.",EA97sinOPHndb-mOHgikZg,1,0,4,RSele-ho_c4ihcC3y3HqyA

The first time, they both us and the second time, we returned the favor and brought another couple. Both visits were very pleasant. The first time had to be 1-2 years ago because it was before the expansions, which are very nice! Anyway, the food is great, but nothing really stands out as spectacular. 

On our last visit, we started with the garlic bread as an appetizer. Our server warned us that it was very garlicky, which we appreciated, but didn't mind and it was good. Something you would make at home on Spaghetti Night. We all ordered Caesar salads with our entrees and were, again, warned of its extreme garlic nature. Even with the forewarning, it didn't prepare me. It was really, really, REALLY overwhelming and as much I truly love garlic, I couldn't even finish the small salad. It was way too much. Next time, I'll order the dressing on the side. For entrees, I had the Spaghetti alle Vongole, one of my pasta favorites and Italian restaurant go-to menu items. The garlic wasn't as overwhelming in this dish, but certainly strong (I wasn't warned this time). The clams were chopped up and muddled with the large slices of garlic - I am not a fan of this preparation (I'd prefer the clam still in their shells). However, it was still very tasty and I did enjoy my dinner. 

Someone in our party had an issue with their entree and the situation was handled very awkwardly. The server removed the dish, but didn't mention anything else about it. It seemed more like a misunderstanding and in the end, I felt it was handled well with removing the entree from our bill and delivering a complimentary slice of their housemade NY-style cheesecake. If anything brings me back to the restaurant, it would be this magnificent cheesecake (and the service!). It is SOOO delicious. It's served with caramel, chocolate, and strawberry sauce and it's just perfect. The cake itself is soft, moist, and not dense like most cheesecakes, the crust was scrumptious, and the side sauces added your own flair per bite! 

Anyway, service was wonderful and I love the casual, but elegant atmosphere. It's also great to not have to go anywhere near The Strip (haha)! Oh, and we also really enjoyed their Riesling selection (Starling Castle).",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,4,1,3,FGul2SoSTxkovTsHBAolMw

We arrived there and I ordered the Sea Bass and my husband, the pork chops.  Both entrees came with a green salad with balsamic vinaigrette or Caesar salad - both salad dressings were home made.
Both the entrees and salads were delicious.  The pork chops were crusted after marinated in papaya and cherry wine which made then very tender.  Pan fried peppers and mushrooms covered the chops. The sea bass was in a white wine sauce with sauteed cabbage/peppers/carrots which was an odd combination but very tasty!  The potatoes on both entrees were seasoned, crusted and not overbearing.
The very creamy cheesecake was a great ending!  I also loved the crusty bread.

OTS is located in a mini mall in the back of a large parking area, with other stores and shops.  When you walk in, there is a nice bar to the right, which looks like it is bigger than the dining area. TV's everywhere.  In fact, if I lived in the area, I would frequent this place often.  It is simply a very nice place.

Jack walks up and takes my drink order and introduces himself.  We have a nice talk, he tells me he is originally from the North Hollywood, CA area, near my home. I ordered by taking my cue from their specials menu.  I went with the Lobster and Pasta, linquini.  This thing was so freaking good.  Some of the best lobster I have ever had.  Succulent lobster and the pasta was just right.  He brought me bread that I filled up on, which made it difficult to finish my meal.  

So I am sitting there letting my stomach recover, watching a ball game or two, and Jack presents me with a large piece of cheesecake, on the house.  I was stunned.  And yes, this cheesecake was absolutely delicious and yes, some of the best I have ever had.  Great taste, great crust on the bottom.  Wow.

I told Jack that, yes, the food was great, the service was great and the place was nice.  But better than anything, I told him he made me feel like a friend.

Don't expect to get free cheesecake when you go here. But expect great food, great service and great people.  

He asked me to tell my friends.  Well, I consider my fellow Yelpers to be my friends.  So I am telling you all, go here.  It is a little off the beaten path.  But worth it.

Certainly not the popular way of taking in all the reviews but constant raves have far too often set me up for disappointment.  In the case of Off The Strip, I wanted to know why the few bad reviews were written.

Having read the reviews, mostly bad, I decided to give Off The Strip a try because it was basically walking distance from our house.  I have to say that I really didn't share ANY of the bad opinions that have been shared here.

I and my family loved the food, environment (reminded us of authentic family owned Italian restaurants back home in NY) and the service.  Jack was incredibly attentive and inviting and was so gracious to invite us back to the restaurant even after the kitchen is closed to enjoy wine and music.

Being that we are from NY, good Italian is near and dear to our hearts.  Especially a good creamy vodka sauce and fried calamari.  The vodka sauce is quite possibly the best I have outside of Neo Posto and the now close Rigatoni, both in NY.  The calamari was light and flavorful, and everything we look for in that appetizer.  All the dishes around were something to savor and truly enjoy, not just satisfy.

Now if you have read this far you might be wondering why I did not give Off The Strip a perfect 5 stars.  My one issue about the restaurant was the prices.  The prices as they are, are by no means over the top or unreasonable.  But, they are at a level that makes Off The Strip more an indulgence eatery over a frequent dinner spot.  The food was just as good as I remembered back in NY, but the prices were $5 - $10 more.

I really like Off The Strip and will definitely be heading back again.  Unfortunately it won't be as often as we would like.",qQC7w7AEGJAsYAfzDip24w,3,0,4,auNz4EnGxiK5_nWQJ3jLPA

I would recommend this place to people looking for a nicer, going out kind of restaurant. It's not the casual Sunday Dinner place we were expecting from a strip mall restaurant. 

Service - EXCELLENT!! Our server was attentive, The manager stopped by a few times to say hello and check on us. Our soda never went empty. 

Food - Decent, but everything we ordered had WAY too much garlic. We ordered the pesto garlic bread, and it came out more like a pizza - delish (we expected this to have garlic obviously). We both got caesar salads - too much raw garlic in the dressing, so much that it burned a little. I got the Chicken Saltimboca - again too much garlic, and too much salt. Made me drink a lot more water. It wasn't horrible, but I would have liked a lighter hand. My man got the Chicken Parm, and he said the sauce had too much garlic as well. We left with AWFUL breath, and we both are the kind of people that normally LOVE garlic, so it was kinda weird. 

Price - A tad overpriced. For an appetizer (the cheapest one they had), and 2 entrees, and 2 sodas (no alcohol) our final bill was $80 (with tip). WAY too much in my opinion for a strip mall restaurant. The food was good, but should have been closer to $14-16 instead of the $19-22 we paid. They also had lamb, and steak for $32+!! Was expecting to pay closer to $50, so it was a little bit of a let down. 

We will probably be back, but maybe only when we feel like splurging. Southern Highlands really needs a good all american restaurant with decent pricing that can be a regular spot. Was hoping that this would be it, but it's definitely not.",6gb0T4_MngSXukRUbIMEfQ,5,2,3,5m6X3EGtiu3rr19mKiT_Uw

Certainly a great find and has so much to offer. Called in 20 minutes before closing and they agreed to cook food for pick-up. (Missed the delivery cut-off time). One of the owners greeted us and was really nice. The place had a cool vibe, w/tv and great music. Wish we could have stayed to dine-in.

Ordered: 
Grilled Asparagus - was cooked just right. Still had a crispness to it, and seasoned perfectly. 

Crab Cakes - shredded crab NOT lump crab. They could have used a bit more flavor, but they decent in size. Just didn't have the tastiness for me to  rave about it. 

Scampi Stuffed Chicken-  OMG!!! So, the best of 3 worlds. Pasta, chicken, and shrimp. Very tasty, cooked to perfection, and juicy. Only downside was that in the take-out order it was one small stuffec chicken and an entire tray of paste. Not certain if dine-in would have given more or appeared to be balanced in portion. 

Grilled Salmon - Cooked just right. Has a nice zesty kick on a bed of rice. Very tasty.

Only bad part was the salad. Caesar salad was just lettuce with some parm. tossed on-top, with side dressing. It came with croutons, but they were a burnt.

Can't explain the bad reviews left about this restaurant, except you can't please em all. Prices were a little high especially for the appetizers, but the food was worth it, portions were not too big which just lead us to believe they were using good quality food and not just trying to fill the plate up. The house ceasar salad was good only if yoiu like that real strong almost spicy garlic flavor, which I do but may be a bit too much for some.

This is my new Davio's! anyone of my friends from Seal Beach will appreciate that remark that was my go to for birthdays, anniversaries and always New Years Eve. I can see this place being my go to for all that and more.
We took my Mom here for her birthday which was a risk this woman is one of the fussiest most difficult restaurant patrons on the planet 
So lets begin the staff whether waiter, bus person, bar staff, or other employee each greeted us at some point in time, we were made to feel like VIP's they each take a moment to listen to you, and ask if is your first time, ask how the food was, ask if you are enjoying the experience they listen in earnest and become part of your party getting to know you. This is important because it shows they value their clientele, which is something you don't find everyday. 
The food was stellar, even the house dressing on the salad was creamy and done just right, good fresh chewy bread accompanied the salad that and a glass a wine and I am a happy camper! But wait there is more I had the ""special"" French style pork chops oh my they were mouth watering tasty (don't know if that is a real word). Mom had Chicken and artichoke hearts also bursting with rich savory goodness, my sister had Orange Roughy (which I don't see on enough menus) the portion was huge and her hubby had the salmon which was cooked to perfection.
And before we could even consider desert we were presented with a complimentary piece of that fabulous New York Style cheesecake (yes the rumor is true) it is gratis for first timers! and that truly is the icing on the cake...best cheesecake I believe I have had, supple creamy and tantalizing to the tongue.

5335464,2014-07-03,1,PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ,"This restaurant receives a lot of rave reviews from locals, but I honestly feel it's a bit overrated. Sure, the menu features some pretty good food, but most of the items seem overpriced considering this spot's location, interior, and decor. I read a review that said the food at ""Off the Strip"" should cost 20% less than it does and I would have to agree with that assessment.

For those who want to play devil's advocate, yes, the dishes here would definitely cost significantly more at a restaurant on the Strip (and I would probably have no problem paying it). But this spot is ""off the Strip,"" remember? 

Even a side of asparagus (which comes with 6 or 7 little pieces) costs $8 here! I know asparagus is expensive nowadays, but that is ridiculous... If I'm going to pay that much $ for that little asparagus, I'd better be overlooking the Bellagio fountains or the Wynn water feature -- not a strip mall parking lot...

I honestly believe this place is only popular because there are so few decent restaurant options for Southern Highlands residents in the immediate area. The staff also does a pretty good job of making their guests feel really welcome here. In fact, according to multiple people I know, ""Off The Strip"" usually offers a free piece of cheesecake if the waiter finds out it's your first time dining there.

I would recommend this restaurant if you live nearby or you're visiting some friends in Southern Highlands, but I would steer you away if you live on the other side of town or you're a tourist visiting Vegas.

Service: Simply amazing. The waitresses were all smiles and very accommodating. I had several requests for my dish and they got them perfect. Both waitresses were always checking in on us and I thought it was great how they supported each other.  Nothing fell through the cracks!

Ambiance. Casual and hip, yet romantic. Lots of energy in the place and you could see others were enjoying their conversations sitting around their rustic wooden tables and eating great food. 

Food (appetizers). The mussels oreganata are out of this world. I truly believe you would be hard pressed to find a more flavorful dish anywhere in town. The textures and flavors in this dish are very unique...you will love them. The sweet chili and bacon prawns were great but a little too sweet and spicy for my taste.

Food (entrees). I was really excited for my beef wellington but unfortunately it was average. The pastry around it was thick and the sauce tasted like it came out of an instant gravy packet :(  The scampi stuffed chicken pasta was very good and the balsamic vodka sauce was incredibly flavorful.

Price. For a casual dinner for two, $150 was a tad expensive for my taste. Do not get me wrong, the food is great but I do not think charging around the same amount as some of the high end restaurants on the strip entices customers to visit as often as they like. It their prices were a bit less expensive, I would definitely visit quite often.

 I ordered the Beef Wellington medium rare.

Bartender made no eye contact for 10 minutes despite walking back and forth several times serving the already eating diners.  

We then saw 3 ladies walk in who also were told to wait at the bar til their table was ready.  So in the ten minutes we were at the bar, those girls who arrived after us were served drinks and handed menus, bar back walked past the bartender who saw we were sitting there awkwardly asked us if we needed anything, told him we were waiting for a table, brought us water, we asked barback for 2 shots honey jack, he told the bartender and went to do his other duties.  So ten minutes after that i watch the bartender make 6 drinks for a waitress, close out the 3 ladies tab AS THE WAITER SAT THEM TO A TABLE, (mind you they came in about 10 minutes after us), still no shots we ordered or eye contact from bartender as he passed us a dozen more times.   So 30 MINUTES LATER, our waiter skipped us and gave away our table, bartender ignores us, 2 different waiters forgets about us, shots ordered forgotten about, we look around for assistance, bartender deems not important to remind staff we've been waiting for a table.

Everything on the menu was also healthy-ish or on the healthy side for the most part. 

Service: Our server was very friendly and polite. He checked on us within reasonable times where we were never without water or anything we needed. The bartending staff was also super friendly. We liked that there were regulars at the bar and at tables, showing that this restaurant has a neighborhood-friendly following.

Atmosphere: Zest is a very nice restaurant with a pizza pickup on the other side. I like that each part of the restaurant is dedicated and split up nicely. The tables were of various sizes, showing there's room for a small to larger party.

We will be back! It's a great break from the usual chain restaurants and gives a balance of a laid-back feel with high quality food.",ihTu74HkXnKGuY5v_Z8b0g,4,0,5,sZTIR7uk0a7CGSXBdudAHA

Here's the story:  we got to the restaurant, which we actually encountered when we went to the tapas place next store, sat at the bar, ordered drinks :) life was good.  Lots of steel metal and wood accents in here and the motif is just wonderful.

They have TV's at the bar so that made my ADD self happy.  There was maybe 3 couples seated at the bar. Glanced over the menu. Couple things they have really healthy meals like pork chops and kale, salmon and brown rice, grilled chicken and veggies on their Summer menu priced at $15.95.  They have an extensive pasta list, as well as other Italian favorites.

It's true, when you mention it's your first time eating there they do give you something free!  HOORAY free!  They served us the fried artichoke hearts, yum yum!  I ordered the scampi stuffed chicken breast over pasta and a salad [moderately prices in the low $20 range if I recall]  and my friend ordered [I wish you could tag other Yelpers in your reviews :)] pork chops and kale.

Bread came out-good-white bread and rolls. hard to mess this up!
Salad came out-great--[homemade dressing was very very good]
Artichoke hearts came out-anything free is grrrreat!
My meal came out-was very very good, a little too much oil for me but next time I'll say 'light oil', but enjoyed it all the same!
Friends meal-missing! Where'd it go?  How comes he gets no food???

Friend starts to eat my food too, he's hungry. I'm a sharer, sometimes.  5 mins later we're  told it will be out soon. We keep eating, I pretty much finish my meal, when finally (at least 10 maybe 15 mins later) his meal arrives. Bartender is obviously not happy food is not out so you can see the annoyance on her face. 

We went on a Sunday evening around 830, by the time we left around 10 pm, there was at least 7 couples at the bar.  Apparently, they are open till 11 and have a reverse happy hour!",8QKrhvVqhEkD8xo4E4s0GQ,2,0,4,6X9Tpa_FtQ2_KKjs-VJeig

Seriously though, I'm not sure where all these good reviews are coming from. Really, guys?

In sum: small portions and bland, sub-par quality. It was like a C- in quality at an A+ price point. I wanted to walk out when I saw the menu, but I stuck it out not wanting to be rude to the server, who was very nice. 

The product just fell flat. The sauces and dressing tasted like they came from a can. The lobster tasted like it was very old. None of the vegetables were cooked thoroughly and nothing was fresh.

It didn't help that I had entered the smoky gambling bar on Tropicana of the same name and owners.  We didn't even try the Tropicana one as it did not look very inviting for dining.

This was different.  No gaming, more of a restaurant feel.  We were greated by Megan who was cute, perky, bubbly and friendly and welcomed us warmly.  We were hustled to our seat and she answered all my questions about the menu with a smile, recommending the pork chop special which has been around for several months.  

Megan and the other staff were all friendly and attentive.  We never went without water or one of them asking us how we were doing.  The garlic cheese bread was exactly the way it should be, the scent of garlic arriving ahead of the service as an announcement that the bread was on the way.  

The salads were fresh and the dressing (which they put on the side at my request) was excellent.  Service was fast.  

I had the pork special.  The pork chops were perfectly cooked, the cream sauce had great flavor and the potato pie was excellent.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and we had a nice variety, lamb chops, spaghetti with sausage, chicken.  I regret I didn't try the Wellington (still have never tried Wellington) but it just gives me reason to go back.

At the end the waitress surprised us with a cheesecake slice that was to die for.  It was light, fluffy, with several syrups on the plate to dip.

Atmosphere - a mix between a small wrap around bar and casual dining made it a bit louder than a fine dining place. However I enjoyed it! It seemed like this place was the spot on a Friday night. 

Food - Started with the calamari. It was pretty good. Nothing extremely special here, but did its job or two. I had the lobster ravioli. It was amazing. Very good flavor, could not have asked for much more. Great tomato sauce over it. My girlfriend had the shrimp scampi filled chicken and she loved it, I only had one bite but it was pretty darn good. 
  It was our first time there and they gave us a piece of cheesecake for free! It was some of the best cheesecake I have ever had. They serve it with some strawberries, chocolate, and caramel on the side so that you can sample it. It was amazing.

Price - it was a bit expensive, but I knew this going in. Our meal with a glass of wine and a beer was $78. That was with a free dessert. Not crazy by any means, but not something we could do every week.

Both owners are usually there and they welcome you like you are family (guess their greek and italian genes dont let them act any different) Billy always welcome us with a warm hug.The servers, the bar tenders man..the whole staff is great.

The location is great too if you live in the area. Decoration is simple yet nice. It has an indoor smoking room. yep separated from the rest of the restaurant. You cant even smell a bit of it. which makes it awesome because it caters for both groups (smokers and no smokers)

If you dont feel like getting a table , take a seat at the bar. The girl (totally forgot her name) is awesome and fun . There is no gaming (which im glad for) but an awesome selection of alcohol and beers that she pours quickly right after you order it. No draft beer though

And the food you may ask. Im gonna tell you.. Its DIVINE. Im gonna do you a favor and tell you to order everything on the menu and will dare you to find something not tasty. Thats how much I like this place. IF you dont like something..call me..ill drive there eat it and let you pay for it.

The appetizers have some different takes on known classics. Their calamari, mussels , the rolled new york (a must), the roulade, are some of them that you cant leave without tasting .

The entres..guys be careful because the portions are very generous and packed with awesomeness . I recommend a couple of apps and then one entre to share if you are not a viking/caveman like me.

I think its a cute place, I have no problem w it being in a strip mall. I think its really odd to have a bar AND a bartender when you only serve beer and wine. Our server was nice, but nothing exceptional. We were waiting for another person to join us, so after getting our bread and drinks we were basically ignored until she showed up. I tried to wave down the waiter a couple times to order an appetizer but he just flew by. 
The freshly baked bread was great but like someone else mentioned, it was in sections and some were toasted to sh-t on the outside - basically big croutons. We started w the mussels which were just ok, definitely not worth $15 for 6 mussels w panko on top. It was an excessive wait until we got our salads. I went w the Caesar - awesome dressing w a kick to it.  I got the rigatoni w meatball. Huge portion of pasta and a big meatball for an additional $6. Great dish - pasta al dente, creamy cheesy sauce, meatball was tender and flavorful. Was it worth $25....I guess so? 
I was a little miffed that I wasn't offered a free cheesecake like the majority of yelpers seemed to get, but whatever. I just had coffee instead which when we got the bill I found out was $4. Iced tea was also $4. My fault I guess for not looking at the bevg section, but I think its ridiculous to charge that much for a fountain drink and regular perculated coffee. 
I'll probably be back someday, but I'm really disappointed in the overall experience. Food was good but pricey, service wasn't the best. Even if i didnt walk in w a preconcieved notion of what it would be like, I'd expect a small neighborhood place like that to have great friendly staff. Its nit picky but he didn't even tell us the daily specials which even crappy olive garden does. I meant to ask what French pork chops were but totally forgot by the time he came back.
Too bad it wasn't a better experience because I live close enough to have become a regular, but not based off this visit. I'd prefer to go to stratta for the whole dining experience and a full bar for the same price.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,2,0,3,6jr0BBMVhN-fnjV9GKJTaA

My picky wife couldn't be more pleased with her chicken Parma dinner and the other speciality pasta dishes plates were almost licked cleaned. I had a rib eye and wouldn't share, cause it was so good. The owner then dropped off two complimentary cheese cake desserts. Delicious. What was nice, there was no problem in splitting checks among the couples.

I ordered a beer, none of which they had on draft, and got a skunky relic that I could barely finish. After that, I was too skeptical to order anything to eat, and their food prices sealed the deal there. It is right up the street from me, but I have avoided it since.",-URAJU5BQAM2F1_SNna81g,1,0,2,hG9ckTJFhkrtRFLyGptelA

""Meat Calzone"". They must think bread and cheese is ""meat""
Also ordered pesto garlic bread.

Came in to a quaint space with a full bar and main dining room and a side dining room. Ambient lighting and open-view of the kitchen. I tried to read the menu on the boards above the cashier, but was given menus and greeted with friendly faces. 

Ordered off the specials menu: Pork chops and tortellini Ragu. 

I took a bite of the pork chops and BOY did it satisfy my already ravenous appetite. I took a bite of my tortellini and it all blended so well together. Finished off a hearty conversation with a rasberry ale. 

I'll definitely be coming back to savor more of their delights!",ANLSKvFmCgRMjxtELq70FQ,3,2,5,LHOBPCk_HSTyXvL3Kmo4GA

We usually get Steph (as we did today) as our server, who we love, but on a visit a few weeks back, we had someone different (so sorry I didn't get her name), and she was perfect too. Everyone greets you when you arrive, and sends you off with a smile when you leave. Simply outstanding.

5955607,2014-02-26,0,PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ,"The bachelor of our party wanted beef Wellington and Gordon Ramsey's place wanted $240 min per person charging more than the menu for a fixed menu.   So he found this place.   As we drove for 15 minutes watching the Vegas lights  disappear in the distance our hope faded  for quality.   Especially when we pulled into a strip mall with a McDonalds in it.  
Store front looks like and glass walled sport bar in a strip mall.  Not impressive.   Neither were the tables and chairs.   A few of us were worried, a few other resigned to mediocrity.
But you know what, for the most part  we were delighted.   One of the owners Tom came over and gave us a  long but cool history and menu description.   When he said no beef Wellington left, we all laughed at the groom...but you know what, Tom made it happen.  He talked to the chef and they made 6 of them for the table.
Server Rita was great, especially being her 2nd day there, handling 14 rowdy guys,

My meal - gin and tonics, well made.   Solid, can taste the booze.
App - shrimp wrapped in bacon in an Asian sweet sauce.  Really good, I quite enjoyed
Salad - Caesar - a waste.  $8.50 for a little bit of chopped romaine  lettuce with a weak not Caesar like dressing.   In fact everyone disliked their salads, skip them!
French pork chop - was well done but still super juicy and the sauce was excellent.   Really enjoyed this.   

Guys who had the beef Wellington said ""very good to excellent""

Pros - apps, drinks, main dishes, service
Cons - salad, decor could use some help

Overall we had a great meal and time here.   4 1/2. Stars is a bit more accurate.  The other owner Billy helped us get back to town and the action of Vegas.  

If I find myself in the burbs again, I'll be back.   

Tip - coming from Vegas get a limo for a large party.   Cab might be too pricey,",PrKu-Drp_QpNnBQBBan7kg,2,1,4,Zze4M6vvfDRTMW7sfYz3Ww

The staff is super friendly but doesn't over do it and kiss you ass. I can't stand overly friendly fake servers and here it's real and genuine.  When you walk in, you feel right at home. The food is just AMAZING. Every time we go I try something new and I am never dissapointed. We usually try whatever specials they have on the board for the day and I can not stress enough how great everything is. Anytime I want to have a rich homemade meal paired with a nice glass of wine, you will find me here. We have celebrated two birthdays here, had date nights here and every time the service is great. Try the French style porkshops!! I had them two weeks ago and I am still thinking about them :)

Updated Review: 1/21/16 : I first reviewed this place in 2012 and I gave it 5 stars and I have since been back on numerous occasions for the past 4 years and I still stand by my review. 5 stars all the way :) My husband and I recently had dinner here with my children and extended family and we cant get enough. The staff is incredibly professional and helpful. My server (I forgot her name, dark features, looked a little Italian) convinced me to step out of my comfort zone and order something different. She suggested the beef Strognaoff (which I normally hate) but was soooooo delicious! Thanks again, consistent service and quality food for the past 4 years!",x8lQyx6dKlxD6aIiuZgpiQ,2,1,5,Zc0XnUZyUCOXqNzhMQ0Peg

This place is the real gem of the Southern Highlands plaza.  Even if you don't live in the area, it's worth the drive.  And if you do live in the area and haven't been here yet, what's wrong with you?

I ordered the lobster ravioli, which was just all sorts of savory deliciousness.  The portion was well sized and I ended up with leftovers.  What I should have ordered though was the beef wellington, which my date ordered.  It was sooooooo good.   I'm going to go back just to order that and nothing but that.  It is just moist and flavorful goodness wrapped in a delicate and flaky pastry.

The legendary cheesecake is just as amazing.  I heard that if you let them know it's a special occasion or it's your first time there, they might give you a free slice of cheesecake.  Well, we let them know it was my birthday AND our first time there and BOOM! Free cheesecake.  And it was extraordinary. 

The service was laid back but great.  Our server was really friendly and actually conversed with us beyond the mundane forced waiter-diner conversations.

5984679,2015-10-03,0,PIXl4WvAqjl2w9Lj81zXvQ,"We went here because of all of the good reviews and it was close to home - which is always a plus.  We started with a pesto garlic bread appetizer, which was very tasty.  It was a little on the soggy side, but the flavors were good, so I won't hold that against it.

For entrees, I had the lobster ravioli and my husband had the Burger (M.O.A.B.).  The ravioli was bland.  The dish also came with mushrooms and asparagus which were diced up very tiny and were sparsely sprinkled throughout the dish.  Maybe there were more but whatever was on the dish had been drowned in the Ragu sauce that filled the dish.  The sauce was OK, but it tasted like something that came out of a jar and that kind of put me off about any flavor it had.

My husband had the Mother Of All Burgers with a side of truffle fries.  The burger was overcooked (he asked for it Medium and it was definitely Well Done with no trace of pink left in the meat).  That's not usually something we'd write a bad review about, but the fact that it was served on a baguette was unforgivable.  It made it very difficult to eat.  The bottom of one of the baguettes was split completely in half and had to be held onto until the entire half was eaten lest it all fall apart.  It also made the burger awkward to even bite due to it's enormous composure (maybe it the guts of the bread had been carved to some extent, this may have helped that situation).  

The truffle fries he ordered were out of this world.  They were dusted with a little parmesan cheese and were absolutely delicious.  The Caesar salad that came with my meal was also very good.

I almost want to give this place 3 stars because our waitress was phenomenal.  I wish I could remember her name, but she was really top of the line.  The runner/busboy also did a good job at keeping the drinks full and dishes cleared.  Service is always a big deal to us, but I don't think it'll be enough to prompt us to go back to this place.

EDIT:  My husband saw my review and was upset that I forgot to add his biggest ripoff factor and why he will not bother giving the place a 2nd chance; THEY CHARGE $4 FOR A FOUNTAIN SODA!!!",U8u1jGMpQiFMl5o_ZhOm_g,3,0,2,EoAcIMwcR--enYAh7bB7tA
