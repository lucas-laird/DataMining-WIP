Anthony's started off on the right foot by giving out free slices of pizza, or a whole pie if you were taking it back to the co-workers.  It only got better from there...

Delicious pizza, great fresh toppings, and a quick lunch option downtown!  The french fries are excellent.  There's too much chicken to eat when you order chicken strips.  The lasagna is yummy and the salads look great!

The staff is wonderful, they remember you and your order and the service is always quick even when they're busy.  If you work downtwon the trick is to call in your order and pick it up about 10 minutes later.  They'll let you skip to the front of the line to pay and your pizza will be waiting when you walk in the door.  

My personal favorite = sliced meatballs + onions.  The pizza itself if the perfect balance of excellent cheese and sauce  that isn't too sweet.

So I made a delivery order for a bbq chicken pizza.  When I opened the box all the bbq and chicken were on the sides of the box rather than on the pizza. Just seems like it was probably placed somewhere slanted. So I pretty much had to scrape all the toppings of the box and place them on the pizza just to eat it. 

Also I ordered two bottles of water and never got them but I paid for them. The delivery guy offered to get them for me but why would I want that? So I can wait another 45 mins to get water? No thanks. 

This is disappointing because the pizza is actually good which is why I gave it a 2 star and not an 1 star. However, forgetting things that I paid for and presenting me with a sloppy ass pizza just says a lot about how much you care about your customers.

The wait isn't really their fault because they're always so busy, but I $14 for a salad and a drink is a bit on the expensive side. I think it's because they charge $5 to add chicken.

Anthony's came up and it's literally across the street from the main entrance. Truly has a New Year feel. Several men working their asses off, tossing dough, saucing wings, and making magic happen.

Portions are rather large for wings and fingers, pizza slices are big, but not huge, definitely a 2 slice spot. They offer soups, sandwiches, wings, fingers, and a few other Italian specialties. There is also a daily special as well as several lunch specials.

Not fancy, but serving up good pies, makin' their own ranch, and everything else from scratch. If you're downtown and stuck doing you're civic duty or you've had an unfortunate run in with the law, make this you to-go to spot for a bite.
