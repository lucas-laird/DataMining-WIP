Everyone commented on how great the food was because it is very authentic BBQ. They had sauce on the side for the ribs and that was a big hit too. I loved that they brought everything they needed to set up the food and that they made it look great.",vJOFBUOd02k_JVUe3pWhiA,1,0,5,JUzpjkhtXYCDbvE8j5n8Jg

This is a fast food location and worth the money. Service is great, food is awesome... Try them out and bring a friend! Request the sweet potato fries :)",2TxiHEk8ZVjHSzNozXihyA,0,0,5,atR375wOq6pUAMeJ1EZtRA
