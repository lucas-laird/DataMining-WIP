Even in the busy lunch hour, he took the time to reassure me that my wallet was in good hands and would be shipped directly to me. The very next day, Fed Ex had my wallet for me and it was completely in tact. 
I am so grateful to Esau and the customer who turned my wallet in.

They are rude and seems like they just want you out of the drive thru lane that they almost throw the food at you. Sucks this is the closest Wendy's to my work.

I decided to dine in and was greeted right away. Then witnessed the team work... Nice Hawaiian lady shouted my order out as she took my money and by the time i received my change, my Chili and side salad where already on the tray. The young guy working behind her was on task. 

Took my tray to the condiment area and it was stocked and clean.

1502615,2015-09-03,0,uaBVv3tZJaOd8lfPFInzTA,One star is generous. This dump deserves 0 stars. I go here often sadly because its the closest Wendy's to me. I'm forced to bring back my order multiple times a week for inaccuracy. Management here is ridiculous and doesn't care. Speak English instead of Spanish and you might get  orders out correctly. I got a refund today after attempting to call the restaurant a few times in which they didnt answer.,muh8JTHbJXnr0pu-4FVQ3A,0,0,1,cxUOuGxVqsddKup02V3vzQ

for all the worry that you can't have fast food as well as good food, the wendy's double burger i just housed, put the concern to rest...
the patties were not thin thawed out slices of meat, each layer of beef was thick and juicy and tasted like something you'd cook at home in the backyard with your family and friends..
It was not only filling, it felt clean.

There is one older guy that works there who seems to be there every time I go. He rushes me when I'm ordering to the point where I never get to order everything I want. Then when I get to the window he opens the window and tells me the price, processes my payment, then practically throws my food at me. No, ""hello"" or ""have a nice day"" or any basic greetings that most places give.

2822747,2016-05-09,9,uaBVv3tZJaOd8lfPFInzTA,"Out of convenience, I used to frequent this Wendy's because it's close to my work. I can probably say that this is the worse location I've been to. I went inside once to order my food and noticed that the people dining there weren't the best of people. I'll just drive thru next time, problem solved.Whenever I would pull up to the window, RIGHT as I pulled up, the voice over the intercom says ""What can I get you?"" First of all, can I get a hello at least and second, can I get a minute to look at the menu. The food had issues too. I've had a sandwich with wilted lettuce. I ordered a salad once that looked nice because the cucumbers on top were fresh. But once I dug deeper into the bowl, the lettuce was brown and old. I've ordered chicken nuggets and fries a few times and some times they were hot and other times they weren't. And don't get me started on the actual employees. Not friendly, no smiles on their face and probably a few cases of badly drawn eyebrows. Lesson learned, will not be coming back even if it's for the delicious frosty.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,4,5,1,yvZjtjbH1BXDNDjJt52Oyw
2855467,2016-12-18,0,uaBVv3tZJaOd8lfPFInzTA,"Went here because it's close to the fwy.  The food was good, but the service is severely lacking.  First of all the restrooms only accommodate one person.  The men's restroom was out of order and women's was occupied by one person for over an hour.  Another customer told us he'd been here for over an hour and no restroom was available.  Three other customers wanted to use the bathroom, too
  An employee was told that someone was occupying the bathroom for over an hour.  All the employee did was knock on the door and as four customers watched she announced, ""Oh, someone's still in there."". This Wendy's should have a combo to access and have more than one accommodated for the restroom.  Another customer said the person was probably doing drugs in there.

4035425,2018-05-02,1,uaBVv3tZJaOd8lfPFInzTA,"This is my first visit here since the remodel on this particular Wendy's, and what a design decor upgrade they gave this location. Bravo. I remember how rundown and so very plain the old store was. The design of this store is even different than other Wendy's throughout the valley that have been remodeled. I love how the owners designed this location in such a square way. It is so perfect. 

The employees are some of the most upbeat and attentive staff that I have ever seen. They ensure that all the guest needs are met and it is performed with such personalized perfection. I ended of ordering the 4 for 4 menu with a jr bacon as my burger choice. Also salad was on the menu for me and enjoyed a Caesar salad and a Cobb salad that I split up between myself and the twins. I would revisit this store just to be in the company of such competent and courteous staff.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,2,2,5,T-2MB_Mg3Kx-eBsTDOqB8w
4147490,2013-04-01,0,uaBVv3tZJaOd8lfPFInzTA,"I don't know if it was a change in management, a change is support staff or a change in both but this Wendy's location has stepped up their game a bit.  Against my better judgement I went to Wendy's last week to give it another chance after months of a boycott.  I was impressed.  The food came out very quick and my order was accurate.  A spicy chicken sandwich.  I know, it is hard to mess up an order that simple.  So I decided to try again today.  Same situation.  Fast food and an accurate order received.  For that I am giving them a bump up to 3 stars from my previous rating of 2.  Today I ordered a Ceasar side salad, a four piece chicken nugget, and a spicy chicken go-wrap.  My complaint is that one of my four nuggets was about half the size of the other three but that is just the way it was processed.  3 stars seems fair right now for the change in customer service.  Change for the better is progress. 

I still have a problem with Wendy's on a corporate level.  They have alienated their customer base with cost cutting measures.  They have raised prices and given less food all to make a buck.  The side salad from Wendy's is not a big salad.  It is a side.  Yet the dressing packet was not big enough to even cover the side salad.  I would have asked for extra dressing had I ordered a larger salad.  There are a few items left on the menu I still like so I will probably be back.  Though I will not visit as frequently as I used to.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,0,0,3,D88HBeP5M_nZC2uO-XPj2w

Worker starting her shift digging down her drawers (yum!), Hobos wandering in with cups (no Wendy's cups in some cases, perhaps the hobos with Wendy's cups got them out of the trash?) then the hobos help themselves to the self serve drink machine, then to top it off, two young gentlemen sitting next to our table came in with their own cups and an empty 2 liter and filled them up at the self serve drink machine, sat down and proceeded to mix the soda with cough syrup. Sizzurp!

The biggest issue I've had is they are often out of food items (baked potatoes, spicy nuggets, grilled chicken to name a few I've encountered). But they do not tell you while ordering, so that you can look at the menu and pick out something else. I'm always told at the window, sometimes after I've already paid. Then I've  had the hassle of needing to be credited money back. Today the regular nuggets (they didn't have the spicy prepared) and my pulled pork sandwich were cold.

Baked potato was cold and this particular store doesn't have cheese or bacon for its potato's? Ok uh huh. The fries were white and raw.

We were finally approached by a janitor who informed us we would need to go to the cashier. My girlfriend and I were visibly upset at this point but we decided to comply hoping this would be the end of our troubles. We were wrong. When I reached the front of the line I told the women at the cashier I had a reservation for 7pm. The women had no idea what I was talking about and asked me what would like to eat. I kept pressing her about our reservation but she would only reply with menu items. Looking back, I'm not sure she spoke English. At this point I decided to call it quits and take my girlfriend somewhere else (Roberto's). I am thoroughly disappointed in Wendy and will no longer be dining at her restaurants any longer.

The ups? The staff is quick, friendly and present. The lines are never crazy, so if your order is simple it will be correct and fresh.

The downs? The bathroom is never clean. I have seen far to many sketchy characters (including a crying hooker hiding from a cop outside) that I now only really go through the drive through. If your order is off by just a simple ""no onion"" expect to get something completely different than what you ordered.
