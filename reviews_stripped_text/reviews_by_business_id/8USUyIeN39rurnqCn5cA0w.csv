The meat is cooked so it's crisp, yet tender, with the right combination of spices to give it character. They make their own refried beans and you can tell it's special. Their carne Asada dishes also show the quality of the meat and the cooking technique. The Mole and Menudo are also very tasty and do not have that fatty or gamey aftertaste you will find in versions of other restaurants. Their bar is also well equipped with some of the best tequilas, and they make some really good margaritas. Probably some of the best Mexican food in Las Vegas at very reasonable prices.

Let's start with the good: I had a chili relleno and a beef enchilada. The relleno was very good, with a nice sauce. The enchilada disappointed; the beef was tasty, but the sauce was awful, thin and vinegary, with no body and less flavor. The wife had a hard shell beef taco. They forgot to mention the shell was precooked, like taco bell. They should warn you about that, especially for10 bucks for one taco, rice and beans.

The service was good, with a salsa bar that had a wide selection, even though nothing spicy. It was a little disconcerting that the place was almost empty, but they left the dirty tables uncleared. 

We might give it one more try, but for the prices and location it better be killer.",ZL_zmesRw89J8PrsdJg6Uw,2,0,3,36Yqfw4RNc4amzGz5WxEVQ

I think I had 11 shots of tequila in a 2 hr span? Anyway I got here with my fiancé and my wifey and I naturally ordered the menudo and a Michelada. Honestly I have had places that don't make micheladas make better micheladas than this place. The menudo was mediocre. The waiter didn't even know the menu. My wifey asked for ceviche and he said there was no band they don't make it. Then we saw that they do ceviche tostadas then he remembered. It was also warm ceviche which doesn't sound right and maybe a health hazard.,ah7wTmpRSdpcPohpGuprsg,1,0,2,-nFqd6EA34ArTLgLwNmEjQ
1280025,2017-11-26,7,8USUyIeN39rurnqCn5cA0w,"A couple of nights ago, another Yelp Elite friend and I decided to eat real food after gorging on dessert type yummies of cookies and ice cream from another Vegas location. Yeah, I know we do things in reverse so my friend said we should try Los Lupes because he had heard great things about the place from the Yelp Community. So we entered the address on our phones and took our separate cars from the cookies and ice cream location.

For those who are looking to eat here, throw your phones on the seat next to you and just head to Decatur and Hacienda. Both my friend's and my phone navigation were trying to make us drive through a gated apartment complex and bring us back to the strip mall. We kept going in circles, so please put down your phones if coming from the West side.

Everything on the menu looked good but sometimes when you go to a restaurant, it ends right there... The Menu. I am a BAR (Born and Raised) Angeleno, so having ligit or great Mexican food is part of the formula. I also don't like posers so don't try to be something you are not (a person or a menu item) and try to fake me out. Posers... Gah! I ordered the Carnitas plate and a side of grilled jalapeños, just to take it up a notch. My friend ordered the Chile Verde, which my phone face planted in while I was trying to shed light on his food while taking a photo. True story. I would have taken a picture of it but my phone was taking a swim in Chile Verde. I ordered a Chardonnay but they were out, so I settled on the White Zinfandel as I just didn't feel 'red' that night. My friend ordered a Mexican Coke from the bottle and I said how great that was because Mexican Coke with real sugar was better than our HFC Coke. I really just said that because I have not had soda for 25 years and I don't think I would be able to taste the difference. No, I am not a Soda Poser.

Our food came out quickly and our server was very pleasant. We dug into our pork product dinners and ate and ate. My carnitas were tender and full of flavor. I did eat it with my jalapenos not because my meal was flavorless but because I like my meal like life, kicked up a notch and on fire. Chica en fuego!!  The rice and beans were very good and not dry, which is very important to me. I refuse to eat refried beans that are crusty and dry with rice that resembles those beans. Not here, very smooth and full of flavor- I don't know how else to describe non dry beans. 

All in all everything was delicious, the service was great and I will be back again to try other items. I also won't shed my phone light over someone's Chile Verde ever again. EVER.",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,11,9,4,EfCMa489o4GcyUr02ynA-w
1357555,2017-12-24,0,8USUyIeN39rurnqCn5cA0w,"I was looking for a good mexican restaurant to take my grandmother for her birthday. Well since this place had so many good reviews we all decided to go here. There was a Christmas party that was ending so the place was kinda empty. There was a party of about 10 so we gave them a little time to get the tables set up which wasn't long. Place was clean & had a typical mexican atmosphere with the different decor & other things. 

After being seated we immediately had yummy chips, salsa, and water. The chips were pretty good and the salsa was out of this world. So then it was time to order and I got the chili colorado burrito with beans and rice on the side. Well my food came and looked really good but.......I was slightly disappointed. The meat tasted a little tangy and there was absolutely NO CHEESE in sight!!!! None the less because I didn't eat all day I are it anyway. Everyone else enjoyed their food so most of our party was satisfied. 

The service was SUPERB and the waitress made sure we were taken care of and accommodated the various requests we had. That was a huge plus for me as I know this industry not easy and I can really appreciate and respect whenever I get excellent service. So kudos to them for that!!!!

Not sure if I'll return though cuz growing up in L.A. your palate knows what good & authentic mexican food is and tastes like. But then again the service alone may bring me back to give them a second chance. Maybe I'll do a Saturday since that's the only day they serve pozole. 

They came and sang tip my grandmother & gave her some fried ice cream. The other patrons around us also sang along. It wss really sweet! But thank you guys for making a great night for my grandmother since it was all about her.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,1,0,3,CrjWvNP3ael-0i67P5mk2A

We were about to enter pizza hut (in my defence we were starving) when saw 'mexican food' post.  The restaurant name was written is rather small font.

I quickly checked google reviews. Yelp takes time and as I told you we were starving.  Yet my wife wanted to freshen up at our staying place before eating. So we ordered a take out.  With happy hour chicken quesadillas (with sour cream, gouc and salad) costed $4. We ordered two of them. Picked up some small cups with salsa from their help yourself counter.

Habenaro salsa is hot but super fun. And I like spotting my quesadillas open put some diced cilantro, onion, tomato (from salsa counter).   Every bit was delicious.  Chicken was tender and flavorful.

The server was so nice...That despite a take away under $10 bucks she offered us a bag of nachos and house made salsa for free.

5 for salsa counter
5 for price
5 for small business (glad I missed pizza hut in their favor)

The nachos and salsa they give you to snack on were really good with their nicely flavored salsa. I ordered a quesadilla as an appetizer and no lie, literally the best one I've had to date! Loaded in flavor and it was just a cheese quesadilla! I also had a bean and cheese burrito and that as well was loaded in flavor. Out of all the Mexican restaurants I have been to, from L.A to Seattle, I could honestly say this place is freaking amazing! Next time I am eager to try their tacos de lengua, which I have a pretty good feeling will not let me down :D

It was so good, we plan to go back before we head home.   We ordered queso, guacamole, fajitas, burritos, quesadilla and Camarones Lupe (bacon wrapped shrimp)...all were delish!    Everyone loved the salsa and the bonus salsa bar where you can make your own.   The chips were fresh AND hot- such a rare find nowadays.

5061127,2016-08-02,0,8USUyIeN39rurnqCn5cA0w,"I spent almost 3 months for training in Vegas and found this little Mexican restaurant on Decatur. This is a small family owned restaurant and I know they have at least one other location.

The food here is affordable and surprisingly very good! I usually get the Camerones Diabla or some combo fajitas. He portions are very big. I love to eat and rarely leave food on the table but usually go home full Gavin not eaten everything. Their chips and salsa is good plus they have a salsa bad with 5 or six other favors to try including a good Verde salsa and a Habanero salsa that is much too hot for me but good flavor and I mix it with their table house salsa. 

If you want a tasty sit-down restaurant that isn't over priced you will be happy with his place. This location is new and they need the business, it has never been very busy here and I have eaten here half a dozen times. So give them some business and spread the word!",IdkRABZlODKbUdxVzcVI8A,0,1,4,C3caYgdttZ0DRRYQHOwM9g

We walk in and there is not a single soul in the place, but we get seated and the waiter attempts to take our drink orders a few times but still doesn't get it right, lol. It's all good though as long as the salsa and chips keep coming! 
They take our orders from fajitas to carnitas and everyone was very happy with their food!

Our server brought us a basket of chips, that were a bit stale but fine, there was no salsa bar but the salsa was tasty. 

I ordered a taco salad which was fine, nothing special. Hubs had a combination platter, which he didn't finish and he loves Mexican food. The presentation really wasn't that appetizing and the flavors weren't great. Perhaps we didn't order the right dishes. 

Kids had the usual kid tacos/quesadillas which were fine. 

Margarita on the rocks was tasty, but pretty pricey for bar liquor and bottle sour mix. 

The main surprise was the check, for a middle of the road Mexican restaurant our bill was very high. What surprised me was how expensive the margaritas and sodas were. Our entrees weren't that expensive but the total bill really was higher than I anticipated for this type of place.",--3WaS23LcIXtxyFULJHTA,4,0,3,hTATQZ1gRhxpZ2W5WpvpaA

A dish for two.... Both meats were very flavorful, seasoned well, and moist. Highly recommend this dish. Also comes with rice, beans, guac, sour cream, and your choice of torts...

So,the reason for the redemption..... on my first visit I ordered a chile verde wet burrito. First bite I thought, oh man this is good, but every subsequent bite kept getting saltier... I love me my Mexican food and I can be a bit over critical so even though my first meal wasn't the best... I knew I'd be coming back to give it another shot and I'm glad I did.

The service was very good both visits so that was a plus and they have good music playing overhead (my personal preference of course )...
