So when it comes to a take and bake pizza that's not the first thing I think about. But recently a relative got pizza from Papa Murphy's and i was addicted to their Mediterranean chicken thin crust pizza. 

So I went back and ordered just that a large size $14 uncooked and a deal for the BBQ pizza $11 for a large upsize to family size for an extra $2 not bad and a Papas favorite. That one had to much topping to where we had to throw it back into the oven twice to get it fully cooked. I mean I like extra topping I just didn't want to cook it. 

Any how on the plus size it was good and hot on the bad size you still pay premium price and you have to take it home and cook it. Me I rather order Pizza Hut and get it got delivered and ready to eat for the same price or maybe less. 

This place had nice staff and the shop was clean I will go back when they have specials because those are good for the belly and the wallet!",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,1,0,3,bhNX8UEmt4QEo717VZe8hg

She should have taken the the 2 min it would have taken to quickly fix the mistake. She should have NOT told me that I ordered wrong by saying ""large Pan"" instead of simply ""pan"". I have been here several times and have never had an issue with the way I have ordered my pizza. Completely, 100% unprofessional. Will never return to this establishment.

To the right, there's a ""pizza making bar"" with a splash guard and a small refrigerated area where you can pick up cheesy garlic bread sticks, cookies or salads.

The place is very clean and the concept is actually pretty cool! So you come in and the menu is on the wall, you pick your pizza and order and pay for it at the register, then once you've paid, you can watch them prepare your pizza, take it home and bake it! The only thing that sucks is that they really measure the exact amount of meat/cheese/veggies to the T. 

My husband and I got a thin large pizza that is half cowboy and half chicken garlic. On my husbands half, it hand about 10 small pieces of sausage and about 10 slices of pepperoni as well. My half of the pizza had 1/4 of a cup of chicken on it with a white garlic sauce. 

When my husband and I got home, we quickly preheated the oven and threw it in there to bake along with the 1/4 pound of cheese garlic bread! Both items baked came out perfectly! The crust of the thin pizza was amazing and crispy and the cheesy garlic bread has this amazing stringiness to it! You can tell their food is prepared fresh! All in all, it was delicious and we will definitely be coming back- especially on Tuesdays since a large pizza is $10.00!!!",rqb5abV146wcU-Z7JxfEIQ,4,3,4,UxMnZfvk0GFtffEohebhOg

Of course, getting delivery would be ""easier,"" but I always feel so disgusting after eating greasy delivered pizza (even though it satisfies a craving once in a blue moon).  Papa Murphy's is about 10 minutes away.  We make a phone call and it's ready for pick up.  In our oven, it takes only about 12 minutes to get a nice crisp crust.  

We find that because it's fresh, it's not greasy.  The toppings have always been good.  We tend to get supreme.  The sauce it yummy, slightly tart.

Yes, we consider ourselves ""foodies.""  Yes, we enjoy our NY or Neopolitan style pizza above everything else.

The order and pick up process it easy, you can even call in your order so there is less wait time at the location. The pizzas are made to order depending on size, crust, sauce, and toppings. Cook time is short and the pay off is a pleasant tasting crust, not a lot of grease, fresh tasting toppings and fresh from the oven- no worries as to how long your pizza has been out of the oven or who touched it or how it was tortured on the speedy car ride to your house.

The young woman greeted me and was very friendly and helpful. She asked if I had been there before and I said no. I told her I would like the $7 pizza and she directed me to pick it up at the cashiering area.
There were 3 men huddled around the register, none of them acknowledged me for about 5 minutes. I can guess there was an issue with their register or a pick up order. They did not talk to me or ask what I needed the whole time I stood there as the only customer in the store. I would have gladly paid cash plus tip or anything to expedite the process. 
The young woman mouthed ""I'm sorry"" to me after I stood there about 3 minutes in silence. It is not her fault as she was doing her job at the pizza bar and managing phone calls while the men ignored the phone ringing.
I am genuinely disappointed in the older men on staff. As a man, speak up if there is an issue and handle the situation. Or at least acknowledge your customers. Blatantly ignoring someone is so disrespectful and infuriating. I walked out of the store after a couple more minutes with no assistance.",s-kbwR7iFsmagwpktmmrlA,2,0,1,StPmHsmDS0S5Lur7VX1Caw

HOWEVER, the beloved swears by it, and when he told me has was going tonight, I decided to give them another try.. And I'm so glad I did!! I ordered the vegetable (vegetarian) pizza. I ordered pan-style crust, and on the menu it comes with cheese, mushroom, tomatoes, spinach, onions, and artichoke hearts, with a substitution of creamy garlic sauce, instead of traditional red pizza sauce. I ordered it without artichoke, and added black olives and feta cheese. 
Sooooo good!! They have a special on Tuesdays (today) that most large pizzas are 10 dollars. The bread/crust tasted so fresh, and they did not skimp on the toppings!! The best part was the creamy garlic sauce. I LOVE garlic and this had perfect flavor! And only took about 12 minutes to cook at home.

First off, if you are not familiar, it is a Take and Bake Pizza place.  So they don't cook it there.  They make the pie there topped with whatever you please and you take it home to cook.  The cook time is maybe about 15-20 minutes, depending on crispy you like your pie.  

There are three types of crust, Original, deLite think crust, and Stuffed pizza/calzones.  I went with Original.  

I tried Papa's Favorite (which is like a supreme pizza) and the Gourmet Chicken Garlic.  Both were delicious.  It really makes a difference when you cook it yourself.  Oh man, the ooey gooey cheesiness is yuuuuuuumy.  All the fresh ingredients they use that seriously makes all the difference.  

The prices are decent, you get more for your money here then at your regular mainstream pizza places.  Did I mention they have a Pick-Up drive through?  When they make it for you, they put it together in a matter of 5-10 minutes.  So you can call ahead, drive there, get your pie....plus get your beers next door at Lee's, LOL.",i3bLA4sEdFk8j3Pq6tx8wQ,1,0,4,X7bhP5HMsWm9yZPYvYB9JA

Every pizza topping was measured precisely and took it home to bake and within 20 min i had a fresh pizza. the only downside is it isnt something thats going to WOW you its pretty basic. 

Angus Steak n Garlic Thin Crust (4/5)- This pizza was actually pretty Delish!! They Put steak cheesefresh garlic and green onions on top. Great Flavor I reccomend this pizza to anyone.

Half Pepperoni/ Half Hawaiian regular crust(2/5)- This pizza really sucked i did not enjoy it at all i think the pizza dough just didnt do it for me. Its hard to go wrong with classics but i think if i got it deep dish or thin it would be better.

Overall this place has its ups and downs. The good thing is its better than going to the supermarket and getting a pie.
