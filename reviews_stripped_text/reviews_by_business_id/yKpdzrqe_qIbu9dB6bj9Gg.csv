I tested the Gyro special testing menu. This is a big joke.
$23 for a gyro made with dry pitta bread, extra dry chicken, rubber like feta and tzatzki with no cucumber or garlic.
This is the worse gyro I ever had.
Side fries were re-fried and over cooked.
And what they call a testing menu is the side of cold veggies (two carrots, two zucchini) and three leaves of spinach top with ??? Impossible to determine.

Honestly, the food was just okay, and actually probably a little below average for the price, but the convenience of being seated and served as well as the bottomless water and coffee made the extra money worth it, especially if you are exhausted from a hectic weekend in Vegas and want to just relax and fuel up before your flight.

Great service and the wait time was not bad at all. Definitely worth a try",70vV_4lQtuX6n4TO90OlAw,0,0,4,XmOY4F132eZRhCxxRK-FwA

I had the salmon sandwich and kitchen chips (which are best with BBQ sauce of course) and to my chagrin, the grill didn't have any!! Food was better than most airport food and I appreciate the healthy options on the menu.

Staff is amazing, especially Norris who tried to find a solution for my BBQ sauce and made sure I was mostly happy (can't be at 100% because no BBQ sauce!)",mlqdYO3rWb6MfwC364OGDQ,0,0,4,wF_N3lDsoGqEKGW74VSH0w
5580049,2018-04-07,0,yKpdzrqe_qIbu9dB6bj9Gg,Hidious excuse for food. No taste and expensive. Like a lot of the strip. You'd think the mayor would enforce the airport to have actual restaurants people would enjoy seeing this is an international city and so many visitors. The locals would appreciate it too!,e57n35DoD25rSVMNkfTvYQ,0,0,1,GpF-xlboX5ofAi-HzKPXvg

I have never had such terrible service, however, once the waitress came to take our order she was a very nice person. How can you ruin a simple breakfast that you serve day in and day out? Bacon and eggs, and potatoes. An American restaurant staple for any and all cooks and chefs, right? I was served bacon that was already cooked and dipped into the fryer to warm up. The bacon was chewy and dark. The waitress verified this for me. The potatoes were cold and hard and my eggs under cooked. What else can I say and the 2 star rating, perhaps somewhat generous. Anyone else with a similar experience? The next time I am in this situation, I will wait the hour and ten minutes it takes to fly to Reno and go to one of my many favorite places for a decent, stick to your ribs breakfast.",YyEHD4ebCTtlOR0U3FKTDw,1,0,2,7-hAuT_7vzfBG1V1x3kEvw
