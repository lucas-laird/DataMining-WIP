17123,2013-08-01,0,Ta4GRuHyZvU5H_l5IAG1PQ,"My family came to visit me from Hawaii during the hottest week of June 2013. During their stay I took them to Nanay Gloria's for late lunch.  From other reviewers description of the possible wait for a table, we were lucky that it wasn't crowded at all. 

You seat yourself.  There is no instructions from the staff to what to do - no signs, either.  So, don't expect a greeter.  I think there should be one, though!  In any case, Thank goodness for reading the reviews here on yelp - so, I told my family just pick a table and start filling your plate.   For water there is a water cooler and ice bucket with plastic cups off to the corner.  If you want regular drinks, ask the busboy that comes around cleaning the tables.  

The restaurant is pretty clean - we noticed that it took a bit for the bus boy to clean the tables from previous customers.  Otherwise,  the dining area is relatively clean AND the buffet area is VERy VERY clean.  There are signs throughout the buffet area starting from the plate sections of the health rules:  basically, do not come up to buffet table with your used plates.  Must get new plates and bowls.  I was relieved that they at least had these signs.  

They have large plates (for starches) and small bowls to put your other entrees - initially, we just piled it on our plates.  Only, when we saw what other new customers were doing on loading their plates:  large plates for starches and small bowls for other foods.  Theres no rules But I thought I would mention it here.  :)

The food was pretty good - a large variety.  I guess you never know what will be served.  We all enjoyed it.  We especially loved the pancit.  Very simple yet yummy.  We all tried everything.  It was all good and tasty Filipino dishes.  I liked the fried smelt - or, dilis.  so - good!  My aunt liked the beef stew (Nilagang baka).   The dinuguan was good - no grit.  There was a lot to choose from!

However, the dessert is priced separately.  We didn't try any of it but the turon and cascaron looked yum.  I  noticed a customer got some and looked happy eating it.  

In the back of the restaurant - there is a little grocery area where you can buy ingredients for a meal or buy crackers and candies from the Phillipines like polvoron.  So, check out the back for more.

My only real negative was that the air conditioned was not on full.  It felt humid in there.  Outside was literally 113 degrees and we had hoped to cool in a restaurant but we were disappointed.  It was not cool at all!!   They were stingy on the air-conditioning!  The staff behind the buffet didn't smile at all.  We didn't feel welcomed.  Even when we paid, there was no smile.  We were 4 filipino women just wanting to eat - nothing strange about us.  So, don't expect a friendly staff.  

In any case, I would come here again - maybe cooler climate. LOL   :)",ojWHUyIdPywoldOfzJ9yqA,1,0,4,HipAoQ9J-AoK2LhZ4h-7XA

260867,2013-03-15,0,Ta4GRuHyZvU5H_l5IAG1PQ,"Let me start off by saying this place is worth ever penny. 8 bucks for a buffet.

My brother and I haven't had phillipino food for 3 years. We were craving some goat, dinuguan,  and chicken adobo. unfortunately, they didn't have dinuguan, ""next time"" , they said. That's fine with me, because DAAAAANG was the rest of the food good, everything was ""fall-off-the-bone"" melt-in-your-mouth tasty. 

When we walked in, we felt at home, as the old fillipina grandmas behind the counter couldn't help but explain all of the great foods they've cooked. 

If you've just finished watching ""bizzarre foods with Andrew zimmern"" , and you're now craving some of that mouth watering amazingness, sloppy, cartilagous , fatty good stuff, this is the spot. Full of flavor. 

I'm going back. 5 stars.

i would not come here ever again. The beef mechado was hard, the pancit looked like it has been sitting under the sun and the look on it was soggy and to top it off, didnt have much flavor to it. The Beef Steak was dry and meat was a bit hard, the melon drink had no kind of flavor.
I mean i can go on FOREVER with this place.
Its not an AUTHENTIC FILIPINO restaurant, if that's what you're looking for. You're better off going to Pinoy, Pinay on E. Sahara if this was the case. for $6.99 i guess that's the food that you will be paying for. Not recommended at all!",buitspdA0ZGWNBu2Mjtz0g,2,2,1,Sg5HZPGbYqNA2q22JzyRnw

511225,2010-07-20,0,Ta4GRuHyZvU5H_l5IAG1PQ,"Visited Nanay Gloria's for the first time two weeks ago and was first surprised at how many different entrees there were to choose from! It's sad to say but I don't know my Filipino dishes aside from the typical ones you see at Filipino family parties and the ones you know by only looking at rather than taste. This was the case the day I was at Nanay Gloria's. I took only the pancit, lechon, and after searched high and low for sisig, since that is almost always to be found at Filipino all-you-can-eats but sadly, I found none.. until one of the very friendly workers behind the counter offered me the last of the sisig. Apparently they keep the sisig in one of those to go containers? Anyway, I was happy and excited to try the sisig since it looked pretty appealing but I was disappointed. My first reaction was why in the world was the sisig chewy and when my dad tasted a piece, he said it was lechon sisig? Idk but that was definitely not my cup of tea. The pancit and actual lechon were so-so. After engaging in some conversation between meals, I noticed one of the workers put out a steaming tray of ginataan. I quickly filled a bowl for each of my family members and myself and I'm pretty sure we all had the same look on our faces after the first spoonful. The ginataan was SO sweet that it did not even taste like ginataan.

Overall, this place is okay - the atmosphere is nothing special and I noticed they had some show on GMA playing on their TV. Sorry Nanay Gloria, your price of $6.99 is good but I've eaten at better Filipino all-you-can-eats and.. I'm team TFC Kapamilya.",j0aLNLDM0H5CiUbduni-BA,0,1,2,y7JmAr1R1VkRjJ35qh2kOA

Our whole group consisted of 9 people and Nanay Gloria's was able to accommodate with plenty more available seating. This place is comparable to the Filipino all-you-can-eat joints in San Diego, if not better. If you need to satisfy that sweet tooth, they have desserts here than can be purchased separately. This will definitely be one of the spots we hit up when we come back to Vegas from Cali.",0JR1FF_TfCZ5U8DK9ftugw,0,0,4,vfikcPYSmUK6VLsKdSaVwQ

I'm straight up all about Filipino food and my standards are not high, my wife can vouch for it. The price is CHEAP, but the food was okay and don't expect a casual dining experience.
I was looking forward to going to this place because of what heard, but I think we went to the wrong place...I think we should have gone to the other place. to make this worse, I just came off a flight and was starving.
if you've been to a ""hole in the wall"" kind of place, this is close to it. They have a decent variety of food, but we had to pay for an order of lumpia...it was not part of the buffet.

I had two disappoints with the sinigang. One it was beef. Not a horrible thing I just prefer pork sinigang. The second is my major disappointment, it was not sour at all. The flavor wasn't bad. The beef was alright. But there was no jaw tingling sourness. Sinigang should be sour and this did not deliver. If you don't like sour sinigang than this is good for you. I wish I had some sinigang soup base (tamarind powder) this would of been so much better. The pancit was whatever. I didn't even eat the rice since I'm so sad with the sinigang.

Be warned: make sure you know Filipino food because it'll make the experience that much better.  Don't get me wrong.  You'll still get a good meal if you don't know.  It's just a matter of appreciating what you're getting.

I actually remember always going to Nanay Gloria as a kid, however, this spot in particular didn't hit the spot like it used to. 

LAYOUT:
Nanay Gloria is laid out similar to a Chipotle, except it's self serve, you pay after you've eaten, and buffet style. However, you can buy per entré. They offer a variation of Filipino food such as; salmon head sinigang, menudo, longanisa, tocino, mungo, kare-kare, and so many others. Then, there's a spot for suman (sweet sticky rice), balut (developing duck embyro), there's a shelf of Filipino treats, and a cooler of drinks! 

FOOD:
The food is yummy! It's authentic and made truly from the Lolas and Lolos in the kitchen. The only thing that I don't really ever like from any Filipino restaurants is the RICE. Rice is an absolute must when it comes in Filipino cuisine, but unfortunately the rice is usually a miss. It's just separated because it has been cooked for too little or it's cooked too much. But other than that, the food hits home.",kOT_C9B-dGITaK_vpBeYNg,3,3,4,YXLiOgnRViM99ettkUi62A

It's not the best Filipino food I've had, but for the prices it works for me. 

It's a turo-turo restaurant, meaning they have a buffet of food and you get rice and two sides or similar combos. Selection changes a bit from day to day. I personally prefer actual sit down Filipino restaurants where they have a menu, but sometimes this is just easier. You can also eat there and treat it as a buffet. A great thing if you're looking to get full. 

Oh, but I will say it's my favorite place to get Sisig [it's a spicy crispy pork dish]. They make it oh so good.

Nanay Gloria's is actually one of my usual AYCE Filipino food feasting spots . It's cheap under $10, has a good selection of items, and the foods not that bad.  I must've had like 6 or 7 full plates of everything last time I was there. If you're unsure what's good or what's what just ask, they seemed nice and friendly, or take small servings. You eat first and pay after. 

This location has improved over the years from a cash only crowded single dining area business to cash and card a little more spacier two dining area with even a little market business. Back when it was cash only it kind of iterated me that I'd find myself going to the other location more often even though it was farther. I like the snacks, drinks, and additional items outside from the buffet, extra charges.

There is a minimum for card charges of I think $10 which is more than then buffet price so probably have to buy something like a snack and you should be fine. Also if your card has a chip your SOL, they won't take it.

Their selection was satisfying enough for my family.  I was sad they didn't have any lumpia or any type of desserts except for fresh fruit, but overall, everything tasted pretty good.  There's a few shelves of dry goods from the Philippines and also a refrigerated section that sells salted red eggs and Eden cheese, amongst other items.  The mom and pop (Nanay Gloria and husband?) who run the place were very nice and humble people.  They had one busser who worked his butt off clearing plates and wiping down tables.  They seem to do a big takeout business.  My mom got some stuff for our mirienda (""snack"") on the drive back home to Sac.

 Happy Birthday to me !  -=) 
 I went with the family to eat at Nanay Gloria's for breakfast today (I was totally craving Longanisa).  
Longanisa is a filipino sausage that is usually either sweet / spicy.  Nanay Gloria's Longanisa is not spicy at all.  Anyhow, I went at 9 am in the morning.  It wasn't too crowded, so finding a table wasn't a hassle.  This place is small, so on some days it can be real difficult to find a place to sit and eat.  The place also has a Flat Screen hanging with TFC (The Filipino Channel) on.  Here's the deal:

PROS-
* All - you - can - eat brunch for approx. $6.00 (w/o a beverage)
* Good selection of authentic Filipino cuisine
I recommend their Longanisa, Beef Steak, Garlic Fried Rice, & Pancit
* Filipino Channel while you eat
* MangTomas, Jufran, and Vinegar w/ onion @ every table
* Everything tastes just like home !
* Take out option
* Good for the Family

CONS-
* small space w/ uncomfortable seating arrangement
(spacing  between tables suck...I may as well start conversation with the stranger sitting next to me because they can easiily hear everything I say.  I don't think this place would be wheelchair accessible)
* Desserts/Drinks are not included in the AYCE
* They only take cash (No Credit Cards... it's 2011... Hello).

The weird thing about this place is that you pay after you eat... That's rare now-a-days.  I'd give Nanay Gloria's more stars, if it weren't for the minimal (and warm) selection of fruit, the lack of water available (they need to keep an eye on their community water pitchers), and all the other cons that I listed above.  Overall though, if you are looking for quality authentic Filipino dishes for a cheap price, this is the way to go!

Went in during an evening to scratch the itch with the homie Akk from Stain Tattoo next door. I get my regular three items whenever I venture into a Filipino restaurant. Sinigang na baboy (pork and veges in a sour tamarind base), Lechon kawali (deep fried pork), and chicharon bulaklak (deep fried pork intestines). 

The sinigang na baboy is up to par. I can't complain. Now since it was in the evening, the sought-after items were down to the last pieces. I'm talking about the lechon kawali and chicharon bulaklak. This can be a good and bad thing all at once. Part of me was glad that there were only pieces left of those two items. I get a few of the kawali and bulaklak. Everything was gone on my first plate. I gets up and tries to get more kawali and bulaklak. All gone for the day. Nick D explains it perfectly in his review. ""Cholesterol at its' finest"". I swear to God this stuff is bad for you. I liked that they have the secret sauce that makes lechon even more heavenly on every table. Mang Tomas! You my only friend! Their vinegar sauce is one of my favorite sauces between the other Filipino restaurants. Seasoned vinegar with chucks of onions marinating and just waiting to be dunked with unhealthy pieces of chicharon bulaklak. OH MY CHRISTO!!! SUS-MAR-YO-SEP!!! My body was thanking Nanay Gloria's that they were out and was not going to be making anymore the rest of the day.

In Tagalog, Nanay means mom, so it's really no surprise the food here is so good, not gonna lie it puts a lot of peoples cooking to shame.

Filipino's love buffet's, I mean Vegas. And Filipino's go hand in hand with buffets, just come to any party and see the food spread. Most people are surprised that this is a regular occurrence and not something special like Thanksgiving. 

Located in a strip mall in Chinatown (massage parlor central). It's pretty non descript. The self serve buffet style and AYCE at a price that's half what most ACYE or buffet places charge, AND it's Filipino food. I've had mediocre Filipino food a lot in my life and can tell you this is the best buffet I've seen. The offerings are in the dozens of items (sinigang, nilaga, kare-kare, adobo, lechon, sisig, afritata, paksiw, dinuguon, pancit, luglug, palabok, laing, pinakbet, balut). Some of these items may vary on availability, but having all those offerings is kinda crazy. Banana-su, turon, flan for desserts (surprisingly light on the bibinka selection). Water, fruits and lighter fare are in the other room.

Grab a tray, grab a plate, grab a soup bowl and pace yourself. They have some snacks for purchase in a little market in the back. 

The booths are pretty well worn and plates can stack up. Décor is basic, but when you sneak a peak into the kitchen and it's cranking (catering as well) you know things are warming, but haven't been sitting. 

Without getting into all the dishes that I had (diving into each will give away how much I ate) a few things that stood out from me are the house made Bagoong for the kare kare had good flavor, wasn't too pungent. The dinuguon wasn't too rich and had a mix of meat and intestines and not either or, no peppers for heat. The GFR went super quick, the white rice wasn't dry. The pancit, also not dry. The sinigang was not pork or fish, weird. I enjoyed the ginger in the soups and was expecting some other dishes over a few I saw. 

There are not designations, it's a Filipino buffet and they kind of expect you to know what things are, if not then you certainly aren't Filipino enough. To be honest, just spoon it out and try it, not knowing is actually one of the best ways to indoctrinate non Filipinos to the food. 

It's a place off the strip that doesn't get the love of Aloha grill or others, but the quality of food and price and variety is something I've never seen before. This is truly where the locals eat at.",864nL0po2ldN8TPgbSiwOQ,10,6,4,2pMJRDw8rM2BrIBox4eyJg

Maybe I just set high standards for my fellow Filipinos, but if I'm coming here to fork up $7.95 to eat some decent Filipino dishes, I would hope that I could taste some culinary spirit in my taste buds.

 I love the concept of ""turo-turo"". This means to point and pick your dishes. It reminds me a lot of my Philippine vacations when I was a little girl. I was always so eager to point at all the things I liked. 

Now, I only come here for the sake of my mother. She loves this place, the dishes they offer, and the taste of home. But for me, I feel like this place just doesn't live up to culinary expectations of a really good, home cooked Filipino cuisine. 

The dishes they offer here is a hit or miss for me. Yesterday, it was a miss. A variety of the dishes I picked out were really cold, and have been sitting out for a while. The dishes also started to taste the same as well. I love Tocino, but when I took a bite of the Tocino dish they offered, it was REALLY dry. It had none of that awesome thick burning sweet sauce I love so much. The Pancit Malabon is also my favorite noodle dish. However, there were no pieces of chicken or meat to found. There were no pork grind crumbs, or any hint of green garnish from chopped onion that I hoped for. It was all noodle. My heart was really torn. I really wanted to cry.

My experience here just isn't satisfying for me. Unless they can cook better than my mommy, auntie, grandma, uncle, cousin, friends, and my friends' parents. Then I won't feel like they can provide me anything of monetary value.",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,3,1,2,CrIZnu72z7homXEl4yhpfg

My Pilipino Peeps say Nanay Gloria's is great!  ""Hoi nakong, you will bee pull!  Da beep-stek is delicious!"" I was told by an older patron, which I think thought I was one of her relatives.  Oh well, we do what we do!  Be respectful and tell nanay 'salamat'.  

Nanay Gloria's is a Filipino eatery, they do either choices with rice and soup, or you can go for the gusto and do the all-you-can-eat-especially-if-you-love-pork option for about $7.50.  Do the buffet folks!  It's worth it if you have the time and are familiar with a lot of the dishes offered.  Which day to day will differ, but it's a good thing especially if you don't mind change.  

We manage to always miss breakfast at Nanay Gloria's.  Some say it is probably the best meal they serve.  Rice, eggs, tocino, tomatoes, sweet longanisa (oh how I relish those potent loganisa burps), what's not to like?  And for a buffet?  Even better!  And with the breakfast buffet usually the lunch items are already mixed in there as well.  Brunch if you will.  All for the same price!  If you're gonna go, go BIG I say.

We usually get here for lunch and there's often a crowd.  It can get busy between late breakfast and early lunch.  Seating is pretty limited, but at least there is a dining area on the opposite side of the buffet line.  But be aware when you go to Nanay Gloria's, the rooms are warm!  Even with the AC on I was still sweatin' a bit.  I don't know if they are just trying to save money by keeping the thermostat at the 80s or folks working there want to feel like they are back home in the islands...hot and humid!  Bring a fan to cool yourself down just in case.  

The food?  Overall not bad.  Everything there goes lovely with white rice (which they server plenty of).  If you're into the carb and gluten-free life proceed with caution.  Hell, if you're watching your cholesterol proceed with caution!  Nanay Gloria's is some down home, stick-to-your-ribs food, and is often sitting in 'juice'...aka 'grease'...aka 'fat=flavor'.  Don't nobody be draining the fat!  Bastos!

I like my crispy pata.  I like my bistek.  I like my adobo.  I like my bangus.  I like my sinigang.  I like it all over my rice.  Trust me, there are a number of pork dishes available at Nanay Gloria's, but I stick with my basic favorites.  Just hook me up a plate of food with a side of vinegar and garlic for dipping, some jufran, and a bottle of all-purpose sauce...and I'm set.  Let the battle begin!  

We literally cannot go there more than once every couple of months.  It just takes a lot out of you!  Cholesterol and salt content must be monitored!  And extra runs on the treadmill help too.  But oh do I like the food.

So the next time you want some pretty authentic Filipino food and you're on a budget, hit up Nanay Gloria's.  You will be greeted with a smile and and empty plate.  Fill that sucker up!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,8,1,3,kTIgJnpppR9BHbFwtNPLyw

I pretty much stuck to the breakfast, but I grabbed a bowl or two of some sinigang - warm soup always goes well with Filo brekkie items.

Everything was good. Obviously, since the eggs were pre-cooked and sitting out, they weren't optimal. I was really looking for a ""ToSiLog"" type of breakfast with a less cooked egg, but this buffet satisfied my craving.

The price has slowly crept up and it's now $8.99 plus tax per person, but it's still a great value. After tax you're paying less than $10 for a meal, which is impressive for a buffet. My parents always make it a point to have one meal here while in town visiting, so that speaks volumes.

If you aren't very familiar with Filipino food, then you'll have difficulty here because nothing is labeled. While I grew up eating Filipino food, even I'm unable to name every item being served on any particular day. It would definitely help if they added labels for each item, but it's a manageable problem. If you don't know what something is, then just ask.

Like any buffet, you're eating for volume, not quality. The food isn't bad, but there are definitely better options for Filipino food in town. Nevertheless, if you want to stuff yourself with tons of serviceable Filipino food for a great price, then Nanay Gloria is the place to do it.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,0,0,4,sJd8_XmgUh72Rv5zIL4mXQ

one star taken off because of the dining arrangement in the restaurant. it is very difficult to get a seat in there on a busy day because it's such a small space. also, if you are with a large group, you might have to end up sitting at separate tables or trying to cram about 6 people on the table in front of the buffet table where the kare kare is.

After arriving Friday night and all plans going down the gutter and spending ALL night and morning looking for a place to stay (damn MTV VMA's) I finally got some sleep... Woke up at 12pm Saturday and my friends suggested to go to ""Nanay Gloria's""...

As soon as I arrived at Nanay Gloria's.. For some reason, all the pain in my head went away... The smell of fresh rice, the tuyo and the ever so delicious longanisa just put me in complete contempt. I felt like I was back at home in my dinning room eating my Mom's home-cooked meal. 

$5.99 for ALL YOU CAN EAT filipino food is a huge bargain.. Not JUST a bargain but a steal.. The food they serve is great quality and straight out of the kitchen. I didn't see any flies around nor any type of bugs.. And usually, going to a filipino or ethnic restaurant you see this. The place was moderately clean even with so many ppl coming in and out. 

The food was delicious... I went into Nanay Gloria's with 11 of my friends and we completely OWNED the place up. 

I highly suggest everyone to go here, especially if your feeling maybe a little home sick and things are going the way you planned it in Vegas, this is the remedy. 

OH!!!!!!!!!!! OMG! I almost forgot, whatever you do, try the Cantaloupe juice drink! I can't even describe its amazing taste, I haven't had that good of a cantaloupe drink ever since i was a little boy with my bowl haircut in Philippines.

The lunch buffet is 8.99. When you walk in just grab a tray and eat. You'll pay after your meal. They offer a variety of authentic Filipino dishes that involve a lot of pork. The veggies mostly consist of eggplant or string beans. They also have a lot of dishes with innerds as the protein ( tripe, liver etc). Most of what I had was pretty good. The meats were tender and moist, the veggies were cooked nicely ( a little mushy but that's ok with me). The flavors were pretty good. 

I wouldn't suggest this place if you don't like eating at hole in the wall places. It can look a little grimy if you're used to fancy eating.

Not to mention, it's the only Filipino business I've ever been to where the TV was tuned to Jerry Springer and not TFC/GMA.  Whoa!

Tried out Nanay Gloria's infamous $6.99 buffet and I gotta say, it was so worth it.  They had about 12-14 items on the buffet and what was cool is that if something ran out, which hopefully wasn't your favorite item, they'd put something new on the buffet.  There were a few items I didn't try mostly because I couldn't identify but, the food was super good.

Kare-Kare - If you're lucky enough to get some meat pieces, it's way delicious.
Lechon Kawali - Cholesterol at it's finest.  Cooked perfectly and was crispy.
Pancit - There were two versions of pancit the whole time we were there, the darker version tasted much better.
Caldareta - The beef could've been a little more tender but the sauce was yummy and had the right amount of sweetness.
Afritada - So damn good!!

When we were about done, they brought out the Empanadas which cost extra but if I wasn't full, I would've definitely tried one out.

Here are a few tips before visiting Nanay:
-They work on an honor system.  So, grab a plate near the cashier and serve yourself.  You'll pay when you're done.
-Sodas are in the very back.  Yes, they have Sarsi as well.  Again, you'll pay when you're done.
-It gets crowded and can be a little hard to maneuver around.  So, if Tita Baby elbows you, let her, she's hungry and so are you...so blow it off.",-vBbg7fTK3y8W0PtpzlLWQ,1,1,4,Jju0wjHARCI3w3fUQ47rQA

The food was pretty decent and nicely flavored. We were surprised at the selection- we were expecting to have maybe half the choices offered.

From what I recall there was- 
mungo (mungbean with bittermelon and pork), - pretty okay, but I make it better since mine is very meaty/savory
paksiw baboy (pork slices in a sweet soy sauce), * - BF loved this. Sweet, sticky, but nice flavors. 
ginesang pusit (sauteed squid w/ chilies, and bellpepper), *- I really liked this. Right on with the flavors.
pancit (thin glass noodles),- was okay
 sisig (chopped pork with vinegar, chilies and onion), *- made with the lechon kawali, lots of chilies, added more vinegar for a kick
ginetaang baboy (pork in coconut &shrimp paste sauce), *- this was good. I love coconut milk based dishes
lechon kawali (crispy fried or roasted pork belly), - good, crispy. Like always, big layer of fat, but at least you can pick it off it you're not a fat lover. 
lengua estofada (beef tongue slices in a tomato soy sauce)* - the tongue was really soft, but I like how they kept them in thick slices to keep it juicy inside. The sauce was good, but I scraped a lot off since I like tasting more of the lengua flavor
afritada manok (chicken in a tomato sauce- has bellpepper, potatoes, carrot),- I didn't try
ginisang (squash, shrimps, green beans, bittermelon sautee)- grabbed only some green beans, okay
ginisang ampalaya (bittermelon sauteed with eggs)- didnt try
seafood ginetaang (mixed seafood in coconut milk)- didnt try
diniguan (pork cooked in it's blood and spices)*- pretty decent for the standard style of doing diniguan. I do it in a different style which no restaurant makes and I feel is tons better
palabok (thick rice noodles in a sortve ""gravy"" sauce)- mushy, didnt like
pork afritada (pork tomato sauce stew- has peas, potatoes, hotdog, bellpeppers)- had a small bite only, decent
Nilaga Baka (beef broth soup with chunks of beef and veggies like bokchoy, cabbage, potato)- didn't have
kaldereta (beef stew)- pretty decent, but a bit more oily than I make it
kare kare (oxtail, tripe, eggplants and green beans in a thick peanut sauce)- no oxtails to be found, way too oily, but the tripe was nice in it.
beef steak (sliced beef and onions in soy sauce)- this was okay...it was straight soy...lacking that signature sauce lemony/soy/beefy flavor 
fried salmon- didnt try
fried bangus/milkfish*- pretty good! my favorite fish and it was fresh. 
pata na paksiw (pork leg/hocks cooked in soy and banana flowers)- didnt try, I dont really like the fatty leg rims
ginetang (warm coconut milk dessert with sweet yams and tapioca)- too full to have dessert
banana que (bananas fried with sugar) - too full to have dessert
fresh fruit bar- watermelon, oranges, pineapple, etc. - looked fresh

The * are some of our favorites. BF really loved the paksiw- tender and nice flavor, I love the lengua the best. 

There are some extras you can buy but we were hella full to grab them. They have chicken empanadas, crispy pata (deep fried pork leg), sweets like polvoron (powdered milk ""cookie""), pastillas (chewy milk candies), cashew tarts, tamarind candy, turon (fried banana and jackfruit ""eggroll"" cooked with a coating of sugar on the wrapper), kuchinta (steamed rice cake), pichi-pichi (rice and cassava cake rolled in grated coconut).  

BTW- they are CASH ONLY. Lucky I had cash today, I normally don't roll with much more than a few bucks for tips and my cards. 

Simply put- compared to the Filipino a-la-carte places nearby, this is better in terms of quality and flavor and freshness (they have decent traffic so it doesn't sit forever). Add in the kicker that you can eat all you want for $7!. Some items were a miss like the palabok was mushy, but most were decent to good, spot on flavors. I can't complain since I can pick and choose what I want to eat and can skip out on the a-ok items and pig on the things I love. 

Yes, there's a bit of fat, a bit of grease, but nothing that you can't scoop out. It's kinda part of the culture...Flipinos enjoy their fat. It's not  really more than say other greasy cuisines like diner food, chinese, soul food, etc.. It's why I don't eat out all the time though is so I can savor these when I do decide to eat something greasy and homey.  I think that's partly why MY mother's food is best to me- she tends to buy only higher end, leaner meats, but cooks with all the love and flavor. I got used to my moms health conscious, yet still flavorful Filipino, but she's no where close so I'll take something 2nd best to moms cooking....specially since I don't cook my own cultures food on a regular at home (for shame, I know and I call myself a ""cook"").

I'm the type of person who really likes eating at places like this because it reminds me of the Filipino home cooking from my family that I truly miss.

They have two rooms: a room with the buffet line and tables with chairs and the other room with booths and a water dispenser. They did not have a soda fountain, so all the drinks have to be purchased from their mini-market section next to the register. 

All the staple dishes are there: kaldereta, kare-kare, sisig, fried bangus, etc. I don't think they have a set menu, either. So you might not see some of the things I listed, but I'm pretty sure the popularly requested ones are always put out.

But the food was flavorful- I liked everything I tried (except the Ube cake). I wish the foods were labeled- I had no idea what I was eating. If there were labels, I don't remember seeing them. Luckily, I went with friends who could identify most of the dishes. 

This is the type of place I would prefer to visit to fill up containers with food that I would then take home to eat.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,5,1,2,ZGhM0ALCFOhagXBqg0FUSw

This place is a filipino buffet...just the way things are served at my family 'get-togethers';  there is a lot of food, it's always buffet style because we don't limit the food that's given to company...ever, and you cannot stop eating because the food is so good!

Seriously!  The food here is cooked as if I were at my mom's house and I lifted the pot lids to see what was cooking.  My mom always made food from fresh ingredients, never cooked from a recipe.

This next part may sound foreign and yeah, it is. I won't try to explain what these dishes are, just look at the picture! 

At this buffet, there is tinapa, pancit, pakbet, lichon paksiw, sago, and halo-halo.  You may have had to acquire a taste to these dishes to appreciate them, but nonetheless it's worth trying if you've never had filipino food. 

Wow!  I'm having visions of big spoons and forks hung over the dining table with a portrait of the last supper in black velvet texture!

Oh, and never mind the atmosphere - it's a dive and it's great!  You'll get the latest episode of filipino soap operas and can read the latest filipino newspaper that you see the same people in all the time.

$7 all you can eat buffet!  You can also take-out by pints and quarts at very reasonable prices.

I grew up eating it back home on Guam...my friends shared what they brought from home, etc.  So we make it a priority to have some almost every time we're out here in Vegas.  This time around, we had a couple Filipino friends with us who were more than happy to get some ""food"" with us since they live in the Pacific Northwest.

We settled on Nanay because of good ratings, it's AYCE and well-priced.  For the most part, it was very much worth it.  The offerings were very broad (though, to be fair, there were a few dishes that got old because of low turnover).

Standouts:  kare kare, miswa, bihon, sisig and dinuguan.  Pinakbet was good too but I added more bagoong to it.  I have to say - I'm glad it was AYCE because I (and my companions as well) destroyed the kare kare.  They probably saw a big dip in their kare kare stash when we were there.

They had an obligatory fruit section - I only ate the grapes, came across some mushy ones.

The wide variety was definitely a plus.  We didn't really encounter any service other than the stoic old man who sits near the restrooms and comes by to collect your tray every once in a while.

I can definitely see us coming back at some point.  Yum!",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,1,1,4,2S-sH9E9l4njOtTvX3TbJA

Everything you need, to include lechon, is in the food line, finished off with self serve rice. And like any good buffet, go back for as many trips as you like. Like I wrote though, if you have self control issues like I do, and you're on a diet, do NOT go here! Otherwise enjoy! It's truly a small piece of Filipino heaven.

My only complaints are limited seating and it's mainly a lunch place, so no late night grub runs can be made. Hence the 4 stars opposed to 5. It's really a 4.5 rating, though.

Not to mention while they were BBQing the restaurant turned super smokey! I am guessing that they don't have an exhaust hood! By the time I left I smelt like burnt BBQ! Oh and I guess the reason for all this is because the cook is sick! Ok while I wish him/her well, I do think that they should hire someone who knows how to cook just in case something happens!

After I got my food and sat down, the food I selected was luke warm at best, make you wonder at what the temperature the steam table is set at or if it is working properly at all. At the end I went to pay for my food, the same person that scuffed at my earlier request looked dumbfounded and said to me ""What?"". I was told I could pay for my food after I ate, so I want to pay for my food. ""Oh.""
