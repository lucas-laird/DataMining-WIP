The teriyaki bowls are fresh and you get a free miso soup too.  The service is reasonably fast.  Some items take longer to make but the simple items usually gets served to my table within a minute.  In addition, there are three televisions and two computers.  They usually let us have the remote control for one of the TVs.  It's perfect for watching games while having lunch.",_bOeJTRk4xmSE-L-xlGeTg,0,0,5,jJrLwl1bd0Z2QIV8e-AlJA

I guess in some ways it comes as no surprise. They slowly began to drop items (you used to get a slice of fruit with the various plate meals, then it was piece of red peppermint candy, then it was nothing), reduce portions (seemed that way at least), altogether stopped with customer services (in-house computer bar had been fully removed for at least a year) and prices slowly crept up.

Despite all of this, I really liked the place. The food was great, the place was always kept very clean and the lady that worked the counter was awesome. She always did an excellent job.   

My gut says the place going in is still owned by same owner and they are simply re-branding. We shall see!

I stayed safe and stuck with chicken: the chicken teriyaki/chicken katsu bento was very nicely proportioned. There wasn't too much of either item. All of their bentos come with steamed rice and a basic salad, of which the dressing was rather tasty; possibly a combination of ranch and sesame oil. You may ask for steamed brown rice instead. That's an extra $2.00 charge. As I was hungry, I ate everything in my box.

Their katsu sauce was definitely an improvement over the fair I get at L&L and Hawaiian A-Go-Go off of East Charleston and Sloan.

I recommend this place if you want to escape the oily fried foods you would experience elsewhere around UNLV. I will be back again to try something else. See you then!",8CRdokGFu_Y6ym5XnaKZVw,0,0,4,MGWp6kgBEViT4SEm8L-liQ
1383901,2013-08-16,0,pORB098NY_sSKkOQTMQuTQ,"Asides from the food being pretty delicious, it is quite convenient to come grab a bite since it is so close to school. Been here a good amount of times during my semesters and I really enjoy it here. I only listen to kpop most of the time and since this place plays the most updated music, what's not to love about music videos and food? The environment is always quite tidy and the lighting is a bit dimmed so to me it kind of gives off a cozy relaxed feeling that could perhaps pull off some stress from school. 

I've had their bibimbap, teriyaki chicken, udon noodles, some pieces of the sushi rolls, and the general tso chicken. Out of all the dishes, I can indulge in the general tso chicken almost every time I am here. I wish it was a little bigger, since i'm a big eater, so I have to take my time and slowly eat it so I can have a delayed onset of satisfaction that lasts.

I'd recommend this place 100% if you go to UNLV;  if not then just stop by if you're around the area and love Kpop/Asian food.  Oh and the owner manager big boss lady is also really really really nice. When I was a regular, she'd always give me the biggest and warmest welcome.

The ribs are brought out on a steaming pan type of tray. It was very good but they don't give you that much. For the price, I'd expect more.

Small discrepancies with a few things my boyfriend and I ordered. We ordered the Wok special teriyaki chicken, orange chicken, and curry chicken katzu. The teriyaki chicken was in my opinion great flavor but my boyfriend said it was too charred for his taste. He is korean and I know he knows asian food better than me. We both agreed the orange chicken had too much breading and not enough chicken. My boyfriend would have liked his to come with a side of some kind of vegetables.Last but not least my curry chicken katzu. The order came with rice, katzu, and a side salad.

2182204,2011-12-19,0,pORB098NY_sSKkOQTMQuTQ,"This place is a little family-owned and operated restaurant tucked away into a strip mall just across from UNLV.  It's very unpretentious from the outside, but the inside!  Immaculate interior, sweet staff, and Hello Kitty curtains separating the kitchen area from the front counter area!  TV's featuring Korean pop are on pretty much all the time and there is even a computer with free internet access in the back of the restaurant.  The bathroom is one of the cutest I've ever seen: again, immaculate, and boasting a mid-purple tone on the upper half of the walls with white tiles on the lower half.  Black and white tiles form a checkerboard pattern on the floor and gilt mirrors are above the sink and on the opposite wall.  (I know, it's weird to describe a bathroom, but it really made an impression on me.  And, it is really cute.)

The food: order from the Korean part of the menu.  I've only ever had the Korean food and it's always good.  Yes, it's pricier, but the portions are generous and everything is made to order.  I had the daeji bulgogi (bbq-ed pork) and the hubby had the kimchi dolsot bibimbap.  Both were sizzling hot and tasty.  Hubby particularly enjoyed the ""crispy bits of rice"" in his dish.

2244496,2011-08-09,0,pORB098NY_sSKkOQTMQuTQ,"I was really hoping Teriyaki Time would be better than my initial expectations but that didn't quite happen. Based on the restaurant's name I figured to try the Chicken Teriyaki with Gyoza. Most of the bento box was about average, nothing too impressive but at the same time not horrible. However I have to say that the salad they gave me was quite disappointing since the dressing they used seemed kind of cheap based on the looks of it. I also wished that the portions would have been bigger especially considering the overall quality of the food.

To be fair, the lady working at the restaurant seemed nice based on first impression and it's right near campus so I'll give it a benefit of a doubt for those reasons only.

2732707,2010-05-28,0,pORB098NY_sSKkOQTMQuTQ,"Teriyaki Time is one of those places that tries too hard to sell what they think the people will buy, therefore losing it's identity in the process. But it's still food that does the job and at cheap prices. 

It does have teriyaki, but I have this rule that I rarely eat teriyaki outside of my home as I grew up with it and have found that not many places that sell it make it ""right"" or even good. Also, I think teriyaki is way overrated as a food in itself. Also, they have other Japanese dishes that are usually easy to find at your average ""oriental"" mom and pop places like tempura dishes, bentos and bento combos that's served with your everyday California roll and miso soup. All this stuff isn't bad for the price, but you certainly get what you pay for. 

What IS surprising about this place is the Korean food. There's a Korean food menu that has kimchee bibimbap, the regular-ish-type of bibimbap that doesn't come in a hot, stone pot, galbi, bulgogi, and soondubu, and a few more things I'm sure I'm forgetting. Considering most of my usual Korean places are clear across town and/or too far to drive to on my lunch break, this is a gem of a find. 

The first time I delved into their Korean food menu, I tried the kimchee bibimbap and it was uber tasty. Sizzling hot, tangy, and spicy. And it was the good kind of spicy where you had to wipe your forehead every few minutes, which tells you that the heat level is just right. The second time I got the soondubu which was also pretty good. I asked the lady to clarify if it was just the beef soondubu or if it was a mix of beef and seafood. She said it was actually seafood only, which I didn't want, and I asked if they could make it beef only. She had to ask the chef/cook in the back if they could make it like that, and he agreed. It was pretty good considering it cost almost $2 less than the soondubu at Mr. Tofu, but the soondubu at Mr. Tofu still takes the cake. 

Overall, pretty good for the Korean food, but just ""meh"" for the other stuff.",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,0,0,3,LiAd9pV5cvQpDrFMmEoJ2g
2741655,2013-10-12,6,pORB098NY_sSKkOQTMQuTQ,"WHAT TIME IS IT? Sorry, had to say it. Anyways, I have always had a soft spot for teriyaki places so when I saw these guys I was excited to try them out.

Originally I was gonna give them 2 stars because I have actually had better. But since this was my first time, I will give them the benefit of the doubt.

Since I don't usually eat breakfast (I know, people tell me that's a bad thing), when lunch comes around, I am starving. So I ordered the Chicken n Beef Combo Bento. Comes with one scoop of rice and salad. 

This is where thoughts of 2 stars were dancing in my head. When I received my food, everything was lukewarm. Believe it or not, the teriyaki sauce they give you in a squeeze bottle was actually hotter than my entrée. The salad was decent, which was I thought was better than the beef and chicken. Kind of sad if you ask me. Lastly, the portions were not much. At some other places, I get almost twice as much food for what I paid for which was around 9 and some change. After I got done, I admit, I was not all the way full, like I can eat so much more.

Im hoping my next visit will be much better because I am gonna order a different entrée. If it disappoints again, it's going down to 2 stars. 

Some positive notes are that the place is pretty spacious, they take cards, and the wifi is free.

In closing, I will try them again, that is, if Cugino's Deli doesn't call my name.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,11,8,3,RzA1dik8aIuKg4t7WaiEcw

My favorite thing off the menu is the curry katsu. The curry rice is good too when i'm not as hungry. I've tried the ramen and california roll combo- the ramen is seemingly a spicy top ramen. Not very good, but the california roll tasted home-made and was refreshing. Bibimbap was pretty okay too. I'm a sucker for Japanese comfort food and quiet ambiance.

Hearing the owners speak, I knew it was Korean owned, so why not just get something korean instead of some of the Japanese foods they sell here? 

I ended up getting bulgogi, which was a little different from from other places i have had it but it was still very good. The inside was dimly lit which I enjoyed. They have a large tv playing K-pop when I was there so you get something great to watch.

Its the best Asian food in that area that I found, so I recommend it if your near UNLV .",LJLoIfcfsaRnizaKCPBx6A,0,0,3,5HlNqFRuAGuxQaJHDZ_GjA
5005644,2014-08-14,0,pORB098NY_sSKkOQTMQuTQ,I wanted to love the ramen for my craving fix but couldn't literally lol. So salty I felt like I was digging into a pile of salt in a cereal bowl. The staff are really unwelcoming and intimidating. Definitely not going back here sadly despite the endless Korean dish selection due to my bad experience.,_Y1CZq2b8T9T3d2N3PNfkA,0,0,1,ncHONhbtJpMUC3rP61BTaQ
5075359,2012-09-23,6,pORB098NY_sSKkOQTMQuTQ,"Decided to have lunch here while i kill time waiting for my appointment. This place is located right across UNLV. Next to the Laundry shop.

Location is good you can't miss this place. Service is great with a friendly staff and the atmosphere is great as well.

They have free wifi which is a plus for all the students or anyone conducting business. Along with a Tv with Korean music playing, which is awesome.
I'm not Korean, but im a big fan of their food and culture. Been there at least 3 times.

The food is great. I usually get the Bento plates. The plates i usually get include teriyaki chicken with bulgogi along with tempura, salad, rice and  miso soup all for 10$ +

It is a little pricey for what i'm normally used to but overall this place is ok.( I guess you can call me CHEAP.. sometimes :) And food is average still ok.. I would go back if i was in the area since it's the only korean/japanese place i know located near UNLV.

Overall i give it a three star because i have had better, but i'm still willing to dine again with this establishment. Just convenient if your in the area craving japnese/korean food.",r2R9t9_0Je8wP-wh4-xM3w,8,7,3,iThpYzgyTLbJXklvnKJaMA
5148561,2012-02-28,0,pORB098NY_sSKkOQTMQuTQ,"This place is Yuuuuummy! It is located across the street from UNLV in a little plaza. Teriyaki Time is one of those restaurants where you can go there to eat a couple times and feel welcome and part of the family. Every time I go there the main cashier  always asks where I've been and how my classes have been. Knowing that an employee of any restaurant remembers me always makes me feel welcome! I have two main dishes that I order there. The Udon and the curry katsu. Both are very filling and reasonably priced. 

I recommend ordering the Udon if you want to eat on the lighter side, but still want something tasty and filling. The broth is perfectly seasoned and the noodles are always plentiful.

The curry katsu is delicious, but be warned, pretty filling. If you have never tried curry katsu before, I recommend you do. 

Still need more convincing? They are always playing some of the latest K-Pop music videos. A little SNSD and Big Bang should be enough to bring you into the restaurant and enjoy your time.",Nh-ztLj1IxS8ROHQqDFSiQ,2,1,4,y_88mbwcT_fC_SgzaDcJng

The staff was as pleasant as an enema and the place smelled like someone had crapped under every table.  To the staff.  I told you I was a Yelper!!!

Craving: Korean
Price range: I got money in the bank but...yeah I'm really cheap.
Location: Must be walking distance from UNLV.

N&N or Teriyaki Time? I went with TT because it looked newer and I NEEDED some bibimbap. Like, STAT. I'd have to say that Korean is my favorite asian food and there's definitely not enough Korean food near UNLV or Henderson and that makes my cravings more intense. 

After browsing the Yelp reviews, I decided to order the kimchi dolsot bimimbap. It was good, but wasn't the best I've ever had. I wasn't happy about the $10 price tag and another $2 for a bottle of water because they don't give free tap water. No bueno and that makes it lose a star. 

The K-Pop videos and Korean food made this Japanese named restaurant an interesting, but filling meal.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,1,1,3,26GuGJk5TpJn4vecCpEAkw

I am a fan of getting the bento boxes. It's more than a full meal for about $7.00: comes with miso soup, salad, rice, your entree choice, and orange slices. I am a fan of the spicy Teriyaki chicken. Woooooohoo, SO spicy.. 

As said before they have plenty of food when you order the bentos. I would prefer getting this over a bowl. It's a great place to just sit and have the dine-in experience without the dine-in experience as you pay first, then eat. 

Another thing, I like having water with all my meals, no matter the meal. And because this place is not considered a sit down restaurant, you get your own drink. Instead of getting some dinky little water cup, they have real, human cups that are open for you to refill again and again when you get the spicy Korean zing!",xvtBlzl5ZPgrGiWLA97bGQ,1,0,4,X2g24oxjyj6HSwVMd90Gaw
5797198,2011-11-29,0,pORB098NY_sSKkOQTMQuTQ,"This is one of those hole in the wall restaurants of Vegas nobody really cares to notice. Not to say the place is rundown either, the restaurant has big screen televisions with the news and music videos playing from Korea and Japan, and it is nicely designed with the decor and the seating. Large parties are able to be accommodated here. 

The food might seem pricey, but you honestly get what you pay for, and sometimes even a little bit more. The food is always fresh, and I love the different variety of hot tea you can choose from (the portion size is large too, so you get a lot!) The only thing that I noticed change in was the smoothies they have, they seem a lot more watered down now than they used to be. Regardless, I love TT for the fact it's different from the other restaurants in the area, and the place to go when you want a little more ethnicity to eat.",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,0,0,4,-VT4m2aEsL1bGmoPQ3quOg

I ordered the Bento Lunch with Chicken Teriyaki and Gyoza, both were delicious and I was a bit confused at first as to where to sit and whether or not to grab utensils, but was directed properly. 

I'm always out of place when I go eat by myself. Delicious food nonetheless and will come back for good eats!",ANLSKvFmCgRMjxtELq70FQ,1,1,4,Z5A3BUQ1QdSgL6yO3vRZOw
