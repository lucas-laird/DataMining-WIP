I places my order and a young lady let me know it would be a couple minutes for fries and then a guy rung me up. As I was sitting and waiting the guy brings my food to my table and Thanks me again for my business. Then the girl double checked with me to make sure I received everything okay. I wish I would have asked their names but thank you to your staff.,i4tv-UahXGYDcadX3rRgWA,0,0,5,c_BY2brYFB5k2sdND543eA
1399061,2017-10-29,0,86xm0Q8iX5ZjODWMkvwnxA,We stopped in at this Popeyes on the strip to grab a quick bite to eat. Once we got back to our hotel which wasn't far the food was not very fresh. My husband and I got a personal order together and needless to say we still didn't finish it after sharing. The fries were so cold and disgusting. The chicken was just ok and the red beans and rice didn't have a good ratio of cold rice and beans. It was super thick. Not going back,CEBadvlLgCDB_DxzpSFObw,0,0,2,NfCojw2Bfp1L8cNVC7RpUg

1672235,2018-01-11,1,86xm0Q8iX5ZjODWMkvwnxA,"12 bucks for a 3piece chicken meal is appalling since the 3 pieces were anemic & closer to dry chewy small dwarf drummettes. Service was friendly. But g-dam what a ripoff! I think it took me a total of 5 bites to kill all 3 pieces. Those commercials by Mama Popeye sure is a ponzi scam...

Signature Biscuit was decent & the sweet tea was refreshing.

When I first placed my order there was only one couple ahead of me. After waiting 30 mins, I went up to ask how much longer it was going to take for the food to be ready and the worker basically yelled at me that there was no more chicken and that I had to wait. I saw this happen to another customer that asked the same question. Eventually the worker yelled that ""I can't rush the chicken, do you want this shit raw"".

2803948,2017-03-23,0,86xm0Q8iX5ZjODWMkvwnxA,"If I could give no stars I would. This Popeyes sucks, and is the worst part of my vacation. The employees are more concerned about closing then they are well paying customers. My mother ordered at 10:40 and they close at 11. After about thirty minutes of waiting in line AND PAYING for the order at 11pm they tell us they do not have our food because we did not order at the beginning. Why would you charge somebody ""who didn't order"". They gave the order to another person. I guess the manager Liz gave us a refund but it did not compensate for the time wasted on our vacation. They showed no empathy and did not want to even try to make our order so they didn't have to reclean and get our faster. If that's your manager not helping customers, then you're losing a plethora of revenue. This Popeyes sucks, if you want food DONT GO HERE. They handle money and touch food which is also a violation as well. They were very rude and hostile. No compensation, no sorrow just all cashiers, food prep and managers ready to get home early. You can even check cameras on how they roll there eyes and how my mom NOT ONCE give them the piece of mind they deserve. Especially after a manager saying ""I DONT CARE"" when we payed, after a lot of attitude we got refund. Check CCTV, cameras will see the way they even slam the doors closed to keep people out; minutes prior from closing. Mind you there was about seven people after my mom, and they turned them away. You guys should fix this and relate to all reviews stated here. Don't work customer service and food if you're miserable, no need to make customers be the same as you.",PmJEG8wiEF2RijixhvfDQA,1,1,1,2EpagGDONwDe5oJ6sKeTDA

The ladies/employees were soooo nice. The manager looked like a girl I worked with, so immediately started talking to her as if she was her. I enjoyed my encounter and had a friendly experience with these employees. The chicken was hot, crispy and crunchy just like it's supposed to be. The taters and gravy, red beans and rice, fries and popcorn shrimp was spot on. I will definitely be back to this location next time I'm in Vegas.

4831424,2017-11-20,0,86xm0Q8iX5ZjODWMkvwnxA,"Worst customer service ever! We stopped by this place because I had a major craving for fried chicken and saw it on our way. Boy, that was a wrong decision! Not only does this place overcharge but the employees' rude attitude was what made it unbearable. We ordered the 16pc combo-spicy and was told by the guy who rang us up that the wait would be 15 mins, we were fine with it. Then about 5 mins after our first order, we went up to order another two combos because we thought there might not be enough food. There were 3 workers behind the counter and yet all of them ignored us because they were talking to this one employee from Walgreen. If my brother in law didn't call to their attention, we would have waited for a while. Nonetheless, we disregarded and went ahead to order our chicken tenders. 30 minutes later, they still didn't call our order but I saw them handing out chicken tenders to other customers who placed their order after us. My brother in law decided to come up and ask when our order would be ready and this one girl Shay snatched the receipt from him, took a look at it and raised her voice at him saying that 'we told you it would take 15 mins', then slammed the receipt on top of the counter. That obviously ticked off my sister as she told pumpkin Shay that we waited for half an hour already. She then proceeded to throw our chicken pieces into the box and wouldn't stop even when her coworker (the guy who rang us up) snudged her; she even shoved his hands away. Obviously, her mood turned sour afterward and we noticed she was being totally rude to other customers as well. So now we can't even tell whether Shay was just being racist to us because we were the only Asian group there or she was just a crazy dawg that pretty much barked at every person who came her way. Regardless, that's not how she should serve her customers. Long gone was the day she came in for an interview and was asked situational questions on how to handle certain incidents. I agree that I can't expect 5-Star service at Popeye but I am certain that we don't deserve this kind of treatment either. She paid with money to get our food, we didn't beg for it. Whoever the manager of this store is should either get fired for allowing such behaviors at their store (anyone can tell that this isn't the first time Shay throws her tantrum, she must have done it a lot of times for her not to give a crap about anyone anymore) or retrains his/her employees. Maybe we can try and post on Facebook how Shay mistreated her customers and hopefully the manager is smart enough to pinpoint what goes wrong and perhaps they can start educating Shay to stop biting every hand that feeds her and start acting like she's in the customer service industry for once.",ybnZCrlLprGtM7_AUuyEnw,0,0,1,ReSWKcIEYZUUrYIBdwWvgQ

Hours later, we made a point of coming back over.  Place not too busy.  Hubby ordered 4 pieces spicy with mashed potatoes.  He didn't declare white meat or dark meat.

Our friends ordered spicy all dark meat with fries.

We get back to our timeshare to chow down.  Our friends opened their box to find it's a combo of dark & white. With the fries.

Hubby opened his, and it's all dark.  With his mashed potatoes.

Now how can the folks at Popeye's mess up?  On top of each box, the order was marked correctly. Probable cause - too many workers standing around and not paying attention.
