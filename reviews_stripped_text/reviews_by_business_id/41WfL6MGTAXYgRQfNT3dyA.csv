32535,2012-09-01,2,41WfL6MGTAXYgRQfNT3dyA,Worst place to grab a late dinner. I showed up at around 11:45pm on 8/31/12 to grab a last minute dinner not knowing they closed at 11pm and nobody even cared to assist me or tell me that they closed down the register. Tell me something instead of having me wait while half your staff sits on their butts by the trash cans.

More like a paste. Chips are always stale and they never get my order right.

As far as fast food goes, I feel like this place is one of the best.  Everything I have eaten here has been excellent.  I especially lik ethe newer burritos.  They have a spicy chipotle burrito that is especially good.  I recommend the chicken nachos, but you should eat in for those because they use a queso cheese that will qucikly make the chips soggy if you take it to go.  They have a salsa bar with this delicious avocado salsa, as well as hot and mild salsas.  I also like the fact that almost every week I get coupons in the mail from El Pollo Loco which helps me save some money.  The chicken is flavorful, the portions are high, and the cost is about the same as anywhere else.  If I had any complaints it would be that the seating in this particular place is a little tight.",-PHC1ulwHkY4LEmMqmFwPg,1,1,5,xtwzKnVTJstJCGEeJLqdyA

When I went in the place looked disheveled. The salsa bar had not been wiped down, there was drippings everywhere. It looked as though the dining area had not been wiped down either. 

Next, I wanted to keep on their ""value menu"" so I ordered a taco al carbon, which they are pretty good. I also ordered the value menu side salad. I specifically said ""side salad"", which to me would indicate the fact I want a SIDE SALAD. Well, I didn't get a side salad, the cashier charged me for the salad that is $3.49. I didn't realize it until I sat down and looked at my receipt. But by this time I was just like, ""Eff it, I'll eat a bigger salad"". Nothing wrong with more veggies in my opinion.

Food - eeehhh. The salad was not cold like a salad should be. It was kind of strange temperature-wise, like maybe the salad had been siting out and someone forgot to put it back into cool-storage. Or maybe they're running their temps for the salad prep station too high. Either way, it was not good.

I'd say be wary of the salad items here... something fishy is going on...",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,2,dz-qahW4SFKUQLUkI0th_w

4654974,2015-09-12,4,41WfL6MGTAXYgRQfNT3dyA,"El Pollo loco is the Spanish word for crazy chicken. After spending hours hiking in Fletcher Canyon then driving across the valley, I felt like an el pollo loco. I was dying of hunger in a part of the Warm Springs corridor where there really isn't many restaurants. After a few year hiatus of dining in an El Pollo Loco, I'd choose this one as my post - hike dinner.

  On a Saturday night, it was calm. A line was nonexistent. I ordered the two piece breast and wing that included two sides and two corn tortillas and a small drink (self-serve refills) for less than  $9. The chicken was good but not GREAT. I'd take Raising Canes or broaster chicken over this in a heartbeat. Regardless, I have nothing bad to write about the chicken. The two side dishes that I complimented the chicken with were rice and cole slaw. I enjoyed the side dishes as much as the three star chicken.

   After leaving El Pollo loco filled up and no longer feeling like a dying of hunger el pollo loco, I walked to my car with the impression that my meal was good but short of the greatness of a Chick Fil-A or Raising Caines.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,8,6,3,6c9wVf5YE4c9ZXoVZ3-JqA

I give the cashier a confused look and he gives me a confused look right back. After a few minutes the manager comes out of the office and is still on the phone with ""my wife"". In short, she is confused because she thinks that the person on the phone is me and they had uber food and even though i told her several times that the order was mine and I'm picking it up and even showed her my confirmation number she was still having trouble understanding what was going on.
