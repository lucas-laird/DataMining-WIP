In the last year ive noticed food takes so long to make, noone is polite or friendly here, frappes are blended to liquid consistency or have large ice chunks in it.  Everyone seems bored to death in there. Sometimes takes over 10 mins or more just to order the food and then get to the window to pay. No phone calls back despite phoning them more than once. Most employees need the manager or supervisor to make a drink for them. its a mess.

Also saw rats run by multiple times outside.. not sure if its an issue inside but I haven't gone here in couple months due to the terrible service! lost me as a customer and now go to another mcdonald's.

935105,2016-04-06,0,LBwFjTUlDeikknOoQTXxhg,"I never bother to write reviews for fast food chains, but this might actually be the worst McDonald's in the nation. Long story short, if you don't care about the details, go to the McD on Buffalo and Charleston instead. 

For those that do care about the details, here it goes. I've used to live in this area, and my office is right across the street, so in moments of desperation, usually every few months, I will come to this location. Every time I come, I hope that they've made the proper changes to fix all of their problems with staff, quality and cleanliness. Every time I leave, I realize how dumb I was to try it out again.

First off, the Coca Cola has never tasted right. I'm talking since 2008, this location has NEVER had a proper tasting Coke. It tastes like one of their employees accidentally plugged in a Dr. Pepper and they never bothered to clean the line. If they did clean it, then they immediately made the same mistake again. All of their Coke has the same hint of root beer/bubble gum flavor, and never has the right levels of carbonation or syrup.

Secondly, the fryer oil is disgusting. That's why your fries and nuggets are dark brown instead of golden and taste burned. I guarantee that this location does NOT change their fryer oil as frequently as they should. 

Thirdly, I'm pretty sure this location is where McD sends all of their worst employees. Think of every incompetent person you've ever had give you the wrong order. They all now work at this location. No ketchup? Try extra ketchup. No pickles? How about one pickle hidden in the exact center of the burger. Special order? Good luck getting even half of it right. 

Now, I understand that McD is never going to be great, but if you look at the other locations in town, they average about 3 stars. This place is at 1 1/2 stars for a reason. They need to clean house, and I mean literally clean the entire building. Then fire everyone who works there and start again from scratch.",BwoZMzp8iqeNFwGMhS25Dw,1,0,1,bFaz7OQFev-EcV_-sIWHoQ

THE worst experience at fast food place, what a joke!!!!!

Pulled up to the drive thru behind a 5 car lane.
It literally took about 20 mins for each car to pull up and move forward!

My turn came.. Started ordering..
Guy disappears .... 10 mins later says ""Hello?!"" rudely!
Only to get what I was saying wrong.
Ordered a McMuffin, Kids Meal, Fries and two coffees.. Waited another 5 mins by the paying window.

Same employee opens the window, gave him my card, then he says ""we cannot accept card payments at the moment"". I asked him, obviously with the little patience I already had, where did it say they were not accepting card payments, or why did they not mention it upon pulling up to the drive thru BEFORE taking the order?!? 

He goes to get the manager, she says the same thing, so I said the same thing! They couldn't say anything else besides they couldn't take cards. No apologies or anything for not having a sign up nor warning people before.

AND these are the people who complain about minimum wage.. PSHHHH..

Everything is ghetto about this location. The staff, the customers, the service, everything. Even the wifi seems ghetto. My guess is that upon entering, you will have a mixture of feelings that involve uncomfortableness, frustration, and even a bit of fear. You WILL run into the ghetto fabulous princess who thinks she can get extra cheeseburgers for free because she has 4 kids with her. You WILL have to wait in line for this because they will never have more than one person service. You WILL have to wait an unusually long time for your food to come out even after you order. You WILL wish you took your food to go. You WILL wish you never used the restrooms here. You WILL understand why they lock the door from the outside for the entrance facing Rainbow.

Today they like to think of themselves as hip slick and cool pawning off god knows what kinda meat that is. This was the absolute WORST visit I have ever made to McDonalds. I was in a rush wanted to grab something quick as i was already late for a meeting about 1 minute away. I pull up order cant understand a word through the universal translator.I pull up and this kid was on drugs or is a paint huffer on the reg. Takes him about 3 minutes to figure my correct total and order at the window. I pull up wait another 8 minutes and am handed the wrong order. Then I am told to pull around to the front and wait for ""fresh"" fries. Pull to front,15 minutes later i get out of my car to get my order and it is coming out. I ask for ketchup and pepper,sorry sir we are out of both...WTF? you guys have one job make sure there are basics to accompany that nasty food you serve so i don't feel as though i'm eating a dog shit sandwich. Anyways,I get to my destination sure the fries were lava hot and my big mac was an fing train wreck. Cold,tasted like total crap I suspect it been sitting there since the last ice age. and to complete my abused visit I felt like i was gonna hurl afterwards.
