40841,2012-04-27,0,Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ,Just got the nicely nicelys pizza and a large fry. Pizza is amazing. Juicy flavorful chicken yummy mushrooms and big chunks of garlic. Ingredients were so good. Crust was perfect too.  Fries are just regular crinkle ones but atleast they were good!

89413,2016-03-31,0,Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ,This is one of my favorite cravings spots for sandwiches. I've tried quite a few of them and have yet to be disappointed by any. Their pizza looks great but I haven't personally tried one but based on these other reviews I may have to check a couple of those out too. Not to mention one of my favorite desserts is right in the same shopping center.,uO1H7UBqSsuWL9x-lmQIzw,0,0,4,DfhXrJJScWxr7tuTrlBWDQ
106343,2012-01-04,0,Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ,"This place has gone downhill significantly, sadly!!!  When we lived in this part of town some years back, we ate here occasionally, the pizza & service was always decent, good enough to enjoy once in awhile.  Then we moved across town so we didn't go as often, it wasn't convenient.  Over the past few years, the few times we went, it was okay... the sauce seemed different, but it was okay... good enough to eat, nothing to get excited about.  So we didn't go for quite some time.  The one thing that was always... always the same, when we ordered pepperoni, each square slice had 3 or 4 pieces of pepperoni on it.  Each time, we'd say ""dang, next time we need to order double pepperoni"" because I like lots more on my slices.  But we always forgot to order it that way.
A couple of weeks ago, we were trying to decide what to eat, and I thought of Nathan's... we decided to give them another try, since it had been quite a while.  I actually remembered about the pepperoni this time, so we ordered a medium with DOUBLE pepperoni & light sauce... nothing else.
Our pizza arrives... with 4 pieces of pepperoni on each slice... umm double??  But worse, the cheese was overpowering, it was like triple the normal amount of cheese.  When we said something, they argued & said ""That IS double"" and when we asked about the cheese, he said ""Yeah, I put on extra cheese for you""... WHY?  We didn't ask for ""extra"" cheese, we don't LIKE a TON of cheese!   I said ""this is not double, unless you've cut way back to only 2 pieces on each slice... we've always gotten 3-4 pieces per slice... this is nowhere near double. Paying for double should have had at least 5-6 pieces of pepperoni per slice.  The cook was very rude, took the pizza, grabbed a huge handful of cold pepperoni and dumped it all over the pizza... so now we had way too much, and it wasn't cooked into the pizza at all.  Because of being loaded down with cheese, it didn't taste too great either... all we could taste was cheese.  We ate just enough so we weren't starving anymore, and we  left the rest.
Extremely disappointing visit... each time over the years has gotten worse, but this was the very worst!  Really bad service and terrible pizza!  They should have offered to re-make the pizza with the correct cheese & correct pepperoni, or refunded our money, they could have at the very least apologized... but no, they just get nasty & rude!  Very sad... they used to be a good, family run place... now just rude people making wrong pizzas and then they refuse to fix them when they screw up.  We won't be back again, they've used up their second & third chances, each time worse than the last.",3ebfZkfUcJC6NaeCeNhgLg,2,0,1,IMzS82RKk0cgtQ8mQQeMzQ

188838,2011-11-24,0,Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ,"Was here Sunday night for dinner.  I decided to try it because I had a gift certificate from Restaurant.com and I heard it was good pizza.  The restaurant is on the corner of Lake Mead and Buffalo next to smash burger.  Inside is pretty cool. They have a bar and booth seating with the walls decorated in Detroit sports stuff, and theres like at least 10 nice flat screens all over and a giant projector screen.  Most had the sunday games on, 1 had the nascar race, and 1 even had cartoon network (there were a couple tables with kids). 

So when you arrive you order at the window and just find a seat anywhere with your number. The fountain drinks are self service, I didn't order any beer so I'm not sure how the tab for that goes. (Too bad they aren't self service...amirite?)  Anyway we ordered a large appetizer sampler and a tri sampler pizza. The pizza is 9 squares and you can get 4 toppings of w/e on each row of 3. Pretty cool for sampling.  I got one with chicken bacon garlic and onion and it was the shit. Along with our 2 fountain drinks and minus my gift certificate, we ended up paying 20 bucks, or 10 each.  

The food was enough for 2 EXTREMELY hungry people, or like 4 people that are normal. The appetizer sampler was a bed of crinkle fries with 4 huge onion rings, 4 shrimp poppers, 4 chicken wings, 4 chicken tenders, 4 mozzarella sticks. I think thats it.  The onion rings are tasty but the onion was very thick cut.  Everything else was kind of standard fare.  The pizza was very good. Not extremely greasy and the toppings are good quality. The crust had a nice crunch to it as well. 

I'll be back if I'm in the area for sure because its good food and good value.",0jh6FM1kd6ecYs1ESjFZKA,1,0,4,5HRX8JrZlpiqedyOGgPKhw

Northside Nathan's is clearly underrated. The Motor -city style pizza is not round but square with a nice thin layer of tomato sauce followed by a great loving portion of cheese. Add whatever toppings you want to keep it simple or check out their signature pizza like the ""Guys & Dolls"" or the ""Gangsters Choice."" If you aren't a pizza fan (which I don't see why you wouldn't be) make sure you check out the rest of their menu! My own vital tip is beware repping other teams at Northside Nathans.

despite other Expert Defensive Yelpers opinions who trust sites like Wikipedia (which is written by other self proclaimed experts)...who know all about what the pizza scene is like in Detroit I say to you this.......

square rectangle round and even heart shaped pizza can be found a plenty out there...the deep pan is a Chicago thing that is sprinkled around in Detroit area.. these guys do it square and the pan style was super fresh and had a great great great crust like normal. 

Latest try was Sky Masterson... Anti Pasta (bit too acidic for me but huge portion nonetheless)  This personal pan was so so good.  

Just wish there were more herbs going on to intensify the flavors - the sauce is just a smidge too sweet on each tray but I understand why they do it.. this is def a kids/family spot.

I wasn't able to go pick up the order and when I called they told me that it was going to be an hour and a half before they could deliver it because of so many deliveries of head of mine. I said that's fine I would just save the pizzas for the next day I needed to make my kids dinner and they didn't want to wait any longer.  I felt bad because my order had been sitting there for 20 minutes due to my mistake and I was wondering where it was. And then I saw on my email saying it was ready for pick up.  I was a little bummed that my pizza wasn't gonna show up until two hours after it's made. However, It was delivered 10 minutes after I hung up. The pizzas were still hot the salad was still fresh everything was delicious.

We have only had the thick crust pizza, cheese bread, salads, and wings. The wings are the best because they come without sauce and everyone can dump as much hot sauce on that they want so there is no arguing over how spicy to order them.

My favorite part is that you order up at the counter and fill your own drinks.

Your classic vision of hot wings can remain buckled in the car, because Nathans is serving up a mini version of deep fried chicken! Plain, crispy, thick n' juicy wings that you'll have to squirt the hot sauce on yourself...but don't bother, instead dredge them in their ranch dressing which is full of garlic!

Not only did the wings get dunked, but I smothered my pan-style pizza crust in their ranch as well. So much so that I left with offensive breath and a garlic hangover the next morning that I (almost happily) couldn't shake. 

Pros:
*Very casual dining, neat décor, the pizza cheese is the kind that actually strings about  2 feet when you serve a slice, lil' bar in the back, DID I MENTION WINGS?

Cons:
* Very casual dining, terrible music, lack of pizza sauce and minimal toppings, french fries are too identical to Ore Ida, first timers aren't so sure where/what to do (ex: place order at window, grab silverware, sit down).",SPo3N__DoDyzryGXWWS1IQ,3,0,4,UwkUZvCvj2f0Eab6lQn0kA

The pizza was not the way it's made in Detroit.  Crust was too crispy, with no flavor.  It was more on the thinner side than the typical Detroit style crust. They didn't skimp on the toppings and it did have a good amount of sauce and cheese on it.  Problem I'm finding is outside of Detroit most places seem to make the Detroit style pizza crust too crisp.  The crust needs to be crisp with buttery caramelized edges that are soft when you bite into it.   I have been accused of being a pizza snob so maybe I'm overly picky but it didn't do anything for me.  The other people in my group ordered a regular hand tossed pizza and I found that to be better.  Nathan's is decorated with cool Detroit memorabilia and a colorful mural of the city with popular landmarks on the back wall.

I love their wings for it's lightly breaded crust, which is crispy to perfection. And the meat is always tender and juicy for being the dark meat. I guess the only downfall is their prices are moderate for a limited number of wings.

I love ranch, so I guess that makes me a ranch connoisseur. Thus, I love their ranch. It has this garlicy hint to it. I usually mix it with a little bit of the buffalo sauce. And to upgrade my fries, I smother em with parmesan cheese. 

I've never been to Chicago, but it definitely has that kind of vibe. It's great for families and they have huge servings. Not only are the wings great, but their pizza is mighty tasty as well.

1942438,2013-04-03,1,Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ,"I really really would not recommend this place. I came here because they offered deep dish pizza and I've read about Detroit style pizza not too long ago. I thought I'd give it a try. I ordered an 11 inch deep dish pizza with pepperoni and sausage and wings

The pizza is, imo, on the cheaper side (in quality). The sauce isn't very spectacular. It tastes pre-packaged and you cannot taste almost any herbs in the sauce. It also doesn't taste really fresh. I noticed a chunk of dry oregano in the sauce but it didn't seem to add any flavor. The cheese is spread kinda thinly to boot, so you end up tasting more of the bread. It also does not have any particular flavor. Neither the pepperoni or the sausage stood out. Honestly the pepperoni and sausage toppings in Pizza Hut has more flavor. The crust is decent but that's as far as the positives go. The only saving grace for this place was the wings. They're done well but a place that bases its business on pizza shouldn't have better wings than pizza.

 I don't know how they manage to make an awful pizza. It's on par with cafeteria/frozen pizza. Think Tombstone. Red Baron would be a step up above this place.  Go anywhere else. Glazier's grocery store is miles better than this pizza and better too. $7-8 versus $14 for a two person pizza. Sam's Club is better. The gas station pizza at Snacker's is better. Anywhere else but here. Save your money and take your business elsewhere. You'll thank me for it.",CvfrgJUaMAwD3ALeKGgJ4A,0,0,2,X9QNJ9JhwKRgilNCkcQ2sA

The pizza here is delicious. We've ordered in and takeout (never delivered -so can't comment on that). It's always cooked through, no soggy crust, good toppings, and not super greasy. We usually order the regular deep dish style, but they also offer a thin crust. The wings are served naked and crispy, but come w a tasty wing sauce on the side. The wing sauce is a nice addition to you pizza too. Sandwiches are served here, which I can't vouch for firsthand, but I've been assured are quite good as well. They have a bar, where you can get cheap beer to wash down that pizza pie. 

The service is minimal, but acceptable here. Order at the counter and pay. They'll bring your food to you. Self serve drinks, plates, etc. And they will clean the table. I like this type of service for a joint like this, as they wont dote on you. Just grab your pizza and beer and have some dinner.

Our friends that are originally from Las Vegas love it too!

We also get their Caesar Salad- which is good.  Salad & Pizza- can it get any better?  

Its definitely a casual place, refill your own drinks, but they serve your food and they clean up your table when you leave.  You never feel rushed and you could hang out for a while.

Before we left for the Expo we had been planning on checking this place out but we honestly didn't really have too high of hopes for it.  We found a couple of pictures of their pizza online and didn't think we would be impressed.

Well, we could have not been further from being right on this place. The second we walked in we were greeted by the owners and shown some good ole Detroit hospitality. No they didn't try to sell us guns, drugs, join their gang, or any other dumb Detroit comment you can think of. These folks were warm and welcoming. The place just felt like we were back home.  The place was loaded with some great Detroit sports memorabilia and some big screen TVs.  The dining room was anchored by a very nice and well thought out mural of Detroit as well.  These were some guys that clearly hadn't forgotten where they had come from.  Even the beer on the menu paid homage to Detroit. So we were pretty happy before we even started to eat.

We always order a pepperoni pizza (Detroit Style in this case).  I was a little disappointed to see them using Aluminum pans instead of the old-school Blue Steel pans that the famous Detroit Style places use like Cloverleaf and Buddy's.  They also put the sauce under the cheese which isn't true to the roots, but not the end of the world.  As we sat to wait for the pizza, the cheese bread came out.  It was some small bread loafs cut in half with some garlic butter and topped with some good tasting mozzarella cheese.  Nothing fancy but just plain good.  Around the same time I was finishing the bread, the pizza came.  The first bite reminded me of a little better tasting Jet's Pizza.  If you have ever had Jet's pizza you would know they do the deep dish pretty good.  Northside Nathan's featured a dough that was soft and airy, the sauce was clean and not over-seasoned, they really let the tomatoes do their thing with no strings attached.  The cheese was plentiful and baked to perfection, it tasted downright fantastic.

In the end, there is very little that I could complain about at Northside Nathan's.  I think it's hard to get a good crunch on the bottom of the pie when you are baking with aluminum pans.  The overall flavor was very good and we were very happy that they are representing Detroit in a great way with some good food.  If you are ever in the Vegas area and craving some good pizza check them out.  Todd, Shirley, John and Craig will take good care of you.  We look forward to the great things they have to come in the future.  See you guys next year!",wHFnUYpU5oB1vN7BoqXRyA,1,1,4,Pqh_sKC7Sxc_1UpNMf0e5g

This personal pizza was so TINY and I paid 9$ for it! Really? I honestly would of saved the 9$.  Probably won't come back unless prices go down.  The pizza should of been a few $ cheaper for its size.  And each topping is 60 cents.

2611709,2015-08-21,0,Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ,"I went here a bunch of people on a Friday night. It was defiantly a dive bar feeling with a supposedly ""Detroit"" feeling. I couldnt vouch for that as I havent been there but it was cool. There was a lot of knick-nacks on the wall from sports teams and stuff. The lighting was very dim and it was hard to see. We went there with a friend who was in wheel chair and it was hard to accommodate him. We didnt make a reservation and we had a party of 8. There was no wait at all. But like I said it was akward eating without the accommodation for my friend. They kinda had to stick us in the middle isle on a long table where they were limited space while the people behind us in the book kinda brushed our backs as they tried to fit into their booth seat.
Reguardless, I have to say I ate there a week ago and I am still craving their traditional Detroit 1 topping pizza. We got 4 pizzas: 1 topping pepperoni, Nicely Nicely's: garlic and chicken, Adelaides special/the works, and the Sky Mastersons pizza: Sausage and pepperoni and onions. All the other pizzas were ok, I didnt like the chicken one due to how dry the chicken was, the works was kinda soggy, and I didnt get to try the Masterson pizza because I was so full. Like I said the one I loved was the 1 topping pepperoni. It reminded me of when pizza hut used to make personal pan pizzas with the semi deep dish crust- oily yet still crunchy and super delicious. My mother always told me the best way to judge a pizza is by eating as little toppings as possible, so cheese and cheese+pepperoni is the way that I judge a good pizza. 
We also got 50 wings- 2 orders of 25. It was delicious. The wings dont have any sauce on it as they are fried ""naked"" style- no breading. Super hot and crispy and golden on the outside with a sweet/juicy/tender/hot chicken on the inside. Compliments to the chef who cooks those wings.
The best part is that they make their own ranch dressing there: Marvelous Marion. Im not a huge ranch person as I prefer blue cheese but everyone seemed to love it. Each set of wings comes with 2 ranch sauces and you can order blue cheese on the side for 55 cents.

The only downside about this place is that the pizza is kinda expensive (18-20$) for 9 piece pizza and also it wasnt clear how to order! We kinda just sat there for like 10-15min wondering when the water was going to come. And the waitresses are all just standing around. It was very confusing. We finally asked the lady to take our order and she told us we have to order our own food at the front window. The good thing is that the beers are cheap (PBR for 1.75) and other beers are anywhere from 3-5$. 

I probably be back although it is kinda out of my way for WINGS and that 1 topping pepperoni pizza!",kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,2,1,4,3o5GkWarUTkEzYs0o_i3Fw

We knew we had to try it. We ordered a large square with pepperoni and ham and medium antipasto salad. The salad was good. It had an abundance of ham, salami, and cheese. The dressing was decent. One of the stars above is for the salad alone...
The pizza topping were good too. The cheese was deliciously melty and there were an abundance of toppings. There's that other star! 

I have nothing good to say about the crust of the pizza we received. It was horribly dense and flat almost like they left an ingredient out OR they used frozen dough. There was hardly any of that delicious crispy crust you see on a real Detroit style pizza. It was tasteless, hard, and really dried out. I am not sure if we hit the restaurant on a bad day or if it is always this bad. Compared to the pizza we had last night, we'd rather have Great Baron frozen french bread pizza, Little Caesar's, Costco pizza. For $36, we expect a much better quality than we received.

I ordered the Gangsters Choice and a Greek salad. 
I was not disappointed with either! 

The Gangsters choice has capicola, garlic, and jalapeños. The pizza is not deep dish but has a similar taste. Personally, I love slightly burnt crunchy cheese and they never disappoint since their pizza is a square I get the crunch on all sides. The garlic is abundant and freshly chopped. I'm a fire eater so I can use more jalapeños, but for the medium lovers it's perfecto! If you don't like spicy don't get this. One of my friends couldn't eat past 2 bites due to the spicy level. If you are a ranch lover then you must try theirs! It's 75 cents each, but wow, you'll never see ranch the same again. 

Their Greek salad was simple. Black olives, red onions, cucumbers, feta cheese, and romaine lettuce. It was perfect! 

I've got this same deal about 3 times since the first time I ordered it. Haha.

I highly recommend. Their pizza is a little expensive (compared to chain delivery places), but very much worth it. ( just to give an idea $15.25 for a 9 piece one topping pizza)",jQPKcrKfywAPpG_Nfh549A,19,16,4,DMah3-3un76sZmv6UAj2xw

I also ordered the churros and ice cream which was really delicious that or I was just really really hungry. I will be ordering again for sure but making sure I get the right size.

The decor is pretty generic,  family areas with brighter paint on one side - dark earth tones in the adult areas. TV 's all over.

I ordered at the window, as you walk in. I ordered a meatball sandwich. And a beer.
I was hoping for a meatball sandwich that could at least get close to a """"Busy Bee "" meatball sandwich.  No such luck.  Busy Bee is a small mom & pop market in San Pedro,  Ca.  If your ever in San Pedro - maybe to see the USS Iowa - google ""Busy Bee Market "". One of the finest sandwich purveyors I've  ever encountered. Anyway, this Northside Nathan was OK - but nothing to write home about.  The toasted bun was a mouth scalder. The marinara and cheese had some flavor - but the meatballs themselves were bland. On a scale of 1 to 10 - 10 being  a Busy Bee meatball sandwich - Northside Nathans scores a whopping 4.

I rate NN 3 stars. It wasnt aweful, it wasnt bad,  it was just an average meatball sandwich . You probably won't  even remember eating it,  let alone recommend it to others.",Z4-fGDigomv6Yr6TZ93s1w,0,0,3,uvGRzM9C51zAk02W5yIFqA

This is one of three pizza places I'll go to in Vegas that I actually really like the pizza at. At one time I actually did live in Detroit and I can attest to the fact this is Detroit pizza. There are three good things that have come out of Detroit: cars, Eminem, and northside Nathan's.  

The pizzas are square, they're very cheesy and I like the sauce and the crust is crispy but doughy in the middle of each slice it's so good, you get both. It's very reasonably priced too, I've always gotten really good service everyone has been super nice. I think they have traditional round pizza too but I love their deep dish square pizza so much I haven't even bothered with anything else. I usually get the small/personal size it's four square slices, sometimes if I'm going to have lunch or dinner for a couple days I'll get the medium, that one has nine slices. I also really like their go blue garlic cheese bread that's very good as well. I've had their mozzarella sticks too, you've had one mozzarella stick you've pretty much had them all they don't stand out in any particular way,but they're good as well.

It was was acceptable, though the abundant cheese didn't taste like genuine mozzarella. Still, the crust was crispy, so it fit the bill.

I ordered a glass of wine, since Sheila's Law stipulates that any food remotely Italian must be accompanied by wine.  It wasn't the best, but at 4 bucks a glass, I'm not complaining too loudly.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,0,0,3,Wy41NwLdUE8ioG43FppOtA

Northside does Detroit style pizza which means it's deep and it's square (just like Detroit?). Their restaurant is decorated with Detroit gear set with an orange Detroit Tigers wall and a red Red Wings Wall (sorry Pistons, I didn't notice a wall for you) which is cool since they are my hubbies teams. 

You walk in and order at a window where the menu is located on a machine top or you can grab a menu. Then you can sit at any booth. We happened to have a Groupon for $20 so we got an 11 inch Guys and Dolls pizza, two fountain drinks, and hubby got a beer. With the groupon we only paid $4. The pizza is delevered to you and placed on a platform at your table. The deliciousness is hot so don't burn your tongue. I didn't think we would finish it all but three pieces for me and six pieces for him later and it's gone! If you love deep dish crust, the square-ness of the pizza gives you that extra crust love with the corner pieces. If you're not a big crust fan, go for the sans-crust middle pieces. Something for every pizza lover. 

When our lunch was done, they even gave us a customer appreciation coupon for the next time for a free mini-skinny pizza which is thin crust. They do have other things on the menu, but why do that when they're so good at pizza? Love it and would definitely go again!",6oYSZsRlbd2Mr1Sc2UF_ew,0,0,4,yTHEM8iQST1eB8YvbjPdmw

Northside Nathan's certainly delivers on one of the pizza styles found in Michigan, and it nice to play nostalgic, with menu items giving reverence to the Detroit Red Wings. Anyhow, I'll tell you what I love. I love the square style pizza. Although it is a deeper crust, it is still fresh and the dough has a crispness and texture that I love. One thing I do notice, however is that due to some of their special flavorings in oils and herbs, that I can tell, at times, when there is a different cook. It's never disappointing, but sometimes it may provide a different taste. My only fault with Northside Nathan's, and it is slight, given it's cuisine, is that there is not much outside of that which is dipped in fat and/or fried in the offerings beyond pizza. The only choice would be one of their four different types of salads.",n_bwAQck5VkX_-7SuoyGIg,1,1,4,NoNGo4vcy_cmwQf674_SzA

I recently went here for a friends birthday and have to say it blows and pizza hut, papa johns or dominoes our of the water. We had the antipasto salad with plenty of vine ripe tomatoes and tons of little bite sized salami and cheese. But as another reviewer said the dressing is a little acidic therefore I suggest using only about half of it. We also had some of their wings; that unlike most pizza joints are of the breaded variety instead of the fried or oven baked. The breaded wings are fried to perfection, light and crisp but are not spicy as the sauce comes on the side. Our pizza was their classic Guy and Doll (sausage, pepperoni, onion) and was fantastic.

But food here is decently priced, especially the beer. Pbr was 1.75!  That's super cheap. We got 3 medium Detroit style pizzas and 50 wings with the ranch sauce.

The pizzas were good. Normally I prefer thin crust New York style but I thought it was yummy. We ordered the works, a pepperoni and mushroom one and the chicken jalapeño one. Thin crust is still my favorite though!  The chicken wings were bomb!  They were more like fried chicken wings because it wasn't saucy at all. It was deep friend, crunchy and juicy.  Not the traditional wings you'll see at Wong stop but I really enjoyed them!  Much more than the pizza for sure.

They are doing lunch specials where you get a 6inch 2 topping pizza and a drink for $6.85.You can add fries or onion rings for $1 or a side salad for $2 and some change. 

We added on the onion rings and those came out pretty fast. Not bad, but a tad cooked too long so it was on the harder side of crunchy. 

BF and I got to share one with salami and jalapenos and one with meatballs and olives. The crust was crunchy and it came out piping hot and quick. It's ""kinda"" Detroit style, more inspired I feel, a bit different than what I actually can get in Detroit. What it reminds me more of is the deep dish my elementary used to make. That's not meant to be a bad thing- my school made fresh (not packaged Tony's frozen) squares with pepperoni bits and I thought that was the best thing ever.

5127039,2012-07-15,6,Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ,"Ahh Detroit, home of the lust-worthy Ford Mustang, incredibly talented rapper Eminem, and sweet sweet old Motown music. Do you know what wasn't just on that list??? Pizza, that's what. And after trying Northside Nathan's, I can see why. Now I can come to one of two conclusions after eating there; either Northside Nathan's doesn't accurately represent Detroit style pizza (much the same way that a lot of ""New York style"" pizzerias in this town bear absolutely no resemblance to real New York pizza), or Detroit needs to stick to manufacturing the vehicles I love to drive, and leave the pizza to the big boys (New York and maybe I guess Chicago). 

The ambiance in this place is easily 3.5 to 4 stars. It's got a really cool decor. The service was also good. The counter girl was friendly and helpful. They also have lots of good promotions going on with coupons all over their website and on the pizza boxes. 

So those were the three redeeming qualities of Northside Nathan's. Unfortunately, after that everything came tumbling down. The crust was far from terrible, it actually was the most decent thing about the pizza. The most apparent problem was that the cheese was of the artificial blend variety. Whatever it was, I guarantee the box it came in didn't read ""Whole Milk Mozzarella"" or anything of the sort. The ""meatball"" topping was just that awful, flavorless crumbled ground beef topping. The sauce was barely existent, but maybe that's a good thing, because the little that I could taste was really sub par. I doctored it up with Parm, Red Pepper, Oregano, and Garlic Powder, but as Eminem once said ""Nurse, we're losing him. Check the pulse!!"" Alas, it was too late to save this terrible pizza. I won't swear off Detroit style pizza for good, but the chances of me returning to Northside Nathan's anytime soon are somewhere between Slim and Shady. 

P.S.- Something I learned from this experience... If a restaurant has a hard time not burning your fries, it probably isn't going to fare too well in the more difficult areas of the food menu.",eBWDX4a5iURWg-MA97hFpg,4,3,2,mKK4sUy7bL6xTXnMNTi-Pw

I have also sampled Detroit style pizza in NYC at Emma Squared and in Austin at 313. The restaurant is full of Detroit memorabilia  and fun. The menu is colorful and creative. We ordered a small antipasto salad and a 4 square Detroit Guys and Dolls. The salad was perfect. I loved the dressing and the meats and cheese were plentiful. We did not order breadsticks but otherwise, it tasted very close to home. It was a generous portion so we were able to save some to eat with the pizza. We loved the flavors in the pizza. The sauce was excellent. The cheese blend was good. The meats just right. The only criticism was the structure of the pizza. It did not match up to the original nor the other competitors. A square of Buddy's is very filling. I had one square of this one and let my hubby have the rest. I am gluten sensitive and shouldn't be eating regular pizza anyway. Buddy's offers a gluten free style in Detroit. Regardless, I live here now, so if I crave a Buddy's Pizza, this will suffice. I would give 3.5 stars if the app allowed.",YCkRZrpcLi177y5wUSQX2w,1,0,3,M1kW1T5-54_SWkLHXuNVyQ

Other than that, I did like the wall decor and environment there. Music taste was unique plus they were playing Tom & Jerry so that's a plus and the Coca Cola was bomb there! Probably best I've had. The service was kind when ordering and when we left. Overall it was okay, but next time I definitely need the bigger size, the one I ordered I didn't think was going to be that small for $8!",ItxWRaXq02K5wEEjnOhcTg,0,0,4,YDVaTIJNktCBWeBmWRODFQ

5653874,2015-10-18,1,Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ,"We have been coming to this pizza restaurant since it opened in 1998! We tried it the first week it opened and have been loyal patrons ever since.

My husband is from Michigan so we became fast friends with the owners and he always feels a taste of home when we come here. The decor is all about Michigan sports from the Tigers to the Pistons and even some homage to the Lions.... There is also a bar with video poker machines for those that just want to hang out and gamble. We come for the pizza!

The menu features pizza, wings, fingers, salads all with names from streets and places in Detroit and Michigan (really fun!).

The pizza always tastes fresh and the crust has the right amount of softness and crunch. The cheese literally melts in your mouth along with lots of other toppings to choose from. 

Hands down the best pizza in town!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,3,1,5,6iSM_V8NzkHtYIFZNK-1LA

Big selection of pizzas available and this is what you come here for.  The other foods are just for those who want variety.",WM7MFrRP-7YFuGBAJ6quRQ,1,0,3,91bx-WvBhdZaausnY1sjlA

Had some take out (after seeing all the great revues) a pizza and some sandwiches.
The pizza was ok, nothing to write home about, the philly cheese was ok, not much there for the price, the italian sub was salty beyond belief, not sure how they managed to do that. 
All in all...and in MHO....I think whoever gave all the 5 star revues ...have very low standards. for the cost I expected something good, my fault.",KCwfAJkgpi3-J1Es1qlLyg,1,0,3,wnARNbtwqoek87N4b5KBvw

Four of us ate plenty and still had some to take home.  It was tasty, topped with cheese and salami cubes.  We then ordered the chicken wings which were flavorful and crispy.  We ordered the veggie pizza and the roasted chicken pizza.  Both were good, but I would have like the sauce to be better..  I would come back again when I desire deep dish pizza, but we are still on the hunt for the best pizza in LV; as this was not it!",XqxfND6MnnWCy-4Y3Hf7wg,1,1,3,lL5MmZBH0U9O9uPM2-_WtQ

5847971,2014-09-03,1,Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ,"Second time here and I can't give it more stars. I planned to get their pasts this time but they only have spaghetti or ziti with choice of marinara or meat sauce. $1.50 more for meatballs and from what I saw (or didn't see) on the pizza, I passed. Tried the medium size Sky Masterson and still wasn't satisfied with what I got for the price.  Now they have mastered the pan pizza crust; top notch. But it had pepperoni, ham, sausage... no meatballs to be found. There are round pieces of sausage the size of corn kernels; if they call THAT meatballs I would have walked out ordering the pasta. Face it; this place is a sports bar so it should have sports bar prices. Now I can see coming in here Sunday afternoon, buying a bucket of wings (15.95 for 25) a beer and watching football. The place is great for that. They just need to take the ""Sumerlin"" out of it.
Things they can improve on:
1. Re evaluate the prices on most menu items
2. Put grated cheese dispensers on tables or the condiment stand. The staff shouldn't need to hunt one down for you when it should come with a pizza.
3. Turn on the closed caption on the TVs. Watching SportsCenter  doesn't help when they can't explain what the suspensions were this week.
4. They have a great video menu screen, but it changes too fast to actually READ the specials, menu items or when Happy Hour is. The only screen on long enough to read is the company offering the service.",AStHl7m__BTiheHzpXvmRQ,1,0,2,EB0xncrd1ep2P3yRBdPfIQ
5876953,2012-11-16,0,Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ,"I know Im a pizza snob and I have an extremely high standard when it comes to pizza, quality, quantity, freshness and ambiance.

This place definitely was average or a little less than average on all accounts.

We ordered a combo pizza with 4 different types of pizzas and the only thing I can say is that they are one step above a frozen pizza. Was nothing special about the pizza.

We also ordered a sampler platter and it was ok. Worst frozen onion rings Ive ever had. Chicken fingers weren't bad, fries were like frozen oven fries. But no Mottzeralla sticks?

Its a bar go and get a few drinks but dont come here for the pizza.

Ooh, they do have a sit down pac-man and a Gallaga arcade game. Get a drink and play a few $1 games but stay away from the pizza!",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,1,1,1,ta80pamTLT2otheGTvD2WA

The food is great. Always finding myself craving the pizza and fries. Really good. 

They are always over turning staff- I mean almost everytime I come in there's a new girl up front which means I need to tell her where on the cash register to find my daughters motoscooter order, and ALWAYS need to ask for the drink that comes with it. Which is annoying.

Came in today to see they changed the straws- weird I know but let me explain. They are no longer wrapped, so they are all open for everyone's hands to touch when you go to grab one out of the container. This is seriously gross. 

Those few concerns aside, like I said pizza and fries make my mouth water and I order pickup all the time because of this. ( Delivery is always told at least a hour and I live up the street, that might be something to look into on their end ) 

So 4 star rating mostly for the pizza, fries, and ranch, one off for the concerns which clearly haven't been a deal breaker yet.",oDzGIJ78utjfAoWFybZgOA,0,0,4,lyLKb5uhuQn1Y-Y0MV-B1A

They have tvs all around the restaurant which you can view from the booths or bar counter. They also have outside seating for anyone who'd like to do people watching instead. Their deep dish Chicago pizza is worth a purchase and so is their deep fried pickles. So this is how it works, order food at window to the right when you enter, they give you a number, you find a seat and their team members in cool fedoras bring your food and get you anything there after. If you'd like a low maintenance place to watch sports, have some tasty pizza, this neighborhood family friendly establishment should be your final destination.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,16,13,4,jK2TvG4f9rxZGJIF7o7kag
5973563,2011-06-08,0,Xs5MqC7-g0vc4nmWDtRZoQ,"When I think of ""deep dish"", I automatically think of Chicago style where there are cheese and toppings galore.  Well, I'm not a pizza expert, nor have I ever tried Detroit style pizza before, I just love me some good pizza. 

And that is why this review is ""A-OK"".  There was just way too much crust for the amount of toppings in the ""Sky Masterson (pepperoni, ham, sausage, and meatballs) and ""Nicely Nicely's"" (chicken, garlic, and mushroom) for my liking.  Thank God the ranch dressing was delicious, because that was the only way that I was able to eat the leftover crust once my toppings were devoured.  If you like thick crust- then you'll love Northside Nathan's.  

We also ordered the chicken wings and those alone have me intrigued to come back.  We ordered take-out, but I still have a couple coupons and the atmosphere looks nice with all of the TVs- so I will try dining in, ordering a thin crust pizza instead.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,4,0,3,jrw31AhRsSMw27sVK7akdg
