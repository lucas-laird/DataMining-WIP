3625,2016-01-21,1,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,"Ridiculously overrated hipster food. Crappy coffee, that they sweeten for you. we asked for sweetener and were told they would do it for us.  Apparently they dont trust us to sweeten our own coffee with their ""craft"" ingredients.  One plate came out cold and 5 min before our other plate.

The bathrooms are hidden behind a partition with ZERO indication that they are bathrooms. I never got a coffee refill, strange for a ""coffee bar.""

Altogether $30 for two people to have crappy coffee. We sent one back in exchange for an espresso. It was better tasting.  The food tasted ok, not great and definitely not worth $12-$14 a plate. The coffee SUCKED.  

I will be going back to The Egg and I.  Fuckin Denny's beats this place.  But, it's trendy.  Great place if you care about being trendy.",5PpaqrtrU-firmGnaO43iw,2,0,1,fsg3SawzV7g-uSBoJOGzww

Equally thoughtful is the food. I had the smashed avo poached egg toast with a side of portuguese sausage and a macadamia nut latte (nut bits were the best) with their housemade almond milk (sweetened with dates). Egg poached perfect and avo smashed supreme. I wanted everything. I am craving the entire experience again. The locals, smug and smiling, can frequent the establishment anytime they please. Alas, I gotta wait until we meet again.

CONS (for me, you might like it)
The Iced Macadamia Nut Latte - it had pieces of macadamia nuts on the bottom. Some people might not be bothered by that, but it was a weird surprise when I slurped up chunks of macadamia through my straw.

One of the iced Dark Chocolate Lattes - it was just too bitter for me. If you like the 80 - 99999% cacao dark chocolate, then this might be the drink for you. 

PROS
I did finally find a drink that I like. The Iced Latte with Madagascar Vanilla Syrup. It's just the right amount of sweetness I like. 

THE BREKKIE BURRITO
Yea, I needed to put that all in caps. It has chorizo, egg, potatoes, and happiness all inside of a warm tortilla. 

The MACARONS
Also deserving of caps lock. They always have different flavors each time I go. My favorites so far have been Peach Bellini, Cookies n Cream, and Blood Orange.

We came in they have free parking in the back. I came to eat breakfast with my sister we walked in the door.
We didn't know what to do. Whether we sit or wait so a nice staff member walked us through how they bake everything and that veggies and eggs are organic. They have a pastrie display. Looks awesome. 
You grab your menu, look it over and then order and pay. They deliver the food to you. My sister had the avocado toast. It was basic wheat toast, a poached egg with pepper on it. A whole lot of avocado, which the avocado was turning brown by the way... So she kept eating around it. She also got the oatmeal no complains for that one she said good probably the best thing in this place. I had the forbidden rice. Does say it has mixed veggies. I asked the cashier I can't have onions, any types of onions. He said no problem we have mixed veggies so we can take them out! I was happy about that but when l got my food deliver it was amazing! But a soon as she drops it on the table i see onions and a shit load of green onions... I'm like wtf?? I told the girl I can't eat onions, while she said ma'am thats scallions. So no i get called old, im only 22. Then I tried to get lecture that scallions and green onions aren't in the same family??? Like come on don't you care for people's allergies? They took it back made me a new one apologized and brought me back a new one which only had pork belly and an organic egg which you have to pay for 2 dollars each. Plain... Disappointment.

Service continues to be weird: I let them know that someone had a puppy in there licking/drooling on the table etc.; was told to take care of it myself!! ORIGINAL REVIEW: ...last few visits have been disappointing. The salads are good but avoid the other vegetarian options - over-priced and un-inspiring. Salads also rely too much on sugar (for flavor). The food in general is not as high in quality or execution as it in pretense. Example :  veg sandwich tastes like watery  baby food mush on bread, and is 95% bread. Description sounds fancy but, in reality, flavorless. Nothing protein-y in it. Also: service can be just plain weird. That said - if you have money to burns and can consume high calorie food, the coffee is good and the sweets are too.

The decor inside this place is just beautiful with bookshelves of books lining one wall and a long communal table with trees growing out of the middle. Seemed really modern and hipster. Very aesthetically nice to have a coffee or meal at. 

For breakfast, I ordered the garden farm breakfast ($13), while my parents and sister got the steak and eggs, which comes with potatoes and toast ($14); the traditionalist, which comes with spam, two eggs, sausage, and potatoes ($11), and the brekkie sandwich, which had two eggs, bacon, avocado, and chedder between a toasted brioche bun ($10) with two iced coffees. The garden farm breakfast came with a beautifully poached eggs over a bed of swiss chard with baby carrots, asparagus, potatoes, tomatoes, and a couple pieces of toasted bread. The vegetables made the plate so colorful and bright! The meal was light and fresh but really hearty and satisfying at the same time. Such a healthy and nutritious way to start off the day.

The friendliness of the staff never ceases to amaze me, they're all great people (and have great personal stories if you get a chance to small talk when it's slow... Not that that happens often.) 

Remember to ask for the wifi password when you're at the counter! The only downfall, and what keeps me from going a whole lot more often is the lack of power outlets.

A little noisy inside. Probably due to the flooring, which is gorgeous by the way. This place tries to bring the outside in. Thus , creating an almost picnic-y feel which is refreshing in Las Vegas. The warm wood tables and benches, the live trees inside is pleasant; you could say it offers respite for those that suffer allergies, and still want to be around plants.

For the food. Whenever I go to a restaurant that has a Cuban sandwich, I order it. I've tried at least twenty Cuban sandwiches in the Las Vegas/Henderson valley. So how does this one rank? On a scale of one to ten, it was about a 4.5.

The sandwich had some technical issues. The panini bread was put on a panini grill that was too hot; outside burned, inside bread not as warm. There was the wrong mustard to cheese ratio-too much mustard.

The greens served with the sandwich were over-dressed. The homemade potato chips were pretty great. I also ordered from the walk-up food bar and got the brussels sprouts. They were a bit over sauced.

Over all, I love the atmosphere. The staff is very friendly. The coffee is great and the pastries are nice. Stick with the food from the walk-up.",mjbHPwsvpGkM83rqgVf_SQ,1,0,4,fnUkvtlDRYa2NOSjikDwpA

I come on a regular basis, once a week at times.  Their food has been inconsistent and drives me crazy the most is how the food comes at different times, especially drinks. I know they get popular and busy and maybe their kitchen staff and baristas just can't handle the flow, but I'm not even talking about during peak times or when it's super packed. 

Numerous times my friends and I would place the order together and one of us would get food way later than the rest. It makes it awkward for the rest of the party to wait for one person or ..etc. And many times the drinks would be worst than food. One time, I literally about to finish my food before my latte showed up, and NOT because they forgot to make it.  It doesn't take that long to make a drink!  The speed how things come out is just getting annoying especially you're there with some friends.  And this annoyance has become more like a regular thing there.. :(

Although I still like their food at times, one time my soft scramble was the hardest and toughest egg I've ever eaten, definitely not SOFT,  I wish they could improve how the food comes out, especially in one party.

And please, can we hang or make a sign to help people where to order, where the menu is and how to line up?  I know how it works cuz I go there often, but to see how newcomers struggle on a regular basis is really not customer service friendly.

PublicUs is on a corner and easy to spot - they've got a private lot also, which is convenient! When you enter, you stay in line to order and then find a seat to wait to get your grub on.

Now, let's talk about food baby! We got the meatloaf, coffee rubbed roast beef sandwich, sausages, macadamia nut latte, and the guava cake. I'm not a huge fan of meatloaf, but this one was good and just the right amount of moisture. Personally thought the coffee rubbed roast beef wasn't too extraordinary, but it did have a hint of coffee, which was interesting. The sausages were a good pick, with two different types that I don't remember the specifics of. We all preferred one sausage over the other, and enjoyed the grilled veggies and baked potato it came with! I absolutely loved the macadamia nut latte, it was just perfect for me, with bits of macadamia with every sip!! Last, but not least, the guava cake was good, but again, nothing extremely amazing for me - could just be my taste. But it was interesting to try, especially because I love guava drinks!

The baristas are pretty strong, I do miss Cole though! He had a passion for perfection and was ALWAYS welcoming. PublicUS can be a hit or miss spot when it comes to breakfast. I've had over cooked eggs, extremely hard bread, a mix of cold eggs with warm bacon, that's pretty annoying considering on average you'll spend over $40 for two people, so you expect it to be perfect. The one thing I've never really had an issue with is coffee! If you want a cool place to meet up with your friends and share some pastries and coffee, then this is a good place for that.

The restaurant is always full when I'm there so coming with big parties isn't ideal. A lot of the seating are shared tables so you never know who you'll meet! Once I sat at the same table with some music band, I didn't know who they are, but they were pretty cool:)

The place has a nice display of ready-made cafe goods if you want to stop in and pick up some cookies, quiche, or topped toasts. Their menu has a great selection of breakfast and lunch items perfect for a quick meal. The traditional breakfast is my favorite cause I love bacon and eggs. It's served with tiny half potatoes and bread....actually the bread kinda sucks cause its really hard, but if you like hard bread, it's perfect! Their sandwiches are also great.

I enjoy these style setups where you order at the front, pay and than find a seat and they bring the food to you. Staff was super legit, friendly, and very attentive. All I can say was I couldn't wait to try the food.

I ordered the Candied Bacon Apple Omelette, Smoked Salmon Toast, and a glass of Orange Juice. Took a little longer than expected but the juice was amazing so I didn't mind the wait, plus the place itself gives you a lot to talk about. Once the food finally came out I was a little disappointed by the size of the omelette, seemed a little small. That omelette was absolutely amazing perfectly cooked, every bite was fantastic, offered my girlfriend a bite and I was hesitant to give up a bite it was that good. Even the side of toast was bomb, buttery and delicious. The salmon toast was also pretty good, wasn't too big a fan of the arrangement but still enjoyed it. Had a piece of my girlfriends french toast and it was just so perfect.

FOOD/DRINKS: We both ordered pour over coffees, which were great. They had two options that morning, and we went with a lighter roast. We also ordered a homemade apricot pop-tart. I highly recommend ordering one of these if they're available! They have a pretty wide variety of pastries and breads, and they also serve a few menu items for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

STAFF: Walking up to the counter, we were greeted by an enthusiastic guy who explained the menu. All other staff members were friendly and attentive. A man, who I assume was the owner, came over to our table and asked if we were satisfied. He also thanked us for coming in when we left.

Disclaimer-I am a barista at another Cafe.  I am biased to think I make the best coffee and espresso in the city. 

Pros-
Knowledgeable staff.  Was able to instantly engage in coffee discussion without needing to look at anything.  These guys know coffee and are proud of their work.  

Good espresso. I had an iced Americano unfortunately because I was too hot to drink it hot so I'm sure I missed some flavor notes but I'm guessing an African and maybe Guatamala blend.  Hard to tell with flavor being diluted with my Americano. Regardless, good neutral taste leaning a bit citrus maybe.  

My espresso did not sit.  My drink was impressively made in about 10 seconds.  I could see the shots had a great crema and didn't sit at all before they were added to the water, which it's also great they add the shots to water instead of water to shots like some places do. 

Great atmosphere.  It's very energetic, music is fine typical coffee shop music and good volume.  

Clean.  Clean staff, clean store.  Few drink rings on my table from the previous guest bit that's just nitpicking.  

Cons

Literally as I was talking about the music in the last pro it cut out for around 30 seconds.  Not bad, just kinda funny and I have no real cons to actually write at the moment.",K-lTZ0fEhV61M5LqPK-M5g,3,0,5,wZAq6QNVZYSBW8PuJEd9Mw

I felt the ordering process was strange and inefficient for the type of restaurant.  You wait in line to order, pay, tip, then wait for your food to randomly come out.  Smart of them to have you tip before you judge the service.  Although the staff was friendly the orders came out randomly and slow.  I regularly saw staff wander the restaurant trying to find where to deliver the food.  We ordered mixed berries with granola and yogurt, the blue rocket beet salad, a freekeh bowl, red bliss potatoes and a chocolate croissant.  The croissant was great and luckily the yogurt and berries came out first for my daughter.  That was good too.  10 minutes down the line we received the beet salad which was just ok.  About 10 minutes later we finally got the freekeh bowl.  Keep in mind that these 3 orders were each of our lunches, not shared dishes.  We each got fed one at a time.  The freekeh bowl was actually horrible but I forced myself to eat 4 or 5 bites.  The eggplant was completely dry, the curried garbanzo beans were completely dry, the squash was dry and the other third was a pile of surprisingly bland pickled cabbage.  In fact the whole thing didn't taste like it had any seasoning, salt or oil.  10 minutes later we finally got the red bliss potatoes (my only side dish) which I had to have them put in a box by then.  They were very salty potatoes fried to a crisp and smashed like they got run over by a car.  I almost thought they were messing with me when I opened that box and took a bite.  How do you mess up potatoes?  I'm curious too.  After spending $60+ on that lunch I felt completely burned.  And to top it off, my receipt had a lame ass quote at the bottom from Richard Alpert that said something along the lines of ""all I do is love everything in the universe all day"", as if they are trying to prime you into liking this place because it falls under the category of ""things in the universe"".  As if I didn't have enough crap shoved down my throat by then.  If I go again it will only be for black coffee.

The first visit we went for breakfast and it was the best experience. I took my food to go and I ordered the berry toast. They cut it in half and didn't just throw it in there and the coffee was great. 

The second time we we went for lunch. I didn't know we had to get our own water or put our own dishes away. We asked the guy working and he looked at us as if we asked him something crazy. They should posted friendly instructions to inform people how things work. However, the Cuban sandwich was good not the best just good. 

The third time I ordered coffee and the Thai beef salad. The cashier didn't even greet us or look up at us while we ordered. He was very quick to put his head over to see if we would tip but we didn't with that attitude. The salad was just thrown together as if they didn't care. It was okay. I didn't like the dressing and the presentation just made it less appealing.

I'm not sure I could've been less pleased with the frittata. The potatoes on the side were charred and significantly overcooked, but not hot all the way through - perhaps because they were microwaved with the frittata? I liked the fresh greens and tomatoes alongside the frittata, but they didn't quite make up for its mediocrity. For $17, I can eat like a king elsewhere.

The Cannon - an iced espresso with lemon and simple syrup. Named after one of the roasters of the coffee. It is a great refreshing drink. Very balanced. 

A Pour over- had the Rwandan coffee and it was delicious. Only issue was the mugs. They don't have a handle and is hot to touch. 

Macadamia nut latte- tasty. Balanced. Tastes just like a macadamia nut...because it has ground macadamia nuts in it. It is an interesting twist on a flavor added coffee, not bad, just wish I knew about it beforehand. 

Eggs Benedict- great blood orange hollandaise sauce! The meal was sweet throughout. The eggs were cooked great! The English muffin was tasty, but a little tough to cut even with a knife. The arugula and mandarin salad on the side was interesting. I couldn't pick out how they seasoned it. 

Breakfast skillet - (not my meal, but had a couple bites) . Had sausage, apple, potatoes, a sunny side fried egg on top. The apples added great sweetness and the sausage was easy to cut and eat. Potatoes were good as well. 

You are greeted by a server as soon as you walk in and they guide you where to go and answer any questions. Cole was very helpful and friendly.

Three House Vanilla Lattes had no vanilla and were just luke warm and not hot. Took the coffee to the counter and had some vanilla added but it was still cold. They gentleman was extremely polite and corrected the issue but I should have asked to remake them. Got the avvo toast and it is my go to. Today the egg was extremely under poached and had to ask for another. Asked for no aoili on the break is sandwich and aoili was put on it too.

The side of roasted potatoes was huge and I was unable to finish them but they were also a little over cooked for me.  I did however enjoy the cappuccino I ordered it was delicious.   They do offer a wide variety of coffee and teas.   My friend ordered the Angus beef hamburger and she said it was really good.

My other favs and go to are the Thai beef salad and side of spicy Brussels! The salad dressing is on point, the greens are super fresh and crisp and the steak is always cooked perfectly!

Bruch days they have a special menu and offer a Brioche fresh toast that my friend craves all the time and keeps talking about, that we had to try it!

If only the outside matched the flavor. I'll start with the soup; don't do it. It is not seasoned, and it is bland and it tastes like baby food. Even adding salt and pepper did not help this situation. The salad was neatly organized into a wreath adorned with pieces of beets, a few pieces of walnuts and not nearly enough goat cheese. ( I suggest tossing it before serving it). If you're going to do it, do it right; delicious until the counted pieces of walnuts and goat cheese crumbles are gone. The veggie croissant was ordered with avocado and it came to the table without. Which is fixable but already we were not impressed. The Cuban sandwich was not pressed and it came in the wrong bread. When I order a Cuban sandwich I expect a Cuban sandwich; therefore disappointing. Don't get me started on the coffee cups.

Our total came out to roughly $35. It was definitely not worth that amount. You can't really go wrong with bacon, but the waffles were not fluffy at ALL. They were crispy. It was like toast. The eggs Benedict was good but the serving size was tiny (not what you'd expect for $13). It came with breakfast potatoes which I also considered a tiny serving and I'm 5' tall.

Maybe have several people !at all times! taking orders instead of guys randomly walking up and asking for your order to type it into the iPad then the cashier has to reiterate everything all over again.

I have had several vegan daily specials and have ordered the standby vegan burger. Everything was well prepared and flavorful.

I've heard about this place opening a while back, but never had any interest in visiting this spot, whether because the name reminds me of a market, or because I'm located on the other side of town. So here I am at the Coffee Hunter, drinking my coffee, when they tell me about probably the best place to eat in town. Instantly, I was curious. They tell me it's unlike any other spot in Vegas. So, I make it a mission of mine to try it out.

On my off day from work, I made my way down here. In a nondescript part of town, over by the edge of Fremont st., I saw it. From the outside, it doesn't look like much. The inside however tells a very different story. The vibe is hip and modern. The main draw is the central area, where all the magic happens. The eye catching food as it is displayed for all to see, and the aromas waffling from the kitchen is memorizing.

Everything that I have ordered here is Amazing. From the toasts that you can order straight from the counter, or one of the menu items, everything is on point, and prepared to an elevated level. If you do come here, you must also try the coffee and espressos. They are probably some of the best in town.

Whenever you come here, you will most likely see a packed room. Food doesn't lie and people know what's good. I don't go out of my way to be a regular at any restaurant... except for PublicUS. This is a place I would expect to find on Santa Monica Blvd in LA, not in Vegas, but I'm glad it's here.

For example, a coffee rub roast beef sandwich with horseradish aioli.  The staff is friendly and attentive, and are always willing to provide recommendations (probably because they know the menu items are pretty unique).  Also, make sure to save room for dessert!  The bread pudding and rookies are to die for!

The drinks are very good as well.  My personal favorite was the sparkling white tea with Yuzu.  It was very refreshing.  My friend had the macadamia nut coffee, which was way too strong for me, but I am sure many would appreciate it.

The atmosphere is perfect for studying/working or just chatting with friends.    There are picnic tables with artificial trees sticking out of the middle of them, which makes you feel as if you are dining at an upscale park.

Once I stepped in, I had a feeling this place was going to be great. Such a beautiful interior! For goodness sake, even their bathroom is the coolest bathroom I've ever encountered. Go take a peek at their bathroom. (Yes, I am aware of how weird that sounds.)

The friendly and enthusiastic man at the front greeted us and walked us first timers through the breakfast menu with his recommendations.

For a specialty drink, I would highly recommend the espresso old-fashioned. (No, there's no alcohol in it.) PublicUs's version is thicker and richer than any other espresso old-fashioned I've tried. I would order this again! The shaken almond milk latte, cannon, and Amarillo hop iced tea were just ok by comparison. (Don't get me wrong; the shaken almond milk latte is good, but I would order the espresso old-fashioned over the shaken almond milk latte any day.)

For food, we ordered the Soppresatta, smoked salmon toast, and waffle. Although all of them were absolutely delicious, I will forever remember their waffle. Why? I've been on a quest for the perfect waffle, and I can finally say my quest is over! Huzzah! Their waffle a delightfully perfect balance between crispy and fluffy. Personally, I don't like to douse my waffle in syrup and butter. All it needs is mixed berries and a hint of syrup, if any. Oh my goodness, perfection. Dang it... My mouth is watering!

Anyhoo, we walk in, and there are plants, knick-knacks, coffee-making items, and natural and artificial lights everywhere. It's like...a modern antique shop...that sells coffee and food...you'll know what I mean.

So we walk up to the big counter to order, and notice that the employees here are very serious about their jobs. Some might say too serious, but I think that people who are passionate about what they do are allowed to show that. They look very dedicated, with their cool hairstyles, great recommendations, and industrial-esque work aprons. 

We got the waffle for the people, which comes plain, and we added whipped cream and mixed berries. We also ordered a mint cream coffee, all of which we shared. 

The waffle had a homey, cakey taste, refreshed by the berries and cream, and sweetened by the bit of syrup they offer on the side. The flavors, combined with it being served on a plate that could belong to my Grandma, made the meal both trendy, and nostalgic - much like the interior. 

The mint cream coffee was refreshing, too! I'm not much one for coffee, so I couldn't tell you if it was better than others, but I do like the occasional special drink. The mint option looked the most appealing to me at the time, and I think it went well with the waffle we ordered. The coffee might have been a bit sweet, however. Still delicious!

There aren't many places I would say I'd return to in Las Vegas, so this is one of the special few.",m3VudXLzVbgMw1BWy7q4Ug,4,4,5,gQLI23ey33apuVMvfYWSKg

With their communal style seating and openly inviting atmosphere, its no wonder this place gets packed. 

I ordered an almond milk latte and their eggs benedict. The iced almond milk latte was just right, i dont get too creative with my drinks but I know they have an excellent selection. 

My breakfast was amazing. It had spinach, carrots, very crispy potatoes which were amazing, sourdough and the perfectly blended spices on top. The eggs were poached perfect and was not dry when you finally took that first cut. 

They give you a number for when they bring you your food. The seating is very communal but what I love about this concept is that gives you opportunity to meet new people or dogs since they let you bring dogs in.

I met a new friend just sitting down. Break the ice and saying hello is the best way to make things less awkward. 

Anyway, the one thing publicus is missing are outlets. HOWEVER, if they had outlets, more people would stick around longer meaning they'd prevent others from enjoying this gem at downtown.",_UczakmbJlCal7mCXuq7og,3,2,5,o7W1WGRRIxWYEkX-yLc5qA

1518415,2015-04-15,1,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,"Coffee geeks of Las Vegas, consider this your new home.

After living overseas for 10 years, my biggest gripe with Las Vegas is that there is no decent espresso and no real coffee enthusiasts.  Sunrise coffee is delish and Sambalatte will do in a pinch, but after years in Brazil and Dubai I'm more accustomed to baristas and owners that seriously geek out over their coffee.  You know, the ones who drone on and on about how their beans are cultivated, harvested, transported, roasted. . .their best preparations, etc. while your mouth is watering just watching them prepare your coffee. The REAL coffee geeks usually share a passion and border-line obsession with coffee, rather than factoids that the owners made them memorize before becoming a barista.  

PublicUs is all that, and a bag of chips.

The barista (Cole I think is his name?) made a stellar cappuccino.  And as the NUMBER TWO BARISTA IN THE NATION why wouldn't he?  That's right, he apparently placed second in the nation.  This should be advertised on the website, btw!  The espresso machine is a work of art.  He timed his shots.  His latte art was impeccable.  The coffee tasted divine and wasn't a BOWL of cappuccino like they give you at chain coffee places.  The cappuccino was accompanied by the most delicious, fresh biscotti (also used in their affogato).

The only reason this place gets four stars is because, as other reviewers noted, the rest of the staff seemed a bit clueless.  Cole greeted us upon entry and was able to answer questions about the food and the coffee in detail.  The rest of the staff were very nice, yet seemed like they'd had one too many hits of medicinal marijuana.  They didn't seem to have much of an opinion about the food or much knowledge about the bags of beans they sell.  In fact, I hardly noticed they were there at all.  

All in all, a great addition to the Vegas coffee scene.",oLt_fYaEzo3MVYbg_97dSg,1,1,4,Br55ddFdW5mzpW2A-wz8Jg

I've eaten here a couple times and the food is inbetween a 3 and 4; probably a solid 3.5. Like the food is good and it's well prepared but is it amazing? Not really. Today I got a beet salad that I quite enjoyed. It had red and golden beets, arugula (my fav), grapefruit, and I added chicken. It was good and I ate allllll of it but is it something I'll crave? Probably not. They also have a mint coffee that's kinda like the mint mojito from Phil'z.

I decided to order breakfast for my husband and myself and my friend who was in another suite at our hotel and needed breakfast as well. 
I ordered two breakfast sandwiches which Turkey Bacon on a grilled or toasted roll with avocado and a very tasty butter and herb spread. I also ordered the oatmeal and added a note to add banana to the oatmeal. 
The sandwiches were AMAZING and full of flavor. The oatmeal was good once I found some honey to add for added sweetness as the fruit on the oatmeal (Blueberry, raspberry, blackberry and banana) was good but I wanted a little more sweetness so I grabbed some honey from my hotel lobby and that made it perfect. 
The food was hot and fresh and again very tasty. So good in fact that during our two hour lunch break during training I ordered lunch from here via the UberEATS app again. We ordered the sliced turkey sandwich (sub turkey bacon) and The Freekeh which were both tasty and satisfying. In addition I ordered ginger beers which were good as well.

walking in its definitely a hipster vibe. it's very nice inside. if you're in college I'd imagine it's a great place to relax, study and get coffee.
I ordered the brekkie burrito and the smashed avocado toast. I also got an iced chocolate mocha. it was very bittersweet which I surprisingly loved. I added vanilla because they said it would make it sweeter-- I strongly discourage doing that. it would have been better without it. but still delicious anyway.
the avocado toast was so good even though it was so simple. it's literally avocado smashed on sour dough rye with a poached egg and some grape tomatoes. not a fan of sourdough bread but it all melted together very nicely.
I got the brekkie burrito which is chorizo (your choice of beef or soy) Chipotle potatoes, refried beans, and some other stuff. it comes with salsa and sour cream. both the toast and burrito came with mini spring greens salads.
I was surprised how filling the avocado toast was. all in all the food was delicious but very pricey. I paid almost $30 for my toast, burrito, and drink. 

I arrived at around 8am. breakfast is until 11. definitely wanna stop by again and try their lunch!!

1541078,2016-10-16,1,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,"ugh.

I came in here super hungry and left unsatisfied. First of all, it's not a place you sit down and order. It's kinda like a fast food restaurant where you order first, then sit down. They probably need to show some signs about ""order here"" or something like that as we were kinda confused when we walked in.  I ordered their ""breakfast sandwich"" and it was totally not what I expected from their description. I also tried their bowl, quiche, and their bread pudding. 

The breakfast sandwich is basically a burger without a patty....Also totally didn't expect them to give me a burger bun as their bread. The egg was also a bit over cooked where it didn't really explode when you eat it. After eating that, I was already disappointed and agitated. 

However, their bowl was actually quite lovely even though I'm not too big of a fan of only veggies but it was quite refreshing and the taste was nice. Everything kinda work together. What made me close to giving it a 3 star was probably their bread pudding. It tasted great and it had a nice crunch to it. It might be one of the better bread pudding I had. 

At the end, I just couldn't forget how unsatisfying that ""breakfast sandwich"" was but my two friends said they think it's a 3 cause they had something different from mine. So take what you want from this review as I probably won't come back(I know how unfair it might sound). It's probably a place where the items are hit and misses and I just happened to miss the target.",SqjP1cV8JwDdN0K9QULzog,2,0,2,t1P8IGABnrdGBSWXSmtgiw
1546670,2016-11-01,0,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,"Decided to try this place out since a friend was in town. We were greeted by Thomas once we entered the door. He could clearly see that it was our first visit and walked us over to where the menus were. We made it in time for breakfast (7AM-11AM) and ordered the brekkie sandwich ($10.00), garden farm breakfast ($13), and lime iced green teas ($4.50). 

The brekkie sandwich arrived with a side rocket salad. Inside the sandwich were two generous strips of bacon, avocado, cheddar cheese, and two sunny (and runny) side up eggs all resting in a brioche bun. The farm fresh eggs totally make the difference as the yolk was a beautiful golden color. I will be back for this sandwich! (4/5)

The garden farm breakfast includes carrots, asparagus, swiss chard, tomatoes, poached eggs, crisp smashed potatoes, and grilled bread. This is mostly topped with a DELICIOUS brown butter hollandaise! My only complaint was that I wish it had more of it! (3/5)

Lime iced green tea was very refreshing. It's the first time I've seen it offered on any menu in town and will definitely stop by when I'm walking through town just for this! 

Again, I would like to shine the spotlight on Thomas and thank him for his awesome customer service! 

PublicUs provides a great space for meetings, catching up with friends, or sitting down and reading a good book while having delicious food in Downtown Las Vegas.

First, I hate coffee shop reviews because I don't know you and you don't know me. Are you the: ""Hey I like a shot of coffee in my creamer kinda coffee person?"" ""Keurig rocks!"" ""There's different kinds of coffee?"" ""Starbucks only man"" or like me: freshly roasted beans, coffee comes from a fruit and we should taste the fruit, hand crafted, made to order, taste the multi-deminsions of the coffee. PublicUs fits my criteria for wonderful coffee.

Their coffee is made to order. If you like sweet, their Death Cream is great. They have homemade almond milk based drinks too. But for us coffee purists, you'll be rewarded by a good pour over or espresso. The staff is knowledgeable answering questions about the coffee every time. Cole, the front of house manager, knows his coffee and scrutinizes the drink recipes proving flavorful yet balanced coffee drinking experiences. Tell the staff what you like regarding coffee and they'll help you make the right choice. 

Some of the reviews regarding sugar and condiment practices are unwarranted. I've never seen the staff deny the sugar. DON'T DENY ME MY SUGAR!!!! We've become so ingrained to thinking there better be a little station present where I dump my coffee into 55 sugar packets -- yeah, I said it that way intentionally :) But this place provides sugar, just ask and they deliver it. Not sweet enough? Ask, they put more in there. Remember, they're not stingy with the sugar . . . Disco Stu got hooked on the white stuff back in the 70's man . . . Disco Stu would like this place. 

Vegan? (you know you tell everyone too) they have something for you. 
Meat lover? Yes! 
Gluten free? (you tell people too) Yes
Pork Belly? Yes! 
Dessert? Yes!
Desert? Yes, have some!
Beer? Yes!
Date place? Yes

They have champion baristas making your coffee bean crack, so expect to wait a bit. They have a full menu that changes daily, with a wide array of baked goods. 

Try the roasted potatoes they are my favorite.

I think this is a good place to catch up with friends & grab food for breakfast or lunch but it's a terrible place to study. There's hardly any charging outlets ! I think there was probably only like two corners where you can charge your laptop lol.
Personally not a fan of the drinks - I had their coffee a few times & no matter what I got it was really sour tasting :( Didn't even wake me up either , or maybe I'm just immune to caffeine now with the amounts I drink nowadays.
However , the food here is really good to make up for their drinks. I heard their menu changes every now and then so if you look at photos on Yelp they might not have it anymore. Last time I came here I only ordered their fried chicken which included kimchi , pickled cucumbers and rice w/ a fried egg on top. It's fire. Price though .. pretty expensive for what it is. I think I paid around 15-16$ for my meal ? Add a drink too , maybe a pastry or dessert then your bill can easily be 20$+-25$+ here.

I asked if it would be possible to have a simple cheese omelette. The girl said that I could done.  Then I see the owner pull her aside and tell her they couldn't make a special omelette for me. Basically bc I don't eat pork, I couldn't have just have a cheese omelet. Shame on him. That was a poorly handled situation.  if you are willing to make food to order, people are going to have diet restrictions. And when we asked why, we were told bc everything is prepped and pre made...
Okay... I guess... So do they just microwave the omelettes? 
My friend and I have both worked food and beverage for 10 years... And that's not how we would ever treat our guests.... But I guess that's how they do business here.

Opted for their cold press ""Cannon"" coffee special- brew plus lime, simple syrup, and a few other unexpected ingredients yielding an iced beverage that looks like tea, tastes like coffee, and gave me enough of a caffeine boost to be twitchy shortly after finishing it. Good option for hot Vegas days!

Menu of breakfast toasts and egg dishes, plus a case of pastries, is surprisingly well-executed. The SOPPRESATTA was a success- sourdough toast topped with two fried eggs, black truffle cream and fig vinaigrette was a combination of unexpected flavors sided with a simple salad and fried potatoes and onions.

No seriously, if you could wrap up everything I love in one place, this would be it. 

The bff Amelinda L. brought me in on one of my trips back to Vegas, and it was just incredible. We ordered a couple coffee drinks (one was a pour-over of the Geisha blend/type, the second was the espresso Old Fashioned), and amongst the two (teehee) of us, we split three tartines and a slice of their quiche. As a somewhat self-described bread snob (I've recently been baking sourdough bread, SF Tartine style), the sourdough was tasty and the toppings were thoughtfully put on and well-seasoned. Everything was also reasonably priced. Service was attentive and just-right, as Goldilocks would say. 

As far as ambiance goes, it's a perfect blend of being quiet without being too quiet, although to be fair, I went on a weekday morning versus rush hour times. Beautiful furniture and artwork completed the experience for me. There is some faux greenery around, as well as beautifully constructed furniture and probably one of the nicest bathrooms in Las Vegas.

The first time we got a salad with fried quail egg which was really different and tasty, we got their steak and egg which was alright, and Forbidden Rice which we did not care for. 

The second time we got: Meat Frittata which was so good, the frittata is fluffy, with spam and various veggies, very good! We tried both the breakfast toast which were both really good: the one with advocate had yuzu juice in it which gave it such great flavors, the one with egg and ham was amazing! 

We also got the Beef Thai Salad, which they gave us chicken instead because they were out of the beef...this dish was very bland and plain. I'm not sure why it is called Thai salad... the dressing did not taste Thai-like at all, it actually didn't taste like there were any dressing on the salad at all.

The EB was outstanding poached eggs served over spinach garlic roasted potatoes fresh tomatoes and veggies (asparagus Brusselsprouts carrots).

As soon as I walked in I was greeted and given a menu, then explained how the ordering works. It's basically fast casual where you order and pay at the counter, get a number, and they bring the food out to you. Everyone was super nice and one of the girls explained different menu items to us. They had a long list of coffee drinks, including their take on coffee cocktails, (no alcohol) such as an Old Fashioned which is made with espresso, lemon, and muddled cherries. (I got to try this and it was delicious). Such a fun and new concept! It would be a little easier if there were descriptions of the coffee drinks on the menu, because we had to ask what pretty much every drink was. 

I had a hard time making a decision on what to eat and drink because everything sounded good. I finally decided on the iced Macadamia Nut latte, Sopresatta, and a brookie to eat later. The latte was outstanding! It had little pieces of macadamia nut in it, and a sweet macadamia flavor, it was really good. It was supposed to be made with almond milk, as suggested to me by the cashier, but I saw the guy making it and he used regular milk. It doesn't matter to me what kind of milk is used, and I don't think I was charged extra, but the principle bothers me a bit. The good news is he was trying to be proactive and make the drink quickly, the bad news is he jumped the gun and used the wrong milk. Again-not a big deal to me, but it could be a problem if someone were lactose intolerant or something. 

The Sopresatta was delicious. It had ham, fried eggs, black truffle cream, and fig vinaigrette all on top of sourdough toast. I also ordered a side of the fingerling potatoes. When I got my food, I was surprised to see that fingerling potatoes already came with my meal. It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu and no one bothered to mention that to me, so I ended up paying $3 for food I did not need. I found the potatoes to be very bland anyway so I was disappointed. Other items I sampled were the salmon toast which was amazing, and the berry waffle which Imo was just okay. My meal, drink, dessert, and the extra potatoes brought my total to $26 without tip. Although not close to me, I would probably stop in again.

Edit- I forgot to give my review of the brookie, which is a brownie/cookie with caramel filling. This was forgettable, and I didn't enjoy it. I actually gave it to someone else to eat, which is surprising because I usually love dessert. Also, one of the girls I was dining with had a lemon macaron, and she said she didn't like it either.

PublicUs is one of those hybrids between fast food and traditional sit down restaurant. You place your order at the counter, get a number, find a seat, and it is delivered to you. It reminds me of SkinnyFats in ways, just in decor and style. 

I ordered the jambalaya and it was a hearty portion, served with pork and shrimp. A great kick, not too spicy, but just flavorful enough. At first, I thought it was just meat, broth and veggies with bread to sop it up (no rice), but when I cut into what I thought was bread, I was in for a surprise! It was like a crunchy patty with rice on the inside. Very clever! I probably would have preferred to have regular rice, but it was a unique take on the dish.

Prices hovered around $12 on average per entree, which I thought was fair. They had a good looking selection of desserts, but I resisted the urge to sample them.

I was pleased to discover that the Waffles For the People now comes in a half portion for kids, and is the same amount as the ~old full serving.
Thanks for being more generous, PublicUs!

My kids loved their food. Even my 11 year old who often eats adult-sized portions could only finish half of his waffles.
It's WORTH IT to add the lavender whipped cream and berries. 

I always love the Shaken Almond Milk Latte. It has a comforting natural sweetness to it without being overbearing.

It's very aesthetic as well, which is always a plus to any environment.

I often will spend a few hours working here it's always comfortable. Others have always been respectful of each other as they're in their ""zone"".

My shaken almond latte was prepared in a cocktail shaker by an award-winning barista while I contemplated ordering some eye-catching plated desserts and checked out the unique decor with its steampunk influences.

We had the Corned Beef Hash, a Hot Cross Bun, a Salmon and Egg Toast, omelette and panko-crusted egg salad thingie. All of our food was very good to delicious.

Public Us is not your typical fancy, new and shiny place to be seen touristy place. It's where the locals go and actually hang out to have coffee. Their coffee is amazing! It's almost too pretty to sip. It's an art and has no acid-like finish yet it's strong flavored. I've been to this place twice now and I'm still amazed by it. The amount of work that the owners put into this place speaks about their passion. Their passion also translates into their handcrafted artisan breads, which they make in house. If I lived downtown, I'd probably wake up early everyday and have their coffee and bread in the morning. Too bad I'm on the opposite side of town otherwise, I would love to come here often even just to appreciate the craftsmanship that went into creating such a nice space. 
We had the roast beef sandwich and the Korma Karma sandwich. Both of them were freshly made and had just the right amount of flavor. The roast beef was very tender and the small side salad complimented the sandwich very well. Did I mention how much I loved their bread? I wish they sold it in loaves and I could take some with me to go. It's a rustic crusty bread - which was still soft yet the crust still had the right amount of crunch.

Cons: Food is disappointingly meh, *and* the portions are skimpy. One single public power outlet in the entire joint. Uncomfortable, vibration-prone community tables might drive you crazy.

I ordered ""The Traditionalist"" breakfast which came out with some of the worst breakfast eggs I've ever been served in an actual restaurant. What were supposed to be ""scrambled soft"" eggs came out well-done and weirdly minced. What's going on, chef? Potatoes on the plate were skimpy - less than 2 ounces? The small scattering of mixed greens were out of place (to fill empty space?) on the breakfast plate, and the homemade toast was nothing to write home about. Bacon was decent and average thickness, but you only get 2 small pieces of it. $12 for this breakfast plate is a pretty bad value. You should have to pass a test to serve breakfast professionally. Wow, those eggs were bad!

Same goes for the ""sides"" of protein on the lunch-dinner menu - don't expect a whole, or even half breast of chicken to show up if you order the side. You will get 4 or 5 small slices, for a sushi roll price. I fell for it - oops!

WiFi is pretty fast here, and that's great. And here's an Easter egg: any lone beer order comes with a complimentary side of homemade paprika'd potato chips because of the particular liquor license they possess.

Unfortunately for customers with work to do, there is only *one* single public power outlet in the entire restaurant, *and* the main picnic-table style community tables are disturbingly vibration-prone. If there is anybody else seated at your table, you will feel absolutely every hand movement, fork-to-plate, elbow bump, etc. from the other end of the table. I know this sounds totally crazy, but this is not an exaggeration. I'd be returning those picnic tables to their maker for additional stability supports.

Also, the hard truth: quality ingredients cost more money. 

I am not a fan of the community tables, but I was highly impressed by their restrooms. Is that weird? They have these giant sliding barn doors that I adore.

I also loved that they had a selection of organic and vegan friendly foods! 

I ordered their vegan toast which had roasted asparagus, artichoke, and tomatoes on a pesto spread. The only reason I didn't enjoy it was because it was burnt...like the edges were all black and extremely hard to bite into:( but the middle part was good.
I also had the brussel sprouts salad! It was a little on the spicier side but I loved it.
Can't forget about the almond milk latte. It lived up to the hype!

Parking is right next to the restaurant in a large lot so you won't have a problem finding parking or paying! (It's free!)

I went for breakfast and had the brekkie sandwich with avocado and potatoes. For my drink I chose the latte with mint syrup in it (my own creation or so I was told). The latte was so good. I will be back for more. 
The sandwich was a bit greasy. The bacon was thick and I can appreciate that. The potatoes were so good. I could have eaten just a big bowl of those.

We went through the line and ordered some lunchies. It moved quickly, but we arrived in the nick of time, as the noon crowd followed right behind and clogged up the spot pretty quickly. The kind feller at the cashier station was friendly, quirky, and not easily embarrassed. They were oozing smiles there, and they walked around in the craftsman-like aprons. Hard to know if they were about to pour coffee or turn pine on a lathe. Hint: It's the coffee. I'm pretty sure.

Kudos for having normal human sized glasses for water, and for having a creative area to dispense it from mega-filtered taps. The avo toast looked serious, but I opted for the Cubano and it was fine. Chips weren't fully crisp but were fine. It's a coffee shop first, so don't expect va va va voom from the food, but it was good.

We grabbed a seat by the window and sat at wavy tables under trees that grew up from the center of them. Movers and shakers (not gamblers nor ruffians) hang out here.

There were four of us for brunch and while the restaurant was busy it wasn't a lineup out the door or anything, so the service should not have been as slow and disjointed as it was. All four entrees came out separately, which was annoying. The first to come out were the waffles, which were dry and unimpressive, and a side of bacon which was practically raw. Next was a side of Portuguese sausage that was quite tasty. After that the eggs Benedict came out which looked like quite a mess on a plate. Then my traditional brekkie came out. It was fine, and even though I said no toast it came with toast. 35 minutes later our guest went to inquire with the manager about the vegan burger in our order, since one of the female runners I asked about it to looked at me like I had three heads and never came back with an update. The manager comped the burger and it came out about 8 minutes later.

I asked for a sparkling drink which the cashier asked how sweet we'd like it and recommended one then if we'd like more they'll add more upon request.

First impression was the really cool and unique design elements that went in to creating the dining space.  Very different from any other Vegas foodie find. The bathrooms were also done up very differently with rustic elements of unfinished copper and finely polished wood.  The staff immediately greeted us as we entered.  We looked over the menu which had the appearance of ""farm to table"" approach to dining with hints of organic and locally sourced ingredients.  

Ordering at the counter is the routine.  All the whileyou are being tempted by the fresh pastries staring at you from behind the glass partition.  One day I will conquer you but for now it was time for breakfast.  I prefer savory over sweet 99% of the time fro breakfast and i was not going to changed that now no matter how tempting.  

Coffee and cappuccino to start everyone off.  The coffee was nice and strong and the cappuccino was almost too beautiful to drink with the heart pattern floating on the top.  Nice touch.  Our group ordered the Skillet breakfast with bratwurst, french toast, and a waffle.  The dishes came out in a timely manner.  My skillet breakfast was a little small and the bratwurst was overcooked slightly.  Almost like it was cooked prior and left to settle in a hot well.  The dish also lacked salt which is an easy fix of course but when you are preparing high quality food the chef should be able to incorporate all flavors effectively.  
The waffle was very light and crisp.  However the syrup it came with was very spicy.  I am not sure if it had way to much nutmeg or what but after consuming a taste it almost burned like a cayanne pepper. We brought it to there attention while leaving so they could clear up the issue.  French toast had good flavor but was slightly under cooked in some sections making it mushy.  

At the time of this meal Publicus was a month in to there ""soft opening phase"".  I really welcome a great place like this to the DTLV community.  The large table seating is great for conversation starting.  Why not talk to complete strangers?  During this trip, kitchen execution had not been perfected but I am sure they will get there soon.  I look forward to giving Publicus another shot and hope they pull off their earthy recipes flawlessly.

I then asked if I could get a sugar packet on the side, they again refused. I have never been anywhere that refused to allow me to sweeten my own drink.

Now, I'm writing this for imagery, but it was a cool spot and I'd sit here again if I got the chance. It was perfectly private to boot. 

We went halfsies on a chipotle chicken sandwich that was spicy and fresh. I wasn't too drawn in to a lot of the menu, but this sandwich had me hooked before and after we shared it.

And the prices aren't outrageous- only $9 for a specialty latte and a huge cinnamon roll- Most of the meals are around $10.

We walk in and the first thing I notice was how unique the design was. I have never seen a place that looks like this. I love the wooden tables with a tree as a center piece thang they had goin in there.

I ordered their Waffle and a Shaken almond latte.. I was a little disappointed when Lane, the manager had told me the batter for the waffle wasn't ready... So I chose the Bacon Apple Omelette with no extra charge.

You can park in front on Maryland Parkway but it only runs one way that is going south.  Once inside there  don't sit on the side of Fremont Street because you will soon get depressed and feel guilty as some of the people that walk by are less fortunate than yourself.  You are in air condition eating your fancy scone and specialty coffee while they are out in the heat looking for their next meal, I just wanted to leave the building and go out and feed everyone.   Their drink offerings are spot on but the food is hit and miss. The fennel sausage in dough was not to my liking and some of their pastries are too soggy.  No honey for your tea either.    Now for the PROS:  Parking is plentiful on the side of the building.  Once inside the atmosphere is a cool hip vibe with cool music, lots of seating and communal tables.  Some food is displayed in front on cute pedestals made of wood core.  I liked the flavor of the Ox-tail soup, their cookies are good and the employees are very accommodating,  Prices are reasonable.",Ix4omDKVL73yL14QhIeieQ,0,0,3,v5JDLUENWa97BLUDUE_Dsw

Nieves I. and I decided to both get the Avo toast and iced macadamia latte. She had hers with bacon, I took a bite of the bacon and it was probably one of the best bacons I've ever tasted.

I could start this review by enumerating the dizzying array of filth I stumbled through in Las Vegas this weekend, but you've heard it all before. After all, this is about PublicUs, an amazing establishment, with delicious food and an excellent atmosphere that brings joy to its patrons regardless of what lays beyond its walls.

Food:
I got the 'Traditional Brekkie'. When I ordered it, I was very uneasy about saying the word 'brekkie'. I was worried I would sound silly and thought: should I just say 'traditional breakfast' ? If I don't say 'brekkie' am I acknowledging that I don't think 'brekkie' sounds cool? Is that rude? Or maybe it's a test and if I am comfortable with myself I should confidently say 'brekkie'. Or maybe it's another test where cool regulars just say 'the traditional' and I will sound like a bay area bobo. So is it cool to say 'brekkie'? Is it cool to NOT say 'brekkie', I am not sure. Are the words that come of out our mouths ever truly our own anyway? As our thoughts shoot from our brain, ping off the forehead of the nearest barista, and pong back onto our tongue, they are transformed by experiences past and present, and they are shaped by our hopes for the future. In art, in food, in you, in me, in all things, the whirling and twirling mass of atoms and energy generate uniqueness and oneness all at the same time. As Bernard Jaffe in I Heart Huckabees once said, ""...If you look close enough, you can't tell where my nose ends and space begins."". 

Oh yeah, so as I was saying, I got the Traditional Brekkie and it was perfectly portioned, delicious, well plated, potatoes had character, blah blah blah.

Also, I'd need another 500 words for my espresso review - which was a great experience in and of itself.

Also, I'd need another 1000 words to describe how great it was to sit down and eat really good brunch food without having to do a whole customer-waiter relationship. Sometimes I just want to eat good food out without having someone wait on me. Ya know - middle ground between two extremes. 'Canteen style' is where it's at - thanks guys.

The staff is fantastic! Love watching them, (hope I don't sound too creepy). Love that you can tell how much they enjoy what they do by the way that they make every meal. The care they put into making everything is a great sight to see.

Went with my boss the first time. She LOVED it. The blueberry cream cheese scone is to die for! I've never tasted scones and am not a big fruit person, but i tried it, and YUM! My boss and her sister were born in South Africa and both agree that they had not tasted a scone so good and so similar to the one back home, EVER! Good job Hemant!

Also had the Shaved Prosciutto Sandwich and again, it's to die for! Have never had such good Ciabatta and guess what? I am also obsessed with it.

PublicUs is the perfect storm of everything being great in just the way it's supposed to be; great food, great decor, the coffee is inventive and delicious, plus the vibe is here great for getting some work done.  

As I walked in a server helped me with suggestions on food, drink and the ordering process. I went with the Soppresatta breakfast; with sourdough toast, black truffle cream, fried eggs with fig vinaigrette and a ""Old Fashioned"", which is basically an Old Fashioned with an espresso base and no alcohol. 

The Soppresatta was a fantastic choice with deep rich flavors and interesting combinations. The black truffle cream teetered on the brink of being too salty, but the fig vinaigrette held it back. In this town it's hard to find a properly poached egg for some reason, but PublicUS nailed it with this plate, runny yolk and truffle cream? Beat still my beating heart. 

The true highlight of the entire meal was the ridiculous Old Fashioned Espresso drink. Built in a rocks glass, this is a cold espresso drink with bitters and orange zest all poured over an ice ball. This was surprisingly refreshing and intriguing at the same time. No one flavor overpowered the other; they all cohesively worked well together. It was so good I ordered two during my stay.

This is probably one of my new favorite spots downtown. I will be here frequently, and you all should too. They have a nightly happy hour from 8- close and it's got some pretty decent food and drinks on it. The ambiance is absolutely wonderful. It's like modern met nature and had public us as a baby. It's going to make a great study spot this semester. 

       The service is very attentive and accommodating. You order and pay at the counter and they deliver your food to you. Every question I asked had an answer. They understood and accommodated my vegan needs which was a huge plus in my book. The servers wear the coolest aprons I've ever seen. They are all custom and it's a detail I really appreciate. 

       The food... So I ordered the vegan coconut sweet potato soup. It was a large portion and so delicious. The texture was creamy and smooth. It really is on par with the vegan soups that WILD (RIP) had on their menu. The Pinot Gris was on happy hour and it was actually very good. It created a perfect balance of acidity with the sweetness of the soup. I also tried the carrot and beet salad that my friend ordered. It was seriously so delicious and fresh. The colors of the dish were bright and crisp. It had the perfect amount of crunch to balance the smoothness of the soup. Our friend also ordered the tuna melt. He loved it! It came with homemade potato chips. My boyfriend ordered some type of fish dish. He really seemed to enjoy that as well. 

     They have some crafty bottled beers and a variety of wines and champagnes to choose from. They also had a cocktail menu that we weren't aware of until the end that we can't wait to try. The desserts... They brought us out complimentary brookies that everyone went crazy for. I wasn't able to eat them because they weren't vegan, but they looked delicious. They also brought us out a bread pudding to try. Once again... The response was raving at the table and it was finished in no time. It also was not vegan, but everyone said they would order it again. Vegan desserts coming soon guys! 

    The general managers name was Lane. He was such a nice man. You can tell he genuinely cared about his staff and patrons. This detail really makes me wish I could give more than five stars.

I had the corned beef hash and it was really good - they don't hold back on the (chiptole?) sauce, which packs a nice punch.  Great brunch option, and paired well with my delicious coffee.  Fruit platter is also fun, with fun presentation of nicely sliced fruit carefully arrayed over a little yogurt.

3107399,2017-09-30,1,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,"So, I saw all of the rave reviews on here and went with high expectations. The two stars are solely for the artwork and the way the place is designed. Super creative and a ton of cool stuff for you to look at. The kitchen is open so you can watch the cooks making your food, they also have most of their menu items on display for you to look at. So, like I said the two stars are for those factors only.

Adding on to the ambience, this is probably the most strange place for a coffee shop. Would not expect it to be right here or look like that on the inside. Do not sit outside, bums will ask you for directions while you're trying to eat. The surrounding area is a ran down and old part of vegas. Not the good ran down and old like the arts district, either.

We ordered the brekkie sandwich, mine with bacon & his with ""Portuguese"" sausage. The egg on the sandwich is supposed to be over easy but I literally was not cooked all the way through. They could've left it for one more freakin minute. The bread was sweet, which completely threw me off. The best part of my sandwich was the bacon. Also, it came served with a salad? Hmm. 

 The worst part was the coffee. I ordered their dark chocolate mocha iced, with almond milk. I believe their glasses are probably 16 oz. I asked how many shots of espresso came in it and he held up 2 fingers. I asked for an extra shot. I couldn't taste the coffee or the chocolate at all. The almond milk had a watered down taste to it and I think that's what ruined the drink. Very disappointing.",293T3nTHclAV2JvKk5_XRg,1,0,2,Cw637geplptujLmxJrEYtg

Not going to lie I was kinda let down badly by my meal. Last few times I came in I never got food. Today was different. I ordered the ham and cheese croissant. It came out with burnt ham and somehow was cold. Burnt and cold? Don't get the logic on that one.

The waffles didn't have any flavor. Very weak flavor overall. I added berries and syrup and it didn't help. They didn't even give me enough syrup to cover my waffles. Didn't feel it was worth the money for either :(

The blueberry scone was good. I got it last time with my coffee. The scone should not be better then the meal, that's for sure.

Next time I come in I'll stick with my coffee and scone. I gave this place a 3 star for their employees alone. A manager should be walking around making sure everyone is happy with their food.

PublicUs does not disappoint in the genre.  A little different from other sit down establishments, you get in line to order and then find a seat afterwards.  

We went for brunch and noticed that most of the menu items were around$7-$10.  We had a breakfast sandwich and a pesto, scrambled egg dish.  The sandwich was as good as it gets, though a little messy.  The scrambled eggs were unique but honestly the dish was not a good rendition on scrambled eggs.  I think they were trying too hard to make it new and unusual but seemed to miss.  The coffee was good but small and over-priced.

Still the atmosphere and bakery items looked exceptional.  It has a Portland type of feel but it's located in a slummy part of downtown.  I liked it.  I would definitely come back and try their lunch menu as they don't close until 7pm, unlike many of the other similar venues in the area.

I'm not sure if there's a private lot for this eatery, but we were able to easily find street parking right out front, near the entrance. 

When we walked in, we were quickly greeted by one of the employees. He showed us their fresh baked goods and their daily specials which were on display behind a glass partition. 

We both decided on the Brekkie sandwich, which comes with either bacon or Portuguese sausage, two runny eggs (omg yum!), cheddar cheese, and aioli on a really soft bun. It also comes with a small, light salad and potato chips. Both sides were very tasty and fresh. 

My boyfriend isn't a breakfast food person but he really enjoyed his (with the portuguese sausage) and I absolutely loved mine. Right when you bite into it, the yolk just oozes out. That's how you know they cooked the egg perfectly! 

Aside from the amazing breakfast sandwiches we had, the interior space was amazing. The tables, kitchen area, bathroom, and all the decor was very well thought out. It looked very trendy, yet comfortable, which makes the space work so well.

After a couple visits several months apart I've got mixed feelings about the mixed berry muffin. The first time it was a wonderful mix of berries in a soft, squishy muffin with a crystalized sugar coating that added a nice contrast in textures. The second time the muffin was dry and crumbly.

There are plenty of other items to like. The Forbidden fried rice ($13) looked small, but was enough to satisfy with tiny cubes of pork mixed in the toothsome rice, covered in a sweet yakitori sauce. And I can't forget about the egg on top. After cutting into it and mixing everything together I got the full effect of all the components combing for a memorable dish.

That was the lone savory item I tried. My sweet tooth got the best of me on both occasions and I also tried the brookie ($3), part cookie, part brownie. It was the brownie that won out. Moist, chewy, and dense, it was the superior element of the two. The bourbon banana bread ($3) was good too. Dense and cakey, I was a fan of the rich banana flavor, the texture, and the sweetness of it all which wasn't too extreme.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,5,4,p_bLoQKFv5ym3gZoH82tQQ

The sauce added a great flavor, and I loved the house made chips, the seasoning on them was perfect amounts of salty and smokey. 

The tart was just meh. They were pre sliced servings on plates behind the glass, so that should have been my first implication that it wasn't going to be that great but I gave it a shot.

The mint and coffee combo was good for the first 3 sips and then it was way too strong for me. I probably wouldn't order it again for $7. The orange cream soda, though, was absolutely delicious. It tasted like a 50/50 bar. There were little vanilla beans garnishing the top and I loved every sip. 
My dad and I split the coconut sweet potato soup and it was so good. It had a little bit of a Thai twist from the coconut milk base. It complimented the savory sweetness of the sweet potato very well. Mango chutney and sweet potato crisps were added on the top of the soup and it made it taste even better.
As my main course, I ordered the lavender creme & fruit plate. The lavender creme was wonderful with the different fruits. My favorite fruits in the creme were the pears and the grapes. 
Everyone else really enjoyed their food. The eggs benedict, fried chicken, and roast beef sandwich all received great remarks.

I received four light and crispy Belgian waffles topped with sliced fruit and blueberries/strawberries and airy vanilla whipped cream.  I also had the askinosie dark chocolate mocha.

I had a cappuccino with the heart swirl and there was a water bar for my daughter. The water bar was 3 faucets surrounded by small river rocks set into a bar at the back restaurant with glasses. Nice touch and free.
You order at the counter where you stand in line that goes by the array of delish treats that scream out for you to pick me.

Today we order an Espresso Old Fashioned, and the Lemon-lime iced green tea. Both ""mock tails"" were amazing! The presentation for the espresso old fashioned is very creative and is really seems as though your having the real deal.

I don't live anywhere near downtown but I will make the 30-40 minute drive for their delicious brunch options, hipster coffee, and earthy decor. 

FOOD: I've only had their brunch so I can't say much about their dinner items. All their food options are instagram worthy, especially the toasts with the fruits and vegetable mixture on top. I recommend the smashed avo toast, eggs benedict, and smoked salmon toasts. 

PASTRIES: I have a huge sweet tooth so pastries are always on my mind. They serve a wide variety of scones, muffins, croissants, etc. and it's always different. I've tried the blueberry cream cheese scone (super soft and moist), strawberry brownie cookie (chewyAF but still moist), mixed berry muffin (the best muffin that you will ever eat in your life), and they are ALL DELICIOUS. 

COFFEE/DRINKS: They serve the traditional expresso drinks (latte, americano, cappuccino, etc.), iced coffee, iced tea, hot tea, and specials (like sodas). I am in love with their old fashioned coffee, macadamia nut latte, and lemon lime green tea. FYI, the baristas are always on point with their latte art --very impressive. 

AMBIANCE: They have wooden table tops/chairs, a big tree in the middle of the room, and an overall earthy vibe that is refreshing. I love the large windows, spacious seating, and appreciate the small knick knack toys everywhere.

-Parking lot... They are scarce downtown
-staff was friendly
-clean

Less good stuff:
-took about 20 minutes to get a cup of pour over coffee because the barista forgot to make my drink. Even though no one else was in front or behind me in line...(he did bring a biscotti with it so that was nice though)
-not many plugs for laptops. Only 2 different corners with wall plugs so make sure your laptop is charged. 
-expensive. Not sure why my 1 cup of pour over coffee (couldn't have been more than 12 oz) was 5.65$. That's pretty steep.

I was greeted by one of the staff shortly after walking up to the counter area and asked if I was a first time visitor.  He explained to me where I ordered depending on food or just coffee order.

I looked at the menu for awhile and then placed my order.  Starter was oxtail soup, main dish was their coffee rubbed beef sandwich, and iced coffee for my drink.  Since I wasn't sure if I was going to have dessert or not, I went down the line to pay.  They swiped my credit card and left an open tab so I could add to it later if I did order dessert.

I took my #11 to a high top table on the Fremont Street side and was soon brought my iced tea and silverware.   I took the time waiting for my sandwich to enjoy the interior which is different and pleasant.  The a server brought the soup and the sandwich.

The soup has a Tom Ka broth base and had cherry tomato halves and mushrooms.  The soup had a lot of meat but it was only tepid at best.  It should have been heated much more.  The sandwich was quite good.  Sourdough bread filled with beef and pear-horseradish slaw, it was a tasty and filling sandwich.  The house made potato chips were underwhelming with several stuck together and damp as if something had been spilled on them.

I asked one of the servers if they had a choice of bread pudding or Black Forest which they would recommend.  He said the Black Forest without hesitation.  That's what I ordered and it was excellent.

I enjoyed my stop here.  I think it's a bit pricey and it certainly is in an area of town I don't often go.  I think this would be a good place for breakfast.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,12,8,3,zKQM1KLDfh_ydluLh-tBaQ

The staff are very helpful and friendly. 
The menu looked great, I had a hard time trying to decide what to order. If only I had cow's four stomachs it would make my deciding a lot easier. 

So I got the avocado toast and smoked salmon toast (both were recommended by the staff) and the forbidden rice. A glass of iced almond milk coffee and OJ to drink. 

Everything was great, simple food, prepared exceptionally well. They used quality ingredients and kept every fresh and clean. No added grease or mounds of cheese. 
I would highly recommend the avocado toast, great smashed avocado with hints of lemon with a perfectly poached egg on the other side of your toast. Perfect combo. 
Smoked salmon toast came with pieces of hard boiled egg, smoked salmon and cheese. Also a very good combo.
Forbidden rice was good, it did lack spice. It would have been perfect with some hot sauce/Sriracha. The rice would have been better if they were cooked a little longer. 

OJ was freshly squeezed juice from real oranges.

ATMOSPHERE
Trendy and amazing taste in decor. Plants by wooden tables that makes you feel like you are out to a picnic. Open kitchen where people can oversee everything that is going on. Big windows that brings the sunlight in but also gives you a peek of some old and vintage store signs of Downtown. I can go on and on. I do wish that they change the flooring, it just doesn't go right with the rest of interior. 

Check out their bathroom too. Do your business in extra hip bathroom. It is pretty dim so you won't get the perfect lighting for selfie but it's cool. 

SERVICE
Friendly and courteous. Smiles disappeared as they got more busy but servers behind the kitchen table are master of their craft. They perfect everything before bringing it out to the table. They are not just servers, they are artists.

FOOD
Ample selections of sandwich to salad to coffee. I went with Coffee Rubbed Roast Beef after seeing so many pictures on Yelp. Out of all the roast beef sandwiches I have tried in my life, it would probably rank #4. Thick cut of roast beef+pear horseradish=good. I wish the sandwich bread they used was softer/fluffier. I enjoyed the chips that came on the side.

Beef hash was interesting. I've never had a hash before (I don't even eat breakfast many days but if I do, I'm about that bagel life). Fried egg, spam, cherry tomatoes, potatoes, and few toasts on the side. Too fattening for me in the morning but still would rate it 4/5

Not a waiter service type of place more like a coffee shop or small cafe style where you order and pay at the register then pick your seats. You grab your own water in the water area and your own silverware and then they bring you whatever you ordered.

They have local baked goods and coffee for the person on the go and they have full meals and Mimosas for the brunchers.

I also enjoyed their selection of coffees and teas and tried the ginger London fog, on the barista's recommendation. Very good and unique.

While the space is beautiful with it's minimalist decor, I found the seating to be a bit uncomfortable and I think both the food and pricing somewhat contradict the whole order at the counter thing they have going on. 

My biggest complaint though has to be the menu... While it was nice that the staff were friendly and willing to answer any questions we had about different items, I feel like the menu should have been more descriptive so I didn't have to ask about every single drink to try to determine what to order. 

I eventually ordered a Schomer's macchiato and a waffle, which I added fruit to for $2. Both were just ok. I have had a far better waffle with fruit at no additional charge at another downtown eatery recently. The drink was tasty but not what I was expected based on the description the employee gave me.  I also got a brookie to go (combination brownie and cookie) and again, it was just ok, and not something I would get again. 

I sampled my dining companions meals and drinks, and realize that I would most likely have been far happier with my meal had I ordered different items.

4085902,2016-04-28,5,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,"PublicUs should have a couple of taglines.

""Ugly on the outside, beautiful on the inside."" That's the imaginary tagline for PublicUs. The outside of the building does not look like it would house a restaurant that has such a modern and sleek presentation. The tables are sleek, there is fake trees throughout the place that actually look good, everything looks clean and modern. Even the bathrooms were neat, although there's practically no light and the faucet is more for looks than for ease of use.

""Sweet latte art for people who like sweet coffee"". That's not sticking. Still. I got some kind of chocolate mocha latte (don't exactly remember) and a Macadamia Nut Paste Latte. They are pretty good with the foam art. Definitely looked pretty. The chocolate mocha latte was very good. I like my coffee sweet so it had the right amount. The Macadamia Nut Paste Latte is not something I could recommend though, unless you like chewing your coffee. The Nut Paste included chunks of Macadamia nuts in there. They absorbed none of the sweetness of the coffee. It was jarring to drink coffee and end with nuts in your mouth. That's on purpose. 

""Style over substance"" for the food. I'm not high on this farm-to-table / organic everythang trend, but that trend is thriving here. There's being fancy because you are trying something new and exploring new flavor combinations, and then there is doing it because it's trendy. 

I ordered Steak and Eggs and the Corned Beef Hash. Of course, the corned beef hash wasn't normal corned beef. It had some sort of orange sauce, I believe it might have been a coconut-chili sauce. My fiancee couldn't handle the sauce, said it was too oily. I could stomach it but agreed it was much too oily.  Knowing that corned beef has already been soaked in brine, it's weird to add MORE OIL to it. Plus, the amount of sauce was crazy. Looked like a curry bowl more than anything. They also don't give you a ton of corned beef for the price. 

Steak and eggs. This was so new on the menu it didn't include descriptors. Thought it was a pretty safe bet. Welp. The steak tasted off, like possibly gamey. Now, it could be because of something like the cow was fed with a diet that only consisted of mixed greens flown in from Monteplier France OR more likely that it was an older piece of meat. I've eaten plenty of clearance section meat from the store and it always has this particular brand of funky tang to it. 

The good thing though is that the eggs are, guess what, pretty good. And you know what, they should be good if they are organic, right? The toast is phenomenal. So the more breakfast aspects of the meal were great and the other parts, not so much.

This place is gorgeous, it's enough to venture to this place to check out the decor and the ambiance. If you do go, I would stick to breakfast staples. Eggs / Toast / Pastries / Coffee.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,4,2,3,9L1F_m9yFIU7aVu-p02Nqg

PublicUs (pronounced similarly to Spartacus) is an order-then-sit cafe located on Fremont St, but well off the hustle and bustle of the main part of downtown and with an ample parking lot in the back. They're open from morning until evening. We went here mainly for the coffee, and we also had some desserts, but we didn't sample anything savory today.

I had The Cannon ($4.50), which is iced coffee with lime, lime bitters, and house simple syrup. It sounded intriguing and tasted every bit as good as I'd hoped. It's very similar to a lemon-honey tea, but with coffee instead. I can see why they have a plaque for 1st place in the America's Best Coffeehouse Competition (specifically, 2015 Western Region Champions).

My friends shared some desserts with me, namely the warmed bread pudding ($6.00) and the ""Black Forest"" mousse ($?.??). The bread pudding was definitely among the better ones that I've had, with not too mushy a texture and nice spice. However, I would pick that chocolate mousse over the bread pudding any day. Although I didn't really detect the requisite cherry other than the one used as a garnish, the mousse itself was smooth, balanced in sweetness, and rich in chocolate. The cherry was perhaps an accent flavor at best.

It turned to be a very nice place to sit down and enjoy coffee with friends, and I would have been just as comfortable bringing a laptop as other folks did, or sitting down to eat something savory (although other reviewers suggest that those menu items may be less successful). I loved hearing the songs from bands such Interpol, Arcade Fire, and twenty one pilots. Definitely much more my vibe than the stereotypical coffee house music.

If nothing else, PublicUs is an excellent place for coffee and pastries, and I hope to be back soon to try more of their specialty coffee drinks.

[QUICK UPDATE 2/10/16: Stopped by intending to get coffee. Eventually decided on the Espresso Old-Fashioned ($5.00) to-go. Halfway through the drink, I finally had enough caffeine in my system to realize that the employee had described this as the one served with a huge ice sphere, which wouldn't have fit in the to-go cup and therefore was replaced with other ice. I don't think the effect was lost though, and I'd definitely order it again but not to-go. I felt like I was having a cocktail but with an espresso base.

I have tried their pastries, their ""inspired toasts,"" a handful of coffees, and three or four of the breakfast/brunch plates, and can say--almost without exception--that this is a next level, game-changing spot; not just for downtown, but for all of Vegas. Everything is made from scratch, on site, and whoever is in charge of the menus has some legit chops. This place is No Joke. 

I brought my family on my second trip, about a month or so ago, and our visit captured the brilliant highs and maddening lows of the place. My sister ordered the macadamia nut latte, and after one sip she fairly passed out with delight. I think she was almost angry, it was that good. We eventually asked one of the wait staff why in the hell it tasted so incredible and were told that the barista makes a paste/extract from actual macadamia nuts; a several hour long process that yields the most astonishingly true, pure flavor.  

This is the level of deep reverence the PublicUs gang bring to the table. You don't come here for a quick coffee fix. You won't even find the ubiquitous sugar/cream/cinnamon stand to doctor up your joe as you wish. If you want sugar or cream, you order it when you order your coffee, in precise amounts, which they enter into the system. We are talking about a very exacting operation here. Don't expect large quantities or refills. Don't expect things to be cheap, or familiar, or instantaneous. Do expect to be blown away. 

But also brace yourself for some weird hiccups. PublicUs is an elite machine, but one senses the dynamic between staff and customers rather like a novice trying to drive a Ferrari. Things can jolt and lurch in odd and unexpected ways. For instance, for some reason there are two ordering stations; one for coffee and one for food, but you can also order both at both. The first few times I ordered I found myself jumping back and forth between the two stations, not knowing who was taking which order or why. It is a terribly confusing and absurd system that needs rethinking. Also, when I've come with a group (twice now), all the orders have ended up on a single check which makes figuring out who pays for what a complicated mess. Plus there are two separate menus, one for food and one for coffee, again located at the different stations, so you end up lunging back and forth between the two ends of the counter. Plus, the coffee menu includes the names of drinks, like ""One and One"" or ""The Canon"" or ""The Engagement,"" which exist nowhere in the known universe except here and yet no descriptions are included. Perhaps the intent is to spark a dialogue between staff and customers, but in general I find the ordering process to be painfully and needlessly convoluted. 

The most vivid case of the extent to which Seriousness go can awry was when I brought my family, and myself and my Dad waited--I kid not--forty minutes for our pour-over coffees. Forty! By this point my Mom and Sister had finished their drinks, and we had all long-since finished our ""inspired toasts."" But serious coffee takes time, and the barista was backed up. Now, to be fair, the place was slammed on a Saturday morning, and apparently one of the barista's failed to show. But such are the perils of an establishment so deeply wedded to the integrity of the coffee-making process. Mom and Dad ended up stopping for an additional coffee at The Market on our way back from PublicUs. Ponder that: we went to PublicUs for coffee, and then ended up stopping for coffee on the way back from the place went to get coffee. 

In spite of these rather grating flaws, PublicUs gets four stars. The food is simply that amazing, and the coffee is just that impressive. The staff is uniformly pleasant and responsive, as well. A place that takes itself this serious skates a thin line between inviting and pretentious, but the good folks at PublicUs keep things real by being consistently warm and attentive and welcoming. You will pay, and you will wait, but pay and wait: this place is worth every hassle.",8D4jmSsMutGwnphZ1BktOg,4,1,4,L3aIB9iI-RiGsTrH27LNiw

Well, we never got our coffee. After nearly an hour, with our food long digested, nothing. Three inquiries with two staff members, nothing. After growing frustrated and requesting a refund for the coffees, we were told that Lane would take care of it. Nothing. No offer of the coffees while countless people enjoyed fresh, hot coffee around us. My partner goes up to counter and the manager was not only indifferent, he verged on rude and didn't seem knowledgeable enough on the POS to process our refund. Now we will have to spend the time pursuing a refund trough the credit card chargeback process. 

Apparently we must have just slipped through the cracks because the Yelp reviews are glowing. Regardless, as a former restaurateur, the hospitality was lacking. The brunette and blonde guys working the counter and floor were helpful but unable to convince the frazzled (and vicious - I would be scared to approach her too with an overlooked order) barista to process our order. She didn't have a ticket on the board. So we missed out on ""the best coffee in town"" and were made to feel like needy annoyances when simply trying to get two basic filtered coffees that we had paid for - and sadly tipped on in advance. 

All that being said, the food was good (albeit cold) and the design is beautiful, interesting and completely on-point. I've had my fair share of Yelp reviews related to ""hipster service"" and this is what diners mean: indifferent hospitality that's unable to graciously make up for mistakes through sincerity and a genuine desire to make things right. A note to Lane (apparently the GM according to LinkedIn): all you had to do was tell the barista to make our coffees to-go and you would have written the last chapter in our experience. At the very least, when unable to find our ticket for a refund, offer us two complimentary coffees on our next visit. With so many people around us enjoying their experiences, it's the least you could have done so that we could have enjoyed ours. Thanks for the memorable Valentine's Day brunch!

From the outside and surrounding areas, it doesn't look nice at all. It's near downtown. Being older is a given. But looks easily deceive you because the inside blew me away. Real trees growing inside. Weird and interesting decor. It reminds me of someplace I'd find in SF.

How it works - DIY. Stand in line. Order. Get a number. Grab a table. Get your own utensils. And most importantly (although people don't realize it), bus your own table! Sounds like a simple process, but you'd be surprised at how many people don't do it.

Everything on the menu looked good. It's one of those menus that make you want to order one of each because each dish is unique in its own way. Ultimately, my boyfriend and I decided on the loco moco and the eggs benedict.

Funny story. When it comes to mushrooms, it's a hit or miss with my allergies. Unfortunately for me, both dishes had mushrooms. Needless to say, I ate until I couldn't bare the itching anymore.

From what I could eat, I definitely enjoyed different parts of each dish, but not the whole thing. With the loco moco, I didn't like the gravy or the meat. Usually it's a burger patty of some sort that's flavorless, so you look forward to the gravy to bring the dish to life. To me, the gravy was way too salty. It just didn't wow me. The macaroni salad was good though. My eggs benedict were not poached. They were almost hard boiled. Weirdly enough, I liked all the vegetables in benedict. Brussel sprouts are always in win in my book. My friends love their potatoes, but maybe because I had burnt pieces, I put them aside.

The interior is very nice with large windows, and various table sizes including some communal ones. They also have outdoor seating but it's probably best to sit inside until the temperature drops. 

They have menus with their food and drink options at the end of the line as well as a glass divider that showcases baked goods and daily specials that aren't on the menu. 

This trip we ordered a macadamia latte (iced) and a one and one. I really enjoyed my iced latte, it's perfect on a hot day and not heavy at all. The cashier mentioned that it was made with a macadamia paste and so there would be some macadamia chunks in the drink but I didn't think they were very noticeable (though he mentioned some guests have sent the drink back due to the chunks). As for the one and one (double shot espresso, one pulled in a cup by itself and the other pulled into a single serving macchiato) it was prettily presented and a good way to taste both the espresso on its own but also with milk. My favorite drink however, is still the shaken almond milk latte while my boyfriend's favorite is the espresso old fashioned! 

As for food, we decided to just grab a cookie this time, I forgot the name but I think it was a cashew date chocolate chunk cookie (gluten free). I really liked how it wasn't too sweet and also the unique texture of this cookie- it was almost cakey in a way but still retaining that nice chew. We didn't get it this time, but I would really recommend getting anything with their smashed potatoes. Those things are fantastic! Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside with a nice punch of garlic! 

Service is always very friendly and makes you feel very welcomed! 

Overall a great place to catch up with friends, enjoy a nice drink/brunch, or just to stop by as you're waiting for your hotel check in time.",lQqnueRjCYPTnVxk3_b7Kw,0,0,5,V9nWZjYmi_PfLeLyILtGvQ

4424829,2015-07-20,8,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,"A new and promising establishment that I think given some more time will be a success. PublicUs exudes the spirit of downtown's gentrification located on the outskirts of Fremont St. The views of the surrounding area are dreary, but inside you can enjoy Bohemian charm as you lose count of the hipster populace adorning the tree highlighted school yard lunch tables. The clean atmosphere and helpful wait staff are a huge plus of PublicUs.
The food is a bit overpriced as what I've found to be the standard for these Downtown project restaurants. 

Forbidden fried rice is a creative blend of black rice, pork belly and fried egg; but I don't think it's worth the $13 price tag.
The Arugula Risotto is all vegan from what they described and it was ok. Again a bit overpriced for what you get.
The last visit, I got the side protein of ""Tiger Prawns"". They were not prawns but regular sized shrimp. Definitely not cool trying to dupe customers into paying $8 for 5 shrimps and calling them prawns.

I get it, the locally sourced ingredients movement should be the justification of higher prices, even with minimal preparation to maintain the whole ""freshness"" thing. If it seems healthy, you will pay more.

As a coffee house, the selections are ok and all drinks are hand crafted. But don't bother asking for sugar. They don't have regular sugar. I can almost hear the shrill voice of that annoying sugar Nazi mom scolding you in your head for even asking for it. They will gladly re-make your coffee with their special syrup if you want it sweeter. Unfortunately, it will taste the same and you may consider sneaking in the sugar contraband from your nearby Starbucks.

PublicUS is like modern art. You will have those that gush over paint splotches and give them immense meaning and value; and then there will be the rest who prefer a more thought out approach based on traditional talent and creativity. Either way, I think you will have fun and enjoy figuring out which one you are at PU.",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,11,8,3,bXeHcj7g7DlJLqhQyxrJQA

PublicUs has a very modern/LA vibe, with some real trees thrown in for good measure! I love the seating area, and the way the restaurant itself is set up. It reminds me of open-concept living/eating/kitchens in new homes.

I have been here twice, once for breakfast with a friend. We both decided to order the ""Bird's Nest"", which a lovely salad with a deep-fried panko crusted egg nestled on top of it, with crispy pieces of duck. It is a bit on the small side, so...

My friend and I also ordered, and split the Corned Beef Hash, which comes with a piece of crusty bread (we got two since we were sharing), and comes with a slightly-spicy Thai-type sauce which we ordered on the side. It was brilliant!

For desserts we split the BROOKIE, a cookie/brownie mash-up with amazing balsamic-toffee filling, yes you read that right. So go order this now. We also split the Black Forest Cake, which was on the small side for $6 bucks, but none the less an amazingly svelte dessert.

I was so tickled at my first time here I decided to stop by on my way to work around 7:15 AM this morning, as they open at 6 AM. I ordered the Shaken Almond Milk Latte, which was just indescribably good. It has a distinct flavor, and no oddly artificially sweetened flavor either. Just pure goodness.

Walking into PublicUs is like being transferred to a small oasis. The outside left more to be desired, but the inside is both eclectic and nurturing.

I've given their coffee three tries, but it always tastes sour. However, everything else is spectacular about this place! 

Let's begin with their food. I've only eaten here twice and had their chipotle chicken sandwich and waffles. The chicken sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! The chicken was nicely grilled and topped off with mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, and chipotle sauce. Also comes with chips and spinach. All for $7. For a place like this, I got a little more than expected. As for their waffles, they were pretty good and topped off with a variety of berries and whip cream. I ordered these a few months ago, so I only recall that they were really good. Their other food portions also look tempting and hope to try them out someday, but they are a bit pricey though. 

The decor here is awesome! I love the art they have on the walls, sculptures, plants, and toys they have around. They have a lot of unique and interesting things to look at. Their bathroom is actually my favorite bathroom to go to. I actually get excited to go just for their bathroom sometimes. They have a slide door, bonsai tree, faucet sink, and Dyson airblade. This place overall offers a hipster vibe and a calming/chill atmosphere despite how busy and loud this place can be at times. 

Lastly, their service is amazing!! The staff is really nice and go the extra mile to make you feel at home. The staff has always been welcoming and there to get to know you when the place might be a bit slow for a few minutes. Wish I got the name of one of the staff that was really helpful during my last visit. While I stated that I would go ahead and get my napkin and utensils after dropping off my meal, she went ahead and grabbed everything for me. She also was nice enough to fill up my water bottle when it was busy, which some places don't do. 

Overall, I love this place. I love coming here to study and sometimes grab some food. To me, the prices can be a bit pricey, but the quality is good and different than most places.

They have all of their baked goods, along with their current breakfast specials on display at the counter. The bread pudding immediately caught my eye as it frequently does. But I have to say we do it differently back home in the Midwest and I haven't found one here that I'm crazy about. However, I asked the woman working at the register if it was popular and if she could tell me about it. Apparently it's made from all their baked good scraps - pumpkin bread, coffee cake, muffins, etc. This sounded worth a try for sure! In the display I saw that it's served with a cream sauce drizzled on top. A drizzle isn't enough for my tastes, so I asked if I could get extra on the side. She was happy to oblige and there was no extra charge. 

I took my number and found a table for myself. Across from the counter is a station with utensils and napkins. And to the left of the counter are glasses for water and cream for your coffee. I grabbed what I needed and got comfortable. There are also high chairs available if you have a little one!

Less than ten minutes later my bread pudding arrived. It was two large triangle slices absolutely covered in strawberries, blueberries and blackberries. The extra side of the cream sauce wasn't very big, but it didn't end up mattering - it wasn't quite as sweet as I was hoping. The bread pudding was super moist and sweet, especially along the bottom - my favorite part! And it was fun and delicious to taste the mash-up of different flavors going on. I think there might have been a pumpkin loaf in there and something with raisins. 

While this still wasn't quite as amazing as I've had back home, it is the best I've found here so far. And I really appreciated the creativity. I guess us midwesterners are fatties, because I like my bread pudding absolutely swimming in a bowl of sweet sauce.

This was enjoyed before my meal which was the Pesto Egg Scramble. After taking a glimpse at the description I knew it was going to be amazing. It took a while to get but the service gal recognized and apologized. No biggy. After eating a few bites I thought I was missing meet. The description mentioned steak so I was hungry for meet. When I realized the meat was missing I took a look at menu and it said Farm Beefsteak Tomatoes. Really? I was hungry and thought/read with my stomach. And being the first item on the menu, for brunch, it made me resent my meal. Although green eggs are good, I would've enjoyed it more had I know been tricked! Lol all jokes aside. It was good but unclear(the menu) most people know tomatoes as color. The chunks of tomato were unimpressive and had no need to be included. You just have to pay attention to the description a bit more.

I was there for brunch so I ordered The Traditionalist which included eggs (of your choice), breakfast meat of your choice (I ordered the sausage), greens, toast, and these crispy red baby potatoes, which are absolutely delicious. It was just a right amount portion, and the price were great (average of $10), it is not expensive.

The place is aesthetically pleasing as well. I definitely bring a friend here, or maybe a friend that is visiting, because it is a very well decorated restaurant, that it clean and modern, but also you can tell is very personal. The owner knew what he was doing and had vision in mind, and put a lot of thought into not only the decor, but as well as it's drinks, and menu.

I particularly enjoy visiting and trying-out coffee shops, but usually, I go there when I have already eaten. Reason being is, that most coffee shops focus on their drinks (which is perfectly fine) and they only serve a few food items which are mostly pastries, or small snacks and sandwiches. PublicUs, however, serves real food that is prepared everyday, and you also can have your coffee house feel with it, too. It's a great place to spend the afternoon as you get lost around downtown or even a place to study.

I will be regular for this place. I hope they continue to be a very personal, cozy spot to drink coffee and tea, and may they continue to take pride in their food and drinks. It is what makes the place special.",Yxtso_x5WiCqb71j9hNaEA,0,0,5,aaMb259s0Ca1RWOZ2ub2Lw

Located in Fremont east district.

Food is 5/5. Healthy, lightly seasoned food provides a sense of no regrets when eating anything they make. I would say they lean towards letting you choose the salt and pepper to taste at your discretion vs overpowering from the kitchen: nice change. 

We tried many dishes but my favorite was the pork pozole. Full of flavor and tender pork. The tostadas were a great addition. 

I also liked the espresso ""old fashioned"". Not for everyone, but interesting double shot with cherry, and orange. 

My group also liked their ice shaken almond milk latte.

The only thing I didn't care for was the loco moco. Mainly that it didn't really stand out to me as memorable vs. the many good loco moco options I've had in LV and LA.

Don't let the grimy location east on Fremont fool ya, this place packs a hip punch once you step inside. Open interior, eclectic decor, communal tables. It's a clean space that is centered by the fresh baked pastries and kitchen.

Speaking of that kitchen: it's pumping out some serious eats. Pastries baked on-site daily, with breakfast specials and a regular menu to pick off of. Coffee is serious business here, and they have an assortment to choose from prepared in a variety of manners. The names are a little unorthodox, so you'll probably have to have a staff member translate (which they gladly will do).

My favorite feature is the picnic tables and faux trees in their centers making you feel like you're outdoors. This plays a large part in a great vibe of the place. It's comfortable while chic.

I've had coffee on two occasions here and both times, I had the Macadamia Nut Paste Latte. It is truly one of the best lattes I've ever had with the most beautiful latte art. Wonderful flavor with unmistakable nuttiness and a smooth espresso. Strangely, I didn't have the same experience during my second cup as it seemed to be less sweet and flavorful, but still enjoyable.

I was apprehensive about trying their food after reading reviews, but I'm very glad I did - fabulous! I came for brunch on the weekend, so there was the Brunch Menu and the same great offerings of their ""Kitchen Table"" (available all day and changes frequently). 

Corned Beef Hash ($13): Spam, cherry tomato, fried egg, coconut chile sauce. This was a wonderful dish that I'd absolutely order again! The corned beef and potatoes were great and I loved the addition of spam and tomatoes. The coconut chile sauce is such an interesting twist on a traditional corned beef hash and was fantastic!

Forbidden Rice ($12): Fried black rice, spam, assorted farm vegetables, pickled ginger, yakitori sauce, fried egg. Another fabulous brunch option of a classic dish with a twist. The fried rice feels elevated with the black rice and the flavors are familiar, yet exciting. Another dish I'd eat again.

Smoked Salmon Toast ($5.50): Spicy feta cheese spread, boiled egg, and cilantro chimichurri. I didn't like this toast as much as I thought I would since I love smoked salmon (and bread). The flavors weren't harmonious and the other components managed to eclipse the salmon.

Kitchen Table
Fennel Mac and Cheese: Beautiful presentation and a welcomed update of an oldie. The fennel was subtle as was the mac and cheese and I loved the Parmesan sauce!
Bacon/Brie/Tomato Toast: Really delicious. The bacon is flavorful and crispy. All of the ingredients work well together. The bread is seriously amazing, though it was a bit tough to work through on this toast.
Bostock: So, this thing must be totally made up, but whoever made it up is a genius. It's toast with almond paste and chopped hazelnuts. It's really as good as it sounds (it's amazing). 

They also have an amazing dessert case. I tried the Pineapple Carrot Cake and Coconut Tres Leches. The carrot cake was just okay, however, the tres leches was out-of-this-world delicious! Soo good as a tres leches and then they added one of my favorite things ever, coconut!

Another wonderful perk: FREE parking in the lot next to PublicUs!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,8,8,4,YggNj5gnUT85dMCoOjTVPw

Now what doesn't work: there are live trees in the middle of tables that hang down so low you can't see the person across from you. The tables, while aesthetically appropriate, have an uneven surface, making it difficult to balance plates and cups without spilling. They have no sugar-ok this is personal preface but it's bothersome at a coffee place. Instead, they offer caramelized simple syrup and then ""educate"" you on how it's the same thing-but it's not. Caramelized sugar tastes different than white sugar. Your only other option is stevia. Unfortunately their coffee isn't good enough to stand on its own unsweetened. Pick your poison.

When the server asked me about it, he was fairly argumentative about the fact that this was what I had ordered. When given the option to have what I had actually ordered made, I was told I would have to wait, like it was my fault they can't pay better attention when engaging with their guests.

I love the fact that they have actual coffee and a wide variety of it. They have their own signature coffee cocktails as well as a kick ass espresso. One of my favorite things to order is called the One and One. It gives you the best of both worlds in my opinion. Public Us serves you one shot of espresso in a sniffer glass (like when you have whiskey) this is so you can get the full aroma of the espresso before you taste it. Also, having it on It's own and then mixed with a little cream in a cappuccino gives you a wonderful flavor experience. One of their signature coffee cocktails that I enjoy is the Old Fashion. They muddle cherries in coffee and serve it with a sphere of ice. I definitely recommend it especially if you enjoy the real version of an Old Fashion. 

I love that they offer a ""farm to table"" menu as well as a standard menu. Plus, on the weekends they offer a set brunch menu. On my most recent visit I tried their meat and veggie frittata. Wow! The eggs were super moist, the veggies were fresh and full of flavor, and the bacon and chicken sausage were not greasy and complimented the veggies perfectly. Not to mention the slice of the frittata was humongous!! Their Fennel  Mac & Cheese is amazing  and so unique!

To drink I got the lemon lime green ice tea which was definitely more on the citrus than the tea flavor so think of it more like a lemonade that has tea than tea with some lemon flavoring. It was refreshing though and I liked it.

We shared - 

Fried chicken with kimchee and rice- The chicken had a nice, not too heavy, but crunchy batter and I enjoyed the sweet/spicy dressing on it and house pickles. 

The standout for me was a ""kitchen table"" side though, the cauliflower slaw which was in a creamy curry dressing with celery and cranberries. It had just enough curry flavor balanced out with a bit of acidity and mayo in the dressing. 

We also got a sausage in a pastry puff. The flavor of the sausage was pleasant though the rougher grind on the meat made some pieces a bit chewier and tougher. The pastry dough on it was solid, as well as the stone ground mustard with it. 

I thought the brookie (cookie brownie) has a nice play with some balsamic in the caramel. I would have liked more play on the chewy brownie part as it was more on the crunchy cookie side than soft. 

It's counter service and you get a number for your table, but everyone was pretty nice. A guy came over to talk to us about the menu and answered all our questions and gave some recommendations. There was a girl who came to check on us while we were eating and brought us water and refills. Most counter places don't check in, so this was appreciated. 

I think it's a interesting place doing some dishes that are creative and a more than ""standard"" coffee/beverage menu worth a visit.

Although this is a great place to get work done, I do agree with the other Yelp reviews that this place needs more electrical outlets for those who want to stay longer to study and get work done. Because it's so crowded and not too many tables have access to the outlets, it was difficult to find an open table near one. Most of the electrical outlets were either located by the windows on high tables in the front or in the back corner against the wall near the restrooms. Keep in mind that the larger tables by the front have no access to the electrical outlets at all.

Not that there's anything wrong with TCOB'ing in a cool cafe with flavored coffee drinks. You gotta do you.

I like PublicUs because it highlights everything cool about Las Vegas that one doesn't expect. The downtown location with parking is just the tip of the iceberg. An artsy, but low key vibe sets the mood. Really, really nice people behind the counter. Healthy food options. Plenty of seating. Clean bathrooms. There's even the occasional Las Vegas celebrity sighting.

This place is cute, ""hipster-y"", but with a lot of thought put into it - like the creative water station. Anyway, it's one of those places where you take a menu, look at their baked goods and other foods behind a glass, order, get a number, sit down, and get served.

We ordered too many things: coffee (legit), chocolate croissant and loco loco for jack, corned beef hash and salmon toast for me. The corned beef hash was super good. I'm a sucker for coconut, so diced potatoes, grape/cherry/small tomatoes, diced spam, corned beef swimming in a coconut sriracha sauce topped with a fried egg was mind-blowing. It's like an interesting asian twist to corned beef hash. From the food to the numerous but subtle lucky cat decor, there must be some sort of Asian influence to this place.

5120214,2016-07-12,3,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     19/100
I was intrigued by this place. It was the lure of breakfast photos and reviews posted by fellow elites. Randomly decided to come here and was excited to try the toasts that Michael K. wrote about in his review. I was so looking forward to trying this, I didn't care to look at any other items on the menu. When I got there, I was a bit disappointed to find out that the toasts and breakfast items are only served till 11am. I got there around 2:30pm, so close yet so far. I hope the demand for these will be greater so they will consider serving them all day. 

Location: it's in an area of DTLV that's away from the newer ""hip"" spots in Downtown, so the area is not as clean. There were bums camped out right outside the restaurant. It was surprising but they didn't bother us. Don't be scared, they don't bite. There is also a free parking lot and ample parking spaces. 

I didn't know what to expect when I walked in, and I was excited to see that the decor is creative, inviting and looked like a restaurant you would find in larger cities like LA or NYC. You'll also notice dinosaurs posted in random places inside the restaurant. The dining situation is community style and tables with trees growing out of them, which creates a welcoming environment. A great way to meet new people. When we got there it was busy but not crowded. 

As soon as you walk in, if you don't know what to get grab a menu and check out what they got behind the window (the daily specials that are not on the menu.) 

Today, they had a variety of quiche and Brussels sprouts on display window. 

The guy that helped me was great and friendly and asked if I had any questions. 

What left me a little disappointed was the fact that it took a while for us to get our food. 10 people who ordered after us got their food before us. I hope the long wait was because of the ingredients and what we ordered. We ordered The Cuban Sandwich. It wasn't till I got up and asked (about 20 mins of waiting) if our food will be ready soon. The lady I spoke with said it would be out next. I wish she had also said or gave me a reason why it was taking so long and apologized for it. No big deal but their customer service could use some work (great customer service generates more business :-) ) I've been on all ends of customer service and worked in almost every type of customer service for the past 16 years. So I know what I'm talking about and I know great customer service when I see it. 

The Cuban Sandwich tasted good. It was flavorful and tasty but I think they could have added more meat to it for that price. Edit: After looking through the other photos of this sandwich, there was a fair amount of meat in our sandwich. I enjoyed the combination of flavors. It came with a side of chips and a mixed greens salad. 

I will be back again to try the toasts, breakfast and other delicious items. I'm hoping my food experience will be better next time.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,6,5,4,pkTNT2R-bJrVoCJXBbC8rw

With its setup in the front, it appeared that I had to wait to be seated but I was wrong. You can sit anywhere anytime. A person asked if it was my first time there, and explained to me that you pick up a menu and go to the cashier to order. He then explained it to another family coming in.

I ordered the salmon toast which was very filling and delicious for around $8. The line lemon green tea was a little sour and fresh, I enjoyed it very much.

Parking: private lot and street parking available. 

Ambience: very cool vibe, almost LA like in its hipsterness level. It was packed the entire time we were there so it's very popular. The soaps in the bathroom smell amazing and I think also available for sale. The staff seems cool, friendly and attentive for the most part. 

Food: the menu looks amazing, drool worthy actually. In reality, all of our meals were misses. I got the loco moko and while the sauce and the macaroni salad were delicious, my beef patty was still mooing and just plain gross served with white rice. They should mention that it's cooked well below medium on the menu. Our other plates were served with items missing or the flavors just not melding together. Maybe the kitchen didn't have it together that day (New Years) but everything seemed to be off its game. The cashew lattes were great though! Props to the team handling preparing the drinks, they really came through for us. 

We barely ate our meals, and when the server came by she asked us how it was and none of us answered. She didn't bother to ask anything further which was disappointing. I mean you see a table of 5 all telling you to take away half eaten plates one should feel compelled to ask what was wrong?

5169970,2015-03-21,3,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,"Undecided.

New - yes...and very excited because I live right around the corner. 

Decor- very modern. Rustic/industrial - and there's a map of the world on the wall.

Atmosphere: open kitchen. You can watch the baristas and cooks prepare food and drink, but I also observed servers standing in groups chatting and groups of staff huddled, or staff members who looked lost like they didn't know what to do next. 

There are two entrances, and no greeters. Its obviously a seat yourself free for all - multi level seating (watch your step in some places). I'm concerned this will be a problem if/when this place gets busy. 

Staff: quirky with a steampunk hipster feel. Leather industrial looking aprons, and tons of hats (lots of bowler hats). 

I had some issues- not being greeted, brought a drink with no straw, was nicely offered random water while I waited but when I told the server I already had a drink, he didn't understand that as meaning no thank you and proceeded to argue with me about whether or not me already having a drink necessitated needing water as well. 

Food: totally awesome. I got the eggs Benedict. Yum. Eggs were perfect. The sauce was to die for. The potatoes were super good and had really delicious onion chunks. I got a muffin that was soft and cakey with an uber crispy top. 

Coffee: I kinda wish I was sold something more satisfying. I told the woman I loved iced coffee and she said she was a huge Starbucks iced coffee drinker. She said the iced coffee at PublicUs was really light and recommend light cream and sugar which I went with. But I was kinda sad because the girls at the next table got something more caramel/creamy looking - along the lines of what I probably would have preferred. 

Overall: I'll be going back. This place is in my hood and there was one server with a twisty gray epic beard who was super friendly. The food was also very satisfying. I'll chalk my initial experience to growing pains and hopefully the management here is reading our reviews and taking the criticism constructively.",iB70u8O5teQ_pNio0vAjpQ,5,0,3,VOUnQYcTpgEzMOD0AbuO-w

While the counter service was fine, for the price we paid for 3 breakfasts ( $ 61.00 w/tip) you'd think we would have a full glass of iced tea with no ice. They brought a half glass and were very justified with it when asked. Also they control the the amount of sweetener if any you get. Come on, were not children. 

The cost of the food is high enough to allow US that are paying for it to have a full glass of tea and the amount and kind of sweetener we want. Iced Tea is not a speciality drink that need to have someone with a degree to make. 

Will have to think about going back. Shame to lose money on something so simple but looks like they lost ours. Also the food wasn't consistent with the time before. Guess we're spoiled in Vegas.

The manager/owner was by far the worst of all.

A complete disconnect between the customer experience and the roles the staff was playing. No teamwork. No communication. No follow through. Adding insult to injury, you are expected to tip the staff prior to receiving your meal.

My partner and I decided to order a few things and split them.  We started with a ham and cheese croissant, which was just that.  The croissant was dry and uber-flaky - it definitely needed some sort of spread to moisten it up.  I did enjoy how the ham was crisped on the edges, but the sandwich wasn't warmed enough.  The middle was cold, and the cheese was hardly melted.  The waffles were tasty and abundant, and the veggie frittata was my favorite - eggs fluffy,with a great, fresh vegetable mix, and the crust was moist and flaky (in the good way).  The portions are large and in charge.  I also had to get the macadamia nut latte again.  I really wish it came in larger sizes - it's really my new favorite latte. One thing worth noting is that when I noticed that their silverware bar was out of knives, they were quick to respond and replenish the missing utensils with a smile.

I'm not too sure if the straw is suppose to be this trendy thing they're trying, but it completely alters the taste in the coffee in such a bad way.

Still in a 'soft opening' phase, and located on the far end of ever gentrifying East Fremont, it was admittedly with baited breath that I'd watched PublicUS tumblr site ever since the restaurant was announced and as pictures and reviews began to spring up thanks to good words from John Curtas an early morning visit was planned, a quick message sent to Pastry Chef Hemant Kishore seeing the young Chef sit with me throughout my hour-long stay discussing things from the local food scene to his Southern Indian heritage, CIA Training, and inspiration behind each baked good.

Expansive in size, bathed in sunlight, and specked with handmade seating alongside live plants, it was just prior to 7am that I entered publicUS and finding Hemant just having laid out the daily bread while a few older men sipped coffee it was with wide eyes that I looked upon the somewhat limited offerings, and although the five pastries behind glass would inevitably end up part of the order my interest was even further piqued by a large breakfast menu - three more made-to-order options delivered to the table by still-green service shortly after a cup of rich single origin pour-over.

Speaking to Hemant as I tucked in, it was logically with warm items that the tasting began, and with the croissant shell shattering after slight flex a vast cavern of buttery aromatics poured forth, the use of quality European product obvious to anyone familiar while the light vanilla sugar glaze tickled the tongue without overwhelming one bit.

Next delivered the French Toast, a textbook Brioche that may be the menu's best bargain at $6 for two thick slices, those interested in custard-centered iterations of the dish will be happy to know the PublicUS kitchen is making one of Sin City's best while the caramelized bananas used both here and in the cardamom heavy banana bread showed great depth of flavor, particularly when drenched by a pot of boozy maple syrup.

Impressed by a scone that would likely confuse a proper Englishman while wowing most American palates with an interior softened by cream cheese it was next to the muffin that my tasting turned, and with an almost pudding-soft interior beneath a lightly browned top the bakery's best item was found, each bursting berry adding vibrant levity to all the butter, though a 'light' breakfast this stump-less round most certainly is not.

Underwhelmed by the $5.50 'toasts,' first off by how thin the housemade sourdough was sliced when considering the fact that a whole loaf can be had for $6, and then by the fact that they took nearly twenty minutes to make and still arrived cold, suffice it to say that PublicUS has a good idea going with the texturally compelling ""Beignet"" while the pears and almond butter were unfortunately lost amidst the sweet-savory goat cheese crusted grapes of ""Pear,"" the final bites of 'brookie' proving a far better investment as the brownie textured sandwich was delicate yet intense, the vinegar tinged toffee center something I'd gladly have jarred to drizzle on ice cream, or to spread on a more substantial piece of the sourdough bread.

Still finding their footing, but clearly a place with big plans plus a team seemingly ready and willing to do things right, PublicUS is a welcome addition to a city long-marred by a lack of innovative artisan baking.  Open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner with an immense parking lot directly next door it will be interesting to see how things develop over the coming months, though I doubt it will take me that long to return considering the bread pudding offered as lunch and dinner dessert.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,8,4,Cez1tmXzFdV4FoJyYrruHg

Came here after reading about it on the Bon Appetit City Guide for Las Vegas (BA's city guides have not failed me yet). I brought my laptop with me to get some work done since I'm in town for a conference. Great place to hang out, grab (quality, fresh-roasted) coffee, get work done and chill without feeling like I'm being rushed out. 

Got here at about 10AM on a Monday morning. A pretty solid crowd already here, but plenty of space to grab seats (communal tables and bars ftw.) I ordered a Smashed Avo Toast ($8.50) and almond milk latte ($4.75 for 12oz drink) and then grabbed a seat while waiting for my order.

The almond milk latte came out in about 7 minutes, with the avocado toast about another 5-6 minutes later. I was pleasantly surprised to see the avocado toast came with a small side salad and a poached egg on top! It was everything that avocado toast should be (especially if I'm paying almost 9 bucks for it): hearty sourdough bread that didn't get soggy during the meal; a generous serving of simple, but perfect avocado, and tomato on top. Apparently the almond milk is made in-house, and so the latte itself was pretty perfect. I frequent a lot of coffee shops and was really happy to find great, quality coffee while visiting Vegas from out of town.

If you're here for lunch and looking for something that is both healthy and filling, I highly recommend the Forbidden Black Rice Bowl ($12). I ended up staying through lunch time to finish my work, and after ordering this I couldn't believe a veggie & grain bowl could be this flavorful and filling (I couldn't even finish it). Loaded with a mix of fresh, grilled and picked veggies like asparagus, carrots, pickled onions, cherry tomatoes and fresh herbs... again, simple ingredients but impressive flavor. I'd totally order it again if I could.

Really loved the vibe here, and the free wi-fi is definitely a huge plus. Great customer service too, I was checked on a couple times (in a non-annoying way) and the staff was super friendly.

    There are few spots, if any, like Publicus in the Las Vegas/Henderson area. I'll start with the entrees and work my way back from there.
    We tried 6 or 7 dishes and nothing disappointed. The standouts were 'soppressata,' 'the skillet' and the 'salmon toast.' The menu items are some the freshest and newest creations I've seen at any eatery nationwide. Such avant-garde with dish creation was surprising. What was more surprising was that every item delivered 110%. The flavor combinations were superb. The coffee is brewed by one of the top baristas in the country. I ordered an 'Old Fashioned' which came in a proper whiskey glass with a ball of ice and was made tat for tat like an old fashioned; muddled orange and all but with expresso instead of whiskey. I'd never experienced such a creative coffee drink.  
    We didn't have room after the main meal but we ordered dessert anyway. They have this too by the way; a full on pastry department! The rum battered cookies were amazing.

There is more to Vegas than the Strip, and this is the more I was looking for. PublicUs is in an arts district sort of near Old Vegas (I think? I got a little turned around). At first, it looked like we were in the wrong place. Everything was kind of industrial or shut down, old motels fenced off and peeling paint. Our Lyft driver didn't want to drop us off here because he thought it was a shady, high crime area, but I think he was being kind of classist. Plus, it was broad daylight and already 113 degrees at 11 AM. Too hot for crime. 

PublicUs is a healthy hipster oasis in the desert! It's so much more than a coffee shop -- you can order a variety of fascinating, delicious food options from the case (or off the menu) as well as drinks. I had a salmon toast that was brimming with veggies and cream cheese. The salmon was smoky and fresh and so, so good. All of my friends were blown away by their meals, too! We also had to share a bread pudding, which was possibly the weakest part of the meal, and still I find myself craving it.

I ordered the Garden Farm Benedict and it was definitely not a disappointment. I wish they did have regular ketchup, but had to settle for chipotle flavored. The food was so amazing it put me into a food coma afterwards. Their portion size is just right, filling & definitely worth it!

I got the Old Fashioned to drink, and soppressata to eat and they were both excellent!! Soppressata was two medium eggs, toast, and cream sauce (tasted like a bechamel sauce) with some kind of meat (tasted like bacon but soppressata means salami so maybe it was that). So delicious! Came with a generous portions of sliced fingerling potatoes, and mesclun salad. If it wasn't barbaric, I would've licked my plate clean of the bechamel like cream sauce... Instead I tried to salvage all the sauce by dipping my potatoes in it. Old fashioned was cold espresso with orange. I love that it was served over an ice ball in a whiskey glass. I wish I could request all my iced coffee to be served over an ice ball, it's so pretty! 

When I walked in, a couple of employees greeted me and walked me through how publicus works. Lots of awesome coffee options (it was described to me as cocktail coffees, which is perfect), pastries, and food options (they still had their breakfast items available when I visited at 2:30PM, yay!) 

The vibe& atmosphere in publicus is great! Very clean and modern. Lots of natural lightning (wrap around windows) which make reading/working there a breeze, and lots of seating options (most on the main floor area, some picnic like tables near the Windows, some more hidden near the back walls/bathrooms, etc). People there were a mixture of those eating/socializing , & studying/working, etc.

When it arrived at the table, my husband was a little jealous he did not order the dish.  However, when he tasted it, he was okay that he had ordered the brekkie sandwich instead.  I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and it was underwhelming.  The chicken, the fried batter coating, all was flavorless.  It had this spicy sauce that had just that spice, no other detectable seasoning :(.  Even the pickles were not really that pickled.  It was closer to just a slice of cucumber.  The chicken was moist but it needed salt, and any other seasoning to wake up the dish.  My husband enjoyed his sandwich but not that special, given it was Portuguese sausage and egg.  We ordered a chocolate croissant which was the tastier part of my breakfast.  My husband also enjoyed the flavor of his dark chocolate mocha.

The sweet potato salad, or as I call it ""mouthfuls of autumn"", was delicious.  Their red snapper was the best piece of cooked fish I'd had in recent memory.  And their vanilla meringue pie, which was apparently a one time thing as they change their desserts daily, was a nice ending.               

3 stars?

- I hate being picky over stuff like this.  While the seared ahi tuna entrée was very tasty, we only got 4 pieces of it.  Every other picture shows 6-7 pieces.  Tazeen A's photo looked like she got the whole damn fish. 

- White wine served at room temperature.    

- The fact they ask how much I want to tip after ordering everything at the cashier.  Yeah, it was a pleasant couple of minutes interacting with the staff while picking what to order, but I shouldn't be obligated to tip a minimum of 18% based on that.  I'll tip when I am ready to leave.  Would they consider a wait staff for dinner?

I met up with my pal for breakfast on Friday morning at 8:00am and scored a parking spot right in front, just like you see in the movies, but hardly ever happens in real life!
This place is bigger than I expected, very modern, with woody, organic tones.  
A nice man with an impressively braided long beard took my order.  
I had the Ice Shaken Almond Latte and the Steel Cut Oats and my friend had an omelet, but I'm not sure which one.  Mr. Beard explained to us that, in addition to chicken eggs, they also offer duck and goose eggs, in case you're looking for those.
We were given a number to place on our table and our lattes arrived not too long after, followed by our food.  Service was friendly and we were checked on by Mr. Beard as well as another staff member more than once.  I enjoyed my drink and oatmeal, which was served with a side of almond milk at my request.

So, we wrangle the kids, take potty breaks, and share the cookie. 
Before we know it, an hour has passed and we realize that everyone around us has come in way after we ordered and is already eating. Husband asks a passing server about our coffees and the barista has no idea what he's talking about.

Meltdown mode means husband has to take one of the boys outside while I wait inside 10
minutes for... oh, the server brings a small hot americano and a cappuccino with a couple of pastries on the house. He was apologetic and nice and all but it was so disappointing. I didn't really have time or the patience to wait even longer to get the actual order we paid ~$12 for. Ugh.

Second: They don't have Splenda. I get it...you're a cool hipster coffee shop in SoDoSoPa and Splenda is for the corporate Starbucks machine and its minions, maaaannnnn. Don't care. Same deal as with the coffee doctoring station...let the customer decide instead of limiting options.

I come here once a week or so, but it'd probably be 3+ times if these two issues weren't present. Sometimes I don't feel like the hassle of bringing my own Splenda, etc.

ATMOSPHERE
The decor is definitely what makes PublicUs so instagram-worthy. Sleek and clean bar with wooden picnic tables with trees right in the middle. There's also wifi and they never rush you to leave.

DRINKS & FOOD
Arguably one of the best cappuccinos in Vegas. The espresso has a nice body, neither sour nor bitter. Temperature and foam of the milk is decent as well. 

Their pour over is alright but nothing special. In general, both their drinks and food are slightly overpriced for what you get. For example, the chorizo skillet was basic and small but costs much more than what you would pay elsewhere. There was also an overabundance of oil.

The place wasn't too busy, but I ordered a cappuccino and ended up waiting over 15 minutes for it to be ready (according to my printed receipt, which had the time it was printed after payment). The others at my table had their drinks without waiting half as long;  even the guy that walked in 5 min after I placed my order got his hot drink before I did. 

After noticing that, I walked up to the counter to ask about the status of my order, but the staff pointed to the espresso machine area and said my drink was still being made. They seemed annoyed that I even inquired about my order even though it was past the 15 minute mark for a normal cappuccino and someone who ordered after me already had their beverage in hand. Apparently I don't understand the strenuous process of creating a PublicUs cappuccino, but there was only one barista making drink orders, so I figured they would make them in the order they come through. I finally got the drink and it was tasty, but that exchange left me feeling bothered. 

Against my better judgment, I decided to order lunch here today around 1:30pm. It was pretty packed, but I knew where to find the menus and waited in what looked like a line that ran parallel to the display counter. In an attempt by the establishment to be efficient, a bespectacled Asian female staff member was taking line orders with the iPad, but she never acknowledged or greeted me. In fact, she skipped me when it was my turn to order. I knew she saw me because we made eye contact after she took the order of the party in front of me.

I was next in line, but after she returned from the kitchen,  she started taking the orders of the party behind me. I was pretty upset at that point, but then she skipped me a second time! After patiently waiting for her to finish taking the second party's order, I asked her if it was my turn to order before she could walk off again; she hardly turned to face me and curtly said hold on a sec and went behind the counter. Many seconds, or rather minutes later, she returned to the front and start bussing tables instead. Priorities I guess. She was so helpful and courteous to other patrons, but ignored me. Is it because I'm a square wearing a suit and tie? 

She never came back to take my order, so I had to explain to the register staff why I didn't have an order number in their system to pay for. Even more frustrating is that other people, who were still trying to parallel park their benz while I was walking through the entrance, already had their orders in the system and their preparation underway by the kitchen. After finally making my order, I had to wait 30+ minutes for a cold turkey sandwich. In hindsight, it was a mistake to come here while I was on a work lunch break to get a to-go meal. 

The only decent staff member I encountered, the one at the register, hand delivered my food order and apologized for what happened on behalf of his co-worker; I asked to speak to a supervisor, but he said he would be talking to the GM because of issues they've had with taking orders. The phrase good judgment was mentioned by him to describe their intentions, but inept indifference is the first thing that comes to mind about both negative experiences.",jK5IzbH2qQNKmxjkk5C7pw,4,0,1,oKo8L4mMHGCiMKhQf_fx-A

We sat down and waited for our food and the employee comes up to us and tells us theres no spinach! The food is a cool 7/10. But the service! Yikes! The employee checked up on us once and I asked if they had refills for orange juice he said ""I think so, let me go double check"", he literally left for 10 minutes and then later came back saying they don't offer refills for orange juice. Okay, the least he could've done was offer some water or something but instead he walked away! Never going back there again!

I've been to a place back in Minneapolis that does this, and the trouble is that they apparently found that bitters and other flavored items are EXPENSIVE, so their ""cocktails"" are barely flavored.

Two poached eggs, one with runny yolk the other completely set. In order to give a rustic feel to a dish they seem to have forgotten one of the basic rules of cutting vegetables to be cooked, consistency in size.

Went on Sunday 2-28-16 at about 10 am for breakfast.  This restaurant is located on Fremont between 11th and Maryland.  After you enter you head to the counter to order and if there's a line it will form to the right of the cash register.  Menus are located on the counter to the very far right.  

The decor of the place is awesome...it's like what I imagine IKEA would sell in the year 2050.  They have some amazing light fixtures unlike anything I've ever seen before.  The seating indoors is ridiculously impractical....they have picnic tables with trees shooting up the middle, tiny tables made for hipster midgets, and my personal favorite, the one we sat at, was literally a log split down the middle for the table and the bench.  It's a very cute idea in theory but not comfortable or functional.  They do have high chairs for the kiddos.  

$31.99 got us a berry pastry, a traditionalist breakfast, two filter coffees, and a spinach benny.  
The coffee came first and was very strong and bitter...and not in a pleasant way.  I like Starbucks because it is strong but this was just too much and had a strange aftertaste like dirt mixed with cinnamon.  Perhaps my taste buds are not refined enough for this sort of coffee.  They don't have any cream or sugar out that you can self-service with so you have to go to the counter and beg for more.  Four creams and four sugars barely made a dent in this stuff.  It's like rocket fuel.  

The traditionalist breakfast consisted of two small pieces of toast, salad, boiled potatoes, eggs, and bacon.  The bacon was large but had an odd smoky flavor which I couldn't put my finger on and was cooked well but still very soft and chewy.  The potatoes were truly awful and one of the worst breakfast foods I've ever been served.  Perhaps if I were a prisoner in a concentration camp these would be enjoyable.  The eggs were still very runny inside.  

The spinach benny was too expensive for how tiny it was and came with no sides.  One of the eggs was cooked all the way and the other one was runny.  Not a good value for the money. 

Overall it was pretty expensive, took about 30 minutes to get the food, and the food was very meh.  I definitely recommend coming here at least once but it's a ""one and done"" for me.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,15,14,3,juXU89dQrLlpcnq1O9KSQg

I started with an old fashioned coffee and fresh muffin. My main entree included veggie eggs Benny, which was absolutely amazing. The eggs Benny had fresh veggies, crispy potatoes, two poached eggs over cream spinach and two slices of homemade bread.

No one checked on us. It was not that busy. Ultimately it roughly 55 minutes to get our lunch. The manager who spoke with us was very nice and made the problem right, but this is an inexcusable mistake. 

Food wise, I wasn't a fan of the Cuban. It lacks the typical savory flavor found in most traditional Cuban sandwiches. The green tea was very good. 

In sum, I may come back to Public Us for coffee. Maybe. The unfortunate thing is I wanted to like this place, mix it into my weekly lunch, and maybe have meetings here. But due to time sensitivity, I cannot rely on them.

There is plenty of street parking surrounding the building. No matter what time of day I stop in, I have yet to park anywhere but right in front. There is also a side lot that you can park in as well.

The decor is cool in the most literal sense. The A/C is on and the vibe is chill. Trees grow out of community tables, there are shared low and high top tables. It feels like home, but classier and with better taste.

In case you're confused when you walk in, there is usually someone to guide you to the menu and walk you through how everything works. In case you're depending on me for this, the menus are found to the far right of the counter and you'll order from the register. They give you a number and bring you all your treats. Silverware if found just behind the register and water/cups are to the left tucked into a rock bed. So clever.

I've dabbled into their pastry selection having the Chocolate Croissant and Blueberry Cream Cheese Scone. I haven't been super impressed yet, but I have my eye on the Bread Pudding next. The Avocado Toast is simple, the Brekkie Burrito is hearty and full of bold flavors, the Eggs Benedict was colorful and the Browned Butter Hollandaise was mouthwatering. The breakfast potatoes?

I want to go back and try more things! They greeted us as we left. Had awesome attitudes. You could tell this place was poppin'. I'm so glad to have tried this out! Will definitely be going back time to time to keep trying new things!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,5,3,5,g8t2L8na9zdg23Lu3oriiQ
5921132,2017-10-30,0,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,I read several reviews before trying this place. I love the atmosphere. The craft of making the coffee was really enjoyable. I am a big coffee fan so this place spoke to me. The seating benches were comfortable and creative. We had a ficus tree growing out of them middle of our table. We went around 9 am one morning and it wasn't busy but it took a while for or food to arrive. I had avocado toast and my husband had...I don't even remember. Food was pretty good. My husbands potatoes were cold and the rest of is food barely warm. The kitchen is open so we could see them making it. No reason anything should have been cold with as few people that were there and with as many staff as they had. The real star was the pastry. We had an apple danish with was really and apple cinnamon roll and it was the best part of the experience.  I would try this place again for the pastry and coffee selection. I would skip the meal. Ambiance was fantastic.,FfbI9vkkQWBOZfww6_nuOQ,0,0,4,IMBQO3FoyAjbbjsHh2SpLg
5924244,2018-03-21,0,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,Our first visit here was very lack luster as well.. BUT we decided to try and give it another chance since we were in the area.. They have a quick service system that isn't working for them.. I ordered a turkey sandwich and my fiancée a breakfast burrito.. He got his burrito and was finished it and my sandwich was no where to be seen.. someone came by to apologize that it was taking so long and offered us a cookie.. I did not want the cookie I wanted the sandwich I ordered.. But by this time we had to get going so asked them to wrap it up to go.. I hope they work out this very broken system.. But can't say that I will be back to see if they do..,ztdbXZ1Jd0NozyT5ukahzA,0,0,1,uzGO54huab-SkD3bhzp8HA

Still so many items on the menu to try, but the garden Benedict was excellent,  as was the one & one made with the Panama geisha beans.",S5VwOZR9ISDgVBZ7Kl4VNA,0,0,5,Bhmog4CiCp_Qoxl6kmOiuw

5945990,2015-10-14,0,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,"Someone extremely awesome had an idea to create this restaurant. Excellence in so many ways. The decor is something you'd see in Melbourne or Brooklyn, the colors are inviting and warm, the bathroom is clean and modern and it's hard not to want anything on display at the counter. Loved my breakfast and my nutella with banana pastry. A welcoming gentleman was at the door to greet us and explain the whole concept of the restaurant. From the looks of things, the conversations around me seemed like frequented customers. I don't think you can go wrong with anything from the menu. A bit of concern is pastry is not all of them are labeled and we thought we were ordering the apricot danish but we got something else. Would be bad if I had an allergy. Anywho, the chef definitely knows what he's doing. Bravo guys!

The ONE and ONLY reason I did not give this establishment a solid 5 stars is that my coffee was no bueno. It wasn't the restaurant's fault as I can tell they use legit beans and a bad ass machine but my barista didn't make a cappuccino, well... like a cappuccino. No foam, my milk was burnt and the bubbles displayed on the picture shows that they are large which means it wasn't executed correctly. Sorry! I hate to be that person but I know my coffee. Blame it on my stint in Europe lol! I'm happy to visit this place again though, actually, I can't wait. And I plan on altering this review once I get that amazing cappuccino I know you can make.",RArQt74He3Ok8asTRUw2FQ,3,2,4,k_vPaHiZEaHEg0EfV50ssg

The place definitely pays attention to the details. You should absolutely try their croissant with ham. It is served warm and melts in your mouth. Too bad this restaurant is situated in a not very nice neighborhood and you see out of the window a lot of homeless people walking around. Rather than that it would be perfect. We will come back!",wwKQ3KG83TB3va3rUfIbTg,1,1,5,J8e8fB9t7M9aJLePDy1QxQ
5960353,2015-10-12,2,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,"First time here, I got the coffee rubbed roast beef sandwich and one to one. The sandwich was delicious and served with a light salad and homemade potato chips (that's what it seems like. If they're store bought then I'm slightly embarrassed oops). For coffee, I had the one on one which is a small cappuccino served with a shot of espresso. I don't consider myself an expert on coffee, but I can appreciate the art and that was well-pulled shot of espresso.

Second time, I got the macadamia nut latte. I didn't expect the bits of nuts in it. I thought the nuts would be more finely ground to have just the taste. It has a really strong nut flavor at first and then you make progress to the espresso at the bottom of the cup. Overall - delicious.

The staff has been kind and helpful to me and even told me ""Now you're like family!"" which made me feel quite special. I'm also a sucker for great interior design and furniture. Although a little bit uncomfortable for my butt, I'm willing to sit and chill here to enjoy the atmosphere or study for a while.",mal1-gQ2HqpSORWBQibv7A,4,2,5,1I4NSOtmADEiMBDGdte_dA

5982923,2017-09-15,0,0EgYXYjt2XJL4hlsKnzrcw,Went there and got the smashed avocado toast. Which was loaded with avocado and the poached egg made it pop along with the greens and tomatoes!  I had really great service from Mary Lou(I hope I got it right). I ordered a vanilla latte which was amazing but while I waited Mary Lou had me try one of their coffee cocktails which was delicious. Overall the food was great but their service is even better. I will definitely be back. I love the vibe of their staff and their love for food definitely shows by their display of it.,l31ARCG8quGOgSzzJTPWXA,0,0,5,o9xhJRBYaz4lFhm4le5ojw
