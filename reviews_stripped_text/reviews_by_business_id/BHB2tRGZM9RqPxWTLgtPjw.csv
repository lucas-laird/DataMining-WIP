It shares its kitchen with the Indian joint so you know it must be good by transient property. The menu is full of heart stopping amounts of meat and one veggie option, a lone veggie burger. I ordered it up and consumed it at once. It was pretty good. Seemed to have some Indian spices which was kind of cool. The cook time was good and the only thing that sucked was lack of ketchup at the counter. Everyone else that ordered here seemed to enjoy their burgerous occasion.",GMHsJ-4_08LjEmk8YEBm8Q,1,0,4,WdXnp0gUKWjRRrFF7tglqQ

Whoever wrote the other reviews has never set foot into a real Burger place that has the Fresh Ground beef.

They have the kitchen to do it......buy a meat grinder and start grinding daily, charge more and make more.....and watch your sales GROW!",ryaEZAY-SynlLoR5tGUCfw,0,0,2,sSia6w7pqz-bfY7i_Lra0w
