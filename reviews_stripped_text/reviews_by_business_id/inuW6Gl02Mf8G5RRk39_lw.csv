Chada Street is very different from Chada in some aspects and similar in others. The space is fairly bright (some pretty cool lighting fixtures) and cavernous with almost and industrial feel with concrete floors and unfinished wood paneling. As you walk in there are several sofas across the front of the restaurant creating a bit of a lounge area and the bar to the left stretching most of way to the kitchen.

Much has written about all the dishes we had and all I will add is that most of the dishes absolutely popped with flavors and depth (oh those oysters were simply astounding. I hope they make their way on to the regular menu!). The beef tartare and the crab curry both had excellent flavors but fell flat. The tartare cut was too big while the crab curry too runny. The fish, shrimp, pork belly/green chile, spring rolls and northern sausage were OUTSTANDING! Hold a gun to my head and make me choose between Chada and Chada Street it would come down to whether I want open and airy (CS) or dark and intimate (Chada).",AeQbL7ZA-dbMLf4I--l2_A,0,0,4,SHa1rAenJPRm2uxQyc1rFw

The wine list is a steal.  So many great choices.  

The food can be a little inconsistent but when it's good, goddamn.  The chicken wings are killer, coated in some kind of lime powder and toasted rice powder...they've got some kind of trick to them.  Crab fried rice is killer, Sai ua, larb, pork knuckle, glassy noodle salad with seafood, pad kee mow, pork and pea shoot salad...there's really too much good stuff to list.  There's a reason why it's an industry favorite.

If your idea of good Thai food is Pad Thai with chicken, this probably isn't the place for you (though I think they do make that).  That dish doesn't exist in Thailand and the food here more closely resembles what you get in Thailand.

It was about 10 pm on a Wednesday night, this place had 3 small tables. We were a group of 5. I thought to myself, great, it's not crowded. Hopefully, the food will come out fast. So we got started with our orders. Then we waited... and waited... and waited. When dishes finally started arriving. To our disappointment after all that wait, the portion was like a tapas. It looked nothing like the pictures we saw on Yelp. It was so small. I checked again... we are at the same restaurant as these reviews. Each of the five of us took a small portion and the plate was empty. Not to mention how slow it took for the next dish to come out. Only one dish would come out at a time. We would go through that dish within minutes and then waited for another 10 minutes before the next dish would be brought out. Now remembered, there were three other tables in the restaurant. This place was empty. As empty and slow as it was that night, the chef also managed to forget to make one of our orders. WTF... How do you forget to make an order when it is this slow...? When the waiter told us the cook forgot our dish, we have had several dishes and each one had a long wait. We finally cancel that missing dish because we didn't want to wait another 10-15 minutes.

The decor for the restaurant was somewhat modern. There's a private room for 20 or so in the back and an attractive wine cellar/display room in the front. The bar even looks nice. But I don't understand why they used cheap, mismatched plates and utensils? It really makes the place feels cheap. But the food isn't cheap at all. The price on the menu seems average, but you would have to order 2-3 plates to get the equivalent portion of other restaurants. I've looked at some of their wine lists. There are about 300% markups on most bottles. Really...? Even the casinos only have 150% markups.

To top off our evening, beware of the erroneous gratuity charge being included. On the menu, it says, ""For your convenient, gratuity may be included in your bill.""  For us, they decided to add 20%.  WTF...? That is just wrong...  So for this whole experience, I'm giving it just one star....

I had a craving for Tom Yum soup, so I ordered the closest thing they have on the menu. The soup taste wasn't so bad but there were only a few shrimps & vegetables in it. I ended up had to eat rice with the spicy broth so I at least could get full before heading back to the hotel. The inside of the restaurant was very dark, I had a hard time reading the menu. Before the trip, I did some research and saw good reviews about this restaurant hoping that after trying it out, it might become a permanent place on my list whenever I'm in LV. But not so sure about that anymore. The hostess/waitress lady was too busy concentrating on the tables with either larger groups or had more expensive dishes and neglected my table. For some reasons, it took her much longer to bring out our food than other tables, even the ones who came in after we did. She forgot to give us napkins so we had to ask for it. After I found out the soup was literally broth with almost nothing in it, I tried to wave her over to order an extra dish, but to no avail, she didn't even glance at our table for a long,long time,until the larger group table folks left. At one point, my friend was coughing non-stop from the spicy soup,  I had to ask for water from the next table's waiter, who was more attentive and helpful. When we're almost done, she did come back to the table & asked us how everything was, making sure we remember her as our waitress and leave a tip. The unpleasant experience here actually ruined that whole night because as I left the restaurant, I felt bad, confused, and not as valued as some other customers there.",g8tq_y_P6s8M88bpCH9QjQ,0,0,2,GvJ6aoNffIDJhrE1qOAEqg

This has me in a constant search for great places to eat and has also caused me to be rather jaded and rarely will I take the time to right a review. Only if it's really bad or off the chart good. Chada Street is fantastic! I like big, bold flavors and Chada did not disappoint. I had the Moo Ma Now for an appetizer and it had tender sliced pork with a perfectly balanced sauce of lime juice, fish sauce, chili and garlic. There was nothing bashful about this dish and I found myself using a spoon to get every last drop of the sauce. I then had the Sen Mee Kang Pou. It had a spicy, rich curry loaded with real crabmeat and thin rice noodles spun into little balls served on the side, perfect for dunking into this amazing curry. I was told that this is one of their signature dishes. Finally I had the Pad Kee Mao which is a constant that I order in any Thai restaurant and thus always a standard of comparison. I always order it extra hot and am in most cases underwhelmed by the results. I loved this! The noodles were silky little sheets folded into a hot, spicy sauce with pork, chilies and basil (and no carrots; nothing against carrots but I hate when restaurants sneak them in as filler). I found the service to be great. My waitress, Preyadar, was so unusually professional in every little mannerism. Although she was balancing many tables, she was incredibly attentive and visited my table no less than 6 times without ever being intrusive or catching me mid mouthful.

955548,2016-08-05,0,inuW6Gl02Mf8G5RRk39_lw,"Duck Panang Curry: 10/10 - A little expensive for the portion, but the taste and quality is the best I've ever had. 

Honey Brick Toast Dessert with Vanilla and Chocolate Ice Cream: 10/10 - Best brick toast dessert I've ever had, perfectly fluffy on the inside, nice and crisp on the outside, served very warm with good portions of ice cream. However, lose the mint leaf, since it's only decorative and inedible garnishes are bullshit. 

Grilled Prawns: 9/10 - good sized prawns (medium-large) served with excellent authentic thai chili sauce, exactly like they make it in Thailand (been looking for a place that has it in the US, finally found it). 

Pork Hock: 8/10 - Good portion, nice and crispy skin. Needs a sweeter/spicier sauce to accompany it though. 

Crab Curry: 8/10 - Not a huge portion, but the flavor is excellent. The cold rice noodles are too sticky though and hard to break apart, so you end up with noodle meatballs. I recommend serving over rice instead. 

Chicken Pad Thai: 7/10 - Solid choice, definitely above average, but not the best thing on the menu. 

Fried Calamari: 4/10 - Small portion, breading not light or airy as it should be, mediocre flavor, no good dipping sauce. Definitely the worst thing we tried on the menu.",7gQwoxYfxVt1ZL7C6WoZQA,1,1,5,2IMa0r04FEovOFCUuSO6aw

We went in and waited several minutes to be seated even though it was very slow for a Friday night. Then when we were seated the servers kept walking past us and when we signaled for help they'd either walk away or say one minute (in a rude interrupting way). We waited 15 minutes without anyone even getting a drink order. Finally we decided to leave. As we walked out one of the servers was standing in place and looked directly at us but did not stop to ask if there was anything he could do or why we were leaving. He didn't even say good bye.

1076514,2015-08-23,0,inuW6Gl02Mf8G5RRk39_lw,"I'm not sure what to say about this place. It was good. Don't think flavors are as sophisticated as Lotus of Siam, but it's supposed to be Thai street food so maybe that's an unfair comparison. 

I think we visited when it reopened after their soft opening. The place was dead. It's a nice, open space but dark. With my recent realization that I need reading glasses, I had a hard time reading the menu in the dimly lit room. The wine cellar has a prominent spot, so you automatically assume a higher end dining experience with the modern decor but there is a little bit of a disconnect because you get your utensils from a box on the table and the plates are the plastic melamine you would find at a Chinese food take out joint. No high chairs available which was a little problematic for us.

Service was attentive and the carafe of ice water was always replaced promptly when empty.  We tried the crab fat fried rice, regular pad thai, chicken stay, and fried pork belly. Not the most original of choices but we had three picky children to feed so we needed to be conservative. Flavors were good. Pork belly was a little on the dry side and too salty. The chicken satay was on point with the sauce being a favorite of the kids so much so we got two orders. I thought the chicken was a little dry but nothing that a good slathering of sauce couldn't correct.

The dishes here are small portions like tapas so it's perfect to try a bunch of dishes without heavily committing to one. The prices, however, seemed a little high for what it was. Again,  they're going for street food but seem to be looking for a more fine dining atmosphere. 

We weren't disappointed in the food, but I'm not sure if the food was any better than what we can get at our neighborhood Thai restaurant. Perhaps it was our choices that night, but it just didn't meet our expectations.",ld6Y4P4lntLEgMvVe81-2A,1,0,3,CTdyP8gXD9MypdIPsXn2lw

We were excited to try it since we always go to the original Chada location. Our server was very knowledgeable about the food and shared with us that he actually lived in Thailand for a while so he suggested some of the most popular dishes. Service and food were on point that night. Fast forward to yesterday... very bad experience. I usually don't like going out on V-day since I am a waitress and I know what it is to deal with customers all day long on one of the busiest days of the year, but being that my boyfriend and I worked all day and night we decided to go. I made a reso for 10:45 pm and luckily there were only 4 tables occupied in the restaurant when we got there so we were seated right away. So we looked at the menu for a while and decided on food and drinks but for over 10 minutes no one came to the table, not even a ""I'll be right with you"". Bunch of employees kept walking by us and nothing. I understand if the restaurant is busy but none of the employees there had any sense of urgency or hospitality. Then my boyfriend just stopped someone and asked if we could have a server to at least take our drink order. This lady did. I am not sure if she was a server or busser but she took our food order as well. After that we had another lady also taking care of us. Food is nothing compared to the original Chada. The appetizers that we had were ok, nothing memorable, but then we ordered the duck panang with a side of sticky rice and the duck was super overcooked. Like if it was cooked during the day and kept on a hot box through service or maybe it was just old duck. Same with the sticky rice. Overcooked and also crusty. It took a minute for the server to stop by and asked if everything was ok since the dish sat in front of us for a while. We told her what was wrong and she offered to box it up for us.

northern herb sausage- the lemongrass in here is overpowering yet delicious. The condiments on the side were the perfect balance to cleanse the palate and enhanced the spices used in the sausage. 

fried pork belly- yes! nicely deep fried and you get to dip it in a cool green chili. Loved it. 

catfish larb- I think I would have definitely stuck with pork larb instead. The catfish texture was quite mushy and a little bit on the salty side. 

steamed fish curry in banana leaf- this steamed fish curry had lots of exotic flavors, but i wished there was more fish in it. 

crab fried rice- the fried rice was good. It has quite a bit of crab lumps, but i think i want to try the crab curry next time.

Service was friendly and attentive, wide assortment of wine and beer available, classy and romantic atmosphere with low lighting.

SAI OUA: House-made Northern Thai sausage. This is one of the more unique dishes on the menu, served with a variety of garnishes (lettuce, onion, peanut, ginger) that bring out the various herbal flavors within the sausage itself. Lots of heat in this, watch out.
MOO PING: Garlic pork skewers, simple but well executed. Five skewers for $6, tender meat and fragrant with garlic. Enjoyable if safe dish.
POR PIA YUAN: Fresh spring roll with vegetables and pork meat loaf? This seemed like another simple, straightforward dish, but the punch of herbal flavor beats any other version in town. This was paired with an odd dipping sauce similar to a hot-and-sour? The combination didn't really work for me, but I enjoyed the rolls themselves.
HOR MOK PHUKET: Curry fish cake wrapped in banana leaf. Probably my favorite dish that I ordered, with just the right amount of heat and a comforting combination of curry and fish, formed into a patty and wrapped like a gift. I especially liked how fresh thai basil leaves were also included in the packet.

 I know the menu is intended to be skewed more toward the ""street foods"" of Thailand, but it seemed like there were far too many safe, predictable dishes on the menu. Perhaps a separate ""street"" menu would be more helpful? I find myself more likely to return to their sister restaurant, Chada Thai, than come back- but I do want to try the crab fried rice and crab larb dishes with a wine or two.

This is a tapas plate so expect to order many small things versus one main coarse. We had the fried pork belly- AMAZING, pork skewers, fried catfish, sticky rice, and crab fried rice.

So on New Year's Day my in-laws from Thailand were craving authentic Thai food.  This place dos not come up on our Yelp search since we were looking for Thai restaurants... But it is a great find!

Pros:
- really good Thai food including northern dishes which are sometimes very hard to find
- excellent customer service
- a much better wine list than most Thai restaurants

Cons:
- I'm from out of town- but parking here is a pain. There is a parking lot but at dinner time it is very full

Tips:
- don't expect an American version of a Thai restaurant- this place would work as a more contemporary restaurant in Bangkok. It's a fun atmosphere- very casual
- would be a GREAT place for date- good dos and wine and relaxed- good for conversation 
- crab fat fried rice- AMAZING!
- sai oua (northern sausage)- really delicious and very authentic.  Some places use tons of filler- this is very lean and tasty",cKeh3M_9IXm8Sj_vSCGh3A,1,0,5,wkGfNrpqeepeMIWO_KdEfg

My friends who went with me for my birthday all agree that it seems like this restaurant belonged in some cool ""downtown"" setting. The place reads like a nice upscale restaurant. The walls are mostly wood and there are accents of metal, from the chandeliers to the boxes that contained the silver wear and the water cups. The service was a bit on the slow side through out most of the dinner, our server didn't make too much of an impression. The food started to come out one plate at a time, which I understand if we were eating family style, but we were not. The food tasted pretty good. The overall flavor was not as spicy as I would usually expect from a Thai restaurant. Except for when I decided to try the hork mok phuket for the first time. It had a pretty good level of spice and flavor.
Now, afterwards I felt bloated and found myself repeating the food. A friend of mine also felt bloated. It was not the most comfortable feeling. I'm a pretty adventurous eater. Therefore, more than likely I would give this place another try. Perhaps ask for a higher level of spice on certain items and maybe try some of their vast selection of wine, since I stuck to water when I went. Also, I may try dessert. Some of them looked interesting. Hopefully the after effects won't be the same.",n_JkxLDM54i4IrkyG8pIkA,0,0,4,PzF2TUyc3YThquOMXndocw

Tom yum $10: I had to ask for no coconut milk for this since they only had tom yum kai. It's the same as Chada Thai and I think their tom yum is always great. Perfectly sour and spicy(ask for hot if you like spicy) 

Spicy chicken wings$7: it comes with only 5 but they were surprisingly good! It's a dry rub and has a little sour kick to them. 

Crispy pork belly $6: wish it was a little more crispy! I also had to sprinkle some salt to give it some flavor. 

Crab fat fried rice $12: very good! It had a great seafood crab taste. It could of used a little bit more crab meat.

2594058,2015-09-25,3,inuW6Gl02Mf8G5RRk39_lw,"This Thai restaurant is definitely on my radar.  Thai street food!?  It doesn't get better than that, I am told!  I ordered the fried pork belly, and the crab fat fried rice.  Summary of impressions: impressed.  

The crab fat fried rice is a classic dish done in a slightly Americanized fashion.  That said, it was very yummy.  At $12, it's a small portion, but the crab meat comes in the form of bite sized chunks.  This isn't the traditional way to prepare this dish (traditionally it is prepared with shredded crab meat that is cooked into the fried rice, but silly westerners tend to complain when they can't actually see the crab).  As far as this style of crab fried rice, this is the best I've had.  The traditional style always tastes better to me though (the crab flavor comes out better).  The rice is topped with big fluffy scrambled egg and very fresh basil.  The spices and herbs are mixed well.  The Nam Pla Prik (fish sauce with peppers) wasn't the best, but a few sprinkles and chili peppers did compliment the dish.  The only complaint, other than not using the more traditional style of using shredded crab, was that the rice was pretty oily.  It still tasted great though.     

The fried pork belly was quite yummy.  It was lightly breaded, and fried in a ""Thai Crispy Pork"" sort of way, but at $6 was really just an appetizer to share.  It came with only chunks of fried pork belly.  The pork belly itself was very fatty and yummy, although perhaps a little too salty for me.  The dipping sauce was a green colored, lightly sweet and peanuty kind of sauce that was quite original and interesting.  Excellent appetizer dish!

I've saved my recommendation for last.  First of all, thanks to my friend Weston for trying just about every dish at this place, and recommending to me his favorites.  The Ka Moo Tod, or pork hock, is something I definitely recommend trying.  This thing is what it says, a giant ham hock, nothing more, nothing less.  I suggest ordering this with a few other items and with some friends to enjoy it with.  It's slightly difficult to cut through the crispy skin, but underneath lies a very indulgent layer of fat and tender pork.  The sauce that comes with this is a light, hot, vinegary, sweet and sour sauce, and paired with the pork beautifully.  Order some white rice to go with it.  Every bite was decadent to say the least.

I was thinking about bumping this up to 5 stars for it's originality and brave approach to highly authentic Thai street food.  The food is great, but I can't say that it blew me away so much as to earn a top spot as one of my favorite Thai restaurants.  A lot of people might not get it, but I think Vegas is ready for this.  You have to order a few dishes, and share with family and friends.  Eat with a spoon, using your fork to scoop a little bit of everything onto said spoon.  This is a place to eat real Thai food like a real Thai guy.  Oh, and have a nice bottle of wine with your meal as well!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,4,3,4,stLt5K8SUZCInJK1Hgkufw

My first impression of this restaurant is that it is opened past midnight which is nice since I am primarily a nigh owl. When you walk into the building you see beautiful decorations and interior as I had stated in my previous tips. They have a separate closed off room for large parties and a huge wine room. The seating area with the couches by the door is unique as well. The menu has a great selection of every genre of Thai food. I had ordered Catfish Larb and Nua (Beef) Nam Tok. The flavor is quite authentic and very tasteful, but the downfall of this place is that the portions are very small. Catfish Larb was $8, and the Nua Nam Tok was $17. Each dish was only enough to feed one person.. barely. My boyfriend and I ended up ordering Chicken Wings which are the best tasting chicken wings I have ever had. The flavoring is much like the mexican chili candy my boyfriend stated. Additionally, the staff was kind and very accommodating when needed.

Lotus used to be known as some of the best Thai in Vegas, although the original Chada has gained it's own loyal following for good reason. Chada Street differs in that it's more ""street"" food, with prices to match. The ambiance however, is nicer than Chada I think, with plush couches in the entrance, a long bar on the left serving beer and wine, a glass cellar to the right, and a private tasting room in the back with gold metal accents and beautiful gold floral chandeliers scattered throughout.

Everything on the menu, and I mean EVERYTHING is delicious. The Crab Fat Fried Rice, the Won Ton Pad Thai, the Oysters, the Pork Skewers,  the Papaya Salad are standouts. Sorry for not putting the thai names....I don't remember them and can't find the menu online! The Oysters come with three sauces to put on top: fried shallots, a green chili paste, and a green herb chili sauce. None of them are too hot but combined with the oyster make up the PERFECT bite, so crispy, salty, smoky, sweet, and refreshing. I've never had anything like it. The food is fresh, beyond flavorful, and doesn't leave you feeling overly full or greasy. It's impossible to eat takeout Thai after this, or even compare the two. This is real food. There's a curry steamed fish (tilapia usually) that comes wrapped in a palm frawn or banana leaf I believe, that just melts in your mouth and is excellent served over sticky rice. Finish it all off with toasted brioche and custard. My mouth is watering just thinking about it all now....It's incredible, and so affordable!

We had to try the magic color changing limeade, so fun. Every dish was wonderful. The peanuts were warn, slightly salty, made with several herbs for a unique and wonderful taste. The crab fat fried rice, Thai sausage (accompanied by ginger, onions, peanuts and cabbage) was a plateful of spicy goodness. The pork skewers are amazing, but my favorite was the catfish.  The menu says in chile sauce, and the dish is spicy, but the dish is so flavorful and doesn't taste anything like the red chile sauce that the description brings to mind. Pimi (so sorry if I spelled your name wrong) was helpful, enthusiastic, and a great contribution to a perfect meal. She recommended a Gruner Veltlinger which was a soft and easy accompaniment to the variety of dishes. And, unbelievably, even with the bottle of wine the total for the four of us was under $100.

2798923,2016-05-26,3,inuW6Gl02Mf8G5RRk39_lw,"I'm a huge fan of the more upscale and refined Chada Thai, and this sister restaurant does a good job of paying homage to street food and food markets in Thailand. The space is beautiful and intimate, with an urban feel. The food is affordable and well executed with the same passion and precision that Chada Thai is known for.

You'll be hard pressed to find a better chicken satay ($7) in town then the tender, well seasoned version here. It's also a great dish if you have a kid who's a picky eater with you. If you're sensitive to spice, you may want to avoid the spicy herb sausage Sai oua ($8). There were some great flavors there, but it was too spicy for my palate. The crab curry ($12) was more restrained with its spice, yet displayed plenty of depth and smokiness. Shredded bits of crab could be found throughout and pouring it over the rice noodles made for a great combination.

The small portions made it possible to sample plenty of other dishes. The stir fried cabbage ($7) was simple and satisfying. Crispy chunks of cabbage were mixed with bacon. It was a mild dish that was a nice contrast to previous dishes. My two favorite dishes were the fried pork belly ($7) and lab moo ($8, ground pork, chili, onion, lime). I'm a sucker for anything with pork belly and the deep fried strips were crispy with enough fat to enhance the flavor and keep the meat tender. 

Rounding out the meal was an excellent dish of crab fried rice ($12) large enough to share and full of crab and egg throughout. The chicken pad Thai ($9) was equally as good. It's a well known classic and they did it justice here.

The biggest drawback about Chada Street is the parking. Especially on a weekend, it can be tough to find an open spot. You may have to circle the lot several times or park behind the building, but the effort will be worth it.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,3,4,4qZwQjhALxAch4WbcixP-w
2803157,2017-10-18,7,inuW6Gl02Mf8G5RRk39_lw,"This is our go-to-restaurant when Thai/Lao friends & family come to town.  (Yes over Lotus of Siam.  I know...GASP...total blasphemy according to all the food critics etc.)  During the week, we can easily get tables pushed together for our large group (usually 10-20 people) at a moment's notice.  We usually call ahead.  Parking has never been a problem Tues-Thursday.  

We like Chada Street over their sister restaurant (Chada Thai on Jones) because 1) can accommodate large group 2) smaller portions - so we can try a variety of dishes 3) proximity to other restaurants so that we can go restaurant hopping without having to drive ;) 

The food is satisfactory enough for my ultra picky family from Thailand, who own Thai restaurants and my ultra picky Laotian family, who prefer Issan Thai (Northern) style cooking - which this place serves.  Northern Thai food & Laotian food are very similar - strong, pungent, spicy flavors rule.  If that is not your bag, ask the server for Southern style recommendations or dishes that can be made mild. 

Our staples are sausage, papaya salad Lao style, tamarind prawns, pad kee mao, crab curry with noodles, crab fried rice, & sticky rice.  Over the course of a year of eating here though, I think we have tried everything & have always left satisfied. 

Service has always been excellent.  It helps that we can speak Thai & we bring a lot of business.  Can't blame me for playing my Thai card, right? ;) 

Only minor gripe is that it's a bit pricey.  Gotta pay for that prime real estate & ambiance I guess  *shrug*  Overall great food & service.  Clean restaurant.  We'll be back again & again if everything remains as it is.  Highly recommend.",BsdMr3hnc44zZcD8PxgeSA,9,8,4,ruwNAKUe-XLRMFPcs6Mrdg

Yum Hoi oysters were yum. Haha  yeah. They were a bit spicy but it's Thai so it's to be expected. The oyster is lost in all the garnish so I was glad the garnish was tasty. It has cilantro, red onions, Thai chilies, lemongrass and what was probably rice vinegar with some fish sauce. 
Pea sprout salad was phenomenal. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and it included ground pork. The sprouts are cooked so it isn't a cold dish. The dressing was perfect and not overpowering. 
We also had a roll which was lettuce, vermicelli, mint and pork meatloaf. Not great but I don't care for mint in food.

My husband and I basically stood around the front for 10 minutes crammed in there with a bunch of other people. There was going to be a long wait without a reservation. I asked the folks around me - is it really worth it? Their hungry, but determined faces said ""YES"". So instead of waiting around, we made our way to this other location, which is much larger and featured no wait whatsoever. I don't know if the menus and execution of the dishes are exactly the same, but the Spring Mountain location has become a go-to dinner spot for me. 

The must haves:

1. Fried pork belly with the slightly spicy/slightly sour/100% magical green dip
2. Street pad thai (your choice of meat)
3. Duck Panang Curry (I don't even like duck, but the crunchy duck skin goes with the spices of the curry so well!)
4. Cabbage with bacon (gotta get your veggies in, right?)
5. Crab Fried Rice (I'm allergic now, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it)
6. Blue Pea Limeade (watch the drink change into a pretty purple color)
7. Brick Toast (such a large portion, they are not stingy with the ice cream at all)

This area can be really busy with all the different businesses up and down the block. The parking situation can be a bit competitive at times, but never too horrible. The restaurant also has a private dining room in the back, enclosed in glass.

Chada Street is in the same complex as Golden Tiki so on this particular night we decided to come here. The restaurant was maybe 75% full but the service was way off from the beginning. 

Two of us in the party got our drinks in a timely manner, but our third friend did not. The waiter came by to tell us they didn't have vermouth so they couldn't make a gin martini. She told her gin and a cucumber would be fine. Then about 10 min. later the bartender came to tell her the same thing and she repeated that gin and cucumber would be fine. Finally her drink came. 

We ordered a couple appetizers to start: the chicken wings and chicken satay. The chicken wings were delicious but had this really thick, somewhat salty/sweet/spicy coating that I didn't mind much but could have been toned down a bit. The chicken satay was tender. For dinner I ordered the chicken curry and the other two ordered pad kee mao and pad thai. The pad thai came out quickly, followed by the pad kee mao about 10 minutes later and finally my curry another ten minutes after that. I totally understand that Thai tradition may be to share dishes and eat as things come, but I guess it was a little awkward since we weren't planning to share the dishes. Also, the pad kee mao came out looking a lot like pad see ew and I think they did mess that up but it was so good my friend didn't want to change it. My curry was pretty runny and wasn't anything special. 

At the end of the dinner the waiter asked if my friend wanted another gin and she said yes but it took so long we just asked to cancel that and get the bill. After paying the bill someone brought over a gin and cucumber saying it was on the house. We were just about to leave so that was sort of annoying but hey it's a free drink and I think they understood they were messing up all night. 

Overall I think the food here is still pretty good, the vibe is good, the location and the drinks are good. This night may have been an off night but it was kind of embarrassing since I brought some friends that were staying/eating at the Wynn all week.

3167791,2015-08-16,22,inuW6Gl02Mf8G5RRk39_lw,"Located in the ridiculously busy Chinatown shopping center off Spring Mountain & Valley View, Chada Street is the second restaurant from the minds of Chada Thai & Wine. While I've never been to the original, I've heard great things, and definitely wasn't going to turn down an invite to check out this new spot for opening day. 

The space itself is pretty big. There's plenty of seating if you plan to dine-in only, but with the menu style and how they set the place up, it looks like they might be catering more to the hang out crowd. They not only have a pretty good size bar, but also a lounge type area with big couches and tables. It's just a really nice space with a neat setup, and I can see them being crazy busy when things start rolling.

With only one page, it might look there isn't much to the menu...but looks can be deceiving. There's actually a decent amount of things to choose from, and a lot of variety as well. Soups, salads, meats, seafoods, desserts. It's all there. Everything is said to be inspired by Thai style street food and served small plate/tapas style, so it's perfect for sharing too. Pricing isn't bad either. Our table of 5 ordered a pretty good amount of food, and only spend about $80. Drinks not included of course. 

Out of everything we ordered, there really wasn't anything I didn't enjoy...but quite a few things stood out too. One of my favorite items was the Moo Tod Nam Pla (fried pork belly). It was the perfect combination of tender and crispy at the same time, but had great flavor and is served with an excellent Thai chile dip. I was also a huge fan of their two styles of Pad Thai. One is more traditional, while the other is made with stuffed crispy wontons. Both are big on flavor, with the wonton version bringing in an interesting concept with textures that I've never had in Pad Thai anywhere else. Other standouts were the Larb Moo Tod (larb meatballs), Sai Oua (house made spicy sausage) and Sa Tay (chicken skewer). Another dish I have to mention is the Tod Mun Pla (spicy fish cake), which was served with crispy basil leaves that were crazy addicting. I liked that everything had bold flavors, and nothing was overly spicy, at least for my tastebuds. The portions were quite a bit bigger than I expected too.

The service was alright, considering it was their first day, but we did have to ask for some things more than once. And for whatever reason, we had to ask for an order of the Grilled Corn Butter a good 3 or 4 times, but it still came out very last and wasn't worth any sort of wait anyhow. Oddly, they were also out of a few items. We really wanted to try the chicken wings, but they had none. Then when we went to order 1 of their only 2 available desserts, they were out of mango. Considering they were only officially open for about 2 hours when we came, that was really surprising.

At the end of our meal, the chef came out to introduce herself and ask us about our meal. It was a nice touch and overall, I really enjoyed Chada Street. I can definitely see myself coming back.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,30,25,4,DDB5F-H11SGci7h1CrCtnw

This last point is really my biggest gripe. 1 star for the $750 minimum to be seated in a 12 person private room.  I mean, it's Chada Street. The entire definition of the place is small plates and affordable pricing. So even over ordering and bringing home 7 boxes of leftovers from a 10 person dinner...we weren't even halfway there. How am I supposed to spend $750 there?  And really....you're a Thai restaurant in a strip mall. It's not table service on the strip. Give me a break. I thought it was unfortunate to not offer this to your guests...especially since the restaurant never hit 50% occupancy on a Saturday night. This one point really knocked this place down a few notches for me.

Nope, doesn't come with any sauce and after a bite of it, I know why...the unique flavoring mixed with the batter is enough.  Deliciously different (I believe it's some type of tamarind seasoning).

We went in on a slow night and there were only about 5 or 6 seated tables. The place is SUPER cute and cozy, love the decor. LOVE the music they play in both restaurants. But then there was the breakdown in service and food. Now don't get me wrong...the servers were extremely nice but the food came out SO SLOW. Like, epically slow. Unless there was only one cook in the kitchen, I just cant figure out what that problem was. The restaurant never reached more that 5 to 7 seated tables during our 3 1/2 hr dinner. Thankfully we hadn't seen our friend in years and had tons of catching up to do so it helped me not lose my sh*t over the amount of time we waited between each dish. We also had a vegetarian with us that I made very extremely clear that she would be ordering her own dish for dinner, well her plate of food came out almost 30 mins after our food came out. I finally had to ask ""Where is our friends food?! We have been incredibly rude eating in front of her!!!"" they said it would be right out and it was another 10 mins later, only after I shot the server a stern look from across the dining room. And when her dish came out she had asked for mild but her dish was so hot it burned all of our throats. And none of us are wimps to spice, we just prefer to taste our food. They also forgot my side dish of fried rice. Oh well, I wasn't going to make a fuss at that point over rice. I would like to give them a second chance because they were nice, didn't have a problem that we stayed so long (even though this was mostly due to our slow food service) and the ambiance is very nice there. I'm going say that this must have been an off night with the chef or perhaps low staffing.

Crab fried rice
Crab curry with vermicelli noodles
Grilled pork skewers
Northern Thai spicy pork sausage
Duck curry
Pork and pineapple curry
Crispy pork hock
Fried pork belly
Chicken wings
Catfish curry
Larb moo- ground pork
Two honey toast - one which vanilla and one with chocolate ice cream
Shaved ice
Bread with pandan custard

Chada Street's emphasis is on Thai street food served in a small plates manner.  My favorites of the dishes we tried were the pork sausage, crab fried rice, duck curry, catfish curry, and larb.  All were flavorful and I would order any of them again.  The crab curry was very good but would have been better served with rice than vermicelli noodles.  They varied a little in spice level but I'd say medium spiciness for most people.  The honey toast was OK with my favorite topping being the vanilla ice cream.

The dishes I was not as impressed with were the pork belly--it needs to be crispier, the pork skewers were OK but nothing special, and I thought the pork hock was the biggest let down of the meal.  Except for the fatty outside section in one area, it just didn't do anything for me.

Service was a mixed bag.  On ordering the many dishes, it was asked that the dishes be coursed out and not brought all at once.  We were finishing the first dishes when some more were brought and almost immediately three more were brought out.  We reused them and they were taken back to the kitchen.  At first we had to ask for clean share plates.  Later in the meal, they changed them without asking and they provided some clean silverware.

Make sure you get the limenade.  It's a very tasty, refreshing citrus drink.  Too bad they ran out just before I ordered a second glass so I made do with water.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,11,9,3,lvVAxPOCs5KCyyI_RcxI1A
3988567,2017-05-29,0,inuW6Gl02Mf8G5RRk39_lw,"A highly rated spot by many food Gurus of Las Vegas.
For the right reasons. 
My buddy and I ventured here for some late night dinner (1 am) with a fair amount of LV liquid in us. To balance things off, we wanted and were ready, to kerb our hunger. 
An attentive hostess guided us to very comfortable spot, let me take a minute and explain the decor. It is probably one of the finest modern decors for a South Asian restaurant. It is open plan layout with bar in a nice corner on the left-hand side. A few cosy cabins for family dinners or romantic private dining area. The biggest surprise, for me and my mate, was the wine cellar. There is wine pretty much on all the walls with massive cellar at the rear of the restaurant. 
Our server promptly brought us the food menu along with the wine list. I did not venture onto the wine list as I was done with a liquid diet for the evening. My mate, however, did share some amazing wines listed - from France - top shelf to some new varieties. My next visit here will be the start of the evening, not the last spot.
We played it safe by ordering the GO To Thai delicacies - I ordered the Shrimp and Chicken both were just f......tic awesome and my mate ordered a curry, which I could not help but take half of it. 
The only complaint I have is the sizes were a bit on the smaller side, maybe it was us late night hungry guys. 
Overall, a top spot in Las Vegas, a Wine list that could spar with fine dining Casino locations.

I was a little disappointed that they don't have the same spring rolls as their other location. The ones here were good, but pretty basic TBH. Standard Vietnamese pork roll, noodles, lettuce, carrots. Nothing special.

We also tried the crab curry noodles. I liked this how ever it was entirely too spicy in the heat sense. We asked for everything medium and this was beyond. The dish was okay. Presentation was nice but not practical. 

We also got the pad se ewe. Very standard dish but done well. Really good char on the noodles.

We shared a shrimp coconut soup. This was very good, but also salty. The shrimp they used were high wuality and perfectly cooked. It was creamy, sour, spicy, and delicious.

The last entree we got was their New York steak done in a salad. This was the star for me. I'm Thai and Lao and this hit home. Something I would eat at home but with a high quality cut of meat. It was basically seared steak that was minced up with lime, charred rice, chili, and herbs. Served with raw cabbage and cucumber this was just really delicious. We got a side of sticky rice like how I'd eat it at home.

We got the honey toast for dessert that had 4 scoops of ice cream. This was nice to share with our group.

Overall I was scared to come here because I thought it was expensive but they have dishes ranging from $7 and up. Very affordable. The staff was really nice. They had a lot of people helping out our table. The ambiance was nice without cheesy Thai music playing. Nice date spot I'd say.

With everything listed above we got a glass of wine and a beer and Thai tea and it came out to under $100 which I think was really fair. 3 entrees, 3 drink, desert, an appetizer, and a soup. 

I would definitely go back to Chada Street.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,2,3,4,hspz5P8a2SvUBl-HqODUhg

I am writing this long review more for the staff to see what they can improve. I do not like bashing establishments when I see the potential like I do here.

My husband and I both have been serving for over 10 years. I am very easy to please when dining, but I do notice my surroundings. It's hard not to... myself, husband and 2 young kids wanted to grab something quick and run. Bad idea on this particular night. It took us just under 2 hours to receive our food and leave. We got there around 10:10 and were in our car at 11:57pm. It  was not extremely busy when we originally arrived. All tables were full except one, no one at the bar top and the couches were empty. Someone walked up and dropped water on our table with no conversation. Finally after another 5 minutes someone else came up and said ""ready to order"". I said ""I would actually like a drink"". She took my drink order and returned with the drink fairly quick, but walked away so I couldn't order with her. Another  7 minutes go by and I get up and flag someone else down to order.  At this point it's been over 15 minutes to even put in our food. We ordered a small bowl of Tom Kha soup, whole fried fish and grilled squid. After about 30 minutes with no one coming to our table for us to reorder a cocktail I finally got up & asked a server if I could order a drink and also questioned where our appetizer soup was. She informed me the kitchen had been backed up and she would check on the soup. She ordered us a new drink which came quick. It must have been close to 40 minutes when the food finally arrived. If the soup could have come quicker ""appetizer""  it could have really filled the long gap of NO service/food. The whole fried fish was extremely over fried. There was hardly any meat on it & likely was like that since it was just way over cooked. We added one more dish since the fish was so small and made sure to ask if the kitchen was caught up. At this point half the tables had left. She said yea it shouldn't be that long... what do ya know. Another 20+ plus minutes for fried shrimp. We actually asked for the check and to cancel the shrimp. It ended up arriving right then. I left a 10% tip...that was VERY hard for me to do. I still manage to always tip the normal 22% even when service is not to well, so this 10% tip means it was pretty bad for me. You guys need to completely reestablish all steps of services. There is no formal greeting when the server came to the table. There was 3 different people to the table before ordering food. I would expect some sort of introduction, drink order and going over the menu or at least checking if I had any questions on the menu. I am not sure if this place is a ""pulled room"", but we had all 5 servers in there at some point for each trip they made to the table. Your biggest down fall is COMMUNICATION. If your kitchen is backed up, just let me know! Do not let a table sit for 40 minutes with never checking for drinks or informing of kitchen times. Every server was busy doing something, but never slowing their pace passing each guest to  ""table touch"" or giving someone the opportunity to even ask for something. That's the reason I had to physically get up to ask for everything I needed. The table next to us got their food and she then said ""I am still waiting for my tea"". If the tea had been forgotten, the problem would have been fixed if a server touched that table from the time the order was taken to the time the food arrived. There is no system with the staff. One lady that ended up taking our food order who I ""thought was our server"" was then busy behind the empty bar the entire time after...Tables were being bussed by the servers  while the present guests were sitting needing service. If you guys had some strict steps of service, great intro when greeting a table and most importantly COMMUNICATION you would receive amazing reviews and happy guests returning. All the staff was nice and spoke good English which stands out with Thai restaurants here in Las Vegas. The decor was up to date/modern and the restaurant was clean.. also another plus compared to most Thai restaurants here in Vegas. It's not like the food was bad. I would be willing to give them another try if they could dial in the service. The last dish, fried shrimp with tamarind was actually awesome. Unfortunately when it arrived so late our kids were cranky and we had put into our heads everything wrong that was going on around us.",8Co5454mGj3xjHOvKKHUIA,3,0,2,thPHaOT_IUTaQv1ig4reyw

The dishes are tasty and portions are decent. I went with 2 others and we ordered a variety to share:

- Por Apia Yuan (Veggie Spring Rolls w/ Pork)
Delightful and came with a serving of 6 small pieces. Also had mint and basil to give it a refreshing taste and was paired with a yummy peanut dipping sauce 

- Hor Mok Phucket (Steamed Fish Curry in Banana Leaf)
Came out piping hot and a little fishy. For those who enjoy seafood but are not a fan of food that tastes ""too fishy"" this is not a dish for you. Very flavorful with the slightest spicy kick to it 

- Street Chicken Pad Thai
Pretty average and a little dry. Definitely had better Pad Thai before. One of my least favorite dishes I tried 

- Kang Kai Nor Mai (Chicken Curry w/ Bamboo Shoot) 
Tasted like a Thai Red Curry... It was delicious! Does not come with white rice so if you want rice, make sure to order separate

- Chicken Pad Kee Mow
Doused in whatever sauce Pad Kee Mow is stir fried in. Very flavorful though and had a lot of veggies in it

- Moo Tod Nom Pla (Fried Pork Belly)
The fried pork belly was to die for. We ordered another serving because we inhaled our first order. It came with a dip that reminded me of pico de gallo (a Thai infused pico?) but the batter on the pork belly was salted perfectly and the pork belly was SO juicy that I didn't even use any of the dip after my first initial try. Definitely a must try

- Peak Kai Krob (Spicy Chicken Wings) 
Ginormous sized fried chicken wings. Came with 5 wings. Deliciously seasoned with a strong taste of lime and spice but the 2 flavors worked!

- Honey Toast
Delicious per usual. Topped with Vanilla and Chocolate ice cream, diced fruit, chocolate syrup and chopped nuts

I started off with a beer but we ended up sharing a bottle of Riesling to enjoy with the majority of our dinner. It paired fabulously with the Asian flavors!

Service was on the slower side (we went on a Tuesday night, I spotted 3 servers and the place was decently busy) but the servers were all nice. The food overall was pretty good! The portions are not as small as tapas are typically served but they're also not the largest portion if you wanted to order just one dish. The size is smaller than typical Thai restaurants if you order a noodle dish like Pad Thai or go for a curry... I want to say 2/3 the normal size.

I enjoyed sharing plates here and will definitely be back. Especially for that fried pork belly!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,13,12,4,VYepi9qDvVduiduWqaI7ig

4510796,2016-10-23,2,inuW6Gl02Mf8G5RRk39_lw,"I generally don't have high expectations for a strip mall joint located two doors down from a suspect foot masseuse. 

In the case of Chada Street, the recommendation was advocated by a chef couple; the sister of my friend and her fiancée. The lovely pair is choosing this one a few days prior to tying the knot, so I went with it. And I suspected...even while circling the sketchy block...that Chada Street is really going to nail it.

Inside it's a beautiful space. Classy decor, quite modern, wine room that looks like its been transplanted from a five star steakhouse. It's not wait list full, but there are a lot of people. I'm greatly appeased by all these things. Pavlov salivation kicks in, just in case.

We let the chef couple order family style. 

I've been eating Thai for as long as I can remember, and what the hell is this guy ordering? I've barely even heard of Larb. Sausage? This is not how you Thai. But I let them hack at the menu a bit despite my reservations. They go at the wine list too. And I have some of the most delicious, wholesome, and authentic food I've ever eaten. The worst dish I had that night easily bests my favorite neighborhood Thai place.

Fast forward six months. I have a larb and sausage habit, and I'm in town again. Within an hour of checking into our strip hotel I'm dictating to my friends where we are eating dinner. Its an ambitious call...luring a couple white dudes from Dallas and a handful of Indians into a family style Chinatown meal. One of these guys thinks Chili's is the pinnacle of culinary delight. But somehow I make this happen.

We start (of course) with the homemade sausage and larb moo, and some pork belly at the recommendation of the waitress. These low brow but delicious eats nostalgically taste of a third world street vendors wares. The plate of sausage rounds the table and my buddies enthusiastically try it and argue over weather its spicy. Somehow this so intrigued our resident vegetarian that he gets a bite in. Larb is everything I remembered, think lettuce wrap with a lime kick and a bit of spice. Pork belly is underwhelming, but the dipping sauce rescues it.

For dinner we move onto more pedestrian fare. Duck panang curry makes one want to lick the plate clean, crab fat fried rice is lovely, drunken noodles and pad thai were just there to appease the Chilis guy and the vegetarian, but were plenty tasty. Being wine novices we went with a few bottles of good unfiltered cold sake to round out the meal. 

My once reluctant friends think I'm Andrew Zimmerman's long lost cousin. ""Lets do Chada House Again"" became our goto dinner mantra. Unfortunately we didn't make it back - as one of my friends put it ""that was the best thai food I've ever eaten and I don't want to ruin the memory"". He's a month or two out from living on a street corner and turning tricks for sausage and larb.",dN0Pk7JThGgV8xCH-h807w,2,0,5,Rylr0gnSfMKU5cWMQzQwPQ

It's a wonderful place to hang out with two or more friends (an optimal group is 3-4 to try several dishes at once with the right amount of food). There are a few dishes that are simply okay, but nothing to ruin the dining experience. Explore while you're here and don't just order Pad Thai.

Kao Pad Mun Pu ($12): Crab fat fried rice. A simple fried rice with crab meat and eggs placed atop. The first time I had this dish, it had quite a bit of crab and although a usually subtle flavor, came through nicely. That was not my experience the second time and made it less enjoyable. It's a tasty dish, but I probably wouldn't order it again.

Sai Oua ($8): Northern Thai spicy herb sausage. Delicious. It's just like the ones I had in Thailand. The flavors, especially the lemongrass, makes this one of my absolute favorite sausages. Keep in mind, it is quite spicy. I love the accompaniments of cabbage, red onion, ginger, and peanuts; everything is wonderful together.

Duck Panang ($18): Crispy roasted duck with panang curry. The duck is juicy and the skin is unbelievably crispy. Wowzers. The panang is tasty, although a little sweet for my preference.

Som Thum Thai ($7): Green papaya salad with dehydrated shrimp, peanuts, tomato, and green bean. Standard papaya salad; nothing special.

Moo Tod Nam Pla ($6): Fried pork belly with Nam Prik Noom (Northern Thai style green chili dip). Phenomenal. The pork belly was delicious (as pork belly usually is) and the skin was crispy. The green chili dip was flavorful without being spicy and it was great with the pork. This is definitely one of my favorites.

Tod Mun Pla ($7): Spicy fish cake with crispy Kaffir lime leaves. These cakes were oval rather than flat, so there was more texture to them rather than just being crispy and I liked that a lot. These are the best Thai-style fish cake I've had. Delicious!

Larb Pla Dook ($8): Catfish, rice powder, chili, lime juice, fish sauce, mint, onion, and cilantro. I love larb. We got catfish to do something different and it's great, but I think I prefer pork.

Pla Muk Yang ($15): Grilled jumbo squid with seafood sauce. Yum! The squid was so good and that seafood sauce is amazing. It's a green chili sauce with phenomenal flavor. I'm sure it works with a lot of other food.

Pad Kee Mao w/ Shrimp ($10): Flat noodles, chili, garlic, and Thai basil. Also known as Drunken Noodles. Pad Kee Mao is one of my all-time favorite Thai dishes and this one was rather disappointing. It was decent, but no where near impressive. This is another dish I wouldn't order again.

Kanom Pung Sung Kaya ($6): Warm bread with pandan custard. I really enjoyed this dessert. The bread is chewy and fluffy, so that was already lovely and the pandan custard is so darn tasty! I may need a whole plate to myself next time.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,8,6,4,B_OLkHW8wSsAesSXiIJ1dA

Chada Street serves excellent Thai food, which is located in the ""Chinatown"" strip mall that's west of the strip on the other side of the highway. It's like a 10 minute cab ride from most of the hotels.

The restaurant has a great modern space that's well decorated and has a cool esthetic. It was a fun room to have a meal in. The staff was also really attentive, which was a great plus. 

The food was great. I had the crab fat fried rice which was really really tasty. For an appetizer my table got the chicken satay and it was honestly one of the best chicken satays I've ever had and it was also one of the best peanut sauces I've ever had. My wife got the pad thai which I liked but she looved. She thought it was in the top 3 pad thais she's ever had. 

To splurge, I got some durian ice cream, which is an adventurous flavor since its savory more than sweet. Next time I would probably get a different flavor -- but you have to try new things, right?

One of the best parts: all this delicious food and this great experience was approximately $40 with tip. That's like 1 crappy domestic beer and 1 crappy sandwich at some run-of-the-mill place on the strip. 

I was very tempted to give this place a 5, but for now it gets a very strong 4.

This is the Thai restaurant in town  that I personally would choose when I crave for Thai food or refer to any out of town guests. Even though this restaurant opened after Chada on Jones (which I have been several times as well), I like Chada street much better. The food was unhealthily salty several times when I visited Chada on Jones. 

Service here in Chada Street though needs quite a improvement. I think I received underwhelming services 80% of the time that I was here. MANAGER, please train your servers on how to serve your customers right and be attentively! 

Just because the food is so satisfying here, I try not to let the service stopped me from coming here. Here's the list of items I've tried: 

1. Crispy pork hock (4/5): one of the dish I order often here. The chili sauce came with it makes the pork so yummy. 

2. Chicken satay (4/5): decent like your a average satay. 

3. Catfish Larb (2/5): it was way too salty for me. Flavor is okay. 

4. Crab curry with rice noodle (5/5): the most ordered dish when I come. Spicy flavorful curry with noodle is one of the reason I keep coming back. 

5. Duck panang (5/5): another my must order dish. Crispy duck with flavorful panang.However, I wish they can put a tiny bit more sauce on it. 

6. Garlic prawn (4/5): it is good but lotus still do it better. I like it better with curry than the tamarind sauce. 

7. Tom yum (4/5): decent, not better or worse than the average ones. 

8. Pad Thai and pad see eiw (4/5): both are decent and I would order again. 

9. Pad kee mao (2/5): not the type of pad kee mao that I like. Too much sauce! This is how lotus does it too which I don't order from lotus either. 

10. Crab fried rice (3/5): one time I had it, and it was very good. However, they are not consistent. It was lacked in flavor  another time I ordered.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,6,5,4,nO0khQuPf5Rjs812GUBrUw

The waiters were very friendly and explained the menu to me. It's modeled after thai street food so half the
Menu is tapas style with unique dishes, and the other half is the more traditional Thai dishes like pad Thai and curry.

For three people we got the crab fried rice, the crab curry, the fried pork belly, and the spicy catfish tapas dish.  The crab fried rice was super delicious. It was very buttery and flavorful. I can eat a whole plate of that myself. The crab curry is very heavy in coconut flavor and it's very spicy. I enjoyed it but be warned if you can't handle spice. They were also very generous with the crab meat as there were crab in each spoonful. The noodles it came with were a little mushy and did not absorb the curry flavor like rice would. The fried pork belly was very crispy and fatty. It's what you expect. It did come with this salsa verde type of sauce. I enjoyed it but probably won't order it again. The spicy catfish was packed with flavor... A little too much flavor. It was super salty for me but I think it would have been good with a heaping bowl of rice.

In some ways taking a ""casual"" detour from the more traditional cuisine of Chada Thai and Wine on Jones, Bank Atcharawan's recently launched Chada Street sees the acclaimed chef take on an aggressive menu of items commonly consumed from the vendors of Thailand's street markets, the results oftentimes resoundingly successful though service still has a long way to go.

Elegantly decorated in a stripmall on Spring Mountain, the bustling plaza unfortunately falling short of parking on Saturday at 7:30pm, Chada Street occupies a footprint nearly threefold the size of Bank's original restaurant and with a well-appointed bar beneath a photographic mural stretching the length of the dining room the seating options offered are multiple, the leather-clad lounge up front perfect for relaxation while a more proper meal is offered amongst low-lit tables or a private room extending back behind all-glass wine storage.

Prominently featuring Rieslings, though certainly not lacking for well-priced spirits sourced from around the globe, it was with menus presented beneath lightly playing tunes from Chvrches that our party of seven made selections, a total of twelve plates complimented by three more at the chef's discretion proving an adequate amount of food for all persons present with some actually leaving quite stuffed. 

Noting up front that waitresses undoubtedly speak better English than I do Thai, suffice it to say that language barriers played a big part in service issues almost from the moment seats were taken and despite repeated requests to have items paced out it was not once but twice that items were returned to the kitchen, drink refills clearly not on the list of priorities despite the menu's bold spice profile while other oysters and pandan custard were forgotten until staff was reminded.

Speaking next to the quality of the kitchen it should seem obvious that such a broad menu is bound to occasionally miss the mark, but setting aside pork belly that was surprisingly devoid of flavor and O-Aew that was more snow-cone than shaved ice the rest of the cuisine was well crafted and occasionally quite stunning without once drifting too spicy to be appealing.

Doing our best to experience a wide swath of Chada Street's cuisine it was perhaps with good fortune that opening plates showed most strongly, and with blue tea that turned purple with the addition of citrus adequately refreshing palates between bites both the housemade  pork sausage and duo of crabs were each boldly flavored and nicely presented, a requested side of rice helping sop up the Sen Mee Kang Pou's sauce while skewers of grilled pork would have better ordered in double to allow for more sharing.

Already seeing the 8-top's capacity likely to be challenged by sizable service plates and portions defying the low costs it was mere moments after round one that two more curries presented, the slightly overcooked pork shank also allowed to be delivered while four more plates were refused, then sent back once more to be reprepared just ten minutes later so that the crispy skinned fowl and pork in a pool of spicy pineapple broth could properly be savored.

No doubt attuned to his recipes, Atcharawan's spicier plates saved until later in the meal, it was with a light tingle from the crab and duck sill lingering on the lips that the oft-raved larb was presented, and 'hot' to some even though requested medium both the flavor and texture were indeed excellent, the catfish in chili paste equally praiseworthy while the crisp chicken wings got a little lost in a flavor I presume was a numbing spice mixed with tamarind. 

Passing on durian based desserts and modestly amused by the mix-ins beneath the aforementioned 'shaved ice,' it was perhaps 'lucky' that a double order of warm bread beneath sweet custard reminiscing of Ghostbusters was brought forth singular since several in the group were already topped off, the duo of honey toasts forgivingly smaller than those at Hachi or Izakaya and undoubtedly benefited by more honey and creamier ice cream.

****Still finding its footing, the front of house lagging behind the skills of those at the stoves, Chada Street is a welcome addition to a genre that has seen great growth since Lotus of Siam became a destination.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,14,12,4,jTT2E4Hp-QNoJ-yA58_G_Q

I've eaten here twice, first for dinner and more recently for lunch. First time I ate here I was very impressed with the interior and how affordable the prices were. We ordered an appetizer and two entrees for around $25. Our waitress was also very welcoming and attentive. Food was delicious and rightly portioned, so we weren't uncomfortably full or dissatisfied. 

But more recently, I came here during my lunch break around 2pm on a Thursday. I was a little disappointed from this visit, but not enough to not want to come back. First of all, we found out that they do not have any lunch specials - everything's the same price for lunch and dinner. That was disappointing. And they close at 3 for lunch and reopen again for dinner around 5. Our waitress was polite, but we could sense she was in a rush to get us out as soon as possible. Also, towards the end of our meal, I had declined her offer for more water for I was finished, and she came back 5 minutes later and poured me more water - which would've been fine if it wasn't for the fact that it was water from the pitcher she picked up from the table sitting next to us that they've had their entire meal. And lastly, we noticed they sat an older couple next to us (menu, cutlery and all) .. And as we were getting up to leave, our waitress tells them that they are closing soon and asked if they'd like to order to go instead. I felt that was really unprofessional to seat your customers and have them expect to be served food only to be told never mind. 

All-in-all, nice restaurant with delicious affordable food .. Just don't go there during their lunch hours.",C_PklbtFOnm-UVMUwi2iHg,0,0,4,6TecskL_b6kx8FhuKszYCg

Cute couches to sit and chat over a wide selection of wines or even sitting at the bar taking in the wall to wall moral. The ambience is perfect even for the early arrivals us as me; 6pm dinner. 
The appetite was on the lighter side but what we ordered for the table was very satisfying. Each entree has some much flavor. Should you venture into the signature crab curry, be sure to have a pitcher of water near by. This sure has that spicy kick you may be craving. My absolute favorite though was the grilled squid! It was a presentation in itself and the sauce reminded me of a chimichurri spread with a little spice. Although I was at the point of uncomfortable I HAD to try the dessert; honey toast!

5607804,2017-02-26,0,inuW6Gl02Mf8G5RRk39_lw,"BUMMER!!!

First of all, let me just say that when I have friends come to town and they want to eat off the strip, Chada Thai is usually where I send them. When I know they are going to end up drinking a bit, I send them to Chada Street and then tell them to walk to a nearby Tiki Bar to have some shenanigans. Last night, I had a friend in town and we hit Chada Street for the first time in about 6 months: This House Has Fallen. 

Secondly, having been here before, the decor, layout and menu all delight me. The wine list is pretty fantastic as well. The oysters were actually pretty fantastic. That's where the compliments are going to end. 

Thirdly, a few points about last night:
* AMBIANCE: The place was deserted on a Friday night. I was seriously worried that a Friday evening at 8pm was going to be a risky time to show up, but there was next to nobody there. By time we left, we were one of two tables and a couple people at the bar. 
* SERVICE: Servers can be nice and still not give great service. Given the lack of customers, it was off putting that it took nearly 35 minutes for three dishes, one of which was oysters. Even more so that our bill took about 20 minutes to process. 
* FOOD: We got the oysters: GREAT; Duck fried rice: Little undercooked, the rice was crunchy and the duck as cooked quickly or it was old; Thai Sausages: great flavor, but the grind wasn't free of bone fragments. Definitely food quality issues.


Lastly, I'm very sad that Chada has lost their direction and way. This was a favorite of mine and a standout amongst so many places in Chinatown. I won't be going back to Chada Street but will give Chada Thai another chance. Hopefully the original Chada can bring the food and service standards back up to the level that made me fall in love with them in the first place.",3EPBhYWMcglaqhJYgcofHg,2,0,2,SdaTliO7H9qlQJtawBuHfA

This place has a super cool ambiance, and the website photos do not do it justice. They have a hip lounge and bar area with a great beer and drink selection. The other side of the restaurant showcases a beautiful wine cellar with an impressive selection of high end wines. The best part of the ambiance is the music which sets a very comfortable and cool vibe.

The service was impressive on all counts.  We interacted with two different wait staff members who were both equally impressive. I spilled my tea and they appeared to clean up the spill before I could blink. 

But let's be serious, the food is the main reason I give 5 stars and it is fairly priced. We started with their hot pot soup which was served in am impressive volcano fashion. We also had the crab fried rice and shrimp drunken noodles. The crab fried rice was the best I have had at any restaurant. Large chunks of crab on top of perfect greasy fried rice. Bomb! The shrimp drunken noodles came with 5 huge jumbo shrimp and the sauce was amazing! Amazing value for $10. Everything is cooked fresh to order at a spice level from novice to ultimate badass.

Chada Street also had a private dining room for private parties. I will recommend to alkyl of my friends and will be back soon!  Woot!",-go-R_jzvYLYngQbfKN4_A,4,3,5,e23ERiaIxlRpRf4MWgDzKg

The place looked decent for a restaurant in China Town, but  I think it was pricey for the quality of food. I love Tom Yum soup so, I ordered a bowl of Tom Yum soup here. I requested to skip the coconut milk as I do not like milky soup (otherwise, I would have ordered Tom Kha instead). The soup didn't come with rice or noodle which cost extra. I ordered a side of noodles which was $3, and $3 would be enough to feed an army rather than a tiny plate I got here. Let's get back to the soup, itself. The only thing was good about the soup was the sour taste. (Well, hello! It wouldn't have been Tom Yum soup if it wasn't sour, right? Haha) Anyhow, the shrimps were frozen shrimps & not fresh like at other Thai restaurants I had dined in at. So, that was a deal breaker! The mushrooms didn't have that blended tastes, they were *raw* & plain of you know what I mean. The customer service was not impressive either. The noodles was so tiny and I wasn't provided chop sticks. It took them a million years to check on our table before I could ask for the chopsticks. Trust me, I am an expert at using forks which were just too bold for this type of skinny, slippery and fragile noodles.
I was glad I stopped by and tried this place out knowing I wouldn't come back as I walked out of this restaurant. Everyone has different taste, but this place wasn't for me.",yfOThLCMhjoCn3AD8VmHoQ,1,0,2,sBnt-2vteStTDmJrzbIy1Q

TUA SA MUN PRAI (peanuts) $3 VERY GOOD!  I would come back to have this peanuts had fried garlic chips. 

 STREET PAD THAI $7, Boring and forgettable Like another pad Thai you can get any ware.

VEGGIE ROLL W/PORK $6 B this was boring and that meat I it tasted like bland deli turkey meat.  The sauce that came with it tasted like it was made with Tang powdered juice drink.

 KOI NUA (Raw Steak) This dish is the main reason why I did not give a one star review. It was $17 but worth every penny. One of the best rare preparations I have eaten in a long time. I will be back just to eat this dish.

STICKEY RICE- I don't know how this was because they were OUT.  It is pretty bad when you are a Thai place and ""run out"" of sticky rice. We were ready to just walk out at this point. 

MOO MA NOW- Pork with lime. This was decent had some good flavors. 

 SAI OUA- Spicy sausage- This was decent and had some good spice, it came with a bunch of unneeded garnishes like raw red onion and raw whole garlic cloves.

FRIED CALIMARI- Boring and forgettable like another calamari you can get anyplace 

Overall it was trying to be like POK POK in a lot of ways and missed the mark. If it wasn't for the raw beef dish and Peanuts I probably would never bother going back.  The service was okay we had to ask for napkins and chopsticks and when we asked for more lettuce to eat with our dishes she brought cabbage. She forgot to put in one of the dishes we ordered. The owner walked around and lorded over everyone and did not bother to come over to talk to us about not having sticky rice. Our drink cups were never empty and they were attentive. I did see people wait at the front of the restraint for a few minutes before being given a table (no hostess). I will be back hopefully it was only new restraint hiccups because this place has the potential to be good. $65 with tip.",s7gMQwX2zansoCEXzvulvQ,1,0,2,lv0gQMO_WF5mXwMmqMQJNw

5750995,2017-02-18,5,inuW6Gl02Mf8G5RRk39_lw,"This restaurant will probably close in the near future. Unfortunately, the former Chef and cooks from both Chada Street and Chada Thai & Wine have departed, and it's not hard to see why. All employees encountered had terrible attitudes. The servers were too busy talking amongst themselves to check to make sure we were happy with our food--we were NOT. 

In fact, we were the only table in the restaurant aside from a gentleman dining solo, and out of FOUR servers, I finally had to interrupt one to send the horrible dish my dining companion ordered back. Then, after another 10+ minutes, we had to flag down the manager and explain everything again, only to be told ""you ate the whole dish, what do you expect me to do?"". You have got to be shitting me!!! My guy took one bite of the sinewy pork and was throughly displeased; thus, he did not eat the dish, he barely made a tiny dent with the one bite he did eat. Mind you, this was AFTER what he ordered was totally discouraged by the manager (salmon fried rice). If she needed to change his order by telling him what he was getting would have been bad, she should have at least picked a dish with some merit. 

Anyway, I would also like to mention that my food was definitely not great, but I was hungry enough to eat it anyway after adding lime juice, sambal, and dried chilis. I explained this to the manager 3x, and she replied with ""well, how was your laab today?"" (insert eye roll). I clearly articulated how the dish was nothing like what I had previously and that it was not great. I also explained the blatant rudeness from the servers and the manager really didn't seem to care. I told her that after hating our food and the experience, I really didn't want to pay for anything other than drinks since we would have to go to another restaurant and have dinner now. She argued with me and even charged for a cup of rice. Basically, we paid $36 for a glass of wine, a beer, and a cup of rice--oh and attitude, how could I forget!! 

Because this review is already lengthy, I will refrain from the remainder of my gripes and simply tell you to save your time and money. I can totally see why this restaurant was EMPTY on a Friday night in China Town. I am truly disappointed that Bank is no longer with Chada at all--it definitely shows.

Looking back at all the food our group of seven was able to try, there were a couple of standouts but for the most part most of the dishes were just incredibly solid. 

We started our meal with the blue pea limenade which was refreshing and a fun novelty with the color-changing aspect of the drink. I highly recommend starting with this if you visit. My favorite dishes from the meal were the crab fried rice, northern style sausage, crab curry and the larb. The sausage was exceptional as it was incredibly spicy and flavorful. The crab curry had excellent flavor although it didn't come with many noodles to absorb all the sauce, so I'd recommend ordering extra or a side of rice to assist. I don't typically enjoy ground meat, but since we had all heard great things about Chada's larb, I admit I did really enjoy the flavors. 

We ordered a number of desserts as well and although they serve two different versions of one of my favorite desserts, my favorite was the warm bread cubes with pandan custard. We all noted it's resemblance to ectolasm, but it was tasty and unique. 

The rest of the dishes were all good, but didn't leave as memorable an impression on me. Service was friendly albeit a little forgetful. The pacing of the dishes was a little quicker than we would have preferred and actually had to ask the server to slow down the dishes to allow us time to eat the first rounds before the next arrived.
