I had #45, the tofu version.  Something about the sauce plus the cilantro plus the perfect french bread unified to rule my universe like a gakked-up unicorn with a laser horn.  I had a coconut drink to wash it down, you know, the coconut with the lobotomy hole in the top, and a spoon to scrape out the white brains.  So back to the bread.  Let me tell you how perfect it was.  I went to the Mr Sammich bathroom facility (clean, totally ok).  I walked in 3 circles, doubled over with headache pain, and resurrected half the #45.  What a waste of a tasty sammich.  Before you get all grossed out and close this browser tab, let me say this: ""the bread was just as awesome on the way out"".  I'm not a regular puker, so don't think I have experience tasting food twice.  I don't.  But that doesn't change the fact that I noticed how tasty it was, twice.

Definitely better than Lee's. I also ordered their cafe sua da. It was a bit too thick.

I think its way better than Lee's sandwiches, but i've never liked Lee's quality of sandwiches to begin with.  I would get it again but first, I would want to try other flavors.

I have also had the banh cuon combination with fish sauce which is $7.99 and super filling.  I have also had the banh cuon meat and mushroom for the same price but it was much smaller and didn't come with the fried sweet potato.  I would say to stick with ordering the combination since you get more bang for your buck.

Even though prices aren't super cheap, the food is pretty authentic and the flavor is good.  this place isn't crowded all the times i've been there and it's pretty spacious so you can eat your food in peace.

I called and spoke to the person who took my order (I think he runs the place since he is always there) and told him that I got TWO tofu sandwiches instead of the veggie chicken and veggie pork. He responded and told me that they ran out of the veggie pork and veggie chicken and so they used plain tofu instead. First of all, if you ran out of the veggie meats, then you SHOULD have TOLD me and I would have NOT ordered (I don't like their tofu sandwich) at all.

Food:
Banh mi stale and bland. Ingredients not fresh. Boba is instant. Did they pull the food out of their ass not the kitchen? 

Service: 
I ordered three large boba, but they gave me three small. Instead of giving me more, they put it in a larger cup and filled it with ice. When I told them I saw them fill it with more ice they told me ""we could throw it away for you if you like"" when I barely took two sips. 

RUDE. RUDE. RUDE. Attitude problems. 

Like what other reviews state, 5 workers and only one of them is working. The other four were sitting at the table and telling jokes and gossiping...Waited probably half an hour for the food. Seriously? This isn't a gourmet meal, you're putting together a sandwich.

Took a few minutes for a waitress to bring menus for us to look at. Each table has a newspaper clip by a food critic talking about the restaurant. 

When we finally got to see the menus, they had a variety of Banh Mi combinations as well as a ""secret menu"" that we had overheard from another table which included some noodle soups i believe. He had ordered a roasted pork banh mi and i had tried their special banh mi. Size is average (nowadays...) give or take about 8"" cut in half. Amount of ingredients used is decent.

We ordered the following:

#37 Charbroiled Chicken $3.24
#44 Grilled Pork $3.24 (5 of these)
Banh Bao $1.85 steamed bun with pork & Chinese sausage - this was yummy!
2 basket of fries $1.99 - the fries were great!
Thai Iced Tea with Boba
2 sodas

All the sandwiches were tasty. Since we're not a fan of cilantro, we ordered them without cilantro. We loved the sandwiches with the spicy chili sauce in them. Next time, we'll ask them to toast the bread. Also, we would have preferred to have a little more meat in the sandwiches. We could have asked for extra meat.

I thought of getting dim sum with them, but didn't think my 5 year old and 3 year old would be much interested it it.  My husband wanted us to bring him lunch and I figured fried chicken from Church's might be okay.  As i was driving down Spring Mountain, I thought to myself, ""There are so many better things than Church's fried chicken on this road.""  I decided Mr. Sandwich would be the choice for lunch.

I have been to Mr. Sandwich a couple times before, so the menu was familiar to me.  I got the #38 which is assorted seafood, I ordered a #42 for the boys, Chinese meatball, and my for my husband, a #36, charbroiled beef.  The assorted seafood consists of fried fish and shrimp plus your normal Bahn Mi toppings.  The other 2 sandwiches I ordered are self explanatory.  

The sandwiches were great, as usual.  The bread had a slight crunch on the outside, but nice and soft on the inside.  The amount of toppings was just right to give the sandwich the perfect flavors.  The fish and shrimp in my sandwich were nicely fried, not overcooked at all.  The meatballs in the boys' sandwich were tender and full of flavor.  My husband liked his sandwich and had no complaints, so I think the beef must have been cooked to his liking.  

I would recommend Mr. Sandwich overall.  The only thing about it is that the service is inconsistent.  I've had great service there and then mediocre service.  The service wasn't bad, just not good.

However, after my latest experience here, I felt the need to share. 

I do enjoy a good bahn mi. I think they're a genius invention. I've been to Mr. Sandwich's a few times in the past and their banh mis are pretty good and I think they're great for lunch or even for a snack. However, I don't think I'll ever go back simply because the service there is horrid (and they're sister store - Hue Thai - is closer anyways). Now I know what you're thinking...trying to find a good Asian restaurant (outside of hotels and The Strip) with great service is basically impossible and nonexistent. But I've never had an experience like today's. 

I went there with my mom to order for take-out and I added an order of almond boba tea. When I got my boba I knew it was the wrong order because it tasted like regular milk tea and the color was darker than what normally an almond milk tea would be. I went up to the cashier and told her that there must've been a mix up in the drink, in which she proceeded to argue with me. She replied, in a very annoyed manner, that I didn't order the almond milk tea, but that I ordered the regular milk tea. She kept insisting that I ordered the reg. milk tea. Who does that?!? Look, woman, I know my almond milk tea and what I received was definitely not my almond milk tea! She was definitely annoyed and pissed, and it was evident when she brought out the sandwiches and my correctly-ordered boba in which she just plopped it on the table and left without saying thanks or anything else.

YUM YUM, was it good!  Mindblowing, no, but satisfying, yes.  At this point I've been there ten or twelve times and while the level of service and the portions of meat in my sandwich has varied, it's been relatively consistent.  

Virtually everything on the menu (with the exception of the ""secret menu"" which is noodle soups), is french baguette meets some Vietnamese meat and lightly pickled veggies.  I really do not like greasy or heavily fried things, so a number of ""pork this"" and ""fried that"" were out.  My staple there is the Chinese Meat Loaf sandwich which is delicious without the ""So yummy but man, I feel gross for eating this."" The crunch of the bread with the slight bitter taste of the veggies meets the hot num-num-num of the meat loaf is awesome.  My portion of meat, however, varies depending on who is ringing me up.  

I tried one of the veggie wraps with peanut sauce and it was okay.  Wasn't super impressed, but it was okay if it was lunch in a hurry.  

I always get the iced coffee drink.  They have some bubble tea and such.  Decent enough.

Interestingly enough, I hear the same songs (light, clean Hip Hop music) from the television every time I go.  But it's okay, that's how I discovered Janelle Monae.

Definitely something wrong with this picture.

We ordered 2 sandwiches and pork chop rice (com suon nuong - #71). She said they don't sell pork chop. We had to show her the menu and she still looked confused.

She realized that they did sell pork chop rice and rang us up. I looked at the receipt and she charged us for 2 sandwiches and a Thai BBQ.

We quickly brought it to her attention. 
She argued that it was the same thing at first. Then she said she had to charge us more than what the menu stated because they changed their menu. Therefore, she charged us for a more expensive item but will still give us our pork chop rice. Already frustrated, we were not in the mood to continuing arguing with this incompetent woman.

The most important reason for the lack of stars is the disappointment in food.
Both sandwiches combined were equivalent to one sandwich from Lee's. It was so small that I could finish the entire sandwich in 3 bites (Slightly exaggerated). In addition to the size, the sandwich was bland and lacked pate.

In conclusion, if you're craving a Vietnamese sandwich (banh mi) in Vegas, just go to Lee's.....",DyQpYGALYV-WmKfb5rThGw,3,1,1,68u8y7_4A_kO6IvcCSIOWg

Ordered:
 Charbroiled Pork Sandwich
 Honeydew Milk Tea with Boba

Pros:
* Delicious Sandwiches !
* Quick Service
* they sell Boba too !

Cons:
* limited flavors on their Boba
* service is subpar

Tips:
* if you have a group of 6... you can order 5 sandwiches and get 1 free!
* If you do not want to wait in a long line at Lee's Sandwich, come here.
* try my favorite... Charbroiled Pork!
* they also have homemade goods for sale!

  Okay for starters, I've been here numerous times.  I finally decided to review them after my last trip.  I came here to pick up a sandwich with my girlfriend before an INCREDIBLY fun Yelp event at the Artisan (Go Misti !!)
We each ordered a Charbroiled Pork Sandwich and shared the Honeydew Milk Tea.  In comparison to Huey Thai's and Lee's, I must say this is my favorite place for sandwiches.  Mr. Sandwich has the softest bread of the bunch and the flavor of the meat was so tasty! As mentioned above, the service wasn't phenomenal, but this isn't a place I go to for service.

after being quite upset that Lee's Sandwiches across the street here (a vietnamese sandwich place of high recognition in California that i LOVE) was not crackin' with their hard ass bread and cold ass meat, I've come here a few times with my boyfriend. 

the verdict?

NOM-TASTIC! the bread was fresh and warm and soft, and the meat is flavorful and not dry like some other places. I usually get the #35 charbroiled pork sandwich and even though i've tried the charbroiled chicken and beef, pork is still my fave. In addition to the taste, the service is not bad and the food came pretty quickly. The prices for everything (drinks to snacks to sandwiches) are also a little cheaper in general so I ain't complaining there! You must be crazy to pass up $3.24 for a fresh sandwich that leaves you feeling pretty content. It's never too busy and I actually like that because especially since asian restaurants in general tend to have shitty service, here they can focus more on you. The place is also pretty clean. This restaurant is typically good for brunch or lunch, or if you're in the mood for something on the lighter side.

I haven't tried anything other than sandwiches but I def plan to soon. Unlike some other sandwich places, they also have a full-blown menu with pho and plates. I plan to update my review as soon as I do :)",hKF3awJUBQtrKWzWZ_9PDA,3,1,5,qQ7KskwsBVnQea1TT3lltA

The first Vietnamese sandwich I ever had was from Lee's and I was surprised at how hard the bread was. I guess since it was my first time, I just assumed that's how Vietnamese sandwiches were suppose to be. Until I met Mr. Sandwich...

I met Don here for lunch. Since I've never been here before, I told him to order me anything, so he got me a Charbroiled Pork Sandwich and iced Vietnamese Coffee. When you order to eat inside, the sandwiches come out in a little basket. Just by looking at it, I could tell the bread wasn't like Lee's at all (flaky and dry). I picked it up and immediately felt the softness. When I took my first bite, I just thought to myself ""Flavorful, soft breaded Vietnamese sandwich...where have you been all my life?"" The bread was soft inside and out and the charbroiled pork mixed with the veggies they put inside was surprisingly tasty. I say ""surprisingly"" because, if you've never had a Vietnamese sandwich before, the sandwich might look overly healthy and boring, but when you take a bite it's like a harmony of flavors. If I had to compare the bread here with the bread at Lee's, it kind of reminds of of when I go to Vons and they have the French bread sold in paper bags with a big opening at the end and also in plastic bags that are sealed. The paper bagged ones look delicious and they're soft in the store, but after a day in your kitchen it turns rock hard, whereas the plastic bagged ones stay soft all the time. Lee's is the rock hard bread and Mr. Sandwich is the soft and delicious bread. 

My Vietnamese coffee was AMAZING. I don't normally like when cream and sweetener is already added to my coffee, but they totally nailed it here. It wasn't overly sweet and it had the perfect amount of milk. It also had just the right amount of caffeine to get me through the day without feeling like a crackhead (I'm pretty sensitive to caffeine).

What your tongue first meets is the bread, and that first impression better sweeps off your feet.  Okay, maybe not your feet, but my feet, since I've been eating Banh Mi's at least weekly for the last thirty years of my life.

So the bread at Mr. Sandwich is decent, nothing for me to fall heads over heels.  It's all a bit too soft, not crusty enough.  However the contents are delicious.  The combination (Dac Biet) gives you quite a bit of cold cuts and their accompanying pickled cabbage and carrots are cut of thicker size, which is how I prefer it.  They also offer the omelet (Op La) which is the egg banh mi, not offered in most places (Hue Thai is the only other place I've had it in Vegas).

Prices are average, I've seen less and more expensive in Vegas.  So for their sake, I hope they improve the quality on their baguette before Lee's Sandwich opens up down the road.",Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA,4,2,3,Cv16LiVThYQzRqNg8Jnoqg

Things to be aware of: this is chicken, as in I picked out bones. This is not the  'white breast meat only processed meat' that you will get at other places. There is no menu listing out each ingrediant in each sandwhich, although the people were so nice I think they would have answered every stupid question we had.

While browsing this area I walked into Mr. Sandwich French-Vietnamese Cafe for something edible and partake on a sandwich! I haven't had one in some time. 

This cafe is small but with contemporary wood decor, like a little hip French bistro. The menu is posted in a large lighted box outside the cafe glass wall, complete with photos of the sandwiches, specialty rolls, special iced or shaved ice drinks, coffee, various appetizers, house special dishes, and vegetarian sandwiches. All offered, amazing affordability...awesome! Sandwiches are $3.49. Clean cafe. Fast service. Cordial waitstaff and cashier. Cool, hip crowd and customers. Hip-hop msic plays from their stereo. The cafe has a little store of candies and assorted beverages if you prefer to satisfy your thirst and for a sweets treat.

Questions about my ordered sandwich and special drink were answered with a smile by my food server. I treat my body like it is a temple, so I asked beforehand what is in what I eat before I ingest because, I have a tendency to ""vaccum and inhale"" edibility. The ""Assorted Seafood"" Sandwich I ordered arrived my table warm and in crispy French bread made with fish cakes, shrimps,pickled carrots and pickled daikon with jalapeno green pepper. It was laid out on a basket. It tasted just like I have tasted before in one of New York's neighborhood restaurant where I lived before while in college. Truly French and Vietnamese style! The ""Thai Passion Special Drink""  in a glass was filled with shaved ice, coconut milk, lychees, jackfruit, green and red jello and round palm fruit jelly. ""Thai Passion Special Drink"" is made with half-and-half milk but I asked for coconut milk with it, my request was granted... it was even a better tasting, cool, nice, slurpee of a cold drink! Oh passion, Oh love...I felt the love! (omg, see photo...not realizing till I saw photo, coincidentally isn't it the lychee fruit imbues love?)

The bread wasn't crusty at all like a nice French bread should be. The pork wasn't charred either. It looked like it was boiled. I did like how the put big pieces of vegetables inside the sandwich. It gave nice texture to the sandwich. They also put a good amount of mayo which most places don't.,8kC0JZq9sKpWjMewWjpx-A,0,0,3,s9dyki5nrA42_uoVQuh2Wg

I love 'mi' a good Vietnamese sandwich.  The blending of influences from French and Asian cooking cultures have created the love child that is now one of the ultimates palette busters, BAHN MI!  A really good one can send flavor explosions through your senses like you wouldn't believe.  A simple sandwich, imagine, can create the most complex notes on your tastebuds!  By far one of my favorite types of sandwiches to have, next to a grilled cheese on buttered plain white bread with two slices of Kraft singles and pickles (oh the nostalgia).

Mr. Sandwich makes a decent bahn mi.  It's not my favorite, but it fits the bill when I'm in Chinatown doing some grocery shopping and I have the brood with me.  I can feed a family of four for little money.  At $3.50 each plus tax it's a pretty good bargain (though yes I know it's much cheaper in Cali).  Don't forget their 'Special'...Buy 5 bahn mi, get 1 FREE!  I know the math is off, but I usually eat two of them on my own or we just take the leftovers for lunch the next day.

Taste wise Mr. Sandwich makes a good bahn mi when everything is FRESH.  I stress FRESH.  Crappy stale French bread, sitting meat, and wilted veggies do not make a good bahn mi.  That crisp along with the cold cuts or grilled meats is what makes a bahn mi so special.  When the French bread is made earlier in the day and it's crusty on the outside (not hard) and a bit chewy on the inside, you're in for a good bahn mi.  As long as they don't screw up your toppings!

My family loves the Mr. Sandwich #31 House Special, which for those of you who are new to bahn mi, involves some sort of liver pate, head cheese, and pork loaf.  Yes, if you're not into liver or those tasty bits of meat and cartilege from the head of a pig the House Special is some adventurous eating.  But give it a whirl, it's not as stinky tasting as you think!  The combination of French bread loaded with the cold cuts, crisp veggies like cucumber, daikon, carrots, cilantro, and jalapeno, and the sauce of mayo, hoisin, and for me hot sauce...is heavenly.  Like a dance on your tongue!  Tis' tasty is what I'm looking for.

I also enjoy the #35 which is their charbroiled pork bahn mi.  Delicious as well.  I always ask for a side of extra veggies to go with my sandwiches.  I kind of like mine loaded with colors.  My only gripe is that sometimes Mr. Sandwich does skimp on the meat a bit and you can end up with more of a vegetarian bahn mi than anything.  I also wish the sandwiches here were a bit bigger, other places around Chinatown that serve bahn mi have longer French bread.  Do yourself a favor though, don't wait too long to eat your bahn mi!  The French bread can get a bit too hard on the outside, and the fillings can make the inside overly soggy.  A bit of a no-no.

Mr. Sandwich also has other appetizer items on the menu as well as boba and milk drinks.  This place was made for sobering up after a night of dancing like PSY and drinking copious amounts of soju!  I also suggest you try the fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce, and the fried egg rolls (so good wrapped in lettuce and dipped in sauce).  

The interior of Mr. Sandwich has lots of seating and is pretty clean.  Although you will notice that a lot of the patrons there actually take their bahn mi TO GO.  So expect a lot of in-and-out foot traffic.  The service is OK, but don't expect to be doted on.  Things can get very busy especially around lunch time, so your cashier may just take your order then disappear again until your order is ready.  The workers there move fast since they usually do orders of six or more sandwiches at a time.  Talk about lunch rush!

Bread was inconsistent previous visit with the usual crisp on the outside, pillowy soft on the inside. Last sandwich was all soft. Pickled daikon and carrots, cilantro, jalapeno.

After playing scavenger hunt with the menu, I decided to go with a spring roll to complement my charbroiled pork sandwich. Both were very delicious and light, yet made for a great lunch.

Prices were very reasonable.  Service was quick and friendly. Spring rolls were refreshing. After devouring the sandwich, I can safely say that it's some of the better bahn mi that I've had in Vegas.

Plus, even though I did not use this service, they also offered free wireless internet which was boldly written on their window. 

We ordered two #37 Chicken Banh Mi (Vietnamese Sandwiches) without jalepenos. They were very crispy and delicious and less than $4.00 (Approximately $3.69). They also had other sandwiches, appetizers, and traditional Vietnamese desserts, shrimp/spring rolls, etc. They were nicely packaged and available near the checkout counter. We also picked up a green tapoica and bean dessert patty (came in a pack of 2- about $2.50). Both the sandwich and the green dessert was quite good, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. 

I noticed that the place is filled with locals and many were just surfing the web, having their Vietnamese coffee, and eating a sandwich. After we left, we noticed that there was a Buy 5, Get 1 Sandwich free sign. We ended up getting a few more to get the 6th sandwich free.

Definitely come here if you are in Vegas' Chinatown. This place is in the Ranch 99 shopping lot with many restaurants, several bubble tea places, and several bakeries . 

Location: It's right off of Exit 39-Spring Mountain Road and about 5 minutes from the strip (more like 6-8 factoring traffic and getting across to the other side of the freeway).

I went there for their soft launch, which means they really only had a few items like the pork, beef, and special sandwich. I got the special sandwich, which like before had the same spiciness as the one at Hue Thai.

No. 33 - Vietnamese Pork Loaf and Pate - Very tasty. The sandwiches with the pate are very nice. 

No 35 - Charbroiled Pork - Smooth and tender. Would order again.

No 44 - Grilled Pork - Kids liked this alot.

No 34 - Beef Brisket - High recommendation from the people working there, however, I found the brisket to be very, very tough with the tough chewy bits, so I did not care for this so much. 

No. 31 - House Special - I have no clue what was in this sandwich, but it was flavorful.

No 38 - Assorted Seafood - Yeah baby.

4.  Bread - All Sandwiches have a bunch of the vegetables and spices that make the taste so unique.  The bread is all french baguette style and it imparts a very nice taste and texture.

5.  Resistance - I was in strong resistance for a very many years to try these sandwiches. I saw them all over the place and just ignored them, like I do Boba drinks. They were not in my radar.  However, now that I have tried it, it is very, very good.

6.  Service - I am quite a rookie at this so I asked a lot of questions and found the service here to be fine. They in fact told me that if I ordered 5 sandwiches, I get on free, that was cool and overall, they seemed to be pleasant. I was there like at 3:00 pm, so it was not the busiest time.

They seem to also sell other things here and some of it looks good like they made it  and some of it looks like they just bought a big pack of stuff from Costco ans selling the individual packs.

The bread just wasn't crispy when I got it.
The pork was juicy but didn't have any charbroiled/grilled taste to it, at all.
They put a TON of mayo-y stuff on it that just really didn't do it for me
And when i first bit into the sandwich and then subsequently looked inside it I wasn't sure there was any meat in it at all.

I know the sandwich is only like $3.50 but bread is cheap to make.  You shouldn't serve anything on stale bread.
That being said, it's usually very good.  The veggies are pickled perfectly and along with the sauce you get that nice sweet and pickly taste you expect from a top notch banh mi.
I wouldn't go there expecting much service.  We had a group of around 10 people and they botched our order, didn't deliver any sodas, and basically were clueless when it came to service.  But whatever, $3.50 for a nice sandwich!  How can you complain.

The Viet style baguette was fresh, appropriately crusty with a light, airy center.  I don't know if they make their own bread, but it was a good canvas on which to apply the meat.  The baguette was filled with a reasonable amount of savory, tender pork and topped with expected pickled daikon and carrots and cilantro.  For $3.49, it was a veritable bargain!

We both got the tofu bahn mi and it was really good. Somehow the tofu almost tasted like egg and the bread here is perfectly crunchy and buttery outside and soft inside. 

We also shared tofu spring rolls which were recent and I appreciated they offered a tofu option on it. 

Just a note, its pretty quiet, has cheap good food and boba drinks and free wi-fi so I think this would be a good spot to consider for studying or getting some work done.

5100269,2012-06-04,2,UvF68aNDfzCWQbxO6-647g,"BANH MI BATTLE: HUE THAI vs MR. SANDWICH

Mr. Sandwich is the satellite restaurant to Hue Thai. Its a seemingly 'new'--but not really--banh mi place that's smack-dab in the middle of prime-time Chinatown. I am a lover of Hue Thai. But while they're sister restaurants, Mr. Sandwich knows his banh mi just a little bit better.

I was bored one day and worked up a big appetite. I decided to run a side-by-side comparison: Mr. Sandwich vs Hue Thai. It was the only way to really know who served up a better banh mi. I ordered a House Special or (bánh mì c bit) at both locations. While the veggie and meat comparison yielded the sandwiches as equals. The bread is why Mr. Sandwich cuisine reigned Supreme (ha). The Hue Thai baguette didn't compare to the buttery-deliciousness of Mr. Sandwich. And texturally, it was a little tough and a tad bit too crispy. 

I'm a die hard Dakao fan. But Mr. Sandwich is a few blocks closer to the strip and just  a few minutes off I-15. Every time I go, there's never a line and my order is served up quick and ready to-go. I'm never in there longer than 7 minutes. So Mr. Sandwich--essentially 'Hue Thai Express'--and his good and quick food has made his way into my regular quick-bite stops. 

CREDIT CARDS: SUPER+, they don't have a problem with me using my credit card on a $4 sandwich. 

**I also work the Phan Xiu Mai, or Viet meatballs, into my order. Just as good as Hue Thai, served with a better baguette.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,9,4,5,nNuzOSWWy7mcafheoPxIqQ

What separates these guys vs the others I have tried so far...the bread! The bread is much more soft and flavorful here! Easily the best bread I've had vs the other 3-4 places!

The filler is good, flavorful and tasty. I feel like the goodies inside aren't as good as Dakao for example, and I feel like I have a little less meat and goodies and spend a little more money in comparison, but the difference in the bread trumps those setbacks IMO!  

Boba is good here...a bit on the sweet end.  They probably add sugar and/or maybe use powder mixes, but still good!

Not too chewy, and easy to chomp on.  The fillings seemed homemade rather than a large vietnamese sandwich chain.  The sausage slice was thick, and complimented the perfectly grilled pork inside.

Last night, however, we were starving and driving aimlessly down Spring Mountain. In an act of semi-desperation, we decided to give Mr. Sandwich a whirl.

Sometimes hunger serves you well. I ordered up a tofu banh mi, and I was pleased with the results. The warm, soft bread really makes the sandwich sing sweet tunes to your taste buds. The tofu tasted fresh, and the vegetable fillings were solid with nice, long strips of cucumber. I will say that I couldn't tell if there were any jalapenos. Perhaps you need to ask for them? Perhaps there just wasn't enough. Either way, I appreciate a nice spicy kick on my banh mi, so next time, I would make sure to secure jalapenos.    

The atmosphere is casual. You order at the counter, and then, if they are playing the same tunes as last night, you sit down and listen to some foul-mouthed gangsta rap or maybe just some Lil' Jon. That was unexpected, but it made me laugh.

Located in the Chinatown Plaza off Spring Mountain Road toward the Strip in the Las Vegas Chinatown.

But it's the perfect late-afternoon spot and a good banh mi (perhaps accompanied by a black iced coffee, thai tea or an avocado shake!) is a really good hangover kick. LOVE that they always ask if you want the boba, because I don't like boba but if not prompted I often forget to request my drinks without them.

I don't have a good explanation for why.  I wasn't opposed to eating one.  Heck, I've even had and loved 4 or 5 Banh Mi burgers at Bachi Burger in my time without knowing anything about how I'd feel about the original sandwich it's based on.  Yeah, and here I am giving my first and only Banh Mi Sandwich 5 stars 33 years into my life.  I'm a complete and utter disgrace to my Elite status.

It all started last Thursday, when I needed to meet up with a friend for a small business transaction (I don't know how to not make it sound illegal), and was ready to suggest going to Ramen Sora because I've been dying to try it.  My friend suggested Mr. Sandwich and I reluctantly agreed.   I say reluctantly because in my mind it just didn't sound that appealing to me, but I'm a complete food pushover and will agree to eat anywhere someone suggests within reason without any pushback.   Within 5 minutes I was on my way and 10 minutes later I was looking at the giant board of options.

I quickly decided to go with the house special because it seemed like the most ""standard"" of options and I figured I should start there and then get more adventurous in future visits (hello Durian smoothie!)  I don't know why but I got a gatorade to drink.   Re-read my last sentence of the first paragraph.  Still applies.  Several minutes later my sandwich arrived and I was already impressed.  The ingredients looked fresh, the bread felt nice and soft yet with a slight crunch maintained.   I took a bite without any extra added sauce and really enjoyed the combination of flavors and textures the meat, bread and veggies provided (yes, I have had sandwiches before).   Then I started testing the sauce bottles that were present at our table and loved alternating between the hoisin and sriracha sauce because I'm a rebel like that.   

I also tried a sip of my friend's jack fruit smoothie and for the rest of my meal looked at my gatorade in shame and disgust.  Fortune favors the bold.

Oh yeah, it was about $4.50 for everything.   Stolen.   I will be back Mr Sandwich, get the Chinese Meatloaf and Durian smoothie ready for me.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,2,3,5,sNBrEPAoLVNWoHGFlAnFow

It was hard, not crunchy. Like it had been cut in half and left out for a long time. I was there for a late lunch, but still... 
Viet coffee was great though - strong, not too sweet, not a retarded amount of ice.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,1,0,3,vWAB03T-aptdpORUqVLw0Q

Located in the heart of Chinatown this is a cafe that serves 
the Bánh mì a French/ Vietnamese type of sandwich made up of thinly sliced pickled carrots and daikon, cucumbers, cilantro, chili peppers, pâté, mayonnaise and your choice of different meats. 
My favorite is #39 shredded chicken with no mayo and flushed with a
honeydew boba.  PLEASE NOTE : The waitresses are cute and speak little English they call Mayo .... butter.  So if they ask you if you want butter, they're actually asking you if you want  mayonnaise. 
I also met a few amazing ladies here who invited me to celebrate a birthday with them at Encore resort and casino.  We took a photo, I'll post later when I start my FaceBook account.  
Any way this place is great for groups, five sandwiches will get you one free without a coupon!",Ejh77c4EN3BWhnfL-f5TvQ,2,0,5,d13M69krZdeGRn_kZNglCA

I came at 755 am and waited in my car until the shop opened.  The worker who opened the restaurant (presumably the owner?) was parked right next to me and saw me waiting.  She got out of her car at exactly 8 and unlocked the front door then went in.  Immediately after, a man walked in and so I walked in right after him.  The man and the worker woman were speaking in Vietnamese so I didn't know what they were saying but they seemed like they knew each other.  After a few minutes she hands him an iced coffee and he leaves.  She then proceeds to move about the restaurant all the while ignoring me while I'm standing there wondering if I somehow became invisible.  I wait about another minute and then finally get her attention and ask if I can order something.  She gives me a blank look like she has seen me for the first time and says in a condescending tone..it'll be 10 minutes.  I've never experienced this kind of crap service anywhere.  Spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere!  Lee's in the mall across the street is open 24 hours and they're much more friendly there.",t1W29z3YQ-mf7Pi1jDbJHQ,0,0,1,O9ZLds2O_Z1CKuToe2YXmw

For sure not what I had planned when wanting to try a new spot for lunch today :(

My first and last visit I am sad to report Mr. Sandwich, you had one chance with me and you did not satisfy me so I shall continue my affair with Lee.

I tried their grilled pork bahn mi and two shrimp spring rolls. 

The bread was DRY with very little filling inside of the sandwich, where is the pork? Also no extra house mayo was added as I had requested.

The shrimp spring rolls were good and I enjoyed the sweet dipping sauce that came with them.

When my order was ready I asked for Sriracha and the guy handed me a tiny little plastic cup with lid and pointed to a dining table and said, ""you go get from table"". That was odd and not very friendly or the type of service I am used to elsewhere.

I won't be back however at least my curiosity is cured and I gave them a shot!

Totally disappointed :(

As a group we had the springrolls and eggrolls too and those were also good.

Banh Mi: They had a pretty decent list of various fillings but I wanted something more non-traditional, so I opted for the Chinese Meatloaf which was excellent.  (1st Day Visit)

Chicken Curry: Broth was very flavorful while the chicken with bone-in was cooked perfectly, topped off with fresh scallions and cilantro! This particular dish came with a fresh baguette!  Let me tell you, I savored this one! (2nd Day Visit)

Sugar Cane Drink: Delicious, not too sweet, just right! Besides this, you can order Bobas and other Asian Teas.

Besides food on the menu, you can order various Viet desserts and snacks.  If you know what I'm talking about, they are your typical colorful, coconut flavored ones.

The two sweet Viet ladies here were sweet, nothing major to complain about, order at their counter and they get right to business!  The establishment was very clean.

I would prefer Mr. Sandwich over Lee's for sure!",8DGFWco9VeBAxjqsuh1aSw,1,1,5,9u4PWdPiYx5s_MNwqoWN7Q

Everything is marked up (though still cheap for Vegas) as compared to California ($2.75 for THREE spring rolls in the 626, here is $4 for two). But hey, when you're desperate for some asian yummies and you aren't willing to shell out $8 for non-legit spring rolls on the strip, you gotta go somewhere, right? 

The desserts are pretty yummy...pandan-coconut milk-coffee jello is a bit too sweet. Coconut milk with taro, yam, and tapioca is super yum. Spring rolls are squishy...shrimp ones (goi cuon) is very squishy and mostly rice paper. The vegetarian spring rolls are insanely dry. And yet...I keep coming back :X Mostly for the desserts!",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,2,2,2,e7FSmnV5A9DxWxx1ppqU5A
5955409,2013-02-17,1,UvF68aNDfzCWQbxO6-647g,"Oh I love me some Banh Mi sandwiches. I ate there yesterday, my girlfriend and I got 3 different sandwiches. The seafood sandwich (#38) was by far the best thing we got. The combination of the fresh veggies, herbs and the fried fish, plus a great sauce equaled a great sandwich. The Chinese meatloaf (#42) was pretty darn tasty, perfect ratio of meat and refreshing ingredients. The house special (#31) was okay, but my least favorite of the three. The star of the show in the house special is the veggies.

A big bonus about this place is they have boba. Now I personally cant stand boba, but my girlfriend loves it. The coconut milk tea was pretty good. The only bad thing about Mr. Sandwich would probably be how cramped it can feel when they are busy.",udDk0WyB7z4RqnJdo-dUAg,1,0,4,Gp9tCoygGfqJ7SC3qo2NQA

I have tried many sandwiches I adore here, but the one that stole the show for me and my fella was the seafood banh mi. I was almost tempted to raise my review to a 5 star for that one alone. It was flavorful and delicious. What's not to love. I highly recommend this place. 

So delicious. Their drinks are pretty good as well and at a price a lot cheaper than most of their neighbors.

I want that crispy crackly exterior and warm, soft, fluffy interior.  Unfortunately, the sandwich I was given was neither.  Perhaps I received an old batch, I don't know.  I just know that the charbroiled pork, pickled veggies, and heat from the jalapenos were good, but the bread was just A-OK.  

I was pleasantly surprised to see that Mr. Sandwich offers more than sandwiches, such as spring rolls, pho, desserts, and boba drinks.  I  ordered a lychee slushi with lychee jelly, and although a bit sweet for my liking- it was cold and refreshing on that hot June day.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,2,0,3,Q9YoeRQjCqEL2U7ghMJ8xQ
