I was craving a croissant and thought if a French bakery doesn't have the best croissants, no one would.  I went around lunch time and there were only two others in the place.  The first thing I noticed was how super hot it was. Not sure if the a/c was off or what. The lady at the counter was very friendly and I'd give her all the stars in the world. After I ordered my ham and cheese croissant the lady came over to let me know that they didn't have any croissants. What?!?!  French bakery and no croissants.  Hmm...ok.  I ended up having the ham and cheese on the baguette.  It was pretty good.  The baguette was fresh and was a good alternative.  However, at this point I'm still head scratching as to why no croissants at noon on a weekday. The side salad was ok.  It had those little baby corns like Tom Hanks eats in the movie ""Big.""  I'm not a fan of the little corns but that's ok.  I opted out of having a dessert even though they looked good.  I was still hung up on the no croissant deal. I'm unsure if I want to try this place again.",ijn2OjqDLX3J4ZvwSbPXWQ,0,0,2,D4lvXIwQLWEniS-zm6riqg

I was greeted by a beautiful, vibrant woman named Elisa who greeted me in French (as she thought I was French) very sweet. She offered me some of the cakes they had as samples on the counter, I can't remember what they were...but oh they were so delightful!
I ordered a ham and cheese croissant that came with a salad; I asked for the pomegranate vinaigrette. I must say...WOW! I literally giggled after taking my first bite of the croissant! So perfectly crafted!
The vinaigrette was the perfect balance of bitter and sweet.  I ate practically ever crumb on my plate!
It was such a beautiful day, the sun shining into the shop put an extra layer of dazzle of the day. They play a beautiful mix of music which is very important to me!

3726593,2017-09-11,1,0G83H_zoum-Q4bWU2olTqQ,"One of my Facebook friends mentioned Bonjour Bakery & Deli so I bookmarked it last week.  Today I was in the neighborhood and decided to stop in.

Before I start there are two things you should know:
1. 3 weeks in Lyon, France more or less ruined me on French food in the United States.  Who knew something as simple as bread and butter could be so much better!
2. I stopped in about 2:30PM and didn't feel like hanging around so just got a couple of things To-Go.

I got the two things I remember being so common and so much better in France....  A chocolate croissant and a baguette.  The croissant didn't make it home and there are little flakes of it in my car.  (I never eat in my car!)  I mentioned the time of day because every time I had a croissant in France, it was in the morning.  It was a tiny bit less melt in your mouth than in France  but I'll bet that's only because it wasn't fresh out of the oven and still warm like the first batch of the day.  It was definitely best I've had in Vegas so far.  I haven't tried the bread yet but hopefully it's equally good.  (Note: I did confirm croissants are made with French butter... which is also better than typical American butter!)

The young woman was pleasant and helpful and as it turns out, actually from France...and of course tall, thin and beautiful.... life is so unfair!

The seating area is pretty small.  I didn't count the tables but maybe six??  They had quite a few savory items on the menu and a kitchen behind the counter which I didn't really look at since I was focused on the contents of the glass case.

I will be going back to try the French Burger because, yes, the best hamburger I ever had was also in France!",HK-TlD0yVA_tpTXZxfzu2w,7,4,5,F86SHImSeWrNysuCB_-RgQ

Now the sandwich was great, the bread was especially delicious, but I think the almond croissant (~$4) was the star of my meal. It's probably one of the best almond croissants I've ever had and I order those wherever I can find them. They make their own almond paste, import their butter from France, and get their flour from Europe. They make a point to bake their goods from scratch and the quality is obvious from how it tastes. Definitely going to order more of these in the future and maybe also try the almond chocolate croissant that they offer. As for the coffee, they use Lavazza coffee, which is a good, strong Italian coffee. I'm not an espresso person, but they offer espressos in single and double shot as well. 

The interior is clean and when you walk in, you immediately see the window of pastries and cakes directly ahead, fresh bread on the shelf, and a huge chalkboard menu showcasing their options for drinks, sandwiches, breakfasts, savory crepes, and more. There are about 5-6 tables inside and I think 2 tables outside (mostly see people choose the outside for smoking or because they have a dog). The service here was top notch and the two sisters who run it seem really passionate about the place. One of them is from Sweden and speaks five languages, which I thought was awesome. 

When Bonjour first opened under its original owners, I absolutely loved this place. Then there was a second owner and the quality seemed to go down while the prices went up. At a certain point, I stopped coming to Bonjour altogether. Thanks to Yelp I found out that Bonjour was yet again under new management, so I went to check it out. Now, the third/current owners (the two sisters mentioned above) are looking to put their own spin on the place while keeping a lot of the traditional French offerings without sacrificing quality. All in all, I'm glad Bonjour is back. It's a great place to grab a coffee and a meal/pastry. They're making some new breads too, some of which are very brioche-like.

Bonjour was a pleasant experience from the moment I enter this small bakery in the corner of a busy shopping plaza. Its been years I haven't been to this bakery because I had a few bad experience from the previous owners. However, the change in owners and staff made a big difference on this particular visit. Thanks to Renee N. for the recommendation that I should try them out again. Everything I had was delicious, especially the Ham & Cheese Croissant with a side salad. The croissant was soft in the inside and flakey on the outside overall it had a good texture to it. It wasn't overcooked. The ham and cheese were equally consistent and paired well with the croissant. The Pumpkin cake, was balanced in sweetness and not too bland. I would come back for this particular pastry. I got a chocolate and almond croissant to go and they were both up to par especially the almond croissant. I will return to try out more of the items offered at this unique bakery in the future.

FYI: The owner is a Korean lady from Sweden, who speaks multiple languages.

I wanted a place to pop in for a quick breakfast and a coffee while I got some work done. They are located in a big shopping center, so there is parking aplenty. I walked in to be greeted by a pastry case of the finest treats. They have a large chalkboard menu, and some of their more savory breakfast options include omelettes, croque monsieur, and a ham and cheese croissant. And fear not. They still make the famous almond croissant that I heard nearly every guest order while I sipped my almond milk latte.

This isn't the place where you're going to get fancy latte art, but I enjoyed the creaminess of the dairy alternative and the smooth flavor of their espresso. I devoured my ham and cheese croissant. They fly their butter in from France, and you can taste the difference as the flaky pastry dances across your tongue. The side salad that accompanied was a forest of vegetables with a champagne vinaigrette.

What really caught my eye was how warm and welcoming the staff and owner were to every guest. They were greeted with either a warm smile or a warm hug. You can tell that they are really trying to build a community and take pride in what they do. 

This was a little reminder and taste of my time in France, merci!",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,29,17,5,1lvhw9Hz6gk4IGYxZNL6kg
