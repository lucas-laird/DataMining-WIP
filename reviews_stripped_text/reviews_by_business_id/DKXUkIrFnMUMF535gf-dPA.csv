Cover that shizzznitttt with different hot sauces because that's as much flavor as you'll get. Either way super bummed considering the good reviews. I knew I should have walked out after I saw one whole section of nothing but dirty tables but I was already at the hangry stage so I sat my chunky butt down and ate it $30 for two people no thanks never again I'll stick to these fast food 4 for $4 you see all over the commercials.,UJrxRDK1OhisCqM0VdGUCQ,0,0,2,ipLvYwkeDXhn_oN2hwpmLw

The taco had tomato, guacamole and cheese and two tortillas. The tacos are grilled so the tortilla is a bit crispy. The meat was seasoned with salt and had a simple delicious flavor. Now let's talk about the rice and beans. This is a staple in most Mexican restaurants. I am quite picky because my Mom has delighted me with savory rice and well-cooked beans my whole life. I am usually prepared to be disappointed with most restaurants. Well the rice was flavorful and the beans were delicious. These are not the beans from a can that are dark and whipped topped with shredded cheese. These looked like peruano beans. They were perfectly seasoned and were creamy but not completely smashed. Reminded me of home. I also ordered an agua de limon which was perfectly refreshing. The only thing that did not blow my socks off were the salsas. It may be a matter of preference though. I don't like cumin in my salsa and I could detect it in both the red and green salsas.

My only reason for lower stars is the personality of the girl working the register. She has no personality. After finding out about the restaurant by being a subscriber of Arturo's YouTube account I was expecting someone fun and outgoing. 

During our first visit we loved the salsa and wanted to see if they sold a bigger side to go. She gave us small ones with no real dialogue of if larger ones were offered. On our second visit we saw a Fresca, but weren't sure what kind it was and it looked really good! When we asked her what it was she looked at us, looked at the drink as it went by to be delivered and didn't respond.

I got a lengua burrito. Its came out hot and slightly crisp. Inside was guac, pico de gillo, lengua, sour cream, cheese, and white/pinto bean. Overall, I liked the lengua, tortilla, and pico; those components were great. The burrito just didn't come together for me. Too much sour cream/cheese in some bites.

At Frijoles & Frescas you place your order and pay at the counter, the food is made then delivered to your table. You get your own fountain drink and utensils. 

The nachos have steak strips, tomatoes, beans, guacamole, sour cream, and jalapeños. This is well worth the money. I followed this with a taco, which had a double soft shell. The taco was priced at $4.50 for just the one taco. I had been informed it was a super large taco for that price - but, it wasn't.

1827296,2017-05-06,0,DKXUkIrFnMUMF535gf-dPA,"YUM.... TOO DELICIOUS! This spot is by our house, and has become our favorite go-to for awesome authentic Mexican food. They have a smaller menu then most Mexican spots in town (no tamales, enchiladas, etc;), but really hone in on serving deliciously seasoned and well prepared meats. 

The location is very clean and perfect for a quick bite, but we typically order the food to-go. They also carry fresh fruit juices called aguas frescas; my favorite flavor is the Jamaican, which mimics a hibiscus.  

We adore their mini tacos, which come served with onions and cilantro. They have a wide selection of meats including: carne asada, pollo, carnitas, al pastor, camaron, pescado, lengua, cabeza, and also vegetarian. The carne asada, carnitas, and al pastor are our favorites.

 We also really enjoy their platter plate, which serves the meat (I get carne asada) as a fuller portion, with rice,beans, avocado, and a salad as added sides. We love to get extra flour tortilla with this and basically make custom fajitas. They have awesome sour cream to add as a side, and a great green cilantro sauce with the salad.

 The al pastor quesadilla is also a favorite of ours, with chips & guacamole always being a must-have. The street corn is phenomenal, and I always ask for light sauce extra cheese. They also have fantastic salsa, and also amazing green/red sauces (spicy!)

I have not had anything I would not recommend here, but have not yet ventured to try their cabeza meat, or fish & shrimp entrees. Soon I will try their ceviche as I have heard good things. Everything is extremely fresh, and made homemade. You can tell the food is authentic and their is love within the preparation.

Our to-go orders have always been done efficiently, accurately, and packaged for easy travel. I would recommend this place to anyone, and can't wait to go back myself. Both lucky, and cursed this is by our house!

My GF ordered just pepino but they had endless flavors including the following : horchata, Jamaica, Fresa, espinacas, and chia. We both ended up ordering the Mexican salad with pollo. The salad had Mexican style rice and pinto beans, we both eat healthy and the only downside with that is, I wish they offered brown rice and black beans but any- who, it had lettuce tomatoes and a tomatillo dressing. It was good :) then we both shared the Mexican street corn, it was good but not as great as you would get it from the Elote man.. Just saying ... The tables were clean.

You get  FULL, HEARTY burrito, and take first bite see loading with beans, avocado, and lot of stuff in it. My con is not much flavor in it.

The chips taste super fresh and nice crispy right out of the fryer. The salsa love it!!!!!! It not your water down or salsa salsa. It more refreshing salsa lots lots of diced tomato, onion, and cilantro. Honest I enjoyed the chips and salsa the best. I also ordered side of refried beans and rice. Nothing stood out for either no ""wow"" factor. Overall maybe the tacos are on point but right now found the food just ok.

It's perfect and just right for a hot summer day. My boyfriend ordered the strawberry horchata Fresca, which is just as amazing! It's on the milkier side, which was expected because it's a horchata.

They then give you a number, and you can sit wherever you like while they prepare your food. The lady that took our order, her name was Norma, was very nice and attentive. She came up to us and brought us our drinks and also asked if we would like some chips and salsa. Heck yes! Then our food came out and we indulged!

Asada salad.... omg perfection. The meat was flavorful and everything just went perfect together. My husband devoured his tacos and he said the nachos were ok. 

We decided to both try the elote, we are from
SoCal and LOVE elote; we have yet to find a place that makes them well.  The lady who helped us earlier made them, she boiled them instead of grilling them and they were just like they came straight from an eloteros cart.

While the strip mall itself is not, perhaps, the 1st one you'd think to visit, the setup inside is really nice- sort of like a chipotle with the metal & wood. The girl who took our order was super sweet- my colleague sampled each of the 8 frescas & loved them all. In addition to a strawberry fresca, we ordered: el pastor tacos, chicken tacos, carne asada nachos & a chicken salad. We watched the order prepared fresh in front of our eyes (like at a Capriotti's) & it was ready rather quickly. While we waited, there was definitely a solid number of people in & out. Back at the office, we all dug in. I swear, none of us spoke a word- we just inhaled the food! I don't have a single complaint about any of it! But, my favorite was the nachos, followed by the salad. &, because it's fresh, while we were certainly stuffed, we didn't feel sick to our stomachs full.

First, they messed up our order.  The lady even repeated it and they still shorted us a taco.  We had already driven home and did not want to drive back for one taco.  We just took that loss but not a good first impression at all.

Next, the price.  The burrito is almost $5 and not very large.  Other members of my family also commented on the lack of value.  We've been to other places where the value for the food was much better.

Finally, the lack of taste.  I had the steak burrito and the meat was dry with no flavor at all.  My wife and I also shared a carne asada fries and same problem.  Dry meat plus dry fries.  Also barely any meat.  Again, bad value for what we paid.

I wanted to like this place but instead it turned out to be a big let down.  I've eaten at some good Mexican places but this is not one of them.  We  won't be coming back.",66ix4MMfGUOOM-iPbZWY6Q,3,0,2,iAdZJ70FAw1j4mZXM3o9tg

I am glad we did because even with only a few other customers in the restaurant, food service was slow and a bit awkward. The cashiers seemed a bit frazzled or distracted. About 10 mins after ordering my 2 veggie tacos and aqua fresca I was brought over 1 taco. Guess there was some kind of mix up. So I paid for another taco and about another 10 mins later I got my order. The place is spacious and I like the simple modern feel of the decor. Not in the nicest of neighborhoods so not sure if I would venture here after dark. My food was fresh and colorful. I was however concerned that although the buckets of aqua frescas were surrounded by ice, they didn't have lids on them. That could lead to dust, bugs, hair, and other particles floating down in the drinks.

Sadly, 2 days later, while the flavor was there, the quantity was actually poor. The tacos were tiny compared to two nights ago, and the burrito was the smallest burrito I've seen in 30 yrs in any taqueria from San Francisco to Las Vegas, and I've eaten in a lot in that time.

The outer appearance for this location seems to be a LOT more inviting though ahhaha. The interior is also clean just like the other location. They have a counter top where you could sit & enjoy your food while they make the food. Once thing I liked about the other location was being able to see EVERYTHING without having to TRY to look over a counter. 

Service is great for this location as well greeting you with a smile & the guy that was making my food even bothered to have a conversation with me while I was sitting watching my food being made.

Food was delicious as I got my usual selections. I was a LITTLE disappointed with my CARNE ASADA BURRITO - it literally seemed like there was only meat in it... usually there would be a good amount of guacamole. pico de gayo. & cheese but it lacked these things which made it seem a little Bland. 

CARNE ASADA FRIES - delicious & served with FAT fries. Each bite had a little bit of everything when mixed which in my opinion is to be considered a good Carne Asada fries.

MEXICAN STREET CORN - packed with cheese & sprinkled chili powder

Great food! 
Only one negative . When you order a combo it comes with a drink. They will then ask you if you want a fountain drink (sodas) or if you want Agua Fresca ( flavored waters such as watermelon , cucumber etc .)
What they won't tell you is when you say u want the agua Fresca they will add .75 cents (medium) without letting you know first . Fine. I would gladly pay the upgrade for the Agua Fresca , but they should inform you first .
Price for the Medium Agua Fresca by itself btw is $2.50
So back to the positive:
I ordered the taco combo for $7.99
Which came with one Taco , rice and beans and  a fountain drink . As mentioned already I went with the Cucumber Agua Fresca for the additional .75 cents.
I also ordered a side of chips and guacamole for $3.00 .
Chips and salsa are available for $2.00
And finally how could I resist the grilled street corn also known as elote .
So the Taco (Asada or Steak ) was perfect . Not greasy at all.
Chips and guacamole were adequate . The guacamole was not spicy , and that's fine because that's the way I like it .
The elote was excellent ! It was grilled instead of boiled or steamed as you will find in other places . 
I love this place and will return but probly not pig out as much as I did this time. I think I over did it .",ats8qvpIrTawAhgXmDUg8w,1,1,4,CyLEjlLTCIIQII5q3LpOFg

We shared an assortment of tacos-Asada, Pescado, Lengua, Cabeza, Al Pastor, Beans and Rice, Mini Quesadilla and Spinach Agua Frescas. The Quesadilla wasn't all that, and of all of the other tacos, none of them weren't bad, but not bomb.com either. Elote was just meh, but my agua fresca was refreshing.

Service:  Stopped in during the lunch rush with about 10 people ahead of us and we were ordering within 7 minutes.  I ordered a #3 Burrito combo which comes with chips, salsa and a fountain drink.  They brought the chips and salsa immediately to the table and the burrito followed about 5 minutes later.  Quick efficient service from the kitchen. Drinks are self service so the servers are focused on getting you your food from the kitchen and clearing tables to get people seated quickly.

Burrito time: When I come across tasty Mexican good it's always comes down to the ingredients and preparation.  Frijoles & Frescas might have the best casual Mexican for me right now.  This chicken burrito was very fresh, tasty and the perfect size.  Excellent

Frijoles and Frescas is currently winning the casual Mexican restaurant battle vs Cafe Rio in my book.

The flavors in the meat were amaaaazing, and the accoutrements were also tasty and fresh. Staff was friendly, service was fast, and the price was right. Restroom was super clean and smelled good; even the decor was on point. These people know what they're doing and we should all support them!

Below are some things I've been able to try:
-Al pastor quesadilla- perfectly crispy yet soft tortilla folded over a whole load of delicious pork, melted cheese, guacamole, & pico. I like that they use real guacamole here. Pretty oily 
-Al pastor fries- good portion, tastes fresher than Roberto's because they're topped with a LOT of guac and pico de gallo and soft beans. Yum
-Tacos- kinda pricey for $5. You get all the toppings on these. I'd probably skip it cause you could get a burrito for a dollar more..
-Mini tacos- your regular street tacos with cilantro and onions and sour cream. I've had this with lengua which was cooked just right  
-Burritos- aren't as large as the ones at Roberto's, but definitely much more worth the price. More flavorful and sometimes dripping with oil
-Strawberry Horchata- a little on the sweet side for me

In short, I love that their pico de gallo and guacamole is not skimped on and is always fresh. It really livens up the already-flavorful meats. Al pastor is my go-to and is great. I'm not a fan of whole beans, but theirs is so soft (I'm a texture person).

Recently the rice and beans portion is smaller. It's a small bowl instead of what is pictured. The mini tacos didn't come with lime this time.  They have two bottles of sauces on each table: spicy and mild and also hot sauce. Churros were a bit hard. Our tacos came before our rice and beans.

Prices are very reasonable and depending on what you get it could be more or less bang for your buck. I ordered the al pastor taco and a kid's chicken quesadilla. The al pastor taco was a good size for $4 and some odd change and it was tasty. The kid's menu quesdilla was more of a taco than my image of a flour tortilla folded in half with melted cheese. Will not order again, but the tacos I would. I also had their jamaica ( hibiscus ) agua fresca. It was refreshing and not too sweet. Too often agua frescas are loaded up on sugar and you can't taste the delicate fruit, veggie, or in this case floral flavor. The different salas were good too. There was a green one, a darker green one and a red one. The green one was not spicy, but flavorful, the darker green one had more of a smokey grilled flavor and the red one was spicier and kinda smokey. The place was busy for Saturday lunch and they are closed on Sundays. It is also very clean and the workers were quick and helpful.

I'm from San Antonio so when it comes to Mexican food I have high expectations and honestly have yet to find a place in Vegas that is even comparable to San Antonio places but this place was good! No, it's not authentic Mexican food, more like Tex-mex but it was good. The restaurant was super clean and staff greeted us immediately. You order at the counter and they give you a number. They bring the food to you so just sit back and relax. 

I saw Aguas Frescas on the menu and had to order some and mmmm mmm it was good. The watermelon was so fresh and just fabulous. Reminds me of the stuff that I would get at Fiesta in San Antonio. The salsa with the chips was more like pico de gallo but you could tell that they use real fresh produce so I'm not complaining about that. 

Now for the main course I had mini tacos al pastor. Great flavor! I once had tacos al pastor in Puerto Vallarta and have not been able to find that fabulous taste again until today. Their corn tortillas were fluffy and light and the meat was perfectly marinated and tender. Yum! And if you read my reviews you know I had to try my fiancé's quesadilla and chicken taco and everything was delicious. Oh and the rice and beans were some of the best I've had. The rice was fluffy and flavorful, I hate when the Mexican restaurants make the rice all soggy, Mexican rice and beans are staple at Mexican restaurants.

You can find them all over Mexico and they even have exotic fruits like Mamey and Guanabana.  When I found out there was a restaurant here that offered aguas frescas I knew I had to try it out.
  
I came here for a light lunch one day and ordered a large cucumber + chia seed drink and 2 tacos.  

The tacos, to my surprise, tasted very authentic.  This is the real deal folks!  I thought it'd be another Americanized type of restaurant.  No, you don't get that delicious and greasy taco truck taste, but you do get an amazing clean grilled taste.  At $2 a pop for the mini tacos I was a fan.  The salsas?  Amazing!  Both the red and green salsas are almost as good as mom makes.  

The star of show is definitely the agua fresca.  You can even sample the juices/waters and mix and match!  There was no pulp which was a welcome surprise.  The large is 32 liquid ounces and definitely filled me up.

Yes?  Frijoles and Frescas bringing not sexy back, but my childhood memories.   

Grilled tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos and more.   
Every time I go here I try a different Fresca flavored drink and definitely get the street corn.   So far, the mango and cucumber are at the top of my list, but you can mix whatever your heart desires.",7P6t9qnhKLOa8SqGb85B7w,2,3,4,9ixnwof8mVkgHyFE7IM3Nw

My last visit it was like pulling teeth to get our order in its entirety at once and after having to ask for our frescas twice we were brought water cups... this visit I asked for 6 sides of salsa for my to go order with the cashier she  said okay and I paid for my order. When I was waiting for the order the girl asked me if 3 was enough I said I asked for 6, she then sat there and told me I could have 4... I asked your cashier, if there were a charge for the extra sauce it should have been applied when I asked her for 6. Then after stating I asked for 6 she said I could have 5... mind you the little cups aren't even full so asking for 6 cups is really like asking for 3 full cups.

5683010,2017-07-21,0,DKXUkIrFnMUMF535gf-dPA,Hidden in a shopping center at the northwest corner of Rainbow and Tropicana is Frijoles & Frescas.  First trip I decided to try the combo with two mini tacos along with rice and beans on the side.  Also tried the watermelon fresca which tasted like betting into a juicy watermelon maybe a tad too sweet but very refreshing coupled with the rest of the meal.  The two taco meats of choice on this trip were al pastor and cabeza.  The cabeza taco was very juicy and tender which would put it ahead of the al pastor taco which had great flavor but the pork may have been a bit dry.  Overall the meal was quite satisfying except for the portions of tacos which quelled my hunger but left me longing for more.  The sides were a bit overwhelming compared to the tacos but I found myself digging into them to get full.  I will definitely go back and try the other dishes on the menu.,hYjzYrSRNwHif4v2RTvAlg,0,1,4,YrZJEY4W43ovSnnzs9xt8g

Immediately when you walk in the atmosphere is modern yet inviting. The workers are super sweet and I had a sample of the el pastor which was really yummy and cooked in a Shawarma type style   I ordered Carne Asada Mini Street Taco and Elote the whole reason I came here was for the elote.  

1.  The carne aside mini street taco was amazing for two reasons 1 the homemade tortillas that were the most delicious tortillas I've ever eaten ok top 3 at least I don't want my Latin friends to be insulted because they make amazing tortillas. 

2. The meat wasn't tough or dry and was cooked perfectly.  

The Elote the whole reason I came here since my favorite place closed down. 

My first thought when I bought into the elote was Yassss finally the grilled taste of the corn and the bite of spicy mixed with the Cojita cheese was just what I was waiting for.  Their elote is supreme and I am going to start coming here a lot more than I should.

5750265,2016-09-06,0,DKXUkIrFnMUMF535gf-dPA,"Im from Chicago so Ive had my fair share of authentic mexican food, tacos more specifically. This place has authentic and not so authentic options.

The mini tacos are probably the most authentic thing here since they just come with onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice. Cant go wrong with a carne asada mini taco here.
Rice and beans are a biiiit on the salty side but still really tasty.

If youre looking for more tex mex style food then go with the regular tacos, they come fully loaded with pinto beans, guac, etc.. burritos are the same.

NOW THE HIGHLIGHT

Those god damn agua frescas man.. I live like .3 miles from this place and in the 1 week Ive been here Ive spent like $40 on these things ($3.50 a piece so you do the math)

Its basically different flavored sweet god like nectar water lol

My favorites are:
Spinach (sounds nasty but it tastes like orange juice)
Watermelon

My absolute favorite which the girl working there recommended is half pineapple and half cucumber. Effing amazing.

I stop by here like every day on the way home to get an agua fresca, it is that good. Just do yourself a favor and get it.",2r0CnsEbhBo75KYoVF8eGA,0,0,5,-pGlf61hXXJFd1iMVHF25A

The chips and salsa are just ok. The salsa is basically pico, not salsa so it needs more flavor. The chips could be a little saltier. 

The place is very clean with plenty of seating. The prices are a good value as well.

Conveniently located on the corner of Tropicana and Rainbow, there is a surprising lack of good food in this area. Frijoles & Frescas very recently opened up and I'm happy to report that they are just as good food and service-wise as their original location on Charleston.

I ordered the mini taco combination plate that comes with rice and beans and your choice of meat for the tacos and I upgraded my drink to a watermelon juice. The tacos were great. I chose al pastor and they were delicious and seasoned well. I wish they came with pineapple and they had a more extensive salad bar, but otherwise it they were great. The rice and beans were on point and I am always a sucker for watermelon juice. Very refreshing. My mom and I also shared some elote. Not the best I've ever had and a little over cooked, but decent.

Decent prices and a pretty large dining area good for eating in or takeout. I'm glad to have another option in this area for food.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,13,11,4,jGxzWpkSczE1WIOAZj6SUw
