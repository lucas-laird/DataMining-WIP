Our groupon voucher was declined by the cashier stating that we had to use it at their other location at Henderson which is about 30 miles away, although the groupon voucher did not state this, the cashier admitted that the goupon voucher was valid but not at this location as he put it, "" we have two stores you have to go to the other one"" I informed the  cashier that this was not stipulated in the goupon order and the restaurant is empty anyway and why not just take our order since there is no one in here at 2;00 pm? , nevertheless he said no cant take it.
Then on my way out the owner sitting on a table even attempted to add insult to me by saying: ""DONT FORGET YOUR PAPER YOU LEFT ON THE TABLE"" he was referring to a flyer that my two year old had in his hand and left it at the table.
      I did however inform the owner that he can just go ahead and keep the paper.",nd9Zs0viCYCSNxw1wWl9mQ,1,0,1,oDvrOKZrnlzWwUtNEqfZXg

it tasted  very good and was made fresh and the place looked clean, so i feel bad giving it a bad rating but based on how many very fast trips i had to make to the restroom not long after visiting, i cant give it a higher rating at this time... I may actually try it again in the future  after a cooling off period of a few months and get brave and try again and tell myself  that maybe some ingredient was just off or just had a bug in it and my number was up for getting a touch intestinal trouble, but at this moment I'm a little gun shy to go back any time soon. It can happen in the best restaurants, and it looks like a lot of people loved their meals so I'm happy they enjoyed the complete experience, but since this happened to me, i feel a duty to report it. it happened nov of 2013 a few months ago so maybe the problem is contained or just came in a batch of vegetables etc. this is my hope.

otherwise, I liked the staff, i liked the selection, i liked the murals on the wall. it seems like a very large place for the number of folks eating there the evening i did but I'm thinking its a lunch time rush kind of place.",XSCf9uT3ZGKU-gF79UFTNQ,3,0,2,HbF_c2wyCkltSYXA8Uu99g

One of the few places that serves up lamb kabobs without including beef in it, which is great for people like me who don't eat beef.  The lamb and chicken kabobs are delicious, and the persian rice is so fragrant and flavoUrful.  The pita bread is made fresh in-house, and while a little more dry than I am usually used to, it has the rustic feel and taste that goes great with their kabobs. I also like the yogurt-mint-dill dip that comes with the kabobs.

They have an amazing menu full of different combinations and meats and exotic foods I have never heard of. I ordered what was known to me; the Chicken Kabob plate. However, when ordering the owner, or atleast what I presume to be the owner, talked me up to getting the Lamb Kabob plate, with no fee! This was amazing because lamb is much more expensive on the menu, $6.99 chicken vs $8.99 lamb, I did not complain and happily took the upgrade.

While waiting for my food I comfortably sat down in a chair, specified because they had a lounge area to the side with couches and chairs - something you would see out of a Hookah lounge. 

The food came and my first impression was that it was BEAUTIFUL. The plate was crafted beautifully, and if I figure out how to upload a photo I will. The salad was lackluster at best but that was so minimal that it did not hinder my dining experince. I still ate it. The safron rice was delicious and fresh, the Lamb Kabob laid beautifully on top of the rice looking fresh and ready to be eaten. This is the main dish and rightfully so! It was tender and melted in my mouth with a little bit of chewing. It was delicious. The pita bread and cilantro sauce was just out of this world. If I could, I would have ordered two more orders of the bread because of how delicious it was.

All in all, this place was very delicious and very close to the University, it's a good walk, good food, reasonably priced and has some college kid discounts, like a free drink or water.

Falafel was on top of this bread becuase it wasn't a pita so that was different. I went in for the $3.99 special (which is just sandwich), but for $5.99, you get great fluffy rice, one dolma which was perfect and then a small side of marinated onions which were great for the falafel. The Tzitica sauce was good, but you will need more than what they give you. It is tasty. Looks like kabobs are the specialty and the falafel itself was also way above average - brownish in color inside, hot, small and well spiced.

I came here based on it's proximity to UNLV (I always see the sign when I drive past) but it is UNACCEPTABLE on so many levels. Go to Kabob Express on the corner of Tropicana and Eastern instead, it's not that much further.

I should have had a bad feeling when the place was deserted at dinner time on Saturday night. It looks gross from outside - really no frills, under a creepy walkway, across from an abandoned store. When we walked up and I still wanted to go in, my friends joking said, ""Wow, you're feeling adventurous!"" which can give you a better idea of how gross this place actually is.

The inside was no better. Everything was covered in filth and it looked like nobody had cleaned in a week. We moved several times and couldn't find a table without remnants of food, rice and dirt. The condiments on the table were old, crusted over and just looking at them made me sick to my stomach! This place needs an inspection ASAP. It is definitely not up to health codes by anybody's standards.

We ate in and the owner refused to give me a glass of water. This is an immediate red flag for me at ANY restaurant. He clearly had cups and there was clearly a soda fountain with a water spout. Is making an extra dollar off a plastic water bottle that important to your business that you can't properly serve your paying customers?

All the plates, cups, utensils were styrofoam. It felt like we were eating at a homeless shelter, except the food was overpriced and I was denied water, which I'm sure homeless people are allowed.

I ordered a chicken salad and my friends ordered shish kabob plates. All the portions were TINY!! My chicken salad literally had ONE SQUARE of chicken. One, single (think like 1 inch square) piece of chicken was on my salad that I paid $6 for. There wasn't even a good amount of salad but it was all drenched in a greasy cheap Italian-like dressing.

We also ordered a side of baba ganoush.  It was delicious and fresh made.  Great roasted taste to the eggplant and the pita bread is made fresh.

The other dish was dry, tastless and low quality. $15 dish looked like a $5 lunch special dish! but we finished half of it anyways. We suspect they purposely gave us a low quality food becasue of restaurant.com certificate we had. But why would anyone do this? Just horrible quality.

3577006,2014-03-27,1,Cr066pnTj0ioEMZRTHgMOw,"This place is abhorrent in almost every way.  I had previously been twice with friends and I wasn't too impressed with the food and thought the service was a bit slow.  Also the location is a bit skeezy.  Recently I've been twice and now this place is one of few restaurants anywhere that I will never ever go back to.

I bought a couple of Groupons a while back and they were about to expire so I wanted to use them.  I went on Monday in the afternoon and had to wait about 5 minutes for the cashier to get off the phone to take my order.  I presented my Groupon and then he informed me that if I bought certain items while using the Groupon, the price would go up.  For example one of their meals that was $12.99 without the Groupon would be $16.99 with the Groupon.  I guess partnering with Groupon and then overcharging is one way to increase business without losing money in the short term, but you do it at the expense of pissing off new customers.

Anyway I ordered a two kabob plates without salads (just meat, bread, and rice) and some dolmeh to go.  The place was entirely empty when I came in but a couple of others came in after me.  After about 10 minutes the dolmeh was brought out to me on a plate and I had to remind them that it was an order to go, so they took it back.  After over 20 minutes my order was ready to go.  However both plates contained salads so I had to spend another 5 minutes dumping the salad out.

As far as the food goes, the BBQ chicken kabob was repulsive -- the chicken itself was OK but the sauce on it and the rice was disgusting.  The beef kabob was really fatty/gristly and I had to spit half of it out.  My girlfriend, who I gave the dolmeh to, said that there was a weird red sauce in the dolmeh she hadn't seen before and she thought maybe the tomatoes were bad quality and dyed red.

I still had one more Groupon to go, so I went on Wednesday.  This time the cashier from Monday was there, but the main cashier was an older man (the owner perhaps?).  I got my Groupon out and he said that I could not use it for take out, it was dine-in only.  I showed him the details of it and that it was valid for take-out and he said ""OK well then if you use it we have to charge you 15% gratuity.""  At that point I just left.  

So, long story short, the people who are here are trying to drum up business by partnering with Groupon, Yelp, Restaurant.com and then when the customers arrive they are being charged more up front for many menu items, possibly being restricted to dining-in only when that's not stated ahead of time, and then being charged gratuity on top of everything, possibly even for take-out (if they allow it!).  

I love middle-eastern food and kabobs but you can do a lot better than this.  Bad food, bad customer service, and screwing customers on prices.  Who would want to take their business to a place like this?",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,1,0,1,h5zB3ocvKdJ5nmIkoR5EaQ

4085504,2014-01-29,3,Cr066pnTj0ioEMZRTHgMOw,"*FIRST NOTE* We had a Groupon for this location. We had $20 to use. The owner told us that to use the Groupon, we had to each buy a drink and pay a 15% gratuity on the bill. The Fine Print on Groupon says nothing about having to buy drinks and adding a 15% gratuity. I know this guy was scamming us, but I paid the difference to just get this over with.

We ordered a beef shish kabob and a beef and lamb shwarma. The food took a little while to come out to us. The food was not bad at all. The beef shish kabob was actually pretty tasty. The shwarma had a bit too much gristle. The saffron rice was okay, nothing to write home about. Pita bread and hummus was good, didn't find it too oily, although I have heard complaints on that. The owner did even come by and give us extra pita bread. He also had us try the green sauce which wasn't too bad, it had a nice spice to it (though I had seen it earlier and commented that it looked old). The owner also mentioned that the beef was imported from some country like Australia and said it had no hormones. That I didn't believe, this coming from the owner who had already scammed us into buying drinks and gratuity. 

One good note from the owning scamming us to get drinks was trying the sour cherry iced tea. That was delicious. I'm not normally an iced tea drinker as I prefer more sugary drinks but this was a great blend of flavor and light taste. Definitely the best part of the experience.

Though, the place is only going to get two stars however. The fact that the owner scammed us into spending more money gives insight on how the whole operation is run. It's true, businesses that run Groupons do NOT make money of those. They actually are more likely to lose money in the short term as they are giving away food. The point of this is to increase foot traffic and get people in the door and have a nice experience so they can tell their friends. 

What the owner is doing is alienating the people who do use these deals. This may be acceptable in the short term, but in the long term, they will have very little repeat business.

Plus, this location had been on Dirty Dining only a month previously, where he mentioned that some of the meat is pre cooked (so why would he talk about the importation of great beef if it's imported?) and the green sauce in that episode had been out for 11 days. Just seems like the owner trying to talk his way out of things. 

I can understand where the owner is coming from. The strip mall where this restaurant is located is a dead zone. Nothing really survives in the space. The atmosphere around the location is abysmal and just down right spooky at time at how quiet it is. The inside of the actual restaurant is also like that, with the lack of patrons and the quietness of the music. 

Overall, the food wasn't bad and I would have been up for a return visit, but questionable tactics by ownership has really dampened any chance for that.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,8,3,2,5itUTsGOhfYvpmqFolMbEA

When I arrived, the first thing I noticed was that the POSTED prices varied from the ACTUAL prices.  The manager defiantly told me he had the right to change his prices anytime he chose.  While I agreed, I submitted he should probably update his menus.

Next, when I placed my order, the manager argued with me when I asked for a combo with NO fries or rice.  I just didn't want the carbs, and I didn't ask for anything ADDITIONAL.  This simple request seemed to be much-too-much, however; it didn't need to turn into a debate.

Afterwards, when I attempted to use my $10 discount certificate, the store manager scoffed at me, complaining how too many people want to use coupons...uh, then WHY do you use them as a marketing tool?!?!?!

But when we went to go order our food, the owner told my mom and I that in order for us to use the voucher, we had to each buy our own drink or water ($8.00 total) and then added another 15% gratuity tax. I looked at the receipt after I read some other post just a few moments ago, and the cashier did charge us 8.99$ for a gyro that is listed as 5.99$ on the menu. Even after eliminating the voucher, we handed another 36$.

As for the food, it was okay. Nothing spectacular to make me go running back in there again...ever.

5036654,2014-01-14,1,Cr066pnTj0ioEMZRTHgMOw,"This place is NOT where you want to eat!! 

1. Service is horrible!! Be Aware of Scams!!
Please be aware to ALWAYS look at your receipt, the owner has been known to secretly add extra hidden charges, without your knowledge!!
I.e. There was a Groupon deal for this location, so we purchased the $40 worth of food voucher, (note that Im an avid Groupon user, so I am fully aware of the rules/ regulations), we placed our order for $47 worth of food ($52 after taxes) and the owner was going place an additional 15% gratuity on top of our bill, just because he wanted to! NO WHERE on the Groupon deal does it state 15% gratuity would be added!! We asked WHY he was charging us extra and he stated ""because you use Groupon, and I no make money!! So I HAVE TO CHARGE EXTRA 15%"". That's a bunch of BS!!

Needless to say, we argued and walked out not buying a thing, because we were being scammed! As we were gathering our stuff to leave, another couple told us they were equally scammed by being charged extra because they used a Restaurant.com voucher! They too we're going to file a complaint. Here's the deal, If the owner wants to promote his business using Groupon, that is his prerogative, but he needs to respect and honor the rules and regulations!! He cannot create his own price adjustments after customers purchase the vouchers!! Hence, we walked out because we do not trust his business, and we didn't want to be taken advantage of!! 

2. The Food is NOT Fresh!! Eat at your own risk...afterall it's not cheap anyway!
We are locals and locals discuss business all the time!! Apparently this place had to shut down by the Food Department bc of it's LOW GRADE due to unsanitary conditions. It then reopened after Inspection Approval...I found this out after my incident described above...Not being able to eat here was a blessing in disguise, perhaps!

Here's the Interview from KTNV NEWS ""Dirty Dining"" and their Demerits!!! 
http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/dirty-dining/Dirty-Dining-Flame-Kabob-236810281.html 

3. The place is filthy and unsanitary!! Again, Eat at your own risk!!


****It's Unfortunate that this Business has Potential, BUT is not putting it to use!!
The Owner needs to learn how to treat Customers respectfully and serve Fresh Food in a clean kitchen...bottom line!! 

AGAIN...BEWARE...EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! =(",9NiqtEIE7p_GdTXUIeaMEw,9,2,1,RMASsHAHPKpHgBgjBhSzxA

the quality of the food is not well enough for the price, actually it sucks...
you will serve the food in plastic dishes and utensils, with a little bit of rice, yogurt and salad.
 ( I emphasize that food comes with ""little bit"" of these sides )
The decoration of this damn place doesn't look like a high ranking restaurant... subway or chipotle decorations are much more better ...
I don't recommend it at all. 
compared to the other Persian restaurant which I've tried before, Flame Kabob in Las Vegas cause a very bad memory of Persian restaurant for me.",ddf3bI6x8jpQ_0V_gVi3Jg,1,0,1,LI1Mmk2kilByZdH3ajFPCA

I decided to go here again out of convenience and I thought why not. I had noticed that since the last time I had been there,  they lowered the prices a bit. Lookin good already, I thought.  I proceeded to order the number 1 combo,  which is their ground beef kubideh. The guy who rang me up was very pleasant,  not just to me,  but to the others who were there. Perhaps they saw their negative reviews? 

You need to try the rose tea and sour cherry teas. Delicious.  I got my order and jeeze, I don't remember the meat being this juicy and flavorful. I remembered it being slightly dry. Maybe the lunch hour has a different staff because dinner here was great. The yogurt was perfect, the bread was fluffy, and the rice was buttery. All very delicious.

The food is fresh, and the signature bread is freshly baked right before you order. The kabobs are tender, well marinated and overall, do justice to the authenticity of this Persian food staple.

My largest complaint with Flame Kabob is what seeks to be, oddly enough, a supply constraint. On 3 separate occasions, I have gone to the restaurant to order my favorite dish, the chicken kubideh plate, only to find out they ran out of chicken. To me, this is unacceptable, especially if it is such a popular dish. I hope they remedy the situation in the future.",kHKK7IiFwiHgS8xEhN3EVA,2,0,4,QPIk8MxI_aIfiBVlQoUMhQ

There is plenty of parking behind the building.  It's across from a school.  They seem to cater to students.  There are plenty of student deals on the menu.  

At this location, you order up front and then they deliver the food to you.  We came here late afternoon on a Friday and there were two other tables here.  The prices were decent for what you get.  I particularly love their drink selection.  I got a rose ice tea that I love!

5915208,2013-03-22,0,Cr066pnTj0ioEMZRTHgMOw,"So this is the original? I would've never guess as the location is tucked away in an underground mini mall across campus. I have always frequented the one on Sunset which is now no longer part of the chain/franchise.

I got the mix and match combo chicken and lamb (+3.00 extra) and a mini mast-akhir sauce. 
First off I was bummed that there was an upgrade charge for the lamb. It wasn't that way at the other location. There were a few other subtitle difference between this location and the breakaway fresh kabob.
1. The upgrade charge mentioned above for the lamb.
2. The combo comes with a bit of mast-akhir sauce on your plate (no need for separate orders)
3. The side mast-akhir sauce comes with bread. 
4. The mint chutney sauce is is Spicy! 

The kebabs were packed full of flavor as I have come to expect. Nice flame grilled texture while at the same time moist. I enjoyed the dish here. 
The only thing that was a bit of a miss was the bread, I was used to the lighter fluffy taftoon bread that's served at the other place, this one was a little more on the dense and firm side.
