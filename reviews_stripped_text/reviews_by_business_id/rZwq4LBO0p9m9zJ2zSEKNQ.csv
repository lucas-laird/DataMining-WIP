PROS
excellent service.....well timed...did not have food forced down our throats.

carrot cake...not an everyday item on their menu...yummy

short rib starter...very tender..excellent sauce...could have used a touch more seasoning

goat cheese salad...could be prepared easily at home...however, still excellent

peanut chicken entree...right on with spices

cappucinos...spot on...Lavazza espresso

martinis...had the hot and dirty...also a couple with bleu cheese olives and horseradish olives...extremely tasty...but a little pricey...go during happy hour for 2 bucks off each martini and starter ...5-630pm

CONS
duck entree...not enough flavor...slightly over crispy and dry

lamb chop lollipop starter...not much flavor. left with a lot of waste and connective tissue on bone...would have been nice to have a steak knife....but still to much effort needed to get all of lamb of the bones

patio outside...should have more foliage to block out gas station lights..simple fix with about $100 investment


WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK...most likely will get a couple of starters and martinis",DbApWbSx-SECCGAHNshVBg,0,0,4,9U4jLyKJ2Ba4Q4cnfIwWmQ

So of course I tried a drink that had lavender and gin in it . Can't remember the name but let me tell you it was so delicious and refreshing with the lavender making you feel relaxed. 

This place is small and intimate which I really like because I went to catch up with a close friend. There is seating at the bar as well as tables. They have a full bar and a huge wine list. Parking lot is was easy to get in and out of. They offer happy hour too! 

Went off some yelp recommendations to help choose food options. 

Tried the pig and fig Delicious! As soon as I saw the description and saw that there was fig jam I was all over it. Just the right amount of salt and sweet and big enough to share between to people. 

Fire and ice shrimp has scallops in it. Smaller portion of scallops than I expected it to be but none the less very tasty and not too spicy or salty. 

Everything but the kitchen sink salad was recommended by the waiter and he was nice enough to even spilt the salad portion into two servings with out us even asking him to so that my friend and I could share the salad. If you are looking for a salad that has a little bit of everything this is the one for you. 

I checked in on yelp and they had a coupon for free dessert. So I tried they're lava cake. Very rich and chocolatey I had to share because I couldn't finish it myself.  

This was my first time here and it will for sure not be my last!",zm5ZxCeFYT4GD8u4v60D-Q,4,1,4,vN88Pl1AriLsZwZLkvOxPg
75479,2013-10-17,0,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,Vegas is mainly dominated by celebrity chefs and largely commercialized casino restaurants yet there are hidden culinary gems all over the city. Elements is absolutely one of these gems and as a local has become one of my go-to restaurants! A list of 500 Martinis makes you want to try  each one and is complimented by an eclectic and varied food menu! The bruschetta and duck salad are a few of my favorites!,SteNphagTUp1El_BQpDawA,1,0,5,opGZ_Jji6AwbT8yxfrgOvw
89729,2010-10-12,1,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"A friend and I stumbled into this restaurant while driving around desperately looking for a decent place to eat after an afternoon of hiking.  We were both ravenous and ready to settle for an Applebee's as we drove past Elements Kitchen & Martini Bar.  I directed my friend to turn around and go back.  

My friend was a bit skeptical, because he had negative connotations with the use of the word kitchen in a restaurant's name, but I suggested we at least check out the menu.  We walked into a small and nicely appointed dining room and were immediately greeted by the pastry chef and owner Catherine.  Both the restaurant and Catherine had a warm, welcoming and relaxed vibe.  We opted for a table outside and perused the menu.

We each started with the Maple Leaf Farms Sliced Duck Breast Salad, with wood grilled duck breast, mixed greens, caramelized walnuts, gorgonzola crumbles and pomegranate vinaigrette.  It was a perfect balance between sweet, savory and acid flavors.  I could have eaten it all night.  

We then went on to the Lollipop Lamb Chops, pounded, wood grilled lamb chops, in a port wine reduction, with dried cranberries, and an english mustard sauce over lentils.  The chops were tender, juicy and perfectly cooked and the sauce was amazing.  

Catherine read us the desert specials; we were sold on the strawberry apple pie with caramel and cinnamon and the plain crème brulee.  The combination of apples and strawberries was a wonderful and perfectly not too sweet surprise.  The crème brulee was just as it should be; sweet, crispy sugar on top and silky smooth cream underneath.  We also ordered espresso, which was the best I've had in years.  

I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu as well as the martinis.",aJvNNSBbbaZYAlKGnOXiSQ,3,1,5,4TWvZ1rzSyamMUTLTdF4_g

The bartender seemed like he didn't want to be there, unlike most bartenders he was not very friendly. 
We ordered the sliders, mushroom ravioli and cheese plate. 
The sliders were ok with the usual toppings of onion and tomato, nothing special. The raviolis were flavorful and well cooked. The cheese plate consisted of cubes of cheese and overripe berries with a side of stale crackers.

The Abondigas appetizer was tasty, especially the marinara that had a hint of cumin. I had Chilean Sea Bass in a ponzu sauce that was delicious even though it was not really  that fish.

145593,2011-10-29,1,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"This place is phenomenal! We made a reservation for 6 p.m. on a Friday. We arrived at around 5:50 p.m. and were seated right away. It wasn't too busy when we arrived but by the time we left at around 8 p.m., it was almost full. 

The maritni list is HUGE! Seriously, I could have spent an hour reading all of the different maritini's. I started off with a Samurai, which was gin, midori and peach snapps. Yummy and super sweet if you like the sugary drinks. The next one I had was the Lychee martini, much more subdued with vodka and lychee puree. I finished of with a cucumber martini which was amazing and refreshing, also a vodka martini. They also had rum martinis, which we didn't try and scotch and wiskey martinis. My husband had a scotch martini, which he said was good, but he still prefers his scotch on the rocks. So the waiter then suggested a new scotch they had in for the scotch tasting dinner which my husband LOVED. 

On to the food. They brought out bread to start with, homemade white bread and foccacia, with fresh butter shaped into roses and a mango chutney which was very very good. 

We ordered four *thats right folks* four appetizers to begin with. We had the short ribs over gorgonzola polenta, the calamari, the bruschetta of the day which was topped with escargot and pesto, and the fire and ice shrimp and scallops. 

Short ribs: Cooked to perfection, the meat was so tender and the polenta had a nice sweetness and the dish was topped with a balsamic reduction.

The calamari was good, standard, nothing to write home about. It comes with a delicious sauce though.  

The fire and ice shrimp and scallops: Both cooked perfectly and the sauce was seriously to die for, we were slopping it up with the bread. And they removed the tail from the shrimp for you so you dont have to worry about that. 

Bruschetta: More of the yummy bread toasted with a homemade pesto that was nice and thick and not oily mixed with escargot.This was my first try of escargot and I thought it was delicious.

We ordered the sea bass to split for an entree. OMG. This was honestly the best fish I have ever had. It was crusted with seasame and topped with a citrus ponzu. It melted like butter and exploded with flavor in my mouth. YES! It was served with a side of mashed yukon golds and a vegetable medly. 

The owner is the chef and his wife, also the owner, is the pastry chef. She came out and explained all the deserts to us and said she changes them up regularly. She also explained how she doesnt like to use a lot fo refined sugar and like to use things like raisins and fruit to sweeten things. We ordered the chefs tasting and it had carrot cake, creme brulee, bread pudding and baked alaska. It was all heavenly and she was a delight to speak to. Our waiter was great, the owners were great, the food was great and the decor was great. 

We had a fabulous date night and wonderful meal. We will most definately be back!",rONMYLVdSph8OQBb27wDKQ,1,0,5,9aICahxkdO8MrKxr32Giyw

She also came over numerous times though out the evening to check on us. The food was delicious and the wine list adequate. The martini menu was enormous so if you are a Martini drinker this could be your nirvana. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will dine here again.

169858,2013-09-15,0,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,Nice fine dining without going to the strip.  The filet was one of the best steaks ever.  Try one of the many martini's.,zKTgMkT2IP_JDs-ruZwCbw,1,1,5,zWMEyQEWHeRklTLPjRtUyg
190012,2012-08-17,1,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"I must admit, when my boyfriend pulled up to this restaurant for my birthday dinner, my first thought was ""oh, man. Fail."" The location at the end of a strip mall, right next to a gas station, with neon ""Open"" and ""Blue Moon"" signs in the window did nothing for me. Actually, they frightened me. 

But walking in, I loved the feel, immediately, of the little place. Large bar on the right with more than enough room to eat at, a supreme liquor and wine selection visible, a little room divider that divided the bar from the dining area, while leaving the place open and airy, and a quaint, intimate little eating area. We loved the warm and eclectic decor of the place. It sort of reminded us of gems you find in old historical buildings in downtown areas like Aspen, Park City, etc. 

Our server was very pleasant and very knowledgable about the martini menu, the daily specials, the entire menu, etc. She gave enough information and answered our few questions so we felt comfortable ordering.

I had the Eiffel Tower Martini, Boyfriend had the CEO. ($9 each) Both were great. Out came the complimentary bread with their homemade chutney and butter. I'm not much of a bread eater - but both were fresh and tasty. We shared an appetizer - the bruschetta ($8) with the daily toppings. Ours were spicy andouille sausage with mushrooms and onions. Incredibly savory with a little kick, and the portion size was double what we were expecting.

We both had the house salad ($5), him with the homemade balsamic vinagrette and me with the homemade gorgonzola dressing. The ingredients, though simple, were fresh and ripe and the dressing, for both of us, was amazing. 

Choosing our ""Main Event' was a little challenging. There were so many things that sounded so good. However, two of the dishes contained curry - something I despise, and as there were maybe 15 main events - that seemed like 1 too many to me.

Boyfriend went with the mini pork osso bucco ($23), and I chose the peppercorn filet ($29). 

The presentation was beautiful. We both had a mix of whipped regular and sweet potato that was fantasic, and a really good veggie side that included many fresh vegetables (squash, zucchini, red peppers, green beans) and was spiced up with what tasted like some creole seasoning. They were delicious. The osso buco was fall off the bone tender, in an absolutely amazing blackberry sauce. One bite of his, and I was afraid I ordered wrong. But, my filet was cooked perfectly, fork tender, and the peppercorns and sauce were absolutely to die for. My only ""complaint"" was I wish there had been a petit filet offered, as I took half of my filet home. I can't decide whose dinner I loved more, they were both delicious and perfectly prepared.

Our server was present the perfect amount. We never felt like she was hovering or driving us crazy, and whenever we seemed to want something (more water, another martini) she seemed to intuitly know and be right there. 

As we were finishing our meal, the owner came out and introduced herself to us (but alas, I forgot her name) and we chatted about the menu, their use of fresh ingredients, etc., quite a bit. She went over the dessert menu with us, which was great for me as it was my birthday. I was definitely ordering dessert. The only problem? Which one? We chose the chef's selection ($10) and left it in the chef's hands.  Out came our plate with enough dessert for 4 people. We had the apple peach streudel with cinnamon (our top favorite, it was absolutely amazing), thhe white chocolate raspberry bread pudding, which was simply divine, the hybiscus creme brulee, which competed with the streudel for favorite, it was the best creme brulee we have ever had, and we not only order it quite a bit, we cook it often ourselves. While still being thick and creamy - it was lighter than most, and the hibiscus added the nicest, cleanest flavor. Divine. There was also creme de menthe bread pudding. It tasted really good, and the bread pudding consistency was perfect, but it was a little too rich for both of us. And last, but certainly not least, there was what I am pretty confident was homemade vanilla ice cream. It complimented the streudel very nicely. There were also pretty little sugar and chocolate designs standing up in the desserts. Very chic and gourmet. 

Since the closing down of Bleu Gourmet and then Rosemary's, - we were both so excited to find this little gem. I love amazing food, and as a Vegas native, I love going to restaraunts that are locally owned and operated. 

The location won't stop me - it's easy to get to. They do need to work on their music selection. It was kind of weird to be in a quaint, gourmet little room and hear Brittney Spears ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" and that ""Call Me Maybe"" song. Jazz, Classical, American Standards, anything would have been better!

We'll be back.",SnJtzOlG9cbjmfI27nJjiw,1,1,5,3QkB9BrXE-FjFfoiHpmdzA

225084,2014-07-22,0,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"The food was excellent. The service subpar. Went in on Mother's Day with 2 friends. We had reservations that they weren't able to find but was seated within 5 min nonetheless. The person who seated us took our drink orders, but we never got drinks. 20 min goes by before our server comes to our table to take our drink orders. 

After waiting what seemed like an eternity, we were finally able to order. 2 of us ordered burgers, one medium the other medium rare. The server initially was going to give us the right burgers, but after second guessing, mixed up our burgers. 

When the bill came, we were charged incorrectly. The server claimed to only work nights, but even though we were having brunch, charged us dinner prices. 

To the restaurant's credit, the owner from the commercial, came to our table to amends by offering us chocolate martinis, but after spending 1.5 hours there, it was time to go. 

Despite the great food and excellent bloody Marys, I can't say I'll return.",z8tnaRCshhjfJHMDfjhFsQ,1,0,2,g1xHHUWpbu3AbxScBWizig
265684,2010-07-06,0,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"I like Elements less for the food (although it is delicious) and more for the Martinis and atmosphere. We felt very welcomed and at home there, and our server was very helpful. The pastry chef/owner even came over to help us make our dessert selections!

I also loved the ""Martini Card"" which not only allows you to remember which martinis you've already ordered, but gives you the 12th one for free! 

The food (and especially the desserts) are very special because the chefs take the time and care to try to make them a little healthier for the customers (using olive oil instead of butter, allowing the natural sweetness of in season fruit to sweeten the dish rather than processed sugar) all without being pretentious and showy about it. If you didn't ask, you would probably never know. 

I definitely recommend reservations here. It's a fairly small place, and they do close a bit earlier than most other Vegas places. Although I had no trouble finding out that they closed at 9pm, and am rather confused as to why other reviewers didn't seem to notice.",WbJuDPwlDctt7QD8nQhetw,1,0,5,nZmfGDPZrCrCfZ5XIKEkhA

449109,2011-03-14,1,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"This is definitely a little hidden gem in the Southwest. If you are a Martini drinker, this is the place to be, screw Blue Martini. The Martini menu is insane, you can choose from a list of gin, vodka, rum, tequila or bourbon martinis. Each are moderately priced at $9-$11 and are 1/2 off during their happy hour from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.

The food wasn't too bad either. We ordered a variety of dishes to be able to give a fair review. They do provide complimentary bread with butter and a very interesting sauce that tasted like it was made of maple, curry and something else. The bread is made in house and was tasty for a rosemary sourdough loaf. Apparently the bread changes daily.

Appetizer - the lollipop lamb chops. Honestly they were pretty good. Three small chops served on top of lentils with a cranberries and a wine reduction.  The chops were perfectly seasoned and not bad for a appetizer size.Also got an ordered of samosas. They bring you two samosas over a bed of salad. The samosas weren't bad but it was a little to mushy for me, I like my samosas crispy!

Entree - we ordered that night's special which was a wild mushroom, chicken, shrimp risotto and house salad with pomegrante dressing. Overall the risotto wasn't bad but the chicken was a little dry and having those three items was a little too much in my opinion that it was just a plain ole risotto. 

Dessert - all desserts are made daily and changes out. This night we ordered a red velvet cake. It was very soft and moist but for some reason it reminded me of an Albertson's cake. I thought it was still good and the cream cheese frosting wasn't too sweet so I didn't feel too guilty for eating it. 

This is a great little intimate place to go on a date or just have a good night out with friends. I would recommend making reservations since the place is quite small. My only complaint is that I felt it did take a while to get our food and drinks. Maybe they didn't think we would realize after our 2nd martini! However, I would like to try to try this place again, hopefully they extend their happy hour or stay open longer since they operate from to 5 to 9:30/10 p.m. Definitely a great place for Martinis!

479599,2014-06-15,1,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"I came here on a Sunday with 9 friends for brunch and ""bottomless"" mimosas. Off the bat I got a bad taste in my mouth cause the waitress refused to give me any sort of list on the 500 mimosa flavors they offer. 
I started with a strawberry mimosa and ordered the breakfast burrito. Both were just ok. The burrito was very bland and had no cheese (which it's supposed to come with) and the mimosa had very little strawberry flavor. 
After we all ate we focused on drinking and ordered a round of pineapple upside down mimosas...25 minutes later we got them. They were good, but not worth the wait. The next round was supposed to be blackberry, but never came. In fact my husband went to the bar and saw our tray of mimosas just sitting there. About 10 minutes later we got them and they were terrible. They tasted like cough syrup. 
Next round I decided to go up to the bar myself and order directly from who I'm assuming was the owner (she was wearing regular clothes whereas everyone else was wearing a uniform). She stood there another 5 minutes drying off glasses so I asked if she was working on my order since the last one took 25 minutes. She said yes and about 10 minutes later they started making them. (This round was cranberry mimosas and were also not that great). 
After the last round they ran out of champagne. What?! If you are not prepared to serve bottomless mimosas then don't offer them. 
The service is terrible, the food is not that great and the mimosas are so so. Their only saving grace is the live duo that was performing.",4eF_8fqXrNS8ZFAhhE0SHQ,6,2,1,J4R8WXNczpUsbIk6H-Yoxg

We were seated in a tiny table for two next to a large group.  I ordered Liz's Penne Ala Vodka and my husband ordered the flank steak with Chimichurri Sauce.  Our food arrived and I took one bite of mine and sent it back immediately.  I could easily see that the chicken was BURNED in it and the dish tasted as though someone had thrown a lit cigarette into it, YUCK!  The manager came over with a menu and apologized but told me that they use smoked chicken in the dish....I asked if they always BURN smoked chicken as well then?  My husband took a bite of his dish and sent it back.  It was entirely a salt feast and there is NO WAY that was Chimichurri Sauce!  (I am from FL where we have good Chim Sauce, this stuff was SOY based!!!!) We both reviewed the menu to try to select other options when the ""DJ"" a young girl, starts playing VERY loud rap music.

Instead he returned and presented me with a completed martini containing another strong ingredient.  Next time I guess we will need to sit at the bar to speak directly to the mixologist.  And he never even asked if I liked it!!!  The food is top notch - very fresh and flavorful.  My only complaint would be the portion sizes - I left still somewhat hungry but maybe that's because it was so good I wanted to keep eating LOL.  We definitely recommend the fire/ice shrimp/scallop appetizer plate but you probably can't go wrong here with any choices.,NmygL6zSMEvDM3Y9dS5cyw,2,0,4,fqzm0--gBSgN8qa2LqS2hw

Sad that the owner is such a scum bag over the top wanna be ""wise guy"" that he won't allow this place to ever be successful .. Anyone see him on TV ? It was great to see successful smart chef and entrepreneurs put him in his place.  If you haven't seen it I highly suggest watching it on YouTube so you know what you're getting yourself into .  its funny I had high hopes and dreams for that place only to have them destroyed by Paul f.  Sad to know he's using restaurant income to pay his house bills .. Let's hope the IRS never comes to eat .

965185,2009-11-30,1,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"Went to this off-the-beaten path place for my wife's birthday.  We had about 16 of our friends gather here for drinks and tapas and had a phenomenal time at a very reasonable price.  The owner Catherine and her staff took exremely good care of us, allowing us to mingle on the patio early in the evening and sit down at a large table inside as the evening got cooler.  Initially she thought it would be too cold for us to be outside, but after we convinced her otherwise she had no problem accommodating us, having our appetizers brought outside as well, and drink orders were taken and served on the patio without any hassle.  All of the food that we sampled was absolutely delicious, receiving several rave comments from our friends as well--and I'm pretty sure it wasn't just the alcohol talking.  

Some of the more memorable dishes:

1)  Wild mushroom medley:  one of my absolute favorites, and I don't even like mushrooms that much.  My wife chose it for the vegetarian folk, but I'm pretty sure I was responsible for eating most of it.

2)  Kona beef short ribs:  I've always been a fan of coffee-braised short ribs, but these were just so succulent and tender.  I'd go back for these in a heartbeat.

3)  Moroccan lamb sausage:  interesting flavors and textures...definitely not your run-of-the-mill sausage

4)  Fried calamari:  lightly fried and very tender, what more can you ask for?

5)  Also had the jumbo shrimp marnier, samosas with a curry sauce, and spinach and feta ""triangles"" also served with the curry sauce.  It was all good.

 Unfortunately we did not have any of the large plates so I can't comment on them, but given how good the small plates were I don't really think you can go wrong.

Now onto the drinks.  The ""martini menu""  (most of these wouldn't qualify as martinis, so I use the term loosely)  is extensive, mostly featuring drinks of the sweeter variety.  However, the bartender is perfeclty willing (and capable, I might add) to make drinks to your personal tastes, so you don't have to stick with the straight menu offerings.  Regardless, all of our friends from the casual drinker to the amateur mixologist found something they liked.  And I should add that these drinks can be *stiff*.

After we had moved inside, had another round of drinks, and finished the appetizers, Catherine came by with a special birthday gift of sorts - dessert plates for the table (three total), featuring a sampler of all of their homemade desserts.  Creme brulee, brownies, bread pudding, cheesecake, and a few others I can't quite recall.  And they were all freaking fantastic.  However, I should qualify that I was feeling pretty darn good by this point in the evening, so take it for what it's worth.

Finally, the check.  We were there during happy hour so the reduced prices applied, and one of our guests characterized the total as ""crazy, but in the good way.""  He also made the most memorable comment that, ""looking at the level of drunkenness around the table, there is no way that the bill should be that low.""  Granted most of us are from the Bay Area where cocktails can be a bit spendy, but it's nice to not get sticker shock when you look at the drink total for 14 or 15 people.

Anyway, the review is a little on the long side but we had such a great time, the food and drinks were fantastic, and we were taken such good care of that I really want people to go here if they are in Las Vegas and keep these folks in business.  They are a ways off the strip so a cab is recommended if you'll be drinking, but it was definitely worth it..",_1kscLMkXZ8o27XJc_V9mw,0,0,5,E36rOEIYqykMQ8eDaKqH4A

The second visit was for happy hour! They offer $2.00 off all drink and (I believe) half off appetizers. I had the house made sangria! Super yummy with apples, oranges, peaches and raspberries. I also shared the calamari and Fire & Ice scallops and shrimp, both were very good. I'll definitely come back to this place.",xicLYs-5BIHLKQv8Hhq_ow,1,0,4,0cvN4G88-Hi0bQz7z3YTgQ

We ordered the Fire & Ice Scallops & Tiger Shrimp.  It was just spicy enough and delicious!  We also ordered the Samosa Purses and the Maple Leaf Farms Sliced Duck Breast which were both very good.  For dessert we went with the Chocolate Molten Lava Cake (see photo) which was delectable!  Catherine, one of the owners, is a total sweetheart!

Unfortunately, we had dinner two nights before New Years Eve, that was very disappointing, The bar was full, but their was only one other couple eating dinner. We noticed right away that the management had changed for the third time since we started coming here.  The menu looked different, and I had my heart set on some seafood.  
Prior to ordering our food, they brought us some thin crisps with one pat of butter, which in the past, would bring some wonderful assortment of breads?  I asked about this and the waitress stated they were out of bread?
I started to give my order for Sea Bass, but she stated that they did not have any Bass, Salmon or Duck tonight.  I jokingly asked her if I should come back tomorrow, she did not respond?
I ended up having Chicken Marsala, which I did not really want or care for the taste.
Looking back, I should have just excused ourselves and come back when they had the proper amount of food supplies.

1071993,2012-10-06,0,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"Being down the street from Elements, my partner and I always said, 'we have to try that one day,' every time we passed.  Last night was the 'one day' and I have to say I'm not sure why we waited so long.  The atmosphere was extremely pleasant and this seemed to me to be a local community type of place - each time someone came in, they were greeted promptly - and many customers were known to the staff.  The owner even came over after we began munching on the bread (which the pesto bread was amazing!)  to make us feel 'at home.'

They claim to have 300 martinis on their menu and though I didn't count, I definitely didn't doubt.  It was almost overwhelming to see the list because I wanted to try so many.  Smart of them (dangit) because the ones we had (golden delicious and love bug) were so good we have to come back to try the others.  The Mediterranean plate (with lamb meatballs, hummus, and tabouli) was great and the shrimp appetizers had great flavor (though maybe a bit overcooked for me, but my partner loved the texture).  The bbq pork bruschetta was ok - I didn't think it was a homerun per se, but it wasn't bad either.  At the end, we shared the bread pudding with raspberries on top...phenomenal! It was quite a great noshing dining experience with good food, great drinks, and incredible service.  Next time we go back, we'll try other martinis and grab a main course for food.

They do have a happy hour where you can get $2 off of martinis and appetizers between 5:00 - 6:30pm.  If you sign up to be on the mailing list, they also have a martini club where you can get your 13th free.  Yay!

came here with my hubby and had a wonderful experience, my friend referred us to here and when we arrived it was PACKED
split the special Med Platter and special burger (both on special menu on table)
we also got the chocolate lava cake as dessert
and of course a few Martini's our fav is still the Lavender one


SECOND VISIT:
on our second visit it was packed again and I was glad I called ahead to reserve a seat, this night our service was really slow, no worries we were not in a rush
we had the duck and the fish special and of course several of our fav Martini's  
even though we had a free desert via YELP we choose not to get it because we were sooooo stuffed 
the entree's are very filling


THIRD VISIT:
it was not busy and it was 7:30pm on a Thursday
I came back with some friends (a couple) from back home in town visiting.......service honestly was very lacking
they were not busy then I started bragging on Elements and how great and perfect everything is here...
the three of us got several tapas actually four different ones, the calamari, the braised short ribs, lollipop lamb chops and the duck 
of course all the food was awesome and he brought out the calamari first
they were not busy but I was still glad I asked for a table near the patio because is gets toooooooo tight at some of the other tables
I explained to the waiter that I had a Martini Card there and he said ""no worries"" and asked my friends if they had one ""I told him I am the only local"" and he said ""I'll put all the credits on your card""
the strange part about it......he never asked my name........I def would have remembered because I have the longest name ever lol
drinks were slow, looked like the bartender had a lot of regulars or his friends at the bar, once I was served the wrong flavor, I know bc I only order the Lavender one now :)
once we had finished our convo and had finished our tapas and drinks too even.....he was no where to be found.....
eventually I flagged down a busboy (who kept refilling our water which was nice) he went and found our guy and I got to cash out

not sure if hubby and I will be back.......doubt if any of our Martini Card ""punches"" ever exist.....it's not the promos it's the principle of the whole experiences

all and all this place has good food, but I feel it's too tiny and loud and people are getting turned off at the slow or forgotten service

Food: We had the shortrib / gorgonzola polenta and lamp lolly appetizers. They were very good....the polenta a tad sweet for me, but hey, it's cornmeal.  The lamb was served with lentils and cherries, which sounds odd but worked nicely.  We both had the house salad with gorgonzola dressing and agreed it was delicious.  For our entree's dude had New York strip steak au poive, and I had the crispy duck. He liked his steak but not the gristle running along the side.  The potatoes and veggies were fresh and tasty.  My duck was okay, a bit overdone, but mainly suffered from soggy skin.  This has become my #1 restaurant pet peeve, crispy skin ruined with saucing. Please, stop! 

Did you know there are 500 types of martini's in the world? Me neither.  But there are, and they all reside here.  Elements has a 5 page martini menu with creative titles as a John Hodgeman list of hobo names...though not so funny.  Still, kind of silly, kind of fun, and  HALF OFF during happy hour.  Yea!

Our server, Alex was exceptional from start to finish.

His service was impeccable; the perfect blend of knowledge and natural and accommodating service, pure perfection.

Chicken Pesto Bruschetta - totally delectable
Kobe Beef Short Rib over Gorgonzola Polenta - even more totally delectable

The Carbo test was a total success, delicious home-baked bread with butter & and the tastiest chutney I have ever had.

Chicken Jakarta - Chicken Breast with Fresh Vegetables in a Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce Served over Basmati Rice - YUM

Luiguine Elements - Tossed with Andouille Sausage, Caramelized Vidalia Onions, Mushrooms, Demi-Glace - the pasta was a tad soggy and overall a bit bland and disappointing.

The Soup was incredible - so much flavor and depth to it. Executive Chef John Goyak surprised our table with black truffle ravioli for all six of us along with calamari to start - we savored the deliciousness of each bite.

The deal breaker came a few days after the visit - they lost a pair of customers by charging $0.76 more on the tip.

We always round up the tip, like if a bill comes out as $48 and we want to pay 20%, we just pay $58 instead of $57.6 - but when we're charged $58.6 it's a red flag. We have this rigorous rule that once we see it, we'll never return to the restaurant.

It's easy to spot because all of our restaurant charges on a credit card statement have a nice round numbers, usually includes at most two significant digits. (e.g. 58 or 350 or 1200)

After trying to find a good place for coffee, I decided to give this place a shot. I came in and ordered coffee. The bartender who introduced herself as Karla, offered a drink menu right away. I wasn't looking to drink but after glancing through their menu I quickly decided on a ""man-tini"" which is exactly what Karla suggested. She was very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was pretty cool. There were about six people that seemed to be having a good time, which made me enjoy this place a bit more. I could see a gentlemen buss tables and help Karla out. I later found out his name Kevin, and he's actually the manager. It was very pleasing to see that they had a good chemistry. As far as food goes, I ordered the braised short rib and the fire and ice. The short rib was a lot better than I assumed it would be. It was so tender. By far as good as it can get. I then tried the shrimp and scallops, both of which were cooked to perfection. The spicy chipotle sauce was incredible. I'm glad I stopped at this place. I had a great time. Food was great, drinks were good and service was phenomenal! Overall a great experience.

The second time I came with a group and we each had separate checks. They put an automatic 20% gratuity on each of our bills to the price BEFORE the happy hour discount.  This surprised me as most restaurants do 15-18% and it's on the adjusted price (I'm questioning if that's even LEGAL). Will I go back? Probably not. I'm put off by the owner and sadly disappointed that each of us tipped our not so great server nearly ten dollars apiece. The food is good and the martinis are decent though not spectacular. Could be because they have 400 to choose from which the owner has made up many herself...could use a lot of tweaking. In terms of service and price there are better places to spend my money on.

Menu for brunch is limited, and made more limited by their waffle maker being broken. Many at the table opted for the breakfast burrito or the benedict (available with filet, crab, or salmon), but I chose the BRIE GRILLED CHEESE & TOMATO SOUP. Menu description states the sandwich includes tomato, but I received only a generous amount of cheese resulting in a basic and one-note sandwich of just cheese and bread. The tomato soup was sweet, oily, and rich, did not necessarily pair well with the sandwich. Highly suggest adding a side salad (a Caesar is $7 and huge) to cut the richness.  
Of the three people who opted for the breakfast burrito, only one ate more than half, which I found noteworthy.

The main appeal for brunch is their $10 bottomless Mimosa or Bloody Mary deal, with mandatory entrée purchase. They have a full bar and patio seating. Found it odd that the black linen table clothes are covered by butcher paper? Not sure what aesthetic they're going for.

First impression: we were seated at a table right in front of a door that wait staff were going in and out of (to the outdoor patio). To top it off, the table was REALLY wobbly.

Second impression: ordered the bruschetta to start...mediocre. Bread was not toasted enough thus it was soggy. Tomatoes not very flavorful.

Third impression: ordered the grilled vegetable pasta. For $18, I could have made this at home for about $5. Menu said it had mushrooms...no mushrooms. Not very flavorful, even a hint of olive oil or garlic would have helped.

Without the Groupon, our total would've been $60 for two people (2 entrees, 1 appetizer). Service was good, but the food needs major improvement to charge those prices.",bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ,4,0,2,MsoV1JPtrneLQdLL0Tu4iQ

I wish now I hadn't waited so long. They have a huge martini list I wish I could have tried, but decided against since my girlfriend and I were hungover from the night before. 

We started off with the calamari, tasted just like your typical restaurant calamari. Nothing to write home about. We also received bread as an appetizer, but tasted rather stale and was served cold. The owner was telling us her husband baked it fresh every morning which might have been the reason since it's from the morning. The steak I ordered on the other hand was amazing. Cooked perfectly medium rare packed full of flavor. The dessert menu is very unique too. Lots of stuff you won't find anywhere else like dessert coffees and martinis. My girlfriend and I got the two creme brulees and was very good. 

On a separate note, I noticed they place butcher paper over the table clothes. I know this is to prevent stains on cloths to save money from buying new ones, but it comes off cheap to me and takes away from the otherwise chic theme. Not a big deal, but just a personal observation.

lamb legs - lots of good flavor with lentil beans

duck salad - mixed greens with pieces of duck. greens were ok. duck was good.

entree:

seabass - very nice crust of seseme seeds

crispy duck - still moist and the blueberry sauce was really good with it

pork shank - very tender. kinda like pulled pork. the spicy marinara was really good. we used the chutney that came with the bread. the chutney tasted like a chinese duck sauce.

Ambiance; It's small, intimate, classy, up-scale with fresh linens & fresh flowers. To me, it's reminiscent of a NYC neighborhood restaurant. There's a bar along one side of the restaurants with ample seating & a TV on the wall set on mute for the sports junky. Steer clear of the middle tables if possible, you'll be literally sitting next to a stranger at their table just inches from yours. 
Service; Always A+. The bartenders are friendly, knowledgable & quick to suggest a martini from the list. The owners are always present & accommodating. There's no question they are vested in their business & the happiness of their guests. Catherine will undoubtedly come to your table and tease you with her low sugar (but you'd never know it) desserts. 
Food; Start with a martini-my favorite, Scooby Snack. They serve complimentary bread with a butter chutney jelly that's D-lish! Hubby & I come often & we've tried just about everything.

SCALLOPS?!! Yes please!!! It's dinner time baby! At first glance at the menu, I'm thinkin Calamari... THEN I saw the Wood grilled fire & ice scallops and shrimp! Game on!! Obvi I ordered this aaaand it was perfectly cooked! The scallops were so tender and DELICIOUS and the sauce that accompanied it was freakin' tasty as well!! Friend also ordered bruschetta, a half and half plate of Chicken Pesto bruschetta and Tomato Basil bruschetta. Both were nommy as well! 
Friend ordered the steak and although he likes his steak medium-well, I tried a bite and it was GOOD! It was crispy on the outside and it was juicy on the inside! I opted for the special of the evening which was a kind of shrimp fettuccine with a mildy spicy creamy red sauce. It wasn't bad at all - but I was pretty stuffed from the apps. 
For dessert I grabbed the last piece of triamsu and friend got the house made brownies. OH. MY. GOD. Brownies were SOOOOOOOOO good!! The brownies came out warm and ooey gooey on the inside and they was SOOOOOOOO damn delicious! HOLY COW!! My triamsu wasn't bad either, I really liked the little cookie thing it came with and the triamsu itself was nice and moist but the brownie really was THE best. Definitely try this!! !
This is a martini bar and they have a menu FULL of martini's, like A LOT!!! I decided I would try one, so I opted for the Brazilian Blue - I believe it has Stoli Blueberry, Blue Curacao, Pineapple and Pomegranate juice in it. It was OK... First I kind of thought it tasted like grape kool-aid. Friend said it tasted like medicine... I only drank about half and switched to the Red Sangria. This was OK too.. I wasn't really too blown away by either drink, but the menu is SO big, when I go back I will try something else!",Rdt-JiAN7Qlw3dJ7UVdNtw,5,3,4,W707ttAvrf4R-CDDUKvIfA

Bar filled with vibrant crowd having a great time. We ordered chicken Parmesan, penne a la vodka, bruschetta, and the fire and ice appetizer. All had excellent flavor and portions were what I would expect for the price (about $20/entree). What really stood out to me here was the service. There were 2 gentlemen who tended bar and waited the tables, we were serviced by both... Very attentive and with great personality. We were there with our 2 teenaged boys and they both made it a point to engage with them and enjoy a little friendly banter. Personality and good service goes a long way, thanks gentleman...

I had a bad feeling when they sold to new owners, the food may go downhill. The new owners did make some changes, they are now open for brunch on the weekends, and they stay open later. We went for Sunday brunch today, the menu looked decent, I ordered chicken & waffles on a recommendation. When they came out, it literally looked like Eggo waffles with two chicken fingers laid on top. I was hoping it tastes better than it looked. Nope. It tasted exactly the way it looked. I tried my best to eat it, but it was really bad. The server ended up taking it off the bill for me because she felt bad. 

You can definitely tell that the kitchen is being run by a cook who came from running some shit holes downtown (Hennesey's and Mickey Finnz).

2983501,2010-11-12,1,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"I apologize in advance for the long-winded review. But this place was Great. 

Had a lovely meal where we met the chef/owner and his wife (Katherine) who is the pastry chef. Katherine is a delight. She spent a bit of time speaking with us about her desserts and her philosophy on utilizing different types of sugar and sweetening agents. She prefers to use natural sweeteners found in fruits which is fantastic! 

The bread (baked fresh ever day) was a caramelized onion today.... The bread changes daily based on how the chef feels that day... and I'm ready to go back tomorrow based on his bread alone just to see what tomorrow's flavor is. 

Katherine likes to mix up the dessert menu as well and offers different items daily. And as a parting gift to end our meal, she brought out homemade biscotti cookies. Yum! 

So... the food.... aside from the bread which I was totally loving... we started with the Italian white bean soup which was fresh and wholesome and light. 

Then we had the short rib w/ polenta, mushrooms and veggie samosas. Mind you... all of these items except for the soup was on their appetizer menu. So, we shared appetizers and were FULL. 

Short ribs were melt in your mouth d-lish, mushrooms were sauteed and like the short rib... melt in your mouth fantastic and the veggie samosas were just like everything else... great.... light and not greasy. These were baked not fried. 

Now.. let me get back to the Mushrooms.... I try mushrooms at every ""nice"" restaurant we go to .... which is to say.... we try mushrooms at a different spot at least 12 times a year because we like eating out a lot and usually go to steak type places. These were the best darn sauteed Mushrooms ever! Now they could have come out a little hotter (temperature wise), but the flavor was Amazing and they were juicy, savory and meaty. I like meaty mushrooms not mushy and these were definitely not mushy. And there was enough mushrooms on the plate to feed 4 people... mom and I devoured them. 

Did I mention the Martinis? There's a list of over 300. Holy Martinis, Batman! Most of them looked to be on the sweet side and very dessert-like. I had the Pink Flamingo which was made with a pink grapefruit vodka and some other stuff... it tasted just like pink grapefruit juice, you couldn't taste the alcohol... very dangerous stuff. And it hit the spot to my otherwise very trying work-week. 

Oh Yea... and the Kicker... everything except for the soup was on the Happy Hour menu... so our bill was $42. You may think this is a little steep... and it probably is.... but this was not your typical Happy Hour Appetizer menu. 

Happy Hour runs Mon-Sat from 5-6:30pm where all drinks and appetizers are $2 off. 

Definitely going back... at the very least to have bread and desserts. :)",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,2,0,4,xVGNDKGKPBP70wwJp7KEDw

Elements is quite lovely in that the food is prepared differently.  For example, their soups that should have cream are thickened with potato puree instead, which is a nice change of pace.  The food is presented beautifully, all very tasty, and the drinks are no exception.  

Everything is made in-house, from dessert to drinks.  I like the fact that the chef cares what goes in to the food he makes, trying to use other alternatives than the usual fatty requirements for cooking.  Just the fact that it's made there instead of boxed up and reheated in a microwave says volumes.  

I would definitely return for some delicious food, to try their daily specials and their decadent desserts.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,2,0,3,8GxeCaVQHhJDdIJXQmuE2w

Now mind you, living in the neighborhood, this is a regular place we have been going to for a long, long time. Sorry to say, Elements in Spring Valley on Rainbow, the other night your service was simply awful. The restaurant had just opened at 4. We were there for happy hour. There was no one there yet except myself and our friends. New manager ( i think) a complete meanie and just rude. When we came in , he abruptly snapped at us & said we couldnt sit at a certain place at the bar because a ""regular"" might come in.  At first, i thought he was joking. But he was not. REALLY??!! He made us feel unwanted and uncomfortable. Good job, fool. Is all i thought. What a horrible first impression this guy made!  WOW.  But we thought it was an oversight on his part and decided to stay anyway. Funny. The ""regular"" did come in, ordered one drink and left. But then, the clueless bartender never offered us a second round to our party and we were ready and wanting to eat & drink more. Oh, and the waitress roaming around the bar and restaurant??!!! Clueless. Knock knock...anyone home? Basically, we ordered one round of drinks, some apps ( food was awful), finished one drink each, and we sat, and sat and yes, sat, to not be offered another round because the three employees were just plain clueless to taking care of customers. We paid our bill and happily went else where. Keep in mind this is a little shabby place in a strip mall and certainly needs to maintain business or it will die.  When the old owners left, Elements went down the drain. There are a milllion places in Vegas so much better.  Service must be stellar or why bother. Plus...there was a weird moldy smell at the bar area........yuck. Some advice, & from the bad reviews here since new owners have taken over,  you NEED some advice!   TAKE A LESSON or CLASSES  IN HOW TO PROVIDE excellent customer service, bring back the high quality food like the previous owners served, and maybe, just maybe, youll make it. But if this is how you run your show, youll be closed and soon. 500 martini offerings in a dump, with rude service, is meaningless. Your bad business accumen outweighs the silly martini promo.

Who can hate a place that offers endless mimosas and bloody mary's?  Not this girl, that's for sure!  A friend and I were craving a good brunch and wanted to try something new so we decided to check this place out after book marking it forever ago.  We walked in and it was pretty empty, which for some reason always makes me nervous, because shouldn't a good place be packed and have a huge wait.  Well, I learned my lesson... I definitely should not be judging this book by its cover.  

We started our meal with mimosas.  The best way to start the day in my opinion.  The menu is small, which is exactly what I need since places with pages and pages of menu can be overwhelming and take forever to sift through to figure out what you want.  The short menu helped me get straight to what I wanted.  We decided to split the beef sliders and I got the breakfast burrito.  The sliders were awesome and their fries were AMAZING.  I can truly appreciate some good french fries, and these were worth it!  My breakfast burrito was also on point.  I do wish the chorizo had more of a kick to it, but just a minor detail compared to the meal as a whole.  I LOVED the live music!! There were just two guys playing piano and saxophone and singing in the corner and it was definitely a great addition to the vibes the places was letting out! 

Another small hiccup in our visit was that we got coffee and it took a lengthy time to finally get to our table.  For how slow they were when we first entered, I was surprised by how long it took for our food to come out and our mimosas to be refilled.  But, for the prices, I honestly don't deserve to complain.  Another great thing about this place is that you can switch from mimosas to blood mary's and vice versa if you choose.  I know at most places that offer bottomless you need to stick to one, but not here!

This is a small business. Family owned and may as well be considered family staffed. You feel this when you are there as the entire staff takes great pride in what they do. They will do anything you ask that can be physically done in their kitchen (ever gone somewhere and make a simple request and they looked at you like you asked them to move mountains?)

Also, this place is not on the Strip. Which for me increases its value. I don't understand why paying for quality food, drinks and service seems so odd when people are stating they would be willing to pay for less if it was on the Strip. There are plenty of places on the Strip that charge as much or more for less if that's your aim pick one.

If you're looking for great food, great people, a memorable experience, amazing drinks and aren't pretentious enough to care its snuggled between a gas station and an apartment complex then I urge you to try this local treasure.

PS: Catherine would be the guilty one if she didn't come out after dinner and encourage people to try what is one of the best things about Elements. Home made desserts that set a standard for any bakery save a very few here in the valley.",dBUfA50kOE5hu2zeCucfTQ,0,0,5,EZ54YIFW_EndL33QpBdXSQ

The menu is much different from years ago and even from earlier this year, paid tribute by new ownership. I remember it being a funky french-Caribbean fusion at one time. Now the menu has a definite Italian leaning, so that was a surprise we were excited to explore. We kicked off with the baked Mac N Cheese and Meatballs on their small plates menu. They were still in happy hour, score!, so we tried their Ruby Red martini. The martini was good and strong. The Mac n Cheese was delish, meatballs were good, just a tad dense, but the marinara on the side was especially good. My favorite thing on that small plate was surprisingly- the garlic bread!  So good, in fact, that we ordered a side of just the garlic bread, later. Yum!! There's the slightest hint of rosemary that made it stand out from other garlic breads. They also bring a selection of breads to the table at the start of the meal. Try the flat bread crisp. It's like crispy baked cheese, topped with Parmesan and all kinds of good stuff! Loved that.

For entree, we ordered the salmon medium rare, and it came just perfectly cooked over a bed of leeks. Very good entree; my favorite things about the dish was how perfectly the salmon was cooked, the little bits of kale mixed in the leeks (wanted more!!!) and the shoestring potatoes (wanted more!!). I would order those if offered as side items. The fella tried the filet, which also came perfectly medium rare with large tasty asparagus (and you may sub out other veggies if asparagus aren't your thing.) I hear they make a mean Caesar salad, too, but will have to try that next time. Service was good, if not a little flat, so a little cheer would have put it over the top! I also felt that their menu could use a bit more variety. A smile and variety would have bumped it up to a 5 star for me, but I understand and appreciate their small local vibe and the menu restrictions that come with that.

First, we arrived to find a mostly empty restaurant. They tried to seat us at a two-person table, but my love and I prefer to sit next to each other so we asked for a bigger table and gave the reason why.

""Oh, we are expecting a reservation. I have to check.""

I'm looking around the mostly empty room and wondering if ""A"" reservation is some herd of people....

After conferring with the owner, he reseats us at a table that is a fire code violation (half way blocking a door), and starts to clear away the place settings that would allow us to sit next to each other (though I mentioned it to him before we were seated.)

He seems stressed. I whisper to my BF that maybe he'd just been yelled at or perhaps the owner threatened to chop his head off.

The martini menu is probably 7 or 8pt font size and the headings are brown on beige. If you are older than 30, it's most likely entirely illegible. It made me a little bit cranky. Common sense says.....make your menu readable. I walked it to a brighter area and picked a martini that ended up tasting a bit like a gym locker. $10 too. :-(

We came for tapas but the closest thing was under ""Appetizers."" Again, brown on beige but at least the font size was a bit bigger. But I bet my parents would have a hard time reading the menu.

The food ranged from ok to really good and maybe even awesome. But the initial experience was so off putting and the menu thing aggravated me. And the bill was expensive. And my bf's martini didn't taste like a gym locker, but it was odd and not very tasty and it's supposed to be MARTINI bar.

The first time we came was of course for the $10 unlimited mimosas or blood Mary's (10am -3pm). What a lot of ppl don't know is that you can order steak for breakfast even tho it's not on the menu. Trust me that filet is delicious and the breakfast potatoes are the perfect compliment.

Not in the mood for steak ? Try the bananas foster or the chicken and waffles! All choices are great here except the grilled cheese is made with Brie and that's just a no go for me.

Dinner is also great here especially the chicken parm-- we always, always make an order to go after brunch. Rigo is a great server along with his brother and Kev is the go to bartender! He makes the best Martinis :-)

Want a quick snack? Calamari is amazing too.

But, according to our server he doesn't have anything to do with the place. That's a smart move on his part because our meal here was a disaster. We dined here on New Years Eve. A prix fixe menu was available as was their regular menu -- changed and pared down greatly from the previous regime according to others who've dined here before.

The calimari was undercooked with the breading limp and chewy. The short rib wasn't bad -- easily the highlight of the meal -- but the reduction had a slightly sweet taste that muddled what would have been a solid savory profile. The penne a la vodka was incredibly bland with very little chicken, no basil, and a sauce no better than that from a can. It was so bad that my wife took one or two bites and pushed it away. We told our server how bad it was and he was gracious enough to take it off our bill.

The Mushroom ravioli was excellent, creamy, nice amount of garlic. You can never have to much in my book so I would have added more. The average person would be fine
The cheese plate appetizer had some great selections of cheese, nuts &  jelly that was just divine, blending unique Flavors together

They've done away with the huge selection of martinis that made Elements special. We were hoping to take advantage of Happy Hour only to be told it was $2 off drinks only, not food. The appetizer section was small and limited to mostly seafood. We ended up ordering the fried calamari which was tender and not overly greasy. I had the NY Strip Steak and hubby had the Chicken Parmesan. I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out more rare than medium but I'm not overly picky so that was fine. The sides were mashed potatoes with vegetables. Good, but nothing spectacular. The Hub's Chicken Parm was overcooked and he didn't enjoy it. I tried ordering sangria from their new limited drink menu and was told they were out so I had the house Merlot since you usually can't go wrong with that. Hubby had some sort of vodka drink that he said was just ""meh"" and that not strong. The cannoli we had for dinner was pretty good. All in all it was an ok meal but nothing compared to the original.

We dined last night at knew right away something had changed, it was the owners Jose Luis and Catherine no more.  First clue was there were only 3 tables which is unusual for a Thursday night, and there was live entertainment.  We arrived and the hostess/ FOH manager seated us and took our order for water, then our server approached and re-took our order.  There was much overlapping and re-ordering as there was no communication between FOH mgr and server.  
We ordered our cocktails and appetizer, the lamb lollipops which were 2 and ok but expensive 10.95.  My husband had the penne pasta with chicken for 17.95 which ample portion.  I ordered the special, a small chicken stuffed with prosciutto and spinach over mashed potato with steamed veggies for  24.  The food was good although the prices are strip prices!  The server was new and still learning the drinks. And food. 
What struck me is the difference in atmosphere and service.  The former staff was very professionally dressed and presented well, hair, makeup, language and overall professionalism that you would expect at a strip restaurant.   The former owners were there every night making table visits, talking about the menu items, describing the delicious desserts she made herself.   New owners please take note.  having managed two restaurants in town and survived a successful rebranding I know what it takes to make this survive.   

Please hire  upper tier  serving staff,  train them accordingly.  You have a great opportunity here to keep this rolling in a positive direction!  For being off the strip you will need to bring your prices in line with the food quality.  While FOH mgr did a fine job the training needs to filter down.  I would like to feel a seamless transition and I didn't,.  The desserts were ample and good as before.

There are a few really great ""hidden"" eateries in LV, but most of them we've heard by word of mouth. Last night, we decided to give Elements its FIRST chance.... Upon entering, we were greeted by almost everyone in the restaurant. The restaurant is amazingly decorated inside. There were a few people eating at the bar and a few in the dining room, and it was just perfect. The lights were dim and the ambiance was just right for our date night out! We immediately sat down and were served this amazing baked French bread and Kalamata bread (that our waiter informed us that was baked ""in house"" by the chef himself). It was served with a side of butter and house made chutney (that was out of this world!) Are you hungry yet???!?!? We spoke with our knowledgeable waiter (Peter) for quite some time about the menu and how it changes frequently. He suggested the proscuitto wrapped jumbo shrimp and the bruschetta which were both amazing! The only disappointment: There's never enough! :) We each ordered a drink off their extensive Martini menu, which boasts over 300 custom martinis. Yes, 300, and they are all alphabetized and described to suit YOUR needs. After another round of bread, we were still chatting it up with our waiter when Catherine, the owner came over to introduce herself and talk about the menu. She informed us of some of the specials for the night and told us that her husband, Luis, is the only solo cook in the restaurant. He's Argentinian, and very passionate about food, which we were starting to understand.. We both ordered the house salad with home-made gorganzola cheese dressing. As our main course, my husband ordered the Sea Bass, and I ordered the special Veal Scaloppine. First, the presentation of these meals were amazing! They were plated so beautifully! It was a pleasant surprise to have something this amazing NOT on the strip and without the chaos! Both were served with an amazing mashed potato (which changes frequently) and vegetables that were prepared divinely. They both came with reduction sauces that beautifully complemented each dish. I'm not a big fish eater, but the Sea Bass was encrusted with black peppercorns and just melted in your mouth. Almost by the end of our main course, the dining room was empty and basically the restaurant had closed. They close at 9:30, but continued to treat us like family all the way through dessert. By this time, we had met the head chef, and owner, Luis, who had personally come out to introduce himself. This allowed us to gush over his meals, which I think he enjoyed ;). Last course, dessert! A specialty by Catherine! She hand makes ALL of the desserts herself-in the restaurant. That's right... Everything is made in HOUSE. We tried the butterscotch bread pudding which was completely amazing! It was warm, gooey and like a slice of heaven! It was beautifully prepared and a complete pleasure to eat! Catherine had also brought out a sample of her truffles and a piece of cheesecake to go for breakfast! After dessert, Luis and Catherine sat at the bar and chatted with us for a little while, when we again, expressed how wonderful our experience was. It has definitely become a place we will go to more often and bring along friends and family! Just another reason WHY you should NEVER judge a book by it's cover!

The service was lovely, very friendly and eager to go over the menu in detail. We ordered off of the starter menu that WAS available which was very limited. The calamari here is the best we've had in town. Light, tender and cooked perfectly. We will definitely have it again!

Our main courses were quite nice.  They looked like small servings but that was deceiving.  The plates were quite large and somewhat deep so there appeared to be less food than there really was.  My Jakarta chicken was excellent.  Chicken with seasonal vegetables in a Thai peanut sauce with a nice tangy spiciness.  Perfect!  My wife enjoyed her vegetable pasta.  Mushrooms and yellow and green sautéed squash in a sun dried tomato-white wine sauce.  She didn't finish all her pasta so there was room for dessert.

I have driven past Elements plenty of time but thought nothing of it. April F. invited me out for dinner and we met up with some friends. She made a reservation but on this Wednesday night there were plenty of tables. 

I was pleasantly surprised at the creativity of the menu. Just reading through I could pick out at least 5 appetizers I wanted and 5 entrees. We decided on the braised short ribs on polenta and Pear/Gorgonzola salad to start. The short ribs were so tender and delicious!! The salad was pretty darn good. Bread came along side the appetizers which was delicious as well.

It was ladies night on Wednesday night which meant $10 off bottles of wine! Yes! High five!

For the main course, April and I split the Osso Buco (SPECTACULAR) as well as the Mussels in curry cream sauce (DELICIOUS) and the calamari (OOOH SO TENDER).

Catherine, the owner, kept coming by to check on us. Then after dinner she decided to verbally entice us with her descriptions of the desserts. There were too many to choose from so she suggested getting the chef's sampler. $16 for the popular desserts on the menu! GENIUS!!

We had the bread pudding, creme brulee,...I CAN'T Remember the rest due to the wine but all were so good!! I also had an almond joy latte which had almond, coconut and espresso. SO GOOD.

The server told us about the specials and was helpful in advising me on some martini's that would fit my taste.   I went with the Prickly Pear which was sublime!  We ordered the bruchetta with mushrooms.  We \were also served some of their yummy home baked bread with butter & chutney.  That chutney was YUMMY!  The bruchetta was late in coming but the server apologized realizing she forgot to put the order in.  It was worth the wait though.  

My husband ordered the Lobster Ravioli which he loved!  I had the Portobello  ravioli with a curry sauce. Oh. My. God.  I wanted to lick the sauce off my plate!  We ended up passing on ordering dessert (the hubby said he was too full) but our server brought us their delectable homemade carrot cake and 2 of their homemade truffles anyways!!!  Scrumptious!!!  (Our server was a doll!)

Our server was outstanding.  Really attentive, extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  Almost too much so as he tended to ramble on.  However, after the meal, the owner came out and literally tried to shove dessert down our throats and even gave us a sob story about how she had spent the morning ""slaving over a hot stove"", trying to guilt us into buying dessert.  Totally unacceptable.

The food itself was good.  It's clear the chef knows what they're doing, however with all of their entrees being 19 dollars and up, I would say it's overpriced for what you get.  If this were on or just off the strip, with a great atmosphere, their prices would be validated, but they're not.",FjtPoVSq3ek3G40C8npFNQ,1,1,3,xJAWxAiQFZQm5HR3M4-Y3A

House made bread - I love it when restaurants make their own bread and flavored butter. The bread and flat bread was so good, I had to stop myself from filling up on it. 

Mussels - I'm used to the white wine mussels but the sauce for this one was a curry coconut base. The sauce was thick and enveloped the mussels. It was really good and I would come back just for this. 

Mini Pork Osso Buco - I've had beef Osso Buco but not pork so I asked the server to tell me more. He said it was really good and tender so why not. When it came out, it was like (2) thick pork ribs. I was expecting more from this. 

Maple Liberty Duck - This dish came with (2) duck legs so it was a large portion. The duck was cooked perfectly medium and the rich berry wine sauce complemented the duck well. There was no gamey taste.

this place probably gets the 4.5 yelp stars for the wide selection of beer and martini but really gets one star from the food.  short rib on polenta was good but not very surprising or something that you would go back for.  Bruschetta was very plain though it seemed like it was famous for it which is totally not the case.  jambalaya is creole dish but nonetheless shows up in an Italian restaurant which boggles the mind.  it was okay at best because the rice was not very rich in flavor.  crispy duck is really just deep fried duck, not the pressed in a pan crispy version or roasted.  was not marinated or spiced.  the best things there were the drinks and the service which can't be argued.",Z-bTLSYSJL1qIPEusyHQUQ,1,2,2,9i0DfPO1NH5bQt2CQRCZ7A

Jose & Katheryn are always bringing new ideas for desserts and will make you something special if you ask for it and most times for no reason at all. The deserts this place offers is truly SINFUL. You will not have a better desert this side of I-15/South of Summerlin PKWY.

4492082,2012-08-16,1,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"If there was an option to give 6 or more stars for Elements...I would! Seriously, I was THAT impressed. Elements was everything I look for in fine dining...clean, amazing food, impeccable service, affordable...oh yeah & yummy (not watered down) drinks!!

I am ashamed to say that if not for a foodie group of friends I would never have tried Elements because it is not on my side of town and nothing about it would have necessarily stood out to me...MY LOSS!!

So, last night was my first time at Elements. It is sort of small, but I literally loved everything.

First, The food was amazing. It was all made to order, very fresh, a souped up version of classics. We had bruchetta for an appetizer (on homemade bread) and I had steak with veggies and mashes potatoes. I had a hard time choosing between the steak and the halibut, but the steak won. Every single thing on my plate was cooked perfectly, which surprised me because I was with a large group. My friend had the duck with a blueberry topping that looked delicious, and even though I am not typically a duck fan I was a little jealous because it looked so beautiful!! Oh, and vanilla bean panacotta with raspberry sorbet was pretty amazing too.

Secondly, they have a list of martinis that stretches from Las Vegas to the Sun and back 57 times. If there is a flavor you like you can randomly shout it out and your server will have 12 or so recommendations right off the top of his head (I was impressed). I tried the Pussycat Doll martini which was a lime, peach, and pineapple concoction. A+. Then I tried the S'mores martini which I didn't care for and only gave that a D. I was upset I didn't try the Pineapple Upside Down Martini or the Key Lime Pie Martini or the Blueberry Cheesecake Martini...let's just say I have a new bucket list goal of trying them all.

They, also, have a Martini Club that is free to join (you fill out a card and they keep it behind the bar so you will never have to worry about forgetting it). And, for every 12 you try, the 13th one is free!! I highly recommend checking out the martini menu before you go so you have an idea of what you want to try because they have OVER 450 to choose from.

And, saving the best for last...the service was out of this world!! The server was patient with our large group. He knew the menu inside out (including all 450+ martinis), no one was left waiting for anything including drink refills, and yet he wasn't all over us either. PERFECT. Also, the owner works the room, giving personal attention to each table...not because there is a problem, but just because, and that attention to detail is impressive and really goes a long way!!

It was, also, recommended to me by a fellow patron that I follow on Twitter or FB because they often plan the menu the day of based on chef whims.

I literally cannot say enough good things about this place. Elements now has a happy new home as one of my top 3 restaurants in Vegas.

When we entered the restaurant, Liz greeted us enthusiastically and asked where we'd like to sit. There was about 8 other people in the restaurant, 6 at the bar and 2 at a table in the corner, we opted to sit at the bar.

It's a tiny spot, but it had the right amount of space to get you involved with the other patrons and the bartender, who was awesome but I'll get to that later.

Liz handed us the martini menu and boy was it extensive!  Over 550 ways to make a martini,  listed in alphabetical order and by what alcohol is used (Gin, Vodka or bourbon). It was so hard to decide but I opted for a Chocolate God (tasted like spicy cake, which sounds weird but it worked with my meal), and my dinner buddy opted to get their little 3 drink deal (Absolutely Ruby, Rising Sun, and Antifreeze (which was to die for).

For dinner, I ordered the Lizs Penne a la vodka and my friend ordered the California Chicken. Both were made exceptionally well, with my pasta having just the right amount of vodka sauce and my friends veggies were crisp, the rice the perfect texture and the chicken crispy, but juicy.

For dessert, we opted to share the creme brulee which wasn't too sweet and came with a nice side of fruit.

Oh a side note, the martinis are on the strong side (or maybe I'm just a light drinker), because I ended up knocking over my glass and breaking it to which the bartender responded in a sing song voice: ""blame it on the alcohol"" and the room laughed.

All in all it was a great first time experience. After the Groupon voucher, my bill came to about $42 and I gave the bartender a hearty tip. Will definitely be going back soon!",1sghNitdObSPFhxqS5Othg,4,2,5,N9W7pCUSXFpofiLcRySZ6Q

4661238,2011-08-13,1,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"Elements is a diamond in the rough! We stopped in for dinner and drinks last night thanks to Yelp! We needed a yummy place for dinner in an area of town that we weren't familiar with. Elements did not disappoint! It is located in a strip mall, and doesn't look like much from the exterior facade, but as soon as you open the front door you are greeted with nothing but class!

The services was phenomenal, the chef's wife (and owners I assume) walked the floor of the restaurant the entire time offering explanations of all of the dishes. Her passion for food was intoxicating, or may that was the martini menu that listed over 100 hand shaken specialty martinis. I tried a Blueberry Cheesecake Martini. It was dessert in a glass- creamy and delish, finished at the bottom with actually graham cracker crumbs and blueberries. Amazing.

We tried almost all of the tapas. It was so refreshing to find a tapas bar that has broken out of the Firefly mold. Everything was delicious. 

We were going to forgo dessert, but we were surprised to find out the the chef's wife is also the pastry chef, and uses 1/2 to 3/4 less added sugar in her desserts that the main stream average. At the top of the list we found the cheesecake. The flavor changes everyday- and today's featured flavor was Chocolate Peanut Butter.

Creamy and light, this cheesecake was to die for. It was very lightly flavored with an all natural peanut butter, and then drizzled with a chocolate sauce. Served along side was some additional peanut butter (for all of us PB lovers)! 

You can't go wrong with Elements. This place is such a gem- the owners are amazing people that really do LOVE the food they cook, and it shows!",yHej125HqvQGHNvKnjiekg,1,2,5,lwnShjNrXHNYDyc4pyVzPA

During last night's visit, I understood they are in transition, (and the 400 plus martini selection will eventually be gone), but it took a long time to get a martini sitting at the bar. With an inexperienced new bartender, I asked him to pull my file card which Elements kept on file to track number of martinis ordered. (Like a punch card.) He had no idea what I was talking about. (Apparently, the new owners ditched this.) I told him I wanted a Freddy-O, and 10 minutes later tells me he couldn't find it on the drink menu. (He thought I said Jackie O.) More time waiting. My boyfriend ordered a glass of white wine, and 10 minutes later, was told that they were no longer carrying that bottle, and had to substitute with another one.  After seeing a kitchen crew member talking outside of the kitchen for 20 minutes talking to another employee I knew ordering dinner there would be a big mistake. 

Last year, I bought a groupon for Elements and had a fifteen dollar discount. I presented it to the bartender asking if I could use it. He took the voucher from me, questioned the validity of it to another bartender, helped another bar customer,  and never returned to us.

We came on to visit some friends from out of town and our friends chose this place to eat at. When I 1st arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the decor, it didn't look like it was going to be as nice as it was from the outside. The only negative I can say from the entire experience was that I didn't get my soda refilled unless I asked for it to be refilled. I've worked in the hospitality industry since I was 15 and that's a big deal to me if I can't get my drink refilled. I didn't take any stars away for that only because I was the designated driver that night and my wife amd our 2 friends (other couple) were drinking martinis and wine and not once did they have to ask for another drink on their own. The server was VERY attentive to the bar drinks so I let the soda issue slide. Food was fantastic and desserts were good as well. We were staying at New York, New York and this place was WAY cheaper tham a strip restaurant of it's caliber. Although it wasn't cheap but you get more for your money here than you would on the strip which is why our friends insisted we meet them by their house out by Elements.

4870304,2014-06-30,2,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"Finally came here after almost a year of saying ""Oooh, that place looks good. We should try them."" with a groupon last week. 

Do you like Pokemon and Alcohol? I do. And that's why I like Elements. Their super extensive drink menu is sort of a mini-game of exploration. You'll find something you like, just by dint of the sheer variety, and they're willing to experiment for you, if you're willing to risk it. (I asked what drink used the bottle of Absolut Cilantro behind the bar, and they confessed they hadn't found one for it yet, but were open to suggestions). The staff didn't just leave me with the small tome, either; even the new guy was happy to talk drinks. Heck yes, thought I, this will be fun. It was.

We weren't super hungry sat at the bar, and got 2 appetizers and a martini a-piece. The restaurant is small and intimate, and though they have a patio, it was the sort of Vegas windy that could toss a Prius, so we opted for inside, and shimmied up to the bar for a snack. 

We were greeted right away by who I believe was the owner, and the bartender, and given the option to order up, or take our time; they are aware how huge their drink menu is. Our bartender was really nervous, because it was his first day. So we reassured him that we, too, like normal humans, have had first days, and he and the owner offered to help us pick a drink or come back in a few.

We opted to just try something, and set to arguing over apps. We are not Sweet Cocktail people, and one of the reasons we've never pulled the trigger on Elements was a fear of the 6 oz Chocolate GirlyTini syndrome. But Elements had something for us. I had something called a Glacial Ice, and my husband had a Beanie Baby. Both were herbal and cold and really well made. We enjoyed them immensely. Great job, First Day Bartender!

They were out of the first appetizer we ordered, but the ""runner up"" was probably better anyway, and we had the Fire and Ice shrimp and scallops, and the Beef Tartare. I wanted to eat all the tartare by myself but I didn't because I am a good and loving wife. The shrimp and scallops...I thought was pretty decent, with the disclaimer that in general I do not like shrimp or scallops or any member of the ""boingy"" seafood family. My husband does; this was our compromise app. The spice was really nice; hot but flavorful, and the shrimp was actually pretty damn good for someone who doesn't usually like shrimp. I didn't like it as well as the tartare, but that was pretty much a given. My husband, who grew up in Daytona and has Strong Opinions About Seafood declared the shrimp excellent, the scallops ""not bad"", the sauce, gone. I saw another person had ordered the beef shortrib and really want to try that next time I'm back, which I definitely will be. This seems like the perfect place to take a group of hard-to please friends, especially girls.

I am not very good at being a girl; I tend to prefer sidecars and whiskey and scotch to Flirtinis or Slushie Mangoritas. But I have lots of friends who love these things, which creates a problem when we want to get our mellow drink on; Either I'm miserable or they are. Now I can take them to Elements! They can have their chocolate Tia Maria Almond cocoa...whatever, and be overjoyed at it having found it, and I'm ordering the Green Fairy, or the Quattro-Tini, or the Roadrunner...next time I go.

Can't wait to head back. 

Pros:
- Alcoholic Pokemon
- Good food, and folk and atmosphere. 
- Easy parking
- Normal Human drink sizes. None of this Fishbowl BS.

Cons:
- Little bit on the pricy side for some items for a neighborhood joint; I'm not sure I could afford drinks AND dinner. Just dinner'd be a moderate price point, or just drinks and apps as we did would also be moderate. But I doubt I'll be trying dinner here unless someone else is buying, just because I'm coming here for drinks.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,3,1,4,TNJbxE2JqjJhfdtfO8mfpA

It's located in a small strip center surrounded by a large variety of shops. A new date suggested it as she lived in the area. I Yelped it and
Could not determine what to expect.
Well much to my surprise it was a rare find. The food was 5 stars in quality, 4 1/2 stars in quantity and slightly over priced. The main attraction seems to be their list of 500 different Martinis, I never drink ,and starting at 7 pm live jazz saxophone music tucked away in the corner. Just the right soft volume . The restaurant is very small with mostly bar service and just enough tables for the week day crowd. The service was excellent. The menu provides an able selection including duck, to my surprise. The beef stroganoff was one of the special of the day . At $16.95 is was delightful.

The appeal for me initially was the $10 bottomless mimosa and Bloody Mary option, with the purchase of an entree.  This sounded to me like something a lot of my friends would enjoy, and I thought it would be a nice way to start my birthday.

We arrived a few minutes before they opened, with a party of 10, and silly me had actually forgotten to make the reservation, but they were very accommodating, putting two tables together for us right away.  

Our server, Rigo, was very polite and attentive, taking good care of us, in addition to the other tables that arrived while we were there.  He never let our Bloody Mary glasses stay empty for more than a minute or two.  

I unfortunately didn't catch the bartender's name, but she was great too.  She makes a mean Bloody Mary!  They were really good.

The food was good as well. They have a super limited menu for brunch, made a bit more limited by having a broken waffle iron.  The prices were for me, honestly, a little high, but the quality of the food was good for the cost.  I ordered the Bennie with the filet and potatoes.  It was very filling, and delicious.  The steak was seasoned well, and cooked just a hare over the mid-rare I asked for, but only on the second bennie.  The first one was mid-rare with a perfectly poached egg.  The second bennie was a bit more medium to well, and the egg was slightly over cooked, but it was still full of flavor.  

The rest of the party seemed to enjoy their food as well.  The breakfast burritos were huge, and we ended up taking half home.  

Given how close this place is, I would definitely come back again, maybe to try out the actual menu and happy hour specials they offer.  

Brunch was good though, and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,3,1,4,4EyCXITmCoEJ0ubFYMlcAw

5279185,2016-04-11,5,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"More than once taking the bait of a Chef inviting me in - sight unseen - to experience his or her restaurant, I'd be hard-pressed to name a more unique set of circumstances than those that led to dinner at ""Elements Fine Casual Dining & Cocktails"" Saturday night and although the name Jon VanHusen may not carry the same weight as Alex Stratta there is no doubt the 30-year old native of Northern New York has some serious kitchen skills of his own that are soon to be launched on the restaurant's Spring menu.

At one time a popular hangout for the upper-middle class living near the junction of Tropicana and South Rainbow, the wordy-titled restaurant having undoubtedly gone through its fair share of mundane menus and troubles since the heights of its success, new ownership smartly decided to reach out for assistance in the early part of 2016, and led to VanHusen through Chef Johnny Church the hirsuit youngster undoubtedly comes highly touted by several local kitchen vets of whom he speaks fondly, his presence at local Farmer's Markets also showing the sort of appreciation common amongst his peers for premium ingredients sourced by local purveyors and Intuitive Forager Kerry Clasby.

Not yet given the chance to fully reinvent the menu, several Italian standards still predominating alongside soups, salads, burgers and daily specials, it was actually Chef Jon's volunteering to show the Los Angeles Kings season finale that lured me into Elements and although the interior is in dire need of some upgrades, as is the music, the vibe wass nonetheless calm and pleasant while service proved surprisingly competent despite a young lady only on her second day in.

Unenthusiastic about the main room's options, though a few bar-bites and snacks proved quite delicious with Coconut Shrimp bathed in sweet Mayo not decidedly different from Asian Walnut Prawns while the Meatballs and Marinara are a veritable steal for just four bucks, it was with deference to VanHusen that the rest of the meal was served carte-blanche and starting things off with a bit of gametime popcorn it was not long before I was smiling despite my team's consistent failings, the simple Nicoise Salad not looking to reinvent the wheel but at the same time performing better than most as ruby-red cubes of seared Tuna melted on the tongue next to a hardboiled egg, tender potatoes, olive tapenade, snappy vegetables and cornichons.

From here on offering only one item from the current menu, a row of Cannolis next to Brûléed bananas that compete with Chris Palmeri's for best in town, tuna was followed by thinly sliced Lamb Carpaccio whose intrinsic grassiness was allowed to shine beneath citrus yogurt, fresh garlic and pita crumbs, the Mediterranean flavors leaping off the plate as if to give notice that Spring has finally come.

With rain again falling outdoors, the crowd small and full of regulars including the owner who sat near the kitchen at the bar, savories concluded with VanHusen's nightly special of New York Strip grilled just shy of medium alongside a duo of side dishes, the spring pea risotto toothsome yet smooth with bright vegetal notes and an air of mint while the skillet cornbread was really quite spectacular as the base ate like a fallen soufflé beneath a caramelized top of molten butter and brown sugar.

Stating that a portion of the new menu would be served ""family style,"" desserts particularly prone to such service as many only seem to want a few bites of something sweet to end the night, VanHusen's first dessert was an updated look at his well-regarded cannolis, and although perhaps not as texturally compelling as the cylindrical version served in comparison the flavor was virtually spot-on as smooth mascarpone was enlivened by orange zest and mint plus shaved dark chocolate alongside seasonal berries.

Most assuredly not the sort of person to skimp on desserts, the grand finale often at least as relevant as the savories served before, it was with good fortune that a request to see more was a challenge Chef Jon was ready to accept, for as good as the rest had been nothing could have prepared me for the plate of Praline Brownies that may just be the city's best new dessert offering, each fudgy wedge topped in caramelized banana peanut butter and a ball of malted ice cream with crunchy almond rocca adding texture as a perfume of cinnamon helps to lighten the heft.

Taking it upon himself to adlib one last plate, grilled Angel-food cake served next to dollops of smooth espuma and kumquats a lighter, more elegant dish better suited for one, it was after a long conversation about his history and the local dining scene that the Chef returned to the kitchen to scrub down and retire for the evening, perhaps to even catch a few Zzzs before returning the next day for Sunday brunch.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,6,4,i8c8bccMDxAe_nlc-5PTog

I had driven by Elements numerous times and thought this would be the perfect occasion to give it a shot.

We arrived at 5 for the Happy Hour ($2 off all Martinis and Appetizers) and stayed until close. The martini list is about 8 pages long and the girls and I had a great time reading through all the descriptions and deciding which ones to order. I don't remember the names now but all of our Martinis were strong and delicious. 

For the food, we stuck to the appetizers: 

Soup - Both the girls got the soup of the day which was a pasta fagioli and raved about it. It smelled delicious but I didn't actually try it.

Bruschetta - apparently the topping changes daily - our visit included venison sausage and caramelized onions - This was really delicious but I enjoy a topping that softens the baguette a little bit so a drizzle of olive oil or something would have made this just a tad better for me. 

Vermont Goat Cheese Salad - I really enjoyed this refreshing salad with flavors that blended very well together. The marinated bell peppers and mandarin oranges were perfectly matched with the creamy goat cheese. 

Kona Beef Short Rib over Gorgonzola Polenta - This was FANTASTIC! I want to go back and get it again ASAP.

For dessert we had a pair of mini creme brulees - one with fresh kiwi on the bottom and the other with a cinnamon apple mixture on the bottom.  We also shared two 250ml bottles of a Strawberry Champagne that was highly recommended to us by the servers. The champagne was a refreshing treat for the end of our meal and had pureed strawberries in it that tasted wonderfully fresh and not too sweet. 

This service at this restaurant was simply wonderful - both the Owners made many visits to our table to make sure they could answer any questions about the menu, make suggestions for us, or just ensure we were enjoying ourselves and the food.

We sampled a few different appetizers, including the calamari, kona beef short ribs over gorgonzola polenta, bruschetta, and the veal & pork albondigas.  Everything was prepared perfectly, but the short ribs & polenta were absolutely spectacular!  The polenta was a bite of rich and creamy bliss.  The tomato sauce from the albondigas was bursting with flavor, so we decided to hang on to the dish for dipping our bread.  

They offer 400+ different martinis to choose from.  I don't like sweet martinis, so I tried the ""Hot N Dirty"" (Absolut Peppar, dry vermouth, olive juice) and the ""Spicy Almond"" (Absolut Peppar,Frangelico,dry vermouth,& an almond stuffed olive), which were both delish.  Next time I plan to try ""Deb's Blood, Sweat, & Tears"", which is Absolut Peppar, Tomato Juice, Olive stuffed with horseradish, & a pickled green bean.  The stuffed olives are my fav; I could make a meal of those!  They also keep a file at the bar for everything that you order in case you forget.

The only thing that tops the food and drink is their service.  Everyone, especially the owners, is over the top nice and super friendly.  The staff was very knowledgeable and eager to make recommendations.  Catherine, the owner, stopped by to tell us her special fat free dessert creation for the evening, which we promptly requested.

I look forward to telling my friends and bringing out of town guests to this  off the strip hidden gem.

We wanted to take him some place close, warm, welcoming & fun, with great food....even more so, great martini's. It would have been their anniversary. The family was on a mission to celebrate it & lift his spirits. A friend recommended Elements. We took a chance on it, never having been. This place was a blessing & huge boost for my dad. He started with a martini flight trio. He moved on to a Grey Goose extra dirty. His favorite was the chachacha. We had THE BEST FOOD. There was a succulent shrimp & scallop appetizer, curried new zealand green lip mussels & a proscuitto, brie flatbread with fig preserves. My dad had this amazing roasted duck w/a fruity red wine  reduction glaze. I had a juicy grass fed black angus filet. I wanted to taste my brother's halibut dressed with & I quote,""A creamy yet delicate miso ponzu sauce."" He wouldn't let me. I think he licked his plate :-)
Most importantly, the staff was everything we had hoped for. They were able to make my dad feel accommodated &  at home. We felt like part of Element's happy, fun loving family.

5529507,2012-05-06,12,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"This is easily the best gourmet restaurant near my home.  Not only do they have 400 different martinis to try out but they also keep track of the ones via customer card that you've tried before.  Let's be honest.  Who really remembers the quality of their martini after the 3rd one anyways?  $2 off all martinis and appetizers during happy hour (5pm-6:30pm) is a terrific reason to stay a while.  

Walking into Elements reminds me of some of the restaurants located in Brooklyn, NY of all places.  The close but comfortable atmosphere with the new cabin type look would totally fit in and thrive on Smith St or on Atlantic Ave.  Just ignore the fact you can see the Terrible Herbst gas station from the north side windows :P    

My wife got the ""Jumbo Shrimp Marnier"": shrimp wrapped in prosciutto di parma, Thai basil, orange juice, Grand Marnier, served on a bed of greens.  That was really done well and we both felt the shrimp almost had a lobstery quality of taste to it.  I can't remember the last time we had shrimp cooked with Grand Marnier so that was the biggest reason.  I might have to give this a whirl at home.

I got the ""Prince Edward Island Mussels"": sauteed with coconut milk, yellow masala curry, fennel, basil and white wine.  Mother of god!  Amazing!  The sauce was so out of this world that I asked to box it so I could figure out some way to eat it later (ended up having it with pasta which was great).  I hadn't eaten mussels in quite a while and this reminded why I should more often.  Curry and mussels were a magnificent combination!

They don't call the main course ""entrees"" on their menu.  They're called the ""main event"".  My wife and I hemmed and hawed for a while over them before settling on the mini pork osso buco for her and the crispy roasted duck for me.  This was a main event as worthy as Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage versus Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat.  Both came with sauteed veggies and an interesting take on sweet potatoes that kind of tasted like turkey stuffing.  I wondered if I was still in Vegas after my first delicious bite of the potatoes but then saw the gas station.  

The osso buco was tender and full of flavor.  They were cooked with thyme, red wine and plum chipotle and were excellent.   I almost never eat bird skin but the crispness of the duck coupled with the flavor of Maine blueberries and pomegranate juice left me no choice but to devour everything I could until the bones were dry.  

We even had room for dessert and a third martini.  The apple strudel was surprisingly light and flaky opposed to most I've had.  

Catherine and Jose Luis Pawelek are the heart of it all and make Elements as local as local can be.  Catherine is a terrific hostess and makes everyone feel at home while Jose is the master in the kitchen.

Anyway, yes the over 400 Martinis are a little overwhelming but I had a good time reading through all the random concoctions. I honestly was reading through them for a good 15-20 minutes and had a hard time deciding on which yummy flavor to pick....so I had 2. I started with the Beatrice French Bulldog...kind of a cosmo with a kick...I know that's kinda girly so I switched it up and went for the Man-tini. Yeah that's right..I'm a switch hitter! Both were awesome. But let's get down to the food.  I have to say it's some of THE BEST food I have had in Las Vegas or anywhere else for that matter. Homemade sun-dried tomato and pesto breads and a Caesar salad and Kona Beef Short Rib Appetizer (DAMN GOOD). For the main entrée the Chilean crusted sea bass couldn't have been any better.

Yes the reviews are true .The owner does come over and great you with suggestions for dessert. But I didn't find her pushy. She was just really good at her job and managing her restaurant . I don't even like sweets that much but I was sold and boy did my inner fat boy indulge in some Heath Cheesecake with a side chocolate truffles...MMMmmm Fat Camp..   I thought the owner was really cool and super nice and attentive. Very personal.
The place is small but the décor and atmosphere was still really top notch. We had a great waiter. Super professional and he had a lot to memorize tonight for their specials.  

I felt they paid attention to us and really took pride in their work and their restaurant. In fact when we called for our reservation, we told whoever answered the phone it was our first time there. So when my dessert came out, we actually had another cinnamon apple raisin  bread pudding dessert comp'd because it was our first visit. They must have taken notes during the reservation. It's the little things ya know.

Anyway, awesome place...would absolutely recommend to my friends. I will be going back.... Hopefully tomorrow...okay maybe not...BUT SOON!! 
If I could just somehow eat at that place but next to the Cote D'Azur then it would be 5 stars!!!",yccK3SdBkFykKmUww93GCg,3,1,4,42LfdiPUAhlbu_WutCX6Zw

A client brought in a fabulous bottle of wine from the Paso Robles area, so we stop by this place to share a bottle of wine. We paid  their small corkage fee, and had an amazing cheese platter. The hospitality and ambience were great. Will certainly come back for a full meal.",2llDnu_PTgYjVPPMPUVKqw,1,0,5,Pu6rBIh2neyCBZ5Uk8sL0A

Bread came out cold, with a subpar marmalade. That doesn't set the tone right for dinner, however I was giving them the benefit of the doubt. I heard the ""Chef's special"" described, without mention of any price & I opted for the lobster ravioli. I was assured it would be a good choice from the server. My Partner in Crime ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. 

Food comes out... Disappointed already with the outrageously small portions relative to the price (the lobster ravioli was roughly $22 & the sea bass was $32). So, as the dish is laid out in front of me, I'm thinking, ""this better explode with flavor in my mouth."" It didn't. The lobster ravioli was okay, I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it. The Chilean sea bass wasn't good either. A bit dry and flavorless. Chilean sea bass is typically an excellent choice, but the sauce that accompanied this dish wasn't anything to write home about. 

Lastly, the wonderful and passion derived dessert program Catherine created is gone. No more chefs tasting option nor are the wonderful made-from-scratch creations. They don't even have a dessert menu. Me and the PIC ended up going to grimaldis for their cheesecake. 

This place gets 2 stars only because of the new ""martini flights"" they offer. I had been here about three times before they switched owners. Sadly, I won't be back. Check came out to $90 (including 20% tip) and the experience was nothing special. I will still continue to support local & small businesses whenever possible (& when it's warranted).",uY9Q_Vw7YAJtJQA0FQJR7g,11,4,2,3znJZO7cisbX02UdPUzgJA

It took a half hour after ordering my first mimosa for me to get it and it arrived after my food. The mimosas tasted good but I had a pretty bad cheap champagne headache about an hour later. As for the food, I had a wrap that came with fries. The wrap was fine, but you could tell the fries were cooked in oil that probably should have been changed out a few days ago. I could also hear the other tables around me complaining about their food as well. They do live music, but it is too damn loud. Yelling my conversations with friends is not something I like to do at brunch. The waitress seemed to know that everything going on here sucked and she was mildly apologetic. I would not return for brunch but may give their happy hour a try since they have such a wide variety of martinis.",sD_uLJBHHozK-poMkY2l7w,5,0,1,bUAuv52BVq-z17HbdGe5tg

I came to this place for Happy Hours and dinners. Always a pleasure especially the dinner on Thursday, 12/26/2013. The holiday special: Surf and Turf (Tomahawk ribeye and king crabs) and lemon base seasoning sea bass WERE phenomenon!!
  
I therefore took my friend who loves fish and seafood here tonight and ordered the same things. I called before we arrived to make sure they still serve (Tomahawk ribeye and king crabs). Before I ordered, I confirmed with our server, Barry, for the sea bass. Barry told us sea bass is always on the menu.

I hate to say that, but the fish was chewy and definitely not sea bass. I showed Barry the picture I took last time as I am a Yelper and never skip the picture of good food. Barry was not attentive and told me next time just to show the picture first and the kitchen will make the same fish. -- If it's a dish always on the menu, why do the costumers need to show the picture to make sure getting the same food and quality??

The disaster hasn't ended. The steak was way too raw that we didn't even finish a quarter. The king crabs were warm in most of part but with dry and FROZEN part. 

Our server, Barry, only had 3 tables at that time, and he spent 98% of his attention on one person of one of these 3 tables. After I reflected him about the fish and showed him the picture and after he witnessed the untouched steak, he just avoided my table!! Barry apparently doesn't care about the clients like the previous servers I met here before.

The only right thing for tonight is the food runner, RIGO, who is awesome, professional, and much more attentive than Barry. RIGO greeted every table he served, made sure the guests were satisfied, and RIGO was the only person who asked us about the untouched steak. -- Thumb up for RIGO!!
  
I am not going back to this place no matter how much I lovED it when there is no consistency of food and welcoming service. I have better way to spend my $100 + bills.",BFFDzZR0ixxD3azljG5ysA,13,1,1,EZ3OZb5EKlsGSkbigus_MQ
5847968,2014-09-02,0,rZwq4LBO0p9m9zJ2zSEKNQ,"Elements is a place that has me kinda confused with it's identity. Once inside you see the bar/lounge. It's comfy to kinda tight spaced. Immediately to the left the dining area appears like a fine dining restaurant. White tablecloths, wine glasses on the tables. But on the tabletops are brown wrapping paper. If you don't have a budget to change and clean white table clothes either top them with glass or better yet just get rid of them. Also devoid of any condiments like salt and pepper. Just an unlit candle holder.

 Only 2 tables served during my visit but it's a holiday and I like less distractions... the design of the place makes any bar talk audible throughout the place; also sounds from the kitchen. The server was a one woman show and very good at menu description, attentiveness and personality. The menu has some nice appetizers on it including scallops and calamari but i try to keep to a budget of $25 for 1 person. I ordered the day's soup which was Cream of Broccoli Asparagus. The server warned me it didn't have chunks as she liked it and she was right; it was a puree, sadly. Good taste and consistency but deserved more. For an entree I chose the Elements Jambalaya dish. It was good but at $19 it should stand out. The portion was fine, there were enough shrimp but they are med. sized; They should use fewer but jumbo sized to make it look impressive. It has grilled chicken and that was great... but it also said to have sausage and I found none in the dish. The rice and sauce mixture seemed sort of off. something about the rice. I like long grain and some wild rice mixed in but this was closer to a risotto. Not the ""dirty rice"" on the menu. At $12 more this dish should not lose out to a Popeye's.

 It was only one visit, I'll give it another try before I form a solid opinion but I'd make some changes to the place. 
1. Ditch the table clothes and wine glasses on tables. Go with nice placemats on wood, maybe with pictures of the feature dishes to build expectations. 
2. Get rid of that dividing half wall between  the dining and bar. Makes the place look more open and serves no function. The bar has a good vibe while the dining looks ""snooty"".
3. Re evaluate the dishes, price point and their look. The place wasn't slammed, you had the time to impress and you didn't.",AStHl7m__BTiheHzpXvmRQ,0,1,2,NrB_ebNSEwlI3ln3GQGYsw

Liked the food - the green olives hand stuffed with blue cheese and wrapped in bacon were very yummy, the Jakarta chicken dish was good (some cherry peppers would have made it spectacular) and the fire & ice appetizer was different and satisfying!  The martini sampler is a great idea and I would have loved it even more if I could have ordered any martini in the sampler.

Dislikes...nothing!!

I will definitely be back for more!",1dWLN4Mr4hKhu8MQUCKqXQ,4,3,4,aL515VYxcBKv6nDSXNlQKQ

The food was ok. There is not a lot of variety on their menu and I was fairly happy with my bagel sandwich. It was basic but decently priced. The rest of the food was not memorable either. The prime rib was drenched in sauce and no one in my party left blown away by the dining experience. They have live entertainment and the service was friendly and more attentive than on my last visit. 

Despite its convenient location I don't see myself making this a regular on the brunch rotation.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,8,3,7Iagthf2YXqgtwUevCRvzA
