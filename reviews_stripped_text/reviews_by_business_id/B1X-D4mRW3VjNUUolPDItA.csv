hard to beat the lunch special....big portions, no extra charge for the rice, and a cup of soup.  on top of that, the people are always friendly and they deliver!

449129,2012-04-05,0,B1X-D4mRW3VjNUUolPDItA,"After reading all the positive reviews, I was excited to find something other than PF Changs or Panda near my job to satisfy my Chinese craving. Yes I could have gone to Chinatown to fulfill this need but I wanted to venture out and see what else was around me. So I walked into to this cozy little joint with an open mind and taking into account what the rest of the Yelpers recommended. 

First off, lunch for $5.95 is a deal considering the portion size of their lunch plates! The owner and her son? were very nice and accommodating. She gave me a schpill about how they make their own soy sauce, garlic chili paste and chili oil. Wow this place sounded really authentic and made me look even more forward to trying their food! So on to the food..

First up, you get your choice of egg drop or hot & sour soup. I settled on egg drop. When the cup came out, I noticed how hearty the soup looked as it had peas and carrots, chunks of tofu and egg strands. This has to be good right? Wrong. The soup was flavorless and really thick. I thought adding their homemade soy sauce would help. Wrong again. Their soy sauce had no sodium. That's ok, there's nothing a little Sriracha won't fix.

Next, my General Chicken with Chicken Fried Rice plate appeared. Again pretty big portion size. Bite into the chicken..ouch I almost lost a tooth. These suckers were overcooked. I thought maybe the rice would redeem the meal. I do have to give the rice kudos because it was actually pretty decent. It was moist and fluffy. Actually had a good flavor to it. If you added soy sauce or chili, it would suck it right up. 

So overall the atmosphere and service were great. I was disappointed in the General chicken and soup. Maybe I came on a bad day? But I felt that the fried rice did redeem the meal. Perhaps on my next visit, I'll try a different dish to see if it changes my opinion.",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,3,2,3,EYZbnQ9wwDRTwsA5l48T-w

We decided to try it for lunch my family and I were there for the CES SHOW anyways everything good we're 2adults 2 teens and a 10 yr. Old at the time of getting the check my husband noticed it wasn't adding up? Why you ask.... Well when he asked the lady told us that we had a party larger than 4 so they applied a mandatory 15% gratuity?!! WTF right I asked her to show us where in the menu or their establishment it said that? All I got was a Ummm well it doesn't but we get people who don't tip. Again how is that my fault I added? She then said well you have kids. To which I replied yes I do grown that I served not you. She had no excuse for what she did other that I've been up since 6am and the people have been here to eat didn't tip me so I added a mandatory gratuity to your table. I explained that when I worked for The Butcher Shop we bad to show and mention that prior to service and if they planned on doing that they should update the menu.  We paid what was asked but plan on not going back. I honestly think they saw my hubby and I in a suit and tie and saw $$$ signs. 

Dear owner you shouldn't take out your frustration on your customers especially if they're not the ones you have beef with. We were going to leave a $7 tip but after being told that we had to pay for other peoples tips we d ecided to just leave the mandatory $5.95 .
The food was good but the I don't like owners taking advantage of nice people. 
The next day my kids wanted Chinese needless to say we went elsewhere. 

Bottom line my advice to you is beware ... You never know if the owner will decided that she's not happy how the night went and tag on an extra tip to your bill.

I wish I had just tried anything else.  But i asked for a recommendation of a dish from the  waitress.  She recommended General Tsao chicken.  The General Tsao chicken is exactly like eating a bag of candy.  Its too sweet.  I asked for a tea with little sugar.  They give me a tea full of sugar.  

Someone in this place has a sugar addiction. With Diabetese on the rise, this restaurant would be one of the culprits.  You can't please everyone, but Asian people don't eat Chinese-American food.  We prefer Asian food, food resembling food found in country of origin.  

Please don't turn meat into a glossy, shiny, ball of syrup and sugar.  

I don't think the people working there even have a clue about the differences. 

I've asked for recommendations from other restaurants in the past and they made wonderful recommendations. I don't get it.

The Orange Chicken is crispy, flavorful chunks of chicken deliciousness. It has such a sweet and succulent tangy sauce. Truly amazing. You'll never like Panda's orange chicken again lol. The Chicken Fried Rice is so light and fluffy. The veggies crisp. I didn't even put soy sauce on the Fried Rice like I normally do cuz it's so damn good. The Chicken Wings were amazing. They were marinated and had such crispyness and flavorful bites. Truly outstanding. A nice aletrnative to Buffalo Wings...which they also have. The Curry Noodles were great. Very light and perfectly spiced. The meats were tender and you can taste the different meats...not all combined as one flavor. The Thai Tea I never had before. It was so fresh and creamy tasting. I was so impressed, I drank 2 big glasses. It's great for the heat hear in Las Vgeas and as a nice sweet treat.

The cooks were having their lunch break, however, they got up and cooked our food once our order was out in. Good work you guys. We could hear and smell it from our table. Our dishes were out fresh, quick and hot.

Other than that I do recommend Mr. Beijing as they really do cook up some great food daily!",4suJsf9Q2uruOwKlnBixow,3,2,5,cQGIZxNDja4do3WWnHG31g

If you're on a budget you can't beat their lunch combos only $5.95 and their dinner combo for one only $8.95. With the lunch combo you get an entree item, fried rice, and soup. With the dinner you get an entree item, choice of noodles or fried rice, an appetizer, and choice of soup. Between the two soups they offer -egg drop and hot& sour- I'd go with the egg drop. Both times I've gone I've had the General Chicken which is pretty good, so I'd recommend that.

Unfortunately nothing really stood out to me. The fried rice was pretty blah-zay. The Orange Chicken I got with my lunch special was good quality chicken, but over battered and the breading dominated the flavor. The egg drop soup was probably the highlight of the meal as the broth was really tasty and there was a generous amount of egg in there. The service was really good as I chatted with one of the ladies in there while waiting for my food. My order didn't take much more than 5 minutes to come up which is a touch concerning considering they don't serve their food buffet style like Panda Express. It's almost like what I ordered was precooked, warmed up, and boxed. Really a 2 1/2 star review, but I'll round up in this instance. 

In a pinch for lunch I wouldn't hesitate to give Mr. Beijing another try, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to make this lunch stop.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,0,0,3,Qa-2TuBamsF65brcVAXQMw

Hot and sour soup was perfect but had a bit of a strong soy sauce flavor to it. I didn't even put soy sauce in it! Egg rolls were perfectly crunchy and fresh. The General Tsao's chicken was cooked perfectly but it was completely drenched in the  spicy orange-style sauce which was okay. The chicken pieces on top tasted perfect but the ones on bottom ended up tasting like Chinese fried chicken mixed with Fruity Pebbles cereal.

FYI: IF YOU HAVE NOT DOWNLOADED THE YELP APP TO YOUR PHONE, YOU NEED TO RIGHT NOW...ok download it after you read this review.
Coming from the gym, I pull up the Yelp app and do a search for Chinese food that was somewhere in the area of the gym.  Mr. Beijing's pops up, what caught my attention was the highlighted orange message that read ONLINE ORDERING.  Ahhh Shiggy, I can order my food before leaving the gym parking lot and by the time I drive to the restaurant my food will be ready??  Yes, yes this is what happened, I ordered my meal at (via online) at 8:11pm, I got to the restaurant at 8:21pm, the lady at the front asked if I was there for PICK UP.  I said yes, I walked over to the side to sit and wait for my food.  My buttocks barely grazed the seat before the lady yelled out PICK UP READY.  Wow, I didn't even get a chance to check-in yet, all I could say was ""Whoa, that was fast, Thank You.""

I ordered the SPECIAL DINNER C, I promised that's the name.  

The SPECIAL DINNER C comes with the following:
- choice of entrée (multiple options)
- egg drop or hot and sour soup
- choice of fried rice or chow mein
- choice of one the following: egg rolls, cream cheese wonton or friend dumplings

All for $8.95 w/ tax it comes out to $9.76, that's right under $10.


So I got the Orange Chicken entrée w/ fried rice, egg rolls and egg drop soup.  Like a kid waiting to open presents on Christmas day, I couldn't wait to get home to unwrap that plastic bag, and flip open the lids of those styrofoam containers.  And like the happy fat girl that I am, I started to do the happy dance.  Yea Buddy, flipped that 1st lid and ""POW"" a massive amount of rice and orange chicken.  More than enough for one person more like enough for 3 people.  Next lid flipped, Egg Rolls ""POW"" ok, more like ""Chime"" (2)egg rolls, with sweet and sour sauce., and the last, egg drop soup, no adjective for this one, it was egg drop soup (I'm not an egg drop soup fan, it's not my thing but it came w/ the meal.)

Looks can be deceiving, it looked super yummy but I had yet to taste it. 
Fried Rice - Fluffy, not greasy, not sticky, good flavor, the peas and carrots were not mushy, still had firmness to them, in addition to that fresh diced onions were in the dish as well.

Orange Chicken - this is always a hit or miss at Chinese fast food restaurants for example: overcooked, chewy chicken with soggy breading drowning a some kind of orange like sauce. NOT THIS CHICKEN here, yes, the chicken took a dunk in orange sauce but it still had crispiness to the breading.  A nice crunch when I bit into the chicken, tender and juicy.

Egg Rolls - Light and crispy, flaky, in my opinion no sauce is needed.  I wish I had ordered extra, they are that good.

Egg Drop - I didn't try the sorry

Overall experience, awesome place, I cannot count the amount of times that I have driven by this place.  Heck, I didn't even know it was over there but thanks to the trusty YELP app I came across this gem.  And that's why I am giving them 4stars.  I really enjoyed the food here, but the true test will be when my mom comes and visit, she is a Chinese fast food connoisseur, but for me it's still 4stars.  This is just my opinion, try it out and tell us what you think.",ikEbNrDG-0Qtmo9FFb2qwg,2,2,4,rb-n-L9ErGMXlovUrJi1yg

The long form- I've been searching lately for a good Hot and Sour Soup.  I was pleasantly surprised to find on the Eat24 site that this establishment offered one made with chicken, not seafood.  (Don't get me wrong, some of the seafood ones are great, but not what I'm looking forward to devouring.)  This soup was everything promised and much more.  I felt like I was on a magical journey to flavor town.  I have been searching for this, and I finally struck gold.

Pad Thai is traditionally a Thai dish, not Chinese and their Pad Thai was nowhere near my usual Thai specialized restaurants I frequent.  Theirs was still good, and the chicken was cooked to perfection.  It missed the spice and some flavoring I expect from my Thai places, but it was far from a disappointment.  It was definitely edible and if I need something to make a delivery minimum I won't hesitate to get it again.

The Chicken Fried Rice was amazing.  Very flavorful and so god it didn't need any extra soy sauce to flavor it.  Again the chicken was cooked to perfection, plus the veggies to rice ratio was great.

So far I have not had a place that compares with Mr. Beijing in the year I've been in Vegas.

So, Im a black guy (not the favorite of Chinese) so I wasnt expecting the royal mat from this place but being I am a cab driver, that has gone into Mr. Beijing, to let fares know I was waiting outside and the fact I (USE) to stop in on slow tip days to grab a bite, I felt, maybe, the quality might improve over time.  First of all, I am greeted by the nice lady with a look of disgust each and every time we have crossed paths.   That not deterring me, one night off work and hungry, gave this a place a shot for dinner. MISTAKE.

5186364,2014-03-02,8,B1X-D4mRW3VjNUUolPDItA,"This used to be one of a handful of places I used in my previous apartment for a quick dinner; whether it be delivery, or a quick run-in as it was really close and on my way home. One thing I particularly enjoyed & appreciated was the very friendly staff & solid service; one cpuld easily tell that it was truly family owned. Even after a few in-person visits, the main owner & cashier knows you by name after only a couple visits; even over the phone. In fact, upon my first visit, she actually aked for it first - before I'd placed my order. Little details like that makes an incredibly ardent difference for me.

Buuuuuut ......

It's definitely a hit & miss menu. I tried a handful of times to give the menu a fair chance after each order garnered one well done item, which works I suppose, but will it be worth it to the average customer to keep chugging along, ""Good Dish Log"" in hand, just because somebody may greet you personally? Actually, to be rather brusque - would even personal touches like that matter at ALL to somebody looking for chinese food in a city with a copious selection similar - and possibly better?

That doesn't mean everything is bad. The curry is always well done, though per usual with curry, one may need intestines lined with adamantium in order to get through what I consider sizeable portions. In other words, be just cognisant of the color of the crayon you pull out of the box; as it were.

One of my personal favorites almost anywhere I go are lettuce wraps - and they're an easy A+ at Mr. Beijing; easily on point with PF Changs - yet for half the price. 

The more popular items, such as Orange Chicken, General Tsu's Chicken, and Kung Pao, are again, hit or miss. They can be bland, to be sure - nothing to necessarily write home about - and yes, the battered dishes can be left soggy. Whether that's to be tacked up to not frying enough, too much sauce, elongated sitting time, or what have you - it was a commonality through most of the dishes; most of the time. Think of it as the 'Nachos Syndrome"" - the top (or in the case, the bottom,) is pretty likely to disappoint - but most of the time it's forgiven given the actual portion of substance is satisfying.

All in all, there was nary a time of regret after ordering. Are you willing to give it a try or two in order to find that handful of dishes you like? If so, you'll find it worthwhile, and get a very warm welcome and an old fashioned personal touch while doing so.",9wCf_htfipOl80iljteukg,10,11,3,vnLuF4G5I-TGBqFK_ai8Og

I like her so much that I've ordered another dumpling to go (this is the Southern style dumpling with light dough which I found a little disappointing because I was hoping for the Beijing style dumpling with heavy dough.  She knew I am not a local (locals looked differently and dressed differently).  It was so kind that I will definitely return.  Tipped her $7 dollars for a $30 dollar meal..I bet she liked that.,JaVIaX67AKkAVzNiyY77VQ,0,0,4,JSAa5pR14cphWRX8hTTzUQ

Lunch specials are all $5.95 and there are about 12 different varieties to chose from.

It looks like I am eating all this food I post lately, but Im actually feeding my neighbor who has done a lot of nice things for me lately! Me? I sample the food, but really cant eat too much of all that sodium.

So, the 'hot and sour' soup was really good with a few pieces of tofu(which I liked). And his entree was the 'orange chicken' with steamed rice(which wasn't on the lunch menu, but the waitress gave it to him anyway). And, that was pretty good, but he said the rice wasn't up to par. 

But, hey! For $5.95 and all that food, Id say it was a pretty good deal.

Nice place, was clean and kinda old school 50's diner-ish. 

Give it a try if you're in the area. I will go back and they deliver as well.",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,26,22,4,ONOpL9rJNQerZWoT1b_LxQ

Better than some of the more expensive places around the strip! Family dinner with soup, fried won tons, 2 entrees and fried rice was more than enough for a family of 3 at a reasonable prices.",xUsuvYQRmdY2cKF_LKE5-A,0,0,5,uGCQB3ljTIgFXlNM_yv0Mw
5779712,2014-04-07,0,B1X-D4mRW3VjNUUolPDItA,"In this case, the Yelp general rating and reviews here have let me down.  Nothing about Mr. Beijing was above average, I'd actually put it a little below average. They meet about what I expect for this kind of place if they are not preparing food to order.  It all tasted like buffet food that just came out of a warming tray.  The service was incredibly fast which is telling that they weren't actually cooking it to order. Stale & flavorless, barely warm, and didn't look particularly appetizing.  Generally sesame chicken is not quite so yellow, it looked more like lemon chicken with sesame seeds, but it was definitely an attempt at Sesame chicken, but the meat was stale and had an odd flavor and the sauce didn't taste like what I've come to expect and again, was mostly flavorless. The most surprising thing to me was the white rice, it was actually undercooked and crunchy. Or maybe it was dried out and overcooked from sitting around too long.  I have never had a low-end chinese restaurant screw up white rice.  I'll at least give them 2 stars because other than the rice it wasn't inedible.  I probably should only give them a single star because in my home city, a 4 star rating on a place like this would be a neighborhood favorite that cooks everything to order, and a place producing food of the quality I experienced at Mr. Beijing would only be visited by folks who don't know any better. Vegas seems to have high end overpriced places o' plenty, so I expected the standards for lower end stuff to be a bit higher.  I'm disappointed that I was wrong about that.",my8fC6L2sqvvaXUb-plvvg,0,0,2,uPgNKWZsCE-6PxECnkxZ5w

5869661,2011-08-27,1,B1X-D4mRW3VjNUUolPDItA,"overall, not horrible. 
the worst thing we had was the chicken and broc. it was pretttyyyy bad, the broc tasted undercooked and just had either a prefrozen taste or a fridge taste. i couldnt tell, just was not edible. 
the kung pow chicken was actually pretty good.
the garlic chicken however, not so much. the chicken was passable (minus the bone/cartlidge thing i got) the veggies were pretty bad though.
overall i wouldnt recommend it. its pretty hard to find and a homeless guy wanted to wash my car windows ""for $100 dollars"" so... yeah, im not going back.",7jrhS2KtnpBfewdn1mNFzw,1,1,3,BmJkcG0Hm_TxPl_2IOMe0g

When I called to complain that my rice was missing they generously offered to deliver the rice to me however it has now been 40 minutes later and the rice has not arrived. The restaurant is 15 minutes away. Despite the rice drama, the General tsos chicken that I had was very yummy and flavorful. I did enjoy the chicken but it wouldn't been a lil better with some rice. The egg drop soup was not the best I've had.

I drove out to the gate to find him in my Apts, he wasn't there. They forgot the chips for my soup that I specifically asked for, they didn't understand me in the phone. I wish I didn't pre tip them on my credit card I will never do that again. I'm my opinion tips are earned. There food was bland. I threw out the hot and sour soup cause it was to spicy and way to sour like I am eating a cup of vinegar and well I just didn't like the taste. It's sad people own restaurants and don't take pride in what they do. If your going to own a restaurant and sell food to people, make good food, and do good service. Learn English I know people may think that sounds close minded but I'm not trying to make a living in china not knowing any chinese. I'd never do that and if I did go to china id know enough Chinese to get by. They didn't understand anything I was saying and if u have ordered delivery before for a Chinese restaurant u know how annoying that can be. Waste of money and time I really wish I never ordered from them.",N26-dXhOoB3gHhX6meMMNw,1,0,1,Xc3W67H0yIfi2XRtvzjSqA
