unlike some other posters, canes chicken fingers ARE the best i have ever eaten, but they are really only a vehicle for consuming the Canes sauce!

the sweet tea is also AMAZING!  i dont live in vegas, so as im leaving, i always get a jug for the road out!

So I got the ""most popular"" combo, The Box - 3 fingers, fries, Texas toast, Cole slaw and special sauce.
I will admit the quality of the fingers is great especially for fast food. However, my fries were chewy and I could tell unlike their fingers, this particular batch wasn't fresh. The Cole slaw was nothing special (and I actually didn't even bother to finish it). The Texas toast was mediocre and I've honestly had better store bought toast. 
Lastly their sauce... when I dipped my chicken in and stuck it in my mouth, I didn't experience any fireworks or any ""wow"" effect. It didn't make me want to chug buckets full of this stuff. It was just ... eh. 
The fingers get 2 stars and 1 more star for service since the cashier greeted me with a whimsical chicken rhyme.

Another plus.....crinkle cut fries!   May not sound like a huge deal, but I've found that the crinkles in the fries increases the surface area which allows them to carry copious amounts of ketchup.....I like ketchup.

One EXTREMELY good thing is that they clean CONSTANTLY. The lobby never lacks for attention and they clean, clean, clean, behind their customers. Nothing more annoying that trying to find a seat only to see dirty tables. Not at Cane's. Also, whoever trains these kids knows their business. They are positive and professional. Very nice.

The food - Let's be honest, it's fast food. So, people need to temper their expectations with a little reality. Having said that, I like Raising Cane's. I wish they had barbecue sauce, but I can live without it. I like their fries and I like their chicken. I am quickly becoming a ""Caniac Combo"" dude.

Why the two stars? Well, this visit the chicken tasted of burnt grease. Really REALLY bad! I've worked around enough restaurants (and Lord knows I've eaten in enough) to know when the grease hasn't been changed in the fryer. This is a rookie mistake and frankly, ruined my entire meal. Gross, gross, gross. Now, because of how meticulous these guys are about so many things, this was probably a one-time oversight. So, I'll be back. If they fix it - I'll adjust my review. If they don't -  this guy is getting his money back. Period.

1098529,2014-02-05,0,gwYt_q3Ob7aQJIefIBsZiQ,"WHAT I HAD: A MEAL that included: 6 chicken fingers, cole slaw, fries, and sweet tea...

The chicken is (I THINK) cooked in peanut oil. The taste reminded me of Chic-Fil-A, which is great because there isn't a Chic-Fil-A in Las Vegas so this is as close as you can get. The overall taste was good but I could feel the greasiness of it sinking to the pit of my stomach. I am almost sure that if you ate a ton of these chicken fingers you'd get a sick feeling.

The fries were those classic crinkle cut ""Ore Ida"" fries you'd see in the grocery store's frozen food section. The fact that they were crispy and that they gave me so much of them was a plus. There were so many fries that it was the only thing on the plate that I couldn't finish.

The coleslaw was the only thing I was dissapointed in. It was rather dry and they give you a little cup of it. Cole slaw is cheap to make so I don't understand why they would give you a hug pile of fries enough to feed 3-4 people... but then give you this little itty bitty cup of coleslaw... plus there was no real tang to it. Some restaurants will add some type of pineapple juice to their coleslaw to give it a sweet tang whereas Raising Cane's is just bland.

The sweet tea: I cherish these guys for being one of about 3 or 4 restaurants in the Vegas valley that ACTUALLY has sweet tea.

I think it was about $8 or $9 for my meal, which seems pretty pricey, but the amount of fries they give you makes up for that I guess

The sauce they use is good, but to be honest I've had way better sauces with chicken fingers elsewhere and I'm more of a honey mustard type of guy. - If they could get the honey mustard that Outback Steakhouse uses on it's ""Alice Springs Chicken"" this place would be killer

The ambiance: This place is usually always PACKED from what I see. My daughter and I literally got the only table available. It has a modern ""cool"" factor because they have Spiderman 3 and other ""modern"" movie posters on the wall. I get what they're trying to do here. Their trying to appeal to the younger crowd by putting up posters of recent movies. This seems really pretentious to a 32 year old guy like me though.

Beware of douche bags coming in and out of this place! When we were there there was this loud and obnoxious group of 30-40 year old guys all dressed in cheap suits without the jacket... I kid you not, they all left at the same time and they were holding these ""Free Hugs"" posters they made themselves with a sharpie.

The menu and concept is simple. Chicken Fingers. Everything else is sides such as fries, cole slaw and an extra helping of awesome.

I popped into this location last night with some LA friends. We were hungry after an epic BBQ and Pool Party and needed to go someplace quick before our trip to the Downtown Cocktail Room (see my review on DCR).

I had the ""most popular"" box meal. 4 Chicken Fingers, Crinkle Cut fries, Texas Toast, a side of slaw, and a drink. Effing amazing. All of it. Probably really unhealthy, but my several spin classes and high mileage running this week will burn it off, so who cares.

Couple things that made the experience epic. Real crushed ice. Coke Zero in the soda fountain. Sweet tea. And the special secret dipping sauce.

And I'll admit- that was true for a number (18) of years.  I have always loved chicken fingers.  I would order them at a bowling alley, a steakhouse, a burger joint, etc. Because I was addicted.

Since then, my palate has grown and I enjoy steaks at steakhouses, burgers at burger joints and beers at bowling alleys.

However, when Raising Cane's came to Las Vegas, my excitement went full-blown and I could not WAIT to try these chicken fingers!  (Did the power's above finally hear me and create a place that would be my heaven?!?!)

With my first experience I wasn't sold on the sauce.  I like honey mustard with my chicken fingers and there being only one sauce confused me.  But I LOVED the flavor of the fingers, LOVED the crinkle-cut fries (seriously, those are the best fries!), the bread was delicious, coleslaw was good and they had Dr. Pepper!

Fast forward a few months and I gave the sauce another shot and have never looked back.

Sometimes the wait might be a tad long, but when they are fresh and cooked to order, the wait isn't so bad.

The company itself seems pretty awesome, as I always hear the owner's on the radio promoting local schools and even UNLV.

Speaking of UNLV Men's Basketball (GO REBS!), if the Rebel's win,  bring in your ticket within 24 hours of the game and get a FREE Rebel's combo.  The Rebel's combo is pretty much a children's meal: 2 chicken fingers, sauce and fries.  For Free, that is very good!

Service was very very good here, especially considering Cane's is technically a fast food joint. Everyone had a smile on their face and they were quick to pick up my trays once I was done.

The service I get here is sometimes on point and sometimes it's not. Chicken and sauce is always 100% though and that and the sweet tea is why we come. However this visit the sweet tea was a huge disappointment. It's about 5:00 on a Wednesday and the tea taste old and not as sweet as usual. I have never once had to add my own sugar and I had to.... and it just didn't taste good. We poured it out and tried for the coke and that was not a crisp refreshing coke taste. We reported to the staff that it didn't have enough syrup and they said it tasted fine. 

In case it had been just me, I wasn't going to say anything but I had watched two other people pour their coke choice into dispenser as well before reporting it to the staff. Saw the manager try the coke and say it was fine.

So besides the disgusting beverages it was good.

We went to Carl's Jr. to compare and make sure we weren't crazy and huge difference. Wish they had done the same or changed whatever or added whatever to please us and would have gotten a higher rating and maybe other people wouldn't have poured out so much Soda.",uvkN1gf9VyVArxB-8qAaoQ,2,2,3,xIY-J8KosF5E1CrHAOjPJg

In my previous neighborhood I was no where near a RC, which was a damn shame, let me tell you! After a trip to the wonderful Home Depot, we decided to have our first taste of Raising Cane's in (literally) years.

It isn't the cheapest option available but I never feel like I just got gypped off when I order there. 

Those chicken tenders are pretty damn good! For this visit we each got a combo that included 6 chicken tenders, a side of cole slaw, texas toast a slop of fries and a 32 ounce drink. This cost roughly $8 each. Not a bargain but at least you get a lot of food for that price. Besides the yummy chicken fingers, that texas toast was freaking delicious! I guess additional pieces are $1 a piece. The only thing I didn't particularly care for were the french fries. They were of the puny crinkle variety. Meh.

Also meh was the service. Not horrible, but also I felt like the young lady who assisted us was annoyed. Not quite sure if she was annoyed by our presence or something else but it was definitely a bit off putting. Maybe she was just having a bad day. 

At this price point though Raising Cane's will have to be a once in a while treat and not something I grab on a regular basis. I think this place also has the potential to move to 4 stars in the future but for the time being 3 stars feels about right.

Cane's chicken never fails to satisfy me. They're always hot right when it gets to your table. Crunchy on the outside, tasty on the inside. You can also ask for their special sauce and that goes well with everything! Fries are almost never soggy and the toast is amazing. You also can't forget about their sweet tea!

When I first drove by the construction for this store (blocks from my house), I practically peed myself in anticipation.

I still remember the first time I had Canes, I was baffled at the fact that the menu has pretty much 2 things on it, Chicken Fingers and French Fries. They only a few combos, but when you do it this good you don't need other options.

Their Chicken Fingers are great, the fries are good, the Texas Toast and cole slaw are good sides, but there are 2 things that keep bringing me back to Cane's.

#1-Cane's Sauce...I have no clue what all goes into making Canes Sauce, but I'm pretty sure it includes crack, this stuff is addictive, I like it on my chicken fingers, french fries, and toast, hell if I could get a bathtub full of it, I would!!!

#2-Lemonade...I have not drank a single serving of soda since in about 9 years, most of the time whenever I go out, I drink water, but Cane's Lemonade is AMAZING, they make it fresh every day, and it is hands down the best Lemonade I've every had at a restaurant (chain or otherwise)

3168711,2018-01-17,2,gwYt_q3Ob7aQJIefIBsZiQ,"TL;DR: a great meal, still missing something, repetitive taste

It feels a bit unusual to review a fast food place, but I might as well since there aren't any Cane's in my area. Although Raising Cane's has a reliable list of options and generous serving sizes, their food is missing a little something to making me come all the way down here for it.

I ordered the Box Combo with a Sweet Tea.

BOX COMBO (4/5)
- Good amount of food, subbed in extra toast instead of coleslaw
- Chicken not as crispy as I would've liked
- Fairly repetitive taste throughout
- Not a fan of crinkle cut fries, but they're ok

SWEET TEA (5/5)
- This is the best ice on the planet, I swear
- A great pairing to any meal at RC
- Free refills!

So many people have tried to convince me to convert to Cane's, but I just can't go all the way. While it is a great meal, I feel like it's missing a couple things to make it the best, even if I can't put my finger on it. This is the type of place I'd go to if it was in the area, but wouldn't be dying to go to.",zGvKyfU1JxmPDeqYf3CfAQ,4,1,4,KdN7ZxR7lj3ca0kCHrhhHw

The toast is really tasty and I like the fact it is not overwhelmed with butter.  The crinkly cut fries are ok but could be better.

The inside is juicy and tender due most likely to a phenomenal brining method, but the fried batter is what stands out. Surprisingly still light and not overly greasy. 
The side sauce option is good, but in my personal opinion not what makes Cane's an outstanding fast food option.

As for the rest of the sides on the menu: Greasy carbs, fried carbs and fatty greens (Toasted Texas Toasts, french fries and coleslaw). I usually skip the sides in fear of turning to carbs myself. It is just too much of it. 
If you go for a side, the Toast are good but maybe too greasy when already eating fried chicken. Fries are actually not too bad, but Cane's will never win ""Best Fries"" award. Cole slaw is better than KFC (I know. Why make a comparison to something not worth it).

As for service, the staff is always very courteous, friendly and thorough (Even though in the past they forgot 1 of my chicken fingers on a drive-thru run).

There's quite a few restaurants these days rocking the simplified menu, but I don't think any do it as well as Cane's. All they serve is fried chicken strips, and a chicken strip sandwich. Basically the only choice you have to make is how many strips you want for your meal.

I find with the sides, the standard 4 strip box combo is perfectly filling for me (and I'm a pretty big guy). The chicken is simple, but delicious and juicy. The fries are plain ol' crinkle cut, but they compliment the chicken wonderfully. You also get a side of coleslaw (decent), and a thick slice of Texas toast (awesome). 

You get a cane's sauce with your meal but I recommend ordering an extra side because it's actually really good. I've always been a fan of dipping my chicken strips in ranch and I was disappointed to find that cane's doesn't have it. It didn't take long for me to fall in love with this stuff however. I'm not sure what's in it, but it's creamy like ranch, with a nice little zest added.

Their sweet tea is awesome! I like to mix it with regular iced tea so it's a little more subtle and not too sweet. 

When Cane's is on a good day, you're food will come out incredibly hot. It's very rare for me to receive anything less than hot food, but I have been served warm strips and fries before. It was disappointing, but I haven't experienced this very often, and even when warm, the chicken is still pretty great. With the exception of a few off days, cane's is pretty consistent, which is a big reason I love the place.

I want to give a five star rating, but until cane's can guarantee hot,fresh food every time, I think four is the best I can do (which is still really great).",zFvW-hvtKJ7AAj_kZNXsBw,2,1,4,H4jq7b71AsU5Eynmw-yvTg

Seriously, what's up with the fries? It's like those fries you can just microwave. Really nothing special at all and what amazes me is that I would rather eat McDonald's French fries (& I hate McDonald's). Maybe if there fries were better I would actually wanna come here more often.

On the other hand, I do love me some Texas toast! Nice, buttery, crispy and high cholesterol toast. I could eat that all day. 

There's no hype for me about the sweet tea though. It's just sweet. A bit too sweet for my taste so I mix it with unsweetened.

Chicken strips, chicken tenders- call them what you will. The name won't add any juice or flavor to these boneless pieces of white meat, coated in bread crumbs then deep-fried to mask their dry texture and dull nature.

Ironically, in the middle of the parched Nevada desert, I found the moistest chicken strips I've ever had. The chicken was coated in a crunchy cover of breading and broke apart lightly. It came with an orange-colored, slightly tangy secret sauce that might have been some house version of thousand island. 

The crinkle-cut fries were cooked medium to medium-well, slightly crispy on the outside; ordinary, but they fulfill their purpose as a filler. The Texas toast was a unique surprise, a thick slice of buttery brioche slightly toasted outside while fluffy as feathers on the inside. 

The menu at this small fast-food chain from Louisiana is simple: 3 pieces (The 3 Finger), 4 pieces (The Box), 6 pieces (The Caniac), or 3 pieces inside a Kaiser roll (The Sandwich). All come with the toast, fries, and a drink; the 4 and 6-piece combos also have the addition of coleslaw. 

I got the 3 Finger Combo which was a good-sized lunch. For 6 bucks and some change, I learned that chicken tenders can be tender, and that food can be fast and affordable and still fit the bill for great grub.",PSflctuopnjaIWm-P_o7YQ,11,10,4,UmUk9Iz2guU-htL8nty2tw

That's my guilty pleasure and they've never given me grief when I order one for myself. 

I grew up in the South and I think their freshly brewed iced tea is legit. They have sweetened and unsweetened varieties and both are excellent. Dine in and get all the free refills you can handle. Sometimes I'll swing by just for a large cup of tea. 

This location is open very late and has a drive-thru. Kids seem to love it too. In fact, I've never met anybody who didn't love Raising Cane's. It's high quality food that's made fresh. I never mind the short wait after ordering because the food is being made just for me; it's heat lamp free.

Simple menu.  The place was teaming with people, but we were able to get a seat, so not packed.  Service was fine.  Food was fine.  We went through the drive-thru and then realized we should have ordered inside and just ate there.

If I have to be quite honest I had high expectations for this place.  It isn't bad but I think it's more hyped up than anything.  It's pretty generic chicken fingers and nothing terribly special about them.  

The concept is great.  All they service is chicken fingers.  Not a lot of restaurants have this concept where they serve one item.  If you're super hungry go for the 6 strip box but I really think the 4 strip combo box is good enough.  The size of the chicken strips are pretty large.  The coleslaw was decent at best but the Texas toast was good.

The chicken strips are a bit lackluster and dry but the Cane's sauce makes up for it.  Think of a creamy zesty ranch sauce.  The food was hot, I went through the drive-thru and it came out in a relatively timely manner.

Love how quick they get the food to me.  My husband and I shake a caniac combo.  He's a teacher so we get 20% off and it comes out to about $7.50.   Not bad for two of us to eat.   

FYI- You can swap out a cole slaw for a Texas toast of bonus canes sauce if you want.  We always get on that so we both get a toast.

There was none actually...no flavor or seasoning in the breading. Its crispy on only some parts of the fingers, big no-no for me. I really like my chicken crispy all around. To be honest, even KFC has more flavor and more crispiness and thats just sad. Chicken fingers were pretty big in size and soft however they were also borderline dry. Hence I had to dip into the canes sauce and ketchup like crazy to make the tenders more tasty and tolerable. I kinda regret ordering the caniac combo, after eating my third chicken finger, I couldn't force myself to eat anymore, just too dry, bland, and not crispy :(

The combo came with crinkle fries, which tasted good as long as I ate it with the canes sauce hehe. The sauce tastes better with the fries than the chicken itself surprisingly. The sauce sort of reminds me of thousand island dressing mixed with lime juice. The coleslaw was nothing special. The texas bread, was just toasted bread with butter.

Raising Cane's pretty much does only one entree item: chicken fingers.  Granted, they have a sandwich but it is just their chicken fingers inside a bun.  Given that they only do ONE entree, it should be good, right?  Well, mostly it's good as long as you don't eat it too often.  

The chicken fingers are usually moist and tender but when they are tough and dry (for whatever reason), they are awful.  Unfortunately, this was most the case in my last visit.

Their fries are crinkle-cut and just plain great.  If only they offered other entree items so I could enjoy their fries with a burger or non-chicken-finger sandwich.

The cole slaw is forgettable to me, but I'm not a cole slaw eater to begin with.  Even those who like cole slaw don't like it when the container is overpacked and bursts open when you touch the lid (not an unusual occurrence at any Cane's).

The Texas toast is ok but (of course) bready and really needs to be dipped in their Cane's sauce to be fully edible.  Fortunately, you are welcome to swap the toast for extra sauce or extra cole slaw.

Service always seems to be good and cheerful at every Raising Cane's I've been to.  Perhaps they add a secret ingredient to their chicken to make their employees so cheerful, or perhaps they just love serving chicken fingers.

Their texas toast is definitely something to mention.  It's awesome.  Its toasted so perfects!  I like to take a little bit of the toast, wrap it around a piece of the chicken, and dip is in the sauce.

The sauce is one of their biggest selling points here.  It's like a spicy mayo peppery sauce.  Goes hand in hand with the chicken fingers IMO!

 Interesting fact: Raising Cane's is based out in Louisiana, and part of the capital raised to start the business came from salmon fishing in Alaska.  Pretty cool, huh? On to the food!

Chicken fingers are pretty much the bulk of the menu, and they are really REALLY good!  And the batter isn't as heavy as other chicken fingers, so they don't feel all greasy when you pick them up.  And the sauce they come with?  Some kind of tangy mayo based dip that made it different than eating fingers with the usual honey mustard, BBQ or ranch, although I think you can get honey mustard at certain locations.  

I split the Caniac combo with my wife, which allowed us to have 3 fingers each, I got both sauce cups(my wife tasted the sauce but I ate most of it) and the cole slaw, split the toast and the fries and shared a large drink. Liked that the cole slaw wasn't oniony. The fries were standard crinkle cut, but they taste pretty good with the sauce!

Whether it's at a place that specializes in typically plump, tender and juicy fingers like Raising Cane's serves or whether I'm at the bowling alley eating a flat and dry piece of breaded cardboard, I usually end up satisfied.

All that being said, Raising Cane's makes a stellar example of these delicious fried treats that I have a hard time resisting.  I almost always end up with the Box Combo, which comes with a generous portion of fries, a piece of texas toast, 4 chicken fingers, and some negligible side of cole slaw.  Do people eat those?  I don't even bother asking others in my party anymore if they want it.   The texas toast usually is a good balance of toasted on the outside with with a soft middle.   The fries can be hit or miss and like a lot of restaurants can depend on if you stumble onto them fresh out the fryer.  The hotter the better.  The chicken can have the same issue, as I've had some moments where it felt like the chicken may have been sitting for a while, but this is by far not the norm.  They usually are hot and fresh as well.  I love the Cane's sauce they provide and like to mix it with the hot sauce to make my own miracle sauce.  I could bathe in this stuff.   Sure I'd have to take a shower afterwards and it'd get in some uncomfortable places.... on second thought, I would not bathe in it.  It's damn tasty though.

Service is typically fast and efficient, and the price is reasonable for the amount of calories, er food that you get with each order.  There should be one of these in every bowling alley.  3rd best idea I've had all day.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,5,5,4,FGGXbCFHsuwvtLuUjDjYAA

I definitely think price is decent and tastes are pretty consistent. Unlike other reviews the ""canes sauce"" is unique and tasty and I do like that peppery flavor.  Slaw is actually on the yuck side (you can sub another piece of butter toast in place of the slaw at no extra charge). It has really no flavor...needs something more it's just Bleh.

On that note, I don't want to scare anyone off thinking they serve raw chicken, they do not, its the difference between a medium rare steak and a medium one, just personal preference.

First on the positive side the chicken fingers were nice and juicy all white meat chicken. The order taker was helpful in explaining the menu and options but that is were I have to start on the negatives.

No spicy chicken option. They give you a pack of hot sauce but its just a regular vinegar based sauce not my favorite and not particular spicy. 

Their signature sauce is OK but nothing special. In this humble Yelpers opinion it tastes like they mixed a few condiments together. Not bad but nothing special enough to build a franchise around.

Hi can I get  a chicken sandwich with Cane sauce please?

Sure - What kind of drink would you like with that?

Huh? Who said drink? Just a sandwich with cane sauce please.

Oh OK im sorry, Sandwich Combo with no drink please pull around.

The crinkle-cut fries are usually pretty good, although once in a while they don't cook them long enough and are too soggy. The sauce is tasty and I usually am too full to even take a bite out of the Texas Toast.
