I appreciate them trying to give me great fast courteous service but I wouldn't mind at all letting this fries cook just a couple more minutes longer.

Will I be back??? HELL YES I'LL BE BACK!!! Their service alone will always bring me back. They had a little hiccup today but we all do Sometimes.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,3,qEhgcF5T_QV15NekoAKecQ

I have to eat here at least once every couple of weeks.  You should to.  Interestingly enough: you can buy a chili dog, a chili cheese dog, a chili burger, a chili cheese burger, but you can't buy a bowl of chili.",Hd5h-uSjhGzSmH2GwFybXA,2,1,5,GIuE0DKd3-yVsjfzqB7hFg

I got a corn dog and a chili dog. The corn dog was fine but the chili dog was awful. The chili tasted like old, canned chili. I don't eat drive through too often because I like to keep it pretty healthy. I don't have high expectations for drive either, but this was enough to keep me away for a long while.",KzEHXFjbayCxD12DR8ficA,0,0,2,tFRYYF8FHDnZCQF19UXbIA
