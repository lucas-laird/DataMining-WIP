Whenever Im craving for larb seen(raw beef larb) tom kueng nai(organ soup) or gang dok mai(bamboo soup) I come to sisters market to get a fixing. I hate that its so far away from my house, but whenever I'm in the downtown area I'll drop by.  

       From the outside looks like a hole in the market, but don't let that fool you. The food is great and the owner is super cool! During lunch you'll see alot of local asian people dropping by for lunch ordering some mouth watering dish. If you're not into tripe and intestine soup theres regular pho, fried rice and plenty of other rice dishes available.

The idea of going to a restaurant set up in a place like that may not seem appealing to customers who wants to go for a nice restaurant experience but the trade off is you're getting the most authentic, quality food ever! The experience is different than paying $50-100 for a plate to be seated at a nice restaurant maybe with a view and mediocre food. Here you feel welcomed like you're family and the food is very much like home cooked. The savory, satisfying taste of the food makes it all worth it! While there we ordered kow poon gai (chicken curry noodle soup), Papaya salad (Lao style w/crab), nam kao, fried beef jerky and sticky rice. Everything tasted so good! We shared between 2 people although there was enough for 4. We've been here before while in town with my family and they all enjoyed it. The owner is very friendly and personable. She takes pride in making authentic food for her family, friends and customers. I am making it a tradition to go straight there after my flight from the Bay Area since the close at 7 pm. The biggest perk is that I was able to buy some yummy snacks from the grocery store section and scored big time on natural Thai face whitening soaps for less that $5 each.

Mind blowing flavor explosions in your mouth. 
That's how I would explain the Sister's food.

Being plant based I have had zero problems getting my fix on Drunken Noodles, Papaya Salad, amazing veggie rice, veggie Pad Thai.......and I get the actual medium spice I want! :D The sisters understand no fish sauce, no meats and accommodate. 

Complex flavors in a non complex place. 

People scrunch theirs noses when I tell them where it is. Don't be a stuck up a-hole and just go here and eat.
Yes, I have had encounters with men asking me for money and water near the front of the door of the place. I dealt with it and got over it. Never had an issue parking here either. 

I usually call in my order and I usually do my pickup for lunch. Food is ready on my way there. Hot and ready with a kind smile. 

If you ask for medium, you will get medium. Peppery, spicy love. Veggies are crisp and fresh, the eggplant is soft and yummy, the noodles are abundant. Love that. Check out my photos, they will make you drool.

This is also a market and I get all my noodles, pepper paste and sriracha here. Low prices with a smile.

The staff there were extremely friendly and helpful and quite inviting. I like how ""homey"" they made it feel. It's almost like walking into your aunt's house and she's telling you to sit down so she can make you a bowl of soup. And honestly, that's exactly what they made for us. We all decided to get a bowl of the kowpiek, there was a total of 8 of us. The bowls of chicken kowpiek with blood (yes its good!) was only $8.50 a piece. SO WORTH IT. Definitely if you were in the hangover stage that we were in. ALMOST NECESSARY. We decided to grab some food to go to eat at the hotel later. We went with the pad see ew and the nao khao. The nam khao was fantastic, the pad see ew was a little dry, but it could have been because we waited to eat it a few hours later.

In the past month, I have tried nearly all their menu items as portrayed on my numerous tips. Bee, Vat and Dao's mastery of Laotian, Thai & Vietnamese recipes is just unbelievably superb. Some of the entrees are also on the fringe of Cambodian. Their recipes are not adaptations for westernized expectations.  Thus their dine-in patrons are conclusively of Asian ethnicities with the exception of American spouses.

So, for nearly 30 years, this grocery store serving SE Asian hot freshly prepared comfort foods has benefited local Laotian community and out of towners. They don't advertise and perhaps their location might scare off folks from Summerlin. LoL.  The store has no iron bars covering their windows. 

There is no other place in this Valley that can replicate Sister's Oriental Market. It's equivalent or better than having a home cooked meal in Laos, Thailand, Vietnam or even Cambodia. I know first hand since I have spent much time traveling in three of the mentioned countries.

Sister's Oriental Market is open every day from 10 to 7 and Sundays 10 to 6. On national holidays, call ahead for hours.  Plenty of parking.

To fully enjoy their foods, their culture eat foods on the spicy ""medium"" side.  So, first start out at ""mild"". ""Medium"" to those born here would be considered extremely spicy. Everyone speaks perfect English.  So, openly express your particular culinary concerns.

It all looks good ... So, eat it and enjoy like I have!!",mkbx55W8B8aPLgDqex7qgg,30,26,5,juH0EpPRJ58U43aDGO67AQ

The drunken beef noodle dish was ordered mildly spicy and it had a nice kick. Each dish is made with or without spice to your personal taste. Wow was the noodle dish our favorite. The Tom Yum soup was perfect with at ten shrimp in the soup bowl for four. The flavor was the best we ever had including eating in NYC. We dare the yelp readers to find better soup. My husband had them provide hot fish sauce so he can add it as he likes to his dishes. The red curry and ta po curry were delicious. We tried a samples before ordering.

1. They have a little Laotian/Thai restaurant inside the market that makes home style food that brings back wonderful memories of mamma's cooking. My mamma is 2000 miles away and it's nice to have found a great substitution until my next visit to the Midwest.
2. They have my favorite soup of all time, a Laotian chicken noodle soup that consists of bomb a$$ broth, home made tapioca a noodles, cilantro, ginger, home made roasted chili sauce, and topped with fried shallots and garlic.
3. The place is pretty clean, and they proudly display their 'A' rating.
4. It's a ma and pa type of shop/restaurant, ran by a very nice husband and wife team.
5. The food is freaking delicious.

So I met them up. Sista had already ordered her tripe soup. I'm not into tripe but I tried the broth and it was tasty. My Lao daughter got the kao biek! It was SO good! She doesn't like veggies so there wasn't any cilantro or green onions in it but the broth was delish and the noodles were nommy too. I put in an order for Nam and Papaya Salad... Is it Lao style? Yes. Do I want crab in it? No thanks. I ordered Medium spice... However she interpreted that, it came out nice and spicy! Made my nose run and crave for more! The papaya salad it served with cabbage on the side - if you want pork rinds, you're in a Lao store and can buy a package. I should have! There are also pieces of that green bean in the papaya salad.. Matua.. However you spell it - it's delish! The Nam came out with cilantro and lettuce leaves on the side and the nam itself was topped with crispy red peppers. Make my nose drip some more! I'm eatin' good! There are little slivers of I think ginger in the Nam too which I dodnt care for much just cuz you know when you get a mouthful of ginger it is rather overpowering and unpleasant. For me anyway.
They have quite a bit more food here than your typical Lao store where you can just order a few things or there are some items in the fridge that were previously made. I like it! I will definitely be back to try the Larb Gai and get some more Kao biek. And papaya salad. And nam... =) 
And some nice man thought my sista was SO fione he bought our lunch! Score!

Beef lad nah- had hair in it and beef was pink, not sure if that's good to eat
Nam - so much ginger that it's all you taste
Khao pik - no taste
Phad Thai chicken was slimey
Papaya salad- just not the same as it used to be
Basil chicken with egg- picture had two eggs, mine came with one. It tasted like boiled ground chicken. That's it, not salty, nothing just watered down chicken.
Beef jerky- which came out straight from the microwave. Was actually heated twice. 
Green Chicken Curry- flavor was good, eggplants were super old and hard, literally bits of chicken. Lots of bones


Super sad that the owner is no longer cooking. I'll just go to the Lao Asian Store on Desert Inn and Mohave.

We went with the the staple for our maiden voyage - sticky rice, papaya salad, and beef jerky.  Sticky rice was cooked perfectly- not too sticky and not too mushy.  Papaya salad wasn't acidic enough for me.  I like it WAAAY acidic though.  Just a personal preference.  ""B"" (our waitress & cook) kindly fixed it for me.  Very much appreciated.  Beef Jerky was well seasoned. 

We went back for more of the staple on subsequent trips and have also tried nem khao, beef larb, sandwich, and sticky rice with bananas.  All good.  So many more things to try.  We will eventually make it through the menu.  

As others have mentioned & pictures show, this place is primarily a grocery store that happens to serve food.  There are a few tables & chairs in the middle of the store.

The beef jerky, chicken larb, kow piack (chicken noodle soup), papaya salad, bamboo salad, the pork stew with hard boiled egg, and omelette.  All amazing.  And you just grab your drinks from the fridge.

Kinda funny when you pay for the meal it seems like they just count up the plates and do some calculation and that's what you pay for.  It's all pretty inexpensive so if you're tired of the high prices for food off the strip and you want Laos home cooking, come here!",0NRrwhCDOv3jK2ZcKBnpQg,0,0,4,nnfAjF3DSKlEOJTmmBdMOg

4039416,2018-01-05,11,OMRYQihVjqqzjoNoQgyhgQ,"This is the epitome of a mom and pop or hole in the wall restaurant to me. If I remember correctly the name comes from some sisters who opened this shop together. This is truly a Las Vegas hidden gem in my opinion.

Sister's Oriental Market & Video is a Lao specialty market that also carries videos from Laos and Thailand. Aside from specialty South East Asian groceries like curry paste, a variety of marinades, and sauces they also have a kitchen that has ready to be boxed dishes and some made to order dishes. 

Asian people love watching soaps and comedies from their home country. This place will let you rent videos from Laos, hence the video part of the name.

South east Asia is totally known for their soups and noodle dishes and this stuff is the real deal here. They have a lot of traditional Lao dishes that many people don't know about and some Thai dishes which are more commonly known like Pad Thai, Rad Na, and of course papaya salad. If you've never had ""Lao style"" papaya salad then I suggest you try that for sure.

This market has been around since I was a kid and is located down town in Las Vegas- right on Fremont! They have all kinds of snacks and ingredients you couldn't find at a regular asian market. I think they're able to stay in business while competing with lower priced chains like 99 Ranch because of their unique selection of groceries and their loyal clientele.

I ordered the papaya salad with blue crab as it was a must!! And it was the BEST papaya salad I've EVER had! And let me say, I make my own and have had really bomb Thai/Lao style and none has beat this one! Not even my Thai relatives and Lao friends' mothers! Their 5/10 star was a burning 8 and I loved it!

Their khao poon was creamy, delicious HEAVEN!Ahh. Im such a sucker for authentic Lao khaopoon. It was on point. Fresh, loved the tender chicken, and it was so savory you didnt need any condiments. I am drooling as I reminisce.

We're getting ready for our trip south and I was looking for the small round green Thai eggplants. They had them and everything else I could ever want. We didn't know it was a restaurant when we went inside. We were on our way to a Jewish buffet, we love to eat, but came back this evening.
 Hubby's Review: If your idea of ""Thai food"" is mild Pad Thai, you probably won't be happy here. Not that the food isn't fresh and good but it isn't Americanized and it's really more Lao/Issan fare than what most people think of as Thai.
However - if you know and enjoy Lao and Issan fare, you MUST dine here. this is the real deal. sisters offers both Northern Thai and Lao-style Khao Soi. We opted for the Lao version this time and it couldn't have been better. Huge servings, fresh ingredients, all hand-cut spices (no packaged mix here), chunks of dense pork blood, thin-sliced pork and those wonderful little round sausages that are so hard to find here. Spicy broth, wide, thick noodles and flavor forever.
We went all-in Lao tonight, opting for the Lao version of Som Tum (papaya salad). Laotian papaya salad uses anchovie in place of fish oil. For me, it's a bit hard to get used to as I'm not a big anchovie fan but the heavy, very fish (to me) taste becomes less noticeable after a few bites and it is equal to or better than the Thai version in every other respect.
I see numerous repeat visits in the future. Among other delicacies awaiting us are home-made Sai Ua () and Khao Neuw (), ""sticky rice"", for breakfast and Khao Neuw Mamuang (), mango with sticky rice and coconut sauce, arguably the world's best dessert.
Warm, wonderful people run this place. We had a great time with B, daughter of the owner and leader of the pack in the kitchen. Wonderful conversations about Thailand, Issan life and Luang Prabang. B will take the time to get you up to speed on the food and the differences between Thai and Lao cooking.
If you know and enjoy Issan and Lao food or if you are intrigued or just adventurous, do NOT miss this gem. If you are one of those who spent part of the 60's and 70's ""NOT being in the country"" you were really in, the smells alone will bring memories forgotten for decades. The food may well make you think you are back in/not really in-country.
If you are looking for that mild Pad Thai, Sisters will no doubt prepare that for you, too and then pity you for missing out on so much good tasting food.
This place doesn't even have a sign for the restaurant. It's located in the Sister's Oriental Market, on the South side of Fremont Blvd. just west of Bruce street. Open until 7p.m",im7gAYd4NzdH0Zc0nnNGSA,0,0,5,yWDoaBR5ye7-hH5FXlduwA

Also was more sweet for my liking of oriental.

The people working were very nice but next time I might just try something else because of the meat content was really missing. 

This is probably one of the stingiest places I have ever tried with meat content.",jMSYViMV1eIwTYLEvkxnnA,0,0,3,G1pnCAF2A7jlzyFFSC9Nxw
5297013,2017-12-28,1,OMRYQihVjqqzjoNoQgyhgQ,"Fabulous and authentic Lao market and restaurant! I was so happy to have found this gem when I took my parents to Vegas for their anniversary. My dad actually goes way back with the husband whose place it is so it was cool to see them catch up.

We ordered the papaya salad medium spicy with crab, some fried fish, sticky rice, cow man gai (hainanese chicken), gang keuw (sour parts soup with tripe and intestine), vermicelli noodles, and I forgot what else.

Everything was very tasty just like how mom, aunty, or grandma would make it. There  were a few family/couples eating when we arrived it was nice and quaint and cozy where you definitely feel the homey vibe. 

The owners were very welcoming and told us to order anything we want at any time. I even saw them getting fresh produce delivered as we were enjoying lunch. This market reminds  me so much of my childhood back home in  Houston. We would visit the local Lao market every weekend to stock up on necessities and goodies.

So if you're in Vegas make your way down to Sisters Oriental and try out some amazing  food you won't regret it!",KPwOsOSMoZtj-bQqsATeJw,3,1,4,1r4eNL2AHGoIHvY01cwIKg

Sister's Oriental Market is a hidden gem on the outskirts of the Vegas Strip, but definitely worth the far drive if you're looking for some homey Laotian food. 

First of all, the little Lao lady who runs this place is so cute and super sweet! Reminds me of my mom. 

Papaya Salad (Lao Style): They're not kidding when they say the peppers are spicy. So if you ask for medium spicy, be careful, because I have a pretty large spice tolerance and even the medium was spicy for me. I also love how dark, smelly, and sour they make the papaya salad. 

Khao Piak: This is the perfect hangover cure if you've been partying in Vegas. The broth is creamy and full of garlic and herb flavor, the noodles are perfectly soft, and there are huge pieces of chicken.",rcZmGvLPPnzgPLd-JQqf8A,0,0,5,1ovyXcu1keuFYUoZ0QREOQ

I didn't have time to shop around i only sat on the food side to eat. The food is definitely authentic, they were very nice in there. Great taste and it makes me miss my grandma's cooking!

I love spicy food, like really spicy to where my mouth is on fire and i can't feel my tongue lol. I still haven't found a place where they understand when i say i want it extremely spicy using 20+ peppers it's like they don't think i can handle it when i say EXTREMELY SPICY or when i say PET PET LAI LAI. Lol. But other than that, AMAZING FOOD WITH GREAT TASTE! Authentic Laos Food and i will definitely return!!",J8FKQM1yvbwoKcuWRNh1yw,2,3,4,FyEiD6rpX9G0e9ao7LIoFA
5338713,2016-09-11,0,OMRYQihVjqqzjoNoQgyhgQ,"Prices are reasonable and food was super tasty and authentic! If only it was closer to the strip. Not much seating area so don't expect to go in with a party of 6 or more....we ordered: Thai noodle, papaya salad, Kao piak, chicken curry, nam Khao, pork and beef jerky and 2 sticky rices. Also got drinks for 4 people and total was $68.00. Would def go back. Kao piak noodle was super fresh and good, Thai noodle was very flavorful, added intestines for more $ to make it Thai boat noodle, no blood, but was still really good. Nam khao was sour and fresh, first time I've had it sour but it was so good. The beef jerky is better than the pork and comes with a dipping sauce although I like the prepackaged jerky sold at the register better. The daughter working out front was super nice and friendly! Every dish was so good!! Only bad thing to say would be seating area. It's inside a little Asian market.

If you are white washed asian, don't bother. If you think street vendors are unsafe, stick to Panda Express.

But I finally had the courage to try their food after looking around at potential new Thai food near downtown.  I have liked everything I have had here, but the true standout is the Thai-style papaya salad.  It is hands-down the best I have had in town.  Their prices are good. It is next to the scary-looking octapharma, but do not let that deter you.  The personnel are super friendly and will explain anything you do not understand. Beware, however!  I pride myself in being able to take some spice, but the medium level is about as much as I can handle. It is awesomely delicious heat.",B0Q-UCv620AGyKXp9x-mnw,0,0,5,7fLmit4Cgk7D2Hfr0DVw7w
