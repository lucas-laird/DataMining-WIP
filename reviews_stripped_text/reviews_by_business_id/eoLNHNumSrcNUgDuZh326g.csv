The decor doesn't feel quite like an Indian restaurant, but more like a diner. It's a fun mismatch. Even weirder, there is also Filipino food on the menu! Strange combination, but I like it! 

I've only ever had the buffet. Some of the items are hit or miss, but the tandoori chicken is yummy and the aloo gobi is also very enjoyable. The owners don't always have the same thing on the buffet, so it's always a nice surprise to see what they're serving for the day. The paneer naan is delicious and I could happily eat only that for the rest of my life.",Uw-v0UN_g_oFvldC7HWXMg,0,1,4,TYGIz_vbS6k-yoGFhy7cVg

Also my bf got the lunch buffet deal which we ot to go and it wasn't bad. For 9.99 he got rice, lamb, chicken, some dessert thing and bread, oh and rice. And a soup. See! Not a bad deal! lol. We got it to go. The place is sort of old school looking with the black and white title and pinkish decor but, like i said very very clean. Oh and the meal i got was also about 9 dollars. Wasn't the cheapest but i had the meal at 2. I'm still full! :)",JCBBmqUxWeEX8Y0tmYgD8g,0,0,3,YsjF-CLHt5Tbw2zMDligKw

I go around bragging about how much I love Indian buffet, so I have been carrying a heavy obligation to revisit some of the places I used to haunt before I became a card-carrying Namaste fool! I can't just tell everyone how much I love Indian buffet and then have them roll up on my profile only to find one Namaste review with 15 updates, but my friends, that just may be what the future holds. I can only curb my addiction for so long. 

Back in the day (like 6 months ago), India's Grill was our buffet hang. We would go there at least once a week to take advantage of a smallish, but tasty and most importantly cheap offering. Back then the buffet was $6 something and included a drink, so I was completely okay with the fact that there were only about 5 main curry offerings total. They tasted good, and all was well.

I ran into Rob P the other evening, and we reminisced about India's Grill, as he had just had a great dinner there. So, back on the India's Grill train, we headed back to the buffet yesterday. 

The atmosphere is odd, more like a pizza parlor than an Indian restaurant, but the service is always incredibly helpful and kind. I appreciate the sink directly next to the buffet. If you are a germaphobe, this might be the solution to your buffet nightmares. You can wash your hands immediately before and after you serve yourself without having to go into the bathroom! (I don't do that btw. I swear I don't.)

However, once you are all spic and span, you will find a smallish buffet that is now $9 something. There were only 3 vegetarian selections, and the spinach option did not excite my taste buds. The dal was a little soupy, but the flavor was solid with just a hint of spice. I was pumped because they had the carrot dessert I covet, but it had more of a sour than sweet finish. Man. That made me sad. I definitely think that if you want to experience the best that India's Grill has to offer you should follow Rob P's lead: Get the restaurant.com coupon and make a dinner visit. I know from past visits the food has the potential to be pretty delicious, but for now, the buffet is not really showcasing their strength. Next up: a Namaste buffet update.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,5,5,3,KuXIJTQU-2D64lIBuvAodw
