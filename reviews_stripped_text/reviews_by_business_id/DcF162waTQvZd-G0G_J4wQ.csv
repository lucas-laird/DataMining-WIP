Food has changed so much from 30-40yrs ago and not for the better. Even the famous gravy is watery and not the same.

But when they messed up on my order and I got home seen it wasn't all there and they just closed. So I called and told them and they fixed it. Went in the next day and got the right meal for free. 

So I give them about a 4 because they fixed what they messed up on.",OR3Z58oRmF24MyK0IE-bQw,1,0,4,LfFlD_so35KZBx46xNGtEg

They said that it wasn't on the coupon, as if I can't read. Rather than argue I will be going to Popeyes who has a 10 for $10 promotion going on and my wife says the chicken is juicier and fresher tasting anyways.",UTc3NiWB7ckMybkYXkBkfQ,0,0,1,RqXUwiVEXs-XuKe2GPWAvA

Drive thru - CASHIER NAME ""ADRIANA""

2. Charging too much for extra Gravy? Haha
3. Much worst forgetting to put inside the bag some of my orders. Big red flag!!!

Not a huge deal but come on KFC, seriously?

And I forgot to mention, it took like 10 minutes to just get my order, and another 10 to pay. It wasn't even busy. I saw like 4 employees and that was only what I could see through the drive thru window.",mG-q2qtWVAxDEW5Y7BwcCw,0,0,2,s6fPARi2YIunLyn867dWBQ

I usually check the order right then and there because most of the drive-through people are just downright idiots, but this time I try to have faith in mankind. When I get home, I open the box to find a chicken leg, A thigh, macaroni and cheese, and coleslaw. I didn't even get a receipt and felt that going back and fighting with these idiots was pointless.

The menu says the spicy zinger sandwich is sold out, yet the #1 the regular zinger appears to be available...nope that one is gone too, so how about putting a sign up for that one as well? So I order the chicken little combo instead...now from previous experiences I know they are stingy on the mayo, so I ask for a packet of mayo...they no longer have those...the little twit in the drive thru offers no alternative. Please do NOT tell me these people deserve $15 an hour. Their customer service skills are lacking, they can't think for themselves, a computer has to tell them what to do, and they put forth the least amount of effort possible.

+ no one was there, so service was very fast.  
- no military/police/1st responder discount.  

trop right now (4/12/16) is being repaved, so expect to only go east when leaving, and you have to cut a uturn at the intersection or wind through parking lot, so maybe that's why not too many customers at 5pm on a tues.  

consistent food.  I'd eat there again if they offered a check-in or 1st responder discount.  otherwise, I'd just check into another KFC where ever I'm at.",5Wg5OanfZ4-2dCxEo-qjsw,0,0,3,cwhcOBIpC9wu2JZ-5vyonw
