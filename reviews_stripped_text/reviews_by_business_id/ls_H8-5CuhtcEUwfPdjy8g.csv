I ordered the spicy chicken pita slathered with a potato paste and some type of ranch dressing to coat. It was so good. Hit the spot. Just what the doctor ordered. Great new addition to the area.",xU4silHWZGOWz92hPIdFpQ,1,2,4,daa5I_ExbmahZ6f-xEEdpQ

 I love a good falafel and after seeing some very positive reviews on yelp, I wanted to check the place out.  I decided to get the falafel and my son being less adventurous ordered the seasoned fries and a soda. 

We sat down at the few small tables they have as you walk in and waited for the order to be made. Looking around there were some pretty cool looking plants that I havn't seen very often, which  was nice. At each of the tables there are various clear vases with random plants in then and upon further inspection  I noticed there are small fish in each one. It was like a Mad Pita non-petting zoo.  

The order came out fairly quickly and I started in on my falafel. There are 3 pretty large falafel balls in each pita. They are so large it is impossible to wrap the pita around the falafel balls.  After the first bite I was in love.  I loved the falafel as much as Dale Cooper loved a damn fine cup of coffee.  Its was truly perfect.  

The seasoned fries were delicious  as well.  

I don't live very close to Mad Pita but I will be making special trips on a regular basis since I am now hooked.  Thank you Mad Pita.",40m0541Z_KexYkdvvqHJIQ,1,1,5,ThefePQW8vpRv9F7bx27eQ

My mother in law had the beef and it was wonderful as well. The onions and peppers were definitely cooked with great love and care. This restaurant has been around for many decades, maybe not here in Vegas but in many parts of the country have they decided that Vegas was the place for them. I am happy that a new Greek/Mediterranean style place has opened up so close to home and their hours of operation are from 11 a.m. To 8 p.m. Welcome to the neighborhood Mad Pita Express!",gHgR3Zix2DcvGIUmwuzr7Q,2,1,5,h7v0QQkBAsCcQg1x95rehg

The people were friendly, the food was prepared quickly.

We had the falafel and gyros and were not disappointed!  

Tasted great and I recommend it for anyone who is craving Mediterranean food.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,1,1,4,lNL2WYm74EBwVXSSzbURxg
3284328,2010-04-03,0,ls_H8-5CuhtcEUwfPdjy8g,"Do you enjoy gyros? I do. I have enjoyed them since I was a boy in the Chicago suburbs. After eating my first gyro from Mad Pita Express, I told my fiance that it was the best that I had ever tasted! The meat is tender, and delicious. The cucumber sauce, tomatos, and herbs are fresh and good. The Pita is puffy and soft. 

My second time to Mad Pita Express I brought my fiance and she ordered a very good lemon rice soup. Very lemony and tasty!  She also enjoyed a piece of fresh baklava which she said was special.

5.00 for the Gyro is a very good price. The soup is 2.99 for a good sized portion. 

It takes a few minutes wait for the food to be prepared. However, the quaint, cozy restaurant has interesting decor that my fiance and I enjoyed looking at for several minutes--family pictures, many different plants, and eclectic artwork.

This is a small, casual, counter-service restaurant. You can dine in or carry-out. We chose to dine in, and our food was brought to us, along with plastic-ware and napkins.",YBWeFCP1Ou28KBXb-mFjkw,2,1,4,CBSh_h2wVhD1Krm1XE9o6w
5061134,2010-04-22,0,ls_H8-5CuhtcEUwfPdjy8g,"It's $5 for a gyro, falafel or veggie pita and $3 for a side of deliciously seasoned fries. The pita is soft, puffy and warm and the gyro I had was tender and tasty as were the fresh feta and vegetables in the pita.  I can also give a thumbs up to the hummus & baklava. Probably my new fave lunch spot close by!",BQ9oLWYiO-XUcXzmkDXzHg,1,1,4,acPXgHFLKWxANr2YK4X5KA

My Vegetarian friend at work raved about them so I had to try it. I also have tried the Gorgonzola salad, which is equally amazing! The portion is huge (plenty for 2 people to split) and the combination of the raisins, pecans and sun dried tomatoes is delightful. The hummus is flavorful, with a little kick to it. The pita bread is always soft and fresh. This is a great lunch option if you're looking for something different.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,2,2,4,pr4auyTn8Wg5z1bmoS6rDA
5520580,2010-06-21,0,ls_H8-5CuhtcEUwfPdjy8g,"This place was SO good.  I ordered the spicy sesame chicken on pita, and my friend got the falafel on pita.  The lady that took our order talked us into getting a side of fries.  She said that they were the best fries in Vegas, but that was far from the truth.  They weren't bad, they just weren't the best fries in Vegas.  The falafel, however, might have just been the best falafel in Vegas.  I'm not a huge falafel fan, but I absolutely loved theirs.  The grilled chicken was also exceptional.  Juicy, and perfectly marinated.  I will definitely be back.

The only thing that bummed me out was that they have vases with fish in them on the tables.  The fish don't have nearly enough room in there, and people probably tap on the glass all day, and stress them out.  One of the vases actually had a sign on it that said ""Don't feed me, I will explode, and die"" on it.  Made me wonder how many fish already exploded in there.  I felt sorry for them while I was eating.  I would have rated this place 5 stars, but I'm removing one for the uncomfortable feeling the mistreated fish gave me.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,1,0,4,bpTU9tRLrw1U9lh2H8kvHA
