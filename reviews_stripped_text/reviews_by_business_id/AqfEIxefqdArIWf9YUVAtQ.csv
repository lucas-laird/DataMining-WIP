I visited the Omelette House during a business trip in Henderson, NV. The breakfast was tasty and I'm told the coffee was hot and ready (though I didn't have any myself).

The service was extremely slow (with NO apology; and a joke about having to wait a ""Mexican minute""...which, apparently, is longer than 60 seconds) even though there were only 4 tables occupied (family of four, two at my table and two other tables with only ONE person)!  Four tables and a total of 8 customers!  Really?  Our country scrambler breakfast was cold, the ""melted"" cheese had turned hard again.  The ""spuds"" (homemade, thick-cut potato chips) were deep fried, hard and greasy.  They tasted as if the oil needed to be changed/cleaned about a month ago.  I wish I could say anything good about this experience; but I really can't.  We didn't even eat our meals; but were charged full price.  No one seemed to care if the meal was eaten or enjoyed.  Don't waste your time, money or taste buds.  I can't think of a worse breakfast in my life.  Sorry; the entire experience was terrible. Go down the street and eat a great breakfast at Joker's Wild Casino for $2.49 (that's what we had to do!).",dqx-IcB_sGPystDFiLHrXQ,0,0,1,C8WT68eCB4p00eBJJ12ePg

I usually get their corned beef hash and eggs but got the eggs Benedict the last trip and was so happy I did. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the hollandaise was made in house and it came with their famous spuds that were cooked crispy like I like. Did the spuds in the sauce--so good.
I have yet to have anything bad here and I have ordered both breakfast and lunch items. They are my second favorite place to get fried zucchini and it comes with ranch and cheese sauce.

My wife and I ate dinner here on 3/8. I ordered a small house salad and the meatloaf w/mashed potatoes and corn. The salad was a portion of cabbage w/ a slice of not very ripe tomato. It's a good thing I added ranch to make it somewhat palatable. I didn't finish it. The best part of my dinner was the corn. I got the feeling that this place wasn't doing very well so they're cutting back wherever they can. This used to be a decent place when they first opened. I hope this location serves a better breakfast or they might as well close for business. With tip, I spent $27 for dinner for 2.

653679,2012-04-17,0,AqfEIxefqdArIWf9YUVAtQ,"I came here because I was staying at Siena Suites across the street and that gave me a 15% discount. I had no idea what to expect, read nothing, saw nothing, but by the end I realized I'd just found an amazing place to eat, and I'd come with a mostly full stomach!

I felt horribly guilty leaving behind a lot of my food but I knew it wouldn't survive the trip back to LA, that said the portions were HUGE. This is an all day omelett! I didn't even get an omelett though, my girl did, but I got the chicken fried steak which I told her while we were there, was the BEST one I'd ever had. And I've had a good 10-15 different varietys. It was just the perfect flavor to me. The pumpkin bread was bomb too.

Everyone here was also super friendly, no one made a fuss about getting the discount, overall a great experience.

So I was going to write this 5 star review anyway, but here's what made up my mind to post it ASAP. I left my debit hard here! Ugh! So I drove all the way down to Baker, California before realizing this. I called and they let me know I'd left it, and I asked if they could mail it to me and they said yes! You have no idea how delighted that made me, there was no way I could've driven back so one less card to cancel and re-order makes my life way easier. Like I said, 5 stars anyway, but because of that there's no way I can't return the favor and spread around the karma a little bit, because it's not like I told them I'm a yelper or anything!

My kids like to share a pancake breakfast which is plenty as well. My only real gripe with this restaurant is their knives. They are useless, aside from spreading butter.

Before pride it was about 8am in the morning and me and  the girls wanted some home cooked breakfast.. so we decided on Omelet house sounded good..
I was outside.. i could smell the food.. it smelled so good.. we walked inside told the lady table for 5 for a booth.. we waited like almost 10 min.. wasn't crowded.. the manager came over and seated us at the booth.. he was very sweet and i started off with some chocolate milk and some water with lemon.. waited like 5 min and we got our drinks perfect timing.. than i looked at the menu.. everything looked good but i was craving some good stuffed french toast.. there special stuffed french toast looked good..it came with 2 eggs..3 pieces of bacon and 2 sausage.. was $8.59 (around there) Sounded good but i wasn't that hungry so i found another french toast special for $7.39 it came with 2 pieces of french toast 2 eggs 2 pieces of bacon and 1 sausage. so i decided on that special..

took 15 min til the waiter FINALLY gets there..she was so rude to my gf.. she didn't even tell us her name.. she just says.. ya.. what can i get u.. not a good morning or anything.. (i forgot her name.. srry) I g ok.. i told her what i wanted and she says ok.. she was so sarcastic.. she didn't even look at me while she took my order.. whole entire time she was rude and bitchy too all of us while taking our orders.. so me vo and abby went too the manager and complained.. the manager told us that it wasn't the first time that this waitress got complained about.. so the manager had enough and fired her ass that day.. was glad too.. s
Well after we complained anther waiter got us 2 plates of banana bread which was REALLY GOOD!!! The other waitress was laughing Little bit and said I'm so embarrassed i'm so sorry that happen.. than she left... We were having enough so we got a doggy bag what we didn't eat.. (I was s stuffed though the food was good though) 

Right after we packed our food we asked for the check from the manager..The manager gave us 20% off of our $60.00 bill.. (if u ask me.. we should have gotten our meals for free how much we went though..) Right after i mean righter we got our bill the same waitress (the bitchy one..lol) came up too us.. having this kinky smile says.. u all have a good day and i left u a little something special on the bill.. she gives us another cold stair and walks away..

  I never in my life has ever ran into such a rude and mean waitress.. I'm NEVER coming back here again.. even though there food was Really good.. there people there stinks.. i wish i could have been those customers who has a good experience here.. UGH!

 that's why i give this place a 2 star.. give them a 2 star because they have a good food.. was just going to put 1.. but since they have good food i gave them 2.. Man I'm being too nice but that was my experiences.. I really hope u have a better time than i did..",Z9HpopgqT5M3zYgmJxDmRg,2,3,2,thIx2V4nlxJuARc9opt8hg

1543883,2014-09-12,0,AqfEIxefqdArIWf9YUVAtQ,"It has been quite awhile since my four star review and I haven't been here in awhile. The food is still pretty much the same. Large servings of average food. The spuds are good, the dressing is fresh and the coffee is hot. The food has become nothing to exclaim over. The omelettes are good but way too big for me. They need a real kids menu to chose from with a better price point. But the servers usually do try to offer the mouse pancake. The gravy with their biscuits was quite good previously but now is tasteless. Frozen sausage patties didn't help. 
The service is on point, with some of the same people still here from my original review. They always seem to check in now. Very friendly. 
But my issue today is cleanliness. The tables were gross and the menus were sticky. It was clear that whoever was responsible for cleaning did not do it. On all the tables around us I was able to see that the settings had not been moved and it was disgusting around them. I was in a long booth and it looked as though the table was wiped off only as far as they could reach standing at the end. The dirt was so built up I could have scratched it with my nail. This was breakfast time so there was no excuse for the way the place looks. Both of our menus had syrup on them as well as other unknown sticky substances. Seems like people are slacking on that cleaning too.
Because it isn't clean I am forced to only give two stars. Hopefully this can change soon.",rE4q3lTnVoyR95_Ikgs9Hg,0,0,2,oztCW_m2Cz-YW-eg8-Ev8g
1544960,2014-11-13,7,AqfEIxefqdArIWf9YUVAtQ,"Omelet House puts together a strong Midwestern style breakfast experience.

I stopped for a meal while in Vegas by direction of a colleague recently and was immediately transported to the Midwest by the feel of the menu and interior, even the friendly server made me wonder if I was in Minneapolis or Kansas City. The menu is enormous and offers just about any breakfast staple that you could imagine. It took considerable time to decide upon the Chili Verda Skillet Breakfast, something I figured I could not find at home in OC. 

This Southwestern number combines Chili Verda served over home fried potatoes, onions, peppers, and Ortega chilies which is then topped with two eggs and Jack cheese. All killer, no filler and with a $9.49 price of admission, I would try it again happily. 

The downers include a less that sterile environment in the dining area and disgusting bathrooms. Considering the locale, I am sure this isn't a deal killer locally but it drops a 4 star meal down a notch for this Yelper.",sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,8,7,3,SSNlMbtnhdxtoRywD8jCrg

I've actually been here a few times but most recent visit was my fave so far.

Came in close to 11am, waited a few minutes for someone to greet us and then was sat right away.

My friend and I shared the B.B.C - Broccoli, Bacon and Cheese Omelet.
Comes with a side of their really yummy, perfectly seasoned and cooked, breakfast spuds -- shaped like chips, crispy outer with soft inside AND choice of bread, we chose to have the freshly baked, warm, banana bread.
Very good! I was happy they didn't have it overly cooked like the previous times. Omelet had the right amount of bacon and broccoli in it -- also the egg was light and fluffy.

Portions are HUGE! They do offer a ""Baby Omelet"" for the smaller appetite but it's only $.89 less, IMO, you might as well buy the bigger portion and just take it home!

LOTS of breakfast items to choose from, including about 35+ different omelets.
They also have lunch items like soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches, and a couple entrees.

My mother in law brought the whole family down here as a birthday celebration for my husband and other members of the family. I have to give it to the restaurant that they were very accomadating to our large party and they had Spanish speaking staff available as some of our family don't speak English. It was a comfortable experience for them. 

However, I personally was less than impressed. I have more of a sweet tooth than the rest of the family and have been trying to watch my weight, so I ordered a short stack of pancakes. The portion was huge! Don't get me wrong, it's not a complaint and I was happy to eat more than my fair share and make a cheat meal out of it. I'm not sure if it's because this restaurant specializes in omelets, but if you offer something on the menu, you should be comfortable serving it to customers right. The pancakes were nasty and so sour. Tasted like they were made with rotten milk. I really should have sent them back, but didn't want to make a scene in front of family. 

If I were ever to go back, I would go for the omelets, but nothing else. Everyone else really enjoyed their meal. Wish I would have had the same experience.",l--K3xQWVqs93iFhAoEYag,5,3,3,pQqLkm-ZlpqDmTVlw2jNtA

the omelets are always perfectly made, love the spuds that come with it :-) lately i've ordered the eggs benedict and by far this place makes the best one, the eggs are perfectly cooked, the ham is big enough that it covers the whole english muffin. the hollandaise is delicious!!! 

the omelets are big enough that sometimes me and hubby need to share but if you don't wanna share they do have a  3-egg omelet which is perfect. they can also half the big order of omelet if your sharing. 

customer service is perfect everytime we go, always the same ladies and gentleman that help us, only a few times that we ask for our coffee to be refilled but they're always on top of that. 


we did try there lunch menu which is also delicious.  the onion rings are my favorite, batter is nice and not too much, its crispy, hardly any oil. the chicken fingers and spuds are perfectly cooked as usual. 
hubby got the meatloaf sandwich, which was alright, it did have too much bread, the meatloaf seems as if its not homemade but we've never asked the fries were delicious though.",IgW3Rl1IP3LJV8XEpE0cbA,1,1,5,z098wF5L5tH-ZLNzhFDoHQ

On this particular outing I knew that I should have had my head examined because I know the area and I don't particularly care for it.  My experience pretty much confirmed why I feel that way; Boulder north of Sunset can get a little hairy.

First off, as previously stated,your gonna get decent tasting chow.  OH's have a great menu that appeals to just about every breakfast, brunch and lunch seeker.  This OH is clean and the staff is friendly, even though they didn't listen to the finer details of my order.

I was impressed by the attitudes of the workers, who all seemed pretty happy to be there and were enthusiastic when talking about the food. The clientele at the time was largely the grey-haired set which meant that our meal went smoothly, devoid of any obnoxious drunken silliness from other patrons. The environment reminded me a bit of Florida.

We ordered a few things;

* Cup of navy bean soup: Thick and hearty with ample chunks of navy beans and ham throughout. Not the most amazing or flavorful soup, but a satisfying bean soup.
* Pumpkin Nut Bread: Woo-hoo, this stuff is GOOD! Warm pumpkin flavor with a molasses undertone and crunchy nuts with spices, this is more like banana bread than wonderbread. It's especially good warm with butter.
* Biscuit with gravy: Thick, creamy sausage gravy smothering a biscuit that's been cut in half. A bit salty but overall good.
* Lobster, Avocado & Cheese Omelet: This thing was a beast. HUGE omelet! The eggs are light and fluffy, supposedly cracked fresh on site. The lobster was tender, well complimented by the avocado with a decent amount in a $10 omelet. I didn't particularly like the stringy cheese with it as it seemed an incongruous flavor pairing, but the omelet was overall very satisfying with enough for 3-4 servings. It wasn't bad reheated the next day! It was served with crispy little potato rounds seasoned with herbs, salt & pepper. They're a nice change of pace from the standard hash browns but not necessarily what I'd consider a breakfast food. They, too, were good reheated the next day after being crisped in the oven.
* Chicken Fingers: Interesting coating, different from the standard with a nice crisp bite. The meat itself was a little dry and the pieces were small. They come with ranch or cheese sauce and I believe more of the potato rounds.
* Side of Bacon: SUPER crispy. I like bacon with some gristle left over for me to gnaw on so I didn't have any. J did and wasn't particularly into it.
* Side of sausage: Instead of links these were patties, which we hadn't anticipated so we sent them back.

Their coffee wasn't astounding, but it was strong which was exactly what I needed. The mug it came in was awesome, too, very wabi-sabi baby!

We'll probably come back over the next few months. This place is a step above your average Denny's or IHOP, the staff all seemed pretty happy and the food was good. 

Fun Fact: I don't know what a Grunion is, but make sure you take a peek at their ""Flatlander's Special"" . Takes a brave soul to order that, I assure you. ;)",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,1,1,4,W0agTZyZAExOuF0pmrUxDw

We all ordered omelets with the exception of French Toast, Eggs Benedict, and a kids Chicken Fingers meal.
The Eggs Benedict that I had was extremely salty.  And I think this had to do with the thick slices of ham they used.  I ended up removing the ham and eating small bits of it along with the rest of the benedict.  We also weren't a fan of their potatoes.  Our server informed us that they came out wrong.  Because they were definitely hard and crunchy.  We kept joking that they had to be some sort of potato chips.  The server kindly asked if we wanted to get them replaced with the proper way they should be cooked, but we were unimpressed by all the other food that we didn't bother.
I do like how they offer to split the omelets up, since they are so large.  However I don't like how they charge for the $1 split. Just give us an extra plate and we'll do it ourselves!",4UgCYM-rbqzukAJyAU_95Q,1,0,3,J_JudIAHrOkvEDk2_n5OLg

What a complete turnover! I got the Lobster Benedict, and my dad got the Chicken Fried Steak and both were loaded with flavor. It's funny because I really don't like omelets but even though they have a bunch of omelet options they also have a lot of other choices for breakfast as well as sandwiches and hamburgers!
So if you've never been here, there they don't have hashbrowns, they have spuds. Basically homemade thick potato chips. I was kind of iffy about these but our server told us we could have them soft so they're closer to the textures of potatoes in potato gratin or we could have them crispy. My dad and I went with the soft spuds and they were just as good as hashbrowns in my opinion.
Now I was really surprised with my Lobster Benedict. There was probably about  5 inch thick pieces of lobster on each english muffin! (came with two) And it was really fresh tasting as well! The Hollandaise sauce was also really creamy and seasoned well. Yum! I had to steal a bite of my dad's Chicken Fried Steak and it was pretty good as well. I really liked their sausage gravy but their Fried Steak made me sad when some of the breading slid off but the flavor made up for it. 
As for service, our server was really friendly and made sure our waters were kept full. Their hours are really good as well open everyday from 7am-3pm.

What a disgusting nasty horrible person! Who hired this person? Whom ever it was should be ashamed of themselves for being such a bad judge of character.  The worst ""service"" we have EVER witnessed. What a lazy wretched woman.  Our very first and LAST visit to this Omelet House location.  It started out with us waiting in the reception area for over 10 minutes to not only be seated but for someone to leave the employee party that was going on in the back.  We could hear laughing and joking from the kitchen area. Not one server or hostess could be seen. The customers that were seated were obviously annoyed by this.  We have been regulars of their other location down boulder highway and wanted to give this location a try.  A buss boy noticed us as he was the only one working and he politely asked if we've been seen and he was upset when we told him no.  He sat us then he quickly retrieved the ""hostess""  from the employee party in the kitchen. It took another 10 minutes for the hostess to bring our drinks and another 10-15 for ""Shannon"" to waddle out.  She was wearing a shirt that was absolutely filthy and way way to tight.  We reluctantly gave her our food order and when the ""food"" was finally done she slammed the plates on the table spilling some of the food onto the table.  The food was average at best as none of us finished eating any of it for fear of food poisoning. When she refilled our coffees she over filled our glasses and spilled all over the table.  It was an absolutely horrible trip to the Omelet House. Since then we have heard from quiet a few people of similar experiences with other staff with marginal food quality. 

DO YOURSELF AND YOUR INTESTINES A FAVOR AND AVOID THIS LOCATION.

I got Eggs Florentine instead and the spinach was soggy and the sauce didn't have any flavour. The thin potatoes were the best item on the plate and they were not very nice.

I asked for avocado which I think made it awesome. What I didn't know is that a normal order is made with 6 eggs!!!! Someone at another table ordered it and I was flabbergasted by the size. They have an option where you can baby size it and they take .99 cents off the menu price.
You can split a normal order between two people but they charge you $1 to do that...but it's not a bad option. My friend and I will be splitting an order next time bc it is cheaper than both of us ordering our own ""baby"" size. Splitting would be around $11 vs splitting a $19 bill.

The dining area is made comfortable by the homey diner decor and I've always been pleased with the service. 

All three of my visits consisted of similar orders (omelets/homemade chips) so unfortunately I cant speak with much variety but that should also show how much I enjoyed the omelets. First and foremost the portions are HUGE, there is no way you will leave hungry. I've had the Popeye, .38 Special, and both the Porky and Petunia Pig omelets with the homemade potato chips and never finished my meal in one sitting. My Popeye was a little under seasoned but the other two I had no issues with. I usually get sourdough toast (dry) with my breakfast but I've had the pumpkin bread once and it was a pleasant alteration from my norm. Nice and moist with good flavor and not too sweet.

When you make an omelette the cheese shouldn't be the only flavor.  No seasoning on anything.  Vegetables are all watery and flavorless, and cooked into an omelette that is so diluted in order to make it fluffy it has no flavor.  IHOP makes an omelette that is 10x better than this one.  Ironic I guess.

This location is open for lunch and dinner while the other is not, and we were in the area so we decided to stop in for a late lunch/early dinner.

No one was up front when we arrived but a waitress spotted us after a couple minutes and seated us in a large booth. The menu was almost all breakfast foods... Maybe a dozen burgers and sandwiches were offered for lunch/dinner, as well as 5-8 dinners. Both my husband and I felt a bit underwhelmed, and had a hard time finding anything on the menu that really jumped out and said 'Order me!' 

I ended up with a tuna sandwich and my husband got the cajun chicken sandwich. Our food came out fairly quickly and was made to order, but was nothing to write home about... I did notice there was a menu for booze which I don't think the other Omelet House serves...

4107222,2012-08-12,8,AqfEIxefqdArIWf9YUVAtQ,"Time for possibly the fastest turnaround ever on a review.

Just got home from Omelet House, the Boulder and Russell location. It's just a few minutes from my house, and I was a bit apprehensive because of the mixed reviews. However, when I saw that it was doing brisk business at Sunday brunch hour (11:30), my fears were allayed.

It's the Omelet House, so of course I went straight to the omelet menu. I was almost gonna order the Lobster Fest, but I figured it couldn't have that much authentic lobster if it wasn't $15+. I decided on the Bugsy Siegel (#16) instead, which they say is roast beef  in an Italian red sauce, sour cream, and jack cheese. Within a couple of minutes, our server had brought out my pumpkin bread. While the texture is moist, the flavor is good, not great. When I got to the second half of the bread, I had to use a little bit of butter to offset the growing blandness. I slightly preferred my friend's banana nut bread, which I'm definitely going to have next time I'm here.

My omelet was just good. It was little overdone and a little bland, which are safe things to do at a diner, but you can't excel if you don't take risks. I might ask them to ""undercook"" it by half a minute or something next time and see if they'll consent. Oh, and the omelet really is as huge as they say. I might've been able to finish it had I tried harder, but I spared my belly and took about a third of it to-go. Be ready to do the same, or consider sharing the omelet with a friend.

The fried potato slices (they're all a little too thick and some are not crunchy enough to be called ""chips"") were the real star of the show. They come with some dried parsley (?) flakes and some pepper, and they go well with a little bit of Heinz ketchup. They also add a bit of saltiness to the omelet. I also tried some of the Mexi-Chicken, which killed my sensitive taste buds with jalapeno, and the cinnamon apple stuffed french toast, which was yummy and not at all dwarfed by the syrup.

This is definitely a nice breakfast joint, and for about $9, it's a very good value. Check it out when you're on this side of town!",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,11,12,4,GTQryx1IXNOVnbAyQ-pSMw

I've also gone for breakfast and dinner in the past.  My kids rave about their pancakes and I love all the omelets.  Dinner is good as well.  They have daily specials at the Summerlin location, but I'm not sure they serve dinner in Boulder City.

Not only does this restaurant serve breakfast but they also offer some great options for lunch too. 
I ended up taking a gamble on a breakfast item, which is a rarity for myself.. however, I went with the biscuits and gravy and MAN I am still left wanting more!

The service was okay as I was with a close friend who loves to entertain the wait staff, so I suspect my experience was better than average. I had to wait for someone to come to the register so I could pay to leave, then suddenly there were two people to show us out, one of whom was waving at my friend who is a regular (and a great tipper if they play along with her shenanigans). It seemed like there was no staff at the front unless there were customers at the front, and none of them had a whole lot of enthusiasm for being there. This was just like the Omelet Houses I've been to in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas area without the southern hospitality. Would I recommend it? Depends on what you're looking for.

We probably waited about 30 minutes or so after we were sat down until the owner/manager came over to our table and told us that if we didn't order now he was going to kick us out of his restaurant since other people were waiting!!!!  Keep in mind that our waiter hadn't even been by our table!  We were so taken aback by what he said and he actually even cussed at us!  By the time the waiter came over my mom was crying and he couldn't apologize enough.  The assistant manager even came over and apologized, but unfortunately the person who was unbelievably rude was above them.

The food was ok, but at that time we were pretty upset so I can't really give an honest review.  On our way out my mom talked to the owner/manager and expressed how upset she was about his outburst for us waiting for the waiter to come to our table.  He was even more rude, yelling, and cussing at her in front of customers.  And trust me, my mom is very quiet and never yells at anyone or gets upset with anyone.

It's NOT about the QUANTITY it's ABOUT the QUALITY!!!! Dear Omelet House didn't you know that by now?? :(

Ok maybe I was out partying to long the night before and wasn't really capable of judging the food, but I sure wasn't hangin (cuz I usually don't drink), so there must have been something wrong with what I ate...

So as we walk in I take a look at the menu and the selection is wow, they have everything u can possibly want, the service was also nice, a lady brought us the menus and immediately asked if we would like something to drink, OH YESSS a cup of coffee PLZ (i need it bad). So I looked at the menu and found my fav dish (which I usually make at home and is WAY better), then I go ahead and order my egg white omelet with lots of veggies and little bit of cheese, mhm talk about not being hungry for the rest of the day...
As we wait for the ""goodies"" to be cooked we chit-chat and the omelets arrive, the ""goodies"" I thought a minute ago were now chunks of I'm guessing egg substitute, that wasn't even properly cooked (had that yucky mushy and gewy stuff that indicates it needs to be cooked more, hello). Ok the mushy and gewy wasn't even that bad I could still deal with that but it was really really un-tasty like I'm eating old eggs in economy class on a plain, plus the portion was the size of my head & they expect me to eat all that? Buahahaha yea right if u want to call an ambulance, cuz i'll explode...
So I picked out the veggies ate those and did my best to try and eat a lil more, I had a big day ahead of me still needed to fuel up a bit, but seriously didn't eat half of half even yea that's how big the portion is and hey I CAN EAT!

Puh I kno I will never go back there, no need to upset my tummy like that, only if I knew I get leftover economy airplane eggs I would of never ever came here.

I'm sorry guys at least u get two stars, if it wasn't for the nice lady serving us I would of prolly gave u guys a one star.. I'm a breakfast person u know & I prolly know all the best spots for breakfast in HNL, and I was NEVER this unsatisfied with breakfast in my life :( sorry...

There's a huge lobby or front waiting area which I appreciate because breakfast joints like Denny's always have such small waiting areas and people are forced to wait outside in the cold or hot. First thing I noticed was all the farmer-ish Americana decor everywhere, ceramic or porcelain chickens and milk trucks...very homey and cute. They have the mother load of omelet options! The menu was a looong savory list! 
They have kid friendly options, small portion options, split plate options and the portion sizes are hefty. We got a pancake for the little one, a kids portion scrambled eggs and bacon, we shared a side of biscuit and gravy, I got the French toast special, and the big man got the ham & eggs! Spuds btw, are freaking awesome! They're sliced almost as thin as potato chips, fried and topped with seasoning. So good! 
Our server was friendly, and so was the rest of the staff that came by to help us. The place is very attentive, we had three refills of coffee, the kids got refills of their apple juices...we never had to ask. Our food came out quickly too, I want to say everything came out in 15 minutes from the time we placed our order. Once we received our food, we knew it was way too much.

4721007,2017-07-31,0,AqfEIxefqdArIWf9YUVAtQ,"This has been one of my favorite breakfast spots for years, and hands down the best place I have been to in Las Vegas for omelets. Their portions are huge, their prices are reasonable and everything taste great.

One note on this review, the Omelet House is open for breakfast and lunch, but I have never had anything off their lunch menu. I have looked it over, and it mainly consist of sandwiches and burgers. This review is based upon their breakfast food only.

The Omelet House has that country style ambiance that is fitting a breakfast place. No hipster re-purposed wood walls here, but there are porcelain chickens and other farm animals for decorations.

The menu is very large, and they have quite a few options to choose from. The star of the menu is, as you'd expect, the omelets. They have well over 30 omelets to choose from, as well as a large selection of skillets. Egg related breakfast options dominate, though they do have a fair selection of pancakes and french toast for those that want a sweeter breakfast option. The entrees range in price from around $8 up to $12 for some of the pricier omelets, like the lobster omelet (yes, real lobster for $12 in a omelet). The prices seem downright cheap when you see the portions, as the omelet's are at least twice as large as most restaurants. Omelets seem to be made with at least six eggs here. You can easily split an omelet and I usually only eat half and box the other to take home.

My favorite omelets are the kitchen sink, the lobster and the chili verde. The kitchen sink is the biggest omelet, and it contains a little bit of everything. Inside you'll find chili, cheese, kielbasa, sausage, ham, bacon, turkey, and a slew of veggies. The lobster, as mentioned above, contains real lobster! It also has cheese and avocado, and it's huge and delicious. The chili verde has cheese and green chili stewed pork, and it's awesome if you like Mexican food. For an extra dollar they will add diced jalapeno and habanero to the omelet if you like it spicy.

The skillets are also very good, and though they aren't quite as big as the omelets the portions size is still very large. My wife got the meatloaf skillet last time and there was well over a pound of meatloaf on the potatoes and eggs.

All the breakfast come with home fried potatoes, which are good, and served in a pile, but I have had better. The potatoes are thin sliced and often get a bit soggy, but this is really the only thing at the omelet house that isn't great to me.

The breakfast also come with a choice of toast, pumpkin bread or banana nut bread. As much as I love a good slice of sourdough toast, you have to get one of the homemade breads here. They are both great, but the pumpkin bread is better in my opinion. I get it every time I come here and it is another thing that makes their meals fantastic and huge.

This really is an amazing place to eat breakfast. If you are a fan of big breakfast or love omelet's, you really need to come here. This place is actually worth trekking across town for.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,0,0,5,XOmUwQGPuQdqAoI9WqG0nw

The server said it came with fries but it came with thick cut potato chips that had French fry consistency so those were new and interesting. We originally ordered the chili verde skillet which looked amazing but came with pork (even though the menu didn't say so). Our server seemed annoyed when we asked him to switch it out because we don't eat pork and he assumed we knew chili verde meant pork. We got the veggie skillet instead and it was a big disappointment. The veggies weren't thoroughly cooked and it looked as though they just topped the veggies with a scrambled egg.

The omelette came out steaming hot, covered half the plate, and was packed with bacon, sausage, and ham (can't remember the name of the omelette but I believe it was #36). The potatoes were an interesting option, basically potato chips that weren't totally crispy. The options for bread are also amazing with choices like banana nut bread and pumpkin bread.  

Finally, as I sat in my car ready to drive away, my waitress came sprinting out of the restaurant with my banana nut bread in hand (well, in the container I left on the table), making sure I didn't forget to take it with me!

I gandered around the salad bar which is only half full.. I guess tahts smart b/c everything on the salad bar looked incredibly fresh.

Cold salads, pudding, fresh beautiful looking fruit, strawberries and grapes, etc. They also had a frozen yogurt maker for their dessert bar. I was kinda thinking man, I wish I had just gotten the salad bar. It sure beats sweet tomatoes prices $5.99 v.s 9.99 - 

2nd trip:
Well the 2nd time I went I again wanted the salad bar but... I was a lil more hungry that day than I was the previous visit. So I went for the Cowboy special. Yes I am I dallas cowboys fan! this was chilli w/ egg and cheddar cheese, hold the onion. It was good but I woudlnt order it again. I pictured the chilli thicker like Wolf brand chili and it was rather runny with chunks of meat. Not really what I envisioned, but doesnt mean you wouldnt like it.

4960347,2010-05-28,0,AqfEIxefqdArIWf9YUVAtQ,"This restaurant is the newest one in the Omelet House chain, a chain that has had restaurants around the Vegas Valley for years. It is at the Boulder/Russell intersection, in the building that previously housed Sizzler.

My mother wanted to try this place so me, her, and my girlfriend went last night. After our experience last night, I would say that eating at this place wasn't exactly a revelation, but I certainly would not be opposed to going back.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is quite good, with a sort of ""country kitchen"" feel to it, and posters/artwork/etc. of assorted American icons (actors, singers, airplanes, etc.) They even sell some of this sort of stuff at the front counter. My only real complaint with the atmosphere is that, despite the wide, spacious restaurant space, the hostess seemed to insist on seating everyone in the restaurant very close together. Given the lack of customer traffic last night, I wish she had seated us a little further apart.

The menu is HUGE. Like Sizzler that occupied this space before, there is a good-sized salad bar here. As the name of the restaurant implies, the place prides itself on its omelets, and they have tons of options for those. If you're not into salads or omelets though, they have plenty of other choices as well, including pasta and meat dishes. Everything I tried last night was solid, in particular the home-cooked ""spud"" french fries.  

The service in the restaurant was good. Not the best I have ever had, but definitely solid. At times they were pretty slow refilling my water, but everyone in the restaurant had a positive attitude. However, I did hear a waitress tell another customer who requested some drink on display at the front of the restaurant that they had to get those items from up there, separately, and that there was some policy that wouldn't allow them to serve said items directly to the customers at their dining tables. Don't know what the hell was up with that. 

Still, in the end, this was an excellent dining experience. Not the best I've ever had, but I'll more likely than not end up coming back in the near future.",qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,0,1,4,e0XP_CfMgpkpne2nWgumCQ

Slightly hung over one morning a friend and I went to grab some good food to start the day off right. She wanted Roberto's so we pulled up to the drive thru got our breakfast burritos and started to drive home. All of the sudden she freaked out, ""THE NEW OMELET HOUSE IS OPEN!!! WE HAVE TO GO WE MUST GO!"" 

I got very excited because we just bought food, still hot in my lap, and this place made her want to forget that just so we could eat here. SO we dropped the food off at home put some real pants on and went to Omelet House. 

No being a virgin to this place I had no idea what kind of reputation the other locations had. I heard all about it as we ordered and got our food. 

I was blown away. Warm Banana Nut Loaf, an Omelet as big as my head, and the BEST Potato Spuds. As other yelpers have said- they are magical and addictive. I had the Guac omelet with guacamole tomatoes and cheddar cheese, my friend had the health nut with jalapenos. 

We both didn't finish it all, and ended up only taking the left over loaf home since we had breakfast burritos still waiting for us. 

The building is nice and had an eclectic feel to it full of ceramic roosters and other pictures all over its walls. This building use to be a Sizzler so you will still see the Salad Bar chillin in the center of the restaurant. I know by the end of this month they are going to start serving dinner so hopefully it will get some use. Its roomy and inviting to say the least. 

And don't worry the manager said they won't be closing any of the other locations so you can still get all your favs in the usual spot.

This place is on the way home and close to home so very convenient. We have been here previously but being ripped off has stopped me from returning. ( See my last review to see why ) 

This morning i thought I would give them another chance and it was definitely better than my last visit. We were seated immediately and I had to use the little girls room , my boyfriend as well since we had just finished out workout. ( don't eat your germs ! lol ) I hate it when a bathroom has push on/off sinks. What's the point of washing your hands when you have to turn the water back on midway washing your hands to finish rinsing. I might be being dramatic but it's annoying to me. They also didn't have any toilet seat liners :/. I had to ask for some. That's no fun. 

Anyways we sat down and decided what to eat. Our server Cheryl was very friendly and prompt to take our order. I needed a few minutes. I knew I wouldn't order chili verde again since I got barely any meat last time. After placing out order we received the pumpkin nut bread that are with my meal. Even though it's officially October I love pumpkin anything any time of the year. 

Pumpkin Bread - you could see the steam coming off the bread it was hot and ready to devour. Baked with walnuts it was so yummy. Slapped some butter on that and shared with my boyfriend. It was a huge piece too. 

Blueberry stuffed French toast - two thick cut pieces of French toast stuffed with blueberry compote and cream cheese. Not overly sweet and still worthy of maple syrup. Served with two eggs he went for over easy and your choice of bacon or sausage. The French toast does not come with spuds so he ordered a side. 

Spuds - a cross between chips and fries. Super yummy. They come sliced in pieces like chips so you can dip them in ketchup or ranch. I dipped mine in ranch. So good. That ranch. Oh man that's some good ranch. I could eat that stuff all day. But I won't. 

Phillysteak Omelet - huge omelet stuffed with steak meat , peppers , onions , mushrooms  & cheese. They definitely gave me some meat this time I was afraid I wouldn't get any due to my last experience. This was good it was just lacking seasoning. It was bland. I just sprinkled a little salt on the inside and it was fine. Especially after slapping some ketchup and cholula on it. 

We shared the French toast and the omelet and still had food leftover. The service was good and the food definitely better than last time. With it being close to home I will be back now as last time I stated I wasn't sure. Just don't let me down in the future ;)",r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,5,4,3,mfLUUu7vbARpqpEnhVDfKg

5190629,2015-09-19,0,AqfEIxefqdArIWf9YUVAtQ,"We've been to this breakfast restaurant (rounded figure) around 30 times.  Each time the experience has been great - wide selection of breakfast omelets and skillets (they have a lunch menu too!)  Seating has been quick with attentive service.  The menu is vast yet shows they care to make not only delicious omelets but to also make them different than you'd normally get at other breakfast places (yes EggWorks and Blueberry Hill I talking about you).
  
I personally love the 23. Kitchen Sink - a hodgepodge of any kind of meats, veggies, cheese, and whatever else they have back in the kitchen thrown into a three egg omelet.  Yes, you may need gastrointestinal nursing afterwards.  Others in my company have enjoyed  26. Popeye (spinach, mushrooms, jack cheese), Mom's favorite 27. Lobster Fest (real lobster, avocado, jack cheese), 28. The Sparticus (asparagus, mushrooms, cheddar cheese), and the amazing  Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs (with sauce on the side), plus the Corned Beef and Hash (WITH REAL CORNED BEEF - NOT CANNED).  Yummy!

I have personally enjoyed (besides the Kitchen Sink), 25. Jolly Green Giant (Broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms, tomatoes, cheddar cheese), 13. Green Hornet (avocado or guacamole, tomatoes, cheddar cheese), and 33  1/2. Flatlanders Special (raw liver, parsnips, peanut butter, black jelly beans, grunion lips, gardenia petals topped with mint ice cream).  All have been very tasty!

And, yes 33  1/2. is a joke menu item.  You can't order it.  A part of me wishes I could - just to give it a try.

The last time we were there I ordered a pork chile verde skillet (a first).  There was an option to order it ""Hell's Kitchen"" style which meant it included diced jalapenos and habaneros.  Whereas normally I would add hot sauce to my breakfast, I didn't have to this time.  It was spicy enough.  I only wish they offered the ""Hell's Kitchen"" option on all their dishes and not just the skillets. 
 
I can rave and rave about this place but I have to say we've also had (recently) a bad experience.  9/12/15 to be exact - all of our three orders came out burnt.  Burnt omelets and burnt toast.  We should have sent it back but decided to just scrape off what was edible and drink lots of water.  It was very surprising coming from a place that had up to that moment, been our ""breakfast place.""  I'm sure we will visit Omelet House again and hope our last visit was just a bad day at the house.

It's not like it's terrible. But it just isn't ANYTHING special at all. It's not up to par with the sort of brunch places I'm used to going to, it's more like Dennys or IHOP quality. 

I got a skillet. $10.95 plus $1 for the ""hell's kitchen"" (jalapeno and habanero added) and while I appreciate the option for heat, it WAS overwhelming for me. I got the spicy chicken, which was very medicore chicken that wasn't spicy at all. It was supposed to come with a ranchero sauce, but I saw none on there to speak of. Basically, it was chicken, potatoes, cheese, the peppers, onions and green some green pepper and an egg over medium plopped on top.

We were sat and greeted by two servers for beverage orders but WiTHOUT menus.  We got beverages a few minutes later orders were taken.  Food didn't take long as the restaurant wasn't that busy.  Other assistant servers were doing refills on beverages and check backs on our food.   We had previously asked for two checks but decided to combined them but it would be done at the cashier.  There were four employees at the front and the cashier didn't know how to do our combined checks and military discount.  They also implied that service charge wasn't included in our second check so that had to be added on as well.  The entire process of combining checks and getting discounted took a few minutes because the lack of experience from employees asking each other how it is done.  Very disappointing and frustrating to have waited just to close a check.  No manager was around to assist the employees. Overall the food was good as stated here on Yelp but the host and cashier needs a lot of improvement soon!!!,_5VyC9QOdtManMMLUeSusQ,0,0,3,0raa_WCtKgUn1gqu0DMbKw

This is a very good breakfast place with that old school diner type of feel. There are tons of old photos on the wall (which are for sale might I add) and tons of little nic-naks scattered around. The stuffed French toast is AMAZING, I would highly recommend, however, I love their omelettes as well (egg white one is amazing as well). Coffee is always fresh, and the bread is amazing too. If you ever drive down  boulder highway towards Sam Boyd stadium, do yourself a favor and stop by this place. You won't be disappointment.",32EBqjpqQq18ooW9ZYRt5g,0,0,5,jnV8G0gP_eZI7OTpOmK9cw
5754037,2011-06-04,2,AqfEIxefqdArIWf9YUVAtQ,"I think we made the mistake of coming here right before closing time, my seafood chowder was too thick and creamy with no flavor, my chicken was cold and flavorless, the sauteed mushrooms felt like they only touched the skillet for a second and my husbands chorizo omelette had about 2 pounds of chorizo in it! Gross! 

Bad food and bad service ( I even saw a manager wearing shorts), don't come to this location.  Stay far far away!",qba1JQlp5a6kEwRRTGxdkg,2,0,1,lER7I7AJ8STTZxf6bS49NA

I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs and it was pretty good. Loved the sausage gravy and their potatoes, which are cut thin like potato chips and crispy.Just the way I like them. Service was very good, as it wasn't too crowded on a Thursday around noon. 

I'll try them again, the stuffed french toast the guy at the next table ordered looked pretty tasty.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,3,2,3,05_laOtlp3rZPK3XduhTbA

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a friendly employee and we were seated right away.  The restaurant has a really ""homey"" look and feel to it.  

I asked our server for suggestions and she recommended the pumpkin bread and the chicken fried steak.  The pumpkin bread was served with butter on the side and it was really moist and delicious.  The portions were huge and the chicken fried steak was alright.  Believe it or not, my favorite thing was the ""spuds.""  They're basically sliced, seasoned potatoes.  I would actually go back just for the spuds.  

I recommend Omelet House to others and would definitely return for the food and great customer service.",-WYbVngIGDQ81MY12UtwnA,8,4,4,mYBG9LV9rTS0AoWAouzC0Q
5911027,2017-02-19,1,AqfEIxefqdArIWf9YUVAtQ,"I would recommend this place for an easy meal when also looking to get more for your money. As far as diners go, this place is a little better than average. Relatively clean and super quick service most of the time. The coffee isn't that good, but you can ask for real milk or cream to dress it up. The omelettes are gigantic but I wasn't a fan of the home fries (fried potato slices) as they are soft and oily - but they will fry them harder or softer if you ask.
The salads are strangely enough super fresh and crisp. I'm not sure I've ever seen anyone else order them, but they are on point with their lettuce!
The banana nut bread is worth a try, although hearing the microwave every time it's ordered is unnerving. I know it's the best way to heat up cake but maybe move it to the back?",u78hzZ5zaaz0Afht2PdEOA,2,0,3,mLTyyEhNYXcuHpw1IOVRfg
5916581,2011-01-06,1,AqfEIxefqdArIWf9YUVAtQ,"Staying off Strip, I discovered this gem of a place. I love breakfast so this hits the spot.

The menu reminds me of Harbor House in Seal Beach, 80% full of yummy breakfast foods, 20% lunch/dinner type stuff. Great selection of omelets! 

Chicken fried steak & eggs were absolutely delightful here. The fried steak wasn't soggied down by the gravy and not too salty. A weakness of many fried steaks I've tried. The fried potato slices were a welcome change from traditional hash browns. You can also choose pumpkin nut bread as a bread side, they're fantastic!

He did the split plate for 99 cents which came with extra spuds. I had the country fried steak omelet,  I recommend to anyone who loves country fried steak like myself.  Prefect amount of eggs to steak. Our meals came with a choice of bread, we both picked pumpkin bread.  It did not disappoint either.  Great food overall. Definitely see ourselves going back.",fR31CtrjIYojoo3K9Runmg,0,0,4,3p9_1wJvA50xHbze5gusxg
