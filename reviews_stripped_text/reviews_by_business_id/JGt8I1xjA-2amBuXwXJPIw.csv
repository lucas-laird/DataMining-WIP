The next 2 times I had Wednesday's Buy 1 get 1 free special. I had Hawaiian chicken, and Meat Supremo. I have to say Pizza Hut has computation for my money now!!",biqFJW8_dm7q6647nc_6fg,0,0,5,Qc60FzRmtZxAxjdL6Ob5yQ

The owner, Matt, and his step-son, Bryan, are two of the most friendly people you will ever meet.  I work at a middle school and we order from them at least 3 times a week.  I get big orders from Matt at least twice a month.  They are ALWAYS on time, hot, and reasonably priced!  My favorites are the White Cheezy (bacon, chicken, white sauce, garlic, cheese...mmmm) and the Hawaiian Chicken (chicken, pineapple, bacon, cheese...YUM!).

This Marco's is SO wonderful, that at the end of the school year, Matt catered a lunch for 15 teachers for FREE to say thank you for my business all year!!  How awesome is that?!?!  They clearly know how to please customers!

Marco's is FANTASTIC!!",Fpx2SKojJAoziOCbEaLWIw,2,3,5,gCx2xPk9eD00Ad-tS-taoA

The sauce has a ton of flavor and there is a lot of it on each pie.  The toppings are in fair quantity.  I'm not sure if they are still using canned mushrooms.  They used to.  It has been a while since I've had a Marcos pizza with mushroom.  If they are still using canned, I wish they would use fresh.  Besides the pizza, the cinnamon bread is a must.  It is chewy and fluffy.  It is buttery and sweet.  Unreal.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,0,4,6mTomHvrTiEP8s4NYpnMDA
