I start with nigiri salmon, yellowtail, toro, maguro and anything else that looks good, so I know the fish going in the rolls is good. The New York girl in Las Vegas roll is unique. the 911 roll is spicy good. The Spider roll is average, the Spicy Tuna roll is above average.

We drove nearly 45 minutes off the strip to get there, and it was a disappointment to say the least, considering how much everyone hyped it up.  It was basically full when we arrived, but there were five seats open at the bar.  We stood around for five minutes with no host or hostess telling us whether or not we could sit down or not, and it was only after we flagged down a busboy that we were told we could have a seat.  

We all ordered the all-you-can-eat lunch, and proceeded to put in our orders.  For appetizers I ordered a green salad (completely drenched in dressing with mushy tomatoes), the fried calamari (it came out square-shaped and tasted like fish cake?) and the mussels, which was the only edible selection of the lot.  

For sushi, we ordered plenty of nigiri and some rolls as well.  The pieces of fish for the nigiri weren't especially big or tasty, and definitely wasn't on par with other sushi places I've been to.  I was especially disappointed with the rolls - while there was no dearth in selection, most of the menu items seemed the same with only minor changes in the ingredients, and the ones that we did get just weren't appetizing at all - we ended up having leftover pieces of some of the rolls we ordered with no one stepping up to finish it, not because we were full but because they just tasted gross.  Overall, just boring, unremarkable flavors that weren't appetizing at all.  At the end, I was so put off by the sushi selection that I had to go back and order the mussels in order to try and fill myself up (which still didn't end up happening).

i love this place for the following reasons:
1)  AYCE ice cream!! right?!! you can choose from red bean, green tea, or plum flavors.  or do what i do...get a bowl of all of the above. =)
2)  you can order shrimp tempura and ONLY shrimp tempura.  that means, you dont get the typical 2shrimp:10veggies ratio.  if all you want is shrimp, then thats all you get.
3)  you can order 1/2 orders of all the rolls so that you can sample all of the different rolls.  pretty awesome.

The best part about this AYCE is that they don't try to fill you up on white rice. The rice is loosely packed, and with the way I dip my sushi in soy sauce, it fell apart. :) This is a good thing because I really just wanted to eat the raw fish. Yeah, I like calling sashimi raw fish because it is more fun to say. If you dislike it, then sue me. 

Boy toy and I were super duper disappointed that they no longer serve uni. The salmon roe with quail egg had to suffice, and its deliciousness almost did the trick. And the raw salmon was so fatty that it melt into my mouth. Oh, and the tomago texture was very consistent and eggy. 

Lastly, I was disappointed that the tempura ice cream was no longer on the menu. I had to settle for just ice cream. Get the plum ice cream, it is now my favorite Japanese ice cream flavor.

177886,2010-11-10,0,m_CqRpEZ2XDH3fp-KFAycQ,"First time to the west sahara location. I usually go to the Silverado/Maryland location (which is ALWAYS busy). Went with a big party at around 7:30 on a Saturday night. I was quite surprised it wasn't busy at all. They were just waiting for a larger party to finish up and we were seated in 10 mins. 

First off, I forgot how good of a quality their sushi is. I haven't been to Sushi mon in a long time since discovering Oyshi, Hikari and Island Sushi. After my first salmon nigiri, it instantly reminded me of why we always used to go here. Big, fresh piece of fish on a tiny nug of rice. Exactly how it should be.

I love their salmon nigiri and their natto! Their natto is the best I've had in town.. its the kind that is from a tube.. not the ones from the packs. Don't get me wrong, I like those too.. just not for my sushi.

I didn't realize that their prices went up to $30! That is pretty pricey for all you can eat sushi, when other venues offer much more of a variety. Honestly, I have been going to other places because they offer much more choices in appetizers. I'm not a sushi roll person. I don't care at all for those rolls stuffed and topped with random stuff. I mainly stick to the nigiris and explore the appetizer menu. 

Their appetizers... are not that great. I got the scallop half shell bake (something like that). I had a thought it was going to be a baked scallop in the shell topped with mayo or something. Instead it was baby scallops baked in a dish topped with a disgusting mayo sauce. I could hardly finish it. The boyfriend ordered the ahi poke (which i WAS going to order but didn't.. thank god!). I dunno what the heck what in there.. but it wasn't only ahi. There were other weird raw pieces of fish.. it was gross.

Service was quick and the workers there were very friendly! The lady even ran out after us to make sure we got the punch card. I will definitely be back, but will probably go to the Henderson location!",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,1,1,4,oz40G6qDo357Q-l47nRffw

It's not that good.

I should've known from all the mixed reviews. Oyshi is my usual choice for AYCE sushi in the Vegas vicinity but the last time we went to Oyshi, the quality had gone down a bit and we decided to try something else.

Even so, I'd rather go back to Oyshi than Sushi Mon. Sushi Mon doesn't have as much variety in terms of rolls and side dishes offered. The cut rolls weren't that impressive (rather bland as Michael T. mentioned) and the fish didn't taste exceptionally delicious. I was pretty disappointed.

My friends and I came here after a full day of cruising the strip and felt like gorging ourselves with some good sushi.   The decor is about average for a small sushi place.  The service was great as we had what felt like 3 servers going in and out of our table.  About half of our group ordered all you can eat and the rest ordered a la carte.   Their list of rolls is probably the most expansive I've seen so far.  Since i got the all you can eat I ordered a couple rolls to start off with before a server let me know that I can order half rolls.

Being able to order half rolls in an all you can sushi place is like the invention of sliced bread for a bakery; it was astonishing how much more of the menu I tried just because of the ability to order most things at half portions.  Most of the rolls were great and some were just too weird for my taste buds.  Another plus to the menu was the choice of dessert that comes with the all you can eat order.  Maybe I haven't been to enough sushi places but most that I know do not include desserts in their orders.  All in all, I had about 5 half rolls, 3 full rolls ( I can't remember what they were though...) and some mochi ice cream for good measure.

The hokki... well it tasted like hokki. I didn't like it too much but I think the hokki I had in Japan tasted the same. The amount of rice was perfect as well. Not too much, not too little. I also had the Caterpillar Roll and the American Dream Roll. Both are unagi-based rolls and they were good. It was on the menu, but they didn't have hirame. bummer.

The only complaint I have of this restaurant was the grumpy old sushi chef . I'll refer to him as Gosc from here on. You'll know who I'm talking about when you go there.

I guess it was because he was busy, he seemed really crabby and didn't acknowledge us at all. We tried to get his attention and he told us to wait. There was a sign on the table to tell customers to order a little at a time. We did that when we ordered, but the Gosc growled back at us and said something like ""order more at once because it's busy and that's easier for me!"" To be fair, I think it could've been a language issue. He may have had problems expressing himself in English and it made him sound like a Gosc... Or maybe he WAS a Gosc. His mood did improve once the busYness subsided and we were able to make some friendly small talk afterwards.

Most sushi buffets don't offer fresh fish or great service, so I didn't go into this place thinking that I'd be striking gold or discovering great quality sushi. However, I was pleansantly surprised at the quality of the sushi, and the friendly service. It wasn't the best sushi I've ever had, but it wasn't all that bad. The fact that the fish tasted fairly fresh, and that I didn't have to worry about the price (since it's a flat-cost)... made this a pretty good place to dine. I also came here with several friends, so it's definitely a suitable place for groups to gather. The friendly and noisy atmosphere made it a nice place for younger crowds, but I think in about 5-6 more years, I may think this place is a bit too noisy for me to have a pleasant dinner with friends...

This is the best sushi place ever...
I mean I've been to several sushi restaurants all over before...
Plus, my parents own a sushi restaurant in Billings, Montana.

I like to go to this cozy little restaurant whenever I have my chance to go to Las Vegas. Also, I like this place.. because it's not too fancy and you can just casually sit at the bar.. and chat with families and friends.. and don't have to worry how loud you get.. Well.. at some point you need to shut up! lol

I went again for the second time two weeks ago. (Since I don't live in LV, it was only my second time.. how sad..) Everybody had their dinner around like at 8pm and.. somebody said.. let's have sushi tonight!
ok... we had a pretty big dinner.. and sushi? but who can say no to Sushi-mon? So everybody started to walk the neighborhood for like an hour or two to burn some calories before we went for sushi.. (Hey! anything for great sushi! lol) then.. we went there like at 11:30pm.. still open and very busy.  Though they were out of serveral kinds that I really liked, but, at the same time, we went to the restaurant like an hour or two before they closed.  It was great even if I couldn't get my halibut and the other goodies.  

Ok.. here is what I think of Sushi-mon.

First, the qualitiy of the fish.. is great.. I think it was like close to $30 for dinner.
You have about an hour to eat up all  you wanted to eat for sushi.
a whole HOUR!!!!

They have so many other choices of sushi to pick from.
When I went to Sushi-mon for the first time like two years ago, I was a little skeptical about the quality, freshness, variety of the fish.
Then I looked at the menu.. I was surprised by the variety of the sushi, appetizers, and dessert to pick from!
Then they were not pre-made at all!  they make it right front of you once you order it.. depends on how many orders or how busy they are.. it takes about 5 minutes to get your order! Hey! c'mon! five minutes? That's so quick!
quality and freshness of the fish... wow... that's another jaw dropping situation.
I don't know how they afford all that!
Very fresh.. tasty.. good quality of sushi!

I know they were fresh.. and good.. because I also have a great knowledge of sushi by working at the sushi restaurant for so many years.
You can have my word on it! I promise you, you won't be disappointed if you like sushi.
Go down to Sushi-mon once you are in Las Vegas!
They are cheap, fresh, and very tasty!
It will make your belly very happy!

Thank you for great service once again, Sushi-mon!",64NibzPeVDbls44EqrxIbw,0,0,5,y3VqATj_lZcUtvAOXlnVEA

I ordered:
Ikura nigiri.  My usual because it's my favorite and i order it everywhere i go.  It was nothing special and actually I was disappointed.  The roes were visibly small and very fishy which usually means it's not fresh.  
Sashimi lunch special.  It came with 3 different sashimi (albacore, tuna, salmon(the usual)) but again, very fishy and really nothing mind blowing.

BF ordered:
Lunch special.  Chicken teriyaki with a cali roll cut, salad, rice, and some pasta salad?  The pasta salad part was a little weird for me but the dressing on the lettuce salad was refreshing and the cali roll cut was delicious.  The chicken was a little fatty so that wasn't good.  

Our overall experience wasn't anything memorable.  What makes me hesitant on going back is because the only good part was the cali roll and i think cali rolls is little bit too standard for my taste.

i was disappointed my first time. they did not have an alcohol license at the time.  (I want to drink Sake and SAKE BOMBS, argghhh!!!!)  the service was awful.  the waiter kept reminding our group that all-u-can eat sushi had a time limit and that we had to finish all our orders, including the rice.  i was truly offended at the comments.  i came from Reno, where i still believe the concept of all-u-can eat sushi at the sushi bar began (this was about 16yrs ago...props to Sushi Teri).  We were also very hungry, it was not necessary to remind us.  i mean it's even written in the menu.  at that point my friend and i was pissed.  the two of us to start a mission to target one item on menu and make them run out of it.  we  targeted the mussels.  we kept ordering 4 orders of them (about 5 times).  it came to the point where our waiter kept avoiding our table and avoiding making eye contact with my friend and i.  i finally got him to return to the the table, so i can ask for some more.  he was apologetic to tell us that he can only give us 1 more order because they had no more left. ha..ha...ha  our mission was complete along with eating several orders of sushi, some tempura, some edamame, yellow tail collar, and some ice cream and mochi.  
the all-u-can-eat  menu is quite extensive.  they have several types of appetizers, nigiri, hand rolls, long rolls, and dessert items.  i haven't tried that many rolls b/c i just love nigiri and the rolls fill you up too fast .    im disappointed that they limit you to only 2 orders of ama-ebi and toro. i think their ama-ebi was crap anyway.  i don't think it's really sweet shrimp.  yeah, this is one of the better all-u-can eat sushi place in vegas, but i doubt it is the best.  so the search goes on....",Zr4N9sG31fybEa-l3a_46Q,2,3,3,c25s5VoVKgTBSzbVOywr1w

GOOD:
- orion and salmon lover rolls
- unlimited ice cream. our party of five AYCE'ers ordered a bowl of green tea and red bean ice cream EACH
- these aren't on the menu and thus are limited to one order per person, but definitely get them! toro, amaebi, uni. unfortunately they were out of the uni, but we maximized the other ones
- other limited items that are on the menu (sake shooters, yellowtail collar, oysters)
- salmon and albacore were decent

BAD:
- edamame was straight up disgusting. it was all wrinkled like it had been reheated several times and the pods were chalkier than normal

The atmosphere is really good, and the restaurant seems to buzz  with everyone having such a good timel
Tried a Royal California roll.  This is a california roll that has been deep fried.  I can't even begin to describe the tasty goodness.  I think the crunchiness of the rice really makes this roll special.
Also tried a mexican roll - very spicy  I loved it. 
shrimp tempura- extremely light and crispy.
chicken teriyaki- so good and not too sweet.
JJ roll - was extremely good and even had asparagus in it. This was new to me. But the flavor and texture was amazing.
We tried the Alaskan Snow crab - VERY SWEET! it was good but only a one timer for me ... not my fave.
I truly enjoyed how fresh the flavor and texture of our food was. The servers were great and helped explain what was in a roll. Or suggest a roll... or even answer mundane questions they probably get all the time.

Last Samuri Roll: spicy tuna, cuke, cilantro and topped with shrimp and spicy mayo. Very tasty, would order again.

Orion Roll: spicy tuna, cuke topped with cajun albacore and garlic sauce. Again, very good.

Oh! Philly: salmon, cream cheese, cuke deep fried. It wasn't a favorite I'd likely pass on it next time.

9-1-1: Very spicy tuna, only a slight heat at first, but then the burn follows. Very good, but do have a drink onhand. 

Baked Green Mussel was recommended by the waiter. Flavor was good, but it was overcooked and a tad chewy.

Cinco de Mayo: Like jalapeno popper on steriods... fried pepper, cream cheese, spicy tuna and topped with spicy mayo. Yum! Yum! Yum!

Finished with green tea ice cream, creamy and delicious.

Man, something must have happened since our last visit here, because the quality, servuce and food  in this place was very disappointing.  An soon as we walked in, there was a foul odor like they might have had a sewer overflow problem recently.  We were looking forward to some good sushi, so decided to stay. Sat down and waitress came over to take drink orders, I asked about the Japanese beers if they had any REAL Japanese beer from Japan.  She spoke very condescendingly and said that "" All Japanese beer are from Japan!"" which is not true - it's all right on the labels.  Kirin, Sappora and Asahi all have associate breweries in US or Canada, but a few of the true imports are available in certain restuarants.  She asked if I wanted the regular bottle or the large bottle and when I asked her how many ounces were in the large bottle, she couldn't answer that.
We ended up with a different waitress and she was very polite and friendly.  As usual, we went with the All You Can Eat.  The edamame was either old or overcooked.  The Hamachi, Scallops, Uni and Ikura was dry and dark (and this is an understatment) meaning that these items have probably been sitting out since lunchtime or worse.  My wife ordered the Tako and it was so hard and rubbery that she couldn't even bite it in half.  I looked over at the main sushi maker behind the sushi counter and he saw me and looked down - he knew of our disappointment and couldn't even look me in the eye.  Will never eat there again and will tell all our friends from Hawaii about this disappointing change in their quality.

- Fresh fish / creative rolls
- Has an extensive All You Can Eat Menu (rolls, sushi, appetizers, dessert)

- Can order half rolls so you get a chance to try out every single roll on the menu
- Friendly staff / customer service
- You can order even when you are not done with your previous order when doing the All you can eat.

- Only 60 Minutes to do All You Can Eat for dinner!

I usually come here for the AYCE special. You have two sides on the menu and the appetizers and ice cream desserts are also included in the AYCE menu. 

The shrimp Tempura and the Ahi Poke are my two favorite appetizers. I will usually order five servings in one sitting. ;) Great stuff. 

My newest favorite roll there is the Mesquite Roll. Its a Spicy tuna roll topped with Raw Salmon and Mango strips topped with a mango chutney sauce. This roll is refreshing and different from the usual rolls on the menu.

Sushi Mon is def. the best for all you can eat for locals. You get the same thing for lunch, so it would be better to go for lunch if you can and pay less.

Drive 6.5 hours to Reno and eat at Sushi Pier!!!

I've been eating sushi since 1984. Way before it was cool. It has always been my favorite food and something I crave regularly. So when I moved to Reno, NV I was excited by AYCE sushi places with reasonable prices and an incredible selection of nigri, maki, and appetizers. 

I came to Vegas for a job interview, which went pretty well I might add, and rewarded myself in a typical fashion, with AYCE sushi. I figured how different could it be?

I scoured Yelp for a while and came across Sushimon and Yama Sushi, the two most reviewed AYCE spots around. I chose Sushimon based on Yama reviews stating that they pre sliced their fish and one person had seen cockroaches. 

I pulled up and the place was pretty full, good sign, so I sat down and ate. The only memorable things were hamachi Kama and tempura sweet shrimp heads, and they were memorable only because they aren't typically available at my sushi spot in Reno.  

As a sushi fanatic, there is a price point at which I would rather enjoy the taste and art of well prepared sushi, than gorge myself on very mediocre stuff. And at $30, this hits that spot!

Bottom line is people from Las Vegas should know what good food is, and this sure ain't it.

2.5 stars for friendly sushi chef, hamachi Kama, sweet shrimp heads, and plum ice cream. They also get points for serving half rolls.",vHc-UrI9yfL_pnnc6nJtyQ,2,0,2,RjtllkgIlxMUlucQkK3rhw

Sushi Mon changed that. Found it out of the blue, and never looked back. They have AYCE and a la carte menus, and handle each with grace. 
My experience?
~ The sushi and rolls are always delicious. They handle special requests easily (i.e. I would like this roll, but with salmon instead of tuna, soy paper instead of Nori, 911 sauce on the side, etc.)
~ They remember us. There is something to be said for staff remembering you, and bringing your drinks (water with extra lemon, hot green tea, etc.) without you even asking.
~ The sushi chefs are personable and fun, and make for a good experience. 
~ The wait staff are super nice, and always make us feel welcome.
~ They have a frequent AYCE card - get stamped every time and the 10th time is free (might be the 11th- I don't eat AYCE, but the other half does, and they don't even hesitate to honor it)
~ It doesn't matter who your waitress is; everyone will help you.
I just went there last night with my other half, and his parents, and we had a great time. The sushi was excellent (tuna melted like butter) and the rolls were excellent.

P.S. The ""Love Boat"" is an amazing deal. Salmon is tender (it's a filet, and cooked - delicious), california rolls (just ask for the sushi bar to make them right then - they will), edamame, chicken yakitori skewers, salad (their dressing is YUM) with chicken, miso soup, and tempura shrimp and veggies. All for $11.95. Great deal, and comes with a delicious sliced orange dessert too.

2207350,2009-11-08,0,m_CqRpEZ2XDH3fp-KFAycQ,"A VERY GOOD AYCE SUSHI PLACE ON THE WEST SIDE
Sushi Mon is on of a myriad All You Can Eat (AYCE) Sushi restaurants throughout Las Vegas. For the most part, I have had favorable experiences at the AYCE places in Vegas. In the old days, AYCE meant Buffet Style like Makino. Makino was fine, but sushi lovers knew that the price you had to pay for AYCE was that it was not as good as Made To Order. But a few years ago the AYCE trend caught on at many of the good sushi places that were only set up for Made To Order and that is when AYCE Sushi really took off. Really, there are so many AYCE Made To Order places in Vegas I don't know how the places that don't have AYCE stay in business.

In November 2009, AYCE Made To Order Sushi in Las Vegas is going for between $24 and $28. My eleven year old son, Tristan, can eat $28 of sushi in about 15 minutes, so we make out way ahead, dollars wise. What would normally be a $150-$200 bill ends up being just under $100 for three people (with drinks and tax).

In Henderson, my favorite place is The Ka (Warm Springs & Green Valley). The sushi is top-notch for AYCE and the atmosphere is actually very good for a sushi place. Most sushi places that put any effort into their atmosphere tend to charge much more than the other sushi places, but not The Ka. Additionally, the sushi chefs at The Ka have quite a bit of personality (which makes up for their challenged English... hey, I can barely speak any Japanese, if THAT is what they are speaking, so they're doing much better than me on the bilingual thing.)

Now that we're living on the ""West Side"" we have to find a place to get our sushi fix. My girlfriend lived over here recently anyways and Sushi Mon was ""her place."" We actually went to Sushi Mon for our first date although neither of us were really paying much attention to what was going into our mouths in the restaurant that day.

The quality and selection of the sushi is very good. I like to gage my sushi places by the quality of the salmon (aka ""sake"") and I was not disappointed. It was very soft, smooth, and very tasty. My girlfriend likes to use the Yellowtail as her gage and it certainly passes muster with her as with me. We had a variety of the typical rolls you can get in Vegas and each one of them was good to great.

The atmosphere is typical for Las Vegas sushi restaurants, at least the non-casino places. It always seems to be busy here and it seems they would be able to fill a few more tables if they had the room for it. Not much for decoration but there's nothing disconcerting about it either. The most important part is that it is clean, which it is. The sushi chefs were very good and surprisingly fast (in spite of a packed place). I wish they had a little more personality but I probably need to go back a few more times and start some kind of rapport with them and they'd probably be just fine.

Here's a kicker for me: THEY HAVE A STAMP CARD. Your 10th AYCE is free, which is like getting $2.80 off each meal. Not all places do this in Las Vegas and if you're looking for a new ""favorite place,"" this certainly helps tip things in favor of a place who does have a stamp card.

If you're looking for All You Can Eat Made To Order Sushi on the West Side of Las Vegas I would recommend that you check this place out. I'm sure there are other good places in the area, but this one is good for me.",_fFpucW8mSKvFJ46zSJCrg,1,0,4,yvJvW9XpM6PXOs_t8JjgfA

* Yellowtail Collar - Super dry. Texture of dried chicken with the taste of fish.

* You can order rolls by half order so you can try more things

* They have two price points so you can save money if you don't need some of the pricier fish (uni, salmon/yellowtail collar, snow crab, etc)

I'm just not.  I have this weird fear of fish, live ones, and sashimi still scares me a bit because it's a little too close to the live fish state.

So when all my friends go to Sushi Mon for the All You Can Eat special, I totally get teriyaki chicken and shrimp and veggie tempura and it is GOOD.  I'm pretty picky about my tempura, and theirs was great.

My friends always finish amazing amounts of sushi, and they bring it out pretty quickly.  It tends to get really crowded and the tables feel a bit cramped, but that could just be your ever expanding waistline as you consume mass amounts of food.

Also, their octopus and seared tuna is DELICIOUS! Do not start ordering rolls and appetizers. Try to stick it out with the nigiri.

It was crowded at 11:00PM, we took that as a good sign. We were sat right away since most of their tables were finishing up. 

We opted for the AYCE option, at about $25/PP that's a decent price for us. We started with some nigiri and apps- -  I always order ikura (salmon roe) and my husband orders amaebi (sweet shrimp). The waiter mistakenly brought me over an order of  ika (squid). Honest mistake because I do have a Jersey accent and both words sound the same. I tried it  since it was AYCE, but really didn't like it. It was really tough like old bubble gum. The ikura came out after a few minutes, and it was good, not great though. it was very briny and almost too fishy. My husband said the sweet shrimp was very tasty. The salmon, garlic tuna and green mussels were good. All cut extra thin, but we expect that from local AYCE spots. 

We both tried their Spicy yellowtail handroll, it was really spicy and delicious. Not too much rice and the fish was rolled to the very bottom of the handroll. 

The hurricane roll (Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado topped with salmon tempura, smelt eggs & green onion drizzled with eel sauce spicy yum yum sauce & mayonnaise) was icky. It was drowning in mayo. I didn't see that at first, so my first bite was brutal. It's $13.45 on their regular menu. That's not $13 quality. The mayo to roll ratio was overwhelming. I scrapped it all off, while the waiter watched. It was the worst part of dinner. And to think-- that's one of their ""special rolls'. yikes. 

The Orion roll (Spicy tuna and cucumber wrapped with cajun albacore drizzled with garlic sauce) pretty good, not overly impressed though. The cajun seasoning was barely there and the albacore was paper thin. 


The Tempura icecream had soggy/raw tempura around it, It wasn't cooked long enough so that resulted in a sloppy and unappetizing mess. 

With sake and two AYCE the bill came out to $80. The price is good but I'm not sure if we will return. Although some was good, there are too many restaurants that exceed our expectations here in Vegas. There's no reason to settle for sub par food.

The taste was not sweet and rather bitter, then I realized the orange was rotten on the bottom, and you can clearly can see it from the outside only when you turn it around. Well, this can happen to any restaurant. I guess the reaction of the waiter was more disappointing than the rotten orange, once I show him my plate he never offer to replace the orange, simply reply with ""I'm sorry about the orange"" I was not looking for a free meal, I only expected the waiter to care a bit more and asked me if he can replace it. Well... I was charged full price; but they got $0 tip well deserved.

Suggestion to the restaurant:
If you fell most people don't eat the 1/2 orange at the end of their meal, simply add a plastic one just for looks.

And I also found out that it's not entirely correct that the two Sushi Mons are not related.  Apparently the old manager of this Sushi Mon on Sahara started up the Sushi Mon in Henderson - there may have been like some sort of payment or franchise type agreement.  

Currently, the two are separately owned and run, but there is a little bit of a relationship there as you can see.  However if you ask them they will say they are not related.

We went there for lunch, but they let us pay the dinner price, so we could get some of their specials for dinner, like the ebi, uni, carpaccio, fresh oysters, oyster shooters, toro (was not good). 

My favorites were the super white fish, albacore, uni, all the carpaccios (albacore, salmon, red snapper)

It may have been the boiling rage I had just experienced in finding out Kan Pai no longer offers AYCE that sent me into a sushi rage. Luckily, Sushi Mon is no more than a quarter mile down the street so we decided to give it a shot.

At $26.95 this place was HOPPING. One of my main issues with this place is that it is very small and when it is busy it can become extremely cramped looking at their gigantic menus. Couple that with busy sushi chefs who only occasionally look your way and waitresses that have to be stared down for even a glass of water and I was already a bit perturbed even before trying anything.

The rolls were subpar and their special mango mesquite roll just had some funky flavors going on and I couldn't figure out if it was tasty or disgusting which is a first for me. Their nigiri menu was plentiful and tasty, and the best roll is definitely the chubby roll. I would HIGHLY advise anyone against ordering the 9-1-1 roll as it is legit painful to eat. Normally when I order the roll elsewhere it is a bit spicy but nothing compares to having to eat about half the ginger in front of you and having to guzzle 3 glasses of water and STILL having the burning sensation on your tongue.

Neither one of us were in the mood for rice so she ordered some edamame and tuna sashimi. The edamame was blah but the tuna was fabulous. 3 huge cuts of fish that were so rich in color and soft and buttery in texture.

I got the sashimi dinner ($17.95), which came with miso soup (very good) and salad (nice, crisp lettuce with a peanut sauce drizzled on top). The sashimi consisted of 5 different types of fish, each with 3 generous slices. And by generous, I'm talking about half an inch thick. The tuna was clearly the best of the bunch, with the yellowtail not far behind. The salmon was also delicious and the white fish was decent. But the disappointment of the night was the albacore. It had a weird after-taste to it. The dinner also came with 2 pieces of crab. Before I ordered I wasn't sure if the dinner would fill me up but it turned out to be plenty of food. I didn't even have room to try the strawberry mochi.

The service was a little spotty. It took a while to get our drinks and they forgot the edamame, so we had to remind them. Then after we finished eating we waited and waited and finally had to flag someone down to bring the check. But, the fish is good enough to warrant a return visit.

There are dozens of items on the menu, everything made to order, including nigiri, special rolls, side dishes and rice bowls.

The baked green mussels are out of this world. I must have had five on my first visit. I also can't get enough of the special rolls like the spider and volcano.

One of my favorite sashimi is salmon, and since it is not one of the limited quantity ones, I tend to order a lot of it.

We placed quite a few orders of various Nigiri sushi with some extra things like miso soup, shrimp tempura, and a few other things (I got a 4 piece Mexican roll).  The fish was fresh and tasty.  

Service was good.  There was a misstep or two when something ordered was not brought but given the amount we ordered, I guess I could expect this.  

My biggest issue with the place is that it is so small.  5 people at one table and with all the plates that were brought meant that our table was quite crowded.

Let's face it. Sushi is expensive.  $2 or 3 per piece is a bit spendy IMO, but hey, that's pretty much average cost for nigiri.  And I am a hungry boy.  I am there to taste the fish, so I generally don't order rolls, much less dip my fish bits in soy sauce.  That said, I usually do all you can eat ($28-30 dinner, 1 hour), and for that price I think the quality of the fish is quite good.  

For starters, I usually get about ten pieces yellowtail (which is my fave and always good here) and 6-8 pieces garlic tuna (also snacktastic!)  That alone pays for the AYCE.   Other faves are tamago, the grilled eel (unagi), and salmon.  

They also have a nice variety of sides included on the menu, and I usually get at least  three or four things including shrimp tempura, gyoza, miso soup and sometimes a seaweed salad or ahi poki.  

To satisfy my sweet tooth, I get a green tea ice cream and a lychee sherbet, because honestly, why make tough decisions when I can have it both ways!  Sometimes a mochi too.

When I finally put the sticks down I've generally put away about $80 worth of food.  Cuz that's how I roll.  (Get it, ha!)  Not bad for $30...

I always sit at the bar and the chefs are attentive and speedy.  The waitresses, even though they are focused on waiting tables, are usually pretty good about getting your drinks, side orders, and clearing empty dishes.

Their ayce menu consists of a bunch of nigiri sushi, special rolls, and some appetizers/side dishes. 
The gf & I ordered mainly the nigiri: Yellow tail, Salmon/seared salmon, and Albacore/Cajun albacore. The shrimp tempura was really good too.
Although their nigiri pieces were sometimes small, I was never unhappy about the fish to rice ratio. It also didn't matter if the pieces were sometimes smaller - we sat at the bar and whenever we wanted to order something we just yelled it out, like ""3 more salmon!"" and in less than a minute the chef would hand us the plate of our order.
Usually at any decent or good ayce sushi bar, you gotta wait a good amount of time in between orders, plus you're given a limit on the amount you can order at a time, and sometimes they even pack on the rice to try to get their customers full. Sushi Mon doesn't do this. They say that they give you a 60 minute time limit which sounds not cool at first, but when you are constantly handed plate after plate of whatever you order, I guarantee you'll be full within half an hour. At the end of our meal my gf & I had a 15+ stack of empty plates in front of us, I'll post a picture of this soon. Highly recommended you sit at the bar.
A good 20 minute drive off the strip, but totally worth it for a very satisfying meal with friendly and attentive servers & chefs.

Notes:
*They don't put a full wad of wasabi like authentic Japanese sushi bars, but they do put a little smudge in there. I loved that they did this, since most American Japanese sushi bars don't make their nigiri with wasabi in it. My gf didn't like this, so she requested that they don't put any wasabi in the nigiri sushi and the chefs gladly did this for her.

The place where most of my paychecks were spent when we lived in Vegas.  I think it's obvious: I LOVE this place.  The quality is fantastic... by far the best I've had in Vegas and in LA. Plus, they have AYCE (all-you-can-eat) for around $26.  That's pretty hard to beat. Service is friendly and quick. And they're open until 2am.... Just when I thought it couldn't get any better.
 
My favorites:
1) Miso Soup
2) Albacore tuna
3) Yellowtail
4) Super white tuna
5) Shrimp tempura
6) Tiger Roll- shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, spicy tuna
7) Rainbow roll- California roll wrapped in tuna, shrimp, salmon,  yellowtail, & white fish topped with smelt eggs
 
The tiger roll is a must. It's texturally balanced and has an awesome flavor combination.  The super white tuna is dressed with the most amazing ponzu sauce....  I have yet to find one that comes close. Sadly, they don't serve strawberry mochi anymore which was one of the best I've tasted.

We opted for the lunch buffet which includes everything on the menu.  I appreciate that you can order rolls in halves because we would definitely not have been able to try the many other dishes.  The down part is, if you don't finish everything you have to pay for it. Thus, half orders are a great way to prevent waste.  The lunch buffet is about $24.99 and the dinner buffet (with the same options) is $26.99. 

Baked Mussels: WOW WOW. I don't even like mussels but these were so amazing! Make sure you are careful though, I grabbed the shell right when the waiter brought it out (because I'm an impatient pig) and boy did I burn my thumb, it was red for the rest of the day.

White Tuna and Uni (Eel) Sashimi: AMAZING AMAZING. The only negative part is that every slice of sashimi is over rice.  And you have to eat all the rice or else you will get charged.

Monster Roll: They make it sound like it was a ginormous roll.  The size and taste definitely did not meet my expectations.  Definitely a PASS. Don't even bother or think that this is a challenge. It is full of rice and does not taste good.

This was a must for my entire family, visitors, business associates, and I  would sing it's praises for years.  I felt it was as good as it gets.   Then, it changed owners.

The new owner, a Japanese lady, watches every serving and every thing the Chefs do. One by one, the good chefs left. Things got worse;

I was living in Maui, and used to fly back on Hawaiian Air every six weeks. I would send the crew from Hawaiian Air and every Islander I knew, to this place. 

One night, I came in and the owner thanked me for all the people I sent. To reward me, I asked if I could substitute seaweed salad for my Miso Soup, with my Sushimi Dinner. She said, ""That's expensive, and I would have to pay extra"". 

Bottom line; My son's girl friend called Sushi Mon ""the Mc Donald's of Sushi"".  She was right.  Read my review of Jjanga Japanese Grill. It's better quality, a little less money, and superior quality and service.

Also, you won't have to wait long for a table or seat at the bar.

I was introduced to it by a friend/former boss. I've been to others (Sushi Fever- overpriced) but this place is the best!  If you're visiting LV,  and you want to try a sushi place, come here. I raved about this place to my husband, and when he finally had it, he agreed. At first, he didn't like the time limit, but he fould out that it's not so bad after all. There is a punch card (buy 10 get one free) available. You can order half rolls (except Spider Roll). 

There is sushi bar seating (where we sit) and tables lining up the walls, but again, this is a small place. It's got a good reputation, so I imagine that there are regulars. (Note: there is a funny smell near the bathroom, so I am mentioning this if you are particularly sensitive to smell, do not sit in that area.)  Anyway, once seated at the bar, the waitress takes your order for the side orders/appetizers like seaweed salad, edamame, soup, etc. (Note: the list is huge so pace yourself.)  
The sushi chef asks you for your sushi order soon after. Try the specialty rolls like Mexican, Caterpillar, Hawaiian- seriously the sushi roll menu is two pages long (front & back). Once I tried the Spicy roll and it was al little much for me. The chef kept looking at me to see if I would finish it and I did! It may feel overwhelming at first, but remember, you can order half- rolls. The fish is so fresh. It's so good. The service is excellent. Note: if you're ordering something that take more prep time than usual, order that first, rather than last. For dessert,  I like green tea ice cream. There were a couple times that I had so much sushi that I didn't have ice cream (And I love love love ice cream!). Lunch AYCE is $23.95 and Dinner AYCE is $28.95.

I'm gonna throw it all up anyways. jk. I tried inducing vomiting after a few large meals and could never get it to work out. I just dry heave. 

Speaking of dry heaving (unrelated), I bent over today to pick something up and close-mouth burped. I TOTALLY puked in my mouth. My stomach was pretty empty so it was like, pure bile. GROSS. I cried. 

Anyways. My circuit: 
two orders of salmon 
two orders of hamachi 
hirame with shiso 
half Moon roll (to satisfy the whitey in me) 
half Frying Jason (to satisfy the glutton) 
baked green mussel 
white tuna 
otoro 
green tea ice cream 

If you pay item by item, it averages $5 per for nigiri and $8 for rolls. 

You have to strategically order your items. Get your nigiri started first. Then order a roll during round two because it takes longer. There is a science to AYCE sushi. You must optimize your time. The chefs can get busy. And don't be a douche because the chef's mutter indiscretions about you under their breaths in Japanese if you piss them off. 

I also get a hot green tea. But that shit is piping hot. I have to let it cool off for like 10 minutes before I can even think about sipping it. I can't even hold the damn cup. 

I'm bummed they discontinued the anago. There aren't many places in Vegas where you can find anago. They also don't have Spanish mackerel. (Ichiza has it sometimes! Carpaccio) 

They also have uni. Its not on the menu. Neither is the white tuna or toro (I think). 

A big bonus is that they're open late, 2a. Wait, is that a bonus? Because I always gorge myself then want to go straight to bed. I went tonight at 1245a. It looked like the crowd was winding down. Then at like 115, three parties walked in. Last call is at 130. Normally. Unless three parties walk in at 115a. 

Sushi is aways good with a beer and sake.

I went about 11:30 pm since I was straving for some sushi.  I went for the all you can eat and ordered the standard nigiri of tuna salmon hamachi unagi and tai  with some apps like yakisoba, gyoza, poke salad and curry rice,  when i got the sushi it was all good until i took a bite of the tai (snapper) which had a big ass bone in it which stuck all the way in my teeth.  i told the waitress of the situation and that my mouth and teeth was bleeding from the bone which i showed her.  and she went off to tell the chef.  what I noticed was appauling.  he was surprised that their was a bone in the sushi for one.  then nobody came out to say sorry or anything to me..  the server came back and said that the chef was going to make me another order of snapper sushi.. as if that was going to solve everything.  i guess they thought a new order of snapper was going to stop my mouth from bleeding...  well the chef never came out to appologize and after 30 min of waiting i got tired and asked for the check thinking that they would comp my meal and stuff.  Well I thought wrong.  they brought my bill for the full price.  this is when i really got pissed off.  I went over to the cashiers counter and I told them if they was going to give my a discount at least for causing my mouth to bleed from their incompetence.  Since they didn't even say that they are sorry or anything.  i then asked for the manager or owner.  the server said that they didn't have a manager and the owner only comes on the weekend. I then asked who was in charge of the restaurant cause there has to be someone in charge.  the server said no one was in charge.  I then asked to speak to the owner on the phone.  the server said that she can only call her at a certain time and she can not give me her number.  so I gave her my number so the owner can call me.  

I have yet to hear from her.  so I will be calling her soon.  I have contacted the better business bureal and advised them of this situation.

Oh!! and the worse thing is after I paid the bill the server has the nerve to ask me if I wanted a stamp card where if I eat there 10 times the 11th time is free.

This place has its fair share of innovative rolls to appeal to the not so adventurous sushi eater and plenty of the classic nigiris for the traditionalists.

I tend to stick to the nigiri sushi to start with and it was actually surprisingly better than I expected.  Don't get me wrong, its not the fresh from the fish monger, like blue fin tuna from Japan or toro, but its better than a Todai or most other AYCE places.  They even allow you to do individual nigiri or half rolls so that you don't waste!  What a great option.

This place is no where near the strip, you're going to take a lovely drive on Sahara before you reach this place. it's easily missed in this plaza since it's kind of hidden in the corner so keep your eyes peeled.

We were warned that this place gets packed so we actually arrived at 5pm for dinner on a Saturday during Memorial Weekend. It was probably a good idea to eat early anyways since we were planning to tear it up later on that night. The 7 of us all sat at the sushi bar. The restaurant isn't that big in general.

We now had 60 minutes to play man versus food. For AYCE, that's the time limit. On a good note, they had unlimited hot sake free with the AYCE too but we passed on it to concentrate all our efforts on the food. Anything and everything on the menu was a green light. Wo said keep en eye for the items on the boards but I never saw the boards.

I honestly have low expectations for Japanese AYCE period. Todai was great the first 2-3 times then you realize how whack it is. Fortunately, Sushi Mon wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Plus they pumped out our orders with a mad quickness (made to order and not already rotting out). They have everything from sushi (cajun albacore is note worthy) to crazy rolls and you can even order ice cream (green tea, plum, and red bean) for dessert. I don't think the AYCE is mandatory but if someone in your party decides to go with it, I believe everyone on your table needs to be on the same page. Nah mean?

Be warned though that some of the rolls are rice and kewpie (Japanese mayo) heavy and that's going to put a major road block in your appetite. For some of the crazy rolls (8 pieces) you may ask them to make it a half order. If the roll is 5 pieces like the spider roll (soft shell crab) they will not make a half order for it. Every creation on the menu sounds crazy but stick with what you know first. Play it safe before you venture out too far. Certain rolls like the lasagna or volcano rolls are way too rich and heavy. Those are under the baked rolls. I'd keep away from those.

All in all, the place wasn't too bad. I wouldn't say I need to come back to Sushi Mon everytime I am in Vegas but if someone was to ask for a Japanese AYCE joint, they would be mentioned. The quality was decent and the waitresses were friendly. With drinks, tax, & tip, we ended up paying around $30 something each. Not too shabby.

all you can eat lunch for $21.95.  came here with my cousins and i let them do all the ordering.  there were two large full pages of sushi, rolls, specialties and sides to choose from.  we didn't get any rolls, because of the ""too filling"" factor.  i liked that the cooked items such as tempura and calamari came in servings of 4 pieces so it was enough for each of us to have one and move on to the next item.  the sides (cold salads) are a very good accompaniment.    

i never find the quality of fish to be that spectacular at AYCE places, but sushi mon was quite good!  the white tuna (that i'd never had before) melted in my mouth!    

end your meal with the plum ice cream.  with many pieces of actual plum in it, it's so yummy!  then again, since it's AYCE, get the red bean and green tea too!

When Kuge arrived, he noticed Sushi Mon was more packed than the his Smackdown Hotel.  But luckily Kuge and two of his friends were greeted instantly upon walking in by the friendly hostess and were placed at the sushi bar.

It was as if a double rainbow appeared in front of Kuge as he gazed at the AYCE menu and what Sushi Mon had to offer.  With a great selection of sushi and nigari, Kuge knew he had to try many different kinds of rolls to get the full Sushi-Mon experience.

Some rolls The Great One ordered:

Chubby Roll - Phenomenal,  it was only a 5 roll count but it was a great size and Kuge had no problems with the roll.

Sunrise Roll - Since Kuge isn't a great sushi elitist, nor is professional food reviewer, he is stuck using generic terms without much description.  But other wise, Kuge believes this roll had a variety of flavors and was decent.

9-1-1 Roll - The Great One never takes spicy rolls seriously since he loves to pretend to be Mexican and believes he can handle spice.  The 9-1-1 roll completely destroyed Kuge's tastebuds with insane spice he never expected to happen.  Unfortunately the spice overcame any flavor Kuge would try to find.  

Fresh Water Eel - Alright

There were a few other ""special"" rolls that Kuge ordered, but he is sadden that they were only average at best.

The service from the cooks and speed of the order Kuge received was great.  The staff was friendly, although the friends of The Great One complained that they didn't have that good of service which displeases Kuge.

No worries though, Kuge acknowledges that he strives to create perfect reviews but even they are long winded.  So in order to please his fans:

TL;DR - Kuge was saddened that most of the rolls he ordered were average (with an exception of chubby roll) and even though the service was good for him, he cannot give Sushi Mon  no more than 3.5 Rock Bottoms out of 5.  He definitely prefers Sushi Mon over Hakari for AYCE but that's as far as he'll go.",UER4m0CBVgcFlVbMqhCvCg,2,1,3,raSDIwVgMyS2dTFpCcJLow

First off, the food is just average compare to ayce sushi restaurants in socal. I would give 3 stars just for food. What really took all the stars away from my review was their service. First round of order that we put in went okay, but our second round we had to wait 25 mins! The chef who took our order wasn't even making our food. They only had two chefs working to serve the whole restaurant, which was filling up for dinner at the time we went. I am usually a patient person, but this place just crossed the line. One of the waitresses came by to ask if we were doing okay, and I told her we've been waiting for 25 mins and all I got from her was a sad face... seriously? I wasn't expecting to get trolled by a waitress during my Vegas trip, but it happened today.

The size made me uneasy but by the end of the meal I thought it contributed to it's charm. We sat so close to everyone that we shared conversations with the other tables about our Sushi and everyone was offering their Sushi to one another to try. I thought it was a fun and a unique experience in that way. I liked that the all you can eat sushi included desserts and appetizers for 60min. The menu is hard to navigate for a Sushi Simpleton like me . I don't order any sushi that has raw fish in it ..I mainly stick to the rolls with the fake crab . One side had the descriptions on it but the other side of the menu ...you are on your own! We had the Royal California Roll which was deep fried. I tried something similar before and I wasn't to crazy about it so we started with a half order. I love that you can do that because I hate when you're forced to eat the whole order just so there will not be an extra charge! I loved the Royal California it had a nice crunch to it. I also tried the J.J. Roll which had Asparagus and cream cheese in it ..that was also good. I ordered one of my regulars The Mexican..nice and spicy. We tried the Snow Crab roll (limit 2 per customer) ...thank goodness there was a limit! It was hard for me to eat it because it just didn't taste good. I was let down that they had Chicken Terayaki but no beef I know this is a sushi place and not a steak house but it would have been nice. The chicken was tasty and tender and the sauce wasn't too sweet. I ended my meal with green tea ice cream ..I was so stuffed I could only eat half of it.. I'm glad I found this AYCE Sushi place that is opened till 2am on my side of town ...it's comforting to know a place I can go when the craving strikes!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,0,0,4,q1kJnAdFui0eMSdzJHrkWg

The sushi chefs here are not Japanese (unlike the other location) and so while the quality of the fish were mediocre depending on the type, the cuts were very poor. Some were very sinewy and unchewable, others you can tell were scraps. Even the eel nigiri had lots of bones and it even hurt as I swallowed it down my throat!

The fish to rice ratio here was also noticeably lower than the other location. I don't get why they charge $2 more for AYCE but yet have a lot less on the menu? A handful of nigiri and roll choices were missing, and no mochi ice cream or tempura ice cream here. 

2 stars for quick service (less crowded here), and a couple of the nigiri were quite good. Otherwise, our party of 3 all agreed - don't bother coming here. There are plenty of other delicious AYCE sushi places in Vegas :)",DTrGpB_mctcobCUwhMJsfg,2,0,2,SYFqHf3bfjufadvPWVC37w

The service was bad. The sushi was below mediocre. I wasn't even sure if the rice was sushi rice; it fell all over the place.

I've never turned oysters down before in my whole life other than this time. We were also limited to one order of white tuna each.

Quality at this place has dropped recently the last 2 visits. I'll do another revisit in a couple of weeks to make sure its not a fluke.

@ Uni - It doesn't have the same sweet creamy texture as previous visits. One of the Uni was not scooped out properly, so can still see what looks like the vein of the sea urchin on it.

@ Toro - This was a little disappointing. The fish didn't really taste all that fresh.

Other items that also seem to have dropped in quality is the shrimp tempura, gyoza, eel, yellow tail, albacore, and red snapper. 

This place does have fast service, but a little disappointing they do enforce their 1 hr time limit now. One of the cool things about this place was you had fast service and they would let you keep ordering way past the 1 hour.

Either Sushimon has let quality control slip a little or they've cut some corners recently. This looks to be a trend since Danica L. did report Sushi Tachi, owned by Sushimon has quality slipping as well. If its quality control, its understandable. If its the latter, its unacceptable with so many AYCE sushi places around. Still Sushimon has one of the fastest service and the most variety.

Their miles roll was kind of ordinary but the salmon was fresh as well as the cucumber.
The eel sauce by itself is pretty salty as well as the freshwater eel roll. 

The service was not too bad. It was about a 20 minute wait for the sushi. 
Their AYCE was pricey for how much variety they have.

When you hear of a all-you-can-eat sushi place, you generally think of not so fresh, huge fistful of rice to fish ratio sushi.  At Sushi Mon, you get good quality sushi in unlimited quantity.  Unlike other buffet places, where the sushi is already made and set out for you, Sushi Mon makes everything as you order...the gluttonous hour begins.

Far off the Strip on the west side, Sushi Mon is always packed with a young energetic crowd.  The all you can eat menu extends not only to sushi,but literally everything on the menu from rolls, apps, teriyaki, tempura, salads,... the fried yellow tail head with ponzu and the seaweed salad are good starters.  You can only get 1 order of Uni per customer but I don't like that nasty orange puke anyways, so it doesn't  affect me at all.  Try the '911' roll if you dare, its got a huge spicy kick to it that'll wake up all your senses!~  No matter how full I get, I always end my meals with green tea ice cream, fried banana and strawberry mochi.  Be sure to get started on a punch card so you can get the 11th meal free!

I recommend you sit at the sushi bar so you can tell your order to the sushi chef.  There is usually a line out the door and no bar to wait.  There is a hookah lounge on the other side of the strip mall, but otherwise, but I like to take the time waiting, salivating through the window and mentally preparing myself for the hour of sushi chaos.",23G7HKTbd6huWgLVp3u8pA,0,0,5,rzJli1_57LO5zWZqdlrAPw

The rolls are very good quality.  Get a roll with ""yum-yum"" sauce.  It's delicious.  There are a wide variety of rolls so you're bound to find some that you like.  Most AYCE places I've been skimp on the quality and usually cover all their sushi with the same mayonnaise sauce.  Each roll we had here was different, but still flavorful.  They give you a good amount of fish with each roll.  They don't have too much rice and the toppings are generous.

You can also order half-rolls so you can get a taste of different things without stuffing yourself on one.

The best part are the specials.  The specials are included in the AYCE and are written up somewhere.  My favorite was the Salmon Carpaccio.  Their sashimi was very smooth and generous! They also had salmon collar and hamachi collar along with uni, snow crab, sweet shrimp, and several others.  

There are a couple reasons why its not five stars:
- It's pretty small (we came with a big party and had to split up)
- The servers mixed our orders up with the table next to us several times
- They ran out of green tea  and plum ice cream.
- Our seat was by the door and everytime someone opened it, we got that cold Las Vegas air

This first round of sushi that we ordered, was... decent, maybe 3 stars, however when we ordered more sushi the fish was visibly lower quality fish (especially the albacore nigiri). I tried it anyway, knowing sometimes I can be picky about the way things look, and I had to spit it out into my napkin. I've never tasted such disgusting fish. My hubby even had to take one of his rolls apart because the fish on top wasn't fresh. The gyoza was awful. I think the best thing we got was the green salad with soggy tomatoes. 

In addition, this place is full of rules. They have a time limit of 45 minutes for their all you can eat menu - which is stressful and annoying when you are paying so much. Then, when you don't finish your CRAPPY meal, they have the nerve to charge you for the leftovers. 

And last but not least, Sushi Mon also gets one star less for decor - they had pieces of paper all over the walls with items you can order put up with scotch tape. I'm not super picky about decor, but it does matter some to me... SO NOT MY PLACE.

This location being only a few miles from our house, I was eager to find a dependable neighborhood sushi joint.  The waitresses were nice enough when we first arrived.  There were no tables available so they told us to get started at the bar and that we'd be able to move to a table once one became available.  We ordered a few pieces of nigiri sushi while at the bar and then a table became available.  Once seated our order came out and we got all sorts of things we hadn't even ordered.  We ate them since we got AYCE and weren't being charged per piece but I was wondering if that was the norm?  After the nigiri we ordered a couple half orders of rolls and that's when the service slowed WAAAAAY down.  We were left alone for a good 15 minutes.  This is a small restaurant and we were sitting right by the register where the waitresses were constantly gathering.  There was no excuse for how hard it was to get any one of the three waitresses' attention.  I had no idea there was a one hour time limit (I just read about it on some other review below).  I was full way before the hour limit but what if I wasn't?  They wasted 15 minutes of my one hour by ignoring us!  The quality of sushi was so-so.  It wasn't awful but it wasn't great either.

We came right as it opened at 11:30AM on Sunday, it actually opened a little bit earlier too, which is also a plus. Came with a party of 6 for AYCE, so we were able to try a lot of their sushi & rolls. Their cuts of fish were thick and very good. Our favorite sushi was the salmon and yellowtail. The tuna also was not bad though I didn't try any of their other sushi. As for the rolls, we ordered the Vegas, dragon, rainbow, miles, and the Orion roll.

4974737,2006-08-31,0,m_CqRpEZ2XDH3fp-KFAycQ,"Craving sushi, but wanting to be off the strip, I was referred to Sushi Mon by a resident of Vegas.  
My dining companion asked if this restaurant had a time limit on how long you could eat there and I looked at her like she was insane.  Well, she was correct to ask as there was a time limit on the All-You-Can-Eat Sushi option.  (I had yet to have ever experienced an All You Can Eat place that had restrictions on time, and this apparently was going to be my first.  Were they going to be put a timer on the table?)  

Their menu selection is quite large and ranges from appetizers, to nigiri, to dessert even!  There are a few items that you are limited to (2 per person) and there were out of a few 'hot' items on a Saturday night.  We were told there might be a wait, but there actually was none.  We sat at the sushi bar so we could order directly from the sushi chefs.  Quite a few other patrons and the sushi chefs commented on how surprisingly slow it was that evening.  Despite the slow night, the chefs were too busy watching TV to pay much attention to the customers and we felt like we had to wave them down to get their attention.    

The food was okay - there were some good rolls and some alright items.  I recall not wanting to finish some cooked fish appetizer I ordered.  It wasn't all that great.  The spicy tuna roll wasn't up to par with what I had in mind.

Service was okay.  I think one of the waitresses didn't understand English very well, so she had to get her colleague to help us out a lot.  We were a little offended when we ordered our dessert and they returned with the check as well.  (Uh, we weren't done yet, and our hour wasn't up yet either.) 

Overall, I felt rushed watching my 'hour' time limit.  I think we paid about $25 each for this All You Can Eat but figured it was a good deal.  After all, once you order a couple of rolls and nigiri, you've spent that much money already.  If All You Can Eat Sushi is what you want, Sushi Mon will give that to you. And with the various choices from hot and cold items, it gives you a bigger range to choose from.  

Can't beat mochi and/or ice cream for dessert either!   

It also says on their website that they are open until 2 am!  Wow.

Side note: They also have a frequent eater card.  We like places that offer frequent eater cards. Be sure to get yours!

Update! 11/05/07 - Went back last night, and dinner is now $25.95.  Limited items on the all-you-can-eat is the Toro, Amaebi, Uni, Baked Oyster, and Sake Shooter.  They only have two ice cream flavors - Green Tea and something else, and only Strawberry Mochi.  The BF and the brother loved the Baked Mussels.  They also offer amaebi head soup, which is a nice twist.  Nigiri was pretty good with good slices of fish and small amounts of rice.  We definitely appreciate they aren't trying to stuff us with the rice!

It's pretty small so I would not recommend coming here during peak hours -- I've seen it get super busy after 6:30p so expect a wait. I've always come at odd hours or ordered ala cart to go.

Their appetizers I haven't explored too much of. I regularly get seaweed salad, poke salad (I mix them up together), dynamite and fried oysters. 

 Love that they do half rolls as I like variety and dont want to be stuck trying a new roll and discovering I don't like it yet have to commit to consuming it. Love their moon roll and sunrise roll! I'm not even a ""roll person"" but I enjoy those two.  I normally go simple though- am a sucker for salmon skin handrolls and can eat quite a few of these. 

The chefs slices nigiri thick-this place doesn't skimp on fish and do not pile on too much rice. The fish is pretty fresh and the bulk of what I eat is nigiri so I can tell when it's not. I have some days here where certain fish is just okay, but overall they keep a decent standard. There are a few things not on the nigiri menu such as Toro and White Tuna so be sure to ask the sushi chefs if there's off menu items that day. Both are my fave and not to be missed, there is a 1 order limit on the Toro, Amaebi and Uni though. Off the regular menu, I tend to grab yellowtail, albacore and their cajun albacore is nice to have something different. 

Usually places slow the service to pace you through your AYCE to eat less,some I think purposely put some of the expensive things til the end, some ""lose"" your order too- not the case here. They serve it pretty fast and as you ordered it.  We've been here plenty of times when there's few tables near closing and gotten great service. That standard of service still held when nearly a dozen are waiting outside for a table. To me, that deserve a lot of merit and is why I gave them 5 stars. Sushi Mon staff really works hard to attain good service- they work their butt off! Hats off!

Also the little old lady is so cute. She remembers our names and says it in her cute accent. Specially my boyfriends name....Scott is Scott-to. I appreciate and impressed she remembers us each time we come in and the chefs and servers know us too...but then again, we've been in so often it's hard not to notice.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,3,4,ZCwls2zOPzb-YQ26RmCo8w

We went there on our last trip to vegas. Our party of 6 consistent of two grandparents (not big sushi eater), hubby and me and our two kids 6 and 3.  Both of my kids are skinny, the older one is 41lb and the younger one is 29lb.  You got the picture, they are not big eaters.  

First of all, on their menu, it says quite sternly that no sharing with children.  So, we ordered a chicken teryaki meal for my 6 year old and a separate california roll for my 3 year old.  All adults got AYCE sushi.   They brought up the miso soup, and my 3 year old wants some so I fed some to her.  The waitress who was not even our server gave us the evil eye and actually brought it to our server's attention and pointing fingers at our table.  Very unpleasant.  I over heard our server to her that they already ordered two meals for the kids then she walked away.  What a turn-off! 

All the servers are not very friendly, kind of stone face and got a feeling they really want you to be done with it ASAP.  

Maybe because I got too spoiled by a local AYCE place here in LA (sushi Joe).  They were so friendly and told us to order 1 cal roll for the kids and they don't care if they share.   On top of that, they brought out extra apperizers for my kids and made sure they were not spicy.   What a difference.

5305102,2014-02-09,0,m_CqRpEZ2XDH3fp-KFAycQ,"Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you the greatest sushi I have ever had in my life. I lived on Japanese food for many years, but even I have to vouch for this place, despite its location in America, in the middle of the freakin' desert of all places.

When I say this, I am talking about the quality of the food, the system of pricing, and the accessibility of the restaurant itself. Everything is to the advantage of the customer, which makes me wonder how this place stays in business.

First of all, quality. I don't know how they manage to keep the raw fish that fresh this far inland, but they make it work. The fish tastes like it was caught that morning. The fact that they make everything to order and slice the fish in front of you certainly guarantees a product right at the threshold of optimal quality. I ordered from all over the menu, but after a couple bites of the salmon nigiri, I have to say that this is my favorite. It's a real basic menu item that was exceptionally tasty and needed little or no soy sauce to enjoy. The seared salmon is pretty good, too, in case you're in the mood for something a little more cooked, but definitely try the salmon.

Secondly, the price. Currently, the All-You-Can-Eat Lunch price is $21.95. Normally it ends up costing that much anyway for a full meal when you order over the counter for a fresh cut, so an all-you-can-eat for that price is pretty insane. There were a few things that I probably would have never ordered À la carte like the Mexican Rolls, but because I didn't have to worry about overspending on a gamble of taste, I was able to try an atypical variety of sushi adapted for the American palate. I never found anything I didn't like, however, and we probably tried a quarter of the menu over the course of two visits to the same Sushi Mon. Mind you, it is a big menu.

Lastly, the accessibility of the location. The Western Sahara Avenue location is far off the Las Vegas Strip, so it keeps the hoards of tourists away. On the two occasions my dad and I came here, parking was not an issue, and neither was seating. The only drawback is that for any all-you-can-eat order, you are restricted to a certain time limit. I suggest coming here on a weekday off-peak so that you can order without having to worry about long waits. When it gets busy, it can become difficult to flag down the sushi chef.

Whatever their secret is, I hope the same Sushi Mon will always be there whenever I visit Vegas (the last time I was here was in August of 2012). It tops my list of favorite restaurants and is certainly worthy of being my 100th establishment to review. Thank you, Sushi Mon!!

Its a little far off the strip, about 8 miles, and when we got there around 8:30, we had to wait about 20 minutes.  It was worth the wait and drive tho!

We decided on their $29 all-you-can eat sushi and drink for 1 hour.  Usually I wouldn't consider an all-you-can eat sushi place, but the fish at the sushi bar looked pretty good.   Besides ordering Sushi, you can order their special rolls (Dragon Rolls, Spider Rolls, etc), hand rolls, side dishes (seaweed salad, miso soup, etc), and even green tea, red bean, or plum ice cream.   You can pretty much order any kind of sushi except for maybe some of the more expensive ones like Sweet Shrimp (ebi), and there's some items that you can order only 1 of, like Snow Crab Sushi, Saki Shooters, Fried Oyster and maybe a couple more.  Everything was very good and the fish was very fresh, almost melting in my mouth.  Probably the only thing I wouldn't recommend is the Yum Yum Scallop Sushi.  I love scallop sushi, but this was actually baked scallop with shredded imitation crab meat mixed with an orange colored mayo...wasn't that great in my opinion.  So other than that, the fish was great....salmon, albacore, tuna, etc., The Snow Crab and Fried Oyster were excellent, and even the ice cream was good.  And they didn't put huge blocks of rice with the fish to fill you up either :)

Service was excellent.  The japanese waitresses were very nice and prompt.  Sushi was served very fast and they didn't rush us out after an hour, even though they said there was an hour limit and we were stuffed by then anyway.  We easily ate over $200 in food (according to their a la carte prices). I was also happy to spend $38 on sushi rather than on a Vegas buffet.   I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for sushi in Las Vegas.

I first came here with a group of friends for a birthday. Two in our group were locals and took us to sushi mon. Its a small place but worth the wait and the money.  That time I secretly shared the sushi with a friend and it was soooo good!!

Second time I was there (around August) we ate at sushimon for dinner our first night there and I wasn't disapointed! We sat right at the sushi bar and ordered all the sushi we can ever want~ My friend tried the uni (the urchin) and dispite its poop looking apearence she said it was pretty good. I loved the shrimp shushi and the sauce they put on most of their rolls were very flavorful! I ate my money's worth! 

I recomend after you eat, go to the restaurant that is behind it. I forgot the name of it but its a restaurant and karaoke place. Their karaoke is fairly priced and they have so many songs to choose from.  The rooms are very pretty too! I wish my bedroom looked like it! pretty decorations and atmosphere!!~",-Jv3-9d-DoVkjno-MGzOFQ,0,0,5,7e2QWcG9yCGpl9gQUn_CDw

PROS:
all you can eat EVERYTHING ON THE MENU!!! i seriously do not know how they don't go out of business with the selection and price value.  everything i ate was SO good! granted i am mainly a sushi roll person, there was all types of food not just sushi.  THIS PLACE IS A STEAL!!! it makes me mad they don't have places like this in hawaii...

CONS:
it's not that big, so (especially if you're with a group) be prepared to wait.  supposedly there is a 60 minute limit for your all you can eat, but i wasn't too aware of it.  hope and pray there isn't a fat family sitting on the table infront of you, cause you're gonna wait forever...and they don't take reservations

WHAT I ATE:
(All you can eat for $26.99)

- Chubby Roll
- Vegas Roll
- Takwon Roll?
- Red Bean (Azuki) Ice Cream
- I ate more but i can't remember...

WHY HERE FOR YOUR VACA?:
if you love legit japanese from japan sushi or hate raw fish you're probably not gonna care for this place too much.  but if you're like me and CRAVE sushi rolls all the time, you'll be in heaven!!! there is so much to pick from, you'll feel like your head is going to explode.  it is far of the strip (about a 20 min or $30 cab ride)...but if i go to vegas again...i am DEFINETLY coming back!!! with my stretchy pants...",-YXR32cxurtDwq2AnsIh4w,1,0,5,_dFdE4rXh2IdR0bo70nZpw

This all-you-can-eat sushi place was recommended to me by one of my old co-workers in Vegas, and from that day forward, we became regulars - regulars to the point that the host, waitresses, and sushi chefs knew us and knew what we were going to order for our first round!  I didn't become broke because of my horrible gambling ways in Vegas - it was because of the frequent visits to Sushi Mon!!!  Damn you Sushi Mon!!!  Damn you for being so damn good!!! *shakes fists*

We LOVE this all-you-can eat sushi place where they make the sushi to order - it's not a buffet style place.  As Sushi Mon professional gorgers, we know not to order everything all at once the first time around - you have to know how to space out the ordering and the eating - otherwise you'll become full really quick!  The fish is fresh, the nigiri sushi fish to rice ratio is perfect (not too much rice), and the flavor of some of the sauces they use on some of the nigiri sushi and sushi rolls are amazing!  The service is good - sometimes the language barrier becomes an obstacle, but the food comes out quick.

Be sure to order what you can eat - they charge you for whatever you leave behind.  It hasn't happened to us though.

i suggest going in for lunch since you'll get your monies worth. 
here's a hint to ordering: don't order rolls! 
i know it's tempting, but it's all rice! why would you pay over $20 to get full off of rice?! be smart!! 
order the expensive sushi. ask the chef what their special is for the day. 

there's nothing more to it. good sushi. good price.

My boyfriend and I have been there twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. the dinner all you can eat is about 26 and the lunch is 23. If you dont plan on eating more than two full rolls, make sure to choose the a la carte option. The all you can eat apparently comes with a free side, which includes stuff like miso soup and a free dessert, which we were never able to try. The cooks make the sushi in front of you if you sit at the bar. I would definitely recommend sitting at the bar. The chefs are very nice, but have pretty big accents, so sometimes it was hard to understand them. They also have a frequent diner card, for a free meal after your 10th meal. Definitely recommend to anyone in the area. Try the JJ roll which is fantastic.",elOzEbUKELHdLNfahFQegg,0,0,5,Pj_AvMM4MoKUG69d_jLMbA

5687185,2010-09-01,0,m_CqRpEZ2XDH3fp-KFAycQ,"Definitely one of the best AYCE sushi places you can find in America. The consistency on the quality that they provide on their menu as well as the variety available is quite enticing to bring back heavy eaters like my party and I even if we only have 1 hour to eat.

The trick as my group came to learn was to order as much as your heavy appetite can handle. They may warn you that any leftovers immediately becomes charged extra at ala carte price BUT if you are certain of your appetite, JUST DO IT.

Another tip is regarding the limited items (meaning one per person). I only remember two items, which I ordered both of and are fried oysters and sake shooters. Now, if some in your group doesn't like (or can't) eat either of these two BUT you can and want to, ORDER on their behalf.

Favorite rolls/nigiri/sides
1. Salmon - exceptionally fresh. BIGGER plus was when it came out as FATTY salmon. OMFG, I had to order even more.
2. Hamachi
3. Miso soup (practically my buffet sake)
4. Tuna

If you like spicy, apparently, there's a roll called the 911. I gotta love our waitress that night when he dared one of my party to take the spice challenge. He looked like he was going to combust.

Other notes: Last few times I visited were during dinner and although the restaurant was full, food comes out fast pretty quickly. Service is exceptional and a plus.",4DN9WS2gf7Y2SYh0LaqDqA,0,0,5,P1WqXgqtVRuGuoCWjs5k8w

The fish was not fresh.  Everything had this soggy texture that comes from defrosting.  I work at a restaurant so you can't fool me.  Although the portions were decent, everything that had some kind of sauce was over done.  Our soft shell crab had so much ponzo sauce, it became overly salty.  That's the typical way of getting a customer to fill up on water and have them stop ordering food.

Overall, this place wasn't as good as we expected but we still left with a full belly.",zFYs8gSUYDvXkb6O7YkRkw,2,2,2,heZoN8C-poTyQe3jhxsUzw

I am a sushi fanatic and this is the best sushi buffet ever! Everything is made fresh to order and they have a wide variety of rolls. The best thing is that you can do half orders so you can try everything!! I really don't get how they make money?! haha They even have a punch card and after 12 meals you get a free one! They aren't skimpy on their fish and they don't over power the rolls with excessive rice. 

The only bad thing I have to say, is that sometimes the sushi orders aren't cut the best and it has the little silver fiber thingies which doesn't make for easy eating. But the rolls are so yummy. They had a new roll ""mesquite"" which was reaaaaly good - spicy tuna roll topped with mango, salmon and a yummy mango sauce. The mahi roll is good - it has mahi mahi, asparagus and shizo leaves. The chubby roll, hawaiian, spider and orion are all great too! They have poke and seaweed salad too! 

If you go with people that aren't huge sushi eaters - they can either order off their menu or do the all you can eat which also includes tempura, gyoza, teriyaki, miso and more. Plus ice cream!! Red bean, green tea or plum wine. So worth the money!  And they are open til 2 AM so perfect after those late night gambling runs!!",lu0td3A2uIT6gbl2dAkljg,0,0,5,R3b1NYL_627BD4DokFBZ6A

Yezzzirrr! 

Vegas for the Pacquiao vs. Cotto fight brought major crowds any and everywhere. Times like this it's nice to explore the part of Vegas that you tend to forget about. You know the part where you realize there's more to this city than just a strip of street infested with over the top hotels.  Don't get me wrong I love it as much as anybody else, but sometimes the crowds can be a bit much.  Escape for a couple of hours from the madness isn't a bad idea.

This place was a nice change of pace.  Head sushi chef was way cool.  Made to order rolls made in on like Donkey Kong. Place was full of locals so it had to be legit.  One of the highlights to a highlight packed weekend!",rzIy4JY0QxnOSrgnAQwdoA,1,1,4,xDfOsisWvs2MHgBlNpjv4Q

Pros: 
- Great quality fish, not top-quality, but better than most places. 
- Expansive menu with plenty of creative and delicious rolls to try.
- Friendly sushi chefs and wait staff.

Cons:
- Slightly expensive for an AYCE
- Nigiri often has some problems. The rice has been inconsistent, ranging from being too warm/cold to be having too much/little vinegar. Also, the cuts of fish on nigiri tend to be on the smaller side. 
- No fresh oysters. AA-BOOOOOOOOOo.

Bonus Points:
- Fried Ice Cream
- Hamachi Kama
