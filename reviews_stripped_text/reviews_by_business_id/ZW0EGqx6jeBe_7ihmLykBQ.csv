483603,2015-09-02,1,ZW0EGqx6jeBe_7ihmLykBQ,"I have ordered many times from multiple Jimmy Johns around town and my co-workers also do. The last three times I have ordered from this location, they have botched the order. Today was the last time I will order from them. I placed my order for delivery. I ordered a country club with no tomatoes, a bag a chips and a coke. The delivery guy handed me a bag with two sandwiches ( again, I only ordered one ). One of the sandwiches was correct to my order, the other was not. I explained to the driver what happened and he asked me to call the store. As I explained to Robin ( who was very cordial and identified herself as the manager) she asked me to return the receipts and they would refund my money and it would take 2-3 days. I asked how am I to know that it will be refunded and how I would prove the purchase without a receipt. Reluctantly I sent the receipt back with the driver and eventually received a call back from Robin. She said that due to the way their system is set up, they had to refund the entire amount but would need to place another charge of the amount that should have been charged. So now, they want to charge me again before my money is secured back to my account ( putting me out a total of over $30 until 2-3 days from now) because of a mistake they made. I informed her that I would never again order from that location and would pass this information on to my co-workers. Very poor customer service.",XfiTr4Sja8JWl_vu7QA3ZQ,3,1,1,oC1bsPgxp6O3xI4xmOhZLQ

The cashier made me feel as if it were my fault by telling me that I was doing it wrong and that I needed to swipe it correctly. She the took my card and swiped it herself.

This location is horrible and has now thrown me off of Jimmy John's for good. 

A few days ago we placed an online order for pickup. I had a Vito without the extra lettuce, and cucumbers. My son had a turkey sandwich with missing mayo packets on the side and no additional bacon that I paid for, my daughter had a ham sandwich with missing mayo packets. 

When I picked up the sandwiches (which I paid for online) the guy at the register shoved the bag at me like I was a burden to him. He didn't even have me sign the credit card slip. 

We get home, after 30 minutes due to other errands to find all the above things wrong. My son was highly disappointed as he loves bacon.  So I called the store. I was greeted with ""oh let me remake it for you"" sorry nope I'm not wasting my time driving back. Then they offered to give me a discount on my next visit. When I mentioned I wouldn't be back he said  ""well what do you want"" with an attitude. I said I wanted at least a $3 refund in a $19 order. I wasn't asking for much. He offered the discount again, to which I refused. 

I asked for the supervisor, they had me on hold about three minutes and the call was dropped. He took down my name and number prior so he could have called back.

My sandwich got delivered on time, but when I opened up my bag with my name on it(from the printed receipt from the store) the sandwich was incorrect. The sandwich I received did not look appetizing at all, it also did not help that I was looking forward to the sandwich I ordered.

He responded with more blame towards me saying I grabbed the incorrect bag, I told him that I was not an idiot and he then responded ""You can get your refund from corporate, I am not giving you a refund"" and hung up on me. I called back and he answered again( did not give his name again), I asked him to give me the number to corporate and he said don't you know how to look things up on the website and hung up on me again. I called back again, and someone picked up the phone and hung it up. My number must have come out on caller ID and they didn't want to deal with me.

I could easily give it to someone here in my office instead of knowin it'd be thrown away!
Horrible to know food is being wasted for a mistake THEY made!",MUuCwGe4aWLWd95VbWOZTw,1,0,1,WkY-0e1Cq4ZruPVYgSyFwA
4952751,2016-11-06,0,ZW0EGqx6jeBe_7ihmLykBQ,I order Jimmy Johns almost every time I'm at work near this store. It's a fun game of what'll be wrong this week. If you ask for mustard you don't get it. Ask for it to be cut in half? Can't handle that. Not to mention every single time the delivery driver asks me to sign but they don't bring a pen and expect me to pull one out? The food is always okay but it's just expected to show up incorrect.,p-mOqQtmbDJuV71jJa5V4g,2,0,2,vEZe2HiN5HPxv6Ze2DkX2g

Our office spent $50 on sandwiches for our lunch. we ordered a total of 5 sandwiches which were on our receipt. When we returned to the office there were only 4 sandwiches in the box and when we called to notify them, he said we were lying ! First off that is not the proper way to take care of your customers. He said he did not have proof that there were only 4 sandwiches in the box. will never return here! they can have their shitty ass food along with the shitty ass customer service ! ill stick to Cappriottis ! :)",S0Vq9tM-CcI2ULpMxc0xrg,0,0,1,m8yLMvLxXzqoYsi0n2zc3A

I asked for it to be put in a bag. He rudely says ""so you want a bag"". He put the sandwich in a bag and then tossed it to me with the comment ""here you go sport"". Great customer service. When my son opened the sandwich there was no mayo. I've eaten at many different Jimmy Johns and never experienced service like this. Won't return to this location.

5308878,2018-04-21,0,ZW0EGqx6jeBe_7ihmLykBQ,"I put in an online order for my director and myself while at work.  We had a VERY busy day full of conference calls and meetings and would not have time to run out to pick up any lunch.  We both had the beach club, hers on wheat, and mine on white with extra avocado and cheese.  They were delivered EXTREMELY fast, as always from the time of ordering.  I think they came shortly after 11 AM, but, again, due to being busy I was not able to get away and eat until about 12:30 PM.  When I finally got to take that first bite...NO TURKEY!!!  I thought to myself, hmm, maybe it was just the first bite, so I took another bite, no turkey again.  Now it was time to deconstruct the sandwich, sure enough, there was no turkey in it WHATSOEVER!!! I basically had a cheese, tomato, lettuce, and avocado sandwich.  Uhm, OK. I need to get back for my next call, so, whatever.  I stopped by my director's office on my way back to mine and asked her if her sandwich had any meat on it and she said, ""TONS!!!"".  BINGO!  I know what happened!  We had a good laugh about it and continued on about our day.  When I had some time later that afternoon I called and had the oh so lovely privilege of speaking with Scott.  Scott is a douche.  I really wasn't expecting much besides an apology, but, Scott was very adamant that he made those sandwiches himself!!! OK, great! I guess Scott doesn't understand the definition of a mistake.  I'm sure he was angrily making our sandwiches (as Scott CLEARLY is not happy with his life decisions) was interrupted, and when he came back went back to the same sandwich again.  Well, after all his douche-ness I told him I would just contact corporate and his response was, ""Good, I hope you do.""  Nice one Scott, high five buddy!  Unfortunately the response I received was that this was a privately owned store so there wasn't much corporate could do aside from forward my complaint to the franchise owner...figures; with my luck, it's probably Scott.  However, I get my satisfaction in the end by contributing another one-star review to their measly two-star rating.  If I only I checked yelp first........",1JDG0rCU_GGjMUxJVLvnGA,1,0,1,02c3t7kmiomZrDAHLXHENQ

I made an order st 10:42a today. While I can appreciate an influx during lunch, I made sure to order early to avoid such a delay, even including a tip on my checkout. 

I made my first call to the store at 11:18a. I was put on hold immediately only to be attended to 2 minutes later. After explaining that I had made an in-app order and was just checking on my order (Store is 5 mins away), I was told that the driver had left with my order 20 minutes ago and so it should be there within seconds.

I made my second call to the store at 11:34a. Again I was immediately placed on hold. Returning just seconds later this time, I was quizzed delivery or carry out. After explaining that I had called ten mins earlier about my order, the gentleman on the phone, while polite, was quite curt in reminding me that the driver had left 20 mins ago and my order should be arriving soon. He also mentioned there was a lot of orders at the moment. When I exclaimed that I had ordered an hour prior to that at 10:42am he said that didn't matter. And then was there anything else he could do for me. Sensing this person did not want to extend any level of patience to me, I politely thanked him and informed him I'd relate the rest of my dissatisfaction online. He said that would be fine and terminated the call. 

Jimmy Johns is a brand and that brand right now is freaky fast. Customers have come to expect a level of service consistent to that brand. In my opinion this experience was NOT freaky fast. While polite, the employees had long the phone offered no or little patience and certainly no resolve. Since this is simply a review with a ranking, that is what I've done.

I was the only one in the store, ordered my sandwich from a very nice girl then the young guy who made my sandwich had such a ' I don't give a shit' attitude. I believe his name was Troy, forgot my sprouts. I asked for them and a napkin , he appeared annoyed, no apology.  He pointed at the napkins behind the counter ( which were right next to him) two times for me to get. He was too lazy to take off his gloves while making a sandwich. As I sat and ate, I listened to their chat about movies and such, the two guys - Sam( the manager) and Jared. When I complained about the customer service after, the manager Sam gave me major attitude, made me feel like I had no right and was stupid and smirked and rolled his eyes at me. I left, called to speak to Sam the manager, who informed me he did not have a district or regional manager for the store, said he could not give me his manager's information and hung up while I was still talking. Worst customer service ever, and this Manager Sam is an asshole who thinks he is irreplaceable.",o1_Hx7RPW9xBxwdpO81dXA,0,0,1,OAk_8riXpTVwO6G_lhiP5g
