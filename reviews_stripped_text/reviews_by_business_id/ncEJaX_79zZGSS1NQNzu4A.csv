I ordered and paid $4 for 4 pcs chicken TENDERS but he gave us 4 pcs MCNUGGETS.  He didn't give me receipt, but I noticed right after I got off from the drive-thru so I thought he would remember if I go back right away.  But when I went back and told him, he said it was my fault because there was no specification, and I need to pay $2 more if I want to exchange it to tenders.  If there was no specification, how can he receive order and make me pay $4 when 4 pcs mcnuggets are only $2???  If he told us more nicely, we would just forget about the $2 difference, but because of his rudeness we were so upset.",EbVs2GLI55mLHqf2Lfbv9Q,1,0,1,F8PECC2-oasyDzN6X3K3rQ
171033,2017-09-08,0,ncEJaX_79zZGSS1NQNzu4A,I went to McDonald's today after my son got off school . We ordered 20piece chicken Mc Nuggets and 2 large French Fries. What makes me so frustrated with McDonalds is that food is a 50/50 chance that it will come out fresh. I hate when my fries comes out cold or soggy. It's very rare it's fresh. Hot and crispy is the way I like it. I think they keep it under the heat lamp for way to long. Also the nuggets are rarely fresh either. And chicken nuggets that aren't fresh is plain disgusting. Also when you order 20 piece nuggets they don't give you enough sauce or they just forget your sauce . Which drives me crazy. The only thing I like about mc Donald's by my house is that they are fast and convenient . The price is semi affordable but not like it used to be. Their customer service is a hit and miss too. I truly only go here if my son craves it. But other than that I try to avoid the temptation !,RpAA13I1whe-acXsk0XluQ,0,0,3,Rz_5NApCUqP1EZ57C4vWqQ

The reason I'm taking the time out of my day to leave a review is because recently I had an unacceptable and quite unsatisfied visit where my order was given to me completely wrong. I return the next day to be called a liar by a lower manager, Maddy, after speaking with her the night before and then threatened of my return by the store manager Richard. Because they couldn't simply get an order correct or accept their mistakes. It use to be the customer was always right, now it's do whatever you can to not take blame and save your minimum wage job. For these ""managers"" to act as they did is unacceptable and unprofessional. This clown went too far and my next step is contacting corporate directly since local customer service was no help at all. Not a way of doing business. 

I highly suggest you save your time and money by not stopping at this location. The previous reviews say it all. This location is garbage and not worth your business. It has a one and a half star for a reason, which honestly is still too high.

And the drive thru associates are always very friendly. But I feel like I need to warn others that our last visit was very alarming. It was a middle of the night McDonald's run on the way home from work. The large soda we received was NOT safe. It was very clearly a cup of chemicals mixed with soda. Could be cleaner of some sort? Not sure. But it wasn't just faintly chemical-y, it was very strong. Burned my throat and my husband's throats. We were sick all night. We actually kept the drink to bring to management in case they wanted to have it tested. However, when management returned my call 2 days later, rather than trying to apologize or put us at ease, he was very defensive and proceeded to taste the Dr Pepper while I was on the phone to prove that it was fine - 2 days later. I told him, maybe the machine was cleaned with chemicals and wasn't rinsed, or maybe someone poured cleaner into a cup for some reason and then it was used for my drink. Could be anything, really. But he defended the restaurant again and said they do the cleaning in the morning, but we should come in for a free meal to try it again and see that there's nothing wrong with their Dr Pepper. I told this manager that I sincerely was NOT looking to receive anything, that a free meal is not necessary. I was only contacting them to make them aware that this happened because had I given the drink to my child who might not know not to continue drinking it if it tastes weird, things could have ended up very differently. It would be unfortunate for someone to become extremely ill or die because they refused to even try to get to the bottom of what might have happened. Check surveillance, do something to see if the employees were being careless or even by accident did something dangerous. I knew going into this that it was going to be pointless, but I knew I had to try. And furthermore, from a customer service point of view, maybe you should tell your customers, ""We apologize for the inconvenience, we will look into it and make sure this doesn't happen again"" or something like that, instead of trying to prove to me over the phone that I am wrong.

I told him the situation and instead of apologizing first thing he asked was do you have a receipt? Of course I do. I drove back to McDonalds, and before going in, I looked at my receipt. It wasn't that he forgot my two items, the order was incorrect completely. A random hamburger in place of the McDouble I asked for, and missing fries.  I walked in to see another customer complaining about a incorrect order, so this must be their normal service.I told them the situation, and again instead of apologizing for me having to come back and be inconvenienced 20 minutes ( 10 minutes both ways to location) I had to pay. I worked at McDonalds when I was young, and when a customer is inconvenienced, we would give it to them as a courtesy for the mistake. But I was charged. No worries. I wasn't looking for a hand out, I was looking for great customer service that obviously doesn't exist at this location. I learned my lesson.

Like many people, I have eaten at McDonalds all over America and even in several other countries.  I have to say this is probably one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been to other than the one in Manila in the Philippines -and that's only because I'm not sure that what was in those burgers was even beef.

Where do I begin? The service is terrible. I have never, not ONE time, gotten what I ordered. I get sweet tea when I ask for unsweetened. I get cheese when I ask for none. I get onions when I ask for none. I get 2 chicken sandwiches when I ask for 4 apple pies.  I have given up on going through the drive thru because I always end up having to pull around, park, go in and wait in the long line of teenagers getting shakes  just to get them to correct my order. And even then, they don't get it right and I actually have to tell them, ""No see, this is a Chicken Sandwich, I ordered a McDouble.""

The food is almost always cold. The burgers are dry and taste like they have been sitting on a shelf for more than an hour. And the fry's..ugh! When there are 6 cars in the drive thru and 20 people in line, I just don't understand how the fry's can be cold and stale. It absolutely defies logic. 

Yes, there are times that the food comes out hot. It's one of the reasons I keep going back. There's nothing like hot Fry's from McDonalds.. and also, just because it's McDonald's. Like it or not, it's a staple for working parents too tired to cook dinner after work some nights. It is unfortunate that they have no competition in the immediate area to keep them on their toes, otherwise they might actually try to improve their service and their product. I am sure they are turning a profit. No doubt. It seems to always be busy. However, I truly believe that if ANY other burger joint opened up right next door, this place would close down in a month. Every time I say I'm never going back, I still do. Unfortunately, tonight will be one of those nights as the kids specifically requested it. The shear dread of what I'm about to go through is what prompted this review.  

I really hope they improve. It hurts to have to knock a McDonald's.",CiPLSXLY2T3-bufr8ml5DQ,15,9,1,VXU-bgM5Bt3bB7y5JTgS1w

I get home, and there is no parfait.  ERGH!!!  Called the restaurant and it seems like them screwing up at the drive thru is common place.  She took my name down and asked if I wanted to come back this morning, or if she should add my name to the book.  

Now that one of my kids did not have their breakfast item, I continued to go through the bags to find out that there is NO extra butter, and they didn't include the picante sauce packets for the burritos.  

How hard is it for your employees to double check the bags before you give it to the customer?  I mean, you have the receipt that tells you exactly what to put in the bags.
