The waffles take up the majority of your plate and they are warm, soft, and have a great cinnamon taste to them.  And the chicken....WOW.  Light crisp breading on the chicken that's not too greasy.",WU1z9Nf5qXUjtsYfy6yv-A,1,1,4,gLPMkYNPftaWvOoW1iti6Q

I was looking for something different last Sunday morning and I remembered seeing this place on MLK.

I would agree with the other reviewer about the parking, small awkward and hard to get in & out.

It's a small diner with a booth along the entire front wall and several tables. A sign reading ""seat yourself"" greets you the moment you walk in.

The place is small but cozy with a TV in the center so every seat in the house can see it,

There is was only 2 servers and a large table there when I arrived so it took a few minutes to get drinks&menus.

The menus said stright up ""Just Chicken & Waffles""-and thats exactly what it was 2pc-3pc-dark,white,wheat,buttermilk,wha do you want.

In small print across the bottom it read ""Friday-Sunday BBQ Ribs $10""
I asked and she said""nope,chicken & waffles""

Well I got 2 breast,2 waffles and my son got the special 3 wings & a waffle.

The food came out real fast with hot syrup on the side and we doused our chicken in some hot sauce & tore it up.

Why have I never had this before, I bet I never even took a breath.

Some of the best chicken I have had. Not all deep fried & greasy or steroided out just sweet crispy & very savory.And the waffles were good too. what a mix.

This is a true dive spot DIAMOND!",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,14,11,4,b9ejMzpWNrcf4vB9KDgAhQ

I had the chicken n waffles.......Waffles were great the chicken tasted like it was old and fried too hard. My friend had the fried catfish mmmmm gooood...... I ate half of her's. Everything else was good. I would go again, but wont get the chicken",GBol-Msr7rH6qNO6rQTC6Q,0,1,4,vj2N7n9S9P-sycjveo5aIg
