I come here for the steak special that they serve here 24/7 for only $5.99.  You can get it breakfast style with eggs, hash browns and toast or pancakes, or dinner style with steamed and seasoned veggies, your choice of baked potato, mash, French fries or rice pilaf and a bread roll. The steamed veggies are never the same everyday so if you're picky about certain vegetables I would ask what they have that day.  The steak is good enough to eat with it's own juices and you don't really need A-1, but there's just alot of ligaments. =\

As for the service, they're really attentive and take care of you real well.  The other night we had Jermaine, he's a cool guy brings out everything quick and keeps the drink filled at all times.  It's pretty empty most of the time I go but I kinda like that.",wLc6l8v7O9hXjrDi3Q7tyw,2,2,4,gJu0G-kuZMeKJhIzUd0FmQ

The prompt waiter offered cheese, bacon, chives, and sour cream. I said sure..why not. Just watch out for the extra fees ie. cheese, bacon, chives and sour cream. :/
The potato needed all those toppings. So the extra fees was ALMOST worth it. I also had the salad. It was worth the $2. But not worth more then that. The steak wasn't bad. I ordered it med. rare. 
Dinner came with bread. Which was warm and soft. So all in all my $6 steak came out to be over $10. Next time, I'll just order it with the mashed potatoes. 
I had no problem with the service or the server. $4 house bloody mary was strong. 
I'll be going back :)

Place was not crowded 3/4 tables, 2 servers one about to get off. You more or less seat yourself. Server was quick w/ drink order and what I wanted. She offered a dinner salad ($1.99 extra). Waited and waited for salad, never appear. She did manage the salad for the couple seated after me. When my order came I queried her about the salad..she was the perfect ""blond""..she giggled and said ""my bad"" I forgot..really. Asked if I wanted now I said no. The meal..Baked potato must of been cooked early in the morning..inside of the potato was dark brown. veggies luke warm and the steak..hey it's $5.99 you be the judge small, grissled..but it was cooked med rare. Maybe it was a bad night, don't know, but will reconsider in the future....If your looking for a low cost steak dinner, try 
""The Pub""..much better...so on food  1 and for service -5. You know not once did she even offer to re-fill my ice tea...which really pissed me off.",DxQQUd-gbiMCzYznptFjog,1,0,1,fhR7_xUMwz3iF8Z-mfgyvA
