The selections with the exception of one or two entrees looked like they had been sitting out for hours. Food was barely warm at best. There were no trays for eating in. We were not offered any condiments or utensils.

4654839,2014-11-05,5,uTn8bL6sabHD2916u5mvkA,"DOWNTOWN SUMMERLIN'S PANDA

   My brother and I had been walking about a mile from Red Rock Resort to Sahara Avenue exploring the new star of Las Vegas : Downtown Summerlin. In the days before the restaurants open in downtown Summerlin for the Christmas season, there are a few choices as of November 4, 2014. Exploring  the southern quadrant of Downtown Summerlin where it abandons the unique pedestrian oriented streetscapes north of Dillard's for an ordinary auto oriented shopping center, my brother and I were hungry and we wanted to eat now. With Red Robin opening in a week, there were a few choices that included Five Guys and a hero place. We decided on Panda Express. 

  In Panda style, the service was good. In reality the service was better than a couple of full service restaurants I reviewed. When I say good service, I state that the employees were friendly and helpful. From ordering to paying, I was treated decently. On the other hand Verizon provided bad service. There was an issue with the Verizon signal in Panda Express and downtown Summerlin that affected my Internet experience. 

  The major flaw with Panda Express is that when an entrée is empty, it's display tray changes into an unappetizing display of tin, crumbs, and cooking oil. Some locations are more affected than others. The worst I have seen is the Pecos at Windmill Von's location. This location is moderately affected by this flaw. I would have preferred to order the egg plant if the majority of the tray wasn't cooking oil. I have always been under the impression that Panda Express corporate needs to develop a sheet or blanket to cover the tray when it is more cooking oil than entrée . Of course the panda, who in my opinion is one of the coolest fast food mascots, would adorn the cover sheet or blanket. 

  Fortunately a fair amount of the entrées were presented nicely. I ordered a two entrée combo with string beans and chicken, sesame chicken, fried rice, and chow mein. I appreciate Panda's noodle based chow mein more than some of the local Chinese restaurants in Vegas that include China Go Go. Panda's chili sauce added a burst of flavor to the chicken. With a medium Pepsi beverage, Panda was kind of worth $10 and change. 

  What are my chances of returning to the downtown Panda?

    Regardless that Panda Express is good fast food, I doubt I will be returning to this location soon. I am optimistic that several restaurants will be opening in Downtown Summerlin by Christmas. Before or if  I return to this  Panda Express, I would have tried a couple of Downtown Summerlin's restaurants. And Red Robin is on the cue of restaurants that I intend to dine in and Yelp. For now, I depart from the Downtown Summerlin Panda with three stars.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,11,3,aad2RtMuevWuox7n9RU3oA

We were craving Panda so we decided to go to this one while we were in Downtown Summerlin. It was my first time to this location and I was quite pleased to see that it had long tables that could seat groups of 8-10 people. 

I ordered my usual steamed veggies and Beijing beef. 

With one scoop left of the steamed veggies sitting in the serving pan they automatically made a fresh batch instead of adding the last scoop to my plate. They didn't ask if I wanted the last scoop.They just told me they would make a fresh batch, so there would be a 5 minute wait. I'd rather have some freshly cooked veggies, I really really appreciated that! It's like they read my mind. 

The service from the women creating our plates were definitely better than other Panda Express I've been to. The crowd rolled in right after I ordered so there were at least 10 people behind me. They were great at keeping the line moving. 

When I got to the cashier, I usually ask for water. But I noticed the Panda Tea Bar menu! This location has a tea bar! This was the first time I've seen the Panda Tea Bar so I decided to try it. As I scanned the menu, I noticed there were a variety of milk teas, fruit teas, lemonades, shakes, smoothies, Vietnamese coffee, sea salt cream & a lot more to choose from! There's also options to choose your sweetness level, toppings and type of tea. I ordered a Thai Tea with boba and 25% sweetness. Not bad! And the amount of boba they added was a good amount. I was happy with it. 

I had to wait a few more minutes for the steamed veggies, but I didn't mind because the girl helping me updated me every few minutes. I was quite pleased with their customer service. At most Pandas I've been to, service has always been okay. But here they kicked it up a notch while they were busy. I was quite impressed with that. 

When I finally tasted my veggies and Beijing beef, it was delicious. I was happy with it.

This is no where near where I live, but with all the amazing service I've got at restaurants and shops I've been to in Downtown Summerlin, I'm considering moving to this area. I'll definitely be back to this Panda Express.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,1,0,4,3HwzJjzEmqRUxDXPMWMP3w

5518138,2016-08-27,5,uTn8bL6sabHD2916u5mvkA,"When one eats at Panda, one does not expect the food to taste like anything more like Panda. It is fast food at its core, and should never be graded like anything more than what it is (like a local business per se). That being said, I like to grade fast food based on the quality of their service, and this specific Panda Express location definitely stepped up to the plate. 

Upon entering, one presents himself with an entirely different atmosphere compared to other Panda locations. The building itself is clean. Very clean. Every time someone left, even if the place was empty, they would hurriedly make it their duty to wipe that empty table clean in the case that the next customer wanted to perhaps sit there. 

The interior design. Sleek and modern, with neutral colors everywhere of black, brown and white, and the single eye-popping red to ascertain one's eyes to the menu. I personally like the choice in chandeliers, all spherical and round to avoid making everything look too blocky. 

But enough about the interior decor; let's talk about the service. 

When we entered the shop, we were greeted by a nice, confident young woman who patiently let us sample almost every single dish on the menu before choosing our choice of 3 sides. This was due to the fact that it has been so long since my companions and I visited a Panda that we generally forgot what's good and not good. With that being the case, the women did not even look the least bit annoyed! If she was, she didn't show it. Haha. Very patient and understanding!

As we ordered our food, it was served plentiful. I don't remember how Panda food was before, but I do remember the sizes of their portions and how they were so stingy, especially when it comes to shrimp! However, they the lady served so much food on our platter that it looked to be overflowing. She even brought the food out to us as we waited in our seat. 

One cool addition that they have here is the Panda Tea Bar. I don't know if this is at every location, or maybe if I'm just too outdated, but I never knew Panda Express made boba! Of course, you shouldn't order it expecting the boba pearls to be completely fresh, and the milk tea to taste like anything original, but it is what it is. It's a nice alternative to those who don't want normal fountain drinks and others who don't always want to get water cups.

At night the food and service is mediocre at best but the daytime crew with the tall handsome guy is bangin ' !! 

The food is so much better in the day time. I love their little Boba bar as well. 

Now the manager reached out to me however I never reached back out to this restaurant. I went in again on my own accord since this is my neighborhood and my bank is right there as well.  

My kid loves Panda and so does my chef brother.  

I haven't been back at night but the day time crew has it going on! 


------1st Review--------
I am so sick of going into this location with these late night employees distributing inedible dry disgusting food and keeping it there because at 10:15 we are closing soon ? 

For 1. Noodles were all cabbage and NO NOODLE 
2. The meats especially ones fried looked so dried out beyond recognition. 3. He rice too looked dried out and tasteless 

They are cleaning the dining area with part of it closed off because we g t it , it's Friday and you want to go home but do you know how I inviting it is to see someone closing off party of their dining section because they want to leave asap ? 

It's off putting stop making crappy old food for us to eat in summerlin of all places.
