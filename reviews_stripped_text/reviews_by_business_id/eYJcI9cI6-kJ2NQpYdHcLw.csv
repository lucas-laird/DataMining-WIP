The food and the service was was great!! The monkey bread was to die for!!!  

I had breakfast steak tacos they delish and season well the only thing I would add would have been a Verde salsa

Der Laden ist etwas klein und akustisch eine Katastrophe. Es ist sehr laut (wir waren vormittags dort), obwohl gar nicht viel Platz für viele Leute ist. Das ist aber auch schon der einzige Kritikpunkt.
Wir hatten 2 x den Perch Burger + Bier und wir waren sehr zufrieden. Der Burger war sehr gut, die Pommes hingegen waren nicht wirklich toll, eher weich und kein Genuss. Uns ging es eh nur um den Burger und der war top und genug zum satt werden. Die Bedienung war sehr freundlich und hat sich regelmäßig versichert, dass wir alles haben, was wir brauchen.

Das Essen war den (Groupon-)Preis auf jeden Fall wert und das Bier war ja auch schon inklusive. So blieb für uns vor Ort dann nur noch das Trinkgeld. Der Groupon-Gutschein wurde ohne Diskussion angenommen und verrechnet.
Mit Groupon-Gutschein würden wir wiederkommen. Ohne eher nicht, weil es uns zu laut war.",nhASzYdqRwYiUgASyMVKUw,0,0,4,rIpo7OvBKu5brD-2aZBjcg

Their location overlooking the Container Park is prime real estate with the outdoor patio perfect for people watching. I hear they have happy hour as well.

My brother took the first drink of the Bloody Mary, and scrunched his face up immediately. I started to drink mine and it too was awful. By that point our mom had called and we needed to leave to meet her so we didn't bother complaining, or trying to get the drinks switched. Instead we told them that we needed to leave and would just like to pay for the single priced bloody Mary's. Alone they are $10 each, which is complete insanity.

The approach is very inviting with a terrace that's starts as a sky walk, leads to the entrance, then continues around the entire bistro.

The atmosphere was very pretty. The space is tight, but the way they positioned the tables made it feel open and airy. The deco was inviting and comfortable while still being stylish. 

The staff was WONDERFUL and genuinely sweet! Loved them all!  The great service was the reason we didn't complain about the few gripes we had about our food. Excellent service!

The food:
I had the Angel hair pasta and it was delicious! The only grip I have was that the pasta was slightly dry (possibly from sitting out in open air for too long?). I expected it to be moist or have a little more oil to keep the pasta from sticking together. The flavor was very good, especially with the almonds and currants. It gave it a smokey and sweet flavor that I LOVED! I will be having this dish again! As long as the pasta is not dry ;)

My friend's dish: She ordered the grilled salmon and OMFG!!! IT WAS AMAZING! I was so jealous! The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned! So freaking good!! It was a perfect pairing with the asparagus and brussels spouts on the bottom (and I'm not even a fan of brussels sprouts). It was heavenly!! But of course there was one problem (other than the small portion size): The avocado sauce on top of the salmon was OVERSALTED! I'm talking the make your glands explode type of salty. It was disappointing, but thankfully the dish was still so AMAZING that it wasn't a big deal. She still wolfed it down. She basically CLEANED the bowl!

The portion size was great for the price (except the salmon dish) and we walked away with full bellies. I would definitely come back very soon and recommend to anyone! 

**I can't review the drinks because we already had drinks from their sister bar, Oak&Ivy (MY FAVORITE BAR IN CPDT!!). It was already late anyway and we didn't want to drink again.

3. Smothered biscuits with Turkey Sausage
When we arrived we were told the fryer had broken and that option 1 was no longer available, and option 3 actually contained pork sausage. There were no other options for people who did not eat beef or pork. 

The management was unwilling to compromise and offer reasonable alternatives. Additionally, he was condescending and tried to blame the our event organizer for choosing a pre-fixed menu. It is not our event organizers fault that the fryer broke, and it was not their fault that management was inflexible.

I had never hear of the place, but it was the only place that we could find that could get our large group in that day; so, we decided to give it a try. Located at Downtown Container Park - what a fun location!
I would rate this place semi family-friendly - in that they have high chairs available, a few (limited) menu options for kids. Beyond that, the servers tolerated the children in the restaurant but did not seem overly thrilled to have them as guests. There were not any offerings for the kids - activity pages, etc. Which is totally fine, because we always bring our own just in case.
The Easter Brunch menu (and not sure if this differs from their weekly brunch menu) is limited. I wasn't particularly hungry so I went with the seasonal fruit plate (can't go wrong there) & bottomless mimosas for $15. Those in our party that did eat were happy with their meals and everyone had leftovers, so the proportions were enough. 
We would go back but not without trying other brunches offered throughout the city first.",BNIPGK5A8TrBhX_G-ZqHzA,0,0,3,KLfFStevl8fzMUUe5wGk1Q

This is my new favorite place for al fresco dining in Vegas.

The Perch perfectly bridges the gap between high-end ""fine dining"" and ""a casual evening out"". The food is what you'd hope to find at any great restaurant, but the vibe is European café casual.

Outstanding service. 
Our server, Dante was awesome. Friendly and having a comprehensive knowledge of the menu; he was able to offer excellent recommendations. Food was served promptly, but service was not rushed.

Outstanding Food. 
Our Calamari appetizer was great - with an unusual but delightful dipping sauce.
My date had the Salmon - served over brussel sprouts (which he instantly declared to be the best he'd ever had).  

I had the Turkey French Dip - just 'cause it sounded interesting. It was better than I had hoped - with a delicious dressing that involved caramelized onions and a little horseradish. It was served with truly killer French fries.  Yeah, I could eat my weight in those.

Outstanding overall experience.
A perfect evening at a charming restaurant with a fantastic staff. 

One consideration: Be aware of whether or not there is a band on the nearby stage when choosing to sit inside or out. The night we were there, the duo ""Orange Feathers"" was playing. Talented guys, and they kept it to a reasonable level. However, it would be easy for things to get overly loud if you are sitting near the speakers.

Fair Disclosure: I had an earlier experience here that ended in us bailing out due to issues with staffing. On this, my second visit, they more than made up for that earlier snafu. 

At any business, things can happen that are truly beyond control. Sudden rushes; staffers bailing, supplies not coming in - it happens. What is important is *how* the establishment handles these unexpected moments. 

General Manager, Kristine has my total respect and admiration for her diplomatic and friendly response to my initial concerns. Well done, and Thank You!

They offer tables inside and outside, high top tables, and a small bar. 

It's a bit pricy but nothing too much to make your bank account cry. 

Also, if you have to use the bathroom you have to make your way downstairs to the public restrooms. 

My Friend and I decided to stop by here for a quick bite before we began bar hopping. 
Luckily, Yelp offers a check in offer for a free 6 oz.  draft beer. It was exactly what I needed!

So, I got my free draft beer. The 6 oz. glasses are really small but hey it's free. 

Before I start on the food, let me just tell you about my awesome server, Rodney. Rodney was perfect. I really enjoyed his attitude and the way he carried himself as a server. He was always there to check on us, he got our drinks quickly, and made sure we had everything we needed. 

As my entree, I ordered the Margarita Pizza Flatbread. It was a smaller portion but was the perfect size for me.

Once entering, up the stairs to the right, the bartenders were super nice and immediately wiped the outdoor, shadier table off for us.  I'm not a sun person, but very much enjoy the outdoors.  

The server took awhile like the last time we were here.  She asked if we were eating and was rude.  However, Stephen, the bartender was very nice and took over after that.  He did not know the name of the new bubbly Rose, or that they were out of the Blue Moon, instead brought dad a citrus draft beer, which he did not like.  He ordered a Heineken instead.  

Dad had to use the restroom, which is 'downstairs next to the toy store' but is actually downstairs around the corner with a security guard.  I guess we are downtown and rather be safe than sorry.  

A couple of things that really stuck out in Jeff C. and my mind about our first time here... slow service, upset customers, nothing spectacular on the menu and a fishy smell.  

At the time, I didn't want to Yelp about it because I expected more and would be back soon.  The patio seating, view, relaxing and entertaining outdoor area ... besides the meter maid giving out over four tickets that we couldn't believe watching!  There is also a colorful yellow hallway with local Vegas artwork, overlooking a playground, stage area and people that were on a scavenger hunt.  Fun and great location!  

Unfortunately, it was the same experience and scenario overall.  Stephan was great!  Service before him was slow, nothing on the 'Sharable' menu looked great via Yelp reviews, but when that same fish came out at the table next to us, we lost our appetite... once again.

I've been a server before, cool if you're doing a shift change but don't do it where customers are waiting to be greeted! We can see you & it looks really bad when we're thirsty and hungry, okay? 

When we finally did get someone to take our drink and food orders... they weren't extremely knowledgeable about their drink selections. We worked through it and found a beer to try. That was about the only good thing about this lunch, the beer. 

We ordered a few small bites: a large chopped salad and shrimp scampi. For the price point we thought it was going to be an actual Shrimp Scampi dish with pasta. Forgive me if I sound a bit country here but where the heck was the food?! We got a few pieces of shrimp in some sauce. The sauce was decent, but that's about it. I could not get over calling the dish shrimp scampi and not having pasta. The chopped salad was just doing too much... too many weird flavors with all the ingredients. 

Perhaps the service was a fluke and it bled into the rest of our experience. Maybe one afternoon we'll give this place another shot. Hopefully it'll be better.",CdJMYUdSAYu6ZjpgOenvnw,3,0,2,Q-JpAuQbyMiOFRpj5HLmXQ

I am def a yelper, so I had figured out what I wanted about two weeks before arriving. We were sat down wherever we wanted, and a server came over for our drink order. We were catching a movie downtown, so we opted for water since we were driving. I was excited to see the menu, but to my surprise a few items are not on the menu any longer. :( 

I am never craving a burger but the Oz burger sounded really good, especially the pineapple aspect. It was sweet and savory at the same time.

But I will say the Oz burger is delicious! I was a fan of the fries as well, and the bun looked awesome nicely . My only compliant is there was a few items on the burger that were not listed on the description of the burger. (Asked the server if it had cheese and she said yes, I said no cheese. Burger came out with no cheese but with tomato) I feel like if you're going to list what's in it to make sure you list it all. 

But besides that the food was good the service was good everyone was nice and we will be back for brunch!",LHeX1ZRjJNq5bht6H5kjfA,0,0,4,T5a9e8Q5RFHloOQfDjZRLQ

1534417,2015-10-18,0,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"Went here on Friday, a little before noon. Was unplanned though. We initially wanted to go to Eat. because of the Yelp reviews, but they were busy. Saw this place pop up on the search for brunch, but... They only serve brunch on Sundays from what I overheard. LOL. Too late. Once we were seated and looked quizzically at the menu, our server had already introduced himself. Not going to lie, my sister was intrigued by the menu by then too. 
It was also cool to have the host recommend Eat. to other patrons that were looking for brunch. Shows how supportive the area was of other establishments, and honest to a certain extent. 
Let's see... 
I ordered a Bloody Mary, and for appetizers we ordered the Tuna Tartare and Margherita Flatbread. Our server, Rodney, seriously persuaded me to order the Bloody Mary. Hahaha... Not that it takes much to convince me when it comes to drinks. I was sold on the idea of mixing it myself 'cause sometimes bartenders tend to make it too spicy for me. Anyway, we both liked his style which wasn't too pushy to make us order more, and helped us relax in trying a new place. He was pretty much like ""If you guys are still hungry after your appetizers, and just want to hang out here a little longer, then just order more later. No pressure."" 
Oh my gah... The Tuna Tartare... I was lucky to even get a third of that plate! The taro chips were yummy by itself, and the tartare had fresh ingredients that paired nicely with the raw tuna. My sister seriously didn't want to share! The Margherita Flatbread was just as yummy - I always like it when the tomatoes are baked along with the rest of the ingredients, and having the basil be the fresh part of the dish.
Coming back to check on us, and joking about how fast I needed a second Bloody, we ordered entrees... Goujons (sweet Thai chili) with fries added (technically an appetizer) for the sister, and I got the Chimichurri Chicken Sandwich. 
Rodney gave us a story about the sandwich being too spicy for a past patron as a warning. LOL. Dude... That was not spicy at all. I kept biting into my first half of the sandwich looking for spice! It was still pretty good though. I love the fresh avocado with it. I had more avocado mouse/sauce on the side, but I honestly liked the Aioli sauce my sister got. Liked dipping my fries into that. My sister also enjoyed her chicken with the Thai chili sauce. Sad to say we couldn't finish it all, but we were just being polite and saving leftovers for our dad. LOL. He wasn't too happy that we went on a sibling date without him. 
Anyway, food alone, this place gets 4 stars for flavor and variety of dishes. Giving it 5 for the outstanding customer service provided by Rodney. 
Noticed that he was the only server on the floor. The impressive thing was that even though he seemed to have to take care of the entire restaurant, the indoors and the patio, he still managed to check up on us several times. If anyone can make my sister smile and relax as a first time patron, I can seriously appreciate that. Seriously... Thanks to him, my sister's mood got a little better, considering she didn't even want to go to Downtown for a meal. 
I hope the tip was adequate enough to show my gratitude. If not, I'll be sure to make up for it on our next visit. LOL. So long as the experience is equivalent or exceeds our expectations once again.",WdD8hWn-NjSyDYoHqin_tQ,1,0,5,TVZTiNRCvdvfl8Z4r1EXpw

Service is very slow. Do not come if you have hungry kids or are looking for a quick bite.  We ordered a side of French fries and it came with an aioli that tasted strongly of raw garlic.  Steak sandwich was nowhere close to medium rare as ordered- more like medium well to well done. Aioli that came with the sandwich had a strange skin on the top and may have sat around awhile before being served? Fries are thick cut rather than crispy.  Power greens salad had a super salty dressing.   I liked it but it may not be to everyone's taste.  My daughter said the same thing about her chicken pailliard dish.   Overall portions are on the small side but were perfect for our group.  I think there might be a kids menu? New Year's flyer mentioned it,  but we weren't offered it even though we had kids in our group.  Best to ask for it.

Something in the coating they use is just wrong it make it so rock solid it's break teeth. Flavour isn't all that either.

The service was great, quick and friendly. The spot itself is small (as is everything in the container park, nbd), but has nice patio and bar seating. They have a good selection of craft beers, including a few on draft. The bartender was quick to recommend beer choices for both of us based on our taste, and he did a great job; we both loved our choices. 

We started off with an order of the fries; they were hand cut and came with garlic aioli- crispy and super yummy! I ordered The Terrace salad- corn, onions, shrimp, avocado- AMAZING.

I was very excited to try it out since the whole area is new to me (last time I visited Vegas was about 6 years ago). I do not understand how this place has such great reviews, yet our visit turned out so bad. My husband and I arrived with kids in tow, ordered our drinks and food. The drinks (5 waters and 1 soda) took a while to get there, about 25 minutes. That should have been an indication of the wait time, but we waited patiently. There were about 2 other couples there. By the time we got our food it was over an hour later. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles, my husband ordered the Perch Burger. I didn't think that was something that would take so long to make. After waiting for 40 minutes we were finally apologized to and told that it was my syrup that took so long. My syrup??? Did they go drain some trees for maple syrup?? I was so confused but so hungry I didn't even bother to question it. When our food arrived I didn't complain because I was starving. It was disgusting. The chicken was over fried, I got a collar bone and other over fried pieces I couldn't even eat, the waffle was just ok, but I ate it because like I said I was so hungry. My husband offered me some of his burger (which he did not enjoy either--left half of it) because he felt bad, I declined but accepted some of his fries. The fries tasted as though they were fried in old beef fat or something gross. I had to stop eating and drink water. By the time we got back to the car I was feeling sick, sadly I threw up all of the Perch food in my new car....No thanks to you the Perch & employees.",Xz4dcK6Q0tvSDO7BYNcTUA,1,0,1,qlvgONBzq9TLgsDiMN6qWw

The reason for the lower stars is due to incredibly bad service we received. I came here on a Saturday morning (originally on going somewhere close by but there was a wait) we got seated immediately which was nice for a larger party. 

When we sat down we ordered drinks they do have all you can drink for 15 dollars (bloody marys, mimosa or belinis) and you can change them around. The bloody marys tasted like tomato juice, no flavor or spice. 

We ordered our food within 10 minutes of seating and then about 30 minutes later the server came and told me that the potatoes that I had requested without bell pepper were pre cooked with bell pepper and they can sub it with fries. I had said that was fine. After waiting an additional 30 minutes. (total of 1 hr after ordering) the server came and said it will be a few minutes before our food is ready. I asked if there was something they can provide us due to the long wait. The server stated they can bring us a fruit platter as we have been waiting for such a long time. 

We waited another 20 minutes and asked for a manger because at this time we were really upset for the length of time it was taking to get our food. We finally got the manager and he stated was coming out now.... we still had to wait another 20 minutes ( making it 1hr and 40 minutes by the time we ordered and 1 hr and 50 minutes from when we sat down). we notes the time as we had marked in metered parking.

When we addressed the situation with the manager he stated he would provide a 10% discount to the bill. He was arguing with us about the amount of time it took to bring the food out. 

The location, the view and food was amazing but the service and management was lacking. On top of everything they charged for the fruit plate they brought us, I had to bring it to their attention to have them take it off.

We walked into the perch from the street entrance and were greeted by our server who told us we could sit anywhere outside. We grabbed a table and another server running over and seemed very flustered. We didn't have any menus and she immediately started asking us about drinks. We were still settling into our seats so we both just said waters to start. She's like okay so nothing else? I then asked for a menu.
Then the first server who greeted us came out with table settings and one glass of water... For two people?

We ordered a bunch of stuff to share and had to repeat several times what we wanted bc the server didn't seem to be familiar with the menu. 

Then a manager came over and asked if we had a reservation, and yes I had made a reservation on opentable.

I got a Moscow mule and it wasn't every good... I ordered a glass of wine instead . Then the food came. Crab cakes were great. 
Everything else needed a tweak. We got the carpaccio which was drenched in truffle oil. There was no balance of flavors. It was awful. And it came with a ""potato purée"" which we didn't understand. But either way it sucked, it needed butter.

We got the ""Salmon Tiradito, Spicy Cucumber & Mango Salsa"" which looked amazing according to these pictures on yelp... Well yeah not so much. It looked like a bright and colorful dish, but it was missing something. We took the cilantro lime sauce from the crab cakes and added it to the dish very lightly, and it made such a difference. 

We also ordered the ""Mozzarella & Heirloom Tomatoes Red Onion, Micro Basil"". The first bite was great but that's about it. I really like red onions when they are balanced. There were so many red onions, that it was all I could taste. It was not pleasant. 


And we pretty much a quarter to half the dishes before they started to take stuff ""out of our way."" I let the server know no was still working on the salmon. We ask for the check. I still have a glass of wine and salmon I'm eating when the server comes back with our bill, as I reach to my purse she puts my small plate on to the salmon dish...WTF?! And takes it away.
I was so irritated. Then I'm finishing my wine, and the server decides to take our ice teas and water away.... Are you serious? 
We are still sitting there, the place is not busy.... And I'm clearly drinking my wine.

At the bottom of the spicy bowl, which is spicy but not over powering enough to need a milky drink, you find tomato slices to create a base and compliment the cherry tomatoes used primarily in the salad. Also had the new shrimp appetizer which was equally mouthwatering with a creamy dip.

Tuna tartare: one of the best I've had , melt in your mouth with mango and avocado, highly recommended.

Lettuce cups: steak!! So fresh!! Best I've ever had
Chicken sandwich: I barely ever order chicken when I go out but this sounded so good so I went for it. Sooo tasty! Very unique!!

The drinks trend on the light and fruity side, and the foods are fresh with several healthy options available. Good spot for brunch or a girls night out. 

BEEF CARPACCIO ($14): thin sliced raw beef with parm-reg, balsamic glaze, and arugula. The regular portion is fairly large, fitting for the price. Really enjoyed this app.
SPICY SHRIMP PASTA ($16): Shrimp, tomato, arugula, and pasta in a Sriracha cream sauce that wasn't nearly spicy enough, IMO. I rarely eat pasta, but this was a fun mix of lighter ingredients that kept the dish from being too heavy. The sliced grilled bread added some much needed crunch.
CHIMICHURRI CHICKEN SANDWICH ($13): Large portion of thin-pounded chicken cutlets on a soft baguette style roll. Cheese received on sandwich did not appear to be queso fresco as stated on menu, and I didn't taste or see the avocado mousse. Chimichurri sauce was thick and chunky but seemed to be missing something in the flavor. Not sure why there were a ton of red pepper flakes on this.
HAND CUT FRIES ($6): These were soggy and limp mere minutes after ordering, but they were skin-on with sea salt, so they were more flavorful than expected. The garlic aioli was delicious, couldn't stop dipping! Can't imagine how much better these would be if the fries were actually crispy.

I'm not a huge fan of the Container Park, but I really like this restaurant's upstairs location and glass windows, which make it light and airy. The bird motif throughout is a cute decorative touch, and the bright colors and warm staff are welcoming. 

TIP: they have a downstairs gate entrance to get straight inside rather than wandering through the whole CP area! Brunch has bottomless drink options and there's also a weekday HH offered 4-6PM.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,17,3,IKoMLU_-yPoKuKBuVT_sbQ

I assumed it would be like the picture. No. It was shrimp and various pieces of calamari sitting on top of mushy penne pasta that fell apart when I stabbed it with my fork.

Those of you that have eaten good shrimp and calamari know it has that fresh clean taste... this was gross. The entire thing tasted and smelled like salty, somewhat tomato-ish, fish.

I had passed Perch in the past and never thought twice about going there so I was quite pleased with the decision. Upon entering the restaurant we were immediately greeted and the hostess seated us. After I sat down I looked around to take in the atmosphere and noticed everyone was dressed rather nicely and was quite attractive. I felt out of place wearing shorts/tank top/flip flops. 

Our waiter comes over (Miguel) and takes our drink order and makes menu recommendations. We ordered bottomless mimosas, monkey bread to start, the shrimp and grits, and the perch breakfast sandwich. 

The monkey bread was sticky and gooey, everything you could have wanted in a good dessert (we frequently start with dessert). My breakfast sandwich comes out with it looking pretty good, the side of potatoes came out looking like they were straight from a microwave. My friends shrimp and grits had a nice heat going through it but ultimately were tasteless. I do not hold the restaurant accountable because I know from being quite the foodie that grits is a hard dish to make amazing. 

Ultimately it was a nice brunch that came out to 80$ after gratuity. I was torn between a 3 and 4 star rating but decided on a 3 with the food outweighing the atmosphere. I would eat here again with the realization that I'm paying way too much for what I'm actually consuming.

Our party of 2 enjoyed the Tuna Tartare with Taro Chips, the Chicken & Quinoa, and the Salmon with Brussel Sprouts and Asparagus.  Each of the dishes was very enjoyable and just about perfectly prepared.  My only feedback would be that it would be nice to have slightly more seasoning on the Tuna Tartare (perhaps garnish with Maldon Salt) and I would use slightly less butter with the quinoa.  Our bill for three fantastic dishes was only $49 plus tip.

Our server was super friendly, agreed right off the bat with our choices, and even helped us relocate outside in mid-meal when some patio tables opened up because the weather was perfect outside on a Saturday evening around 9pm and inside was a little too chilly for our liking.  Avalon Landing was playing right outside on the Container Park main stage, and everything about our experience was top notch.

One got his drink and the other was waiting way too long for his. Keep in mind that this is a small place and not too busy at 10:00 PM when we went.  So he walked out because it took too long.  We were leaving Container Park and almost at the exit, then we hear someone yelling from a distance.

They do have a bottomless option for around $15 (your choice of bloody/mimosa/bellini), but we didn't want to get too buzzed so we just got single drinks. As soon as her drink came out, I was instantly jealous! The Bloody Mary is deconstructed and it comes with an almost full glass of premium vodka, a cup of tomato juice, and then sides of horseradish/tabasco, lemons and olives. You can make it how you like it. Sooo cool! My bellini was good, but I am totally getting the bloody next time. 

So the food. I originally wanted breakfast, but the Perch Burger sounded really good so I went with that. The burger had provolone cheese, bacon, a fried green tomato, and chipotle mayo. It also came with fries and a side of chipotle mayo. The burger was pretty damn good and I am happy I chose that. The fries were perfectly cooked, but could have used some salt. I enjoyed dipping them in the chipotle mayo though. For 2 drinks and 2 meals, the total was $50 not including tip. I did enjoy my meal, but I think $50 is a little too much for brunch.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,4,6,3,rly8OhtdgMN69bLIb9c7Cw

I ordered the Sriracha pasta and my companion had a burger.  The pasta was super tasty (although lacking in the spice the title promised).  The burger was well cooked and very much enjoyed.

Service was decent and the staff was friendly. 30 minutes later our breakfast items still haven't come out. 

About ready to leave our food comes out. Awesome!! However, my husbands ""hash"" was firstly not a ""hash"" at all. It was basically 20 cents of food that they charge you 9 dollars for. A potato chopped and fried with a poached egg on top. My egg whites was basically a frittata and the ""bacon"" was more like ham. Avocados weren't ripe. 

Overall we ate all our food because we were hungry,

It took quite a while to just get our drinks ordered and they brought my drink out ten minutes after my friend got theirs. 

I ordered the fried chicken sandwich which sounded delicious on the menu. When it showed up, the chicken was one of those frozen particle chicken patties you find in the frozen food section and the bun was just a cheap burger bun. Definitely NOT worth the $15 price tag. I would've been more satisfied with a fried chicken sandwich from Wendy's because at least they give you a real chicken breast for a third of the price. It was like eating a big chicken nugget.

Upon walking in. the two of us were given the choice of sitting at a two-seat table by the door. It was chilly out, so I didn't feel like sitting right by the door. I asked if we could sit at a four-seat table further in away from the door of the restaurant. This, for some reason, prompted a vigorous discussion between the gentleman seating us and another fellow behind the bar. We ended being offered and accepting a high table (for two). 

This odd behavior irked me. The table for four I had asked about sitting at ended up being empty for the entirety of our meal. If a table a customer asks to sit at isn't actually reserved for an incoming party, good customer service is to GIVE THEM THAT TABLE. 

If not for the misguided attempt to keep a table open for other possible customers, our experience at The Perch would have been very good. Our server was very friendly and the Grilled Salmon and Chicken Quinoa we ordered were quite well-prepared.

The price bracket their food is at requires their service to be on point. But it's not all there.

2318045,2015-01-23,12,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"What a waste of a meal. Life is too short for this bullshit.

This is one of the *worst* places we've been to in a long time. Obscenely small portions for the price. Everything on the menu is at least twice as expensive as it should be. Expect to stare at a plate of food that seems less than generous - on purpose. You will be irked.

The Steak Frites ($18) is served with a New York Strip - what a terrible, flavorless choice. The fact that they chose to *not* go with the Hanger Steak (which happens to appear in one of their sandwiches) is indicative of how stingy the people running this place are. I don't know anybody that would choose a New York Strip as their 'favorite' cut of beef. Pass.

The Power Greens ($11) salad is a cruel joke. Comes out looking like way less than a half-portion. Like meant-for-hamster-consumption-small. Appears to be less than $1 in ingredients with an 1100% markup. Should be $5.50 at the most.

The Flatbreads ($9-$13) are shamefully small. 4 *tiny* pieces of flatbread = the equivalent of one single slice of Brooklyn pizza. Should be $4.50-6.50 at the most.

Only suckers should eat here. I left The Perch feeling cheated and mad. The 6 of us also waited over 35 minutes for our food to come out. That's a long wait for a business lunch. The server apologized but offered no compensation. What a waste of time. Nobody likes wasting restaurant dollars. What a terrible value.

Currently the most overrated restaurant Yelp listing in Vegas. You've been warned! The actual environment is clean and fresh. Some table seating involves back-less stools which is a bit informal and potentially uncomfortable, but for the most part the interior design was pleasing. But alas, it's like a Four Seasons lobby with a truck-stop Knights Inn lurking in the back. (the Lurch?)

Coming to The Container Park for the first time tonight I wanted to try one of the local eateries and expand my pallet. So after walking the length of the park I settled on The Downtown Terrace. Located on level 2 in the back right by the stage. 

With indoor and outdoor seating available to enjoy the live music I was already starting to fall in love with the venue. Inside the resteraunt is small, being 2 containers fused together, very cozy but intimate which was perfect for my date night.

Amazing service right from the start. Waters as soon as you're seated without asking for them, quick service by very knowledgeable staff and amazing cuisine that will make you come back again and again! 

We ordered the chicken & waffles and country fried steak. The chicken and waffles were freshly made, sweet yet savory, and cooked to perfection.

It's nestled at the end of Fremont street (aka the ""old Vegas"" apparently), but so worth it to go to! Forget the craziness of the strip, this place is my new favorite! 

My best friend and I were meeting a friend for brunch, and after searching for places, we all agreed to come to The Perch, since other Yelpers posted that they had bottomless mimosas (yay!) ***By the way, it's not just bottomless mimosas... They have bottomless Bellini's and Bloody Mary's too. And you can mix and match them... As in, if you order a mimosa and then want a Bellini instead, that's fine*** 

We arrived around 11am on a Sunday, and it wasn't too crazy busy... yet. Our server, Jessica, was super on point and extremely sweet! She was so helpful, sincere and genuine, it made our experience so much better. We each saw a few things on the menu that caught our attention (other than the bottomless drinks), and we asked Jessica which item she'd recommend and she pointed us in the right direction -- and neither of us were disappointed. 

My best friend and I both ordered the Brioche French Toast -- pure deliciousness! And our friend got the Egg White Omelet. And we had drinks for daaaaayyyssss at our table. Jessica came to check on us and I jokingly asked her to bring over a whole bottle of champagne for us -- and she did -- plus the mixers!!! Such amazing service! Needless to say, we were happy campers (or brunchers, whatever). 

As we were paying, we noticed we still had some champagne left and again, the jokester that I am, asked Jessica if we could have the rest of the champagne to-go... and to my surprise/shock, she said yes! The only thing is that you can't leave the little complex The Perch is in but you can still walk around and enjoy the scenery, and if you have little ones, there's a play area for them. 

Overall this was an amazing experience (thanks, Jessica!!!), and the food was phenomenal!!! Next time I'm back in Vegas, this place is a definite MUST! Oh, and be sure to pay enough for the darn parking if you drive/park your car there, otherwise you end up with a $20 parking ticket. SMH",HHrDK8PKL3div1uBYym6LQ,15,14,5,G68A65rqJvxVen49eL6zIA

Great place in Container Park downtown. We sat at the bar because the only table available had too much traffic walking by it. The bar had comfortable seating. Our bartender & server Brandon greeted us and took our drink order while we looked over the menu.. He made a handcrafted margarita which was fantastic. I can't wait to go back to have another one.. 
We asked for suggestions and took him up on a few. We split the tuna tartar. Delicious! The menu said it was served with taro chips, however we got tortilla chips which were fine. Fortunately they were not salty, so they did not overpower the tuna. For entrees we got the Beef Carpaccio and Spicy Shrimp Pasta. The Carpaccio was served traditional with shaved parmesan and topped with Arugula and balsamic vinegar, perfect! The pasta dish was served with nice sized shrimp, pasta and a spicy cream sauce that was plate licking good. The dish has heat, but it was the kind that made you keep going back for more and more. 
Only downside is that it would have been nice to eat on their patio, however there was a live band playing inside the park and the music was so loud, you would have not been able to hear yourself talk. Fortunately inside the music was not an issue at all. Looking forward to going back and hopefully have Brandon as our server. Awesome service!",Zb2T6JhcBGzgc6RWmldbDg,1,0,4,bmAQQYc0s7lg3Iyu7mcfYA

One had some sort of horseradish/mustard sauce on it and I was a little concerned, and it ended up being my favorite of the trio. I ordered the short rib hash for my meal and it was more than enough food. The only improvement I would have added would have been a little heat.

2952861,2014-10-04,2,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"The Perch; give it some time and they will get things right, I feel, because they really seem to care about their business. 

Let's get to the grub, in order of appearance:

Crab cakes...nearly all filler, and not all that flavorful to make up for the lack of crab. I would suggest passing on this unless they change the recipe to include more crab (not krab, please!).

Salmon entree was pretty good and cooked to the temperature requested; a good portion for the price paid, but what really made this dish stand out are the Brussel sprouts...ask for those with any other entree; they're that good.

Chicken entree was thin and not all that flavorful but a decent portion. This entree came with a salad that had a fantastic vinaigrette (I believe) but the leaves were too roughage-like for me and somewhat bitter. 

Creme brulee was done nicely and what you'd expect; it's hard to screw up custard with caramelized sugar. 

The highlight of the meal was the tiramisu. This was fantastic and not over-done in the rum department as most places do. I will go back for this alone, with maybe a cordial to wash it down since they have a full bar as well. 

Ambiance: If it's busy, as it was on my visit, it's far too loud in this small space due to a lack of acoustical panels or other noise dampening decor.  Yes, I understand I'm sitting in a 'storage container', but several things can be done to make the space not so harsh. That annoys me while dining out more than bad service. Please look into taming down the space considerably. 

Service: Excellent from both the server and the manager who checked on the table twice. From the minute I walked in I felt like all staff truly cared about the patrons. They were happy to be there; that makes me happy to be there too. 

Overall it's worth a stop by if you're in the area since the dining options (that I would recommend at least) are somewhat limited on East Fremont. Make suggestions if you do go; I feel this establishment may actually listen.",UQB87Neb-M6xbxT6hi9rcw,6,6,3,-28yN-JNez68_36injWqFg

2970861,2016-07-27,6,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"The ""go to"" spot to escape the summer heat while in Container Park. 

I've come here a handful of times and it's slowly becoming my main haunt when in this neck of the woods. The food is fresh, the cocktails are delicious and the view isn't to shabby either. Because this is basically an insulated box, the A/C stays in and keeps this place feeling cool and comfortable.

My last visit had me sitting at the bar and enjoying a beer during a business meeting, we started with the fried calamari to share and the I chose, ""The Egg"" for lunch. The fried calamari is a great starter, your basic calamari with a light breading, but the sauce is what makes it pop, order extra because this stuff goes fast. 

""The Egg"" is a hearty salad that will fill any empty feeling you might get from reading the word ""salad"" on the menu. A poached egg, butter lettuce, frisee lettuce, bacon, croutons, Sherry Vinaigrette. This is a great lunch option that won't leave you feeling heavy and tired, the butter lettuce is different and something that you don't see on most salads. Plus who doesn't like a poached egg and bacon on a salad! 

PRO TIP: Happy Hour is the best way to break your Perch cherry. Two-dollars off cocktails and five-dollar beer and wine offered.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,22,17,4,95-SNxG5VKi4ZJNFrMU9Ew

There were only a couple other people in the place, so it felt pretty empty even though the place itself was relatively small. It had a nice vibrant atmosphere with the natural lights and clean minimal style. The service was just okay, but I wouldn't look too much into it. Outlets were also available, so we even saw a guy with his laptop out at the bar. 

The food was a bit overpriced in my opinion, but delicious. I got the salmon on top of a bed of asparagus and brussel sprouts which I loved. They asked me how I wanted my salmon cooked which I've never heard of before. The veggies were cooked perfectly. We also got the bianca flatbread to start. It was a perfect appetizer for two or even a small meal for someone who isn't that hungry. My boyfriend got the chopped salad with added grilled shrimp on top. There were only a couple pieces of shrimp that shouldn't really warrant a $6 up charge. The salad itself was very good. The dill dressing was the best he's ever had and the apples and mangos were perfect additions. If he didn't order the overpriced shrimp, he said he would consider it the best quality salad, considering the price was only $10.

Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone with a couple of dollars to spend while downtown at the Container Park. It fills you up nicely without leaving you too full to where you can't explore the adventures downtown.",366Wx4O367RzrV1Wc1aT2A,1,1,4,RqwZxSGtAj1A1T-wRG2PRQ

It's on the second level of the park in the southwest corner of the park. It's accessible either by stairs or elevator. I visited the Perch for the first time during the evening on the weekend with a party of three.

Atmosphere: Hip, bright, and new!
Being merely seated in the Perch, either outside or inside, is a great experience, in my personal opinion. The combination of the bright lights from the evening outdoors and the colorful backdrop of the pink-and-yellow-lit bar display created a fun and enjoyable atmosphere. I think it was very clever that the napkin ""holder"" also doubled as a fold-out menu, so the Perch gets bonus points for creativity.

Service: Stellar!
The waiter we had this evening was very nice to us. One of my patrons wanted to retake a picture that the waiter had taken of us and our waiter kindly did so.

Food: Great! 
The margherita pizza was light yet delicious. A friend of mine had the chipotle burger and it looked pretty appetizing from where I was sitting. It all was served within a reasonable time of ordering the food.

Overall: Come visit!
This is a very cool, up-to-date place that has a great environment and staff. Worth a visit for the experience on the second floor of Container Park.",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,1,3,4,OqGVrzeK2lU53PyTrK2oFw

I called the number directly from yelp and spoke to a woman named Courtney. I asked if he restaurant was pet friendly and if we can sit on the porch and she said yes it was, dogs were allowed. So my friends and I made the trek down (1 hour drive), only to be told that DOGS were not allowed. The restaurant staff said it was service animals only and had to leave. 

The woman should have been more specific and said service dogs only. Staff need to be more informative to their customers.

UPDATED REVIEW 4/1/18

I was contacted privately by David who sincerely apologized and invited me back to the restaurant.

I dined in with my sister and nephew on 3/31 and got top notch hospitality. Brandon and the staff were very friendly and recommended a lot of great items! 

It was a perfect day! Warm weather, clear skies, live music and our Moscow mules were AMAZING!!! (FYI-get the Jameson, raspberry and rosemary mule!) 

And I can't forget about the food! We ordered the Calamari, the Bianca flatbread, The Oz, and the juiciest turkey burger I have ever had! 


We wanted to try more but we were so filled!

Once we were sat down we reviewed the menu, and waited about 10 minutes before stopping the gentlemen that seated us, and he mentioned there were no servers - we must order with the bartender, and then the food will be delivered to us. It was a party of 8, and we all got unlimited mimosas so it was a bit annoying that we had to get up, and request another drink every single time.

I've been to the perch before but my partner hadn't so we decided to go for it. Host stand is tricky to find. I noticed many guests have that problem. Maybe a sign saying wait here at the top of the stairs so people will feel acknowledged. We waited a couple of minutes while a gentleman with glasses bussed a table for us so we didn't have to wait longer so I appreciated that.

After we sat down I checked in on yelp and got a free glass of wine and my partner got a sampling of an amazing beer he loved. Our server Alexis was a peach. She was so sweet and took great care of us.

We started with the Arugula flat bread with prosciutto. I'm not one for arugula because I find it too bitter but thisssssssss was amazing. From the sauce to the meat, so delicious. The appetizer almost out did the entree.

I decided to try the seafood pasta special. It was spaghetti pasta with marinara sauce and salmon, calamari and shrimp. I told Alexis I was allergic to tomatoes and wanted the dish so she made a great recommendation, get the Sriracha cream sauce instead. Man am I glad she told me to do that. My partner loved it so much I could tell he wanted my dish. 

I'm from Boston so seafood for me is always iffy out here mainly because I'm seafood spoiled. The shrimp in the dish was NOT good. Very chewy and didn't appreciate the taste. Other than that it was the only negative to the night. 

Eating out on the perch was great we had great views, service, vegas weather and live music. What else could you ask for? Would I come back? Oh yes!! Thank you Alexis and the perch staff.",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,4,3,4,XPQ_VUQdNpGxXjIolPUvNQ

I had the seafood pasta. So flavorful and filling. If you are a fan of red sauce, and mussels, and being really full, this is the dish for you! My friend got the tuna nicoise salad.  She ate every last bite. Very clean, fresh, and flavorful.

Upside was the next service employee we dealt with (our server) was nice and fairly attentive. She provided us with recommendations when asked since it was our first time eating at Perch. However she gave so many options we still had a hard time narrowing things down. 

Now on to the food... This is the reason that score is so low. Its was mediocre unfortunately. I had the infamous Perch burger and it was not that fabulous. I felt it was somewhat bland to have a fried green tomato on it.

Tomato Bisque: It must've been over 105 degrees outside during my visit, but this bowl of soup sounded too good to pass up. It's rich and flavorful, and it packs a bit of heat, but not enough to break a sweat. 

The Terrace: Love corn? This is your jam. I wasn't expecting a whole bowl of grilled corn! The salad was topped with grilled shrimp, tomatoes, chimichurri, and avocado slices. I would've preferred more avocado. Otherwise, this was tasty.  

Lemon Cheesecake:  This has to be one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had. It's a no-bake cake that had a refreshing lemon flavor. The graham cracker crust was solid. From what I've been told, the chef likes to mix things up when it comes to desserts, so daily offerings are always changing. However, I'd probably order this again and again if it were available.

I would have given them four stars, because my salad, The Terrace, was freaking delicious, but they made a couple of mistakes in addition to the SLOW service. It was a great salad with fresh roasted corn, heirloom tomatoes, a slightly spicy chimichurri dressing, and four shrimp. Maybe in a $15 salad they could have gone with 5-6 shrimp.  It was still more than I could finish though, so no big deal. 

Mistake #1 - The brought out my dinner about 10 minutes before my friend's dinner. That was weird and awkward. We just sat and looked at it. Good thing it was a salad, so I didn't have to worry about it getting cold.

We stumbled on The Perch by accident and since it had a lot of good reviews we decided to check it out.

The brunch menu was not too vast, and I ended up eyeballing The Terrace, which is described as a dish with corn, chimichurri, shrimp, and I think tomatoes. For some reason I expected greens or something underneath it but the bulk of the dish was corn and chimichurri, which isn't the end of the world by any means. 

The plate smelled delicious when it came out, and it initially tasted delicious, but after four or five bites the garlic and onion flavors were so overwhelming that I had already begun to apologize to my boyfriend because I knew I was going to reek of garlic for the days to come. If you don't have a problem with a huge amount of raw garlic in your brunch meal, then by all means opt for The Terrace.

This trip to Vegas we had come across so many rude servers at so many well-known establishments. It was so refreshing to come to a restaurant that was all-around such a great experience.

Drinks are delicious - our server doubled as the bartender - Stefan is the best!

FOOD? AMAZING. You can tell the chef and the kitchen staff are meticulous and particular about the taste and presentation -- neither disappointing.
I went with the grilled salmon that came with brussels sprouts and asparagus, topped with a homemade avocado mousse. The kitchen even asked how I'd like my salmon cooked! Truly appreciate that.
My bestie went with the chimichurri chicken sandwich - she devoured the whole thing!

We have found our new go-to spot everytime we come out to Vegas :)

Thanks so much for a great final meal in Vegas!",JZbUI5aHDN4adpQjtpKLBw,2,1,5,sHxLo3CcHJvWwZcgnjLXWw
3705294,2016-08-01,1,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"For some unknown reason, my boyfriend and I decided to brave the heat and take a stroll downtown on a Wednesday afternoon - which I do not recommend, by the way. I could feel my shoes melting on the pavement... Anyway, we're locals with one mutual day off, so we do what we can to make the most of it, living downtown and such. Yadda yadda yadda. Many people have talked about the Perch so we strategized our route to where we could pop in & cool off before checking out the shops in Container Park.

Upon arrival, we were the only patrons in the restaurant. After being seated and served ice water immediately, we were given a moment to chill out and browse the menu. I was a little disappointed with the options. For some reason, I was expecting there to be a bit more variety. Honestly, the brunch menu was a lot more appealing - but it's only available on Saturday & Sunday mornings. Booooo...

I ended up ordering the fried chicken sandwich and the boy got Thai chili chicken tenders with fries. Both were very tasty! You could taste just about every ingredient in the sandwich, which was great. I was nervous because, in my opinion, fried chicken tends to take over & dominate the flavor in other dishes I've had - this was not the case for the Perch. Well done! However, one weird critique I have is with the size of the plate that the sandwich was served on... The sandwich is fairly large and with it being served atop a heap of fries, I had a hard time not making a mess because the plate was so small. Other than that, the Perch gets an A in the food/flavor aspect.

NOTE: This place does not serve Ranch, only chipotle buttermilk dressing. Had to knock off a star for that one, because boy, those chicken tenders & fries would've been out of this world with some plain ol' Ranch to dip 'em in...",ImnJ5KKaWWNjj1E9kEArmQ,2,2,4,EARUUq7LOVPz15eXNgV2gg

Your customer service sucks. You should be a role model not everything that was wrong about The Perch. Because you were the only thing that was WRONG. We would have left of not for our groupon voucher.

I told the waiter, the manager was a total asshole and we probably wouldn't be back. Waiter was aghast at my candid remarks. Just keeping it real. 

Our waiter was great, but forgot to get his name. White kid who rides a board. He was awesome. Very attentive and perky. Hoping he makes more money that el douche. This waiter was great.

Food and drinks were also great. Food wise, one of my best brunches in Vegas. Strongly suggest the Moscow Mule or Margarita. We had shrimp and corn salad and a steak and egg sandwich... Perfection.

We will be back, but I'm hoping to see a different attitude with the hostess/gm.

FOOD:
We came here for brunch and started right off with the Mimosas, Bellinis, and Bloody Mary's. The bartender and our server were very quick at refilling for us.. bottomless indeed!
The Perch Burger was okay.. flavor was good, very simple, juicy patty, but could have used a fried egg in it.
The Steak & Egg Tacos were delicious.. the avocado mouse gave it an interesting flavor. 

AMBIANCE:
A fun, lively vibe during brunch. It's located in a cool spot at Container Park that matches the overall atmosphere of the area.

SERVICE:
Awesome staff! Everyone was welcoming and friendly. We didn't have a reservation and came in during a busy time.. the manager tried really hard to get us in as quickly as possible. Awesome!

Had the hanger steak frites, with garlic aeoli. Turns out the garlic aeoli goes better on the STEAK than the frites (fries), truly enhancing the flavor. Once I figured this out, I was good to go and had a delicious time. The fries are lightly salted, crisp, and tasty. 

The service is great. I love how brightly lit the space is with clean lines and the pink-lit shelves behind the bar. So glad there's another restaurant outside of barbecue and Mexican at the Container Park. Can't wait to go again!",DbQN7bH0bv3ztvy5PvG-jQ,1,0,4,-u3ffJLicYl0QDXWz7MmNA

4164849,2015-06-10,3,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"I came here tonight and I was pretty disappointed with the food and service.

I saw 4 stars on Yelp for this joint and was looking forward to a great meal, but unfortunately Perch did not deliver.

I came here with some friends and both of my friends had steak with salad and steak with fries. I had the poached egg bib salad with chicken. 

I told the waitress to take off 2 things from the salad and I knew very well that there was no mention of any onions on the menu.

Well to my surprise when I got my salad there where onions on it. Unfortunately I can not eat onions, because I am allergic.

This ordeal would have been avoided if the menus were up to date. 

In a nutshell I asked the waitress if she could have the salad remade and she did, but having to wait an additional 15-20 minutes to get my food was not fun.

In all honesty it would have been great if at least half of my salad would have been taken off my bill. 

This was a pretty obvious slip up for a place that supposedly offers 4 star food and service. 

And another bad move on behalf of the staff is when I asked about the Riesling I was told that it was sweet when it was actually dry. In all honesty how can you not know your wines?

This was not what I expected from Perch and at this point if I come back it'll be a while.

There are a few important details that Perch has to work on before I could truly consider them a true 4 star joint.

For now based on the slow service, inaccuracy of their menu and high priced mediocre food I give them 2 stars.",5I6-yegWr4p1mtUMwNkVtg,3,1,2,xW8ZZGdwe7rvBVok_s1jHA

My group was 86'd...I know when you read that you're thinking we earned it but that's not the case. We went for brunch and mimosas to celebrate my sister's birthday. The place is small and busy so it's far from quiet but apparently singing happy birthday is just too much to handle and we were asked to leave. We will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone. We spent hundreds of dollars at this place and they were serving bottomless mimosas. You can't expect quiet with that especially when a single group is the majority of your customers. There was no crude or explicit material and we were only kicked out after all our tabs had been paid. Convenient timing.

4196199,2014-10-16,2,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"Went with large group last week for a birthday and they were very accommodating. The service was prompt , the space is very cute and the prices quite reasonable. This is certainly a welcome addition to the neighborhood and I will definitely be back. 

The cocktails were creative and generally pretty good and the beer and wine list had a nice selection for sure. 

The food was sort of a mixed bag unfortunately but it was their first week so I'm definitely willing to cut them some slack. Hopefully my thoughts below will be somewhat constructive. 

Small Plates:
The Salmon Tiradito was great as were the Tuna Tartare and Beef Tartare. For the price I'd say the beef tartare is some of the best I've had in Vegas. 

The crabcakes on the other hand were pretty wretched. It was hard to identify more than a shred of crab meat in them. It seemed they were composed almost entirely of a filler of some sort and they had the consistency of an undercooked biscuit. The seasonal pickles were similarly hard to enjoy as they were so salty they were basically inedible. They were clearly home-made so I'm hoping it was just a bad batch that no one in the kitchen actually tried this particular jar. It would be better to pull them from them menu for a week while a new batch was made than serve something this salty. The Beet Carpaccio was decent but the acidity of the lemon juice was a bit overpowering and it could have used something to balance it out. 

Flat Breads: 
The Belle was superb and the kitchen had taken the time to properly caramelize the onions which was very much appreciated and not often done. The Lucia was also very nice with a flavorful sausage on top and I'm not typically a big sausage fan. The Cecilia however was a bit of a miss for me. The seared tuna just didn't play well with the acidity of the capers, olives and tomato sauce. 

Large Plates:
The Hanger Steak Sandwich was a damn good sandwich. Cooked to temperature and smothered with their wonderful caramelized onions with a dollop of aioli. The grilled Salmon wasn't quite so hot. The fish itself was moist but the brussel sprouts a bit soggy and the flavors of the salsa didn't quite work with the fish or the vegetables. 

All in all an enjoyable evening but I think they would be well served to scale down their menu. Right now there are just too many dishes that aren't working.",4QeOmAqI5dXBN1g_0HTleQ,8,3,3,_-YKKbyUBD0OOOmqJptZ9Q

4252054,2018-02-10,1,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"After a fun evening of soaking in a bit of Vegas history at the Neon Museum, my friend and I decided we wanted to grab dinner at a nearby restaurant, so we headed towards container park and agreed to try Downtown Terrace. I had previously been to this location when it was named The Perch and I absolutely loved the food so I figured why not try it again. My only concern was that if they changed their name then they possibly changed owners, which therefore meant the food might've changed as well. Rest assured, that is certainly not the case. While they have a new name, they still have the same owners, same great service, and the same fantastic food that'll keep you coming back.

My friend and I decided to sit at the bar and have a few drinks before our meal. Brandon was our bartender and I must say he was the just the absolute best. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. The exceptional service he provided was simply above and beyond any bartender I've seen before. He checked on us often, brought us our food promptly, and made sure we were satisfied the entire evening. One thing that I noticed is if you're sitting at a bar and you order an alcoholic beverage as well as a water, most bartenders will only focus on getting you your next drink, even when your water goes empty. However, Brandon always made sure that my water was refilled which I truly appreciate. He seemed to understand that while I like to enjoy my drinks, I also like to pace myself with water to prevent a future hangover. Truly appreciate that attention to detail.

As for our meal, every item we ordered was delicious! We started off with the calamari and the ceviche as our appetizers. The calamari came with a jalapeño lemon sauce that was so good and the ceviche was very refreshing with just the perfect amount of lime juice. Definitely something I'd order again in the future. For our entrees, I tried the spicy shrimp penne pasta. Loved the flavor of this dish as the sauce was savory with just the perfect hint of spice. My friend had a turkey burger which was flavored so perfectly that he scarfed down every last bite of it. While we were tempted to order dessert, our tummy's were so pleasantly stuffed that we decided to pass on it this time, but made a mental note that next time we're in container park, we will gladly stop into Downtown Terrace again for another delicious meal with a sweet dessert at the end.",KJRQUJEkWVebUImqc4vW_Q,3,3,5,Mjn8ZoeUXXcSTP4hDQDSww

Bottomless mimosas are available for $15 with a two hour limit. What I do like is they bring you a bottle a champagne and a carafe of orange juice to your table. You pour your own mimosas and they bring you more when you are done.

I went to The Perch with a few of my girlfriends from out of town to grab a drink and appetizers before dinner. We took a seat at the bar; I got the garlic aioli fries and a Bloody Mary. 

The garlic aioli fries came out freshly fried; hot, crunchy, and very flavorful. Lots of garlic which I can't complain as I'm a huge fan of any food involved with heavy garlic. Delish!

The Bloody Mary was neat because you get to build your own. They give you a cup poured of any vodka you prefer, a decanter of tomato juice, a side of horseradish, hot sauce, and olives. What a fun and original concept to create a Bloody Mary to your liking at a restaurant... you don't get to do that every day!

Our bartender was very attentive to our needs, however, he didn't smile. It bothered me a little. I don't expect bartenders to be cheesing constantly, but try to look like you're enjoying your time working even a tiny bit...

A group of friends met to try this spot out. There were 8 of us ladies, and we sat outside for dinner. 

Facility:  this restaurant is located in Container Park, so it's definitely small. It's in the back, close the stage, above the toy store. We sat outside on the patio, because it was an amazing night.  For those of you who get cold easily, they have heaters outside to keep the chill off. 

Service: our waiter was Daniel, and he was awesome. He was patient, attentive and added a splash of humor without going over the top. The only part that I didn't like is when he brought the checks out when he thought we were done. This tends to signal the end of the night for some people, and they left after they paid. Just would have preferred him to wait until we asked for the check. Other than that...he was great!

Food:  I ordered the Brainless Raspberries beer on tap, which was pretty good. Not a fan of any sweet drinks, and this just had a hint of raspberries, not an overpowering taste of it. 
A friend and I split a burger and flatbread, so we could taste both. So glad we did, because both were delicious!  
Mine was the Burger and fries with Chipotle aioli. The burger was so good.  It had a fried green tomato on top too!  The aioli was perfect to dip the fries in with just the right amount of spicy. 
Flatbread Bianca was really tasty. It had white cheeses with arugula and prosciutto on top. Crust was perfect too!
A few ladies ordered the Salmon and roasted veggies, and it looked so good. I will get that next time.  

Overall:

If you get bottomless anything you have to fight your way back through the line just to get a refill and with a two hour limit on the bottomless you may only get a couple of glasses before time is up. 

Service is obviously non-existent and due to this the line for ordering can become extremely slow. 

Bottom line: This place used to be great but then they decided to cut corners, the food is still decent but for the price there are plenty of better brunch options downtown. My advice to management: Don't be so cheap...",-XWENxo4B29zEggOnleBDg,1,0,2,-BDvLPZBBfBl418hNpmOog

They had a large party and the kitchen was backed up....  I absolutely love this.   So much better to know I'm waiting for a table and will have great service,  than to order and wait a long time for your food..   And when we did sit down?  Great service and no long waits for food!!   I love honesty!! 

So,  first the staff...  Amazing,  attentive, and super friendly.   Very personable.   It was like friends were waiting on you. 

And the food?  Wow..  That's all I can say.   I had the salmon, and I've had plenty of good salmon in my life,  but this was amazing!  My friend had the steak and fries and devoured it,  it was that good.   Then,  dessert... 

So my friend got the cheesecake and I got the creme brulee..  Even if I can't spell it,  lol,  I definitely ate it!  So good.   The cheesecake was frozen...  Now,  here's the cool part.   Before we could say anything,  our waiter came up and said he found out the cheesecake was frozen, and apologized.   And..  He offered to replace it with something else for free, AND give a to go container for the cheesecake!  We declined the additional dessert, and another person came to make sure we didn't want to take that offer.   Talk about service!!   Food was great,  but the staff made the entire experience amazing.   They were very impressive.

Chicken and Waffle - This was some of the crunchiest chicken I have ever encountered, which I appreciate. It had decent flavor and was very juicy. The dish comes already covered in maple syrup (although I asked for extra in advance) and dusted with powdered sugar. I love the taste to sweet chicken!! 

Steak & Egg Tacos - these are certainly tiny considering the price. But they were delicious! The salsa really carried the flavor and the steak was tender and not overly chewy.

The food is generally pretty good. I like that they have veg options so I don't have to majorly modify anything just to order. Today I had the power greens salad. It was really good. The dressing was really salty, but I like salty so I loved it. My meat eating friend ordered the veggie burger and said it was delicious. I had some of her fries and they were so-so...tasted like run of the mill, from a bag, previously frozen fries.

We got the free wine when we checked in. It was ok...not great but also not awful.

So here's my issue w this place...the staff is just rude. Last time I was there we came at night and missed the ""wait to be seated"" sign. We sat ourselves on the balcony. The waiter came over, told us the table wasn't clean/ready, and then told us they saved that particular table because of the view. Basically we weren't good enough to sit there. We left. 

This time the bartender offered us a high top or the bar and then basically told us we couldn't have a table because they were saved for parties of 3 or more. Our party of 2 sat at the bar. Later we saw 2 guys get seated at a 4 top table. Whoopsie

My friends and I came here yesterday to celebrate our friends 21st birthday. 

On Sunday, they have brunch with bottomless mimosas, bloody Mary's and bellinis. I personally had the bottomless bloody Mary's and the shortrib country hash with a side of bacon. 

The bloody Mary's are nice and spicy, and were definitely not lacking in alcohol. Our server was really friendly. He has on French fry socks and for some reason was holding onto a few children's books. He was very entertaining and made sure we were well taken care of.

The shortrib hash was really good. It has sautéed mushrooms, peppers, the short rib and nice crispy potatoes. I ordered a side of bacon and it was thick and crispy. Which to me makes perfect bacon.

However. My absolute favorite thing here is the monkey bread. By far the best monkey bread I have ever had and everyone should order it. You would definitely not regret it. 

There is a lot of parking near this location, but it is all paid parking, so be aware that it will cost $3-6 depending on how long you eat and want to shop around

We had the beet carpaccio, the grilled corn and shrimp salad (I think it might've been called the ""Terrace""), the steak sandwich, and the french fries. The sandwich was delicious, as was the salad. The carpaccio beets were great quality, but served raw, which I didn't love - would've been better if they had been allowed to marinate in the vinaigrette for a little while. Great idea, though, something I would potentially make and serve. The fries were great quality and perfectly cooked. They seemed to be cooked in some kind of animal fat, likely pork. I prefer vegetable oil for fries, but my dining companions seemed to enjoy them very much. My dad had a salad called ""The egg"", which came with a poached egg and thick-cut bacon. He seemed to enjoy it. I stole a few pieces of bacon, which was tasty.

When we were ready to pay our bill, we finally had to go up to the counter and find the waiter as, even though we had our credit cards clearly sitting on the table showing our readiness to pay, he kept walking by.

I brought my family in to The Downtown Terrace after a friend of mine referred it as a great place to have brunch with my family. 

It was the WORST EXPERIENCE that I subjected my family too. 

There was a female bartender with purple hair and tattoos on her face that kept using profanity across the Resturant and yelling at that poor innocent blonde girl with the tattoos on her arms. I felt really bad for her that she has to be subjected to such a work environment. I watched it go on for awhile as she kept getting bullied. I don't know if that's her manager or what, But a person should NEVER be treated like that. 

We didn't mind the long wait to be seated, since the place was super packed and it's expected anywhere on a Sunday. But after we ordered our food, it seemed like a decade before we got our food and it wasn't hot and felt like it had been sitting out for awhile. The next day I went to go talk to the General Manager and explain what happened. Before I knew it, he started threatening me to beat me up cause he said he was from the streets and that's how he handles things. I can't believe that company would hire such a person that acts like that to paying customers and to be put in that position to deal with the public. 

Let's just say that I will never be visiting that place again and will tell everyone I know and all social media that is attached to that place how horrible of a place it is.

Every little place inside container park has its own unique perks. 

The perch is a really cute date spot if you're looking for something cute & fun! They have a bar and all their food looks super tasty. Make sure to make reservations on weekends because they get busy! I recommend sitting outside because it's right by the stage where they have mini concerts :-)

When we first walked in, we were super confused on what to do. After a minute, someone greeted us & asked if we had reservations. We didn't, but they accommodated us quickly and found us a table inside. I wanted to sit outside, but we didn't have reservations so I didn't want to be complicated. They walked us to a table & we sat there waiting for menus. Little did we know, they were folded around the napkins! lol

Anyway, everything was amazing. My boyfriend ordered the Chimi Chicken Sandwich and I ordered the Hangar Steak Sandwich. We also had an order of fries on the side (not knowing my sandwich came with fries.) The chicken sandwich comes with quac and chips which definitely beats chipotle's dumb overpriced guac. Dumb guac!!!!!! Both sandwiches were very flavorful, but I felt that the fries needed more seasoning. We had to add a bunch of salt & pepper onto ours.

4 stars because the food took reaaaaaally long to come out, but everything was worth the wait.

4691382,2016-12-14,0,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"Review based on a recent Sunday brunch visit. 

Located in the far right corner of Container Park, The Perch sits on the 2nd floor overlooking the park & some of Downtown. It is a well lit, quaint little place to have a casual meal. We were sat right away at a community style table. My party consisted of the three of us, myself included.

The special going on was bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, & bellinis for a decent price. 

What we ordered:
-  chicken & waffles
-  steak & egg tacos
-  chorizo plate

I had the chicken and waffles. I was a bit put off by the amount of syrup they had poured on the waffle.. had I known that they do that- I would have asked to have the syrup separate because I am not a huge fan of having a lot of syrup on my waffle .. the fried chicken was crispy & somewhat flavorful. It just felt a bit lacking. It was just ok. There was a lot of chicken pieces though and the waffle was also prettty big. I probably wouldn't order this dish again though.

My friend told me the tortillas on her steak and egg tacos were straight up cold. And cracking - which means they weren't even warmed up or cooked properly.. she asked our waiter to rectify the situation & he kindly gave her a new plate. She also thought the dish could have been better.

As for the chorizo plate, it seemed to be a winner. A hefty portion and very filling.

The prices aren't too bad. Though personally, I would go somewhere else for brunch. The perch seems like a good place for lunch or dinner .. hoping to come back to try out those dishes.

Our waiter was very polite and kind, which I appreciated.",EfnzVzqWJUVEv8ft3fW2sQ,0,2,3,g6eYOI5GtKtZmK_Em7NYIw

The service was excellent, the setting on a balmy afternoon into evening (with doors open) was very relaxed and comfortable, and the food was excellent.   I will be back and will encourage my local and visiting friends to do the same!
Three of us shared the olive tampanade and fresh mozzarella starters...simple and delicious.   I had the salmon served over brussel sprouts and asparagus...perfectly cooked to my requested 'done' temperature, very fresh, and very tasty...although the sauce... which I had had on the side...has a kick to it!   My guests enjoyed their entrees, not a scrap left on the plates...again a testimony to perfect portion sizes.    The two deserts we 'shared' were scrumptious...the poached pears in a ricotta 'pudding' tasted amazing, but I snarfed down the hazelnut flourless chocolate torte with fresh whipped cream...

Waited about 40 minutes for us to get our food and we weren't really sure why.

We were quite disappointed with the wait but once we did get our food we saw our waiter had split our sandwich and gave us both full orders of fries - SO nice of him, we were very appreciative. 
It was VERY delicious, fries were very good too. I almost wrote my review right then because I was very impressed that 1) he split our food without asking and 2) the food was phenomenal. 

But then, we waited another 30 minutes to get our check. There were two bartenders not helping the seated tables at all while 4 tables sat empty and a mess with dirty dishes begging to be bussed. I felt bad for our waiter as we stared at these bartenders dancing and wiping wet empty glasses behind the bar while only 2 people sat at the bar themselves. I stared at one of them, hoping he'd realize our plates were empty and we were obviously waiting for our check. He didn't seem to notice or bother. 

I really don't blame our waiter; he seemed to be the only one really helping those not at the bar. Just kinda disappointed and hope this place gets things on track because aside from my grievances, it's prime location with delicious chicken.

As locals for over 20 years it was refreshing to see the improvements to downtown   We were pleasantly surprised to find The Perch restaurant too.  It looked pretty busy and the menu items were interesting so we gave it a try. Everything was really good and enjoyed our meal.  The most impressive things was how the manager was so observant and accommodating.... The wait staff was really busy and it was refreshing to see how in tune the manager was in making sure everyone was taken care of and actually waited on tables to assure a good experience.

I don't always rely on these reviews regarding food because everyone's pallet is different and there's always that one person who has to find something wrong -_- ALSO THERE WAS A PARTY OF 8-10 PEOPLE THAT WERE REALLY LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS THAT WERE ASKED TO LEAVE BECAUSE THEY WERE SOOOOO LOUD WHICH PRETTY MUCH RUINED OTHER CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCE AND  EVERYONE COMPLAINED BECAUSE OF THEM. -_- despite THOSE people the review must go on :-)

After being to pretty much every brunch in Vegas now my wife and I will start writing reviews. The food is fresh and freakin delicious. Bottomless mimosas for $15? Perfect and it lasts until 3pm. Service is important to us so the hostess as well as our server were so cool! The ambiance is super dope. although we would love to eat outside, the heat would burn every hair on our heads off but I'm sure in the fall or spring this place would be great for an outdoor brunch! 

Meals:
 
Breakfast sandwich with chorizo is FIRE (Fire=really good)
Steak and egg tacos bomb (bomb=good but not FIRE)
Breakfast sandwich with bacon is FIRE (see definition above)

The drinks were the part that I enjoyed. I had a glass of wine but I did see some cocktails I would like to try in the future.

My uncle ordered a bloody mary and it was served as a build your own bloody mary station. It had the alcohol, tomato juice and different toppings separated so you could make it as you see fit. I thought it was really awesome and would try that if I came back.

Met with my good girlfriend here this afternoon for a little brunch and girl talk. Thank goodness for outdoor seating because indoors is ""extremely"" loud. I found it kind of odd that the server even shared her frustration about how loud it was inside while seating us outdoors.

Monkey Bread $6 (DELISH nice gooey & sweet)
Fruit Plate $8 (Satisfying portion size of seasonal fruit)
Egg White Omelette $10 

**Shrimp & Grits $15 I appreciate the chefs creativity with the panko grit balls however they were terrible and left a gritty residue in my mouth. I found it odd the shrimps weren't sautéed either. The shrimp cocktail on top of salad was not satisfying and I'm pretty disappointed by this dish.

Bottle of Aqua Panna

**(1) Cup of Coffee the Sugar never made it to the table! 

We requested Cholula hot sauce to spruce up the shrimp & grits and the server showed up with Tabasco at the end of the meal. DEFINITELY A SERVICE FAILURE.

Upon entering the restaurant, the staff seemed reluctant to sit us outside. It was twice suggested that we just dine at the bar. If outdoor seating was unavailable, then sure - but we were eventually sat at a booth outside. 

Wait staff was inconsistent and confused. Being a pescatarian, I ordered the shrimp salad and a side of fries. I was delivered a cobb salad with bacon. Not realizing our second waiter had put the order in incorrectly, I took a few bites. 

I would've told either of the random assortment of waiters ""tending"" to us, of the mistake and requested a replacement, but there wasn't follow up until it was time for us to pay the bill. I actually had to ask that he remove the item from our receipt...like I would've paid for a salad, with meat, that I couldn't eat?!

Food: The potato puree that came with my husband's beef carpaccio was so good that he, literally, created a wall of drinking glasses to prevent me from taking bites of it.

5217671,2017-03-10,0,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"A few weeks ago, I had Sunday brunch at The Perch. The restaurant is presumably so named because it is perched on the second story overlooking Container Park. Befitting its location though, the entire restaurant seemed like more of an idea than a thing of substance.

The restaurant has communal seating of the type one might expect at a southern German beer garden. Unlike the sturdy tables at the beer garden, ours had a mossy ditch running down the center which caused another patron to upset her mimosa right onto my friend's lap.

We started off sharing some monkey bread, which was the best monkey bread I ever had - moist, saucy & delicious. The menu is rather limited and the prices won't set you back much. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. Because they had no eggs Benedict, I had to break my streak of reviewing the eggs Benedict everywhere I go, and I ordered a burger instead. The vegan in our party tried to order a fruit plate, just to find out they were ""out of fruit plates,"" and Mark tried to order the steak & eggs, only to find out that the steak could only be cooked well done.

I suspect that the fiasco that was my burger was the product of poor quality ingredients, sloppiness & probably some witless ideas. The burger comes with maple bacon, something that aspires to Emmentaler cheese, and a fried green tomato that hadn't a single hoot left to give. It was supposed to come with chipotle mayonnaise, but was in fact served in a state of undress, so I used my friend's garlic aioli instead. The garlic aioli and maple bacon disagreed with each other, but I'd be willing to bet that combining the maple bacon with chipotle mayonnaise would not be much better a plan. The burger wasn't seasoned properly, if at all, and the fried green tomato tasted like the flavorless fried cornmeal mush that is so popular in Appalachia. The fries were decent, as was the service.

Overall, I have to conclude that The Perch is not worth the trip.",O0JPkrL9cBxx2u1Ka9iAXA,1,0,2,TfRGJNUG69MX_zeH2do32A

5259180,2017-08-26,1,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"Downtown Terrace is formally know as The Perch.  Nothing has changed here except for the restaurant name.  Downtown Terrace is located at the back half on the second floor of the Container Park Downtown.  I absolutely love this place for my boozy brunches on the weekend.  This establishment is very casual and relaxed.  When you order the bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's (as I usually do) the waiters continue to have your glass on full.  I mean really, who doesn't enjoy bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, and bellinis when you're in vegas. You pay $15 to enjoy all these drinks for two hours. 

During my dinning experience here, I always order the Monkey break as a table appetizer, and then the chicken and waffles as my meal.  However, during this visit I opted for the Brisket and Potatoes.  The monkey bread is to die for, between the cinnamon sugar flavoring and the melted butter, one could never go wrong with this appetizer.  Next, the chicken in waffles are great.  The chicken is cooked almost to perfection and the waffle is the size of a belgium waffle, that is light and fluffy.  In regards to the Brisket and Potatoes, it contained a nice layer of sauce and nicely cooked potatoes.  The food was not rich nor salty at all.  I give this place a two thumbs up!

The dining room is open, bright, and very comfortable, with the bar being the main star of the space. My partner and I were greeted quickly when we walked in. The gentleman gave us the choice of two awkward tables in the dining room (well, one was in the entryway of the restaurant, and the other was an awkward high top in the middle of the dining room), so we opted to go outside. Not sure if they were understaffed, or if we caught the tail-end of a massive dinner rush, but every open table was dirty, and most not even pre-bussed. It took him about 5 minutes to clean our table (we were, however, greeted by every employee while we waited), and I must admit, it was worth it. The evening was beautiful last night, and the singer on the main stage of the Container Park was very talented, which really help compliment the evening for us, since we were celebrating a new job that I just landed. 
Our server, Alexis, was very friendly and accommodating. She was obviously busy, but she made it a point to come chat it up with us on a few occasions. It turns out that my partner and I know her sister's boyfriend - Vegas is really a small town, when you get down to it.  How often do you have organic, pleasant conversations with your server, and figure things out like that? My partner has a tomato allergy, so she was able to come up with substitution ideas on the fly, and they were spot-on!
We started with the Bianca Flatbread, and added the prosciutto, of course. I love it when they print the up charge on the menu so there isn't a question of what you're getting yourself into. The Flatbread was delicious, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, the toppings were generous and the sauce was delicious. 
I used my Yelp Check-In and got a small glass of the 1664 Blanc. I've had 1664 before, but never the Blanc. I was living for this beer! I really enjoyed the peach notes, and how smooth it was. I had to get a pint. 
I had the Hanger Steak Sandwich for my main course. It was cooked to a perfect medium, like I asked, and the caramelized onions were on point. The mayo was a bit overpowering, and the bread a little too tough, but it was still very enjoyable. The fries were great. My partner gave the fries a 6 out of 10, but I say they were more of an 8. Lol They were crispy on the edges, but still soft inside. The seasoning and truffle oil really set them off. 

This was a great first impression, and can't wait to try them out again. I had my eyes on the Chicken and Waffles...",yPFB_NuRX4W_nAkxnTKxhQ,2,2,4,iY-f1i_UC1xgSl4cqmhIAg

There were five of us that went for brunch and we decided to take advantage of family dining and all you can drink. What a brilliant idea! Thankfully, with all you can drink....you can switch it up! Want a Bloody Mary...here you go! Want to try the Mimosa next....enjoy! 

We decided on the Mimosas in the end....so our wonderful server Mike (he's super tall, you can't miss him) brought us a Champagne Bottle and a carafe of juice! Thank you Mike for knowing your audience! 

The food was delicious! The group was a mix of meat and non meat eaters; and they had no problems tending to our needs. We shared the grits, monkey bread, fruit plate, hash browns, short ribs hash, and berry crepes....I stuck to the vegetarian friendly items...and I loved them! Everything was expertly crafted with flavour, visual appeal, and over all perfection. I would not have changed a single thing about this brunch!

Your menu is the napkin holder. Although the menu seems small (only a few selections) - everything looked interesting. There was only one server the times I've been here but service has always been good.

Crab Cake:
Lots of crab meat. The sauce is spicy. 4/5

Fries with Garlic Aioli:
Amazingly crunchy. They must double fry their potatoes. The aioli had a strong garlic flavor which I love. I can finish the entire plate all by myself. 4.5/5

Salmon:
Comes with Brussels sprouts, asparagus and topped with guacamole. The Brussels sprouts were tender and I like them a bit crunchy. The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned. 3/5

The Terrace:
Shrimp with Chimichurri, grilled corn, avocado, and tomato. Refreshing and light. I love the flavor combo. 4/5

I've tried to eat here before but the first time I showed up for a (late) lunch with a few family members, they were having a private event so it was a no go. We're locals so I knew I'd give it another shot since I really like the vibe of container park and knew I'd be back. 
When we arrived, a very polite young lady promptly approached us and greeted us. We asked to sit on the patio and she let us pick our table. ""Reserved just for us"" she said....lol
She left and then came back with menus,place mats and utensils and let us know someone would be with us shortly. There seemed to be a little confusion as to who our server would be so we sat waiting for a LITTLE bit longer than I think ""usual"". Once they figured out who, our server was Daniel, (cool mustache dude!) he was friendly and helpful to all our questions.

We started with an appetizer of fried calamari. It had bits of lightly breaded and fried jalapeños and lemon slices served with aioli. It was very tasty. The fried lemon slices were a delicious touch! 
Next, our entrees: 
I had the grilled salmon on a bed of roasted cut asparagus and Brussels sprouts topped with salsa cruda (it was actually an avocado mash) the vegetables were roasted to absolute perfection! Its the ONLY way to eat Brussels in my opinion.   

My husband had the Hanger Steak and carmelized onion sandwich which he said was excellent.
At the end of our meal, there was an awkward snafu with our check getting mixed up with another guest but Daniel  apologized sincerely and provided us with an itemized printout of our check which just so happened to be the exact dollar amount of another couple who had just dined there. He was totally honest and up front about it, which we appreciated. Not a huge issue, as long as its the correct amount. 
Certainly not worth ruining an over all great dining experience or losing a star. 
The GM Ryan, also approached us and asked about our food and service. He provided a short survey which I filled out. They did a fine job. I look forward to going back with friends and family sometime. Perhaps a weekend brunch sometime or ""lunch with the girls"".

We asked our awesome server, Nora, what she recommended on the menu and she told us about the Breakfast Steak Tacos, Bananas Foster French Toast, and Smothered Egg Biscuits. We ordered one of each and did not regret that decision. The latter of which was my order and I devoured it in record time. It was almost too good! The homemade gravy was out of this universe. We all sampled each other's dishes and we couldn't get over how delicious everything was.

For dessert, we ordered the Monkey Bread. Again, phenomenal. Nora even put a candle in it because we told her that it was our friend's birthday, so we also sang ""Happy Birthday"" to him.

For drinks, we paid $15 for bottomless Mimosas and Bloody Marys. Definitely well worth it.

Now the negative.. They advertise Brunch Fri, Sat & Sun 9-3 on Yelp, however we could not order brunch for some BS reason. A special event earlier in the day prevented them from offering their brunch menu, we arrived at approx 11:30 AM..

The server was kind and courteous but was more preoccupied with a meeting with her boss as opposed to tending to her table. Could've spent our hard earned $38 at plenty of other places. 

Food was ok, temp of steak was a little under medium but was edible. Fries w/steak had no salt. Egg white omelete was also not seasoned nor were we offered salt & pepper..",430eI3kOdr7ISw6X1oaqUw,2,0,2,TIqNWyrm9e1gykVvokCgfQ

It was very chilly so we sat inside on Friday night after thanksgiving. They only take reservation for 8 or more so I had made one for 8 people earlier that morning. Our group ended up being only 7. There were only 4 people in the restaurant when we arrived at 7:50 and we told them we would wait at the bar for the rest of our party to make sure we didn't take up more room than necessary. They didn't love this idea but I thought this was better than taking up too much room. The restaurant is quite small. 

We ordered some drinks at the bar which took a little bit to prepare even though there were 3 bartenders and only 4 people in the restaurant. We sat down at our table and ordered some additional drinks and our food within 10 minutes of sitting. 

The restaurant did start to pick up and most of the tables became full. 30 minutes later and 2 of us still didn't have our drinks. We asked for them again and he apologized and brought them right away. The food took a long time as well. Close to an hour to get our food and it came out in shifts. 2 people got their meal then 4-5 minutes later another 2 people got their meal and so forth....it seemed a little strange that not everyone was served within just a minute or 2 of each other. I understand a person only has 2 hands but having worked in restaurants when there is a table of 7 you ask another server to help take out the plates. 

Overall, the drinks were good, location great, but subpar service. I've heard wonderful things about their brunch so hopefully I can have a better experience with their service then!",K2G9MvFdsPFRplJkIj_qGw,0,0,3,D94GOXZ8ToRLuc8l5Fe0dA

The menu is very limited, so all 4 of us had a simple steak and fries. I was happy that my rare steak did indeed come out rare (a lot of restaurants don't seem to take you seriously that you want your steak rare, so they give it to you medium rare). While it was a perfect done-ness, it was filled with so much gristle that I probably wasted a good portion of the steak spitting it out on the side of the plate. The seasoned butter was a yummy addition, and the fries were a generous portion and done just right. I was simply disappointed in the quality of the steak, especially for the price, and the fact that, while I am in no terms what you would call a picky eater, the steak and fries was the only thing on the menu that looked appealing to me.

 Yup, that's me. F Pigalle was closed on Monday, so I pitched The Perch, thinking it would be a great time. 
 I made a reservation weeks ahead of time, confirmed morning of, all was going well. 
 Our evening unraveled just about immediately. Our table was ready (yay) with zero wait, right on time. But then time came to figure out who will be taking care of us and when that person would make appearance. 
Guess what 14 people that got out of a day full of meetings want to do right away? Ding ding ding. I won't go into boring details, but it was 55 minutes from the time we sat down until every member of our party had a drink. No joke. Almost an hour. By that time first served were, yep, done with their drinks. We couldn't even kick off an evening with a toast. I get handcrafted cocktails, but was it possible to staff more than one bartender considering there was a three weeks advance notice?...
 The drink fiasco that dragged out for an hour put such a damper on everyone's mood, I'm not even sure anyone paid much attention to food. I tried calimari and will say it was delicious, my veggie burger was tasty, but fries were super lame. They were so inconsistent plate to plate, you couldn't really tell what they should taste like. Mine were golden brown, over fried and dry, the appetizer ones were thick and soggy. So bizarre. 
I will say, I dreaded food coming out as dragged out as the drinks, but it was actually very well timed and coordinated.

- these service was horrible. Waited 10 minutes to be seated on a non busy night mostly because the host person was too busy chatting it up with his friends. Whom by the way arrived after we were already waiting. 
- another 20 minutes before anyone came over to get drink orders/ bring water. 
- our orders were taken by one of the bartenders that took it upon herself to come from around the bar to help us. We never actually got a waiter.
- after she dropped our food off (about 30 minutes after we ordered) she disappeared. 
- after she disappeared literally NO ONE came to check on our table. We had to walk in and ask the bartender for our check.

What I liked most about Perch:

1. Customer service - far & away Perch offered the best customer service I experienced during my stay in downtown Las Vegas.  The staff was very friendly, informative, & accommodating.

2. Diversity of menu - there were several options, making this a great place to go with people with different tastebuds!

The only suggestion I have for improvement is the wait time.  When I arrived, late on a weekday evening, the place was maybe 20% full & most people seemed to have already received their food.  I ordered a very simple salad to take out & it took at least 30 minutes to come out.  I was a bit surprised given the circumstances.

My favorite spot to sit is at the bar because the bartenders are so friendly and fun. It's always a good time here. The food is not mind blowing but it's good! Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots. Get their Early to avoid long waits!,vfWLo6K0db5PTspsXLnr4A,0,0,4,_SgV6F0U4sBpT7MOncX_rw

Try the Bianca flatbread, chopped salad (which is very unique and amazing) and the chimmichurri chicken. Even the tortilla chips are made fresh each morning.

I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!!",bIw2bHKYXokpA0jsqtKetA,2,1,5,zuDjKK70uZJnqU1V9QAEvg

5847493,2015-11-10,1,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,This place is a little expensive but the food is A-MA-ZING! And you get the added bonus of being able to go to container park. The place is small so to get a table make sure that you go a little before the peak eating hours so that you can secure your place.  It does get noisey when there are a lot of patrons but a neat trendy place to eat for sure.  I am going to try the brunch menu the next time around.,kM70xTwz9sAJ3Zc6AdCLHg,1,1,5,okHI9lFZwbt35SMtn17XBw

5908481,2018-03-23,3,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"First time visit for this location, I had no idea that this place was located in Container Park.
It's actually in a good location, 2nd level over viewing the little grassy area.
You can definitely grab your food to go and hang out downtstairs with kids or if the day permits it enjoy your food out and about.
I definitely used the outdoor seats while I waited for my goodies. I like that they had infused water ready for anyone to grab. With the summer approaching that is a definite plus. I also noticed that they had a very extensive drink selection and the knowledge to recommend and prepare a delicious drink or pour you a nice glass of beer.
Let's move onto the food
I didn't really order as much as I would like. Good thing I came with my friend, and we were able to order two items to try. The first thing that caught our eye was the waffle and chicken. It's not your typical chicken and waffle they actually amped it up with fruits!  I wasn't too sure if it would work and boy was I wrong! They paired very well and definitely had a burst of flavor, I loved the strawberries and apples with the caramel sauce and raspberry drizzle.  My meal was so good, and it was definitely enough to share since we ordered the edamame, it was so seasoned and good perfectly. I definitely couldn't stop. Hence my poor attempts of finishing my meal.
This place has definitely got some good dishes and the staff is super friendly. I simply have no complaints.",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,4,3,4,-AwbUIhF2k941_5rJsRxPA

This is an excellent place for dinner, lunch, brunch, or just late night drinks. The Container Park is a great place to chill out for all ages. The Perch has incredible food, friendly staff and excellent bartenders. 

Our server was super nice and very attentive. The gentleman who manages The Perch greeted us outside as we sat in the sun waiting for the place to open. 100% hands on to ensure we were happy. 

We sat outside, enjoyed the great weather and relaxed on the couch. I had bottomless Bloody Mary's, which are the best in town. I'm a Bloody Mary snob and I've tried them all over the world. The Perch is #1 hands down. 

I ordered the monkey bread to start which was outstanding. Even my super picky wife enjoyed it. For the main course I ordered the Brioche French toast. Amazing. The bread had a crispness to it like it was coated in corn flakes. The bananas were warm and perfectly cooked. The toast was decadent, with plenty of caramel sauce. I ordered bacon to balance the sweetness, and honestly it should be included with the meal to balance it out. Bacon was super crisp. 

I'm so excited about this place and so invested in their success that I've told every friend and coworker about it. In the middle of brunch my wife turned to me and said, this is our place now. We'll be back.",AgtVmIj-jyOmGZHfY8_JSA,1,1,5,WyQ4KG6TLTRLD1AuoZbCTg
5953070,2016-11-07,0,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"I was here couple days ago and it was OK. The food was actually a little disappointing, not bad per se, but not what I had envisioned when looking at the whole package.

Restaurant itself seems to be more on the upscale side and modernish. Everything is impeccably clean and nothing out of place. The bar seems to be stocked fairly well, and the music they play is inspiring, albeit a little loud for me personally. The menu was refreshing, clean (no clutter), and evoked thoughts of grandeur.

Food though was a different story. 

Ordered the cheeseburger with bacon, and took the bacon off to feed my cats. The bacon was very brown, crispy, wrinkled, and stiff. Looked very tasty and not greasy (cat enjoyed immensely). The Burger itself seemed to be dry and tasteless and very well cooked, like all the moisture was cooked out. Might be fine for some but I prefer mine a little less dry.

Might come back next time am in area, not overly sure.",_IcrRgXW1gtVNruseNHAJQ,0,0,4,e17PL6JiOMViWhT4h2i4gw

5993776,2016-03-24,2,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"We popped in Tuesday night for what was supposed to be a quick drink and bite to eat...however, the server gods didn't seem to be in our favor. It took forever to get our food, just as long to get refills on our water, and an eternity to get our check (only after requesting for it more than once). I can't even recall who our server was, as he never introduced himself and never returned after taking our order. Our water, alcoholic beverages, food, and check were all brought to us by different employees. I'm not sure if that's the system they choose to operate on, but I will say it definitely wasn't efficient. For such a small establishment, things should have run much smoother. Regardless of whether or not they had a table of 10 seated, who seemed to be taking up everyone's attention. Oh, and as for the food...it was just alright. The calamari was tasty, but saturated in grease, as if the oil it was fried in wasn't hot enough. The terrace salad, while tasty, was lacking everywhere else...with 4 small shrimp, a handful of corn, a few spoons of avocado, and a couple split tomatoes, $15, I think not. And, my daughter's chicken tenders were practically burnt! All in all, with the service lagging and the food being nothing special, I don't see us returning anytime soon.",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,1,1,3,GoM7_CGR0-P8qxFqntVtIA
5996423,2017-05-05,0,eYJcI9cI6-kJ2NQpYdHcLw,"Lately my husband has been into this brunch kick and we've tried quite a few places for brunch. This place is in container park in downtown hidden in the corner on the second floor. When we arrived we were greeted by the hostess and were told we had to wait for 15-30 minutes for a table. It worked out for us because there was a cool toy store right below that we played around in and in no time we were texted to come back up. When we got back up to the restaurant the hostess did not address us first, but addressed the couple behind us and seated them. This kind of set me off because we were literally standing in front of her and had been told to come back up. After seating them the hostess finally asked us how many was in our party and we told her 3 but also told her we were here prior and received a text to let us know to come back up. We were seated and got the usual all you can drink specials that many brunch spots have. My husband got the mimosa and I chose to get the Bellini which was super sweet for me. My husband got the steak and eggs tacos which he really enjoyed and I got the shrimp and grits which I enjoyed. I have never personally had the shrimp and grits before so I have nothing to compare it to but thought the sauce on it paired really well with the salad. Overall the food was good ,but the first experience with the hostess made me not feel very welcome.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,1,1,3,q2IS0twkERklPGJTypIsPQ
