When I visit them, this is the place I ask my mom to take me to for their YUMMY sticky rice and fish/snow pea dish. Sorry, I don't know the actual names of these dishes! My mom's the fluent one in Chinese.

Even my godparents who don't know much about Chinese/Cantonese cuisine really love this place! 

Give this place a try. I hear they're open again for lunch.

Enjoy!",Eesh08M-fedW9Gtst_m3Wg,0,0,5,KxttdZCWJ8JdB00IcMz0lw
1138508,2009-04-12,0,jNhxnj9j_spThcSzJMaeTw,"Hit  Kan's last week for dinner  with my girl. 

Ordered : White fish ( wok stir fried with water chestnuts, sugar peas ) , Goose ""parts"" ( as in the stuff normal people don't eat ) , salt/pepper squid, pan fried noodles, rice.

One must be suspicious when the fish comes to you within 2 minutes of ordering it ( may have been 1 minute ) - their wok must have some serious heat because the food was pipping hot !  the fish was moist and tender but i thought there was too much corn starch in the sauce.

the squid - decent and great price ( $8 )  for the serving size.

The goose - not my thing, but  my girl was disappointed in the quality - way too much sauce.

the noodles - very dry, my girl kept saying - not fresh, not fresh, not fresh.  ok i get it, the noodles ain't fresh !!

Came in with high expectations, left saying, scratch one more chinese restaurant off the list.

total cost - $44",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,2,0,2,PiKT7mS5_BW8JR64tuOqVQ

We went there once at 1130PM after driving around looking for a Chinese restaurant with our great friends, Galena and Sebastiaan. Found out this place is open until 4AM!!

The beef chow fun is delicious. I can't remember the rest of the dishes but they were all 8-9 out of 10 to this Chinese food snob. 
I have driven there three time since late summer and all three times they have been closed.

06/29/2010. It has been a very long time since I returned to the restaurant. The place was remodeled and is not much cleaner. And I have been back there three times in 6 weeks. Last week, we took a Korean mother and daughter there and our dishes were:

Peking roast duck
Salt and pepper pork chops
Seafood tofu in clay pot
Chicken chow fun with black beans

Total bill: $43.

The mother and daughter team finished off the Peking duck. They ranted and rave about it. They rate Chinese restaurants based on their Peking duck. 

My wife almost finished off the pork chops and seafood tofu.
I sampled all but loved the chow fun best.

Best thing is we went to the Russian grocery store and bought some European beer and asked the waiter if we could drink our own beer there. First he said ""$5 because we sell beer here."" We decided not to. Then he brought out 4 tall cold glasses for us and said ""Go ahead and drink."" We tipped him generously at 30% for making the night memorable. 

We had little leftovers but enough for two lunches. And they were awesome the next day.

I wish I had more time here to go there again. 

Not sure why others have such bad ratings/experiences for the restaurant. Maybe my taste is not so well developed. I compare the food in Kan's to what I grew up with in Penang, Malaysia and it is comparable in all instances.",xNH7lXLTyWfzuaeNwMZoww,0,0,5,qwcb4zTyxSBtlpnnhJNLdQ
2017789,2009-12-29,0,jNhxnj9j_spThcSzJMaeTw,"Sooooo poorly run, inefficient, and overly seasoned.  Should have known since my parents found an ad for this ""dim sum"" place.  Let's just say that Kan shouldn't advertise ""Dim Sum"" OR ""Kitchen"" at all.  

Arrived to a full house a little before noon.  Should be a good sign I thought.  2 waitresses + 1 host/manager/busboy.  Not a good equation.  
We get seated about 10 min. in and I've already selected our Dim Sum choices on the paper checklist menu.  We hand it in before we're all even seated - we were so hungry.  We were told right off the bat that dim sum items would take longer than ""anything fried"".  
I ca't even waste the effort to recount each dish.  Everything was overly salty or overly greasy.  Even the rice was old and broke apart.  Only saving grace was the Chow Fun w/bok choy.  It seemed like every table ordered that same dish.  
BTW - once we got the dim sum dishes, they came out ONE AT A TIME.  Even when you ordered 2-3 of the same dim sum item (we had 9 ppl), you would only get each tray one at a time.  Needless to say we were exhausted with our meal by the time we had gotten our last dish after 2pm.  And half of it came out cold. 
Save your time and money and go anywhere else.",CjnD1j3fV5lPTyGMY-WWeA,1,0,1,sbqKRM2teHiXFFNV-zH8OQ
2531888,2010-04-02,0,jNhxnj9j_spThcSzJMaeTw,"Kan's kitchen is located in a strip mall where chinese food is a dime a dozen. What drew me here were the reviews I read from fellow Yelpers.
Why is it that each and every chinese restaurant I walked into has bad decor? Do they all use the same interior designer?
Anyway, we ordered a couple of the popular picks from the dimsum list. Service is courteous and fast. Taste of noodles and  pot rice is very flavorful, msg? maybe but more likely YES.
The restroom/storage can use some cleaning.
The overall rating of the place is a 3.",ZiO2Wr41kZ4Vz64aheBFPQ,0,1,3,FqMwRfpQeO2fFN4MWQ9YTg
4520084,2010-02-25,0,jNhxnj9j_spThcSzJMaeTw,"All dim sum (S, M, L) is $1.80.  All dishes are very authentic and tasty.

Service:  Very good and traditional (i.e. when the waitress returned with our tea pot, she would pour it for you.)

Environment:  Clean and simple

Price:  Do I need to say?  Of course, it is cheap.

I will go back to try their dinner menu for sure.

This is a good find in Vegas.",ERFbDSU0bg-dY6Pzgjl_Rg,1,0,4,BpQVTuA8W_JeRBdQTij0hQ

I've tried almost all the chinese restaurants in vegas and ive got to say this one i highly recommended.  After they remodeled, the food is even better and the place is extremely clean.  I know a lot of people like KJ kitchen but that place is small crowded and dirty.  So why wait 30min - hr for that when you can have the same quality food at Kans Kitchen.",gvuvcjAVl1ElyXTgU80VRg,1,0,5,VtBL8KSZPmwg5qVCFsyAIg

But I don't like the pork bun and the shrimp ball , that's why I only give them 4 stars. I would recommend friends to visit them and I would definitely going back next time  .",XRJrdUpE4ZlOlcshvwSNaw,1,0,4,udn3bIIyWexDCW3am35i5A

Nonetheless, we came a bit after 9 pm and noticed a steady stream of Chinese families there for a dinner too.  They had a Specials menu - all in the Chinese though.  The waiter couldn't do much with translating beyond 'beef, chicken, etc.' and ended up giving us the Midnight Specials menu which is happily in English!  All items are $4.99 each!  Score!

We ended up with:

* Deep Fried Salt and Pepper Tofu ($4.99) - Little cubes of tofu that are deep fried and spicy.  We both enjoyed this.  
* Steamed Chicken with Mushroom ($4.99) - A very simple dish and it's exactly as described - chicken and mushroom.
* Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodle ($7.95) - This came off the regular menu and we ordered the noodles separate from the sauce.  (Y'know, so the noodles stay crunchy and don't get soggy underneath too fast

Overall, we find ourselves there when we're looking for some authentic Chinese food without all the frills.  Sure, service is what you expect with only one waiter working and you need to wave him down when you want him.  But it works for us, especially when we're given the specials menu!

Update! (12.11.10)

Drove by this evening and they have shut their doors!  Nearby Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli confirmed that they are not CLOSED!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,6,5,3,dKN97mleKx3sAWfCLH2vCA
5821630,2009-01-21,0,jNhxnj9j_spThcSzJMaeTw,"I am always skeptical about trying new Chinese food restaurants, but I will definitely be back to Kan's Kitchen. 

I have tasted the following: 

Yang Chow Fried Rice - The rice was very tasty and hit the spot! My only request is bigger pieces of meats. 
Beef Pan-Fried Noodles - I had certain expectations and this plate met all of them. The noodles were crispy and the gravy was delicious. Together made the perfect dish. 
Spicy Salt and Pepper Pork - They were very generous with the Spicy Salt and Pepper and it's awesome to mix in with your fried rice. YUM! I can't forget to mention the pork was very tender. 
Strings Beans in XO sauce - If you don't like vegetables, you'll change your mind once you taste this dish. You'll finish a plate like you'll finish a bag of M&M's. 

Overall, the food was not too greasy and not too salty, but just enough to be authentic Chinese food.",xA_upwVTOVtXkS0NGISGng,0,0,4,PN_3b2iTfQzO1ybMwbChmQ
