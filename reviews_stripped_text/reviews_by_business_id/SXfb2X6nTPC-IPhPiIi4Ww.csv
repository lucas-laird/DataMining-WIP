My husband was attempting to order a sandwich but he wanted it in a wrap so the person taking his order had to adjust the check..they then told him that the wrap is a lettuce wrap not a tortilla wrap so he attempted to explain what he want while the ""manager/supervisor"" got frustrated/furious! He cut my husband off, rolled his eyes and proceeded to try and tell him ""what you got to do..""

My husband asked him if he had a problem because he was rolling his eyes. The supervisor then told him to leave the store or he was going to call the cops! Are you freaking kidding me?!

I popped in for a sandwich one day, and my life has never been the same. Yeah. It's a chain. Who cares. It's damn good. And it's VERY affordable. Most sandwiches are about $5. With better quality than the ""public transportation"" of sandwiches.

All the sandwiches are the same size. Order by number, which is great for the indecisive (like me). 

My favorites here are the Beach Club, The Gargantuan and the Vito.

You can't go wrong. Also, if you like pickles, order one. It's a giant kosher, sliced to your perfection.

My only advice is to ask your sandwich person to cut the sandwich in half. You may want to take some home.

Lastly, you can also buy their day-old bread, which is equally amazing.

In the case of this particular Jimmy John's a pervading mildew-like smell hits me every time I walk in this place.

I'd pick up a slim on my way to the Amtrak Illini train on any journey back home, and probably also eat Jimmy John's back in my hometown as well.  We were tight.
I went through a phase with the turkey tom (""#4,"" highly recommended - it has sprouts!), and then the roast beef (""#2,"" ask for easy mayo), but never really had a favorite.  They're both so good and so different, so I'd go with the mood of the time.  But no matter what - delivery or pickup, eat in or carry out, lunch time or late night, Illinois' Jimmy Johns never did me wrong.
We had a brief reunion in Denver a couple years ago, but because the only JJ in California is in Clovis (what?!), another reunion was a longtime coming.
That's where this JJ's comes in.  We came here the day after Thanksgiving, after a wonderful time hiking around Red Rock Canyon.  We were famished and thirsty and Jimmy John's met all of our needs.  But here's where it got interesting (or at least my pathetic wannabe foodie idea of interesting!): I decided I wanted the tuna sandwich (""Totally Tuna,"" ""#3""), and instantly developed a new favorite.  JJ's menu will declare ""My tuna rocks!,"" and they tell no lies.  (True story: it was also so fast I freaked!)  It was a wonderfully flavorful tuna salad, and topping it with tomato, cucumber, and sprouts was an awesome flavor combo.  I love tuna sandwiches, and this was by far the best I'd had yet!  And I haven't even started taking about the bread yet!  It's so good you'll just have to try it - and you might find yourself buying some of their super cheap day-old bread!

You can't add mayo if it doesn't normally come with mayo.

I asked for a slim with mayo, nope....but they can give you a mayo packet to apply the mayo yourself.  Okay....

Now,back to the fact that all sucks...the taste of the sandwich and cost of the sandwich are good, thus earning three stars. Plus they are turbo fast at getting the sandwich into your hand (because....no changes)!  You dint get a sack or napkins unless you ask, but that's no big deal I guess.

For better tasting sandwiches at higher price and longer wait, try Capriottis or which wich.  It all depends on your budget and time available",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,1,0,3,3S-3fkID7UeP7yzjFNXVfA

With a nice hangover And a belly that needed to be reload of normal food, we headed over to Jimmy johns for some much needed sustenance.

Now I've been to JJ before and I've had a few great experiences but this time I was a little disappointed. Ordering the Beach club sandwich I found the bread to be dry, a little unusual but meh I plowed on, getting through the sandwich I really found it to be really bland and not to the JJ standards that I had experienced before. 

Maybe it was a off day for JJ and myself but I will try them again but I won't go out of my way when you got quite a few good places in such close proximity!!!!",JlwWHBFT76iSJe5mWIcZ4A,3,2,2,sWFpBDjdx6yN6pED_LssSw

First off, the bread was stale and not like the soft Jimmy John bread that I know. Secondly, I had the tuna which was tasteless and really watery. Most definitely not the best tuna sandwich I've ever had and maybe even the worst. Perhaps the tuna sandwich isn't the way to go for Jimmy's but as far as their quality of food, this location needs to step up their game.",zpnDr3EBaVU8QPNHE3eDbg,2,1,2,BBTejiKenfjdqb0-Ij_inA

It was one of those situations where I left the grocery store and thought, ""well, I have all this food to cook later, but I gotta eat now!"" Enter JJs. 

Seriously, the service at this particular JJs what exactly the way every place ought to be: quick, really friendly staff, and provided me with delicious food in minutes. I ordered the Beach Club, which I am convinced is one of the best sandwiches ever made (like The Bobbie). Everything about the sandwich screams quality: perfectly-baked bread, good amount of turkey, a good serving of avocado... and the vegetables were good, too. 

I try to stay away from sandwich places because you never know what kind of ingredients they're using (the Subway lettuce, for example, is not the business). But with this place? None of that -- it's all good.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,4,2,5,2KYCCdUq97gYnvIaFK5l3g

It probably took about a minute or 2 but that was still faster than any sandwich place I've ever been to. My galpal and I were in quite a rush to get back home because we had some errands to do and were debating really quick whether to try out the firehouse subs or this. When she told me they're known for their speed, I did not hesitate to jump on the bandwagon. 

Here I ordered a Turkey Tom for my mother. We were brought into this vintage diners restaurant and a sweet aroma of deli deliciousness. It cost me roughly $5 which wasn't bad at all. According to my mother, the sandwich was pretty filling, too much mayonaise though so if any of you are watching your diet, better request to have a tad bit of mayo scraped off. Overall, the quality was good, service was fast and workers were accomodating. Will definitely come back to check out their Totally Tuna sandwich next time, per my galpal's recommendation!",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,1,1,4,-85BJepTS2n3X7zMy6Zj8A
4664136,2012-05-23,0,SXfb2X6nTPC-IPhPiIi4Ww,"Firstly, I really do love Jimmy Johns and their sandwiches. The problem is, if you cat actually get one, then what is the point of patronizing the joint. I usually stop in once a week as I have errands to run over there on a regular basis. This is the third time in the last 6 months or so that they are out of bread at between 1 and 1:30 in the afternoon. I wonder how many times they have actually run out. I know the bread is baked fresh, but they can't plan that poorly, can they?  If its a case of them only baking so many loafs for a day and when they are out, thy are out, I'm fine with that. All I ask is that you tell me. That way if I have meetings schedule that will put me there when you don't have bread I can plan accordingly. Not that it will do any good, but I'm going to have to not patronize this JJ and maybe all for the next 60 days as that is truly my only voice.  Maybe they'll miss my money, maybe they won't. I hope the situation is that business is so good they just can't keep up with demand and my non-patronage is a non-factor. Maybe it was the perceived lack of sincerity or maybe had they offered a free or half-off sub the next time I came in. Maybe I'm just having a less than stellar day, although I did make every green light on the way to work today and that was the indicator I things to come. Who knows, but I really wanted a JJ sub today and settled for Carls Jr.which just didn't cut it.",XPNiTbrKL7f0_6L0lrbZlg,1,0,2,9l_uI2LlaBGx3gd92fIIag

I was there a couple of days ago though and was saddened that the turkey tom no longer had alfalfa in it bc of the constant problem with alfalfa recalls. Damn e. coli I tell  ya!

5319729,2014-08-05,4,SXfb2X6nTPC-IPhPiIi4Ww,"If you want a sandwich that'll make your blood pressure go up, this is the place for you. This is the location close to my office and so if I want something quick without having to drive, I end up giving them a call. For the past few years, they've been good at making my blood boil...and I keep giving them a chance. ""Jimmy will change""...NO! Keep dreaming!

Ordering on the phone is quite painful as their order takers can't hear. ""It's too loud in the store"" yet I don't hear background noise. Investing in a good phone might help. When they write your credit card number/ name/  address/ phone number - they can never get it right. 

""We tried calling you multiple times because your credit card won't go through."" It helps if you call the right number and most credit cards have 16 digits. This leads to not having a receipt for you.

There were times I had to wait a long time for a delivery when it's only a 2-minute drive away. ""The driver got lost""...really? GPS for less than half a mile?

However, I do like their sandwiches better than say Quizno's or Subway. I normally get: Bootlegger's Club, Hunter's Club, Turkey Tom. You have the option to just have the meat and bread (Slims) or not have the bread at all (Unwich).",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,8,5,2,u4xOeQ3JbY_1jjPMg_fUlA

Besides, think of the savings you get when you reuse the same soda cup you bought the first time you went in. Be warned though, you may get a bit of a dirty look from the owner for doing so.. Even if you've just plopped down money for two meals from the same place.. 

We were hitting the road back to Los Angeles and since we sandwiched a game of Mini golf between lunch and when we were going to be on the open road, we figured we would take a sandwich for the five hour drive back and when you're looking for good sandwiches, you look to Jimmy John's. 

Even though you think Hawt Dawwwwwgs or deep dish pizzas when you think of Chicago, they should also have another popular item added to their list of great foods to come out of there.. Jimmy John's. 

Really fresh sandwiches that have a good portion of meat and some great combination. Service is great and the food is really really affordable. Subway may make the claim of $5 subs, but you really come through in the pinch and produce some amazing sandwiches. Not to mention all your signs in the place are witty as all hell. 

Though, come on, owner dude. Why the scoffed look when I was refilling my soda? I just dropped a good $30 on your place for both lunch and dinner, within an hour and a half. You can't spare the soda syrup for a long drive back?  Think of it this way, instead of me sitting outside eating my LUNCH sandwich, I went to play indoor mini-golf in the building next to yours before coming back and buying road Dinner.",nj3syiLs3lABLtPVyL0ivA,4,4,4,ksmDENbayR0-4wEu5BiOxw
5500684,2012-10-23,1,SXfb2X6nTPC-IPhPiIi4Ww,"Can I start this review with a little emoesque touch.... I am sad... To say the least. I hear from every direction that jimmy johns is #1, the best, the winner, the best looking, best smelling, moi guapo, the sexiest sandwich this side of the Rio grand and for that I say to you all, I am glad that none of you happened to be my wing man in my younger days. This place was T-T-T-Terrible. Pulling up to this joint I was curious if the recommendations would pay off and at first glance I thought yes it would. I mean pulling up to place that has a bright neon sign that clearly says Free Smells seems comical and like they had something up their sleeves. Open the door and POW you are hit with the smell of Pickles and floor cleaner but I can look past that so I take a quick look at the menu and decide to grab a gargantuan, the wife figured you can go wrong with a BLT and the kids would kick down a turkey and cheese. 

I know that the order sounds pretty ordinary and seems pretty easy to achieve greatness, unfortunately that was not the case. After waiting in the cramped quarters for our sandwiches we sat down to see what the jimmy johns hype is all about and that first bite was like the moment your parents popped your favorite balloon and all the air shot out of it and you felt completely let down. Okay so that might be a little much and if it felt like that then you may want to be checked for daddy issues but I assure you it was not good. 

I was hungry so I dealt with my sandwich but my wife asked me to try her BLT and see if I thought the bacon was no good or something and even though I thought for a second that she was over reacting and in my mind I mumbled, "" come on Hun, bacon is bacon"" as I took a bite I began to scream in my mind, "" What the hell is that, it is definitely not bacon"". so first thing was first she stripped the bacon out of her sandwich and decided to pull a piece of turkey out of the kids sandwich and transform her BLT to a turkey sandwich in hopes for a better experience but the issue was that the turkey sandwich had only one slice of meat and we couldn't just give the kids a bread sandwich now could we. 

I don't want to turn this into a 100% rant but unfortunately to all of you Jimmy Johns Lovers that I know, please warn me before we hand out next time.... I'll grab Subway. I'm sorry was that a low blow, Well sometimes the truth is like a kick in the metaphorical nutts.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,4,2,2,D9acBrKUzkgMRq5_xMLpSw
