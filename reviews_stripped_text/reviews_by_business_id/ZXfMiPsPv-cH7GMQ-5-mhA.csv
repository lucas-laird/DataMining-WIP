The kids love the breakfast pancakes and I love the breakfast sandwich.  My husband gets the steak and eggs for something like $5.  For dinner we usually get the burgers on the buy-one-get-one-free special.  Yes, this place has great specials.  It's a wonderful restaurant for a family on a budget.

64555,2013-06-12,0,ZXfMiPsPv-cH7GMQ-5-mhA,"We were in the area shopping and decided to look for someplace to eat. We really weren't in the mood for burgers, so Red Robin was out. There were lots of places to choose from, but in the end we decided to try someplace new and since it was close to a Starbucks, Montana Meat Company made the list.

It was early in the afternoon so the place was empty. Some people have complained about the smoke smell, but the restaurant seating is in the back of the place totally separated from the bar. We never noticed any smoke where we were sitting. There was only one other booth occupied when we arrived so we were quickly greeted and seated. Our host was friendly and courteous and appeared glad to see us. We think he also doubles as the bartender since that's where he was when we arrived. He took our drink order while we looked over the menu. While we were waiting for the drinks, the waitress showed up and asked what we wanted to drink. Apparently a communications break between the bar staff and the restaurant staff.

Brenda ordered the flat iron steak with steak fries and I had the Montana Rib Eye with a baked potato. While we waited for the food we did our usual check of the establishment. Overall, it is a nice place with a definite cowboy feel to it. The only negative would be that no one dusts the lamp shades. A tap of the finger on them sent dust cascading down. As we waited, more people began to arrive and the wait staff increased as well. It never seemed as though anyone was waiting to be served or checked on, so overall, we'd rate this as better than average service.

The food arrived and it was cooked as ordered, medium for Brenda and medium rare for me. I'm not really sure what's in the ""signature pepper marinade"" that they claim the rib eye is aged in. Although the steak was very tender and tasty, I really didn't notice anything special that the marinade would have imparted. The baked potato was slightly undercooked and a bit firm in the center. However, with all the butter, sour cream, and chives that they supply, it tasted fine. You really can't do much to screw up a baked potato. Brenda's flat iron was also good considering it's a cheaper cut of meat from the shoulder. The steak fries were nothing spectacular but there were enough that neither of us could finish all of them. The food that we got was worth the price considering many restaurants in town would be charging an additional $10 per plate for what we got.

Definitely would return to try some of their burgers or even their breakfast menu.",SHaD3Xf6anwY8hIRoYeDXQ,0,0,4,IhMXq-BunhWH2_Jl-rWbRA

Anyway, we were seated by a nice host who also happened to be our server. The guy took our orders and drinks and was given nice, hot sour dough bread with butter on the side while we waited. My bf ordered a kobe burger and I got grilled salmon...yes I got salmon knowing this place is known for their good burgers and steak. (I recently became pescetarian).  We also got the bacon wrapped scallops everyone was raving about. It didn't take long til we got our food, which was awesome. My bf said his burger was ""amazing"" and had nothing bad to say about it. My salmon, on the other hand, was dry and bland...I removed the bacon on the scallops and it actually wasn't bad. The scallops were big and juicy and we both enjoyed it. They made some kind of sauce for the scallops which I was not a big fan of, but my bf loved it.

The bar area looked pretty busy-maybe for happy hour.  As we were seated the server brought us 2 warm flaky melt-in-your mouth loaves of white Italian bread with butter.  OMG in my mouth!  I am always a big fan of fresh warm bread so that was a good way to start.

The server was nice, not overly friendly but there to do his job. He did check back occasionally to make sure we didn't need anything.  He took our order for dinner and here was our rundown:

*Dad - Blackened salmon with mashed potatoes with a side Caesar salad.  He ate the whole thing and he was stuffed. He said the salmon was so good he couldn't stop eating. LOL

*Mom - Ordered the steak with mashed potatoes.  No complaints from her.

*BF/Me - shared the Caesars Salad and it was really good.

*BF - Cajon pasta with medallion steak.  This is always his favorite only its always very rich.  This time there was way too much sauce.  It was still good but it was just swimming in sauce.  I grabbed a piece of the cheesy toast that it came with (as if I needed any more bread) and it was absolutely horrible!  Not even edible.  It was so salty and I do love my salt but yuck!  He didn't eat any of the bread and rarely does. He says it never looks good.

*Me - Blackened salmon with mashed potatoes.  First off S A L T Y was the theme of the night I guess.  The mashed potatoes were covered with tons of brown gravy-you couldn't even see the potatoes.  The gravy was so salty....maybe if there was a small dallup of gravy it wouldn't seem so overpowering but gollllly.  The salmon was a little dry so I asked for this lemon butter sauce that you have to ask for and it made it a little better.  The whole dish was really salty.  I left about less than half my dinner there.  The salt was just too much.  Oh yeah there were green beans too on there that I didn't eat. 

The bill was about $90 with tip.  As we were walking out BF got suddenly got sick and ran to the bathroom.  Not a good sign if you cant make it out the door right?   Yeah we got our Montana Meats fix for now.  We will be back when we forget this dining experience.  It has been pretty good in the past...",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,6,1,2,jEusSztX_QgT7K-Q3zCJwg

I had the absolute WORST restaurant/bar experience here. My friend and I went to this place, because he highly recommended it. We went there to watch our favorite football team, Team A, and thought it would be a good time. Well, my friend and I usually have the same taste in places, so I agreed. As soon as we walked in, the smell of dirty sewage hit my nose, and I asked my friend, ""don't you smell that""? He said no, so we continued on to the bar. As we sat down in front of one of the TV's that our team on, we were greeted by the bartender, who is also the owner. He asked us what we were going to have to drink. I ordered a Dr. Pepper, my friend a Beer. He mentioned to us that there were a couple of team B fans in the place tonight, as he could see us wearing our team A jerseys. We said ok cool, no worries. We were there to watch the game and root for our team on, nothing more. As our team made some big plays, we clapped and cheered ""yeah"". We then asked the owner for some food menus. We placed our order and continued watching the game. In between plays, we noticed the other fans were at the end of the bar from us. We did not heckle them or even look there way. We were focused on watching the game and talking football amongst ourselves. Our team made another big play, and we clapped again, and yelled ""yeah"". I guess the owner had enough, as he then proceeded over to us and talk to me in a way I have never been talked to before. It went a little like this:
Owner: ""Hey, can you not cheer until the other people leave, they are team B fans""
Me: ""I can't cheer for my team""?
O: ""Out of respect for me, please just don't cheer or clap, until they leave""
M: ""Why""?
O: ""Well I'm the owner, so I can turn the game off. Do you gamble""?
M: ""No, I don't""
O: ""Well that guy (team B fan) has $10,000 on this game, and he's already down $2,000""
M: ""How is that my problem""?
O: ""Please just don't cheer until they leave, that's all i'm asking""
M: ""So I can't cheer for my team for the whole game basically""
O: ""Yes""
M: I point to my soda, ""How much is this""?
O: ""I'll get it if you're going to leave""
M: As I get up from the stool ""Yes I am""""
My friend does the same and we walk out of that sewage plant.

I heard a lot from friends but now that I think of it, they were talking about the food.

It's what you would expect from a bar and grill: the dim lighting, the smell of cigarettes, and soft sound from the televisions in the bar. Upon entering, there wasn't a host/hostess to greet us so my girlfriend and I just stood looking at the Montana memorabilia in the doorway until Mark came to greet us. Just to be sure we came during happy hour and double checked with Mark and it seemed like Mark was new because he wasn't sure. The bartender had to grab the card on the bar table to tell us.

Mark sat us and took our order. I ordered the kobe sliders (what they're famous for) and my girlfriend ordered the peppercorn burger. We waited a little bit, not too long, for the order and there was an extra patty on the peppercorn burger. I thought it was kind of odd when Mark explained he had a new chef and he put an extra patty in the burger. He should've never added it :( My girlfriend seemed disappointed at how plain the peppercorn burger was and double checked with Mark if that's all it came with. Mark tried to appease her query of grilled onions by offering to get some.

""RIGATONI BOLOGNESE 9.95served in a hearty beef and pork marinara sauce.""  ""Served with garlic bread"".
I love bolognese.  Hearty meaty dish with marinara atop pasta.  Super simple.  I'm lactose intolerant (yes, seriously, and not because it's 'trendy'.).  I choose items from menus that I know, that don't contain (soft) cheeses, etc. 

What I received was not a marinara, it was more of a rose sauce (marinara loaded with cream until it's pink).  With melted mozzarella ALL OVER THE DISH.  The garlic bread?  Yeah, also loaded with cheese.  Google ""bolognese"" and you'll find a meaty red sauce; not creamy.  I would have expected a couple dashes of Parmesan (a hard cheese usually with less lactose), and I would not have minded this.  I didn't think I would have to explain to the waitress that I'm medically lactose intolerant and to hold all of the cheese when ordering a bolognese.  I've served tables before; servers don't want to hear your medical issues and life story.

For many people, all this cheese is wonderful news!  For me - a nightmare.  Nothing on the menu states that cheese or cream touches this dish all.  I did not bother to send this back because it was easier to just swap dishes with my hubby than piss off the staff and wait for a new meal.  At least update your menu to note that there is cheese and cream involved here.  Garlic bread should also be changed to CHEESY garlic bread.

I had the Rocky Mountain Burger which was the best burger I've ever had and my girlfriend got Kobe Beef sliders which she hasn't stopped talking about since. However the second time we went I was less impressed, this was on a Saturday. We shared Calamari and it was okay. I tried the jalapeño burger and it was good but I swear it tasted a little fishy. Whoever the chef was on Sunday is a master and should be there all the time. 

  The staff was very nice both times and often came up and asked how we were doing and got us more drinks without us having to ask.

Went yesterday July 4th with my mom and husband to have a nice lunch. They only had one server, the place was almost empty, now I know why.

Service:
- Waiter was very little attentive, we had to look for him constantly an order bread three times. A side note about the bread, it is not complimentary even though it is free for dinner. Why do you not offer it for lunch? It just makes your place look really cheap. I don't mind paying for it if is good, but we were 3 people and they brought 2 small slices, so not very satisfying. I also asked for it with butter and they never brought the butter.
- They had some bad taste rap music as background, which did not fit the environment whatsoever. I saw a couple older people there that I can guarantee you had the same thoughts I did. I wanted to ask the waiter to turn down the volume or change the music but again, I could not find the waiter, and then I just thought ""whatever"".

Food: 
My husband ordered a 20 OZ Rib Eye and I ordered a 20 OZ T Bone to share with my mom. 
Everything was hard and overcooked. I ordered medium well, got it well done.

If you are a cheapskate like myself and usually go to Montana for the hamburger deal, you probably aren't going to get an appetizer. But if you feel like living large, I highly recommend the lamb chops (I guarantee you'll want to lube yourself up with the honey basil sauce) and teriyaki chicken wings. 

The major issue that I have with Montana Meat Company isn't the food or the service. The problem with Montana is that the place flat-out needs cleaning.

As he set the bread down in front of us, the smell of fresh baked bread filled the air. I skipped the butter and tore into a piece and it was amazing.

My 10 OZ sirloin was undercooked and the vegetables were so saturated with oil it literally overflowed to the fries and made the fries so gross I had to drown in ketchup to eat. My daughters steak was over cooked and burnt. My wife's salad was gross with little dressing for the salad. The plate was almost 15 inches wide with a small 1"" cup of dressing. A meat company should be known for cooking meat and making meat. I could have made the meat better if I went to the back and cooked it myself. $16.95 for a sirloin steak that was undercooked and I only ate the medium well areas.  I will not send food back when I cannot see the kitchen so yeah can't see the kitchen and don't trust people. 


I appreciate your response but I'm afraid that I don't see how the General Manager of a restaurant would not know what is going on in his kitchen. Regardless of the circumstances you are held responsible for the quality and service of the restaurant. You cannot pass the blame unto your staff and ask someone to come back and try us again. You should know what is going on in your kitchen and also know what needs to be done to rectify your situation in your KITCHEN. Your apology sounded more generic than actually sincere and also your lack of an answer about what occurred shows you don't really have a concern about customer service and a clue about how to fix it.",oftyCylPKcJWZWFvxEc-PQ,2,0,1,Oi5KhJ3vq08RaWS-juztfA

The mashed potatoes tasted like there was no seasoning and no milk or butter was used to make them. I mean who messes up mashed potatoes? I never got refills on my drinks and the server had to be hunted down to get a new steak knife that had fallen on the floor. The server came back with a fork and butter knife... I ended up just giving up my steak knife as the filet was not the best.

I was surprised to find entrees like Balsamic Glazed Halibut, Lamb Chops, 20 ounce Rib Eyes, and other such tasty things. I decided I would have to come back here again sometime with my girl and give it a go.

Since then my girl and I have been there twice and I went once with a friend to enjoy the menu and the drinks. I have enjoyed the shrimp cocktail, their lamb chops, rib eyes, flat iron steak, and their halibut.

* Classic Shrimp Cocktail: This was very enjoyable for both my girl and I, sweet and juicy jumbo shrimp and one of the best shrimp cocktails I have had in Las Vegas.
* Lamb Chops: While I am generally not a big fan of lamb, these are crazy good and after 11pm you can get 3 lamb chops for $7.95
* Rib Eyes: My girl and I both had the 12-ounce Rib Eye Steaks; this was up there with other good Steak Houses in Las Vegas. The meat was perfect medium rare for me and medium for my girl.
* Macadamia Crusted Alaskan Halibut with a balsamic glaze: I ordered this when my girl tried the flat iron steak, and while it was good, fresh and cooked right, I to be honest was jealous of my girls flat iron steak ;p
* Flat Iron Steak: So I was saying I was jealous of my girls flat iron steak and it was very nommy had a great sear and again cooked how she wanted it.

(I have noted that the grill person just rocks it all together as anything grilled here taste great so far.)

The burger was very good, a little more well-done than the medium I'd asked for.  Hubby got the rarer one, which is a shame.  He's been well-trained to know enough not to order his meat cooked to DEAD when he's in my company (yeah, yeah, I know you're supposed to eat burgers well-done, but you pays yer money and takes yer chances).

And, I honestly had no desire to ever try it except that my husband says ""We should try that place"" EVERY single time we go by, and I wanted him to stop.

So, we finally tried it one afternoon because he read online that they do BOGO burgers. I was a little put off because when you walk in the stench of smoke hits you like a ton of bricks. Like, worse than ANY casino anywhere. I am an ex smoker, and even when I did smoke...I didn't like it with my food. Honestly, if it weren't for this one thing I would have gone up to 5 stars. Anyway, bar is to the right and dining room is to the left. So, once you go to the left and are seated you can kinda get past the smoke issue.

The service is excellent, but I have only ever gone in the afternoon when it isn't very busy anyway. They stay on top of drink refills which is a big deal for me, and everything is always really prompt (like the check).

Both times I have gone we ordered burgers. I always get the the Rocky Mountain Bacon Burger. My husband has tried the Peppercorn Burger and the Spicy Jalepeno Burger. Mine was excellent. The bacon was crispy, cheese was melted, and the onion ring is big & crispy. Fries are really hot. My husband preferred the Jalepeno over the Peppercorn. The jalepenos were grilled and the peppercorn has a gravy (and lots of it) poured over. 

What I like best about their burgers is that you can taste the charbroiledness...its like you would get at home on a grill, but better. And, WAY better than any fast food place tries to promise.

It's not like it was a busy day I understand besides us 8 guys maybe 4 or 5 other people. So we were honestly kinda baffled by what he had said and he responded with if we don't shut up he will kick us out. We honestly were not being rude what so ever but he insisted we leave because as I quote ""this ain't fuckin Applebee's"" and he's probably right because we would have never been treated like this.

5523418,2016-10-02,0,ZXfMiPsPv-cH7GMQ-5-mhA,"Tried this place tonight - wasn't bad! We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip app, ribeye steak, with a loaded baked potato & veggies. Note, there is no soup/salad option for the steak, by we did get a loaf of bread in a basket. The dip could have cooked a bit more as it didn't have that crisp cooked cheese top. When the runner brought our meal out it was missing the loaded baked potato. Rather than leave the meal he took the entire plate back to get the potato & it took him about 10 minutes to come back. Sending food back makes me very nervous so I didn't eat much. Honey enjoyed the steak and potatoes. Green beans were cooked with red bell peppers so they had that flavoring. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best service.",n1cGg7NpJspFPUcyYO4lzw,2,0,2,IYLfOygQT8tM3QOHQGC6gg

We were hoping this would become our new neighborhood steakhouse, but overall we were very disappointed.",mjYus-iLdgubSWHw8m5W7w,0,0,1,MHd_67tGdce6OHeDh453Dg

We were there for a very long time on both visits. But overall good experience and we'll be going back to try more menu items.",0HuYmSeNfDwBJGHmTJa8rg,0,0,4,exqL_Onb2_J2UCMWCPASag
5583154,2014-11-17,1,ZXfMiPsPv-cH7GMQ-5-mhA,"Met up with some friends for Sunday lunch.  They serve breakfast and lunch menus.
I ordered the Montana Steak Sandwich.  What I received was essentially 3 small pieces of steak smothered in mushroom sauce with button mushrooms on top of thick toast and a plate full of steak fries.  The steak was prepared well but the menu description did not fit what I received, in fact several people at the table commented on that.  

My daughter ordered the Ravioli which came swimming in a buttery cream like sauce.  Let me give MMC a little advice.  Over saucing does not compensate for small portions of food, lack of quality ingredients or make the plate look more appetizing.  She enjoyed the ravioli's which were, when the sauce was dripped off, pretty tasty.  The garlic toast it came with was pretty lame.  

The rest of the group enjoyed their entrees and the breakfast plate looked good.

Other than being overly sauced and lacking in actual entree portion size once you got through the sauce, the food was well prepared and tasty.

Not really a place I would return to but decent for a 24 hour bar/steakhouse.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,5,1,3,3CMS3j7e-a-M8xbYwTwxbg

The only efficient thing with the service was the hostess who promptly sat us and took our drink orders. Everything went downhill from there. The staff was friendly, but couldn't grasp simple requests and got our order wrong. We had to ask for them to bring bread to the table (while they were bringing it to the tables around us, even though we were seated first and had our order in). The quality of the food doesn't seem to be as good as it was the last time we were here (about 6 months ago) as well. It's going to be a while before we go back.",QHa2EDyNHKE-nA7wyzXPmw,1,0,2,WEmbLtne964xNLjltQflGA

They have 5 wings that come with fries for $5.99 or 3 tenders with fries for $4.99. I ended up going with the tenders covered in their sweet and spicy sriracha sauce and my beau did the same with korean sauce. 

This is strictly a review for sitting in bar area to get food, late after 11pm. Service was meh, but expected. Pepsi products here, which to my surprise came out tasting decent from bar spout. Food came out hot with two giant dishes of ranch for each plate! Probably because they didn't want to come back out. The food was fresh and delicious that I'd come back here again.",iMDnsKqcixMnYwH85L8Nqg,0,0,4,__m6l8cpR19hbztEVH4Sww

I never did put the salad dressing on it since the flavor of the salad was awesome with out it. And they have moose drool on tap so my husband was happy since you cannot find it at a restaurant out here. They have a kids menu and the prices for those meals were fantastic. I really can't say enough about this place! Will definitely come back soon.",MWN3G__v79Cd8nBnwToEAg,0,0,5,ONkmuqoVkfh6qbZqOAVaNQ

I would say that this place has to be the best place I have come to in the past month verses anywhere I have been. The hospitality and the food is way above and beyond! Eric the owner and who even works at his establishment is awesome! Really gives you the east coast feeling of a mom and pop restaurant with the little things as just remembering your name. If I wasn't moving next week this would be my regular bar for sure! 

Great job with your restaurant and happy 13th anniversary to you sir! Hats off! And let's go YANKEES!",lYp7ckeLslPhHSsdt7xnhQ,1,0,5,UYtcBPODuGgNyRue5S8Ptw
