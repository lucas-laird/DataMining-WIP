81105,2013-06-30,1,yjME88ri8wpBDm6i0xoi9Q,"This brand-new remodeled restaurant just opened the other day. It's a 24 hour restaurant, open 24 hours, and serves classic but unique American food! 

Everything on their menu sounded fantastic! They had simple yet delicious dishes like eggs and sausages and really interesting dishes like red velvet pancakes! 

I had the Lobster Benedict, and it was absolutely amazing! I never even had eggs Benedict before, so I was completely in shock when I saw my dish. First of all the serving size was HUGE. It was a huge buttery toasted bread topped off with really big delicious & tender lobster claws, two perfectly poached eggs, and this creamy light hollandaise sauce! It also came with a side of fresh, garlic seasoned potatoes. It was absolutely delicious! 

Their menu had a range of prices generally from $6 to $24. $24 was the highest price I saw on their menu (at least from what I remember). My lobster Benedict was $21, but it was completely worth it! It was so good, and the portion sizes were so big that I couldn't even finish everything! 

I had a taste of my friend's blueberry pancake that she ordered, and it was just as amazing (but not as great as mine! ;] ). It was these big 4 layered pancake stuffed with fresh blueberries and topped off with almonds and a light maple syrup. So yummy~ :3 

The service was absolutely fantastic! Everyone was so friendly and catered to every one of our needs. Our server, Dean, was really nice. We had a really nice conversation with him. 

This is a really nice quiet restaurant to dine in. It's a nice place to get away from the loud and busy commotions of the casino and the strip. It kind of has this home-y feeling which I love because you can sit down, relax, and chat with your friends. Totally recommend it!",jKwn6UYaJXIigu2hp0ylKw,1,1,5,_9i3Z0o_tbGW8eWXyFjXWg

107555,2013-10-30,0,yjME88ri8wpBDm6i0xoi9Q,"For Saturday morning, my girlfriends and I went to Avenue 24 after much walking and deliberating. Avenue 24 is a large food place within MGM Grand - I think it's busy because no one is up before lunchtime if you're truly experiencing Vegas, or for those who are, are either nursing hangovers with pots of coffee or have been standing in line for the buffet since 7am. I personally would've liked to not eat and just drink coffee in the middle of the casino, but there are others who apparently need food to survive, so here is where we went. Mind you, we're all working on 5 hours sleep after bar hopping the night before. 

The food was okay - you got a lot for your money, though you'd better, the price you pay! I'm from Los Angeles - I'll pay $5 for a muffin, as long as it's good. This place...did our group well. A large booth in the back, plenty of juices, waters and coffee. Somewhat okay service, but it was before noon, so I imagine they're busy (though in my opinion, one should know that, so plan accordingly). I wouldn't go back here, on my own in the future. I don't do buffets either, so keep that in mind.",vlKVmCHhTY5J-I8e2hB7qg,0,0,2,qzU2dmHqkmn_mVrLO9z9eg

It is not mixed into the skillet but placed on top and it tasted like it was microwaved!! The potatoes were hard and the edges chewy, meaning they weren't fresh. I couldn't taste the potato! How could you mess up on potatoes?? Good thing the eggs themselves were fine.

For a ~$15 skillet, I deserved wayyyyy better. Next time I'm sticking with Denny's. The wait time was also at least 20 minutes after ordering.

On the plus side, the pancakes were decent. Get those, but don't expect flavored pancakes to come with much flavor. Ours didn't.

Service was friendly and the place was clean. Coffee was excellent.

Went to the cafe early to beat the rush and was told by the hostess I would have to wait 10-15 min, in the long line , when the restaurant is almost completely empty. She said she did not have a person to serve at the empty tables. I guess in the largest hotel they don't care much about the guest. When I was sat I still waited for service as I looked around at the few employees trying to run around trying to serve and was sad to watch. My server was friendly but everyone in that place looks overwhelmed.  The food was not good for the price they charge and took almost 25 minutes for egg dishes. That was on top of ALL THE TIME I WAITED BEFORE. ALMOST 1 HOUR FOR A SIMPLE BREAKFAST. If you charge $20 for eggs and $5 for coffee you should at least have the service to back it up. Did not see manager the whole time until I asked to speak to one.Took her a few minutes to come out. I talked to the manager Martha about the service or lack of and that the food was cold she gave me an apology but did not seem to care too much and brushed me off and walked away to the back were she came I guess she was not concerned with how the place runs I don't know who is running the MGM cafe but they should be ashamed. Walked by the next day around lunch time and the line was out to the casino again and you can see how empty the place is. The management  should care more about the guests but I guess they prefer empty tables and making people not want to come back.

It was Thanksgiving Day, and I had planned on going to a buffet; however, apparently so did the entire tourist population of Las Vegas.  We tried the Wynn, Wicked Spoon, Rio, Studio M. All had waits of greater than 2.5 hours.  We even waited in line at the Rio for about 30 minutes, before we decided to give up our spot.

We were going to search off the strip; however, most things were closed.  We ended up back at our hotel, the MGM Grand.  We noticed that Avenue 24 wasn't that busy. We also noticed that you could order off the regular menu or do the Thanksgiving Pre-Fixe for just $26.00 per person.  We did the Thanksgiving meal, which we weren't expecting to be that good; however, it was EXCELLENT!!!

We started with a delicious bowl of Butternut Squash soup with some cinnamon sauce on top.  Then the main entree was a generous portion of good turkey with all the trimmings including stuffing, sweet potato casserole, green beans and cranberry sauce.  For dessert, we got some mini pumpkin pies.

They had a dry crumble but had a rich taste. The icing was also cinnamon roll icing. And YES I expected more bc I've been to restaurants that have had red velvet pancakes or waffles and they took time out to provide a good ""icing"" or cream. The egg whites were blah and I should have out cheese on them. The chicken sausage was good though. The hash browns were just hash browns nothing special ..

While staying at the MGM during CES, my husband and I went to this place twice out of pure convenience (ie, it was in the same hotel as the one we were staying at and it was easy to eat there and then get on the monorail to CES). We didn't go there twice because it was ""so good"" it was just easy LOL.

With that said, the first time we went it was just the 2 of us. I ordered Huevos Rancheros with scrambled eggs and my husband ordered Eggs Benedict. I was unimpressed. First of all the food took like 35 minutes to get to us and the service wasn't great. I was out of my drink frequently. Yes, they were busy, but still if I'm paying full price I expect the establishment to figure out how to get me served whether they're busy or not...just sayin'. It's not like they didn't know CES was this week and that Vegas wouldn't be ridiculously busy...scheduling people!

The skillet wasn't great. The eggs had not been cooked long enough and they were runny in spots...so I had to just skip that part (I don't do runny egg). My husband said the eggs benedict were average at best. 

The second time we went was because we were going home that morning and just wanted to make it easy and eat there. Our friends went with us this time as they had seen all the posters all over the casino with pictures of the red velvet pancakes. That's what they ordered and they said they were REALLY sweet for a breakfast and between the 2 of them, could not finish them. They also said the hash browns were very salty.

I ordered the blueberry nut pancakes this time and enjoyed them much more than the skillet. They were very good. My husband ordered the white chocolate berry french toast. While he enjoyed the meal, there was NO white chocolate anywhere to be found which was interesting since it was literally called ""white chocolate french toast"" LOL

The service was also better the second time. It still took a while to get the food, but our waitress was better.

Cons
Poor customer service

My husband and I wanted to get breakfast before going to Wet Republic so we came by here so we could leave quickly. Oh boy was that a fail. Our waitress was slower than molasses. We waited forever for her: to bring us water (never gave us any refill), to take our order, bring our order, bring the check and take out box! She was also incredibly rude (probably because we look young). I asked if I could substitute eggs for extra hash browns for a meal and she said it wasn't possible. So I just got the fruit and walnut pancakes to keep it simple. My husband did the create your own omelette, and she criticized him for his choices....like seriously? It's his breakfast why do you care?

Fortunately my pancakes were great, but his omelette looked pitiful...you spend so much money on it for it to look like they threw everything in sloppy.

When we were finishing up we tried to flag our waitress down to get a box and our check because we had to leave to make it on time to check into Wet Republic. She acted like she couldn't see us. When she finally came over and gave us our bill, she made us wait over 10 minutes to give me back my card and my copy of the receipt.

Yes I know, it's in Vegas and Vegas is expensive. But the Denny's style menu (breakfast lunch and dinner all day) just shouldn't be that much. 
After much debate between the make-your-own omelette or the french dip... I went with the french dip.
It was big. Maybe too big. I'd almost describe it as I had some bread with my meat. The sandwich itself wasn't bad. It was soaking wet with grease which was disappointing, but the quality was pretty good. The sauce (they do it with gravy instead of au jus) was waaaay too salty. Had they toned it down on the salt, it would have been a lot better. The saving grace were the fries. They were really quite good. 
It's the noise level got a little obnoxious. I know its Vegas, but between the casino and the amount of employees yelling across the restaurant, it was a little much.
With the big menu and the convenience of being located in MGM, it may be worth a shot. However, get out your wallets... my french dip was $20. Ouch.",sWU5xarXp1AnfnBwcego9A,1,0,2,-wZa3bEm0JPk81N9nS3h9w

It is not something you walk half of Vegas to try. Just a sit down type eatery located on the main casino floor in MGM next to a Starbucks, and on the way towards the KA' Theatre. 

The food is typical breakfast and lunch fare, mostly eggs, omelets, pancakes, sandwiches, salads, etc.  It really isn't the greatest food either, but after days of partying, walking, shopping, and gambling...any chance you get to sit down and eat eggs, bacon, and toast is probably a decent experience. 

Service is surprisingly fast, and rather attentive. We drew Jose on the go around and he was friendly, fast, and thorough.

4746231,2016-12-03,3,yjME88ri8wpBDm6i0xoi9Q,"At the end of our Las Vegas vacation, the morning before the car trip back home, our merry band was hungry for breakfast.  The choice needed to be made whether to wander far from the hotel to a neighboring restaurant or find a diner inside the casino.  With time a factor and checking out with a carful of luggage still needing to be done, we decided to stay close to 'home' and we paraded down into the Avenue Cafe.

The staff is nice enough, the room itself is clean and well managed, as far as this review goes, the location and people are not the problem.  A quick look at the menu, however, begins to raise a few eyebrows as we made our order.

Already having a pretzel earlier, I opted for something simple and small, getting an Assorted Fruit Cup and a Green Machine smoothie to go with it.  The fruit cup, as noted, was small, maybe a bit more than half a handful of cantaloupe, pineapple, watermelon, and honeydew.  The fruit was sweet, fresh, with a nice texture, just a bit disappointing / underwhelming at a cost of $8.  The smoothie itself was Naked Juice brand; you can tell this, not just because of the taste, but also because it was named as such on the menu next to a $7 price tag.

That's right, Avenue Cafe sells a small glass of Green Machine Naked Juice for more than an entire two quart jug of it at the store.

My beloved had the USDA New York Strip & Eggs.  It was cooked nicely, with a nice grilling on both sides, but the meat itself was not the best of cuts as many bites were chewy with tendon and gristle.  She didn't care for the Whiskey Steak Sauce, using it sparingly before pushing it away.  Her eggs and hash browns were average, nothing too special, and by the end she proclaimed that her favorite part of her breakfast was the wheat toast.

Our son had the Steel-Cut Oatmeal.  It came with brown sugar, raisins, and a small jug of milk to help make it palatable.  After a healthy spoonful in the sugar, he ate about half of it, drinking a bit of the milk, and then eating all of his raisins.  Like most oatmeals, it came down to more of the doctoring up than anything else.

But, that leads me to my mother and her Eggs Benedict.  First, the eggs themselves were well cooked, poached nicely.  But, the muffin beneath was under toasted, sogging very easily.  Last, the ham between was small, a thin cut, and barely there as the Avenue Cafe tried to hide it all beneath two ladles too much of their hollandaise sauce.  All in all, the taste was slightly subpar and it was still a bad presentation of a proper Eggs Benedict.

Now, I know that most of these qualms, particularly in reference to pricing, can be written off as, ""we're in Vegas!""  I understand that a small bottle of coke is going to cost $4 in a vending machine and you're going to expect higher prices than normal at any restaurant.  But, it doesn't change the fact that you should get some value for the cost.  When you're paying so much for the privilege of having someone pour a premade smoothie out of a bottle or to make a bad steak / eggs benedict, you either expect a cheaper cost to account for the quality of what you get or a little bit more effort in the technique or style.  You could also try passing it off as Thanksgiving morning and that none of the staff wants to be there, but then you have the trade off of people coming in for the special occasion of a family holiday and the ultimate disappointment is made all that much greater.

Whatever the excuse, breakfast sucked on a multitude of levels.  No, I'm not expecting a small cup of fruit to blow my mind, but it shouldn't piss me off either.  If I had much looser standards as for what constitutes a 1 Star of 5 Star review, this would definitely be on the bottom of the heap.  But, with that saved for the truly horrendous or places worthy of extreme mockery, this place ranks as a very low 2 Stars in my book.",lN7NysaTcbI2VCRub7kYOw,4,3,2,SdQI-svtAGtMyLJidY_Teg

Avenue Cafe provides such an experience. I ate here twice for lunch on my trip. This is strictly my opinion but their lunch menu did not have alot of things that seemed appetizing to me so both times I ordered the grilled cheese dip. Which is a grilled cheese sandwich with a tomato bisque soup for dipping.  Let's just say I ordered it both times because it was that good! The grilled cheese sandwich was great with lots of melted cheese. The tomato bisque was perfect. I am not normally a fan of tomato bisque but this was perfect. The tomato flavor was just right. Not at all overbearing. It was hot and creamy and made a perfect dip. I may make this myself in the future. The first time I was offered a choice between coleslaw and fries for a side and I chose the coleslaw. Opps, because it was flavorless. Nothing but chopped up cabbage and not much else. I took one bite and was done. Thank goodness the grilled cheese and the large dill pickle was enough. The second time around I was not offered a choice and ended up with the fries and since I am not a fan of fries anyways (I like very few place's fries) it was no surprise that when I tried these I was not impressed. But again the sandwich and the pickle are more than enough.

 The prices are typical Vegas in my eyes. Anything you get the price will be inflated in Vegas so my price standards for the Las Vegas Strip are different than most other places. For Vegas I thought the prices were reasonable. The portions are large so you do get some bang for your buck. 

Customer service both times were excellent. My first visit my server Jose was so sweet. He made me feel very welcome. He watched over me and I was well taken care of. i was alone so I sat in the bar area and was served there and he talked to me and made an effort to have a conversation. The second time I sat in the bar area as well and the waitress was very sweet as well. I cannot for the life of me remember her name but she was great. Both times I felt very welcome and each time I had what I needed. 

I enjoyed this restaurant and I will be back for the same dish next time I want some lunch in Vegas. Yes it was that good. My only real issues were the coleslaw and the fact that they are not open all day like I feel these cafes should be. They are open for breakfast and lunch only. I hear they used to be 24 hours and it is most unfortunate that they are not anymore.

I ordered a bacon cheese burger medium rare and Chris ordered chicken fingers and fries. About forty minutes later my burger came out, and a minute or two after that Chris' chicken fingers came out. His chicken fingers were so badly over fried they were inedible! They were hard and dry. the french fries ironically, were soggy and cold.  My burger was on par with a basic diner-The meat itself had turned so the color was not right but, I do believe they cooked it medium rare. It was very juicy and not too charred. He forgot the bacon on my burger which was probably better off the burger was pouring grease. We saw our waiter twice when he took the order and when he dropped the check so there was no opportunity to complain. I felt so bad watching Chris crunch on his gross chicken fingers.

First off, I recommend you get Avenue 24 to go instead of room service.  We actually looked first at the room service menu, and it was crazy expensive, even for room service in Las Vegas on the strip.  So, we checked out the menu for Avenue 24 online.  The scrambles and omelets were approximately half the price that they were on the room service menu.  The place is close to the Grand Tower elevators, so it's easy and quick to get to.  Also, they provided plastic utensils, napkins, and plenty of condiments.  Were we ever to stay at MGM Grand again, we absolutely would get Avenue 24 to go instead of getting room service.

I had the Avenue 24 scramble, which is eggs with ham, bacon, sausage, a lot of Tillamook cheddar, crispy potatoes and chive sour cream.  This is an enormous scramble, easily shareable.  The crispy potatoes were in every bite and worked very well with the cheddar.  But, the thing that tied it all together is the flavor from the chive sour cream.  It gives a faint chive flavor throughout and the sour cream adds a nice creaminess to the eggs.  I would absolutely get this dish again, every bite had every flavor.  

The wife had the corned beef and eggs, which is another enormous breakfast.  It's made with large chunks of tender corned beef, and there are a lot of them.  The dish was seasoned well.  She would order it again.

When I went to pick up the food I sat in the bar area, which was large and had TVs.  Service was quick, they told me on the phone it would be about 15 minutes to get my food and it was.  This is a great addition to MGM Grand and we would definitely return.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,3,1,4,qtvqTLpdjBUtJsTzBfaAxA

The food was decent: eggs were done ok, sausage was fine, toast was good. The hash browns, however, arrived in a sort of ""brick"" and were greasy and rather tasteless.  I presume they came frozen in that shape and had just been tossed in the deep fryer. Coffee was ok and they left the carafe.  

The one major negative I must mention is that I didn't realize how expensive the coffee was until we got the bill.  $3.95 per cup for coffee!

5168069,2017-05-22,0,yjME88ri8wpBDm6i0xoi9Q,"Warning - honest review by a professional!!!

Credentials for posting this review:  My wife and I have 25 years collectively in the food/hospitality realm. We spend ~$35,000 per year dining out. Together we can enjoy a simple burger to a multi course dining experience. From grab-n-go, to fast-casual, to fine dining, we can appreciate each for what they are.  Hence, we believe we are well qualified to make this review. 

Food: Negative. If I was to place a star rating on the food in would be firmly in the 2 stars. It was not terrible, but you can tell that there is absolutely no love in this food. The ingredients have been frozen, bagged, and prepared far ahead of time in an effort to maximize efficiency and profits. Quite bluntly, it is dated and in hospice just like the hotel's accommodations and decor. 

Service: The saving grace of this establishment is the server Russ and the manager Maria. Without these two people, this would be a 2 star review. My wife and I walked in needing a quick bite and coffee. We expected to get in and get out with calories in our bellies and caffeine in our blood. However, we were met by Russ who greeted us cheerfully with a smile. This immediately made us feel welcomed and valued. Seeing that my energy was a bit groggy, he immediately asked if I wanted some coffee or a latte. He even gracefully ""upsold"" a shot of kahlua and informed me of the all-day cocktail menu (even though I declined.) His knowledge of the menu and quick responses showed his level of expertise and EQ. Throughout the entire dining experience he was attentive, without being overbearing, and did so flawlessly. If the food was anywhere close to the quality of the service, this would be a 5-star review. I settled on 4-stars because bad food can be forgiven (for the time being), but bad service cannot. Bad food comes from the priorities of the owners. Band services comes from bad management. 

I do not normally spent this much time and though typing a review (especially when I have tons of work to do) but because believe thoroughly comments can drive positive change, I decided to speak with a manager. Maria (manager) came by and I gave her my feedback and asked for the GM's card, which I will be sending this review to as well. 

If this establishment prioritizes profits, the food with not change. If they care more about their bottom line, they will simply ignore this review. However, if they (and they is a loaded word because sometimes it is beyond the management's control) have the ability to raise beyond the day-to-day and better themselves and the experience of their guests, then there is hope. What is needed is a concept change; a complete makeover. Additionally, management hopefully recognized people like Russ and invests in his advancement in their company. 

I do believe one person can make a difference. If you end up dining at this establishment, please feel free to post updated reviews. Also, I'd recommend asking to be in Russ' section...

We ate here twice for breakfast, as they are only open until 2pm. I think my favorite item was the hash browns! They were so different and flavorful. I appreciated the servers working with me by opting for no meat and substituting for hash browns. They offered a different daily pancake, which all sounded more like dessert. I tried the red velvet pancakes one day, which turned out to look more like mini cakes for breakfast. I could only eat one, but if you're down with dessert like items for breakfast this might be for you. I also built my own omelet on another trip which was very filling.

Ordered a grilled chicken egg scrambler ($17.00) that came with sauteed vegetables including two types of squash, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and red skinned potatoes.

I thought I was getting these big prices of French toast and theses little Ice cube shaped things come out. It was good ( made with cornflakes so it can a good crunch) just felt more like an appetizer than a main dish.

Very 'meh' pancakes and the GROSSEST biscuits and gravy I have EVER had. Okay eggs and okay hashbrowns. Over all a very poor breakfast that ended up to be about 50 dollars. Not worth it at all.

The wait was short and the menu was accommodating. As we placed our orders we mentioned to the waiter that my husband was gluten and lactose intolerant and cannot eat any cheese/milk/wheat products. 

10 or so minutes later our food comes out and looks amazing! I ordered the pancakes with apples and my husband ordered the scrambled eggs with bacon and hash browns. He takes a few bites and comments on how tasty the food is and just as salty as he likes it as if there is cheddar cheese in the eggs which he goes onto finding a huge chunk of cheese in his food... takes another 10 minutes to get the attention of a waiter and another 15 until he offers to replace his food. In the meantime we found the manager who promptly disappeared into the kitchen for 15 minutes or so to talk to the kitchen staff (I assume).

When the manager came back, he apologized for the mistake and offered to comp our food and replace the dishes we ordered. My husband ordered a new dish and while we are waiting the original order he had, this time without cheese came to the table... We told the waiter he'll just have that and to cancel the new order before any more food is wasted.

For a city built on service, the actual service has been nothing but dis appointing...

I just hope people with worse sensitivities do not get affected by receiving dishes that can be detrimental to their health. We were lucky he only took a couple of bites and realized the mistake.",PoDa9_c1Z0nk2dYtsWcKCQ,2,2,2,3cCz-bAt0XzHN7QdzTMFFQ

Seated at a very comfortable half round booth. Given menus and info about their daily pancake by our escort...then it was 10 or so minutes before any waiter acknowledged us. He offered mimosas & bloody mary's, we opted for tap water since it was lunch time. 

Upon returning with water we placed our orders for two Cobb Salads. Then we waited, waited and waited. Finally a lady who appeared to be a manager asked how everything was going and we said we have been waiting quite a while for two salads. She said she would check on them and they arrived shortly after that ...total time between ordering and arrival, 40 minutes. 

The salads were excellent and plentiful.  We did ask for bread and our waiter told us they didn't have bread but had crackers, which never came.  Too bad the service/kitchen is so slow because our salads were really good (fresh and plentiful).

Plus, it took forever for our food to arrive, and by the time it did, my husband's benedict was cold.  The waiter was kind of enough to have it sent back and apologized.

Surprisingly our food was pretty tasty given the over priced items. Wouldn't come back again because of the prices, but will admit the food was good. Chilaquiles had a good crunch covered in a red sauce with two eggs made your way. Huevos rancheros tasted very similar to the chilaquiles, but had black beans, bell peppers and onions.

The bar has a couple of TVs, nice shelves and lighting that displays the drinks and a good view of the casino area.    

I have mixed feelings about the customer service because some of the bartenders were friendly and checked on us often.  Other bartenders seemed uptight and it was apparent they didn't enjoy their job.  Despite the service, they have pretty good happy hour specials and their nachos are yummy!

Since I am trying to stay true to my Atkins diet, I ordered the eggs Benedict, and asked for an extra poached egg in place of the English muffin. I asked my waitress if she would ask if they could do a substitution. Her reply? No. 

I asked, ""No, you won't ask if they will substitute?"" And she said no, uhh, yes, I can ask, but they won't substitute. Oh wait, there's my manager now. I will ask her.

The manager told her to tell me that they would not substitute, and if I wanted an extra egg it was going to be an additional $2.50 per extra egg. 

Since I am paying $15 for the eggs Benedict, it seems excessive to charge so much money to remove one of the main components and swap it for a cheap component. ""Hey, could you remove the expensive two pieces of muffin and replace it with ONE poached egg?"" 

Note to self; MGM management who oversees the Avenue Cafe gives not one hoot about customer service. My tip today? Stay away. Spend your money with the rude Starbucks baristas next door instead.",poFvh8-zwNoJFwvJ_wQGDA,2,0,1,AlDxGauG6Pm6Gow-4VqQiA

The only good part about the place is the service. Our waiter was really nice and friendly. Everything else pretty much sucked. First of, I had wanted to order a salad but I just couldn't fork out $17 for a caesar or garden salad. Some things on the menu are more reasonably priced for the type of dish but be prepared to spend at least $20 or more per person.

We waited for our food for almost 30 minutes, which created a huge problem because we had a guestlist that was closing at Wet Republic. We ended up having only 10 minutes to eat before we had to rush out because it took the food so much longer than we expected to come out.

The taste left a lot to be desired. We had the skillet hash with green sauce and the short ribs fries. They both sound good in theory but both came out less than average at best. The hash didn't have good flavor and was overly salty. The fries didn't have enough topping and the short ribs also didn't taste like much.

With so many great places to eat in Vegas, I would highly recommend skipping this. MGM has a sandwich shop that's supposed to be good and from the looks of it, the service is a lot faster.",9lXgNWJQbGO6Qpj_ZCBnkg,6,5,2,ERsiwAJfbIyadiEw48I3og

Decor: Modern, nice, and clean. A few tables for larger parties. Too bad this was the only positive thing I can find. All looks and no substance.

Food: 
1) Braised rib skillet - The eggs were overly cooked. The braised ribs were tender but had no flavor in them. Even when it was mixed with everything. Even adding a bunch of salt, pepper, and hot sauce didn't improve my appetite for this dish.
2) Breakfast burrito enchilada style - This dish was a little better than the braised rib, but a little better than a 0 is still terrible. You can make a simple breakfast burrito delicious, but somehow they messed it up. Though it was doused in sauce, it felt dry. The one thing I liked was the crispiness of the potatoes.
