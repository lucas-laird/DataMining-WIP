From the cashier cleaning out the grill finally taking my order to the lack of acknowledgement about my order to the no thank you to no offer to get my chips or free dessert I have never experienced this at caps. 
Oh and I gave all my change of $1.xx as a tip with zero recognition?  I ordered fries but was told that it would be more than 15 minutes before I could hope to have any. So switched to chips. The selection of kids lunch bag 1 oz chips was small. 

Then the loaded everything request was ignored, one slice of ""meat"" one slice of tomato in each side of a 12 inch and very little lettuce and NOTHING else. What does loaded mean anyhow?

The sandwich was dry. 

The price went up since last time. My $9.49 12 inch sandwich to me was valued at 3.99 I could find at 7-11. No joke. 

My last visit was met with a 8"" veggie coming to my wife with turkey meat. Wouldn't think to ask about being faked out with real turkey. My wife has been vegetarian for years. But due to lighting and a cold she ate some of it. Was told when we brought it to the attention of staff that she ate most of it so what did we expect?  Upon my notifying them of their mistake and my expectation to replace it they did after the staff said not to ever expect that they would replace it again after she ate it. 

I'm disappointed caps,  I suppose my many previous visits will not be met by future visits after two very negative experiences.   Seriously?  You want to pay how much?  Yeah, no there's lots of other choices at gvr. Might see caps go the same path as the wrap place and the villa pizza place soon.",w3M9BlZdqTwbE1wK-ptHmg,0,0,1,wyWqBFHX7_j27Q09vsjxbw

Why isnt he food as good here?? Maybe because I can't get over the terrible customer service I've received all three times!!! The customer service is AWFUL. Not to mention the person making my sandwich WITH GLOVES ON, answered the phone, WITH GLOVES ON, hung up, and continued making my sandwich with the same gloves on. 
I ordered two sandwiches
After telling the guy I wanted everything listed on the menu on the sandwhich, he literally put NOTHING on it. So I got back up to the counter to ask for a side of mayo, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, etc, it takes him over 5 minutes to prepare everything and then tells me ""I'm not supposed to use these containers for sides so....."" 
Then, he just completely forgot to make the 2nd sandwich, which left my kids waiting another 10 min. I should probably mention, IT WAS DEAD. Nobody else in line. 
I could go on 5 more paragraphs about the last experience . Like seriously management, Do something about this location, you've gotta know it sucks and until you revamp this location, I will not be coming back and I will also be warning my friends.

My suggestion, ask for a little extra coleslaw :)

One the cook and the other a cashier.

He said he was new General Manager and I believe his name was Mark. Because of my disappointment in not having the veggie turkey he offered me free chips and a free drink. He also said he would check with his sister stores and try to get the veggie turkey in. I appreciate when people care about vegetarian options even though they themselves aren't vegetarian.

 Pastrami was Okay.  I think what saved it was the coleslaw and I'm pretty sure I tasted some Swiss cheese.

I don't know what it is about Bobbies, but its a favorite of mine.  Thankgiving leftover sandwiches is one of the things I look to the holidays though I want and can eat this year round- this is where Capriotti's fills that gap for me. Sometimes I get the Cole Turkey or Capastrami, but Bobbies are usually it for me. 

Just a note that this location does not do the large 20inch subs. Only small and medium sized so XL appetites may be let down by that. Prices I think are the same so I don't think there is casino inflation (am I jaded by the strip to think all of them will inflate?).

I've had Capriotti's twice - once at a party and again last night (8/24/11)  at this location with my friend Jerry J. after we got off work. He got a meatball marinara sandwich and I got a small Bobbie. Flavorless. If there was some sort of gravy, it would offset the dryness of this sandwich. It's seriously missing some component that would blow this sandwich out of the water. There's a reason that we don't eat Thanksgiving dinner sandwiched between a baguette - the bread overpowers the flavors and makes it too bland. As we sat out by the GVR pool, Jerry confirmed that his sandwich was bland and disappointing. Meh.

The service was fine, but honestly, the sandwiches are much better at Subway, Quiznos and even Togos (California chain.)

Pros:
1.) Great customer service. There were 4 dudes working and they all had a grin on their face.
2.) This location gives you a free, small bag of chips just for checking into Yelp. Score!
3.) Service was fast & efficient, our sandwiches were made correctly...the turnaround time is swift.
4.) This location serves french fries AND breakfast. This made me happy! Most locations do not serve either.
5.) Awesome location in GVR. Around lots of things...including the pool, the theaters, and The District. Plus, this location is open late which is perfect for late night drunken munchies ;) You can order anything from there to-go.
6.) I got a coupon on my receipt for $3 off my next Capriotti's purchase just by completing an easy peasy phone survey. 
7.) Instead of only offering Caps' generic bagged chips, this location also has name brand chips as well (Doritos, Lays, etc.)
8.) Clean!

Cons:
1.) Found a turkey bone in our sandwich. I just told management to be a little more careful. Luckily we didn't bite down on it hard.
2.) The smoke flows in to the seating area of the food court as there are slot machines located nearby.

You can clearly see the pros outweigh the cons. We'll definitely be back again and again. Who can resist their Bobbie? YUM!",Z6sMdVaYrFoAOL-Kbc7b3Q,1,1,4,JwHJpurmtPaBKq2Duxm6wQ
