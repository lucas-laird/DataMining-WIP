They got signs all over their fucking restaurant it's a they have sandwiches they have oatmeal that other things aside from Donuts but when I go in there and ask for a donut the idiot behind the counter doesn't understand what I mean when I ask for a fucking sandwich. So then I asked if he had anything else but Donuts. He said yes I asked what he said Donuts. But I said I didn't want donuts and I told him that then I asked him again do you have anything but Donuts right now. And he said again yes we have Donuts I don't want donuts I said we went back and forth like this for nearly 15 goddamn minutes because this guy was too stupid to understand that I didn't want fucking Donuts the only reason I came to this place it's because it's the only goddamn place here that's open. And their advertising all over the place that they have things other than donuts and it says right on that advertisement served all day. But this guy refused to sell me anything but Donuts.

If you need to grab breakfast for your work squad, call ahead for a discount: the Winchell's dozen (14 assorted glazed and filled donuts, bars, and twists) is entirely customizable and regularly $10, but calling ahead with a large order has saved me a few bucks, thanks to friendly management. 

But I keep coming back for the sandwiches: $5 for a bagel sando packed with fresh toppings, add a dollar for chips and a drink. The turkey is my go-to, but the BLTCC (BLT + cream cheese) is a tasty indulgence too, if you opt for savory over sweet. Note that the bagels themselves are not of stellar quality- they can be a bit hard (rather than chewy) even when they're not toasted.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,8,3,i8vcYhaHGQWxon7oks8U5A

Service was friendly, place was clean.  Hadn't been to a Winchell's in a long time so bought a dozen (yes, their dozen is actually 14 which is nice).  Tried their cinammon buns, didn't like them.  They taste more like apple fritters than cinammon (couldn't taste any cinammon at all ). I'll stick with grocery store cinammon rolls and skip the Winchells.  (they are large, but tasteless and really nor worth all that dough in your stomach!).  Prices are okay.  The other donuts were very ""meh"" and had a somewhat artificial flavor at times.  They seemed fresh so no complaints there.  I just don't care for winchell's flavors or the ""off"" taste or aftertaste  some of their stuff has.  These are the kind of donuts that would  be okay as a breaktime treat for  a bunch of hungry workers who need a sugar fix or a  crowd  of little kids who  love to gobble  dough and sugar washed down with Kool-Aid.
Also, if you're on a budget, the prices won't break your bank like at Krispy Kreme (which I far prefer but can no longer afford).
