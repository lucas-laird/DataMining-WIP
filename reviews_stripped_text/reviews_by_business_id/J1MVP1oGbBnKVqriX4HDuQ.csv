When I asked if contacting corporate would help expedite correcting the problem, he advised ""it might"".

Like others that have yelped it is under staffed but the biggest issue that I've seen is they have a pest problem. The first time I went with my wife and we saw little black bugs crawling out of the creamer. At first we thought this was one time occurrence and they took care of the issue (For health inspection reasons) but no, we went again 2 months later and this time more little bugs were crawling from the plates. We showed the waitress the bugs and the manager eventually only compensated the one plate (Could of done a better job, come on... these are bugs crawling in your food, a definite health violation).  Also who knows the bugs could have been in all of the food. The waitress seemed like this was a normal occurrence which makes me wonder how bad it really is. Half of the bugs from the plate escaped into the booths. So next time you go to this Denny's keep an eye out for little bugs in your food. The bugs were the size of a nail head.

Through out our whole meal one person received a refill. We were rarely checked up on as far as food quality. Not nearly enough napkins were provided for the amount of people that were dining.

So we head out again and about a couple miles away we find this little hidden gem. We walked in, no wait, got seated by a friendly waitress, and placed our orders almost instantly.

My point of this review is if an establishment is going to sponsor a game inside of their place of business then their staff should be trained on how to take care of customer concerns. At least let the customer know what they can do about it instead of saying, ""We don't have anything to do with the games.""",aHZbO7KFZrHy3pl6TyyhMw,0,0,1,N52OgiQxGJ4cB85-gn-Qmw

You come to Denny's because it's convenient, the food is good, and it's all well-priced. So obviously, this is one of my favorite places. One time, after an all-nighter, I came here with my GF at 5 a.m. and it was the best. It's never too full, which means the service is always fast.

The breakfast food is my favorite - I could eat breakfast day and night and I'd get it from here. I'm not a huge fan of the dinner items (fish, burgers, etc.), but it's because of my personal preference on the type of cuisine, not the establishment's food itself. Yesterday we came here because we were too lazy to cook at home LOL and we wanted pancakes. Our server was Michael - he was amazing! He got all our stuff to us very quickly, and I'm pretty sure he was the only waiter waiting on about five or six tables. I'm hoping next time we go to Denny's we'll get him again. :)

I'm giving Denny's three stars because it's Denny's...I mean, can you get better food elsewhere? Sure. Can you get better service somewhere else? Yeah, maybe. But that doesn't take away from the fact that it's still good and it's....cozy. It's not ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" and it shouldn't be (in my opinion) because then that means it's so hyped up that it would always be crowded. And yes, I'm a fan - but I say A-OK because it's a term my grandpa uses to describe something that's pleasant and familiar. It's the old, married couple enjoying dinner after 65 years together; it's the mom and her child coloring outside the lines.

The service seems to have changed since the help is being attentive this afternoon! Also the staff is busy & they are working with eachother instead of against eachother.  Plus the coffee tastes fresh the aroma of coffee is tickling my nose. Puts anyone in a good mood.

The food is eh.  My skillet came without seasoning on the red skinned potatoes.. super plain.  I sent it back because I think the seasoned potatoe makes the dish along with the Chorizo.  My meal came out exactly the same,  no seasoning again.  So I just ate it plain.

I usually come here at night with my friends so I can't speak for anything more than the night staff, and not howdy, they suck sometimes. I usually come here with a large party with my friends and sometimes, they have trouble sitting us unfortunately. I understand when it gets busy which is some of the times, but a few times, it has taken more than 15 minutes with a relatively empty diner. The manager at that time said it would be that long, he goes to the back, and disappears. I know he could have easily went to go fix some tables for us, but he just decided not to. I don't think my friends noticed but I was a little upset. At night, they are also understaffed it seems with one server for a portion of the night shift. There was a time where a lot of people came in at once, and a lot of people left just because they weren't getting seated fast enough. The manager could have done a better job with helping the server, but the poor girl had to try and do everything herself but couldn't.

     My Wife, son and Myself wanted a late night snack and ice cream after a ball game. So we decided to go to Denny's. The one we normally go to was packed so we opted to visit this one.. My Wife and son decided to also eat something. My wife ordered her food and said to the waitress I will also be wanting to get this item after I eat ( the 4 dollar brownie sundae ) and said i'm just letting you know cause I know it takes a bit to put together. My son ordered a chocolate shake and his sandwich. I ordered the strawberry sundae. I said I want 2 scoops vanilla ice cream strawberry topping and whip cream no nuts.. Repeated it to her 2 more times as she had a puzzled look on her face. 

      In about 4 min or so, she shows up at the table with my wife's desert ( she hasn't even gotten her food yet )  my sons chocolate shake and a bowl containing 2 scoops of strawberry ice cream with whip cream on top..  I said umm this isn't what i ordered. she looked at me like dear in the head lights.. and i said its suppose to be 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream strawberry topping and whip cream.. she nods and say or I'm sorry.. goes back to the kitchen and bring me out the very same bowl with a scoop of vanilla ice cream added and a very small amount of strawberry topping only on the vanilla ice cream. and here sat the other two scoops of strawberry ice cream and the whip cream.. The new scoop had no whip cream.. i gave up.. I ate it anyway.. then as all this is going on my families food came out.. it was really good.. But my wife would have preferred to enjoyed her desert after her food I'm sure, rather then before..  

 Now its time to pay..  I go to the front and the counter is partially blocked by game machines..  So I kinda say to the girl at the register, this counter is kinda back wards it should be reversed so that are there is where we pay. she looks at me and goes HUH? so I try to explain just to send this girl into never land..  And she never came out of it.. I signed my check and we left.. Saying we will never go back again to this location..

    Then today I check my bank account and they charged me for my check and there is a second charge for another amount also.. and not what the tip should have been like another full check but not the same price..  So now i have to go fight that also..

The most recent time, there was only one server, and about 6 tables to serve with large groups. It took us 20 minutes to get us drinks.
Now I am not blaming the server because I know how harsh that is, and you can tell the server had an attitude because of the shortage of help. 

This corporation makes enough money to employ more workers. Denny's should be ashamed and If I was that waiter I would have walked out, because that is too much strain for one person!

Only reason Denny's is a good choice is because the prices of food is good.",T1XUUXIEU5uj3NmdWAdIlA,0,0,2,CCO5rFus9oGlDapcCs-_kQ

He also messed up both our orders and when we notified him he took 10 minutes to bring back our new eggs and fries so our food got cold.  It wasn't until the manager noticed we were waiting for so long. They forgot our condiments after we asked, our refills, and there was no customer service. I wouldn't recommend this Denny's unless you have nothing but time and patience... or you like cold food.",t-tS629CDEF7aaG2zOislA,0,0,1,yW3rVyf3MI3LoDLgkEr68A

We  celebrated a friend's birthday at Hot and Juicy Crawfish and were looking for a 'less fishy' place to sing happy bday and maybe have some good coffee. We stopped at a few places and they were either closed or full, so we ventured into Denny's to see if we could bring the cake in and have some coffee- great coffee BTW. Although clearly busy and short-staffed, the manager was very pleasant and welcomed us into the restaurant. Her smile and customer service oriented demeanor earned her and the staff 5 stars. I wish I could remember her name, but for the record she was working 11/24 at about 10pm.

I normally do not review chain restaurants, as there is not much of an experience to talk about. However, I ALWAYS compliment great service and that is why I am taking the time to write in.",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,1,1,5,0cspn5mhTUx4MsDoV8cAjA

We were seated right away and already knew what we wanted to order.  We had a party of 3 and ordered 2 meals to share, which is perfect for our little group.  We enjoyed the philly steak and cheese omelet with hashbrowns and our choice of toast.  We chose the sourdough and it was delicious with the jam!

We also ordered the good old stand-by, ""Super Bird"" turkey, bacon, cheese and tomato on toast.  We had french fries on the side of this meal.  We split the meals up and had a few bites of everything.  I love to do this type of ""sampling"" with my favorite people....my family!  

The meal only cost us $21 plus a tip.  When we arrived at 6pm, it was an empty restaurant.  When we left at 7pm, they had a packed house! Waay to go Denny's.  See you tomorrow for breakfast :)

Tips and Hints.....Get the hot chocolate!  Free refills for warm bodies and toes.
Get the apple crisp alamode...Drizzled in caramel topped with icecream!  My fave :)",VQ5tnvBejxZVGO0LJxhm7g,0,1,4,PJp9Ie4rrToZsHKXnnUfkA

BUT I ate there five times this week and each and every time they brought a meal WITHOUT silverware. Bizarre because unpopulated tables have it.

It is about 10 minutes away from the Strip, but I don't think this is considered touristy one bit.  The people who came in all looked local (like they have a tourist sign on their head?)... older folks, families, and the table next to me were 2 little old Korean ladies just catching up over a shared bacon and eggs platter.

We came on a Monday (President's Day) around 8:00 and was seated immediately.  Service is slow but at least the place is clean, and they filled our coffee frequently. 

They support the local hockey team, with a Hat Trick promotion for the Vegas Golden Knights.  I thought that was cool that this particular location embraced the new team.

Denny's does breakfast right. I find it rare that a Denny's screws up breakfast, and this one did not disappoint.  I am not a fan of their beverages, so right after brekkie, I walked over to starbucks and got myself a delicious soy latte.",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,3,5,4,uEzC9HwH53sF8dSjWEkxMQ

Thank you Bernadette!! The red country potatoes instead of hash, with grilled onions and cheese melted on top, was amaaazing! Got salsa and pico de gallo on the side, the salsa complimented the omelette and potatoes perfectly, veggies in omelette were very hearty, better than expected. Next time maybe I'll add jalapeños or something to the omelette, was missing a certain kick of flavor.

I'll give this one the number 2 spot for worse Denny's.  First the hostess gave our table to another group ""Rob, party of 4...Rob"" (Rob's my friend) the other group had the name ""Bob."" simple mistake.  It's OK.

Second, I think two of the waitress' were fighting over our table.  Maybe for tips?  I have no clue but they both came back taking our drink order, later our food order, and excessively wanted to refill our drinks every 5 minutes.  Oh Oh Oh!!! I forgot to mention the first server set the expectations low by telling us something I rather not say in fear that a manager reading this and reprimanding her.

Third, our food took 30 minutes to show up.

Fourth, everything tasted warm but on the cold side.

There alot more 'bigger better breakfast' places out there to try.  Skip Denny's.  Nothing great here.
