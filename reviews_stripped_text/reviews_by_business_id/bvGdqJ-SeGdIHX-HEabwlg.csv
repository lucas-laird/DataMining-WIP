Their seafood dishes are wonderful; full of flavor, not over priced (very reasonable) and a good portion.  Their pasta dishes are great; Veal Parmesan?  Great!  Eggplant Parmesan?  Wonderful!  Appetizers?  Terrific!  Wine list?  Decent as well.  Desserts? MMMMMMMM!

The staff here is personable, attentive, and really care about your experience.  We love to come here and the only reason we don't frequent more often is so that we don't get nonchalant about it.

We went for an anniversary dinner which was excellent! We saw they had an intimate bar inside the restaurant with a happy hour menu & drink specials. I thought we would try it next time. 
When we we returned, the hostess was practically guarding the door.  When we tried to go in she grilled us as to our purpose! We said we would like to enjoy the happy hour at the bar. She said it was reserved, probably for their cast of regulars. (There were only three people sitting there.) She offered us a dinner table instead. I asked if the happy our deals were extended to the tables and she said no.
Instead of turning away customers, they could've offered us at a side table and extended the  happy hour menu to us. Another gentleman was turned away for the same reason.

You will not be disappointed!   To the owners, keep up the great work!",NFAMcPMEBG3bECj0hOig-A,0,0,5,Bwzk_sNDueBRnswwhteRNQ

We talked to the owner/ manager of food service and he was so very nice. Our waitress was so sweet and attentive. Both of us had the cheese tortellini and they were to die for. But then I had the creme brûlée and oh my goodness, it was fantastic!! And the prices were more than reasonable, I couldn't be more pleased with this place!! We will be coming back here time and time again to enjoy the fantastic service and phenomenal food. I am so happy we finally tried this place, I can't wait to come back very, very soon!!

They were a little busier than usual tonight so the waitress took a little while to check on us but she was nice and friendly. The restaurant has a cozy and calm vibe.

Inside, it had a very relaxing and pretty atmosphere. I loved the large fish tank behind the bar!

The food was amazing. I ordered spaghetti--probably some of the best meat sauce I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parmigiana, and that was really good too!

1493095,2014-08-25,5,bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg,"The GF and I were looking for a nice, romantic place to enjoy dinner in the Centennial area.  Not wanting to go anywhere near the strip on Saturday night, I pulled out the yelp stone and gazed heavily upon it.  After refining my search and reading the NBIB reviews, I used the yelp function to make a reservation.

NBIB is located inside Bogies.  This may or may not have changes names many times since I have been here in Vegas.  I have not so many fond memories of slinging concrete back in 96' west of this location.  I was very excited to give this a shot.

Again, I waved my hands over the oracle that is yelp, and used a not so often used (in my world) reservation function. 8:00 PM, was the time.

Upon our arrival, we were greeted in the space between Bogies and NBIB by our host.  We told him we had a reservation and he seemed confused, and this made me confused.  He told us he would talk to management and quickly returned to show us to our booth.  You can definitely smell the age of Bogies on the other side, there shorter time you spend in this area...the better.

We sort of dressed up for the occasion, business casual.  We found the restaurant to contain others that dressed up and a few who were dressed pretty casual.

Our waitress was prompt and super friendly.  We ordered a bottle of wine, which the bartender quickly brought to the table and put on ice.  Bread would eventually follow, and was fresh and tasty.  We ordered up some garlic bread and the first batch was awesome.  A second batch, not so much as every piece was marred by char.  This was quickly rectified and did not reflect on the bill.

The waitress returned and we were ready to order.  We ordered up a Caprese Salad.  The tomatoes were fresh and delicious as was the Mozzarella.

I ordered up the Chicken Marsala.  It was wonderful!  The combination of bountiful mushrooms and tasty garlic was amazing!

The GF ordered the Linguine con Gamberi e Funghi. The linguine was cooked to perfection. The shrimp and mushrooms were righteous.  The creamy tomato sauce was smooth as silk.

While dinning a very nice gentleman, sadly I do not know his name, sat down and explained NBIB's error on the reservation.  I appreciated his time and sitting down is always a nice touch.

For dessert, we went with a slice of Spumoni pie.  It was an excellent way to finish off the meal.

If your up in the area and looking to not travel down into the bowels of the valley for a nice Italian dinner for two (or more), give North Beach Italian Bistro a shot!",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,11,6,4,2_Q0SjCD9YQpUYAVLiEE0Q

My husband and I called in on a Friday night around 7:30 to check their wait time and whoever took the phone call stuck a reserved sign on a table for us right then and there. We did let him know we were just about a mile away. 

The service was perfect, as our waitress was courteous and prompts. We had ordered the eggplant Parmesan and chicken Parmesan. Both were delicious and loaded with cheese (too much for my liking but at least you know they're not holding back). Complimentary bread was also nice and warm. 

The only negative I can think of is the cannoli filling  was mediocre. The shell was perfect and the tiramisu was fantastic.

The food and service was exceptional. Olive Garden is no where near comparison but I can assure you that all that we got--1 salad, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 domestic beer and 1 wine would have cost us a higher tab at OG....  I know the food is 10 times better here...  We were curious how our experience would be by just trusting yelp and not having a friend's referral....  I told the girlfriend as we sat for a beverage at the Bogey's Pub next door(a greeting station area divides them) that any restaurant that only opens for dinner/supper probably focuses on detail.  The other 2 things I loved was of course Bogey's to wet our whistle before dinner(we got there well prior to our 5pm reservation) and being just a little bit away from most all other businesses was neat--an exclusive location a few long blocks from Ann Rd. & Centennial Center...

Oh, it is okay here to be really casual.... I wore cargo shorts, a nice shirt, and flip flops....  The girlfriend out dressed me as always....

1935617,2017-04-23,1,bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg,"First the venue and the ambiance, I have to admit it is nice. Spacious dining room, comfortable booths and tables, simple and elegant decoration, and ample parking spots. This place has all the basic ingredients to become a 4.5 star restaurant. 

However, when we first walked in, the host, which I assume to be the owner, addressed my party with Arrigato -- since we are Asian and thus he presumes that either we are Japanese or all Asians speak Japanese - a presumption that irritates me tremendously. I have to bite my tongue not to respond in German, in order to correct his presumption. 

We were seated and now the food:  

1. We ordered the crab cake, special of the day,  for appetizer. The crab cake is OK taste wise, but it is full of fillers. Actual amount of crab meat is very minimal. Also included in the crab cake are many vegetable ingredients. The plating is attractive but still not my type of crab cake due to the amount of fillers.  Grade: C-.

2. We ordered a Caesar Salad - it is quite sandy. It is  unthinkable that the lettuces they use are not well cleaned. Portion is good but plating needs improvement.   Grade: C-.

3. Veal Chop - special of the day. A large bone in veal chop with a lot of tasty spinach and mushroom. This should be an A dish -- unfortunately the dish has to be re-heated as the chop is still rare. The mash potato is probably from a box. A 4.5 star restaurant should offer home-made mash potato. Aside from the deficiencies, I will still rate this dish a B+.

4. Shrimp Scampi with Papadelle pasta. The portion is good and there are 8 or 9 decent size shrimps in this dish. This is in a lemony cream sauce and it is quite tasty.  May be it is just a personal preference, but the sauce is just too tart. I can only rate it as a B-.

This is not a 4.5 star restaurant as other yelpers have indicated so. Food really has to improve. It does have all the basic requirements but improvements needed. A 3 star restaurant is about it.",35sxzW8p-FGCN4_XB78FCQ,2,0,3,sztT-Kp7Qp5FOLK2kiuxLQ

The fish tank behind the bar is visually appealing. Be sure to look for the original photo of the owner with Elvis Presley in Vegas on a wall at the end of the bar.

I've enjoyed every pasta dish that I've tried and prices are very reasonable. Chef prepares a menu of nightly specials that look delicious. The dark ambiance makes for a nice candlelit dinner but the crayons and paper table covers remind you that North Beach is very family friendly.

2600443,2016-07-19,0,bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg,Had high hope considering the reviews. The piccata was bland with very few capers. Meatballs were ok but the sauce was horrible. Our dogs liked it though. The seafood special was ok with the asparagus and brocollini tasting too acidic that we could not eat it. The caprese and crabcake was just ok. If you have to put your own balsamic and oil on your caprese salad at least put a good quality on the table.  The only thing we enjoyed was the bread but for $80 for tap water and no dessert it was way too expensive.  We won't be going back. It wasn't even worth $30.

2632157,2015-10-11,0,bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg,"We went to North Beach Italian Bistro for our anniversary. While it is not super fancy or pretentious, it was very comfortable and friendly. Everyone we came in contact with was so nice and so friendly. From the Hostess, to the bartender to the server and the food runner. Everyone was great and gave us great service. The owner and the bartender both stopped by to see how our meal was. 

We ordered the calamari appetizer which was HUGH!  The calamari was perfectly done and not greasy at all. Then we each had a salad. My husband had the Caesar and I had the Italian Mista. Both were excellent. For our entrees, I had the Cioppino and my husband had the Cappelini Frutti di Mare. The Cioppino was different than any nice had before. Instead of a thick tomato stew base, it was a lighter broth, but was so flavorful and full of seafood. The Fruitti diMari was also different, as it was served in a creamy white sauce, but again, it was delightful.

2771025,2015-01-09,0,bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg,"This is a real hidden gem out in suburban Las Vegas, nestled randomly between residential neighborhoods. When you drive in to the lot - it feels like you're about to head in to a small church or some type of other venue. But once you walk in (and go left - there is a bar to the right), you are warmly greeted by the staff.

My family and I had reservations, and when we walked in, the staff seemed to know that it was us - they had a ""oh yes, they are here!"" type of positive energy - basically we felt very special. Props to the staff. We had several servers throughout the night, different members of the restaurant staff checking in on us. Each time felt genuine and never overwhelming or annoying, however. Truly top notch service!

The food is also good. We started off with Calamari Fritti as an appetizer, delicious calamari fried to a perfect gold. I had the Pollo Parmigiana (chicken parmesan) which was great and also comes with a small side of marinara pasta. The dishes my parents got were even better. My mother had the Lenguine con Gamberi e Funghi (lenguine with shrimp) which was tasty, and my dad had the Capelleni ai Frutti Di Mare, which was essentially a seafood-lovers pasta. It is angel hair pasta mixed with this delicious creamy sauce, topped with shrimp, lobster meat, scallions, and scallops. Next time I come back here, I'm definitely getting that dish!

I have GOT to mention the restrooms at this place. The men's restroom was probably one of the nicest restaurant restrooms I have used. It was a large room with part of the floor tiled, and others with a nice carpet. It was well-ventilated, well-decorated - and extremely clean. I feel restrooms seldom get mentioned, but North Beach's restaurants are five stars itself.

If you're ever out in this part of Vegas - this is definitely worth it. And it's very inexpensive. Have yourself a glass of wine and enjoy from their great selection of Italian dishes. When in doubt, go for the Capelleni ai Frutti Di Mare!",VKuaUpn6K9AoqS0hJmaqug,2,1,5,WXLJ09No5mA1aHmkq8WZFg

It's by itself as far as other restaurants that are near by.

The place looks like your gonna drop a pretty penny. The out side looks fancy and the inside is a beautiful set up for a date. The atmosphere is a moderate lighting with some soft music that you can relax to. The music is low almost to the point where if you are having conversation with the person or people you are with you cannot hear the music. 

It's good for kids from what I gather, I didn't have any there with me but the put some white paper on the table that is good for drawing and there is some crayons at the table for them to use. 

The staff is super friendly and checks on you at every step to ensure there is nothing else you need. The owner showed us to our seat when we arrived and check on as well about 2 times to ensure his staff was meeting our needs. 

The price wasn't to bad if you ask me. It's about $20 a person plus drinks, appetizers and desert. There is a full bar as well.

The food was great, it was hot when it came to the table. The food was fresh had an authentic Italian taste to it. had no complaints there. 

I definitely will be recommending this place to people. They also do big parties, they do weddings out back and they have a bar that is separate from the restaurant but you can still get the same great food n more.",_GVfHFESIDKYO-WX3332ig,5,3,5,l7Mf-JUmpa0GU8X6lkQs0A

3212496,2016-01-30,0,bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg,"So the only odd/off thing about this place is the location, though that might actually be a plus since it may keep the hordes away; this is important because the venue isn't large and probably cannot support the much larger following it deserves.

The service is excellent, everyone is attentive and friendly and knows their job thoroughly.  The owner makes it a point to engage with everyone, and I saw more than one back-slapping hug for regular patrons.  Like most places in Vegas, you can dress up or down and fit right in.  The atmosphere is casual.

The only disappointing thing was the caprese salad; it was beautiful but the mozzarella was bland and the tomatoes had no flavor.  Tomatoes with flavor are hard to find but I had hopes the chef possessed a good source.  Sadly, he seems to be stuck with the same beautiful, tasteless items as the rest of us that do not grow our own.

The wife had the chicken Marsala and it was excellent; I will likely order it the next time we visit.  I had the veal special, which this night was veal osso bucco.  It was fork-tender, oversize and thoughtfully served with a little shrimp-fork stuck in the bone for getting to the marrow, which was incredibly rich and savory.  I barely  touched the linguini served alongside and still failed to finish the veal.  The saucier is highly skilled, as both dishes were made complete by excellent sauces.

We finished with a cannoli, which was large enough for us both and as good as I've ever had.

We will certainly return, and I recommend this place without hesitation.  Try the veal osso buco if you are really hungry, or just want a lot of something delicious and well-crafted.",Q2q3swXJRaNhS4CGTy_kzg,2,0,4,9zI5AF2dLpHKVsa4lekNAg

First Star  The owner Ozzie greets everyone that walks through the door, and the second time I returned he remembered me and I felt like I was one of his regulars. Trust me, he has had regulars since the Rat Pack times when he had his first restaurant.

Second Star  Oscar the bartender has worked with Ozzie forever and does the same thing at the bar! He now knows my Mom, my friends and makes everyone feel welcome.  All of the staff is makes one feel they are at home and it works. I am not talking about the corporate chain way, everyone knows their repeat customers and they get to know new ones!

Third Star  The food is great. This is old school Italian done well! Sometimes we order off the Happy Hour menu, sometimes it is pasta, and the Osso Bucco was outstanding. The Chimichurri sauce is the Argentine twist to dip your bread. That is where Ozzie and Oscar are from! Desserts are to die for and I wish I could eat more of them but I can't eat gluten but I watch my friends and I am jealous!

Fourth Star  This will make you laugh, they have the most beautiful bathroom. What?!  What I do know about bathrooms, if they are clean and pristine like this one, it reflects a clean kitchen!

Fifth Star  When you combine all of the above, this is a dream come true, especially when it is located in the North!

3789504,2017-06-17,0,bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg,"We had this place recommended to us by several different sources, but on the whole it was the most disappointing Las Vegas dining experience I have had to date. Don't get me wrong the service was excellent, the prices were extremely reasonable, but the food... was just crap.

We started with the crab cake appetizer, which was the highlight of the meal. It was just okay, a little on the flavorless side, with more veggies than crab. The bread that was served with the meal had a decent texture, but was almost completely lacking salt. The pasta fagiole soup was likewise very bland, and underseasoned.

Once we got to the entrees, however, things went south. I got the ribeye, which was extremely variable: medium in some parts, well-done in others. I had ordered it medium-rare, no part of it was less than medium. I got a side of pasta with marinara as a side, and this is where I just kind of gave up on the place. Their ""marinara"" was an orangey goo sitting on top of overcooked spaghetti, with watery orange liquid in the bottom of the bowl. It looked like pureed carrots, and tasted like nothing. It was the absence of flavor. 

My lady friend had the shrimp ravioli, which actually had a very pleasant flavor, primarily seafood and mushroom. However, they served it with some butterflied shrimp that were so hammered they were almost inedible. This dish might have been the highlight of the night, if it hadn't made my lady friend ill. Race to the bathroom kinda ill.

All in all, outside of the service, there is absolutely nothing to recommend this place. I am predisposed to favor Italian restaurant, but there is nothing about this place that I would want to return for, especially when rolling the dice with gastrointestinal distress.",PCMe2gFSi--fDWWhNqxrPw,2,0,1,al99jHMtL-e9pOYIPU4dEQ

FOOD:

We started off with the beef carpaccio, this was amazing, thin slices of tender heaven. I highly recommend you give this a try for an appetizer. 

We also ordered lasagna, good size portion. The meat sauce was excellent, lots of cheese and the noodles were al dente. 

We ordered several different desserts. Canoli, creme brulee, and some sort of ice cream cake. They were all great, but I'd reccomend the canoli and the ice cream cake. 

SERVICE:
5 stars!!! I wish i remembered her name, but she was extremely friendly and professional. Our drinks were never close to being empty and she was prompt with everything we asked for. The owner came by to make sure everything was perfect. They treated us like family as soon as we walked in the door. 

IN CONCLUSION 

This is about 15 mins off the strip, and well worth the drive. This will be a place I frequent each time I'm in Vegas. Do yourself a favor and come check this place out, you won't be sorry.

4015803,2016-04-06,1,bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg,"North Beach Italian Bistro was the result of wanting to try an eatery close to my home and random Yelping. This, obviously, is not the tactic I should use for future dinner choices. Although this place is cute inside and the service is quite good, I wouldn`t come back here unless someone kidnapped me and we showed up here and I was really hungry.

My party didn`t show up with reservations because we are a bunch of savages, but we thought ""How busy could it be?"". Well, they only had a couple of tables left, so I suppose quite busy, and we had to sit at a table(which I`m just not down with usually because I like booths), but I got over it pretty quick. The water person came over and filled up our cups until they runneth over(not really) and I was happy with the quick service thus far. Then our waitress came over and took our drink order(wine, please! All of it.) and then went away. We were left alone quite some time to our own devices and without bread, but that wasn't a big deal. We actually chatted like humans and it was awesome and then the bread came and that was over. I went into a gluten coma. Bread was delicious and butter is always a welcome food group. There was hope.

Then we put in our orders. I got the rigatoni puttanesca and the other two people in my group got the pasta carbonara and lasagna. Easy. Bring on the food. We ate bread which seemed like forever and it seemed like they were taking quite a while with the food. Not to worry, though, more actual human interaction was taking place. Good times in a world where people never talk to each other.

Food arrived and was pretty underwhelming. My rigatoni puttanesca just didn`t feel exciting and I felt like there wasn't enough sauce. It was just not very good. The pasta carbonara seemed really heavy and greasy and was not finished. The lasagne did seem to go over well, but as a whole the group was not impressed. 

Here is the nail in the coffin, though: We ordered two glasses of wine and they charged us for one glass and one bottle. We had to flag down our waitress and get this corrected, otherwise they would have let us pay for a bottle. Not a huge deal, as mistakes do happen, but it just wasn't a good experience. #ByeFelicia",hqr0F0tU7CFCISxfEpuk1Q,0,1,2,yHzLLAIyK95VrqyI58vr-w

Short Review:
North Beach Italian Bistro is a local spot in the Northwest that deserves a lot of praise for their excellent customer service, authentic Italian dishes, huge portions, and great entrée prices.  I'm a fan and couldn't wait to tell friends how good this place is.  

Longer Review:
North Beach Italian Bistro has been around for a couple of years now.  North Beach Italian Bistro shares a building with Bogie's Bar right off Ann Road in the Northwest.  The one thing that I immediately noticed that separates North Beach Italian Bistro from Bogey's Bar is the huge aquarium.  I didn't make reservations, but it's highly recommended since this restaurant is small and can fill up quick.  From start to finish, the overall service was awesome.  Our server gave us her recommendations, some insight on the local's favorites, and warned us that the portions are very generous.  Their small salad and a side of meatballs are big enough to feed two.  I got their Chicken Parmigiana, which is served with mozzarella cheese, Pomodoro sauce, and pasta. Our server wasn't lying about the portions for their entrees. The chicken parm that I got was 3 huge pieces of breaded chicken breast.  The meat was tender and the breading was on point.  My belly was satisfied with one breast, but I couldn't help myself.  I finished the whole thing.  Yes, it was that good.  North Beach Italian Bistro is one of those places where you cannot judge quality and portion size by their prices.  Most of their entrees cost around $15 and you get a lot for your money.  The portions are so big that I left stuffed and my fiancé took home leftovers.  Overall, I highly recommend.  Good Job, North Beach!!!",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,6,6,4,8c89jaAmk0duhMA24IPGnA

4309783,2017-01-15,0,bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg,"We are incredibly picky about Italian food, and there is not much choice of eateries where we live. We have a GO TO, but it's in a casino. Sometimes, you just want to avoid that crowd. After watching Lidia Bastianich this afternoon, all we could think of is where the heck can we go to have a decent Italian meal in North Las Vegas. We whip out the reviews sections and find there is one relatively close to us, one we have passed curiously for some time and one we would be willing to risk it for. We were not able to make a reservation on Y**p for some reason, so we figured how bad could the wait be? When we arrived, we were told about an hour. Well that's our fault for not calling ahead. There is a simple bar next door called Bogies, smokers, yuk, but we decided to hang there until a table was ready. It was less then 20 minutes. Now, I have a mother in law that prepares the most amazing Italian dishes. That side of my family is off the boat, and are VERY fussy about their preparations and presentations. So pleasing me is a pretty tall order. We began with a started course, Carpaccio and it was perfect, fresh tender paper thin slices of meat, capers and a beautiful spring mix of greens in the middle with a whisper of Dijon Mustard vinaigrette. We ordered the Pancetta Carbonara and the simple Ravioli. The pastas are all homemade there and the sauces were clean and fresh as well. For dessert we decided to not split this time, and go right for 2 favorites, Creme Brulee (it's HUGE) and there homemade Tiramisu - this little daring was the best I've ever had. The ladyfingers were delicate and again, freshly homeade, and the base it's self was presented with care and, I hate to sound corny, love! We were overwhelmed with how everything was so delicious. I believe we have found a new favorite here in North Las Vegas! I would pop in here just for dessert and a digestif. Beginning to end we had a very comfortable hour and a half and were never tapping our fingers waiting on someone to be there for us.

First off, the place is beyond amazing for it's luxury. You would think you were on the strip, but nope! Aside from the friendly service, they were very professional and authentic, thus meaning I could barely understand a word of their English being spoken. Table mats are actually made to be drawn on for the kids (pretty cool). As far as the ambience, seating is spread out well so you do not feel so cramped, and it is very quite and has a semi dark romantic theme going on. Definitely should be on your date night list, gentlemen.

Most pricey plate here was only $20. I enjoyed their delicious Capellini ai Fruitti Di Mare. So delicious! Took half an hour for all 5 of our plates to come out and everything was amazing including the steak, calamari, and pizza. (pictures attached)

I sensed the ambience to be a more grown up crowd, which i actually thought was good because there wasn't any crying children when i went. Fun Fact, the bathrooms are really nice. 

We ordered the Crab Cakes. I myself don't care much for crab cakes in general, and honestly these didn't change my mind either. Their good but nothing extraordinary for my taste. Out pastas on the other hand were amazing though. I got on eof their specials of the night which was a crab ravioli served with shrimp in a pink saue. My friend got the Seafood pasta which cam with chucks of lobster, shrimp, and scallops. We were sharing and honestly what made it delicious was her angel hair pasta in my pink sauce. Kinda wish we could of jsut have both plates mixed together.

For Dessert my friend got the Spumoni cake. She will cake abouthis dessert for days. Im honestly not a big sweets person so i thought it was ok. But if you are, i would take her word for it.",-gSz76_bKNJsKM2adr12yw,2,3,4,i5d8B32A3CDTgUBdoz25kg

The caesar salad is so small that I can not fill up on the large one as my meal since I choose it to be my entree. Lettuce is so expensive that they can not give much in the pricey salad..heh!! The crab cakes are burnt on the outside and raw and cold on the inside. I requested them to be cooked inside.  Bread is sad. There are sooo many other restaurants to select from.  Most of the patrons are way above 75 years old. Looks like the nursing home bused them over here.,HoH6SgtKLt5Fj8hn3tkJHA,0,0,1,zyxG0W8xN2u1fL3UbVgTdg

Had a wonderful, slightly fancy, dinner here with a friend. We showed up on a weekday with no reservation and were quickly seated, but the restaurant was fairly crowded so reservations are surely appreciated. Got a glass of delicious delicious wine and a glass of iced water that was always refilled in a timely manner. Our waiter was one of the owners I believe and he shared helpful tips about the menu. 
We got an order of the meatballs for an appetizer and that was the highlight of the evening. Those were delicious! The eggplant parmigiana was perfectly breaded and lightly fried- not too soggy, but easy to cut with a fork. My friends chicken piccata was well cooked and moist and the sauce was on point. We had creme brulee for dessert and it was a perfect end to our meal. The menu was to be expected for an Italian joint, staff was perhaps a little overly friendly for my taste, and the wine menu had a great selection.

My cousin ordered the chicken parmigiana, she said it was delicious and the portion was so large that she had enough for lunch the next day. It was about $20 each dish to give you an idea of the price.

I'm taking off one star because the atmosphere is very romantic and date-night like. The interior was beautiful with a fancy old jazz club feel.

Appetizer of prusciutto and mozzarella was good, served on flatbread and mixed salad was fine.
My entree of chicken saltimbocca was not good. Hardly any chicken, hard slice of proscuitto, and melted cheese in an oily, unsatifying dish.
The wine list is not very good and my $10 glass of chianti was tough to drink.

Ordered chicken francese & chicken parm (pretty straight forward)... AWFUL!

You won't find the hostess at the stand, because she is busy drinking red wine at the bar. 
We got seated at a romantic booth with crayons. 
We ordered the crab cakes, the Argentinean(!) empanadas and baked clams that were 90% bread crumbs and 10% clams. All came out way too fast not to have been microwaved. 

As entrees we ordered the angel hair pasta with seafood and the house specialty- ossobuco . Both with way overcooked pasta. The only item tasty this far is the actual veal shank on the ossobuco. Very tender and juicy. Everything else so far you could have skipped. 

Dessert - since there were no fresh berries we decided to go with the tiramisu, an Italian delight? Way too moist and cold from the fridge. And no port or dessert wine to pair with it. 

When we made our reservation we were told they would honor the corkage fee for the bottle of wine we were bringing. We did get charged for it in our check though..........",82iRKVSyYx4h6vJU_BBaVQ,3,0,1,lKDS0hgkebok6nN_qJccvQ

I asked to get a grilled chicken sandwich. I've had this many times before. It comes with potatoe salad or French fries. I had been able to sub that for veggies. Didn't matter what they were because they cook them in bulk for other dishes. Last week the chef decided to charge for the veggies for the first time. The owner didn't stand up for me a customer for years that frequented their place. So to me the cook is the boss or the owner doesn't care! I've also will mention the food has become mediocre at best and some of the prices are way too much for the quality!

The fried calamari was perfect. It came with a very delicious sauce. The crabcakes had a little too much filling for my liking, but, they were still rather delicious. Everybody enjoyed their main entrée. I chose the eggplant Parmesan with a side of pasta Alfredo. Both were very delicious. We also had the Tiramisu for dessert. It tasted like it was house made. Extraordinary! All in all, we really enjoyed our dining experience. We will be coming back soon!",dEp7BNFhnjaMYWcJ_KqsyQ,24,19,5,RmW-YkvhpSjhsUHU8lyG7g

Service and ambience are top notch.  Pasta, seafood dishes, meatballs and chicken dishes are all good.  Best cannoli on the west side.  Nice wine pour by the glass and good bar.  Worth the drive out to Ann Road.",WM7MFrRP-7YFuGBAJ6quRQ,1,0,4,hCI9Llm9wu4Adadd2d80aw

However, the waitress was nice enough to bring two free desserts for the mix-up.   We were the youngest ones in the place by 50 years.  On the night we went, there was a live singer struttin' around crooning Sinatra to all the little old ladies with blue hair. Food was pretty darn good, but Olive Garden is cheaper and faster.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,1,0,3,rY9z29PgvN_S_HVizeKyYw

5769334,2016-10-07,0,bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg,This was recommended by a friend. It's ok inside plenty of seating. Staff was friendly. Two sizes of pizza available a seven and a ten inch. Not too too much size difference. Choice of a few different sauces and cheeses then toppings. It's brick fired oven is fast since it's a very thin pizza. It tasted ok for the value but nothing to rush back to.  Would go back if in the area again.,grnJwZM1tCkPe8EVTMlmsQ,0,0,4,XBJGkmBhVzFZfS2jftVhGQ
5775840,2015-11-15,0,bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg,Finding places like this makes me happy I use Yelp. Excellent service from the minute you walk in the door. Our service Oscar was polite and very prompt.the food is excellent and I am very picky about Italian food i.e. I don't eat at Olive Garden . It was a great find and definitely visit again when I'm in Vegas,o4HBnpg7tTInTzIbTLZyuQ,1,1,5,jEnBRaik8bNmLGGNM7qeIA

Although technically you don't need a reservation if it's a larger party its probably advisable. The Osso buco exceptional! (Veal with sauce and pasta)   Each neighborhood has its spot and this is definitely legit!  Try the empanadas ( Ozzie recipe) with the chimichuri (Oscar flair) not an Italian thing but definitely a must. Looking local you have found it! Thank you Gabriel and Patty!",-qV28-IoKgbdgX2UMuWkAg,0,0,5,Vcd6OPV2q28iWFaObMsG3A

Our waiter (forgot his name) was very attentive and didn't bother us. The food was excellent! It's been very hard trying to find a good Italian restaurant in Vegas.

5865300,2017-10-07,0,bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg,"I was yelping today for a new local hang out for good Italian food ... 

I found it. 
I went in tonight, and was greeted by the friendliest staff, and get this, also their customers. 
I noticed that almost everyone who came in the door, greeted one another, by first name no less. It's a local place wherein, it seems, everybody  knows your name ;) 
Exactly what I was looking for as I'm new to Las Vegas but mind you, they welcomed me as if I were a regular as well 

Oscar was the bartender extraordinaire 
. They treat you much like Italians in my family do.... like family .... 
I stopped in and saw they had happy hour drink specials. Oscar made a perfect rum punch. He was very kind to suggest a pasta for me, once I told him my likes and dislikes. And he chose very well, I loved my shrimp and mushroom pasta... I'm a bit of a garlic addict. So I wish I would have had the chef add more because I know they would have, happily done so 
But other than light on the garlic (for my personal taste) I can't say I would make any suggestions or improvements and I love it when there's enough food to take a doggy bag home. And... there was 

I was sinful and ordered the tiramisu to go. It was also excellent. 
I think I've found my new hang out 

Cleanliness was on point. Atmosphere was fantastic, (white table clothes yes, but  don't shy away. The prices on the menu were very reasonable) !! 
The far wall had a water feature and ambiance is very welcoming 

No doubt I will be back 
If you stop in. Say hello to Oscar, he's so very friendly and helpful. 
Now I didn't go in to the right (bar and gaming area I believe) I chose the restaurant side. It's as easy and choosing a door when you walk in. Best of both worlds and you chose what ambiance you prefer. 

Owners are on hand to greet you with a huge smile and a kind word as well 

This is a restaurant that once you come here, I think it will call your name to come back. I just left there and I want to go back already ;)",OfHzlooMIbq-1BS8ekX8og,0,0,5,ZIM9-wBVwKL3SHbAMrD_5Q

The little neck clams with a red pepper sauce (I think) was incredible. The Veal Osso Bocco (sp) was to die for!! The fettuccini was so perfect! Oscar our waiter was great, he seemed to be a seasoned vet, and made the whole experience very comfortable. Thank you sir! We drank water and ice tea for my girl and it didn't matter if we ordered wine like some places. We dressed in shorts and a clean T shirt and it wasn't frowned upon. We will be back, no doubt for the little neck clams at the very least! Thanks for a great dinner and a place we will return for great Italian!!",RIqF5RnBAzetCmyAXbVZiA,0,0,5,aVUXmPJrkuugkD4p6tNfxw

5929385,2017-11-10,1,bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg,I can't believe the high reviews for this place. All the food we ordered was terrible. The meatballs are mushy and flavorless. I added chicken to my penne alla vodka. The chicken was as dry as jerky and there was enough truffle oil to drown out all other flavors. The Caesar salad was bland. Service was good but the food was really terrible.,5uFncIskfmLIV1FI-dNY5Q,1,0,1,5t_gcPYYFQjbyKPkUDRQcw

We went on a busy weekend night without a reservation and they were able to get us a table. I highly recommend this place.,xYKP-R3XhIqYOe07_U9a7w,0,0,5,zHN7IkSgk8l04K5a2aHM2g
