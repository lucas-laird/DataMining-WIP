1049542,2011-06-07,0,kkD5pal9rRzE4PjeYSL9mA,"I also prefer this place to Taco Bell any day. 

This specific location is open 24 hours a day. As far as I know, there is not a 24 hour Taco Bell in town (again, as far as I know). So if I preferred Taco Bell, I couldn't access it whenever I wanted, thumbs down. 

The #5 is an excellent choice. Two big fat chicken tacos, fries, and a drink. Or, you could go with a #4, two chicken tacos, fries, and a drink. Yes I like their chicken tacos. Both combos are satisfying to my tummy. Even their hot sauce is hotter and tastier! 

I will continue to go to Del Taco when that late night craving takes over.",f5gw3C3jHrytKt69RB9eDA,0,0,4,XYLGJ8LBWobE1oaujSjA3g
1330174,2016-11-02,0,kkD5pal9rRzE4PjeYSL9mA,"I always stop here on Tuesdays for the 3 taco special. So I had a coupon to buy 1 platos and get one free. So we got the carne asada and the chicken platos. They both are wet burritos, rice, beans, and fresh  sliced avocado.  We got the usual tacos special as back up just in case we didn't like it.

The burritos are medium size (not too big and not too small) by we were pleasantly surprised. The sauce they used for carne asada was red and for the chicken they used green sauce.  I didn't think they could pull it off but they did and they have really stepped up their game. It doesn't taste like authentic Mexican food but it was tasty enough. Being born and raised in Cali, I know what it should taste like and they get a pass from me.

Service is usually pretty good even though they're always crowded and extremely busy.  I have attached the photos so you can see they actually look like the picture.

Oh I forgot they also give you chips and a salsa cup on the side. (no picture)",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,1,1,4,8JrFTvNyweNIzRspwlpA_A

Sit in the drive thru almost 20 mi utes with only 2 cars in front of me and then when I got my carne Assad fries they barely had anything on it and she didn't give me napkins and I had to ask 2 times before she understood what I said and I also ordered a soda and I ask her for a straw and she said it was in the bag and it wasn't so I'm upset I'm in a drive thru for a reason,lKlxzpRTvMrUTWvUaVlIHA,0,0,1,HXpUBv4xfBafH0HghaiH3w

I think it's extremely inconvenient for the customer and if you want to improve your times... idk maybe just try to do better! 

The last couple times I've went around 1-2am the deep fryers have been down which is half of their menu 
They substituted frys for chips which to me didn't seem comparable.

But customer service is never a problem everyone I've encountered has been pleasant.",3TQ5BGkGc8imRhnC06KNFQ,0,0,2,pjTAhW-QXZ08PKDbI9ioXg

4414556,2018-06-24,0,kkD5pal9rRzE4PjeYSL9mA,"Worst customer service. My father and I had purchased two meals at a Del Taco at Nellis & Craig, and then continued on our journey which took us to Nellis & Stewart. Upon getting back to my fathers car after our errands, We found it wouldn't start (common issue with his vehicle in the heat). So normally He just has to wait for the engine to cool before it can driven again (simply vapor locks). Either way, We took our water bottles into this Del Taco and asked them if we could simply get some water and explained the situation. They told me the water was for paying customers only (I assured them I only wanted water) and even presented my receipt from the other Del taco down the road. She still didn't care and refused me water. In the end, I'm fine with it but she didn't have to have such an attitude. I had even offered for them to fill it if they were concerned about if I was going to take soda, but they just ordered me to leave. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone who's looking to be treated as human. I respect that they may have an issue with people abusing the soda machine in the area but that doesn't mean they should feel empowered to be rude about it. But this is only my opinion so take it at what it's worth to you.",C7YJ5WvJbMqzfFw2e4eA4w,0,0,1,OCw5K6uyPYiq8mk8QS6Y7A
