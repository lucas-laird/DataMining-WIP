We had a caterer scheduled for lunch today at work for Employee Appreciation Week who did a no call/no show, and I called Roberto's to see if they can make 90 tacos within a half hour.  They made three types of tacos within our requested time frame, packed them nicely and helped us load them in the car.  They were delicious!

29442,2014-12-31,0,wT-J6sib_NSr8rcH2aTcAA,"My friends and I decided to come here one night to get our grub on. It was their idea, not mine, since my very delicate constitution needs to be taken into consideration. I ordered the #2 combination plate (burrito, Mexican rice, beans and a bev), since it has rice, and how bad can one foul up rice? We waited a while, and drank our drank. Finally, our order was ready and we got our tray (apparently, more than one tray is not allowed?)
Remember my mentioning of my delicate constitution? Well, I was eating my burrito, and for some reason, I had major intestinal distress. Imagine being a passenger on an airplane and the captain calling in an in flight emergency, it was THAT BAD. I don't know what it is with me and Mexican food, but I needed to vacate my bowels desperately. Luckily, no one was using the (unisex, ugh GROSS!) bathroom, so I quickly excused myself and made it in time.
Now, I was only there for a few minutes, but let me tell you, I believe I saw whole galaxies born and die within that short time frame. The horns that tore down the walls of Jericho could not have reached my ears, with the amount of blood pounding within. I thought I was developing Parkinson's by the amount of uncontrollable shaking.
And then it stopped.
I finished my bathroom routine, washed my hands (because I'm a gentleman), readjusted myself in the mirror and rejoined my friends. They asked if I was doing well, since they mentioned that I ""looked as haggard as a $5 trick in NYC during Fleet Week."" I lied, because the staff was looking over at our table, and said that whilst swallowing, something went the wrong way. I did ask if they would mind trying out some of my burrito, so everybody took a bite and deemed it was fine. So, I figured it must be psychosomatic or something, and continued to eat.
Remember I mentioned fouling up rice? Let me tell you about the rice. Bland little kernels of heated material. Being edible is one thing, but actually trying to put it down is another. Luckily, the grease from the burrito was abundant, so that after a futile amount of gnawing, it could slide down.
Notice how I didn't mention anything about the beans? Between the rice and beans, the rice was manna from Heaven. Discuss.
I decided to continue on with my rapidly congealing burrito. Now mind you, my friends and I are there, chillaxing, talking and eating. So, a bite of the burrito and a swig of the mop water (Pepsi, if you need to know), and conversation. Bite and swig. Bite and swig.
Hello! Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I made it on time once more, and this time I thought I was passing a Toyota. Not a Yaris, but a fully tricked out Avalon XLE Touring Sport Edition. I sweat to God, if I had gripped that metal stabilization bar in the bathroom any harder, I would have left handprints.
I feel sorry for tearing this place down, since I know that the staff is following recipes that they can't deviate from. The staff aren't at fault at all. It's just that something within the recipes themselves makes their food as welcome farting in a crowded elevator. What is it with me and ethnic food?

TL,DR: Between 1) eating Mexican (in this case, Roberto's) or 2) kissing the meth heads north of the Strip full on the lips, 5 full seconds of contact, a litle bit of tongue? Bring on the Blistex.",XHSG6sp-QnW5TSLgeYHm9Q,0,0,1,6V9OWMZq0S-5ufJ5bMmmgA

I usually get the nachos but them chips are extremely fried and hard! Even though As far as calories are concerned the fries are more.. But who's counting calories right?? RIGHT! Service for the most part is what it is.. If you don't speak Spanish at least know how to communicate the # of your item! They definitely nickel and dime you for every one of the extras and it's expensive for just a regular burrito once you finish trying to add in all the extras and substitutes! Portions are always equal to what you pay for! That's why the nachos or fries are the best! Seems everytime I go though the prices increase!,qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,1,0,4,Gsg2BHSgNO-ApDAwPVltiw

Employee of Excellence¬ô 
N/A. Or, Mar√≠a. I'm betting someone somewhere involved with this Roberto's Taco Shop is named Mar√≠a. Let's just say Mar√≠a. Yep: Mar√≠a.

In A Sentence¬ô 
Do not -- under any circumstances -- get the maximum permitted twelve [12] dollar tacos on Taco Wednesday and try to eat them yourself. 

-----------------------------------------¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠-------------------

I used to live near this Roberto's. (Don't ask.) How is this germane: I used to come here habitually. Never had a problem; however, I also never tried the chicken tacos at all. Fast forward two leap years: I find myself on this side of the valley one night and I figure why the fuck not. 

Well: I'll tell you right here why the fuck not!

You might end up on your knees begging for, oh forgive me please, when you're a non-theist.  

Don't do it. Don't get the maximum allowed (per customer) dozen dollar tacos and attempt to consume them all. You'll be sorry. You'll also lose more than a dozen U.S. pounds. That's several kilos for those on the world's system.

Don't do it. 

Get a burrito or something. 

Don't say that no one warned you.

Hubby got a breakfast burrito but there were some mysterious black things that he kept pulling out of it. He also noticed that the ham they used was the cold-cut kind (very cheap low-quality meat).

Now, the person who took my order, is also the person who packaged the food. She did not bother to remember or read the special instructions, thus getting my order wrong.

No big deal, I didn't want the other items anyway, apparently. The taste was almost absent on my enchilada. The chicken taco was good, the beef taco tasted a bit over-fried/crunchy.
