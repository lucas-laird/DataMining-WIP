Everyone at the table had complimentary things to say about their meals! I ordered a cheese sandwich (mmmm-mm yummy provolone) and a roasted tomato soup. The pesto garnish was delicious. I sampled my husbands Asian dish and it was tasty too. The Jasmine rice was moist, the chicken and sweet and sour sauce was good too. The service was really on point thank you Joseph. We noted suddenly that we had run out of time and Joseph helped to get the check handled. Another thing I enjoyed was having the staff ask about our experience as well...Louis the assistant general Mgr was there when I asked for a business card. He was interactive was wanting to make sure we were being helped. This staff seems to work well together.... And we were able to get out the door and on to business. Such a great example of being concerned for  the customers needs. We will definately be back",osOeZnCnZEG5y9_N0Pu0MQ,0,0,5,r5csBkvHqtCLPH9aBn_ENA

More importantly, the portions are really skimpy for the prices. A $13.00 Quesadilla is one small tortilla folded in half with a teaspoon of pico and guacamole. I couldn't believe they could serve it with a straight face, whatever, poor value is poor value.

Had great reccomendations and was very attentive. He never let our coffee cups go dry. If you go make sure to try the chile on your plate. It is spicy but has fantastic flavor.

I would have rather spent time at the pool eating some snacks than at this restaurant for 2 hours... And the food was terrible.  I got an omelet and it tasted like garbage.

Decor-5

As an avid SLS fan (I often visit the Beverly Hills location as well as the South Beach property (I was looking forward to luxury in Las Vegas.

The decor is absolutely gorgeous. It's a great mixture of modern trendiness with sleek elegance. It's spacious and easy to navigate to the restaurant. Bonus points for being 24 hours. 

The waitress was friendly and attentive, although not very knowledgeable about the SPG/Starwood Rewards program. 

My husband and I ordered pancakes, bacon and potatoes. The pancakes field entire plate, but had some type of generic butter. The butter tasted more like oil and butter. Another disappointment was the syrup. Not a recognizable name brand but a type of liquid make sure that was horrific. The pancakes had a doughy consistency that was so unpleasant, both my husband and I refused to eat more than 3 bites each.  Why have pancakes if they aren't sweet? 

The bacon was thick but had over 50% fat, so that wasn't edible either. The potatoes would have been decent if they had served while still hot and had some type of seasoning. 

My overall experience was so disappointing that I felt compelled to write this review. The experience didn't not live up to the image and expectations I have for SLS properties.

The guests behind our booth had the same experience with their food and ate even less of the pancakes then we did.

I can't say that I would recommend this restaurant, even for those looking for a basic late night meal. 

I will be back this year in either July or September as I didn't get a chance to check out the gorgeous Fred Segal shoe boutique inside the SLS hotel.",RBzZjDp1INUPP_jdDxE23g,1,0,1,Wqk5XNN9wz4jXyS4RTM9JQ

Not one of those huge steaks that overwhelms you, but just the right size.  It was perfectly cooked, tender and very flavorful. Simple but excellent. The fries were freshly cooked and served hot. Very tasty. The mixed green salad was also great. A generous portion of spring mixed lettuce served with carrots, tomatoes, goat cheese crumbles and just the right amount of dressing -- a nice red wine vinaigrette.  For dessert, I had a piece of warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream. It seemed homemade and tasted like Grandma had just finished baking it.  The bill for all this and a beer was surprisingly reasonable -- under $45 -- and the service was great.

The best thing it has going for it is that it's open more frequently than the other eating options at SLS. It gets very crowded at breakfast and the staff just can't keep up.

Its hard to find anything vegan on the menu, so I had the roasted veggie wrap. The first time I had it, it was good, but the second time it was swimming in oil. 

It will do when you don't want to leave the hotel, but I certainly wouldn'd go out of my way to eat there.",5pIowDsUzfkoJS4bc5KGBg,1,0,3,AjQtk0xTS6pVE1hFOWYv6A

With that said the service is horrible, to start it took the server, in a mostly empty dinning room, 30 min to attend the table. When he did show up he brought us menus but never asked if we would like a drink. When he finally returned to take our order he still didn't take our drink order and almost left the table before we all gave our order only staying because we had to bring it to his attention. Once the food was delivered he never returned to see if we needed anything else. We had to flag him down to ask for drinks and he again walked away while we were still ordering. Lastly they charge an automatic 20% gratuity to the bill. Needless to say this was the entire meal experience; unimpressive and lacking.

This place works like a well greased machine for breakfast and lunch. Joseph is a real gem there, he should be cloned and spread all over the place. Quick, personable, good salesman but not too pushy. He hooked us on Mojitos there (kudos to the bartender, tasted the same every time. Fantastic) 
The food is solid. Chinese was good but a bit too salty. Looks like the kitchen also serves in room dining (same items) and the pool. You can tell by the quality of food there is a chef with a brain and skill behind this. 

The downside is dinner service. We came a couple of times around 5-7 pm and good luck trying to find a server that cares. I understand this is downtime but basic sequence of service should be followed. At some point there was literally noone on the floor we could ask for anything.

The Yang Chow fried rice and the pan fried noodles was delicious. And our waiters and waitresses were very friendly and accommodating. 

The only thing I didn't like was the pancakes. And we could get Saimin late at night. Will go back there to eat next time we're in Vegas.

Opportunity #1: Eggs Benedict for Breakfast was very underwhelming. 
Opportunity #2: Take away Turkey Club Sandwich around the lunch hour...did not impress, bland. 
Opportunity #3: Late night group meal, combo of breakfast & dinner items. Brought out Buttermilk Pancakes when Blueberry Pancakes were ordered. Speaking of the Blueberry Pancakes, the menu noted inclusion of Blueberry Whipped Cream which ultimately ended up being a large dollop of whipped cream with a handful of blueberries sprinkled on top. Really? Standard eggs, bacon, toast order had the most issues which resulted in sending back the order completely and guest having to share food with others at the table. Eggs & bacon arrived first and 10 minutes later the toast finally arrived only to be warmed bread. The response for reason why toast didn't arrive with the rest of the meal was ""it's made on a conveyor belt"".  Take two with the toast attempt was the exact same result which by then the eggs and bacon are cold so entire meal was sent back. While the order was removed from the bill, we did receive mean eyes from the manager.

So I said sure I'll take two (trying to be positive and make the best of the situation). So anyways I'm still asking about drinks and he interrupts me and just says ""Do you want to get your foo order in?"" So I'm like fine and we order.

Didn't ask how we were, he refilled our water once and that's it. So we ate and enjoyed each other's company, then he took another 20 minutes to get us our bill. Honestly $50 for bs.

Love the SLS but this is a special review just for the chef's and staff of the Northside.  

My contingent only stayed at SLS because a year ago we were trying the previous restaurant that was banging heads in the local culinary landscape at the Hash House a Gogo. We were disappointed when half way through 2015 we found out they had folded up their tent and the SLS has put in some ""version"" of a breakfast place. 

YOU win! Ok, I'm not concerned that the cuttsie names and pancakes the size of a Donk wheel are gone, what we were all glad for, is that the food is delicious, unique ""enough"", fast and the staff is super friendly. Not one breakfast over our tradeshow was spent out of the hotel.

My favorite item is the Greek salad with grilled shrimp added. The salads are always fresh and crisp.  

I've tried the breakfast burrito and found it okay.  Felt like it was missing something but couldn't really say what would improve this dish.  Huge potato pieces in a big burrito were a bit overwhelming but not a bad choice if you are in the mood for a burrito.  Good quality coffee.

Service here is always good.  This restaurant is clean and the open kitchen is immaculate.  Northside Cafe is definitely a solid choice if you are seeking a diner type meal especially at odd hours. Alcohol is available.

Prices are moderate.  Didn't save my check but the Greek salad with shrimp is about $16.00.",P4lN2my6anb7U8Z6s8t5qA,2,2,4,Bo7y3s5mgpu5xiCkB-2Z3A

So in some bites I didn't just end up with a mouth full of potatoes and not being able to enjoy the egg, cheese, peppers,  or the chorizo. It came with a small side of Pico, which honestly I would've preferred salsa. The green chiles salsa added a hint of like flavor which was a great kick.  Over all I enjoyed the burrito and presentation.  Wifey had the Philly cheese steak which was tender and bread was so soft felt like it melted in your mouth. It was superb and I would recommend it. They sell both sides all day.  My server was average nothing was outstanding and there was a 20 min wait for a water refill. The noise level was enjoyable a mixture of music.

This time I tried a divine hot pot! It was fantastic, see the photo!
I also tried the hot and sour soup. Just OK, not fabulous.

Our group was about seven people and we were sad way in the back away from everyone. Back to school I wouldn't say that's odd but typically it seems like African-American people always sat in the world right now away from playing a general population site. Not saying anything about this place here it's just something to think about. If it was all right here. Nothing spectacular and it wasn't terrible that you never come back. It's just not a place you would recommend somebody go to if they were in the Vegas area. If your hungry and at the SLS then sure this is OK to try out. The menu has a great variety of food so there is definitely something there for everyone. All in all I will likely go back because it's close to the SLS pool, but if I'm not staying at the SLS I have no reason to be here.

I looked at the menu posted outside the restaurant and found something I could eat (I'm on a restricted diet). I walked in, was seated and then handed an abbreviated menu. The selection I wanted wasn't served until 6 am. I ordered a salad after inquiring about another menu item. The salad was decent and I waited for my bill. My bill came out to $16.11 and I gave the waiter a $20. He comes back with $3 change. Because I needed a couple of nickles for something I needed to do later, I asked him about my missing $0.89. He went off to go find change and tossed $0.85 in the bill folder on the table. I grabbed a couple nickles and left him a $3.79 tip even though the service was average at best.

You can get anything from traditional diner breakfast to Italian,  Mexican,  and Chinese.  So if it's late night and you don't know what you want, it's a nice spot.  However,  I'm thinking that with this wide variety,  the quality may suffer. 

I ordered the parpadelle with short rib ragu.  Sounds delicious doesn't it? Well I'd say it was an issue with quality of ingredients, and partially preparation.  The short ribs were tough and chewy and not trimmed properly,  and the parpadelle was slightly undercooked. My friend ordered a cheese steak sandwich and her said it was... Ok. 

All in all not too bad,  but not that good.  And we were also waiting to be helped for about 20 minutes before anyone came to the table.  I think it was a miscommunication on who's section the table was in,  so I understand,  but still...

He really enjoyed the blueberry version; the blueberry whipped cream on top was a nice touch. I'm not into sugar for breakfast and couldn't stomach more than a few bites.

But nachos for breakfast? Now you're speaking my language! The Chilaquiles Verdes dish is basically nachos, but they throw on a couple of fried eggs so you can pretend to fit in with your breakfast-loving pals (they're all heathens). Saucy, spicy, and crunchy, it's a party in your mouth- and one I'd get again.

Blood. The waitress acted as if it was ketchup....... disgusting. Being 2:30 am I decided to brush that off and order food anyhow. We got popcorn shrimp and the club. My fiance decided on a Cucumber Margarita which sounded delicious. The waitress returned 5 minutes later to tell us they ran out of cucumber....... I mean really? She then settled for a Strawberry Margarita. Ten minutes later our food arrived. The popcorn shrimp where falling apart on a bed of stale popcorn. Worth the price....... I don't think so. The club was ok to say the least. Twenty minutes later the Margarita arrived looking more like a Bloody Mary. One taste out of this beverage turned stomachs. Being a Bartender myself, I take pride in my drinks but this was something else. The over pour of spirit was terrible. The strawberry syrup that was used was very sad. Half down one side of the glass was a sugary substance that our waitresses hands where all over. Presentation was a zero and taste was in the negatives! Tasted like it came out of a warm slurpy machine in a Third World 7-11. Terrible! It was a sad example of why some Hotels aren't what they are cracked up to be.

We ordered a pretty large order, and it was to go (to our room of course) since there was a huge line outside. The service was extremely slow, as we stood there to pay at the bartender for almost 20 minutes before we were acknowledged.

When we finally got our food, we took it upstairs, and turns out they had a bunch of items wrong. They gave us a chicken wrap instead of a club sandwich (the wrap was extremely salty). They forgot the frosting for our pancakes so we had extremely dry pancakes. The salad was super soggy and droopy, and the burger was falling apart. The tacos were decent. I am sure if we had dined in most of these issues had not occurred, but after waiting to even be acknowledged for so long, I did not even want to bother with going back at that moment. 

However, we did call in to let them know, and they did offer to switch out our wrap for the turkey club and give us the frosting & some syrup for the pancakes. 

We grabbed the food in a hurry left, and upon checking later in the car... Turns out we had gotten  the turkey club sandwich, and yet again no frosting or syrup for the pancakes. At this point we threw out the pancakes, and the turkey club had old tomatoes, so that ended up in the trash too, and we went elsewhere. 

Like I said, it may have been a different experience if we had dined in, but after everything we went through, the quality of the food and service was just awful.",DAras3WY2ubz2idUU-g8Tw,0,0,2,x84AG7Oyr01ldBXNRAAJSw

I had the nutella french toast with whipped cream; it was perfectly done and not soggy at all ( I stopped eating french toast as a child because everyone who made it for me, made it soggy- I actually thought that it was supposed to be that way- yuck).  I added a side a bacon and shared that with the boyfriend; four thick slices come with it.  The boyfriend had buttermilk pancakes which he was as equally satisfied with- they were light and fluffy and a nice big serving.
The good- All patrons seemed to be satisfied with their food.
The bad and it's bad- I'm not sure if the hostess was nervous or what.  There seemed to be an abundance of kitchen staff and waiters but she wasn't seating people. AND there were plenty of booths and table tops. We just stood in the line and she would come to the line and ask how many people every now and then-she didn't write any of this down. After 15 minutes in line she came and asked the couple in front of me if there were only two in their party-she left and didn't return although there were 3 2-tops available. My boyfriend spotted two people leaving the bar so he left the line and claimed the seats-I followed shortly and the family behind me left.  The couple in front of me finally got sick of waiting for one of the empty tables and  joined us at the bar twenty minutes later.  At least 6 tables stayed empty for half of our meal although there was a line and plenty of staff to handle them. 

Note to Management: Your food is great- I would hate to see you lose great customers.  Please assist the hostess and come up with a better way of seating and serving customers when you have a full staff available.",c81S8Z490_qvX7ccyswL-w,3,0,3,HnSNtwafWWhIuCm1dFLq5w

The Northside Cafe delivered on both counts.  The staff was friendly and attentive; there was not one moment where I was waiting for my drink to be refilled.  The food took a little bit longer than I expected (maybe 15 minutes for a burger and fries); however, it was well worth the wait.  The food was not only generously portioned; it was also delicious!

I am in love with the Buffalo chicken wings. I just can't seem to get enough of them. They are perfectly sauce and cooked. I always get two orders now, even if I can't finish it as I know I'll eat it later.

The service has always been good. I've also tried other good such as the Buffalo chicken wrap, cashew chicken, the burger, and their chicken tenders. The wrap was good, the burger was okay, the cashew chicken sucked, and the chicken tenders were amazing. Since they ran out of chicken wings, we asked to get the tenders covered I'm buffalo sauce... And omg they were delicious with their ranch sauce.

I'm in love with this place now :). Especially since it's open till 4 or 5 am! it's perfect for lunch, dinner, or for late night drunk food.



Previous review:

After arriving to the hotel at midnight, not many places were open. The hotel receptionist recommended me and my friend to come here as it  was open late.

Leta say I wasn't disappointed. We ordered wings, dumplings, King pao chicken, noodles, and Margarita.

All of it tasted really good, especially the wings, the King pao chicken and the Margarita. I was pleasently surprised and woild definitely come here again. The wings had delicious buffalo sauce on it with a side of ranch. Both the sauces were made in house and I could easily tell by the viscosity, they weren't as thick as the usual ranch and as thin as the usual buffalo sauce. The kung pao chicken was perfectly cooked with perfect amount of sauce.

Dinner: Ordered the orange chicken-- you have to pay $2 separate for regular WHITE rice. I get that it's Vegas but talk about nickel and diming. Also ordered some dumplings and chicken tenders. The orange chicken was pretty legit, hot, flavorful and tasted good. 4/5 stars. The tenders were also good, no messing those up. The dumplings however, were absolutely terrible and inedible. They were pork and shrimp dumpling and smelled like rotten seafood. The smell penetrated the container and smelled horrendous, -2/5. 

The service was questionable. I needed an extra silverware set, and asked for one. The guy at the counter let me know what he didn't have any more sets to give. I told him I was staying at the hotel and needed one. He says again, ""I really don't have any more"" mind you, I'm STARING at a cup filled with regular non-disposable silverware. I finally ask for the in house flatware and he grudgingly gives it to me. Next time, try to problem solve instead of telling a customer you don't have a necessary item to eat the food they just ordered. 

Breakfast: this was a more change. We were promptly seated with a kind waitress and ordered. Got the whole hog omelette and  the breakfast burrito. Both came out hot and fresh, and tasted absolutely delicious. The serving sizes were plentiful, and the service was great. 5/5.",lEhdamdwWSh_n-nlmoi9ow,0,0,3,YGWq9nXuqv4DLOIxlYHMAQ

However, I would give the the food and coffee a 2.5. We came here for breakfast - we ordered coffee, a breakfast burrito and eggs Benedict. When I added milk to my coffee, it curdled up and floated in chunks to the top. Gross. I told the waitress and she got me a new coffee and milk. The new one had one small curdle but I drank it anyway because I am a coffee fiend and was coffee-deprived. The coffee was also very weak...you could see right through it (see my picture). We didn't want to complain and wait again so we just drank it. The second refill was better. The cups were tiny though (I'd say 4 ounces) and they cost $4 each with free refills. We only got two cups each and were not offered additional refills before getting the check. We saw other people walking out with to-go cups so we asked for the same. I kind of expected the coffee to be taken off the bill (since the milk was spoiled)  but it wasn't.

My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Milanese-lightly breaded & pan friend chicken breast with garlic toasted kale. He said the chicken was way too thick....and dried. He enjoyed his kale so much better.

I was looking for good Chinese dim sum, like the picture outside the building. What we got was a highly confused menu- part Mexican, part Chinese; at least that's what the names of the food implied. What we actually got was oily yuck. If one has dry skin, then one visit here and that person will be sweating oil for days upon days. The Baja taco, the won tons, and the tortilla chips had all been fried together and equally, had no flavor. The cook forgot to drain the oil, but certainly remembered the salt.

Yes, I know they used to be Griddle Cafe (which I am sorry for not doing a review even though I have visited twice already), so I had mixed expectations. Well, im here to tell you that the generous portions are no more. :(

My wifey ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes ($12.95) with a Latte ($3.75) and I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak ($14.95).

Like before, I have ordered the Golden Ticket when it was GC. It was 3 huge pancakes about 12 inches in diameter. (That's what SHE said). For these guys, it was more like 6 inches. Basically, same price but half the size. The Red Velvet pancakes themselves were pretty good. Fluffy with some sweetness to it. Topped off with a cream cheese frosting and chocolate shavings. The latte was decent.

The Philly Cheesesteak was a pretty good size. Has thinly sliced strips of grilled sirloin mixed with grilled onions and melted provolone cheese. It came with a side so I chose sweet potato fries which were very good. Puts regular fries to shame.

Service was good. Kailena was our server and did not disappoint. Took our orders and brought our food out in a timely manner. Even refills on our waters were done without asking for it.

In closing, everything was on point. I only spent $17.10 because of the 50 percent discount plus 5 bucks tip. When I say on point I mean the price I paid was worth it. Under normal circumstances I would not come back to pay the marked up prices for what you get. The locals discount is what will bring me back because what you can get here is what you can probably get for half that at some other restaurants. It's good to be a local. Oh and they are open 24 hours.

2892375,2015-09-08,2,IRzXVRIzRoYpnjaVXF3vNA,"Located inside the SLS, Northside Cafe is the only restaurant open 24/7 with a wide selection of American and Chinese foods. It's located right across from the pool entrance and also next to the other Chinese restaurant. Entrees are on the expensive side and the taste quality doesn't match the $$$ tag. The room service food you order come from the kitchens inside Northside Cafe. 

Ambience (4/5): Restaurant is very sleek looking. Cafe was never empty the two times I was there, tons of occupied tables. There are both large booths and small tables for any party size. Great place for people watching too, as you get get all sorts of people walking into grab a bite.

Food (2.5/5): I ordered the beef chow fun and the Char Su buns. Beef chow fun had a great taste despite there being way more vegetables than actual noodles and protein. The char su buns was a disappointment though. Despite its high price point for two small buns ($6), the buns were not  made in-house. Most likely ordered from a frozen food purveyor. the bun texture was very doughy and didn't have much meat inside. 

Service (4/5): Table was not very clean when I was seated. I had to ask one of the staff members to wipe it again. Otherwise, service was excellent. 

I would definitely try Northside Cafe again if I find myself on the North side of the strip late at night. I would just stay away from the Asian menu/selection.",wczP8ehoY_SWCRRLFuSNrg,3,2,3,s47V14SLiU6q6NgSALp1DQ

2911641,2016-02-22,8,IRzXVRIzRoYpnjaVXF3vNA,"Ehh.

Quite the disappointment. I had been looking forward to trying Northside Cafe for quite a while. 

Tonight, while doing some gambling at the SLS, we decided to grab a bite to eat here.

Ordered-

- Combination Fried Rice ($11.95) with pork, shrimp, and chicken
- Orde of Chicken Wings (plain) ($9.95) with ranch sauce on the side
- 1 side order of Garlic Mashed Potatoes ($6.95)
- 1 Diet Pepsi, 1 Water

(+) Service was probably the best thing about this experience, as the young lady who waited on us was friendly and attentive, certainly no complaints regarding the service
(+) chicken wings were actually pretty good! Only 6 to an order, but at least they were tasty.

(-) garlic mashed potatoes were a huge disappointment. First, the portion size was pathetic. This was roughly about 6-7 bites. This should have run $3 at the most. $6.95 is downright criminal. Plus their definition of garlic was ready mix mashed potatoes with a few garlic dices on top. Very disappointing.
(-) Combo Fried Rice was plentiful in portion, but extremely bland. At least I know they don't use any MSG in their Chinese foods. That dish was way too bland to have included any measurable amount of MSG!

Maybe one day we will return to try some of the breakfast menu items, but this was a bit of a letdown and I don't see myself going out of my way to go back..

Maybe I will try Ku Noodle next...after all I am one of those rare locals that actually likes playing at the SLS...

for Northside Cafe though, it will have to be..

2 stars.

The food: Mixed reaction here: Husband said it was ""good""--even though they brought him a different entree than what he ordered (he was too hungry to send it back)...I found the Chinese cuisine to be simply meh--not horrible, but not Wow! or anything.

The options at the SLS aren't that great but Northside Cafe looked promising (for a Cafe in a casino).

Me and wife but got breakfast options,  the ham steak and eggs and corned beef hash.   The ham steak and eggs was good and a the portion size was decent...the corned beef hash was also pretty good (massive amounts of butter!) but the portion size was comically small.

The bloody mary was decent and oddly enough the standout item from this meal was the piece of Rye toast I got with my ham steak and egg.  For some reason it was just really delicious.

It would have been nice to know that when we told you that we we locals before we ordered. Whatever.

I probably wouldn't have been that annoyed if the food had actually been worth the price. It wasn't. Northside is mostly traditional cafe fare you can find pretty much anywhere. The fries from my burger were cold and had clearly been sitting there for a while. The street tacos were tiny. Fortunately the banana pancakes were good, a hold over on the menu from the previous Griddle Cafe. 

Service was a disaster from start to finish. 30 minute wait time and food took forever to come out. We had to flag down our server for refills and to get our order in. I understand  that all new restaurants have issues starting off but this was just a catastrophe. 1 star! Smh all day.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,10,1,1,wDKxb95wJ1Aq4qL0LDd5Fw

3400240,2015-08-25,4,IRzXVRIzRoYpnjaVXF3vNA,"How is it that a notoriously cheap curmudgeon such as myself can give four stars to typically over-priced hotel coffee shop? Because it's pretty frickin' good, that's why! 

I will state my objections and get them out of the way first: It is small, crowded, and noisy. Booths would fit four normal-sized adults (which describes no one in my family), and other than that, they have only tables for 2, so don't go with a crowd. A great deal of the noise is due to the fact that is seems to be perpetually busy in here, which I guess is a good sign, although it also means there's a line, which one normally only encounters at a buffet.

I also wasn't crazy about the decor - the ubiquitous brick and dark industrial gray that seems to be the signature color of hipsters everywhere, and the too-loud background music did nothing for me, but maybe this was the ambience they were going for. 

But now that I have finished complaining that it's not Denny's, let me tell you the good part: it's not Denny's! The wait staff is very prompt, friendly, and noticeably young. I pointed this out to the Anaconda, and we agreed that it's a definite contrast to your usual Las Vegas coffee shop wait staff where at least a couple of the employees have been there since sage brush was growing in the parking lot.

But the best thing is, as it should be, the food. What a surpise! The Eggs Benedict  ($14) were great- perfectly cooked, runny yolks, smokey bacon (or ham, who cares?), nice tender potatoes, and a really great Hollandaise; rich and lemony and not from a mix. The Whole Hog omelette  ($14) was so good, the Anaconda wanted to get one again the next day, but I wouldn't let him because I wanted to try the caramelized banana pancakes, so he ordered those and I had steak and eggs. For $18, I was prepared to be picky since you can get a decent special for $4 around town, but this steak was tender and juicy and the bread was thick sliced and tasted homemade. It was even good when it got a little cold because I was busy battling the Anaconda over those pancakes.

Normally, I am not a fan, because I find them heavy and akin to trying to eat a blanket. These were more like pillows. Light and tender and airy and topped with caramelized bananas and optional crunchy streusel topping. Yum. And in case that's not sweet enough for you (it wasn't), the accompanying bottle of maple syrup will put it over the top. Wash it down with a shared pot of French pressed coffee, and the noisy crowd will disappear around in a euphoric haze.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,4,4,4,vw2HsoEpRme_J4HwtPvU1A

Experience yesterday did not enable me to unfortunately. 

I came to redeem a food offer id received and went for what i had hoped to be a quick and smooth business lunch, which did not turn out to be the case. 

First: fries came out cold - but i kept eating them because thats what i do... and i was mad at myself for it. 

Second: I understand that not every place can cook a burger to order, but just don't ask how i want it if you're clearly not going to attempt to do it that way.

Third: service was slow. Took about 10 minutes from getting the bill to leaving, and the place wasn't even crowded. This was particularly annoying because we were in a bit of a hurry. 

I know this restaurant just got started (at least in its current branding).... so i'm really leaving this review in hopes they can turn it around.

3536058,2015-09-26,1,IRzXVRIzRoYpnjaVXF3vNA,"I would come back here strictly for the COFFEE! If based soley on the food, It would probably only get 2 stars. 

THE FOOD: I will start with the coffee. Freshly ground beans in a french press. When I started working full time, I started drinking coffee to get through the day. I didn't like it much but it kept me up... Then I started having REAL coffee... not folgers, and actually really enjoy the flavor. The coffee they make here is GREAT. They only serve french press and they offer 2 sizes. The regular is enough for 2 people (about 3 cups). I did not order the large but it seems like a pretty hefty amount. So, to eat i ordered a breakfast burrito, which i was somewhat disappointed with. It was large and filling but not very flavorful, and the guacomole, sourcream, and pico de gallo was on top of the burrito... I don't know about most people but I like my ingredients on the inside. The potatoes, which at least were inside, were too big. They might has well have wrapped a baked potato in a tortilla. Call me spoiled from Southern California, but It should not take multiple bites to finish one cube of potato in a breakfast burrito. I don't ask for a burger with the ketchup on top of the bun. My girlfriend ordered a Reuben which was definitely better. Go with that.

THE PRICE: A moderate price for Vegas. $14 for the breakfast burrito and $14 for the Reuben. The coffee was $5 which is pricey, but remember you get about 3 cups worth, so it isn't too bad. 

THE VIBE: The Northside Cafe is located in the SLS hotel near the pool, with a pretty casual setting, tables, and bar seating. The staff i encountered was pretty friendly. It is open 24 hours and perfect for a hungover morning, a meal after a dip in the pool, or a late night snack coming back from the clubs. 

OVERALL: The food isn't bad, but if you are a coffee person staying at the SLS Hotel and Casino or even at a nearby hotel trying to get a morning ""pick me up"", swing by the bar in the back of the Northside cafe and take a french press to go. You're day will go a lot smoother.",YeRUBbDfgFhi022ZfJnZyg,0,0,4,zyObwtL7J9kFoEz4uuPoYA

We stayed at the W hotel which is located ""inside"" the SLS hotel so it was really easy to walk downstairs and grab food whenever.

I ordered a Huevos Rancheros for $15 ish and thought it was super odd that mine would come on a hard shell taco instead of the usual soft tortillas which was really my fault bc it did state ""hard shelled taco"" on the menu :(. The meat also tasted like canned minced meat which I really wasn't a fan of...sorry I've been spoiled with the super cheesy, soft, melty ones you find in the mom & pop Mexican restaurants in Cali...

The Chinese menu is solid, I will be going again for more when I get the bad taste of their (lack of) service out of my mouth.

+ Hot and Sour Soup: Bold vinegar flavor with lots of tofu, bamboo, and wood-ear mushroom floating about. Came to me boiling hot, even with the 5 minute commute to my hotel room. 
+ Yang Chow Fried Rice: Interestingly included shredded iceberg lettuce in the mix. Shrimp were few but larger sized than other places.

+/- Pan Fried Dumplings: Three to an order, very juicy and well seasoned without being overly salty. Some pieces of pork in the filling were too grisly to chew so I wouldn't order this again.

- Staff will not offer you any updates or apologies while you are waiting at the counter for 20+ minutes after the promised time. They will not offer you something to eat while you wait, they will not apologize, they will not make eye contact with you, they will not acknowledge your presence at all.

I ordered the pork carnitas torta.  This is a large sandwich and plan to cut it and eat it in pieces.  If you attempt to pick it up and eat it like a hamburger, you'd better have big hands and a big mouth to match.  It is filled with goodness.  With the carnitas are cotija cheese, jalape√±o crema, charro beans, onion, lettuce, tomato, and avocado.  With the sandwich I got fries.  You have a choice of regular fries, sweet potato fries, or fresh fruit.

The sandwich was on a large hamburger style bun, not the oval shaped torta I had expected but that's a minor critique.  It was tasty and messy eating and good eating.

Service was very good.  As soon as I sat down, a server was there to take a drink order and someone arrived with a menu and asked for a drink order.  Eddie was my main server and he was efficient and friendly.

We live across the street, so we've eaten here twice out of sheer convenience. The first time we came it was late at night and this place has a ""seat yourself"" setup. The servers here are just not very attentive. Do not eat here if you are ever in a hurry. Tonight we went in, and it's a Saturday night. There were about 10 tables.

Three employees looked super confused when he pulled up our check on their screen. The manager came to our table, his attitude seemed less than apologetic face to face, but he said he would comp us 25% of our check and gave me a ticket for a free dessert. The price ended up at an amount WAY less than what we actually ate, so I don't think they actually had a record of our meal? I'm not an entitled princess, so I left a 20% tip anyway.

Northside has a diverse menu; with breakfast offered all day and dinner options ranging from burgers and salads to pasta or steak as well as options from the chinese kitchen. My chicken fried rice was fine, nothing exceptional, but decent flavor and a good sized portion. My friend had the pan fried noodles and really enjoyed them. Pricing for the items we got were fair for the portion size and on strip location. 

Service left a bit to be desired. The one time our waters were refilled my glass was completely overfilled and water spilled all over the table and my lap. The server didn't even notice, I had to take napkins from the empty tables nearby to clean up the mess he made. We were not checked on after receiving our food. 

As a local I have very little reason to go to the W, and I would not return to dine at Northside Cafe based on the subpar service and average food.

It wasn't very busy, but being the only decent priced breakfast place, it was our only option since we were staying at SLS. A girl came and took our drink orders, that was fine. Then this guy server took over. It just went downhill. 3 of us got out orders in decent time but the other 3 didn't get our food for another 15 mins. We ordered 2 pots of coffee with 4 cups. They brought 3 and we had to ask 3 times to bring the 4th. Then, after all the food had arrived and we were eating, I realized my soup did not come. I asked the server when he finally walked by and he acted like he forgot, but it's coming. Another person at our table had soup and she got it early so obviously he forgot. Then, we got an entree delivered that we did not order. Ok...what was this server doing?? My friend ordered a wrap where you can pick a choice of sides: Fries, sweet potato fries, Etc. pretty standard. She choose sweet potato. Our server however thought she wanted a whole separate side of fries and ordered her a side of sweet potato and her wrap came with regular fries. Why would she want that??? Finally, after hunting him down for the bill, there were 3 things wrong!!! Omg! Banana pancakes, we did not order. 2 flatbreads (which we did order, but 1 did not ever arrive!), side of sweet potato fries ($5.95!) and an 20% added gratuity. Ohhh... so THATS why the service sucked!! I spoke with the manager about the many errors and she didn't really care because he brought back the bill and only took the sweet potato fries off and not the other 2 things that we didn't get.

4363939,2015-05-24,2,IRzXVRIzRoYpnjaVXF3vNA,"Given it's self-proclaimed reputation as the ""foodie"" hotel on the (northernmost reaches of the) Strip, the food options at SLS weren't that spectacular.  Aside from several chains, there were few really compelling options.  Thus, my friends and I ended up at Northside Caf√©, which served somewhat affordable (~$10-$20) American fare in a casual environment.  

The restaurant had an extensive breakfast menu that continued to be served through lunch, and had an array of lunch items ranging from tacos and wraps to burgers and sandwiches.  The staff was friendly, but didn't offer substantive answers regarding questions about their food.  Since I have food allergies, I would have liked the staff to actually take the initiative to ask the kitchen about ingredients if they weren't entirely sure about the contents of one of my selections.  Nevertheless, I was generally satisfied with what I ordered:

Barbacoa Tacos:
Overall, I would highly recommend the barbacoa tacos.  After I had ordered, the waitress mentioned that this was one of their most popular items, and it was clear why.  The meat was delicious, tender, and juicy.  If you've had barbacoa at Chipotle, then I would say that this was much more flavorful.  On top of the barbacoa, were decent portions of salsa, guacamole, and cilantro.  The side dish featured charro beans, which had a mixture of cheese, meat, and beans.  I didn't sample this dish since I'm allergic to dairy products, but my friend who sampled it gave it the thumbs up.  The one drawback to this dish was the fact that you only received two tacos for $12-13.  While the tacos were filling, I would have felt more comfortable paying that price if I had received at least one more taco.

If you're staying at SLS and want something somewhat more affordable than some of the higher end fare, Northside Cafe definitely fits the bill.  But, keep in mind that the food is pretty typical of what you could find elsewhere.",ZMc68qAU0oKEbJqercHPYA,4,0,3,sOJ_ztqufhuPwpRZim7XZg

The bad, it is outrageously priced.
Portion sizes are large however. I had a Rigatoni I could not finish and was delicious. 
My wife ordered a fish that she ate and said nothing about. 
My son, and this is where the rating went down, ordered Nachos. That is simple enough. But, he did not want Jalapenos on it and specified it. He was disappointed when it came out clearly with Jalapenos on it. He decided to try his hand at telling the waiter. He very politely said he was disappointed it had Jalapenos on it. The waiter brushed it off by saying it was due to the pico de gallo. UH NO! We looked first and tried that. It was all over the large plate, inside and out. You messed up, just apologize no excuses. They did correct it by sending a new plate quickly with no pico di gallo. Now it was just the ample beef, sour cream and nachos. 
What you could have done, apologized and offered to take it off the bill or complimentary dessert. NOPE. Just the excuse was offered. We can tell the difference between something mixed into a condiment and fresh Jalapeno thrown onto the plate and in the nachos. 

So, high price and doing poorly on something very easy to put together results in a lower rank.

On the other hand, the food is quite greasy and generic. The Mexican-inspired entr√©es lack zing, while the American brunch items feel like something I could get at any average Joe's diner. The prices do reflect the portion size, but they are still a bit high comparing to what you can get outside of the hotel. Guess you are always paying a little extra for the location ;)

Ambience:  Very chill cafe style restaurant.  Not terribly big.  But I loved the fact that they had seating at the bar.  
Service:  Really good.  I was served by one of the bartenders right away.  Drink ordered was placed and food ordered taken soon after.  It was easy for to get refills on my drink.  Check came out right away.  No complaints with the service.
Food:  First off, their coffee is a frenched pressed brew.  It was impressive and delicious.  There menu had a little of everything (including mexican and traditional breakfast).  I had their meat lover omelette (or something like that) and bagel and cream cheese.  Omelette and potatoes were pretty good.  All of the condiments are on the table including multiple hot sauces.  Bagel was nicely toasted and the cream cheese nicely whipped.

We also ordered the Orange Chicken, also good but not too much of a orange flavor sauce. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was very tasty and the shrimp was big. It was on the pricey side of $16.95, but worth it. Actually, all of their prices were a little on the higher-end, in my opinion.  The Eggplant Tofu was just okay. We agreed that it lacked flavor, almost like it needed more of a garlic or ginger taste, or both, even maybe a little more salt, which is unusual since Chinese food is usually really salty.

Service was extremely slow: The place is absolutely empty but we receive service like it's jam packed with clients. 

Extremely subpar service from waiter: 
-I ask the waiter what he prefers from the menu. He shares, ""I don't know just pick."" 
-Later, we ask for straws and he tells us that they ""ran out of straws"". My first thought is, 'Where they do dat at?' Anyway, we go out of our way to find a busboy who gives us straws on the spot. When the waiter comes back and sees that we have straws, he looks stifled and upset. From that point on he only returned to the table to give us the bill. 

Here's my assessment:
The Griddle House brought high hopes for dining at SLS. Unfortunately, NSC is not holding its own properly. Northside Cafe will need to step up its game either through new management, servers and menu to stay in the market.",lyqGsGMchZCA8rc1uX1gsA,6,2,1,wk7jjaS9qwsSQNlSJtgQbg

I was told by the Northside cafe manager that the las vegas local that they meant was the surrounding apartments and pretty much within SLS vicinity. 
 
 I'm not big on writing reviews but this place was just too much!  I had breakfast there this morning and the hostess specifically gave us the ""local secret menu"" instead of the regular menu. We were seated at the bar and the service was ok and the food was ok too for the price that was on that local menu. When I asked for the bill I noticed that I was charged with the full price from the regular menu. When I asked the server why I was charged full price all he said was ""oh you're supposed to have a little sticker on your code card and there's nothing I can do about it"" and this guy is holding my nevada ID with las vegas address on it!

The decor is a bit greyscale for me, but it works - imagine a desaturated fifties dinner with an industrial modern twist. The waiter was great - quick, friendly, and accurate and the place was clean.

We're both on a health kick, so we needed to modify our orders a tad.  I had the protein frittata with added mushroom and no toast and he ordered the steak and eggs with added spinach and no potato and no bread.

The order came out perfect - eggs over medium, steak medium rare. Everything was perfect. The food itself was good

5279506,2015-08-27,5,IRzXVRIzRoYpnjaVXF3vNA,"Likely one of the most saddened persons in Las Vegas when The Griddle Cafe at SLS suddenly shuttered, but impressed by Northside Cafe during a substantial breakfast just days after the switch, it was on the invite of SBE's Director of Dining that myself and five friends sat down to experience the restaurant's newly launched dinner and late night menus this past Saturday - a total of 32 plates showing a great degree of diversity with the majority far better than one would expect from 24/7 dining, though one specific section proved barely passable at best.

Admitting up front that the experience was fully comped, a few requests made of the kitchen while the vast majority of the items were served carte blanche, it was at a large booth in the far corner of the room that our party was sat and with IHeartRadio playing lightly overhead the meal was presented with exemplary service, first bites of shrimp atop popcorn perhaps a bit *too* clever for their own good while the stack of banana pancakes served a strong reminder of the high quality marking my aforementioned breakfast, the pure maple syrup presented steaming hot and drizzled liberally to our heart's content.

Opting next to send out dinner entrees, the later rounds focused on recently launched dim sum and Chinese plates, Northside Cafe certainly is not skimping on ingredient quality as both the rib eye and filet were served a juicy medium rare, the trio of snappy shrimp deftly doused in garlic while asparagus and potatoes were both as good as upscale steakhouse fare.

Blase as ever about salmon, the fish itself nicely cooked though a bit lost amidst all the brightly citrus sauce, a duo of pastas was presented simultaneously with far more balance, the fettuccine cooked perfectly al dente with heavy cream laced inn garlic while the cheesy pockets of ravioli were quickly devoured by the left half of the table, the simplicity of the crushed tomatoes and herbs praised by an Italian at the table reminiscing of his grandmother's red sauce.

Transitioning abruptly to Chinese, the next nine plates offered on a newly launched list of dim sum, suffice it to say that substantial tweaks are needed before this part of the menu can be appropriately recommended, the fried items by far the best of the group while pork was sticky and far too sweet, the steamed options universally overcooked as if by an inexperienced hand,

Admittedly shocked by the drop in quality, and soon to become even more confused by the fact that actual Chinese entrees were confidently prepared as if by an entirely different kitchen compared to those sent out before, it was to a whole steamed bass that eyes were next widened, the flesh rich and moist with a delicate bit of lemon and lovely top-notes of scallions and lemongrass.

At this point already overserved, some items boxed for home while others unfortunately went to waste, it was still to nine more full-size plates that the slowly dwindling table was treated, the salt and pepper  dazzling beneath delicate batter while fried rice, chow fun, and everything made with noodles was on par with the best of Spring Mountain Road, without too substantial a hike in price.

Dining partners already waiving the white flag, or at least folding napkins and debating the pros and cons of renting a room within the hotel rather than carrying the food coma home, it was with five desserts that the evening would end and although the cookie was far less 'gooey' than one may have expected there was no lack of quality anywhere else, the fruited options each outstripping modest expectations while the peanut butter cup studded cheesecake was silky, smooth, and not oversweetened, the bread pudding taking the opposite path in offering the steamy custard block topped in ice cream with a shallow pool of golden brown sauce.

****Offering better food than almost any 24/7 spot in Las Vegas, with prices far more forgiving for comparable items than at places further South on the Strip, Northside Cafe continues to impress on a level far greater than passers-by may notice, the dim-sum menu a lone exception while breakfast, dinner, Chinese plates, and desserts offer plenty of well-priced hits.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,10,4,MGgDRUrO_ssnjXn_QFgIJg

5320566,2018-04-11,0,IRzXVRIzRoYpnjaVXF3vNA,"I have to say. For a restaurant with A LOT of options, it really does a pretty good job with quality.

I'm spoiled by the delicious and authentic food in Hollywood so I was a little skeptical of this place.

I've had breakfast here every day, usually ordering the side of egg whites with a side of wheat toast (I ask for no butter) and a coffee (only $11). I don't eat much in the morning so this suited me best.

I tried the bean and rice bowl (no cheese, no meat) and it was delicious. The kung pao chicken isn't bad. It's not authentic, but you get the decent flavor you're asking for.

I also tried the wonton soup. This is why I deducted one star. The wontons were just meatballs wrapped in wonton paper and they were completely bland with absolutely no seasoning or flavor. This grossed me out so I left them alone. The soup was okay and so were the noodles. I just added the chili paste to give it life.

Today I tried their oatmeal for breakfast and it's okay. I don't normally like oatmeal but I'm trying to eat better so that's on me, not them.

I will say the service varies. My first time eating here was mediocre. The rest of the times were very pleasant.

I recommend it for their options if you're in the SLS hotel and hungry. Their prices are a bit high (per normal in Vegas), but they're reasonable compared to other places in this hotel.

I would definitely come back.",fj-0O-jBhsgpwGPGYU7NUA,0,0,4,pp7uH2pA-aqz1y6d_ReW_Q
5332231,2017-06-09,0,IRzXVRIzRoYpnjaVXF3vNA,"Service was very good but that's where the goodness stopped. 

It was late so we opted to choose a few selections off of the Chinese small plates menu, although they do serve non-Chinese entrees as well. I thought since it was a Chinese cafe, the Chinese food would possibly be better. Nope. 

We started with the Hot & Sour soup. It was decent. A little thicker than I'm used to. It was much heavier than a broth consistency. Otherwise, it was pretty traditional. It actually was a tiny bit hot which I really appreciate. The flavor was okay. 

Next, the pork steamed buns, which took 20+ minutes to prepare per the server, were undercooked and doughy. This is one of my favorite dishes and I do know how it is when cooked correctly. They barely had any pork in them at all either. It was more of a very thin smear of pork paste when I opened it to see if it actually had any pork in it after not having any in my first 2-3 bites. The flavor was also missing. 

We also tried the pan fried dumplings. It was a combo of pork and shrimp. This did not work. At all. Weirdest fishy flavor ever. 

Next we ordered the veggie spring rolls because we were 0-2. They were okay. Traditional but again, no flavor. 

I would certainly skip this place unless it's after hours and it is the only restaurant in the SLS/W that is open 24/7.  But I would suggest staying away from the Chinese menu. I saw a pasta dish come out that looked good. 

In all fairness though, this cafe does the room service for the W and breakfast the following morning was good. I had the breakfast burrito and I would order it again. So I give 3 stars for that instead of the 2 stars originally planned.",YInUZBqHfMAwKA9no3Zftg,0,0,3,WrYKAe0ugBOvVvZ1IO_92Q

Our Server, Wesley was there to greet us almost as soon as we sat down and was friendly and attentive throughout our meal. We started with The Shrimp Cocktail. A solid version of a Vegas classic. Six large, plump, sweet shrimp curled over a glass full of spicy cocktail sauce.

After  our earlier Vegas Taco Fiasco at Pink Taco, I had to try Northside's Baja Fish Taco's.  Spiced, Seared Mahi-Mahi, Pickled Slaw, Pico de Gallo, Cilantro and Sour Cream restored my faith in Vegas Taco possibilities. Flavorful and moist, I loved every bite! Diane had the Pork Carnitas Torta with Cotija Cheese, Charro Beans,
Jalape√±o Crema, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and Avocado. She loved it so much I only got one little taste of the meat. What I had was rich and spicy.

Since this was a celebratory trip for us, we had several drinks. Diane's Spiked Lemonade was Sweet, Summery and packed quite a punch! After two she was feeling a little buzzed. I started with an excellent Peach Bellini and followed that up with my favorite drink of the trip. Unfortunately, I don't remember the name, but it was a play on a Mudslide.

If I didn't finish working 12 hours on my feet I would have stopped right there, but I'm starving so I quickly get the contents out of the bag and get it as far away from me as possible.

The girl on the phone says they can either bring up a new one, or take it off my bill.

The food was pretty good although the room itself was very loud and our waitress was fairly unattentive.

As you may know by reading my reviews I always go back to the value of the meal and experience and this one was really a miss in both!

Even though the food was good the pricing was a little high and overall between poor service and a loud room I wouldn't go back.

Vegas offers very few opportunities for social interaction and this spot isn't one of them.

Very spacious lots of tables and booths, and it's self seating.

We originally came for the $12 prime rib only to find out it's a deal that only happens on Fridays but we decided to stay and check it out anyways. 

They have a weird half and half style where they have a full menu just of Chinese food and a menu just with cafe food ie. burgers and pastas. 

Hot & sour soup 3.5/5 - Was actually very surprised it was good, thought it was going to be super Americanized but it's not

We got the 3 course meal for $20 where we chose -- 

Caesar salad 4/5 - Can't really go wrong with salad but the Parmesan slices were just a little too big of chunks and their dressing is very subtle but not in a bad way

Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken 2/5 - Pretty bland and oily, I prefer my pasta on the softer side as well. The sides of garlic bread were bomb though crispy on the outside but soft in the middle I could've eaten a whole basket ! 

New York cheesecake 2.5/5 - Your basic cheesecake with strawberry syrup on top with a few fresh strawberries, probably wouldn't order again but it wasn't the worst.",JGZqnZ_WWI5S2vKsRp2ZIw,1,0,3,1lLoO_sr1WT-0Cgf_Jb0iA

As far as food goes...
Had the nachos one night, and they were pretty good, flavorful and the portion size was decent. My server, a hispanic man, acted like he didnt give two sh*ts about me. Ice water they served tasted funny.

Came in for breakfast as well...had the corned beef hash. Big chunks of undercooked potatoes and chunks of corned beef. Had to cut up the potatoes and flavor it all up with salt, pepper and Tapatio. My server James was nice, but I felt rushed with him, too.

Staff: Be sure to constantly check the condiments at the tables. I was missing pepper and Tobasco. Very basic!

Huevos rancheros was fantastic.  I huge red chili on top,  packed with flavor. The churro beans are new to me-- very good-- they're pinto with pork. 

Mimosas are only $7 (good for vegas!) and strong!  Well worth the money. 

The rest of the table ordered french toast,  2 eggs with chicken apple sausage and bacon.  All delicious. 

So, the wait was crazy. Came at 10 am on Saturday and waited about an hour from being seated to eating food.  But the food was so good,  it was almost worth waiting that long. 

Manager Eric was amazing.  We inquired about the wait and he made us feel like we were being taken care of. Our waiter,  Jamie, was great too. Did his job.  Seemed very busy with tons of tables and was responsive when we called for him. AND he went out of his way to go to the change machine for us when we needed small bills.

I dined here twice on my trip in Vegas. 

The first was right around midnight, my BF and I ordered to-go meals to take to the room. The girl was nice and after taking our order, offered for us to sit in a corner booth to wait for our food since it would take 10 minutes or so. We took our seat and waited. and waited. and waited. a good 25-30 minutes later, we realized we hadn't gotten our food, and not one person came up to us to let us know our food was ready or not. So I got up to ask the girl what was going on, she had our food sitting on the back counter. She asked my name and gave me the bag. Once in the room, the food was pretty lukewarm. Not a huge deal, but I just wish she would have kept a better read of the situation. We were maybe 5 steps from where she was, right around the corner. Aw well. Food was fine.

The second time was the morning we were leaving, grabbing breakfast before hitting the road. The server was nice, took our order since we were ready quickly. Food and drinks came out semi quick and were all delivered by different people. When our food was dropped off, I asked for more ketchup since ours was empty. He said, ""okay"" in a somewhat confused voice and never returned. A server never really came back until we flagged someone down that we were ready for the check, after sitting there with empty plates for a few minutes. Now, I have worked as a server in the past, so I get it when you're busy, but there is still a way to keep up with your tables or have someone else do it. The real problem is that the restaurant was not super busy. maybe 3/4 full and I saw at least 10-12 employees buzzing around so didn't seem under staffed. 

Eat here if you don't care about customer service or if you're not in a rush. The food is decent and they have a lot to chose from. At least when you DO get to interact with the employees, most of them are quite nice.",MAl4Fj9gKiSzo4Sec4eQcQ,1,0,3,ib37hsdap9OJk6dfZKOI2g

I'd say the interior is casual and comfy.  So we decided on giving the Chinese dishes a try even though we were skeptical.  Man were we surprised!  The Yang Chow fried rice had chunky fresh ingredients and the flavor was on point.   My husband raved about the salted pork with century egg congee.  The seafood and tofu claypot was so delicious.  And I'm usually not into claypots!  The tofu was lightly fried and when you bite into it, the inside just melts in your mouth.  Every ingredient in the claypot was cooked just right - tender and tasty.

The next morning we decided to give their breakfast a try.  I was so disappointed by the wait time.  We sat there for probably 40min after placing our order.  The manager apologetically explained how the printer wasn't printing our order back in the kitchen.  Honestly, I didn't understand the hold up but I was appeased by his apology and hospitality.  The blueberry pancake, when it finally showed up, tasted heavenly!  They totally made it up to us.  My husband's French toast was done perfectly as well.

Overall, I'd recommend this place to weary travelers!  It can get a little crazy when the place gets crowded but the food is worth everything.",v1um_EicLz4lZIx-HVnpow,2,1,4,n-eLXr0vQPaeI8TuPrSe9g

Came out on a roll which was slightly stale but that was fine because there was plenty of food otherwise. Steak fries were good. Avocado on sandwich was fresh.  Sat at counter and service was attentive.  24 with tax and tip for a diet and a sandwich. Pretty standard I think for Vegas. I did see the fried rice come out. It looked like it was not the best thing on the menu.,8VDO-LwZYuM6-6639Jd4eQ,0,0,4,oVRwuD5RnsA14xOheWsZfA

The hostesses and waiters are polite and very helpful and attentive but the food is eh... Iffy. 
And it also took forever to come out, in a non-crowded place.

I had the popcorn shrimp w/ cocktail sauce and it was okay. It came with pieces of popcorn sprinkled about the plate. Cool theme I suppose. Anyway... It was seasoned well and the sauce was tasty, only came with a few shrimp though. 

The chicken tacos were a big disappointment. Chicken was cooked well but not seasoned at all, bland. Tortillas were dry, pico de gallo was okay but as a whole it wasn't pleasant. 

I think the best bet going here will be to order breakfast food(served all day)...",bgSlBFvw1Ad2TdAT1RfNtQ,1,0,2,aOlv1DYe0Y4gmJrw7hFjLQ
