1600283,2012-02-12,1,Pn8DcG2Uz6Ly8tO_EpI5tw,"This is a nice Subway. It's clean (almost brand new) and isn't as scary as one of the previous reviews makes it seem.

In fact, it's my go-to Subway for lunch. The meat and vegetables are always fresh, and never ""off"". The bread is always fresh, and when they build the sandwich, it's not pathetic and lifeless. I've had some bad Subway experiences in the past at other locations.

Worth a shot if you are hungry and in the area.",Wi0VgIrbb8vqU6weyVw6tg,1,1,4,SztkhT0mhU0AAJQwF4auvQ

When I asked why she's taking call orders in front of everyone, as it was the 6th sandwich made for them as I waited, she rudely replied ""it's a headset, not a phone"".  I then started to ordern, and she told me she was going to upcharge me for bacon...on the ""chicken bacon ranch melt"". Say what?  Is bacon not in the title of the sandwich?  That was my last straw, so I said forget it, and walked out and told her that is never come back. (To which she replied ""NEVER COME BACK"". ) The management must be terrible here to let this thing happen.  She should be fired immediately.  Don't ever go to this subway",FXeEOmXvTyYIkfjB5fi7GA,0,0,1,363-KR6CuP3ZHfQRmt4wEQ

With that being said, this is the short review of my disgusting visit this evening. 

I walked in and there were two people working. Greg was sweeping in the dining area and another employee, without a name tag, was finishing up the order of the one person ahead of me.  No greeting by either when I walked in, rather a huff and eyeroll by Greg that I had inconvenienced his sweeping efforts.

After he washed his hands and donned his food service gloves, I asked if the sandwich I wanted was included in their special. No eye contact, ""uh huh"", is all I got.  He began making my sandwich and asked, with all the personality of a rock, if I wanted it toasted; to which I replied, ""yes please"".  He put my sandwich in the toaster and I moved down so he could help the person behind me.

No name tag finished the sale with the customer ahead of me, my sandwich was still toasting.  He closed the cash register, walked over to put on gloves, and then headed to get my sandwich out of the oven.  Before he could open the oven door I said to him, ""please don't touch my sandwich until you have washed your hands and put on new gloves, you were just handling money and didn't wash your hands"".  This clearly ruffled his feather as he raised his voice and said, ""I didn't touch any money, don't be lying up in here.""  I replied, ""I just watched you finish the transaction of the gentleman in front of me, with dirty hands you picked up gloves and put them on.  Whether you touched money or not for the sale, you didn't wash your hands.""  He continued getting louder and repeated, ""I didn't touch any money you liar"".  At this point Greg told him to stop.

I told no name tag that he could keep my sandwich because his hygiene was disgusting and that I would be reporting the restaurants sanitation practices.  With that, I walked out.

It is appalling in this day and age that basic handwashing before food handling isn't paramount at any establishment serving food.

I will not return to this Subway and as promised, I reported them to the county and state. 

People wonder how foodborne illness spreads so quickly. This was a perfect example.  His filthy hands touching clean gloves and then a patrons food, seems pretty straight foward.

Avoid this Subway location at all cost.",WXuyC8C3szmJ_b8Lvx5S3A,0,0,1,LoJncGTyj5fj1h_s8eDw9A

Second she said to toast the bread and it still came out soggy. Third of all she almost forgot to give me my drinks after i payed for them. And when i asked for light mayo and mustard she put a whole lot. She was also eaves dropping on my conversation with my friend and had to put her two cents in it.

I ordered my sandwiches for myself and my roommate as my sandwich was being toasted I noticed that the chicken in the case looked like it has mold on it , I informed Tatiana the sandwich maker and she did not care ! 
Actual transcript of convo 
Me : "" excuse me miss , just to let you know that the chicken looks like it has mold on it "" 
Tatiana : ""and ..........""
She so did not care , even as I said that , that was unhealthy and she might want to change it out , she then asked what toppings I wanted on my sandwich and ignored my suggestion , WTF? I can see why the other reviewers are talking about the poor customer service and now just a huge disregard for food safety , basically what I'm saying is there are many choices in town for a sandwich , if you want to spend your money here please be advised it won't be appreciated and you are risking your health until this place gets someone who actually cares about their job !",WfbJKGJWj2yQ50XRku-OzQ,0,0,1,C7dbdtqhhz6cw-L3Y9L0OA

He gave me the wrong bread and kept asking me over and over what I wanted on it. The girl working named Bailey was a total bitch to a customer when she tore up his sandwich. Plus they were arguing in front of customers.  Worst subway experience I've ever had.  Update: when we got back, we realized our sandwiches weren't cut in half and they didn't give us any napkins.

They didn't have the bread I wanted.  Then I ordered a meatball for my wife and I'm watching them place the meatballs and I see in a 12"" they only put 4 meatballs. I see him trying to spread them out and I was like um that's not how many should be in there and he was like that's all that's left. They would need to prep more. So we was going to charge me a footlong with only 6"" worth of meatballs?!? They said it would take a while to prep the meatballs so I said I'll wait. Then they said they couldn't prep them cause it was too close to closing. Which was in 5 hrs....so I told them I would just take the 6"". They didn't even discount me or anything. Should have just walked out. Then when my wife ate the meatball sandwich she said it tasted weird and ended up having food poisoning during the night. Worst subway I've ever been to.

I walked in to a line literally out the door. I had to be at a presentation at the resort it was connected to but they decided to make 1 person run the whole fort down. I waited in line for 20 minutes. The other two employees either hid in that back or sat down and looked miserable. The lady in charge and also prepped the sandwiches had a major attitude problem and made me repeat things since her sour face was too over understanding my order. I asked for peppers and she said she didn't have any when clearly was in front of our faces. She also double charged us. Worst establishment ever! Get rid of cranky employees who don't enjoy being at a job. Tip- don't take it out on the customers, we are innocent people!!! Uncalled for.",_eUb7UGsUoSfi9n2ieF5ow,1,0,1,nD05v2uhaUfIGg_8HBxjFw

Asked to speak to the manager who was the ""assistant"".  Said the bread issue is because they aren't a really busy location so don't bake that much.....should have enough bread to get through the lunch hours.  Said the manager is new (only on the job 2 months and still trying to figure things out).  Went to the ""SUBWAY"" website to file a complaint and get to the end and it asks to type the words to verify it's from a real person.....and there are NONE....so you can't even contact the head office to let them know how poorly this location is being run.

5802145,2014-04-30,0,Pn8DcG2Uz6Ly8tO_EpI5tw,"Let me start off by saying if I can get this place -5 star review I would! 

We were at the Bluegreen resort in Las Vegas California. Location is under the hotel room attached to the hotel. The wife and son were hungry so we decided to grab a sandwich. 

Let's start by saying we were not welcomed when we walked in the door. The toppings look old and everything was empty. All I wanted was a soup. The rude customer service representative for subway told me sorry were out of soap. Could have said I need to make more so it will take 15 minutes I would've said okay I'll send my son down in 15 minutes.  No she told me no soup when I ask is there in the back she said yes with an attitude and walked away. I didn't see her again for the entire time we're there. 

The other customer service representative for subway. Was also rude and not look at us smile anything. When my wife asked for mustard the container was empty and instead of going to get a fresh container she continued to squeeze and squeeze to get the last bit out of that container. 

On my sons sandwich he wanted a scoop of tuna. ""The lady said sorry we can't do that"" He then replied my dad will pay extra. ""Lady then said sorry we cannot do that""

This subway will definitely ruin my experiences going to any subway in the future. 

I only leave reviews if I have the best experience or the worst experience because I believe people come to Yelp looking for these type of reviews so that they can make better choices of the restaurants etc. they visit.",J4sLz_6hm5GpbKWreqZXEw,0,0,1,6H9zSD6S58BMCFLXvZpYIA
