Called management and told them what the problem was with my order. Manager that day was not a help at all. Decided to write to Corporate office and hoping they would help me too.

The food is delicious and really reasonably priced! I definitely suggest the Rapid Pick-Up ordering option online for a nearly stress free experience. You can just walk in, grab your food and go (or sit down if you can find a spot). They mark your food order on the receipt in super large letters so there is no confusion, but there's a staff member at the pick-up window to assist with orders. The staff is very friendly! 

Because it's so closely located to a few other newly opened quick-bite options in a very busy executive office location, this place is EXTREMELY busy between 11:45am-1pm during the work week, so go before or after that time frame to get your food in a timely fashion.

The cons are few: Extremely limited parking and the ""flow"" of this Panera location isn't the best. You pick up your order in the back of the restaurant, almost where you'd think bathrooms would be, and then you weave your way back to the front to exit.",3Um13SFZrbYp_JC7LD1tLg,2,2,4,BiKS9sr9qP_Kzd7yLTNVCQ

The soup was just as disappointing as it was a bowl of very good chicken broth and a couple noodles; not a single piece of chicken.

They are more expensive than most other quick service places you go eat at, compare to jersey mikes, or Quiznos, subways, you will have to pay about almost $10 -$12 for an entree and a drink. 

Ever since they changed their to go salad box from a box to a bowl it does seem like the size have gotten much smaller, but their green Cobb salad and the goddess dress is the most amazing thing! Very creamy and it is perfect with that salad, i can almost just drink those dressing if it was a little lighter !  And i also replaced the chicken in the salad for turkey, with little bit extra cost, the roast turkey is absolutely tender! Must try

If you are in a hurry, always do an app order or online order for rapid pick up! They do a great job on having the salad there for whenever you are ready for pick up, and also if you use the app you can also accumulate rewards for a free sweet treat or sometimes even a free salad!

Paradise wins from an ease of ordering standpoint.  Panera has an odd order taking system that prevents salads from being made in real time.

Quality and taste - this is a draw.  Very similar items, quality of ingredients similar.

Overall ease of use - Paradise wins.  Paradise provides a 16 oz (complimentary) cup for water.  Panera provides a dixie sized cup - think mouth wash sized.  Most Paradise have two  beverage dispensing stations.  Panera has one and the lines can move slowly.

The food is great. It's consistent and I cannot complain but the service...man. When our food runner came by with our sandwiches she forgot which one she was holding and got irritated when we told her what it probably was. Then when we noticed that the soup was broccoli cheddar versus the chicken noodle we ordered, she suddenly became very defensive and started blaming the cook for cooking the wrong one when we weren't accusing her in the first place. Especially since we also work in the service industry, we hate it when we encounter rude guests/customers so we make sure that we don't become those rude customers when we go out.

4074331,2016-11-01,5,0FHfkDxKSeDuyAEeaY6X-Q,"I usually don't review chain restaurants but this Hughes Center location of Panera Bread is one of the THE worst managed restaurants I have ever been to. I usually order takeout from this location (I've done so at least a dozen times), and every single time my order is wrong. Every. Single. Time. No, really. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME!!

This location is by my husband's office so sometimes he'll pick up a takeout order that I place through the My Panera app and bring it home (which is a 25 minute drive away). I love Panera, but even I now refuse to order from this disastrous location. I have complained -- repeatedly -- to the manager here (who is obviously incompetent, lazy or both) and corporate and nobody seems to care at all. This has made me have very, VERY negative opinions towards Panera in general. 

I can't even begin to list all of the things that have been wrong with my orders. EACH AND EVERY TIME my salad is missing an ingredient, be it avocado, chicken, bacon, tomatoes or, as was the case with my most recent order, THE WRONG KIND OF LETTUCE. Who makes a mistake like that? I've had the wrong soup put in my bag (since when is broccoli cheddar soup easily mistaken for french onion soup? They don't even LOOK the same)!!! It's the manager's responsibility to double check every order before it goes on the takeout shelf, and he is seriously failing at his job. 

This location is ALWAYS out of something too -- they never have any sides other than potato chips (um, you are called Panera BREAD, that means you should always have bread available as a side). Want one of their delicious sprouted whole grain rolls as a side item? Forget it. They will never be available.

The worst error this place has ever made was when they gave me PEANUT salad dressing instead of the Greek dressing that usually comes on my salad. What if I had a peanut allergy? What if I gave that salad to a child with a peanut allergy? OMG! That could've KILLED somebody!

I called the manager right away to tell him and he was less than concerned. He offered a ""free meal"" but I told him that I live on the other side of town so it's not like I could just hop in the car and come back. Plus, I don't want any free meals from this location.

I like the different choices and different offerings (Pick 2), the bread---I would go there just to buy some bread (the french baguette is yummy!), and the concept is good (responsible ingredients, just below Chipotle in scoring, BTW), the creamy mac & cheese is really good, too. And the kids meals are reasonable. I did notice that the pricing is a bit higher than regular casual restaurants, like neighbor, Chipotle (this is restaurant row, there are a ton of choices). I think I might've been more upset if I had paid regular price for the meal. Just to illustrate how much it was, our dinner was $31.94.

There was an avocado shortage and signs regarding that note was all posted all over. I wanted to try the Cobb salad, but got something instead because, what's the point? 

I opted for the ""Pick 2"": cashew chicken salad and the turkey apple cheddar sandwich on cranberry bread (soft). The salad was good, but I felt it was missing something for more balance on the flavors as it was pretty sweet (I didn't finish it). I liked the sandwich much better though the bread was not toasted. I usually like my bread toasted. That was the only downside. If we were going again, I would order something else. If it were cooler outside, I'd have ordered the soup. 

My husband got the ""Pick 2"": mac & cheese and steak sandwich; the mac & cheese was delicious, and the sandwich sucked---""where 's the meat? it looks nothing like the picture."" (yes, those were his words; I think he would score this one a 3 stars). 

Our son's meal @ $4.99 (was very good, though, the bread, he didn't eat much of it. His latest thing is he wants to take it home, but then he forgets about it. Don't worry, I've been eating it this week.

We got here a little later on a sunday night and there were some other customers (I think this was the tourist crowd), but it wasn't crowded. It was clean.

Facility:  It's seems to be a bit small compared to other Panera's I've been to, but maybe it's the layout. It was very clean as its a brand new location. 

Service:  Well, I ordered my meal and when I tried to pay, it declined my card. I was using my Discover, which I pay off each month. The attendant ran it again, and said it was declined, I told her that it was definitely not the card. Of course now I'm mortified because everyone in ear shot thinks I don't pay my bills now. The attendant didn't know what to do, so she started to go get the manager. I didn't want to hold up anyone behind me, so I ended up paying with Amex and standing off to the side to call my card company to find out why it was declined. Meanwhile the manager stepped up and I told him how embarrassing the situation was that their machine did not take my card. His answer was that they don't judge people. Really???  There's nothing to judge!!!  Eventually the folks from Discover said there weren't any problems with the card, and said they don't even see the ""declined"". They said they should have manually entered the card number, which of course they did not. 
I mentioned this to the manager too, and he just answered they could have done that. I guess it's just new people, new store, but unfortunately at the expense of my embarrassment. :(  He did say he would mention it to their IT too, but I didn't have confidence he really will. 
He did check on my friend's food and brought her a free piece of bread since they didn't have croutons. That was nice. 
Other than that, the attendant that came by, I think her name was Mykayla, she was a sweetie!  She chatted with us and cleared our plates with a super positive disposition. We really liked her. 

Food:  What can I say...it's Panera!  The food is good. This time I got the pick 2 and a drink, and a plain bagel for tomorrow. 
Winter squash soup - 4/5 - thick, creamy and a tad sweet as squash can be. 
Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich - 3.5/5 - a little too runny, but the flavor was very good. I took one bite and juice went all over. My friend laughed and said it was a tad wet for a chicken salad. Maybe it sat too long and the grapes and celery sweat a little too much. It still tasted good. 
Bread - 5/5 - they have the best bread ever!!!  Crispy on the outside, soft and delicious on the inside. LOVE!!!

My name didn't appear, so I went to the pick up area and saw the person who had taken my order chatting with another server. I spied my order (soup) on the counter and tried to retrieve it. She said that she had been waiting to bring my my order because she had forgotten to give my the vibrating pager associated with my order. When I finally sat back down, the soup was almost cold.

1. Greeted and acknowledged upon entry is a must. It's the initial feeling of receiving basic hospitality. It's the first step of good care, welcoming attitude and friendly demeaner.

2. Clean environment screams welcome, gratitude  for patronage and respect. It shows that order and care are placed in the environment that you will be in. It shows that your welfare and health are important.

3. Confidence and value in your product. It means much more than being aware of what you have to offer, but know that what you're offering, selling is worth my time and money. Value your customers enough to not just strive to be better, but being the actual best and giving your customers the desire to return for future visits.

Add it! Does the salad not have feta cheese and you really want feta, add it! You just can't beat that. 

They also have a wide variety of soups & sandwiches. Which goes perfectly with their ""pick 2"" option. Where you can enjoy both a soup & a sandwich for you meal. 

The restaurants are always consistently clean, and they always have fresh breads & pastries - but I am not 100% sure if they bake them all in store.

Hubby's other pick is usually their Turkey Chili which is really thick and tasty! I hate when chili is too watery so this one has the perfect consistency.

Since I'm the more adventurous one, I've had almost every soup they offer. My favorites have been Cream of Chicken & Wild Rice, Cheddar Broccoli and Baked Potato Soup (hold the bacon!).

Please don't leave without getting chocolate chip cookies! They're baked fresh daily so they're soft and yummy. The Passion Papaya Green Tea is good too. I've come to the conclusion that it's probably more water (and sugar) than green tea, but we're not complaining lol.

So yeah, it's pretty much what you've come to love or loathe about any Panera Bread.  Nothing on the menu is particularly ground-breaking, but if you like soups, salads, sandwiches and pastries you'll probably be able to find something to enjoy here.  Lately I've been a big fan of their Soba Noodle Broth Bowl with chicken.  I've always enjoyed the flavor of Panera's ""Organic, Cage Free, Antibiotic Free, 'we swear this chicken lived a long and fruitful life'"" Chicken, and I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the buckwheat soba noodles as well.   On other days where I don't feel so soupy, I'll do a pick two with the greek salad and turkey chili.   I don't even really find either of these to stand out to be honest, but they're relatively ""healthy"", run of the mill versions of these dishes that satisfy my hunger and just get the day going again.  What an endorsement, I know.   But that's sort of what you're expecting when you come to Panera isn't it?  I don't prepare my tastebuds for a shocking flavor explosion when I step through the door, it's just going through the motions of 'Eat, Sleep, Go to work, Repeat', but it works.   Maybe that's just because I skip the bakery section.

For food I was leaning on just giving a 3 star review, but Panera's somewhat recent roll out of their Rapid Pickup option is just so phenomenal that I bumped it up a star.  You can order online (and it's very well designed and intuitive), and drive to your local Panera where you order is just waiting for you on a shelf system.  Now I don't want to think about the implications of my food order sitting on a shelf for minutes before I arrive in this mad, mad world we live in, so I block those out and just grab it and go.   Minus human interaction, plus one star.

In conclusion I'd like to rant a bit about Panera's incessant removal of my favorite items from their menu.   I loved the Spinach Power salad.   Gone.   I loved the entire Power salad ""hidden"" menu.   Gone.   I know the broth bowl is next.   I just know it.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,4,686QBb6dU2BN8uzNl6S8oA

I'll admit, I was very overwhelmed when I first walked into the store. All the different that's on display to choose from as well as the large selection from their actual menu, you could say I literally had no idea what to get

As I looked through the menu, I had a hard time understanding it. I was a little shy to ask the cashier what the ""pick 2"" options meant, because I didn't want to seem like I couldn't read a menu, but when I finally got the courage to ask, he told me that it's actually a very common thing people ask him about. 

I found out that if you pick 2 things from the menu that's labeled with ""pick 2"", then that's the price you will get those items for. Silly me; of course it was something as simple as that. 

I ended up deciding on their most popular items: the chipotle chicken avocado melt and the cheese broccoli soup. When the order came, I was notified that they barely had any cheese broccoli soup left, so they were nice enough to give me whatever was left as well as a full bowl of whatever soup to my choosing. 

The cheese broccoli soup matched my tastes spot on. It was on the cheesier side, so dipping the free bread they give in there for the first time, it packed more of a zing than I thought. There were no huge broccoli chunks which I found nice. 

I also quite liked the melt; however, I'm a tad disappointed that it didn't have that chipotle style heat in the back of your mouth like the name promised. Oh well. Still tasted good.
