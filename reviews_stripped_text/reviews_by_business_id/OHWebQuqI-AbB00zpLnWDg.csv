I found my new southern/soul food spot! I definitely give this five stars plus. You won't be disappointed!",xH9ayUnUDQBjYZxsHSsj1Q,1,0,5,YwEMA7REfKVT2L1SyUgzvg

There was signage and equipment there, but on the counter there was only a big sign that says ""Restaurant Available"".  Oh well.  Another one bites the dust.  This location has been all sorts of things over the years.  It's one of those gas station convenience stores with a couple of take out restaurant counters inside.  They have previously sold pizza, burritos, burgers, and now southern food and even the gas station has changed hands several times in the last decade.  So if something else ends up at this address my advice is to call ahead first.",Gab1_sLsjJLAJojoFd-d-g,1,1,1,P7L_rhDUkkEcXQvgpntTLw

Did I mention the fish was frozen?...yes frozen


Wont be back again.",xr5xLhd68z9vmiAO5SXECw,0,0,1,HEiQ11DVWXmGL9C3Lev82w
4398773,2016-03-10,0,OHWebQuqI-AbB00zpLnWDg,Been to this place 4 times now. Ask the gas clerk if they went out of business she said no someone back there. Yelled back called number still nothing. Guess they don't need business.,EXGMovm5s70B8Oe905M7PA,1,0,1,Ukod67JafDvit8w-Q3QKYw
4546508,2015-11-06,0,OHWebQuqI-AbB00zpLnWDg,First time here and it was a great experience. The guys behind counter where  super nice. The food reminded me of my grandparents. It's truly southern home style food. Can't wait to go back.,-f--l4tZ2F7S0SmoO6wyaA,0,0,5,jIDJ36296WL_871Hn-aGUw
4722645,2015-09-18,0,OHWebQuqI-AbB00zpLnWDg,"The wife and I ordered gumbo, fish, ribs and banana pudding. The food hit the spot. The gumbo was good despite the rice being just a bit gummy but I'd order it again because of the taste. The fried swai w/Mac n' cheese and fries were tasty and delightful. My wife enjoyed her rib dinner and the banana pudding. All-in-all, we'd eat here again.",AVNV2gDRF9b6yMZ5hcij8Q,1,1,4,Xx9XKXILbZnlBtKqc5GU0w
4732326,2015-08-30,3,OHWebQuqI-AbB00zpLnWDg,"I changed out of my comfy Sunday morning pj's to get soul food lunch for the family. I read reviews of poor service and lack of accurate hours being posted.  Well I arrived at 11:15 and despite the sign saying 9-9 it was closed. The AmPm employee stated ""they don't have hours, they open whenever"". Not the way a business should be ran, it screams unprofessional and typical Soul food restaurant stereotypes.",9waLUxm1jkUm8sI3myuBsA,1,1,1,5042J3526opymoHy8IZriQ
4782212,2016-01-29,0,OHWebQuqI-AbB00zpLnWDg,"The food here was freshly made upon my arrival and took maybe 5 or so minutes to cook. The service was extremely friendly. The food was true Louisiana soul food. Chicken and shrimp was so juicy and delicious, flavorful and omg fantastic. Best chicken l have had in sooooo long. Don't be deterred that this place is in a gas station. The food was amazing!",9LGm1tLuUbrEPgE6kw4fAQ,0,0,5,k8oJBClHIk9Tsrz3n_TSUQ
