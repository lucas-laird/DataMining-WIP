Nice open atmosphere. Looks and feels like a chipotle for pizza. 

The pizza wasn't anything spectacular, but if you're looking for something quick to eat, this is the place. They did no do a good job dispersing the toppings. We had one slice that basically had just cheese. 

We asked someone for a towel so we could wipe down the table. He informed us that he would be right back to take care of that. He must have forgotten because when he returned shortly after, he started collecting plates and asking people how everything was going. We had to ask the manager to assist us. Then as we were eating our pizza, we watched the same person that we asked to help us, wipe down a table for two teenage girls.

To start things off, they were obviously under staffed. It took 20 minutes for me to get to order. To top it off, after waiting all this time, I did not receive my discount that I have never had a problem receiving for being an EMT. I have been to many locations of Pieology including the one at the MGM Grand and have never ran into this problem, receiving my discount with no questions asked. Today, the cashier told me he had been working there for a year and had never heard of such a thing, he turned around to a girl loading pizzas in the oven (not a manager or higher level) and she immediately gave him a disgusted look and shook her head no and he came back saying she had been there for longer and hadn't ever used it either. I have returned to Pieology for their appreciation of my underpaid job many times on the job and off the job without question. 
I was very taken aback by the lack of customer service and lack of support I received for public service. My friend and I both were quickly pushed aside and not even offered a beverage or anything for the extra $10 we ended up paying because we were unaware we were not going to receive this discount. If I would have known this was going to happen, I would not have waited in line for 20 minutes to receive rude service, but would have gone elsewhere with my money.",MzdmpxHLdNKrALTu8aSLHw,0,0,1,JhFC6TP_CxyjNK4wDQq6Yg

My husband and I have been here twice and the first time was awesome we thought the concept was great. The only thing we could really say was the menu is so small that the only people that can see it are the ones who are at the very front of the line. Also I customize my pizza, since I don't care for meats on pizza, and got all veggies. It took awhile to get our pies and when we did my veggies where still cold(I had mushrooms and they where still white, cooked mushrooms are brownish and soft), but my crust was golden brown. We asked them to reheat it and they did. Veggies where cooked but the crust was burnt now...

Second visit they where pushing us down the line so fast, while being the only ones in line, we didn't get to say we like extra cheese and when we finally got a chance (we where only the next station over) ,and we where told us no, there's Parmesan over there. No?! We are paying, so yes. The worker said it slows down the line(there was only one couple behind us now at this point, so not like there's a huge rush or anything). Finally the manager said fine but only this time.. This time?? How about don't push us so fast down and we can tell u how we like our pizza.. Finally we see they are done cooking and they drop it on the floor no big deal accidents happen and they made us a new one quickly.

Over all it went from being awesome to just eh. Just our biggest complaint is being told no because that's how the owner wants it. But they have to realize customers forget sometimes and being told no over just wanting some extra cheese is ridiculous, because of a line.. Maybe put a larger menu up and ppl would have their minds made up before they get to the ordering station..",Gj6PNSLU_nk73T-rE7vFdg,2,2,3,o8qbF0t6XaGhRZMyQSn3Mw
159090,2015-04-30,6,F0lI9okn4pzmN_iq5UqF7w,"This UPDATE is an expansion of my original ""note to self"" review. 

Management should pay attention to the negative reviews & act if this place is going to stay open. Not everyone takes to Yelp to leave a review, but they DO walk with their feet & take their $$ elsewhere after a bad experience. 

I drove from Silverado Ranch to meet friends here for dinner on a Saturday night. None of us had heard about this place until that day when someone in the group saw it earlier that morning while passing by. I wasn't keen on driving this far to eat somewhere I'd never heard of so I took to Yelp to see what I could find. At the time, the reviews of this place were poorly. I prayed our experience would be different. 

There were 4 of us. Saturday night. Empty restaurant. The tables were all pushed together forming straight lines the length of the restaurant. The tables clearly, & were in dire need of, a good wipe down with spray cleaner. 

I was the last to order in our group. First, the counter is too high. Being 5'2 I had to stand on my toes to speak to the person on the other side. Rather, shout at. It was too darn loud from the ovens & acoustics. Being deaf in one ear I could barely hear; I can only imagine how someone with full hearing might respond to the noise. 

Having read on Yelp something about olive oil being drizzled on the pizza I asked what came on the pizza.  I was told sauce, cheese, toppings. No mention of olive oil. I ordered a gluten free crust with red sauce (toppings were to be told to the next guy).  This employee proceeds with starting my pizza only to grab a squeeze bottle & drizzle something on the red sauce. I halt him & ask what is he doing. ""HUH?"" he replies, only to tell me its olive oil. I asked him to start over as olive oil wasn't what I wanted nor did he tell me it was when I first asked him what came on the pizza. He asks me whats the difference, olive oil is in the red sauce. My response, again, is he never mentioned it prior AND if its in the red sauce already that's fine but I don't need or want more. After an eye-roll & quick shove-outta-the-way of the first pizza he starts over & tosses my pizza like a frisbee to the next guy.  He doesn't notice that I notice him take the original crust with olive oil & face plant it into the bin while muttering under his breath. (It was too loud for me to hear!)

The next guy, again, very hard to see & hear & I am still standing on my toes. He was a bit friendlier, but not by much, & added my requested toppings & put it in the oven. I move down to the next person on this pizza ordering conveyor belt & hand my card to a snobby girl to pay & obtain a number. 

I make my way to my friends to see the 3 of them, not 5 minutes after I begin my order at the counter, are halfway through their meal. As the table hadn't been wiped down I had to maneuver around the cheese & peppers left behind by someone else to find a clean spot.  A few minutes later my pizza is brought to the table and the 3 are waiting for me to start eating my meal.  We were seated nearest the entrance and it was STILL noisy!!  We were yelling at each other in order to converse. 

My pizza was very pretty: pepperoni, Italian sausage, green peppers. Very thin crust burnt on the edges. (It is hard to cut thru with plastic knife & fork.)Gooey cheese. I declared it GOOD after my first bite but soon after declared it GROSS as by the 3rd slice my pizza is now room temperature.  I was shocked that not only was the crust black, it had cooled quickly & the taste was so different.  WHAT PRIOR YELPERS HAD EXPERIENCED. 

While I was eating, someone decided to come along and not only sweep around our table, they decided to inconvenience me, while eating, to move my legs to sweep under the table & pick up my food to wipe the table down.  UN. REAL. 

Sadly, my experience mimicked that of other Yelpers: loud/hard to hear while ordering; rude employees; burnt pizza; great $7.95+tax pizza while hot, gross at room temp. 

Within days of posting my ""note to self,"" I received a message from JAKE J claiming to be the GM, asking for a 2nd chance (see pic). I ignored the message & here's why:  i drove from Silverado Ranch for a $7.95+tax pizza...ONCE. My first experience was disappointing, why would I drive that distance again?  (It might not seem far to some but for me it is.) If I lived nearby...maybe. I never go to Summerlin, certainly not making a special trip to have another disappointing experience. I can order a pizza for $8.99 elsewhere, pick it up in less than 10 minutes & enjoy it, hot, room temp, or cold...for dinner AND next days lunch/dinner. 

Since I ate there, it appears issues I and those before me remain. It's still too loud. Pizza still comes out burnt. It's still great while hot & blah at room temp.  The employees are still rude. I'm baffled by all the glowing reviews.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,4,2,2,VEYyu8jENELydBhMNX565A

If u want a good pizza, go to any grocery store and buy a frozen pizza. We waited in line for about 15 mins. It was painfully slow.
One guy starts u off w your sauce. So the worker next to him waits, no one helps eachother out. It was the slowest process in the world. 

The kids behind the counter just aren't restaurant workers. They are just painfully slow. The pizza came out pretty quickly. The crust is paper thin. There is an inconvenient positioning of the soda fountain. The give like 3 oz cups for water so all the water drinkers keep returning causing a huge cluster and thats right where u pay so its super congested. 

The restaurant was so dirty. We sat by the window and the window sill was covered in crushed red pepper. My first bite all the toppings fells off. So i grabbed a fork at the beverage bar area. There was one left. I looked inside the container, you can see all the dirt, they must never clean it. 

Luckily it was pretty cheap, but it should be cheap considering the crust is like a tortilla and the toppings are very cheap. I would imagine everything comes in frozen but I honestly dont know. They are definitely canned pineapples. 

Overall, the pizza is just really poor quality. But im going against the grain according to the yelp reviews. If you want good pizza, grimaldis is pretty close, along w any gas station or supermarket would be better.",kO7f_CfDoSDXOFceibXrpQ,1,0,1,PAOlzDOJxNFM-kbYsxfjvg

I love that this place has custom built pizza with unlimited toppings for such a low price. $8 is a great deal in Summerlin. 

With that said, I would still prefer to order a pizza from a chain, and it would be cheaper.

I made the mistake of getting the garlic-butter-olive oil combination as my base (I am not the biggest fan of sauce). The employee basically poured it on. Boy, was it overwhelming. When you got a lot of the roasted garlic in your bite, it was very sweet. Not my favorite. It would be better in a much smaller quantity. 

The pizza was well cooked. I liked the cheeses and pepperoni.

I was that they hand stretched their dough like at Project Pie. The crust here felt very storebought. I like that they have the gluten free option. 

My favorite thing about this pizza was that unlike Settebello and 800 Degrees, everything doesn't slide off when you pick up a slice. That gets very annoying.

Then they will try to do more add-ons at the register, for example, they sometimes automatically add a drink even if you don't order one and suggest that it's 'included' even though it is not. Obviously their goal is to get $2+ more out of you. Customers are aware of these sleazy marketing tactics and hate companies who deceive people.

When we first walked up to the location, a friendly gentleman by the name of Mike greeted us and explained that Pieology was similar to Chipotle but all about Pizza. As soon as he said this I got really excited as I'm a fan of Chipotle and the idea of customizing my own pizza is a lot more awesome than a burrito bowl. Since all custom pizza's no matter how you make it are $7.95, I did a pizza with olive oil, red sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, ham, pineapple, mushrooms and pepperoni. Considering it was their Grand Opening, the service was fast and baking the pizza did not take very long. After paying and grabbing our sodas, we sat down and had our pizza delivered straight to our table like any other pizza joint. 

This was my first time ever trying thin crust pizza as I'm a handmade deep dish pan kind of gal but it was good. The crust was a little burnt for my liking but for thin crust I assume that is normal and the flavors were great. I was even full after 4 slices and able to take the other 4 slices home in a box for later. 

On our way out, Mike stopped us and asked how it was, I explained how I was disappointed that white sauce, my favorite is not offered and he said that it will be coming soon. Now, here is the best part to Pieology. Later the night when I was feeling hungry I decided to give my pizza leftovers a try, heated it up and wow it still tasted great! Usually I hate leftovers because they never have the same taste as when the food is made fresh in a restaurant however pizza, always does and Pieology completing this fact made me happy and feeling satisfied for the price I paid of ""2 meals"" for $7.95 before tax.

Their featured pies list is small, but the emphasis is obviously on designing your own dinner. 

Last time I did this, at another chain, I designed something less than delightful, so I decided to play it safe with the Smokin' Buffalo Chicken. ""Blazin' Buffalo"" has a better ring to it, but I digress.
Pie was topped with olive oil (seemed unnecessary), mozzarella and a scant sprinkle of (flavorless) gorgonzola, plain chicken (spicy was also available but not offered?), a ton of red onion slices (a second glance verifies they aren't in the menu description), sub mushrooms instead of cilantro, and add on a buffalo-sauce drizzle after a trip to the oven. As far as taste: the cheese was sort of flavorless, buffalo sauce flavor was dominant, the crust was almost cracker-like with it's crispness. Kind of ""meh.""

Staff is in need of training. Didn't see a manager around, the assembly-line seemed confused about whether I wanted the buffalo or barbecue pizza (hence the inclusion of the obnoxious amount of red onion), and the guy I interacted with most was extremely soft-spoken: I had to ask him to repeat everything because I couldn't hear him over the music. 
Mildly annoyed that no one offered to remake my pie when they realized they were adding the barbecue ingredients instead of the buffalo ones- the giant slices of red onion were a turn off and not supposed to be on the pie at all, but I pointed this out and it was not corrected.

Much of the issues with this location are related to the clientele, which cannot be controlled. Summerlinians, you get a three for being rude. 

The line is completely outrageous, which is a good and a bad thing. The location by the strip has ridiculous lines, but they move so quickly you don't notice. We waited behind 8 people for over 15 minutes. This is partly due to the staff and partly due to the patrons. The foot traffic is outstanding for this business.

Right now, there are... 15 children under 10 and around 10 teenagers. The noise level is almost unbearable, which may be because of the acoustics in here. That explains why the outdoor seating is all taken. 

Also one mother has taken over the entire community table to have a pizza party for her son, I'm talking birthday cake and goody bags. So for all you families, kids are more than welcome!

The process of building my pizza was a little stressful. The young lady kept pushing my pizza to the next stage, and I realized that my pizza doesn't taste right because I have no sauce. Being rushed to go through this line doesn't help speed up the time if I keep having to tell you to bring the pizza back, add more of this (they skimp on the portions of everything), etc.

I loved how fast my pizza cooked and the unlimited toppings, the people working the line are always friendly and it is super cheap - $7.95 for a larger size personal pizza. 
But honestly I am writing this review because I have experienced bad customer service here. One of the people who I assume to be a manager (I assume they were a manager- they had on a different shirt than the others working) was laughing and gossiping about customers the last time I came in. I normally am not one to point fingers, but I am very sure of what I heard and I am very disappointed in pieology as a company for choosing people who talk anything other than decently about guests -regardless of their actions or demeanors - as their leaders. I joined yelp to write this review because I was so disappointed in what I overheard. I really hope corporate sees this and makes note of it. 

Other than that, the employees making the pizzas are very attentive and cheerful and are always cleaning tables and interacting positively with those enjoying their pizzas. I felt welcomed by everyone while I was moving though the toppings and even the person at the register was nice and full of smiles, and that feeling continued on while I was eating, as I was asked if I needed anything else and if the pizza was good, which it was. Overall: good pizza, questionable management",-yQ09E9_EV4Z0Rq2em7VWA,1,1,2,W6gDQ1eo9rrna3Xt-bNtWQ

Very skimpy when asking for ricotta, even with it being the only cheese requested. I asked for more and got no response, just a pile of ricotta smacked onto the pizza and it was then passed down the line. Well, thank you, sir. The next girl asked what I wanted. I said basil. She then asked if that was all before I even had a chance to ask for anything else. I said no and asked for garlic. She grabbed a handful and it ended up in three piles (big piles) on the pizza. I kind of chuckled and asked if she could spread it out a bit. Again, no response, she didn't want to spread it out so I got just another pile of garlic and an evil look. Two incredibly rude employees and a crappy looking pizza. I should've taken a picture, but instead I stood there for at least 2 minutes before another guy asked me if I would like anything else. I politely explained that it was a disaster and when I asked the girl to change the garlic it did not work out for me, among other things. At this point I didn't even know what to do, this was a first for me. Obviously these ppl could not have cared less. I told the man that I did not want it and was going to leave. He asked to remake it and the girl that messed part of it up gave me a very evil look and made some comment as well. This place is similar to Blaze Pizza. The idea is the only thing similar though!

The alfredo had a little too much garlic and wasn't really evenly spread out but was still good, and the roasted veggie was nice and had a little sweetness thanks to the corn on top but I didn't really like how it was a little soggy and watery.. But then again you can't always have perfection. I could tell the worker also was inexperienced as well since she kept looking back and forth at the recipe instructions to see what goes on the pizza we were ordering so that might of also contributed to the unevenly spread of toppings.

This place has really, really ridiculously good pizza that you can custom make however you like.  Add as much of whatever toppings, cheese, veggies, etc.   The crust is thin and crispy and they are ready to eat in about 5 minutes.   

I love the food - no issues whatsoever with the grub. It's good, darn good.  I have two very minor complaints.  The first complaint is outside of their control.  The parking sucks.  The lot directly north of the restaurant is always full at lunch and dinner time.  The next closest lot requires walking across the busy road that leads into Downtown Summerlin.  It's not a deal breaker but you will have to dodge a few cars.   Second, the restaurant is noisy and I don't mean just a little bit.  Every surface in the place is hard and industrial and sounds just bounces around.  Being there for lunch can induce a migraine.  They need to install some sound absorbing panels to quiet the place down.

2595391,2015-03-18,9,F0lI9okn4pzmN_iq5UqF7w,"When we moved away from Irvine, CA. I knew that Pieology was going to be one those restaurants that would be hardest to let go. Come to think about it, on my last trip back to CA, we made a special trip to Pieology (Irvine Spectrum location) just so that we can ""kustom""-ise our own personal, magical, thin crust pizza.

When I found out that they were planning on opening a location that is literally less than 10 minutes from where I currently live, I was ecstatic! Now, mind you, they are a franchise and the consistency at this Vegas location is definitely lacking. First impressions: the space is a little larger than the Irvine, CA location, but the line moves at a snails pace! I was wondering what the hold-up is; I supposed the winning, efficient staff from CA weren't transferred over as well.

$7.95 for  a nicely sized thin-crust pizza with ""unlimited"" toppings is ideal. However, I was totally turned off when we got to the front of the line, the staff was meek, bored, scared and awfully stingy with the toppings - it was nearly a joke how much they actually coughed onto our pizza; a dot here and there of basil, a dot of ricotta, tiny teaspoon of garlic, 4 pepperonis... What in the world?! They absolutely skimp at this location. On the other hand, the Pieology in CA (the one that stole my heart) really, really hooked it up - they had no shame in their sexy topping game.

Here's the trick - in order to actually enjoy the wonderful thin crust pizzas here, I would recommend that you be firm and speak up if you want extra topping, they will look hesitant, but the amount they initially put on is such comedy. I will admit, the thin crust freshly prepared and baked crust is super legit. You really have to love thin crust in order to love this place. Also the subway style ordering is a nice touch, only when they aren't trying to be cheap with the toppings.  

On a scale of 1-10, ehhh, that's a tough call. It's different. Some people don't even call this pizza; they are offended by the idea. But we like it! It doesn't make us feel super food-coma'd afterwards and we always pressure them to give us more topping when they skimp. So that helps.

For $7.95 you can have as much or as little as you like.

BYO is simple or course.  Start with crust, then pick your sauces, cheeses, veggies and meats. They offer gluten free for an extra $2.  I liked the crust here it was not quite a circular shape giving it a rustic appeal and it was also thin and crispy.

This place in Downtown Summerlin offers an UNLIMITED amount of toppings in a create-your-own style thin-crust pizza.   For $8 this is a steal.  The pizza is a nice size and you will most likely have left-overs to bring home.

First, pick your sauce:  Options included the typical red sauce, 3-cheese alfredo, herb butter, olive oil, buffalo, pesto, and bbq.    I mixed some herb butter w/ the red sauce and it was delicious.

Next, it's time to pick your cheeses!  I added Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, and Ricotta.  Other choices include feta and parmesan.   The employees did not skimp on the cheeses and each bite of my pizza had unique flavors due to the cheese.  The Gorgonzola cheese may be strong for some (Think bleu cheese).   The ricotta has a light and fluffy texture, mildly sweet, highly delicious.

Finally, the toppings!  There are a plethora of toppings to choose from.  Meats I saw included pepperoni, meatball, italian sausage, bacon, chicken, spicy chicken, and ham.  There were a ton of vegetable options that you normally would add to a pizza but also included options such as corn, minced garlic, artichoke, basil, roasted red peppers, banana peppers, cilantro, mushrooms, etc.

My colorful creation had italian sausage, pepperoni, and meatball (which were more like crumbled meat) along w/ minced garlic, fresh cilantro, roasted red pepper and red onions.   Unlike other Yelpers' experience here, you could see from my photos that the staff did not get stingy on the toppings.  Woohoo.   The pizza is stuck in an oven and about a minute later you're enjoying some very delicious pizza. 

My 1 star deduction is for not being able to immediately find a clean table to sit at after ordering.  Every table as we walked around the generous sized location had crumbs, or empty red pepper packets on the table, or napkins/empty straw wrappers on the ground.  The other thing the restaurant could use is a larger sized menu.  They only have one posted menu the size of a travel brochure posted near the front and another one right when you order.  I could only imagine how much faster the whole process would be on busy nights if people in line could read from an oversized menu hanging above (think Chipotle) while they are waiting in line instead of having to decide once they get to the front of the line.  

All-in-all, a good place to stop by when in the Summerlin area.  Definitely, a pizza joint I'll return to if I'm in the area.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,2,2,4,xMJGosEOjfRa9U794jhzeQ

About 5 minutes later, your pizza is sitting in front of you.  All the pies are 12 inches (Pieology says 11.5 inches) and no matter how many toppings you want, it's a very affordable $7.95.  A plain cheese pizza is $6.95.  You get to build upon your choice of three crusts (""house made"", whole wheat or gluten free).  Then pick your sauce:  red, herb butter, pesto, BBQ, spicy buffalo, and  a few others.  Or skip the sauce entirely and just paint your crust with olive oil!  Then you add your choice of about two dozen toppings and enjoy get ready for a treat.  If you're not in a creative mood, they have several recommendations you can pick from as well.

I like the whole idea of building your own pizza Subway-style, except the difference is that it tastes 100x better than Subway. The ingredients they use are fresh and unlike Subway they aren't stingy with the cheese or meats ;) The pizzas themselves are pretty small at around 11-12in I want to say. It's probably not enough to share with 2 people but it's definitely good enough for one adult.

They have a number of different toppings for both meats and veggies. Once you pick your toppings they throw it in the oven which usually cooks the pizza in less than 10 minutes. I love how FRESH and thin crust the pizzas come out and being a pizza snob myself I'd say the quality of pizza here is pretty good.

The only knock I give this place is that because they create your pizza on the spot, the lines can get pretty long and move slow. I see a lot of complaints about the slow service but every time I've gone, there has been barely any line.

As a former MGM Grand employee, my experience with made to order pizza places was Project Pie. That place set the bar for personal pizzas for me. 

Anyways...I went for a pizza that I thought I'd be familiar with--Smokin Buffalo Chicken and I added mushrooms, tomatoes, and basil to it. I was given a number and told that they would bring the pizza to me when done. So I find a seat after getting my cup of water and wait for my food to come. In a bout 15 minutes, my pizza came and I was a little excited for it. (I had heard all the craze about the chain and related it to my experience at Project Pie). 

First disappointment: my pizza wasn't sliced! Do they not slice your pizza and just expect you to pick it up and eat it like a cookie?? I looked around at others dining in, and noticed they were eating with a knife and fork! I immediately thought, ""Seriously?!"" So I get my fork and knife and try to cut my pizza into edible pieces....

Second disappointment: the crust was so tough to cut through and the bottom was at a burnt crisp. I had to practically saw my way through the pizza to eat it! If I wasn't as hungry as I was and I could waste food, I would have upped and left!

I guess I'm spoiled by great service and food. The Chipotles and Project Pies have set the standard for quality food and customer service. I would never have gotten a burnt pizza nor would I have been expected to slice my own pizza with a plastic fork and knife at Project Pie.

Choices are marinara, olive oil, garlic pesto and I might have forgotten one.  Next is your choices of cheese.

Last but not least is the abundance of meat toppings.  Did I say unlimited yet!!!

I came for dinner and walking inside I noticed they have a spacious dining area with many tables and chairs. I'd say over half of the tables were filled, so the place was busy. I was surprised that because of how busy it was that there was no line where you order your pizza, but there wasn't. Nice! The guy who took my order was very friendly and I explained it was my first time, so he let me take my time looking over the choices. The pizzas are $7.95 each and are 11.5"" in size. You also can choose unlimited toppings. 

Choose your crust: Fresh in store made crust or for an additional $2, gluten free crust.

Choose your sauce: Red sauce, herb butter or olive oil.

Choose your toppings: For cheese they have mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan and ricotta as options. They have a variety of meats and veggies for toppings ranging from the usual suspects pepperoni, sausage, black olives, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers and much more. 

Add a flavor blast: Roasted red peppers, fiery buffalo sauce, pesto, bbq sauce, EVOO, black pepper, dollops of red sauce and ranch dressing can be added to any pizza. 

I ended up choosing a pizza with red sauce, mozzarella and ricotta on the whole pizza and then 1/2 pepperoni and mushroom and 1/2 tomato and pineapple. They said the pizza would be ready in about 4 and a half minutes. I walked to the register and paid. Our order was to-go, so we waited at the counter for the pizzas. My pizza came out before my husbands and it was just left in a open box until his came out. Our pizzas were ordered at the same time, so I can't figure out why mine would have been ready and his not. We started to notice the staff talking about the pizzas coming out burnt and they even made some of them over again. I noticed one of the employees using the pizza cutter to cut the burnt edges off making the pizza smaller than it should have been for that customer. When our order was finally ready, far past the 4 and a half minute wait time I was originally given, I was off to try out this much raved about pizza. 

My pizza was burnt! I was so frustrated at this. The edges were so badly burnt and it tasted terrible. The crust was burnt so badly on one half all under it. Mozzarella cheese was missing on certain parts of my pizza. There could have been more mushrooms and tomatoes on the pizza as well. I'm not sure if a lot of the toppings slid to another part of the pizza while it was baking or what, but I would have hoped when they saw my pizza that they would have made another one since it clearly looked burnt and like the toppings were oddly scattered. My pizza was also not very hot or even warm from being left out in the box for so long before giving it to me. The part of the pizza I was able to eat tasted OK, but definitely below average and nothing spectacular.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,49,38,1,OYf6dqBlvWfK6unyArnn3A

I asked for a drizzle of BBQ on top of my chicken pizza and it was smothered in it. It tastes terrible. 
The people sitting next to us ordered a dessert pizza (brown sugar cinnamon butter on dough, drizzled with icing) and it looked like someone smeared crap on pizza dough and then came on it. Even the lady didn't think she should be eating it.

i went to pay for my pizza and it was the same deal with the dude at the register he just stared at you until you say something super weird lookin dude with bleach stains in his shirt 

 so my pizza took a super long time to come out and when i finally got it it came all weird and not full, you would think with that big metal thing they use to smash down the dough it would come out to be a perfect circle but nope they just don't care enough i guess also when i asked for ranch the dude came over with it and it had no lid and he had bare hand with ranch on them soooooo nasty",Uusu4NgV5rM6i72M1K5VVw,0,0,1,irwlFUhQ5DhWhDdzoH3_ag

After the closing of Custom Built, my SO and I heard that Pieology was similar in concept-- a build your own pizza type of establishment, and we were excited to check it out. 

The restaurant is bright with plenty of natural light. This is something I take note of in any restaurant. The decor was industrial and comparable to Chipotle's. It was before noon on a weekday, and, luckily, we had gotten there at a decent time; there was plenty of open seating.

Although we understood the concept of the establishment and it's customizable pizzas, I was disappointed to find that the young lady behind the counter who walked over to us gave little to no greeting. In her hands, she held their regular dough and simply asked us what we wanted. We had never been there before and so we asked a few questions about the dough options. They were answered straightforwardly, and no other information was exchanged. Our pizza was topped and slid into the oven. A different employee came over to the register and charged us accordingly. He then  mentioned that our pizza would be brought over to us shortly.

When it arrived, I was happy to find that it was good pizza, and that the person who brought it over was nice and wiped all the surrounding tables. Clean. I'd also like to note that our pizza was not burnt like it had been described in other reviews--it was crisp, light and my SO liked the pizza's sauce. For the price, around $7-$8, I'd eat it again.

My only gripe with this place was the lack of good customer service. It wasn't unpleasant per sè, but it certainly didn't make for an ideal lunch out. A smile, a ""have a great day"" or an ""enjoy your meal"" would have been nice.

I'd say that the best phrase for me to describe Pieology would be ""not bad"". Stop by for a quick lunch or afternoon bite! It's inexpensive and has something for everyone.

You can have any topping you want for the same price. I think it was ~$8 for 12 inch pizza. I top mine with sun dried tomatoes, double artichokes, spinach, sausage, mozzarella, bell pepper, and ham. They have other toppings like pineapple, mushroom, chicken, etc. Believe me, there are just too many toppings to list. It will be more than enough. Too much and it gets soggy. As a result, my girl likes to get her own simpler pie and I get mine drenched. I can't help it. If you can't tell, I love the Costco pizza too. Since I live near both, I can have either one. But this one is way more gourmet.

The menus are nice and big behind the cashier's like In n Out. You can see them making it in front of you. All the toppings are freshly laid out. I am terrible at choosing between options so I try to just think of toppings together and throw it in. As opposed to the girl in front of me who was deciding on toppings with her friend next to her and her bf on the phone while wearing flip-flops, pajama pants, and a jacket, because it's cold outside. So between me looking at the poor employee frowning and waiting for her to finish so she can help me and the small line behind me, I look at the ceiling with exaggerated interest, as this dotard ruminates between each topping. I imagined what Curly would do with a lemon meringue pie instead of pizza. Some people are so inconsiderate. So please, just because you can hold up the line, you don't have to exercise that option and have a phone conversation while ordering. Don't people like that just annoy you?

There is a take out menu too so you can order and pick up. You know, for those times when there's a slipper wearing Korean girl (I'm Asian so I can cry foul with impunity, and if not, well in my defense, at least I didn't go in winter wearing pajama pants and my house slippers. Now I will have to apologize to my Korean friends for bashing a fellow K girl, bah. Babo.) in front ordering on the phone with her bf and you just want your pizza pie and go. Which is exactly what I did 2 weeks later. I didn't want to oogle their ceiling again, just in case slipper girl was there again! They were even nice enough to ask how far away we lived so that they knew when to make the  pizza. Whoa, say what? We were pleasantly surprised to say the least. Now that's good service!

To satisfy a pizza craving and a quick bite to eat, I highly recommend this place. I'd give it 5 stars but I am afraid there might be something out there who deserves 5 stars and I nonchalantly have been giving everyone five stars.",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,1,0,4,vHVxIGcKlcFKVVjQi9hcmg

Just remember toppings are unlimited so don't be afraid to ask for more. They can be kind of skimpy with certain ingredients like our version of a white pizza we made ourselves. Well they made it but you get what I'm saying. I had to ask several times for more ricotta as she out barely a few teaspoons on our pizza. I've learned also that the crust is super thin so it's best to pile on the ingredients. All in all this is a cheap option for pizza but it's been the least favorite of the places I've tried.

The place offers a fast, fun, creative dining experience. Pick you crust (gluten free is an extra charge), pick your sauce, pick your cheese, pick your toppings, and then your meat! We usually go for the custom pizza versus the Pieology creations. The few times we had the Pieology creations, they were just OK. Pieology has nothing on CPK's version of a BBQ chicken pizza.  

You have to like thin crust pizzas to eat here. Fortunately, our crust has never been burnt! Kudos to the staff for doing their job. Staff could use a little bit more training in the customer service department. They seriously never smile or seem very welcoming. 

Honestly, this is not the best pizza out there. We are big fans of Grimaldi's. Usually, 1 pizza is good for me and my husband, but we always order 2 so we don't get bored of one. They have half sized pizza boxes, which is the perfect size for the portion we bring home. For a group of 3, two pizzas is sufficient with no leftovers. 

You can add sauce after your pizza is cooked. The drizzle of pesto is pretty tasty! We've had the cinnamon bread once and it was okay for me. Skip! Go walk off the carbs and get yourself some delicious gelato or a cookie ice cream sandwich.",OPJ0TW8tt5UanY2_YpCgIQ,1,1,4,BtlMt_yajmEztNFUd6Eqog

RUSTIC VEGGIE ($7.99): Minus the mozzarella and ricotta cheese in favor of daiya cheese. This pizza is loaded with tons of veggies, to include corn, red and green bell peppers, and basil. I added mushrooms for good measure (at not additional cost I might add). This pizza was packed with flavor, although the crust is on the thinner side and the pizza itself was pretty floppy.

The layout is identical, the business model is identical, even the logo looks the same. And it is not owned by the Chipotle people so that makes it even weirder. Have you ever gone into a windows store and been annoyed at how it was literally an apple store? Me too and this is the same.

Im going to go out and say it. Chipotle is terrible and I think we all know that. It will always be C level fast mexican food and that has a function I understand that. Yes it also has Vegan options so some love that but no one is going to say that Chipotle is mind blowingly good. 

Pieology is pretty much exactly the same. Custom pizzas made in an assembly line and baked while you sit and wait. The pizzas are simply okay. It would be hard to say they are particularly good or bad pizzas because they are just average thin crust pizzas. You can get better pizzas at regular pizza chains I think that is pretty obvious. This place tries to give you innovative pizza options but ultimately thats more of a pathway to disaster than it is success. Some strange combinations can and will get created here.

I dont have any specific items to review because basically you just construct whatever pizza you want. The premise is a good one, but it's also one with limitations. The food can never be amazing if you get to construct it because you just have no idea what makes a good pizza a great pizza.

Perhaps I am too hard on this place because it's not trying to make amazing pizza just quick fun pizza. And I get that and to that end it is a success I guess. Is it better than Chipotle? Obviously. Do not tell me how can you compare mexican and pizza because thats not my point. 

But the ultimate question concerning a pizza place is this: is the pizza restaurant good enough to justify getting in your car, driving to the restaurant, constructing your pizza in line, waiting for it, eating it at a table, and then driving home? You have a plethora of pizza delivery options at your disposal so the above question needs to be answered a yes to justify a visit. The answer is obviously no. The pizza has to be incredible to justify that amount of time and effort. It is not incredible by any means.

Since this place is pretty self explanatory, I'll just tell you how I made my special pizza.

SAUCE: red sauce. And extra red sauce.
VEGETABLES: basil, red onions, green peppers, mushrooms, grape tomatoes, roasted tomatoes, garlic (the server probably thought I was a vegetarian)
MEATS: meatball, ham, pepperoni
Result: fantastic.

The Hubby's pizza:

SAUCE: herb butter and 3 cheese alfredo
VEGETABLES: red onions, garlic, cilantro
MEATS: spicy chicken, sausage, bacon

Result: i thought it was salty but the hubby thought it was great!

We both loved the super crispy thin crust. So yummy. We were going to take the pizza to go, but we were too tempted to try at least one slice. Well, one slice became half a pizza. It is best to eat the pizza hot!!

You are offered normal thin crust or gluten free,  several types of sauce from red,  pesto, etc.  I went for the olive oil base then on to the veggies.   I remember basil,  green peppers,  red onions,  artichoke,  two types of olives (?), mushrooms and more.   I like to pile it on when it comes to the green.   Next is the meats which is surprisingly the least exciting in the crescendo.  I opted for pepperoni, sausage and...bacon?!?  I didn't know, I panicked and didn't  want to hold the line up.  All together, the pie totals a little over 8 bones.  

Not a bad deal and better than a premium sub sandwich or glutton burger that would equal that price.  Personally,  I think the quick fresh pizza phenomenon is the hook.   Why hit up Sbarro's for pizza way past the danger zone, wilting under a heat lamp, when you can have a decent sized instant pizza minus the nuke process!

My daughter and I went through the process of picking the toppings and paying for the pizza which went fine. We sat and a little while later we could smell our pizzas burning which caused me to look up to see what was happening. 

One young man was spending time changing the change in the tip jar into dollars and apparently forgot them. I observed this, but no one came and talked to me, they just hastily put together another pizza for me, which was a mess, then cooked it in a rush (as in, it wasn't cooked enough, dough was still underdone) and handed it over. Not once did they mention what happened, and didn't seem to notice that I was watching the process.

We got them to go, and after waiting 20 minutes through this process, I just wanted to leave so I took what they gave me even with noticing my daughters pizza was definitely overcooked and mine was a mess. Once I got home, I also noticed it was underdone.

Given this experience, why 2 stars? Well the taste was actually good, even with one being overdone and one underdone. I would assume this would be great pizza if it was cooked properly, but I'm not sure whether I would return if these are the normal employees.

So, if you've never been to Pieology, it's a build-your-own pizza place. I'd compare it to chipotle, except I hate chipotle and this place is amazing. But anyways, it's $7.95 per pizza. You can add as many toppings as you want. The price doesn't change. And the flavor of the pizza is fantastic. 

GO TRY IT ! :)",ZApCAOHduXde1ZFiY1QT3g,6,2,5,8M3uqevZKk0eFzisdE9imA
