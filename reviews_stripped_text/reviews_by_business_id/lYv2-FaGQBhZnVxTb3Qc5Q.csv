353828,2015-08-19,0,lYv2-FaGQBhZnVxTb3Qc5Q,"Let me start by saying that I HATE complaining.  I definitely don't like writing a bad review.  I Think that Yelp should be for people wanting to find GOOD places to go, and to praise locations and employees.  But it is also for seeing which locations should be avoided if possible.  This is one of those reviews.

I usually like to make my own food at home, but occasionally I like to have my husband just grab us take out once in a while.  I love Wendy's chili, chicken sandwich, and baked potato for a quick, easy, late-night bite.  The one star is not for Wendy's.  It is for this location.  Specifically later at night.  

We have given this location several chances, and each time we are disappointed.  The take-out line takes forever.  The people are hard to deal with and rude sometimes.  The food has come out cold, even when they claim it will take an extra five minutes to make that item.  They run out of potatoes quite often.  Twice, when I got my chili, it was a cup of watery beans with (large) chunks of hamburger patty!!!!  I couldn't eat it.  (The dog was quite pleased.)  I used to ask for cheese in my chili (which they charge for, which I understand), but they only put in a small pinch.  Not really worth it.

Maybe it is the wine talking, but I really think that people should know that this take out line should be avoided late at night.  Even though Wendy's sounds delicious sometimes, it might be worth it to travel a little further to the next location.  That is what we will be doing from now on.

Wendy's, I do enjoy your food in a pinch, but this location needs some attention.  Not just for me (I know I am just an old fogie, and should be asleep late at night, so this shouldn't affect me) but for everyone who needs Wendy's late at night.",EEmAV0vYZLtY0ae6xuVujw,0,0,1,qEjmzXqUxDRY-8W_fyjHYA

The employee said she would only fix this one time and called them ""Ughhhh these F*#%kin Beaners"" I was so outraged because this is the type of people Wendy's hire and the employee is clearly racists. I'm not Mexican but my boyfriend is and I did not want anything from this establishment. I'm not sure why the employee left her mic on but the language no matter how the situation was, was definitely inappropriate.

1909785,2012-10-13,1,lYv2-FaGQBhZnVxTb3Qc5Q,"I usually don't like reviewing fast-food joints; unfortunately, I have to on this one, due to the fact I constantly visit this Wendy's more than any of the others, especially in the last 3 months. 

I eat here on occasion for a quick bite, which it has been either around lunch time or late at night. Now, the food will remain the same since it is a corporate-owned fast-food restaurant; therefore, I have no problem with the food, especially the Baja Salad (with no dressing) - superb! Service, on the other hand, can  vary depending on the time you visit this particular location. 

When I get off the ""normal"" Vegas shift, roughly 11/1130 pm, and in the mood for Wendy's, the service is standard - no waiting time, no rude service, etc. The late/graveyard shift-workers are exceptional at their job. Around midnight, my friend and I ordered one medium lemonade drink and a small soda drink. Instead, the guy who took our order ended up accommodating us to two medium-sized drinks and charged us for one medium and one small. (I think he was hitting on my friend, but who knows?) 

Now, there were days after my morning exercise (near brunch hour), I have gone to Wendy's (this particular location) and have gotten the opposite service! The staff during this shift tend to talk more and gossip among themselves in front of the customers, which I have witnessed seeing orders mistaken due to miscommunication on their end, which included mine. I don't know how many times I hear disgruntled employee murmur under their breath as their walking by. I understand it's a minimum wage job, but in front of the customers? Really? I don't know how many times I hear the same employees gossip about one another in front of me as I'm ordering and confuse my order!

Over all this Wendy's location was quiet for a Saturday lunch afternoon.  Went here with a couple friends while taking our CCW class & service was fairly quick, being we were like 3 groups of customers. Inside was nicely up kept and clean. Outside was clean as well and parking was a plenty. The area can get a little sketchy especially at night due to it's location of Tropicana & Dean Martin.  Fairly close to the Las Vegas strip, but just far enough for the crazies to roam around the streets. Yet it's fairly safe especially if you are with other people & mosey on to your own business.  I assume this place gets packed more on weekdays during lunch time with all the business and industrial buildings around the area.  Even for its location, it is fairly accessible and close to the I-15 freeway too.

Well, no one except another Wendy's employee that was in full uniform and ordering a combination that the cashier had no idea how to ring up. Meanwhile my wife and I stood in line as the two Wendy's employees stood there bantering, oblivious to paying customers waiting to order.

Let me take a step back and say that my expectations of Wendy's are not high. Just that someone will be there to take the order and we will get the food. That's the whole expectation.

Anyways, the nonsense continued at the register without any acknowledgement that we were in line waiting for two Wendy's employees to conduct a transaction that happens thousands of times a day throughout America.

Yada yada yada. We left after waiting a little longer. Never got an acknowledgement even as we walked out of the ""line"" and toward the door. Anyways, Wendy's is fine. This one is not.",3mxBNCABjE-PdKpPszwO8g,0,0,1,3GfComXHhxspkadllgUySA

Otherwise, for those coming here, beware of the homeless and sketchy characters that hang out. Thats normal for this side of town. Its behind the strip to its notorious for loiters. I would suggest ordering via drive thru and taking your food back to your home or hotel.

I turned around went back into the restaurant again and specifically asked for a manager and only wanted the manager.  The manager sent a kid up named Sean.  He was very nice and just stuck in the middle.  I explained to him what I wanted.  They supposedly remade the order for the baconator.
