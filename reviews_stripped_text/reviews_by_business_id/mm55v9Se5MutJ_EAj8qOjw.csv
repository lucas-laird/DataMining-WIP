After that manager came in and said that he had a complain and I hadn't even spend 5 minutes there.

Las Vegas (see my review on that one), this one was heaven!  Restaurant was not crowded, and we were seated and served promptly.  Jorge was an attentive waiter, food came out on time and tasted great.  He did mess up on my drink (gave me a real coke instead of diet), but no real worries other than that.  The place gets knocked a star because of its placement next to the smoky casino, and does look a little ""dive-y"", but food and service were good so can't complain too much (especially since we hadn't eaten in over 12 hours).",zKJgCtWuXf67Eiygodx_eg,0,0,3,9IsLYAdsCtMirnWqqV6XNQ

Is it the best food in the world? No, but it's pretty much what you can expect for the price in an establishment like this. Only slight complaint is the one server seemed very overworked but he managed to get the job done.

After you leave you can walk into the casino and inhale about a thousand cigarettes. It's a win win to be honest, Strip restaurants eat your heart out.",zPs6FQ9zYqYwZM4j-nyUNw,0,0,5,mRZF7_XyUFPaJds2_Kl59w

I have to give credit to CC.  She was sweet & can probably teach Memei what customer service really is.  Memei should really stop yelling back at customers and her manager.

Our party of six was seated immediately after being greeted by a grizzled hostess, who has probably seen it all.  However, our waitress was ""Asia"", who provided top shelf service including oh so many coffee refills for everybody.

I happened to notice that from the last order given to the food brought tableside, only 12 minutes elapsed.  Yes, one order was wrong, bacon instead of sausages, but that was quickly remedied.  The delighted diner got a side of sausage.  The rest of the food was fine, hot and typical of Denny's, large portions of decent breakfast food, resulting in six happy, caffeinated people.

I'm not a fan of sausage so I asked for it to be replaced with grilled ham. When my order came out, it was ridiculous. 2 eggs and ham with my french toast that hardly had any powdered sugar and butter. The amount of topping on my french toast was like small as a dime.

Nonetheless, it took a very long time for them to serve a bowl of oatmeal and some fruit. I also had to remind the waitress to bring the fruit. 

My sister ordered juice, but it took an additional ten minutes to tell us that it wasn't available because they ran out. She ordered a different type of juice. Another ten minute delay ensued. Apparently they were out of two types of juices at 9am on a Monday? Try again. Seriously. At that point, we just wanted to get out of the smelly dinning room from the smoke-filled casino nearby. 

When we went to settle our tab, but the girl still charged my sister for the drinks she never consumed. After speaking to the manager, they fixed the error. Meh, seriously, don't ever pay to eat here. Even for free, think twice and think hard. There are so many better choices in Vegas. If I wasn't such a thrifty person, I wouldn't have given this place a second thought.",lRHUkES8HnFAqdoi4hwNkg,2,1,1,xkd69ZJzz3aJM113OpjEEg

The employees were all at the corner hanging out by the kitchens door. Our waiter couldn't even do a head count. Basically she suck. Worst waitress ever. She had no clue of what she's doing. She doesn't even know anything about the menu. My friend wanted a chicken wrap, she told him they don't have that. I was ordering and I wanted the build your own short stack with the eggs and stuff. She didn't even let me finish what I wanted to order. My food came I wondered where was my eggs bacon and hash brown. Her ass didn't even write it down or whatever. She then gave my friends each others plates. My friend was like this is a burrito. The waitress responded well that's what they gave me. Freaking idiot gave my friend who ordered the burrito my other friends chicken wrap. The waitress upset me. Erghhh. She then gave my friend a diet coke which he ordered a regular coke. Oh yeah. She didnt gave us any fork knives and napkins. How am I suppose to eat my damn pancakes. This isn't a pancake eating contest. We were all done she put the receipt on the table and told us the check is on the table. Every time time she came to our table she kept telling us the check is on the table. I find that rude. I swear she was on drugs. The manager lady was cool but she didn't help us. If you do decide to eat here try to get the Hispanic lady. She's really helpful and has been there a long time from what she told us. PEOPLE PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS DENNY'S. If you want to go to Denny's drive a couple blocks to the one on Dectaur and Tropicana. They give better service. I wanted to add you can smell cigarettes from the casino. Not a good place to bring your children.",7Mji_mr3_YTe15v1QGT60g,4,2,1,MjxEGPmkBdL2DuXDJ4FayQ

Nothing else really different, other than the fact that you're in Las Vegas and probably need to sober up before your long drive home. It gets the job done as you would expect.",7fZu8ud7JXFthU0jPxVf4g,3,0,2,NIA1TCF0kwifBqnak1ddJg
5848853,2014-01-06,10,mm55v9Se5MutJ_EAj8qOjw,"Lol I am doing a M****F*****G review on Denny's seriously! Well my EX has ties to this location so he feeds me on his dime. This is the spot when I want breakfast for dinner. I always order the same, an Ultimate omelet no mushrooms, hashed browns, and a bagel w/cream cheese. Um WTF they do not have a Denver omelet on the menu. Who in the world does not have the capability to make a Denver omelet. We are talking ham, bell pepper and onion.

Why not you may ask??? Well rumor has it that to cut cost, they did away with fresh vegetables such as bell pepper. They replaced it with a fajita style bell pepper and onion mix which comes in frozen. They use it for everything now, in 5 or 6 of their menu items. So there is no way to make a Denver because it would taste funky with that crappy seasoned pepper and onion mix (frozen). 



Anyhow, I like the free entertainment this location provides! The more low end clientele, homeless, prostitutes, and idiot and ungrateful demanding hotel staff management whom holds their weekly pow wow here. This Denny's is located inside of a motel and casino for the record.

Just getting from your car to the building is an erotica of funk. Always some prostitute yelling at another, and the ""women of the night"" switching shifts on the corner!

I really feel good about myself as I am walking into the casino to the inside Denny's.
I said Denny's is horrible, but not as bad as those call girls just on the other side of the door.

The one redeeming quality in this location is that they do have Awesome music bumping every time. I am always doing the booty mix a lot sway in the booth! Lol I do I really do. Then I get hit on by a pimp in which I told to take his baby nuts a walkin before they get let a stompin!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,6,5,1,HFE7e-B5cwRLAICa4CsFaQ
