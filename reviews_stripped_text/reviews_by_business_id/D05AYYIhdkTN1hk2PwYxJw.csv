I been craving Filipino food since I moved to Vegas and thought I'd give it a try. The customer service was excellent and the owners were very friendly. The food was delicious and hit the spot. So many different food options and I love how they make it fresh. I will definitely be back!,EFcS8zR3DWImi_i7qVbuLg,0,0,5,XqhQbFfcFvR6m0aW0algFQ

1349248,2017-02-10,0,D05AYYIhdkTN1hk2PwYxJw,One of my favorite cuisines has to be Filipino food. As a long time fan and an adopted brother to a Filipino sister I have to say that I was extremely impressed by everything we tried. The owners were great and helped me pronounce something that I have been saying wrong for years apparently haha. I would definitely try the always classic Lumpia!! It is a winner for sure.,eWjOpwT29ALgoaYfTMo0oQ,0,0,5,Es_ANTypBDJqIb5KZetI9w

On yelp it says it's open but when I went there, the sign says it was closed. And this is not the first time that it happened. So unprofessional and bad reputation. I've been waiting for this restaurant to open, now that it is, they can open whenever they want to. I guess they really don't need the business.",VsTNuWTmgEZMSfcu7FyMkg,0,0,2,jiFvRnsBYIF9p6VCshqS4A

And they have La Paz Batchoy, although I'm not a fan, but my husband loves it! It's just that their location is not great, wherein people would notice their restaurant.

3432215,2016-12-20,2,D05AYYIhdkTN1hk2PwYxJw,"Based on my experience, I'll have to give 2-stars. However, I definitely want to give them another chance and plan on visiting in a few weeks from now in hopes that things have improved in it's efficiency.

From the quick encounter, I can see that the owner is genuinely a nice person, so I definitely want to see Isla Grille succeed.

Between this restaurant and the one next door, my husband and I made the decision to dine at Isla as we could see that we could get a quick meal from the outside as they already had food out in trays as we are accustomed to when visiting an establishment like Panda Express. Upon ordering, the counter worker proceeded to write down our order which I thought was odd, but okay.  For my order, I asked for half rice and half pancit. Per the counter person, they charge $1 for half-n-half. No problem, I'll pay it. 

In all fairness to the company, it was 6pm and dinner time, therefore, they were busy with taking phone orders. However, I still expect outstanding service, especially when it matters the most, during peak hours.

I paid for mines and my husband's meal. For drinks, as I saw they had a water dispenser, I told the counter help that we would just have waters. While swiping my card, the POS errored out. So once the system was cleared, I swiped my card again. When I sat down and reviewed my receipt, my husband was just placing the cups of water he got from the dispenser. Unfortunately, the receipt indicated that I was charged for two water bottles...ugh!  I returned to the counter and asked for a refund as I didn't realize they had bottled water and that the intention was to dispense our own water. The counter person sincerely apologized and attempted to figure out how to do a refund. She also asked the owner to which he also didn't know how to do a refund. And honestly, I get it because I work for a software company and I have helped many clients with having to do refunds and for some reason, it just isn't an easy task to complete. So because it didn't appear that anyone knew how to do a refund, I just took the bottled water.

So after waiting for sometime, the counter help asked from the counter, ""DO YOU WANT WHITE RICE OR GARLIC RICE!?""  I didn't even know that garlic rice was an option, so my husband and I got garlic rice. When our order finally arrived, guess what? I got all garlic rice. I looked at my receipt and could see that I was not charged for the half pancit. So this is the problem right? The food was already in trays at the counter, had the order been filled instead of written down, my husband and I wouldn't have had to wait and my order would have been correct the first time. 

My husband ordered the dinaguan (pork cooked in pork blood) and chicken adobo. He loved both. I for one will not eat dinaguan, so I'll take my husband's word. But the chicken adobo was good. I ordered the beef dish that was very good and to be different, I also got the sweet sour fish. Well, the fish was very hard. Hoping for a good experience, I attempted to eat three of the sweet sour fish to no avail. When the counter help came by to ask how we were doing and if she could take anything, I did mention to her about the fish. She did apologize but also added that because they have to keep it at a certain temperature, the heat probably dried it out. Honestly, I didn't expect a refund for the fish because they don't know how to give a refund.

Two days later, guess what? That POS error, I was charged twice! Because Isla did not know how to refund me, I called the bank to appeal the charge and it was promptly reversed. 

So with so many filipino restaurants in the vicinity, and if you're following me, you'll see that I've been to many, it's obvious that no two filipino restaurant is the same. Keep in mind that the Phillipines is made up of several islands and so the cuisine differs from the north, south and in between. This is true of Isla. So much so that their pancit even looks different from what I'm accustomed to. One of the dishes that was extremely popular the night of my visit was their soup, Batchoy, a dish I've never heard of. And because of this, I do plan to try it.

So with so many issues I encountered with Isla, I'm not mad, just disappointed and yet hopeful. There is definitely a great opportunity to improve and I would love to see Isla succeed. I'll be back in a few weeks and I'm hoping I can update this 2-star rating to 5-star.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,6,1,2,T7Ka3wyopdGFsGe2_guEug

They actually give you 2 scoops of rice and 2 eggs. The sizzling sisig was great. The palabok tastes pretty good too but I personally think it needs sahog (meat or fish). They just recently opened up. I wish them more success. I can't wait to visit again and try the other dishes they have.,qEgG0eUAFD3DOGpgrbK4Sw,3,1,5,tQzDq7886J6kwm6d8y-PfQ

They were all so nice. I ordered the Bangusilog - and for $5.99 that's a great deal. Especially after seeing the portion you get. Now for bangus, it's really hard to get it right because it can either be too crispy or too rubbery. So I took the chance with it because I really wanted bangus lol. We took the food to go and when I got home I was surprised at how much food you got for $5.99-- took a bite of the bangus- and man, that was THE BEST bangus I have ever had! The crisp was perfect, it wasn't over cooked or under cooked. It was amazing! The eggs, were also a perfect over medium, and the garlic rice was so good, the garlic was not over powering at all. 

All in all the service was great, and the food was amazing! Definitely coming back to try their lunch! :)",wxN8bY3iRGPa0Rt34_qIew,1,1,5,D7fM3ykFanr0WRB9IRwFYA

Bright, fresh decor with some rustic touches like slate and exposed wood make this place feel more homey than a typical quick serve, strip mall, restaurant.

The owners were super friendly.
 
Lots of menu options - breakfast, lunch, and catering.

Great portion size on the pancit bihon - fresh and not greesy like it can be. Oh so yummy. They even made my girl her favorite, pinak bet, even though it wasn't on the menu. Mini-lumpia melt in your mouth. 

We will be back!",8i1Tzvy_B660ffvaDAmiYA,0,1,5,rBt0Cq9dtICItISS-qYwIw
