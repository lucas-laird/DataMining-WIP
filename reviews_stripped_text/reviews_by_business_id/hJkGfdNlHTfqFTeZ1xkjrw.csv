Loved the atmosphere and the vegan food!  We painted a silhouette of the statue of liberty (the group is one made up of immigration attorneys in town) and it was great.  They served salsa with chips, puff pastries, panini sandwiches (using Daiya cheese, a tapioca based soy and nut free vegan cheese), and included in the $30 fee was the food, one drink, and the painting of course.  Can't wait to take my kids to one of their youth classes, I like that there's instruction bit no pressure to be just like the example painting.",pPh6phjoT1DlNlrApjBOyw,2,0,5,Hp2iRmleKWKgqbQYw8eCIA

I like how the instructor broke up the art piece, but sometimes when she was showing a step her body covered the painting and no one could see what she was actually doing. There was a birthday party in the class so best seats were reserved; I ended up sitting In the back. The food was tasty. Although you have to be careful not to put the brushes in your soda or take a drink from the brush cup. The seats are very uncomfortable especially when you need to sit for 3 hours and concentrate. I don't know if I would go back. It's definitely a must try for locals in Vegas; something different.",pVVZNEnU-e6GND6oJF-vMg,0,0,3,Zbt7aLZk8Kea482xuSZI0Q

For me, the painting takes so much concentration that, for three hours, no other stresses in my life even cross my mind. Add some wine and yummy food and all the cares in the world are temporarily gone!  It's true that some instructors are better than others but, out of all my paintings, there's really only a couple that I don't totally love. You really do have to just be patient and go with the flow. It's amazing how your painting takes shape during the class, even when you aren't sure that it will. I also enjoy the personal attention. The staff remembers me and they make me feel welcome. I highly recommend a class here for a girls' night out. Also the kid classes are fun, too!",XJneFBRQi1cH0VR8ypv_zg,2,0,5,kQVVLTpHZ0Qf4YhLlYAfqw

1. CLEAN THE GUM FROM OUT UNDER YOUR STOOLS AND TABLES! 
2. Make sure when you serve your Spring Rolls that they aren't frozen and cold in the middle. 
3. When are you going to have some paintings of better quality?

I have been there 2 times and both times the Artist seemed to struggle with explaining the painting which confused half of the class even more than they already were. I have experienced and painted at a lot these types of companies through out the west coast, and yours is nothing special. I have used both of my Groupons and will NOT return.

239736,2015-10-13,0,hJkGfdNlHTfqFTeZ1xkjrw,"So far I've been to one class at this location with a friend, and we loved it. Oddly enough, we chose Starry Night as our first attempt at painting, which turned out rather hilariously on my side, but overall it was an excellent experience. The staff is great, and our instructor was Jenny (or Jennifer, whichever she prefers), and we immediately got on board with her sense of humor. 

My friend and I had never painted something like Starry Night before, so we had no idea what to expect. Jenny walked the entire class through the painting step by step, and it was SO EASY. 

They have a great food & drink selection to go along with your artistic attempts, and my only suggestion would to be to GET THERE EARLY. We showed up *right* at 6:30, and were lucky to get seats together in the back of the room. It wasn't a big deal though, they let you get up and take pictures of the example painting, and do have monitors for those sitting in the back of the room. 

It's perfect for date night, a night out with the girls, or just getting out on your own. Keep an eye out for sales on their website & Facebook page, as well as Groupon. I'd rather spend the time and money doing this than wasting my time & money at a bar being bored. Seriously, go try it. I promise you'll love it.",Jmlqb5UYfygtUXugrpywjg,3,0,5,zqErnZ9WpDMCo52nel3b8A

It was new for me to have a real meal in addition to painting, but they made it work. I had one of their paninis and it was delicious! 

The only star I knocked off was because the set up has it so that there are two long painting tables. It makes the space a little tight but intimate. Sometimes I had to move or stand up to see what our artist had just painted. However, they do have a camera on the artist's canvas and a TV closer to the back of the room for those sitting back there. It wasn't anything that hindered my experience, though. They had a handful of different designs and my friend felt special on her birthday. I think 90% of the groups that were there, were there for a birthday.

1865437,2018-03-03,0,hJkGfdNlHTfqFTeZ1xkjrw,"I've painted at several of these type venues in town.  This one is by far the worst.  Here's why:

- location is tiny.  Think 2 car garage size.  40 or so people crammed around long tables facing 90 degrees away from the instructor, plus food, drinks, and paint.  Messy and lots of spills, easels toppling over, etc. 

- the platform for the instructor isn't high enough.  YOU CAN'T SEE!  There is a TV monitor on the ceiling, but there's a light in front of it creating a glare, plus the room is so small that it doesn't help.  You either crane your neck to see around the person in front of you, or give yourself a headache trying to look up.

- no reserved seating, so you have to go early.  Check-in was a complete mess because the staff got confused about which seats were already taken, so we just stood there for a while.

- no sinks or places to wash up.  Want to know how you rinse your brushes? with a water cooler and a trash can.

- no places to store your purse or bag.  You can't put it on the floor and there's no room to put it next to you because it's so cramped.  There is a small shelf that looks like it's intended for bags, but staff didn't mention it, plus only the people sitting right next to it would be able to use it securely.

- no outside food or drinks.  This place is more focused on selling food and drinks than painting.  It was really distracting to have waitstaff running around constantly.  There's nowhere to eat because it's so cramped.  Also, how can you eat finger food like pizza and sandwiches when your hands are covered in paint?

- bathrooms were gross! put in a fan or at least clean them before the class starts.

- no helpers.  Most painting venues have staff going around to give you more paint, paper towels, offer help, etc.  I had to ask a waitstaff employee for paint since I ran out.  He rolled his eyes and grabbed a plate from a no-show.

- poorly paced.  Seriously, we spent 90 minutes taking breaks to eat and paint a background.  When it got to the actual detail, the instructor rushed us and kept skipping ahead.

- worst of all, the instructor.  I won't use her name but will call her S.  I suppose some people think her sarcastic Cake Boss-esque humor is funny, but I found her rude and obnoxious.  She would just say stuff like ""paint a yellow line"" whereas most instructors would say ""mix 2 scoops of yellow and 1 scoop of orange, add 2 drops of water, and paint a line the width of a pencil about 6 inches long"".  I get that you're encouraged to be creative, but that's why we take the classes: to learn.  We need that guidance.  Maybe if she'd reduced the number of eye-rolling dirty jokes and spent more time guiding us with the actual painting experience, my painting wouldn't have wound up in the trash.

- The class started late, but she went over the top calling out a few people that came in late.  She kept talking about wanting to go home on time.  I don't think anyone was finished at the end.  We were trying to finish but both S and the waitstaff started throwing away our paint.

- Perhaps most insulting was a canned email sent afterwards, inviting us to leave a positive review on Yelp and to address negative issues via email.  Maybe that's why the reviews here are so positive.

I can give them 2 stars simply because the music level was reasonable, unlike some other venues that think they're a nightclub.  Aside from a social media contest to give away a bottle of wine, they weren't too annoying with photos and social media like other venues.",8SN6B3cUKkonmN2WEabjyA,0,0,2,Yuy9VKhc17lXN9HSOiusGw

SO sad to say not only is new ownership not vegan, the employee (Avery) that checked us in made a very snide remark about vegans to me. As she checked my name off the roster she said ""Have you been here before? We aren't vegan now, we serve real food now."" She laughed sarcastically. She was also the paint instructor for this session. 
I let her know I was vegan and that she should choose her audience more wisely if she doesn't know the person or their lifestyle choices.
(She also played music that had pretty explicit lyrics during the class, and kept referencing getting drunk or vegas-y activities.  Very uncouth.)
I was shocked at what an unprofessional and ignorant thing she would say..not even one minute that I was in the door! Had I not already paid online, I'd probably just leave.

2252446,2013-02-25,0,hJkGfdNlHTfqFTeZ1xkjrw,I patronize all the businesses in town that offer painting classes.  Design & Wine is top knotch.  In addition to the instructor in class there are always additional artists working who are there to assist you if you need help.  The paintings they teach you to do are always cute and with their skilled instruction anyone can complete a nice looking painting.  They serve food and wine at this establishment.  The food is delicious and very reasonably priced.  If you order wine they give you a small portion of spicy pickled vegetables to munch on.  If you order a canned soda with a glass of ice they will give you free refills.  Most places that serve beverages in cans do not do that.  They recently installed a camera positioned on the artist teaching and then a monitor half way back in the room so those in the back can see what is going on.  None of the other similar businesses in town have such a nice feature.  This is my favorite place in town to take a painting class.

A friend asked me to come along with her and I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. However, it was exactly what they say it is: Design and Wine. 
When you arrive you check in and they provide you with a menu to order food and wine. Then, you get settled with your canvas and they brief you on what to expect. Don't worry if you can't draw worth a lick - they've been expecting you and know how to walk you through creating something halfway decent, step by step.
Run out of wine? No worries, someone is walking around making sure you're getting your fill. 
And somehow at the end, you'll feel pretty proud about what you've created. Mine is actually hanging in my living room. :)

Pros:
*  Extremely friendly staff (everyone interacted w/ us throughout the night). 
*  Easy to follow painting instructions that is perfect for all painters of all skill levels.
*  They serve food and you guessed it...wine!  
*  The menu had healthier food options and even has Vegetarian options!
*  Decently priced 
*  Clean and inviting atmosphere

Cons:
* No wine license as of yet, but in the defense of Design & Wine they are not totally open to the public as of yet.  We got invited to special soft-opening.

Overall:
  This place is awesome.  The layout is spacious and everyone is friendly.  Everyone had an incredible time and we got to share our paintings with everyone.  This is definitely something different to do in Vegas and is good for all age levels and skill levels.  It's something that we'd definitely do again and highly encourage others to try.  I can't wait until their grand opening.  They'll have their liquor license.  I imagine the experience being triple the fun! =)

Tips:  
* Dress comfortable.  Classes are 3 hours and you do not want to be uncomfortable
* A little paint goes a long way.  Half a pump of whatever color paint you get is plenty.
* Bring your camera so you can take Kodak moments of your Design & Wine night!
* Add Design & Wine on your FB for special deals and promos!",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,5,3,5,CMgjl4mQ3xVPNQRmVOhUjA

I believe that in the service industry you should always give 100% because that is what keeps people coming back.  Well Design & Wine always gives that 100% and more and they keep me coming back.  

I found this company on Facebook and was there the first night they opened and have watched this company grow over the last year.  Their goal is to make each customer happy and to leave there with great memories and a picture they would be proud to display( I display all of mine).  Yes, I have been there several times over the last year and have taken many family and friends with me and they always have a great time too.  In fact several of them have been back....without me!

I have gained confidence in my skill of painting because of the instruction I have received.  The staff is busy when they have a sold out class, but never to busy to stop and answer your questions or show/explain how to get the most from the brush strokes.  I don't think I'm ready to strike out on my own yet, besides I love the atmosphere, the food and most of all the staff!

If you are looking for something different to do, without having to go to the strip, the clubs or the movies this would be it.  I highly recommend this activity and this company.

So much fun and the food is decent and brought right to you quickly as you paint and fairly priced. Find a painting you'd like to make on their website checking out the event calendar.

V was our instructor and she was super sweet and helped anyone who needed it. I haven't painted since art class in high school and was pretty discouraged by my painting but V helped me out on fixing what needed to be fixed. 

Staff came around often to refresh food and drink orders. Last call gets you a half price drink. If you bought an appetizer and entree you got a free dessert. 

They stick around to take your picture with your friends with your completed paintings and take pictures throughout the night to put on their Facebook.

The salsa could have been a little more spicy but I'm guessing they dont make it very spicy due to the fact some people cant handle spicy.

Once you get there it's first come first serve seating so it's best to show up 15 mins prior to ensure you can seat your group together. They provide you with the canvas, paint, tools and an apron. The drinks & food isn't included however. Wine runs about $7 a glass and beer was $5. All the food options were vegetarian so if you're a meat eater I recommend an early bite beforehand.

4620426,2013-03-05,1,hJkGfdNlHTfqFTeZ1xkjrw,"We had a great time at Design and Wine on Saturday night. There seem to be several of these painting class companies now. I don't think that's a bad thing. I believe there's room in Vegas for all of them to coexist.

I've tried Wine and Canvas twice and I thoroughly enjoyed them. The advantage of Design and Wine (try to keep the names straight) is that they have their own physical location complete with a food and drink menu. And yes, they have their liquor license. As your hosts might tell you, your brushwork just improves when alcohol joins the party.

I can't rate their food because we were still full during the class. I did enjoy a glass of unidentified Merlot. I'm not sure if it improved my artwork, but I walked away fairly happy with the result. Our particular painting turned out to be rather complex. There were many steps involved to reach the end product (definitely more than my previous two pieces). As a result, we felt a little rushed at times. Keep in mind that the class even went half an hour longer than scheduled. I have no complaints, however. The instructor did a fine job of guiding us throughout the evening.

So overall, they get five watercolor stars from me. If I could make a suggestion, it would be to ditch the single TV monitor in the ceiling and have a TV monitor on each side wall instead. Since each row of painters faces one of the two walls, it would be right in front of them.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,5,4,5,SfD9jDXIVHuqAlxfSv8VNw

Pricing: a class is 35.00 but there are often specials and discounts running. A class is about 3 hours long so it's pretty cheap for a fun night out 

Staff: amazing! The artists and servers are
friendly and accommodating. On my most recent visit, I had an injury and they were wonderful about making sure I was comfortable! The artists are great at explaining everything and making sure that everyone is feeling good about what they are doing. Plus they are all super friendly and fun! 

Food: they have a decent menu. A lot of ""carb-y"" food so not great for those of us who are carb free but I think it's worth it for a cheat now and then! The cheesecake is delicious and I love the Alfredo toast! The service is quick and the prices are decent. 

Drinks: they now have their liquor license so a variety of beer and wine are offered. They also have water, soda and coffee. The drinks come quickly and they offer free refills on non-alcoholic drinks!

5278199,2015-07-17,5,hJkGfdNlHTfqFTeZ1xkjrw,"Another Groupon steal for $24! Once I seen there was an upcoming class where a sugar skull was going to be painted, I signed up for the class ASAP. Design & Dine has three locations in the valley, and I attended the Las Vegas location on S. Durango in the shopping strip that houses Zaba's and Checkers. I've done maybe 4 painting classes total (not all with Design & Dine), so I'm pretty familiar with these types of classes. 

PRO TIP: Get here early! The class started at 6:30PM and I walked in at 6:17PM. It was already really packed and I had to sit towards the back. No worries though because Design & Dine has a TV screen hung up on the ceiling that's focused on the instructor's canvas to allow those in the back to see what's going on.  

The instructor leads the class step-by-step to recreate a painting on canvas. For the skull, she gave everyone a lot of leeway for creative expression. For the most part, everyone will walk away with a canvas that's similar to the instructors. I always feel like I'm behind at these classes but eventually catch up. There's a 15 minute break offered to the class but it seemed like most people took this time to continue working on their canvases.

Food and beverages are available to order. The menu was mostly composed of salads, wraps, and sandwiches. For those eating, you kind of have to multi-task and make room on the table where you're painting. The servers take your orders at the beginning of the class and bring out the food during the break. 

GOOD TO KNOW: They have a stamp card. The 10th class is free!

Worth a Return Trip?
I'm a big fan of group painting classes and the fact that you get to take a piece of art you created home with you at the end of the night. Design & Dine is well organized and the instructor, Jennifer, had a great sense of humor and was easy to follow. Only suggestion I'd make is to lower the volume of the music and stop skipping songs midway. I can only take so much Top 40 guys.

My boyfriend and I took his Mom to one of their classes while she was in town. We arrived right on the hour and found it difficult to find 3 seats together, but he sat next to his Mom, and I was across the isle, not far. I'm sure if we'd showed up a little early seating wouldn't have been a problem so that was our fault. There were several people who weren't there on time, and I thought it was kind that they waited a little bit to get started so those people wouldn't be totally behind.

Our paining was of the 'Welcome to Las Vegas' sign. Apparently this was one of their more difficult classes, which we hadn't known when we booked it, but they made it feel super easy. The instructors were very nice, one lead the class while another walked around and helped. I even got a compliment from one of them on how well I was doing, which was nice because I felt like my painting looked terrible compared to the instructor's.

They were patient and went step by step with simple instructions. Our painting had a lot of measurements but they made it so simple and easy, providing rulers and even paper cups to help with the circles. In the end we were all 3 pleasantly surprised at how good our paintings turned out. It made us feel like we had some real talent (which we don't), but we felt so good with our finished products we are definitely going back again!

The only food we ordered was a pizza, which honestly was not good, but others ordered sandwiches, appetizers, etc. that actually looked amazing. The only thing that could have made our experience better would have been a glass or bottle of wine, but now we have that to look forward to on our next visit!

The painting instructions were relatively easy to follow. It went a little fast, but really everyone has their own painting pace. And there were always moments where we could ask for help from the instructor as she walked around to see how we were doing. 
The food tastes really good. The portions are okay. But I'm not gonna give 4 b/c of that. That's silly. Free refills of sodas though!! I had 2 hehe.
All in all, it was a really fun time. Got to sit and commune with the random strangers around me! It was a really nice atmosphere and everyone, stranger, server, and teacher alike were so kind and sweet. Needless to say, but I shall continue with it anyway, my mom had an absolutely wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed her birthday present. (I enjoyed it lots too!!)
Got to keep our paintings too  

Some Tips:

Food is expensive - trying to save? Eat before you come and just snack or drink soda/beer (free soda refills!!) | Not trying to save? Chow down! The food is amazing. Small proportions for the price doe.

Bring a seat cushion - the seats aren't all too comfortable. Especially if you don't have a lot of meat on your bones

You are going to get paint on you are your hands. They supply aprons, but wear expendable clothes. 

Be patient. You're not gonna like your painting right away. Remember, you're not an artist (or maybe you are). In either case, take a deep breath and just keep at it, but don't freak out. It'll turn out nicely. Still think it sucks? Ask for help or for another's opinion. The littlest change can make the biggest difference. 

The S Durango location allows 13+ children/teens/young adults

Check in on Yelp!! - great savings to be had

Change your water every now and then once in class

HAVE FUN - Don't come in with a judgey attitude. No one likes a sourpuss. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy~",HEH6N8C0xQrheWHbb5nGIA,2,1,5,mOnOL5N5YFQx66pWwRKjug

5778501,2014-03-19,1,hJkGfdNlHTfqFTeZ1xkjrw,"What's better than learning how to paint? Getting served wine and food in the process!

I am such a big fan of this whole concept. You get to buy admission to a painting you want to learn how to do and while learning you get to sip on wine and munch down on appetizers, entrees, and desserts. 

I received my first ever Design & Wine admission as a gift from my best friend. The actual class started at 6:30, but we arrived at 6:00 thinking it was going to be packed and that all the good seats were going to be taken. Fortunately, it was pretty much empty and we were able to get good seats and reserve some as well. After checking you in, they give you a sheet in which you place your orders. They have appetizers (not too fond of croissants), along with entrees (sandwiches mainly), and desserts. My eyes trailed to the alcohol section and of course me and my girls had to get their moscato. It's super sweet! The instructor even offered a happy hour deal towards the end of class causing us to get another glass of their moscato ;)

The painting lesson itself is pretty easy. They walk you through everything and even lend a hand when needed. They go over the different brushes and what to do if paint is running on your canvas or if you need to change your paint water.

You can go on their website and choose what painting you want to learn and even reserve certain dates for special events. It was my first time going, but will definitely not be my last.

PS: definitely look into their date nights. You and your significant other (or best friend) can work together and paint a big canvas. The painting is usually something long that will take up 2 canvases. One paints the left canvas and the other the right - when put together it becomes one picture.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,2,1,5,0amw5CMS0mbox4JQ5LgqDg

I would recommend that you check their website before you go so you know what you will be painting. My wife and I painted the same picture but with our own twist. You can also make group reservations and paint with all of your friends. Definitely going to do this again! Paint night date night with my wife!,MzYSSZ7Bxvq9cUbzIKvcHA,0,0,5,g8_cueCxlk_B1KwK9sNnPg

The paint class started right on time. The instructor was super nice and fun. They did some fun games and they did some things for me for my birthday. I am glad I tried this class, it was fun and relaxing. I will definitely be back.",8oNbx_xxll_oNUh-x-s16g,1,1,5,9gZdDfzcRK_dnEOw_MW9gA

Not being the artistic type, I wasn't super excited about the painting part but I was really excited to spend quality time with my girlfriends. 

All the instructors and waiters were amazing. Incredibly friendly and attentive. They supplied us with refills on drinks and paint regularly and were always there to help if we needed assistance on a our painting. 

The food options were pretty great as well. Everything is cooked on site and luckily everything tasted good and was reasonably priced as well.  They serve appetizers right away but the entrees don't come out until about an hour and a half into the three hour session. Important to know in case you come here starving like we did, but we learned that the hard way. Still not too bad a wait.

The whole class was fun and entertaining. I feel the only thing that could probably be improved upon is the class size. I think that fact that the class was on the large side made it stall in parts and it was hard to keep everyone on the same page, especially when a lot of the students were imbibing on wine and other spirits. 

We still had a blast and look forward to planning another outing here soon. My office is even looking into renting the place out for a private party, which would be a lot of fun.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,6,4,o0MSAbH8BG2wWS_QTfoBiw

I found out why soon enough. The staff is amazeballs! Our teacher was funny, patient and eager to praise us for our artistic skills. The food was great, and reasonably priced. The wine selection was good too. 

I will be coming back. This place is too much fun to pass by!",xuvMypjj570HB-OOP1rwMg,8,4,5,dglG51plpzUEQEHGOV4PNA
