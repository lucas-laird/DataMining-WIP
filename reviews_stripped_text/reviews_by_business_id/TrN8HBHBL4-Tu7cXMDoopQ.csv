Good size shrimp and the walnut sauce is what I expected.  Salt and pepper pork chops is my favorite.   It reminds me of this family chinese place we used to go in Long Beach,  CA.  Fish with black bean sauce was good also.  I wasn't too crazy about the appetizer,  BBQ ribs,  it was a lil tough.   Defintely going back to this place.

Delivery was fast and the delivery guy was very nice and efficient. The best fried rice I have ever tasted , it was so moist and perfect . The egg rolls were huge and crispy on the outside and fresh veggies inside . Beef chow mein was fresh and had big moist tender pieces of beef in it and the noodles were cooked perfect .

This place is great. They even have signs up showing the awards they've won, and they've earned them. They're general gao's chicken is one of the best I've found anywhere. It's light and crispy and doesn't have a heavy sauce weighing it down. The rice is perfect and flavorful. The crab rangoons are good too. The egg rolls were good but not my favorite. My friends really enjoyed their chow mein and shrimp and broccoli. The broccoli was perfectly cooked and there was plenty of shrimp as well. It was hot and fresh, not something that sat around for a while. The ultimate best part is if you come before 3pm the lunch specials are suppppper cheap.

The waitress was very friendly and the portions are generous, it doesn't make up for the fact that the broccoli in my food was way overcooked and the rice was still crunchy.  

But my main complaint about this restaurant is that it is DIRTY!  I moved the salt shaker to make more room on the table and I could feel the layers of dust and grease on it.  The bathroom was beyond description.

357984,2013-10-08,0,TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ,"Came here once before and dined in (in my pre yelp days) and it was great. Been searching for a good go to Chinese place since I moved from NY and this one certainly met the mark.

Food: had the sesame chicken, hot and sour soup, she had the chicken chow mein, and pot stickers. Chicken was just crispy enough without being burnt and not slimey by any means. Hot and sour soup was very good, had a good spice to it, although I wouldn't have minded a bit more. Her chicken chow mein was delicious, cooked perfectly an had great seasoning to it.

Staff: very friendly, talked to us a bit and were very attentive. 

Ambiance: just how I remember my favorite Chinese place in NY, has the retro feel with the Chinese New Year calendars as a placement. 7 booths and 3 tables.

All in all, I can't wait to come back and get more Chinese again! Where have you been the past 2 years of my life!

*update - ordered take out today. Staff was great and it didn't take too long to wait (I just walked in and didn't call ahead - kind of a last minute decision). Food was great as usual. They were able to prepare the pot stickers steamed instead of fried. I tried the shrimp low mein, and it was amazing. Noodles were cooked perfect and shrimp tasted fresh.

563198,2013-10-10,1,TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ,"I gave this restaurant three stars because they made some of the best Chinese food take-out I've had in Vegas, but that's not to say it was very good... For some reason Vegas has really terrible Chinese food and I'm usually relieved if I don't get food poisoning from it. In New York and Fort Lauderdale there is some AMAZING Chinese food and the delivery guy will get to you in ten minutes even if it is pouring rain outside. Anyway, if I was grading this place based on all of the Chinese food I've ever had I would give it two stars. If I were grading on a curve (since we are in Vegas) I'd give it about 3 and a half stars. I decided to rate it in the middle as a result.

Now let's breakdown the food: my girlfriend and I ordered the Poo Poo Platter as well as the Kungpow Shrimp and the Broccoli Beef. The Poo Poo Platter consisted of Crab Ragoons that were 90% cream cheese. Meh. The Egg Rolls were good smothered in chili garlic sauce and soy sauce, but they were some of the greasiest things I've ever eaten. Then there was a sweet pork thing on a skewer, not a ton of meat on it and I just wasn't a fan. There was this weird piece of chicken wrapped in tinfoil that seemed like it was baked in soy sauce and it was DELICIOUS. My favorite part of the whole meal. I would eat that again.The shrimp in the Kungpow Shrimp was good, but everything else kind of sucked. There was a ton of waterchesnuts in the Kungpow Shrimp and I hate waterchesnuts, but there was also a ton of undercooked zucchini that gave the dish a really crunchy texture. Ew. Also, the sauce on the kungpow shrimp wasn't even spicy. Maybe they gave me the wrong dish? I don't know. The beef in the broccoli beef was chewy and the sauce was sweet. My girlfriend liked it, but I didn't. I did like the Broccoli Beef better than the Kungpow Shrimp though. Also, the Broccoli Beef didn't heat up well and I didn't even bother to eat the Kungpow Shrimp.

I'm really surprised that this place has such amazing reviews. I may have gotten a crappy meal because I ordered right before they closed, but I asked if that was okay and the woman on the phone said yes. If she had said no it wouldn't have been a problem and I would've just called somewhere else. I am not impressed and I'm not ordering from Golden Flower again. I'll be going out of state for my Chinese food from now on.",6VhDHuE8RsB0iBG_zSKy1Q,1,1,3,F3vNKTOiyO8mS1NuDPLJVw

We tried the following:
Tempura shrimp = tasty, light and perfectly cooked.
Eggrolls = okay tasting but extremely greasy (HOT oils down the chest when biting into one not the best experience.)
Kung POW Chicken = okay flavor but overrun with cheap filler of zucchini and the peanuts tossed over the top as an after thought not cooked in to pick up the flavors.
Shrimp Fried Rice = Shrimp cooked perfectly however the rest was flavorless; plain rice with barely any color, white onions and egg.

818563,2013-12-18,0,TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ,"I'd say this place is pretty standard on what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant. We ordered one of their dinner packages last night, knowing our 2 small children would pick off what we had. The total with tax was $29.00 and came with a HUGE amount of food! My husband really liked everything we got. Mongolian beef, sweet and sour shrimp, special fried rice, BBQ ribs, egg rolls, wonton soup, and fried shrimp.  It was a lot! My kids love wonton soup, but seemed more interested in the crunchy toppings. I wasn't a big fan of the sweet and sour shrimp as it had too much batter for my taste. So much batter - the shrimp resembled onion rings. Lol! Their fried rice was enormous, and I'd definitely order it again.  

I saw that they had duck, and mu shoo, among other things. As a former employee of PF Changs, I grew to really like these particular items that for some odd reason they do not serve anymore.

Seemed to have decent reviews so we went there this evening.

It was really good.  I have to say the service was top notch.  I guess we got there just after 6:00 PM so at first I thought the service was so good because there were not that many other customers there.  But the place started filling up and they still kept up just fine.  Service was just super the whole time.  

We ordered just standard Chinese restaurant fare - sweet and sour pork, house fried rice, chicken teriyaki, house special chow mein.  It was all just really good, basic Chinese food, cooked fine, and tasty.  Also had won ton soup and it was particularly delicious.  The prices were quite reasonable.

Glad to have found a neat place we can stop by after dance class when we are too busy to cook at home.  Plus the place just seemed comfortable; a nice place to relax as well.

So went on Google and typed in ""best Chinese food south east Las Vegas"".. And Golden Flower popped up on Yelp! With 17 Reviews and 4 Solid stars so I thought id give it a try. After pulling in at the East Russel and Pecos address I thought this is pretty ghetto in a run down crappy strip mall. But a beacon of Hope appeared in the form of the golden flower! LOL  It was the only nice looking place in the strip mall with a nice looking store front and a menu of today's specials right out front.. Walked in and was told to sit where ever i want! That's a plus! No being guided to the table in the middle of the room.. 
The service was on par with almost perfect and not the desperate for tips feeling you get with some places where they check on you every 30 seconds. We started with the Teriyaki chicken sticks and wow they really delivered! Then went on with the Walnut Shrimp with Chicken fried rice and Kung Pao Chicken with steamed rice.. Im Knocking a star do to the food not being brought to the table all together. To much time in between dishes. Fried rice 20 minutes before an entree? really?

1236445,2017-06-10,0,TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ,"We decided to do takeout when we ordered from this restaurant. When it got home, we could tell they overstocked each styrofoam box to the peak with as much food as possible, causing it to spill and stick everywhere.

The rice was probably the best part about the food - both fried and steamed. It was the right moisture and texture.

The sesame chicken was pretty decent - the sauce tasted good, but it was outnumbered by too many vegetables, undermining its name. The general tso's chicken was not a typical ""general tso's"" look or taste. There was hardly any spice and there was barely any sauce or seasoning applied. The sesame chicken was good, but pretty soggy, which took away from the taste and texture.

The lo mein was very rubbery and ""artificial."" It tasted as if it had just been pressed from a plastic mold from a factory.

Overall, we were not completely impressed with the food, but also understand and recognize that our experience was solely based on the takeout food. Dining inside the restaurant could be a completely different experience, and one must try it for his/herself.

Update June 10th, 2017: A few family members have become ill the next morning after eating; there's a possibility that food poisoning has occurred. Proceed with caution.",9w_a5igs7jLa48waa9E9Cw,0,0,2,so2F6SI7zAMRes9tpbmAqQ

1612490,2017-08-11,0,TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Vegas-Voyager approved! Nice venue, quality/tasty product, excellent entrée portion-to-price, 85% 4 & 5-star reviews, RJ's Best of LV Chinese in 2002, 2008 & 2012. How could putting your chips down on a meal here be a sucker bet?

The venue is small, quaint, unpretentious, well-kept, neatly-appointed. A sit-down restaurant. A family operation. Certainly not a breath-taking venue, not FIRST-date quality, but certainly later-date quality. You can take your family, friends, bf/gf, co-workers here without the embarrassment you might feel picking up the tab at a more typical ""wok-u-up take-out"" joint. 

The space is very small (pictures uploaded). There are nine nice burgundy faux-leather 4-top booths, two matching 6-top corner/curved burgundy banquettes and three free-standing small 4-top tables in the center. That's it. Small. Guess that keeps the rent down - allowing for high-quality & high-portioning.

I dined under the dinner menu. WonTon soup $2.25. (This portion was a wee bit small ... and was a good bit shy of the incredibly mouth-watering photographs of their WonTon posted by other Yelpers). Two good-sized crispy egg rolls ($3.50). Ginger Beef in Oyster Sauce, $10. Dinner entrées can be upgraded to 'a meal' with egg drop soup (or egg roll) & pork fried rice for $2. 

The portion of the beef entrée was enormous, four servings, enough for two. Big bowl of white rice on the side, comp. Everything was quite tasty, well seasoned. The beef was more tender-than-average. There's REAL ginger in there and plenty of it! Service was prompt and effective.

The soft background music was delivered by Vegas station Sunny 106.5 FM. Officially branded as Adult Contemporary, heavy on 80's and 90's up-tempo pop.  I heard Thriller (Michael Jackson), Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go (Wham!), Take On Me (a-ha), Never Gonna Give You Up (Rick Astley). That sort of thing. 

And the fortunes in my cookies were truly inspiring; my future has real hope! 

Sure to return!

CONCLUSIONS: Regarding non-casino, non-ACYE, dine-in Chinese in my general area, I am currently down for three venues: this one, Amlee (also reviewed) ... and (down in old-school, Water Street Henderson) Rose Garden (offering good lunch deals if you are in the neighborhood). 

I am still keeping an eye out for one of those classic, Mid-Century, red&black, heavily-Oriental-décored lux venues near me. My childhood in NYC spoiled me to such, I suppose. Haven't seen it yet!

In the meantime, these three aforementioned spaces are clean, nicely-appointed and present good food....",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,6,0,5,6w78gTIht57E6oPDKejNpg

The die chose this restaurant from a long list of available locations.    A new place for us but we have been looking for some great chinese food, by we, I mean my friends and I.

Upon arrival, I was instructed by the die to get an appetizer of my choice, Fried shrimp--came out super hot and was fantastic!

My friend Gary tried a soda of our friend Polly's choice, he ordered a dr pepper.   She had to get an appetizer of the die's choice, it ordered some teriyaki beef sticks.   They were chewy but had good flavor.

The waiter brought us crab rangoon for free because we mentioned that we had never been there before and also the chef sent out some paper wrapped chicken for us-on the house as well!

One thing I love is that you order food here and its brought out on a plate and its HUGE portions and everyone can share and take what they like, some restaurants bring you individual portions which is ok but this is much better.

Booths were a bit lower so I sat on my foot to be even with everyone else but it was very clean and comfortable inside.  The waiter, Wilson I believe was his name was very attentive, he was friendly and kept coming over to check up on us, offering us refills as well.

The prices are AMAZING!

We ordered 3 drinks
3 appetizers
2 entrees
Rice and egg foo yung and all of that for $62!

Plus the 2 free items and the fortune cookies of course!

The bathroom as a bonus is Private which I love, call me strange if you havent already but I like a nice clean private bathroom   :)

Luckly, we both like Golden Flower enough to eat here with a satisfying frequency for me without becoming an overdone schedule for him. Double bonus points!

The staff are all very friendly and attentive. For whatever reason, I always drink a TON of water at this place and I have never found myself asking where the refill was... it was always spot on and never did I run out. 

We are pretty regular here, so much so that we generally don't even get handed menu's anymore. Hubby usually always gets the sesame chicken and I alternate between also getting the sesame chicken or the black pepper chicken, with the black pepper being the current favorite.

My boyfriend and I ordered from here earlier and it was delicious. It took about 30-40 minutes for the food to arrive. We ordered the whole roast duck [a huge styrofoam takeout container stuffed with crispy-skinned, savory roast duck], the mongolian beef [a smokey, chile & green onion infused beef on top of crisped tiny noodles] and the appetizer platter [2 eggrolls- stuffed with cabbage but yummy, 2 fried shrimp- mushy and obviously frost bitten  and my least favorite thing, 2 'rangoons'- on the menu I ordered from online they were called 'shrimp puffs' but they were just wontons stuffed w/cream cheese and deep fried and 2 bbq pork ribs- the sauce was like a candy coating, crispy, caramelized and sweet with tender pork inside].

Overall the food was quite good, especially the duck. The skin was crisp and much of the fat had been rendered, leaving a tender and flavorful meat to gnaw at. The coating seemed hoisin based, but it was delicious! It came with a thick brown syrupy sauce to dunk, but I found the sauce worked well for the eggrolls as well. The eggrolls were crisp on the outside with moist, slightly-crunchy steamed cabbage. I liked the eggrolls as they were fairly light, despite being deepfried. The mongolian beef was a nice change of pace from the kind we usually get, served in thai restaurants. Often those versions have a lot of bell peppers and huge chunks of onion, while this version offered sauteed green onions and dried chiles, lending a more aromatic flavor and subtle texture. The tiny crisped noodles were a yummy touch, soaking up the soy-infused sauce oozing out of the beef. The pork ribs tasted candy coated from the thick sweet sauce that had hardened on the outside, but it contrasted well with the tender meat underneath. I'm no master of chinese-style bbq pork, however, so I'm not really qualified. ;} It was pretty tasty, though. The wontons were crisp, simple, snacky american-ized food. Tasty, but not something I would seek out again. They're so dastardly simple, it's almost embarassing to order them out. 

I would imagine the food isn't particularly authentic, but it's pretty yummy. It looks like they have some good lunch & dinner deals for cheap, so it's a good option if you're in the neighborhood. I look forward to trying more of their items!

Also, the portion sizes are ginormous. We payed $45.13 for our order, but we'll get at least 6 meals out of it [or 3 for the boy and i each",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,3,2,4,suYpGz_jE6141cOzDz7qrw

 If you are long time fan you will remember the beautiful Grandma sitting at the end booth by the kitchen, who would get up and greet every customer with the warmest smile. It was a true family restaurant and won the RJ Best of Las Vegas  because of the hospitality, and of course the best tasting Chinese Food around.

My family misses them to this day, and still talks about how wonderful the restaurant was.

From the moment you walk in, the decor is a little on the older side. The ladies serving us were friendly towards us, but we're very strict to each other when it came to work. They were very efficient and almost robotic when it came to taking orders, bringing out food and clearing plates. 

As for the food, it's more about the memories than the taste. If it means something, everything was fried fresh, hot and was crispy. The food was super oily, super salty and made me feel like a blimp afterwards. But you know what?! I grew up eating this stuff so I loved every bit of it. Thank goodness for the gym though.

We decided to share a popo platter and a war wonton soup. I thought we would need to order an entree after that but boy was I mistaking. 

The server immediately brought us fried noodles, sweet sauce and hot mustard with our waters. 

The popo platter was served in a round two level platter with the top level lit like a very tiny grill that held 2 skewers of beef. The lower level had two spring rolls, two, giant BBQ ribs, two paper wrapped chicken, two large fried shrimp, and four cream cheese rangoons. Everything was exceptionally delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

The war wanton soup was huge and jam packed with goodies and not over powered with just vegetables. The meat was perfect and the shrimp was delicious as was the broth. 

Needless to say, I ate until I was pleasantly full and their was still some left over for mom to take to lunch. The best part...our bill was under $20.00. 

I will return here and look forward to trying many things on the reasonably priced menu. I also noticed as we walked in a chalkboard that listed about 10 entrees on special. But most everything was under 10.00.

The Kung Pow chicken was flavorful, but should have been spicy as it had the pepper icon by it.  So, not the best.

The Chicken Chow Mein was awful.  There was nothing wrong with the chicken.  It was weird looking, but tasted good and no weird texture.  I think they must pound it first so it looks different than usual.  The noodles were the average type used, but the sauce they used on it just tasted awful.  I have had Chow Mein in no less than 30 places in my life and they usually taste pretty similar and are a almost sweet soy flavor.  This was just bad.  Won't order it again.

I've lived in Vegas for almost 20 years and thanks to yelp reviews, just barely became aware of this little place's existence that's practically a hop and a skip away from my neighborhood.

I've only gone in for lunch, but their specials are unequivocally unrivaled. Ranging between $5.95 and $6.95, you get the most bang for your buck with your choice of entree (I always get the shrimp chow mein - the shrimps are so plump, too) accompanied with your choice of sweet+sour or egg flower soup, plain or fried rice, a spring roll, and a cream cheese rangoon. And the portions are a-plenty. Lunch for two with drinks is easily attainable for around $20, tip included.

The place itself looks unassuming. Inside, I love the small, cozy feel and the booths that line the walls. The service depends - the very first time, our waitress was just okay. The second time, our waitress was attentive, refilling my iced green tea like, 3 times. (it's the best!)

Now, I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression when I describe the Golden Flower.  It's not the best or most authentic Chinese food you will ever eat.  You will not find an overly-friendly wait staff.  What you will find is a business that caters to the local lunch crowd, and they are damn good at it!

Lunch specials range in price from $6-$9. Specials include choice of soup, choice of rice, an egg roll and a cream-cheese rangoon.  Definitely try the pork fried rice. You will be pleased. I also recommend trying any shrimp dish.  The shrimp is always plump and flavorful. 

The staff does a good job of getting you in and out fast. Sometimes the entree will arrive before you finish your soup. But the staff is not trying to get rid of you. They just serve the food immediately as it leaves the kitchen, which is great if you need to get back to work, but give it a minute to cool before digging in.

Just to let you know, the Golden Flower has survived in the same location for 20 years while every other surrounding business has at one time or another had to close it's doors.  That's a testament to how good they are at what they do, and they have done it consistently for a very long time.

In a town with a tradition of imploding old casinos to make way for new ones, it's always nice to visit a local haunt that hasn't changed over the span of a generation. Don't ever change, Golden Flower. Don't you ever change.

FYI - There is a surcharge when paying with a bank card for totals under $10. Also, ask for the check when you're ready. They won't always bring it automatically.",IJL--65w5S4Pj-iSY3njJw,2,2,4,wF61c6QZ6TFUV501AADzVg

The egg rolls were filled with just cabbage and over cooked. Of what we ordered I would recommend the chicken fried rice. It was tasty and had plenty of chicken to go with the rice and cooked well. I give this place only two stars for the Chicken fried rice, prices and selection of food choices.Since we order take out, I plan on eating in next time.

My husband pointed at the egg rolls and asked what they were, and in the mean time I picked up one of the shrimp and was bringing it to my mouth. The waitress heard him and said ""oh I made a mistake put it down"" so I put the shrimp down and she picked up the plate a dropped it off at the booth next to ours! And acted like nothing was wrong with that! Needless to say the people at the tables across from us saw what happened and were completely disgusted too. If they do that in front of customers I can't imagine what they do in the kitchen. Also there is no air conditioning in this place so they have 2 fans going in the dining area which don't help much.

4655297,2014-10-15,6,TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ,"""After being on a cross country flight from Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas to meet up with my brother and a week on vacationing on the Strip, I was anxious to see a real locals restaurant. My brother drove me to a nice Chinese restaurant in a happening Von's shopping center called Golden Flower. "" In reality if Yelp was in existence ten years ago in the summer of 2014 this is how I would of started the review. Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant holds a place in my heart because it is one of if not the first locals Chinese restaurant that I visited in Las Vegas when I was living in Fort Lauderdale ten years ago. For at least ten years Golden Flower has been blooming in the very injured shopping center at the corner of Pecos and Russell Roads. Where this shopping centers Von's, Denny's, New York Bagel shop, Starbuck's, and so on rest in peace, the spirit of Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant is alive. 

  It was yesterday before I attended the Alcohol Awareness Training class that I wanted to take advantage of a nearby Chinese Restaurant luncheon special. After a near decade hiatus, I was returning to Golden Flower Chinese Restaurant. 

  Golden Flower is still the same cozy Chinese restaurant as I remember back when the Outcasts ""Hey ya"" was topping the charts. It brings back further memories of the cozy Chinese restaurants in Long Island, New York. The oldies from the 1980s and 1990s added to the relaxing environment. Listening to the acoustic version of ""Hotel California"" made each bite of the shrimp chow mein that much more enjoyable. 

  More than the cozy environment and music, the service left me with a better taste of the Golden Flower. From the time I stepped inside to when I paid, Christie was very welcoming. She invited me to sit at any table in the relatively small dining room that was sparsely populated by diners. She was on top of refills and would always say, ""Thank you."" Ultimately she never rushed me. I'd overhear a couple of customers thank Christie for the great service. 

  The luncheon specials are a good deal. They are in affect Monday to Saturday from 11 am to 3 pm. In similar style to the luncheon specials throughout the Las Vegas Valley the price is between $5.95 and $6.95. the reality is that when you add a glass of Coke, tip, and tax it comes out to the figure of $11. But the Coke could be unnecessary because I vividly recall the delicious hot tea here. Let me talk more about the lunch specials. They include either egg drop or hot and sour soup. But, if you love wonton soup like I do, it is $2.25 per person. There is more. The lunch special also includes an egg roll, crunchy noodles with duck sauce and spicy mustard and either BBQ pork fried rice or steamed rice. The lunch special features an entree. The choices include numerous styles of chow mein, pepper steak, curry chicken, and sweet and sour chicken (I posted a picture of the menu in this business listing). 

   I ordered the shrimp chow mein luncheon special. The crunchy noodles were decent. I am a fan of the wide noodles and not the skinny ones they serve here. Regardless they went good with the spicy mustard. Before I could get more acquainted with the noodles, Christie placed the hot and sour soup on the white tablecloth. The soup tasted hot and sour. The next visit I intend to pay the $2.25 for the wonton soup. The egg roll which reminded me of a spring roll was Panda Express allright. Now the portion of the shrimp chow mein with fried rice was enormous. The quality was magnificent. In a couple of my previous reviews on Las Vegas Chinese Restaurants I voice my opinion that the chow mein noodles are filler food. Golden Flower serves flavorful chow mein that hint of lo mein sprinkled with generous amounts of chunky juicy appetizing shrimp and sprinklers of onions. This is an example of both quantity and quality. The Best of Las Vegas has bestowed Golden Flower with The Best of Vegas awards in 2002, 2008, and 2012.

  In hindsight, I am cognizant of the fact that somethings stay the same. In the period of a decade Golden Flower is still the same local Chinese Restaurant serving remarkable Chinese food luncheon specials in a cozy environment. In the period of a decade I remain a fan of Golden Flower.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,12,4,5GgHycqTZ2dJpuNrfG9-lw

4687495,2016-03-04,1,TrN8HBHBL4-Tu7cXMDoopQ,"First impression: Meh. I switched jobs and have been looking for new places to try for lunch. Based on Yelp reviews from people who are usually spot on with their reviews I decided to give Golden Flower a try. 

Service: A+. Attentive, service with a smile, no complaints. 
Location: B: It's not in a part of town I usually go to so it's a lunch only place for me. 
Food: After eating Chinese food for over 3 decades now I like to think I know if something's good, or if it's not. My standard order when trying a new Chinese place is Kung Pao Chicken. It's a good dish for me to judge the quality of the food because I can see how much attention is paid to their food prep, if they are stingy or generous with the spices, and if the cooks in the kitchen are paying attention to what they're doing. 

The Kung Pao Chicken I had today for lunch was boring. It had some peppers tossed in, but it lacked flavor. It was definitely better than anything Panda could ever serve, but I've had a lot better Kung Pao Chicken at several other places around the valley than I did at Golden Flower. 

The lunch special included soup, a cream cheese wonton, and an egg roll. I barely ate 1/4 of the soup, but I was not a fan of it. Flavorless it what comes to mind when I think of it. The cream cheese wonton was smashed almost flat, and looked like it was an afterthought, tossed on the plate and then forgotten about. And the egg roll tasted like what you would find in the frozen food section at the grocery store. It was blah and just tasted off to me. 

For the price it's not bad, but I've had much, much better for the same price elsewhere. Will I go back? Yes, because I may have picked an off day for them and the second time could be better. But my first impression is truly meh....I arrived thinking Yelp was going to lead me to something special, but I left disappointed.",HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,0,0,3,7UvCALz-8vGpVRRGe-B2hg

My husband and I  started eating here at least 10 years ago, when I started working at the vons that was in the shopping center. The food has always been consistently good. The wait staff fast, friendly and efficient. Their potstickers are the best in town, crispy and flavorful. The soups are delicious. You really can't go wrong with anything you order, it's all fresh. Our favorite dishes? Bbq pork with peapods for me, and kungpao chicken for him, but we will switch it up every now and then, cashew chicken, general tso's chicken, string bean and chicken, etc. The portions are huge, the lunch special is the best; soup, Rangoon, egg roll, main dish and side for like $6. Ordering delivery is relatively easy too, food comes fast but sometimes its takes some work to get your address across lol. Only bummer is that they are closed on Sundays.

My favorite dishes are the hong kong style crispy noodles, and the honey walnut shrimp. My roommate usually orders their orange chicken, which seems boring, but golden flower's version is very good.

I just went today and ordered some simple takeout dishes.  They were extremely friendly, quick and even offered me a drink of ice water while I waited.  I didn't have to ask, they just made that little extra effort that you remember.  They also asked about the little things like which utensils, sauces, etc. I would need.  Unlike other places which would throw you the pre-made 4 plastic fork/spoon 1 sweet/2 soy sauce pouch combo.  

Great Asian food is impossible to find in Vegas...even good Asian food is extremely hard to find.  I will admit that after 20 years out here this place is about as good I have been able to find.  

Next time you have a craving do right by yourself and hit this place instead of the Panda...please.  

One point it that their lunch specials are quite good.  I don't know of any other place that offers little foil-wrapped chicken as part of a lunch special order.  Portions are generous.  In fact I had to take some home because I could not finish. 

And if you just want an order of fried rice...it's not the completely soy sauce brown fare that you would find at most places...instead their version is a bit lighter and better tasting in my opinion.  

One note: there is road construction along Russel so you may miss the entrance unless you keep an eye out for it.  They are right next to the UPS store.  I think due to the road construction they've kept their prices low to entice folks...not that I need the extra incentive.

Last night, though, they went from a solid 4 stars to 5 stars.  For $3 more you can turn any entree into a combo.

I grew up in Southern Cali so the place gave me subtle nostalgia such as the decorated serving plates and red color coordination used in Chinese restaurant decorum.
We were given two types of menu, the daily special lunch menu and the regular for ala carte along with a gentleman giving us a starter appetizer of small bowl of crispy restaurant style noodles and dual dipping sauce of red sweet and mustard spicy sauce. Since its my first visit, I always start small and ordered the most loved dishes first. I ordered the Walnut Shrimp and Chicken Chop Suey. 
It was 15 minutes and we were served our first entree of Chicken Chop suey and a bowl of rice in which the gentleman kindly served it on our plates. This is something very normal in Chinese traditional restaurants where the server will automatically put rice and/or other foods on to your plate before you dig in. 
The chicken entree was fresh off the wok because I tasted that fire wok hay from the tasty pieces of crunchy vegetables, very tender and succulent chicken. Mmmmm.  Lol now mind you, this isn't the type of white sauce chop suey, since some meats served in a veggie dish is commonly stir fried with a brown sauce instead.
When the walnut shrimp arrived, I had to be ready. Plump (fat sized) and lightly battered crisp shrimps with tail on on a bed of shredded cabbage and topped with a sauce of the famed mayo-honey creation; garnished with steamed broccolis, this was nice. The treasure of that entree was sprinkled with sweet/toasted walnuts! When I bit into the shrimp and walnut, the tasty morsels melted in my mouth and it was divine. The strong sweetness of the candied walnut blended very well with the tartness of the sauce. It was heaven. Omg. Lol
Anyways, my mother and I finished our lunch satisfied and gulped down a glass of icy water with a wedge of lemon. It was a wonderful lunch that wasn't heavy or ladled with salt. 
We thanked our hostess and left smiling to go on about our day! I would definitely return to try more of their signature dishes soon!",TyeU40zAsjgRR7wIjvzsFg,0,0,5,6X2bww_eJgpgFYK3cvCAiA

We always take leftovers because they are generous in portion size!

The staff is always very friendly and on point with drink refills.

I drive across town to eat here, it is totally worth it and I crave it when hankering for excellent chinese food!

The ""Famous"" Las Vegas movie and show stars even come and eat here it is so good, a hidden gem in Las Vegas for many years!

You MUST check it out if you like really good mandarin/cantonese style chinese food! They deliver also but I prefer to dine in and enjoy the experience!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,5,5,5,l7QTL1RY2157LsicaO3gQw

The only negative thing I could say is that I dont eat pork so i just wanted to subsitute the beef for pork and they charged me an addtionall $2.00, which isnt much but was kind of irritating.",ff2Ehn5qK5CXFxlixoY3zQ,0,0,4,zBvVhdxqiOhXXZN7MEZlJw
