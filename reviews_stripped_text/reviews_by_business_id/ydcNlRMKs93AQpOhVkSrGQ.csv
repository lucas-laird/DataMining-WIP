Went here on a cold night after partying, so greasy food just sounded like a dream come true. It wasn't busy at all that's because it was 4 in the morning. They were located on Valley View and Sahara, guess no more China town area. 

I ordered the spicy burger since I didn't really like the mushroom burger. It was way better, the meat was cooked until I reached the middle (it was totally red like it wasn't cooked) but could be my fault since I should ask for well done, I totally stopped eating it since bloody meat makes me sick.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,3,2,3,oYt3ajlHQdpMrof4y1c2kQ
74726,2011-06-25,0,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"I was fortunate to stumble across this truck in the parking lot of Frank's Tiki Room after having a couple of drinks. I had yet to join the Food Truck craze here in Vegas so this was my break in experience. We were greeted by a nice friendly young women who was kind enough to take the time to go over their popular dishes. I ordered the No 3: Buta-Burger ""Pig Burger"" with no sides. I just wanted a quick light late night meal. This burger has miso glazed applewood smoked bacon, double American cheese, onions, pickled ginger and Japanese BBQ sauce. The bacon was nice and thick with great flavor which went well with this combination of ingredients. I found the whole experience to be great. I will definitely be on the look out for their truck in the future.
Highly Recommend grabbing a quick lunch or late night snack when you see this truck in a parking lot somewhere.",xOjtlIjWS0djtoYhjBDgxA,2,0,5,CT5mqP1u_c8uNlSaxJrn8g

124275,2011-10-01,0,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"The Vegas 'street meat' scene has really taken off as of late, I've heard plenty buzz around the Fukuburger truck, Slidin' Thru... but how good can a burger be that is made in a dirty-ish, probably re-commissioned vehicle? In this case, actually not too bad.

To start off I must be fair, the Vegas truck scene isn't just about burgers, there are grilled cheese trucks, buns, and even clothing. Of course my main thing is burgers, so that's pretty much all I care about at this point. This whole food truck scene is a bit pretentious for me, I don't appreciate having to get to one of their locations early, only to stand in line and fight to hopefully get a burger before they sell out. If I have to work too hard for my burger, then you're never going to get me to eat one. Oh and let's not forget that almost every food truck scene I've been around in Vegas has been attended primarily by our entire high school population. I tried one time to actually be at Fuku's scheduled locations, and by the time I got there they were sold out as predicted. This is the reason it's been almost a year since that time, and the only reason I ate one last week is because I happened to be on Fremont St right where they were. And good luck trying to find where they will be, if you can navigate their fairly awful, Myspace-like website, their schedule isn't always up to date so finding where they will be tonight may not always be possible unless you are also following them on Twitter or some other social media site.

As for the d√©cor, in this case we can only really mention the truck itself as they don't have a fixed location at this point. The truck is fairly clean looking, aside from the loads of stickers, and slight grime on the shelves which you can maybe see in the background of the burger closeups. There is a hot girl taking your orders in the midst of slight madness. There seems to be some planned method for order placement and pickup, but the drunks on Fremont don't quite allow this to flow smoothly, neither do the homeless that are assaulting you for an add to your order for them. Also, the megaphone that's used to call out your name could probably stand for a replacement as whatever they are saying is hardly intelligible, and a decorative ring around the front edge fell off while I was there. Still, this is all part of the overall feel of getting food off of a food truck, so the overall mystique and character are quite fun. Plus I happened to catch this on Fremont st, which is my favorite place in Vegas.

The burger itself was surprisingly good. Although it looked nothing like the picture on the menu, it had great flavor and was quite fresh. The meat didn't have amazing flavor on its own, but wasn't bad by any means and still better than some sit down restaurants I've been to lately. The bun was grilled as well, had decent flavor, and was proportioned well, all considering it's of the more 'typical' variety. The lettuce was, well, lettuce. The Fuku sauce was lacking a little flavor, but maybe there just wasn't enough. The bacon was pretty tasty, although maybe a bit soggy on mine. The American cheese was ok, but most importantly melted, which is something that many restaurants can't seem to do somehow. Overall this is a good burger, similar to a Bachi burger in its Asian theme, although this doesn't quite come close to that freshness and overall tastiness.

The fries are nothing to write home about, I think I got them garlic seasoned or something, but they just seemed to be out of a frozen packet sprinkled with some garlic seasoning. I don't know if I would expect them to have a full setup to make amazing fries on this truck though, for their focus and main attention should be the burgers. I'll leave that up to the fry truck whenever someone unveils it.

Overall, this burger is good, and you could do a lot worse in town. The scene isn't for everyone though, many people would prefer to sit down in a clean restaurant and get their food without having to fight for it. But if you're into the 'cultural' scene of Vegas, enjoy eating your meat on a sidewalk surrounded by drunken hipsters in 100 degree weather, then definitely get your Fuku on. Just make sure you get there early or you'll be let down.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,1,3,nouq7pGsWjyPii668PRJ3Q

134594,2011-06-03,0,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"Fukuburger, you better get there early or you find yourself waiting in line. I had a number 4 which was a medium cooked juicy patty that was between a well toasted bun, topped with grilled mushrooms to perfection & drizzled with a special sweet mayo sauce that had a hint of spiciness that just makes your mouth water for more. 

That's just the burger, you can't forget about the fries & and the special homemade lemonade. Fries are deep fried to a golden brown, well cut fries that has a crisp when you bight into it & a soft inside where you can actually taste the potato. They serve it 3 different ways. An original batch where it is lightly salted, served on the side with their mayo sauce & ketchup. Garlic fries which to be honest was prepared with garlic salt not with real garlic, not something I was too fond of. And Jazz fries which is something to try, if you do not like mayo then this is not for you. 2 differnt unique sauces that is drizzled on top. A sweet mayo that makes you forget about ketchup & another sauce that is too hard to describe, you just have to try it for yourself. 

Homemade Lemonade that will make your face pucker for some more. A sweet & tangy drink that is like no other. Watch out this is no quench relief, but it is something that you will enjoy.",Vl9lgnsUa9cbVdzL0CWK5w,0,0,4,ZuWDSTcGYkG25HUN1POMfA

I showed up right at 8.pm in China town where they were supposed to be set up. Truck pulled up right on time and I quickly got my order in.  It was windy and cold so I grabbed by Tomago burger and ate in the truck. I don't know what they put on that burger but its one of the best burgers I have ever had the pleasure of eating. It was juicy and flavorful. Now here is the deal with the seasonings and condiments they use, ever thing they use blends together to form one unique flavor. I don't enjoy a burger where one bite tastes like mustard, the next bite is full of mayo ect ect ect. So after my initial encounter with the truck I though maybe I was just extra hungry that day so I would go back and try it again. Well on the next 3 visits my opinion would not change.

The menu isn't extensive (I think there's six burgers on the menu?) but the burgers are good and have some fun asian fusion flavoring.

We tried out the truck a month or so ago, i.e., the middle of January. I imagine that as it starts to get warmer, it'll be nicer to hang outside, talk and eat.

734049,2011-10-10,0,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"Disclaimer: I'm rating this establishment as a food truck.  Of course it can't compare to certain establishments that offer a dine in experience, but the food is excellent for the price (You can get a very satisfying meal for less than 10 bucks), so I'm rating it as such.

So I've been a patron of this place for a year or so, since I've discovered its existence.  I've brought many people here and all of the people have raved about it.  

Since I've tried every burger on its ""regular"" menu, I figured this is a good time to review.  Sadly, I'm trying to recall memories from months ago for certain burgers and foods, so I can't completely describe the euphoria in detail, but I'll do my best.  At the very most, take my following words as suggestions.

Lucky Burger:  This is their standard burger.  It combines the taste of the fuku-patty with the flavors that remind me of In-n-out. Don't get me wrong, it's not a copy-cat burger.  The fuku-patty is what makes all the difference.  It's a marinated marvel that is tender and melts in your mouth, and it's standard in all of their beef burgers.

Tamago Burger: This is an interesting burger.  It combines the classic fuku-patty with crispy onion strings, egg, and terriyaki sauce.  This probably one of the messier burgers, since the egg is not completely cooked through (sunny side up).  It's still a good burger, but I tend to avoid it because it's incredibly messy.  This is definitely one of their heavier burgers.

Buta Burger: This burger is for the bacon-heads.  The pickled ginger adds a special kick that isn't overpowering, but blends nicely with the miso bacon and fuku-patty.  Admittedly, it's hard to taste the miso on the bacon, so don't expect too much out of it.  But it's bacon, it makes everything better.

Kinoko Burger: Otherwise known as the mushroom burger, it is a slightly lighter burger.  Mushrooms are good, if you like mushrooms.  I happen to like a mushrooms, so if I'm feeling slightly guilty about going, I pick this burger.  

Karai Burger:  So, admittedly, I'm a little desensitized to extremely spicy foods, so this is actually a medium spicy burger to me.  This is also a lighter burger, so if I want a little spicy kick, I'll pick this burger. 

Chicken Katsu: It uses fried chicken!  It's amazing.  It uses a panako crust as the breading, which is a type of breading that is lighter than traditional breading but fries crisp and delicious.  The combination of the sauce and the shredded lettuce gives the impression that you've got a bento box in between the buns.  

Fries: there's the classic garlic fries, and the jazz fries.  The garlic fries are amazing in their own right due, and you can dip them in the included cup of crack sauce for an amazing synergy.  If you like eating fries with the fork, there's the jazz fries.  They're basically the same garlic fries with brown gravy and the crack sauce dumped on top.  I'm pretty much sold on the jazz fries.

There is also a burger that's off-menu that I haven't ordered in a while, but supposedly was mentioned in an earlier yelp review that I tried.  it's the ""Fat Hakujin"".  It's a two patty monstrosity that combines cheese, egg, and bacon and some other stuff that will probably contribute to a ride to the nearest ER one day.  If you're brave, have great family genetics, or are REALLY hungry, try it.  It's still delicious.

Strawberry Lemonade is fresh and it's good!  I always order one when I come.  Apparently it's made fresh daily and mixed in this huge igloo cooler.  Unfortunately, no refills with purchase.

So food's great, how's service?  It's pretty good for a food truck (obviously my expectations aren't high), but the people are courteous when I'm there.  Of course, order to mouth times vary depending on how busy they are.  But if they're not busy, generally it's about 5-6 minutes tops.  But the sky is the limit if they're busy.  

Probably fair warning is that there is extremely limited seating.  Seats are either a portable bench table, or a bunch of Home Depot buckets.  I tend to see tailgate parties if someone drives their pick up truck over or SUV/station wagon.

This food does not do terribly well when you take it home.  The flavor is still all there and good, but the textures start to fail, especially when the meat juices completely soak into the bun and the fries get soggy when wrapped in tin-foil.  It's best when you eat it within a few minutes of receiving from the truck window. Just fair warning.

Probably my only gripe is their typical business hours is 8pm 'til late.  I generally like to have my dinner eaten and finished before 7, so it becomes fairly difficult to justify a 16-20 minute drive from my place to wherever they happen to be.  But if I have visitors, or I just happen to be in the area (or if they're doing some daytime event somewhere) I'll stop on by.  As far as keeping a schedule and tracking them down, they're a lot easier than some other trucks that service the Valley.",zAqfO6-rw1Bjsxu1zmXspQ,3,1,5,ZvQP_dYGIznkVMFZxP07-w

Not really, but i'm sure a few people will fall for it.I had the weekend off from work and decided right away that Fukuburger was to be on the top of the list of things I wanted to do.Fukuburger and 2 other trucks had made camp in Chinatown @ Spring Mountain and Wynn.the Fukus set up buckets for people to sit on and eat.I'm a little too awesome to sit on a bucket, so I went ate in the car.

I ordered up the Fukuburger, Togarashi Garlic Fries and a Sunkist.Order was up pretty quick and I retreated to the car to commence the ritual.Turned on the air-conditioning, blasted some Amon Amarth and took a bite....holy fuku!The flavor assaults your tastebuds right away and brings you to orgasm.The fries were amazing, probably the best I've ever had.The burger is probably the 2nd best I've ever had.This is definitely a truck that I will be stalking in the future.

vegas, why have you been chosen to be blessed with this truck of tastiness?  Jealousy enrages my stomach, churning, twisting, contorting in an angry flurry of rage.

i do not exaggerate.  fukuburger is just that.  a tornado of taste and texture to titillate and torture your tongue.  Yes, read it again...""titillate"".

i am humbly honored to have taken the photo currently the default on the FB page.  Yes, recently I took notice that the insides of the burgers are rare.  but it doesn't bother me...it's too dark to notice anyways. :)

what DOES bother me, is that feeling of withdrawal when I awaken from my slumber...to a day yearning for night.  a night where we will line up to the loud musings and trendy asians of the midnight hour.  To feast upon buckets and tip for jelly straws.

I fell in love with the allure of Las Vegas food trucks about six months ago and due to the limited time that I had, I wasn't afforded the opportunity eat at Fukuburger.  That all changed Saturday night and sadly, it didn't live up to the hype surrounding it in my opinion.  The burger was good, don't get me wrong, it just wasn't the out of body experience that everyone made it out to be.

I completely loved the atmosphere of the place.  I was able to make it to ""Saturday Night Food Fest"" or whatever its called in front of Johnny Rocker's and was very impressed with the layout and the overall ambiance.  It was close to 2 in the morning and people were talking, laughing and just having a great time overall.  There were five food trucks in the parking lot and I had decided to try Fukuburger based on the fanfare it received from all of their patrons.  

Again, this burger was good, I don't want to detract from the quality because I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It just wasn't otherworldly as many others proclaimed it to be.  I ordered the #3 and was pleased with the pricing and the speed in which I received my food.  The #3 is their Buta or ""Pig"" Burger and it included Applewood Smoked Bacon, American Cheese, Onion, Pickled Ginger and their version of a Japanese BBQ Sauce.  I found the burger to be small and overly messy.  It tasted fine, but I really couldn't taste the flavor of the meat itself because it was slathered with a ton of sauce, which often times hides the quality of the meat.

I will most certainly give Fukuburger another chance when I return to Vegas in a couple of months, but for now, it's pretty good, nothing more, nothing less.",acIm1t76GjS63KxT0c2G2g,2,0,3,Y1Fg5CHoggSpvH5NIgGnNA

Everybody was raving about Fukuburger and when I saw their truck I had to try it. We ordered and then waited over 40 minutes to get our burgers. I would say, well its a food festival and its busy.. but it was 3PM on Sunday and there were a total of 5 orders ahead of ours. It took 40 minutes for them to serve 6 total customers.

So after the wait, we get our burgers. For the price of $7 a piece, I was disappointed straightaway. The burgers are very very small. The bun is the kind you buy in a pack of 8 for $2 at the grocery and I will be generous and say it was 1/4 pound of meat... but I doubt it was that much. Now I will say the flavor of my egg burger was good... but both my and my girlfriends spicy burger were both cold. Like cold bun, cold meat, cold toppings... everything was cold. It took 40 minutes to prepare a cold burger. Ordinarily, I would have just taken it back. But in that 40 minute wait time, their line was now really big and I didn't want to stand in line 10 more minutes to wait 40 minutes on another burger.

I was really disappointed and it makes me sad. I really love supporting my local Las Vegas businesses.. but I won't be back to Fukuburger.",T18ONQv62KWYceY7BE0xtQ,1,0,2,G7Zp5PsDsVbKcxZrU1uWDw

So if you read Emily R.'s reviews (she's Elite. I figured I would remind you before she did) she's a big fan of Fukuburger, and it was due time I got dragged along. Now, I'm not as big of a fan of Asian food as she is (I think PF Chang's is high dining) so I was a bit concerned. She recommended the Tamago, which is a burger with fried egg on top, and some kind of sauce. I think it's two sauces, actually: Teriyaki and something else. It's got bacon, and you can get it with cheese (I didn't).

Sounds good? Hai. (That's Japanese for yes. I'm bilateral.)

My only complaint about the burger is that the egg yolk was runny, and I like firmer eggs. (IN YOUR PANTS!! j/k) So next time I'll have to order it well-done. But other than that, this burger kicks more ass than Sailor Moon.

Fukuburger is like Run DMC meets Aerosmith, or The Black Keys w/ Big Boi if your up on things.  Combining Asian flavors with American fast food flare at a high quality level is all it takes to win the hearts of hungry Las Vegasians.  

I went with the following:

Naga Dog - 

A smokey delicious explosion of flavor.  The hotdog had the perfect sear on it, maintaining that awesome snap one would expect from a well-done dog.  It was topped with daikon radish, their habanero kabayakisauce (smoky and spicy), and a little spicy mayo.  The bun held up well to the heavy ingredients resting between it.  My favorite item, so far.


FukuFries - 

Salty, fast food fries.  I liked these, but could see where some people might not like the amount of salt.  Really though, if you're complaining about salt from a fast food meal, you might as well just keep enjoying your piece of lettuce and stop whining, its not for you.

Karai (spicy burger) - 

Cooked perfectly medium, the burger was not too big, and packed a nice punch.  It wasn't as spicy as I hoped, but people out there might disagree with me.  The burger was topped with sliced cucumber, avocado, spicy mayo, and habanero kabayaki sauce.

My LV buddy was in my neck of the woods [Chicago] a few weeks back and I showed him around to the Chi's best burger. In return, he said he'd do the same when I was in Sin City. My guy delivered like whoa.

We caught the Fukuburger Truck at Vegas StrEATS [which as a truck meet was amazing, and puts Chicago's truck summit to shame]. But as alluring and tempting as the other trucks were, I was there on a mission: to get Fuku'd.

The truck itself is a street artists canvas: it's loud and out there with stickers, pictures, and colors galore. They take orders outside of the truck. The gal was standing on top of a stool to relay orders the the buger-magicians inside. You can vaguely see the magic happen through the stickered windows.

I ordered the #2 [Tamago/egg burger], #3 [buta-burger/pig burger], and some fries with a very delish dipping sauce.

The Tamago was UHHH-MAYYYYYY-ZING!! Most egg burgers that I've had were completely fried, not runny eggs. This bad boy was runnier than a sick kid's nose, not that I'm complaining or anything. To top it off, the Tamago is smothered in a teriyaki sauce that takes this burger up another notch.

And ya know I had to order the one named ""buta-burger"" just cuz it's name. It's got everything that I like: burger, bacon, cheese, bbq sauce. drooL. One of the best things about these burgers is the bun. It is sweet, kinda like a Hawaiian roll.

Service is legit; they're friendly and funny, and they'll call you by name when your order is ready. Oh, and what kind of food truck accepts credit cards?? Fuku does. Fuku does. But you may not even need the plastic with a $5 price tag.",Hz2tMrD3vpv7AGrHX81ubA,5,1,5,V88a_iGozd4BrHHmi5MbRQ

The Jazz Fries are smothered in some kind of gravy with their ""crack sauce"".  So freaking good, I can't even tell you.

The atmosphere was fun, energetic.  One of the owners was yelling out orders, taunting the customers, all in good fun and humor. 

Only negative (more of me not knowing what I was getting myself into, than the fault of Fukuburger) is that the owner often shouts out profanities, and has some raunchy exchanges with the customers.  I'm not uptight about this normally, and I found it to be hilarious...just more of a warning if you bring your kids.

I go walking up with my 3 year old (who likes to repeat everything) and my wife (granted it is about 9pm, so kids would normally be in bed had we not been on vacation, right?)  And there were tons of hilarious exchanges between the guys in the truck and the customers.  Hey Its my fault for bringing my kid into that situation I guess, and not ripping fukuburger for this. If I was alone or out with just the wife, again, I'd have no issues at all.  

So I guess consider this more of a warning if you have small kids and you don't want them repeating things like ""fu*k and sh*t"" on the drive home, lol.  

As far as how this relates to the food?  It doesn't.  The food itself was fantastic and the next time I'm in vegas, I'll be hunting them down again and will either leave the kid at the hotel, or will come armed with some ear plugs.  Ha.

1228962,2011-07-01,0,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"Okay, so I finally tried this thing. 

The burger was quite tasty. I had the #3. Can't remember the exact name, but it's basically their ~sweet burger and they pull it off. I've had ~sweet burgers from other places before that were full of fail as they either made me feel like I should have just went on ahead and have an ice cream sandwich or they weren't sweet at all. This one had the perfect ratio of sweetness and burger flavor. 

One gripe I have is that they place mayo on everything. As you all know, I'm a mayonnaise hating machine, and the #3 comes with wasabi mayo (OMG GROSS) but the menu doesn't say so. Yeah, they should really put that on the menu so fellow mayo haters like me will know to tell them to hold it on that particular item. However, when I told them my burger had mayo and I didn't want it they quickly took it back and replaced it with no problem, so I'll let it slide. 

The prices are unfortunately rather steep as a burger, fries and a drink will be almost $10, but it's a pretty damn good burger and something that's worth a try at least once due to the out of the ordinary concept, so I think that the $5 price tag for the burger is worth it.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,1,0,4,kIYkpv41PEvMVdVHxZ5xxg

1422449,2010-11-06,1,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"So prior to this review, I've already been to fukuburger quite a few times, but I just wanted to experience it in all of the different places it goes to before I wrote what I would call a good review.

This place definitely has my stamp of approval. It's a cool looking truck with some east asian urban graphic design on the sides of it, something you definitely wouldn't miss if you were looking for it on the side of the road. The atmosphere of the places that it goes to is really down to earth. Mostly a bunch of youngsters hanging around showing off their tuned out cars while you grab a bite to eat. Not very many places to sit but when you're coming to eat at a truck I don't think you'd be expecting an abundance of chairs and tables just lined up for your convenience, so it's understandable. The staff is friendly and I think one of the most memorable things while you're just sitting around waiting is that when somebody tips, the person taking the order yells out ""TIP JELLY"" and so does everyone else on the truck and participating customers as well. The wait varies depending upon the time you arrive at the location they're at, but I've been there about 5-6 times and the wait has never taken more than 20 minutes even during their busiest moments.

The menu is small. 6 Main burgers all unique in their own way, but from what I understand you can customize your burger with extra patties and eggs if you'd like. There's a few other items on the menu but I haven't gotten around to trying them yet so I'll just stick to the burgers.

For the most part, it is REALLY delicious, especially for it's price. 5 dollars a burger is really decent for what your getting. It's not an overwhelmingly huge burger but remember, quality before quantity. These burgers are just damn good. I ordered the Tamago burger and I don't really remember the other stuff that's on it besides the egg but I do remember how it tastes and boy was it delicious. Their garlic fries are awesome too, especially mixed with the sauce that comes with it.

This is one of those places you go to when you and your group of friends are hungry and you want something good and quick to grab but you don't want to have to fork out a wad of cash. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my visits to Fukuburger and I have no doubt that you will too.",-u_PHSe7PYi4RnarqtVLGw,1,1,4,ZwxotjdcAvmZGzgoHix4pg

I ordered #2 Tamago burger and my girlfriend order #4 Kinoko burger.  They were both delicious.  Their beef patties are cooked perfectly (medium well-ish) and so tasty.  I don't think I can eat any other burgers now that I have tasted theirs.  

The size of their burgers is rather Japanese....small.  I could eat 2 of them.  It is $5 each but well spent.  The people are friendly and tell you to come up with a unique nickname for your order.   I truly hope they will make it to the east coast one day.

1514174,2011-01-21,1,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"No Joke.  I've always wondered what Vegas culture would be.  I've been in may towns where culture meets you at the airport,  and deepens as you explore away from where you've landed. In vegas... not so much.  So when you live here you always complain about the lack of culture.  Fukuburger is culture and more importantly it's Vegas Culture.  There's nothing here that says ""let's make money"" or ""let exploit the tourists"".  The sliders they serve are beyond expectations.  The meat is cooked to perfection... in otherwords... it's medium rare.  Juicy, what you would imagine a sushi chef making if he was making the best burger you've ever had.  Sliders are very Asian, I had the #2 Tamayo with an egg on top.  I can't get the flavors out of my mouth.  I'm not gonna lie... I wasn't paying attention when I took my first bite, seconds later I forgot what I was saying, the flavors and texture were amazing.

OK so it's good... better, it's great food.  No doubt.  The service, personable, cool, you want to be friends with the guy taking you're order because he seems to be so cool but not pretentious... again not a quality found on the strip.  And then you realize that you're not anywhere you'd normally find yourself.  Since Fukuburger is a truck, it's constantly on the move.  This evening we had the pleasure of dining outside one of this towns many live adult entertainment establishments (yes I'm having burgers outside of a stripclub) and it was perfect.  I really didn't even know how to get to Industrial Blvd, but somehow I followed the neon signs reading ""live nude girls"" and found my way.

That's what made me realize that Vegas Culture is here and it's at Fukuburger.  It was everything that's right with Vegas.  The food is amazing and the location... well at least for tonight, couldn't be any more fitting.  

I spoke with one of the co-owners and it made me think of this quote by one of americas greatest philosophers.

I got the Tamago burger, the Chicken Katsu burger, and some garlic fries to share with my husband.

OK, so the fries are really nothing special. The garlic flavor is very faint, especially since the burgers are so flavorful, so they're really just there to give you something to munch on and dip in sauce. But I didn't really go for the fries, and the burgers did not disappoint!

The Tamago burger is wonderfully soft, and the flavors are sweet and savory and you're probably going to be craving them later. It's messy but the runny egg yolk is half the fun--just be careful not to yolk yourself!

The Chicken Katsu burger ended up being our favorite though, by far! It's a huge piece of delicious chicken katsu with a wonderful crunchy crust, on a bun with cabbage and katsu sauce. The menu says it has wasabi mayo on it too, but I didn't actually notice it. It is SO GOOD! I just wanted to keep eating that thing, unfortunately I had to give half of it to my husband. Half a Tamago burger was a good consolation prize, but we both agreed that the Katsu burger is where it's at.

I am pretty spoiled by dining in nice restaurants with beautiful ambiance, unobtrusive service that anticipates every need, and extremely high levels of comfort. Fukuburger is definitely not these things, which means it is pretty amazing to make me enjoy it so much! 

That said, this is definitely the best food truck experience I've had. 

They've got a simple but excellent menu that is Asian/Hawaiian influenced, with several burgers to choose from, a few sides, and awesome specials that keep each visit fresh by giving you something new to enjoy. My ""go-to"" is the Buta Burger, which has bacon, cheese, and a little bit of ginger on the burger. The burgers are hearty - just the perfect size for a full meal. At West-side Wednesdays, they have ""Asian Chicken and Wafu"" which is their version of fried chicken and waffles and is absolutely delicious - teriyaki chicken skewers and fried dough with cinnamon, sugar, and maple syrup. 

They also have delicious Strawberry Lemonade that I definitely recommend, particularly during the summer months when you need something particularly refreshing. 

Their system is efficient and remarkably fast considering the size of the line. They have a server at the truck taking orders as you reach the front of the line - she's always really quick but also very friendly, willing to explain the menu and make recommendations if it's your first time there. Sometimes they'll give you an idea of how long it'll take for your order to come out, sometimes not. You hang out and wait for them to call your hame for your order when it is ready at the window. 

There's no place to sit... well, I take that back - they usually have some overturned Home Depot buckets and perhaps a folding table, but considering the crowd that is usually there I wouldn't count on these :) We usually tailgate in our SUV instead. 

Follow Fukuburger on twitter to keep in touch with where they'll be, what the specials are (including pictures, which help to entice you to go find them, right this very moment so that you can order that special) etc.

Overall, it is so much fun and WAY better than anything casual you can find on the strip itself. Oh! Also the prices are amazingly approachable, which is absolutely a great reason to check it out.",ZYdPYCi5UP75TrcGZV1FjA,3,1,5,KzsFgmez3tSMTUtvoszTMw

They take credit cards. If you want all the morbid details, read the 200+ other reviews, but take it from me...this is a fantastic spot to get your food on.

A few words of warning: Go Hungry! You will be STUFFED afterwards. Also, make sure you have a gym membership before you go. You'll need it afterwards. Also, try the Strawberry Lemonade.

It was almost midnight and the factors of ""discovering"" the food truck and having the late night munchies made this delicious points go up.

1.  Tamago burger (burger patty, egg over easy, onion strings, teriyaki sauce and furikake) - The yolky egg easily won me over, but the crunch of the onion strings and furikake cemented its win.  It wasn't the tastiest patty ever but definitely texturegasmic.
2.  Fuku Moco - this was basically a mini loco moco bowl with an added bonus of bonito flakes and extra oozy yolky egg.  Another texture win!

Some customer guy there recommended it and referred to it as the Hakujin but the guys that worked there called it the ""fat whiteboy"". It was so damn good.

Out of the corner of my eye I spotted a jackpot, like 6 food trucks in a row! It turned out to be the 1st Friday Art event in downtown Vegas, but we didn't care, we just wanted some good grub. I wanted something Asian (I'm always up for Thai) and my husband was up for anything but, so I knew our chances of finding something we both liked were good here.

We walked by all the food trucks and then as we were checking out the roller derby mini arena this Fukuburger truck pulls up and a line formed instantly! We decided this was the truck for us too. The burgers were $6 each and the patties were super thick and juicy. Overall it was a great burger. I got the #1 (Lucky) and my husband got the #3 the Buta-burger. We usually share fries and were a little disappointed when we first saw how tiny our order of garlic fries was, but that burger was filling enough that we didn't feel as cheated in the end. We both loved our burgers and that awesome garlic sauce.
 
There weren't many seats available so we sat on some buckets that I think the truck brought with them. That may have been a first for me.

Also, the people running the truck seem way cool. We'll definitely hit the Fukuburger truck again when we're in Vegas and hopefully try all of the other burgers.",PJJnUO46NYJ1dldLM9o7pQ,5,2,4,lDw8Cgw7WALhY8b1a3XSaQ

Most importantly, the portions were big.  But as months passed by, we try this place again and everything seemed so skimpy.  Even the containers for the sauces got smaller. =\

Don't get me wrong I still like Fuku Burger, the co-owners are cool as hell and the flavor and culture is definitely there.  But the servings MUST be bigger, the fries are ridiculously small for what you pay for.  I wish they would serve portions like when they first started.

Before the recent food truck movement, people rarely perceived these 'kitchens on wheels' as outlets they wanted to eat at. Today, the public's mindset has done a complete 180 and FT's like Fukuburger are now experiencing large, almost cult-like, fan followings. The reason why Fuku has gained such notoriety and acclaim can be attributed, in large part, to the unique menu items that they offer and their ability to successfully execute their food on a consistent basis.  I've eaten at Fukuburger numerous times and have had the pleasure to experience each of their Asian/pacific-island inspired burgers. My favorite burgers are the 'Kinoko' - mushroom burger - and the 'Fuku-Burger' - lucky burger. Though, the item I order the most is the Nagadog; no visit to Fuku is complete without it. I love the crisp snap of the hot-link sausage; the creaminess of the wasabi mayo; and the crunch and texture of the kimchi - there's no better hot dog on the planet. Other items they offer include the 'Loco Moco' and 'Naga Moco'. The Loco and Naga are almost entirely the same dish and only distinguished by their main source of protein; Loco - Hamburger patty and Naga - hot-link sausage. Both of them come with rice, one fried egg and gravy; a great meal to have for when it's cold outside.",Y0gT_0LMBliwJbWseWN1hw,0,0,4,LvgJ0pDK5lEPkEtG7rjuag

And I added a side of Jazz Fries - only to be informed that they were out of gravy and could substitute teriyaki. But that sounded like an ok substitution, so I went for it too.

I totally loved the experience. From the folks in the truck serving up the eats, to the drunken fools waiting patiently for their good eats, to the tip jelly... It's just an all-around good time in the BoA Chinatown parking lot.

Instead of standing around and eating my dog and fries, I opted to just take them to go and drive home to eat (which isn't exactly close). To my pleasant surprise, the food was still piping hot when I got home. And OMG it was delicious! I have never experienced a hot dog like that before.

My sister has been raving about Fukuburger for months now and swearing to drag me to it whenever I was back in Vegas. Needless to say, I had my first taste this weekend and I am definitely a fan. 

When you walk up, there's music blazing. The staff that took our order were standing on buckets- three girls all taking one order, but being very ""asian"" in the perky, happy, kind of way. When my sister and I tipped, they screamed, ""tip jelly"" and offered a bucket of jelly candies from which you could pick one. It's a little scary on a drunken night with no forewarning, but lively, nonetheless. It must keep folks entertained when the crowds swarm. Luckily for us, we either just missed a crowd or just beat one because we didn't wait for long. 

They have 6 offerings, 5 burgers and 1 chicken katsu, as well as specials, one of which was the naga-dog. I ordered the karai (spicy burger). My boyfriend ordered the buta (pig burger). My sister went for the naga dog. (We had two others with us, but I was drunk and didn't bother asking them what they got.)

We all ordered fries with our food and took our bags of foil-wrapped goodies back to my sister's place to chow down on the living room floor. 
I'll be honest, the use of pickled ginger worried me but it's a well-planned, inspiring addition to the list of burger condiments. All of the food was delicious- traditional enough to still be a straight up good burger, but inspired enough with fusion flavorings to be noticed and appreciate. In fact, it was so good, we were all pissed off that we inhaled everything so quickly. 

Prices are reasonable, $5 per burger. I think I could go for them being a bit bigger... or I could just not be dumb and order more than one? The fries portion, however, could definitely be bumped up.

Colin was telling me and my friends about their most recent creation, the Naga Dog, but he shushed us after telling us what was in it (fresh italian sausage, grilled kim chee, spicy mayonnaise, little nori pieces (seaweed), in a bun) and Colin also explained that they get their meat fresh only HOURS before they open for business which makes their burgers extra fresh and tender, never frozen!

I chose the Kinoko (mushroom) burger first, garlic fries, macaroni salad, and a thai iced tea. ""Oh... Myyyy... Gosh!"" (c) Usher Raymond. The burger was so freaking good, I needed to have another one! The spicy mayonnaise has to be my favorite sauce at the moment.

I'm a huge foodie. Everyone that knows me knows this, but I hate getting ready to go out to eat at a restaurant, which is why I love this truck. I discovered them before everyone finally realized how amazing the food is! I literally came 3 times a week. I'd get off at 3am and stop by before I drove home. 
The vibes that the owners exude is like no other you'd find in the service industry. They are friendly and welcoming and so excited ALL THE TIME. This is extremely important especially when you are a food truck that operates based on the success of your fan base. Vegas locals love to come out to where ever they happen to be, just to be around them. 
But enough about them and how contagious they are. What's most important is the food of course. They have a pretty good menu. There's quite a few options for those who aren't used to the idea that burgers don't always have to be complimented by pickles and mustard. 
My personal favorite is the Naga Dog. It always succeeds to satiate my cravings.

On a positive note, the miso glazey Butaburger with an over easy fried egg (which I requested since it's usually fried over medium) AKA The Hakujin is a perfect combination that works really well.  If your eating this standing up, get in the patented Philly hunch or you could get Fuk'd.  Your stain free fresh kicks and designer jeans will thank ya later!

When visiting this truck, keep in mind that their following is pretty young and you have to be in the mood to deal with it (see Elizabeth E.'s review - jackass teenagers pretty much sums it up).

It seems there's a lot of repeat customers or fans that hang around the truck, as there were people parked and hanging out by or in their cars for the entire duration we were there. 

There was no sense of organization in the line, just a clusterf**k of people mobbing around the lone girl taking orders. We had several people attempt to get in front of us and others asking us where the line ended. Some people stood on the periphery of the cluster and waited for 10+ minutes in the cold in skimpy costumes before getting frustrated and leaving without anything.

The music was also so loud that it made ordering a challenge unless you got in the poor girl's face or yelled at her. She took our name and put our order in. When done a guy would scream out your name  from the window, vainly competing with the music. We watched him call for 4-5 people with visibly growing aggrivation. 

The menu itself was pretty simple, though I know you can customize with eggs or extra patties. We opted for the Karai, or spicy burger, and an order of their garlic fries. We ate the fries on the drive home and had the burger once there. The fries seemed like they were from a box then heavily dosed with their garlic salt. I liked the sauces that came with them, but J thought they were too salty. The fries had decent crunch and heft- they weren't potato needles or massive steak fries.

Once we got to the burger, we were disappointed. The burger had flavor but was burnt on the outside and ultra-rare on the inside. Topped with a spicy mayo, another sauce, cucumber, avocado ""cream"" and a couple of other toppings, it had an interesting combo of textures and flavors to compliment the meatiness, but not enough to save it from being mediocre. The burger may have been more redeemable if the experience/atmosphere of ordering it hadn't put us off. 

The area around the truck was trashed with half eaten food and debris everywhere. Stickers and photos covered much of the windows and the only insights we had into the kitchen was the irritated guy sticking his head out and yelling at a ""mutha fuga'!""to get back in the truck. 

This is really an instance where the business philosophy shines at the forefront. Compare these fellows to the Slider truck; The boys there sing while cooking, happily greet their customers with enthusiasm & a fist bump, maintain a clean exterior and fairly consistent food preparation. I've had a mediocre slider and forgiven them because they were so pleasant to deal with. The food here has the potential for awesomeness but I just don't want to deal with a disorderly mob to get a burger. 

EDIT: Bumped a star for owner response :} It's always nice to see a business taking the time to respond to criticisms directly like that.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,8,5,3,BPy_zkyk1sz68GidXfzqUg
2247886,2010-11-16,1,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"allow me to compare fukuburger truck in the realm of food-trucks. growing up in L.A. county, that city is swarming with food trucks. but i've never actually experience one like this before. the oriental gourmet of street culinary experience. a trifecta of chopsticks meet bun, bun meets wheels, wheels meet china town. you know that acronym? BYOC: bring your own chair. or you can stand and practice your hold-plate while eating primitave style.

the line gets pretty long, so the thing about one man taking the order and sending it in can take a hot minute. hot in vegas espeicially near the exhaust of the truck. i can feel my legs melting. 

the wait can bring bond time with the kids i came with or chat it up with the owners, or even chat with some new face. whichev'.

the first burger i tried was the ""tamago"" pretty challenging to eat. super delish and juicy but equally sloppy. mac salad was pretty creative, the toppings gave it texture- which i love in food.  and the shaved ice is served in the generous amount. 

ive had good times here with friends and fam and good music. i guess the parking lot gave lasting memories.

good thing they're open late, in case im craving a good quality burger.",DASkWfrV6kWHE_4xC7BkYQ,2,2,4,F27HFfYvLtVId4WeCMLzGA
2257391,2010-09-26,0,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"What what is all this crazy around these food trucks?? What makes a burger truck any better than a chain fast food burger joint?? I guess it's the Asian Fusion of the burgers? Or the crowd of kids that hang out in the parking lot making it the ""cool"" thing to do? I don't know, but I had to go see.

It wasn't smart of me to go to Serendipity for a huge sundae before hitting up a food truck though. *note to self*

Okay, so its Westside Wednesdays! So we found the truck parked in front of the RedHand Tattoo joint. 6 burgers to choose from..and some typical asian snacks. Me and the bf go for the #2 (something about an overeasy egg in a burger makes things better) and a #5... a spicy habanero burger. Also saw a flyer for some garlic fries and strawberry lemonade. I'm sold! So the 4 items came to $14. Good deal! Wanted to leave a tip forthe jelly, but I don't like that jelly stuff. Next time...! Just so they can all shout ""tip jelly!""

So stood there a couple minutes and we got our food. Walked back to our car to enjoy the new discoveries. It was a bit messy.. but finger licking goodness!

The verdict on the food itself? YUMM!! Well, one thing that bugged me was the bun. It seemed like a super cheapy store bought massive quantity burger bun. But I didn't expect much. The burgers themselves though, were awesome! The blend of flavors worked so well. I preferred the #2 over the #5 (can't remember the names, but there's a photo of the menu somewhere here...). The dip for the garlic fries was good, and the seasoning on the fries were good. Didn't care for the lemonade though, somewhat tart and kinda watery.

So this marks the beginning of the food truck journey for me. Maybe I will return to Fuku Burger, but not til I have tried them all!",JY0rvs_4HBjXKdRB07aEnQ,1,1,4,Ey7YG1dZdLqbLKbJtRCw-A

2261958,2012-04-12,1,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"THE FAVORITE BURGER JOINT IN LAS VEGAS IS FUKUBURGER!!!  Had to type that in all caps, it's that true!!!  We came across this foodtruck a little over a year ago, and after eating every burger in town, this is still the reigning champion of meaty deliciousness!  'Fuku', meaning happiness (I know, it looks a lot like something else-my family is from Fukuoka) we follow their whereabouts in Vegas and make our way over to them when they're in somewhat close proximity!

Definitely a younger, hip, skateboarder cum LA following, the owners have created a Japanesque twist that elevates the All American Classic to new heights...

With foodtrucks emerging as a viable dining establishment, it's getting harder and harder to shine from the onslaught of mediocrity that you find nowadays. And especially if you go to the food truck nights or festivals, the competition is fierce and your choices boundless.  But with Fukuburger, you can't go wrong.

With six main burger choices, (check their twitter for the burger specials)  we have come to rely on the two all time favorites:  The Tamago Burger and the Chicken Katsu.  From the first time we had these two, it blew our minds right out of our car!  It's pretty pathetic that we actually haven't tried a couple of the others (The Kinoko Burger, The Buta Burger and The Karai Burger)  but it's like when you know you have to have those two, when you drove out there for those two, you gotta get those two.....(one day, we have to starve ourselves and then order all six of them at once).  That'll be a long night afterwards...

So their hamburger meat comes from Larry's Great Western Meats over on Valley View, and the quality is top notch.  This where a great burger start and ends, it should be fantastic with nothing on it, the meat has to be flavorful and rich, (not just greasy and fatty).  So these guys got it right from the start!

The Tamago Burger; A Fuku Patty (they have their own secret ingredients to make it taste divine) with Teriyaki Sauce and Wasabi Mayo, Furikake (Japanese Bonito Flakes) and then topped with Crispy Haystack Onions and A Fried Egg.  Okay folks, I want to emphasize to you about THE EGG!!!
It's is a perfectly cooked, runny egg that mixes with the burger to create a moist and texturally satisfying combination!  The egg squirts out upon your first bite and runs down your hand and you find yourself sucking it off of everything that it lands on!  These guys have perfected the art of egg frying in such a little, mobile kitchen!  Topped with the creaminess of Mayo and soyness of Teriyaki, we are obsessed with this flavor profile, hands down best burger in Vegas!

The next on the list is the Chicken Katsu-katsu of all kinds are our favorite dish, (Pork, Chicken-fry it and we'll eat it).  I have never had Kastu like the one at Fuku, that is one tender piece of fried chicken. The exterior is fried to a perfect crunch with a deep brown hue while the chicken is moist and soft to the bite!
It's topped with shredded cabbage (an accompaniment with Katsu) Crack and Katsu Sauce. It is the personification of perfection in a paper basket-Foodtruck food heaven!

It's a shame that we also haven't gotten around to their Hot Dogs, but I'm less worried about that.

We've had the Furikake Mac Salad, it's straight up dope-it's Kewpie based, so you know its for real.

But the main side that is a must is the Jazz Fries- it awesome!  It's got Gravy and Crack Sauce on top and again a twist on an American Classic to round off the meal.

I can't say more about Fukuburger, you have to try it once and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.  For those who haven't tried it, or can't get to the Foodtruck, I'm sorry, but you haven't lived!!!

2334105,2012-06-12,8,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"Anyone giving Fukuburger less than 4 stars should be embarrassed. I even give the quizzical eye to you 4 stars. This is the best food truck in all of Las Vegas.

These are guys never flaky. They are punctual and I never waited unreasonably long. Am I sad they don't have tip jelly right now? No. They still say ""tip jelly"" and that's the best part.

The truck is also the best looking one in Vegas. You can recognize that bright red from the street. The dudes are funny and they always have that nice pretty girl there (It's all part of being a Jenny, wink wink).

It's the food though that truly makes this 5 stars. If they have a special, get it. The chef is a mad scientist of flavors and somehow creates complex harmony every time. They never overcook the patties. It's real meat too! A difference you can taste. Bring hella wet naps because it ain't good unless it's messy. Oh and that bun lustfully clings on to that patty. I could go on, but let's keep it PG.

My favorite one I may never have again was the special at the Downtown and 3rd Farmers Market. It was a burger using ingredients from the market. It had thick bitter greens and lavender. I think about this burger more than any other. It was juicy, bitter, floral. When you take a bite of one of their burgers it is like a fine craft brew- there is an aroma, initial taste and a finishing end- a journey.

No special? Don't fret. The tamago is objectively the best burger. Why? Because of the drippy egg. Simply delicious.

Crack Fries! This takes condiment-dependency to a whole new level. If I had to figure it out I'd say it was eel sauce and a variant of fry sauce generously thick over fries. Not a naked fry in sight.

The mac salad is COVERED in furikake.  And not the kind from the store. This one has so MANY yellow egg circles instead of the white. If my furikake at home was like that I'd put it on everything (even though I already do that).

Here's how to eat at Fuku. 
Step 1: Bring plenty of wet naps and don't wear anything nice.
Step 2: Get a food companion.
Step 3: Get 2 burgers and a side.
Step 4: Make sure no hotties see you when you eat because it's gonna be messy.
Step 5: Don't wash your hands too well so you can smell your hands as a remembrance throughout the day.",mxwMqra7TEZ6K4ML3DgPmA,4,3,5,L9a0vTyiuyGL4PwkeYkrYw

I felt as though I had been propelled into a scene from The Fast and The Furious, everyone was kicking it on their trucks & the vibe was hypnotic!

The sweet & gorgeous Jasmine who took my order was really nice & had no altitude. Everyone around me seemed relaxed and just enjoying their food. 
As soon as my order came up & I pulled up an orange bucket, my mouth seriously started to water. DAMMMMMMMMMMMMMN the garlic fries were popping & my mouth exploded with flavor. I bit into the burger, another flavor explosion, then the Naga Dog. It was like an explosion of flavor fireworks going off one after another, my tastebuds = pure heaven.

Their food is so good that their reputation has reached all the way to LA with an actual sit down restaurant! So if you are in the Hollywood area, make Fuku a part of your lunch/dinner plans. Your hungry stomach will thank you!

As for the actual Fukuburger Truck, I originally gave these guys 4 stars because I'm very picky with who I give 5 stars to and it is very rare. The fact that it's a roadside truck and not a sit down restaurant, was major to me. BUT since I have been eating at their different locations regularly, I have grown to know the owners, Colin and Mags. You will not meet any nicer owners anywhere. Since these guys are customer friendly and they try to cater to everybody's requests, they have earned that 5th star! I appreciate the fact that they actually get back to you when you contact them. 

Now for the food. Doesn't matter if you're a first timer or not, everything on their menu is fantastic. Their beef Fuku patty is so juicy and perfectly seasoned that you will probably use it as the measuring stick to any burger you eat from that point on. What makes them unique is the different ingredients they put in their menu that you just can't find in other burger joints. Oh, and I can't forget to mention their different specials every night. Always something new and tasty. Special props goes out to Colin and Mags for actually naming their special the other night with my name! Awesome! Tell me how many other places would do that for you? Thanks again guys! Whatever you decide, you gotta get jazz fries with it. Trust me on this.

Prices are reasonable compared to those other gourmet places. They take cash and cards. Remember, it's not easy to operate a food truck and they work hard so you can have a freshly cooked burger, so don't hesitate to show them your appreciation. Whether it's by tipping or giving them a great review, it's up to you.

In conclusion, you will not find a better burger truck anywhere. Go to their website www.fukuburger.com for more info in regards to their shedule and contact info. Make these guys your regular stop and they will have you saying ""TIP JELLY!""",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,8,7,5,dvmGkj8zR_bphEEXZXQgCw

A couple weeks later we popped a couple or our friends' FUKUcherries when I ordered food to go to enjoy while watching UFC118 at their home...

Review Time:

Since my first FUKU experience I have discovered that the mystery sauces with the french fries were banana ketchup and sweet chili mayo. For the record, I'm an American-born Filipino.  Banana ketchup isn't new to me, however I never touched the stuff growing up (I hated all things ketchup...long story).  Funny how sometimes its better not to ask.... I digress.

I tried a few new things.

NAGA DOG: my new favorite. Serious.  Its a hot link (that I think is deep-fried...but its probably cooked on a flat top) with grilled kim chee, daikon relish, wasabi mayo (?) and some kind of habanero teriyaki-type sauce. OMG. delicious.

FUKU MOCO: not bad for $5. Heap of rice topped with a FUKU patty, a fried egg and smothered in garlicky brown gravy.  I think I remember reading it coming with some kind of bonito flake but since I took mine to go it probably melted into my food.  Anywho, kind of heavy so itd be a good hangover preventer ;)

CHICKEN KATSU SANDWICH: Oh my.  This sandwich is simple yet delicious.  Perfectly breaded with a nice crunch, juicy, and perfectly seasoned chicken breast.  Shredded cabbage and a little of the not-so-secret-anymore chili mayo. YUM. There may be a little katsu sauce also, but with the food from this truck you kind of dont have time to stop and think... you just eat bite after bite and think, ""damn. why is this SO good?!""

I have yet to try the Buta Burger, the Kinoko and the original Fuku burger.

Until next time!!! (Don't forget to TIP JELLY!)

I've tried all of their burgers, dogs, drinks, and sides thus far and I have nothing bad to say about any of them. I think my favorite burger will always be the Tamago.

Hell, I didn't even think I liked wasabi, but spread it on top of ground beef and it's surprise deliciousness.

So I had some Fukuburger about two days ago, ate the #2 Tamago Burger and everything was just perfect.  The sauce, meat, buns, were all so good.

It was all a great experience for me (except the part when I was trying to start the car in vain. Thankfully, there were some friendly people and I was able to jump start the car :D).

While I fully expected waiting in lines at this food festival, I never expected I would be waiting as long as I did at Fukuburger. First, my boyfriend and I got Tastybunz, where we waited about an hour altogether. After trying that, we made our way over to Fukuburger so we could try it for the first time. The line was just as long as Tastybunz's was, so we figured we would wait about the same time. This was not the case at all. We waited in line for an hour just to order, but then waited yet another hour for our food to come out. The waiting was awful considering there were obnoxious drunk people spilling beers on your feet, screaming in your ears, and blowing smoke in your face. Also, we were completely turned off when we noticed the guys of Fukuburger were serving their friends who were simply just walking straight up to the pick up window asking for food and receiving it immediately. I understand these people were their friends, but it was incredibly annoying and frustrating considering we were waiting forever just to get 2 burgers, along with about 30 other people too. When our order was finally ready, we grabbed our food and left the area so we could eat in peace. At this point, we were agitated and tired of standing, but nonetheless excited to get our first taste of Fukuburger. Sadly, after taking our first bite, we came to realize that the burgers were completely raw and inedible. We were so disappointed and mad that we had just wasted money and time on burgers we couldn't even eat. With that said, I gave two stars only because the actual flavor of the rest of the burger was good and I do understand it was probably hard feeding a crowd so large.

I tried their namesake burger and love it.  The meat is seasoned, which is a huge plus since others tend to forget to season the meat, not just sprinkle seasoning on it while it's grilling.  I also love the fact that their burgers are juicy every single time.

Sure it may get hot during the day in the summer but when night rolls around, being outside is simply majestic.  Why not then, combine the social aspects of dining with the wonderful atmosphere that a desert summer night can provide?  Well the guys behind the Fukuburger truck have done just that.  Not only have they created a social atmosphere unlike anything else in Vegas, they have created a menu that doesn't suffer one iota from the limitations that a mobile kitchen can create.

Setting up shop in a non-descript parking lot in Chinatown on Spring Mountain, the truck may be small but packs a hell of a culinary punch.  After meeting one of the owners Colin, he walked me through the menu and explained all the ingredients are made from scratch and sourced from local Asian markets.  Everything he showed me looked and sounded great so I asked him what his favorite was and he said the Tamago Burger.  Never one to shy from a good recommendation, I ordered that with some of their garlic fries that come with an Asian inspired aioli sauce.  

As I waited for my food to be prepared, the stream of people coming and ordering their dinner was non-stop.  Patrons were also pulling up their cars, playing music, drinking beers they brought and the whole atmosphere reminded me of a tailgate if it was hipsters running the show and not jocks.  It then donned on me that Fukuburger had really captured something awesome.  Food at the end of the day is food, some is better than others.  What truly makes a place special is if they pair their food with an atmosphere that does the food justice.  For some spots that mine mean white table clothes and an ocean view.  For others, that might mean nothing more than the American look of greasy spoon and for Funkuburger, it was the energy of Chinatown and Las Vegas and the desert warmth.  

I devoured my food as soon as it was prepared and enjoyed the complex flavors that the Asian/burger fusion provided.  The guys behind Fukuburger have really explored their Asian roots and let their imaginations run wild with their creations.  The Tamago Burger I got had an egg, onion straws and the meat was marinated in Teriyaki and other spices of the Orient.  A nice treat for this Jewish boy.  The fries were good too, nothing that will set the world on fire but they certainly complemented the burger nicely.  

The prices are very reasonable (think 7-8 bucks a person) and the service very friendly and accommodating.  In the end, I came for the food and stayed for the atmosphere.  I cant wait to come back and visit the Asian-inspired tailgate party that captures the true essence of social dining.

I finally made it out to the Fukuburger truck with my friend who had a car since the truck is parked in Chinatown. We were staying at the Rio and found that from there it is a very short drive.

As me and my friend perused the menu deciding on what to get, two of the Fukuburger truck staff (I'm forgetting their names after a Vegas and alcohol infused trip) asked if they could help us decide what we wanted to get.

 I finally decided on the #3 Buta Burger, a flavorful burger topped with apple wood smoked bacon, American cheese, pickled red onions and red ginger, finished with Japanese BBQ sauce & wasabi mayo.

I was talked into trying their Jazz fries, french fries covered in gravy and ""crack sauce"" for $3

To wash it all down I got the strawberry lemonade.

Total? $10 for everything, which in comparison to the Bay Area food trucks, is a bargain. 

I wanted to get a T-shirt also ($20) but the largest size they had on hand was a large :( - Have some XL's printed up and I'll get me one of those shirts to add to my food truck collection (Collection= One = Mogo)

I had the tamago burger. Somewhat comparable to the Ronin burger at Bachi. This is a little smaller, but in this instance it's a case of quality not quantity. When I bit into the burger, the crunchiness of the egg white, and the creaminess of the yolk combined with the fried onion along with the furikake and other condiments, was simply put, outstanding. I wolfed that burger down and proceeded to have the daily special, the 4-20 burger, smoked bacon, shisito peppers and garlic aioli, also outstanding.

3282995,2012-08-15,0,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"Let me just say the food gets four stars! The Tamago Burger (egg burger) includes an egg with runny yolk in the middle of the burger and that adds so much more flavor to the already yummy teri-burger. It's my favorite but you have to be prepared to get your hands dirty. And because most of the time I don't want to get my hands dirty, I get the Mushroom Burger instead. Made with shiitake mushrooms, they add an extra layer of flavor and juiciness to the burger and balance the greasiness of it.

So what makes it three-star? The wait. If there's less than 8 people waiting in front of you, you're in luck. If there's more than 8 people, which often there is because fuku is that good, you'll have to stand around for at least half an hour waiting for your food. As good as the burgers are, it unfortunately isn't worth the wait for me. So even if I'm suffering from Fuku withdrawal, you'll see me passing by instead of stopping if there's a crowd tapping their feet and waiting for their burger.",RajSojRxTWY2PYrCWF9gBQ,1,0,3,-J55G9AhylRDP8u8aJ5Qxg

Its no secret that foodtrucks are popping up all over the place. Alot of people think its a gimmick but Fuku is here to prove them wrong. LIke many places, fuku serves up that ""fusion"" burger, - traditional american food with a Asian twist. All of their burgers have Japanese influences (fuku means lucky in Japanese), from pickled ginger, chicken katsu sandwiches, wasabi mayo, whatever, these burgers are pretty different that what you can find else where.

The truck travels around vegas, but you find their schedule on their website - http://fukuburger.squarespace.com/schedule/ and they are pretty good to sticking to their sched unlike some other foodtrucks which never show up or dip out early. Definitely worth checking out is the buta burger (bacon cheese burger my fave) and the chicken katsu which is pretty creative. 

There are a couple downsides though, they don't offer anything for your vegie/vegan/hippie friends (jk). So keep that in mind if you take your friends there. On top of that it can be a little pricey, $5 for a burger and its kind of small, but its more than worth it.

Fuku is a unique setup. The menu is small but the food doesn't taste bad whatsoever. My wife and daughter had the garlic fries and the Macaroni salad. $2 each so not bad at all. I had the burger with egg (Tamago) and the spicey burger (Karai). At $5 a pop they are sort of expensive but they are fresh and definitely have an Asian flavor. I didn't care for the egg burger as the egg was a little runny. The spicey burger was better, tasted really good. I want to try the chicken and hotdog next.

The end result was a lovely visit to this mobile food truck. Me and my friends caught them on their westside wednesday location and from the moment we entered the parking lot, I could smell the wonderful aromas for burgers grilling.

The burgers are priced pretty decent.. and coming from eating a very expensive burger the previous day, the $5 for the burgers was like pocket change. The portions at least for me were ok.. though after I finished off my first burger (the Fuku-Burger) and the OMG delicously seasoned fries with their addictive sauces.. I had to order more food..

At which point I got the Karai burger, which was their spicy burger. Even that one was cooked nicely and tasted wonderful. It wasn't as spicy as I had thought, but there was that kick to it and made it just melt in your mouth.

More recently, I tried their asian burger (I forget the name). It had shitake mushrooms, pickled cabbage and wasabi mayonaisse. It was absolutely delectable and was far and above the best food I've ever had at a food truck. The meat was juicy and adequately sized for my appetite (which is usually moderate).

Favorite thing to order is the Tamago.
The Naga dog is pretty bomb also, so if you're not in the mood for a burger, this will get you your Fuku fix.

Also when you order make sure you get fries.  The seasoning and dipping sauces are awesome and if you're feeling crazy, get the Jazz fries.  If you don't feel like getting fries, get the macaroni salad.  Also very bomb.

Aside from all the good food, the staff is very friendly and they show plenty of gratitude to their patrons.  Sometimes they even give away free fries if they feel that we've been waiting too long (never had to wait more than 15 min).

I was ready for a crowd of wild kids and crazy music but I was only half right. There were a bunch of younger kids and loud music but nothing too out of line. Ordering was quick and easy and I was told to try the Buta Burger. It was like a flavor explosion in my mouth with the combination of sauces and textures. Not to mention the bacon was so thick and succulent that I could have just eaten a side order of that.

For a side I ended up choosing the Jazz fries which were smothered in a tasty gravy and a sauce that tasted like wasabi without the insane heat. It was a perfect complement to the burger except for the fact that I might now have heart disease. Fuck it, well worth it!

The only downside to ordering a full sized burger as opposed to sliders is the fact that you can't try several things unless you're HUGE. I guess I'll have to go back another night to try the Tamago burger and garlic fries to complete my FUKU experience.

TIME: 
Fast courteous service by a hottie that was high in sugar....upselled and suggested items that were not in the menu or are a rare item on the menu. Food was out in 7 to 10 minutes. 
TASTE: 
-OMG! Burger #1 (Fuku burger) was amazingly good, in my 10yrs in Vegas it has to be one of the best burgers in recent memory, the beef on my burger was really fresh and tasty, their ingredients are fresh and you can taste every single one of them and they are all taste of high quality. 
-their Spicy Hot Dog was also excellent, it had spicy stuff inside the dog itself just enough to give it a kick but not too much to make your mouth burn 
- also their French Fries were good, very different from the other generic fast food places, as you bite the crunchy edges the seasoning makes you salivate just in time for the inside of the french fry (which taste like actual potato) mix and have a great combination of seasoning and potato. 
CLEANLINESS: 
The food truck itself is clean but keep in mind you will be spending your time in a parking lot....and parking lots can be messy, so if you are a clean freak you can take it to go or eat in the comfort of your car otherwise chill there with the other cool people, dance if you want to, grab a bucket to seat or seat on a ledge somewhere...its good times around the truck. 

The rundown: 
Awesome food that's great tasting and will not stink your hands and mouth up like fast food places, different, fun and at a great price.

I took that first bite, and my heart sunk as my palate danced for joy. I couldn't believe it. I found a burger that tastes better than a Hodad's double cheeseburger SACed. Damnit though this burger is so good. It was the #1 that thoroughly pleased me. I also ordered the #3 at my friends urging, he said to try them both for good measure. They're cheap, delicious, kind of small, but oh so delicious. I still can't wrap my mind around it. Yes, I would rather have a Hodad's burger since it's one of my favorite eating establishments in the world due to the atmosphere and the food, but seriously Fukuburger needs to take a road trip about 5 hours southwest to San Diego so I can experience that wonderfulness again soon. I also tried the garlic fries which were good, and a side of kim chi which was also really good. I love Fukuburger.",fLs6kjU7XKSIjzMKYTjO3A,0,0,5,IKjVn6sehxKkFeZrYGNVNg

The lines take forever but it's fine because the rest of the customers waiting are really friendly. 

The Tomago Burger is to die for. I was a little skeptical about the idea of putting egg on my burger, but I'm glad I did. The egg doesn't taste ""eggy"" at all, but instead ""cheesy"". The flavors mix well together . 

The truck is only open during late hours, which I am totally ok with. I'd rather not stand in those long lines in the blisterng sun.

Quick Review¬ô
*This rating and review is based on a series of firsthand experiences of patronising this truck and personal exchanges.
*For the purposes of contextualization of this review: the truck is not the storefront, B&M locations (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fukuburger-las-vegas) (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fuku-burger-las-vegas-2).
*Some items I have tried: Tamago, Chicken Katsu, fries, jelly* (*not made in-house, but instead somewhere in Japan).

-----------------------------------------¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠-----------------------

Step 1: Place your order with the pretty, young lady. Yes, you can even place your order if there is no pretty lady and a dude instead. Maybe he will be pretty from your perspective. YMMV.

Step 2: Give them a funny -- appropriate to be announced through the PA  -- nickname. (Think of the children.)

Step 3: Tip. Receive jelly. Put in pocket for later. 

Step 4: Eat. 

-----------------------------------------¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠-----------------------

Now, it is my position that it is a decent burger. Especially when accounting for how little pays. If you disagree: let's not go to war over it. It would be a bizarre society if we just had to agree on everything.

Patty cooked right, egg cooked right. I had no problems with the food. It's just ... 

It has proven difficult to locate them because they blocked me on Twitter. I guess they disagree with the school of thought that disagreement is to be tolerated and even flourished in a free society.

Fukuburger serves some Japanese-style fusion burger. I first had Fukuburger few years ago at First Friday. I ordered their Buta Burger which consist of all beef Fuku-patty with applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, pickled red onions and red ginger, topped with Japanese BBQ sauce and wasabi mayo. 

Total 2 hours of wait for a burger which sounds ridiculous, but as soon as I took a bite, I fell in love. It was none like I had in the past. I love their Japanese twist of adding wasabi mayo and red ginger in a burger because you can't find that combination anywhere, especially on their juicy beef patty. I devoured my burger like a gorilla.

Ever since the day I met Fukuburger, I started having dreams about it. My love for Fukuburger kept growing by day. Then my second visit slapped me in the face. My buta burger was cold and their patty and bacon in the burger were extremely dry. I'm still giving this place 4 stars because the girls that takes the order are super friendly and I love their system of calling out the orders where customers get to choose a creative name to be called for a pickup. 

I was disappointed by my second visit but might give another chance in the future. Check their website to see where they are today: http://www.fukuburger.com/",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,7,6,4,7DgAVw7mdrMb3eG_Mxa_Pw

I had the kinoku-mushroom burger. It has grilled shitaki mushrooms, pickled ginger, and wasabi mayo on  a fuku patty. I now know the meaning of ""umami"". The fifth taste, savory. The patty on this burger has a unique flavor that can only be described as ""umami"". And the other toppings together make the burger that much better.

They were parked outside Kuma Snow Cream for its grand opening event. In spite of the intense heat, we opted to go for burgers instead of braving the long lines for the sweet treats.

Quickly glancing at the menu, I skipped the plain-sounding option #1 and went for #2, the Tamago Burger. They'll ask you for a nickname instead of your actual name to call your order. It seems that Pokemon were really popular that evening, but I went with... something else that you'll have to ask me about later.

After several minutes, my $5 morsel of goodness came out. It was impressively hard to eat with all the ingredients and mayo literally bursting from the sides. I ended up having to cradle the burger with one hand and to support it with the paper plate in my other hand. Then I licked my hand clean and wiped it down with the napkins. I have no shame; it was that yummy.

I've had most of the items on their menu and they're all good with the exception (for me) the Chicken Katsu. Their burgers have a flavor like none other and their presentation is always on point. The Fukuburger was the first thing I tried from there and I remember my first bite into it. I LIT UP and simply thought ""this is the burger of my life""!! I quickly ordered a second burger (the Tamago) and was very pleased. My favorite is still the Buta.

The crack sauce is a high light of Fuku because it seems to work on everything. The fries are great even when they stand alone but the crack sauce takes it to another level! Even the gravy on top of the fries with the crack sauce is just magic! I love their menu.

The staff there are always nice and easy going and seem like they genuinely care for their product and their customers. They always stay on top of updates on their Twitter should any discrepancies happen and are always punctual.

If you haven't tried this place, it's a MUST HAVE!! You and whoever you bring with you will not look at any other burger the same after this. It's a curse and a gift. A gift, in that you will always find something to cling to on the menu as you try different things. A curse in way that any other burger just seems sub par and will take a back seat to Fuku's.

I more than gladly took them up on this offer. As the 1st time I visited Fuku was really good and the second time was just alright. 

This time I ordered the 1 and the 5. The burgers were both awesome. Love the pickled ginger on a burger and this time the number 5 had a little more heat to it. I still thing the special fries at this place are worth a pass in the long run. Just not enough fries for my taste. 

I did get a second to visit with the owner. He was a very nice guy who you can tell loves what he does. He is what more owners/managers should be like. Taking great pride in his product and making sure his customers are happy. He also explained how price is affected by were they are parked and how much a space rental might be.

I've literally never eaten anything else here, because this is the most perfect food. I'm sure everything is great, but the Tamago...The burger is always perfectly cooked (I request well done), and while some places drown their burgers in sauce to mask a blah patty, at Fuku everything (amazing sauce, beautiful fried egg, french fried onions) stands out while still complimenting the meat, which has an awesome sear and caramelization thing going on.

The jazz fries on the other hand, were absolutely effin fanstastic, only that thick fries don't work too well combined with the gravy, its still pretty good. I would  definitely start having gravy with my fries.

Tamago - $6 - I loved the taste of the patty. It was juicy and flavored really well. And everything is better with a fried egg!

I also gave a lil YEEHAW!  So when my burger was ready, they called out YEEHAW!!!!  Strawberry lemonade was soooo good.  I am not usually one to order sweet drinks, but I enjoyed this a lot, savoring it til I got home after a 15 min drive.

The burger itself was tasty, a nice size.  Loved the fresh cucumbers, and it had a zing, but I never found or tasted the avocado.  The guy behind me had just arrived in moving truck to Vegas from my hometown Houston, so we started chatting.  He ordered the tamago burger, my next choice when I get to Fukuburger again, and scarfed it down and his side of fries faster than me.  It is probably because I talked more than I ate though.  I tend to do that!  

Anyway, the guy taking orders overheard me say I Yelped to my new line-friend, and said Yelpers are hard to please.  I told him if he had napkins, then I am easy to please.  Anyway, they had some special burgers for $1 more to check out too.

I must say that I've really become a FUKU fan over the past few weeks. They seem to have really hit their stride. Some of their burgers aren't quite as good as others. But that's not because they're bad. They're all bloody good! They're just not as super fuku awesome as my two faves: the Tamago and the Katsu.

And now they're doing secret menus?!? Just tonight, they posted on Twitter that they are doing Fuku-Moco, for one night only. I'm missing out! Last week, someone messaged me on Twitter that I need to try the ""Fat Hakujin."" It's apparently a double Buta (bacon) burger with egg. I had a double Buta once and it kicked my butt. In any case, I think I'd rather get a single Buta with egg. I want to be able to savor all of the ingredients and not be overwhelmed with their beef patties (as good as they are).

Seriously. Whenever someone suggests or even hints at going to Fukuburger, I get totally psyched. It's become pretty much a weekly thing.

4669593,2010-07-05,0,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"After the success of Slider Trucks, its no surprise that more food trucks popped up. The Japanese inspired food truck delivers in creativity, but needs to work on execution. 

I went with the #1 Fuku Burger that costs $5. Its your traditional burger of tomatoes, lettuce, and onions, but with pickled garlic and their Fuku sauce. My first bite, I knew I wouldn't be a fan of it. First, the sauce drowned the entire burger, so you really couldn't taste anything else. The burger patty also had something in it, possibly the garlic that just obliterates the pallet where you can't even taste anything anymore. Lastly, they used a lot of salt, and I mean a lot of it. I'm not one to usually ding a place for using MSG or anything else that makes you thirsty, but I never EVER had to drink so much water after eating a meal. 4 full glasses of water last night and as I'm writing this review, drinking even more water. Ridiculous. 

For mentioning Yelp, I got the free flavored ice mountain. Mine was really a mountain, I think it was taller than the Stratosphere. Regular price is $3, which is pricey for literally shaved ice and artificial food flavorings. There wasn't anything special about this, but anything cold in the hot Vegas summer would be good. 

I didn't get a chance to try the garlic fries because they ran out. Forgivable? Yes. However, its not a good sign especially for a grand opening.

The wait time for the food is similar to Slider Truck, but I would say Fuku is slightly faster. For a decent size line, expect a 5 minute wait. Then expect another 10 - 15 minutes for your food. Definitely not a place to grab a quick bite.

Again, I'll say the same thing as I did for Slider Truck as a suggestion for this place. Be considerate about how you communicate with your customers, whether its food shortages, locations, or any important information. Remember that not everyone has access to internet all the time. 

I give this place credit for being creative, but at the end of the day the food just didn't work. There is a lot of room for improvement and I'm willing to try this place again in the future if its around my area. Otherwise, its not worth driving and hunting for this place with so many other venerable burger places in town.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,3,1,2,A6PxUpPZJs0g3IcXmvDgKQ

anyway...every time we've gone there's always a crazy crowd (some of them just there to hang out and others waiting to order, waiting for food or eating). the menu is clearly located on the truck and everything looks yummy! my boyfriend tried the burgers in order (starting with the fukuburger he just had the karai and next is the katsu). i, on the other hand, went for the kinoko because of the mushrooms. and of course, we had to get an order of fries. we also ordered a strawberry lemonade, since they made it fresh every day.

tip: tip!!! they say ""tip jellaaaaaaaay!"" when you tip, and give you a flavored jello stick. 

anyway, we stood around and waited for our food, debating on eating there or going home. maybe 5-10 minutes later they called my name (the 1st time it was ""rica suave""), we grabbed our food and went home.

everything tasted pretty good, even after a 5 minute drive home. burgers were tasty and the spicy mayo/garlic sauce is so addicting!!!

After a long day of studying, it was the best decision I'd made all day to go to Fukuburger.  The scene this day was very busy, the parking lot mirroring a scene from Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift or something.  Whatever it was, I definitely felt out of place in my jeep wrangler.  The line was pretty long, but went by relatively fast.  There were a lot of young people there, looked like high schoolers, I assume an open parking lot with food was their version of a party or something.  After getting my food, though, I noticed why they were all hanging out. The food is really damn good.  

I ordered the Buta Burger and Togarashi Fries, my friend got the Spicy Karai Burger, and we both got a Naga Dog.  The Buta Burger was topped with applewood smoked bacon, pickled ginger, cheddar cheese, onions, and japanese bbq sauce: ""you had me at applewood smoked bacon"".  The whole burger worked perfect together.  I loved the texture the burger itself had, I love the japanese bbq sauce, and i love the combo of the pickled ginger and red onions.  Everything was great.  
The togarashi fries were also really good.  A little hint of spice and served with some special sauce and ketchup, and the fries themselves were nice and crispy.  

The Naga Dog was also very good.  The hot dog itself was pretty big, and was very crisp in texture.  Topped with nori, and a bunch of other stuff that I have no idea what it was.  The flavor combination worked very well, and was pretty spicy, too... kinda like a chicago red hot.  

What my friend and I both were impressed with was their flavor combination's and seasonings.  Everything was seasoned perfectly: all the sauces, the fries, the burger.  And all the flavors they used worked well together and were very unique.

He actually remembered us from last week which was really awesome.  Shows that they take the time to really get to know their clientele.  

I got the chicken katsu burger AGAIN and once again, I was thoroughly impressed.  The katsu was so crispy and the sauce was sensational.  I was in such awe with this burger. 

What really made this experience was the fact that I got to meet the founders of Fuku Burger.  They were two guys who started the truck years ago.  I asked them why the Fruit loop and they told me that this was the very first place they wanted to sell their food at.  The owners of Freezone originally told them that they needed to sell somewhere else, so they ended up in Chinatown.  Later, they moved to L.A. and eventually opened a restaurant there.  Today, Freezone has invited the food truck back to the fruit loop as they realize the mistake they have made.

Still, this is at the Fuku truck with the crew present so I think it should get a review. The event was a Herbs and Rye and Retro Bakery showed up so it was a trifecta of food love for me and I respect that businesses are collaborating. 

I definitely would have regretted if I did not meet the Yelpers here pre-Titanic/Bodies exhibit CMYE.

BF and I grabbed one of each Jet Tila specials ($6 each, $1 of it goes to charity). 

Monkey Ball Curry- this was such a lovely balanced curry and I could have eaten a pot of it. I love the plaintains as the starch since it has a bit more texture and sweetness. BF said it's the most amazing panang style he's had and it definitely was up there for me. 

""Chicken and Waffles"" Okinawan Style- Chicken skewer was crispy outside yet juicy with interesting spices that I can't quite place. Came with donuts with a cinnamon coating and syrup which was soft and super noms. I like the dishes separately and not together and wish I can order more donuts. 

Thai Mi Bahn Mi- Thai style bahn me sandwich with sliced sausage, cucumber, carrot, cilantro, jalapenos. This was good with the contents, but the bread was just okay. It was chewy and not that crispy crackling bread you come to associate with bahn mi sammies. 

Much respect to Jet Tila for coming out of his fancy kitchen and come cook in a moving box. 

I know it was a Fuku hosted special event, but it made me respect their business as a whole. I like that they think outside the box. I've heard that Westside Wednesdays has DJs, car enthusiasts, artist, etc. show up and show off and it becomes more of an event than a stop. Now they did their first pop up guest chef event and if they would do more (I hope) I would love to attend. I'm impressed someone can make an atmosphere out in a parkinglot but they somehow achieve it.

Definitely more excited to experience the entire menu of the Fuku truck.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,4,4,0mVV4C8VUmYCmc2wFgR4MA

The burgers here are asian inspired - this truck has a really great gimmick which is probably why they are so successful!    Upon arrival, we had a guy come up to take our order.  He took the time to explain what was in each of the burgers even though they were super busy.  I thought that was really nice.

We ended up getting the Tamago Burger and the Spicy Burger with fries on the side.  The Tamago burger had egg in it.  Flavors were awesome!  It was super super messy though - the yolk of the egg made the burger pretty soggy quickly.  I would actually prefer if they cooked the egg a little more just so it would be less soggy (it was hard to eat it standing up!).  The Spicy Burger wasn't too spicy - I would probably get this one again if we came back.  The flavors were tasty!  The fries were pretty standard, but they came with wasabi mayo that made it taste pretty good.

The prices were slightly high for what you get.  The burgers were really small!  I feel like they should be bigger.  We ended up paying like 20 bucks for our whole meal (including drinks and extra cheese).  Originally the bill came out to 16 bucks, we tipped a buck, but when I checked my bank statement we were charged 20 =(.  Not cool.  It might have been an honest mistake because it is hectic there.  Next time we go I'll be sure we pay only cash.  Besides that upset,  I guess it's the whole experience you pay for though - it is fun when your with your friends and definitely a cool thing to do.

BURGERS: I'm not sure exactly when, but everyone at Fuku became friends. Mags, Colin, the whole bunch! I was there multiple times a week to hang out and eat some awesome food. There are 6 burgers on the menu. My burger of choice is the #2 Egg Burger--Most delicious and messy thing on the menu. They have some sides available like fries & mac salad. Give the Jazz fries a shot (fries + gravy + crack sauce)!

OTHER: Fuku (Loco) Moco here is spot on here. And the Naga Dog is good but a little heavy for my taste. Every so often they'll have specials like Chicken & Waffles, special burger combos, and some interesting pop-ups like a Jet Tila collab. If the Chicken & Waffles are available---try them!

EVENTS: Fukuburger is one of the few trucks that is good all-around. They've got an awesome truck that rolls around to different events. In the past, they've been spotted at Vegas StrEats, Tommy Rockers, Molto Vegas, Hondoctors 5-Year Anniversary, & more.

I've heard so much about how the Vegas food truck scene had blown up while I was out of town, and I was excited to experience it for myself. Oh Fukuburger, you are the stuff of dreams.

Katrina M. recommended I get the Tamago Burger, and ever since, it has been a personal favorite. In addition to her order of the special that day, we decided to get the Mac salad as well as Garlic Fries. Sometimes, if I go to bed hungry, I dream of the Tamago burger - all of its deliciousness in the form of burger, bun, egg, crispy onion rings, and with an addition of Teriyaki sauce. Oh my, as you progress through the burger, the yolk starts to seep out and mix with the Teriyaki, forming a sauce that man simply can't duplicate. The mac salad was surprising really. It was light with just the perfect amount of mayo (impressive considering I am usually a staunch opponent to all things mayo). The fries were pretty good as well, fried up perfectly with the right amount of garlic and seasoning.

This being my first food truck, I am amazed to see how Vegas is slowly becoming more and more food-conscious. No longer are the days where McDonald's reigns supreme with deliciousness like Fukuburger around the corner.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,3,0,5,pTQAQzLhHvSCH3rsyrurAg

5198934,2010-07-05,11,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"So, yes, there was a time when these were my burger sentiments exactly: FU I am not eating meat. And, even now, I rarely eat meat, but on special occasions, I'll down a burger for the team. The 4th of July Fukuburger grand opening counted as such an occasion.

Yes, eating food from a truck is a little odd, especially when it is one hundred bazillion degrees outside, and the logistics of serving food from a truck are challenging. During our visit, the fryers were not working, and the electricity to the truck was having some issues. So, there were no fries or katsu, but, team Fuku pulled through. We could all use less fried foods anyways, right?

I had the Karai aka ""Spicy"" burger. It seemed the healthiest because instead of another form of meat or a fried item it had sliced cucumbers! It also had an avocado sauce, spicy mayo, and a habanero thing. Yes, thing. I am pretty sure the menu says kabayaki, so I am assuming it is a soy sauce based sauce made with habanero. Whatever it was, it was delicious. To me the brilliant combination tasted like the tastiest of cucumber kimchi on top of a fresh burger patty with a little extra spicy kick, but the spice level is not outrageous, so don't be scared. The meat was definitely well-done, which depending on your taste could be good or bad. I am kind of neutral on well-done; it beats pink in my book. 

The burgers are not huge, and most of them run $6 a pop, perhaps a tad pricey. And, there are no options for vegetarians aside from mac salad, fries and shaved ice.

Thank goodness they also have shaved ice. Otherwise, we definitely would have passed out from heat exhaustion. They are generous heaps of shaved ice with flavored syrups. We got straight up lime, and they were tasty and refreshing. Although, I couldn't help but think how marvelous fresh, homemade syrups on ice would be. If you're lookin' for a business idea that'll make the kids crazy, there you have it. One of these mixology joints in town should get on this pronto. 

But, I digress. Given that I am not a burger fanatic, I probably won't chase Fuku around town, but, the Karai has one slammin' taste profile, and I always show a little extra love to crazy creative Vegas entrepreneurs.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,21,15,4,uf-fvvEpWDnapXxhmaVZIQ

So, after almost 4 months of waiting, I finally had the opportunity (and someone to go with) to make my way to the FUKUburger truck on Spring Mountain.  This past Thursday, my friend from out of town (where else, but from Hawaii nei) was visiting our city.  My gf and I met up w/him @ 11:00pm at the truck.  It wasn't too crowded...I liked that!  Although, I would like see the hype on Westside Wednesdays - dj's spinning, hungry people...uh, dancing, high energy, I'm sure!

I ordered the Buta-burger (bacon burger), my friend, the Kinoko burger (mushroom burger), and my gf, the Fuku-moco (patty, egg, gravy all over rice...their interpretation of the Hawaii classic, Loco Moco).  Everything was delish!  The burgers were not extraordinarily huge or anything, kinda on the small side, but it was packed with flavor!  The fries were a wee skimpy, but again, with the garlic/mayo dip?  Tasty, tasty!  I forgot to try their mac salad w/furikake on it...from the looks on the menu, yum!  Guess I have to find my way back to the FUKUburger truck yet again!

The truck is parked in a parking lot next to a Bank of America, so there is ample parking.  Hungry night lifers (is that a word) set up shop at their cars, or around make-shift tables and chairs so they can have their grinds right there, on the spot.  It's a very hip and fun environment!  As my gf commented, it looked like a scene out of ""The Fast & The Furious,"" Tokyo Drift, of course.

Be sure to check the truck's schedule on their website, www.fukuburger.com, as to where they will appear.  OFF on Mondays, Rainbow on Tuesdays, Flamingo/Durango on Wednesdays, and Chinatown on Thursdays thru Sundays.  All from 8pm to LATE!  This is the perfect place for eats after a raving night out!

After whining about wanting a patty melt for the past week, my friend told me that they had a special the day before we met. Of course, my spirit was crushed and I was certain that the food gods were out to spite me. Yet again destiny was not on my side, so I resigned and went to the gym. My friend had asked the owner when they would run there special again, to which he responded that they were having it again THAT NIGHT! We had promised another friend's mom that we would eat dinner at their house after the gym. Yet again, if there is someone out there trying to thwart my chances of getting what I want, could you please stop. What were we to do? Eat dinner at our friend's house, and sneak out to get the Katty Melt after, of course. To not set back all our hard work, we decided to split a burger, mac salad, and a strawberry lemonade between the three of us.

The Katty Melt is a work of art. A perfectly cooked medium rare burger topped with miso sauteed red onions, swiss cheese, ponzu mayo, and the crispiest sourdough bread ever. I was in heaven.

This place is yummy, but the sandwiches are kind of small.  Food trucks are a different experience as well.  I like the vibe of this place because it's really chill and fun.  The dude taking orders asks for a nickname when your order gets called, and I thought it was kinda cool even though I gave someone's real name haha.  Like as said before, I like getting the Tamago cause of that deeelish fried egg that is super awesome in your mouth when the yolk breaks.  Also, I tried the jazz fries or whatever they're called and those were pretty good.  They have some kind of white and brown gravy that was tasty.  It was a little too much for me though.  That burger already has a lot of flavors going on and the fries were kind of like Wah Pow ! extra taste.  They also have strawberry lemonade which is really really sweet. Personal preference, again, on that one.  

Downsides: It's outside haha and the weather in Vegas isn't always optimal.  Also, they're so stingy on napkins! Like whatthe, these burgers are so messy and how you gonna give me enough napkins for one of my hands and half my face? Ok, I exaggerate, but really, they don't give you napkins with your order.

The food in my opinion is good, some of it is great and I order time and time again, and some of it is just way to salty to eat. (I ordered a nagadog once and could not even bring myself to finish half.)

The only thing that really bothers me is that every time I eat here I feel like I am playing Russian roulette. Because the next day I may or may not be getting the s**ts.

In anticipation of how good this new culinary venue might be, I had problems sleeping and even had a quick dream of the possibility of finding the perfect heavenly burger made in heaven.  At 10:14 am I rose, washed up, and called a friend of mine to invite him to Fuku Burger.  At 10:55 am we arrived in the Play it Again Sam parking lot in Chinatown.  The boys from Fuku Burger were finishing the final touches for opening:  Five gallon paint cans were turned upside down as they are improvised as seats; van wings were swung up; and the two guys took their respective positioning for opening.

My buddy, Brian, and I stepped up and placed the first orders for the day.  Brian ordered the Mushroom Fukuburger with fries and a bottled water while I ordered the Number one (regular Fukuburger), fries and a water.  It took about 15 minutes to get our burgers and fries but the wait was worth it.  The bun was soft, warm and fresh but the real magic was nestled between the bun.  The meat was fresh and tasty with a generous slice of tomato.  A bit of onion was accompanied by a small leaf of lettuce and it was all topped off with their special sauce.  It was delicious!

The fries were fine as they appeared to be a basic flash-frozen variety of medium sized potato sticks.  They were sprinkled with Fukuburger's special seasoning which did give the basic flavor a little kick (in the right direction).

Evidently, the chef felt bad for the initial delay for our burgers.  As a generous gesture on his part, he brought me and my buddy the ""Daily Burger Special"" to split.  The special was a burger topped with smoked Gouda cheese, a spicy Asian type sauce, with a bit of pork crumble on top of the cheese.  OMG, it was delicious and even though I was stuffed it made me want more.

Did I find the ""heavenly burger"" I dreamed about just hours before?  Probably not but they were very close. I will definitely be back very soon.

As a side note, the boys were very energetic about their business and loved bouncing off their customers.  I feel I not only found a wonderful place to frequent and eat but new friends as well.",Igju-tNzMmIn4LRldU5WrA,0,0,4,uJgyTErfWxmcVpZw0GZXqg

We hit Fuku during the impromptu Pimpin' Street Party about 2 weeks ago and all I can say is ""mamzatsoodood."" I think that was, ""Oh man, that's soooo good..."" Or something equally appreciative of my mouth being full of a Naga Dog at that exact moment.

Spicy and sweet - my favorite - the dog itself was spicy (you could choose a milder weiner, but I opted to go full tilt into this experience), then topped with a wasabi aioli, roasted kimchee (wow!), peppers and spices, and a sprinkling of crunchy nori. I know I am probably missing something in the description but it all boils down to this: amazing freaking hot dog.

If you are like me and avoid bread and breadly-type items, ask for it protein-style. They'll plate it on a broad lettuce leaf to help you pick it up and eat it. The lettuce helps, trust me, and adds a bit of crunch without taking away from the flavors of the food they're serving... plus, it's a food truck, folks; no silverware should be allowed, even the plastic kind.

A friend of mine ordered the same thing I did (but opted for the bun) and said much of the same mouth-full-gibberish I did. I don't think I have seen two people shove wein.... err... eat hot dogs so fast in my life.

I love the posh burger boutiques that we got in town but man, there is something about eating a juicy burger in a parking lot on a bucket. Never mind the LED lighting, fancy plates and ambiance of the other place; you ind Fuku purely for the food; th way it should be. AND lets not forget the thrill of the case of stalking these guys down.. 

My fave is the karai (spicy) burger with an extra side of crack sauce and garlic fries.  The burger is more of a sweet and spicy thing versus fire on a bun. Chase your food down with a tip jelly (if you tipped the crew). 

Find Fuku and you'll find happiness.

Burgers are the bomb. However, out of the two we purchased one was very raw and undercooked. This made me sad because the that was cooked was soooo freaking delicious.

Great Staff. Nice to look at.

Definately will go back.

5918501,2011-05-29,5,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"I think my luck with Fukuburger is all negative or neutral at best.  Way back on July 1 (pre-grand opening) when I was following them on their blog and went to a Chinatown location at 8pm, where they said they will show up, but ended up being a no show after 60-90 minutes.  Then I waited in a line at one of the food truck rallies, thinking it was for Fukuburger, but the long line snaked its way to Slidin' Thru, and I ended up missing that opportunity.

Anyway, finally thought my luck has turned when I was the second order placed at the Ellis Island sponsored Food Truck Smash-Up event.  When I received my burgers (#3 Buta-Burger & #5 Karai) I was pretty excited.  Finally a short line and short wait for this elusive and much loved burger, I thought.  Quickly navigating my way to a table in the shades, I took two pictures and attacked the burgers.  When I picked it up, I noticed that it was pretty greasy, to the point that almost 1/3 of the bun was soggy from the puddle of Fuku Patty grease.  As burgers goes, I was thinking this was no better than the cheap and greasy burgers served at hole-in-the-wall bowling alleys, and all the people that love and rave about Fukuburger must be on crack.

At this point it would be a 1 star review.  But then I see the burgers that others ordered and I did not see the grease soaked buns or the puddle of melted fat in the paper trays, and realized that the food truck gods have dissed me again!

Knowing that they can make and serve better burgers, I will give them one more try, but if the consistency is again on the negative side then that will be that + a down grade to 1 star for serving subpar food and lack of proper QA.

1 star for the food + 1 more star because I know they can serve better ones than the ones I received for popping my Fukuburger cherry.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,10,5,2,JQz48i3Ln2OCvOAimXL6jw

I've heard nothing but amazing things about this place so I was pretty excited to try it last friday when they had the truck parked outside of Vanguard downtown. I waited about 10 minutes on the line to order. 15 minutes waiting for the food. So it was a 25-30 minute wait to get the food and to me, it was not worth it at all.

1st off- I made my order totally clear. I repeated myself about 3 times that I would like 2 #3's (Buta-Burgers) both with just cheese,ketchup and bacon and add an egg to one of them and fries. Again... - 2 bacon cheeseburgers plain with no sauce or onions or anything, one with an egg- i'll pay extra for the egg. And also one order of fries. When I got my order, of course, there were 3 burgers, 2 plain bacon cheeseburgers and the egg burger. Grrr. Hate that!!
 
These burgers were the most average burgers I've had in my life. Honestly, they seemed like they were frozen patties with like soy sauce or something on them. I'll give them that their fries were pretty good and so was their chili mayo.

The only way I would ever get food from them again was if I was starving, there was no line, and it was the only thing in front of me at that moment.",e9wfoS-pYUNrloa6VZBgNw,8,0,2,Day4qUcA8IXjCJUBgLlrRg

And I mean that. If you haven't experienced fukuburger then you are missing out. Everything about them is good. They have a 6 burger menu, but if you're a bacon-head like me then the pork burger is obviously your favorite. But whatever you try, you'll definately love. They have non burgers too, they have jazz fries and hot dogs too
One thing that makes them stand out alot is their customer service and involvement in the community. They're always part of events like westside Wednesday and G3. What's also great is that at events they also will make a special burger like the Ronald McFuku.Of all the food trucks in Vegas they're also quite possibly the most involved and active on social media.  The two owners are also some of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. Colin and mags are very responsive and do whatever they can to make sure everyone has a great experience. 
If you come here, I guarantee you'll leave as a fan. In fact they're so good I have a friend who doesn't eat burgers but she makes an exception for fuku. That's how we roll",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,3,2,5,QQQEw63iKvza5JaYGUlJRQ

5959445,2010-12-12,4,ydcNlRMKs93AQpOhVkSrGQ,"Another successful (yet tipsy) trip to Fuku Burger. I just can't get enough of this place it seems. This time I was in the mood for spicy and boy did I hit the jackpot with the Karai Burger. My guy got the Tamago, which I had previously gotten. Both were delicious! I had been interested in trying the Green Curry fries, but it was not meant to be this time. 

Can't wait for my next trip, yum! Think I'm going for the Naga Dog!",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,5,5,rgxMRY1OHxkUT-biz33A8g
