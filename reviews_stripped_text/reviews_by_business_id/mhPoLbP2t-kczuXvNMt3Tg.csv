509022,2017-03-28,0,mhPoLbP2t-kczuXvNMt3Tg,This has to be one of the worst subways I've been to. Ordered a chopped buffalo chicken salad and got about half the meat and half the vegetables that it normally comes with. I will absolutely never go to this subway again! I should have read the reviews before I went and I would have gone somewhere else.,crXW6VhrMMXbZ_1jelqjyg,0,0,1,mX08JWWD3asUwLMJSFDiZg

919226,2016-12-03,0,mhPoLbP2t-kczuXvNMt3Tg,"I ordered a Reuben because it was on the website as a promotion and sent my order with my b/f who was doing the food run. Just wanted what was advertised, no frills. They gave me a random turkey sandwich with all kinds of weird toppings, not even close to a Reuben.  I called them and told them they gave me the wrong sandwich and that I was going to bring it back, so could I get the correct sandwich. They told me on the phone they couldn't make a new sandwich for me until the next day when their manager was in. (????) Really? You made a completely wrong sandwich and won't even take responsibility for it not even being close to what was advertised, incorrect meet, veggies AND bread, and if I bring in the actual sandwich WITH a receipt that said a REUBEN and the sandwich is NOT a Reuben, they still can't make me the correct sandwich until a day later?  I'm really supposed to bring in a day old sandwich to get the right one made in a day? This is ridiculous!",9smBOjHwHFQP_2K-NBe5bg,0,0,1,Xu_9j0EDLAJHNn-8jHGICQ

2253706,2017-06-22,2,mhPoLbP2t-kczuXvNMt3Tg,"Man, after being disappointed with the previous place I went to get dinner I decided to come to Subway. Always get the footlong Tuna with pickles, olives, extra onions and an extra scoop of Tuna. Now I'm all for portion control and saving on food cost but and this is a huge but when I order and extra scoop of Tuna and tell the young man I'll pay for the extra onions he tells me there isn't a button for that.. literally 6 olive slices, 5 pieces of pickles, and no onions. Yes I watched him make it - only reason I paid was because i wasn't in the mood to argue. Never coming back to this subway. I fact I'll go hungry rather then coming back to this place. 

If your guest is willing to pay.. load that shit up! Look at the picture and tell me this is an okay portion size for toppings. Tell me this is an acceptable sandwich.

I enjoy the new $5 footlong promotion with breakfast, lunch and dinner sub specials. 

Thanks for making the tuna mix just a tad bit on the creamy side, that really makes a difference.",r5ggPC6OccLk6dDl5yqsJQ,0,0,5,vaRMSEynqs3q2XuFpQXpZw

2971691,2014-08-09,0,mhPoLbP2t-kczuXvNMt3Tg,"Ok, it's subway.... I love subway. This review is about the staff that was working Friday, August 8th around 5:30. A friend went in to get me the sub with simple but specific directions. Veggie sub on a flat bread, don't let them warm up the flatbread ! 
How good do u think it would taste to put cold veggies on warm bread ? It's disgusting & makes the veggies slimy. 
Unfortunately The staff insisted they HAD to warm it up, after repeatedly being asked not to. Then sent him off with a footlong sub with nearly no soggy (from the warm bread) veggies. This is my fav thing & it was so bad I couldn't eat it & it had to be thrown out.... I work I'm the service industry & normally empathize with the staff, not this time.",ukyuz1LqQqnm7qEcGXv4Jw,0,0,1,0FOdTV-zz43qxQTYr11XAg

TWICE I have been to this location and the service is MIND blowing how slow it is!
I was there on Sunday June 5th around 4:30... The ladies before me
We're ordering ONE sandwich and the lady working was BEYOND slow. 
I don't mind having to wait, but 10 minutes for ONE sandwich? What?!? No...

I finally stormed out with no food, I was in a rush to go to work and didn't have time to wait 20 more minutes for the lady to ring up the sandwich. 

This happened the last time I went to this location too. 
I will NEVER be back.
You need to teach your staff a small sense of urgency. Some of us are in a rush, that's why we're going to a FAST food place.",WZojlBpeuNhNew_EjB7GLA,3,0,1,7rnSZJyXQI0Hpa3R5i-8ig

She was so fun and helpful and seemed like she enjoyed being there and making the sandwiches. She referred to herself as a 'sandwich artist' and she was just that. There must be at least 6-7 Subway locations closer than this for me, but this will be my usual spot, but only when Ashley is working, she is just so damn fun. Her fantastic personality was a nice change from some of the other Subways where they just don't seem like they want to be there.",4r85XVB6Il0OEf3yzQO0BQ,1,0,5,9-F_e7Jylozo9_HkeriE0A

4948779,2018-02-15,0,mhPoLbP2t-kczuXvNMt3Tg,I eat low carb so subway is a quick and easy lunch for me to grab. Normally I enjoy their salads but do not go here if that is what you are looking for. First off salads are a dollar more than sandwiches so we should be able to get more veggies since we're not getting bread. Well that is not how this place works. Their salads are small. They don't even fill the bowl up. It was more like a side salad than a meal. I was dinning in so I asked for a water cup. They said they were out of water cups and refused to give me a different cup to use. Needless to say I will never return to this subway!,iiskVzPR_UtXLJL1LOc6FQ,0,0,1,aXcgxJSSE2V_sO6U8XfyXg

They dont mind requests as in Extra Sauce and whatnot. Though the microwave was down which was a bummer because i like it to be microwaved and not toasted but oh well.

5849019,2013-06-13,7,mhPoLbP2t-kczuXvNMt3Tg,"Yep it's Subway with subs made your way with your choice of bread which now includes flat bread that is really good.

My hubby took me here for lunch one day while we were out and about running errands around town. He decided to try a flat bread sandwich and let me tell you the bread is fresh and delicious! I think I will try my sandwich on the flat bread next time because that was a real winner!

I usually get the meatball marinara, spicy Italian or veggie delight depending on my mood.

The subs are standard at each Subway, what makes your experience good or bad, hit or miss really depends on the employee behind the counter at the time. There is no real consistency as some employees are more generous then others with the toppings.

It is annoying to have to ask them to add more lettuce or tomato to your sub which is necessary when you can barely see it on your sandwich. On this visit I had to ask for more of everything including purple onion as I kid you not she put 3 little pieces on my FOOT LONG!

I don't know why we continue to visit this location as the service sucks sour balls!. It is the same lady who looks at you as if she has more important duties to do like mop the floors. Which while we dined she was sweeping by our table at our feet. That is a pet peeve of mine, sweeping while I am eating. We were the only damn people in there at the time, she could have waited until we were gone. Well as I have come to realize in life not everyone has common sense.

This particular female employee is consistent in her personality I have to say, she looks and talks as if she is giving a speech at a funeral. She has been there every time we have gone I swear she must be the only employee there. This was our last visit for sure, she just confirmed and made that decision for us. 

Anyhow, there are lots of Subways around town so it will be easy to pass this one up along the way.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,7,5,2,aa5dF_0r-7EgCMFjgtJ32Q
