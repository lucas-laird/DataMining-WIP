I love happy-hour and the half-priced drinks that come between those heavenly hours of 2-5pm.....the problem is, their service and quality of food has gone down over the last few months. Today, I spent almost 20 minutes in the drive-through, and there were only 3 cars ahead of me. At the ordering microphone (is that what it's called?) I had to repeat myself 3 times before they got my order correct. At the window, I had to wait quite a while (around 10 minutes). I'm pretty sure the guy behind me gave me the finger (sorry buddy! not my fault). Upon coming home, I found that the onion rings I received were soggy, and the cheeseburger I ordered lacked that ever-so-wonderful cheese. I had ordered several drinks (for me, the wife, and 2 of the kids), and they had to ""remake"" the drinks because the first set was leaking all over the drink carrier. 

Look. I am not a negative person, I even feel a little bad about the 3 star rating, but this experience was just one of several bad visits over the last few months.

It's not worth the frustration.  I doubt anyone is going to yelp sonic before they go, but there's no use in voicing my concerns to the teenagers that run the place because there is a new set every time we go.  We've gone 4 times in the last 6-8 months and EVERY TIME the order was wrong.  And while the order was large (4 meals, slushy drinks and a family appetizer, total over $40) it wasn't complicated at all.  The only special request was no cheese on the bacon burger.  Just no cheese, that's it.  And yet it's wrong every time.  EVERY TIME.  The first two times I didn't check before leaving and I ended up with nothing to eat when i got home because they forgot my meal (which I paid for) the second two times, they again forgot something that we paid for or put cheese on the freaking burger and we had to pull forward and wait for it to be corrected while the rest of the $40 worth of food we bought got cold. I've considered parking and trying to order from there, in hopes that they would get it right but the drive through line goes through the middle of where you park to order and if the line is long there is no way to get out.  I love slushy ice and when the weather hits 110 degrees again, I may be tempted to try sonic again, but as of now I'm not going back.  :(",1JKplxJ60JIuBUCxE9KEbw,0,0,1,jCRIfuBdwUvUZ7JvLol3XA

Todays visit really annoyed me.

I was in the drive-thru and the first guy who helped me was nice but for whatever reason, some idiot decides to come ask me if we needed ketchup or any sauce. Of course, I tell him yes and he disappears.
Guy #1 come back and gives us our food and we leave. As were leaving, I checked the bag and noticed that there was no ketchup or anything in the bag. Cool, now I have to waste more time because this idiot decided to pop into my order and then decides to not even do the ONE thing he was supposed to do? Annoying.

I have been obsessing over serendipity's peanut butter frozen hot chocolate, but that place is so far, and I can buy 6 of these for the price of one of those. Given, the frozen hot chocolate is different, and better quality, but we're talking every day fast food eats here. 

Once, I told my husband to ""surprise me"" with my shake flavor. That is a no go ladies. Don't do it. He promised me something chocolately and delicious, he ended buying me strawberry banana (thumbs down). The oreo cheesecake is decadent and delicious and we've also tried the banana cream pie. Seriously though, husbands, if your wife is going to splurge the calories of drinking a shake, the calories for a ""fruity"" flavor vs. a decadent one will be similar.

To be honest I haven't eaten in a Sonic in forever. So parking at one of their little ordering machines I got out of my car and was about to walk in because I didn't know if I could order food to go while parked at one of their ordering machines. Also I'm sure there is a better name then ""ordering machine""...maybe ordering station, vending space???? I'm sure if you've ever been to one you know what I'm referring to.

Anyway a young lady comes outside to tell me how a Sonic works. I could order from a machine outside to eat at one of their tables, or I could eat in my car while parked at one of their ordering stations, or they actually have a drive through.  I'm sure she must have wondered what was up with the ""old guy"" who didn't know how a fast food joint worked. Anyway she was kind and polite and did her best not to make me feel like a absent minded ""old guy""

Weighing my options I decided to use their drive through. I ordered a couple hot dogs. One mustard only and a Chicago style dog. A order of tater tots and a number 1 which is just a classic burger, fries and a drink.

As is typical for a fast food joint it was staffed with a very young group of people. What was not typical for a fast food joint is they actually got my order right.

Food was actually pretty good for a fast food joint. I'm sure when I feel like abusing my body with fast food I'll visit this place again.",tL2pS5UOmN6aAOi3Z-qFGg,1,1,4,yLxftXAm7dOCnXkzDVcUHw

The first time I ordered a large banana cream pie shake.  The lady taking orders repeats you wanna ketchup pie? To keep things short I had to repeat myself 3 times before she understood me.  When I finally get my shake all of the ingredients are at the very bottom of the cup and nothing but 6 inches of vanilla ice cream on top of it. Fast forward to the second night I tried to order a chili cheese Coney and a 44 ounce ocean water had to repeat myself again three times before she understood my order twice she replies we have no ice for the ocean water is that OK?  I'm no it's not that's the whole reason I came here for a cold drink in Las Vegas.

Apparently extremely difficult because this is the 3rd time I've ordered a simple drink and had it come out without a simple ingredient-

5821679,2009-01-21,0,RqpL5Y50F9exjyHfpTzp3w,"I LOVE THE TOTS and the CHERRY LIMEADE!!! But that's about it. If I want a hamburger, I'd go somewhere else. If I want a dessert, I'd still go somewhere else. However, if I want TOTS or CHERRY LIMEADE, Sonic's the spot and it's pretty cool that the drive-in is open 24 hours. 

Because of the commercials running nationwide, but locations are not, you got to try it for yourself. I like it enough not to scare people away.",xA_upwVTOVtXkS0NGISGng,0,0,3,XYn3fJtlDfZHqf5XI9mJ9A
5883509,2016-06-19,1,RqpL5Y50F9exjyHfpTzp3w,"I am a big fan of the slush drinks. I will get one of them at least twice a week. While I am not a big fan of the hotdogs, the burger and breakfast food is pretty good. I also always get the tots with my food over the traditional fries. I also never had to really wait for my food. They seem to be pretty fast with orders no matter what time of day or length of the lines. 

Tip: Always check for deals of the day. They have half price burgers and special price drinks during certain times of day/week. Some of the slush deals are amazing.",osQ4bMibJLmMPAtovvEkJw,1,1,4,iuQUe2x5FQgxWkiUyRsPOQ
5888594,2015-06-30,0,RqpL5Y50F9exjyHfpTzp3w,Came here today at 6/29/15 around 6:05ish. The young man who took my order at parking space 17 and the young man Nick who delivered it were very nice and friendly. My order was perfect. They had excellent customer service and the people who filled the order did so in a timely manner.,6B3gj6pogiajmPNiO7k3LA,0,0,5,wryyD6so9FtxRWhH_-GVUQ

When we finally got to the window, our order was messed up. I got a chocolate brownie shake and specifically asked for no caramel. He looked at it and went ""oh, I thought you meant all caramel no brownie."" Then our food came out and he said that all we had to wait for was my shake. After I received my shake, we went to park to eat at the tables. Once my boyfriend took our his bacon cheeseburger, they forgot to put in the BACON! Kind of ironic to order a bacon burger with no bacon, LOL! They also forgot to give me extra marinara sauce when I specifically asked for it for my mozzarella sticks. We had to push the button again and order them. A couple mistakes can go a loooong way, sonic.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,0,0,1,_4G2SHxMEYsRgONacykM9w

Fast forward to today.   Went in and got the order replaced and a few other things.   They messed it up again and the other items werw just not good quality.  Last time I'll give this place a try.,aDiizZZrtnSlMIqEDAWRTA,1,0,1,Rg9U_X0owRpByQZDxEcCJQ

Super simple - small tator tot and small jumbo popcorn chicken. She couldn't grasp that I wanted a SMALL jumbo popcorn chicken and small tot.
