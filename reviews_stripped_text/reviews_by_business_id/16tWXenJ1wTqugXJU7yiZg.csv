317,2012-06-24,0,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"Decent place to go, only reason I give it five stars is because of the prices.  During happy hour, rolls as low as 2.75, I had three and found myself full.

Taste, like any other sushi place.

I subtracted a star for the attitude I received from the servers.  One however was extremely nice and made sure my cups were always full.

We walk in, I wanted to sit in the back, and the woman who seated us had us sit where an employee was eating and kicked her out of the seat...right in front of us.  I felt extremely uncomfortable and felt bad.  Then as we sit down, a man came out and said something to the waitress and looked at us and said, ""You took my table.""  I almost wanted to walk right then and there and say, ""Oh okay, here is your table, we'll go where they welcome their fucking customers.""  ...but didn't.  I told the woman, that we could sit at the table next to us and not have anyone moved or their table ""taken"".  Her response? ""We need that for the bigger parties.""  That table remained unoccupied the entire time we were there.

If their prices weren't cheep and the sushi wasn't decent I wouldn't have been back. :/",Rr4nRgrl3JVJPdDSz4__PA,0,0,3,S0ureIixZBkhCvbrtntGdQ
17200,2010-04-03,0,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,I visited 808 Sushi for lunch last week becuase of the recommendation from my students. I was teaching Excel at the client site just down the street from 808 Sushi. My experience was excellent. The service was prompt and friendly. The environment is clean and nice decor. I ordered the sushi buffet. Every item I ordered was very good. I plan to revisit 808 Sushi in the near future.,mF_OoH1enCcaf3sZM0m_yg,1,1,5,yQ2m-RhbD5g3ZTBDMhjO6A

They also have the usual AYCE lunch and dinner, but your best bet is that happy hour... half off all sushi and $1 hot sake (M-F 3-6:30pm and Fri/Sat nights from 9-11).  Atmosphere is decent, basically just a bunch of tables in a large room with some flat screens (definitely wish they had booths).  Service is great, and they do takeout.  Favs include the 808 special (soft shell crab topped with spicy tuna) and the 007 roll (cali roll topped with shrimp, avocado, and eel sauce).

My bf and I went here on a Friday night (7ish), it wasn't busy at all so I was glad since I hate waiting when I'm really really hungry. We did the AYCE for 24.95 per person. Did I mention I LOVE AYCE? Totally worth it if you want to order a lot.

111085,2012-06-23,0,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"WORST experience here last night. 
FISH IS NOT FRESH!  

Place was not crowded, but service was real slow and disorganized for some reason. They kept bringing others' orders to our table. Waitresses were not very knowledgeable about their sauces or dishes. I found the servers to be sub-par in their menu knowledge and friendly attitude.  

Ordered sushi, nothing special. Our miso salmon kama tasted FISHY AND OLD, which ended up making me nausious so when we told our server about the taste, she shrugged us off. Later when we asked again, she said there should be nothing wrong with the taste because they got them in 'yesterday'. That was it. I couldn't bring myself to eat anymore. 

WILL NOT BE BACK!!!!  I'm not happy at all with the way we were treated tonight.  Save your money and eat at a sushi bar that gives good service.

Other favorites: Gator Roll (spicy soft shell crab, avocado/deep fried unagi, eel sauce), Dragon Roll (tempura, crab, avocado/unagi, eel sauce), and the Mexican Roll (if you like it spicy!)  The salmon katsu, cucumber salad, ahi poke, and garlic chicken are great starters.

173664,2010-11-29,2,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"it's 8pm Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend and there's major traffic back to LA. I wanted to take out the bday boy (Kurt F.) and the 4 bedroom party house provider (Dan Y). Might as well eat before we go...sushi craving, iPhone, yelp, filter for open now = 808 Sushi, 4 stars, sure why not?

This place was pretty easy to find, in a little strip mall in the southwest part of Las Vegas, far from the strip. Wasn't too busy and the 3 of us were able to get a table for 6, and trust me, we needed it. Sat around wondering if we should do the AYCE for $24.95, it's hard to get full on sushi for less than $50/person so the choice was easy. You can order a la carte but you'll end up spending way more (i'll get to that).

Our waitress Val was the sweet, innocent type that still has her Hawaiian accent. She was very attentive as were the rest of the servers with refills as well as additional orders. Tip: the * on the menu means you can only one per person, so it stands to reason these are the more expensive items. Didn't realize that til the end and by then we missed out ordering a few things.

Ordering is simple, the front page has mini portions of appetizers/entrees and the 2nd page has rolls, nigiri, and dessert

Here's what we had:

(#) is the number of orders

I took photos of almost everything we ordered, I'll do my best to upload them

Ahi Poke-excellent, not much other than a little sauce/ponzu/sesame seeds

(2) Agedashi Tofu-pretty standard

Cold Tofu-it's just tofu, good palate cleanser

Edamame-standard

(4) Garlic Chicken-this was good but I didn't like the sweet sauce it was cooked in and also drizzled, I ordered one with sauce on the side but it wasn't the same, Kurt F loved the sauce and drenched his chicken in it, to each his own...

Miso Black Cod-this was excellent, wasn't planning on ordering it but we did during last call and I was sad when it was so good and I couldn't get more. Had a very buttery flavor but the chef said that taste was from the miso glaze and sake

(2) Pork Gyoza-standard

Seared Poke-not a fan, I like seared tuna but for some reason the raw poke was better

Rolls: I think rolls in general have too many dif flavors so I shy away from them

Philadelphia-standard

Philadelphia Deep Fried-standard

Salmon Skin-mediocre/standard

Spider-didn't try but heard it was good, a little heavy on the rice but it's AYCE, just order another!

Alii-I was intrigued by the wasabi lime mayo but it overpowered the sushi, which might have been the point seeing as how it was deep fried white fish (mediocre

Haleakala-Kurt F liked the scallops, he stabbed my hand as I was trying to take a picture

Hawaiian Style-this one was really good, would definitely order this again

Nigiri: in addition to the appetizers, this is mainly what i ate

(4) Albacore-excellent
(4) Garlic Tuna-excellent
(2) Hamachi (Yellowtail)-wasn't fresh enough for my tastes
(4) Hirame (Halibut)-has always been one of my faves, didn't disappoint

Dessert: (you can only order one per person)

Banzai Special-excellent, best of all the dif choices
Scoop of Green Tea Ice Cream-Dan Y thought it was too cold. but hey, it's ice cream!
Scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream

Kurt F. is Jewish and i'm Chinese so on our way home we calculated how much we would have spent. The bill including tax/tip was $103, if we had ordered a la carte, $287. We win! It would have been more but Dan Y didn't hold up his end of the bargain to stuff himself. 

I'm fairly certain that Val was tired of running back and forth getting us all this food but she was awesome. Good experience, next time we're staying off strip I'll be going here for AYCE and this time, I'll order the Miso Black Cod first!",gVsKrUmI2DF_CF0U3APqjQ,1,0,5,FSfB0NJjAnSB_ragl2K1Bw

The service is usually good as well, since it is a small place you have to expect that though.  There isn't really anything that jumps out at me though and that's why I have to give it 3 stars.

324827,2010-12-13,1,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"Very good AYCE sushi.
The owner owned a sushi franchise in Hawaii, so he understand the standards of good food.

Highlights:
- Spicy tuna roll, the REAL version, with Japanese mayo chili pepper mix. If you never tried this real authentic version of spicy tuna (the fake looks bright red from schiracha sauce) then you won't know WHAT you should be craving!
-Hamachi collar. Ask any chef, she/he knows the best part of a fish is the collar (except for toro). The fatty flavorful meat seared crispy on the outside but soft and wonderful on the inside, just like me!
-Miso Cod, soft buttery with mild miso sauce. I like this much better than the traditional miso butterfish which has more shoyu in it. This version is much more delicate.
-Salmon collar, which has an intense amount of fat in the meat. Was pure inddulgence.
-The nigiri - uni, unagi, hamachi, and halibut were all of quality standards.

During the ending though I felt I was overloaded with msg, I think due to the natural fattiness and saltiness of the Hamachi collar, Miso, and salmon collar. Bad move eating all three in one sitting but had to try since it was my first time here. Next time I'll limit myself from indulging in all three.

If they had baked clams with the crusty mayo sauce on top, it would be perfection!

Went on a Wednesday, 2 large groups came in, luckily, when we were nearing the end of our dining experience. This place gets crowded, and for a good reason!",rc_8FQT2jeXoo6B_AfrbpQ,3,2,4,-4ThaFqRbxx9Kda0QMw46A

The tuna and salmon collar is... is... sooooo good. If you've never had fish collar, you've been missing out. And unlike some other places that do AYCE, they don't try to fill you up with rice.

Here's a couple of dishes that stood out: Miso black cod, miso salmon kama, hamachi kama, fried octopus, and poke. And don't forget to order banzai special for dessert.",TA5eFlXupTzQHEtqmy_akA,0,0,5,Cn3f2GRvOk33xYnDreB2iw

678222,2013-05-02,1,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"My husband and I have been regulars here and up until recently our experience was positive. 

Recently they have had new policies I feel are un necessary, especially if the place is not busy. Once we were told we could not be seated until the whole party had arrived, meanwhile the restaurant had one other table. I could understand that if it was busy and we would be holding up a table for a big party. We were only a party of 4. 

They also made an issue when we had asked for separate checks. Our server said it was fine but when we received the check it was not separated and they had added taxes as well as 18% gratuity with NO breakdown. When we had asked to at least explain to us the taxes and tip the server then passed us off to another server who was extremely rude despite us being polite about the matter. She then passed us off to the manager and made it very evident she was upset. 

The manager explained again it was their new policy but could do us a favor since they were not busy. We then asked if they expect each party over 5 to have one person take care of the check? Should we have to split our parties to different tables just so we could each pay our own check? It is one thing to not split our check however to make an issue of the way we are paying is just ridiculous. 

Lastly, as we left no one even said good bye as they normally do. 

Our family frequented this place at least once a week and I can say we will NEVER go here again.",fBC9LxkrEKYxZFxW5DAfyQ,6,1,1,_nXjQHmAHnjuwlK6XAdtHQ

Imagine stepping out of your car on a cold night and inhaling the delicious smell of Asian food.  In the same parking lot and actually the same corner there are Thai, Hawaiian, Japanese-Hawaiian, and Chinese restaurants. And it smells like... well damn, it smells like freakin' heaven.

I got the combo plate (11.95) with Kalbi Beef.  It comes with rice, miso soup, salad and edamame.  Miso soup seemed like it was missing something and I longed for tha Hanaoka miso soup.  The edamame also seemed a little flat and over cooked.

But wait, there's more.  The kalbi was tender, smoky, and delicious.  It was a good portion size and there was enough for me to be ""busog"" and take some home with me (which I'll enjoy as I write and watch football tomorrow).  It tasted like party food.  If I closed my eyes I could imagine my family there being loud and kids running around.  Comfort food is definitely the key word when I think of this place.

BF had a B combo plate (13.95?) of chicken teriyaki and sashimi.  Not a fan of sashimi so I passed on that.  But once again, the charbroiled teriyaki did not disappoint.

Service was mostly good but we had a wait before they took our order (kind of strange too since another waitress wasn't busy, refilling things which should be done on their down time).

We were able to order a couple of items on the happy hour specials and they made a ""last call"" for orders.  We ordered some combinations and there was a *lot* of food, that we had plenty to take back (luckily we had a full kitchen at our resort so that worked out).  There was another patron there that was also visiting from Hawaii and he blew up balloon art for the kids.

The Hawaiian twist on the food was very good and made for some delicious combinations.  The sushi and sashimi was fresh.

As we rattled off our first set of orders were told they were out of Hamachi Kama ( both our fav)   Damn what a bummer.. We almost walked out but the hunger pangs in my belly told me to stay. Standouts on hot apps were the garlic chicken (very juicy) salmon collar and miso cod ( buttery and delicate) Unagi was very good but the tamago(egg custard) was terrible! The worst I ever had. The color was very off putting and I shouldn't have even tasted it. It was ice cold almost frozen! Eww.  My friend ordered a couple of fried rolls that were ok
Nothing special. The big problem was the service. Our waitress was completely unavailable to us! In 2 hours never once came to check on us. The night might've been a complete flop if not for the guy expediting the food. Super personable and funny. He even found one last hamachi and brought it to us to share. :) we ended the evening with dessert( u can only have 1 ) forgot the name but it's like a apple pie filled spring roll with vanilla ice cream whipped cream and chocolate sauce drizzle.

808 Sushi was another ""top rated"" AYCE sushi joints I've read about so my girlfriends and I decided to have dinner here after the gym and fyi as much as we wanted to do AYCE, we didn't go through with it since we worked out so hard haha. 

While looking through the menu, the server hands us the summer special menus which is pretty much their way of saying happy hour! happy!! yippeee! Man O man! There Garlic Chicken was the BOMB!!! Deep fried chicken dipped in garlic shoyu sauce. Every bite I took had so much flavor and juice. It was amazing. I've never tasted garlic chicken like that before. I would come to 808 sushi all the time and order just the Garlic Chicken and be satisfied. That goooood. The Ahi Poke and Cucumber salad was delightful. So glad it did not taste fishy. Yuck. I like how they add seaweed salad with the Ahi Poke on the bottom, not a bad pair. Now with the sushi, I've only tried the Kilauea roll, Hawaiian style roll, and salmon skin roll. It wasn't bad. Quality of the sushi and presentation was mediocre. Customer service was a little unorganized, but still attentive.

The appetizer selection is not quite as extensive as some other AYCE places, but they were all quite good.  I appreciated the three raw fish choices they had -- Ahi Poke, Seared Ahi Poke, and Seared Salmon Sashimi.  They were all prepared well.  Most places have more fried appetizers than anything, so this was a pleasant surprise.  A positive note is that the Ahi Poke is simply a bowl of fresh fish and is not layered with ""filler"" items, such as seaweed, cucumber, onions, etc.  Our server was efficient and friendly, although her knowledge of the menu items could definitely use some help.  Overall, I enjoyed the meal and would come back.  Oyshi Sushi, about a mile away, has a larger menu and the sushi and rolls are slightly better.  The only problem is that you will have to wait a while during peak hours and the last couple of times I went, the service was REALLY slow.",jodPtzKf6CrxxlubsFyyIQ,3,2,3,-76gjZnpVTUDoPiOBIH9lw

I go in to order to go food at 5pm.  There are 8 people in the restaurant dining, so not many people mind you.  I place my order with a girl who was really put out by my wanting to order to go food.  She places my order and tells me it will be 15 minutes.  Ok, that seems reasonable.  42 minutes later, still NO food.  2 people who ordered after me had their food come up.  When I inquired, the same girl seemed even more put out.  No apology, no offer to give me a soda or water while I wait for a lousey 3 sushi rolls.  Boy, obviously customer service is not a requirement at this place.  I get no answer except ""They said it will be up soon"".  Again, no apogy for the ridiculous delay and time needed to prepare it.  It finally comes up and she sends me on my way.  
I was agitated to say the least but I was hoping that the story might take a slight turn for the better when getting the food home and having my sick wife who I got it for to cheer her up be so amazing it would quench the sour taste of the 45 minute wait.  Well, not to be.  The sushi was average at best.  For all of you who have reviewed 808 as having amazing sushi, you need to get out more.  I have been to so many places with better food quality and certainly more friendly people.  
808, you need work.  A lot of work.  I am sorry I wont be back nor will I be sending anyone your way.  You had a shot to secure a life long sushi eater and lost it.

The restaurant is pretty small so when we arrived at 7pm on a Saturday night all the tables and sushi bar were full. We were behind a few people in line and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.

After being seated service was very quick and efficient. Their AYCE menu has a nice selection and variety of hot food and sushi. There seems to be more hot food on 808's AYCE menu than other places.

Some of my favorites:

-black miso cod
-udon
-speciality roll that had salmon, avocado and jalepeno

The food came out quickly and everything tasted really fresh. 

Minus one star for their scallop item not being baked and for it not being specified as such on the menu. There's no designation as to whether this menu item is raw or baked so I assumed that it would be similar to other scallop/mayo sushi items at other sushi restaurants in that it would be baked. Not so here. It didn't taste very good (texture of the raw scallop with mayo mixed in....blech).

We tried the 808, da kamikaze, black widow, and miso soup. All were delish! 
All 3 were quite tasty & we left full and satisfied.

1624164,2010-02-17,0,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"Decided to try this place based on another website & the fact that it was close to my work & I would definitely go back here again. We arrived around 12pm. There was only 1-2 other tables in the place but I think the fact that it's so new (open for 1 month) that no one yet knows about them. They do have an AYCE menu but since we were on a time constraint we opted to just get a couple of items of the menu. I do want to try their AYCE. Unfortunately they don't do 1/2 orders of AYCE like some places but I guess I will just have to take a few hungry friends so we can try many things & really get a feel for the menu. 

My guest ordered the Haleakala Roll which is a California Roll, Spicy Scallop, baked with eel sauce. He stated that it was very good. 

I ordered Unagi (which I was leery to do since I've had bad  experiences in the past at other locations but opted to go for it.) It was quite delicious. Cooled very well. Soft & not hard & rubbery. I also ordered the Spider Roll which is one of my favorite rolls. I figure that if a sushi place can make a good spider roll that I like then they are worth going to. Um - bad mistake. It was over cooked so it tasted burnt & flavored the whole roll wrong. I informed them of this right away (we were seated @ the bar) & they immediately made me a new one which was much better. I told them how the bad one tasted & they said that they purposely over cook it since people want their food over done. I don't think that's the real case - I think someone just got carried away @ the fryer. But due to the fact that they took immediate care of it & were concerned about our satisfaction - I would definitely go back again. I also ordered a Rainbow Roll as my dining mate wasn't that fond (or familiar) of nigiri based on a previous experience. I think we've all had that bad experience that causes us not to want to try something again. So I opted for the Rainbow Roll since it wasn't straight up Nigiri. He decided after the 5th & final piece that ""bait"" wasn't all that bad. I think (hope) that he will try it in the future.  

Ambiance was nice for a lunch crowd. A little chilly but I was sitting directly under the AC vent. The owner Dean (and rest of staff) was super nice, chatty & helpful. Dean even gave me a 20% off card for my next meal there. I inquired about lunch & happy hour specials & he said that they would be implemented soon. They will have happy hour every day of the week with 50% off some of their rolls, $1 sake, beer specials, etc. I will defiantly be going back for lunch (even with my so-so spider roll experience) as well as well as maybe even stopping off for a happy hour sometime & they didn't even have to throw in the complimentary Banzai Special.

They have many special rolls on their buffet menu and many appetizer items. My personal favorite is the Haleakala roll, baked to perfection. 

Their green tea ice cream does not taste like green tea very much so I recommend sticking to the store bought mochi or the other apple sundae they have.

I love that their theme is of the great 808 state!",4TJF62R5ytolOmiMWKtjGA,1,1,4,fkNOpeG1d9EoB2_OhqFiaw

My partner & I had one of those mornings where you're so busy you don't get time to eat, by 1:30pm I was starving & decided sushi was needed.

We ordered the AYCE lunch special, sat at the sushi bar & proceeded to get some of the fastest and most personable service imaginable.  The staff was fantastic, the food was delicious and I'm pretty sure we got more than our money's worth on the AYCE special!

We ordered:
Ahi Poke ($7.95) - Hawaiian style tuna over a bed of seaweed salad. This tasted amazing!
Garlic Chicken ($2.95) - Deep fried chicken dipped in garlic soy sauce. This was so moist on the inside and delicious!
Pork Gyoza ($2.95) - potstickers with ponzu sauce. This was okay.
Salmon Katsu ($4.25) - panko-crusted salmon with tonkatsu sauce. This was good.
Teriyaki Beef ($4.25) - grilled beef marinated in teriyaki sauce. This was delicious!  Gotta have this with rice!
Crunch Roll ($5.00) - shrimp tempura, avocado, cram/crunchies, eel sauce
Hawaiian Style Roll ($6.00) - spicy tuna, cucumber/albacore, poke sauce
Kilauea Roll ($7.00) - California roll/baked dynamite mix - this was awesome!
The Mexican Roll ($6.00) - shrimp tempura, spicy yellowtail, jalapeno, srichacha sauce

For dessert, we got the Banzai Special (5.95) - deep fried apple spring roll with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream with chocolate drizzle.

The fish was fresh, the food tasted awesome! We ate everything so fast. With tip, we paid about $17 per person, which isn't bad. We had all the food we needed to eat, so this was a better deal than the all you can eat price.  We'll definitely be back!",RIB4J2PDgOJnyEK-gXJrsg,4,0,5,H98jwjprXjRzGGXGWJ8gZg

When I asked why they could not answer me, the place was picking up I had been there for about 35 minutes so I looked on the menu to see if there was a time limit nothing on the menu. the staff had a ok attitude. But overall It cost me $29.14 for a small bowl of frozen Ahi, 2 tempura shrimp, 5 pieces of tempura veggies, and 3 1/2 rolls which I could have had off their happy hour menu for about $23.

He used to live in a Hawaii, so he was hoping that they'd have some poke (which they did).  Not only did they have what he wanted, but they had so many other tasty items to choose from and they had AYCE for just $24.95.  Since that day, we've been here more times than we can count and it has become our favorite sushi spot.

Whenever we go, we order some ahi poke, Da Kamikaze Roll (tempura, eel, spicy soft shell crab, and salmon with eel sauce), 808 Roll (spicy soft shell crab and tuna with spicy mayo and eel sauce), and Rainbow Roll.  He gets the Mango mochi for dessert and I always get their Bonzai Special (deep fried apple spring roll with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce).  Those are our favorites, but we've also tried the shrimp tempura, tako poke, hamachi kama, mochiko chicken, miso salmon kama, and a few of their other rolls.  We've yet to be disappointed.

I am not reviewing their AYCE sushi's because I've never had it there. 

Here's what we ordered:

Crunch roll
Kake Udon
Katsu Curry Don

I was craving some cooked sushi rolls and we wanted to go some place close to home. The crunch roll was just your typical cooked roll with shrimp tempura, nothing spectacular about it.
I also shared the kake udon with my son, since he only eats noodles. This had to be one of the worst udon noodles/broth I've ever tasted. I think the udon packets you buy from a grocery store taste much better than what we had.
My husband had the katsu curry don, he said it was ""meh"". I guess my homemade katsu curry don is much better. The portions of this dish was pretty big. 

Overall, we had a wonderful service from them (I give them 4 1/2 to 5 stars for their service and attentiveness but their food is only worth 1 star). I don't think we plan on coming here again.",1pKOc55fFx09J5t2rPzTxw,3,1,1,e31kwklt_mT5SOlKDk2iFw

1815165,2016-01-09,2,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"808 Sushi is an awesome place and the food is great. The service definitely SUCKS big time. The guys at the bar and in the kitchen are AWESOME. The women are bitches and always seem to be PMSING!

My family and I have been coming here for almost 2 years. None of them know our names. They are very rude and snappy. 

Our most recent visit on Tuesday 1/5/16 was the worst ever and has us looking for a new sushi place. The food was great as always and the guys in the kitchen/bar area are always very very nice. At the time we were there, there were two women working and one of them had just got there. She was telling the kitchen staff how sick she was as she hacked and coughed. Then she proceeded to interact with the customers coughing and sniffling ( just in case they didn't know they are violating health codes according to the health department where they got there health cards). When we went to pay and leave we noticed that the other woman was also sick, coughing and sniffling. My sister asked her if she was sick and the woman got really short and mean saying she had allergies. My sister responded saying well shouldn't you take some allergy medicine. All the woman said meanly is she had allergies. My sister once again said to her, this must be new because we have been coming here for quite awhile and never seen you having allergies. Then the woman messed up the checks and we tried to explain and correct it but, she wasn't having it either. They need some serious customer service training or they will lose more customers. Yeah the food is great but, if the service sucks like this they might as well shut there doors. The owner use to make his presence known but, not anymore so they act like there shit doesn't stink and like we should feel privileged to have them serving us. 

Well with all this said we will not be going back to 808 sushi!! They just lost 6 customers who spend between $50 to $100 each on there visit and usually would go 3 times a week. I am sure another sushi business will appreciate our business. I certainly don't think the owner ever reads these reviews but, I know people looking for great places with awesome service do. I totally recommend on passing on this place and find another!",CQM7p0181BuRQKEgphDavw,0,0,2,8YqCCdWM4AziK4znGnTdqg

I kept trying to give it another chance and it just isn't where I want to spend my money anymore for Sushi.  AYCE and Happy Hour Pricing has ruined the quality of the fish.  It's like they kept buying cheaper and cheaper ingredients.  I had a friend in town that wanted to go so we did and that's when I made up my mind that I wouldn't be coming back for sushi.  Since I gave up on the fish and sushi improving I would still visit occasionally just for the Teri-Beef. (they even changed the Beef Supplier for this)  Not even close to what you used to be 808.

We use to come about once a week or so, until all our waitresses were replaced with some new ones. Our once a week trips became more like once a month. Don't get me wrong,but if you're going to name your restaurant 808-please have some sense to have people with some aloha or people that can pronounce the Hawaiian terms that's on the menu. 
Nevertheless, we walk in tonight, excited to use our gift certificate that we got for Christmas, bring in some out of town family, and have the worst experience ever! What a shame 808 Sushi!!! Too our surprise, after a horrible customer service experience-waiting to get our orders about 3 times, hot tea not hot, and not even warm, waitresses clearing plates while we're in the process of eating off of them, water not refilled timely, reminding waitresses what we ordered, and then the most unbelievable experience ever.... Now we're ready to pay with our $200 gift certificate . Quickly, the waitress says, we can't do cash value and that the $200 will be forfeited. I'm appalled and state, ""We don't want cash back, we just want the remainder of our balance perhaps in another gift certificate?!"" She rushes to her manager on duty who took about 30 minutes to call the general manager 'Agnes' to tell us the same thing. Now, you have not only lost loyal customers, but this loyal customer has no problem sharing the stupidity of this restaurant. 
Why sell someone a $200 gift certificate when you have to use it all at once or loose it?!!!! No one has time for that $h*+!!! It's $26.95 per person  for AYCE. I don't have a family of 8 to use it all at once, or specify somewhere on that big card all the rules you just made up. This isn't a group on special, my Mother-in-law paid you $200 so we can enjoy this restaurant a few times!!! FYI, sell smaller increments, or warn the buyer of this rule-(waitress heard of 2 days ago), unless your intention was to rip someone off! Who does that???!!! Or do people a favor don't sell them at all, so no one else gets ripped off. Never stepping foot in this place again and in all honesty, I would rather drive the 30 minutes to Island Sushi where they have the EXACT menu with competent people that have 'ALOHA!'",xbP3ehNdAjokRFJtAdfgkw,8,3,1,FrjApBh1TcXyDxu8mm7KFQ

Don't go there with less than an hour left before they close because they will be sweeping, mopping, hurrying your order and stacking chairs around you.

The rolls on the last 3 visits I've had to send back because of how ""fishy"" they smelt and tasted.  Had many lunches and dinners here so it's a shame that it's been so bad on recent visits.

The service was notably improved over a year ago but still mediocre even with regular check-ups from the assistant manager.  Misses included: having to ask for set ups and soy ramekins, being served luke warm hot green tea (both rounds) and a waitress that keep disappearing for longer periods than comfortable.

Given the large number of places in Las Vegas to dine sushi with both better service and better fish - we'll be keeping 808 Sushi on the shelf.",3nVaTBpC-Rz0KIBreSN-CQ,1,0,3,xDRH33GYJ2TaCm5tn5RtlQ

You can get just about any roll and nigiri for as much as you can eat (although they do limit you on the uni and sweet shrimp). You can also get all the appetizers you can eat, many of which are really good - ahi poke, garlic chicken, etc. If you don't do AYCE, they do have happy hour and you can get $1 sake and half price rolls.

2277177,2010-06-25,0,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"my aunt and i were sitting around at home listening to our stomachs argue with each other while we were trying to figure out where to eat. we knew we wanted sushi but we didn't want to go to our usuals (kona grill, naked fish, momoyama). I remembered this place because one of my friends had suggested it. it's further from our house than the usuals but we were so hungry we decided to go.

when we got there (around 8pm), we were seated immediately as the dinner rush was already dying down. we were waiting on my mom to arrive but they were quick to get our drink order and ask if we wanted any soup, salad or edemame. my aunt didn't waste time and immediately ordered HAMACHI SASHIMI (9 pieces for $12!! that's the cheapest i've ever seen for that amount).

I had read a Yelp! review on the way to this restaurant and thought I'd try their famous 808 ROLL, but i saw they had HAMACHI KAMA (YELLOWTAIL COLLAR) which is one of my favorite Japanese dishes of all time and decided to try that first. As an appetizer for $6.75, I got BOTH collars.. aaaaaaamazing!! it was enough for my mom, aunt & i to share!! after we killed that, my mom decided to order some grilled white fish (i wish i could remember.. darn it!) and it was GOOOOOD! with that, i had no more room for the 808 roll (just dessert!)

Off to one corner of the restaurant is a little refrigerated pastry case. I walked over to see what they offered and the owner must have seen how big my eyes got at the sight of these WHITE CHANTILLY CHIFFON CUPCAKES and just handed it to me for me and my family to try. *heavennnnn* they were DELICIOUS! afterwards, my mom & aunt walked over to the case to see for themselves and the owner handed us ANOTHER pastry to try. this time, the little container it was in had a question mark. i asked what it was about and he said that the girl who bakes these pastries still hadn't come up with a name for them. from that he explained that the customers are the ones that come up with the names. there's a box on the counter for you to drop a slip into with what you think the pastry should be named. if your name wins, you win TWO AYCE dinners!! oh, i've never grabbed a pen and paper faster. the ""question mark"" pastry was another slice of heaven.. i won't share what name i gave but i think it's a winner ;]

this place if 4 STARS just because i haven't had a chance to try too many things on the menu yet (so far so GREAT!) and because the ""hot"" tea was just lukewarm and he offered us more lukewarm water to make it hotter hahah!

this place is going to be dangerous for me.. it's on the 215 (my commute to school) so i can see myself calling in take out orders every so often ;D with one visit.. i can already say i will be a regular ;D

We intended to just go in for a few rolls but then we realized they had AYCE so why not. The AYCE menu is a smaller than some other AYCE menus offered at some near by sushi restaurants but pretty comparable to the type of sushis. The sushi was pretty fresh and came out fairly quick, which is a plus because nobody likes to wait too long in between orders.

2332545,2012-10-03,1,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"For me 808 sushi has the best AYCE in town. Now I know there are so many AYCE and gosh knows everyone has their favorites. Personally the things that makes it stands out above the rest is the appetizers or pupu selection for one. They have things that cater too the 808 style like kalbi action, tonkatsu style pupu, and way they cook it all local style. The quality of the fish is top notch for me everything tastes fresh and looks awesome. The speciality rolls have nice diversity too them. I enjoy the spicy pele, dragon roll for me automatic, and LOTS LOTS of nigiri ones. 

The wait staff is very friendly and on top of it. I must admit that they forgot about one round (I went with roommate dinner bday celebration) but going four five rounds lot too write down. Lol! The only true thing pick at is if the place is busy (its hit or miss but sure weekends they do well) don't expect the sushi too come flying at like other AYCE sushi. They only have two sushi chef at most so full house been too might take time. Still think worth it plus you can relax more enjoy the pupus!

Portions are tiny and I am a very light eater, so imagine my husbands feelings about this matter - I think he's just insulted.  I've heard mixed reviews about the quality of food, I'll just say if you're doing AYCE then it's eh-okay for a strip mall kind of food joint, I've had okay and not so fresh tasting fish here.

2385129,2010-04-27,4,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"I was the only one doing AYCE and the rest of my girlfriends ordered ala carte. They were hawking the table to ensure that I don't share.  I am a respectful eater and I expect the same treatment as a customer. Don't hawk at me, I understand the rules and I will not share. Or perhaps they were staring because they could not believe the amount of food that I could eat all on my own?  Regardless, please don't stare and just serve my food.

It's better than bad.  The service was slow. I enjoyed that they have hamachi kama on the AYCE appetizers, which I love. The poke tuna was ok, it lacked flavor. Shrimp tempura was a little soggy and warm.  I did like the agadeshi tofu.  I liked the tako karaoge (deep fried octopus).

Nigiri sushi.....It was hard to decipher if the fish was fresh. They kept on putting sauce over the nigiri when I asked them not to. In order to taste the fish if it's fresh or rancid, eating in its rawest form is the best way to determine. I ordered the following twice...Yellowtail, white tuna, snapper, which all had sauce added to it. Masago and Ikura was a little salty but I kind of like it. The amaebi sweet shrimp was really good, but the deep fried shrimp head was hard and chewy. They never served my hokkigai (surf clam) and said they ran out of the Uni after waiting for 30 minutes....

The salmon skin hand roll was really good.  I wanted to order some special rolls because it looked really great from others. However, they don't let you order half orders rolls unless it is your last order.  These rules are weird to me and especially when they forget some of my items. 

One great thing about 808 Sushi is that it is right around the corner of my house and the convenience is fantastic. 

Would I come back here again? Yes, because I really want to push them to DO NOT add sauce to my Nigiri unless requested. I must review by the quality of the fish and next time...I want to try the special rolls and dine with other AYCE eaters!",Oz8Bp1NY-Szz4lvSbVsV4Q,3,3,3,7en9ysCyn1d-lb5BLM3-1A

This place makes it COMPLETELY possible to pop in for a correct sized portion of food that is so good it leaves you craving it long after you KNOW you have no more room in your tummy!

We always start off with the Poke appetizer $6.95 (or maybe it's $5.95)..EVERYTIME it has been to die for!  Granted I've never killed a fish and eaten it onsite, but this is as close as it will probably get for me!!

Next one of us will pick a roll at random-there is a great selection..most range from $4-7..pair that up with a couple $1 sakes and a beer and our night is perfect!  We usually get outta there for under $20-stuffed, happy and tipsy..hehe

Most recently we had the Maui Special roll..which is tempura shrimp, unagi, cream cheese, and cucumber drizzled with eel sauce.  I can't even express how delicious it was!!

It's not the first time we've been here as the food here is quite good and is quite evident by the fact that there is a half hour line waiting to be seated.

Unfortunately, while the food on the appetizer menu is quite tasty and their sushi is average, the service tonight was below average.  Our server was busy and as attentive as she could be, but the issues were rather with the items on the menu which were out of stock / not available.  While she informed us of both the hamachi kama and salmon kama being out, she failed to let us know that the uni (quite possibly one of the best items on the menu) was also unavailable as their vendor didn't have any in stock to deliver.  We found out about the lack of uni when she came by to ask what we would like for dessert as all of us were anticipating another plate of sushi to be delivered to the table.

Now let me explain...  I could have totally understood this if there was some mention made of this before or while we were putting in our initial order.  I could have even been okay with this (although disappointed) if this was mentioned in the middle of dinner.  Instead, my family waited in anticipation for a plate of uni nigiri and was instead greeted with the information at the near end of our meal.  Uni itself is sea urchin and is definitely not for everyone.  No matter where you order it, you will either love or hate it.  For some I think it's a consistency issue.  In the case of my family, we love it!  We have actually walked out of other sushi bars here in Las Vegas because they didn't have any.  Las Vegas has many sushi bars and almost limitless choices of great food.  

Over the past few years, we have actually followed the owner of this establishment from other places he has co-owned or worked at as the food has always been good.  Tonight when my father approached him about the lack of uni, he seemed dismissive and quite unapologetic to the point where my father was going to leave an 8 cent tip on the check to get his message across that perhaps in this economy that service and humility toward your customer can only get you ahead while the adverse will get you the opposite.  I left an additional $20 with the check (and my father's 8 cents).

The sushi here is okay.  I actually drive a cab and have been recommending this establishment whenever I'm asked in person or on the dispatch radio about a sushi bar.  The items on the appetizer list are awesome and I definitely recommend the Garlic Chicken and Tako Karaage.  Tonight was just an unfortunate experience and I definitely feel that the situation could have been handled differently.

WHAT: I came here to eat once with my friend. We were both first-timers so ofcourse we had to do AYCE!! The only things worth remembering was the service was great!! (Made me bump one up on my star rating)

The food, on another note, was good. The mochiko chicken appetizer was bombness!! I tried a couple of their specialty rolls, and I don't know if it was me, but they all started tasting the same!!

I may have to go back and eat there again to actually remember my likes and dislikes, but the only thing I can remember was that it was one of the okay sushi places I've tasted!

Oh!! One of the best things there was the Ahi Poke!!! If you love Ahi Poke as much as I do, then that definitely is a MUST! =D",udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w,18,17,4,lhF1cx7HI1MqhzhAKRPitg

Yelp'd it on my BlackBerry (the app for the curve is terrible by the way) and decided to try it.

The server was friendly and quick and attentive. plus plus and plus.

We ordered the Tako Karaage, Garlic Chicken, and Deep Fried philly.... to start ;)

The fried philly was pretty standard... one of our go - to rolls at all sushi places.  I was pretty disappointed with the Tako.  I understand that octopus is a bit rubbery... but I just had to try it. Maybe they had found a way to  fry it with our overcooking it....nope.

Garlic Chicken was super yummy.  My new favorite.  We love karaage.  The sauce that they dip this one is is delish.  Even our picky daughter ate it....and LIKED it!


My bf ordered a 2-item combo (Kal-bi and Chicken Katsu) that came with rice, miso soup and a salad....And dessert! mochi ice cream.... yum.

I ordered a small Chirashi...and I tried to order my daughter a side of Chicken Katsu but the nice server lady said, ""thats a LOT of food...the portions are pretty big"".  I took her word for it.... even though we're pretty big eaters ;) haha

She wasn't kidding.  We ended up with a ton of food... we finished it all.... but there was a lot of it. And it was all delicious.

Very small and intimate location, with attentive and friendly staff. Their happy hour simply cannot be beat. Pot stickers are crisp outside and juicy inside. Teriyaki beef was sweet and perfectly done. Seaweed salad was a very large portion for the price. My favorite was the garlic chicken though. They were done to perfection, which is not easy to do when you're talking about chicken pieces. It literally takes a minute to overcook them so you're left with garlic rubber. However, you also cannot undercook them or you're looking at some sick customers. These were so amazing; juicy but done with so much flavor even the garlic cannot overwhelm them. I could have eaten two plate fulls (which is pretty easy to do during happy hour).

Our male waiter, sucked. Our female waiter, was good. The guy made us feel like he was rushing us on our orders. He would roam by time to time and quickly say, I mean quickly, ""everything okay? Ok.."" Then walks away not even giving us one second to answer. The food/sushi was good, overall I guess. A little heavy on the sauces and the fish cut too thin compared to other competitors. All my niece who is 6yrs old wanted was a miso soup and he would not for the life of him, let it come from any of our all you can eat menu. (Every other sushi place let it slide)
Their appetizer portion of the AYCE menu isn't that great compared to other sushi joints. If the price was cheaper it would make more sense. 

If you're going to spend the same amount on AYCE sushi, DONT GO HERE! They are very uptight about every little thing. Sumo Sushi is literally a minute away and they're AYCE is the same price for much better quality food and way more choices.

For the dessert round, you only can have one item per person and every other sushi place you can get ice cream along with one more item. 

The menus are sticky and dirty. Not much to choose from either. Why make the AYCE the same price as other places when they don't even match up to other competitors levels? 

I'm from Hawaii and this place, like many others say, has NO ALOHA what so ever. I never write reviews so this is a first. It was so disappointing.

We sat at a table for 4. We ordered our food and my brothers' food who was to join us. Not too long after the food arrived my brother showed up along with our friend (unbeknownst to us). Naturally we all want to sit together, so, my husband grabs a chair from an empty table behind us for our friend. As soon as that happened the waitress rushes over to us and says that we can't do that so I told her ok than can we move to the table next to us that was a table for 6. And she tells us we can't do that either, she says in order to be sat together we would have to arrive together..WTH!!..mind you it just us and couple that was dining at the time. So, explain to me what the issue is here? My brother left along with our friend. Of course I'm confused of what just happened and wanted an explanation. To make a long story short she said it's Dean's policy (the owner) cuz there's been numerous complaints blah blah blah and that they are trying to figure out blah blah blah...really right now, save it, if you're still trying to figure $#!+ out on how to run things in the dining area than use your better judgment or your own discretion on on certain issues...like I said it was a slow day in the 808... 

btw...get your knives sharpened or somethin cuz there's gotta be something wrong when you pick up one sushi and the whole roll is still connected....sushi gone wrong! 

Yeah, such a shame to call such a place 808 when there's no ALOHA spirit or service!

3593569,2013-09-01,4,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"Never had a worse experience at any restaurant. The main thing that rattled my nerves was the service. I had recently moved into the neighborhood and had a late-night sushi craving, so I thought I would try this place out. When I walked in, I noticed right away that it looked like this place was being ran by a bunch of kids. Granted, the hostess/server didn't do anything wrong, they certainly weren't inviting. I sat myself at the sushi bar. 

After looking over the all you can eat menu, i told the waitress that i had decided to do that. They informed me that it was just a little passed 10pm and that last call was 10:30. I have been to a few all you can eat sushi places in Vegas around closing and understood the last call rule, but the way the said it to me made me feel like I was inconveniencing them. Let me first start by saying, the menu was very limited compared to other sushi establishments around the city! I was sitting (literally) right in front of the two sushi 'cooks.' Neither of them acknowledged me, but instead were speaking about some of the tables in the restaurant, making fun of them, and bad-talkng the hispanic cooks in the kitchen line behind them.

After about 5 minutes of just sitting there, the server came by and took my order. I was craving a baked roll--like a lasagna. They had one similar, so i ordered that, along with a couple others. Right when one of the cooks (bigger guy that seems to have been in charge) saw my order, he told me he couldnt make that roll because he was out of scallops. I know, for a fact, they didn't run out of scallops because I saw one of the prep cooks with them. For whatever reason, they just didn't want to deal with it. 

Anyhow, I ordered something in place of that roll. While waiting and observing these guys go back and forth about how they cant wait to get out and huffing and puffing every time someone ordered something else, I couldn't help but to think ""why am i spending money in this place?!"" I sat there for seriously just about 10min for two rolls. When I was finished with those, I was expecting my other to come up...waited for another 10 minutes before the 'cook' realized he forgot to start making it.

To shorten up this review a bit, I am gonna leave it at that. The service was awful and the food was crap. Please people, drive a little further and spend your money at Goyemon (or even Oyshi)! At least you know they appreciate your business, you'll get good service and the food is great (speaking of Goymeon).",MI4XFB0Z6Se8dI4Gne9nlA,10,1,1,QHM6kYu_fewhJBBXJhmc3g

3617659,2011-03-03,2,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"So if you know your area codes then you'll know that 808 is Hawaii. Now don't expect a ""irasshaimase"" when you come in because this is not a sushi spot that tries to pretend to be Japanese. Instead they're they give off a chilled islander feeling which is cool. 

808 Sushi are one of the few remaining sushi spots that still charge 24.95 for their dinner AYCE, sweet (I believe its 20.95 for lunch). I posted pictures of their AYCE menu and you'll notice they have a fairly decent hot menu item, some key items are the hamachi kama (yellowtail collar) and unlimited salmon collar. Most places limit you to only one salmon kama per person, but 808 lets you have all your can eat, but limit one for the yellowtail. The yellowtail kama smelled great, so I'm assuming some freshness from it, although the salmon kama did not give off such an impression.

I feel that the hot menu items are a better choice than the sushi because the quality of the sushi items were nothing special. I know that its AYCE so you can't expect high quality fish and craftmenship, but.. its weird the rice and cuts of the fish are all different sizes. I noticed the chef was relatively young, maybe less than 30? So I'm sure over time the execution will improve. The rolls were decent, but didn't really have much to distinguish one from another, and most of the rolls contain eel sauce. The fish wasn't the most fresh, but didn't taste like they've been in the freezer for too long. My green tea ice cream was in the freezer for too long though because the smoothness of the ice cream was attacked by ice.

The service was nice and prompt, there was not too much wait time in between each set of order, drinks were refilled promptly, and request were done in a timely fashion.

You can't really go wrong with cold beer, and a table full of sushi rolls, both of which are half price every Saturday afternoon apparently. I'm not sure how I ignored this deal in my own backyard for so long, but I'm sure I'll be taking advantage of it pretty regularly from now on.

We enjoyed the food. Nothing too complex or fancy, just tasty rolls prepared fresh. Because the price was so good, we order many different rolls. Too many, in fact, to remember the names of my favorites, but all were worthy of my time.

4006152,2010-03-30,0,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"I would definitely come back here in order to fill my sushi crave and hunger since it is real close by the boyfriends house in the Vegas Southwest.  Mind you, I have been a huge Sushi Mon fanatic since I discovered all you can eat sushi, so if you are going to open up an all you can eat joint, you gotta know your competition. 

This place actually bodes well for competition.   I give this place 3 stars.  

(1) For the price.  Good deal for all you can eat sushi for dinner.  Complete w/ sides, nigiri, and rolls.  
(2) For the friendly service. The waiters were nice, and the first round of orders came out pretty fast.  My boyfriend and I can scarf down the first order in less than a minute though, and the second round came 15 minutes later, which is way too long to wait.
(3) Variety.

It lacks the 4th star, because there should be a little bit more on the area of variety even though I did give it one star for this.  There are no baked rolls, or special sauces, or ""to die for"" type specialty rolls.  Everything tasted OK, but nothing came out at me to order a repeat time.  I'm from the Bay, and specialty rolls are all over the place here, and their super flavorful.   I think this place needs to add some spice to their flavorness.  It lacks the 5th star because the hamachi freshness was not as fresh as I'd want it to be.  I eat lots of raw sushi, and mercury comes a long with it, so it is VERY important to ensure you store your raw fish correctly and keep it fresh for customer's health reasons.  

Oh and one more thing, I would love to see a seaweed salad, or side salad available on the ""sides"" menu for the all you can eat folks.  More sides is just always great.

I know this place just opened, and I will come back for a revisit! Thumbs up so far.  I will revisit my review once this place gets crackin!",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,0,1,3,wHyQ0zJZRt8GLn0gQXqKxQ

My Hawaiian buddy introduce me to this place, as well as Salmon Skin Hand Roll and like ""Whoa!!""  Salmon skin deep fried and rolled with cucumber, yamagobo (kind of like a carrot), and eel sauce.  I've been here twice and could not find a better sushi place that does their Salmon Skin Hand Roll as well as 808 Sushi.  They also offer Hamachi Kama, Salmon Kama and Miso Glazed Black Cod for AYCE so that's another bonus.  

Service can be overly attentive, but i guess that's better than no service.  Could be bad timing too because every other bite i took they were asking if i needed anything, and there's a whole lotta chewing going on.  Eating is no joke.

4059076,2012-08-27,4,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"Located in Summerlin (west of the 15, off the 215).  I used to hate AYCE places - until I came to 808.  I stopped by here on my latest trip to the Ninth Island (Vegas), based upon my yf Lisa S' review (from Vegas).  I also wanted to support my Hawaiian bruddahs.  Lisa S' review was spot on with 4 Stars.

As opposed to the food laying out like most AYCE places, they make the food to order.  At $26.95 and $3 for a large Japanese beer or $1 sake during HH, its a good deal.  My friend and I ordered the following from the app menu:  Ahi and he'e (tako) poke; garlic chicken; salmon kama (no hamachi kama that night); tako karaage; fried smelt and miso black cod.  From the sushi menu we ordered kani; salmon skin handroll; unagi handroll; soft shell crab handroll and two futomaki rolls (Maui and Da Hawaiian - she ordered these not me - lol). 

Overall, the appetizers were very good.  The ahi poke was fresh and flavorful.  The only thing I would change was adding more limu.  The he'e (tako) version was, eh, so-so.  It needed more shoyu and limu.  The garlic chicken was as advertised - nice and garlicky and not greasy.  The salmon kama was fresh and silky as this part of the fish should be.  The he'e karaage melted in your mouth!  The he'e was so fresh.  The fried smelt were nice and crunchy - Kind of like anchovies, but bigger.  But the best of all was the miso black cod.  OMFG - Broke Da Mouth!  It was buttery smooth and oh so fresh!  I wanted to order more, but I abstained because I didn't want to ruin my tastebuds.

The sushi was pretty good too w/ the exception of the rolls.  The kani was ok for what it was.  I should have known it was fake crab.  The rolls were for primarily for my friend so, I only had a bite.  They were not to my liking - I guess I am old school and I have not fallen for the sushi roll craze.  The hand rolls were fresh, huge and creative.  The salmon skin was nice and crunchy.  The unagi came w/ avocado (I have never had it this way). The avocado gave it a creamy finish.  The soft shell crab came w/ a salad made from the crab meat - How creative!  It was very good.

Since I ate most of the apps, hand rolls and drank most of the beer, I didn't have dessert.   My friend didn't have as much, so she ordered the banzai bowl - vanilla ice cream w/ a small apple turnover and chocolate topping.  The other options are vanilla and green tea ice cream or 3 flavors of frozen mochi.  She really liked the dessert.  

Shaka to my bruddahs for good food, that is made to order and AYCE.  It was Da Kine!",o1_sfJ71nrq5QrF00v3Icw,5,5,4,w1le42oaYXFsW2IYyU7PQg

We celebrated my cousin's 21st and my Mom's 60th birthdays there and they delivered!

ahi poke (wonderful, even if frozen - we asked, they were honest!)
garlic chicken
hamachi kama - Uncle said this was the best ever!

4241705,2012-06-14,0,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"Well... where to start... 

Miso black cod.. as recommended per a previous reviewer, had no flavor at all... it was very bland.

The 808 Roll was good, however it was nothing special.. the sauces they used on it didn't have any flavor. 

I was expecting a lot more out of this place... they limit you on a lot of things (1 per person) and those (1 per person) portions are so miniscule it makes you wish there was more then the measly ounce that you get... 

The Ahi Poke was served in literally what looked like a Sake shot cup. it had a strange flavor to it and looked greyish pink, not sure how fresh it was but I only had a bite and I was done with it.

The soft shell crab they use in the spider roll was definitely cold and cooked a long time before they served it. 

I was hoping for more, I really was. from all the positive reviews of this place it seems that they were either having an off day or stopped caring so much about how they prepared their products. 

The most disturbing part was listening to the two NSP Troopers talk about putting bullets in people's heads. not sure what was going on during that conversation however that part was duly noted loudly however I would expect someone dressed professionally in a uniform to act a certain way if they chose to take their lunch break at a sit down restaurant. I'm not removing stars for that but I'm making a notation of it because that's simply how I feel. 

I subtracted a star for the very small portions and limit as such,

subtracted a star for really no flavor in anything I had.

Subtracted another star because I thought that they were really being lazy that day and didn't seem to care what they were putting out.

1 star for the service my cup was never empty.
1 star for how clean the restaurant looked.

very disappointing. however I may return in the future to see if things are different, if that's the case I'll write a new review, if not. then this will remain as my only saving grace to this place.",-Ng6kNjzZee-hT-RZYg_Eg,1,1,2,GMOiHKr4rMMTyecj8IE4bw

To sum it up, if you like slightly below average sushi and have about 2 hours to kill for dinner, 808 is your place.  If not, don't bother.

no.. that's not all. 

because there was also the ahi poke, shrimp tempura, curry over rice!!!, etc etc!!! 

every single item was yummy, fresh, and full of flavor. also, it's really nice how they portion the dishes like a Spanish tapa so that you don't get as full and waste food.

We went there for the first time tonight and was pleasantly surprised to see all the tables filled.  The last Sushi place we have been going to, we were always the only ones in there and it always concerned me (both as to why? and how fresh could the fish be if there was no turnover) - so seeing full tables bodes well to me.  We had to wait 10 minutes for a table since it is so small in there, but I was ok with it.
We are AYCE fans, but their AYCE menu is sort of limited IMO...but we still found lots of things we enjoyed!
We started with the Garlic Chicken per the Yelp recommendation and it was super good!  We only got 4 small pieces, and I saw another table get a much larger portion which made me sad as I could have eaten more.
We tried lots of different rolls and didn't get over stuffed super fast like at other places. The fish tasted fresh, but we get the Special rolls that aren't really fish fish.
The spicy tuna, spicy crab and spicy mayo - none were all that spicy.  I could have used some more heat. However, I still loved the taste and there was no burning in my mouth!
My only complaint is how they run the waiting on tables.  We had 3 different people take our orders, and they wouldn't always know if someone else had recently taken a order. They would see us not eating and someone would stop to check on us and want us to order another roll - while I totally appreciated the attentiveness, it made for some confusion about what rolls we were on and what we were waiting for. 

They offer a punch card - 10 AYCEs get 1 free.

No seriously, this hawaiian sushi joint is okay.  The half-price happy hour makes it worthwhile.  However, they really need to take it easy on the sweet-teryiaki sauce on their rolls.

So, it's been a while since I've been here. But some out of town guest wanted to go last weekend. I was shocked!!! What happened to 808 Sushi? I walked in to (KoMex)Korea Town Sushi. Where did the local staff go? There are a bunch of expressionless Koreans that draw their eyebrows on serving us. If that's what you want to call it. 

By far the worst service I have ever received here. No one stops to refill drinks, ask how everything is going, or if they can get us anything else. You have to flag them down and ask for more food and drinks. Also is it that hard to smile? We're not in North Korea. Even though it looks like it.

This place has really let itself go. The quality of food has gone downhill dramatically. The girl that seems to be running this place is definitely under qualified and too worried about what's on her phone then what's going on in the restaurant. 

You need to get your local staff back. Because what you got going on now is a definite let down to the local community. You were one of a handful of 808 eateries that represented well. You had the name, the food, and majority of your staff was actually local. Just cause you lived in Hawaii doesn't make you local either.

Not one thing any of us ordered stood out as anything over ""average"".  Service was TERRIBLE and there was maybe 3 groups total in there so no excuse on the extremely poor service.  I swear we'd order 2 rolls and wait 20min for them to come out every time.  One of my rolls was forgotten and I mentioned once that I hadn't received it still and then had to ask the waitress again 10min later where it was.  It was forgotten but apparently my first mention that I didn't have it wasn't enough for her to look into it.  We had to literally wave across the restaurant to get our server's attention whenever we'd like a drink or to order something else.  Oh...and about those drinks we had to work to get...we even confirmed pricing with the waitress before ordering asking ""happy hour prices for drinks right?"" and she nodded.

There's a really good energy in here, with lots of families and friends and happy people who seem to really love sushi. The servers reflect that as well - they're very friendly and highly interactive, and it's awesome when a wait staff allows their personalities to shine through. 

Happy Hour is fantastic! I'd really rather not gorge myself on all you can eat sushi if I can avoid it, so 808 Sushi's affordable, delicious food during Happy Hour really makes me... Happy.

I preferred the rolls over the nigiri. Really good unagi-based and tempura-based modern-style rolls, they're flavorful and have great texture without being overdone. 

This all makes 808 feel more like a cozy, neighborhood sushi shop to visit with familiar friends for lunch, without having to deal with the long lines, large menus, and all-you-can-eat pressure and rush of more mainstream restaurants. 

(For some reason we caught the happy hour from 11AM-3PM on a weekday, which doesn't seem to be listed anywhere on their website or menus, but is common knowledge among the regulars. I'm not sure about the details, since this was ""my friend's sushi place, not mine"", if you know what I mean.

4669646,2010-03-29,3,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"808 Sushi is a skilled fisherman with a Hawiian Dad and Japanese Mom, but seems to be confused about who he really is. 

This fisherman clearly has some Japanese blood in him because he offers one of the freshest fish in Vegas, comparable to Naked Fish. While he may have one of the best eel sauce, he is still an apprentice. Offering a very limited selection of apps and rolls that fail to impress me. 

Their house roll, 808 special was just okay. If they're own house special roll fails to impress me I don't think the other rolls will impress me. I also took half a dragon roll since it was my last order, no complaints here, but nothing special either. Maybe I'm just being a sushi elitist.

I was given the shrimp heads from my sweet shrimp that was lightly fried. It could have been much better if it was fried more throughly through so I can actually eat the entire head in 1 bite, instead of just sucking the inside. Places like Lotus of Siam and even Brian's Beach Sushi get this, but not Ichiza or this 808 Sushi. 

The ahi poke, I just couldn't bare myself to finish it. Just something about the flavors made me not want to finish it and I hate wasting seafood.

The hamachi kama, yellowtail collar, was grilled to a crisp. It just wasn't grilled right because all I could taste is burnt flavor. To be fair, grilling seafood properly is really difficult to get it just right, sadly they fail to do this properly. Hikari got this right.

The seared salmon sashimi was good, but I found it unnecessary to add the hot peppers on it. Salmon already is very flavorful on its own, no need to add additional spices that mask its natural flavor. 

The gyoza came out hot, crispy, and tasty, but request it as pan fried instead. This will help preserve more of the flavor that get lost when you fry food.

The uni had the good creamy texture, but the dark yellow color tells you the grade of uni isn't that great. But hey, it tastes great and thats all that matter.

The banzai desert is apple pie filling wrapped up in a dough to form what resembles an egg roll. Its deep fried and then cut in half, served with vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream. Good, but a small problem with this. Combining something that is relatively hot like the apple pie filling and taking a bite of an ice cream is not a good combination. This may hurt your teeth a little because of the coldness of the ice cream and the hard and hotness of the apple roll. Its similar to filling a plastic bottle with hot water, pouring it out, then immediately pouring cold water over it. Try it for yourself and see what happens. This  temperature differential is not good for you. Letting the apple roll cool down will fix this problem.

The fisherman also has a Hawiian dad that takes over part of the menu. The dad's influence is great for those who don't like sushi, but those wanting more of the Japanese influence will be disappointed because there is no dynamite, screaming orgasm, soft shell crab, oysters, or toro on the all you can eat menu.

The sushi bar has an open kitchen, but there are also someissues with this. First, if you sit right next to the grill, you'll get some of the smoke from it. You also see the owner ordering his staff to make sure the order gets out. While I really admire his push to get out food, it just kind of kills the good vibe of eating at a sushi bar. I just got a bad vibe from the owner at the end of my meal, despite having a very good vibe of him at the beginning of the meal. How quickly things change. Otherwise, the front of the house are really attentive and really friendly.

808 Sushi is another sushi restaurant, but I'm not really seeing the hype about this place. With some small improvements and additions, I can see this place being really special. Otherwise, its just the place you go for all you can eat sushi with a limited selection, and happen to have friends who don't like sushi. Spend a couple of more bucks and stick with Hikari or Sushimon for your all you can eat sushi needs.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,3,1,3,-M7mAHhSJOsuTbmsPRtYPA
4674643,2012-01-14,0,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"I definitely drop by 808 Sushi from time to time. They've got a good selection of both sushi as well as entrees/appetizers. 

Regarding AYCE: The AYCE option is only around $21 at lunch, which is a great deal. Their menu includes both rolls/nigiri as well as things like their mochiko chicken, poke, gyoza, etc., so even if you're not in the mood for sushi and would basically like to eat ALL THE APPETIZERS/hot items you've got yourself an excellent deal. 

Lunch Specials: They've started offering lunch specials for awhile now, and their most expensive offering is $8.50, which includes a mound of rice w/ furikake, a full portion of mochiko or garlic chicken, 8pc spicy tuna roll, 3 nigiri (salmon, yellowtail, tuna), and salted warm edamame. The rest of the lunch bentos are cheaper and have a ton of stuff too. 

In short, great portion sizes, good prices, and consistently good food. They don't put a ton of rice on their sushi as well which I appreciate. It doesn't blow my mind but I don't hesitate to come here for AYCE or take out. They are also the only place I know of that offers *reasonable* donburi like katsudon and oyakodon. (I know a place that serves katsudon in a box that barely fits 1.5 cups of food... for $8-9...)

One minor criticism from my point of view is that their spicy tuna filling is more like the texture of spicy poke. Instead of finely chopping/mincing the tuna and mixing it with the spicy sauce it is large chunks of tuna coated in the sauce. This makes the spicy tuna less spicy which makes me sad. Prepared this way it isn't much different from putting a bunch of wasabi on my tuna. Then again, I am the type of person who grew up eating spicy food and there are people on this planet that find bell peppers spicy... /shrug",67RZcwJAxtx73GQz9km5IA,0,0,4,NsBvYOk8_pgUUo6T4FY0aQ

I usually order their combination dinner (teriyaki salmon and shrimp tempura) because you get a good amount and it keeps me full. Their teriyaki salmon is my favorite thing on their menu.

I love poke, a Hawaiian dish of usually ahi tuna with spices, onion, and sometime macadamia nuts.  Now if you go to Hawaiian grocery stores, (Daiei), they will have 10-15 varieties of poke.  I usually love salmon poke.
So 808 Sushi gets 2 stars for going out of their way to make salmon poke for me!  (Hubby had the ahi tuna poke)
The other star goes to how big a bowl of that salmon poke that was for only $5.00!  I could not finish it.  (Maybe because I ate it with a half a bowl of rice).
We also had the spicey scallop roll which was very good.

They offer happy hour even on Saturdays that gives you half price rolls. My friend brought me here because for the price this place is awesome. Its small yet roomy enough to not feel all congested.

The Service we received was AMAZING . I think my friend and I were there at least two hours but not once were we rushed or bothered by any of the girls working. We also got good recommendations on dessert and I was able to try EVERYTHING I wanted.

I got the Garlic chicken Appetizer to try thanks to Yelp Recommendations and I must admit even for me it is SALTY and I love Love salt but for 2.50$ I would probably give it another chance. Full price I would stay away from it though.

We got lots of different appetizers from cucumber salad to a Salmon Katsu.

I'm not sure how many places on here that I have Yelped about, but I feel like I have been to so many, and I've finally found my favorite here at 808. I even debated writing a review to I could try and keep it to myself :) 

So, I always do the AYCE. I just think it's the best deal, and that way you can order as much as you want! The appetizers are included, and the best is the Miso Black Cod. OMG, it's buttery, soft, melt in your mouth amazing. Too bad with AYCE you can only order one. I also love the poke, and the gyoza. Yummm I'm drooling just thinking about it! 

Onto the sushi! The best roll here is the 808 hands down. You can't get better than this. It's spicy and sweet, and everything nice. And the fish here is SOOOOO fresh! The salmon nigiri, the albacore white tuna. Mmmmm. You really just can't even compare anywhere else to this place.

My friends finally all arrive and I tell the host we are all here.  She told us to hold on and then what I can only assume is the manager came over and said he couldn't sit us because a big table had just arrived.  He didn't want to stress out the chefs.

Finally, one of the most awesome sushi chefs yells from over the counter and asks us how many and invited us to sit in his zone at the bar.  The service from him was exceptional.

5199490,2010-06-09,12,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"Two notes:
1. This is a review of a non-sushi item, so while my personal experience was 2-stars, I am giving a one star bump for the possibility that they offer a better sushi experience.
2. I only recently learned that 808 is a Hawaii area code. Previous to this discovery I had been thinking ""boom like an 808.""

Now, for the review:

While I do occasionally go for AYCE sushi, I am not a sushi fanatic. I wasn't raised on seafood, so I have to be in a special mood to order AYCE sushi. When I went to 808, I was not in that mood, so I ordered chicken yakisoba and a house salad instead. 

The server forgot my house salad, so no information there. However, I was not a fan of the noodles. There were slim pickins when it came to vegetables, and the chicken was not my favorite. It had a flavor that I refer to as ""chickeny chicken,"" which I understand really makes no sense, but it is an artificial, perhaps frozen, chicken taste. I ended up piling all of my chicken in a corner of the plate and simply eating the noodles. 

I guess the lesson learned is skip the noodles at a place known for AYCE sushi.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,16,9,3,21tCOzx4B3MLmBziTxOsgA

You don't have to worry about guessing whats in a roll since their menu's are very descriptive and the food does come out exactly as described, which is definitely a plus! 

We started off with the Ahi Poke and Garlic Chicken. Both very flavorful and delicious! For our main entrees, we ordered the 808 special, Dragon roll, Tiger roll and Tempura roll. The sauce of the rolls is pretty good as its a combination of sweet with just a tiny kick! 

It's also great coz aside from the HH, they have AYCE sushi! Lunch is $20.95 while dinner is $24.95. I would strongly suggest you go for the HH though, since for a party of 5 hungry people, our bill was only $55.",Jxwb7vT6MG5hnYmup4T5Sw,0,0,4,uGeIHr9ihNJ0Wa1UoKjNqQ

The waitresses go off in the corner and chat so if you need something, you will need to call them to you. So we order like 2 of the dollar sakes because we don't know how long it will take to get the next one. I think becoming regulars they know us now so they are more attentive.

5311126,2013-01-28,1,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"I was contemplating on giving them two stars, but I really had to reach here and think of something else nice to say and basically came up with nothing, so here goes.

This is our first visit. The place was packed so I thought, ""Must be a good sign, right."" There was one empty table, but the hostess didn't even move and just pointed it out to us and said, ""You can just sit over there."" 

Food here gets no love from me. We ordered 2 orders of negitoro and salmon hand rolls, combination plate w/ 2 entrees (garlic chicken & miso black cod) which is supposed to come with miso soup, salad, rice, and dessert. We also got a spider roll. Let's start with what I liked, which was the miso black cod. I thought it was delicious and cooked just right. I would order this again. Unfortunately, I can't say the same with the rest of our orders. The garlic chicken was so greasy and just didn't look right. I had garlic chicken before from 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate which I loved, so I was expecting it to resemble that but I was let down. The salmon hand roll is ok. I had better at a Korean/Sushi/Chinese place we dined at yesterday. The negitoro was worse. It was basically just tuna sliced in cubes with scallions hurriedly put on top. The spider roll was the worst thing I've ever eaten in a long time: completely drenched in sauce that it completely fell apart when I barely picked it up with my chopsticks. I had a small bite and quickly put it back to the plate. The dessert never came to our table so I cannot comment on it. 

At this point I just want to leave and move on so we asked for the bill. Our combo plate was supposed to be $14.95 but we were charged $29. They could have thought we ordered 2 combo plates but our bill specifically stated: 1 Combo B: $29.99. I pointed it out and the lady apologized and fixed the mistake right away.

We're from Hawaii, so trying to find fresh fish here has been very tasking!  It took us 2 1/2 years to finally discover this place, which is on the far west-side of the Strip, Mountain's Edge.  I mean, we've done Sushi Mon several times before, but I can't help but get the feeling of it being so ""tourist-y"" over there.  Here at 808 Sushi, the feeling is a little more ""local"" in style, and you don't get that hurried, stuffy feel from the staff either.  Despite the bar-ambience at 808 Sushi, I still find this place to be very family-friendly as well.

The AYCE is fantastic!  We had to at least dine here for both the lunch and dinner AYCE before we could review for the place with a clear assessment.  Lucky us!  Lunch AYCE is $20.95, my daughter eats free, she's 4.  The dinner AYCE is $24.95, again daughter eats free, while my elementary-school son eats for $12.95.  He could have eaten a la carte off the menu, but we know his growing appetite by now.  Next, we need to try their Happy Hours, Monday thru Friday 3pm-630pm, Friday and Saturday 9pm-11pm.  I hear it's half off certain menu items and their beer, plus $1 hot sake.

All their nigiris are ono!  I don't need to list all of them, so just know that they ALL are delicious!  Yes, they are smaller in cut, but it's all you can eat.  So, therefore:  Eat All You Can.  Hah!  I've tried their special rolls too, which, although tasty, I've never been a huge fan of these ""mainland-style"" rolls anyhow.  Despite my particular sushi style preferences, I did enjoy their Da Kamikazi roll, tempura, soft shell crab, eel, and salmon.  But, in the end, all I want is nigiri sushi!

Their hot menu is great too!  Their lunch is a modified, limited version of the dinner one.  I have to mention their Mochiko Chicken!  Soooo crunchy and tasty!  The kids had 3 orders!!!  Also worth mentioning, their Ahi Poke is quite flavorful for such a small portion, but it packs just the right punch (keep ordering, if you like it that much!).  Other notable items are the Agedashi Tofu, Garlic Chicken, Miso Black Cod (Butterfish), and Tako Karaage, just to name a few.

And lastly, I have to say that the staff here is super friendly and warm-welcoming.  This is THE definite contrast to the staff at Sushi Mon.  Again, Sushi Mon seems to hurry you through, yet take their time w/your orders.  They unfortunately don't do a terrific job at explaining their ""limits"" and ""restrictions"" on their AYCE menu.  But, at 808 Sushi, with just a few ""restrictions"" to your order, they explain it well enough here and are much more friendlier about it too.  This is probably due to their laid-back approach on their service and their customers, which by all means does not mean their service is lackluster.  It just means their friendly Aloha attitude makes your experience here that much better!",xozBOvi6cWO_p1OdteF9zw,1,1,5,KNhzVpOKWbsq9k6pnhgCNA

They have a couple items that you can only order once (Miso Black Cod). But it doesn't matter because the menu is huge. Oh and that Miso Cod is so good, literally melts in the mouth.

We are totally those people that pig out on AYCE sushi. Here is what we ordered:

Philadelphia Roll (2), Candy Cane. 007, Hawaiian Style, Triple Crown, Rainbow Roll, Miso Cod (2), Nigiri-- Albacore (2), Hamachi (2), Tuna (2), Amaebi (2). I know pigs!!

They also have really good prices on alcohol. We ordered to Kirin Lights for $4.00 each. Most places are $7.00.

They have Happy Hour everyday (I think) and pretty much everything is half off including Sake. This is a great deal if you are not going to totally pork out like us. The restaurant is actually a good size and they get the food out fast.  If you are looking for a great AYCE I would def. give this place a try.",nixQjPlfVhMEhrNkmp5FDw,2,1,5,Gk8xNB5IkORdnSYm8dPKfg

I ordered the salmon teriyaki entree and it was very good. The portion was not huge, but not small either.

5374125,2011-04-06,0,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"Out of all the sushi joints that I have been to, I am surprised that I did not yelp about this place. 

After what seemed like an eternity of my friend raving about 808, I made her go try it out with me. We went for lunch, because I am a beast and was sure I would regret eating so heavily at night. Instead I would gorge myself and pretend that my body would burn off all the calories during the rest of the day. Although we did not get the full menu, the lunch list was more than adequate.

When we entered the restaurant, it did not look like anything special. There is nothing that stands out in comparison to any other place. 

What it lacks in appearance, it makes up for in taste. For appetizers, the tako karaage, agedashi tofu, seaweed salad, and ahi poke are amazing. In fact, I am sure my friend and I could eat our money worth in the last two items. 

The main reason why I like this place is because they do not overload a roll with rice. The sushi comes out a little smaller than most places, but that is a good thing. It has been so long since I have been here that I forget the names of the rolls. When I go back, I will write out an in depth list. My biggest issue is with the use of soft shell crab. I prefer that it be whole, but at 808 they mix the meat with another fish and sauce. Half the pleasure of soft shell crab is to eat the exterior of the creature. On a positive note, the fish is fresh and you can taste it in the nigiri. I love hirame( fluke, sometimes called halibut), unagi (eel), ahi (tuna), tako (octopus), and sake (salmon). They are all basic, but essential sushi. 

The staff is friendly and quick, but as our meal was wrapping up the service took a turn. In my mind, it was because they wanted to keep us there and not let us leave. It was the weirdest experience. Usually people give you the bill and just as quickly take it to rush you out. Instead we were left sitting there being asked by the chefs if we wanted more.

If you are not an AYCE type then go during happy hour for half off all cut rolls and beer. Monday through Friday from 3pm-6:30pm.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,6,4,ATaysn7ZHw4Rzcz9NzQ1KQ

5401522,2017-08-07,2,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"The reason that I am giving this place one star is because we found a hair attached to the batter of one of the pieces of fried tempura shrimp. They were professional and immediately apologized and got us a new plate of fried shrimp tempura and made sure not to charge us for it, but that does not change the fact that it is disgusting to have found this.
The food itself is mediocre at best. Had it not been for the hair incident, I would have probably given this place three stars. I was disappointed with the cucumber salad that was not at all traditional cucumber salad. There was a ginger sauce place on top of the salad itself that was overkill and it was not pleasant at all to eat it. The seaweed salad was bathed in oil and just disgusting. It was barely palatable to me. The lightly battered octopus tempura was just OK and the gyozu dumplings were in total fail. They just weren't very good and they were dry.
I ordered the rainbow roll sushi which was decent, but not fantastic, and I requested no Ponzu sauce... their whole menu is practically sauce on everything! The crunch roll was just OK and the shrimp tempura roll was just OK and the spider roll just passed. Overall, huge disappointment.
I was told that this is a Hawaiian place and not Japanese. Last time I checked, sushi is a Japanese delicacy... I would rather a restaurant be clear in saying that they make everything Hawaiian style so we are able to avoid and steer clear of it. If I want sushi, I want sushi. If I want Hawaiian food, that is not sushi! 
I will likely avoid this restaurant in the near future as I was less than impressed. Once again, the hair incident left me feeling very sick inside. Not recommended by someone who loves sushi and appreciates great sushi.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,0,0,1,EUooKsKxCk-6OpeEsnvQvA

It's inside an old Italian restaurant that, when it was an Italian restaurant, looked really nice. 808 Sushi is not going to win any ambiance awards any time soon. Not the best looking place, but where it lacks in decor, it more than makes up for in rolls. 

This place has a VERY generous AYCE menu (and frequent AYCE cards so you can earn free ones). The rolls are always tasty, quick, fresh, and wrapped tight.

Everything came fresh, made as we waited, the initial order, I believe included about six items, came rapidly.  We loved the garlic chicken, shrimp tempura, Ahi Poke, and the mochiko chicken.  I loved ""da kamikazi"" roll, the dragon roll, Haleakela and Hawaiian style roll.

First, they were out of hamachi kama, which was forgivable, but still disappointing.  For the first half of this visit, the sushi chef seemed to ignore us.  After that he was more attentive.  Unfortunately, his skills, if you call them that, were not up to par.  The rolls were cut inconsistently with some pieces so small they would fall apart.  Other pieces were so large, they could not be eaten in one bite.  I ordered one baked roll.  He forgot it in the oven.  Mistakes happen, just don't serve your mistakes to me.  It was burnt to the point of being not edible.  Even the server commented on it being burnt.  One of the guys was pushing oyster shooters because they made too many.  Fine, I decided to have a couple.  Not too bad, except for the piece of styrofoam I got with it.

That part didn't bother me and flavor was fine but it was so incredibly chewy Mr. Ed couldn't even break it down. There was no way to even swallow it after a minute of chewing so I just spit it out. Yea that bad. The potstickers had no flavor. I don't know if it was prepackaged and cooked on sight but I can't possibly believe some company made this to sell and people actually buy it. Last but not least was the salmon kama. I love any kind of kama with hamachi being a favorite. But this wasn't even edible! It went beyond just a ""fishy"" taste. I believe it was actually spoiled. It just had that spoiled fish smell and flavor. I think the waitress knew what was up because she was so quick to apologize.

I think the workers could of at least said something else while we waited for them to cook more...because being ""out of rice"" just made them look silly. it was almost humorous cause they ran out of 2 kinds of sodas too. The nighttime workers are a little slower and a little less approachable. BUT, I absolutely loved the daytime worker's hospitality.  I think their Hawaiian accents just make me happy too. (: A few times a couple of our groups' orders didn't come out, but it was kind of okay because our eyes were bigger than our stomach. ANYWAY, overall I LOVE THIS PLACE. I live in California, but will come to 808 Sushi every time I visit Vegas. Overall, the food is forsure a 5+ quality place! (:",H6dyCRrUr1KxuHxSlJQbGA,0,0,4,dxSDF92zGlmTsa-2AASbBQ

I love the ahi poke and the garlic chicken.

5945018,2014-04-24,3,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"Ok worse dining exp so far ordered threw menunu a grub hub like site.. Total was $60 ! so for that price I am expecting good stuff right, wrong very disappointed I was thinking quality like Raku or something however really shocked. 

Cucumber salad -While thinking to myself well hoping it would of been more like a traditional kim chee style cucumber salad it wasn't very bland more like southern cucumber salad had about two bites thats about it tossed it out witch was sad it had some type of crab like thing on top witch made it hard to eat. 

Gyoza - What I was looking forward to was cold had to re heat kinda disappointing having to re heat the food that should of been hot. 

Meat dish- I apologize for not remembering the name but it was HORRIBLE. !! The meat was super grisly, hard to eat, and smelled of flat top or cooking device.  


I had deep fried roll - witch to me just had panko on top lightly crusted the bottom of the roll was not breaded. The rice was good thankfully not hard. 

The dessert was the biggest disappointment - While the idea of a apple filled egg roll  like dessert intrigued my mind it fell threw on execution the ice cream was mixed into the dish and melted I MEAN COMPLETELY MELTED INTO THE DISH, Thus voiding the crispy texture of the actual dish. I was looking forward to this dish. I think since we live in dessert area I am from Phoenix too that the best way to carry ice cream is individually to avoid this process either in a smaller container and let the person place it on its own.  

I really wanted to like this place I really did. However I just left a complaint with menunu and will follow threw hopefully to work out a refund. I would expect quality like this at a denny's rather the sushi joint.

5946226,2013-02-05,1,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"I would rate this place no stars if I could...

I had purchased the $20 for $40 groupon and was extremely excited to try this place... As a frequent user of groupon I understand that many groupons cannot be applied towards happy hour prices. However, never I have gone into a restaurant and have been told that since I have a groupon that no one else in my 'party' could receive happy hour pricing.. So separate people can't have separate checks???

And they wanted us to pay $2.50 for hot sake (normal price) when happy hour sake was $1.. That's more of a discount than my groupon!

And as to the food, it was OK. The rolls were small and flavorless. It is was not worth any more than groupon or happy hour pricing. The poke salad had good tuna but that's about it. Their rainbow roll and tiger roll were blah. 

The service itself was OK but the waitress SHOULD have given us separate checks... That's just stupid on her part. Doesn't she want a tip? Repeat customers???

Overall I was very disappointed. I am always looking for new happy hours.. And 808 sushi will not be on my list...",Y9MQoKoHkD62iGT1_hikag,5,2,1,OpUKUX7WZBTeeKxZNlnRwA

The last time we came here the fish tasted bad.  The only upside is we always have gotten great service. Bring back the original servers and owner the sushi was so much better then. :(  sorry to say we will be looking for another ayce sushi place unless the quality gets back to par,RCgfxH5PclsgSKRWDGJ86A,8,4,3,ipN7Hjgolb0DuyUDArNc5g

5960217,2011-02-01,2,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"I have been here several times for the AYCE. On these few occasions I tend to steer myself towards the hot dishes. I don't really enjoy their sushi. I much prefer the other options. 

I wish they would allow more more orders of the kalbi, they limit it to one per guest unfortunately. I think this is probably my favorite dish here. I don't really think I get my money's worth to be honest on the AYCE. Some of the rolls are pretty good, but nothing really stands out about this place. 

I would much prefer getting a la carte here, plus they have a Happy Hour here which would probably be better. All in all, this place is just okay. If given the choice, I usually don't recommend 808.

It's not the worst and it's not the best in town. Pretty much just average in my book.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,4,3,jFT3id3mV5hguPMv9iD44g

Additionally, the servers are always filled with the aloha spirit. It makes me feel like I'm back in Hawaii since they're super friendly. I'm so glad this restaurant is still going strong!",0Md3sO3sRR3GE4eQLtqZbw,0,0,5,RtykD5d1HABxJVzr58JqqA

The appetizers that come with AYCE are proportioned just right. I could still enjoy the two rolls that I ordered, which is saying a lot. The tempura batter is slightly sweet, but still good. And their green tea ice cream is probably better than any other place I've had it. Not too sweet, and much lighter on the matcha flavor. The service is attentive and we didn't wait 163726272 years for one roll. (That's a huge pet peeve for me) I'm definitely coming back for lunch again.",AfE9gOJCFceyHLbWE2UAPA,0,0,4,jnX3Mjx83BMDjeGTJd_8mg
5983562,2011-01-06,3,16tWXenJ1wTqugXJU7yiZg,"808 Sushi is by far one of the best sushi restaurants I've had. I learned about this from a few locals, and they're regulars. For its price, the quality was amazing and it tasted much better than other high-end sushi restaurants. I would've like to have tried more, but my stomach couldn't handle everything. I wish was I was fatter for this place.

If you're even a little hungry, you should get the all-you-can eat menu for 24.95.  It is definitely worth it. They have a large kitchen, sushi, and roll menu.

Recommendations: 
Kitchen menu -  Ahi poke, Garlic Chicken (juicy), Mochiko chicken, pork gyoza, teriyaki chicken

Roll menu - 808 special, triple crown, baked scallop, haleakala, kilaeuea, unagi.

Dessert: (comes w/ the all-u-can eat menu)
Banzai Special (AMAZING)

I don't ever order teriyaki chicken because it's on a typical teriyaki sauce, but this place has its own unique recipe and it doesn't taste like any teriyaki chicken I've had. It was delicious.

The thing I like about their All You Can Eat is the selection of hot items.  For example, I was able to get seared ahi tuna, curry with rice, and garlic chicken.  That kind of sets a niche-y feel of the place.  The owners of the joint are very friendly and the staff is very accomodating.  I've always felt very welcome in their restaurant.  I think their 808 specialty roll is definitely something to go for and I like how they properly serve the heads with the amaebi sushi.

There service is mediocre when the right guys are not working. It seems that the guys do a better job than the ladies. Every time I've come and have had a lady help me I'm always waiting at least 30 to 45 minutes for a to go order even if they say give it 20 minutes or so. If I'm dining in the ladies are not as attentive. Also, when it says happy hour, I expect to get happy hour prices, but if the ladies are present they will not honor it for take out. 

The foods great, but overall I try to only come here when it is happy hour since it's hard to get good service. The service brings their stars for me.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,3,fWNnxAgyZkTdmmrl-UbknQ
