383214,2011-06-13,1,oaap_zKAxkrlTBwF3onmXw,"I got a deal on travelzoo.com for my recent trip to Las Vegas. I thought it was a good deal...2 entrees and 2 margaritas plus this restaurant was on the strip at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. When we were seated and greeted by our server, we mentioned that we had the travelzoo deal. Once we said that, I think our service went downhill... 

--He asked if we wanted our margaritas on rocks or frozen...we asked for frozen. What did we get??? Margaritas on rocks! 

--I ordered the carne fajita platter. What did I get??? A chicken plate! 

I mean c'mon! Every other table got salsa and chips, it took us a good 5 min to flag down our server to ask for it and to tell him he got our orders wrong. What worried me the most was that it only took them a few minutes to bring out my carne asada platter. I would think that my meat would take longer to cook...I guess not!!! 

It frustrates me when restaurants offer travelzoo deals, groupons, etc and their service changes once you mention it! Just because you pay for a fraction of the meal doesn't mean I should get a fraction of the service. It's ridiculous. No matter what kind of deal I get, I always tip to the full price--so I don't understand why these businesses freak out and think they don't need to provide good service.",C3N9hxed7jQ-ht8JBqV8BA,0,0,1,1VnNyUbR7IM82ov9FT2sbQ

Very tasty and fresh! Hidden Gem on the Strip. Definitely try the Nachos Appetizer with Chicken and extra cheese to share! Muy Bueno!!!

Update - 040415: Unfortunately I am updating this post to express my less than professional experience today at this establishment. Earlier today my wife and I decided we wanted to return to La Salsa for their very tasty nachos! We were both looking forward to getting our tastebuds awakened. Upon arrival the bartender was very short to say the least. She asked what we would like to order...We told her we were not ready. My wife stepped away to the restroom and the bartender asked again. I asked for water and politely stated that the order would be placed when my wife returned. Only one water was placed at our seating...Wife returned, we ordered, food was served quickly, margaritas were great...I asked my wife how was the Guacamole, she replied ""not good""...from here it went downhill. We mentioned this to the bartender, and her response was ""What!!?? Our guacamole is amazing!"" I expressed to her we did not enjoy the dish and to please remove from our bill. Her response was since you have tasted it I cannot remove the item. We had ordered (2) 14.00 margaritas, Nachos for 10 to 12 dollars...were we really having a conversation about a 9.00 guacamole appetizer? She refused and I requested the manager. Manager shows up...almost in a scolding manner asking what was the issue. I expressed we did not like the guacamole and to remove from our ticket. He appeared to take it personal and once again in a scolding fashion asked what was wrong with the guacamole!!?? I expressed again we did not enjoy and wanted it removed from our bill. His response was have you eaten any...I replied, Yes we tasted this and determinated we did not like the dish. Finally he snipped ""Remove it from their tab"" Wow, really a 9.00 appetizer! I was highly agitated and stepped away to get some fresh air. Upon my return, my wife was visibly still bothered by the experience. The bartender had given us our check while we had half of the nachos remaining and we did not even ask for the check...The total bill was 44.00, the total came to 50.00 after a 6.00 tip. I requested to speak to the manager again, introduced myself, and extended my hand for a handshake. I begin to explain my point of view regarding the earlier encounter by showing him the previous post on Google Maps Review. I also explained to him that we primarily have eaten guacamole prepared tableside...and what we were served today was not tasty to us. I explained that there were not enough onions, spiciness, and salt. He explained that yes there is a difference between their guacamole and prepared fresh tableside was a difference. Their guacamole is made every four hours and made with sun dried tomatoes. He also explained how he was allergic to onions. He also stated that we were the first to ever complain about the guacamole. He was cordial and not as defensive as earlier. While I do understand him being taken back by our complaint...was it justified to come across as though we had done something wrong by expressing our opinion? We are talking abouy 9.00 dollars.  What I love about the USA is the free market choice and competition. There are quite a few other tex mex spots on the strip and we will be giving those a try. What bothers me the most is the first experience was excellent! Bartender was great! Service was great!! I am very disappointed. Later that evening we ended up at the Capital Grille bar on the Strip for a few martinis and their incredibly delicious lamb chops. As we sat there chatting with the bartenders and enjoying our drinks and meal...I was so thankful for Consistently Great Service! Thanks Capital Grille for a wonderful end to our evening. Oh and by the way the bill at Capital Grille was only 10.00 dollars more than La Salsa. Be mindful where your dollars are spent...",JEha_8sKP-PyvK2HU3ONiA,0,0,1,Ha_9LGqidztbbH06um97Jg
410558,2013-05-04,2,oaap_zKAxkrlTBwF3onmXw,"We were looking for a place to grab a few appetizers and drinks after a morning/afternoon of gambling in Vegas and from the outside La Salsa Cantina appeared to offer just that.  We were very wrong.  Six of us walked into the empty restaurant and we were quickly greeted by our server and we ordered 6 Tecates as soon as we sat down.  We then ordered an order of guacamole, queso and the steak nachos.  All of them were fairly tasteless and average at best (I would give the food 2 stars).  So our food comes out and we start eating, but our Tecates are nowhere to be found.  About 45 minutes later we are done with our meal and we ask for our check.  As he brings out our check and notices the Tecates on there he tells us he will be right back with our beers.  I politely told him that it's a little late for that and we just needed to leave to which he replied ""Oh, so you don't want the beers you ordered anymore?"".  The whole exchange was a little mind boggling and I wish I could have the 45 minutes of my life that I spent at La Salsa Cantina back.  

As we left and were walking to our next destination I noticed a Chiptole.  I have not eaten at this Chipotle, but I am postive that going to that Chiptole and spending 15 minutes eating a burrito and then the other 30 minutes as a handbiller passing out escort service cards to tourists while wearing an orange shirt that says ""Girls Girls Girls"" would have been more enjoyable than our 45 minutes at La Salsa Cantina.",8-YTq1Ulq2fvhB3mcFysHw,1,0,1,RaDur94F_5AxuRW9e7p6Kw

So we stumbled upon La Salsa Cantina at Caesars Palace and were unsure if the outcome would be good or not. Usually places like this are over priced and the quality sucks.

Luckily, it wasn't like that! The food was so good. The menu is a small to fair selection. Typical mexican restaurants have pages and pages of food to choose from, but La Salsa only had a couple and they were great dishes to choose from.

I had a grande chicken burrito and my friend had street style carne asada tacos. I was indecisive whether to get the burrito or a enchilada stack! I choose the burrito and what a great choice it was. Both of our plates had great portions of beans, rice, and our main entree. I had black beans and my friend had pinto beans. 

The only complaint I have is they didn't serve chips and salsa for starters. I glanced at a table across and they had chips and salsa, but another table didn't. So I'm guessing they serve them upon request. No big deal. Our meals had us full for the rest of the day. Oh, and the bus boy wouldn't stop hitting on my friend! That was annoying. 

Anyway, I highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for great mexican food. I wish they had this place in Southern California!!!",glmJ-q0UHV8plSUa8wyhqQ,0,0,4,eNa3FEvj4JitNe1ixoo8wA

I remember eating at La Salsa when it was at Neonopolis and enjoying the meal.  I walked in and was this close to walking out.  It did have a weird vibe.  But the waitress came before I had a chance to leave.  So I order my soda and am waiting for my chips and salsa.  I ask and was told that chips and salsa are not free.  Hmm, no free chips and salsa at a sit down mexican restaurant.  I was extremely let down.  The meal consisted of chicken and avacado enchiladas.  The meal was small, without much flavor, and had about a quarter of an avocado.  The meal cost $18.

Good drinks, very good chips and salsa and guac, and the enchiladas, tacos, and quesadillas were all quite good - a step above your typical tex-mex fare. The whole menu was texmex essentially so nothing too exotic but what they do prepare they seem to prepare well.

We upgraded our margaritas to the premium ones for an extra $2 each and we both enjoyed it. It was not watered down at all and you could taste the tequila in it.

They were sooo freaking good! We got half yards because they were out of the full yard cups but that was just enough. We also had a small guac and chips appetizer which was really good.

5962610,2009-12-01,2,oaap_zKAxkrlTBwF3onmXw,"Allow me to start this review by saying that I hate corporate Mexican food chains.  La Salsa and Baja Fresh both used to have fresh meats and produce, but man have they gone downhill over the last decade.  And Chipotle?  Have you seen the South Park episode entitled Chipotle-away?  That summarizes my sentiments exactly...

The girl and I were hunting the Strip looking for some breakfast at 3pm.  Nothing doing.  The only places that served brunch had waits of approximately an hour... not cool.  So we wandered into Caesar's hoping that Boa might have some unique Vegas brunch menu... denied.  

Beautiful thing is, I can eat Mexican food at any meal.  A quesadilla may not have eggs in it, but meat and cheese and all that good stuff sounds close enough to breakfast for me.  We noticed this small La Salsa situated down the end of a long, nondescript corridor, and figured it was the best that we were going to do before we went at each other's throats out of starvation.

Sat down, service was friendly.  This was by far the nicest La Salsa into which I've ever ventured... it was a proper sit-down restaurant.  Of course, the prices were higher to reflect this, but it was still a relative bargain for a restaurant on the strip.

The girl went for enchiladas, and I opted for the chipotle quesadilla.  Didn't try the enchiladas, but the chipotla quesadilla was fine... chicken, pico de gallo, guacamole, and a chipotle sauce that wasn't the worst I've ever had.  Too much cheese on the quesadilla, which was the same feedback that the girl gave on her enchiladas.  Other than that, all of the ingredients seemed pretty fresh, and the flavors weren't terrible.

I also ordered a pineapple mojito, which was pretty narsty.  It was a specialty of the house, which meant that it was premade and sitting there in a glass jar so that the pineapple flavor would infuse with the rum... tasted more like a margharita to me, or sweet and sour mix, or something... I hate sweet and sour mix.  It was overpriced too, which chapped me a bit, but hey it's Vegas.

Oh, and the bathroom had bugs in it... gross.

All in all, 2 stars.  The food was palatable if not enjoyable, the mojito was disgusting (but I still drank it for the alcohol content), but the service was fine.   I wouldn't go back, but it served its role in a pinch.  Oh, the one nice thing was that they did have a nice round center bar in the restaurant which had multiple televisions airing college football... a redeeming quality no doubt.  But still, I'll drop my bucks elsewhere.",dRZ0gVGH0EpRKgTu4wpwcQ,3,3,2,LJR1ve9iy8inFV5qkqth4A
