My coworkers and I came here once since we were close by and shared about 6 different flavors.  The wings were really well flavored, the wings were crispy and tender and the ranch (important) was excellent.

I didn't realize how addicted I was until I was on the other side of town and absolutely needed the Lemon Pepper wings in my insides.  I tried to satisfy my craving with the Buffalo Wild Wings Lemon Pepper (never again) and realized that not only was my craving not satisfied, but I had completely wasted the calories I had spent so hard burning in my morning Pilates class.

Lo and behold, I found myself making a 24 mile trip (one way, might I add) from Summerlin to the Northeast the following day looking specifically for my darling Lemon Pepper wings from Mr. Wings.  

The lemon pepper is so perfect.  The wings themselves are perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I ate all my wings and proceeded to dip my bare fingers into the leftover buttery lemon pepper at the bottom.  I'm totally not kidding.  I take my sauce very seriously.

If Mr. Wings was single... Nevermind, this review is getting weird.",bm8JuOM_H0QVostioA-PRw,8,8,5,5e3PWVGZ8gaEEM2Dm9sdeg

Used their website to figure out what we wanted, and then called in the order.  Spoke with the owner, who was very friendly and helpful with helping me decide what to get.  We ordered wings with three different sauces, all of them very delicious, but the Asian BBQ was our favorite.  Also had their Garlic Parmesan fries, which were tasty.  When I went to pick up the order, met the owner, who was very friendly, and appreciative of the business.  We highly recommend Mr. Wings!",URTRw2ZQlkFg-DnAmD70Iw,3,0,5,ZMv7nRyp_vfBDG-lj5S--Q

You can even choose how cooked you want them-regular-well-or xtra crispy. It is in a mini mart and it's not the fastest service but it is fresh and made to order. Loved the coated fries.

I ordered for take out after work and let me just say it was the worst $26 I've spent on food! first of all the woman that I spoke to was rude and had awful costumer service. that should've been my redflag but I gave them benefit of the doubt. I had a flyer with prices and menu which was totally different from what they told me over the phone, so I decided to look at their online menu and the prices and combos were different as well (false advertising) (second red flag) I ended up ordering since I was already halfway there. When I got there the place looked dead, I walked in and let her know I had a pick up. I looked around and the place looked filthy and definitely not somewhere I would regularly go, but since it was my first time and the order was ready I didn't want to be rude so I payed and left, mind you that the whole time I was there the lady had an attitude while bagging my stuff, anyways as I was getting in the car I checked my order and I was so disappointed the wings were tiny not even half of a regular wing looked like, they were super greasy and the flavors all off. I regret giving them a try at all!! I should of known from the red flag in the beginning. If you're looking for good wings in Las Vegas please avoid coming here and save your money because all you will be getting is a greasy brown paper bag with tiny wings with soggy fries(disgusting)",VB2uUIaBOBiciafGFIqmAQ,0,0,1,9DTqb6Y7c4BYxXQiiYTqhg

2720004,2015-09-21,8,II5EG0o7Y9jRZA84RBXetA,"With a name like Mr Wings, I tried not to set my expectations too high only to be disappointed. Originally, I was driving down Nellis and was thirsty so I just so happen to see this mini mart off to the right. As I pulled up, you cant help but notice the Mr Wings signage and my greatest weakness is to always find out if a wing joint is any good.

As I come in, this place kind of reminds me of Hamburger Hut off of Cheyenne just east of the I-15 in North Las Vegas. They share the same space as the mini mart. This location doesn't have any tables. Just chairs so you can wait for your order and take it to go.

I ended up ordering the 6 piece wings combo ($7.99). Comes with a half a pound of House Fries and soda. You can add a more wings for a dollar each. You have the option of flavoring your fries too for no extra charge. Flavors like garlic, garlic parmesan, lemon pepper, cajun, Jamaican jerk, salt n vinegar, seal salt and cracked pepper, Mr Bbq rub, southwest chipotle, and devil's rub. 

I got the spicy barbeque flavor for my wings. The sauce was really good. It had a little sweetness to it followed by a decent kick of spice but not too much to the point you cant enjoy your food. The wings were a decent size and was cooked properly. I think next time I will request it extra crispy because that's how I prefer my wings on a normal basis. I just forgot to request it is all. For the fries I chose the garlic parmesan flavoring. I noticed the fries were battered. Not sure if this is normal when you select a flavoring or if thats just the way the fries are. Anyways, the way it was flavored was really good. Dip it in the ranch sauce they give you and you're set. 

The only things that may have annoyed me besides the fact that everything has to be to go is that I originally wanted one of the fusion sauces (chipotle bbq which was bbq and southwest chipotle) for my wings. The lady informed me that it was two sauces so i couldnt order it. I mean honestly, how hard is to put two sauces together to form one? Technically that is one sauce when you mix it up. Lady still said no so whatever. Also after you order, they hand you the ticket order and have to go to the mini mart part to pay for it at the front counter.

Overall I am intrigued by this place. Cant wait to try all the sauces not to mention the different flavors you can get for your house fries. They also have sandwiches, wraps, chicken strips, and regular fried chicken. They are kind of in a shady part of town but dont let that stop you from coming here. Maybe come during the day?

2840422,2017-06-09,0,II5EG0o7Y9jRZA84RBXetA,I'm only giving Mr Wings 3 stars because I need to go a few more times before I just give them 5 stars. I want to try different flavors of the wings & fries before I give a solid 5. The amount of sauce that's put on the wings is great. The honey BBQ flavor taste really good. The cheese fries were very tasty. I had a side order of lemon pepper fries and they were seasoned very well. The prices were decent compared to the amount of food you buy. Overall very good Wings but I want to go again before I give 5 stars.,5mM8TI0VPyJw64XNjWlr6Q,0,0,3,KCuPLO53uiOV1tQ4AcbL8A
3102372,2018-04-25,0,II5EG0o7Y9jRZA84RBXetA,"I was on the hunt for some good wings. A coworker told me about this place so, I decided to try it out. I passed it a few times, as it is tucked away in a very small shopping center. 

Walking, in I expected a normal restaurant set up. It  was definitely different. The display counter was pretty empty except for a few salads. But I heard the wings were good and I had driven all the way over there so I  ordered.The young lady behind  the counter was very personable and told me about different things on the menu. I eventually ordered,and I was glad I did. The wings were a reasonable size and price. They were good, but nothing spectacular. 

 If  I am in the area I would visit again. However, I would not go out of my way to stop in. The wings were pretty much like every other wing place.",RuID0Cs3Q3FLkkKVfPzHFw,2,1,2,eOvFTZIFXnzty6_VWT4gdw

They don't take orders past 9pm over the phone, not  a place you want to have to wait at after you order at the store late at night because of this. I only tried their garlic Parmesan wings (you must get 12pc and up to try more sauces) and fries. Their wings were soggy and extremely greasy, the flavor is very bitter. This place is half restaurant, half corner store. When I went they had one lady working the register and she was also the one cooking the food. Definitely won't be going back here, disappointing on such an easy order smh! Definitely sticking to Sunny's Chicken and Fish for wings!

We ordered the 12 piece tender meal half honey BBQ and the other half plain and bacon cheddar fries. I do suggest not ordering plain cause you seriously only get plain. They didn't even have salt and pepper on them so you do get what you ask for. Well I guess you can pay with Ebt cause Holy hell it was busy cause it was the 1st of the month. We tipped them a 5 and paid cash for our order while all the rest of people in there paid with ebt and didn't tip anything. These people cooked y'alls dinner so at least you didn't have to slave over a stove. Y'all should have at least tipped something cause there was only one 5 dollar bill in the tip jar and that was from my husband and I... Sad!!!
