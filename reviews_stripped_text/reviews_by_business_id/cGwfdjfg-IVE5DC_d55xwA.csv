I personally had the Steak Tacos which were really good.  Real Steak was used, not just beef that was pretending to be steak.  My friend had the Orange Chicken and she said that was very good too.  The service was great.  Friendly, professional, and very timely.  Have been going there for years and found no reason to stop now.  Thank you for a great lunch to our server Stephanie and to Duffers.",wfqiSv8yVDJXNXPemA47HA,0,0,5,YZtK4kjE3jz9KRprjxxgOw

The menu is a basic menu and the prices are what you would expect from a country club without the wow factor to go along with them.  You can however still get a decent lunch and their chopped salad is quite tasty.

What this place really needs is a complete overhaul of the menu to bring it into the 21st century.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,1,1,2,JFzO4P7zdolzlzUtZSKGEw
