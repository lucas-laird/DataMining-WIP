1795260,2015-06-22,8,JuO9QpkdmbTS95GSXh4dZw,"Located at the Forum Food Court at Caesars Palace, this little express counter was actually one of the better choices.  Before deciding on this place, across the way, the cashier lady at Earl of Sandwich told me ""Someone put an order of 100 sandwiches, and are you willing to wait over 30 minutes for your order?""  Um, ""NO"" I'll go to Phillips.  

Now, as far as I know, Phillips is a well known favorite originating in the Baltimore area.  While residing in the Bay Area and being spoiled with San Francisco's seafood, this joint had better live up to the eastcoast hype.  

The two cashiers at the counter were nice and gave us samples of the clam chowder and cream of crab.  We opted for the chowder, as the cream of crab was a bit like drinking seawater.  The chowder however seemed a bit better with pieces of clams, cube cuts of potatoes, and small pieces of bacon (small cup, $6.49).  Decent, but not up to SF standards.  I didn't order a drink, but asked about the fountain drinks and was told $4.95.  Eeek, what a waste!  I'll gamble at a table and tip a dollar.  No thank you.  

We also ordered a Classic Lobster Roll ($14.99), because it's the most expensive thing on the menu board.  It's my first time, so I had to try what they're ""known for"".  Now, the cool part was seeing the meaty claw parts, and it wasn't overpowering with the mayo.  It was tasty it, but actually the kicker was the seasoned waffle fries.  I'm in agreement with all the other reviews that these were SFG, ""So Freakin' Good!""  

So in conclusion, was it a good representation for the eastcoast?  Probably so!  Would I come back here?  Probably, but only if I were at one of their real locations in Baltimore.  It's worth a try in my opinion, or you can opt to wait in the long line at Earl of freakin' 100 Sandwiches.",Wj0tIFlWz_1Uam1VDWYG5g,11,11,3,TVJfaFE1D9tvzJ2GScGvfQ

She assured me and i ordered the two crabcake basket with two orders of fries as my sides.
  At $21 the price is kinda steep (and this was with no drink).
These crabcakes were a mess.
They were at least half filler w corn meal and peppers.
We do not put peppers on our crabcakes in Baltimore/DC because we want to taste our beloved Blue Crab
Anyway what i got was a greasy mess with only a couple bites of actual lump crab meat in both cakes. Thank God I got two because the amount of crab in theae small cakes both was barely equal to one in Baltimore.
Its too expensive for what you get, its way too greasy and mushy (like defrosted frozen cakes) and the taste is just horrible (unless ur a big green and red pepper fan which I am not).

2269681,2015-09-27,3,JuO9QpkdmbTS95GSXh4dZw,"I had never seen a food court version of this Maryland seafood stalwart, but I thought, why not give it a try? It is located in the food court in Caesar's Palace, and unlike most places in the casino, the prices did not seem out of line. Unfortunately, the recurring theme of feeling cheated in Vegas continues here. 

Some choices weren't bad...the lobster roll, though the most expensive item at $15, was at least a reasonable version with plenty of large chunks of real (though bland and tough) lobster. It even came with waffle-cut fries. They did not have cream of crab any of the times I asked for it...the lobster bisque was just ok...no chunks of lobster. It kinda tasted like Costco's version. The New England Clam Chowder also tasted like it came straight from a can...inoffensive but edible. 

The real outrage were the crab cakes and the fried scallop roll. These crab cakes were not even the mediocre ones usually served at Phillips restaurants on the east coast (though they were priced like them)...no, I am pretty sure these were straight out of the box Phillips-branded frozen ""crab cakes"" sold at Costco. As a native Marylander, I was offended. The topper was the realization that the ""bargain"" scallop roll at $9 was a manifestation of the devil's science lab...they figured out a way to use surimi to fake scallops! Come on man! Bay scallops are relatively cheap...but you just had to use fake bay scallops???

Coming to Vegas in the old days, you always had an idea that they were giving you the finger behind your back...now, they do it right up in your face. Sigh.",cHZhssS9U7FXOsxUDISNVQ,2,1,2,lFitAWigencfwRwPaZdBSg

The lobster was delicious and fresh and in big clumps.

I will definitely come back next time to get my own roll! But really even sharing it is a lot of food and I am very happy :)

4052599,2016-01-30,10,JuO9QpkdmbTS95GSXh4dZw,"Phillips Seafood is one of Caesar's restaurants located in their food court.  I was hungry, got in line, and asked the cashier what she recommended.  She said that the lobster roll is really good and it's also their highest seller. That being said, I got their Mahi Mahi Sandwich with waffle fries. The sandwich looked good, but tasted like cardboard.  My meal had no taste at all with the exception of the waffle fries.  Take my advice, stay away from Mahi Mahi Sandwich. After my meal, I walked by Phillips Seafood and the cashier asked me if I enjoyed my sandwich.  I lied and told her it was okay.  Her response ""you should have gotten the lobster roll"".

Tip to Self: If there's a next time, listen to the cashier.

It's a food court so you will have to order and bring your own food to the table and clean up afterwards like any other food court. I ordered the traditional lobster roll. Our cashier was super friendly. After you order, you will get a buzzer to notify you when your food is ready. My food came out promptly. It was very noisy since it is located in the casino. The restaurant was convenient for me since I stayed at Caesars Palace. The bread was soft and buttery and you a good amount of lobster. I would recommend others to try it.

Not in the mood of eating burgers or pizza which was the choice of everyone else in the group, I regrettably decided to give Phillips Seafood a chance.
I ordered the crab soft pretzel that is described as a freshly baked pretzel with crab and cheeses.  It looked ok but it went downhill fast once I started eating it.
First there is no discernible crab flavor.  At first I thought they left out the crab by mistake but then realized the crab was shredded up and mixed into this awful cheese sauce mixture that was about 20% undetectable crab, 80% nasty cheese sauce.
Secondly, as mentioned this cheese sauce was nasty!  Even my wife who loves cheesy foods nearly gagged after having a taste.
Thirdly the pretzel was a combination of under-cooked in the interior and the nasty cheese sauce made it soggy... an inedible combination.

This was the first time in recent memory that something was so awful that I had to throw it out after a couple of bites and it would have been even fewer bites if I wasn't trying to taste the crab.",OVzD-LzAjABffv08NqP7WQ,0,0,1,XIjVowd8GEi1VGXNIujoZw

Maryland Crab cakes, Calamari, Fried Shrimp, and subbed waffle fries for Hush Puppies

The Crab cakes were not awful 
but they could have added a little Soul to the mix.

The Shrimp small and way to much breading (no flavor)
The Calamari was seasoned well!! 
But was also cooked to well.

The Hush Puppies were my absolute Fave 
good flavor compared to their counterparts but not good enough to order separate.

4758806,2017-10-07,0,JuO9QpkdmbTS95GSXh4dZw,"As I wanted a nice meal before countless hours ahead of me seeing Calvin Harris (at OMNIA Nightclub), I figure a seafood place will get the job done. Located directly in the Forum Food Court at Caesars Palace, this was the only restaurant that offered seafood. My lady and I weren't looking for a sit-down waiter type of place but something where I could go up, order, and get my food in less than 10 minutes.

This takes me to ""Phillips Seafood Express"". This is a place I have never heard of prior to coming here (even though they have a few locations in Atlantic City NJ, Baltimore MD, and Ocean City MD), I didn't really have high expectations about this place. Well this place is pretty much like a food court in a mall or airport; you go up in a very loud atmosphere, pay an inflated amount of dough, and wait until your order is ready.

Since my lady decided on ordering Mexican food at nearby ""La Gloria"",  I was the only one dining here. I ended up ordering their ""Classic Lobster Roll"" (for $17.99). This roll includes a basket of waffle fries. I also opt for just a soda (which is an insanely expensive $4.49) and total for this came out to about $24. Ouch! Service is forgettable as the cashiers remind me of kids working at the mall. I was given a pager and my meal (w/drink) arrives in about 10 minutes.

I must say, I was not satisfied with my lobster roll at all. There were only bits and pieces of the lobster while it was smothered in too much of the tarragon mayonnaise while there was too much damn lettuce. The roll itself was decent but when you're primarily eating bread, mayo, and lettuce, it doesn't add up to a quality meal. The only thing this place really had going for it was their waffle fries as these were crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside.

I do have to say this you definitely do NOT get your money's worth on the lobster roll for nearly $20. I would save your money and take your $20 to a nearby slot machine to see if you have luck winning. I understand that this is a tourist trap area but c'mon guys, be generous with the lobster! And make it tasty so us out-of-towners leave happy! Anyhow, there are WAY better places to dine at this food court (and at Caesars Palace for that matter).

Crab is not JUST crab: it's a crab cake. So don't come in thinking you're getting crab legs. The cake was alright, to be honest. There's big chunks of crab mixed with what tastes like hushpuppy. Their coleslaw, shrimp, and fries, however, are what made it for me.

With a platter, you get the option for 2 sides. I chose the waffle fries and coleslaw. Both were amazing: short and simple. I'd highly recommend it. The butterfly shrimp was very, very succulent. Served with tartar and cocktail sauce, the pairing is amazing. 

What dropped this from a four was the service. The cashier was great. The cooks, however, forgot to add shrimp to my order. I paid about $18 for a hefty plate of food, and, upon receiving it, there was only a small crab cake and fries. I ended up having to wait a while for the cashier to yell at the cooks about messing up.

It's not a full version of the restaurant, it's an Express, but still worthy.

A nice little food court, new since I've been here last.  Phillips is surrounded in good company: Starbucks, Smashburger, Earl of Sandwich, Di Fara Pizza, Graeter's Ice Cream (from Ohio), Tiger Wok & Ramen, and La Gloria Street Foods of Mexico.  Try them all and you'll have quite the bellyful.

When my eyes became focused on the menu overhead, like a dart, it went to the Lobster Roll.  A short wait of 10 mins seemed like a lifetime, and, there it was.  A bounty of lobster atop a buttered roll with a side of waffle chips.  The lobster roll was a good 7"" long with lots of glorious meat.
