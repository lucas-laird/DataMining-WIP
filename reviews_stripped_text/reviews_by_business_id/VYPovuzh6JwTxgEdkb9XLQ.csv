Its not clean their is trash on the floor and homeless people just relaxing inside i would not say its the best place if you just want to stop by and grab a bite to eat.",WcXBt-APgT3e75XlVMmgBw,0,0,2,wAzaUrwwxPsaHVxuwjUHlw

I cannot get it taken off my charges and now I have to drive 20 minutes back to get 3 cinnamon twist...  When I talk to Regina and asked if I can get anything extra because of my troubles, she responds with I can only give you a drink... you have failed to give me the proper order multiple times. I'm tired of this Taco Bell they always fail never coming back here again.  This is not the 1st time this has happened but this is the 1st time I am posting. Next time make your customer happy.",_Lh-pOke6f8p_lCu_hU-0Q,0,0,1,KOJJYA2MOD0CQ1nSKUzxzg
5994756,2017-04-18,0,VYPovuzh6JwTxgEdkb9XLQ,I am not happy about my service. I have just gotten off from work and I came to Taco Bell at 9:50 and when through drive thru. Waited about 10 minutes for someone to take my order. The employees were just standing around on their phones. Didn't even bother to ask if I wanted any sauce.,tZY_eLrL233Dil1ULdfnJQ,0,0,1,gKiFgWh8GCYBaS1-XUqZJg
