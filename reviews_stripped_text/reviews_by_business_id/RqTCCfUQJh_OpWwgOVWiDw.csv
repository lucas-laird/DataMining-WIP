At 4.50 they were pricey - but about on par for anything you'd get on the strip.  The coffee was actually about normal starbucks prices and delicious.  I would have liked some decaf options but I'm probably one of the only humans that isn't wanting caffeine after a long day/night.  My companions ordered breakfast sandwiches and seemed to like them ok as well.

Stop in for a quick snack, but I venture that you'll get better food elsewhere if you can actually take the time to sit down.",MCGahLrPr72FvXfC8cA3NA,0,0,3,ovwgmJERx2fChMQ5uf5nYw

The people working there are just not efficient at all. 

Recommend going somewhere else!!",BUErzPRxAEVwEG0pekE8oQ,0,0,1,QKHVcFPQ-SNrnFvmHtpGaQ
4837942,2010-08-19,0,RqTCCfUQJh_OpWwgOVWiDw,we stopped in for a quick sandwich for lunch.  i got a cuban sandwich and my wife got a turkey sandwich.  they were about 7 or 8 bucks and are a good sized sandwich.  service was quick enough i had no issues with that.  i liked my sandwich.  all sandwiches are heated up and warm which i always enjoy.  i wouldnt make a special trip to go get the sandwich but if you're near tropicana and need a quick bite it serves that purpose.  i would get another cuban if we were around,ix_tXZM570tHdTdwsAhkqw,1,0,4,LBRn57VpT-n_ZXirir6VBw
