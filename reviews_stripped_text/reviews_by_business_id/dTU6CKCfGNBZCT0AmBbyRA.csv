40593,2017-08-08,0,dTU6CKCfGNBZCT0AmBbyRA,"First and last time eating at this location. I'm not one to give bad reviews but for this place I have to. 

I ordered 2 sausage egg mcmuffin and 1 apple pie. There were about 4-5 customers who received their orders before I did. After 10 minutes I tell the guy at the front that I never got my order. 4 minutes later I get my 2 sausage egg mcmuffins but he tells me the apple pie won't be ready for 2 more minutes. I had to wait another 8 minutes before it was ready. It took me a total of 22 minutes before I got all of my food items. 

Whenever I order an apple pie at other McDonalds locations and they're still in the process of making them, the cashier will tell me how long the wait time will be, but the guy working in the front did not tell me that. 

Also didn't like the service here. When I told the guy in front that I never received my order he didn't apologize for the mixup and when I got my order he did not thank me for waiting. 

Definitely would not recommend eating at this location.",C6i0MavSigOvpG-nFUVA3A,1,1,1,bdXU3tWNh3rVgfl-hE912Q

WTF????). Cars were honking ferociously behind me. now i'm blocked in.  low and behold when i move up, i recognize the guy handing me my food as one of the mcdonald's workers who stepped over my pile of food in slow-motion matrix effect yesterday morning.  ughhh!  guess they're probably hiring at this fast food establishment and will take any dreggs off the street who either has a pulse or a trust fund, so what's the hurry?  Gave them a 2nd chance, learned my lesson, won't ever go back.

I just never know if I'm going to get what I ordered correctly or if it will taste normal or reheated. I have been getting coupon books in the mail that have been good deals.

With so many other dining options in the area, I wonder why they don't pay attention to the reviews and step up their game.  Today, I went through the drive thru - which is always the slowest around (average of about 5 mins in line - longest time was 11 minutes).  Today was the 4th time in a month that I've been through the drive thru and my order was wrong or incomplete.  I'm only one person, how many other people does this happen to.

This morning, I went to the drive thru about 6:10am, lucky since I was the only one in line.  Placed my order, but could tell the person taking my order was distracted.  Got to the payment window, where the person dropped my change on the ground, ugh.  Next window, pick up food.  Here is the entire conversation: 
Me:  Can I get some Mayonnaise and Salt? 
MD's:  Mayonnaise?  (as he is chatting with a co-worker and not listening to me.
Me: Yes, Mayonnaise and Salt.
MD's: OK.  (Still chatting it up with co-worker)
MD's:  That was Mayonnaise and Jelly?
Me: No.  Mayonnaise and Salt.

UGH!!  Pay attention!  

Needless to say, I got to work and order was incomplete.  Frustrated, I got back in my car, drove back to restaurant and went inside.  Talked to a manager or assistant (couldn't tell, as they had no nametag), but they were very uninterested in the fact that a customer had an issue.  

I explained that it had happened 4 times in last month, still no reaction.  No concern, NO APOLOGY.    He proceeded to get my other item, but was not going to replace the current one I brought back.  Since it was now a cold item, I had to ask to get a replacement.

I mentioned again that this is the 4th time in a month that this had happened to just me, but again, no apology, no concern, and no reaction.  

Worst customer service of any restaurant I've ever been in.  It seems to me that they need to be reading these reviews and try to improve.  

I will be sending a copy of this review to McDonald's corporate office, because if they are not already aware of how bad this store is, they need to be.",nTGPIseYL1KiIpi7ZelVNQ,4,1,1,HPtMA6MPj1srXUvnrjKFJw

This location is the only one near my house and recently remodeled... I had hoped that remodle would fix the issues, but apperantly remodeling doesn't train inept employees.  This latest and greatest screw up was this morning... a quick stop through the drive thru to grab breakfast for me and a 5 year old... all I ordered was 2 Sausage McMuffins with egg and 2 hashed browns... $6 and change.. it actualy went quicly today which was surprising as this fast food is usually anything but.... paid, got my bag and we are back at our house in no time... we sit down to eat and guess what?  I have 2 hashed browns and ONE sandwich... that's right.. a SUPER simple order and they couldn't put 4 items in a bag.

I worked fast food back in the day... I worked in food service for over 25 years... I know things happen, we're all human... but with I have to believe that I am not the only one having trouble here.. and taht is verified by their really low review score on here... in a year (since I moved here) I must have had 40% of my visits end badly... missing food items, wrong orders, horrible food (ever have a big mac where the bottom bun actually crunches its so old?  I have) and REALLY long waits in drive thru... if all this has happened to me in a year it has to be the norm at this place.

I mean it's pretty simple.. look at a screen, grab TWO of the same breakfast sandwiched, Grab 2 hashed browns... that's it! 

So now I'm home... am I going to load the 5 year old back into the car and waste my gas and time to drive back to get a $2 sandwich?  No... so I call them.. first call I get a mechanical message that they arent available and to leave a message... guess they were busy ripping off and dissapointing other customers... How hard is it to train your people to, oh I don't know, maybe DOUBLE CHECK AN ORDER!??!!?  So I called again and got an answer... now I will say that the woman on the phone who said she was one of the managers was flustered, but nice and the first words out of her mouth was ""I am sorry"" which goes a long way for me... in fact that is the reason for a 2 star instead of 1 star rating... She said that I could come back and get the missing item or come in any day for it...  Fool me once, shame on you.. fool me 12 times, no way in hell I'm going back there... I will drive the other direction and 3 times as far to go to a different location from now on... 

I know this review won't stop you from going here.. but hopefullly you can learn and check your order befofre you leave... complain about poor quality food, let them know their employees are incompetent... Burger King isn't sounding so bad now, right?

4/2/18 EDIT: Reduced to 1 star.  Wife went through drive thru on her way to work and ordered a large coke... that's all. She got the the first window and they asked what she ordered because they ""Forgot to put it in""... so she told them and paid... the car in front of her had some sort of problem with their order so she had to wait well over 3 minutes extra.... she finally got the the second window got her drink and left, now late for work due to the delay... and.. her drink was a DIET coke... 

It's almost like we are being punk'd... how can EVERY visit be atotal screw up.. and how do you get a single drink order wrong after screwing up taking the order in the first place?  Just wrote corporate... this is crazy!

4/19/18 UPDATE: got a voicemail from someone wanting more information. Private number, no call back number left, whatever.  Today's fail... drive thru... order 2 x sausage egg & cheese muffins, 2 x bacon egg and cheese biscuits, 3 hash browns and a large diet coke. Order taken was okay.  Paid... nothing horrible... got did pretty quick... got home.  Bag 1: 2 sausage, egg & cheese muffins... CHECK.... 3 hash browns... CHECK... bag 2... pancakes and sausage with all the fixin's... FAIL.. Soda, cherry coke... FAIL... my order was all I one big plastic bag, the pancakes on the bottom with the paper bag on top of it... the hash browns were in to of the now grease soaked napkins. 

I jusy don't understand how many of my orders can be so wrong... to be fair there have been a few visits between these last two I wrote about here where everything was okay,  nothing great but at least I got all the right food items... but the percentage of right orders to incorrect orders is still really low...  the saga continues.",VCCvYbQ1-mkUSTRGuG2xSQ,0,0,1,dGF-BPmX61vUi_IZ7ojdnQ

3943294,2011-07-25,0,dTU6CKCfGNBZCT0AmBbyRA,"Years of pathetic service, disgusting food, and dangerous mistakes. Why do I keep going back?

Having nothing to do with Mcdonalds food in general and more to do with the ability of this specific location to produce it with out killing anybody. I have been going to this particular store for years. It is right around the corner from where I used to live, and is on the way from where I live to pretty much everything I use (gas station, costco, movie theater, market, etc). It is the only convenient location, and for a while Mcdonalds was the only place that had $1 drinks. So those are my lame excuses for repeatedly torturing myself with this horrible place! 

Service: I used to be a manager with another fast food chain. I know what service SHOULD be. I also know what it usually is. It doesn't have to be 5 star. But the rude attitudes, ridiculously slow service, and inability to get a single order right is really a bit too much. When I say slow service, I am talking 15 minutes is average drive thru time for a dollar menu burger and a soda. 

Correct orders: Yes, my order can occasionally be complicated (no castup, add big mac sauce)... but when I thought they could do no worse... they messed up an order for 4 large drinks. 2 diet cokes, a lemonade, and an unsweet iced tea (all with extra ice). We received a regular coke, a lemonade, a Dr. Pepper, and a sweet iced tea. 2 drinks had no ice at all. and the other 2 had a few pieces floating around. We have never received a correct order from this store. EVER. I could go on and on about it, but I will stick with this sad example and move on.

Dangerous/disgusting/incorrectly made: Something a little different then an order where they put the wrong thing in the bag or mess up a custom, is when they just make it incorrectly or dangerously. Some of the examples of this include pies that expired an hour before I received them, an egg that was completely raw in the middle, and tonights lovely mess up. Tonight I ordered the Angus Mushroom and Swiss. According to the website this should include 2 full slices of swiss cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms. I had about a teaspoon of mushrooms, no sauce, and 1/2 a slice of cheese. That is right, they left off a slice and a half of cheese! In addition, it was a regular (and relatively old) quarter pound patty, not the big ole angus patty they should have used. 

I have called the number on the receipt multiple times that takes me to the district office. They consistently send out a free sandwich or drink coupon to apologize. They tell me how sorry they are and suggest I try one of their other locations, as this is the only one they receive complaints from. From what I was told they are revamping this store, but I have been told that for well over a year, and it seems to have been unvamped and going down hill, which I didn't think was even possible! 

I keep vowing this will be my last visit, but then find myself sitting in the drive thru line yet again wondering if I will ever receive my food. 

I highly do not recommend this location. Hopefully you won't be lured in by whatever the heck keeps luring me!

He treated me as if I was trying to rip them off over a 80 cent difference. He talked down to me and refused to correct the order, even after I handed him my card to pay the difference.

I am truthfully starting to think that the work staff does things on purpose to keep customers from coming back.  I come in every morning to purchase various items and always a cold drink...(I gave up going through the drive- thru, too many errors every day). So, you would think the cold drink machine would hopefully work....(No)....They continually are out of the pods that dispense the drinks...Really! Now this morning the new thing is you MUST get your cold drink from the drive-thru because half of the desired flavors are NOT inside ..only thru drive-thru.  Only Coke, Diet Coke and Fanta can be obtained inside.  Its bad enough a customer is forced to Automate ordering but after automate order,  then you cannot get your drinks unless you wait in line, get a cup and give it back to the work staff to take it to drive-thru for them to dispense the cold drink.  Owners should have their franchise license removed for the way they run these stores. And, on a even more serious problem the BUG COMPANY is spraying bug spray during daytime customer hours around open food and cold coffee drinks.  I have personally witnessed that at this location around OPEN FOOD and COLD COFFEE DRINKS.

Now up until recently I worked in the food industry for 14 years as a manager and I understand the reason for these time frames for breakfast and lunch, but at 5 minutes till I can get a wrap so I can make it to my office with lunch on time? I asked the order taker if they could please help me out it was only 5 minutes and they flat out refused. OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE GUYS!! Won't be going back.

Over the last year it has gotten much better when workers Brian and his twin brother are working. Always friendly with excellent customer service.We always feel pretty lucky when either one of them or both are working.

Restaurant was clean given the amount of people that were there (lunch hour) . Michael H. was friendly and efficient when taking our order.I appreciated that he even took a moment to smile for a picture.

My order was right, yay! I attribute this to Brian working today .Overall I give this McDonalds 3 stars because depending on day or staff it can go either way really quick!

This McDonald's location would have gotten 5 stars about 3 months ago, but things have changed. A few months ago, the workers were really cool, but now they have all just gotten really f*cking weird! It's almost like one of those 1980s B-Horror Movies where one of the workers gets infected with the Zombie/Vampire/Werewolf virus and then comes to work the next day and spreads it to all his coworkers.  That's the only logical explanation because every worker here has transformed into McDumbasses!

I want to remind you that this is Summerlin, so that means that everyone runs stop signs, no one yields for pedestrians,  and everyone argues over the stupidest most insignificant things. Watch out when you are entering this drive-thru because there is a huge chance that some douchebag in a BMW will run the stop sign in order to cut in front of you.

When I drove up to the box, there was no answer. About 2 minutes later I begin hearing a ton of static and then this bizarre sounding guy starts talking in this strange tone. He sounded like a drunk Orson Wells. 

When I pulled up to the first window to pay, the window slowly slid open to reveal the face of a morbid looking kid with gigantic dilated eyes and one of those horror movie smiles. Immediately he lets out this high pitched: ""reeehhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"" noise at me. At that particular moment, due to the fear of man-rape, I thought about driving over the planters and escaping. But, he looked so weird that I came to the conclusion that he might have some kind of paranormal super powers and would catch me no matter how fast I drove, so I just sat there and awaited my fate. After about 2-3 seconds he told me how much my coffee cost in a disturbingly soft tone voice, and thankfully he didn't serve me McRape.  

When I drove up to the pick-up window, I was greeted by an anorexic looking latino kid who didn't even give me eye contact, and while holding the coffee he sticks his arm out the window and just drops it before I even have the chance to reach out to grab it. It was a miracle that I caught the thing in mid air.
