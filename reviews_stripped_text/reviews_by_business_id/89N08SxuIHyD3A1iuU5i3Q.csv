Kudos to the chef - look forward to ordering again/visiting soon!",_awJA8fVVNyOnQ4vmvDT5A,0,0,5,gcfttq657Umen-4ibYwskQ
1344917,2018-05-14,0,89N08SxuIHyD3A1iuU5i3Q,"This is the toughest review I have ever tried to write.  I really, really liked this place.  The food was quite good and a great value, the front and inside decor was cool, the place was clean, and the owner was a great guy.  But it is in a dive of a neighborhood, attached to what appears to be an abandoned motel. On my walk a few blocks north from my hotel (the Stratosphere), I don't think I passed anyone not passed out (and it was only 6:00 PM!).  If I was local, I would try to stop here and support a local business periodically.  But I certainly would not take my wife, and therefore I can't recommend this as a place to eat on a vacation to Vegas, which has so many interesting, if pricier, options. 

I had the Ribs special with 3 very meaty, flavorful ribs, Peas and Rice (really black beans and rice) flavored with coconut and very good, and sweet potato fries, which were great when dipped in the barbeque sauce (and fine otherwise)  All for $14.00 with a supermarket brand Ginger Beer (which was much better that the foo-foo Ginger beers I don't buy anymore0.

The place was hard to find, since the sign had blown down in a windstorm a few days earlier, but the owner knew somebody from Virginia was stalking his restaurant (had no clue Yelp offered that capability to owners), so he came out to find me.  I was the only one there initially, and the owner/chef/server treated me very well, but also gave me my space to eat.  Later, he seemed to have a business meeting with somebody, but remained attentive.  

I really liked him, really liked the food, really liked the place, and really hope he succeeds, but want my review to be good guidance for others.  If you live in Vegas or are there for an extended period of time with a car, definitely drive there and give this place is try.  Great value meal.  If you are on an expenses-paid business trip like many people visiting Vegas seem to be, you can probably stay closer to your hotel and have just as a good a meal which your company will pay for.",rSivZFwSo0FCvw2DQUYezw,1,0,4,f8gqKwqgA4rzfwHvb985RQ
1724385,2018-05-04,0,89N08SxuIHyD3A1iuU5i3Q,This place will blow you away! My coworkers and I had been eating out for two weeks at what we thought were some great dinner spots in Southern California till we ate here. The bbq is fantastic and the laid back atmosphere is perfect to unwind and enjoy!,P8hQD_VHNernQZWIf5xQZg,1,0,5,SrcCGyexRpaHX49W77BM8A

I like the location, very downtown, in front of Boston Pizza. This new mom and pops shop has much potential, I look forward to return.",N5fBd1-WiuP1E_9Rs94EKA,0,0,5,N8zy-u_OpJJ9DssS0dITrg

While they haven't quite ironed out a set menu or pricing, the chef was kind enough to prepare some dishes for us according to our preferences. Since I'm a carnivore, I had ribs and pulled pork. The ribs had a nice flavor but I was partial to the tender pulled pork. Our son had a large bowl of lobster mac n cheese which he loved. My wife had catfish (freshly made) with steamed and grilled vegetables (cauliflower, zucchini, broccoli, red bell pepper, and carrots) and a bowl of greens. She says the greens were expertly seasoned. 
The space is huge and clean. There are board games and a chess set already there. The space would be great for business dinner presentations, large parties catered in-house, or meetups especially board game meetups.
It can be a little hard to find and get to because you can't reach it from Las Vegas Boulevard. You'll have to turn off on Wyoming. The restaurant's physical location is right on Utah and Third Street. We wish Sin City Soul Deli the best. You can tell the chef and owner put a lot of love into it with all of the original artwork and painted exposed air duct ceilings. We'll likely be back once they iron out a set menu with pricing. To be fair, he charged us super reasonably ($30 for dinner for three including fish, pork, lobster, beef ribs, sides, and drinks).
Sin City Soul Deli is a welcome addition to Naked City/the neighborhood. They concentrate a lot of their business on catering and events at the moment. If you go in, they will feed you well so long as you remain open-minded about a limited menu for now. We were craving jerk chicken and plantains and though those items weren't available, what we got was ultimately much better.",geQNS__22w8hgN6PXgd5WQ,5,2,4,Eu-K85VesLsgbjsms7KbaA

Called Chef Will to confirm his hours and was treated like family from the start. 
To say that the food was great is an understatement, to quote Chef Will,it's not about me,it's about the food,truer words have never been spoken.
The brisket is the best I've ever had and we're talking about 52 years of eating and barbecuing. 
The sides were very generous,tasty and more than enough for the party 4 we came with.
The ribs were off the chain,meaty,juicy and the overall presentation was great.
To sum it up,Sin City Soul Food is a hidden gem that needs and deserves to be discovered. 
Sorry for the pic but the food was so good we were killing it,so not much to show.
Give the place a chance,you won't regret it.",_qdRWp0dgICOVHdJCYhavw,1,2,5,WFmrr-Yxe6zPSrsdBoG4jQ

They don't really have a set menu, just a blackboard.

We loved the Mac and cheese and Caribbean bbq 0sandwich. Come support local downtown Vegas!

Only to find the doors locked Saturday night at 8pm, when yelp states they close at 11pm! Is it too much to ask for businesses to state their hours on their voicemail recording?",hAhxZjIbAZWRFEBy7xY20w,0,0,1,dtcvrfvDYwtl-_JnFRlOrQ
