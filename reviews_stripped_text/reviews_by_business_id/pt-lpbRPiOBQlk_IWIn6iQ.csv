110928,2014-12-24,0,pt-lpbRPiOBQlk_IWIn6iQ,Excellent cookies. I ordered a small white chocolate latte and it's very good. Lots of kids and a park with picnic benches and small tables with chairs. Wish there was a no-smoking enforcement though.,31lroadUtKm78zMLHcy9OA,1,0,4,yD_Wbh3HZkApF-xKX0RTuw

Cookies these days are still pretty much the same everywhere so as for taste it didn't exceed any expectations, nor did it not. However the price $9 for 3 (technically 4 but it was buy 3 get 1 free) cookies seemed drastic and expensive! I haven't bought cookies like this in awhile (usually from the grocery) is that normal??? If so, holy moly how do they stay in business??? The cookies aren't made out of gold flour are they?

I will say the smore cookie was good but super sweet. It was a normal size but I only ate half, wasn't trying to go into sugar shock.

Anyways, they were satisfactory at the least. Don't think I'll go back tho, I can wait and stop by the grocery next time.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,8,7,2,f6dsVXgYXWe54L6GapCRYA

The lady who works there is super nice, older woman with brown wavy hair. She made me a couple cookie sundaes and they were yummy! two scoops of ice cream, some chocolate, a topping of your choice and a little cookie. They were perfect for us on a hot day. 

Its a little pricey but you can find something for everyone. Cookies, icee, smoothies, shakes, ice cream.",KMddoqBFJ2h9AYbaetprFg,4,1,5,s5r4PYkKyXmFQU4pvFfKeg

Its difficult to do a cookie wrong, but i must say they got the cookie making right 100% here. The peanut butter chocolate chip is by far my favorite. I could have eaten 6 of those things. The small location is perfectly located next to the kids play area. What's better then running around, having fun, then grubbing on delicious soft cookies. Im all about the sugar overload.",FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ,1,0,5,NsQMfsHuYmlTxF3809MIkg
2952374,2017-12-31,0,pt-lpbRPiOBQlk_IWIn6iQ,"Staff has severe attitude problems. Staff said they would come out with the food we ordered (we both heard that clearly so there was no misunderstanding), then when we had waited for so long that something had to be wrong, we went back in and they said they never said they would take it out, and gave it to us in a plastic bag.

Please note that I have absolutely nothing against homosexuals so that is not the issue here. He had something against us but I cant for the life of me understand what it could have been. He ran the card twice and the first time it said no app. My only theory is that the first was a demand for tipping and because I did not tip he decided to screw up our order.

I asked him if all other locations charged for cups and he said HE DIDNT KNOW but he just charged me for it. $2 for empty small plastic cup.

If i were rating everything else including service and prices I would give them  4 stars. In was very disappointed in the cake. It taste nothing like the cookies which are phenomenal( if you have a sweet tooth). Once it gets cold and is no longer fresh and I mean as soon as its done being made, it no longer taste good. The prices are good for the cakes but I would definitely prefer the cookies! They have buy 5 cookies get 1 free and a whole cup of mini chocolate chip cookies for 5.99!",JcNSd3dXmIMVHP2CUpvMHA,3,0,3,JLbWHwuZsKMXR0jq4iA8AA

5286394,2017-12-31,1,pt-lpbRPiOBQlk_IWIn6iQ,"That's right, three stars for cookies. 
It's one of those free standing kiosk type things in TS, yes it's enclosed BUT they don't have just cookie dough!  Baked, yes smells wonderful. However, I'm a cookie dough eater! 
Choose your cookie and they even heat it up for you. Reheat, yes not hot and freshly baked out of the oven.  Perhaps at times, but timing is everything. 
Pleasant, energetic staff- think sugar high people:)
Nicely decorated cookies, a good variety and sadly I usually only have one. I need my cookie dough!
Got cookie dough? That's not baked that is ha!",CZs1Eq7t1fqpXV1yox-CVg,2,1,3,gDcEb3HLvy3oohfBIdMecQ
5531265,2016-01-04,1,pt-lpbRPiOBQlk_IWIn6iQ,"Was walking through with my family and saw this cute little desert/coffee hut, went to have dinner and skipped desert just so we could go back here to get desert. Looked and smelled good and that's where everything good ended... The coffee was 10x worse than the scuzziest truck stop and approximately 250% more expensive (which would be fine if it was real coffee and not hot water/flavor powder mix). My sister and I threw ours away and my wife had sent my son in to ask to switch the drink to something else and Miguel was rude to him... Thinking that my 12 year old didn't really know how to deal with the situation I went in to talk to Miguel. He was so unbelievably rude. I simply asked to trade the ""coffee"" for a bottle of water or something and all he could tell me was that he couldn't do it because of company policy. So I asked if he had a manager and he said ""it's only me right now"" then I asked if his manager was going to be there for the next few days and he informed me that he would be the only manager there...  As someone who is in the customer service business, I was truly disgusted. I know that Miguel has a boss and that he or she reads this...",3011SEdceFsF4R_Gq4fdnA,3,0,1,OZDgY4Id9CnuzePNe5Gxfw
