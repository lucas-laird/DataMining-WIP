Beyond the extraordinary food (creative recipes, fresh dishes, beautiful presentation, exciting flavors, new twists on standards) the service is warm, friendly, professional, and all of the people I met there were really cool and nice. Green beans are generally my least favorite vegetable (on account of them being boring and flavorless) but somehow they made green beans that made me actually gasp with pleasure! They were extremely accommodating of my vegetarianism (made me special flat-breads without meat). When I ate the Brussels sprouts I may have shed a few tears when it occurred to me that I couldn't continue to eat them for the remaining moments of my lifetime. 

Summary: Go to here. Eat many food.",fKtk0Z_qk2PG5MGfx1rw4w,1,0,5,JrgezrVlMYJCEuxaIpZbew

59938,2015-03-19,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"After my second mediocre experience here, I thought I better write up a review. This place has tons of hype which may be why I found it so disappointing.  

Ambiance - There are only 4 actual tables at this restaurant all the other seating is at group dining bars where your legs dangle while you sit in their uncomfortable bar chairs. The first time I ate here we were seated at the actual bar and while it was very loud in the restaurant I was able to enjoy my friends company.   On my second trip here we were seated at the shared table across from a couple who had their tongues down each other's throat the whole time and a father who was lecturing his daughter loudly on how to make it in the business world and she ""better shape up or ship out"".  I understand this is not within the restaurants control however I would certainly prefer to have an option rather than shared dining but as a party of two we were not afforded that luxury. 

Service - The first visit they were busy but by sitting at the bar we were able to flag down the bartender to get our orders relatively fast. The second visit I arrived first and my server asked if I would like to wait to order, I informed him I would order before my companion arrived but I needed a minute to look over the menu. After waiting for him to return for some time I turned awkwardly around from my place at the bar extension to place my order for a drink with the bartender. My drink arrived but still no server so again I ordered our appetizer from the bar. The place was busy but there was plenty of servers and I spent the rest of the dinning experience hunting down my server. When it came time to pay I ended up getting off the horrible chair to just find someone to pay so that I no longer had to sit on those horrid chairs and I could get out of there. 

Food - The first trip we ordered:
Jalapeno Poppers - Delicious, I recommend them highly
Baked Mac & Cheese - Excellent if not a bit on the small side
Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto - Such high hopes, but way over salted and the rice was not cooked it was crunchy

Second and last trip:
Bacon Jam - Zero flavor, the best part was the bread
Roasted young beets - meh nothing special here at all
Pork Belly Carbonara- Again high hopes only to be let down, the pork was fine but nothing special the pasta was mediocre

The uncomfortable seating, small pretentious menu and awful service will keep me from coming back.",oisQ6O_uV70PhWLqaNhbIg,3,0,2,0clHOZbISukyYbjmInniQQ
76656,2015-12-27,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"My husband and I had the bacon jam and turkey burger. Both were great. The bacon jam was super rich. We could not finish it despite its amazingness! I recommend the bacon jam if you have a larger group of people than two or can take it to go. Since we were staying at a hotel room with no fridge, we sadly had to kiss our bacon jam goodbye. The turkey burger was great! I eat a lot of turkey burgers, and rarely are they that juicy and flavorful. My husband thought it was too fennel tasting, but I had absolutely no issue. It came with some crunchy tarot tots that were nice and dry, not oily at all. 

Wait staff was good. decorations are fun. Communal tables are a bit different, but we made friends! I would definitely try this place again. If you are staying near Fremont street experience, do yourself a favor and venture a few blocks off the path. Good stuff!",-ySiPZ61Z_VRrG4Jj2Jf8A,0,0,4,EPgMEo3sSmqeQLI3mm23bg

Roughly a 10 minute walk from Fremont street, staff were super friendly and although there was a short wait, we enjoyed really good drinks in a comfortable outdoor waiting area. We scored seats on the upstairs outdoor balcony and proceeded to completely overeat. The deviled eggs w/caviar: INCREDIBLE, get them. Bacon jam with Brie: DELICIOUS, get it. Barbecue burnt ends: OMG how could it keep getting better?! Our mistake: the mac and cheese. If you've never had good mac and cheese, go for it. If you have, skip it. It's very rich and frankly doesn't live up to the tremendous hype (but considering all we ordered, we should have opted for something lighter like the cous cous or cauliflower). That said, between the staff, charming location and amazing spread, we couldn't have been happier. Plan on sharing whatever is ordered and go!",gf1PO8nuPzfeSL_V1R0bdw,1,1,5,PzBdWsPHd9kLOpijH35XXw

I know it's on practically every review here, but if you stop reading this review after this paragraph... get the bacon jam. Seriously. Bacon jam. Bacon jam. Bacon jam. I was hoping it'd appear in front of me.

On our last visit, we had the opportunity to sit at the seats right in front of the kitchen. I was initially a bit apprehensive about being next to the hustle and bustle, but wow. It was a totally unique experience, chatting with the staff about the dishes and watching the synchronicity of a well-managed kitchen. On top of the bacon jam, we had the cauliflower appetizer as well, both of which were delicious (but if you have to choose between these two, get the bacon jam, seriously). For my main course I got the fried chicken sandwich, which was prepared just right. Plus, the tots - delicious!

I gotta say, I've never spent so much money in my life at a restaurant, and left so hungry. I don't feel like I'm a cheap person when it comes to food, I'm really willing to go all out for a special occasion, but we spent nearly $60 here and left seriously very hungry. I'd be happy with the expense if it was amazing food, but it was just.... Meh. I got the seared scallops and they were cold and sort of fishy. And it was literally 3 bites of food, so I sort of felt like a fool for working out all week and saving up my calories. Only reason I'm leaving 2 stars was the drink I ordered was just superb. I don't often order cocktails but it was worth every penny and I loved it. Food was very.... Meh.

109892,2014-08-24,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Carson Kitchen embodies the spirit of the new downtown Las Vegas to the fullest.  

The dining room; Just like DTLV is trying to create a sense of community, this restaurant is bringing a style of dining I have yet to see in Las Vegas, family style dining. This type of dining encourages conversation between complete strangers and usually ends up creating an atmosphere welcoming to all. An atmosphere some may say is similar to that of DTLV.  

The food; DTLV is a place where trends come to be seen, the same can be said for Carson Kitchen for food trends. However, instead of being safe with food trends, they take trends and put their own twist on them. For example, they have fried chicken skins with their own spicy honey sauce, oxtail risotto, and bacon jam. All of which were delicious and simply addicting, especially the bacon jam (believe the hype).

Was looking to grab some lunch and remembered seeing this place the day before while having a doughnut next door (I'm talking to you O Face) so thought I'd give it a try. Sat at the bar and had a microbrew root beer while looking over the menu (too early for me to start on the ""non-root""  beer!) The staff was friendly and when I asked for a recommendation that I could sink my teeth into they offered up the NY Strip Steak. I was looking for some comfort food as as a ""side-dish"" so I also ordered the Baked Mac & Cheese.

You ever have a meal that after the first bite you get sad because it's so good and you realize that at some point it's going to be all gone? This was one of those meals! I enjoyed and savored every bite because I knew at some point my food would be all gone and and I'd have to come back down to reality!

The only downside was it would be nice if the steak came with a side. I was by myself so it cost more than I was planning to spend on lunch. Recommend going with a few people so that you can order and split a few entrées and social dishes.",fv0ztLKB1WwFmF3wYecbIg,0,0,4,boDYWjQs9kx1-9d8rLq0mw

306556,2015-01-24,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"We ate at Carson Kitchen last night and loved it!  Great local spot in downtown Vegas with well-executed cocktails and tasty food.  We arrived a bit early for dinner and we were greeted and seated right away.  We were seated at the high top table right next to the bar and shared our table with several other groups.  I liked seeing the items our table neighbors were ordering.  There are a few ""alone"" tables if people prefer not eating with a crowd of strangers.  

We ordered the Gyro Tacos ($10) made with a generous portion of well seasoned ground lamb topped with just enough tzatziki, cucumber, and tomato. Usually this dish comes three to a plate, however our gracious server suggested we add one more taco to have an even split between us.  Glad we agreed! Really enjoyed this item. 

We also split the Jerk Turkey Burger ($14) This item was topped with mango chutney slaw and served with a small cylinder filled with tater tots.  The burger was cooked just right and had a nice spicy afterburn from the jerk seasoning.  We love slaw and the slaw topping on this burger provided a nice acidic pairing to the spiced burger patty.  

As far as the cocktails, we both ordered a ""Towns End"" ($10) which was served in a lowball glass with a giant round ice cube, I'll upload a picture.  Being whiskey and bourbon lovers, we found this cocktail to be excellent.  

Last but not least was desert, we tried a sweet potato pie dish served in a short mason jar with a crispy marshmallow topping and two very tasty cranberry biscotti on the side.  I liked the pie, but  really loved the cranberry biscotti, must be the Italian in me! 

Our server was great, food came out quickly and every item was cooked perfectly.  We would highly recommend Carson Kitchen to friends and we do plan to return.",uLp2Rz4Jpy4FA3NsTnOZ6A,0,1,5,_wlOaI8nul7P1aLxsUZ51g
317555,2015-09-10,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Let's just start with this: DTLV is really underrated - so people, get down there. There's more to LV than the Strip. 

Now, let's talk Carson Kitchen. HOLY S#IT. We had heard good things, so on our recent trip, we knew we were going to carve out a day for DTLV and Carson Kitchen would be on the agenda. Can I just say that THE best way to kick off a night in DTLV is here?!

We ordered drinks first - of course. From there, we knew it was only to get better, but you MUST try the Get Shorty and the Driving with the Ms. UNBELIEVABLE...and paired so well with our social plates. It was an act of God to pull me away from the bar and not order a 3rd/4th.

Sarah, our AMAZING bartender/server, was super helpful because we were pouring over the menu and being greedy little piggies...I was hell bent on ordering 3 social plates, a side of Mac 'n Cheese, and possibly a 4th social plate. She told me to slooooow my roll...it would be way too much for us and that if we were still in the market for more, we could always order another plate or two. Thank you for saving me, Sarah.

Bacon Jam: Sugar and spice and everything nice...I love EVERYTHING about this and would spread it on the toes of a stranger, walking barefoot on the strip, and gladly eat it again. 

Gyro Tacos: My husband devoured - to be truthful, I was 3 bites into one (of our 4) before he swooped in to take care of the rest. The flavor of the lamb was perfect, the shell/pita was soft and chewy - perfectly done. 

Chicken Skins: I can't even deal...nor will I EVER look at chicken skin the same again. Ever. Slightly spicy (not hot), paired with the sweetness of the honey. It's like crack in chip form. 

Needless to say, we waddled out - sans Mac 'n Cheese - totally in love. We've found our new FAVORITE LV restaurant - hands down. 

Keep up the great work, CK. We'll see you again next year!",u6V9alFBlZqbGb-EmUjqCg,0,1,5,XiEflSgpMShQ2Fc1fO7Guw

Everything was full of flavor and different - not just the same old as usual restaurant. Not only that- but the service was incredible. Was a bit disappointed that they ran out of the shrimp, but what we did have was amazing. I'm pescatarian  and had the trout, beet salad, green beans and blue cheese and pear flatbread and it was all amazing. The skin on the trout was so crispy and the center cooked perfectly. I am super picky about fish as well. My husband loved his mooing burger and the chicken skins. People with us ordered medium burgers and the first time they came out extremely rare. We sent them back and had 3 different staff members come up and apologize. When the burgers came out again - in my opinion they were cooked perfectly medium but they still thought they were rare and 1 went back. Again the staff came and apologized and took both burgers off the check and gave us 3 free desserts. The banoffee pie was delicious! They went above and beyond despite me thinking the girl with us should have ordered her burger med-well. It was not the restaurants fault. By far the best meal I have had in Vegas.

Service here was awesome and quick. They're all friendly and believers of their food too. ""Everything's on the menu is good."" Was what we were told and so far that's been true!

They don't take reservations but just give them a call 30 mins before arrival and they can pop ya on the wait list and  hold a table for you too :)

Oh but that's just the start!  The menu is as unique as they come, from crispy chicken skin appetizers to rabbit ragu spaghetti, they have strayed far from all the downtown food niche and created one of their own.

My boyfriend and I found this hidden gem on yelp and they had me at brownies with bourbon bacon ice cream and fresh herbs like Rosemary and sage served as garnish in the cocktails. 
We came for dinner on a Monday night and did have to wait about 30 minutes (because this is a small restaurant with limited seating) but the wait was worth it. We sat at the bar that faces all the action in the kitchen and got to see everything first hand. Not only was I impressed with the food, I was impressed with how personable the wait staff (we were served by Dakota) and GM (Matt) were.
We shared the tempura green beans, bison burger sliders, and Mac n cheese, which were all mouth wasteringly amazing. We didn't have room for dessert so we came back the next night and splurged by having all three. The bacon bourbon ice cream was delicious as promised and I also LOVED the donut bread pudding with caramel sauce. I mean really!! So so so good.

When asked questions about the menu the bartender/waiter have smartass answers. We ordered two entrees, both of which had been 86'd because of a new menu coming out next week. That would have been good to know before looking over the menu. We ordered substitute entrees, one of which was also 86'd.  Since they have paper menus it would be very easy to cross out the items that are no longer available if the staff isn't going to tell customers. Our entrees (steak) came out cool, not warm, and the cauliflower side was no where to be seen. We asked about it and the bartender checked with a nearby server who we overheard say that it wasn't put in. The bartender then told us it would just be a minute more because he was just told it hadn't been made. We ate half of our steaks and then waiting for the cauliflower. Our steaks just got colder as we waited. At no point was there an apology or a visit from a manager. The only reason this is getting two stars instead of lower is the quality of the food.

Certainly if you are looking for a bottomless plate of Ribeye for $8.99, you can shuffle along for about a block and get just that. However if you want a modern, hipster foodie spot, with taste that backs up the attitude, then this is a must. They don't seem to care about making you wait, and even seem to like throwing out attitude if you expect something faster. The kitchen is small but quick. Due to limited tables reservations are not taken. If you have a large party or are impatient, get there early. The staff is ""cool"" with uniformly dissimilar artsy hair styles and no name tags, but look for Nirvana and Bowie tees to designate staff. 

Now the most important part: The food is delicious! I especially enjoyed the gyro tacos, bacon jam, turkey burger, all way above expectations. If you like tapas style eating this place leans that way, with the waiters even encouraging sharing multiple plate. I was sceptical at first, and showed up borderline hangry, but left completely satisfied. The price was extremely reasonable, costing about the same as breakfast on the strip for two, as dinner did for 4 of us.

Walk it off with a stroll around container park or play frogger along the Fremont. Parking is super easy, with lots open around the block",9lM23PT0DI7JeBOWOO-KvA,1,1,4,WWBgl180UU2hLsjMBDLTzg

So to Carson Kitchen I went, and I wasn't disappointed. Parallel parking out front and immediately seated at about 6p at the bar. Because it was only me, I ordered gyro tacos and seared scallops with mango habanero salsa. These two were powerful and delicate, respectfully. Fresh taco shells/pita and amazing flavor combinations in the tacos. Careful selections of flavors with the scallops as to compliment and not overpower. (Pair the scallops with a Kronenbourg Blonde-they're a perfect marriage.) For dessert I had the glazed doughnut bread pudding. I couldn't fit anything else. 

Best was that everything is made from fresh and service was fast and courteous, to say the least. I had plate envy from those around me that I couldn't indulge for lack of stomach space.

Came on a Tuesday night and it was jammed pack, luckily we came right before the crowd! We were greeted by the hostess and sat down at the long bar tables closest to the actual bar. 

I open concept in a small room makes everything really exciting - you can always see what's going on behind the bar, in the kitchen, what other people are ordering. It's nice to see other dishes that you didn't order, the presentation and even the reactions people have to the taste. (Which all reactions were a thumbs up!) 

To start, we order two cocktails, Easy Does It and #SimonSays sangria, both which were amazing! 

We ordered most of our dinner off the starter menus since everything on the menu is meant to share we figured it didn't matter where we ordered from. 

Devil's Eggs with caviar, amazing! Bacon Jam is a must, Secret Mac& Cheese, not your ordinary Mac! Gyro tacos, even more yum! We also order Alligator flatbread, and as if that wasn't enough we also ordered the killer shrimp, which was killer, as well as the wineberry shortcake!

-The bacon jam was great
-The brownie dessert and donut bread pudding were fantastic!
-The Turkey burger was good but not enough ""slaw""

-The cauliflower was far too salty to even stomach
-The sliders were dry but are on the right path

-They charged us for a steak that they had informed us they were out of and forgot to take it off the bill. They clearly do NOT know how to work their POS and charged my card 4 times for the same meal and so my $65 meal has now cost me $275, a call to the manager, and fraud reports to my bank.

Don't go for the burgers (they look fantastic) as you will miss the ethos of this place which is all about shared plates.

Instead the waiter told me that he begged the chefs to remove the pickled figs, but they were insulted and couldn't do it. Very disappointed.

She was real nice and have great service in spite of being real busy or short staffed. The hostess though had the fuck off face. Maybe she was having a bad day.

Now about the food. I tired the bacon jam. That shit is bomb! Only one problem. They barely give any bread with it. My table had to ask like 2 extra servings of bread. 

The deviled eggs was good. But I think they can add a dollar more and give one more egg. 

The pierogi tasted very bland. Thank goodness for the Cheese wiz with it.

My main issue was their risotto. The rice was so undercooked. The rice was hard. I wanted to send it back but I'm seen the movie ""waiting"" and I didn't want to be bothersome since my friends and I were having a good time. But really they got to work on the timing of cooking the risotto.

A new gem to the downtown corridor. This restaurant by Chef Kerry Simon takes comfort food to the next level!  Started off with a few of the shareable plates. If you don't care about your waist line or your cholesterol levels, start with the crispy chicken skins. They have taken the best part of fried chicken and made it an appetizer!  The Wellington empanadas are amazing!  The beef inside is so flavorful and tender.  Next we had the tempura green beans. The beans were so fresh and the tempura was the perfect crispiness/saltiness. Don't forget to dip in the cream cheese sauce. Next was the veal meatballs with sherry foie gras cream sauce. Again heaven. Taking down home comfort food and jazzing it up a notch. Did I mention we sat at the chefs counter and were able to talk to the entire kitchen staff while they prepared our meal!  It was like being on a cooking show. For our main course, we had the short rib sliders and the baked Mac and cheese. Again amazing comfort food taken to the next level. The short ribs have a root beer glaze that is a perfect compliment to the braised beef. I've been dying to try the Mac and cheese since the day I saw a pic of them on FB a few months ago and it was so worth the wait!  
As stuffed as we were, we still tried the Bourbon Fudge Brownie with brown butter bacon ice cream. And we were so happy we did. The ice cream had actual bacon bits in it!  Paired with the decadent chocolate brownie, the saltiness/creaminess of the ice cream was what God must have intended heaven to taste like :)

I'm docking a star for service.  The food was awesome.  Tried the broccoli salad, bacon jam, butter burger, steak, and the bread pudding.   
Broccoli salad - wonderful mix of sweet, sour, crunchy, and creamy.  Refreshing.  Burger and steak were cooked perfectly - medium rare, just the way we like.  (Medium rare meaning red in the middle, you have no idea how hard it is for people to get medium rare right).  Bacon jam was so smokey and slightly sweet - just wish they weren't so chintzy about the brie and bread.  I mean, 5 pieces of bread for all the jam??  Come on, now.   The interior is very industrial-y, raw material-y feeling.  Very unique.

We were catching Book of Mormon after dinner and let our bartender know.  We sat at the bar as there was no other seating when we arrived.  We let her know when we first sat down and she promised she would get us out of there in time.  We ordered everything up front (including dessert) but ended up waiting and waiting for the bread pudding after the meal.  We told her to cancel it and it ended up showing up right as we were leaving.  At this point we were already late so we each scarfed down a bite and ran out the door.  It also seemed more important to her to flirt with her fellow bartender than see if we needed anything.  We all wanted another round of drinks but could not get her attention.  By the time she noticed, we were done with our meal and it was a little late for another round.  Is it customary for bartenders to take away your glass when you still have at least two drinks left?  I felt like I still had a good amount of beverage left when the bartender tried to take away my glass.  Maybe it was our fault for catching a show after dinner but we thought an hour and a half would be sufficient.  Guess not.",dcSLz5d9xiSFb8zsqn2zKQ,0,0,4,qt96nvzeVN7xGaZ5Dti-Fw

I had the chicken skins, which were deliciously unhealthy.  The skins were crispy and delicious, but I didn't care for the smoked honey dipping sauce.  No idea how you smoke honey, but the smokiness left a weird after-taste that lasted far too long.  I also had the tempura green beans, which came out pretty crispy, considering how much water green beans have in them.  Paired with a pepper cream cheese, the beans were probably the best dish of the night.  The black rice oxtail risotto wasn't to my liking - a little too oily and definitely too salty.  Even though I have a wicked sweet tooth, I actually found the sweet potato pie (with pecans and a stout-laced marshmallow browned topping) too sweet.  I liked what they were trying to do here, an interesting spin on every dish, but the execution was off just enough that I can't rave about the place.

That said, I will probably come back here.  I loved the atmosphere, the staff is super nice and friendly (one of the chefs started chatting with me while he was working), and the food is light-years better than most offerings Downtown (damning with faint praise, I know). Plus I thought the prices were pretty reasonable.

We did indeed have a small wait of 30 minutes, but a cocktail on the back patio killed that time quickly. The cocktails are solid, ""Damn, Daniel"" is mighty tasty and I knocked back a few by the end of the evening. 

We were seated at the bar, where Geronimo took care of us, mixed our drinks, provided a few laughs and was always quick with a recommendation. 

Our party of two ordered a wide mix of different plates and shared. This was the perfect way to do it. There was a lot that we wanted to try and this was a great way to do it.

The Deviled Eggs are great, the Gyro Tacos are a must, smoky béchamel on  the Mushroom Flatbread is unreal.

By the end of the night we even gave dessert a try. The Glazed Donut Pudding was killer, but the Chocolate Tart was a little too much... 

Overall, it was an awesome experience that made Carson Kitchen a place that I look forward to coming back to... and I did... the next day for lunch.  And, Round 2 was just as good.",HqgBN2CoX4bJEbQy_ImG7A,0,1,5,r7seSEdARJZjuUfeVbjU9w
559236,2014-06-14,4,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,Open two days but you would think it had been open two years.  An open kichen concept where the chefs create master pieces on plates.  Cocktails are hand crafted and go down way too easy.  I am mad at the mac n cheese because it is simply AMAZING. I will never attempt to make homemade mac n cheese again as it will seem like an utter failure once I had this.  The rabbit ragu served over spaghetti squash is equally delicious.  I can't wait to come back again and again so I can work my way through this entire menu.  What a homerun for downtown.,TIpz69pYTsFzRjAepYUusg,4,3,5,1j8LXwUT7oqXsB8CMIt8rw
578272,2014-11-15,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"This quaint little restaurant is off the beaten path from old downtown Fremont Street. Finding it isn't hard IF you're looking; it's named for the street it's on. But there's not much around to use for landmarks. It's across the street from an empty lot. And while there's not much around to look at, there is a simple charm to the rooftop dining area on a cool winter night in Las Vegas.

The staff is friendly and identified by the band tee shirts they're required to wear. Our waitress was honest about food selections and steered us away from the root beer glazed short rib. She did make a mistake with regard to our drink order, but we ended up with a free beer, so I cannot complain.

The food is rustic small plate style and meant to be shared. There were three of us so we sampled a few items.

The bacon jam we agreed was by far the star attraction. It's rich and flavorful and even though you feel guilty, you'll have trouble sharing. The Devil's eggs were also quite good, but gone in a flash. As far as the larger items, the butter burger was actually quite good. It comes with tater tots, which were decent, but it's hard to mess up tater tots. The Mac and Cheese was rich and creamy but neither mind blowing or disappointing. The mushroom flatbread was, however disappointing, and so was the risotto. The flatbread uninspired, small, and distinctly missing any rich flavors. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the oxtail risotto was so overpowered with parmesan cheese there wasn't room for any other flavors. 

We drank our desert. The beer selection is actually fairly good and non-traditional. I tried two of the mixed drinks and each was well prepared.

A nice touch at the end of the meal is how the check arrives; in a book which invites you to leave an autograph and a message. 

Taking all into account, I think I'll try this kitchen again at least once more for the bacon jam. I did take some points away for location as well as for taste. However three stars as a rating comes because, as one of my friends said, ""I think the owner's believe their food is out of the park when some of it needs improvement.""",BYnnHEwIPRMnjpNVH7fEPA,0,1,3,cIldBgV2PZSxotcmfjW4wA
587228,2015-02-14,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Got to LV late last night and was starving. As we  approach our landing, Fremont Street, I got on Yelp to see if there were any gems in the area. Carson Kitchen is amazing.

I've recently become fond of Gin and had The Margarian and it was delicious, definitely on the sweet side for a cocktail. My partner had the Laguinitas little sumpin sumpin ale and it was great.  All the plates here are sharable which I love because as a visitor I want to try as much as possible. 

We had the Crispy Chicken Skins which come with honey as a dipping sauce. I am not a big Salt eater so they were delicious but I got tired of the flavor after a few, I do believe they are a hit for most. We also had the NY Strip which hand a rub that included coffee and a red wine demi glaze. It was tasty, ordered it medium rare but was more on the rare side. 

Now for the stars of the show. First, the jalapeño poppers stuffed with a sausage and cream cheese filling, the best of my life. Finally, the pork osso bucco, this last one was my partner's pick and it was absolutely amazing. Extremely tender, well seasoned, and served on an very light yet flavorful gravy.

589306,2016-05-03,2,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Let me start with the food is awesome.  Bacon jam lived up to its reputation. 
We had a party of 8 with reservations made two weeks in advance. We showed up on time and were seated about 20 minutes later. Not a big deal since they had a great outdoor fire lounging area for us. 
Once we were seated, our server, I can't remember her name, but she could be Gwen Stefani's sister, seemed on her game and said she won't forget anything because we'll order then she'll repeat it back to us...which she did. 
We were warned that food came out randomly about every 6 minutes and they encourage sharing plates. Fine. However, first, not all plates are shareable with 8 people. Sandwiches and burgers and certain salads are not shareable. That being expected is simply ridiculous. Second, Food came out 20,30 and 60 minutes apart. That's insane. The server suggested if we wanted protein in the much talked about Mac n cheese, to add the meatballs. Perfect. So meatballs came out promptly, then the Mac followed about 35-45 minutes later.  YEP. Great recommendation server! To top off the already late dishes, everyone ate except our friend with a chicken salad. First being told ""the chicken takes a long time to marinate"" This is almost an hour after originally ordering.  Finally The server said ""someone forgot"" and she would comp the salad because she ""didn't even care""  Still, 30 plus minutes goes by without it and I can't help but wonder if it was because the cook was playing ""finger drums"" in the back. The salad arrived, we cheered and the hostess seemed annoyed and said ""frankly, it was because your server forgot to order it"". Nice team work! No one takes ownership, just blames or throws you under and made us feel like the jerks because WE should have expected that due to their expediting technique. The infamous salad was wonderful, so our friend said. We left with pleased palates but service was considerably less than our expectations. 
If you want good food, go. Just leave all other expectations at the door.",Nf1cTF9DV9LGe_qhvAqwBg,4,2,2,ajNRtKX3YhikOhHnLet7eQ

Stopped in here for food and drinks before heading out on Freemont with a friend visiting from out of town. Be warned that you are not allowed to park in the street directly across from the entrance!

The interior is set up for table sharing type eating.  The three of us ate on one of the big butcher blocks next to the bar on the left upon entering and shared the table with about 5 others. It looks like they don't offer your own table unless you eat on the deck upstairs or have a big enough group to take up one of the big tables downstairs. 

The decor inside is awesome, they did a great job.  It offers that hipster/raw/industrial feel but still feels classy.

The bartender at the upstairs bar was very chill and quick.  He whipped up three of their signature cocktails very quickly.  The server downstairs was very friendly and knowledgable of the food on the menu.

My only con about this place was that the food took FOREVER to come out, roughly 25-30 min, and we didn't order anything fancy.  The food was very good though!  I'll let them make up for it there.

607180,2016-10-19,11,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"This past Sunday evening my husband and I decided to take his parents here after we had a great experience a few months ago; that was an HUGE mistake and embarrassment.

We called to make a reservation around 6:30 and were told they don't take them for less than 6 people but, if we were headed there soon it wouldn't be a problem as they weren't busy. The lady told us to just call when we got close and they'd make sure there was a table available. We immediately hopped in the car and called as instructed only to be told there was now an hour wait. What??? She indicated to still come and it shouldn't really be that long.

We arrived, gave our name and waited in their back yard. As we waited and waited, we witnessed a hostess seat a party of 4 that did not have all of their diners with them but, she told them that was fine. What?? Since we had our entire very hungry party ready, my husband went to ask the hostess what was up with that. She did agree that all members of the party need to be present before seated but, did not ask the 2 men to wait back outside until everyone arrived. Instead she told us it shouldn't be much longer. Frustrated, we waited some more (about a total of an hour) until finally being seated on their wobbly little stools.

The food was good, the waitress was nice but, the real kicker was when the bill came. I normally quickly look at a bill and pay it but, this time I noticed my husband's soda water was $12 (we were charged every time she refilled it), 2 orders of tiny tacos were over $30 and even more insulting a charge for more tiny pieces of toast (more=maybe 4 slices). 

I called over the waitress to ask about primarily the ridiculous amount for soda water and she at that time told us it's because it's from a bottle. What? We weren't told it was a bottle when we ordered it nor did a bottle come to the table like my father-in-law's coke. She said she'd ask her manager about adjusting it. A male manager came over that was strangely confrontational and beyond rude for such a situation, explained the whole bottle thing and would be able to take 2 of the charges off (there were 4 total). I told him that was unacceptable as we were never told we were ordering a bottle to begin with much less each time the waitress automatically refilled it. I also informed him that our experience had started off horrible, that we are locals entertaining our parents. **This is also the time I signaled our parents to leave** He seemed to be deaf to our concerns as his demeanor never changed and no apologies were given. He told us ""fine but, you'll still have to pay for one"". 

Now Folks, you may be asking ""B**ching about soda water? Really?"" Yes, because I have ZERO tolerance for liars and scammers (even here in Vegas)!

Due to his lack of customer service as a manager, he could care less about us nor our horrible experience. He adjusted the bill and came back silent. NEVER EVER apologizing. However, I did hear him ask the table behind us if everything was ok and if they needed anything.

This place is a complete joke. It belongs on The Strip where they can get away with overcharging and nickeling and diming guests or at the very least rethink their business practice that currently has a total lack of customer care.",5PN0bIWGcOYsglHA6cu60A,8,0,1,NR8FbcP6oLpSiLWP0Y8RaQ

They sat us at the communal table, I was fine with it and had some interesting conversations. However, I could see how if someone was shy or didn't enjoy talking to strangers how they might not enjoy sitting there. The decor was industrial modern. 

We split the chicken skins with smoked honey - which was awesome! The skins were crispy and the honey gave it the perfect sweet to contrast the salt. Also, it was one of the more reasonable items on the menu at $6. 

Wellington Empanadas - they were good but I wouldn't order them again. They were really salty, and to me part of the beauty of the wellington is how well they are cooked -while the phyllo dough likened itself to a wellington the filling was chopped beef and other vegetbales. Thus at $10 not my favorite item. 

The short rib sliders with spicy tator tots - three sliders for $14. A little over priced. The sliders had a sweet flavor to them and a crunch from french fried onion the bun. There was not much sauce on them either. My friend likened them to a marshmallow flavor of a rice krispy treat, while I don't completely agree with her I found it amusing. Again, good but not phenomenal and I think I would try something else. 

Duch Confit Flatbread - very good, again sweet like the flatbread was brushed with honey - however, very very small portion. Possibly six inches in length by four inches or so across. Also, the flatbread was not crisp on the bottom, however the flavor was good. $10. 

Glad I tried it, loved the chicken skins, but a little pricey for what you receive for my taste but it is a Kerry Simon restaurant. If you go for lunch go early - they fill up fast with the downtown work crowd.

This was my second time having a late lunch here. This time around the bartender seemed to be the waiter at all the tables so he was needless to say ""very busy"" we were created and seated promptly by the hostess. As we sat the bartender is passing behind us and mudders to hisself f@$k, I'm guessing because he was so busy. The hostess got us some waters and said that the waiter would be with us. About 5 minutes pass and he comes by says hello and asked if we were ready. 

I ordered an iced tea and the other person with me asked for raspberry iced tea he responded in an almost annoyed fashion I don't have raspberry iced tea, so we order lemonade. We order a starter and two other main dishes. 

The shrimp platter came out first which was a main dish followed about 3 minutes later with the gyro tacos which was the starter and then about 5 minutes later the turkey burger which was the other main dish. Seems the waiter should ask and deliver instructions to the kitchen so guests get the food as they are expecting. 

My main concern was the hygiene the hostess was trying to help out the waiter by delivering some food and helping with drinks however the almost to the crotch shorts seemed to be causing her a problem so she had to keep reaching to her inner thigh and pulling them down. The other was which seemed to be a manager figure wearing a button down shirt and sweatpants, he would play with his mustache and sole patch rub his eyes and face then grab a plate from the kitchen and deliver it to a table. The other lady at the kitchen counter did a good job as well as the kitchen staff. The other manager figure there delivered one of our plates to us and was very professional. 

The food is a little over priced however great marks on flavor so great job to the kitchen staff. 

The employees and managers should be a little more mindful of cleanliness.

As my rating indicates, nothing was terrible but also nothing was truly outstanding.  Two of us ordered crispy fried chicken skin, shepherd pie, roasted beets, and wild mushroom flatbread. The fried chicken skin seemed a little on the burnt side of fried. The roasted beets were well seasoned and tasty with crumbled blue cheese but were unevenly cooked with some pieces undercooked and crunchy, and some perfectly cooked. And the mushroom flatbread should be called vegetable flatbread since there were other veggies (asparagus and broccoli) in equal parts to the mushrooms; this overall was a little bland and could use some kind of seasoning, maybe some garlic or spices.

The place is small and loud.  Initially, we were seated at a high top table with strangers.  I didn't want my neighbors to hear our conversation; so we asked to move.  No problem said the hostess.  We struggled to find something to order off the menu.  Tried the bacon jam since it has gotten rave reviews.  It was okay--not something to write home about.  I ordered the fried chicken sandwich.  Hated the spread on the sandwich and not impressed with the chicken.  Enjoyed the tater tots.  My friend ordered the beef stroganoff.  Neither one of us finished our meal and we both declined to have any of it boxed up.  $50.00 not well spent for today's lunch.

If it gives you a sense, the carbonara was our least favorite of the 4 dishes, and it was still pretty good. Other friends think the carbonara is the best dish on the menu. Seriously, everything is great here. Bill was $41, and it was definitely too much food for the two of us. And the location is phenomenal for a night out, and there's a rooftop bar with heaters and blankets for winter. I'm sure it's great in the summer as well.

We got there and parking was difficult, greeter at the door was nice, super packed, 45 minute wait, ordered a beer at the bar, waited in the back courtyard. Now this seems rather unpleasant, but this is where Carson Kitchen 'stepped their game up' and delivered. At the bar they had a Brooklyn Brown Ale that my friends and I enjoy and haven't seen here in the west coast. The court yard in the back was surprisingly serene, reminiscent of times spent in a backyard BBQ with friends. The wait was actually 15 mins which translated to 'freaking awesome' (I like the under-promising and over-delivering). Now, the fifth star was credited to the food and the man behind the magic. Bacon Jam is on point and that is no understatement because I found myself spreading that goodness on everything. No joke. I put it on the Mac n cheese, I put it on the gyro tacos, I put it on the coco steak. Don't get me wrong, all of these dishes lacked nothing and were incredible by themselves, but that bacon jam was like crack for me, and given the means I would've taken it intravenously. I guess one of the chefs came out to check on us and he couldn't have been a more 'cool like dat' kind of guy. Kudos to Eugene the chef, you made that food your bitch and owned it. Not quite sure who the owner is but you get the standing 'O' for nailing the whole ambiance of this place. You seriously got that five star taste without all that pretension of those snotty, over priced, mish-mash, upscale casino restaurants.

The food is pretty good, but rich.  The restaurant kinda reminds me of a gastro pub without the beer taps.  Everything I had was flavor packed and unique.  I had the black rice and oxtail risotto, fried chicken skins, bacon jam, and the watermelon feta salad.  All good, and very rich.  I think the food was giving me gout afterwards.  BTW, I shared the plates, I didn't eat all those dishes myself.

There's a patio in the back that you can wait in while you're waiting for a table.  It's open, so it was about 150 degrees out there.  I ordered a beer and took it out there, but it went warm rather quickly.  Maybe you get use to the dry heat if you live in Vegas?

They don't take reservations, but they set the waiting time expectations really well.  People seem to be willing to wait to get a spot in this place.  Try it once.

I had the root beer sliders, meatballs, burger, devils eggs, and cucumber soda.  Loved everything.  Only gripe is the root beer sliders are too sweet and takes away from the integrity of the beef.  Portions are moderate and pricing is average to high.  

Cool urban concept that looks to add to the growing downtown dining scene.  Service is casual but attentive.  The server recognized my friend from the last visit.",5lyRtA4uRP7U13zPUr3I4g,3,3,4,b8IWvSQwIn2vfjiQvvRFVQ

I got the fried green tomato (crab) sandwich.  It was pretty good, 3.5/5.  The crab was seasoned with an odd herb combo which I thought may have been rosemary?  It was still good, just different to my pallet.  The others in my party ordered the bacon jam, the sliders, and gyro tacos, and they even comped us a free Mac n Cheese because they brought a plate out late.  Everything was pretty enjoyable overall.  My one complaint would be the tater tots.  They are seasoned very heavily, almost overkill.  The beer menu was a little different as well, probably could be expanded upon to better match and compliment the food flavors.

Venue has a industrial loft inspiration with interesting lighting and exposed brick, and the upstairs patio was raved about.  Very downtown Vegas vibe for sure.

After waiting outside for the restaurant to open, which you could clearly see people (staff) inside by the door and which I had tried to open earlier, no one came to ask if I was waiting or to even acknowledge restaurant was open. I was first in restaurant (with no line at all). The hostess asked if I wanted to sit at the bar and with no other patrons in there I asked to sit at a table. The manager (man) said they do not seat party's of one. First, no one is at the restaurant and second,  I have seen in past reviews people said sometime multiple parties would have to be seated at a table. I guess I should have known the experience was not going well when there was no line unlike other places close to this one.

I love the touch of a ""Swear Jar"" on the kitchen counter. I've also heard that the rooftop patio is open but didn't go up there because it was 100 degrees outside. 

Tara was our server and she was attentive and funny. She even made the cocktails we ordered behind the bar, talk about a girl that can multitask! 

Crispy Chicken skins - this dish is amazing for people that love fried food. It's not greasy or oily and is seasoned perfectly. It comes with a side of honey to dip it in. 
Perfect mix of salty and sweet. 

Black rice and Oxtail risotto - my favorite risotto I've eaten. The first bite made my jaw drop because I enjoyed it so much, especially the parmesan cream it was in. I can't explain all the flavors in it but it's a dish I would get every visit here. 

Veal Meatballs - sherry Foie Gras cream and peas. The sauce was very light and added the perfect touch to the meatballs. 

Chicken thighs - the citrus chimichurri sauce made so savory with the juicy chicken. 

As for cocktails, we tried Drink With The Ms. (pig's nose whiskey, amaro del sole, grapefruit juice, fresh lime, maple syrup, crabbie's ginger beer) and The Margarian (aviation gin, thyme & honey syrup, fresh lemon, mr. q cumber soda). Both were extremely refreshing on a scorching summer day in Vegas. 

I'm already looking at the menu to decide what to eat in my next visit. Can't wait! And yes, this place is that good!!!

FYI: the restaurant is located in the newly refurbished John E. Carson Hotel. We had a tough time finding it at first because we entered through the Bikram Yoga door. It fastest to just walk around the building on the outside and stay on Carson.",jOW3BGthCDL3l7Dd6AWZtA,2,1,5,wktfoCqlsCwzEUMpj5Nu9w

A few friends and I visited for dinner based on Yelp reviews, we were put on the waitlist and headed to the patio to wait. As we headed towards the unlocked, unblocked, door with no ""closed"" sign or indication, the manager began yelling at us across the restaurant. His tone along with a waving finger were embarassing and offensive in a restaurant full of people. The hostess then calmly explained the patio was closed for cleaning. Not an apology or even another glance from the rude manager until we sat down to eat. 

The food was decent, our group shared  several of the appetizers, entrees, and desserts. The waitress, Nicole, was very nice and attentive. I was given dirty silverware and requested a clean spoon, which they brought as well as comping our dessert.

The inside is small but fun, and has a good atmosphere. It's loud and lively. Seems like a fun downtown place. Had I known about the patio when I made the reservations, we would have definitely been up there! So fun!

The waiter was great - friendly and attentive, but not too much. 

For food, plates are smaller- like tapas style, and they make for a great date/small party. They ""suggest"" that you share, but it's basically forced sharing as everyone's food comes out at different times. We had a large group and the first persons dish to the last was nearly 25 minutes. Sharing ended up being fine but if you're not a sharer or are with people you don't really want digging into your food, maybe go elsewhere that night. It's a little pricey for the small portions, but that's the ""in"" thing.

We ordered:
Pork Osso Buco - Definitely tender... fall of the bone but it was lacking flavor. I'd skip it. 
Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto - My husband ordered this and ate every last bite, so I'd say it was good. 
Chicken Skins - These are spicy! Spicy enough I couldn't eat them. The sauce is interesting too. Good if you like liquid smoke. 
Mac and Cheese - Was good!
Gyro Tacos - I'd probably order only this if we ever go back. 

The drinks were great - I got sangria and it was like juice. I think I knocked back 3 before I told the waiter no more!

It's kid friendly, but be aware that they don't have high chairs.

Definitely fun for drinks/apps. Treat it like that instead of a restaurant. and Sit outside!",n4TZSTUWKfKNsFHMxpAtOQ,0,0,4,RcQubgDs-4cKBPgJx112zQ

It was slow evening when we arrived and were offered a table for 3 but our 3rd flaked out. Either way we're we're served well, except for the fact my lady noticed the manager continuously stare at us from afar. He finally came up to us and asked if our guest was going to arrive. As soon as we said no, he grabbed the napkins and place settings with such a bad attitude and walked away without a word. 

We had our meals but we're still annoyed and Mike kept leering at us. Finally, we got our check and we're about to pay when he, grabbed the check out of our servers hands. He came back and stated, ""I took care of the appetizer, thanks for understanding and we needed you to get up quickly!"" 


Wtf? Like really? You could of kindly asked us to sit at the bar or another small table, and we would have been good but the way the manager Mike, handled himself was completely unprofessional, offensive, and rude as fuck.

The menu is geared toward sharing which makes it good for groups, or my wife and me. We started with the mushroom flatbread. Incredible. Cannot say enough good things about it. The pickled red onions really made the dish. Next, we shared the short rib grilled cheese. Meat was tender and flavorful. Cheese mixed well with the crusty sourdough bread. Side of spicy tots worked too. For dessert, we got the glazed donut bread pudding. Yes, you read that correctly. Glazed. Donut. Bread. Pudding. It was excellent. The place is a bit hard to find with only one sign on the window. Service was great, Manny took good care of us and our check came in an old book to sign which was neat.

3) Oxtail and black rice risotto (unbelievably rich and amazing. The raw garlic in the gremolata they top it with takes it over the top in the best possible way)
4) Sunday fried chicken sandwich (pretty great as far as fried chicken breast sandwiches go... The spicy tots they serve on the side are the real star)
5) Rainbow cauliflower. (GET IT. Especially since the main entrees don't come with sides)
6) Chicken thighs (Well-cooked, but literally it's just two chicken thighs on a plate with some chimichurri. Also WAY oversalted.)
7) Short rib stroganoff (This was the only misfire of our meal. Whatever spirit they used in the sauce completely overpowered the dish and gave it a horrible aftertaste. The meat was perfectly done though)

I asked for the dressing on the side because I wasn't sure I would like it, but it was good. Thick but tasty. My husband had the chicken thighs with spicy tater tots.

The ambience is a bit of a gastropub feel. High and low tables pack the cozy joint plus a full bar and stool that overlook that kitchen give it a very intimate atmosphere.  They also have a back patio where people can lounge and mingle while they wait for their table. 

Did I mention that this place was created by the late Kerry Simon? This was also a major + as I have heard he was an amazing chef with unexpected creations. 

We ordered several taps-style dishes that were all perfection. Note most food is made to share and come out as they are ready. 

Crispy Chicken skins with smoke honey - definitely a must-try of fried goodness. Honey is a nice touch and complement to the skins. 
Fried tempura with pepper jelly cream cheese - similar to the skins quite delicious.
(note: I probably would only choose one or the other next time, it was a little too similar from a fried, finger-food standpoint) 
New to the menu. SPAM sliders with seaweed salad, grilled pineapple and ""yummy"" sauce plus spicy tater tots - Probably my favorite dish. 
Black Rice Oxtail Risotto with Parmesan Cheese - Oh so rich and you could just taste the flavor of the Risotto. 
""Devil's"" Eggs, crispy pancetta and caviar - Omg. you had me had deviled eggs. I think I could have eaten 3 orders of it easily.

It was about 110 degrees that day so the first thing I ordered as soon as I walked in was a diet coke, when I got a 8oz bottle for 4.00 I knew that wasn't going to work for me so I ordered beer instead. The bartender recommended me 1664 blanc a wheat beer with a hint of citrus and fruit which was very tasty and refreshing.
The beef Wellington empanadas were my favorite of the items I tried, but at 10 dollars per order it seemed a little to much for them two tiny little pockets until I took a bite and realized that they're worth every penny.
The gyro tacos were also good and the name says it all, tacos that taste like gyros, nothing new, nothing extraordinary but good.
The meat balls were the the least impressive of the items I ordered, the name itself veal meatballs with sherry foie gras was too promising but there was nothing memorable about them except that they were a little too dry for my taste, the green peas don't help either, I think their sole purpose is to make the meatballs look huge.
 Ambience is great. The place is very small and you'll definitely be sharing some personal space with strangers, there's also an outdoor patio and a roof top bar that should be a great place to hang with friends when the weather cooperates but for now unless you want to match your fried chicken skins, the inside area is the only place to be.

So glad vegas is getting a nice set of solid places that cater more to locals who want a night out that isn't in a hotel or Summerlin. 

Walking in the hostess was in a tye dye grateful dead shirt and the waiter in a Led Zeppelin shirt. For a trendy place like this we were very confused. Im assuming the waiter gets that look often as he quickly explained to us that when they bought their alcohol permit it states that the bar is to be a 'rock bar' where they are required to play 'rock music' and have 'rock attire' he even took the license off the wall to show us. Very funny.

The food was outstanding. I've never been a place where every single dish was mouth watering good.
The place is tapas style so we got quite a few plates.
Chicken skins with honey is quite possibly the best thing I have ever tasted. I was apprehensive about ordering as it sounds weird but do not skip over it you will regret it if you do.

I won't be back for the food though.

Ordered the following:

Devil's Eggs: basically 6 deviled eggs with a sprinkling of black caviar and crunchy pancetta bits replacing the paprika.  I love deviled eggs and this version tasted okay, but I couldn't help thinking that real deviled eggs have more flavor, because of the spice from the paprika.  This version was just salty, and the egg filling was a little on the dry side as well.  The pancetta was the best part.  The caviar didn't have much of a flavor impact.  I think I would have been more impressed with the dish if they had replaced the black caviar with Japanese flying fish roe or salmon roe and added a drop of spicy sauce as well, because Japanese roe has that poppy texture that was missing with the black caviar.  Plus it's orange, so the presentation would be more exciting, more of a play on the traditional deviled eggs. 

Roasted beet salad: the description sounded good but the flavors did not meld well for me.  Besides the beets, it had mandarin oranges, goat cheese, pistachios.  I think it would have tasted better if the beets were sliced thinner instead of in big chunks, and maybe if the pistachios were replaced with candied walnuts or pecans.  

Rainbow Cauliflower: I prefer roasted cauliflower to whatever they did to this cauliflower.  Roasted cauliflower is more tender and the olive oil carmelizes, bringing out the natural sweetness of the cauliflower.  This version had no sweetness, only salt.  I didn't taste much or any garlic and lemon, which is what other reviewers have raved about.  And the cauliflower was still very crunchy.  It was another miss for me.

Hmm...looking at the photos other people have posted on Yelp, I see that I didn't get nearly as much caviar on my eggs as others did.  It really was just a sprinkling, whereas I saw in one photo that it was piled on.  I wonder if I caught the kitchen on an off night.",HFhXNdx55eQNX-OUedQR5A,0,0,3,i10tQ1nqbrzIftFzVoa9yw

1368274,2015-05-29,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"You should come here if you have 2 of 2 things while you're in Vegas (you will need both):

1) Mobility- take a car and drive yourself here. My friend and I spent $30 on cab fare trying to get to downtown Las Vegas with the possibility of not catching a cab ride back because cabs are not plentiful in downtown.

2) Intestinal fortitude- downtown Las Vegas is not for the faint of heart. The crowd is...eclectic which is a rather nice adjective to use. There are a lot of drunk, aggressive people in the downtown area if you happen to take a peep into the downtown strip after dining at Carson Kitchen, beware. I'm usually alright, but I was slightly uncomfortable because it was out of my element. 

With that said, Carson Kitchen was great. I had a great meal here. I hope it garners more press and popularity because what the staff is putting out is nothing short but amazing.

My friend and I ordered the following:

-crispy chicken skin with smoked honey: deep fried pieces of chicken skin, lightly sprinkled with a powdery chili and dipped into a smoked honey. This was a winning combination. The texture of the chicken skin was spot on- not too hard with the right amount of crisp. I really enjoyed this dish. I do wish that the skin pieces were slightly smaller, but overall, this was excellent.

-""devil's eggs"": deviled eggs topped with pancetta and caviar. The addition of fried bits of pancetta was excellent. It really balanced the soft texture of the deviled egg by giving it an extra crunch. There were also generous heaps of caviar on each egg. Wonderful.

-cocoa expresso New York strip steak: medium rare steak topped with a red wine demi. The steak was flavorful, had the right amount of chew, and perfect to the palette. This was surprisingly so good. I do wish that they were more sparing with the red wine demi because the sauce really added another dimension to the steak. Great overall main dish.

We also ordered a side of the fingerling potatoes to pair with our steak. This was a great addition because the potatoes came generously heaped with garlic. It was a winning steak and potato combination.

It's only been recent that I have ventured outside of the strip in search of food, and if you have the willingness to do so, you can find find gems like Carson Kitchen hidden in Vegas. Do yourself a favor- if you are searching for one really great meal in Vegas, make your way off the strip and into Carson Kitchen. It's a good bang for your buck ($27 per person including all of the dishes), and it helps keep the food scene in Vegas alive.",GhnqHTT1vKkLc0Z1rGsQ1A,1,0,4,IXyvUB0xnAjj-b51BTI38w

1372163,2015-07-20,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"The place was a little small, but that is to be expected in this part of town.  I think because of the threat of rain, the upstairs patio section was closed, making the dining room really crowded.  I wasn't expecting the whole family style seating.  They don't take reservations so we called ahead to put our name on the list, as the hostess recommended.  We were seated about 10 minutes after arrival on a Saturday night, so that was pretty good.  It was really too crowded to wait inside.  While waiting outside, a dude kept walking up and down the street crazily shouting profanities at nobody, so that added some color to that part of the evening.  Again, this is sort of to be expected in this part of town.  

When we were seated, it was at the bar.  I wasn't expecting this but we thought it was fun.  If you are seated at the bar, be prepared for people ordering drinks over your head and handing over payments next to your food.  The bar tender was also our server, so there wasn't much discussion of the menu, just ""you guys want food?"".  He was very nice and good at his job, but between the noise level and him trying to make drinks for the entire restaurant, I didn't really feel able to ask any questions about the menu. (I did have some, but oh well)

On to the food......Awesome!!  I had the killer shrimp, which were nice and spicy along with the pork belly cuban.  I thought the cuban was a little heavy on the yellow mustard, along with the pickles giving it a sort of McDonald's Cheeseburger flavor profile.  But, it would have been the best McD's burger of my life....so there you go.  Also, it came with really good house made tater tots.  I probably wouldn't order this dish again, but I don't regret getting it.  It was nice and crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside.  Hubby got the strawberry manchego salad and the garlic fingerling potatoes (he's a vegetarian).  Both were really great.  It was a really nice meal and I really enjoyed my house berry sangria.  It wasn't the same old sangria with oranges and cheap fruit.  It was nice and bright tasting with fresh berries in the glass.  Hubs got some gin concoction with cucumber and thyme.  I thought it was awfully bitter, but that's right up his alley and he really loved it.  

The food is definitely 5 star quality, but I knocked off a star just for the whole over crowded feel of the place and not having a real server.  For that price, it would be nice to have had a table and someone to talk to about the food before ordering.  Also, when you're waiting to be seated, they offer you the option of getting a drink at the bar while you wait..........except, the bar is actually table seating, so if you were to lean over people eating and shout a drink order, there is no where to actually enjoy said drink.  Kind of a turn off.  

This place is worth the visit, just know what you're getting into before arrival.",_edEeOCPeKywzpjzd6LR0A,1,1,4,zgSWufaWmiDwLdCrEVCbgA

I had the black rice and oxtail risotto and hubby had the espresso rubbed New York steak both dishes were perfectly seasoned and cook. This was my 4-5th time (surprised to see I didn't have any reviews) at this juncture and the service and quality always deliver. The chimichurri dallioped over the rich creamy risotto was the cherry on the top - awesome blend of olive oil with permeating flavors of parsley, cilantro, shallots and then some. The generous slivers of buttery oxtail was the perfect ratio to starch. His steak was also amazing - unconventionally rubbed with cocoa and espresso (?) - fired just right to his liking and was ""well - rested"". This place, did I mention is perfect for sharing. We wanted to get some rainbow cauliflower but our belly whiny allow it. Funny story how we ended up here, if I may. We actually left ""Jerry's Nugget"" - ditched our table at the cafe after sitting there for 20mins waiting for our waiter to take our order... on a very slow day no less. We intended to get the mammoth 30oz prime rib and a Greek staple called spanakopita (mine of course). I'm glad we made the switch.

1399320,2017-10-30,17,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Excellent spot in downtown Vegas located parallel and south of Fremont. I recommend getting there early and would not plan to have a large dinner party on a weekend. We arrived about 9pm on a Friday night and it was a 20-minute wait. We headed over to the small bar area. They have a great variety of beers foreign, domestic, craft, as well as a cocktail list. Cocktails range in the $11-$15 range. Bar area is quite small. Cool looking but not a place to meet up with a group of friends. Good place to meet up with a friend for a drink. If you are looking for more than that you would need a table. 

Luckily, when it was time for us to be seated we were given a front row seat to all of the entertainment. We were seated at the bar. We went from sitting at the bar to dining at a bar next to the kitchen. At first, I thought it was lame but then got a feel for what was going on. If you are foodie (of course you are because you Yelp) then this is the place to dine. It was like a bonus or getting upgraded concert tickets. It was a different experience to watch all the chefs/cooks/scientists in action. 

The food was amazing. There are not too many things on the menu and tapas style or sharing is encouraged. Our server recommended 4 dishes is usually good for 2 people, but I pushed it to 5. I like to push boundaries. I appreciated the menu because you can get a little bit of everything at a reasonable price. The plates started at about $8 and slowly crawled their way up. 

We had the gyro tacos which were an excellent choice. Paired that with some rainbow cauliflower (had a little bit of a spicy kick to it), grilled and flavored with garlic and lemon juice. The beet and goat cheese salad was a good selection as well. I tasted the shrimp and antebellum grits that my wife ordered. The shrimp had a really good flavor and was a little spicy. 

If you are a huge fan of their food, there is a large swear jar at the bar for you to tip. Just yell out any expletive to share your joy in the excitement of the food. The money is then split between all the cooks and they have a large party to celebrate their success. 

Overall, great place to do something different in Vegas if you are a visitor like me. I try to stay away from buffets and commercialized spots on the strip. Come out and support this great small business. I forgot to mention the playlist inside was great.

Their rootbeer glazed pork sliders were the best thing I've ever had. The duck confit flatbread with fig jam and Gorgonzola was fantastic. The beef Wellington empanadas were served with a red wine reduction and I absolutely loved them. We topped off the night with a bourbon brownie served with bacon butter cream Ice cream. We wanted to eat everything on the menu, and we know we will be back next time we are in town. As a tourist, it was nice to come to an actual foodie place, and then hop over to Fremont street to walk off all of the amazing comfort food. Plates are smaller- like tapas style, and they make for a great date/small party. My favorite part is that you will most likely be sitting a community table or a bar that faces the staff. This setup enhances the fun experience by forcing you to engage with everyone around you. We eat at a lot of fun places in Denver and Chicago, and I must say this has been one of the best experiences I've had in a long time. The best part- our bill was waaaaay lower than expected!

1425927,2016-10-21,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Visiting Vegas from out of town. After a long day at the Grand Canyon tour we wanted something good to eat but off the strip. So a Google search and Yelp search brought us here. I saw Yelp said it wasn't good for kids but I always caution that recommendation as I feel people lend towards a no go for kids if the place also has full bar. So I called talked to the hostess and said hey is there formal dining seating that would be appropriate for me to bring my teenage daughter and whether the place was kid friendly - hostess said yes definitely.  

We took a lyft there and drove by it twice. The place is hard to find and Yelp says 124 but door says 100. Got in there and place is way smaller than I imagined. Then the seating isn't that formal. We were seated at an extension of the bar with other patrons. It was a high table top. I asked if we could change and per the hostess they had nothing else - disappointed in this aspect. In true hipster fashion form preceded function as seating layout is below average (and I'm a millennial so it's not like I'm a old head who doesn't understand).  Due to the seating layout I wouldn't recommend this place for children - which is fine but it would have been nice to been informed that on the phone when I inquired. Decor was nice. 

Drinks - my aunt and I can ordered bar drinks - wine for aunt, mixed for me. Drinks were great, expensive but I think the environment/location warranted it. Nothing too crazy. 

Appetizers - Burnt Ends and Deviled Eggs. Burnt ends were good, BBQ sauce a little too sweet but overall really good,I'd order again. Bread that came with it was not really edible, kind of stale. Deviled eggs had crispy pancetta and caviar on them. Pancetta was too crispy like a hard bacon bit, it would have been better if it had a little more give to it. The caviar didn't really add much of anything, the filling was good. 

Entrees - we all ordered the butter burger. Burger was good and butter taste was phenomenal. The sharp cheese wasn't melted on burger and wasn't the right type of cheese for a burger, they also gave two slices of cheese which was way too much for a sharp cheese andthat was the only disappointing factor. Spicy tots weren't spicy but they were yummy. 

Service - service was slow but people were personable in there. 

Next time I'm in Vegas I wouldn't come back but glad I tried it. Definitely a true hipster restaurant.",3VFH-yuHU-G7-BlxX5W8BQ,1,0,3,M9hOSPzslfT1-cR00P9lTQ

We had a large party (approx. 30 people) so we took up the majority of the upstairs patio. The weather this month in LV has been crazy so it was pretty windy and chilly! I wish they had space heaters, but who would have thought it would be 60 degrees in May in Las Vegas! I don't blame them for not being prepared.

The restaurant is super cool and trendy. Small intimate bar when you walk in and a cool patio and fire pit outside if you want some fresh air. The upstairs patio is spacious with a pretty view of the courthouse lit up at night. 

Because we are a larger group, we had a fixed menu of items to try, but of course I took a peak at the regular menu. The variety of food sounds awesome and there were so many items I wanted to try. Their liquor menu is definitely unique. My husband ordered a vodka and the vodka that they suggested was a variety I have never heard before and I know my vodka!! ;) I am excited to come back and try the large variety of menu items and liquors.

We started with the tempura green beans which were a little on the cold side (probably because it was so cold outside), but I really enjoyed the aioli dipping sauce. We next tried the sliders which were very flavorful and tasty, definitely one of my more favorite items. We received the tater tots at the same time and they weren't anything special, but who am I to complain about deep-fried spuds, I'm all in!! We also tried the rainbow cauliflower which was so unique and I loved the vinegar sauce it was tossed in! The crispy chicken skins with honey was so interesting and tasty. We also tried the bacon jam which was so so unique. I probably would not order that again, but I am glad I tried it! Again, it was a tad on the cold side probably because it was so chilly outside. We also got potatoes with garlic, which if you put garlic on anything I will love it! But the BEST item we received was the bread pudding. The pudding is made with donuts from nearby and they are glazed. It was so yummy that we asked for seconds!!

The service was great and patient considering we had a large party of hungry people. I thought our server particularly was so friendly, wish I got his name! I cannot wait to try Carson Kitchen again.

Walking in, the decor was nice. I liked the communal tables.  The host was a good looking guy but seems grumpy.  Didn't smile once while we were looking over the menu.  

We usually like the bar so decided to sit there.  It was about 430 and relatively quiet.  You would they would have even more time to be attentive.  Wrong.  The guy behind the bar was busy the whole time stacking glasses and stocking beer.  Felt like we walked in too early and before they opened or something.  He was rushing to get everything done.  He did take our order and our food came out in reasonable time but serving us was more of an afterthought. 

This would have been ok if the food lived up to 4 stars and it did not.  Everything was over salted.  We ordered the tempura green beans and oxtail risotto based on good review.  Green beans was ok, crispy but some were salty.  Felt like someone put salt at the end but didn't spread it even. First bite or the oxtail risotto was good.  A burst of flavor and richness.  Unfortunately more bites made us realized it was also over seasoned.   I asked for a slice of bread to eat with it. and he said he had to charge me.  That's okay.

I got the Jerk Turkey burger with tater tots. Good, big and filling. My buddy got the osso bucco. Don't get this. It was two pieces, mostly bone and fat. a LOT of fat. One piece, was so fatty they should have been embarrassed. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the food, how it was prepared and such. That was nice. We brought to the attention of the bartender and his response was, ""that's osso bucco right?"". We really didn't like his response. You get nothing with it but the osso bucco and there was nothing hardly to eat AND it was $16. But the turkey burger was good although it was $14 I believe. A gal near us at the bar got some tempura green beans that looked really good. I think those are $8. We each got a dessert. I love sweets. I got the brownie with the butter bacon ice cream. The brownie was cold and rock hard. They should microwave it warm, then add the ice cream. I would NOT get that again. And it cost $8! The glazed donut bread pudding was good though. Get that. But share with someone as one is enough for two people. Besides it cost $8 as well. But get it and share it. Oh and there are only a few tables. The smallest being for 6 people.

The food really came in to play here.  My friend and I started off with the gyro tacos. My friend, never having gyro before, trusted me with this decision. They were decadent! The lamb was so moist, and just enough of a portion to not fill you up. This actually ended up being my friends favorite dish by far! Definitely out of this world tacos' for a little restaurant. 
For the main courses we got one of their burgers and the mac and cheese. Easily some of the best mac and cheese I have ever had. So sad the potion was small, I could have easily eaten maybe 3 of them for how good it tasted. 
I'm really picky with my burgers, and it didn't really do it for me. Definitely a good burger, but I would recommend other things on the menu too, I got it medium rare, something I'm not use to.

At any rate once we found it the reception was excellent. It was a rainy evening so the upper patio was unavailable. We were seated at the bar where we could see the kitchen and the orders coming out so we had an opportunity to see the various dishes while we had a drink or two. Our waitress was excellent and the manager who was checking out the dishes was very nice. As we asked what things were he would tell us.

We started with a couple of appetizers. The spicy shrimp was tasty and the gyro tacos were very good. We then had some Mac and cheese, Cuban pork belly sandwich, and some pan seared chicken thighs. It should be noted that the tots that came with the Cuban are extraordinary. My girlfriend is a self avowed tot expert and she gave them a thumbs up.


The best thing about our experience was that the Sou chef was willing to share the recipes and ingredients with us. The other chefs chimed in to make it an intimate experience.

I did wish the crab fondue just came with bread but I can see how some would desire a textural contrast. For myself I prefer just the bread. Proteins were well seasoned.

The entire place is open so you can watch the kitchen operate from just about any seat in the restaurant.  

The cocktail list is fun and interesting.  The purple haze and town's end were both terrific cocktails.

The food really shined here and the small plate approach makes trying lots of dishes possible.  I would say a group of 3 or 4 would be perfect here. We had the deviled eggs, fried green beans and bacon jam as our appetizers.  The deviled eggs and fried beans were spot on. The bacon jam tasted a little burnt but was still highly edible.  We then moved on to the rabbit ragu and oxtail risotto, both of which are worth going back for.  We were really too full for dessert but decided to try the day old donut bread pudding anyways.

We occupied the outdoor private patio for the evening. It was nice that it had a separate bar and our servers tried to make it as comfortable as possible for us with blankets and patio heaters for the unseasonably windy/chilly Spring evening. 

But, let's get down to business - everything was so dang good. There was seriously not a mediocre dish on the menu. The wonderfully curated menu is also a product of Nikki B's fantastic tastebuds, so shout out to the bride as well! 

*Crispy Chicken Skins (smoked honey): The chicken skins were beautifully crispy and delicious without being oily. The touch of sweetness from the smoked honey was perfect. 

*Bacon Jam (baked brie, toasted baguette): Definitely burned my tongue on this dish because I was being hasty and I wanted to try it ASAP. Delicious combination with the sweet and savory bacon jam and creamy  baked brie. 

*Tempura Green Beans (pepper jelly cream cheese): The pepper jelly cream cheese reminded the table of pimento! Yum. The green beans were perfectly battered and fried. 

*Wild Mushroom Flatbread (basil pistou): I love me some mushroom and I love me some flatbread. I really enjoyed the pickled red onion on this. Helped to add some zing. 

*Rainbow Cauliflower (garlic, lemon): Definitely leaned tangy from the lemon, but I enjoyed the palate cleanse. 

*New York Strip (cocoa-espresso, red wine demi): PERFECTLY cooked. It was so tender that I didn't even need a steak knife to cut it. Also, cocoa-espresso is some next level Food Network stuff -- meaning I'm too lazy to make it myself at home, but I see it on the time on TV. & now that I have finally tried this combo, I feel like I can't go back to plain ol' salt & pepper! 

*Chicken Thighs (mint chimichurri): Very tender! I also loved it with chimichurri. I don't think I've had the combo of chicken & chimichurri before. 

*Black Rice Risotto: Yum! Great foundation for all the great protein we had. 

There were 3 addt'l dessert items, but we were all so full that the delicious wedding cake was enough. WHEW, it was a food marathon and we were champs.

They were fairly busy I do have to say the service was fairly good. Order the mushroom flatbread that is 12 dollars. It was just ok. It did have a lot of ingredients on it. So at least they weren't skipping out. I felt the crust was too soggy in the middle and when you tried pick it up & eat it it would fall apart. And the crust around the outside was super chewy and just did not taste good. One of my other diners got the scallops and it was three tiny scallops for $17. She was a little bit irritated. If it's only going to be 3 scallops then it should at least be the large sea scallops. There are plenty of other places to eat downtown if that's what the price of the scallops are.

Tasted like mildly flavored cucumber instead, but still killed it. Both entrees were good, we kept joking around saying the burger was A PERFECT burger bc it came out and you could see each ingredient between the bun, perfectly and everything was lined up, evenly. The salad was so fresh and I loved the vinaigrette it came with.

The food- wow the menu is really fun and fresh. Our table had quite a few things that were shared and I loved every bite I took. 

Best watermelon salad ever, get it TRUST ME! The fried green beans were delicious too! I got a sample of the fig/pork belly dish and loved it too. Pretty much all the food was phenomenal.

Sneak out to the back patio, what a space and beautiful murals too. We had fun sitting out in the evening.  

only downside was that one of the staff didnt know how to take when someone made an observation they didnt like to hear. It's a lil crappy to be told I didnt know what I was talking about when I said my chicken was under cooked on one area close to the non-grilled side. He actually said it very cocky ""we know how to cook chicken"". So do I, but the customer is always right!!! especially, since I have taken multiple cooking classes and food safety and cook chicken to temp all the time. There was a gooey corner with a pink shiny dot, I was sure. You dont have to be a chef to see a textural difference and a different color on the lower 3 slices and not on the others. The lighting was dark, but I could see the inconstancy a mile away and used my phone light to verify, 3 food bloggers at our table, we all checked it before I commented quietly and discreetly to the server. I still give a 5 star because the flavor was through the roof amazing. It was safe to eat, but I wanted them to know, incase it was a missed at the pass. The staff was fun and friendly and I didnt want to lessen my rating based on one guy or let him ruin my night.

When we called they said it was an hour/hour and a half wait.  Shit.  When we got there, we were seated immediately and there didn't seem to be any wait at all.
Teeny tiny super hipster restaurant.  We were seated right at the pass next to the adorable Cory Harwell, which was a delightful experience.  We got to watch every item come out of the kitchen.  There is a lot of love put into each plate and it was pretty obvious from sitting there.  

We started with the Bread pudding, yes, you read that correctly.  We overheard the staff talking about this bread pudding that had no home so my friend eagerly said, ""we'll take it!""  Um, ok, we'll start with dessert.  What a great start, though.  So yummy!!

Drinks took a little while to get and they were out of ginger beer to make the drink I really wanted, but I ordered something else and it was great.  

We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, which was very tasty for a typically boring appetizer.  My friend is one of those annoying pescatarians so if we were sharing an appetizer, it had to be non-meat.  It's too bad cause there were about 10 things I wanted to try that looked amazing like the bacon jam and the empanadas.  

At one point I inquired about the chicken skins we kept seeing and Mr. Harwell, made me a little plate of them to try.  Such a nice guy!  And they were ridiculously good!

My friend had the fried green tomato sandwich and I had the short rib sliders.  Both were served with tater tots.  Both meals were perfect.  

The staff/service was great albeit stereotypical hipster central.  I think half-way through our meal our server donned new red rim eye glasses.  Very cool.  Very hipster.  The most hipstery thing that happened though was that Tony Hsieh walked in...he frequents all the hipster hot spots, as he is like the hipster golden calf.  

The bill was extremely reasonable.  4 drinks, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 1 side (cauliflower- so good!) and the bill came to I think $85.  Strip food with downtown pricing.  Love it!  

Oh, and on the way home we tried to figure out what our hipster ""names"" would be.  I think I settled on Schotti or Dylan and my friend landed on Irma.  We will definitely be back!",nQC0JiPIk_jCooRDxpuw5A,2,1,5,KFOtv3_j_eeCzLdBNQ8oKQ

We had the empanadas which were a disappointment.  The flavor was odd or off, unappetizing -- maybe it's the mushrooms.  One of the empanadas was half filled with gristle & fat which the eater spit out onto her plate.  We debated sending the dish back, hard to do when it comes with 4 bites and everyone took one.

We had the bacon jam which was good, make sure to get the extra toast.
Then we had devil eggs which were average, not notable in any way except for a little caviar.  Beet salad which was fine.  The tomatoes in the stacked salad were not ripe -- something you might buy at cheap grocery store.  I know it's not quite tomato season, but the bland, hard meat of the tomato spoiled the dish.  The short rib sliders which were superb with with sweetly root beer sauce (and tater tots on the side).  I could probably eat these every day.  This would be my go-to item.  The mushroom flat bread was very good.  The gyros soft tacos were over salted.

The service was wonderful.

The scores for the food were 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3, for an average a little over 3.  Very uneven food.  The rating should be 3.5.  Somewhere between ""A-Okay"" and ""I'm a fan"".  If we had had only the sliders, bacon jam, and flat bread we might have been looking a 5 star rating.  The service makes we want to push the rating to 4, but the empandas and tomatoes make me want to keep it at three.  The food will win.  3 stars.",uyqE8kvAq2LxPnm385T6NA,2,1,3,iQvnImetwAwRhYnBnJVLkg

Carson Kitchen's menu is refreshing and worth every penny. 

I was with a group of friends and everything we ordered far exceeded what we expected. We had ordered the deviled eggs and chicken skins to start off with. 

The eggs were so soft and very airy and the chicken skins were the crunchiest I've ever had. 

We each ordered different entrees, but we had ordered the butter burger, which was a perfect medium-rare, the chicken thighs, rabbit ragu, and the black rice risotto. 

I ordered the risotto and it was a smooth, creamy texture and the black rice was al dente, just how I like it. The rabbit ragu was hearty and the rabbit wasn't very gamey. The butter burger was juicy and flavourful and the chicken thighs with chimichurri were herby and light.

1673504,2018-03-15,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I was very disappointed with Carson Kitchen. This is our 5th time here over the last several years. It was my birthday and they kinda ruined for me. First two times we came were great. Third time just okay. Last year just okay. This time (Sunday 3/11) a real disappointment. So we were put at the counter by the kitchen which is fine. Told them it was my birthday & they just looked at me. So we are at the counter & the server runs by to take our drink order. Delivers drinks & takes our order. We order, deviled eggs, mac & cheese, chicken skins w/ honey and the Pig & Fig flatbread. Kitchen seemed extremely chaotic and a female chef seemed annoyed. In the meantime other people were being seated & we noticed that they were getting their food before us & we were there 10 minutes before. We are done with our drinks and no one asked us if we wanted another. So the deviled eggs came first & they were good but needed salt badly. I am not a salt person meaning I use it sparingly so these were really lacking. Another wait & the flatbread comes out. Sloppy looking and VERY DRY. A smattering of goat cheese, handful of arugula and the pork belly was dry, in fact almost like jerky. Dough was tasteless & again needed salt & the whole thing was under seasoned. Another lengthy wait & the chicken skins come up. BIG disappointment as I do believe they needed to be fried better and longer. Most of these were NOT crispy & had absorbed too much oil in pockets of the skin so when we bit into them oil actually squirted out! The honey had NO smoke flavor at all & AGAIN this dish needed some salt. Serve STILL has not asked if we want another drink. I had to yell to get her attention. So now we are waiting ,waiting and we see a mac & cheese come up but the table behind us who came in BTW AFTER us by 10 minutes gets the mac & cheese! Huh? Female chef looks up at us and says ""Hey sorry guys but it's gonna be a wait for your mac & cheese!"" And then she says that that's the way it goes! Really? So we tell the guy delivering the food that hey, we have been waiting a LONG time now we don't want it. We are done eating & hey thanks for ruining my birthday which you never acknowledged! Can't even get good service. So the guy tells the female chef to cancel our mac and cheese & she says well I just talked to them & they are fine with it & it is already made! HUH? REALLY? WHEN did we say we were okay with it? And how rude to talk that way! So then he has the nerve to tell us he is boxing it up for us to take it! NOPE!! Sorry you F'd up big time. They are lucky they got 2 stars and I will not ever eat here again period. I know a lot about food & I am a gourmet cook & I also know what bad service is. So who stamped our foreheads with a big zero? Never asked if we wanted coffee or even dessert. It was my birthday for Christ's sake! You'd think after the F up on the mac & cheese they would try. NOPE no can do I guess. We weren't rude, and we tried to understand. It was just bad period.",WZRv5LBXPeXPlx3_KegiEw,0,0,2,1cHG_sRD6U7tbecdCKXInA

Their chairs have no backs and are all ""bar stool"" style. My husband has back issues and for him when a place does not have booths or seating with some type of back support it can be a deal breaker.
We were seated promptly and presented with a modest but quality cocktail list. We opted for beverages of the non adult kind, but they did seem to have some creative cocktails on the menu. 
I chose their scallops with rainbow cauliflowers which were phenomenal. The scallop was cooked to perfection in their mango habanero sauce. I don't know what they do to the cauliflower, but it was delicious, crunchy and slightly charred for the added flavor. My husband had their Cuban sandwich with the fingerling potatoes. That was one of the better spins on a Cuban sandwich I have experienced in a very long time. The bread was fresh and crispy and the inside was an explosion of flavor. The fingerling potatoes were garnished with parmesan cheese and truly were nothing to write home about. 
The server was accommodating and friendly. Our check arrived in a book which serves as some type of a guest book where you can write in feedback or random comments. The prices are not cheap, but the food is worth it. The scallops were $17 and the cauliflower side order $8. Keep in mind it comes with three small scallops that are bursting with flavor.

Bacon jam - jam is too strong, can't really taste the bacon.  I wish that there is more cheese and more bread.
Crispy chicken skin - excellent.  Great with the honey dipping.  
Devil's egg - average.  We order it because a lot of yelper recommended it but it's just like other devil's egg.  Maybe I was expecting too much.
NY Strip - excellent.  Meat is soft.  Very juicy.  Very tasty.
Ancient grain greek (salad) - Good.
Black rice & ox tail Risotto - Good.  But the taste is very subtle.  I wish for a stronger taste.
Mac-Cheese - Good, but it's too expensive for what it is.
Pear & Bleu flatbread - love it.

The bartender said there were going to expand in the coming months to take over the tattoo shop next door, where they will have a proper bar.

All the waitresses wear old rock and roll t-shirts, I asked about it and the gals said the owner used to cater for bands.  We ordered a bunch of things to split (apparently the menu changes quarterly):

-Gyro tacos
-Crispy chicken skin - Never seen this on a menu, served with honey, we asked for hot sauce too, which they should just serve with it
-Black risotto with oxtail - Loved it, want to try and find black rice to re-create it
-Veal Meatballs with a sherry fois gras cream sauce - these were my favorite!

We were sat overlooking the kitchen in hightop's that were very comfy and I immediately loved everything because watching the magic happen is always a good thing in my book. The chefs were hot so that helps too. Nothing like tatted men who know how to cook! 

The food was really good. Started with the devil eggs that were creamy and salty from the caviar & pancetta. Next came the sizzling bacon jam with Brie which was so sweet that I had to keep drinking my water. The finale was the butter burger and anything with the word ""butter"" in it can't go wrong. This burger is very simple with traditional toppings but tasted amazing. On the side came spicy tots that were the perfect amount of hot. All in all the food was great and we wanted to try everything on the menu so with that said we can't wait to go back. 

The atmosphere is very casual with a very cool vibe. The staff is very friendly and we loved all the interesting people around us who made the experience.

From the outside, it's extremely lowkey. You have to know it's there to happen upon it. Luckily, we knew exactly where we wanted to go. The inside is incredible. The tables, chairs, lights, etc are beautiful. It looks like it is straight out of an interior design magazine. I was absolutely blown away by it. It's also entirely open from the bar to the dining room to the kitchen. It's very small, yet quaint and cozy. 

The staff is spot on. The hostess was extremely nice to us and worked us in where she could since it was pretty much totally booked. Our waiter was also great. He went over the menu and gave great recommendations. I loved the entirety of the staff. It seemed like they were all best friends, and I would love to hang out with them. 

The food was AMAZING. It's all tapas serving style, so get several plates and share it all! We got a ton of different dishes, and I will give a brief report on each of them. 

The young beets has beets (two kinds), grapes, and goat cheese. I love the goat cheese, and the beets were really tasty!

The veal meatballs were also very good. They were spicy, but also had a sweet taste. They were perfectly cooked, not too dry.

The crispy chicken skin was a great way to start. They taste like really light fried chicken and they come with a honey dipping sauce. 

The pig and fig flat bread was not what I expected. It's like a pizza with fig paste sauce, pork two ways, and arugula. It was both sweet and savory, perfectly balanced! 

The baked Mac and cheese was INCREDIBLE. It was extra cheesy and creamy. I have no doubt it was the best Mac and cheese I have ever had. Wow. 

The real star of the show was the glazed donut bread pudding. This is by far the best dessert I've ever had in my life. It was so sweet, milky, and caramelized. It literally melted in your mouth and left you wanting more and more. I may have shed a few tears eating it. 

Everything was presented in a very cool way. The unique bowls and boards were such a nice touch. Our check even came stuck into the pages of a book. I loved everything about my experience here.",uUngdsRMAcMCStA90zXsAQ,3,4,5,OWvXS4ofQidtt0h2WFQGdw

Kerry Simon is known for these twists on sweet American junk food so this play on Twinkies is in his wheel house. They are really moist and the mandarin oranges work well.

My boyfriend works downtown and suggested this place since it was close to his work.  Definitely a trendy, hipster place.  The waitresses were dressed in jeans and various music group T-shirts.  We were immediately seated by Chelsea who was rocking a Led Zeppelin T-shirt (I liked her already!).  They have various tables and seating in a big square around the bar.  We opted to sit up at the bar.  My coffee arrived quickly and Chelsea never let it get below half full (coffee drinkers always appreciate that!).  After a few minutes exploring the menu my friend and I decided to split the gyro tacos and the bacon jam.  The tacos were perfect size with spicy lamb meat inside topped with feta cheese, traditional Greek tzatziki sauce, and tomatoes.  Yummy!  The bacon jam was a piping hot mix of bacon, cheese, and a sweet flavor infused.  It was served with crispy sliced baguette bread.  Another hit.  

During lunch Carson Kitchen fills up fast.  There was a mix of casually dressed 20 somethings to middle aged business men/women.  They have a rooftop bar and an impressive libations menu as well.

1744666,2017-05-13,4,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"A restaurant is judged not only by the food they put out but also by the service they provide. Tonight I was super excited to try out Carson Kitchen. I left unimpressed and actually a bit offended by the waiter's service. 

Initially, the night started off alright. He introduced himself (I forgot his name) and was attentive enough. He gave us waters and recommended that we get about 2 plates/person as this restaurant mainly has small plates that are meant to be shared. We followed his advice and ordered 6 plates total. Halfway through the meal, the service started going downhill. We had 4 plates of food still on our table when he asked us if we were doing okay/if we wanted to order. 6 plates is a lot of food, so we said we were good and didn't order. He came back at least 2 more times while we were having our savory dishes to ask if we wanted to order more. That's a little overkill, especially considering that we already got his recommended amount of plates. When we wanted to order dessert, he was nowhere in sight, and we ended up having to wave at him from across the room. And then he tried pushing for us to try all three desserts. Dude, we're full. He also kept asking us if we wanted more than iced water. I think after the second time of telling him that we were okay with just water, he would get the hint. At the very end of the meal, he also gave us attitude when we asked if we could split the bill three ways. Honestly, he could have easily just told us no and been done with that. There are apps like Venmo; I can work around not being able to split a bill. Instead, he made the rest of the night super awkward as he hovered over us as we tipped him with the portable credit card machine. 

We ordered:
crispy chicken skins - one of the better dishes of the night. You can't go wrong with fried food, and the smoked honey is a nice accompaniment.
bacon jam - They put a lottttttt of balsamic vinegar in this; it was a little too tangy for me. I would put more cheese to balance out the vinegar. It has also an odd texture and reminds me of diced up Asian beef jerky.
black rice and oxtail risotto - They advised to mix the dish up thoroughly before eating. There was a familiar taste to it, but I couldn't place a finger on it. It was alright.... 
baked mac and cheese - They have a pretty sharp cheese in that blend of whatever cheeses they use. It's nice. They also browned the top with some breadcrumbs; the added crunch was a nice change in texture
green, eggs, & ham - It smelled of smoky deliciousness. The eggs were overcooked so we couldn't ""spread the egg"" to the other pieces of flatbread, like we were advised. However, it also smelled exactly like the wild mushroom flatbread from the table next to us; so I'm going to assume that they taste also similar'
glazed donut bread pudding - this was the star of the night. Get this.


Despite the chicken skins and the dessert, the service I experienced today makes it difficult to want to ever come back.

I found Carson Kitchen highly rated on Yelp and was staying a short walk away from the D hotel.  It was quite busy on a weeknight and I think I would not have gotten in if I weren't alone and willing to sit at the bar.

That turned out to be the best place to be, as the service and hospitality were outstanding.  After I insisted, the bartender selected and made me one of their menu cocktails, which was quite good and not something I was used to.

We got to talking, along with another patron and Carson Kitchen regular.  Expressing skepticism that their turkey burger could be edible, as it was, a turkey burger, a heated exchange ensued and a challenge was issued.  They got me to agree to order a Turkey burger, claiming it has won competitions with serious beef burgers around town.

First came the deviled eggs which, with caviar and bacon, were very good and went quickly.  At this point we were all friends at the bar and the eggs were shared - it was that kind of vibe.

The Turkey Burger:  Firstly, the tots.  Mmmmmm....  Oh how good - perfect tater tots with ketchup.  Nice color and crunch.  10/10

The burger was very good and I'm glad I ordered it.  It was not a good alternative to a beef burger (sorry) but can stand on its own a separate type of food entirely.  If you strongly desire a great beef burger - stay away!  If you just want something delicious, then seriously consider it.  The complexity of flavors was very well done and the overall result had me clean my plate.

What a pleasure to sit at the bar with Felicia and her loyal patrons for a delicious meal.  Also thanks for the samples, barman with nice hair.

Be warned they close early for Vegas and they will run out of popular dishes, so go early.",QwgXJvwctxwaDBIYoKteoQ,1,2,5,qRR20qTfkqQov8CTqKaRRg

So not Las Vegas and I mean that in a good way.  High marks for atmosphere, good marks for food quality. Pricing is a bit deceiving.  Not expensive but not low to medium priced as the reviews show.  Maybe it is more a case enjoying my time and continuing to eat!

I would call Carson Kitchen large tapas bistro style.  The caprese was very nice and tomatoes were good even though they were closer to commissary than the local farm.  The rabbit ragu with spaghetti squash was excellent!  The coffee crusted NY strip was very flavorful but in a town known for beef it would benefit from using aged beef.  

Overall, I would definitely go back!",Zj6ZZkHuOW7uC6WFLDD1Ag,0,0,4,hS424fggNhbrIHp4G1o7Yw

Was a little skeptical about how how it was going to be when seated at the bar near the kitchen, but quickly cooked down and was in for a treat watching the food prep by the staff. Our server was super sweet (yay for Bianca!) and she told my friend and I how most of the food is made for sharing since it all tends to come out at different times as it is ready. We went with the bacon jam for starters, and when it came out bubbling and looking like it would scald our mouths, we were glad to heed their advice am give it a minute to cool down if we wanted to taste any of the rest of our meal. Bacon jam was really good, but I would have been content with only a bite or two due to richness and salt factor. I got the FGT sliders, (fried green tomato) with crab salad on top and spicy tots. It was so delicious, but tots were way over seasoned so I only had a few of those. My friend got the Mac and cheese, which was cheesy goodness, but pools of oil were evident like a minute after it came out so she only ate half. This amount of food was waaay more than we could finish, and was sad to not have a fridge in our hotel room to enjoy later in our stay.  Would definitely return. Over all for 3 plates and a coke it was $50, so a bit pricey, but fun for the show of watching the dishes being made, and really liked our server Bianca!",aeYovuZ2XraNwrUYrJPwkA,0,0,4,kJVAOFzk6cAi5XLHtV5tKg
1794152,2014-07-23,3,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"This is the problem with the 'new downtown.' The attitude of these new business owners is abhorrent. They come here to Vegas, full of pompous flatulence. They believe that since they are ""new and hip,"" that the general public should bend over and keep their mouth shut.

Yes, you did invite me to go into further detail. However, unlike you, (whom I was well aware of your presence while we dined because you sat right behind us), I have my own business to run.I also advised you that as soon as I had a chance I would be more than happy to discuss. I was there only 2 days ago. 

I am a Vegas native, born and raised. In fact, my family opened one of the first ethnic restaurants here in the late 50's. I grew up working there so I know a little about the food industry.

So, here are the issues in greater detail.

We arrived at approximately 13:45. We were a party of 6. Upon stepping in, we were greeted with several looks of disdain. The ""what the hell do these people want"" look of disdain. However, the subsequent customers that walked in were greeted with smiles. I guess I should have come in my skinny jeans and plaid shirt.

Once we were greeted by your hostess, we had requested the table in the corner to avoid the sun. We were told that that table was unavailable. (Come to find out it was unavailable because you were going to sit there). 

We sat down at the table directly behind the hostess stand. The waitress did not come greet us until approximately 5 minutes after we sat down. At which time she asked us if we were ready to order. We stated not yet as we just had  sat down. She took our  drink order ( Three waters, no ice. Three waters with ice with lemons. One cup of coffee and an iced tea.  
She returned with four glasses of water, two with and two without ice. No lemons. Coffee and iced tea were delivered (without accompaniments) She asked again whether we were ready to order again. To which we stated we would like more time. Her face expression at that moment was best described as utter contempt. Then she just stood there at the table with that same look which she shared with another staff member as they walked by. 
To attempt on getting her to not stand there, my colleague and sister both asked the waitress (Paige-according to my bill) for sweetener for my father's iced tea and cream for my aunt's coffee. To which she replied, ""sweetener? Oh yeah, we have that."" Then it took a good three seconds for her to physically react. As she reached for the sweetener caddy, she remarked, ""oh, we have syrup too."" She proceeded to as your bartender for the syrup where I overheard her ask for the 'simple syrup.'
My sister said, ""oh, that's nice but is it Agave syrup, because my dad is diabetic."" Waitress handed the syrup to my sister stammering something about ,"" yeah it is... it's syrup... yeah it's  AH GAH BAY... uh yeah it's mixed in there. "" My sister inspected it and it appeared to be simple syrup. Coupled with the waitress' response, I told my sister not to give it to my dad and to not trust her statement.

Then we indicated we were ready to order. We ordered the broccoli crunch, gyro tacos, deviled eggs and the chicken skins. She asked us if we were ready to oder our entrees to which we replied, ""yes.""

My dad ordered the Chicken Thighs. My sister added three more orders of the Thighs to cover my aunt, colleague, and mother. My sister proceeded to ask about the oxtail risotto about what it's like. Waitress responded, ""it's good..."" as though she wasn't so sure herself. At that point, supervisor,? manager? walked over to waitress and whispered something to her. She then in turn stated, almost accusatorially, ""the manager just told me we are out of the chicken thighs.""

oh ok.

""What else do you want to order?"" To which we all said, ""since there are no thighs, we would like a few more moments to look at our options."" She huffed and walked away. She proceeded to step away and stand at the hostess table occasionally glaring back at the table as if we had done something wrong. 

Once our food order was placed, you and your colleagues sat behind us. Your food arrived very quickly. Ours didn't. As I stated in the prior review, one bite of Chicken Skins told me that the lack of proper flavoring was compensated by immersion of MSG. 

The risotto was a gloppy tasteless mess. My dad stated,"" they must've just waved the oxtail over this mess. I can't taste anything that resembles oxtail in it.""

The deviled eggs were runny and small. The butter burger had no real flavor but for the fancy cheese that was on it. The flatbreads were average in flavor and taste. 

The short rib sliders were overcooked and very small. 

At no time did our waitress come to check on us after the food was delivered nor were our drinks refilled. 

I wrote the prior review as I sat there and watched you and your staff react to it. Only problem was that nothing was done for your diners that were there.

1800401,2016-07-22,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Before going to the Smith Center, we usually try to dine in one of the downtown restaurants. This time we chose Carson kitchen based on the very positive yelp reviews.
Ambiance: despite the fact that the address is on 6th street, the entrance to the restaurant is on Carson. There are dining three areas, indoors, the first floor patio, and an upstairs patio. It was 105° and windy the day we ate at Carson kitchen so the two outdoor eating areas were not real option. The indoor eating area is rather stark and very small. We were party of six and ended up sharing a hightop table with a party of two strangers (nice guys). The table right next to us was another party of six. Unfortunately, they were VERY loud, which doesn't do well in a very small room. They really weren't doing anything wrong. It just makes dining very unpleasant when someone is that loud in that small of a room.
Service: Chelsea, our server, came to our table almost as soon as we sat down. Since we were first timers, she explained the menu and answered questions and made some suggestions. Very warm and welcoming. Overall, excellent service.
Food: We started with shared tempura green beans. Yummm. We also shared the bacon jam. Very tasty. When we ran out of the bread, we ended up putting it on our other dishes (I even ate some straight up - also very good!!) I shared the Margherita Pizza/Flatbread. Excellent!! I also shared the Cocoa expresso NY Strip Steak. Prepared the way we requested but a bit tougher than I like. Just OK.
Overall, the service was 5 star, the food 4 star, but the ambiance made the dining unpleasant. Perhaps I will return on a night we can sit out on the upstairs patio and really enjoy the food. But I would not go back when the only option is to dine indoors.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,0,0,3,UNFMT2YS9wNyRK0M86sRSA
1803777,2017-12-23,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Carson Kitchen has become a go-to favorite of mine in Downtown Las Vegas.  My most recent visit was truly exceptional.  The restaurant recently upgraded and expanded their dining area and the whole vibe has really improved.  The new tables and seating allow for more space between parties and really give a good amount of space to fill with the delicious shareable plates Carson has become known for.

My favorite items on the menu are the Burnt Ends (the pickles are INCREDIBLE!) and the Jerk Turkey Burger with mango chutney.  The flavoring is out of this world good.  I could easily eat either one on a VERY regular basis!

The bar, too, has improved and although I'm not one to drink a great deal with my meal, I know I can always find a delicious cocktail, beer or wine to pair with whatever I choose.  

The constant through all of the changes?  The service.  Dakota is definitely a fan-favorite of this reviewer and if you get a chance to stop by CK, ask for him and you'll see why.  Just the right amount of attention, great suggestions for both food AND drinks and a warm personality make for a fantastic service experience.

Bacon Jam -- 3 stars. It was good, and more than half of our group liked it, but I thought it was only OK. It's like bacon but sweetened into a jam. You can ask for additional bread, but they WILL charge you for the extra bread.

Tempura Green Beans -- 4 stars. Good, but probably not worth the calories.

Crispy Chicken Skins -- 4 stars. Good, but IMO not worth the calories.

Gyro Tacos -- 4 stars. Tasty, but for $11 you get only 3 small tacos.

Baked Mac & Cheese -- 4 stars. Good, super cheesy and creamy, but I would've liked some additional oomph -- would've been 5 stars with some crunchy topping and some bacon!

I can say from others reviews that it's a tricky place to get a table. When we arrived ( a party of 5 ) we were lucky to get the last table available! Mind you, this was on a Tuesday at 12 pm. So I can imagine the weekends and nights. 

Luckily since we were a bigger group (compared to me and either a food loving friend or my boyfriend) we were able to try a lot of what they serve. 

Their appetizer section is like tapas, and everything on the menu is served as it's made (I love that since you know it'll be fresh and hot). So what did we get?

Lamb Gyros - AMAZING. We ended up having them twice. They come with three and the flavor is just perfect. 
Burnt Ends - The flavor was great. I ate all the pickles and the dipping sauce was excellent. My only thing was they weren't as crispy as something that's burnt would be. 
Bacon Jam - Eh. I couldn't taste bacon and the Brie they give is like a sliver compared to whole dish it comes served in. I wouldn't order this again. 
Chicken Skins - The concept is cool, like chicarrones, but chicken. The honey dipping sauce made the dish, but idk if I'd order it again. My dad loved them because he's a fan of pork grinds, so it just depends on if you love fried skin lol
Chicken Sandwich - I loved it. It's a great size chicken breast and the sauce is so yummy. It comes with a side of Cajun tots and none of them were left over. 
NY Steak and Mac and Cheese - Both were excellent! Definitely worth ordering. 
Fig Flatbread - my sister and mom ordered it and they finished it so I guess it's another good dish.",yoBJL4FXulx0XwTki8U56Q,1,1,4,KzueJlKxtcUxa2pJoAvfng

on to the food
We had the crispy chicken skin, the italian sausage flatbread and the risotto.  
Now the hubs mistakenly ordered the skins thinking it would be a chicken finger-esque type thing.  They were spiced, not too salty and served with a dish of honey.  After eating the first i wasn't too sure, but they grew on me... sweet and savory, I would get it again.  
I had the flatbread, yummy, decent size... I recall it being called ""spicy Italian sausage flatbread"" without mention of the broccoli that was on it.  Very... Different... I tied it.. and ended up picking any of the larger pieces off.  
Hubbs had the risotto... Ox tail risotto.  Now being italian to me risotto is strictly made with arborio rice.  The end.  This was made with like a black wild rice... It had a bit more of  a bite than I would like, and that wild rice flavor... but was decent.  I would not get that again, but I know I'm very  picky when it comes to italian foods.  

Being monday afternoon I wasn't trying to get hammered, but did have the only apple hard cider they had, Ace i believe? It was the best cider I've ever had.

WATERMELON AND FETA SALAD: A classic summer salad, with cucumber and white balsamic. Great fruit dish that shines alongside Kerry Simon's excellent veggie dishes.
TEMPURA GREEN BEANS: This dish is addictive! Every table around us had an order, and after ours arrived we understood why. It's crunchy, it's savory, it's sweet with a bit of spice. The red pepper cream cheese is sinful. Just get it.
BLACK RICE & OXTAIL RISOTTO: Didn't quite have the usual risotto texture or consistency, but the dish itself was so savory and indulgent. Rich and flavorful, meatier than expected. 
GYRO TACOS: This was a bit of a letdown. Cool concept but poor execution. The pita taco shells are super dry and floury, and the taco filling was overly seasoned to the point that it didn't even resemble lamb.
BISON MEATLOAF SLIDERS: Awesome upgrade from the original Dr. Pepper sliders. The bison was moist and flavorful, complemented nicely by the crispy onions. Side of spicy tots was nicely seasoned and crunchy. If you aren't sharing as a group, this would be an adequate lunch portion.
THAI CHICKEN FLATBREAD: This was a fail for us. The cheese just didn't work with the other ingredients. The curry sauce was lackluster. The crisp veggies and crisp flatbread did not harmonize at all. 

As long as they keep turning out great dishes, I'll keep coming. But my original claim that their vegetable dishes are where they truly shine still stands. Service remains great, try the rooftop patio if you come by in the evening.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,6,4,9k8hrtFj3KoTd3o12qSguQ

We said we may consider eating elsewhere if we couldn't and she said, ""ok, let me know if you decide to stay"". A friend really wanted to eat there, so we stayed.

1874362,2018-05-24,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"So, as a Las Vegas local, my friend and i decided to go to Downtown Las Vegas to support local business and to try something new. Per Yelp recommendations and the recognition of the name ""Carson Kitchen"" by previous friend posts on social media we decided to try it out. We walk into the establishment's front door and no one was there to greet us at all. About 3-4 minutes of standing by the door, the male employee with the mustache who, as it seemed, was controlling all the order tickets, turned around and recognized my friend and i and said ""be right with you guys"" and we acknowledged with an ""ok."" A few minutes later, a couple walks in and stands just off to our right in which a caucasian make employee with a beard, wedding ring, and a pink jelly bracelet on his right wrist acknowledges them right away and recommends that they go to the bar and wait and he'll call them in about 20 minutes or so. Doesn't even look at my friend and i and offer the same accommodations and walks away, the 2 of us still standing by the front door with menus in hand so that we can order as soon as we get sat as the place closes in about 40 minutes. A female employee then approached us and asks if she can put us on the waitlist. Didn't even know there was one. I say ok and mention about how the guy with the beard totally ignored us. She apologized and offered us to wait at the bar... well guess what?! the couple who came in after us and WASNT ignored got the last two seats. Lucky us right? So then the guy with the beard takes over and puts our name on the waitlist. Again offers the bar or the back courtyard to wait. Well, can't do the bar so we walked to the back courtyard where i quickly jumped on Yelp! to find an alternative establishment in which to support local. Found Park on Fremont and the girls at the front were super friendly, accommodating and we were quickly sat and shortly there after, the server was at the table to take drink and food orders and made awesome recommendations. 

You only have one time to make a first impression and sadly, Carson Kitchen just didn't understand that. Again, as a Las Vegas local, i get asked by friend, family, and colleagues for recommendations for food and drink locales as i live here. Carson Kitchen wouldn't not be my first, second, third, fourth or even 50th choice just because of the way my friend and i were treated. Again, you have one time to make a first impression, and to say the least, i felt as if my friend and i didn't exist as opposed to the other 2 who walked in after us. 

Don't waste your time with this place because i certainly will never revisit this establishment and will voice my opinion to other social media outlets such as TripAdvisor, Eater, and other online sources that recommend restaurants.",md8PNkVPATmulaEmNSDY7g,0,0,1,N3reGPHBb4LMfSzpHtBJPg

1886392,2018-03-17,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"This was our second trip to Carson Kitchen in the desert.  We enjoyed it so much the first time, we came back with friends.   Located in an odd location in the Fremont area, don't blink, you will probably drive right passed.  Street parking near by is metered, so be sure to pay enough time so you're not interrupted meter feeding half way thru your meal.  

Restaurant was remodeled and expanded since our last visit.  Looks like they blew out the wall to extend the bar.  Funky modern vibe, lots of plaid and ""a lot more ink, a little less sleeve"" atmosphere.   The kitchen is open so you can see the chefs working their magic first hand.  As in any good chef's kitchen, noise was minimal.  No pots and pans banging about.

We felt the best way to experience Carson was to order a lot of appetizer bites for the entire table to share.   We ordered the bacon jam that's absolutely to die for yummy!  The Devil's eggs were good, but honesty....every picnic I've ever been to has their own rendition.  Theirs happened to be topped with caviar.   The veal meatballs with peas were outstanding!  Hard to have just one!  Melt in your mouth delicious.   Portions were good sized and enough for a table of 4 to share.  

One of us ordered the Secret Sunday Chicken sandwich.  Tender juicy chicken on an aioli smeared brioche bun.  Another at the table - dear Lord was on a diet in Vegas - ordered a Green Goddess Caesar salad.  

We all waited and salivated for dessert.   The Glazed Donut Bread pudding sounds heavy....but it's really a light treat. Caramel and rum covers a light fluffy donut.  Just enough to share with the table and get a few bites to satisfy you.  We liked it so much we nearly licked the bowl clean!  The Bourbon Fudge Brownie was outstanding!  Super rich dense chocolate flavor topped with ice cream and bacon bits.  Out of this world.   The desserts were by far the stars of our dining experience.  

The check arrived along with an ""autograph book"" of reviews.  Sign your name and share your comments of your favorite meal.  A nice inclusive touch to an exceptional and well presented meal.

Chicken skins as an appetizer was unique served with honey, and my thick chicken sandwich was pretty good.

Granted, I only ate here once during lunch...ordered the Pig & Fig, but I found the entire experience to be ""meh"".

1901925,2017-06-13,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Small plates - big taste!

As I understand it, this place is fairly new.  I had it recommended to me during my last Las Vegas trip by a transplant and a native to the area, so I figured it must be good.  It did not disappoint!

The restaurant is pretty small.  Although it wasn't super busy when I visited on a Thursday night in June, it was still pretty hopping.  Be prepared to wait.  Although they don't have an indoor waiting area, there is a courtyard area just outside the back of the restaurant with plenty of seating where you can wait comfortably --- that is, if you don't mind the heat.

They offer indoor seating at tables and bar areas and they also boast a deck upstairs above the restaurant, so you have plenty of choices for seating. 

The menu offers a variety of small plates.  They encourage you to order at least two per person in your party and share.  I was on my own, so there was no sharing going on.  I had a very difficult time narrowing down my choices.  Although the menu was on the smaller side - everything sounded good!  I eventually settled on the ""Green Eggs & Ham"" flatbread - pesto, smoked mozzarella, two sunny side up eggs and ham.  It was insanely delicious!  My waiter recommended breaking the yolks of the eggs with my fork and spreading them over the pizza, like a ""carbonara"".  Really, really delicious.  In an attempt to be lady-like and not come across as a total pig I ate half of my pizza at the restaurant, but wound up finishing it off back at my hotel later that evening.

My waiter was very attentive, friendly and made some great menu suggestions.  He was also knowledgeable of the beverages - explaining that the raspberry cider I chose to drink was best served over ice with some berries, if that was okay with me.  He also commented that the brand offered other amazing flavors, including a pear that was ""divine"" if I could find it for sale back where I was from.  

When the check came, it was presented to me in a hardcover book, which based on what was on the page I opened it up to was about brewing beer.  I thought that was a funky and interesting touch.  Although I didn't leave my mark on the book, I noticed on earlier pages many others had signed their names or left little doodles.  

While the restaurant itself doesn't have any parking, there is street parking nearby and the Fremont Street Experience parking garage is just a block away.  Speaking of which, the Fremont Street Experience is just around the corner from the restaurant.  This is a great restaurant to hit before or after you do the touristy thing on Fremont.  

Near perfect experience --- I'd probably bump this to a five star restaurant experience if the menu had a tad more variety and if they offered an indoor waiting area and restaurant parking.  

The food though?  Man... that's as good as it gets!  Check it out!",F5FjOYlaVqHMpo0Caoz6MA,1,0,4,QTqFs-6oDJjMoM7rw5o01g

Legit food, solid drinks and chill kick back atmosphere. Tucked away  in DTLV near other new little hot spots around the Fremont area is this awesome little Resturant. Driving by you would know much of it but step inside and you will find yourself in a hip cool Resturant. 

It's not that big but not that small either with a great bar and a cool little kitchen counter type thingy. Prior to coming here I've been doing my homework and had a list of items that I wanted to try but bringing that that would be almost their entire menu I had to pick and choose. 

So here is what I went with 
Their signature Bacon Jam- 3/5 good great concept but it wasn't my favorite or I won't rub tho back for it. You must try at least once for yourself to judge if you are crazy about it or not. 
The deviled eggs-5/5 some might say it's just like any other deviled eggs and I might agree but the texture of the egg was perfect and I love the fact that they classed it up with the caviar and the pancetta added the right amount of crispy fatty goodness I loved it. 
The truffles mac and cheese- freaking 10/5 no really it was so cheesy with the right amount of truffle flavor you can't go wrong. It's more like crack and cheese instead of mac and cheese! 
Finally we has the Butter Burger w/spicy tots-5/5 it was so freaking good. Burger was so juicy and had amazing flavor topped with all kinds of cheese and veggies. The bun was delicious and toasty and the spicy tots were crispy and season so good that plate also was on point.

For the {Libation} ""because no good love story or any story begins with someone ordering a salad"" we ordered the Magarian drink which had a bunch of stuff in it but it had me at cucumber soda and gin...the most refreshing drink ever with a great flavor of lemon, honey syrup and a hint if thyme who wouldn't want to just drink that all day in the hot summer heat then we got the St. Stephane's Belgian Blonde beer. All beer are in bottles nothing on tap but who cares when they are all so good. 

All in all I can't wait to come back and try everything else like their chicken skins and their beef Wellington empanadas plus sip on their other Findlay crafted drinks.",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,1,1,5,URWgeTc9nuuYCli-SEmgmw

1986057,2017-02-15,2,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"We decided to give Old Town Vegas a shot and check out all the renovations. I found Carson Kitchen on Yelp for dinner. The food sounded promising and it wasn't a too fancy restaurant.

There was plenty of street parking around. The restaurant was a bit hard to find in the dark. A homeless man actually helped us find the door. Not to worry too much, I think the area is relatively safe, just kind of unpopular. The inside of Carson Kitchen would tell you otherwise. It is packed in there and if you arrive during peak times you could be faced with a wait.

We agreed to sit in the bar area which turned out to be a bad idea. Minutes after, another couple arrived and they were seated immediately at a table that just became available. We hadn't even been seated yet. The bar table we were given was extremely uncomfortable and was under a light fixture that had a dead lightbulb. It was so dark that we couldn't read the menu without shining our cell phone lights on it. This shaky beginning was enough to make it just a three star experience but our waiter was so cool and the food turned out pretty good, I'm giving it a four. There is great potential at Carson Kitchen. BTW, we ended up moving over to under a light fixture that was working. Hooray we would be able to see our food and each other's faces. The couple next to us? Not so much.

Depending on how hungry you are, it can work out in your favor. The dishes are meant to be shared and there are entrees that are a bit more substantial. For dinner we ordered the staples and a sandwich.

Crispy Chicken Skins with smoked honey
Bacon Jam with baked brie and baguette
Veal Meatballs with sherry foie gras cream
Wild Boar Sloppy Joe

The crispy chicken skins and bacon jam are what dreams are made of. Forget the fat and cholesterol content. These appetizers were amazing. The veal meatballs and sloppy joe just added bulk. Honestly, I could actually do without those and just pick more snack type foods but it was dinner and we tried to make it a well rounded meal. I'd come back again if I were in the area. I'd just be sure to request a proper table next time.",-x1516ZG5GllZiBjDQlRkA,7,3,4,UQvaitdAX1OBuaCwyzd9Rw

Some of the party left and tables became open but hostess refused to seat us any sooner or accommodate us while we were waiting. We finally left and went next door for a donut. O face donuts is awesome next door!  Vegas is all about customer service and there was none at Carson Kitchen.  We will not be returning.,_zWasrUbxAb_CPB522jWoA,2,0,1,_TL2bq1FK9Ga81i9xbxg7Q
1988098,2015-02-18,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I have never been to this part of Las Vegas, so Carson Kitchen was definitely a hidden gem to me. From beginning to end, the dining experience was amazing. Our server was great, their mixed drinks were great (at one point I ordered Jameson on the rocks and I was given the option to add an extra 1.5oz for an extra $3, not sure what other drinks that goes for, but I'm sure the server will inform you if it is an option), last but not least the food was amazing!! 

I would highly recommend the following: 
- Gyro Tacos which comes with lamb meat, but it probably will not be everyone's cup of tea for those who like to steer away from meat that tastes too gamey.
- Veal Meatballs is topped with Foie Gras cream, need I say more? 
- Bacon Jam & Brie - The bacon jam comes sizzling hot with a melted slab of brie cheese on top, served with toasted bread. 
- Fried Chicken Skin with Honey Dip - each piece is crisp to perfection, my friend had one order all to herself. 
- Butter Burger with a side of Tater Tots - flavor packed between two soft buns. 
 
Other things that were ordered that is worth trying: 
- Smashed Potatoes - It's not mashed pototoes, it a baked potato sliced into 2-3 pieces with sour cream and chives on top.
- Tempura Green Beans - A great appetizer to munch on.
- NY Strip Steak - we ordered medium rare and the outcome was exactly like so, and very tender.

Also it was called a butter burger yet I tasted no butter on it. My fiancée got the red snapper entree and when it came out it looked like a appetizer as it was a very small portion. Not what we expected. We also did the chicken skin appetizer! The concept was ideal although they seemed to be over Cooked and or burnt.,Iey99Ab11Lblh_9WV-fTMA,3,2,2,ridCFS5YltpIMd804rhr5w

I thought that the beef inside was a little bit bland but that was remedied with the sauce that they pour on it.  I also got the short-rib sliders, which were decent, but the tater tots were very yummy.  

The only drawback seems to be the super awkward seating arrangement inside, but one could say it is good because you can stir up more conversations by accidentally bumping into people and chairs.

1994787,2014-12-17,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"BEST craft cocktails EVER.

Seriously. Lots of people design creative craft cocktails, but then other people make them and they're way off balance. Or something else is wrong. We had six, and all were in the range of stellar to magnificent.

5++++ stars for those amazing cocktails. Great variety too. Some more boozy, some less, great variety of spirits and house-made elixirs.

Great service.

Food? Left a lot to be desired for me but my partner was more easily pleased.

We shared mac n cheese (my personal favorite and one of the better macs around), broccoli crunch, and roasted cauliflower. The cauliflower was a garlic cop-out. Like young people who don't understand flavor and cook only with garlic and salt. Only in this case it's garlic and lemon. Not interesting, not creative. The broccoli crunch had raisins (not on menu list) and lacked pepitas (on menu list). If it's going to flip from what's advertised they should tell you.

Surprise raisins are just not cool. Partner liked both of those dishes, but I'm the chef in the family, and I found them lacking. I think he liked the mac less because of the pasta but I thought the pasta was excellent--smaller elbows that didn't taste like boiled bread like some of the larger pastas can. Had a nice tang.

Overall this place warrants a visit, especially from those who eat meat. The heavy-on-meat menu had a lot of creative options. They really should add a vegetarian sandwich/slider option to the all-meat sandwich list. 

My other complaint was being seated by a rear door that apparently leads to a patio (unused because freeeeeezing) and the offices, but employees constantly went out to the ""office"" for apparently no good reason and froze us out every single time they opened the door (about 30 times in 3 hours).",NMGpx_BYBwx9Z7SyI3Wd4A,1,0,4,4JZUUXgKzFgLAnu7g7unww

Bacon jam: I always get this when I come here. It's a must! Other than bacon and Brie, I'm not sure what else is in it but it taste like a bit of heaven to me. Comes with several slices of toasted baguette so you can slather on that heavenly goodness.

Gyro tacos: topped with feta cheese and diced tomatoes. Wasn't a huge fan of this one. It just tasted kind of blah. 

Grilled cheese short rib: perfectly cooked. Short rib was tender and tasted excellent with the cheese. Bread had a nice crunch to it without being too hard. Comes with a side of spicy tator tots. These tots are seriously the most delicious tots I've ever had. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I'm in love with them. 

NY Strip steak: cooked medium rare. Highly recommend getting this! It was juicy and the spices gave it amazing flavor.

2029014,2015-06-18,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Wonderful experience! So glad we returned and tried it again!

After my first review, the manager messaged me wanting to know more details about my visit and invited me to return and try it again. So right away, great customer service. And I really appreciate that.

We returned on a Saturday night and got to sit in front of the open kitchen. Dinner with a show! As food lovers, it was a real treat to watch the workings of the kitchen.

Our server, Dakota, was wonderful! He was very friendly and attentive. I asked him for recommendations and we ordered those. He was definitely not wrong!

We started off with the crispy chicken skins and tempura green beans. The chicken skins were definitely not something I would normally ever order. But they were seriously delicious! The seasoning and flavor was so tasty. And the smoked honey to dip them in went perfectly. And the portion was pretty big too. The green beans weren't exactly flavorful (but hey, they're green beans). But they were nice and long and perfectly coated and fried. And the pepper jelly cream cheese dipping stuff was seriously delicious and added a really nice flavor with subtle spiciness. And again, a pretty large portion.

For the next course, we went with the cocoa espresso NY strip and mac 'n' cheese. Yum, yum, yum! We were seriously impressed. We weren't sure between medium rare and medium, so our server put it in as medium rare plus.  Who knew that was even possible? It came out perfectly cooked - absolutely perfect. Fantastic crust on the outside and just right on the inside. The flavor was phenomenal! The red wine sauce on top went fabulously with it. It was seriously one of the better steaks we've had in town - and that's saying a lot. We're literally still talking about it. Get the NY strip! The mac 'n' cheese was also a real treat. It reminded me a bit of the mac 'n' cheese at Simon (also a Kerry Simon establishment), which I also loved. It was an excellent mix of cheeses, blended and melted very nicely. It had a good sharpness and tanginess. And just the right amount of crustiness. Loved it! And it was the perfect accompaniment to the steak. And both were pretty sizable portions too.

At this point, we were totally stuffed. So much food goodness! But how can you skip dessert? We got the special for the night - banoffee and the donut bread pudding. Both were quite tasty. James O. absolutely loved the banoffee. I particularly liked the biscotti and whipped cream. Very flavorful. The donut bread pudding was a great twist. The rum caramel sauce was a particular favorite aspect of mine.

Oh, and there were cocktails. Tasty and well-made cocktails. Again, going with server recommendations was definitely the way to go. I ordered some I normally probably wouldn't and was pleasantly surprised and pleased.

It was definitely really busy (duh, Saturday night) and the staff seemed to never stop for a second. But despite being so busy, we had wonderful service. And sitting in front of the kitchen made it all the better. We left completely stuffed and very pleased with our dining experience. Do we possibly have a new favorite downtown restaurant? Yes, we do. No doubt we will be back again (and again and again).",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,5,6,5,UHlzSkXaJq2ll7ARx9QRYA
2029031,2014-10-31,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Always on the lookout for a great meal the fiancé and I just had to check out Carson kitchen. Everything was pretty much right on point. We started with the bacon jam and the deviled eggs. Both dishes were excellent. The bacon jam would be amazing every morning on a breakfast sandwich with a good runny egg. The deviled eggs were a great contrast to the in your face bacon and smokiness of the jam. Very suttle  on the flavoring but in a nice way. 
    We also had the rabbit ragu, delicious. The use of spaghetti squash instead of pasta was very appreciated. It just really makes the dish work and you don't go into a carb coma after polishing the bowl clean. At the same time we throughly enjoyed the veal meatballs with peas. An excellent interpretation of a classic veal and peas dish.  Finally to end our fabulous meal the amazing chicken skins arrived. They were everything I thought they would be and more. I mean who doesn't like delicious crunchy, salty, spicy animal skin. The honey balanced the great flavor of the skins and made me want to get a basket to go. 
Forgot to mention the drinks. They were good not the best I've had but solid. We came for the food though so that's what matters. The beer selection was decent. A nice mix of craft brews. The specialty cocktails all sounded great but the 2 we had were just unbalanced. Not taking any stars off because they were still good and second fiddle to the food. 
All in all a great meal and well worth the trip. The location, people and vibe reminded me of home and the neighborhood I live in. I will always have to make a pilgrimage to Carson kitchen whenever I'm in Vegas.",IZ2qk7P-btO2v39fH_dsFg,2,1,5,Cb7gt3mQACugMl2dtH9W7A
2029917,2018-01-27,3,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"My sister and I have been trying to coordinate a double date with our dudes for some time. With one person working graveyard, another waking at the crack of dawn for work, and yet another working swing with varied days off, this took some calendar finagling. When we finally managed a date and time, Carson Kitchen was chosen for the January outing. 

I preface all this because, in choosing Carson Kitchen, I will admit two things that actually came out of my mouth when reviewing the menu. These statements have been saved to the ""Regina's Douchebag Quote of the Day"" archives:

1. ""Man, I hate paying for deviled eggs"".

2. ""Um. Chicken skins are not new, people."" 

Okay, on the chicken skins, I used to buy them by the pound when I lived in CA. They came with garlic vinegar. They were amazing. I used to peel fried chicken skins off of pieces of chicken and eat them for myself. My resistance to them on this menu comes from a place of ""oh, NOW they're cool?"". I know. I know. Still a douche...  

Anyway, I still think that I was overdue for a visit here, having heard rave reviews from practically anyone that's been. Having now been in for dinner myself, I agree this is a solid choice for a meal at a rather decent price point. At the end of the night with two rounds of drinks each and a shared dessert, we each paid about $50 with tax a tip. Really not bad for the thoughtful food and drink menus. 

I have some qualms though:

- Seating mostly sucks. I would pay an extra $10 per person for chairs with backs. I felt like I was Asian squatting throughout my meal. Where's my Filipinos at? You know how when you were little and your parents got those tiny plastic, bright colored chairs for you to use in the shower? Yeah, that's how it felt to me.

- Dining room is cramped. Along with squatting through the meal, I didn't really have anywhere to put my coat and my bag. I ended up covering my knees with my coat and having to finagle around it. 

- The deviled eggs were good, but I'm still mad that I paid for them. My husband reminded me that the caviar was a nice touch. 

- Dining room is loud. I don't think this is really a negative. It's just something to keep in mind. When I got home, my voice was hoarse from screaming through our conversations. 

With the qualms, come the notables:

- The fried chicken skins were delicious. The smoked honey was the real MVP. 

- The black rice oxtail risotto was exceptional. This was probably my favorite item of the night. The bite from the black rice, richness from the oxtail that was mixed into the dish, brightness from the gremolata, and the overall creaminess. DAMN. It was goooooood. 

- Great drinks. 

- The red snapper in panang curry was presented in a way we weren't expecting. We thought we'd see a whole or side of fish on a plate. The presentation in a bowl confused us; even partially disappointed if I remember correctly. This was all washed away by perfectly cooked fish and spicy, wonderfully delicious sauce. 

- The donut bread pudding has us scraping the bowl despite previously all agreeing we were stuffed. I expected it to be overly sweet. Instead, it was caramelized and buttery, but surprisingly clean. Well done. 

Downtown is a bit of a trek for me so I don't know how often I'll frequent this, but a great evening was had by all.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,7,2,4,wQWojzc9-BgmU0tDsJ2_Tw

A cool place to go to with friends since they have social plates that you can share as well as regular entrees for individual orders. I really liked the seating upstairs since it's brighter and more open than the seating inside.

Crispy chicken skins: 5/5 stars. So simple yet so good! It comes with smoked honey on the side for dipping. I wish my group (5 people) had ordered 2 cuz we devoured the dish super quickly. 

Bacon jam: 4/5 stars. I'm usually not a fan of jam so I didn't know what to expect from this dish. But surprisingly, the jam was superr flavorful and tasty. They just need to serve the dish with more cheese on top of the jam as well as bread! 

Summer squash: 4/5 stars. I'm glad this dish came out right after the bacon jam because we were able to finish the bacon jam with it. This is a very light flatbread that comes out perfectly toasted for that nice crunch. Nothing too special but good nonetheless. 

Cocoa-espresso NY strip: 3/5 stars. Don't think this is worth $19. We ordered this medium rare but it tasted more like medium. It was still good but would definitely have been more popular amongst my group if it had been cooked the way we asked. Sauce was decent but nothing that wow'ed us.

Butter burger: 5/5 stars. A very simple burger but the meat was so tender and that butter...you can taste it sooo well. I enjoyed the spicy tator tots as well. It had some powder on it that wasn't really spicy but added a nice kick of flavor to the tots. This was probably my favorite dish!

Overall, good experience. My only complaint was that we were told our table would be ready in 10 minutes so we waited outside in the patio area. We ended up waiting for around 30 minutes if not more. I understand that this restaurant is very popular so we knew we would have to wait but still...false hope :( at least this gave us time to choose what we wanted and then order as soon as we sat down lol",Rhlbsy95KOu26BvL4U8Ftw,1,1,4,DaTgaxC5oEo5qJ1QygQ7Vw

It had a great menu of interesting and flavorful new American foods so it was a lot more exciting than eating at your regular old vegas buffet. We came in around 7pm and the wait was 30 minutes and they offered to put us up in the shared patio to wait but since it's just a block off of Fremont st and Container Park, it was a nice opportunity to walk around. We came back with time to spare so checked out the patio and it was okay. Glad we got a seat inside because it was 100 degrees. We ordered the crispy chicken skin and rainbow cauliflower to start, turkey burger and trout for our entrees, and the banoffee pie for dessert. The things I would recommend were the caulliflower, turkey burger (it comes with tater tots that are pretty good), and banoffee pie (it comes in a little jar). The chicken skin was a little overdone, though it was a nice crunch to add to the fish. The fish portion was just too small, though well cooked. I really like the turkey burger, which was well-seasoned, and the banoffee had so much delicious graham cracker crust it was the best thing we ate there. The waitress was okay. She was the type of waitress that would say a dish was her favorite thing in the world simply because you pointed it out. Then we saw her say something similar about another dish to a nearby customer. She made the mistake of giving us one glass of water and saying that there were no clean water glasses, which didn't make any sense since we could see several behind the bar.

Very casual ambiance with family style seating.  The music is loud enough to be fun, but not so loud that you can't have a discussion.

The waiters understand their menue, and know about pairing with wine/beer to make the taste all the better.  I personally love the sharing menu/tapas style of dining this place offers, less stuffy and enables you to have a good connection with your party.  

The food is awesome: the deviled eggs are a MUST have!!!  The Seabass is great, so is the steak.

2074019,2014-07-15,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Never have I ever thought of an establishment like this would actually exist at the former John E. Carson Hotel in DTLV!!  Came in on a busy Saturday night with at least 30-minute wait for a table of two.  Luckily, we were able to snag two seats at the bar upstairs which certainly has a better atmosphere than the crammed dining area downstairs.  The rooftop patio has this relaxed and hip ambiance: bistro lighting hanging throughout, awesome music playing in the background and plenty of seating especially for a fairly large group.

Cocktails are rather great in this place.  Forgot his name but the Irish bartender made our experience that much better.  He explained what goes in each libation and even provided few unexpected treats throughout the night.  Out of all the drinks I had, I liked Towns End (Slow & Low Whiskey, Fernet Vittone, Amaro del sole, Regan's Orange Bitters No. 6, Angostura bitters) the most as I usually tend to go for dark liquors.  Asked for a Sazerac next since I was already going towards that route, but unfortunately, no Pernod at this joint!  The bartender, however, decided to make me a drink somewhat suggestive of what the Magarian (Aviation Gin, thyme & honey syrup, fresh lemon, Mr. Q. Cumber Soda) would taste like.  Surprisingly, I didn't mind the transition from dark to light as the smokiness greatly complimented the Crispy Chicken Skin and its smoked honey dipping sauce.  Right when you know I've had enough liquor for the night, I was faced with Brewer's Fix (Hophead Vodka, apricot preserves, fresh lemon, simple syrup, Prosecco) which was amazing due to the fact that a.) it's on the house and b.) I like India Pale Ales.  

As far as their dishes, there are plenty of interesting items to choose from.  For this visit, we opted for their shared plates.  If you were only to get one thing from the menu, make sure it's the Crispy Chicken Skins.  Something about a chicharron-like chip dipped in smoked honey sauce is just sublime!  Another favorite was the Veal Meatballs smothered in sherry foie gras cream sauce.  Yes, sherry foie gras cream sauce... it's truly as good as it sounds!!  Also decided to get the ""Devil's Eggs"" (topped with crispy pancetta and caviar) and Roasted Young Beets (pistachio, orange and goats cheese).  Still have plenty of room?!  End your meal with the Glazed Doughnut Bread Pudding (three rum caramel and vanilla creme anglaise).  It ain't no sticky toffee but it's a great alternative.

Overall, Carson Kitchen definitely lives up to all the buzz!!  Delicious food, impressive concoctions,  great ambiance and superb customer service.  Can't wait to go back!",6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg,3,2,5,QTpRPmA8mi0f7Bt13stw6w

Crispy chicken skins served with smoked honey sauce- Seriously, who doesn't love chicken skin?? These babies are deep fried and fattening as hell, but oh so yummy. I didnt particularly care for the side-o-honey it came with though. The portion was definitely enough for 2 or more people to share. 

Tempura green beans with pepper jelly cream cheese- These were super yummy. I thought the beans could have taken a little longer of a tempura bath cause they weren't that crispy, but this is not a deal breaker. I really liked these and would order again.

Bacon jam- Hellloooo gorgeous. Bacon, brie, and served to your table bubbling what's not to love? To be honest I found the jam to be a little too sweet, and only had a little bit of this but I can see how this is a popular dish. 

""Devil's"" Eggs- Deviled eggs with panchetta and caviar- So good. There were 4 to each order and I wish we had ordered at least 10 because they were so yummy. 

My dining companion ordered the secret Sunday chicken sandwich for her hubs to go, and she said it was really good. I decided to get one to go for my man. Luckily for me, he didnt end up eating it so I had it for dinner. The sandwich was pretty good. The chicken was tender and juicy even after I had reheated it in the microwave and the bun was soft. It comes with sauce on the sammy, but since I was getting it togo  I got a side of it which was spicy pickle aioli. It tasted just like a spicy pickle!! The sandwich also came with spicy tots which were yummy and even better dipped in the aioli.

I am already planning my next meal here. They are open late, and at nights you can sit upstairs on the patio which is awesome for prime people watching. I totally recommend this place and I can't wait to come back.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,8,6,5,kLSNn9a9SZ_Rg2bcQMPHeg

I am so happy to see Downtown's restaurant businesses alive and thriving. Took an out of town friend here about a month ago and we had an amazing lunch together . Carson Kitchen is next door to the what-used-to-be, O face doughnuts . We started off with cocktails then went ahead and ordered the following:

Bacon Jam with Brie &Crostini 
Black Rice Oxtail Risotto 
Edamame 
Glazed Doughnut Bread Pudding 


Bacon Jam with Brie- was everything and more. Sweet, fatty, creamy, the Brie cheese complemented the bacon very well. I would come back just for this alone. 5/5

Black Rice Oxtail Risotto- the oxtail wasn't very pronounced in this dish, it was bland. Appealing to the eye but bland . 3/5 

Edamame- citrusy, spicy and salty. It was good but not a wow factor for me . 3/5

Glazed doughnut Bread Pudding- when I think back on my experience here, I think of this beautiful and delicious dessert. The bread pudding was made from the glazed doughnuts at O-face. Sweet, creamy, and glazed doughnut deliciousness . 5/5

We also had the tempura green beans, which were really good with the jelly.

I opted for the osso buco, which was nothing special and it was really small. Everyone else had the filet and I think they won out.

The restaurant itself is beautiful. I love the rustic industrial style they have going on. Definitely feels like a hipster spot, but I brought my husband and kids and didn't feel too terribly out of place. Service was very friendly. I ordered the chicken skins. This item is what brought me here in the first place. The spicy honey sauce was great, I just felt like the skins were a little overcooked. 3 stars. I also ordered the *Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto* which was fabulous. 5 stars. The black rice had an interesting texture and the oxtail was tender and rich. I would return for this dish, for sure. I'd also return for the dessert. The *Glazed Donut Bread Pudding* was SO good. 5 stars, again. My husband's chicken sandwich was ok. Not bad but not great. 3 stars. Not quite worth the price of admission. The BBQ Burnt Ends were just that. Burnt and dry. I thought it was a clever idea, but it just didn't hit the mark for me. 2 stars. Considering the price of the bill and how satisfied I was with everything, I would probably lean toward 3 stars but I'm hoping that I maybe I caught them on an off day or maybe there are other items on the menu that are fantastic.",7AKWPQLa4QxKOVE_FBRtUA,0,0,3,werTkU4Nbq8FKJOud_Fc9w

2206221,2014-11-05,4,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"The Skinny: okay - nothing special. Food was bland or very unbalanced(2), service: food came out quickly, only 2 servers in the whole joint made service slow(2), value: overpriced for so-so food and service(2 stars overall).

With the plethora of tapas joints out there, we were interested in trying out Kerry Simon's joint for some comfort/farm to table food.

Of note, they only had 2 servers manning the restaurant. Albeit the restaurant is small, they are able to squeeze quite a few customers on the bar stools (there are about 4 table seats in the restaurant with largely communal/bar seating). Given the number of customers/servers, this poor ratio resulted in slower than expected service.

We ordered the Broccoli Crunch ($8), the Wellington Empanadas ($10), Veal Meatballs in a Foie Gras Sherry Cream ($12) and the Sprouts and Spuds Hash($10). As per our server, she suggested about 2 dishes/person. Serving sizes are typical of a tapas type style restaurant - small.

The broccoli crunch was very bland. Slightly par-boiled to get the rawness out, the broccoli was dressed in a rather runny tasteless version of green goddess dressing. Even the addition of pumpkin/sunflower seeds could not save this dish. Sadly, this was the best dish of the night.

The Wellington Empanadas were again desperately underseasoned. The beef was tough and overcooked. The mushrooms were flavorless. The pastry itself was okay but that alone could not save this dish.

Veal meatballs were okay - nothing special. I would say there was a bit too much breadcrumb in the meatball itself. The selling point was the foie gras sherry cream which disappointed - did not taste the foie gras in the dish at all.

The Sprouts (Brussel) and Spuds (Potato) was overpowered by the rather large dose of balsamic vinegar to the dish. It was so strong that I started coughing due to the potency of the vinegar. It wasn't pleasant and I would definitely not recommend this dish.

After the lackluster dishes we were served, we skipped dessert here and went somewhere else. The level of the cuisine does not match the prices that they charge here.

Given the disappointing array of dishes and slow service makes this place a 2 starred joint.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,7,3,2,W-qCTK37a1ko_IYE4CqRsg

my first visit here was so spectacular that i told everyone i know about it.
not only was i impressed with the food but also with the service, and the ambiance of the restaurant itself.
it's the type of place that absolutely belongs downtown as it makes you feel as though you're not in vegas anymore.
sure, some may call it hipster, but i personally think it's one of those places that's taking vegas in the right direction.

we need better food culture here and carson kitchen is taking those strides with their amazing offerings.
they take something as simple as a fried green tomato sandwich, and kick it up a notch by adding some lump crab ravigote and baby greens, all between a nicely toasted yet soft torta-style bread.  
absolutely delicious.
the roasted cauliflower, another simple dish with the spices and seasonings they use and the proper cooking method, was some of the best i've ever had.
from the perfectly fried chicken skins served with local honey to the o-face donut bread pudding, their menu is all comfort foods with a little twist, something that has kept me coming back for more.

with a smallish menu, i thought i'd be able to sample just about everything by now but with dishes that are just too good to pass up, i end up ordering the same thing every time.
it is my new goal in life to try everything on their menu at least once so, sorry fried green tomato sandwich, as much as it pains me, i'm going to have to pass on you for now.

so the next time you're in the downtown fremont area, stop by carson kitchen and give it a try.
i guarantee you won't regret it.

p.s. my only complaint is that they don't stay open late enough on the weekends.  11pm is too early to close.  we usually want to stop in after a show at the smith center but there's not enough time!  midnight on the weekends would be awesome!!!  =D",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,6,7,4,SS_F7d3TrR5QQCH4QPR7uw

Space is at a premium in their close-packed space, so expect communal seating to be a more likely fate than a private table.

The dish portions and pricing seem to indicate they're more the ""we're not here to engorge you, we're here to delight you with good tasting food"" kind of place. 

We ordered the ""Devil's"" Eggs, Roasted Young Beets, Rabbit Ragu and Duck Confit Flatbread. The ""Devil's"" Eggs were ridiculously delicious. The Roasted Young Beets with goat cheese and orange slices was interesting and good. The Rabbit Ragu wasn't so great. Although alright, I couldn't taste any rabbit flavor over the spiciness of the sauce. And the duck in the Duck Confit Flatbread was tasty.

The service is top-notch, but also a bit pandering with their, ""You've made some excellent choices."" I'd like to think that if I ordered ANYTHING from their menu it would be an excellent choice. But I really appreciated the effort.

2276966,2015-03-29,3,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Talk about the thriving downtown culinary scene. It rare that go downtown mostly cause going anywhere near casino on my days off flat out avoid. I work in the casino industry. I must applaud the effort cause downtown its come long long way!!! Especially Fremont street with the experience but more with all bars at one end and then all these small restaurant. To be clear Carson Kitchen not located on Fremont but Carson Street is literally minutes off it. Like anything downtown parking not the most ideal situation but have all the hotels that can park at or street parking. Carson Kitchen the best idea is the Fremont Experience parking garage literally right there or Downtown Grand just accross the street. 

I was pretty psyched about checking out Carson Kitchen for the first time. The best part was my cousin visiting with her family from the 808. She an avid yelper so I knew it was ONNN came first timers. It was for all of us. Talk about the BENEFITS of party of six or more. The only time take reservation if you have party of six or more. I went with my brother family my two nieces, my cousin her family niece and nephew, and then there me. So talk about spread of food. We pretty much ordered every appetizer on the menu. Literally had the Bacon Jam, Devils Eggs, Crispy Chicken Skins, Gyro Tacos, Meatballs, Scallops, some kind of popcorn shrimp, and Thai BBQ Pizza.  

Bacon Jam was my favorite appetizer! The bacon jam talk about divine spread that was not only fabulous on the grilled believe baguette sliced bread. The charcoal mark the crispy bread then nice spread of not only bacon (the nice part you could see pieces of bacon rather then I all grounded or cooked out puree), caramelized onions, and nice sweetness like any jam. Devine. Definitely you can taste the hint of bacon grease in the jam also! It perfect for the kids. Or on this night my nieces and nephews was enjoying the bread by itself. 

The Crispy Chicken Skin was the second winnah for me. It tastes like fried pork grinds chips you see in bags. I know not PORK but the texture similar and something that think of if never had crispy chicken skin. I loved it by itself. They have almost like sweet and sour dipping sauce that comes with it. I like the whole tiny fry basket for presentation. Truthfully came to presentation you can clearly see the Kerry Simon style. High end food. They incorporate unique severing dishes. The devil eggs presented on wine bottle cut in half. 

The other appetizers it had no WoW factor in any of them. The Devils Eggs like any other Devils Egg. It looks great but only thing that makes it stand out is the caviar on top. It such small amount nothing rave about. The Gyro that was pretty solid. I think you get only two per order but since we had big party ordered two orders. So had four on one plate. The grilled dough they use as shells are nice crispy and hot. The filling very generous, the lamb real tasty cooking spot on, the tzatziki, cucumber, and tomato. All together makes for hearty taco! Just warning so much stuff that it drips with every bite!!! The Meatball by itself was ordinary but the sherry foie gras cream sauce now that was amazing. I could see that sauce on pasta dish would die for. The two together for me just never worked. The Scallops was seared to perfection just between the sauce and the starch nothing exciting. So much going on forgot the components where just blah. The pizza was ok but so many other good things pizza last thing need to try at Carson. My opinion. 

I ordered the Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto. I really enjoyed. It not very often you see Black Rice on any menu. The combination of Oxtail Risotto sounded too good not to pass up. It had interest contrast with different texture rices. Oxtail made it nice and hearty. I think my brother had perfect analogy almost like hearty jook. The rice is not going be al dente since two different types. No doubt perfect dish on cold Vegas day and pretty filling dish. My cousins dishes looked pretty good. I had no room after all the apps tried more food. 

The service was spot on fabulous. The whole staff on on it from the minute we sat down. I found great is when you get the bill they give you book. I know right like ""What the Hell??"". Guess you can sign it if you want. All the kids signed it. I thought that was cool. 

The interior is very modern with community tables and upstairs outdoor patio area. 

No doubt Carson Kitchen place highly recommend if looking for place eat downtown.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,5,5,4,LUKW4vzYqS9CVN_76Gj-jQ

We came in rather late, a little after 10 pm not realizing they actually close at 11pm. We got seated at the bar area, which was perfectly fine with us. We like sitting at the bar - and with an open kitchen, it gives us an insight about how our food is being prepared. 
We ordered the Mac n Cheese, Bacon Jam and the Beef Wellington Empanada. The Mac N Cheese was well made seasoned with truffle oil. The flavor of the truffle oil was distinctive. Also the macaroni pasta was done al dente, which is how it's supposed to be served all the time. I also liked the Beef Wellington Empanada, specially the crust - not too flaky, but also not too thick either. The beef was tender and was flavorful. I didn't care so much about the red wine sauce but there wasn't so much of it that it really didn't bother me. 
I wasn't too crazy about their bacon jam either. There was too much onion in it that you could hardly taste the bacon. They also seasoned it with a lot of apple cider (?) or some kind of vinegar. I could tell bec it was too tangy. There wasn't so much of a balance of the sweet, salty and savory flavor that I associate with bacon jam. It wasn't bad though, it just wasn't to my liking. 
The staff was very nice and even if it was a few minutes to closing, we didn't feel like we were being rushed. Our server was very attentive and friendly. I would definitely keep this on my list of places to revisit.",40uA-Z0AZVsnbWJ-lUVoqQ,0,0,4,xtFu73iwVR-oYhCd7JXgfg

We were seated right away which was a nice surprise, given that it was Memorial Day weekend. We sat at the bar and had the pleasure of having Felicia as our bartender. She served us some fantastic cocktails and recommend a few dishes for our meal: 

* Bacon Jam: tons of bacon, reduced in jam, and topped with Brie, served with toasted buttered baguettes. 4/5
*  Young Beets: a tasty beet salad with red/green grapes & goat cheese. Loved this 5/5
* Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip: reduced in a red wine sauce. We ordered medium rare but it was a little over cooked; the flavor was really good though. 3/5 
* Turkey Jerk Burger: A very unique burger... we were pleasantly surprised. It had a mango chutney slaw that took it to another level. 4/5
* Glazed Donut Bread Pudding: I'm usually not a fan of bread pudding but man, this was SO good. A must try. 5/5

We also ordered the Crispy Chicken Skins with the smoked honey sauce but weren't really a big fan of it. We found that the batter overwhelmed the chicken skin. But Felecia graciously took it back for us and we appreciated that very much; we opted for the Turkey Jerk Burger instead.

Honestly speaking, the food was good but the drinks were even better. We got two rounds of the Mezcal Negroni, a Towns End, and an herbaceous gin cocktail with lime that our bartender made, and it was on point. Just what I wanted.

2306568,2014-06-13,4,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I'm going to say this. I will come back in a couple of weeks to see how things are going. But first, let me praise the staff to the high heavens. Unlike a lot of new places downtown they don't assume you're going to just drink the koolaid. They were ernest in their desire to make sure we were comfortable and happy with our food. They seemed to have actually tasted most of the food and had good recommendations for us. Much like La Comida, I'd eat here again regardless of what I thought of the food because the staff made the experience worthwhile. Fyi, I don't care for the food at La Comida. 

The food. Well. We split oxtail risotto which, honestly, was so rich as to be offputting. I ate maybe four spoonfuls as did my lunch date. There was plenty left to take home but we passed. We also had the bacon jam with brie. It was actually delish, but again, a little went a long way. A very long way. Again, we passed on taking the extra home. The empanadas were filled with nice chunky meat that was tender though it could've been a tad juicier. The mushroom flatbread was a great appetizer and the pizza cook was lots of fun without being overly familiar.

Here's my issue and it's something you can actually see in the accompanying picture. The risotto and jam seemed to be swimming in something. It wasn't grease. Maybe some oil like truffle? The lake of whatever it was did not inspire one to want to deal with that in a to go box or when it inevitably congealed. Again, offputting is the only word I can find to describe my feelings about it. It really wasn't greasy or slimy, but it looks that way. Combined with the fact that everything (except the empanadas) was just way too rich means I won't be pushing this as a place to go. Not yet. 

I'm sure that Carson Kitchen will find it's feet very soon, and hope so. I like the vibe even if the decor looks like someone went to EAT and decided that's the new downtown Vegas hip eatery look. Seriously, it almost looks like a blatant rip off. They seemed to be working on an outside patio which in and of itself will get me back this summer. And, not to be petty, I give it points for being filled with adults, not a bunch of bearded wannabes. 

The pricing seemed a tad ambitious. For small plates you can go from a quick bite to a $50 lunch in no time. Not outrageous but probably not in my, ""let's run by for a nosh"", price range.

I look forward to sampling more of Carson Kitchen soon but I'm hoping they bring the ooze down a notch. Go check it out for yourself, it's worth a try. Good luck Carson Kitchen, welcome downtown!",wIaktmJWXbvRjzMmr_Q1Gg,7,3,3,zKfsTonxby1A-rfaAYx2MQ

Plenty of different seating options between bar seating, communal, high top tables and small family tables. Definitely great for groups of all different make-ups!

The way they aim to serve food is sharing style, with plates coming out as they are ready since the whole table will be nibbling on everything ordered. 

We shared the ""Devil's"" Eggs (topped with pancetta and caviar!) Pig & Fig flatbread (I only wish there was more goat cheese on top!), and Sunday Chicken Sandwich (biggest, juiciest chunk of chicken breast I ever did eat!). Beware that the sandwich will be the last thing served because it takes forever to cook!

2313427,2016-06-03,7,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"5 stars for great quality food, informative and energetic server, fast service, value, and location. 

This place was inconspicuously located a couple of blocks from the Freemont experience in downtown Vegas. This place is hip and they have 2 floors (inside and upstairs patio) so on a Wednesday night, we did not wait to be seated. Our server who was the bartender was super excited and energetic. She was helpful in letting us know her faves and customer favorites popular dishes. The food came out as it was made without regards to the order ( apps, main dish, sides, etc). They make and serve the food super fast! The price is fair per dish. 

Bacon jam $13: MUST HAVE on everything. Put it on the baguette, Mac and cheese, meats, drinks, desserts, I said EVERYTHING! So deliciously sweet and salty and rich!

Gyro taco $12: it comes with 3 tacos filled with lamb taco meat. Delish!

Devil's eggs: it came with 4 eggs with caviar and bacon on top. The bacon was such a great addition as it was super crispy with the perfect amount of salt. Another great dish. 

Lamb chop: great flavor and tender wrapped in Parmesan crust. It came with 2 chops. Definitely perfect for sharing. 

Cocoa espresso NY steak: wow! Marinated and tender to perfection! It's so flavorful that even though I was full to my eyeballs, I still managed to scarf this one down. 

Mac N cheese: the best I've ever had. The cheese was creamy and blended well with the Mac. Add the bacon jam to this dish. You won't regret it. 

Dessert: lame, we didn't get any. My belly was down to the floor so I had to skip. 

Enjoy!",qrn9HPQ9Au2nE5E9dGkzKg,12,10,5,n43mfHfZCVM6Z9paDkTPfw

Food: Ordered the Bacon Jam, Tempura Green Beans, Veal Meatballs, and the Bourbon Fudge Brownie. My son loved the tempura green beans. They were pretty delicious, especially the cream cheese it comes with. The veal meatballs were also very good. The bacon jam...unbelievable. I'll just leave it at that. Bourbon fudge brownie was a nice finish to a wonderful meal.

Service: Our waitress was very very attentive. Almost to the point were she seemed like she was rushing us...She still did an excellent job, however. My only problem with the service was actually at the very beginning of the meal. The hostess seemed visibly annoyed when I asked simply if they had a high chair for my son. which they did not.

Decor: The place is very stylish, with twisted metal and views of the street. The place was clean and orderly, although a bit small.",Ozmf732ox-TNhfKrjWBXpg,1,1,5,IiFTRYq7L9vKfRNp6AS9vw

Went out for lunch with my co-workers and got the Short Rib Grilled Cheese served with Spicy Tater Tots and the Green Beans for an appetizer. Keep in mind that your food does not come out at the same time, it comes as it is prepared or at least that's what they told us. In our case, our Green Beans ""appetizer"" didn't come out until we were almost done with our entrée. The Short Rib Grilled Cheese was probably one of the worst I had, the bread was burnt and over toasted and the short rib itself was dry and lacked flavor. The Tater Tots again were overdone, I mean it was more than extra crispy. Then comes the late ""appetizer"". It was nothing appetizing, came out full of grease and extra salty. I don't know if they were having an off day but for the price and quality of the food, I will not be back.",0k2UHwH241QP3f_QzvLmQw,2,1,2,45ddGdmnvomdCDZkWs4iEQ

Not too spicy but just the right amount of spice. We then ordered the buffalo chicken flat bread which we watched them make right in front of us since we sat at the bar. The chicken was soo good the flat bread was nice and crispy with a good crunch. My boyfriend ordered the Sunday Secret Chicken I think. It was a burger with a good hunk of crispy chicken. The spicy tater tots they serve with it was like amazing.

I was craving for some desert and ordered the Donut Bread Pudding, and my goodness was that heaven in your mouth. They get the donut from the donut place next door. PLEASE PLEASE get the donut bread pudding its soo good.

Before I get into the nitty gritty of this place I would like to say that the hostess was rude. My boyfriend and I only thought she was rude to us but finding out later that she was pretty much rude to everyone that had entered the restaurant. Just for future reference don't just toss menus on the table and walk away if customers don't know where their going and you continue to ignore and talk to your co-workers.

Alright now down to the menu! Let me just say that you HAVE to get the fried chicken crisps! They're so crunchy and especially dipped in honey!!! 
Next on the menu we got the bacon jam this was something that I thought was good but not amazing because the bacon jam has some spice to it and as you keep eating it feels as if the spice builds up! 
Gyro Tacos were so good this helped even out the two heavy appetizers that we first got so it's a good touch to your meal! 
Last but not least the Ox tail Risotto, the ox tail was tender and went so well with the risotto. But this was a bit too salty. If it was less salty this dish would've been perfect!

This part of Vegas looks like it belongs in San Francisco -- kind of a hipster feel to it. Be careful not to drive past the restaurant - it doesn't have a gigantic obvious sign, so you'll have to look out for Chef Kerry Simon's face on the window. I think we circled that block a couple of times until we finally saw it. 

The restaurant is small and cozy. We were lucky to be seated at a bar that was in open view of the kitchen - that was a nice surprise. Our server was so incredibly sweet and made the experience that much more memorable. The food was both creative and delicious. Here's what we ordered:

- Fried chicken skin
- Pasta carbonara topped with a fried egg yolk 
- Bacon jam
- Award winning turkey burger
- Bread pudding (made with vanilla glazed donuts from O-Face Donuts next door)

Everything was delicious, but we especially loved the fried chicken skin, bacon jam and bread pudding! That bread pudding. Wow. Definitely don't pass on this dessert even if it requires you unbuttoning your pants to allow yourself some breathing room. It's definitely worth it and a reason to go back. 

Only suggestion would be to the kitchen staff - if you're sous chef'ing it or prepping right in front of your guests, you might want to at least take a second to make eye contact and just drop a little 'hi, how are you?' We weren't so lucky - in fact, it looked like this staff member may have been having a horrible day, if we had to guess. Didn't know if it was policy to not interact with guests while working but it didn't seem to match up to the warm service given by everyone else at CK. 

A fabulous experience nonetheless and we will definitely be back! So glad we checked this place out.",JpwnCiInMQdqPz9XnTZsEA,0,0,4,3P9khy55joRDqdArl-tXnw

I thought it was a little tight inside with little elbow space between your dining companions. However, the food here is excellent.

As other Yelpers have mentioned, it is extremely difficult to find. It is a great place to visit off strip but just know it will be a bit of a hike if you don't have a car. In addition, be ready to pay for parking. Meters and street parking can be extremely hard to come by so you may need to pay for a spot in a lot. Good news about this though, if you choose to walk around Fremont after dinner you won't have to feed the meter.

The food - so delish! Be ready to split a lot of things with your family and/or friends. Sharing is definitely the best way to go when eating at Carson Kitchen. As unhealthy as they probably are, the crispy chicken skins are to die for - so delish! I also am a sucker for good green beans - they were definitely fabulous! In addition, I loved the scallops. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu - the only item we tried that we weren't huge fans of was the crab fondue - it just wasn't really our style. 

The bar service was what killed my group. The running joke was we had to order our next drink when our drink arrived as it took that long for us to get fresh ones. This could have just been a busy night or something; however it was disappointing to my group that they would have to wait a while for their next drink. 

Definitely would come back to this place - it seems like their menu changes up quite a bit so I would be extremely interested to see what they come up with next!",y_LdP8n1VcwEzoNLndbYxA,3,1,4,KFdQ9EF_CefIACEYEofM-Q

2370681,2016-03-23,9,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Carson Kitchen was quite the experience. 4 of us were in town for March Madness and we went to Yelp of course to help us find a place to eat. Carson Kitchen looked like it would hit the spot. Even with a picky eater on our hands. I was a bit curious about this place as we rounded a rural street corner. Nothing very cute about this street. But to our surprise there it was. A Cute little restaurant window with the glowing ambiance inside, welcoming us to come in. As we walked through the door it was very small. I was worried. They said ""A 40 minute wait."" As I thought to myself ""Where would we wait, and where are the other people waiting....?"" The hostess that seemed to read my mind said ""There is a Patio right outside this door and a roof top bar above us, you are more than welcome to grab a drink and a seat there if you would like."" Did she say ""roof-top bar?"" That alone made this place even more exciting. We walked upstairs where we found lots of seating (unfortunately all full,) a long bar and bar top, and a list of craft cocktails, wines, and beers. The Bartender was very helpful. 2 of our friends got some very interesting cocktails, one which included egg-whites. I stuck to a trusty Pinot Grigio that the bartender recommended. We went down to the seating area, founds a couple of cute chairs, sat, drank, and chit chatted. And before we knew it our names were being called. 

We sat at a cute little table next to the window looking out to the street. Our waitress explained that this was a family affair. Items are meant to be shared. So we did just that. We started off with the Bacon Jam with Toasted Baguettes (PRO TIP: Get the extra Baguettes for a dollar a head of time. You will need them) The Jam came out sizzling, sweet and tangy, gooey and so good. The Baguettes were not too crunchy, as to tear your mouth apart, and were warm. We also started with the Crispy Chicken Skin with a Smoked Honey dipping sauce. Skins were large, crispy, and also don't tear up your mouth. But the Smoked Honey.... I could put that sh*t on anything. I even kept the left over sauce, just in case. 

For the Entree's we got the Co-co Espresso New York Strip, cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  The Beef Belly Sliders, Juicy and tender. I had never had Beef Belly, only Pork, but this was just as delicious. It came with 3 sliders. It was plenty to share. Along with Spicy Sweet Potato Tatar Totes. Not really very spicy but very yummy. Our picky eater got the Gyro Tacos. She had them to herself but said she loved every bit. 

We then finished our meal with 2 desserts. The Bourbon Fudge Brownies with Brown Butter Bacon Ice Cream. I didn't eat too much of this, as it was very rich for my taste. The rest of the group found this to be very tasty but we all agreed we could not taste much bacon. And Lastly the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding with 3 Rum Carmel, Vanilla Ice Cream. This had the consistency of bread pudding with the exact taste of a glazed donut. It was so interesting. Not one bit of it was left. We almost licked the bowl. 

This restaurants was one of the highlights of our 3 day trip. We really enjoyed our experience. The staff was really great. You could see them all working their tail off. The interior was rustic, yet modern. Very small, but we all enjoyed that fact. You get more attention from the staff and the kitchen has time to get every detail right.

Not a full 5 stars for me because I thought their drink menu was more extensive than their food menu.

The menu is designed for sharing and that we did.. I'm not a fan of chicken skin, or animal skin of any kind but I took a little nibble just to say I tried it; flavors were great, almost bacon-like.  Mac and cheese was my absolute favorite, rich and delicious.

With a dual outdoor patios, one upstairs and down, it really rounds out the extension of the restaurant.

THE CONS:
No on the Mac & Cheese. Ouch...major lactose tummy ache after eating that. 

No on the meatballs (IKEA meatballs taste better)

No on the Bacon Jam (too spicy) and the bacon was too hard. Not melt in your mouth bacon but rather the kind you have to spit out because it's over cooked. 

Restaurant is located towards the area of town I consider a bit seedy. Meter parking only, which can be a pain.

Staff here is stoic (no warmth or friendliness here). 

Summary: I'm glad we finally tried the place so I could see what all the hoopla was about...but would I go back? Nah. $70 for a half good / half blah lunch doesn't seem to be a good value.

2462802,2018-04-13,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Carson Kitchen was the location we chose for a day date when Grandma decided to watch the little guy and allow for some adult time. 

I guess I didn't realize that this was like a secret place. After driving down 6th St. looking for some signage we decided to just park it and walk. Thankfully the dude at the Doughnut Bar told us it was right next door. No signs, nada. 

You walk into a modern design restaurant with a separate bar area from the main dining room. Not a big place at all, very intimate. You can see the kitchen, and all the action taking place which I love. We weren't greeted all that warmly and had a short wait then were shown our seats. We sat at a community table, which isn't my preferred dining style. Fortunately we had a corner which allowed a little more privacy. The couple that sat next to us disliked the seating options even less than we did. With limited space, it's necessary in a restaurant like this. 

Our server was nice, but didn't offer up a ton of suggestions after we told her it was our first time here. So winging it we decided to order the veal meatballs and the bacon jam to kick things off. 

Our apps were solid. The veal meatballs had a little gaminess to them and the cream sauce was really tasty with a hint of heat. The bacon jam was a solid app, definitely got more than we expected. It could have used some more brie though. You get plenty of bread to dip, the jam itself was really good, sweet & savory. It's served in a cast iron skillet which is a great touch.

For our entree we decided to share the Short Rib grilled cheese. It was good, but didn't blow my mind. Short rib was tender, Gouda was a good combo, but it just didn't knock my socks off which I was expecting. I'd probably try something else next time.

The dessert we ordered was outstanding. We went with the Bourbon Fudge Brownie which is a brownie (no nuts!!) that has a fudge layer on top, gooey brownie underneath and is served with the most amazing butter bacon ice cream to compliment this concoction. It just works. It works so well. Definitely the highlight of the meal for me. 

We left Carson Kitchen stuffed and happy. Definitely will give it another go down the road when Grandma decides to offer up another opportunity for a day date.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,2,1,4,7woqY9EMqAwlfZu-ziPvRQ

2478205,2015-12-31,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Charmed by this oasis of down-to-Earth, inspired, stylish food that would do any Pacific Northwest foodie town proud. We stumbled upon this place (rather, this entire cool block) after going to Pawn Star's Gold and Silver Pawn. Hungry for a food experience not involving jousting, velvet chairs, or a reservation next August, we turned to Yelp for recommendations. Carson's was at the top of the list and, as per usual, Yelp delivered.

Carson's is basically too cool and real for Las Vegas. It's well off the Strip and in a part of town I've heard called ""seedy."" For some reason, I was expecting an area reminiscent of Detroit, but, as all artistic types know, ""seedy"" can be, and often is, synonymous with ""artist area."" 

ATMOSPHERE
We parked across the street (it was so easy) and were greeted from the outside by bistro lights draped over a Summe-ry deck, appropriate typography, and a view of some cool interior lamps and community seating... Very promising! Once inside, we were promptly and warmly acknowledged and seated at the long table in front of the open kitchen area. The decor was restrained and laid back (as only these types of hipster-y restaurants can be), but still conventionally ""nice"" and upscale enough to be considered a fancy date night type of place. There was an actual fire place outside at which people could smoke and gather... I bet that kicks ass in the summer! 

SERVICE
Was also quite impressed by the fast, fun service. The chefs and servers were all pretty quirky and friendly and we enjoyed their hospitality as they explained the dishes and even their own histories with us. 

FOOD
I ordered the lovely beets which were freshly cut and naked except for drizzles of honey, nutty cheese, and fresh tangerine. So delicate, earthy and good!

We also ordered the Rainbow Cauliflower, which was just baked enough. The florets had a subtle toasted flavor without being burnt, and were tender but firm and cut up into just the right sizes. Believe you me, in my experience, it's truly difficult NOT to burn those florets (or have them come out of the oven like a limp, soggy noodle), but this place pulled the dish off perfectly.

I have to also give an additional shoutout to the Terducken Pot Pie. It's basically deconstructed pot pie and is incredibly original in its deconstruction, reconstruction. The ""topping"" of the pot pie is in fact biscuit crumbles that are lightly toasted and very flavorful. The Terducken part speaks for itself in terms of flavor and juiciness and is seriously off the hook.

I wish my stomach was bigger because I would have ordered so many more dishes if I could have!! Alas! I'll have to come back here sometime to try the flat bread... If it's anything like the rest of the food, service and atmosphere, we'll be in luck.",2izTRCBL5Iq19E5Ededtug,1,1,5,dEtXw3YvkNqfyn4S0bc7-A

My husband and I came here for dinner while on a business trip. We called ahead to see if we needed reservations and we were told to just walk-in. So we walk-in and put our names on the waiting list. After 25 mins we were called and told our table was ready. Totally normal wait until we had to wait 40 more minutes as our table was ""being prepped"". We were really excited to try this place and by the time we were seated we were over it. We just wanted a good meal. 

Once we were seated our experience was wonderful! The servers were so friendly and my husband LOVED his NY Strip. I got the fish filet sandwich with tots and it had a lot of flavor (and salt).

If you just want dinner, this place is a 3. Great food but poor wait. If you're coming with friends, having some drinks, the wait is no big deal and this place is a total 5.

This joint is hip, trendy, and just a short walk from Fremont street. Go there.",IWmItwtBjykpr1VN-4EhBA,0,0,5,OmBs2DB0EuzxJWeFDHaCJw

We went to the upstairs bar and ordered ""cashme ousside"" (double rye whiskey, bitters, eggwhites, ancho Reyes and fresh lemon). It was refreshing, and light. We were seated around 9:30pm. Service was quick, after ordering we waited maybe 15-20 min for our food. We ordered the butter burger, gyro tacos, and the bacon jam.

Friends were in town on the strip so I finally had an excuse to come here and so glad we did. We spent at least 2 hours here and started out with 3 of their best apps:

Fried Chicken Skins (something my mom makes all the time) - they serve this with honey but I prefer hot sauce so asked for sriracha sauce

Tempura Green Beans

BBQ Burnt Ends 

I ended up ordering the Fried Chicken Sandwich (Secret Sunday Chicken) and immediately regretted it since the apps were so good and filling already.

Came at an off hour - about 2pm and no line, no wait and barely anyone in the restaurant. Wasn't too hungry so we ordered just the bacon jam and brie and the steak. It was just enough for a light mean or snack. Both were excellent! I really recommend the bacon jam and brie. It has a nice touch of sweet/salty with a hint of spice in it. The brie is actually a very small piece, majority of the dish is the bacon jam. We ran out of bread and they gave us a bit more.

Wish I could've tried more but it was enough to at least say I got to eat here!

I see a lot of people posting pictures of their swear jar here. I noticed dollars and cents in it so I asked the server if there are different amounts based on what swear word they say. He said the jar is actually for customers to tip the kitchen staff. So if your food was so awesome and you swear when you eat it, you put some money in there. Cleaver idea though as a customer, I don't think I would know that's what it's for (maybe there's a sign, but I wasn't sitting near it).

Although the address says 6th street, I believe the entrance door is actually on Carson street. It's just down and around from the Fremont Experience.

Atmosphere is cool, love the vibe in here. HIgh and low tables available but very limited seating. I would say maybe holds 40?",9qCby5Od3V6D8f4wssYiVw,0,0,5,DzApD_QcXGq8VZDoUUUMGg

Gyro Tacos - I order this at least one out of every 3/4 trips. 
BBQ Burnt Ends- love the ranch and house pickles that come with them.

They change the menu 3-4 times a year.  Usually I like the fish menu item, and will likely try. A new sandwich on the new menus. 

Service is great.  It's always busy so plan to wait.  But the wait is worth it.  Have never been disappointed with anything we've ordered from there.

First service:  the guys and gals working the front of the restaurant were cheerful and seemed to be happy working at this establishment.  The food was the best I had during my celebration this includes eating at Hugo's Cellar (very good), Three Gorges Grill (good), Park on the Fremont (mediocre).

The bartenders were very sweet, cute and kind!!  Very helpful with the menu and giving us great detail about each item.

We also tried the Shrimp Dunderi, Gnocchi made from Ricotta cheese instead of potatoes, it was also very tasty and the Shrimp were huge but you get two...keep that in mind if you are splitting.   

All in all I thought it was just 'ok' nothing to brag about or write home about, it was pretty pricy in my opinion but I may not have felt that way if I really, really thought the food was to die for.

- the place was PACKED
- the place was also smallish
But, we were told to go check out the bar, and we'd have a table ""in a bit"".  So we ordered some drinks and chatted - turns out ""in a bit"" was about 10 minutes - so not bad for a group of seven.

We got to our table (quite rustic), and checked out the menu.  Here's where it got REALLY interesting really fast.  When you order something...anything - it's served family style.  Steak, potatoes, calamari, whatever...it gets sliced up and put on the table for all to enjoy.  Definitely a bit different, but it meant we could explore - and explore we did.

I think the winner overall was the chicken sandwich - fresh and moist white meat fried chicken in a pretty amazing bun with something akin to a secret sauce that was a perfect match. The spicy tots that came with it were also great, maybe the best tots I have had in a LOOOOOONG time. The cauliflower was good, but some pieces were cold in the middle, not really a game changer because at least they weren't mushy but a little, I don't know, weird?

Our waitress was super friendly & helpful as well. She informed us ahead of time that food comes out as it's ready (not all at once) & dishes are intended to be shared. My kind of dining! Our food came to us at a steady pace. 

We also asked our waitress for recommendations & she did not steer us wrong! 

She suggested the Baked Mac & Cheese. Sounds like a pretty basic dish & I was reluctant but I'm sure glad we got it! It was soooo good. Not sure what kind of magical cheese they use, but it was delicious & it had truffle oil, which makes any simple food decadent. Great spin on a classic. And the baked bread crumbs sprinkled on top added a nice balance of crunch to the creamy gooey goodness. 

The Roasted Young Beets with pistachios, orange, & goat cheese was an amazing combination of flavors. Very light & refreshing. 

The Steelhead Trout with almond relish & creamed kale was also fantastic. The skin was crisp to perfection & the flesh was moist. No clue how they do that. I can't recall eating a more perfectly cooked fish.

I beg to differ, I can't see Glutton, nor Eat nor any other of the fine restaurants we like to frequent would say this is common practice. The irony of it all is, my wife suggested Glutton but I choose to go to Carson and pay $28 for their butter burger. Never again! My wife also wrote a review and received basically the same response from owner Cory Harwell ( it is what it is ) note, there are over 100 other negative reviews on this restaurant. I guess the days of customer service have been lost here.",7bPytYoK2-xmp2WDKk-DfQ,1,0,1,I_3W8gvrFs7juOlr2KPzLw

2628290,2015-09-17,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"We tried this on a recommendation.  It's not quite in the heart of the bustling Fremont crowd, which surprised me, but later, I was quite thankful for that.  You're close enough to walk to the Fremont craziness but about 1-2 blocks away, enough to make an easier arrival/escape.

We were escorted to a cute little courtyard waiting area, which was cool.  It looked like there were tables downstairs and upstairs (outdoor area upstairs?) although I never saw stairs inside.  The downstairs is all I saw.  It was small but had an energy about it.

1) Bacon Jam (baked brie w/ toasted baguette) = 5/5 (sweet and salty and spicy and sour all at the same time, very complex flavors made this very unique
2) Tempura Green Beans (pepper jelly cream cheese) = 5/5 (so glad my co-diner ordered this, the red pepper cream cheese was so tasty)
3) Baked Mac & Cheese = 4.5/5 (pretty darn good, solid mac n cheese)
4) Butter Burger = 5/5 (such a good burger, moist, unique flavors, seasoned well, melty cheese, yummy sauce)

I will say we each ordered a burger (which he told us was a full meal w/ spicy tots - also very good) and shared the bacon jam, tempura beans, and mac n cheese.  This was WAY too much food for four people!!  We loved our three shared items so much and think we should order 1 cheeseburger as a shared item as well instead of a whole burger for each of us.

Very high recommendation for this place.",AQxmbuDiToMv2WYtq4Mfdw,3,2,5,d7_ba5_S5pBSy5Qs5YhmAQ

2629502,2015-10-24,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Its been a few months since I visited Vegas but I still remember one particular place that we ate, Carson Kitchen in the Downtown Fremont Street area. The restaurant is one of many that are owned by the late Celebrity Chef Kerry Simon and it is one of the select few great meals that I have had at a well known chefs place in Vegas.  Carson kitchen is hidden away on Carson and 6th street and was so hidden that our cab driver actually had a hard time finding it and dropped us off almost two blocks away. After a few minutes walking around a rather sketchy part of town we finally noticed the name painted on a window and knew we had found the right place.  Once inside you will find a small dining area with nothing but family style seating. You will have two options...snuggle up and make some friends or go someplace else. I would suggest make some friends because you do not want to miss any of the food that is about to be placed in front of you. Everything on the menu sounds mouth watering good so it was hard to decided on just a few choices. My wife and I decided to go with three sharing plate choices and then a dessert. We started off with Bacon Jam and Grilled Baguettes, then Fried Tempura Green Beans, Fried Chicken Skins and then finished it all off with Doughnut Bread Pudding. The small size of the sharing plates did not matter as the huge flavors more then filled us up.  Like many before me, the highlight of the meal was the sweet and luxurious Bacon Jam. I was smart and ordered extra baguette bread so that none of it would go to waste. The jam was insanely smokey and sweet but with a slight kick of heat that hit the tongue right at the end. There were hunks of bacon and onion laced throughout it and it was capped off with creamy Brie Cheese. Unbelievably decadent and good. Nothing after that could really compare to the bacon jam but it was all very good.  The Chicken Skins were airy and crispy with a flavor and look reminiscent of pork rinds, they were served with sweet honey for dipping. The Tempura Battered Green Beans were crispy and not at all greasy and were served with a mildly spiced red pepper jelly. I would be lying if I said I didn't dip them both in my Bacon Jam.  Dessert can best be described as sex on a plate. Doughnut Bread Pudding that was made with a fresh Honey Glazed doughnut from the bakery right next door. The sinful donuts are baked in an egg custard and then topped with a sweet spiked Bourbon and Honey sauce. The waitress actually threatened to steal the dessert leftovers from us (and judging by the look in her eye she was not kidding) so we were obliged to finish the entire plate of happiness. This was such an amazing meal that I have no choice but to give it 5 stars. It is a fitting tribute to Kerry Simon and his culinary talents.",jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,0,0,5,E6bQbwtfyHTYwt-IHaJE8Q

Its behind the strip so you aren't overloaded with all of the mess there but just close enough to safely walk. It is definitely not for large groups as the seating is small tables for about 4 or so. 

The beer and wine list is a great selection. I had a glass of rose that was crisp and not too sweet. They have beer from the local brewery Big Dog as well which is a great touch. I will say the beer options are limited for non IPA lovers so be aware of that. We each had a couple of different appetizers to share and none of them were disappointing. Between all of we shared the chicken skin, bbq burnt ends, bacon jam, and pig & fig flatbread.

All of the food was flavorful and perfectly cooked. The chicken skin was addictive on its own but add the honey and its so many flavors in each bite. The burnt ends were flavorful and just sweet enough with the sauce being the stand out part. Now the best for me was the pig and fig flatbread. The pork belly was perfectly cooked and paired great with the goat cheese. It was salty sweet and just a bit tart. Get this when you go here. 

Also on top of all of this the staff was amazing. We showed up with a large party not knowing the layout of the restaurant and had to wait a while. With all of the confusion and miscommunication the staff was A+ with service and made sure to make up for any of the confusion on our part.",XpfS2pcAgOIz6Jlyv9nIcg,2,0,5,itlpLEKSfhbPfLV1agED2w

Another yelper commented on how the restaurant and ambiance reminded them of being in San Francisco and I agree. I definitely didn't feel like I was in Vegas anymore. I loved the restaurant's quaint and modern design but I especially enjoyed the charming ambiance on their roof top dining area, the booths were very comfortable and there was just the right amount of lighting too. 
 
Now, let's get to the good stuff: the food! 
 
The crispy chicken skins arrived with a side of smoked honey for dipping = insane! Honey Boo Boo, this thing is real good! The skins were seasoned expertly and fried to crazy, crispy perfection; I couldn't get enough of that airy, crunchy skin - it wasn't even oily. Don't even get me started on the smoked honey -delectable- you can bet your sweet life they were meant to be eaten together. It's a must-order and for $6, the portion was perfect for two.
 
We also went all in on the bacon jam with baked brie and grilled baguette at $12, It's the most popular item on the menu and now I know why. It came out bubbling hot and was incredibly bacon-y, jam-y, brie-y, salty, sweet and, yes, it was pretty darn magical.
 
To offset the naughtiness that is crispy chicken skins and bacon jam, we also ordered roasted young beets with pistachio, mandarin orange slices and goat cheese at $8. The beets were roasted till perfect tenderness, naturally sweet, and the dish was simple but very tasty. It was the perfect option to complement the richness of the bacon jam.
 
We also grabbed an order of the black rice and oxtail risotto with Parmesan cream for $14, though, we thought it was way too cheesy (if that's even a problem?) Based on the menu description, we were expecting more of a smoother Parmesan cream-like consistency, but we ended up with more of a dense, stringy texture. Our waitress was wonderful and could tell that we weren't too thrilled with the consistency when she checked on us, so she generously offered to replace the dish with something else that we would be able to enjoy. We decided on the rabbit ragu with spaghetti squash and Parmesan at $12 - everything on this dish was seasoned very well; I also really enjoyed the light tomato cream sauce and the perfectly cooked spaghetti squash. Surprisingly, the overall dish wasn't too heavy. I personally wouldn't order it again, (rabbit is just not my thing) but my boyfriend went to town on it and really enjoyed it. 
 
I'm completely satisfied with the level of service and care that we were offered here. They went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with everything we ordered, plus the simply tasty food is well worth a quick return! I can't wait to come back and order some more of those chicken skins all to myself!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,14,9,5,3I9Znpju4QBBggGjPGkvMQ

The decor is very chic but simple. It sort of feels like you're dining in the chefs private residence with family/bar style seating and the open concept kitchen. The details in the decor are very cool and inviting. 

Now to the food - it was to die for! We had the mushroom flatbread which was so unique with arugula, feta and a butternut squash paste base. The flavors mixed so well on a crispy crust. Then the Mac and Cheese...so many places can screw it up by being just ""meh"" or bland, but this Mac was seriously legit. We finished it off with the bread pudding made from donuts - I would cut it with some salt or acidity, but it was still delish.

The meatball was nice and crispy on the outside and tender inside. The sauce should be made into toothpaste so you can savor the flavor!  The gyro tacos had the right amount of sauce and good portion of meat (3 bites) however the flour tortilla shell was grossly empty and too large. (Ingredients in middle - nothing on outside). If I take a bite of just flour tortilla, someone messed up.  Overall good meal and lots of items to try and the service was incredibly friendly however the kitchen is always backed up and lunch should not take an hour to get tacos.

2659259,2015-09-14,6,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"This is a review that I admittedly feel bad writing, as it always tugs on my heartstrings a bit to see a place fall from grace. I have dined at Carson Kitchen a total of 6 times now and had I written my review after the first two times, I would have easily given them 5/5 stars, but now that I have dined there several more times since, I feel like there is a bit of complacency that has resulted in the restaurant going downhill a bit in both its food quality, variety, and service. 

Starting with the menu. Chef Kerry Simon developed the original menu and when they first opened, they discussed how the menu would change over time and that things would come and go for variety. I totally respect that and think it is refreshing. We ordered the Spam Croquettes on our first visit and unfortunately it was one of the first things to be removed and never come back. Other items we have tried over the times we have been there are the Bacon Jam, the Chicken Skins, the risotto, tacos, and many others. It seems like the fryer has been in overdrive lately as the fried items are simply too over fried. The bacon jam was heavily seasoned and though some grease is expected, it was taken to the extreme. 

We prefer to dine upstairs on the patio, and when it is available, we always request it. Nice view and a peaceful modern setting. The dining area downstairs is a bit cramped and a little too hipster modern for our tastes. The hostess is friendly enough but also seemed a bit agitated at times. 

Refills on drinks and water tend to be pretty slow and my biggest complaint: no refills on sodas and no draft beer as they do not have a soda fountain or taps. I really do not like restaurants that only serve canned or bottled sodas but I can deal with it when the food and service make up for it. Unfortunately, Carson Kitchen has fallen short recently. I am sincerely hoping that they will get their shit together and bring back the friendly hipster service and well prepared menu items that I recall them having when they grand opened.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,12,9,3,ibq_AoV0mBSa0CsAMEIFoQ

It's increasingly buzzing with foodie-friendly places like Carson Kitchen, which serves scrumptious fare that's reasonably priced given the quality and portions that you get.

I tried a fried chicken sandwich which turned out to be positively gigantic. It came with a yummy ""secret"" aioli and also came served with a nice helping of tater tots. It all washed down well with a couple of glasses of beer and cider - here, it's worth noting that they have quite the good boozy selection. There were many other tasty-looking items on the menu like jerk turkey burgers, beet salads, strip steaks, and flatbreads that I didn't get to try, but if you're stopping by, it'll be worth coming with a small group, getting a bunch of different things, and having everyone share or at least mooch a bite off each other's plates. 

The space itself feels a bit compact in the way people are spaced from each other, with the advantage to this being that things feel a bit more open and social than it would, say, at a Strip resort bar or restaurant where you'd have lots of space for your party to lounge and stretch out.

We were greeted and seated immediately seeing that it was senior citizen dinner time.  We sat at the bar and browsed there beer selection which was fantastic in my opinion. I like the craft beer choices and the prices were not too out of line.  The decor and style of the place is top notch.  Very well done and has a certain rustic elegance and modern feel to it. Very nicely done.  

We went with the chicken skins for an appetizer with honey to dip and I was not disappointed at all by the choice.  They tasted like a BBQ potato chip.  The skin were seasoned so well wanted to lick my fingers but I had to refrain and wipe them on my nice cloth napkin.   

For my main course I went with the Buffalo Chicken Flatbread.  I really like the blue cheese and buffalo sauce flavor combo of hot and creamy with almost a chopped chicken with slice carrots and celery.  I am not a fan of celery but this tasted like a buffalo chicken wing and had tons of flavor.  

My friend decided on the Turkey burger which he said was packed full of flavor also.  He said it had hints of apple and also seasoned well and was really juicy which is something you do not always find in a turkey burger. They tend to be dry and overcooked.  This he said was perfect with his side of tater tots.  The food came out quickly to the table.

The beer selection was very good.  Carson Kitchen has thought what would go best with there menu choices.  Almost like the have done the beverage and food pairing for you.  I enjoy the craft beer offering's of IPA's and Porters and such.  I am also surprised that PBR is making a comeback in certain hipster circles.

Toast - I don't know who ordered this but it was literally just 4 pieces of toasted bread, which tasted like toasted bread, so let's just ignore that dish.

Deviled Eggs - covered in bacon??  Yes, please!

Tater Tots - never fails.  Crispy, yummy, fried tots of joy.

Chilli Cheese Dog Flatbread - looked amazing when it came out but tasted like what it sounds like, and I'm not a fan of chili dogs so I'm biased.

Pork Belly Carbonara - BLEW MY MIND!  So good!  Definitely the best dish.  Came with a fried egg yolk, which was like a soft-boiled egg but no whites and covered in bread crumbs and Parmesan.

2696912,2014-08-19,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Tucked away in a little corner downtown on 6th and Carson (hence the name), chef Simon Kerry and his team offer unique twists on American classics. 

There's only a few tables and bar-top seating. It was only my wife and I, so they sat us at the bar...right in front of the kitchen. Very cool. We chatted it up with the chef and enjoyed the casual, friendly atmosphere.

Now onto the food:

Bacon Jam with Brie: I liked this dish, but didn't love it. It had a ""baked beans"" flavor to it and it was just hard to get over how cloyingly sweet it was. But as sweet as it was, it wasn't very...well...jammy. I expected to be able to spread it on the toast points it came with, but it wasn't really like that. It also had one tiny strip of Brie down the middle. It could've used a little more.

Veal meatballs: decadent, rich and spicy. This is stick-to-your-ribs food done well. The foie gras sauce was velvety and luxurious and the dish was seasoned perfectly. It just wasn't very balanced. Rich on top of rich on top of rich. It came garnished with English peas, so it'd been nice if they'd topped it off with a pea shoot salad with a sharp vinaigrette for some freshness. 

Gyro tacos: exactly like it sounds. But instead of slices of an emulsified slow roasted meat loaf, they used ground lamb. All the flavors were there. This was a solid dish and easily the lightest of the offerings we were served.

Crispy chicken skins with smoked honey: it may sound heavy and greasy, but if you come to this place, you can't leave without trying them. They are light and crisp, succulent and savory. Like the best part about fried chicken without the grease and the stomach ache. Easily the best thing we ordered.

Deviled eggs: you put caviar and pancetta on anything and I'll eat it. These were no exception. Simple. Elegant. Phenomenal.

Wild mushroom pizza: nothing out of the ordinary. The crust was nice and crispy and the mushrooms themselves had a hint if thyme which works so well. The bleu cheese felt a little overpowering.

Bread pudding: made from day old donuts from the shop next door, you'd think this would have been over the top sweet and rich. But it wasn't. Very light and airy. It had an almost savory quality to it probably due to the yeastyness of the donuts. Enjoyable.

I'd like to come back here during the cold months. The food was great overall, but a bit rich and slightly unbalanced. A solid effort.",HQlvsUqVhtJDH0ASBzaLsA,4,1,4,aPhFzaQLQLHDJ4KyBfkjZA

I love that this place is tucked away. It's like a local secret. I went here for a late lunch and was seated immediately. Being only a party of two I'd feel bad taking a large table top so I went for a seat at the bat. Tentative bar service and quick amazing food. We got three appetizers because I really wanted to try a few things off the menu since other local friends were strongly encouraging me to try Carson Kitchen. 

Let me start off by saying all the food looks just like the website photos. I love to eat with my eyes so I about fell out of my chair when I saw this delicious food coming toward me. First came the Bacon Jam. The guy that dropped it off suggested we get a piece of the Bree with every bite. It smelt a lot like BBQ sauce but as soon as touched my tongue, I was in love. Not to sweet at all, amazing flavor, and bacon. Nuff said. 

Next came the Welington Empanadas. Flakey pastry, amazing flavor, sauce was a little bland but I saw it as more decorative because all the flavor was inside the empanada. Only two per order and only a couple bites. Not a heavy appetizer. I would recommend! 

Finally, oh man, the Gyro Tacos. I seriously had to stop a staff that had nothing to do with our service and tell him how good they were. The tzatziki sauce didn't have too much dill in it like more authentic tzatziki WHICH IM TOTALLY OKAY WITH! Preferred in fact. Meat and cheese lay in little pitas that are easy to eat in a couple bites. I would recommend these for sure. Don't let the lamb scare you! Lamb is usually too tough for me unless shaved like in a typical gyro sandwich. The flavor is out of this word. I could seriously go on for days about those ""tacos.""

Downstairs feels like you are in a crowded kitchen, but you feel like you get to see all of the action, which is awesome. Upstairs is more relaxed, with a view of the city. I also loved the fireplaces outside in the courtyard.

Our cocktails were great. The Towns End was reminiscent of an old fashioned. We had a bunch of dishes and shared them all. The standouts were: Crispy Chicken Skins, Veal Meatballs, the steak, Broccoli Crunch, and the shrimp. The only thing we didn't like as much were the gyro tacos.

When I arrived on a weeknight for dinner with three other people there was a thirty minute wait.  They told us we can grab a drink at the bar or can go wait in their backdoor patio.  We decided to grab a drink at the bar to go to their patio area.  The girl behind the bar originally ignored us for the longest time.  She was just wiping down glasses while we wait for her to acknowledge us.  Finally when I made it obvious she finally took our drink orders.  It was annoying.  Annoying to the point where I almost ask everything to leave.  Once we got our drinks, we chilled at their spectacular patio with a bon fire going.  It was nice.

Once we were called and seated, we asked for their short rib grilled cheese and bacon jam but both were sold out.  Boooooooo.  We wish the waitress told us prior to us ordering what they were out of.  So we went with the following and its description:

Veal Meatballs ($12)- These tender and flavorful small meatballs were divine.  They came out in a bowl with some sauce and peas all over them.  They were really good and perfect if you love veal.  

Secret Sunday Chicken Burger ($13)- We got this as a replacement to the short rib grilled cheese sandwich which was out.  It was good but nothing crazy.  It was served with some fries.  

Baked Mac & Cheese ($12)- This was the best thing we had there.  It was so good that we got two orders between the four of us.  It had a truffle taste and was super cheesy.  We all loved it and recommend it. 

Braised Short Rib ($14)- This was suggested by our waitress since the bacon jam starter was out.  The short ribs were pretty magically, tender, and had lots of flavors.  It was a good starting dish.  It was served with two crust-less piece of white bread. 

Rainbow Cauliflower ($9)- This was our least favorite here but still a goodie.  The cauliflower had lots of lemon but I enjoyed it.  They were cooked perfectly.  

Galzed Donut Bread Pudding ($8)- OMG!  Now I know why the hype.  I don't know another place that has bread pudding as amazing as this place.  It was one bread pudding served in a bowl with the best sauce poured on top.  It was the perfect ending to our dinner. 

All dishes are about $10-$20.  It's kinda tapas style and everything is shareable.  The service in the dining area was excellent.  The service at the bar sucked.  The inside is smaller so there is normally a wait.  I love the romantic ambience.

I ordered the butter burger and it really surprised me, looks can be a little deceiving, the perfectly shaped patty makes you feel like these are just your run of the mill processed burger, but I was completely blown away after the first bite. It was so juicy and tender and delicious, the exact taste you're looking for when you're looking for a burger. We also had the jerk turkey burger which was also really amazing, it was a tad on the sweeter side with the mango coleslaw, but also a winner.",uvuJGkqfplvBYObNEb1sYg,0,0,4,C8Qg_qZFOblj3z8jn3b6Mg

My waitress was awesome and super friendly, and there was the most handsome boy I have ever seen was expediting, so until my friend showed up, I stared directly at his butt.
So far, this is a terribly written review.
Anyhoo-
My friend was late, so I ordered the beet salad. So delicious and perfectly balanced with the addition of goat cheese and orange.
All I could think of was the hot guys butt, NO I MEAN TEMPURA GREEN BEANS WITH PEPPER JELLY CREAM CHEESE DIPPING SAUCE. 
I would dip anything into that, it's so good.
Then I had the butter burger. I've been wanting to try one since I saw it on a tv food show about Wisconsin and I thought, I may be fat but I'm not flying to Wisconsin for a cheeseburger, even if coated with butter.
(I realize that I COULD have made one at home, but space travel has also been invented and I'm not doing that either.).
How was it you ask?
Do you have to ask? 
It was DELICIOUS.
DUH.
It comes with tater tots. I almost bypassed them because I did fill up on vegetables, but they were the best tater tots I've ever had. Soooooo crispy on the outside and fluffy potato-y goodness on the inside.

2819955,2015-05-16,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Did I say deep fried chicken skin?  Well hell yes I did!  I always wondered why someone never put that on a menu because people eat pork rinds so why not give our poultry friends some love?

We went in here for a quick snack and were drawn here by the chicken skin appetizer.  It was a Saturday at 2pm and the place was packed so I can only imagine the crowds at dinner.  The fried chicken skins ($8) did not disappoint; however, it might have been too much of a good thing because it was too rich to finish them all.  I recommend going with a big group and sharing this appetizer with a few friends. 

The menu was very impressive and the bacon jam looked like a winner. I watched other people get their burgers and they looked amazing as they came out....great presentation as well.   When I am back in Vegas I will definitely come back to try their other dishes. 

Carson Kitchen reminds me of the Milwaukee restaurant the Social when it was still open.  It is an open kitchen with a very innovative menu at affordable prices.  If you are staying downtown, take a few block walk to this great restaurant.  Also, I would check if they take reservations because this place will probably be packed at dinner.",akiIhaV0vVVfDwEozKZxEw,1,0,4,tbh6Ih-6VXIxP5j2wXLpmw

I ordered the Crispy Chicken Skins $9.00 with smoked honey, Killer Shrimp with rocoto pepper cream $11.00, Bacon Jam with baked brie, toasted baguette slices $12.00 and my son ordered Butter Burgerboursin, cheddar, lettuce, tomato with served with spicy tater tots $14.00.   The crispy chicken skins were okay to me but my son didn't like them.  The shrimp were breaded and lightly fried and then doused with this pepper cream, a little too spicy for me.  The bacon jam I didn't like but my son did.  I thought that the bacon jam was overpriced for what you got.  The one thing I did really like was the butter burger and then again the tater tots were a little on the too spicy side.  I also ordered a sangria which was average.  I think if you want to come here come here not hungry and order a drink and an appetizer and just enjoy the company and the ambiance.  It's a place where you come and bring a pre-date.  Plus the waiter was in a rush to get us out so someone else could sit down, I didn't care for that.  The round bowl dishes bothered me because when they brought food out in them the servers had their thumb in the bowl to hold it.

Very modern cute little restaurant. The decor is very hip and classy. I love it. I think they have seats outside and upstairs but were inside in the main area. We sat at a bar table with the kitchen right in front of us. I usually HATE watching my food being made but everything looked sanitary I didn't really mind. Everyone wore gloves when they prepared the food and washed Properly. 

For foods;
Cocoa-espresso NY steak-- delicious! Just the way I liked my steak made. Very tender, cooked medium rare but not deadly looking. The crust on the steak had a grill taste to it and the red wine demi gave it personality! one of the best steaks I ever had. It isn't a large portion though, I wish there was more meat to it! 

Baked Mac & cheese-- secret ingredient was definitely Truffle! I know that amazing taste. Very very cheesy! They did not cheap out on the cheese. I loved how it was baked so the top had a nice crust on it giving it some texture when you eat it. 

gyro tacos-- made with lamb but did not have that gamey taste that usually lamb has. There was a amazing yogurt sauce that gyros usually come with. It comes with 3 tacos and you wish it was 6! It is a nice size taco and not a miniature one. It really tasted like a taco even though it was lamb.

2863003,2015-02-18,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"OMG!!!!  Best food I've had since moving to CA 2.5 years ago. Let me explain- I moved from Austin Tx (which by the way has amazing New American restaurants, not just BBQ) to San Diego CA. I'm passing thru LV on the way to ski in Alta UT and need a lunch break. Yelped and came up with Carson Kitchen. Got there on a Wednesday  right as they opened at 11am. Good thing as they were full by 1145.  Amazing prompt service, super friendly staff.  Had the bacon jam ($12) smokey, sweet and with a spicy kick served with a little melted Brie and grilled baguette.  Saved some to try with other items.  Next came the Mac and cheese($12). Creamy perfection with a slight hint of truffle.  Great too with a tiny bit of bacon jam. Then the espresso NY strip($18). Perfectly cooked and so tender that I cut it with my butter knife. Again, even better with a tiny bit of bacon jam. Can you tell that the jam is amazing?  Everything is made to be shared, so two or three dishes were more than enough for lunch between the two of us. But then we couldn't pass up the Donut Bread pudding. ($8).  Oh wow!!! Crumbled Donuts mixed with butter and stuffed in a mason jar and baked until brown and yummy on the outside then served with a light buttery rum sauce and creme anglaise.  Perfect finish, though I am now stuffed.  
Very good wine list by glass or bottle ($7-10/glass) and great selection of microbrews by the bottle (most from CA-$5-10).  Nice little original cocktail list.  I tried a Standing 8 Count as I don't like sweet stuff.  It says it's made with tequila but it was so smooth that I didn't get a hint of tequila taste until the end. Barely sweet with hint of chocolate bitters, mint leaf and hint of lime.  Seats 48 people during day and at night when upstairs patio is open seats an additional 43. I'll be back on my way back from Utah. Lunch and dinner menu are identical and same prices. Lots of locals there at lunch.",sRa4TQsZuTJZAW5cEyB80w,0,0,5,-Q8RZXi4v7CrpRCaOLtmdA

There are two areas of tables and two wooden angled bars with seating, one fitted along the bar, and one that wraps around the open kitchen.

It's a two story building so we chose to sit up stairs on the patio. We first ordered our drinks which is usually an IPA beer. I got the bacon jam and OMG this was soooo amazing. I've never tried something like this and when you first get the dish it almost looks like burnt brownie in a skillet served with bread lol. So I scooped some bacon jam on a piece of bread and tried it. DELISH! 

We ordered other things as well like the tempura green beans I believe and those were good but I think the sauce along with the beans actually made that dish. If it wasn't for the sauce then it'll be just tempura beans.. 

Mac&cheese! Wow! Wow! Wow! It was DELISH as well.. The different types of cheese just makes your palate dance for joy! Lol..

In the end this place was on point and I'll be back again but if you only wanna order two things get the mac&cheese and the bacon jam, you won't be disappointed.",gnJDOrXo2cJ8xkRXU7GUWw,2,2,5,t62rVqH3PJ5qcaGI_9eMWw
2873282,2014-09-13,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Came here for a pre-show dinner.  As is common with Kerry Simon restaurants, very creative menu with well presented dishes.  Enjoyed the bacon jam, veal meatballs (a bit oversalted), and star of the menu was the gyro tacos.  Strong beer selection, but having options on tap is necessary as opposed to only bottled choices, particularly for a 'gastropub' type place like this.

Service was very friendly (we sat at the bar).  One service misstep that was a bit 'nickle and dime' (something very out of character for a Kerry Simon restaurant) is when we were approached and asked, unsolicitedly, if we want more baguette slices for our bacon jam (we said sure, as there was more bacon jam than bread).  The wait staff graciously brought this too us, and an undisclosed charge for this showed up on our bill. 

It is a pet peeve of mine when service staff offers something nominal like this (four small baguette slices), not solicited by the customer, and charges you - if they are going to do this - they should either disclose it as an upcharge, or not offer something nominal unless it gratuitous for their customers - they need to work on this type of item - I expect a bit more out of a place of this caliber on this type of thing.",Oixv0VgElz8pxQFp2lkdJg,0,0,3,RJDU_Jf3OMXLkdahjGp3TQ

2887703,2014-09-15,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"We came here for lunch after a recent hip Fremont district stay-cation.  Pretty much to kill 2 birds by trying it out and nursing a hangover.  It was pretty busy in there.  We got seated at the bar.  The bartender was a great server and had many good suggestions for our ""situation"".  The decor is completely minimal.  Bare structure is exposed, but in a good way.  Sometimes up dressing and decorating is not needed.  It is quite a tight spot but I believe they have an upper level now, which probably has a spectacular view.

I ordered the Tempura Green Beans.  The Pepper Jelly cream cheese was a nice whipped addition to the lightly crispy large green beans.  4/5 for green beans

I ordered the Wellington Empanadas for my girl.  She said the meat tasted somewhat like a stroganoff.  The sauce was very slight flavored.  I discontinued eating land meats so I cannot give you a rating on this, but, she said it was good.

I had the Broccoli Crunch for myself.  A very fresh and hearty salad.  It had sunflower and pumpkin seeds, grape tomatoes and preserved cranberries.  The green goddess sauce was underscored just enough to grease things up a bit.  The whole salad was executed greatly.  4/5

We shared the Roasted Young Beets.  This came out as the most impressive plate design.  It reminded me of a vegetarian ""Uni to Ukura"" (from Yonaka Modern Japanese)  The roasted beets were soft and mild.  Pair each mouthful with the crushed pistacios, orange slices, goat cheese and micro-greens in each bite.  The mixture is refined.  Nothing out shines the rest of the ingredients.  As a whole the flavors are a symphony that doesn't quite match the beauty of the plate itself.  Still a very notable flavor.  4/5

All of the entrees had a thoughtful execution and I would say the entire menu is meant for the discerning taste bud.  More for those who would prefer a Waldorf salad over Spicy-Nacho Doritos.  With that being said I would highly recommend Carson Kitchen.",ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ,2,3,4,QiNpsdPqPThkXuTzH2KR8w

Each time I have gone it gets better!  My first experience was by chance as I showing some out of town friends around downtown.   Glad we decided to stop in.  

The first thing we ordered was the bacon jam and it was amazing! Really smokey and good bacon flavor.  The whole thing reminded me of eating smoked ribs at a good barbecue place.   We then had the Mac and cheese and all the reviews where right. This is a must try.  When then finished up sharing the meatloaf sliders which were great. 

The service was also fast and friendly. One of the mangers came over to chat with us and talked about his favorite item.  Next thing we know he stopped by with a plate of the rainbow cauliflower for us to try.   It was really good. Had a good garlic flavor to them and was dressed very simply with oil and I think a bit of lemon. 

On my most recent visit they were pretty busy so we grabbed some cocktails and waited in the area outback. The area was very cool with a unique fire pit.  The drinks we ordered we also fantastic.  The I had the brewers fest and really enjoyed it.  It reminded me of a citrus type beer even though there was no beer in it.  I would definitely order it again.  Not to mention the bartender was great in answering all my questions and talking with us. 

The only thing I didn't care for in my times there was the deviled eggs.  They were pretty basic in nature and not on par with the other items I had tried.

What can you possibly say about a place that has had so many five star reviews, to make yours stand out?

I suspect every possible nice thing that could've ever been said about this place has already been said. But I'll give it a shot anyway.

For starters the staff is incredibly friendly. You have to remember that Las Vegas churns a place like this.  People come in with very high expectations, and if the place doesn't deliver they get torn to shreds in the press and on Yelp and are shut down in a matter of months.

Carson kitchen has stood up to this kind of expectation for a while, and they've kept on delivering.

As for my meal, I went with the veal meatballs, Gyro tacos, and the beat salad.  All were every bit as magnificent as others have said they would be.

I've been holding off on my review until after my fourth visit in order to keep the naysayers from claiming I am too much of a downtown fanboi.  Over the course of my four meals at Carson Kitchen I have been able to sample a very good portion of the menu and have had the pleasure of being served by different staff each time.

Highlights of the Menu:
Wellington empanada, two slightly crispy puffs of hot damn goodness stuffed with some well prepared steak.  Gyro tacos, just like your favorite Greek gyro, but better because you can pop them in your mouth.  Jerk turkey burger, this is one of my favorites and I am traditionally not a burger fan whether it be beef or turkey; the secret is the apple sauce in the recipe.  Short rib sliders; I've been soda free since '93 but damn you Simon (DAMN You!) you slipped in some root beer into the sauce and I love them!  Fried green tomato with lump crab; a big tomato filled with real crab meat, what's not to love?  Cocoa espresso NY strip steak; I had this during my last visit and paired it with their tots (everyone is doing tots these days), Carson Kitchen just happens to be doing it really well.  The steak was ordered medium, cooked to the exact temperature and tasted fantastic.  Rainbow cauliflower, who would have thought that it came in multiple colours...all three tasted good, and the same; who knows maybe they used food colouring.  Spicy sausage flat bread; wasn't all that spicy but was well received as an appetizer.  Dessert? Glazed doughnut bread pudding is amazing.  I hear they have other desserts but have not been able to forgo ordering the bread pudding each time.

Fancy cocktails:  I'm sure they have them, the bartender is constantly shaking something up; I've had a real man's drink each time, beer.

Service:  Excellent all four visits; from both the wait staff and the bar staff.  They know the menu well, they engage the patron at the appropriate times and leave you alone to enjoy your meal and company.  Perfect.

Minus 1 star:  Oh no he didn't!  The interior dining room is small and will get quite loud when busy.  Loud restaurants get on my nerves...being all old and crotchety these days.  Not enough private tables; the majority of the seating is shared tables with other guests and bar top space.  Being that the space is small I suppose they had to weigh out the negatives of seating in this arrangement but you get the feeling that most patrons do not enjoy this type of situation...maybe it's because I've been known to help myself to their plates if something looks appealing.

Secret space:  Not anymore; there is a decent sized roof top patio with more seating and another bar.  The space up there is actually about the same square footage as the lower portion.  There isn't much of a view since you're only about 12' up but at least you're outside and not looking at a parking lot.  Well done in this regard.

Carson Kitchen should be on your Downtown dining stamp card, if it's not, pencil it in. I wandered in here for a few bites before meeting up with some friends for a birthday party, sadly this was third time in Carson Kitchen, but my first time actually the eating food. 

I went with the Gyro Tacos, the Wild Mushroom Flatbread and, ""A Drink With The Ms."" to wash it all down. Carson Kitchen killed it on all fronts; the tacos were surprisingly light and very fresh, with the Mediterranean flavors really shining through and the Wild Mushroom Flatbread was a flavor bomb accented with a flaky crust that was to die for. These are both great options if you just plan on snacking at the bar before heading into Downtown Las Vegas. 

""A Drink With The Ms."", isn't a quote from a ""Mad Men"" episode, but a solid Whiskey cocktail with a very sweet finish. The sweetness comes from the maple syrup and ginger beer that's mixed with a hefty pour of whiskey. This cocktail was on the verge of being too sweet, but the salty food I was eating kept everything at the perfect balance.

The bacon jam tasted good but visually was not appealing due to its blackish color (and even a little gross because it was marinating in its fat).

The lamb in the gyros were dried out, so much so that even the yogurt sauce didn't cover up the dryness. The pita bread was moist and tasty though, and I have to wonder whether this would do better as a vegetarian dish.

The two dishes I really enjoyed were the Cuban (although did it really need to be pork belly?) and the mac and cheese. Both were flavorful and moist.

However, I can't in good conscious give more than 3 stars since this was only half the dishes, and I can't imagine the calories cost to achieve those flavors.  I can't ignore that the mac and cheese probably was a very fattening dish (so much so that one of my fellow diners could not finish the small dish). I can't ignore that the Cuban had 2 very thick slices of cheese on 2 buttered slices of toast. Just because I choose to eat out doesn't mean I want to eat a more than 1000 calorie meal. If I wanted that, I'd have gone to Heart Attack down the street.

Not that it surprises me that a Kerry Simon place would win me over. I mean, the staff has to wear rock & roll t-shirts. Would you expect anything less?
My first experience was on a busy Friday night, and we sat upstairs at the patio bar. My second trip, I came right at the start of business, and was lucky enough to get a seat at the open kitchen aka Chef's table. If you know me, you know that is my favorite place to sit. I love watching the kitchen staff interact. I love watching the food be made right before your eyes. Also, in this particular kitchen, I really love the passion of the staff. It was clear they wanted everything perfect before leaving that kitchen. 
So far I have indulged in: devil's eggs, corn succotash, baked mac and cheese, gyro tacos, watermelon salad, a butter burger, a sloppy joe, and some bread pudding. I would order every one of those items again. And let me point out, I never ordered the tacos to begin with. My daughter and I were dinging together one day, and they were sent out compliments of the Chef. Total score. We devoured them, and still ordered our entrees and appetizer. I plan on trying the chicken skins, bacon jam, and killer shrimp on my next visit.

First off, I went to this establishment but was unable to eat here. 
I've spoken with the owner since my original review and there was a misunderstanding over the phone. We were expecting a table when we got there. Had we understood that that it would be such a long wait (45 min), we would have opted for a different restaurant. 
I'm changing my review from 1 star to 2 because I did not have a good experience here as I was disappointed by the service / communication here as we waited in the restaurant. I've been to other restaurant that do those things better. Their phone service is very good. 
As per my previous review, I probably caught them on an off night. If I dine here again when I return to Vegas, I'll update my review. 
 
OLD REVIEW:
I was really excited to try this place out last Tuesday. I called them up to see if a table was available for a party of 3. I spoke with Matt who said one would be available in around 20 minutes. He put our name on the list and he advised us not to park in the lot across the street so we parked in the Container Park lot and paid $10 to do so. 

We made it to the restaurant 20 minutes later hungry and expecting a table. The girl at the front counter greeted us and informed us a table wasn't ready yet but would be soon as we were one of the next 2 in line. We understood and waited our turn.  

We kept checking back in but she kept giving us the same story. It was very cramped inside as we waited so we spent a little time outside waiting where there were wind gusts up to 50mph. 

After waiting 45 minutes, they gave our table to a larger party and she told us to continue to wait. I'm sure we caught them on an off night but the experience at the restaurant sucked and I cannot recommend them and don't think I'd ever come back, which is too bad because the food and atmosphere looked promising.",cRJ4DYPkWHMuMAj8JXnNdQ,1,0,2,ShdujkoojbQrMgRGeRjzJA

Place was freezing so the wait seemed to be longer than it probably was. a chef and maybe a manager were arguing with the bartender about her ringing an order up incorrectly , fine I get it but really in front of the guests? 
Sliders looked good, mac and cheese looked good. He grabbed a slider and one bite he was done. The braising in rootbeer is great, but there is NOTHING on the thing to counteract the sweetness. The tater tots were way way overcooked to the point there was no white in the middle. The mac and cheese while decent, was no where near ""life changing"" I spent years in DC if you want life changing mac and cheese go to Cafe Delux in DC. he had been excited to try the bourbon brownie.

 As we walked in we were greeted quickly by the hostess. Very nice, sleek, tiny restaurant with a cute small bar, open concept with views to the kitchen.

The food: small menu, small portions tapa style maybe? 
We got the...
Tempura Green Beans: good flavor not overly battered comes with a pepper cream cheese dip. This was good. 

Beef Wellington Empanadas: 2 in a order, not bad flaky crust comes with a sherry sauce? Idk but this was nice. 

Crispy Chicken Skins: comes with honey dipping sauce. Think of fried pork skins.. Super crispy, this would go excellent with a nice cold beer. Good flavor, a bit on the salty side. I feel like this didn't need the seasoning really. 

Caribbean Jerk Turkey Burger: eh I didn't like this. Maybe the fact that I don't really care for cole slaw, which by the way was the only thing in it. Burger became soggy. It had a pumpkin spice kinda flavor and it was kinda sweet ehh.. 
 
I liked when each item came to our table the server described what it came with. The food came out in good timing. We were there for probably just 45 mins. 
The service was good she checked on us a few times. This place would be great after a night of drinking and you want something good, and savory! But they close early in Vegas standards at 11pm.

Food comes piping hot as it is prepared so it's probably best for everyone in your party to approach your meal 'family style' if dining with a large group. 

Don't Miss: 
Veal Meatballs
Cauliflower
Beet Salad - Although portion size is ridiculously small for the price...sharing this dish is nearly impossible if you want more than one bite. 
Broccoli Salad
Tater Tots - Yes...they definitely came out of a freezer bag you could buy for $1, but just trust me on this one. 
Chicken Thighs 

Good:
Oxtail Risotto
Cocktails 
Doughnut Bread Pudding

Decent: 
Shortrib Sliders - They were fine, but nothing special

Skip: 
Mac & Cheese - Same old truffle oil with a bunch of cheese. Honestly nothing special and extremely heavy and greasy.

Overall really cool concept. Not sure if I'll be a 'regular' at this spot but would recommend it to friends. 

Dined upstairs on the patio as well as the main dining room. Wait for a table downstairs if you're dining in the summer unless you're looking to sweat to death during dinner. The Patio has no misters or anything for that matter to keep you cool.",nauNqUG6kLSW_hBnH0MxWg,2,2,4,lrpat2eTzZBBkcQb9FOuJA

The chicken skins were so good. If you like pork rinds, you will love the chicken skins. Not one bit of greasiness and the seasoning is so good. Not salty with a bit of spiciness.

I arrived at 5:45 and there was a 30 min wait for a table so we decided to have dinner at the bar. We were greeted by an Irish bartender with a large personality. I ordered the Mac & cheese, jerk turkey burger, and glazed donut bread pudding. The Mac & cheese was the best macaroni I have had in a very long time. The noodles were still al dente even though they were sitting in a creamy sauce and baked in the oven. Flavor was bold and I enjoyed the bread crumbs on the top, however they were only on half of the dish. When I tasted the burger all I could taste was the potent star anise spice. Burger had potential but the spice ratios need to be toned down. I barely touched the side of tater tots because they were too greasy.

3176889,2017-01-08,4,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"How portentous must you be to attend this place? I'll tell you. It's recommended to arrive in full hipster swag, sporting a beard with an extended mustache with curved tips a la Hercule Poirot. Only then do you have the luxury to purchase three tiny 'gyro tacos' the size of one regular street taco from pretty much any of the (pretty well reviewed) taco trucks I've been to. For eleven bucks! Want a diet coke to wash that down? I'm surprised they have such low class beverages at a hipster joint like this. But they do. But it comes in a tiny bottle that they up charge for, and it's not on the menu (secret menu for regular people drinks). 

When the hipster culture becomes a self-licking ice cream cone, you get hipsters opening portentous little restaurants, frequented by none other than? You guessed it, hipsters (and those who happen to do google searches for top rated restaurants in downtown, only to be fooled by self-licking reviews into coming to this overpriced joint) with a bar. 

The normal looking white collar guy sitting next to me had the same opinion of the portion size (tiny hipster size) and the taste of the 'bacon jam'  - both pretty awful (they charge thirteen bucks ! for a slice of baked brie in some jam, and dried baguettes, as though putting brie cheese into jam and cayenne pepper makes sense, or more sense than these items served separately. Hint: it doesn't). The white collar guy next to me rejected his dish after trying it, and I don't blame him.

Want even more portentousness? When the server brings you your minimalist dish, as though you were dining at a high cuisine restaurant, he explains the dish to you, perhaps to distract you from the tiny size of the food on the plate. Apparently the sea bass is citrus encrusted with the skin still on the side for some reason. The cost of citrus encrusted sea bass? Approximately a nine inch length of it (I'm very familiar with this size) will set you back eighteen smackers. 

If you wanna feel good about your social group, and you belong to this group, then by all means, luck the ice cream cone you helped scoop. If not, save your money and go to a normal restaurant where diet coke and beers are on tap.",aT_KNDSaMLQxxlKUbwbqZg,0,0,1,jSComIQVzGVRjwlzEDVgbQ

Tonight a friend of mine suggested we eat here, I've never been.  We arrive and spoke with the hostess.  She tells us for a table of 3 it'll be a 30 minute wait so we went and grabbed a drink at the bar.  As we drank we reviewed the menu.  I hadn't eaten all day and was starving so I've already pre selected several dishes I wanted to try myself.  I had about two appetizers 2 entries and few sides that I wanted to try, plus wine (which I was already having a glass of)  just on my own accord not counting my friend and the rest of our party.  After about 30 minutes or so, the hostess comes back and asks us when the rest of our party would arrive, we said in a few minutes they're running late.  She says ""if your party isn't here we cannot seat you, because we have a full house.""  Even though 1. That disclaimer was not mentioned during the initial waiting period, and 2. Our party was legitimately running late.  Mind you I suggested that since our party is running late.  I will order for 4 so we'd make it worth their time.  When clearly myself alone was already tentatively at over $150 dollar bill.  I understand turning tables quickly, I also understand milking a cash cow as is.  If Ive already suggested ordering for four which means we would've cleared a 200 dollar bill, and had my friend and I only had two in our party but ordered for 4 it's a win win.  They've gotten their money and we would've gotten our food, and as soon as the rest of my party arrived the bill would've doubled, because like myself my friends and I are food fanatics.  The hostess was completely unapologetic for her lack of the disclaimer which still annoys me.  Had she mentioned the fact that our entire party needed to be present obviously we would've coordinated better and had everybody present and not have wasted an entire 30-40 MINUTES, waiting for a BS excuse at the END of our wait time!  It was a bullshit move and I took my money somewhere else.

Slightly crowded but not too bad. They had seated two people in a bad location so it forced us to sit all on one side of a table. If they had sat the 2 people correctly or asked them to slide down we could have sat on the L and been able to talk. Less than ideal but we could handle it. Instead she made NO attempt to help us, and the 4 of us were like bums on a stoop. We couldn't talk to each other. It was embarrassing. They were more worried about the ""owner's table"".

Instead you were treated like a human being and you weren't even there. We were just shoved into a table and had menus thrown at us while they ran around waiting for you. How about teaching your staff to take care of the regulars? How about making some sort of effort?  

The real problem is that this isn't the upstart spot that needed locals to come down, they are always busy and now they don't care. It was very clear. Rex is never going back.

My partner LOVED the gyro tacos and the Parm Risoto, I loved the bacon jam and the watermelon salad. The service was excellent and the staff was super friendly. I would have given 5 stars... BUTTTTT- There appeared to be a cricket situation by the door/ brick oven. Fortunately, we were there late enough that it was not a problem to move me away from the bugs.

  - 10 stars for the Crickets. Bugs=YUCK

That said- the bus boy chased down my partner and I outside when he left his phone on the counter.

We came here for a team building for and had a great time.

Please know that this place has become popular over the years since it's opening and there may be a wait period of 10-15 minutes.

The good news is that since its recent remodel, if your solo or a couple, there are additional seating at the chef's bar or the adjacent bar to sit at.

My co-workers and I were seated promptly when a table opened up and our waitress was quick to come and get our drink order.

After drinks were ordered, we ordered our food and know that this menu is Ala Cart, so order your favorite sides to enjoy with your main meal.

Burgers and sandwiches come with crunchy and tender tator tots.

I ordered the short rib grilled toasted cheese sandwich with horseradish and sourdough- so delicious!

My favorite is the steak cooked to your preference (in this case rare) and it was phenomenal!

For starters, a staple would be the deviled eggs with smokey crispy pacing bit topped with a dollop of caviar.

The BLTA ( bacon, lettuce, tomato, & avocado) will be a great light filler.

From start to finish, the dining experience never disappoints.

If you're in downtown Las Vegas, consider coming here for lunch or dinner and enjoy a nice ambiance, experience, most importantly, some good food fare and leave with a smile on your face as well as a full belly!

3241764,2018-05-01,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Even with the address in hand the location of Carson Kitchen was questionable since there was no sign with the name. The neighbor a doughnut shop jumped out at us with a large sign.
We were seated immediately. Our arrival was mid way between lunch and dinner and there were several available tables. Our server promptly provided water and our cocktails. Initially the noise level was loud due to a table of six people. Once they received their food the talk level declined. Our server explained the menu and advised the food would come out as it is ready.
We ordered the following

Killer Shrimp
Secret Sunday Chicken

The Shrimp came out first. Very taste and crunchy the pepper creme and sliced jalapenos added some nice heat. A very enjoyable dish. 

The chicken was ordered without the bun because we heard that it's a large breast. Right on it was large. The fried chicken was the best crunchy breast ever. Delicious!  Our table was in full view of the open kitchen and we could see them repeatedly check the chicken with a thermometer to insure it was cooked just right. The chicken comes with tater tots that are deep fried grated potato balls. They were crispy outside & soft inside. Goes well with the aioli or ketchup.

The wait time for the chicken was exceedingly long. At one point our sever brought over a complementary order of baked mac & cheese and apologized for the delay. Don't know what happened to cause the delay but when the check arrived there was no charge for the chicken. I questioned our server and she stated the chicken  was complementary due to the long wait. I was not expecting that response.

The baked mac & cheese is a large portion that easily feeds 2 people. I tried the mac & cheese but not being a fan I can only say it was tasty and filling..

One improvement I would like to see is padded seat cushions. Wood chairs become uncomfortable after a while.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,4,4,4,5pSxEs_N_HqGRlTgkUh9uA

3284860,2015-12-07,2,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Having done a lot of research on this place I was looking forward to this downtown delight.  First off, if you didn't know it was there you would have trouble finding this spot, but it's worth the hunt.  As soon as you enter the place you feel as if your transported out of downtown.  Carson's is a small joint, but does well with the space it has.  Lots of bar like seating forces you to engage your fellow patrons in  conversation. The place is very clean and you can see everything from the bar to the cooks prepping your food.  Very cool atmosphere.

The place only went up from there.  Our waitress Tara was absolutely amazing.  Going over the entire menu, telling us what has changed,(Cause they are in the process of changing their  seasonal menus.) to recommend her personal favorites, and occasional checking in on us without being pushy.  Everything a waitress should aspire to be.  Well done Tara.

This food is designed to order several different things, and to be shared amongst your party.  This mite force you to abandon your virtual partner / cell phone and have to participate in conversation which I love. We decided on the Chicken Skins, Gyro Tacos and their Mac and Cheese; with a couple tasty brews to top it off.

All the food was amazing with an abundance of flavor and the perfect portion size. Was defiantly full when I left.  We finished it off with bread pudding that was a good balance of cinnamon, caramel, and vanilla.  

With the redo of Downtown if full effect; this place is a perfect addition.  The only downfall is the lack of seating, but if you go during non peak hours you will be fine.  Well done to you Carson's Kitchen you are what is right about a local eatery.  Will be back soon.",-zq5x_Dxub8k0YOWvqn2Rg,3,2,5,XmB-jiWHe8gUIvswL5K76Q

3295590,2014-09-14,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Giving this place an okay and passing 3 stars. I do not write reviews but I came into this place with pretty high expectations and I'm pretty disappointed. I'm just motivated to write this review out of sheer disappointment.

Came in Saturday night around 9:30. Already missed the dinner rush but this place was still packed and the vibe and ambiance was still upbeat. We sat at the counter and got a good view of the kitchen. Our server Courtney was very nice and pleasant.

Ordered the Magarian for a drink. Aviation gin, thyme, lemon, honey, and cucumber soda water. It was pretty standard. Nothing special.

Now the food. Ordered the beet salad. The cauliflower. Veal meatballs. Steak. Sliders. Tacos. And the fudge brownie for dessert.

I think I like this dish just because I love beets in general. Came with orange slices, goat cheese, and pistachios. Eat everything together and it's good. If you're not a beet eater you might think this dish is awesome but if you're like me this dish is just your standard beet salad.

Veal meatballs. Nicely executed but I found the flavor lacking. Meatballs were light and not dense. Prepared and cooked nicely. It was actually enjoyable to eat except it needs more flavor. It was under seasoned. The sherry foie gras cream was nice. Though you can't really taste the foie. It was a rich sauce but not reminiscent of foie at all. So that under delivered. And the peas, I don't know what it's doing on that dish. It could've been a pea shoot salad with a nice zippy dressing to cut through that cream.

The steak. We asked for medium rare and it was cooked medium rare. Nice crust on the steak, pink inside, and a nice sauce to accompany it with. But for a restaurant with a reputation like this I already expect that you know how to cook steak. Although maybe they could've used some finishing salt here. Fleur de sel. Himalayan. Black. Any salt sprinkled on top by the kitchen to let me know there's some thought in this dish. Don't just send me a piece of meat. Send me a piece of meat with some ""oomph!"" Oh and please. Don't tell me about the salt shaker! For 18 bucks I think it should've came with a side of something. Potatoes or cream spinach or asparagus spears. Just something, anything to eat with the steak. Doesn't have to be big or a lot. Meat needs something. Even Michelin rated restaurants give you something. Mind is not blown here. 

The lamb gyros. They were good but you can live with skipping it. Find real lamb gyros somewhere else. I just have to say that the meat tasted like spaghetti meat sauce without the sauce.

Short rib sliders. We ordered these under the recommendation of our server. She said these are to die for. I thought otherwise. I didn't read the description on this because I trusted our server so I took a bite knowing full well what short ribs should taste like. Meaty, rich, deep, earthy short ribs except they were not!!! I love short ribs so I was very, very, very disappointed. There was something sweet in it then I read the description it said rootbeer glaze. It might as well say sugar syrup because you can't taste the rootbeer. You just taste sweet.  There was no taste or note of caramelization to merit it to be even called a ""glaze."" That was a sad excuse to call it a ""glaze."" It wasn't deep or rich. I picked apart my slider so I could taste just the meat and it was just blah. It is shockingly dull and under seasoned. The slider buns came from a bag. They weren't warmed or anything. Eating it felt like a chore. Also served with tater tots. Which probably was the highlight of the dish... Maybe the night. 

Now the dessert. Bourbon fudge brownie and brown butter bacon ice cream. The ice cream was good. Enjoyable actually. But that brownie. My god! that brownie! That brownie was served to us frozen hard as a brick. It was so hard that when we tried to slice it the brownie flipped out of the plate and onto the floor. Didn't need utensils at all cuz we were eating what's left of the brownie with our hands. Picking it up and biting off bits of it like solid chocolate. It was terrible.

We also ordered the cauliflower because our server recommended it but the kitchen might've forgotten to make it. Dessert came and our check came but our cauliflower never made it to our table. It was still included in our tab though so I just asked the server to take it off. She let the kitchen know what happened and Courtney came back and apologized and took it off out check.

Would I come back here? I might. There are other dishes here that still interests me to try. I wouldn't take my out of town friends here though. There are other great places to try out, experiment, and enjoy. It's a nice looking restaurant with a cool vibe and ambiance to it. It's a cool spot to be seen but the food while has great concept suffers from the lack of depth of flavor and under seasoning. 

Final note. When working in the kitchen: TASTE TASTE TASTE TASTE! Taste your food before you send it out to us!!",M5N5-xUOYd3eQFcO6ffmHw,3,1,3,zt44rLLauwAlq7V6ExGFSA

With lots of advice about the menu from the extra handsome guy behind the bar, I decided on ordering the Filet O Fish sandwich. They came out with the wrong order, a chicken sandwich, which caused me to have to wait a few more min for my food. It didn't kill the moment though, I kept myself busy with a second drink. Yas. It was that good.
The sandwich was OK it felt like it was miss the tangy/tart element. The tater tots that came with it were perfect. I asked to have bit of the spicy pickle aioli, because I had heard it mentioned twice while I was there so I was curious. It was pretty tasty and a good compliment to the fish sandwich but not what I felt was missing.

3326840,2016-04-02,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I love when I can write a rave review about a place.  It's not often I give 5 stars, but when I do I mean it!

I'll start off by saying this, it's a small place so having a group of 17 people for a sit down dinner can be a little stressful up in here, but it can happen and it can be amazingly good!  And it's just so beautiful and welcoming in there.  Certainly a place to sit and stay awhile while you sip cocktails, have great conversations and enjoy amazing food. 

We made reservations for my man's birthday dinner @ Carson's on a Sunday night around 8:30.  The staff was very obliging with the fact that I didn't want to do a special prefix menu and drinks which was great since I didn't want to make people eat food or drink things they didn't want. 
 
When we arrived (a bit early) the place was full and they weren't quite ready for our group yet.  They let us know there was an outdoor patio area where we could wait with our drinks until our table was ready.  The bartender was a good sport when he got pounded with drink orders - but he handled it professionally and whipped them out for us.  He was shaking and stirring so hard, he had to take off his over shirt to cool down, but he didn't miss a step and made each one deliberately delicious.  He even whipped out some off the menu orders for us.   I stuck with the classic 'Towns End' and it remained my sipping pleasure for the evening.  The outdoor space was really great too.  A little fire pit glowing to keep us warm while we sipped our cocktails and beer.  It's a great area to relax and mingle while you wait for a table. 

Once we were finally seated we realized we had a few more people than seats, but the waitress and hostess (though a little frazzled) handled it well and we worked it all out.  Our waitress was the bomb and took control of the orders with gusto and charm!  I loved how organized and knowledgeable she was.  She helped my sister in law figure out what her allergic self could consume and didn't miss a beat when food started arriving about who it went to.   She was energetic and witty from start to finish!  Great job lady!!  I hate that in the chaos I didn't remember this feisty, petite, curly sand blonde headed gal's name.  But I'm sure the owners know they have a catch with her there!

The food - every bit was delish and we tried so many things!!  As a vegetarian, I can attest that there is PLENTY for you to eat here.   Just for starters the Tempura Green Beans, Young Beets and Rainbow Cauliflower were all scrumptious.  Many of my meat eaters loved all their dishes too.   But what topped my evening off was the Bonofee Pie.  Oh my my - this is like your grandmas banana pudding massively upgraded.  As full as I was I licked every last morsel of that off the bowl.  SO GOOD.

Maybe it was a Monday night and that's why it wasn't as busy but we got in and seated within 10 minutes. We were fortunate enough to sit at the table top bye the chefs/kitchen. If you like special drinks we highly recommend the Get Shorty. It was so tasty with tequila/fresh grapefruit and cayenne pepper. We ordered the bacon Brie Jam. Very rich dish; recommend ordering if you have a group to help finish off the large portion. The pork belly fig flatbread the super tasty. However the jerk turkey burger stole the show! With the spicy tater tots and the coleslaw, the jerk turkey burger was simply fantastic! Even my husband who is not fond of turkey burgers couldn't resist having half of the turkey burger. Will definitely be coming back for more turkey burgers and Get Shorty cocktails.",MHCyJ5hv2hucEmYlvwyDsA,0,0,5,DlvP7O0ZQWDm4j14NIBybw

About 8 months ago me and my fiancé decided to go here on a date and that night started our love affair with Carson Kitchen.

We have been back many times since and it never disappoints. My goal has been to try everything on the menu, little did I know the menu changes from time to time and I'm left in an endless quest to try everything this awesome little restaurant can make.

Staff is very friendly and attentive, food is always on point, can get pricey but totally worth it. Expect wait times, but also worth it.

Here's a list of things you must try:

1. Baked Mac & Cheese - it's ridiculous how good it is, not enough to share so order two
2. Watermelon Feta salad
3. Chicken Skins - best shared with the table
4. Secret Sunday Chicken - one of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had
5. Butter Burger
6. Tempura Green Bean - also a must every visit
7. Cocoa Espresso steak 
8. Glazed Donut bread pudding

The Get Shorty is also a good drink to wash all this down with if you like tequila and your drinks to have a bit of spice.

There's so much more. Don't be afraid to get out of your comfort zone and Carson Kitchen will reward you.",hV1DuyLT67hwgDyLZ0Xl6g,0,0,5,YOPiaIIG8MyexbTS8fu1jQ

It's one of those locally known, must-hit spots in downtown Las Vegas.  Just know that you might miss it when walking by.  There's not much advertising and it's down a pretty empty road off to the side of Fremont.  But you walk in and they have an upstairs, outdoor area for eating, a downstairs patio, lounge area, and then your typical restaurant, inside, as well.

The ambiance is great for a nice evening out.  The menu is a little limited but all very unique and delicious.  Sizes vary, but 3 orders for a group of 2 people is probably fine for most of the dishes.  The prices are very fair and coming to Carson Kitchen won't put you back too much like other finer dining venues in town.  The quality of the food is right on par with those higher end venues, but this place is cheaper and gives you that local feel.

The staff is great, the food is great, and the venue is great.  Have a nice night out and go to Carson Kitchen.  You won't regret it.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,KFhPyqseUZ0CyF1dCWT1jQ

While it offers classic American cuisine, it also dares to take on ideas that play off classical American foods. Such examples are crispy chicken skins (a play on crispy chicken tenders) or hot oysters (a play on boneless chicken wings). When I went there, I tried to order items that aren't typically found on everyday menus. I ordered the chicken skins, the hot oysters, an asparagus burrata salad, and some crusted lamb. 

Most of the food was tasty and really interesting to try out. I never thought having chicken skins would work so well as an appetizer. The hot oysters were spicy, but I really liked the idea of trying an oyster that was coated with wing sauce and out of the shell. The burrata salad was quite unique; never have had a salad like that before, but the flavors inside the salad complemented each other. The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium-rare and had the perfect amount of seasoning. Overall, I would recommend trying it out if in the area.",cIvGYL1exRffd4qzahsC9w,0,0,4,-2eeMxu1l3m_IjBL8UXnvw

-parking: it's out of the strip, that area has parking with parking fee. It's not that easy to look for a parking. 
-location: it's just right next to Donut bar, which is a very famous donut shop in Vegas. 
-environment: it's an open kitchen one with some high chairs tables which you might have to share with others. The only thing was not that pleasant was the temperature of the night. It's was freezing cold when outside temperature was so nice. We couldn't enjoy much due to that. 
-service: our server was very nice and easy to talk with. She gave us some suggestions on the menu and came to update with us on the food serving. 
-meat balls: their meat balls were awesome, the meat was so tender and it's juicy with the top gravy. It's a good amount of portion too.
-fried chicken skin dipped with honey. Pretty creative. It's so crunchy that you cannot stop eating. 
-black rice risotto with short ribs was so good. The truffle oil enhances they whole dish. We enjoyed it a lot.
-taco: it was the pita bread style taco. I like this style more that the other. It's just perfectly made the taco easy to eat. The meat had a lot of flavors. 
-wile mushroom pita pizza: I like this a lot. It's the the topping, a lot of different ingredients, they were generous on the cheese and the wild mushroom, the crispy pita bread were matched them perfectly. 
-bread pudding was a must: it's so good. Hmmm, we enjoyed it. Bread and pudding were equally put together.

We got here 30 minutes before closing on a Saturday night and they welcomed us with open arms even though we were the last ones left. We started with the popular BBQ Burnt Ends and some cocktails, of course. The pork had a great crunch and not too fatty smothered with bold tasting highland ranch sauce. From the cocktail menu, I tried the Purple Haze made w/ Nevada H&C Silver Dollar Vodka, St. Elder Liqueur, fresh lemon, mint, crème de cassis and blueberry preserve. This was a fantastic strong drink so I ordered another :)  Then we just decided to get a variety of entrees to share including the Shrimp & Antebellum Grits, Black Rice Oxtail Risotto and another popular item, the Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip. No favorites here because each dish had its own unique flavor and presentation. All I can say that everything was well executed and prepped with passion. Plus the prices didn't break the bank. Appetizer, grits, and risotto were about $15 each and steak for $19. Pretty sweet!

Gyro tacos- perfectly cooked and the meat was delicious

The pepper jelly-cream cheese reminded me of a familiar childhood taste. Next we had the fried chicken skins which along with the mac n cheese were my favorites. Both were exceptionally flavorful and a must-have when I return. The calamari and mushroom flatbread were both good, but not as big of a standout compared to the other food. 

For dessert we got the twinkles and  the bread pudding. The twinkles were not my favorite, but I could see somebody that likes the soggy-cake taste really digging them.  The bread pudding was really good and went perfect with  a fresh brewed cup of coffee.

3395521,2014-08-02,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"We arrived at Carson's Saturday afternoon after searching for it as we drove down Carson Street. The resturant is situated in the Old John Carson Hotel.  You have to look for it. The name is located on the lower part of the window in black letters, hard to distiguish with the glare from the sun. We entered  Carson's K and there were a few people there and it was nice a quiet. The place is nicely decorated and we like the mixture of woods, metal and tile work. The kitchen is open which I liked but the tables are mostly big tables that I assume you would share with other people you do not know if your party is only two people. That would not be so bad if the stools were not so close together. I am have wide shoulders and so does my partner and to be honest, it is not comfortable if you are paying for an experience.  I like experiences but not if I am being intruded by people who are sitting right on top of me.
 
We sat in at a table across from the bar with a view of the old Post Office. We were immediately greeted by our server who was friendly and listed all of the foods that we had questions about. She took our drink order and after some time we ate our first choice,  the Crispy Chicken skins......Ok, we normally do not eat skin, but this was pure heaven. They were crisp and perfectly seasoned. I like the honey sauce that came along with it.
 
A short time later, our orders arrived:  me the Fried Green Tomato with lump crab ravigote. It was great. I wish there more tomatoes on it. The tomatoes were lightly breaded and fried.  PERFECT!!!!  Kerry, tell the cooks to put more on there. The tator tots were crispy and fresh and not as greasy as I thought they would be.
 
My other half had the Butter Burger with boursin and chedder. The cheese was a little too heady (spelling?) and it did not taste so hot. The burger itself was good. It was not dry and had a great flavor to it. My partner ate it all up after scraping the cheeses off.
 
Our services was good, not great.  Our drinks were never refilled or were we asked if we wanted more to drink....bad!!!  When I go out, I want service, not half hearted, come on strong them leave me waiting. That is not a way to win a repeat. Aside from that, everything else was good. I am not sure if we will be back. The place is small and I can not imagine how crowded it must get at night.  I wonder why they did not build a larger space.

The cool vibe of bigger bar tables is fun but it's hard to share the table with other parties sitting elbow to elbow. I was seated next to a party of 2 who ordered multiple appetizers, which gave me very little room for my plate, let alone my drink & flatware. We could have sat on the patio but it was too hot out.

A big group of us were exploring Fremont Street so we decided to stop by here based on Yelp reviews. I didn't realize it was such a small and intimate restaurant. We were escorted on their outside lawn which is filled with lawn chairs and some tables while the waiter asked the owner if there would be seating available for us. We were wondering if we could sit outside and eat but someone from Carson Kitchen came out and told us that he could split our party up and accommodate our large party as long as we finish by a certain time due to a reservation. We all agreed but then he said that they couldn't split checks. The could only split in groups of 3's. My friend asked why and the he simply stated ""because it's our policy."" My friend was curious and asked again why is this the policy since they could obviously split checks but it could only be done in 3's, he replied again in a rude tone ""because it's our policy."" I think we all would have agreed even with this interesting 'policy' but we were just wondering why. We were here for a conference so we needed our receipts to be itemized and separate. We did not need someone from the staff to be rude to prospective customers. I'm sure the food is great, but this man needed an attitude check if he thinks he's the reason for the success of this restaurant. We ended up leaving through the back, we didn't need someone to be so condescending to us. Sad I missed out on what seems to be an amazing food experience but we as a group felt like we were disrespected.

The owner contacted me after my review and was extremely apologetic about this situation. I hope this issue will be resolved so that others won't have the same experience we did. The owner also invited us back to actually enjoy the food. I'll be sure to come back with a smaller party the next time I'm in Vegas.",BrqlQ0DHSz1yUUYc4MyOxw,3,0,1,RaJIqXoSoXNvwXLstvjfjA

The creativity and uniqueness are a few things that I feel separate Carson kitchen for a few other spots in town with similar concepts. From fried chicken skins to gyro tacos everything is full of flavor and plated to perfection! Carson kitchen does offer reservations and does tend to be busy most of the time. Highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner!,055mHXHyW4wE3dwVSNMs9g,0,0,5,8F8gr7FR1-E7S7Ltgj7z-A
3442157,2017-10-09,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Very flavorful food.  Cool ambiance.  Service had a little room for improvement - 20 minutes to bring me the wine I ordered; hostess was a little short with me when I asked if I could sit at the bar (four open seats) and snottingly told me that all seats had at least a 20 minute wait.  Vegas restaurants  seem to have an attitude that you're lucky to be there these days.  That's true to a lesser degree in Chicago, but Vegas is more extreme in this way.  But, as my skin gets a bit thicker, it's not worth docking a star for.  Just be aware that they have a bit of a smug arrogance to their approach to dealing with customers.

What I enjoy about Carson Kitchen is how many of the items on the menu are sharable, making this the perfect location to dine at with a small group. Emphasis on SMALL because this place does get packed around peak hours. 

On to the food!

Crispy Chicken Skins: Eating these gave me a warm, comforting feeling..or were my arteries clogging up? Whatever. Fried chicken skins served without the chicken is a daydream come true. The smoked honey sauce goes great with skins, though the deep fried flavor is fine by itself. 

Bison Meatloaf Sliders: I stalked Carson Kitchen's Instagram and spotted these sliders and had to have them. The petite patties are flavorful and moist and come with a side of tater tots.

Veal Meatballs: Essentially, fancy Swedish meatballs, but, you know, way better because of the sherry foie gras cream. *salivating*

Compared to my previous visit, the service was warmer, and I attribute this to having eaten at the bar. It just felt like we received more attention there as opposed to eating at a table. Before I forget, there are purse hooks beneath the bar counter, because who wants to cradle their baggage while eating?

I can't stress enough how dining here is a MUST if you're in the downtown area. The menu may sound unusual, but keep an open mind.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,5,5,5,sx8VephBDItOio4R01wyJQ

3480052,2016-09-02,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I post this review with mix emotions, I love eating here ever since I found it on a weekend getaway. We have come back many times with fam/friends. I also refer others (blogging, IG, FB), (Love Bacon Jam). With that said I feel a little gouged. Let me explain; I thought it would be a perfect place to host a bachelor party dinner (patio). So I went ahead to set up for a dinner at 8 pm. But as u know it's hard to wrangle up 12 guys from drinking, napping, and gambling. So I called to say I was running late, they said that was fine. So we had a good dinner. Then we got the catering bill, and then I noticed an additional charge of $300. I was like shocked. The manager said your party was charged $150 for ""every 30 mins"" past the reservation which was noted in the catering contract. Totally my fault for not getting the group there on time (and for not reading the details of the contract). But then I reviewed the bill, and I noticed the bill had a time stamp of 10:39 pm, Our reservation was to be from 8-10pm. So I was puzzled when I was charged 2 increments. Come Monday when I had a chance to recover from Vegas (getting too old for this stuff), looking back on the event, I was left to wonder if those additional 9 mins were totally attributed to us and only us? I recalled several possible factors that could have contributed to those extra 9 mins. Here are some that stuck out in my mind. 1) Even thou the waiter was nice, he did go on some long stories about his life in Las Vegas, fine...nice guy but let's get the food out. 2) Waiter decides to hold some food from the table until we finish other appetizers, which we had plenty of room for the food for the table plus with that many guys we would go through everything quickly, no need to wait, but to go back and forth from the stairs takes time. 3) The waiter was nice of enough to bring us extra desserts for us to consume even thou we were already done with dessert,(added time to our event). 4) When fixing the bill, he rang up the alcohol on the catering bill we had said to leave it on a separate check, so the waiter had to go back and adjust the bill. then I get the bill at 10:39. So what I am trying to say is those extra 9 mins could have been caused by many factors that we were not in our control/fault. I called the Carson kitchen later that week. Again everyone was courteous and professional. The GM heard me out, and I explained to him the situation like I stated above. He said he would take this back to the owner (Cory H) because he would ultimately have the final word. I mention again that I'm not looking for a full refund just a partial refund or maybe even a credit for next time. But from the some of the conversation with the managers at the restaurant and over the phone it seemed that the reason they were charging me was because they have been ""burn"" before. It seemed to me, Carson Kitchen wanted to punish us for being ""late"" and for staying over our time. So which is it then, are you charging us for being late or having the party go past the time or both? Because the contract makes it seem, I should have only been charged for each 30 minutes past my time and not for showing up late (which you guys made it seem, for both). It almost seems that it was out of anger or resentment for past situations with other customers, and I was told any chance of a refund would mean that they would be taking a loss. Which I totally understand why I was charged for the 1st 30 mins (would I have been charged at 10:01pm if I came at 8pm?)...and far as a ""lost""...I mean it's not like I consumed $150 worth of food and then I asking for a refund for that...this is 9 mins we are talking about that could have been caused by Carson kitchen staff or us. In the end, $150 would not have bankrupted Carson kitchen or myself or created anarchy among other patrons. I think the compromise or gesture from Carson Kitchen would have been nice, it would have garnered so much more effort from me to post on yelp about the situation in a more positive manner than I am now. This situation has left a bad taste in my mouth, and I found myself hard to recommend this place without letting them know about this incident (I really did like this place). I truly believe in the power of 5, 1 person will tell 5 other people and those other 5 people will tell 5 other people, but in today's age with media, it's more like 1 person tells thousand other people and so on. I appreciate Matt's effort to speak to the owner and even offer me a drink to bury the hatchet the next time I'm in town. But what I really want to ask Cory H was that $150 charge for 9min worth alienating a frequent customer? Again thank you, Matt and Julie, for being understanding and handling our business. I give the food 4 stars, standard service 3 stars but catering operation 1 stars. Total 8 stars divided by 3 categories = 2.6 avg stars (just in case you wondered how I came up with that rating.

The lack of signage makes it difficult to find, but it's totally worth the search. I've tried two other Kerry Simon restaurants and wasn't wowed. This place, however, lives up to the hype.

The menu is full of small and large plates of  Simon's re-imagining of comfort food. Deviled eggs ($8) are refreshingly light on mayo, topped with crispy, meaty chunks of pancetta and caviar that adds a bit of salinity to the dish. The crispy chicken skins ($8) became more addictive with each bite and the bacon jam's ($12) smokey, sweet, and savory profile was hard to resist. A sizable portion for our party of three, we had to request more toasted baguettes to finish it up.

The rabbit ragu ($12) was a slight let down. The thin ragu had a slight kick to it, but the course texture of the squash had me wishing it was cooked longer. Another dish that failed to excite was the gyro tacos ($10). Familiar flavors weren't enough to make this dish stand out among all the others. 

A slightly better dish, the Wellington empanada ($10) was filled with lightly seasoned beef tenderloin wrapped in a thick, flakey pastry shell. The sprouts and spuds hash ($10) was excellent and a great size for sharing. I was thrilled to see the sprouts and potatoes cooked to an almost burnt level with plenty of char and crispy edges. The last savory dish was the wild mushroom flatbread ($10). Showcasing a blistered crust topped with mushrooms, onions and cabrales bleu cheese, it was a solid dish with somewhat understated flavors complimenting each other.

With just enough room for dessert we started with the Not Your Father's Twinkies ($8). It was an underwhelming fried sponge cake with piped in filling and an orange coulis that added a little brightness and acidity, with a touch of basil that seemed like a mistake. The Glazed donut bread pudding ($8), on the other hand, was an excellent showcase in restrained sweetness. Ending the meal was the bourbon fudge brownie ($8) with brown butter bacon ice cream. Dense and rich, there's nothing fancy about this dish, just one that was well executed and sweet enough for any chocolate lover.

Heading back to his roots, chef Simon and team have created a restaurant that can already be considered one of the best Downtown and a spot that both tourists and locals should check out.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,11,6,4,SNn21HXC0Dqj0QTEw8UYhg

Great place to sit, eat and just relax and listen to the music.  The patio is a great place to enjoy the spring weather in Las Vegas. Located in the downtown area of Las Vegas near 
Fremont street.  The city is doing wonderful things downtown these days and from only going once or twice since I moved here 15 years ago, we find that we go as often as once a week and enjoy all that downtown offers.  

Back to the Patio dining, the bar was attended by a lovely lady, I believe her name was Tara.  She was not only very attentive, but she was pleasant and had a great personality.  Kudos to Carson Kitchen for hiring such a lovely lady to attend their bar.  

My partner and I will be coming back to this restaurant many times in the future. It is on our list of our favorite places to eat,drink and relax.",pgV-ccThvQbcST8R7PzsAg,0,0,5,QwYuIyo1bn7kAENmmbMeQQ

It was pretty full since their upper patio area had some kind of business thing going on so I had to wait about 5 minutes for a seat at the bar.  The wait wasn't bad since there is a little courtyard right out the back door that has some nice seats to wait.

When I was sat at the bar the bartender asked if I was having any food tonight.  When I said yes she gave me a menu and a napkin with silverware.  I got a Margarian to drink and ordered the pork belly Cuban sandwich.  While I was waiting for my food the guy next to me got an order of the mac and cheese and it smelled awesome.  I almost want to change my order because of that.

The drink was light and refreshing and the sandwich was really good.  I really enjoyed the spicy tots that came with sandwich as well.  As much as I would have liked to have ordered dessert, my meter time was almost up on my car.  The bartender quickly got me my bill and I was back out in time to feed the meter.

They totally lived up to my expectations!  The chicken skins are served with a honey to dip them in, and the salty sweet combo is just what I wanted. We also tried the bacon jam, which was a little to sweet for me (I was picturing more smoky/salty), but it was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone at our table. Our meal was DELISH, and the service was perfect. Make sure to try the Rainbow Cauliflower, and the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding.  I had the Bourbon Brownie and Browned Butter Bacon ice cream.  The brownie had the texture of a chocolate bar, rather than a brownie, and the bourbon was truly present - almost overwhelming, but the ice cream was great. 

All of the drinks on their menu use really obscure liquors, which I guess makes them a little more pricey. They do have a full bar, though.

3580575,2017-10-27,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I loved my experience here!  When I found myself in the Freemont Street area on a Friday night I turned to Yelp for restaurant suggestions.  The reviews were spot on.  Carson Kitchen is amazing.  
We were happy that there was no wait to be seated.  This was because we were OK with being seated at one of the communal tables.  Even though they are shared tables, you still have your own space and a decent amount of privacy.  We were in the back corner of the restaurant which gave us a great view of the fun scene that unfolds in this restaurant.
The server was friendly and informative.  She gave us plenty of information without being pushy or rude.  When we had questions, she answered them politely.  This was very helpful as we weren't sure how much and what to order.  She suggested 1-2 plates per person.  
We ordered the bacon jam to share, I ordered the tempura green beans and my dining companion ordered the jerk turkey burger.  
Food is brought out as it is ready (instead of in a specific order, like a salad or appetizer first).  
Everything we tried was phenomenal.  The bacon jam was totally unique and totally amazing.  A great combination of sweet and savory.  It included the bacon jam and some spreadable cheese on top.  It is served with bread.  The only slight down side is that I did wish it came with more bread,  You can order extra for $1 or so.  But you can also eat the jam by the spoonful (it is that good).  It does take awhile to cool.  The green beans were served with a cream cheese/hot pepper spread.  The beans had a crispness to them and the amount of breading on them was perfect.  I came hungry and was totally satisfied with splitting the bacon jam and eating the green beans.  My dining companion had the jerk turkey burger and commented that it was one of the tastiest she's ever had.

Cauliflower is great, gyro tacos are good, mac n cheese is really good, chicken skins are decent, devil's eggs with caviar are yummy too.  I have never had anything bad here.

3582736,2015-12-20,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Hip little Castro pub style spot with delicious and flavorful food along with tasty libations. 

You'll have to get used to the fact that they don't have many small personal tables and it's more large high tops seating with other guests but it's a fun way to talk to your neighbors and see what everyone else is eating. 

We started with a few gin cocktails called The Margarian. Refreshing and slightly sweet, the gin is hard to taste and the cucumber soda helps balance the sweet. Easy to drink! 

The menu changes with the seasons so it's nice to know there is always something new to try. I ordered the trout and blood orange and root salad. The trout tasted more like salmon and was so good! The skin was crispy, the fish was moist and it was seasoned well. It came with creamed kale and that was also flavorful and perfectly seasoned. The salad was also great. Different textures and tastes of sweet orange, rooted vegetables, olive oil, and celery leaves. Perfectly balanced and a great pairing for the fish. 

We finished our meal with what was recommend by not only our server but everyone else on yelp, the bread pudding! I'm not usually of fan of bread pudding but it's made with donuts, it sounded impossible to dislike. And it was. Holy donut deliciousness! It was so tasty! The caramel sauce it's served with was drinkable. Yum!

3607946,2015-03-28,2,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"WOW - so yum.

Our server was very friendly and accommodating. We ordered too much in the beginning and he helped us out by removing one of our items before it came out. Since we were told it was intended that we share meals, we thought we would be getting somewhat small portions, but that wasn't the case at all (good thing.) 

As for the food we ordered:

-Cuban sandwich - phenomenal. I am thinking about it right now. The bread was crispy and flavorful, pork belly was juicy in the perfect amount. I always like mustard and pickles (separately) but recently have very much been craving them and this definitely hit the spot.

-Scallops - flavor was very good but the one I got (we shared, came with three) was a little cold (sad face) but, it was super delicious. The other two were apparently good temperature.

-Bacon Jam - I don't know how to describe this flavor but you have to try it. It's savory and sweet (best combo ever?) and comes with more than you would expect.

-Mac and cheese - barely got to taste this because we were so full but, it was really yummy. It was the last thing we got, so by then, we were uncertain of how much we could eat, but we could just smell how delicious it would taste so we had to. I think my bf intended to put the leftover bacon jam on the leftover mac and cheese - I can't even imagine.... :-o

Can't wait to come back here. The only thing is that I would have to remember to bring a jacket because they keep it SUUUUUPER cold in here! Hopefully next time we could try out the patio upstairs, too.",wfK7oukwc90fVqFG2lw87w,2,2,5,BH_p2TJuvO5sbs_n0jfHYg

3611686,2015-06-10,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"So, I finally had the chance to visit Carson Kitchen in Downtown Las Vegas a few weeks ago for lunch. I had really liked Kerry Simon's previous restaurant, Simon Kitchen & Bar, at the HRH, so I figured that his newest restaurant near the Downtown Container Park would be pretty good. And my thoughts were that they did not disappoint!

THE DECOR (4.5 out of 5)
Upon entering the restaurant which seemed to have some lower ceilings, it seemed to not have that much of a dining area beyond a few tables, the bar area and seating near the kitchen. However, they do have a larger area upstairs on their rooftop patio which I think would be great for parties. The restaurant is kind of dimly lit, but with plenty of accent lighting in the bar area and in the kitchen, so I kind of liked it. It had a hip but intimate vibe to it. They also had an outdoor patio area where we waited for a couple of seats to open up which was nice, although that might get a little hot in the heat of the summer.

THE SERVICE (4.5 out of 5) 
So after a short wait outside on that patio, we were seated at a couple of chairs that were immediately adjacent to the kitchen where we were literally a few feet away from one of the prep/sous chefs (not exactly sure what her title was, so just go with me here). Our server explained that many of their dishes are of the shareable kind and was attentive to our needs when we needed a refill, etc.

THE FOOD (5 out of 5)
And what did I think about the food? I thought that it was delicious! We had a couple of ""social plates"" of the Bacon Jam (which was awe-some.....and I wish that they would jar that stuff up because I'd buy a few jars of it if they did) and the ""Devil's"" Eggs with crispy pancetta + caviar (I liked it although I think that I would've liked to have had the pancetta more thinly chopped, my preference). Then I had the Pork Belly Cuban Sandwich which came with spicy tator tots (which was great and came with tasso ham + manchego cheese). 

Next time I'm going to try the Crispy Chicken Skins and the Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto which a really good friend of mine (also another foodie) said were really good!

OVERALL (5 out of 5)
Overall, I think that Carson Kitchen is more like a 4.5 out of 5, but since Yelp doesn't offer any 1/2 ratings, I decided to give it 5 stars (as 4 stars just isn't quite enough). So, if you're looking for some really good food, I'd highly suggest checking out Carson Kitchen as it is now my ""GO-TO"" spot Downtown.",JDXcf0qEwoeo8fx9TlPMeA,0,0,5,o4-ilaAPbzUCqdJW_ARR1w

Group dining is the way to go here, since the plates are perfect for sharing. Our server was amazing- made helpful recommendations about dishes to try, how much to order, cleared plates in a way that was efficient, but didn't make us feel like we were being rushed out the door. Definitely 5 star staff. The food was OK, but the menu didn't offer many vegetarian options, so probably not a place I would come back to, but everyone else seemed to like it.

We ordered a ton, probably a bit too much for a group of 7...
- Deviled eggs- Four halves = $11. These were nice a creamy with a bit of space and some type of meat on top
- Roasted beets- ($11) YUM!
- Caesar salad- ($12) fine with a good dressing, but on the small side
- Lamb tacos 3 small street-style size = $12, add one more for $4- I thought just OK, but you shouldn't take my word for it since I'm not a big lamb eater and definitely don't prefer ground meat
- Baked mac and cheese ($12)- didn't really love this. It was nice and creamy, but wasn't very hot and had truffle oil that seemed too strong
- Rainbow cauliflower- ($9)- I love cauliflower and am sad to say this is the first cauliflower dish I think I've ever ordered out and not enjoyed. I didn't care for the strong vinegar flavor
- Wild mushroom flatbread ($14)- meh. The pickled onions were nice, but I didn't care for the tuffle oil

Other things that we ordered, I didn't try, but they seemed to be crowd pleasers with my dinner companions:
- Bacon jam with brie ($13). Pro tip, save some to eat with the mac and cheese
- Veal meatballs- ($14)
- Pig & Fig flatbread- ($13)
- Black Mussels- ($14)
- Short rib grilled cheese with tater tots ($14)

We were walk ins at dinner/after work cocktail time on a Friday so didn't mind waiting a few minutes to be seated.  They have a neat courtyard in back of the restaurant that's nice to sit in while waiting.  We were really lucky being seated at the 2 corner seats at the counter because we really got to see how a well run restaurant functions.  We watched as the manager called orders to the kitchen and as he expedited all the food that was coming out.  He set up all the plates with whatever accompaniments were needed for the each dish and the second the food was ready, it was put on the plates and he quickly had a server deliver them to the tables.  If there was no server available right then, he'd deliver them himself.  ALL the food hit the tables piping hot, just how it should be.

With this being said, my favorite things we ordered were the Tempura green beans with chili-pepper jelly cream cheese, and the Crispy fried chicken skins with smoked honey.  The time elapsed between the time they left the fryer to the time they were in front of our drooling lips was at the most 30 seconds.  They both were piping hot, crispy, perfectly seasoned, and delicious as hell.

The other 2 dishes we ordered were the Pecan crusted lamb chops with a mint chimichurri and the Veal meatballs with sherry foie cream.  These were also good with the lamb being better...a perfect mid-rare and the minty chimichurri gave a nice hit to it.

The directions from YELP put us in the wrong place on 6th street but after a quick phone call to the establishment they got us headed in the right direction. Find the white building with blue trim on Carson!

Thank you to Philip T for the awesome list of local favorites. We're so glad you told us about this place!

There are different seating areas, one is a community table near the bar, one is a bar near the kitchen with the remaining seating being tables for 2-4 persons.

Because I was in a hipster locale I had to get a hipster drink so I got my new favorite beverage, the Moscow Mule. It was delicious!

We started with the Devils Eggs and they were so tasty!  Next we enjoyed the Gyro Tacos, and the Black Bean Oxtail Risotto. I have a total sweet tooth and the Donut bread pudding did not disappoint!

The service was outstanding and the food came out from the kitchen quickly so that it was perfectly hot when it was served.

This place is a foodies dream and we'll definitely be back again!  In the meantime, Carson Kitchen, how about opening up a location in Orange County, CA?  Please?",8LRRYce7kIV4pqXNs_lL6A,5,5,5,fkKi_tbzguqaoF5fPjrL7A

We were asked to wait 10-20min and my anticipation elevated as I looked around and people just seemed very happy about the food! 

Maybe after 15 min wait we were seated on the center large high counter table. I checked yelp reviews and ordered four tapas size plates (although they recommend only three. We were hungry!);

1. Bacon jam with baked Brie and baguette.
OMG!!! This is just amazing and I can see myself going back for this. Definitely my fav...pretty addictive..

2. Devils eggs- very good 

3. Hawaiian Spam sliders - gotta get anything with spam!  Very good!!

4. Mac 'n cheese - this is very good also.

Menu changes from time to time, but everything is wonderful.  I usually go for the beet salad and then any meet entree.  Gyro pitas are always great, and they make an exceptionally good chicken sandwich.

Drinks are good too.  Cucumber gin n tonic is a good hot weather choice.

3673223,2014-07-28,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Good things first: 
-Food was DELICIOUS! We loved everything we ate. Tempura green beans were super yum, I could have eaten another entire platter of them especially with that cream cheese pepper jam dipping sauce. I had the short rib sliders and they were delectable with a nice sweetness to the meat. My husband, a vegetarian, had the fried green tomato sandwich and loved it. 
-Service was terrific! Our server was attentive, funny, and helpful. I was never without water. Great experience there. 
-Prices were very reasonable for the quality of food. And our portion sizes were great. I left STUFFED. 

Now a few bad, which is the only reason I've taken off one star:
-The seating is terribly uncomfortable. We were seated at the communal table with high wooden chairs. The seats of the chairs just aren't quite long enough so they cut me off at mid-thigh, painfully. Also, there is a poured concrete ""step"" around the table. I'm thinking this was for you to rest your feet on, but it's not high enough for my legs to reach, so was pointless. I still had to rest my legs on my chair. I am 5'7"". Also, the concrete slab makes it impossible to pull your chair all the way in to the table, making me just a bit too far away to sit and eat without having to lean in. Awkward. 
-I ordered a ""microbrew"" soda, they have a few on the menu, and I was excited to try Dr. Better. It was served to me with the bottle and a glass of ice. Great, except the bottle was warm. Not like only-recently-placed-in-the-refrigerator-to-chill warm. It was HOT like it was sitting in a non-air conditioned storeroom. My friend's soda was also served to him in a warm bottle. It was unfortunate because the flavor of the soda was diluted by pouring it warm over the ice. Why would they not serve it chilled? Do they not have a room for a soda refrigerator? It struck me as strange. And irritating. 
-It was really loud in there. The music wasn't loud, but all those folks talking in such a small space made for a noisy noisy dining experience. It was hard to have a conversation between just me, my husband, and our friend. Oh well. 

Overall though, we will definitely be back because the food and service was great and there are other things I want to try. I will however try to grin and bear it while sitting on their uncomfortable seats, not bother ordering a soda again, and will forgo conversation and just focus on eating!",KmfFjKFWcSUHGkkIHfpjAQ,0,0,4,4wWwD2otV3nAsz3pn_T-fA

The Butter Burger was so good, along w the Mac n Cheese, which was more creamy than gooey cheese. I personally like more gooey/melty cheese. And the Fried Chicken Skins were awesome.

3698163,2015-02-09,2,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Hidden in the mean streets of DT Las Vegas. You really have to be someone with the intent to come to Carson Kitchen. It's very low key, without any vibrant neon lights or flashy sign to attract you (if you were a tourist). So to me I think this place is the very essence of what you can call local. You won't know unless you've seriously heard it from a local person, and have done your research.

Word of mouth? I think really does this place good. The great food and service really speaks for itself, and well everyone is talking about it too!

*VEAL MEATBALLS:
I'm not a big Veal person, but this is a choice you just have to make. If you're the carnivore type. I would go for it. It has that wonderful rich flavor, filling taste and texture. This can possibly fill you, but if you are just all about meats. Give it a go.

*NY STRIP STEAK:
Can't go wrong with steak right? Juicy tenderness (they know the difference between their medium rare and rare)! I ordered a medium rare. It had that nice well and flavorful outer layer, and that nice slightly but not too pink middle. Perfecto!

RAINBOW CAULIFLOWER:
You need your daily dose of veggies. If you're not a big veggie person, or a salad person! I would suggest trying this. The flavors are rich enough, and the veggie is so subtle in taste that you can barely tell they're vegetables.

*BLACK RICE & OXTAIL RISOTTO:
Forever and ever. I love this dish so much. It's very rich too and jam packed with cheese. You'll see what I mean. Every pull. Every scoop from a fork you'll see a nice lovely trail of melted cheese holding on to your fork, making it's way to your mouth. It's a party for your taste buds. 

WILD MUSHROOM FLATBREAD:
AMAZING! I would like to thank the Carson Kitchen gods (well, more so the manager) for hooking us up with a complimentary flatbread. Flatbread is also great! Big portion (this will take a good portion of your appetite). So, if you have the intent of trying the heavier dishes, I'd just take a pass on this. Unless you're really craving a flatbread.

BROCCOLI CRUNCH:
Great salad. I'd vouch for it, it has a nice sweet taste to it, with a good crunch from the nuts. Although, amongst all the other plates, this may not have shined as much as the others.

Service:
In the humblest way, I love their gesture for not wasting food, and these small acts of services they provide to just give their customers an extra kick to their evening. We all know miss orders can happen, and well the manager was kind enough to first, kindly ask if we have food allergies (way to go!), and then, proceeded to offer a complimentary dish due to a mis-order. Way-to-go Carson Kitchen on being proactive.

Waitress was super attentive with us, and very helpful as far as alternatives (chicken skins and bacon jams was sold out). She knows her dishes. She came by periodically and checked on us and of course. She too had a great sense of humor. Love this place!",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,5,4,5,L_5phC8MBIeW-kAk8AmbFw

The burrata and asparagus salad (which also had summer peas and something else...fennel?) was fresh and perfect for the heat. The oxtail and black rice risotto was tangy and sweet, fun texture. The gyro tacos were a fun ""appetizer"" of sorts. We would have ordered a few more dishes if we hadn't have dinner plans already. Come by if you're feeling off-strip for a casual, chill atmosphere and some fun dishes.

3715389,2014-07-27,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I have mixed feelings about this place, but the good outweigh the bad, so I definitely recommend anyone to try it.

The first time I went here was for dinner.  I got the rabbit ragu and my husband got the oxtail risotto.  Both were absolutely delicious, but very small portions.  Now, the prices were $12 and $14, respectively, which I thought were a little steep for the amount of food that came with it.  A friend of ours got the beet salad ($8) and I was again shocked at the small portion size.  We also had a few cocktails ($12 each) which were good, but again a small pour for the price.  I also remember it being extremely LOUD in there because of the design/layout/building materials.  Our waiter had to lean in and ask us multiple times what we had said and I felt like I was shouting at him.  So my first impression was: very good food, but kinda expensive for what you get.

Second time we came for lunch.  I got the fried green tomato sandwich which comes with tater tots.  My husband got the gyro tacos.  Then we shared the bread pudding for dessert.  The sandwiches and sharing plate prices are much more on point with serving size.  The fried green tomato sandwich was really quite scrumptious and had this nice crab ravigote on it.  The sandwich plus tots was $10.  Cheaper than the entrees, with more substance!  The gyro tacos came with three to the order,  and were also $10.  The tacos were mucho spicy, beware!  Also, my husband got a craft beer in a bottle for only like $5.

In conclusion, I like this place for lunch type food and beer.  Dinner food and the cocktails are just a little too expensive for me.  Whatever you get will be delicious.

Service was great, pricing was decent. I would suggest sharing everything as their plates are kind of tapas style except for their burgers. Burgers are huge BTW so don't expect to be able to finish that and have sides without leaving feeling overly full and uncomfortable. 

This is what I had to eat starting with my fav (I shared of course):
1- Mac & Cheese- it's so gooey with cheese but not overwhelmingly stinky or heavy, very good mixture of cheese and whatever used to thicken the sauce. I couldn't get enough and I'm definitely not a cheese person. 
2- Margherita pizza(I forget what it was called)-  Slightly heavier than expected so I would put it between a normal pizza and a margherita pizza. 
3- Jerk Turkey Burger- This thing was huge! The sauce was like a mango salsa and went with it well! I didn't even think it was like a turkey patty, tasted like a normal beef patty. Yay for less fat without trying!
4- Their normal Burger- Tasted like any other gourmet burger would taste so it was up to par, no complaints except that it was huge!
5- Green Bean temppura- It was a little salty but the sauce went well with it. I probably could've done without this but I can imagine it being super tasty if I were drinking a beer.",rTKtU2cJDn3_vX3ffc7NQA,0,0,5,Y90bm_Ed3ztWrdbpwrZrug

Got there around 1:30. Place was packed. Immediately greeted by a smiling face and felt welcome from the second we walked in. She took us over to two seats at the bar. Greeted by the bartender in a timely manner, very friendly.

People and friends will ask how were the shows, how was the hotel you stayed at. Your asked if you did any sight seeing? What do you tell people about the food you had.

It's not everyday you can say you had Turducken Pot Pie, or a Wild Boar Sloppy Joe.

Carson Kitchen, a place I have seen many times on lists that name the best places to eat in Las Vegas. Therefore it was on my person top ten lists of places to try here in Las Vegas.

Service was awesome. We arrived 5-10 prior to opening at 11:30 on a Thursday morning. We were invited to sit in the patio area on the other side of the restaraunt. The atmosphere there was delightful!

Once seated, we were handed menus, and out waitress was awesome about going over the menu.I must say, of all places in Vegas that I have eaten, this one has the most intriguing menu. 

My wife opted for the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe served with tator tots. That was my original choice, but since the wife picked it I went with the Turducken Pot Pie. We also decided to share an order of the Bacon Jam.

We took bites from each others meals, which is something we never do. But then again when is the last time we had either Wild Boar Sloppy Joes or Turducken Pot Pies? N-E-V-E-R!
 
Bottom line everything was delicious. As we left, I asked my wife how she liked everything? She replied ""It was great, but how do you find these places??""

It's a food running, kitchen execution issue. We were sitting at the bar where we could openly see everything that was happening in the kitchen. My friend ordered sliders with fries and I ordered Mac n Cheese. 

Usually at a sit down restaurants where you're paying over $10 a plate, the food comes more or less at around the same time. The sliders came first. Waited 5 minutes, then the server came to ask how everything was. IThis was strange since they could see that I hadn't gotten my dish yet.  After a little while, Mac n Cheese materialized on the pass, but no one was around to run the food to the table. The Sous chef hit the bell to call for a runner, but no one came. It didn't seem like it was a big priority that no one was running the dish that they had just taken the time to create. There's nothing more frustrating to see your food prepared and ready to be served, but no one is around to bring it to you. And it wasn't that anyone was slacking, everyone was actually busy at tables. 

I think the food sat there for a good 3-4 minutes before a Manager came by. The Manager ran the food to us, put the Mac and Cheese down on the other side of my friend from where I was sitting. Obviously the plate was for me but even so.. This problem can be avoided with a simple seat number system when the server takes the order.

Just some constructive criticism. I hope they rethink this side of the service and staff some runners or serving assistants and when I'm back again sometime, I hope to have an above and beyond experience.",dfgPj43FVRnKIfxjLclqTQ,8,9,3,UX_VPkakR2N_4rHayCiXLA

Everyone will enjoy Carson's, even the pickiest of picky eaters. Comfort food done right. The restaurant seems to always busy, so make a reservation if you're coming with a large party. 
Items ordered:

-Rainbow Cauliflower:
Garlic and citrus flavors. This dish is probably the only one that my friend and I agreed on not re ordering the next time. It was not bad...just nothing special. You can easily re create this at home.

-Gyro Tacos:
So simple yet so delicious. The meat was tender and full of flavor. 

-Chicken Skins:
Crunchy chip like deliciousness served with honey. The snacking appetizer... I would definitely order this again.

-Mac n Cheese:
My favorite dish at Carson's!! Seasoned with truffle oil topped off with bread crumbs. 

-Short Rib Sliders:
Good but not great. The sauce is really sweet which is fine if the meat wasn't so dry.

The server told us that everything comes comes out when ready and we should plan to share as it does.  I thought this odd but by then we were committed. It was her cauliflower, her fish, her husband's sandwich and some time later my turkey burger. I watched them eat most of their food and then they got to watch me eat mine (we did share some, but we wanted what we wanted).  So, I don't know if this is the general practice there or we just look like a bunch of schmucks but Carson's, your kitchen really ought to figure out how to time it so food is ready together.

A two story location-downstairs indoor dining with a bar and outdoor balcony seating upstairs. The staff was super welcoming and Andrew the bartender was awesome! He made us feel right at home with good conversation and quick service. We went with appetizers: crispy chicken skins with honey and veal meatballs. As a main course we chose the black rice with oxtail risotto. The skins were like potato chips-crisp and slightly salty. The veal meatballs were juicy and bite size. Easy eating and the sauce they pair with was enough to make me just slurp it out of the bowl. But please...I really just want to talk about the Risotto. All I can say is FOODGASM! It was an amazing fusion of meaty, cheesy, juicy and creamy goodness. That's it. Just try it. I've dreamt about this for days now. The serving is generous and can be shared between 2-3 people along with additional protein to balance it out. 

We snagged both of their dessert options. They have a decadent bread pudding-fluffy and rich and also...a brownie with brown butter bacon ice cream and a strip of caramelized bacon. Yes. I said it. Sugar and bacon and ice cream and chocolate. Talk about a trip to heart attack town. It's worth it.

Don't believe the hype I had pineapple vodka which was barely any vodka whatsoever and that's OK if the food is good the mac & cheese is decent but nothing we ate was really worth raving about. The chicken skins were very tasty and it's a novel concept I've seen nowhere else, literally just chicken skins deep fried. We had the grilled cheese with short rib it was unremarkable .. the tots were good. The tacos were boring and the devil eggs were about on par with something you'd expect a friend to bring to a Christmas party when they're making them for the first time.

3873234,2015-01-24,3,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Date dined: 01/15/15

After actually finding Kerry Simon's downtown restaurant we had a great lunch.  Even though Carson Kitchen has a 6th street address, the door is actually located on Carson Street two doors down from O Face Donuts, in the Carson Building.  The smallish space has a lot of charm and warmth and seems to encourage a social dining experience.  There are only a few 4-top tables, but there's a huge butcher block topped bar with seating on both sides, as well as another that overlooks the open kitchen.  The brick walls and wood beams add to the sense of warmth in the space.

Today we tried the Tempura Green Beans with pepper jelly cream cheese and the Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip with a red wine demi glace.

The Tempura batter was fantastic.  Light and crispy, not greasy at all, and the seasoning was perfect.  The word ""jelly"" does not sound appealing to me when thinking about a Tempura Dip, but it was Awesome! and the consistency was more of a cream than a jelly.

The NY Strip was slices of Heaven!  Since we did family style I would definitely order a double batch of this next time.  The crust on the steak with the warm red center was perfect and the rich flavor was fantastic.  But the wine demi was a star.  I kept dipping my pieces in the ever dwindling pool until it was gone.

Seating was quick and the Service was good.  We will definitely be back.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,4,4,4,yU0gRoEJzW6s63Vuz-fKZA
3877245,2015-05-09,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I've lived in Vegas for almost a year now and visitors always ask me what my favorite place is. I think I've found it. The food at Carson Kitchen is amazing. The menu is simplistic, but creatively hatched. There wasn't anything that we ordered that I didn't like. Many plates are perfect for sharing, which is encouraged.

Of the social plates, there is a trio of must-tries. If you like chicharrónes, the crispy chicken skins are highly recommended. Dipped in smoked honey, these tasty snacks were wildly addictive. The gyro tacos (3) were well-balanced and liked by all. My personal favorite was the bacon jam. The jam was topped with baked brie and spread on a toasted baguette. The flavors were a punch in the mouth: sweet, salty, smoky, and creamy. 

For mains, we shared the cocoa-espresso NY strip steak and the two flatbreads with a side of fingerling potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare with a tasty red wine demi glaze. It was better than a lot of the steakhouses in Vegas. 

We were already satisfied, but got a dessert to share anyway. The glazed donut bread pudding is one of the best and most unique bread puddings I've tried in a while. Served with three rum caramel and vanilla creme anglaise, it was the perfect ending to a damn good meal. It was light on top and the bottom had a toasted crust that's reminiscent of a glazed donut. The service was awesome, and the ambiance was hip, something that you don't find very much of in this city.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,5,2,5,qwjEUNIMuIDbjyjDCB_E6Q
3882103,2016-01-22,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,Great joint in east Fremont without catching the tourist traps on the strip. You get that local neighborhood feel and the food is damn good. The gyro tacos were my ultimate fav. The shrimp were also damn tasty. I think they lost a point on the shepherds 3.14 dish. The gnocchi were soft pillows that melted in your mouth among the shredded pieces of lamb but the sausage had a distinct taste that I didn't care for and the au jus lacked flavor. The edamame was a nice twist of the original but didn't increase the flavor of the dish. Everything else was 5 star worthy!,H7H0ht0bNzt1MWbyY8HXfg,1,1,4,qvw7wv74QR8N0wjWFRh_rQ

3895251,2015-11-24,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Stopped here for Kung after a long day of driving to Vegas through Arizona. Let me just preface this by saying I love Boursin cheese, all my friends make fun of me for how much I love it, and I've never seen it on a menu before.

First, the ambiance was pretty good. They had an open kitchen and we sat at the bar, so we could actually watch the chefs as they cooked the food. The chefs were also friendly, so all around a cool experience

Next, the food was pretty good! I wished it was better given that it had Boursin, but it didn't blow my mind. The crispy chicken skins were good, but be warned they felt like a heart attack waiting to happen. The butter burger was the one with Boursin in it. It came with tater tots which were just normal, and the burger was alright. The best thing we got was probably the Mac and cheese!

Roman was our server and he was great! Whatever questions we asked about the menu or any unusual requests we made (truffle ketchup), he delivered. In fact, everyone working here was great.

We were promptly seated upstairs and given an amazing background on the restaurant and all of the must order items. I could tell he was a guy who knew what he was talking about so we handed back the menus and had him bring whatever he recommended we try.

Stopped by here on a Friday to eat lunch before Life is Beautiful festival. Other places were really crowded, but we only had to wait about 10 minutes here to get seated. We got to sit on their upstairs patio which was lovely. It was a great day to sit outside. We ordered the Secret Sunday Chicken sandwich, Bacon Jam with Baked Brie, and Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto. 
My favorite was definitely the chicken sandwich!! The chicken was perfectly fried and tender, and the sauce/aioli they put was so good. Everything went so well together. I also really loved the tater tots they came with. The bacon jam was really good! It was my first time trying anything like that before and it did not disappoint. It really reminded me of cha siu bao (bbq pork buns at dimsum) because of the sweetness combined with the pork! I really liked the flavor of the risotto, but I felt that the texture was a bit hard for a risotto. I expected it to be more creamy and the rice to be softer. It's probably because they didn't use arborio which is the typical rice that is used in risotto, so I should've expected it. I did think that the water tasted kinda weird (maybe it's just LV water?) but it wasn't a huge deal. Our waitress was super sweet and overall a great server.

3952077,2015-11-13,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I LOVE CARSON KITCHEN! I feel anyone who enjoys delicious comfort food will enjoy coming here. However, the place is usually always packed. I recommend trying to make reservations, but they often don't take them. They will take your name down, but there are no guarantees over the phone. The place is also not the big so there is limited seating. You may have to sit at the bar if there are not any tables open. During the summers, you can enjoy the food and a drinks outside. 

Service: Although the restaurant is busy, the service is still great. They try their hardest to be attentive to everyone. 

Ambiance: Great place for you to hangout with friends and family! Come in to grab a quick bite to eat and then walk out to explore Downtown. You are pretty close to the nightclubs and bars. It is a bit loud, so be prepared to yell a bit as you talk to your peers. 

Food: We can here mainly to grab a drink, but we did get two appetizers: The Crispy Chicken Skins w/ Smoked Honey and the ""Devil's Eggs"". Both were great. The Chicken skins is probably the best I have ever had and goes well with the honey. It is agreat sweet/salty combination. The Devil's eggs were also delicious as well. 

Drinks: I got the moscow mule. It was made perfectly and served in the ideal copper cups. It was mixed well so it was very tasty. I would recommend getting the mule here. 

Price: I would say it is decently priced with many of the menu items are tapas size. I would bring at least $40 bucks to cover food/drinks.

I also read the many 5 star yelp reviews and knew as soon as we walked into this eclectic restaurant, it was going to be a fun experience!

They had a 30 minute wait, but we passed the time on their back outdoor patio with wine and shared the warm of the unique fireplace radiating heat, as it was a bit chilly outside.

The hostess sat us in less than 30 minutes at a bar high level communal table! It turned out to be great as we sat next to a trio of really fun ladies from California! They had already ordered and gave us tastes of several of their food selections to help us make up our minds what to order!

We started with the tempura green beans with red pepper cream cheese dip - boy was that yummy!
JF had their jerk turkey burger that came with crunchy tater tots (I ate half of them)!

I ordered the red and golden beet salad with grapes & mini goat cheese balls rolled with pistachios and it was delicious too!

We also tasted the roasted cauliflower with a lemony flavor and the truffle Mac & Cheese our communal table companions readily shared with us! They were both incredible! Another couple at our communal table were raving about the Brie and bacon jam they slathered on toasts!

The bartender and our server were both very friendly and helped us with recommendations too.

I even had a second glass of Pinot Noir, which for those who know me, rarely happens!

I can't wait to go back and try more food items!

Our server told us a few items were coming off the menu and were being replaced with new menu items. I love a restaurant who freshens their menu to reflect the seasonality of fresh produce and offers what is best in meats, poultry and seafood too!

I was early for our lunch and had the chance to chat with Chef Harwell. He's a very personable fellow with a passion for putting a Southern twist to his foods to represent his roots. That was evident as our lunch proceeded. Coming out in nicely spaced courses, we spent the next hour and a half enjoying the offerings he had chosen for us. 

We started with two appetizers, a summer salad of watermelon and feta cheese with cucumber and topped with a white balsamic dressing. The other dish was veal meatballs in a sherry foie gras cream and some peas. The foie gras came through in the cream sauce quite nicely. The watermelon salad was good. 

Next came an order of tempura green beans with red pepper jelly cream cheese and cheddar crab fondue with lavash, two rolls, and some sliced, toasted bread for sloshing the crab on. The green beans are absolutely addictive. I dare you to eat just one. You won't be able to but that's a good thing. The one thing that surprised me with this dish was the almost sweetness of the red pepper jelly cream cheese. I expected some red pepper zing, but instead was surprised by the sweetness of the jelly and cream cheese. The red pepper taste was missing although you could see flecks of red pepper in the cream cheese. Regardless, this is a must order dish to order, and it's a dish meant to be shared. The cheddar crab fondue was excellent. A good flavor of cheddar that did not overwhelm the crab. 

Next up were a strawberry salad and two sandwiches. The salad was mixed spring greens with thin slices of manchego cheese and candied pecans. The sandwiches were the Jerk turkey burger and the pork belly Cuban. The turkey burger was topped with mango chutney slaw and was served with a side of tater tots. The burger had a bit of zing from the jerk spice. The Cuban had tasso ham, manchego cheese, and also came with tots. Both sandwiches were good. It's the best Cuban sandwich I've had in Las Vegas but the right bread is needed to make it a stellar sandwich.

Next up was a trio of scallops, mac and cheese, and New York strip steak. The scallops had a mango habanero beurre blanc and were topped with small cubes of mango. I hoped for some zing here when I heard habanero, and while there is a bit of flavor from the habanero, it's not enough to overwhelm the delicate scallops which were cooked perfectly. For my taste, I would have liked more habanero but this would be best for most people. The New York strip steak was rubbed with a cocoa espresso mixture and had a red wine demi-glacé. The steak was perfectly done and was very good. I took the end slice and got the full rub flavor--and it was still medium rare. Last, we had the mac and cheese which the menu is a secret. Having worked in a public school for 33 years, this is the way mac and cheese should be. Creamy, cheesy, tasty! Chef Harwell told us this was the first recipe he ever developed. Wow! A grand slam on your first try!

It was now time for dessert. We got the bourbon fudge brownie with brown butter bacon ice cream and two pieces of candied bacon. The other dessert was Banoffee Pie. Both were excellent. There is probably less than 1/2 teaspoon of flour in the whole brownie. It's rich, dark chocolate with not much of a bourbon flavor but it is good. The ice cream was a perfect accompaniment. The Banoffee pie was the winner of the two. The bananas and cream with crumbs in a jar were a perfect combination. With the Banoffee were two chocolate biscotti.

During lunch, Chef Harwell explained each of the dishes and he was a most genial host. Service was excellent. My iced tea was refilled without asking and at one time, a new glass was brought because the server felt my tea had been watered down too much by the melted ice. Clean plates and cutlery were given for each course.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,7,5,iCr672u8zbW8czVTXH-5mA

Let me start by saying the food can come quite quickly so you should do ""serial ordering"" and order one plate at a time.  We started with the deviled eggs and they just melted in my mouth.  You only get 4 of them and let me say I'm not sure you should share these as I wanted to eat them all.  The next course was the gyro tacos and they were tasty but a bit greasy and heavy following the deviled eggs.  We should have got the bacon jam as the second course.  Next we had to try the fried chicken skins and they were great, almost like eating pork rinds.  Lastly the mac and cheese was some of the best I've ever eaten... now I was full.

We followed with a margarita straight up in a martini glass and it was one of the best I've ever had, and I've had quite a few of them.  The mixologist was great guy and we enjoyed the atmosphere and ambiance of sitting at the bar.  You can easily sit here and eat and drink for a couple of hours; as we did.  This is quite small place and coming in from the bright sun and heat this is a relaxing place to hang out before sundown before going over to Fremont Experience a block away.

This place is now on my must go list when coming to Las Vegas.",kdi1S-3EZLboXjnFYMbKpw,1,0,5,A5GC3was1Nal4yWRg9lY6A

Must haves:  the crispy chicken skin and the bacon jam.  I didn't know bacon tasted that good when mixed with jam, just the perfect mix of sweet and salty.  The crispy chicken skin was just heavenly when dipped in honey.  We also ordered pig and fig flatbread which was not quite as life altering as the other two.  It wasn't bad, but after the tasting the appetizers, I was expecting more and this was a tad disappointing.

My girlfriend and I walked through the door and immediately was looked up and down by the hostess and she simply said ""you guys can sit at the community table or, the bar"" we didn't get asked or given the option of a table. We chose the bar because sitting at a random table with other people was not too romantic, nor did I want to meet anyone new that day. At the bar we were never greeted or asked what we would like to drink. The bartender finally walked over 8 steps to us and handed us a menu and walked off, I had to ask someone else that worked there if we could at least get a water. 

We were told by the female bartender that everything that is cooked/made to order and meant to share. She also said the food is brought out as it is ready and would not come out at the same time... NOT A PROBLEM! We ordered the Ox tail risotto and a burger. The risotto came out within 10 minutes of us ordering it. Not impressed with the taste and it seemed like it was cooked in a crock pot earlier that morning and NOT MADE TO ORDER. My burger however, is a whole other story. We were done with the risotto within 20+ minutes and still no burger! I asked the bartender if the burger was coming out soon and she said she would go check. She came back and said nothing to us about the burger eta. Then the cook came out and from 15 feet away and within earshot of the whole bar and said ""10 minutes on the burger"" and the bartender turned to us and said ""it will be right out"". Now I've cooked burgers over 1000+ times in my life and if I cooked a burger for 30+ minutes it would come out a hockey puck. 

I had enough and stood up and walked out. My girlfriend and I never got an apology or asked if there was something they could do. Horrible service, food sucked (I unfortunately never got to take a bite outta the burger), we will NEVER recommend that horrible place!",-n2_-g_OOYh5HWVeGi-gjw,2,1,1,PY58cbiZUE8c8qm4mXACLA

Everything about this place was wonderful. The atmosphere is fantastic, the seats are comfortable, the customer service is top notch... and the food literally brought tears to my eyes.

My husband and I travel a lot and we don't tend to go to the same place more than once on a trip... but after our first experience here we just had to come back! The 2nd night was just as good as the first. The waitress remembered us and made us feel like regulars - which is rare when you are from out of town.

We started with the bacon jelly with brie.  Very tasty, rich and I could have stopped here.  BUT no, we then continued with some burnt ends, which were very tasty, great sauce, not quite smokey like I prefer,  but very good.

We got the cod, which is well caramelized with a sweet citrus flavor and a bit of heat.  Sauce was a but thicker and sweeter than I typically prefer, but as I said binge night and it was great.  

I would definitely come back for the jerk, Turkey burger with tater tots. Big, juicy burger (made with applesauce) with some powerful, complex,  tasty spices.  

Oh, yes, very nice salad, BLTA.  Pretty savory here with big thick chunks of bacon, avocado and romaine.  

Great smaller place.  Great service.  Small plates fun for sharing.

So here is what happen, after waiting more then an hour for our table were ed, pretty stoked to be seated and enjoyed our waiters. After a min or two my wife noticed a huge amount of hair in her water, literally a huge amount of it almost looked like a dreadlock I mean you could have made a freaking carpet out of the amount of hair in her glass. So naturally I told our waitress, she directly got the manager. The manager didn't even really try to apologize his words exact words were, ""I'll get you guys a desert or something"" the thing he gave us was the cheapest and most greasiest appetizer on the menu (fried chicken skin). You would think, after that happened a manager would try to make sure we had a good evening and would check on us frequently, but no (they even charged us $1 for the extra bread). When we paid he was no where to be found. We were charged the full amount! 
To be honest this is the first review I have ever written here and this is only because I am freaking mad at this place and the so called manager person. We saw him on the street when we walked out and instead of saying anything he looked on the ground and walked pass us and pretended he didn't know us.

We (4of us)were seated at the eating bar downstairs.  Good seating since it was facing the kitchen so was fun watching the chefs at work.  The staff was great and our server was attentive.  He recommended eating  tapas style; the four of us sharing plates.  Sitting at the bar made that pretty difficult.

We first ordered burnt ends, fried chicken skin and tempura green beans. Unfortunately none lived up to expectation.  The burnt ends were 90% fried fat.  None of us got much meat to speak of.  I'm from barbecue country and know what burnt ends are.  These weren't it.

The chicken  skin was cooked exactly as I expected but way too salty.   The tempura green beans had no tempura batter on them. Some of the beans had a thin layer of batter on them.  They were also a bit greasy.  It was as if the grease was not hot enough when they were cooked.  That being said, the overall texture of the beans was quite good.  Not too under done, not too over done.

To end the meal, we got watermelon salad, mac and cheese, asparagus salad and cauliflower.  All were good.  The two salads were fantastic.

Be prepared to say ""what did you say"" a lot.  Very noisy.   I think sitting on the deck upstairs to eat would probably have made the dinner more enjoyable.

I'm not one of these bacon-crazed people, but I saw that the bacon jam was the hot item, so we had to order it. Your reviews did not steer us wrong! It was awesome! Overall, we enjoyed all the food and the server delivered with excellent cocktail recommendations.

From the start, we are greeted cheerfully by the hostess, and quickly sat at the bar with a kitchen view. I don't know about you, but I love to cook and watching them prep is relaxing to me. Our wait staff took our drink orders promptly, and served our drinks quickly as well. 

Our first item was called Crispy Chicken skins with smoked honey. One word for this dish: phenomenal. My friend and I were gobbling up this dish when our second food arrived. It's called Barbecue Burnt End Tri tips. I was still on the skins when my best friend Will told me I have to try the second dish. So I did. I thought the skins were great, but compared to the tri tips, it paled in comparison. The tri tips were just excellent. The second dish were getting murdered like there was no tomorrow. That's when our third dish came, and it was called Bacon Jam with Brie. Now, I've tried other bacon jams, and the mix was either too much bacon (even though there's no such thing as too much bacon), or too much jam. The Bacon Jam at Carson Kitchen are in perfect harmony. The split between the two are perfect. Matched with baked brie elevates the flavor even more.

Now, the food were excellent but it wasn't just about the food. The staff were on top of their game as well. The wait staff and management were checking in on us, but not in an annoying kinda way. They checked on us in opportune time, not when we are midbite on our food. Hahaha! 

The greatest kudos goes to the Wait staff especially Chef Brandon. Here's the thing, most kitchen staff are busy with prep work and cooking. Even though the kitchen was busy, they still took time out to interact with us, and that really made the experience great.  Chef Brandon, you can tell he's busy but he still takes time to talk to us. Now, even though he's busy and talking to us, his priority was still cooking the entrees so all the other customers weren't waiting long times for their orders. Now, that's service. 

The only regret that I have is that we were only there for a small amount of time and only got to experience the appetizers. If the appetizers were that great, I can NOT wait to try the entrees. 

I would DEFINITELY come back for the appetizers, and would DEFINITELY take my time and experience their entrees. I definitely recommend Carson Kitchen to everyone. That includes family, friends, and people I don't know. It is THAT great.",aLsqrrHPvfJcLIgmf72rfA,0,0,5,coxpYF1C_a3OrB3iCcnKTQ

I have been lucky on each of my visits to be seated at the chef's 'table' (really more of a counter), where I have had a full view of the kitchen and been able to interact with the fun and entertaining staff. 

Service here has always been on point for me... I can't recall the name of the adorable, rockabilly-ish blonde that has been my waitress on every visit, but I adore her. She fits right in with the ""rock and roll hipster"" vibe Carson Kitchen has going on.

Literally EVERY item I have had here I would order again... but I do have some favorites:

Bacon Jam: Everything I could have wanted and then some. Salty, sweet, creamy AND crunchy... A culinary grand slam.
Tempura Green Beans: I have been craving the pepper jelly cream cheese served with the tempura green beans for weeks now. It is the perfect compliment to the addictive green beans.
The Secret Sunday Chicken Sandwich: Simple yet perfectly done... Juicy chicken, aioli with just a slight kick, delicious bun.

Prices are very fair for the caliber of the food being served up. Carson Kitchen is a must when dining downtown in my opinion.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,4,6,5,X0bNFsgnOyeFmrvE5amjEQ
4054579,2014-06-23,10,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Carson Kitchen....

Here are the bullet points....

-New Downtown bar and restaurant
-Open Kitchen 
-Small, cramped, and loud.  NOTE:  there's an upstairs patio soon to be open
-Great service with a big staff
-Reservations if your party is 6 or more
-Located next door to O Face Doughnuts
-Apps:  Portions are small and pricey
-The Food:  Portions are small and priced about right. 

The gf and I came here on Friday night just about a week after they opened.  I thought that the service was great.  Our server gave us his recommendations, was very attentive, and he even gave us a quick tour.  As for the food, I enjoyed half of what I had.  I ordered their Wellington Empanada as an app and their Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak as an entree.  The empanada was a little too greasy and pricey at $10 for two small pieces.  The steak cost $18 and I thought it was worth it. It was delicious, sliced, and full of flavor. My gf had their Bacon Jam as an app and their Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto.  I got a little taste and thought both were pretty good.  Again, wasn't a fan of the price of their Bacon Jam, but thought that the entree was just about right.  

Overall, don't let my 3 star review fool you.  3 stars from me means that they are just ""A-Ok"".  In other words, I don't see myself rushing back any time soon.  I do recommend other Yelpers to give them a try.
TIP:  Tip regarding their Check-In...double check your receipt. We were charged for our ""Free"" item.  They fixed the issue...just saying.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,18,11,3,VaY_SGS6ljMgg7rWemg2Xg

There was a 15 minute wait so they offered to show us to the patio in the back where we found a little oasis in the Fremont area of LV. A great fire bowl and chairs, not to mention a rooftop bar. We didn't mind the wait at all! 

After were we called to our seats were were happy to see that we could see into the open kitchen and watch the busy staff prepare beautiful plates. The manager checked on us throughout the evening knowing it was our first time to dine with them. I was very impressed when he noticed a family trying to take a photo on the patio. He ran out to the patio and took the family photo for them then back inside to greet guest. Top notch. 

The food did not disappoint at all. We decided to share a few plates so we could try out a few options. Our server suggested the chicken skins, devil's eggs, and baked brie with bacon jam. All three were spectacular. 

If you want something local, yummy, and off the beaten path take a short walk to Carson Kitchen. You will not be disappointed.",wXYZQK_dJNPl0uduTQf1tw,0,0,5,5GlXisjKmCB6wSJWkHTUrg

A little pretentious at the gate. I mean, TGIF is more welcoming.

Watermelon with Tajin with some feta-$12 LOL I mean wow. Thats a genius scam.

The Bacon Jam is waaaay over hyped. I mean can it be any more salty and burnt?

The Hamburger (I was so looking forward to this).... is not really there (Bun and toppings) Must say the meat is tender. Its just missing a little more toasted on the entire Hamburger.

4107212,2014-08-16,5,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I haven't really explored Downtown Las Vegas, but this place seemed like a rock star with the current 4.5 Yelp average and the recent glowing review by the New York Times critic. Even though I don't typically go out for American cuisine, and I haven't actually tried any of Kerry Simon's establishments, I resolved to take advantage of Michael U.'s invitation (and the pleasant company of Clint B.) to give Carson Kitchen a try.

The entrance is actually on Carson, not 6th. It's in the southwest corner of the former Carson Hotel. Parking was readily available, and it's currently $1/hr (max 2 hrs) on the street.

Carson Kitchen itself is one of those places with intentionally exposed pipes and lumber in the ceiling, wooden tables, dark but not muted colors, simple music like Sting or Aerosmith, and a not too loud volume of chatter, at least not during our lunch. Casual attire seemed to be the norm. I liked it since nothing in the atmosphere or decor really distracts you from whatever food (or liquor) you're partaking in.

As is the case whenever you're attacking a menu with Michael, our order was enormous. We were able to split things from the Social Plates section of the menu easily, but we did need a serving spoon or fork for a couple of other items. And now, the blow-by-blow commentary:

Devil's Eggs ($8): surprisingly light take on a classic. Pancetta stood out the most, couldn't taste the caviar too much, and it probably could've benefited from a little salt (to be fair, hard to judge when you only grab one of four bite-size pieces).

Crispy Chicken Skins ($6): couldn't stop eating this. Savory, chip-like crunchy skin with more than enough (smoked, apparently) honey to dip it in. I could have ordered another had our meal not run so deep.

Bacon Jam ($12): almost couldn't stop eating this one either. It's a sweet but still savory concoction with a classic complement in the form of melted brie. Michael is going to ream them for the extra bread that they gave us without asking and without mentioning that it would be any sort of extra charge. In the grand scheme, the $1.50 isn't too bad, but it makes you wonder what other stuff they might try to pull.

Gyro Tacos ($10): the ground marinated lamb is actually a little bit higher quality than what I typically get at a gyro shop, but otherwise it just feels like a tapas-ized take on the classic gyro, with tzatziki, feta, cucumber, and tomato. It's worth a try if you're a lamb and/or gyro fan, but I personally would shy away next time.

Rabbit Ragu ($12); I think this is actually my first time eating rabbit, and Elmer Fudd does now have more of my sympathy. Tasty meat, not gamy. Came with a fairly crunchy (fruit-crunchy, not chips-crunchy) spaghetti squash and grated parmesan. Was a little spicy, but even my wimpy palate tolerated it.

Wellington Empanada ($10): ground beef tenderloin, with something that I had to Google called duxelles (buttery minced mushrooms, onions, herbs). Great crunchy empanada shell, really flavorful filling, good complement of a vinegar sauce of some sort on the plate.

Sprouts & Spuds Hash ($10): probably the 3rd or 4th item I would re-order if I were to come back here. Properly cooked potatoes that have that bit of a crust but are so soft inside, with no trace of that raw potato flavor. Did not mind what I assume are baby brussels sprouts.

Wild Mushroom Flatbread ($10): mushroom was good, caramelized onions were good, mozzarella was good. The cabrales bleu cheese was nice and creamy, and not quite as sharp as other bleu varieties. Unfortunately, I couldn't really taste the cabrales in a whole bite of flatbread and had to rely on eating it separately to enjoy it.

[DESSERTS]

Not Your Father's Twinkies ($8): flavor-wise, this somehow reminds me of the sweet dumpling dessert that I had last week at an Indian place. It does not resemble Twinkies at all, by the way. The mandarin orange coulis brightens the dessert.  I was the only one at the table who liked it though.

Bourbon Fudge Brownie ($8): so heavy, so chocolatey, so yummy. The bourbon isn't too pronounced, and the bacon is something I always welcome in dessert. Eat the brown butter ice cream fast or it will melt on you. The kind of utter indulgence you expect from something called Bourbon Fudge Brownie.

Glazed Donut Bread Pudding ($8): soft bread pudding with very restrained sweetness, lovely caramel and creme anglaise. I like all the desserts, but this one might be the one with the widest appeal since it's relatively safe.

Overall, Carson Kitchen is a somewhat upscale take on American food, with commensurate increase in both quality and price. I wasn't too concerned with the bill since I figured it would be up there with how much we ordered, but a ~$45 w/ tip split was a little surprising. Then again, it's solid value for the sheer volume of menu items that we experienced. Given my usual budget, I'll have to hide for the rest of the week to absorb the hit, but it was worth it.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,7,4,4eo8DZmsVdpeYqXXjIBoRA

4114678,2017-06-10,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"During a recent trip to Las Vegas, we visited this place on recommendation of one of the foodies in our group, and it really delivered! The place isn't much to look at from the outside, but it's warm and comfortable inside. Although they have a nice beverage program, our group of about eight focused primarily on food during this visit. We primarily focused on sharing small plates, so the Social Plates section of the menu was drawn upon heavily. Here's what we had:

Crispy chicken skins - Crispy and delicious, they had a nice flavor and texture without being overly greasy. Accompanying smoked honey was an absolute knockout, and lent a bit of a ""chicken and waffles"" flavor to the dish. 

BBQ burnt ends - Tender bits of beef with a nice, slightly spicy and sweet sauce, these were a hit across the board. The side of pickles were a bit too raw (i.e. too close to cucumber) for me, but other diners loved them. 

Onion rings - An off menu delight, these substantial rounds of fresh onion were perfectly breaded and fried, nicely seasoned and served simply with ketchup. We ended up knocking off two, maybe three orders of these. 

Gyro Tacos - These were presented very close to the classic Mexico City street taco style, and the lamb was mild, making for a very nice fusion dish. Feta was properly crumbly and not overpowering, and tzaziki had a nice cucumber crunch. 

Pig in a duvet - Kind of a fancy pig in blanket, this featured an upscale and spicy chorizo on the inside, and a very nice breading wrapped around it. Spicy mustard made a great presentation as well as a good flavor contrast. 

Tempura green beans - A perfectly light, crispy tempura over fresh green beans, these were made fantastic with pepper jelly cream cheese, something I wouldn't have thought would have worked, but it did. 

Hobo stew - This was like a thick gumbo, and while it had most of the right ingredients, including shrimp and a nice andouille sausage, it fell a little flat in terms of overall flavor and experience. 

Rainbow cauliflower - Finished fairly simply with garlic and lemon juice, this dish was tasty, but could have been better with more browning on the florets. The texture was a little mushy for my taste, but flavorwise, it was very nice. 

Finally, we decided that something sweet was in order, and since we had a good sized party, we just went with one of each of the three offerings:

Bourbon fudge brownie - Deep, rich chocolate flavor with a definite bourbon note, combined with a tender, almost creamy texture made this one very popular at the table, but the brownie wasn't even the best part. The stunning brown butter bacon ice cream might have been one of the best ice creams I've ever tasted, anywhere. Simply fantastic. 

Honey cheesecake - Served with a strawberry liqueur coulis as well as slices of dried strawberry, this was an above average cheesecake with a nice shortbread crust. It was also pretty sizable, so be prepared to share if you get this one.  

Glazed donut bread pudding - Saving the best for last, the bread pudding lovers among us (myself included) simply could not get enough of this absolutely amazing dish. The rum caramel sauce and vanilla creme anglaise were delicious but potent, and worked better when applied sparingly, but the pudding itself was soft, just the right amount of sweet, and perfectly warm, with nice browning on the outside and a creamy inside. If you only get one dessert, this is probably the one to get. Well, then there's that ice cream from the other one...

Bottom line: This place was absolutely awesome, and is a very fitting venue to be reviewed for this, my 1,000th review on Yelp. Yes, it's way off the beaten path, but if you love good food, this should be a planned destination if you're in Vegas. Incredibly, even the price was right, with all of the above coming out to only a bit over $30 per person. Just, come here and try it!",2-qk8ijAEjYszDZXwRmbQA,6,3,5,y9jkKh7UTtcn16BKGf-BZw

My girlfriend and I have been to this place approximately 8 times since moving to Las Vegas last year. There's a reason that we keep coming back, it's friggin fantastic!

Heres the skinny: Carson Kitchen is a small, hip, yet unassuming, spot in Downtown Las Vegas that caters to nouveau foodie crowd. The space is tight, the ambiance is lively, and the food is killer.

We've experienced three different menu changes since we've been coming here (CK alters their menu seasonally in order to incorporate new recipes which reflect the time of year) and we have yet to be disappointed. Most items on the menu are designed to be shared and the best strategy for a meal here is to come with people who are comfortable sharing and order a bunch of different dishes to taste.

Some of the dishes that we keep coming back to are: Bacon Jam ('nuff said, just get it), Tempura Green Beans (delicious pepper-cream cheese dipping sauce), The espresso-cocoa rubbed Strip Steak (better than steaks that i've had at 5-star dedicated steak restaurants), Crispy Chicken Skins (YOLO), the shockingly good Mac & Cheese (great as a side with entrees), and the Black Rice Oxtail Risotto (a rich and creamy, albeit slightly al dente version that always impresses). 

Oh god I almost forgot the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding dessert... That is the goods right there. The things I would do for that Bread Pudding might get me blocked from Yelp if I were to go into detail...

The servers are all welcoming, friendly, informative, and above all on top of their game. Any issues are remedied before they can become a real problem, drinks are always filled, and they are more than happy to give recommendations and answer questions. 

I've taken every Vegas visitor that we've had in town to the Carson Kitchen and each and every time it is a highlight of their trip and we hear about it their love for this place for weeks afterwards.

Our experience started with a snobby host who balked at our request to sit up on the patio roof. Our waitress (who in all honesty seemed to be having a rough night) was crass, overly familiar, and inattentive. The food was almost inedibly over-seasoned, and for our $100 tab, the only saving grace was the booze. 

We tried the crispy green-beans (good), the chicken skins (awful. so over-seasoned and chewy), the steak (cooked okay but drowning in what tasted like soy sauce), and the cauliflower (inedible. seriously the lemon was so strong it burned).

My boyfriend made the observation that this place really wants to do fine, innovative dining, but had absolutely no idea how to go about it. Our grumpy waitress made a few off-hand comments about ""trouble in the kitchen"" and how this place ""sucks"", so perhaps our experience was the result of a truly awful night.

4146794,2014-06-19,3,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"A cautiously optimistic 3 stars, since CK has only been open a week and we only tried four dishes; but there is much to be excited about here. The space itself is rather small, with communal/bar seating taking up the majority. Does anyone actually like communal dining? Its a hip concept on paper, but no thanks to being seated across from the group of six dudes making their slow, loud, boozy departure. I take it more space will be opening up in the courtyard and ceiling patio eventually? Here's hoping. The old hotel has some great little nooks and crannies, worthy of becoming a go-to late-night hangout.  

From greeting through to bill payment, service was friendly and attentive. Our server (Vicky I think?) offered just the right mix of good cheer without being cloying. The only little hiccup was a lengthy wait for our last dish, maybe ten or so minutes, but we didn't feel neglected and weren't in a rush so no harm done. In general, the atmosphere was festive and inviting. Great energy. 

Our dishes were 1. Spuds/Sprouts Hash; 2. Veal Meatballs; 3. Wellington Empanadas; and 4. Chicken Thighs with Chimichurri. The first dish was far and away the least successful of the group, and was actually quite disappointing. In flavor, texture and even color everything was monochromatic. The ""spuds"" weren't fully cooked. The dish was heavy, brown, and muddled. The meatballs came next, and were a revelation. They were tender and moist with a rich, dark outer crust, and the foie/sherry cream sauce was divine; especially the bright notes of sherry, which cuts through and elevates the otherwise heavy combination. Not sure how necessary the 9 stray peas are though. Third came the empanadas, with a gorgeous buttery/flakey crust and moist and tender filling. The accompanying ""gravy"" seemed to be made from a demi-glace, as it was layered with all kinds of delightful ""colors""; problem was it was face-scrunchingly salty. Rarely is over-salting an issue in restaurants, but this was put-down-your fork salty. Finally came the chicken thighs, which I was overjoyed to see on the menu. Thighs are the best and most tragically ignored part of the bird, and CK knows this and gets it right. Boneless and slightly flattened, they are the perfect combination of moist and juicy meat with cracklingly crunchy skin. Just like God intended. The Chimichurri is a brilliant accompaniment, full of brightness and acidity, but once again it was over-salted. The sauce man needs to take it down a few notches. The chimi wasn't as excessive as the ""gravy"" but it was still distracting. Nevertheless, I loved the thighs. The juicy-crispy combo reminded me of my favorite dish at Raku, ""juicy deep fried chicken""--so bravo and thanks, CK! 

I live down the street and am thrilled to have CK in the neighborhood. I'll be back soon to further explore the menu and enjoy the historic space.",8D4jmSsMutGwnphZ1BktOg,4,2,3,8SBUW0p55nqEPnc4b4bxbA

We sat on the rooftop deck and although it was cold outside the heat lamps kept us warm.  We got our drinks right away and the waitress told us about how the food is group food and meant to be shared.  We loved this.  We got the Jalapeno poppers, potatoes and the steak.  Every Bit was incredible, and the portions were perfect for the price and for sharing.  I've been into Ciders a lot this year and tried the berry Cider they had which was very good but I think she liked it a lot more.

We were told dishes come when they are ready but three of us were finished with our meal when the flatbread came out for one in our party.

I am going to be honest: best mac n cheese that I have ever eaten, perfect cheese melted together that had the perfect flavor bite that just melted in my mouth... well I guess technically in the pot, but lets not nit pick.

Bacon jam... yes.

Bison burgers... yes.

I saw the prices and I said I am not sure about this... i mean seriously 12$ for mac n cheese. Oh my gosh though, for the price absolutely worth it.

4323745,2017-10-19,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I've gotten takeout from Carson Kitchen while driving through Vegas from Utah to LA, and I was pleased with what I got. Following Yelp's recommendations (of course), I got:

- Bacon Jam: 3 stars. Don't get me wrong; the jam itself is amazing. A great combination of balsamic reduction and smokey bacon flavor. The texture is great and the combination with the baked brie is wonderful. Unfortunately, the ""toasted baguette"" made it difficult to enjoy the jam and cheese. The slices were so dry and hard that it made chewing a chore. If I were to eat here again (and assuming they offer fresh bread at the table), I would eat it with the fresh bread instead.

- Gyro Tacos: 5 stars. I am a gyros fan. Big-time. Lamb is my preferred meat, and if you roast it over a spit, you are my favorite. I loved the idea of sticking the lamb, tzatziki, and toppings on a corn tortilla. Delicious combination; I highly recommend it.

- Glazed Donut Bread Pudding: 4 stars. I love donuts and I love bread pudding, but I remember this being a bit dry for my taste in spite of the three rum caramel and vanilla creme anglaise they gave me on the side. I expect that I would have preferred it in-house, where they pour the caramel and creme anglaise over the warm bread pudding and impart more moisture. I, however, ate it dipping-style in the car.

Update: I appreciated a quick response by restaurant owner to learn more about the situation and try to make it right.

At  arrival we weren't greeted with a warm welcome. We were seated at a high top that seats about 6-10 people and requested to sit in a lower table. The place was very empty and the host sat us at a vertical two top. When me and my boyfriend requested to sit next to each other at a four top, she mentioned to us she wouldn't be able to seat us there because if there was a large party they would need the table. Take in mind this place was empty. When we sat at the two top, my boyfriend moved along the side and the server rudely told my my boyfriend he couldn't sit next to me!

We came with empty stomachs on a Monday afternoon around 4-5 on Labor Day to try the place we have seen so many reviews about. We were seated right away and were attended to promptly. Service was good but the portions were very small compared to the price we paid and some of the stuff was a bit salty but the flavor was good. 

We ordered:

Tempura Green Beans: This was the absolute surprise of the day. Tempura green beans are exactly how they sound but the pepper jelly cream cheese they served it with was so good!. The creaminess of the cheese with the sweetness of the pepper jelly complimented the mild flavor of the green beans. Although a bit oily for me, it was nevertheless, my favorite dish. Good portion

Cocoa- Expresso crusted Steak- It was very salty in my opinion. The crust itself was very salty on the end pieces but for the middle slices, it worked well. The meat was good. I would have preferred it a bit more rare but it was good the way they served it. 

Rabbit Ragu- This was very good. The rabbit was cooked well with crunchy pieces of pancetta? or was it rabbit? Either way, the sauce worked well with the meat and complimented the spaghetti squash. Portion was super small in my opinion for the $12? $14 dollars I paid. If i really crave it, i would order it again but I think I'll opt for something else next time. 

Hawaiian Flat Bread- Flatbread served with spiced rum pineapple and ham, sprinkled with chives. It was alright. The pineapple was delicious. It was a very bold and sweet flavor. The ham however, was salty and overpowered the pineapple which was a shame. Also a bit pricey but it's Vegas so I can't say anything there. 

Overall it was a good experience. Good food although a bit salty and great customer service. Will be back to try other food on the menu!",7KCa75Q0A6WITkeLiLF5mg,0,0,4,_eM188SNoPPpVu61HcLpvA

The drinks to start were very good and the drink menu had some unique options. The food menu offers small plates as well as entrees. We opted to order a variety of food items and share. The waiter let us know that food comes out as it is prepared so sharing is really the best way to go.

The Gyro Tacos were very good. We almost asked for a second order of these. The meat was well seasoned and the pita was both soft and crispy perfection. The Devil's Eggs were delicious. The Baked Mac & Cheese was cheesy and had a nice truffle flavor without being overwhelming to the dish. The serving looked like it was on the smaller side, but was oddly filling.

He even took some time to chat with us. Watching the three chefs work together was enough to keep me in my seat all night. Talk about a well-oiled machine! 

Our food was pretty good, but the theme was that it was all a little spicy (which is usually not an issue for me). Since we got to watch them make things up close and personal, we noticed either paprika or cayenne as a frequent addition, and we tasted it, too. The best thing we ate was the short rib grilled cheese, which was absolutely delicious and buttery. We also split the bacon jam (the spicy element here was in the liquid base), which came with lots of bread for dipping, but probably less brie than I was expecting. We also got the rainbow cauliflower.

They have a lovely back patio that was nice to relax on while we were waiting for a table. The staff was super pleasant, and the prices were perfectly reasonable.

The amount of seating space is minimal so plan on a wait almost anytime you go.  You may find a seat at the bar but don't count on it.  The patio out back is lovely but the summer heat doesn't make it so appealing, but the most recent time I was there...I didn't mind the heat because the set up is so ""clean"" that it didn't away from the feel of the place. 

The servers wear rock band tshirts but all Pop bands from the 60s onward....I think I remember Beastie Boys, but that's an interesting twist.  

The bill comes in some beatnik style book that people sign like its a bead and breakfast ""been here"" book. 

The food is so good but it's heart attack food.  Bacon jam and bacon ice cream which is amazing is obviously not what the healthy Vegans are ordering and it's got a Tapas style serving feel which is may in fact be a Tapas restaurant and I just don't know.

Thankfully none of the lettuce spilled out but the lid landed on the floor with the inside flooring facing. He picked it up off the floor and placed the lid on the full tub of lettuce. Not thank you, I refuse to pay $10 for a salad that has sat all day rubbing up against something that fell on the dirty ass floor. I will never return here and need to tell everyone I know to do the same.

UPDATE: they've made certain to threaten me through personal message. I'm supposed to let you all know after he put it back in the fridge, some time later the lettuce was taken to the back and water was run over it. So no worries.

I've heard about Carson Kitchen from many friends and coworkers which made it exciting when I finally decided to go. It's literally a little hole in the wall which I love, and the inside is small with a very cozy ambiance. We were seated at the corner of a large rectangular table, seats away from a couple. 

We ordered the jalapeño poppers and the deviled eggs for appetizers. The deviled eggs were great (a little on the saltier side though) with large bits of bacon on top. The jalapeño poppers were larger than I would have liked. I had to use a fork and knife but would have rather popped small bites into my mouth. It also was not as cheesy as I was hoping for. 

I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and was very disappointed. For some reason it tasted more like a taco pizza. Although there were bits of chicken, I'm almost positive there was some ground beef on there too. Strange.

My friends ordered the NY strip steak and the baked mac and cheese. They weren't impressed by the steak but enjoyed the mac and cheese. 

We had a male server who was great. Nothing to complain about the service.

I honestly won't be coming back because I wasn't impressed by the food, which was what I was really looking forward to trying. I took the pizza to go to originally bring it back to my roommate but I ended up giving it to a homeless man on Fremont St.",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,4,2,3,m12Ko2iv7v3XPpsMM7-JIw

There is no doubt the food here is good, inspired, and not your typical grub. Carson Kitchen is for a day when you feel like splurging on veal meatballs topped with foie gras cream, which I did and they were absolutely delightful. This dish is pleasant and warming, like Swedish meatballs, a dish you might imagine your Grammy serving you on a cold winter night. But the foie cream is what gives it that Carson Kitchen difference.

Crispy chicken skins and honey dipping sauce. Pretty much one of the last meals you need to eat before you die and leave this Earth. Good eats and simple eats. The portion is also good for the price.

Bison sliders offer up a meaty variation on your old beef burger sliders. These should not be missed as they have a tangy BBQ sauce that melds oh so happily with the lean bison burger. Paired up with some crispy tater tots, and you have yourself a winner.

Service was decent, some hit or miss spots here and there. But at least they were willing to split the bill between myself and my friend this time. 

Lunch time is best in my opinion, but get there early or you'll be waiting, or you may not even get to eat, depending on how long your lunch break is.

4456483,2014-12-13,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"My wife and I just tried this spot on a rare rainy Friday night here in Vegas. Because of the rain we had to sit inside, which is fairly small but well laid out. It's also mostly communal seating, which I'm not a fan of, but the tables are wide enough that you aren't shoved up in someone else's face. Unfortunately, the tables only have about 6"" of overhang and are completely solid underneath, which is a bit uncomfortable when you're over 6' tall.

The food is great and the prices are reasonable for what you get. We started with the crispy chicken skins, which were expectedly amazing. I mean, come on! All our lives we're told not to eat the skin (which we all know is the best part) because it's ""not healthy"".  Well here, they give you a whole bowl of just that with a side of smoked honey. It's fantastic. 

Then we got the Bacon Jam, which is arguably what made us want to eat here in the first place. My wife absolutely loved it, but shockingly, I wasn't overwhelmed by it for some reason. It's a sizzling cast iron plate of bacon and brie cheese, how could I not love that?!? Oh well, that's a mystery for another time.

Next we shared the Jerk Turkey Burger, which was back to amazing, for both of us this time. It's flavorful, juicy, tender and just spicy enough. The burger came with a side of spicy tater tots which were delicious also. 

Finally we shared the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding. This was decidedly mediocre for both of us. Just a big, doughy, plop of undercooked cake soaked in butter and caramel. Sounds like it would be great but it had next to no flavor. 

For drinks we both had ""Drinks With the Mrs"" which were excellent. Refreshing but just strong enough.

This is a restaurant that I had been wanting to try for a couple months but with being busy with school I hadn't. I was able to experience this restaurant with some of my gf's on First Friday. First of all, it's a cute and chic place located downtown on 6th and Carson. They only take reservations if you have a large party. When we got there at 8PM, they said it would be a 2 hour wait for a party of 3. They don't have those little gadgets that buzz when your table is ready, but they take your phone # and call you when the table is ready.

Ok, time to get to the good stuff. The food here is DELICIOUS and amazing! It's definitely set up so you can share the plates (tapas like) with your party. This evening we ordered: 
* Bacon Jam
o Bacon + Jam + Brie + Bread
o This is a must and also works as a dessert 
* Baked Mac & Cheese
o top 3 Mac & Cheese's I've had in LV
* Rainbow Cauliflower
o Has lime juice and garlic on it, the top is delicious but the bottom got really soggy and was too acidic (lime juice) 
* Young Beets Salad
o Personally not one of my favorites, (the beets tasted like they were canned) but one of my friends favs 
* and a shrimp appetizer
o AMAZING! they were prepared with tempura and had a hint of spice
As far as cocktails, my gf's had the ""get shorty!"" and enjoyed it, I had a glass of the Grenache but wouldn't really recommend their wine. 

Service was your average from the hostess to the server, the manager or supervisor was the one that was bringing out our food as soon as it was out. 

So for food 5 Stars but Service I would say 4 Stars!

I'm looking forward to going back and maybe celebrating some small milestones there!

Hope this helps!!",0SMtO3NR5F9B0fYThXF0gA,1,0,4,HvO_9RoIH1xpwCfOOBgfxQ

Apparently they get very busy and don't take reservations, so plan ahead. We got there just as they opened at 11:30am on a Sat, and our party of 6 was able to be seated right away.

We got the following:
Bacon jam ($13): highly recommend this. It comes with toasted baguette and this delicious bacon savory spread with Brie cheese. So good.
Baked Mac and cheese ($13): another sharable side. The truffle flavor wasn't as strong as in other Mac and cheeses I have had, and the serving size was a bit on the small side. It was very good with the bacon jam on top though.
Gyro tacos ($12): would probably skip this next time. They had a nice Greek flavor to them with lamb, tzatziki, and feta, but didn't wow me.

I also got the butter burger ($14), which was a pretty filling burger. I liked that they came with tator tots, which was a nice change from the usual fries.

Their desserts looked super tasty as well, but we were too full to try them. Next time!",ZPN98PI53a9P7ZWM8V0qnw,1,1,4,GXFPGRLasSXJF-vlQJ_ipg
4529987,2015-05-21,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Experience:  I have been waiting and waiting to try this place. I kept missing the nights out when my friends were going. So, here I am with about a group of 7. 

Facility:  the inside is very small, but it was a beautiful Vegas night, so we sat on the balcony.  Was quite a walk around for the elevator, but stairs are easy access. The balcony seems to have more room, but it might be because it's open air. Upstairs has some bench seating and chairs. 

Service: when I first walked in, I asked how to get to the balcony and a very nice lady (Suzanne) walked me all the way around to the elevator and up to the top. Our waiter (Roman) was friendly, attentive and accommodating. 

Food:  wow!  So, we ordered a bunch of dishes to share.  Seems like most portions are on the small side.  Here's what we had:
Gyro tacos - 4/5 - very good. Crispy ""shell"" made from pita, very good tzatziki and good lamb.
Crispy chicken skins - 5/5 - crispy, slightly spiced skins almost cooked like pork skins, and served with honey for dipping.  The perfect blend of salty/savory and sweet. 
Bacon Jam - 5/5 - the bread was perfectly toasted and the jam was sweet and delicious with a hint of bacon. Brie was kinda unnecessary, because the jam overpowers it. 
Devils eggs - 4/5 - good flavors of egg, caviar and pancetta. 
Cheddar crab fondue - 3/5 - good flavor, but almost tasted like canned crab. But I still liked it. 
Mac and cheese - 4/5 - good, cheesey, but a tad runny. 
Glazed Donut bread pudding - 3/5 - if you like sweet donut flavor - yum! Good flavors, but waaaayyyy too sweet for me. 
Bacon Ice Cream - 5/5 - the yummiest!  Ice cream with bits of bacon. 

Overall - this is now my favorite restaurant downtown.  I loved it!  The atmosphere, the service, and, of course, the food. I'll be back!!!!",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,8,5,5,y3RBiotJk1oJr1TmpvnQnA

I don't always make it to all of them based on different circumstances (size of group, activities we're doing, etc) but Carson Kitchen was one of these places and I'm trilled that we actually made it! 

My boyfriend and I got to Carson Kitchen a bit past lunch time after a night of drunken debauchery on the strip and this place really soothed our souls and put us back at peace with the world. Let me start off by saying that the service was incredible! Everyone we spoke to was very friendly, helpful and the kitchen staff got our dishes out at lightning speed! 

Lets get to the nitty gritty of Carson Kitchen though: the food. AMAZEBALLS!! Per advice of our server, we ordered several different dishes to try. Everything was delicious! We ordered the tempura green beans with pepper jelly cream cheese, the veal meatballs with sherry foie gras cream, coco expresso NY strip with red wine demi sauce, black rice oxtail risotto, mac and cheese and of course the glazed donut bread pudding for dessert.  The portions were perfect for the both of us as we devoured about 95% of all the food. Our server even brought us some extra bread to make small bites with the steak and mac and cheese, genius! My boyfriend literally had his mind blown by all of the flavors these dishes had.

Carson Kitchen, I love you. Please come to LA. Specifically Highland Park so I can walk in several times a week and fall in love with you again. In the meantime, I'll see you again in March. I'm counting down the days.",NiRIeSQD2FxDkkAXgQ8zng,2,2,5,8c9clKnrzHG9Nc6xvH0pUw
4541993,2018-04-22,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"A friend and colleague brought me here for dinner when we were in Vegas fro NAB.  He preps me by telling me this is one of his favorite, chill places in the Fremont District...the food and drinks are great, but that we can expect to wait for a while.

As promised, we walk in and the super-friendly hostess tells us there's about an hour wait, and then invites us to grab a drink from the bar and chill in their outdoor patio.  We opt to walk down the street and grab a drink at another hip spot, so we put our name on the list.

When we get back, there's some lady going absolutely nuclear on the staff at the front door.  She's screaming so loud, she's just about frothing at the mouth and no one can really tell what she's pissed off about.  What was remarkable was that the manager and the hostess were so kind and patient with her...and even though they were trying to settle her down, she still stormed out yelling about how she'll never set foot in there again (Thank God! lol!).

The manager seats us at the counter in front of their huge, beautiful open kitchen (at our request), and apologize profusely for the scene.  He then calls out to the chef to serve us some tasters and small plates from the kitchen, on the house, by way of apology.  We explain that's not necessary...but he insists (super classy!!).  

We then order a couple of first-rate drinks from the bar and spend the next two and a half hours on a delicious journey of culinary greatness!!  Seriously, one of the best, most fun meals I've had in a long time.

Once she realized how into the experience we are, the chef keeps dropping us tasty morsels to try...deep friend chicken skins that were perfectly crispy, salty, oily yumminess...cauliflower bites that were at the same time light and healthy & rich and sinful (how do you do that?!?  Seriously).  Plate after plate of mind blown, tongue tickling satisfaction!!

So yeah...Carson Kitchen gets one of my highest recommendations!!

When you come, expect three things...food that will amaze and surprise, perfect drinks, and a staff that will treat you like instant friends!!

Just know that there's going to be a wait.  And treat the staff kindly.  Don't be that lady...ever.  Just don't!!",4Tc2IlqJ5H3c3eqhrBGaGQ,1,0,5,mdfG6ssJnSxjMXnUOkBRfg

I have to tell you though we went today at lunch and I think we were exceedingly lucky that we walked in and were able to sit at a table. There was one table that was being saved for somebody with reservations and everything else was literally full it is a tiny little spot. But it is fantastic. We started with the Wellington empanadas which was fantastic.  We then ordered the fried green tomato sandwich with crab and the short rib sliders both came with spicy tater tots. The tater tots were not too spicy you could definitely detect some Paprika and they were quite good. The short rib sliders were quite sweet. The menu does say that they are root beer short rib sliders so take note of that because they are sweet. But the slider was fantastic the sweetness was offset by a crispy onion that was put on the slider. If I had one note it would be to put a little bit more crispy onion to offset that sweetness. The fried green tomato sandwich with crab was the star the tomato is very thickly cut and expertly breaded. The breading has a nice spice to it. Overall it was a fantastic meal it's a little pricey for lunch but I think you have to look at what you get and then you understand the $40 price tag for two people at lunch.

The second time I went we got seated at the bar. The bar is weirdly designed so you can't scoot your barstool close and the bar doesn't overhang enough. Anyways, I felt uncomfortable and like I was hunched over to reach the bar. So we were seated and a waitress got us water. Then that was it. Staff buzzed around us but no one took our order. After 20 minutes we just left. So weird.

The third time there was an hour+ wait. We left. Get there by 11-11:30 or don't go.

The fourth time we got there at 11:30 & got seated. I asked for a table & the hostess looked uncomfortable since the only table left was a 6-top, but their bar design sucks so I wanted a table. 

Anyways, the food was amazing. I had the fried green tomato crab sandwich. Soooo yummy. I scarfed it. The tomato was really great with the crab. Lots of crab and how ever it's cooked, it's great. A little messy but just delish. My friend got the butter burger. It was huge. It had two cheeses on it and looked like they did a good job of cooking it medium well per her order. The spicy tots were good...a little greesy but I ate them all.

There's a bar inside and one on the roof. Waiting area was outside in a courtyard/lounge type area.  So we headed to the roof, grabbed a drink, and proceeded to chill in the courtyard. A couple drinks later we were seated inside. 
Placed our food order and another round of drinks. Started off with the chicken skins which were a crunchy delight of fried goodness. Wife ordered the green beans which were as tasty as a green bean could be.
I ordered the Secret Sunday chicken sandwich, which was one darn good tasting sandwich. The accompanying tater tots were consumed by the wife so I'm assuming that they were just as delicious.
My bro ordered the blackened Chilean sea bass and that thing was damn tasty. Perfectly cooked which the right amount of crispness on the blackened side.

Watermelon salad -- light, fresh, zesty and with the perfect amount of feta cheese. Rainbow cauliflower -- buttery, crunchy, zesty and visually appealing.

There are comfortable bench seats arranged around a fire pit in the back patio which my sister and I occupied as we waited, and we loved and took a lot of pics around :) haha

The Mac n Cheese was so tasty! I told my sis I shoulda ordered another one to go haha it was the perfect amount of cheesy and the bread crumbs on top gave it a light crunch/more flavor! The butter burger was alright, we both agreed, nothing too special. Spicy tater tots were good though!

We went for dinner during a friends bachelor party. Big thanks to all the Yelp reviewers who steered me right. Bacon jam and the oxtail risotto were great. 

The main thing to know about this place is the food is family style. The concept is you order the sides like oxtail risotto, mac n cheese, or the sprouts and suds hash and share with the table. Then you order your protein individually, but you could really share that too.

Our picks to share for two included: the deviled eggs, veal meatballs, BLTA salad, black rice risotto with oxtail, wild mushroom flatbread, tomato bisque and the donut bread pudding for dessert

Upon arrival on a Thursday evening with a group of 4 we were told there was a 45 min wait. No problem there at all. We know the drill and have eaten at many small and popular  places in the past. We grabbed drinks at the bar and snagged a seat by the super nice fire pit.  About 45 min later the hostess comes out and says that their larger tables are done dining but are still chatting. Again, I understand. I run a small business in the service industry myself and these things can be hard to manage. Another 20 min goes by with smaller parties getting seated one after another.  The hostess again comes and apologizes saying the other parties just simply wont leave.  After ten more minutes one of our guests actually kindly approached one group of guests at the bar and explained the situation and they gladly gave up their bar seats.  It is a bummer to have to sit at a bar with 4 people after such a long wait but such is life.  

Upon sitting at the bar it seemed pretty clear that the bartender either was having a rough night or just didn't quite appreciate our presence. However, the old fashioned she made for me was delicious.  That was about the only thing any of us enjoyed during the visit.  I was stoked to try the gyro tacos and was incredibly disappointed. The mac and cheese was pretty good but the oxtail risotto was pretty awful.  Sitting at the bar we struggled  to get our waters refilled and never got any sort of acknowledgment or apology for our 90 minute wait for bar seats after being quoted a 45 min wait. We just sat quietly disappointed eager to finish eating and leave.  I am not sure that I have ever left a negative review for a restaurant nor have I ever sent a dish back. Generally, I am pretty patient with mistakes especially when they are acknowledged, but I was shocked by the lack of hospitality we experienced.  It is also worth mentioning that while we were leaving, the party that was holding up the table was still sitting down with their food in to-go containers just talking.  

This place is cool and interesting but lacks heart.  It felt like they wanted our money and for us to ""ohh"" and ""ahh"" over their ""innovation"" but at the end of the day it never felt like the staff had any interest in making you feel comfortable, seen, or appreciated. While leaving this review I noticed the way the owner responds to negative feedback that he feels is unwarranted. I cant help but think that sort of culture is exactly what contributed to our experience.  Maybe it was a bad day, maybe this place is as awful as I think it is.

Cheddar Crab Fondue ($11): Served with a variety of carbohydrate vehicles - pretzel bread, cheese crisps, and baguette - that all worked well with the cheese. The group favorite was the pretzel. This is a really great dip/spread.

Bacon Jam ($12) with baked Brie and toasted baguette. There is so much buzz around this jam, so of course I had to try it. The sweet and salty bacon jam with Brie is good, but not my thing. Also, there is not nearly enough baguette for the amount of spread - it is so rich that you don't need very much of it. We asked for more bread (an extra $1 for a few slices).

""Devil's"" Eggs ($8) with crispy panchetta and caviar. I believe the term ""caviar"" is used loosely here as I'm certain the fish roe on our deviled eggs were not from sturgeon, but rather black tobiko (flying fish roe). The deceitful description is very disappointing, especially because these eggs were really delicious. 

Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto ($14) with Parmesan cream. This is a beautiful and fun dish. I didn't absolutely love the flavor, but there's a comfort factor that I enjoyed.

Roasted Young Beets ($9): Pistachio, orange, and goat cheese. The beets were delicious and I liked all the elements together, just a touch sweet.

The restaurant recently reopened after a two week renovation/remodel. We were lucky to be seated at the end of the large, granite kitchen table. It was an awesome spot because we had a front row seat to the cooking action. It was like being in the MasterChef kitchen (minus Chef Ramey's attitude), and I was impressed with how well the staff worked together.

Our party of four shared a number of appetizers. Our favorites were the Gyro Tacos and Tempura Green Beans. I ordered the New Your Strip, and I thought it was excellent. Everything that came out the kitchen was presented nicely and looked very appetizing. The staff was helpful and friendly. Overall a wonderful experience, and I definitely recommend.",loHW3nLm8Ex5BbCu7QOVaA,3,3,5,xoGw7bHgCyydtwVjZE7UfQ

Staff is really friendly and it reflects in the service. No complaints about our servers.

My girl dragged me here after work, since we were on he same side of town.  Last time were here meeting friends a month ago it was like a 45 minute wait time.  So wasn't too happy and expecting the same...We were having a way early dinner so no long wait time (530pm)...yeeessss! 10minutes tops wait in back patio. Upstairs wasn't open yet.
 
The steak was pretty bomb.  I thought it was gonna be a little thin cheap cut of meat.  It was rather delicious, medium rare to perfection and comes precut for sharing ( as all the dishes do )

The green bean dish was also pretty tasty and a different spin than the norm with light thin breading that flakes off.  Comes with a side of bell pepperish cheese thing for dipping.

The mushroom and spinach pizza was awesome...even threw a few pieces of the steak on top...yummmm...carnivore style!
If my girl who is usually a 2 bites and box it for home girl...actually finished it and no leftovers...well then it's pretty darn good. 

THE BAD.
Wait times can be ridiculous... seriously finding parking then having to do alternative plans when you get their with friends is a downer.  
The beet salad was tasty but it was wee size.  I think maybe the portion size should be rethought by the kitchen.  Loved that delicious little nugget of cheese deliciousness that it comes with.  

P.s.

All in all a great early dinner and ambiance..  I think their was about 36 people in the 40 room dining space.  So pretty packed for that time but no serious wait times from the kitchen bringing food out.  Great job to the Carson Cocina! =)",D5Cmz4luMLa0WD4LjYgpKQ,0,1,4,gVjr5WIDiTt5jAEsjhhNGA

It's like a hidden gem. Let me tell you. My friend and I were looking for Carson's Kitchen. Siri was telling us we were there, but we weren't. Just as we were about to turn around, a kind lady pointed us in the right direction. Luckily for her or we would have missed out! We get there and their not open yet! It was past the time plastered online. We waited a little and someone came to open the door. 

We walk in and the place isn't that big. Nice, trendy atmosphere. Love the tables as they look like they were recycled and reused. Not sire from what. I guess I could have asked. We sat at the middle section, right next to the lemons and such. Haha! They even have hooks for your bag, so it doesn't have to go on the floor. Which is bad luck! All your money will fly out! Anywho, I ordered the baked mac and cheese and my friend ordered a butter burger that came with tots. They do inform you when you sit down that food comes out as it's done. So one may get theirs before the other. Which happened to us. I got my mac and cheese first. I like to wait to eat until everyone gets their food. I only took one bite. I couldn't resist. It looked so good. The melted cheese, and those toasted breadcrumbs were just screaming my name! Not too long after her food comes out and we dig in. Omg! That mac and cheese is up there with some of the best. Then I had a glob of cheese and I was singing! My friend took a bite of hers and she loved it! I had a tot and they were made to perfection! The right amount of crunch! Not soggy or falling apart. 

The ladies working there were awesome! Shout out to Tara and Felicia! They were hilarious and down to earth. Real people. When you get your bill, it's in a book, which you can write a little note in. Of course I wrote something in Lucky number, or chapter, 7. 

I asked how long they had been there and I believe she said around 2 years. And I had no idea! I'll be back though!",2MtL65B0hy5L41TFBRIdYg,2,1,5,8-EyDxtIZWUYtEWFEY8OWg

Almost every single dish was a salt overload and the bacon jam had a really weird texture and odd taste. They ran out of water glasses, so the guys at our table went almost a half hour without water. Burnt ends were more fatty and not very crispy, but the sauce was yummy. The fish was the best thing and was delicious.

Went here with a party of 8 and kind of did family style ordering off the ""Social Plates"" (meant to be shared, or as an appetizer) The Crispy Chicken Skins with Honey are unbelievably good! Our only complaint was that there were no other dipping sauces like ranch or blue cheese. I understand that the chef does not like altering the taste of his creations but a few people at our table could not eat the honey and it left them at a disadvantage. The waiter was very nice and helpful and explained that they do not carry ranch but offered a hot sauce similar to Frank's hot sauce that could be used as a dipping sauce so that those that could not eat the honey aren't left just chomping on the lonesome crispy chicken skin. I myself thought the chicken was flavorful enough to eat without any sauce! Haha. The Gyro tacos were also an amazing choice! The lamb was perfectly seasoned and juicy! The Taziki was superb and pita was not thick and perfectly crunchy, just how I liked it! They come in an order of three but as many can me added to an order. We also ordered the pierogies, meatballs and beets. They were good also but the chicken skins and tacos are a must try!

As of drinks, do not order the Moscow Mule! It was extremely bitter! However I saw someone order something really tasty and the waiter explained it to be a spicy margarita. It was amazing! I wish I remembered the name of the drink. It was a spicy margarita topped off with a spicy rim and a lime! (I'm going to think long and hard about the name and if it comes back to me I'll definitely update my review. 

Since it is a small restaurant with a smaller kitchen, the waiter warned us that the food may take a while. He explained that dishes will be taken out as they are made because the size of the kitchen and the amount of people they are cooking for.

Carson Kitchen has a really sweet and genuine staff with great knowledge of the menu (how its prepared, the ingredients that go into it, etc.) The food is strangely unique and everything is super tasty. I feel like the menu changes semi frequently, so I'll refrain from commenting on each individual dish.

My complaints:  
1. The setup - Come in the winter on a windy day and when the door opens, all your stuff gets blown over and you turn into a popcicle. Come in on a summer day and when the door opens, your stuff gets blown over and you melt into a pile of sweat.
2. Their prices - Carson Kitchen costs more than some places on the Strip! For me, that's what's holding them back from giving them five stars.",7Q6nBHl6NJ9gbJ900FkkAg,3,3,4,L0b_gaugn9DlebHt_7X3Mw

We waited an hour for a table, which isn't that bad considering it was Saturday night so you can't be mad about that. One annoying part though was that they had plenty of open tables on their patio but they don't let you sit in them even if you've ordered drinks from the bar. You must stand at the bar or wander around the courtyard. The bussers would jump on different parties the instant they sat down with their drinks, claiming the tables were for parties being seated... the problem is parties were never seated in those tables. 

The food looked amazing in person as well. The problem was that everything was very heavy handed. The bacon jam was great for the first bite or two but just had so much pepper and spice that it was overwhelming and you couldn't even taste the bacon. The deviled eggs were pretty good. The mac and cheese was DRENCHED in truffle oil. I can still taste it a week later. We absolutely love mac and cheese, even when it's not that good it's still pretty good (kinda like pizza), but they had so much truffle oil on this stuff that it was gross and inedible. The pesto flatbread was pretty boring and uneventful, also unfulfilling. The lamb was good.

Pros: Drinks were strong, everyone was friendly, food came out in a fairly timely manner.

Cons: Food wasn't very good. Tons of open tables with no parties being sat and can't sit in bar area even though you're drinking. Everything was pretty pricey for ""tapas"" style small plates. I don't mind paying a premium for good stuff, but not for heavy handed, over seasoned stuff.

4895890,2015-08-25,2,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I finally was able to try this place. It's in downtown Las Vegas and I had been wanting to go here forever.

It took a while to find because it is inside an old motel that I thought was still abandoned. I feel like this is part of specialness of this place. You feel accomplished once you find it and feel like you are in on the secret of where it is located.

Their menu is a bunch of small plates that are meant to share with a large party. They also have a few items, such as their burger, that weren't mean to for sharing.

You have to have an open mind and not be a picky eater to eat here. They have a lot of different yet delicious pairings.

It is a bit on the pricy side but if you go with a large group of people I feel like the cost will even itself out. Since it was only my uncle and I it felt a bit pricy and I felt a bit cheated with going with only two people because I couldn't try as much. Next time I come I would like to come with a larger party.

I would have to say the best item I tried was the bacon jam. I'm not even a big bacon fan (yes, I know, I'm weird) but I really loved this dish. It had brie cheese on top and you were able to spread the jam on bread that accompanied the dish. It kind of tasted like smoked meat and was delicious. I would definitely get this again.

I also ordered the mac and cheese. It was good but very heavy. I feel like I would have been fine with just a scoop because of how heavy it was. I feel like this would be a good dish to get with a larger group of people.

We also ordered the devil eggs which were just meh. I have had better and would recommend trying something else.

Overall I had a great experience. A tad on the pricy side but then again it is downtown. I would try this place again once I've gone to a few other DT restaurants.",eh9uc8xHYR9-rki7fWggQQ,1,2,4,D-jrKe1tY01HMsrouxcwQw

Immediately I was uncomfortable because of the wooden stools they used as chairs. We took two full back chairs from the next table and put the stools there. The hostess came over and told us we couldn't have those chairs because there wouldn't be enough room when they got busy. We actually sat closer to the table because they were chairs. We asked to keep the chairs and she just walked off. 
Ordered some appetizers and drinks. No redbull...boo. What kind of hipster restaurant doesn't have redbull?  They did have Tito's vodka...yum. 
Our server was very nice and explained how the food is served, etc. Ordered the chicken skins, not my favorite but I don't like just fried skins. Also got the green beans (YUMMY!!!!) the sauce was amazing. My husband ordered the lamb tacos and loved them. There were only 3 tacos and we were obviously sharing the dishes so the waitress asked if we would like a 4th...I thought that was nice. I did love the Mac and cheese. The rest of the food was good but not necessarily my taste. It was obvious they put great care into their menu and presentation, I appreciated that.

4947112,2018-01-05,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Why, why, WHY have I not been here before???

I can't believe my hotel concierge took this long (I'm talking years) to recommend Carson Kitchen. I had some friends from Boston visiting for our annual New Year's celebration, and the day after the nutso celebrations, we were looking for what breakfast/brunch places were open. The only qualification? It had to be amazeballs.

Carson Kitchen is located next to the Donut Bar, and has one of the most nondescript front entrances I have ever (or never) seen. Our limos had driven by at least twice, looking for something resembling a eatery or gastro pub of some sort. It wasn't until I pulled up WAZE and stepped out onto the curb that I realized I was standing right in front of it. It was hidden right in plain site, and I LOVED it.

One of the first things you'll immediately notice is the amazing service. It honestly had a small town friendly vibe to it, which I never expected to find in downtown Vegas..... or Vegas in general, where everything is so commercially corporate, and friendly but superficial. Carson Kitchen was warm, like Biddeford, Maine, or Snyder, Texas.

We were table of 9, including five kids and teens, so probably the most fickle bunch of eaters this side of the Mississippi. But we had this amazing communal table, and just went to town. I ordered every one of the share dishes, and the kids had their mac n cheese and grilled cheese with short rib sandwiches. Here are my thoughts:

1) Grillled cheese with short ribs: GREAT! Wow. It tasted like something I'd expect after a night of debauchery in N'awlins. Perfect morning-after food.

2) bacon jam. This is a twist from what I'm used to, and the Bostonians weren't crazy about it, but I'm a bacon jam connoisseur, and this stuff was artisanal. It comes out sizzling with a strip of baked brie right down the middle. Truly next-level stuff!

3) Veal meatballs in sherry foie gras cream sauce. So I have to be honest. The meatballs were bit overcooked when we got them, so probably not as great as they should have been. But the combo with that sauce is simply amazing. My suggestion is request that the meatballs not be overcooked when you order them. But I'll say this much. These were REAL meatballs. Not the sausage-like chewy crap you'll find in frozenfood meatballs.

4) Fried chicken skins. Okay.... this one is for a chosen few. I spent some time growing up in Indonesia, so this is normal fare for me. I also have friends from Wisconsin and N'awlins, where this kind of stuff is normal. if you're turned off by the idea of chicken skins (lots of people are), then skip it. But if you like it, order it. I LOVED it, especially with their smoked honey dipping sauce. It tastes like pork rinds, but are an amazing comfort food for those that know what it is- crunchy comfort.

5) BBQ ends. I can't remember if I'm calling this right, but it's the end pieces of what I think are beef ribs, grilled to crunchy perfection. These cubes of succulence were exactly the kind of thing I wanted to round off the savory part of breakfast. I elect these the ultimate Superbowl snack of choice that goes perfectly with your coldest of brews.

6) The OMG. The Finale. The coup-de-gras..... is the glazed donut bread pudding. In all honesty, if we simply ordered 9 of these, we all would have been more than satisfied. This was the most amazing thing I've had in a long time. It was everything you think sex should be if it was a dessert. Soft, bouncy, moist, creamy, and just the right about of sweet. Truly impressive.

Obviously, I love this place. Highly recommend it, and will definitely be coming back on a regular basis.",qW2e3x21BMWlOr72WUoFug,5,3,5,HaJLi_CiSjco4_wcatOZ5g

Always forget to check in but always never fully disappointed with the food. 4.5 / 5

Started the dinner off with a drink. No matter where I go I always ask for the sweetest drink on the menu and the bartender suggested for me the Sallynoggin (Jameson whiskey, luxardo maraschino, fernet vittone, cinzano bianco, peychaud's bitters). Don't know most of the ingredients but I was satisfied with her suggestion. Nothing better than an employee who knows what they are recommending to their guests. 5/5.

My friend and I ordered the roasted rainbow cauliflower to share. I appreciated the amount of the lemon juice to the dish. It brightened up the dish definitely. Very simple but perfectly done. 5/5.

I ordered for myself the forbidden black rice risotto with oxtail and my friend ordered the shepherd's 3.14. 

Risotto came out first. Rice was aldente and definitely a true risotto. Not too dry. Not too runny. Just the perfect consistency. However the oxtail meat that was pulled from the bone was missed in the dish. I only got one big chunk in the very center of the plate. The forbidden rice was just a little too al dente for my liking. I understand it has a different consistency than arborio rice but it wasn't that bad enough to put me off from clearing my plate. Just to add a touch more flavor I added the colored cauliflower with each bite and definitely the lemon brought a much needed pop to the flavor profile. 4/5.

For my friend's Shepherd's 3.14 (gnocchi, lamb, natural jus), their take on a shepherd's pie was lacking in the starch. Don't get me wrong. The presentation was appealing. The small three pieces of gnocchi, not so much. I wanted to taste it but didn't want to take it away from my friend. Our expectation was a little bit more lamb but instead we found a mixture of ground and stewed lamb meat? Seasoning was a little but lacking of salt but then again I am a salt fiend. I stopped from taking tasting bites so my friend could finish his meal. 4/5.

As small as the plates were in portion, by the end we were surprisingly full. One thing the bartender mentioned to another guest that I over heard when they were asked how big the plates were... the plates are big enough to share. Not so much haha. I would suggest you get an entree for yourself and get a side or two to share. But definitely don't share your entree with anyone else haha. Overall always great time when spent with a friend or two or three or more. Their seasonal menu is always appreciated. Definitely will always come to support whenever possible.",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,0,0,4,nU4L74ravAWYZE8r_QYOug

Stopped in for dessert with friends based on overall good reviews and tasty looking pics. 

We ordered all three desserts in the menu - 

The bread pudding was great! 
The brownie was good and had a bit of cinnamon to give it a Mexican chocolate feel. The ice cream that came with it was okay. 
The ""pie"" was my least favorite and was marred by the accompanying biscotti that was so hard it felt like a tooth breaker. 

The service was really slow - it took about 30 minutes for our desserts to arrive.

Last night we ordered the crispy chicken skins, rainbow cauliflower, shrimp dunderi, and jerk turkey burger. The chicken skins are served with smoked honey and oh so addictive. They are best enjoyed fresh as they can become slightly hard and chewy if you leave them sitting towards the end of your meal. The cauliflower was crunchy, lemony, and refreshing. The shrimps were huge and the dunderi was pillowy perfection. It's basically gnocchi that is made with cheese rather than potatoes. Need I say more? The turkey burger was the real highlight of last night's meal. The patty was huge and juicy. I totally forgot that it was turkey! The sweetness from the mango chutney slaw complemented it so well, I wish it had more.

The drinks and food are exceptional. There are very few restaurants that I would say everything is good. Everything is good here! 

A few of my favorites would be the Bacon Jam, the shrimp, their Mac and Cheese is dang good. All their burgers are great and steak.

Water was served almost immediately and the waitress was really nice. She wasn't too pushy and was there when we needed her. 

I ordered the coffee rubbed ny steak for $19. It's not pricy for red meat but it came with nothing else. Only meat. By far not the best steak I've had. I didn't taste any coffee but was happy that it came out medium rare like I asked for. I also tried my friend's beef stroganoff which I did not like. The portion size was super small and to me it tasted oddly like chocolate. 

I also tried the bison sliders. They were a little dry but I enjoyed the flavor of the meat and the sweet jam it came with. All burgers and sandwiches came with a side of spicy tator tots which were delicious!  By far the best thing there. I also tried the lamb gyros. For $10 bucks you get three gyro tacos and they were pretty yummy. Best bang for your buck. 

The restaurant is small and can get really loud.  But it has a very cozy hipster atmosphere. I don't think I will come back again but it's a cool hangout spot.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,2,2,3,x1ecupOWa9SBIverYxkx6Q

I would say, if the staff is reading this, the only thing I would change is a different side dish on the turkey burger.

5022957,2015-11-05,2,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"The wife and I went downtown specifically for a dinner at Carson Kitchen.  Carson Kitchen had been on my to-do list since opening, but we finally made it for dinner less than a week after Chef Simon had, sadly, passed away.  I'd been a fan of Chef Simon's unique take on comfort food after dining at his first restaurant at the Hard Rock back in '03, so there was a somber note to an otherwise delicious dining experience.

We arrived around 5:30 on a Thursday night.  Carson Kitchen was smaller than I expected, but it possessed a dark, modern, masculine aesthetic that looked nice.  We didn't have reservations, but coming in early allowed us to snag prime seats overlooking the kitchen.  I always enjoy being able to see the action in the kitchen.  Our seats didn't disappoint.  We didn't order drinks other than water, which was unusual for us, especially since there were several cocktails on the menu that sounded appealing.  Definitely next time.

For our meal, we shared orders of the Crispy Chicken Skins ($9), Bacon Jam ($12), and Rabbit Ragu ($14).  The Crispy Chicken Skins were exactly what you'd expect, crispy chicken skins...essentially chicken chicharrón, served with smoked honey for dipping.  It was simple, delicious, and effective.  The Bacon Jam was exactly what you'd expect; smoky, savory bacon made into a jam, topped with baked Brie, and served with toasted baguette slices.  It was very close to being too salty for my personal liking, but it didn't cross the line and it was still very good.  The Rabbit Ragu wasn't what you'd likely expect unless you'd read the menu, which we did.  We received a generous amount of rabbit meat in the ragu served atop a bed of spaghetti squash, a nice change of pace over regular pasta, and topped with Parmesan.  All of our dishes were generous in its portion size given the price.  Service was friendly and attentive throughout our meal.  By all measures, Carson Kitchen was everything I'd hoped it would be. 4.5 stars.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,2,1,5,nW7brTgYJIwmIyTGK1WByg

short rib sliders: WAY TOO SWEET. tasted like pure sugar and the meat was dry.  Would not get again. 

Mac and Cheese: decent, enjoyed the crust, nothing exceptional. 

rainbow cauliflower: very garlicky (in a good way) and spicy.  I'd say prob a 8/10. Good but again, not exceptional. 


I was disappointed that the cocktails were not strong at all. If i'm paying 13$ for a cocktail I expect it to pack a punch, unfortunately they just tasted like juice. 

I was also really annoyed that the waiter kept pushing me to either 1. buy a drink or 2. buy a more expensive drink. Nothing bugs me more than pushy service.",WlBQRynXJi8tbrnNh5V84g,3,0,3,QmZXLP4TYAIGu4n-UCo_SA
5034208,2017-01-22,1,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Jesus Christ this place is delicious! I thought it went beyond just ""good, well executed dishes"". They really did a great job using a lot of cool flavors.

Mac n' Cheese: $12 - I loved it! They had little bits of garlic sprinkled on top which I've never seen before, but really livened it up. The pasta was cooked perfectly; a little al dente. The cheese was creamy and delicious. And they also had bits of shredded cheese sprinkled in that you'd get a taste of to provide some more variety.

Butter Burger: $14 - My girlfriend got this; really, we shared both. She ordered it medium well and it came out moderately pink on the inside. Reading some other reviews, it seems that this is a consistent pattern. She liked it though, and so did I, so it's all good. The burger was juicy and delicious. It was served hot off the grill. I loved the cheese too; not overwhelming; just the right amount to balance the meat. My girlfriend loved the spicy tater tots. To me, they were the one thing there that was average.

Bourbon Fudge Brownie: $8 - This desert was awesome. It had ""brown butter bacon ice cream"" and a really really rich brownie. I really liked the ice cream a lot. The brownie was good, but it was a bit too rich for me. I also like this sort of dish when the brownie is warm. I would have preferred if they have more ice cream and less brownie; I think what makes the dish is when you eat them together, and in this case the proportions were off. But that's nitpicking. It was great. Also, they weren't shy in about adding bacon! It was good, but it was also a little overwhelming to me. My girlfriend thought the bacon was just too much and picked it out.

Other than the dishes, I thought the atmosphere was pretty cool. It was extremely extremely hipster. We sat at the bar and they have an open kitchen. I really liked that. I enjoy watching them cook.

The service was good.

Overall, I was really happy and am excited to go back to try new dishes. I thought the flavors were awesome. Most dishes were in the $10-20 price range - I would pay $30+ to eat here.",dnsCCmwYrONjUAivm3XR4w,3,0,5,D7QxW16IJjpgAJxvZ5EeQw

5042237,2014-08-07,3,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"In the past 6 months, downtown Las Vegas has been booming. The latest buzz happens to be the John E. Carson building on Carson and 6th Ave. This converted hotel now houses some of the coolest, most innovative business downtown like Bud & Vine, Grass Roots and O Face Doughnuts. For this review, I wanted to visit a restaurant who's food and drinks have been the center of conversation at work. I'm talking about Kerry Simon's Carson Kitchen. 

What drew me to the joint was the innovative spin on modern classics. Recommendations seem to pour my way about the food and drinks offered. Approaching the joint, you'll notice the restaurant name etched into the windows. Enter the place and you'll quickly realize the dramatic spin Carson Kitchen hosts. The lighting was more on the intimate side, however, large windows offered more natural light during my early dinner visit. What I can say is this place offers a very eclectic feel. You have butcher block wooden table tops and bar tops, out of the box lighting fixtures shaped like jars and what seemed like a wheel of Swiss cheese and twisted metal separators from the bar and dining area, giving the illusion of streamers. 

For this visit, a friend and I decided to sit at the bar to order some cocktails and light bites. Our bartender this evening was Stephanie and the bar back, Danny. Stephanie to me, is the epitome of customer service. She took the time to get to know us from the moment we sat down. She was personable, humorous and gave us some amazing recommendations when solicited.

Stephanie recommended a couple of drinks to try that evening. Both recommendations came from the popularity of her customers. Here's what I got: 

The Magarian for $10. Aviation gin, thyme and honey syrup, fresh lemon, Mr. Q Cumber soda and garnished with a cucumber slice and sprigs of thyme. It was clean and super refreshing. Ever flavor was prominent and really stood out on its own, yet came together very nicely. To me, the gin and lemon flavors married well and there was a refreshing thyme and cucumber finish.

The Town's End for $11. Slow and Low whiskey, Fernet Vittone, Amaro del Sole, Regan's bitters #6 and Angostura bitters. This drink is true strong sipper. It gives off the vibe of a ""gentleman's cocktail,"" although great for all sexes, or a porch drink enjoyed on southern summer afternoon. What this drink is know for is the big spherical shaped ice that fills the glass. The whiskey and Fernet make for a deep, rich flavor and the bitters bring an elegant bite. I love how the whiskey was the true star of the show, however, the earthiness of the Fernet peaks through at some point and ends on a sweet note. Definitely a great drink to try!

Trust me, you do NOT want to stop there. While you're here, you should definitely take advantage of their food. After all, they are first a foremost, a restaurant. To go along with out wonderful cocktails, we also decided to order a few ""Social Plates"" from the menu. We got the:

Bacon Jam for $12. Bacon jam topped with Brie cheese and served with toasted baguette. The smokiness of the bacon and sweetness of the jam worked harmoniously. Top it with the creaminess of the Brie and you've got a perfect topping for the crunchy baguette. Really a great dish! 

Tempura Green Beans for $6. Served with pepper jelly and cream cheese. I was told this was life changing. And it was. The pepper jelly and cream cheese combo brought me back to my younger years, eating it with Ritz crackers. Today, I was taken to an even better place with the crunchy and fresh taste of the tempura batter and green beans. Such a great combination. I HIGHLY recommend this.

Gyro Tacos for $10. Lamb, Tzatziki sauce, cucumber, tomatoes, cilantro and feta. This dish has a strong Mediterranean presence. The lamb was seasoned well and the Tzatziki sauce married the meat, tomatoes and cucumbers quite nicely. 

Spicy Mushroom flatbread for $12. Spicy sausage, homemade ricotta, broccoli and fennel. Probably the best part of the meal for me. A super savory dish with lots of sausage and caraway seeds. It wasn't too spicy and allowed you to enjoy the flavors. The broccoli, although not common on flatbreads, really brought a nice clean texture to the mix, along with the fennel. I really loved this dish and know you will too!

The one question I kept asking myself was why I haven't visited sooner. This place is exactly what the downtown scene needs. It's fun, full of personality and offers yet another great option for diners and drinkers alike. I can see this place appealing to the masses of folks looking to catch up with old friends or meeting that blind date for nice evening. Overall, this place definitely has a good social vibe and was made for the intent of Downtown Las Vegas: the intent of collisions.",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,7,6,5,hhClQhaKth5uz_D9jFXNAQ

Service: Very good to above average. Everyone seemed happy to be working here, and it showed. 

Price/Value: I thought was on par for the venue and service 

Taste: I selected the steak based on yelp reviews and was disappointed but I have no doubt there are other dishes that are good. The fried mac and cheese was on par with the sides of similar establishment and the donut bread pudding is a must have if you visit this establishment. I was debating whether or not to indulge and I'm thankful I did ! 

Conclusion: Although given the price and taste I would typically rate this around a 3. The bread pudding and the service and the acknowledgment that I just selected a dish that wasn't my ""thing"" bumps this up to a 4 star.",j8m6Qn1aCwSYEBbXlVGgGA,0,0,4,aLYoOjzOAk_2kOJtbswOvQ

We've been curious of the buzz and were heading to DCR so we looked through bookmarks for something nearby. It was busy, but we were able to have a table upstairs on the cute rooftop patio.

We just ate family style and shared all our items. 

Wellington Empanada- the empanada serving comes with 2. This was crispy but the flavors were just A-OK for me. 

Roasted young beets - I'm a sucker for the trifecta of beets, with a soft cheese (goat cheese in this case) and pistachios. The orange slices and microgreens were nice in this. Solid salad. 

Rainbow Cauliflower - it's really simple, but it's done right. Nice roast and seasoning on it. 

Chicken Skin - these were delish and naughty! The smoked honey reminds me of being a kid and dipping KFC chicken in those janky honey sauce packets that come with the biscuit. 

The following is more meal portioned than appetizers as they are sandwiches plus spicy tater tots. 

Fried Green Tomato Sandwich - this was lovely as it had a lump crab ravigote salad and greens that went perfectly with the crispy fried tomato and I enjoyed the bread quite a bit. 

Short Rib Sliders- came with 3. The root beer glaze was sweet, but it worked for me. It reminds me of this braised pork dish that's cooked in root beer and spices. 

The tater tots were standard, but good. Real crispy and dusted with seasoning spices. 

Then for dessert we tried the glazed donut bread pudding. They use day old donuts from O Face next door. It was soft and moist and the sauce reminds me of a bananas foster. Real good. 

Service was pretty good. They were doing training so we had the attention of a server and their trainee. Drinks were refilled in a timely manner and they were friendly and paced out our food pretty well too.

Overall, I enjoyed the food and didn't think it was outrageously priced, but can be the type of place to add up quick when you go small plates. Out of all the items we got, the Fried Green Tomato sandwich was the best deal, but it also was my favorite dish.With that said, I think $75 for four is not a bad price for what we received in flavor and quality. I will be back soon as I need more fried green tomato sandwiches in my life.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,10,6,4,X-WqMAkXh9badjZRGrveGA

To finish it off, there was the glazed doughnut bread pudding.  It was indescribable.  You just have to get it on your own, though I would warn it is a touch sweet.

4) Macaroni and Cheese - 4/5 what is not to love about mac and cheese. I just took out 1 point for portion size. this is more of a side than a main.
5) Tater Tots - 5/5
6) Chicken Skins - 2/5 Personally did not like the way the chicken skins were seasoned. I guess the honey was supposed to be a nice touch but did nothing to add to flavor.
7) Bacon Jam - 5/5 Delicious!! 
8) Burgers - 4/5 Try it with the Bacon Jam.

Service was terrific, Our server (I forgot his name) was really helpful with recommending dishes and pacing our meal. He was very knowledgeable and we found his insight valuable when navigating the menu. 

Is this worth checking out? I would say so, especially if you are staying in Downtown, this is walking distance and very convenient.",lcVYS_xGVfWCyx3q_6BRKQ,1,0,4,8qdnH568NOsaEV9wjfPE-w
5094887,2018-04-11,22,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"The epitome of Vegas style cuisine.

Vegas cuisine?  It's New American with an ""I did it my way"" attitude.  Fresh and seasonal ingredients, some ""bad for your health"" results but all boasting big flavors that match requisite craft beers and cocktails and all playful enough for social dining.  

Tip: All dishes are meant to be shared.  Ask your server about portion sizes.  They can be adjusted based on the size of your party.  

Note:  Dishes will be served when they are ready.  They do complement each other well so coursing is not important.  

Standards remain excellent.  The flour and spice dusted, deep fried chicken skin is crack in a basket.  Dip a crackling into the slightly bitter smoked honey and taste the bacon-esque essence of chicken skin.  Not to be outdone, the bacon jam.  Sweet, salty, bacon goodness.  A melted smear of brie adds earthiness and actually cuts the richness.  Smeared on a charred baguette, a sip of an Old Fashioned and all is right with the world.

Need veg?  The ""Broccoli Crunch"" stands out.  Vibrant and refreshing.  Raw, young broccoli florets, pumpkin seeds, and a sunflower seeds tossed with a light green goddess dressing.  A few cherry tomatoes thrown in for their acidic burst.  Incredibly refreshing and works well alongside the richer dishes.  The rainbow cauliflower and Spring asparagus both equally good.

The charred octopus is outstanding.  Slathered in oil, aggressively spiced, and charred to the point the tip of the tentacle is crisp.  Bitterness adds huge complexity when combined with first of the season fingerling potatoes.  The saffron aioli ties everything together while a squeeze of a charred lime adds acidity.

Finally, the crispy skin salmon, is simplicity at its best.  A perfectly cooked piece of salmon, its skin ethereally crisp, a trace line of spinach pistou (macerated spinach, garlic and olive oil), and a charred lemon ripe for the squeezing.  Rustic perfection.  

Well chosen but short list of beer and wine.  Excellent craft cocktails.  Great bartenders.

Service is off Strip, very friendly and energetic.

Reservations recommended even for a week night.

In a word, outstanding.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,33,30,5,u9_cCgB38Ojig1qwSATz7Q

5100322,2014-11-11,3,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I'm a fan because I'm a sucker for good food and good beer.

My friends from China came into town (former Las Vegans) and we were on a mission to squeeze in as many new bars, clubs, and restaurants as humanly possible into the few days they had in Vegas. Carson Kitchen was an immediate destination. To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Simon the restaurant. But Simon the person is a pretty cool guy (met him once) and he's following me on Instagram and Twitter. Just saying. ;D

The plates are small-ish and the menu is designed w/ a social aspect as its intended to be shared. This is great for us because we believe in sharing and want to try a little of everything. Not a lot of one thing. One of my friends is Jewish so we didn't try anything bacon. There are a lot of kosher items on the menu--in case its worth mentioning. We went with the following:

-Tempura Green Beans ($8): Delicious. Fresh green beans battered then deep fried. How could this possibly be a bad choice. Cream cheese dip was tasty however it could have been served softer/room-temp. It was a little difficult to dip the beans w/o breaking. 
-Broccoli Crunch: ($10): Crunchy (but not too crunchy) broccoli in a green goddess sauce. This is delicious and done really well. Refreshing and the perfect pair w/ the rest of the heavy menu.
-Baked Mac & Cheese ($12): Again, a classic that can't go wrong. Noodles aren't mushy. Cheese is rich and has the perfect texture. 
-Short Rib Sliders ($14): The only thing we didn't like! The bun is good; I have to give them that. But the short rib root beer glaze is so sweet it kind of spoiled the slider for us. It's TOO SWEET and rather unpleasant. We ate it but wouldn't order it again.
-Wild Mushroom Flat Bread ($10): Another delicious option. Lots of mushrooms, carmelized onions, and crumbled bleu cheese. These are perfect for sharing. Next time I want to try the spicy sausage one. 

3 people + all that food + 3 beers was plenty for us. I think I spent around $90 + tip. Not bad and definitely a place worthy of entertaining guests. This is the perfect spot for a GNO or FNO. Get a few people together, kick back and chill while you get small bites + a few beers/cocktails (full bar). I'll be back!",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,5,4,4,o1PUMcV3-WJBzmR4wnmSQg

We ordered:
-Crispy Chicken Skins ($9): 4/5 stars. The skins make a great appetizer-- they're crunchy, flavorful, and pairs well with the sauce. However, they're very easy to make at home! If you ever purchase a pack of chicken thighs from the grocery store, you could very easily remove the skins from all of them and fry them like this
-Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip ($19): 4/5. Expensive-- for $19, you get the strip but no sides. Similar to the skins, the sauce sweetens the food a tad bit. Meat was tender and the red wine demi was a great, unique pairing for the steak
-Butter Burger ($14): 3/5 stars. Nothing special, just a burger. The tater tots that came with it tho.... a little spicy but great change from the typical burger & fries",Tyb_FnUv3L0LqsYyL8FIAQ,0,1,4,U-aBAv2mKfaVhfkI-llV3A

The table was tiny and the only seats were stools, which was terribly uncomfortable, especially for someone with back issues. these were the main reasons for subtracting a star.

The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt - so no loss of stars for the service. I wasn't sure what to order to drink and the waiter was very helpful. I ended up with the sangria, which was tasty and strong.

We ordered the crispy chicken skins and ""devil's"" eggs to start. The skins were warm, crunchy, and absolutely delicious. It came with a honey for dipping, which was great since there was just a touch of spicy heat to the skins. The egg were seasoned just right and the caviar gave it a little 'pop'. I preferred the skins and my husband went for the eggs, but that is just a matter of preference, since they were both wonderful. 

We decided to share the short rib grilled cheese, which was okay, but a bit bland, especially after the well-seasoned apps. 

For dessert we shared the glazed donut bread pudding and it was awesome! Everything about it was delicious, including the creme anglais and the caramel sauce. 

I would definitely recommend Carson Kitchen, and will be going back. Just a heads up - it doesn't have any outside signage, just the name painted in the bottom corner of the window. I almost missed it and I know what I was looking for.",Jtmnh7YtqTxD8ZkeyhSorA,0,0,4,ZFntnjVFk8IKbHy4bVru-g

I ate at Carson Kitchen tonight for the 3rd time and it never fails to deliver a great experience.  It's a small space, but always busy and active.  Lively conversation, but not too loud.  There is a great outdoor patio and an upstairs bar.  The venue is first-rate.

As far as food goes, there is nothing on the menu that isn't amazing.  I've had the Burnt Ends, Devils Eggs and Gyro Tacos.  And I've had the Strip Steak, the Pork Chop and salad.  I could elaborate on these items, but words don't do them justice.  They are phenomenal.

Mac and Cheese....heaven on earth.  Olive Oil potatoes....wow.  Cauliflower...awesome.  Yes, there is a theme here.  Nothing has disappointed.

The staff understands how to run a very busy, popular restaurant.  They are friendly, efficient and really helpful.  Having trouble with what to order?   Just ask someone to help.  I'd swear that everyone has worked here for years, because they are familiar with the menu and no one is shy about offering recommendations.  They also get along and work as a team, which says a lot about the management team.

I then asked to make a reservation, mainly because I knew first Friday evenings pack everything in down town. They don't take reservations for a party of 4 , apparently that's too small for them.  Perhaps if it was delivered differently I would have a different opinion.

Regardless, I still went because we planned to try with friends who have also never been. I also live in downtown so I am always curious of the culinary scene. 

They take your name down, how many in your party, tell you the wait time, and then to come back. They don't take your number they don't call or they don't text. I found this frustrating. Something needs to be done about this.

After having to wander around down town and make many laps in this blazing heat, we finally were seated. I have to say 5 stars for the service from our waitress. Wish I could remember her name she was so nice and pleasant and very suggestive. We ordered many things as our appetites grew.

The deviled eggs with caviar is great, the gyro tacos ok. The fried chicken skin good , didn't care for the jam butter with bread. The turkey mango burger was sweet. The tarter tots were delicious. I would come back again when it's slow or if I have a large party enough for this restaurant to take my reservation. 

Again, my only complaint I have is my experience about the whole reservation thing and no text or call back not even a buzzer.",n6GyJB0d3H9--yLNKtecFg,1,0,3,EdeaCNxhckXwQf6bW-3AsA

Hands-down the best dessert I've ever had in Vegas definitely one of the best spots for locals. The bourbon fudge brownie and the bread pudding were enough to make me go back a on another occasion just for dessert and drinks. Definitely a decadent a way to treat your self after a long day or long week of work and great to share with friends and family. The cocktails have been top notch from the times I've gone. Not only is the Simon Says Sangria refreshing but definitely one of my favorites on the menu that would complement any meal with citrus notes that mixes perfectly with the white wine. The communication breakdown cocktail was a lavender infused cocktail with italian liqueur and tequila that had a smoky yet fragrant quality. They have a wide assortment of cocktails that are handcrafted and unique only exclusive carsons kitchen. I I can't wait to go back and try another cocktail.

We stopped in for lunch on a Friday afternoon, were immediately seated and given menus to look over. Deciding to share, we ordered a few different things; German potato salad, shrimp and grits, the steak with reduction and the crispy chicken skin with smoked honey. 

The German potato salad had decent flavor but was overly salty. The chicken skins were indeed crispy with a slightly spicy dusting. The smokiness of the honey was lost when paired with it's intended vehicle, but on it's own, it's fantastic. And surprisingly strong. The shrimp and grits was by far the best dish. Spicy, flavorful, it's a shame there wasn't more of it. The steak was meh, but I appreciated that it was rare, as I requested. The coffee flavor was lost and the reduction was flavorless- making the entire piece of meat unmemorable. I swished the meat around in it a few times to try to find something and got nothing.

We sat at the kitchen bar where we could see the Chefs at work. For our main meal I got the butter burger mid rare and Josie got the New York. We were encouraged to try the Mac n Cheese because it would be the best we ever had. (You don't know me) I thought. When you say this it better be so good I cant get enough. It was not. Honestly I make a decent home made mac which according to Josie is better. Burger was really good with an aged white cheddar on top. Had a smoked flavor and that sharp bite from the aged cheese. Steak was perfcetly cooked mid rare. I could say it could have used maybe some salt after the cook, but that is splitting hairs. Overall a great meal and great service.

First-off, all beers here are bottled (if this matters to you read-on; if not, what is wrong with you? :) Coming from San Diego, gastro pubs serving locally-sourced brews on-tap alongside locally sourced eats are everywhere. Carson's menu is begging for locally-sourced brews to accompany the menu's eclectic fare. As for the menu, the Jam/Brie is spot-on; the Fried Chicken Skins satisfied at '2-bites and done' (it's deep fried chicken skin and nothing else!) and the Butter Burger was above average. Blown away post-eats? Hardly. Would I return? Absolutely, to further sample the menu. Plus, LV is seriously lacking at eateries on this level of hip, urbane, fun fare. Felicia behind the bar took good care of us, too. She's personable, professional and exudes good energy.

My food had good flavor, but I thought the portions were small.  In fact I was still hungry when I got home.  That aside, I love the menu, lots of creative and I'm sure delicious items.  I didn't give 4 stars because of the portion size but also because of the volume of the music.  Ok, I get it, I might be a bit older than their normal clientele, but it felt like I was in a club, not a restaurant.  I brought my book to read while I ate but that was not possible.  I even think conversation wouldn't be comfortable.  Maybe it's just me but loud rock and roll (even good rock music) during dinner doesn't increase my appetite. It's just annoying.

Staff was very friendly and polite.  I might try again but next time I'll not be too hungry and bring ear plugs:-)",3x1sSKVaNr6wQdvCjiee0w,0,0,3,WcIbrZ-Dpa_f4EFomwzoHw

All of those were great, but I think my mac & cheese and my hubby's butter burger with tots were headliners as well.  I will say I thought the chicken skins would have had more flavor...probably wouldn't get those again but I did enjoy them, and my hubby loved them.

The awesome - bacon jam and veal meatballs. OMG. Get them both, please! The meatballs weren't attractive, but they tasted really great and were in the  most delicious foie gras sherry sauce.. I really wanted to lick the plate! 

Eh - Chicken skins were too spicy for us to really enjoy and honestly ate like pork rinds. I was expecting more and wasn't overly impressed. Basically think pork rinds in a basic spicy salt blend. Meh. The chili cheese dog flat bread was just OK as well. Not enough sour cream, chili was overly spicy and hot dogs weren't special. I like the idea of a chili cheese dog pizza but it wasn't as yummy as I was hoping. 

WTF - $3.50 coke served in an 8 ounce glass bottle. The same ones used at the high end restaurants on the strip. Who the hell wants 8 ounces of soda? I'm not surprised high end restaurants on the strip pull this but I was annoyed by this crap at an off the strip joint. I expected at least a 12 ounce glass bottle for that price.

Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.

I. Ordering
Between the 5 of us, we ordered 2 Butter Burgers - boursin, cheddar, lettuce, tomato ($14). We ordered it medium rare and it comes with spicy tater tots. We also ordered some of their cocktails. 

II. The burgers
The burger had too much cheese! It comes with boursin and 2 slices of cheddar, which wasn't melty (sad). It was overpowering. Trevor and I both took out one of the slices of cheddar. The patties were cooked perfectly and were nice, thick, and juicy. They had a great sear and were seasoned well. The bun was nice and gooey, but were a little too big for the burger patty. The burgers also had a crazy thick slice of tomato. The lettuce was on the bottom of the burger, which did a good job of catching the juice from the patty and keeping it in the burger = very good burger construction. What struck us most was how well balanced this burger was. All the flavors really worked well together.

III. The tots
The tots were good. They were well fried and had a nice spice to them. They had lots of herbs!

IV. Miscellaneous
This place is in downtown Las Vegas so parking can be a bit tricky. It's really cute inside and has a great vibe. We had to wait for a table, but they have this cool courtyard out back that has a firepit and lots of seating to make waiting comfortable. The drinks were really good. My daaaaaaaaaammmmn, Daniel! was particularly refreshing! Caleigh, our waitress was really great. She was funny, attentive, and just wonderful. She explained to us that they encourage sharing here and that all food comes out when it's ready. 

V. Value
The value is pretty average for this type of burger. It's more of a gourmet burger and the price matches the taste and quality of ingredients.

VI. The verdict
We really enjoyed this burger despite being incredible full (some of us had a buffet earlier and we all ate at Heart Attack Grill only 15 minutes before). That really says something about the quality of this burger. The ratings: 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4.

After standing awkwardly out front of Carson Kitchen trying to find the restaurant hours, one of the employees opened up the entrance door and welcomed us in. The place was pretty empty, so we decided to sit at the kitchen bar on high-top stools for a cool view of the chefs in action.

BAKED MAC & CHEESE ($12): I was initially dismayed by the small-ish portion size, but my eyes were bigger than my stomach. The mac & cheese is deceiving since it's so filling. I couldn't even finish the whole thing. For shame! Great flavor and thickness level is on point. 

GYRO TACOS ($10): My husband gobbled these tacos right up and was really satisfied with this dish.

Worth a return visit?
Yes! Carson Kitchen is a great local restaurant in DTLV.  Service was A-okay and the restaurant looked cool and trendy. I want to head back to try out more items on the menu for sure.

We had a number of dishes: the bacon jam, the beet salad, and the devils eggs were absolutely delicious.

I guess that wasn't bad for the shared plates but we each ordered a main plate and they arrived 20 minutes apart.  My boyfriend was already done by the time I got mine and I didn't even have anything to pick at.  Also, the two dinners lacked flavor and originality.  They made what would have been an otherwise 5 star, only 4.  I want to give them another shot for my son's bday dinner, but I can't take the chance.

5279460,2018-04-03,8,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"With news recently breaking that Carson Kitchen is poised for expansion, location number two set for Cory Harrwell's home state of Georgia, it was along with familiar dining companions that lunch was enjoyed at Downtown Las Vegas' most important Restaurant, a baker's dozen new or reprised plates representing one of the biggest  menu changes to date.

For once catching the full team on-site, Cory and Matthew Harwell covering both the pass and floor while Scott Simon headed up the kitchen, it was just prior to noon that a low table in front of the chef's counter was occupied, beverages filled quickly by a young woman wearing a Slayer T-shirt before Matthew presented the cleverly titled ""Communication Breakdown"" so-called for its international blend of Spirits that come across as crisp and unexpected as Led Zeppelin's 1969 track of the same name.

Holding onto classics like the Rainbow Cauliflower, Bacon Jam and Chicken Skins, many rarely or never offered on a Las Vegas Menu prior to Kerry Simon and Cory's downtown debut, Spring 2018 once again sees the staff at 124 South 6th Street putting novel ingredients in a more accessible context by way of Trout Rillette mixed with Mustard Seeds and Pistou intended to be spread atop bread while two types of Peruvian Peppers form the base of a vibrant Cream Sauce that gives Killer Shrimp v2.0 a texture not unlike Chinese Walnut Shrimp but with a whole lot more complexity.

Unafraid of bold flavors, the idea of umami not lost on Carson Kitchen's plates but a degree of refinement preventing dishes from being one-note like so many other American ""Gastro-Pubs,"" it was  once again embracing foreign spices that a dish titled Charred Octopus saw the team place tender Tentacles atop Potatoes like the Spanish before adding spreadable Italian Salami, a twist of Lime available to those looking to brighten things up though the better bet would seem to be pairing the dish to either the minty Strawberry & Cucumber Salad or ""Broccoli Crunch"" that features creamy Green Goddess Dressing marrying the Crucifer to toasted Seeds and dried Cranberries.

Taking on Tiki Drinks for Spring's only other new Cocktail, Matt's fondness for Velvet Falernum paying off with the fruity Tricky Vic that could easily see guests stumbling out the doors given its light drinking despite a lot of Alcohol, those looking for a good Vegetarian entree would do well to consider the seasonally inspired Wild Mushroom Flatbread while Omnivores will once again find 'Nduja on the Calabrian Flatbread that looks a lot like typical Pepperoni Pizza but tastes more like ""Meat Lovers"" with extra Cheese and Peppers.

Rarely impressed by Salmon, the fact that Fish at Carson Kitchen usually performs well as a result of good ingredients presented simply notwithstanding, it was alongside local Beer that the crispy skinned Filet was presented and filled its role as a Pescetarian/Soccer Mom staple, though those looking for something a bit less ""safe"" would be wise to invest in golden-brown Chicken Thighs served with Mint Chimichurri or a $20 Pork Chop that is big enough to share...or perhaps not considering just how well the juicy grilled Meat goes along with a topping of Rhubarb Chutney and base of Apple Mostarda.

Rounding out savories with another riff on a famous Fast Food Sandwich, the Mmm' Rib tangy and tasty despite its context being lost on diners who have not tasted the original in over two decades, it was only after finishing off an order of Cory's famous Macaroni and Cheese plus briny Spring Asparagus that Dessert was presented, the Banoffee once again in hibernation while Donut Bread Pudding  and the Bourbon Fudge Brownie are joined by smooth Panna Cotta topped in Granola and housemade Rhubarb Jam cooked down with Riesling.

***** While it is true that other Las Vegas concepts have managed to expand outside of Nevada there remains something special about Carson Kitchen's place in the community that makes Cory's success particularly important, Spring 2018 once again showing no signs of declining creativity or interest in changing a successful formula that has seen many imitators but none nearly as good.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,15,16,5,GH-jlW4Fx1q9U-xaOBPqWw

Once inside, we were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated. Our table for two looked like it belonged in a tiny house. Instead of adult chairs, we had little stools. As a curvaceous woman, I was like what kind of nonsense is this?! But I digress. Just know that there's no back support for the seats.

Our server was very attentive and accommodating. I wish I knew her name.

Right now, I'm refraining from eating meat, so coming here may not have been the best idea. Most of their vegetarian dishes are merely side dishes. Here's what we tried: Baked Mac & Cheese, Rainbow Cauliflower, and a Wild Mushroom Flatbread. The mac was the best dish of the night, the cauliflower was WAY too lemony, and the flatbread was just okay. The portions were small just like the little chair I was seated on.

5291380,2017-11-21,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"A nice spot to have dinner downtown.

Environment: The restaurant itself is in downtown Las Vegas and is small inside. However, it looks as if they have done some renovations in recent months as they now have a separate bar area which is great if you do not want to have to wait for a table (which they usually have a wait). Additionally, they do have an outdoor patio area in the back which tends to fill up fast as well.

Food: The food here is southern inspired and so far, everything that I have had here has been good. On my most recent visit, I tried the pork chop as well as the gyro tacos. The pork chop was cooked very well, and it was paired with a very nice sauce. Additionally, the fried chicken skins are a great appetizer. The only thing I will say is that the cocktails are below average. They taste too weak and even when I ordered a long island just tasted like lemonade. I typically stick to old-fashioned when ordering drinks here.

Service: Service has always been adequate and I have never felt like I was left waiting for someone to check up on me, and sitting at the bar, the bartender was sure to check up on us and refill our waters when necessary.

Overall, Carson's Kitchen is a nice, fun spot to grab dinner downtown, and while I wouldn't say it's my favorite spot it is somewhere I could see myself coming every couple month.",5fxjUT0sLg9ueMAYtn2PZw,0,0,4,isveWhhWF2LmH_65SNucQg

I've also been here for my post-workout birthday lunch and a few other times...all because of a bowl of vegetables!

Chicken:
Chicken thigh that's simple but tasty. The skin is crisp but not overcooked. It's quite juicy. I paired this with their broccoli which was a bit spicy 4.5/5

Rainbow Cauliflower:
This is my favorite item on the menu. I never thought I'd say that the best dish I've had was a bowl of veggies let alone cauliflower! What crazy friggin ish is that? As a matter of fact, I crave a bowl all the time now. Garlicky, a bit of spice and a bit citrusy. I could eat this all day. A glowing 5/5

Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak:
Tender slices of beef with pink on the middle. Earthy and nutty because of the cocoa espresso but without being bitter. 4/5

Swordfish: 
Flaky white fish with lemon, mint and basil. Refreshing, light and delicious 5/5

Young Beets:
I don't normally get too crazy over beets. The texture is mushy and tastes like dirt - CK was able to make me like beets. 4/5

Gyro Tacos:
Greek tacos with tender meat, feta and onions. Nothing complicated here. 4/5

Chicken Skin:
Comes with honey to dip the crunchy salty goodness that is chicken skin. Forget your healthy eating habits for a moment and indulge in this basket of magnificence. *crunch crunch crunch crack crack crack* was all I heard when this was brought to our table. 5/5

Tomato Stack:
Caprese salad, basically. 4/5

Mac n Cheese:
I don't know how they made such a simple comfort food to be better than most places. The crispy top, the creamy cheese sauce...yuuuummm!!! 5/5

Devil's Eggs:
Deviled eggs with caviar and pancetta. Absolutely delicious. With the caviar and pancetta, I thought this would be salty but I was wrong. Different textures in my mouth. 4.5/5

We arrive and are promptly greeted by the host, he was super nice. This place is small so there isn't a lot of seating but we were able to cozy up to the ""chefs table"" aka the bar type seating looking into the kitchen. This was fun!

Our server was very attentive and asked if it was our first time. When we told her no she quickly explained how it worked. Everything is basically ala cart so order several plates. 

Baked Mac & Cheese- AMAZING! So creamy and delicious! I cant tell you what was in it other than amazingness. 

Coco-Espresso NY Strip- AMAZING! WOW! The flavor was out of this world! The meat was tender and cooked perfectly. 

BBQ Burnt Ends- Wow! Soooo good. Flavor was extraordinary.

We arrived on a Friday at 5 PM and the place was relatively empty. The joint is small. Maybe 30-40 people can dine here at most. Several 4 tops and two large bar-ish tables. They're neat the bar, high top, and large parties or 3 pairs of dining couples are seated here.

On to the important stuff. The food!

Bacon Jam is the jam! A sweet, tangy, and mildly spicy BBQ bacon jam is delivered to your table, bubbling, and topped with Brie. It's served with crunchy garlicky grilled bread. If you order one thing here... MAKE IT THIS!

Jalapeño Poppers were meh. It is what it is. Not bad, not memorable. 

Pork Osso Buco. Succulent, flavor-able, fall of the bone tender. We ate this dish is two seconds. It was mouth sex.  MUST ORDER!

Broccoli Crunch: a light, fresh, crunchy, slightly sweet dish. The craisins and sunflower seeds kick this up a notch. A great side dish.

Pork Belly Carbonara was pretty bland as well. My mother thought the fried egg on top was cheese and got yolk everywhere.  That's what is memorable about this dish.

Gyro Tacos were flavorful and complex. They were just a bit dry. Tasty, but needing wetness.

Donought Bread Pudding was amazing. The donuts come from their neighbor O Face Donuts! Love learning about these little slices of community happening in Vegas (cause it's RARE - like Violet Eyes).

Carson Kitchen delivers. It's hit or miss and the offerings seem to change. It's hard to find as there isn't a street sign so GPS!!! Parking is on the street or in one of the nearby garages. I can't wait to go back!",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,10,9,4,4IUV5a0yWU-PkjFhN5YWFw

The items we had were:

Crispy Chicken Skins - Had a flavor similar to Five Guys Cajun Fries....was expecting something different but was more like to one of the grain crackers you get from Trader Joes....

Bacon Jam - A little bit too salty but was executed very well....

Bison Meatloaf Sliders - One of my favorite items we had. Excellent...only thing I may change would be the bread as it was very rich and filling. The flavor was there and the meat was right on.

Rainbow Cauliflower - Don't really fuck with cauliflower unless its (beer/tempura battered) but said fuck it why not and ordered this. This dish was excellent. Simple with flavors from the lemon juice and garlic. The burnt crispies of the garlic and the texture of the white broccoli were right on.

Baked Mac & Cheese - God damn this was rich in flavor. Very good and of course you can't go wrong with truffle oil as well....

Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak - For some reason I was expecting more of a sweeter bitter flavor or like a mole esque type of sauce but it ended up tasting more like curry or cumin...The steak was done perfect as medium..

Glazed Donut Bread Pudding - This dish is to share for about 4 people....a twist on the regular donut...just wished it was a little bit wetter...


The overall experience was a very positive one. They pride themselves as close to perfection as possible as they would not serve certain items on the menu that I wanted because they weren't prepared correctly....This place has potential through the roof and as their menu changes every 2-3 months it will for sure can tons of repeating foodies...me myself one of them",aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q,1,0,4,UdIyYiVNGPCCfoTatDhLvg

Tipped her well, everything was fine. The next day I find out it wasn't vegan. I wrote a very normal, not even 1 star review stating that although this place is a downtown favorite, I was served non-vegan food when I asked if it was vegan.

Owner messaged me and went on a complete psychopathic tirade. All his servers did was mess up - I was a server downtown before and I understand people aren't perfect. He was fixated on that I knew one of the servers who happened to have a sister who shared the physical description of her - or something. I'm still not quite entirely sure. It sounds like his server said we all knew her and were ""out to get her"", to save her skin when she messed up.

He posted a comment below, saying we went on Saturday (we went on Friday), we didn't tip well (I have my receipt), and that we were being rude to the servers we don't know, and that we were lying. I told him to please feel free to look at security cameras. 

He has now mentioned our names in public, threatened to sue me and reach out to my place of work, stalked my Yelp reviews for reviews I made with friends who had eaten dishes or when I was not previously vegan. In a long string of private messages, he has accused me or so many things. It's rather bizarre, and WTF-worthy. Dude, your servers just messed up. Should've apologized nicely, asked me to take it down. call it a day. Would've been very disappointing for someone with severe dairy allergies or someone who had been vegan for much longer than I have to have to go through with this.

I also know I'm not the only person who has received strange and terrible customer service here. :)",FcWu03iLuGYGHbFXO556pA,27,3,1,UdJxeTM7aipqhLIUI9diTw

Always made sure we had full drinks, coursed out our food timely, and made great recommendations on what to order.  We had a variety of items.  Fried green beans were delicious.  Young beet salad, not my fancy, but tasty. I'm not a fan of beets, personal preference, but I still enjoyed it.  Oxtail risotto, something new for me, but delicious.  Bacon jam was a bit sweeter than I had expected, but good.  It could use a bit more baked brie in it than they currently use to prepare the dish.

We also had the Rainbow Cauliflower which was delicious.  Many of the posters have said they didn't even like Cauliflower and found this to be awesome. We finished our meal with the NY strip steak which rivaled my top 5 steak experiences.  If you go with a bigger group you could probably try much more on the menu with their shareable menu.

When we arrived they seated us downstairs, the waitress said they ""didn't have propane for the heaters"".  It was so noisy that our group could not carry on a conversation, they were out of side dishes that we wanted to order,  when we received our meals, they were very small portions, even the dinner portions were pricey for what we got. The food was good,  but nothing was great. (We all ordered different things). Really disappointing since there are so many awesome places to dine in Vegas.

I cant say how much I enjoyed this place. From the cocktails to the food to even the staff- all made my and my friends experience amazing. 
The location, there is no huge sign declaring itself, but with the smells of grub and laughter from the folks outside, we found the entrace on carson between 6th and lv blvd. Which is important because the door is that easy to miss when you have the sun glaring in your face. The seating did take a bit more than I like especially on a Tuesday at 630 but rather than stay out on carson, we found walked through the restaurant to a door that lead to a surprise serene grassy backyard. It was equipped with wicker chairs and a fire pit. We also saw the stairs that lead to the second floor which is not being used due to the extremely high weather. I predict this will be the place to be in the winter time...beers + fire pit = thats where ill be!!!
On to the food...for appetizer we ate the wellington empanadas which smelled amazing as I sliced into those bad boys and we also had oxtail risotto and steak- the best combination and my stomach had no complaints. 
The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable about the food. Though there were a couple of times they almost took our plates before we could finish getting all the sauce with our empanadas but that was forgivable seeing as it looked like we were done but in reality it was us savoring each bite.
The cherry on top of the sundae was actually not ice cream BUT bread pudding made of doughnuts! I won't describe it because dessert is the point of the meal and why spoil the surprise.",15EfkL69gvmLmrvYGODDqw,3,3,4,EPvXpRaioUgygfyst5g-CA

We chose to try it based on yelp reviews.  We walked from Fremont street area and for a little bit thought it was a joke as the area was rather shady.  And then there it was!  

An obviously hipster hole in the wall with amazing food and unbeatable value! I was joined by a couple of food snobs and they couldn't believe how good it was.   I got the pork Ossobucco.  Very little fat and I could pull it apart with a fork.  Incredible flavor.  Others got the NY strip which was very tender and cooked perfectly.  The sides are shareable sized so we got the broccoli crunch, rissoto, and Mac &  cheese ....all incredible.

Definitely a very small place that maybe sits 40 people but nicely designed.  We just walked right in and got a table but I think we got lucky.

The fried chicken skins were good but not the best I've had, the skins were just a little denser than the ones they served at 595 craft.  The honey with the chicken skins definitely worked though.  The charred octopus was very tender, I just wish there was more octopus and less potatoes.  The aioli that paired with the octopus was a little too lemony for my taste.  We also got the new york strip which was impressive, the coffee flavors and the red wine made a great pairing.  We went to Gordon Ramsay steak the night before....and the NY strip was possibly better than the Wellington there in terms of tenderness of the meat and flavor.  We also got the mushroom flat bread which was executed well but maybe a touch under seasoned for me.  The black rice oxtail risotto and the mac and cheese were also excellent for carb options.  We tried two desserts the bourbon brownie and the bread pudding donut.  The bread pudding donut we couldn't stop eating.  We left behind half of the bourbon brownie, it was more like fudge, so super dense and heavy with bourbon flavor.  Overall, solid meal and I would definitely come back.

5523817,2017-06-06,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"This place came highly recommended by a friend of mine who was a Las Vegas hotel concierge. I was looking for a hip spot with an eclectic menu that included options for two friends with a dietary restriction (they are vegetarians). When I looked at the menu at Carson Kitchen, I thought this was the perfect spot with lots of meat centric options and a large variety of veggie options as well. They were able to accomodate our party of six and seated us inside (I called two weeks in advance). I never got to see their outdoors area but I would imagine the ambiance is more fun than inside. 

The only reason why I am giving Carson Kitchen three stars is because some of the dishes didn't live up to our expectations. The wild mushroom flatbread was oversaturated with some kind of barbecue sauce which is not listed at all on the menu so it was a little shock to the palate. The black rice and oxtail risotto was not good at all. That was sadly a disappointing dish. The crispy chicken skins were just o.k. After hearing so much about them, it was displeasing to find them so bland.

Now that I got that out of the way, I have to mention that the service was amazing. Everyone from the host to the server were great. Our drinks were on par and we had some really delicious dishes; bbq burnt ends, ""devil's"" eggs, tempura green beans, pig in a duvet, baked mac and cheese, and rainbow cauliflower. The absolute star of the show was the rainbow cauliflower.

5526824,2015-12-11,4,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"I absolutely adore being introduced to new places that were not previously on my radar, and Carson Kitchen is my latest obsession! I have put off writing this review for far too long... Carson Kitchen is where it's at! And for the last few months, it seems that's where I've been at, because of that fact - I.can't.stop.coming.back!!

If you haven't visited CK you're in for a real treat - in more ways than one! It's a tiny little restaurant on Carson Ave in Downtown LV. It's small and intimate, and that's one of the things I adore about the place; every time I've dropped in the place has been packed! The decor is somewhat industrial/hipster - the main dining area is filled with several small tables, a few counter height, and of course a bar area. When the weather is nice they open up the patio on the roof, which hosts an additional bar, a lot more seating, and some decent views of the area.

There are several options on the menu and everything is served ala carte. I've tried quite a few different things and feel like ALL of them are my favorite, they even just redid their menu this week and have added a couple more items to my ongoing favorites list. A couple MUST TRY items are: The Bacon Jam - it is dangerously addictive and the Mac & Cheese - it is my new guilty pleasure! It's the variety in menu offerings that differ from the norm (like fried chicken skins with honey) that really make my mouth water! I tend to always order just a few of the appetizers or sides and share them, but I always end up leaving satisfied and full. To top it off their prices are very reasonable.

Service here has never been a problem for me, the staff is wonderful and super friendly; my last few visits I've received hugs hello and goodbye from several of them. It seems everyone there enjoys their job, and it's a real family feeling among them!

If you are in the downtown area, or you're looking for a great place to try something delicious and new, you won't be disappointed with Carson Kitchen!

Side note: they'll bring you your check inside an old book - feel free to sign it, add a note, quote or drawing - leave your mark or make a future guest smile!",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,4,5,5,adMdpt8tQYQnI17Of0FoAw

At least my wife and I were able to get drinks and hang around their outdoor area in the back.  The whole thing was quite an eye opener for me.  Who would have thought even 5 years ago that something like this would be thriving on 6th St and Carson???  Amazing!

The dining area was a little cramped but still maintained a cool vibe.  The open kitchen, bustling servers and unique seating area kind of enhanced the experience.  I wouldn't come with more than a party of 4 until their outdoor and upstairs areas are done.  Our server informed us those areas would be complete in about a week.

I'd classify the fare as ""New American"".  Kerry and his staff do some really interesting twists.  Their ""Wellington Empanada"" was a delicious way to start the meal.  I enjoyed their take on the typical empanada crust.  It was light with some crunch and soaked up the excellent sauce on the plate nicely.  

My wife gasped when she saw they offered ""Crispy Chicken Skins"" and ordered it almost before our server got out the word ""hello"".  Breaded and deep fried chicken skin isn't exactly clean eating but holy shit was it awesome.  Maybe chicken skin really is the new bacon!  It was a glorious way to swiftly kick my diet right in the balls.  Both of us weren't really big on the smoked honey dipping sauce it came with and opted to use the rich empanada sauce instead.

We shared the ""Rabbit Ragu"" and the ""Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak"" done rare.  The rabbit was delightful and the sauce delivered a surprisingly spicy kick.  Thankfully, the spaghetti was made of squash.  I needed some vegetables after my mini guilt trip on the chicken skins :P The steak was a little more medium rare than rare but the sauce and light espresso flavor made up for it.

Located right next to Downtown Fremont, this is a must stop from now on if I'm coming downtown.  

1.  Everything on the menu is under $20, including the NY Strip which was cooked perfectly.

2.  Ambience level 1000.  The dining area is small, but with chairs lined around the kitchen and bar it works really well.   Small open room where you can see everything going on.  Very hipster atmosphere, I loved sipping on my Towns End near fire pit out back while we waited for our table.

3.  All of the food we sampled was amazing.  The restaurant encourages family style dining, so we ordered several things off the menu and let the entire table sample a little of everything.  Definitely the way to go here.  

4.  Extremely well mixed and delicious cocktail creations.  The cocktails are a bit pricey at $10-$13 but worth it.  Everything I tried was really refreshing and tasted amazing, really can't wait to come back and try everything I didn't have on my first visit. 

A couple of the highlights for me were the Fried Chicken Skins and Honey, the perfect balance of sweet and salty.  I was really impressed by the Fish Fillet sandwich also, so goooood!!

Drinks:  Artisan cocktails that are on the menu are great. Not over-the-top. Straight forward ingredients that let the spirits shine through. 

Ambiance:  Trendy, inquisitive, rustic. Noise level is high because of the small size and proximity to other diners. My party sat at the chefs table/bar, and it was really interesting watching them create the dishes.

I walked in and the entire restaurant got quiet, like they haven't seen a light-skinned attractive Black female before.

He looked at me like he didn't even know me nor did he acknowledge me as a Black female barber of A Cut  Above the Rest barbershop... Really BROTHER?

First, the restaurant is downtown and away from the chaos of the strip and it's tucked in a little store front. It was pretty easy for the Uber to find and not a hassle to get picked up or dropped off. 

The venue is small, very intimate, and there is lots of table sharing. When I arrived there was a 20 minute wait but I was able to find 2 chairs at the bar for my friend and I. If you must wait for a table, there is a waiting area outside the restaurant in the back. The restaurant was really clean and quiet. The patrons were mostly dressed for dates. 

I had the deviled eggs, chicken skins, tacos and a sangria. Each item was made to order and arrived at different times. They were all seasoned and prepared extremely well. The bartender was really really polite and offered great suggestions on both food and beverage items.

5583252,2014-08-11,4,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Carson Kitchen is a welcome addition to downtown Las Vegas.  
(Rating = 3.5 )
First the food - I came for lunch and due to the price point and the fact that my stomach is often smaller than my brain thinks it is, I decided to try the two most commonly mentioned appetizers instead of entrees.  I ordered the bacon jam/brie with toast and the crispy chicken skins.

The bacon jam/brie is good.  It didn't knock my socks off but I admit there was something addictive about it and I couldn't stop eating it either. I wish there was more brie (just a small puddle in the middle of the jam was all I could see) and I wish the jam was just a bit less sweet and more smokey more brie would definitely improve this dish.  I would rate it a 4 out of 5 except the toast too dry and toasted for my preference creating too crunchy of a surface that didn't absorb any of the jam. so 3.5 Price 14.00

The Crispy Chicken Skins is a decadent fried treat accompanied by a honey dipping sauce.  The skins themselves are delicately fried so that the coating doesn't overpower the taste of the skin.  Dipped in the honey they were very good.  Dipped in the bacon jam made them even better as the taste of the skin nullified some of the sweetness of the jam and the bacon flavor went very well with the light saltiness of the skin.  4 out of 5. Price 5.00  

Price point - The meal above plus an iced tea cost me $22.00 for lunch and to be honest with you the value simply wasn't there.   Even for downtown and especially for the location.  I don't feel like I received $19.00 in food quantity combined with quality.   The bacon jam was the culprit costing more than most of the sandwiches. I felt the price of the chicken skins was reasonable. 3 stars

Note: The below is for info only and did not change my score.

The ambiance is that of a busy bar. The dining area is small with several community sized tables and the setup is clearly intended to foster socializing with tablemates/bar mates. There appears to be 2 bars with seating and a handful of tables.  There is an upstairs that is open on the roof however it won't open for lunch until September or October when it is cooler.  The tables are very close together and it is difficult to move about without bumping a chair or a server scurrying to keep up with the crowd.  The location is in the recently reclaimed hotel on Carson/6th right behind the post office.  There is zero signage on Carson street to let you know they are a restaurant or even open and the windows are tinted so you can't see until you get very close.

The service at the bar was great and the bartender very friendly and informative.  The check comes in a book which has signatures and notes from other patrons written in the book, an interesting touch.    I didn't get a direct interaction with the waitstaff but observing them they all seemed very attentive to their tables and seemed to be processing food and orders quickly.  

There were a few other menu items that look good and I will be back, hopefully able to move the score up a bit.  The bread pudding looked delicious.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,0,0,3,NSyhga8latWfCF9Si4snRQ

 We sat at the chefs table and ordered beverages and had to order the bacon jam with brie upon the suggestion of other Yelpers and our server. The bacon jam was amazing and has my vote for best appetizer, the brie baked right in really makes the dish. 

I chose the butter burger and it was very good, the only thing is the tomato didn't have salt or pepper so the tomato flavor really wasn't coming out, but that's a minor complaint. 

Dessert was really good and one must check out the mirrors in the restrooms as they are so cute.

As far as atmosphere goes it is a very small restaurant, chairs are high stools with no back on them, one men's and one women's bathroom, and there is limited parking (not uncommon for downtown).  

I would recommend this place to friends looking to have a small short meal or friends looking for somewhere to have drinks.  If you're looking for an intimate sit down and enjoy a big dinner setting I would go somewhere else.

Hands down, best food all weekend. We got the bacon jam, and the Green, Eggs, and Ham flatbread. The bacon jam - delicious and I'm now ruined for life because this place is so far away and I can't have this every time I'm craving it. There is A LOT of bacon jam, so you will probably (definitely) need to ask for a little more bread, which they told us to just let them know if we needed more. 

The pizza - oh my goodness the pizza - it was amazing. It was crispy and flavorful and perfect and I was craving more, but was too stuffed from a weekend of over-indulgence to get seconds.

The crispy chicken skins. Had to send them back. I guess I'm not a fan of eating something that reminds me of the crispy bits at the bottom of the seafood basket from Long John Silver's. Smothering it in honey didn't help much. I'm sure other people would love this. Just too much fried goodness for me.

If you order the veal meatballs - prepare for a very rich dish. The use of peas was a nice bit of sweetness to compliment the savory foie gras cream. 

Dessert - well I had to have it. All four options sounded so unique. They had me at 'macaron' with the rhubarb sammie. More like GIANT macaron. I've never seen one so big. It's what made up the sandwich part of the 'sammie'. I loved how it wasn't overly sweet.

We were lucky to land a parking spot right in front of the these businesses. Parking is sparse in this area and if you aren't paying attention, you can drive right by.  We walked in and were promptly seated at the bar. I also noticed that there is bar that you can sit at and watch the chefs making your food. For lunch time the place was not busy at all. There were just a few folks gathered around the chefs bar and a few tables were filled. The space is pretty small and intimate. There is also a second level, so perhaps more people were seated upstairs. Our bartender Chris was really helpful and basically explained that their menu changes with each season. The current menu is for spring. He told us that it is better to choose a couple of different items on the menu since the idea is to share the food. We viewed the menu and started with chicken skins, bacon jam and shrimp dunderi. We anxiously awaited the arrival of our food. Well, let me say I made I huge mistake in ordering the chicken skins (I thought I read chicken wings). They were accompanied with a honey sauce which was tasty but the whole skin thing (Yikes) I was not into. Thank goodness the bacon jam made up for it. This dish had carmelized bacon with melted brie and most Yelpers had raved about it.  We spread this delicious combination on the small baguette's they provided and experienced melt in your mouth goodness!  Next came the shrimp dunderi which came with only with two prawns and a ricotta style pasta. This was flavored with limoncello and was delicious. I think they could have spared at least six prawns since the dish ran $14!! This brings my review down to three stars.  Since we were at work we could not imbibe any alcohol although Manny the other bartender did try to tempt us. We received great, personal service which was appreciated by two first time customers.

Unfortunately, time was ticking and we had to get back to work so we were not able to try anything else although there were some other items that looked interesting. I would like to go back and sit at the chef bar as I think it might make the experience more enjoyable.",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,2,2,3,m99NXbVl3j9cRH_WnccdVg

Our starter was their famous chicken skins with smokey honey sauce ( a must). Our accompaniment was the veal meatballs (sooo good). Our drinks were great with DAAAAAAMN Daniel and 68+1 being our choices, and were so good, that we had a second drink with dinner.

Others in the group find the food to be great. I generally don't like hip joints with elevated prices but that seems to be a trend with the affluent or wanna be affluent.

I ordered:
- crispy chicken skin ($9): a bit over seasoned and powdery. We didn't finish them.

 - black rice & oxtail risotto ($14) - huge rim on a small bowl. Just tasted warm with no flavor. TJ refused to try it because she said it looked gross.

My friend TJ's bill was $33 and she ordered:
- 2 sunrise beers ($9 for 2)
- cauliflower - looked like a jumbled bowl of steamed colorful cauliflower. She said it wasn't good 
- tater tots - legit just plain tater tots.

We love oxtail and were disappointed by the lack of flavor in the dish along with a small amount of oxtail. The rice was a little undercooked too.

Melted in my mouth!! We topped it all off with some bourbon chocolate cake with ice cream.   The ice cream appears to have bacon inside. That's a whole lotta good there.

This was my second Vegas visit where our team incorporated Carson's- and it won't be our last. 
We waited about 15 minutes before they were able to seat us. No big deal, we cozied up to the outdoor fire pit, and laughed, drinks in hand.
Upon being seated, our server set us up with a fresh round of drinks. I had been elected to place our tables order. (This is trouble)
There were seven of us, so we ordered a ton:
Fried chicken skins: ok, hear me out on this one. I'm fully aware that chicken skins are the least healthy party of the chicken, but equally, they may be the most delicious. Especially when you deep fry them, and serve them with a smoky honey. (I love honey!)
Three different burgers: butter, bison, not sure the last. that we cut like a pizza and shared. The sweet potato tater-tots were a table wide hit.
Bacon Jam (this is an epic dish of bacon, some fruit, and Brie that you spread on crispy bread slices). Highly addictive. Completely unhealthy, totally worth it.
Spicy shrimp: crispy and coated with a spicy mayonnaise, these were a popular, rich treat.
Truffle Mac and cheese: mind blown- this was amazing. Unsurpassed deliciousness coated in cheese and baked to nice brown top. 
Braised pork belly: this was a close second to the Mac and cheese. Very close. It was succulent, tender, flavorful and I had more than my fair share ;)
Tri-color cauliflower: this was tangy and a wild adventure. Also, the healthiest thing we ordered.
Gyro-tacos: sounded weird, but these were superb. Flavorful meat, and the prefect tzatziki sauce.
Wild mushroom flatbread: perfectly crisp, great portions of toppings and yummy!
I was a few Tito's and cranberry in, so I'm not sure if I missed anything else. I feel like I may have excluded something.
Oh, then dessert. Bread pudding Bacon Icecream. (Never had anything close) The chocolate cake, also amazing. 
As you can gather from reading the above, we enjoyed everything, and still kept eating. Tales of my dietary trespasses here will forever be told- and I'm not ashamed of any of them!

Between all of us, we got the Sunday fried chicken sandwich, black rice and oxtail risotto, Mac and cheese, beet salad, and beef sliders. The black rice and oxtail risotto is different from most other risotto I've had. I was not a big fan of the black rice because it reminded me of uncooked rice. And flavor was good though and the oxtail was tended. The chimichurri green stuff on the oxtail was a nice contrast to the creamy risotto sauce because it added a zesty kick. The beet salad was refreshing. The Mac and cheese had a strong truffle component which I liked. The beef slider were okay for me. A little too much on the sweet side. The Sunday fried chicken sandwich was good. The chicken was juice and the batter was the right amount of crispy. We also got the bourbon brownie for dessert. The brownie was not soft.

Food here is good, as was the presentation. Came here with a friend and ordered the bacon jam and tempura green beans (per yelp mentions). My friend really enjoyed the bacon jam, but I wish they gave more bread.. The tempura green beans were really tasty, esp with the chili cream cheese that came with it. We also got the short rib grilled cheese (I'd skip this one, it had a weird taste to me) and the black rice oxtail risotto (yum). Overall very tasty and such cute presentation.. you really can't go wrong.

The real winner here was the glazed donut bread pudding. We also ordered the bourbon fudge brownie but you can skip that and just order two of the bread puddings. The glaze was the pièce de résistance.. according to the menu, it is a three rum caramel and vanilla anglaise. YUM. Get two, or get three and give one to me I won't ask any questions. ;)

The only thing here is that it's in downtown so parking is not great. Also I think they wanted to sit my party of two at the bar but we requested a table. They said they usually get busy and don't allow parties of two to sit at tables but since it was a slow night, they were able to accommodate.

Both times I dined we started with the Crispy Chicken Skins and the Bacon Jam. I am not into the chicken skins, but almost everyone I went with both times loved them. They are salty and the honey is smokey and sweet. I get the allure, but I am not into the chicken flavor. The bacon jam however, is definitely my jam! You MUST start with this and then slather it onto whatever you order. It's packed full of flavor and unbelievably delicious. It comes out piping hot, so try not to dive right in.

On to the entrees! The Secret Sunday Chicken sandwich is an upscale take on a Chick-Fil-A favorite. The chicken is moist and fried to perfection with a delicate and light batter. The spicy pickle aioli is perfection, I would be in trouble if they bottled this and the jam. Speaking of the jam, don't be afraid to add it to your sandwich! I wasn't a fan of the spice used on the tater tots, so those fell short for me. I've also had the short rib stroganoff and it was just OK. The flavors weren't as rich and creamy as I had hoped and something tasted a little off. I did however spice it up with some bacon jam, I may have a problem. I would skip the stroganoff and try a burger next time.

Overall, there were some hits and misses, but the hits overshadowed the misses for me. I find the service to be a bit spotty, but the food is worth a try if you're downtown.",p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ,0,0,4,jALL43cor2W636tSzF8c_A

The service was cheerful and helpful Matt, the General Manager, ensured our order was well packed and we were completely taken care of from entrance to exit.

Some of the most amazing flavors I've ever tasted. 

You MUST, I say MUST, order the bacon jam with baked Brie served with toasted baguette slices. It's sweet and zesty, and most of all bacon-y!!! It was close to the best thing I've ever eaten.

This place is small and hip. Has great service and a great atmosphere. If you sit at the bar you can watch the chefs cook.

Our waiter mentioned to us that they will be changing their menu every 8 weeks; that statement will bring me back here next time I am in Vegas. I can't wait to try their new menu items.

5769924,2018-03-10,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Fantastic experience. 

We walk in and there's a 10 to 15 minute wait so we go to the bar and get a couple of drinks.  The drink menu is eclectic and cute.  A good variety to suit any mood but not large so you're not standing there and reading a menu for 10 minutes debating the merits between drinks that all sound more or less the same anyway.

We were seated right in the ballpark estimated time at the counter in front of the kitchen.  Now, being a chef myself, I love this location but I will say that the seats were ever so slightly uncomfortable.  I don't think there was enough leg clearance for those of us with longer legs and I found myself with my feet all over my friends purse.  

The food.  Yes, it's good.  Like, really really good.  They pace the items so that whatever is ready first will come first.  I like this but I was also kind of disappointed.  We ordered the chicken thighs which take 20-30 min.  This made us think that we'd get this dish last but we got some other things afterwards.  It made us think that maybe they forgot or maybe it wasn't put through.

The food is absolutely delicious though.  Everything we got was very tasty and full of flavor.  The black rice risotto with oxtail is my dream dish.  AMAZING!

I have only been here once, but definitely need to go back to try all of things I wanted to try but simply ran out of tummy room for.  I went with three other people and we ordered a bunch of things and shared.  We got the tempura green beans, jalapeño poppers, crispy chicken skins, baked mac n cheese, bacon jam, devil's eggs, and the chili cheese dog flatbread.  I think that covers it... everything was excellent and the standout for me was the tempura green beans.  Everyone in my group had a different favorite, though.  The crispy chicken skins were also awesome, but definitely needs to be shared between a few people.  I loved our server as well.  He was so nice and helpful.  The place seems very tiny for what I'm used to seeing in Vegas, maybe like 10 tables altogether plus seating at the bar?  We arrived at 3pm so it was kind of an off hour and we were seated right away.  I can imagine with how delicious the food is that there might be a bit of a wait at times during more normal dinner time hours.  The kitchen is open so you can see the chefs at work.  No secrets here!  The only bad thing I have to say is that one staff member who appeared to be a manager of sorts was kind of a dick.  We had requested some more bread for the bacon jam from our server and this manager guy was the one to bring it over.  He kind of flopped it on the table and said ""bread"" with a grimace and walked away.  I've had a couple friends who have also eaten here recently share about similar encounters.

5804983,2015-11-04,2,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,"Came here with a group of friends, seven of us total, and had we not made a reservation, it might have been tough to fit, so if you've got a group, think ahead. Disclaimer: I'm vegetarian with an egg allergy, so my access to the menu was pretty limited, and that's all I've got to go on for the review.

The food was decent, but struck me as a bit vinegar-heavy. The dishes were ordered to be shared, and of what was ordered at the table I had the Mushroom Ceviche, the Roasted Young Beets salad, and the Rainbow Cauliflower. I would probably have loved the flatbread and the tempura green beans, but both have egg in them, alas. (And then had to deal with delicious-looking green beans being dangled in front of me because the table ordered not one, but TWO orders of it. It's apparently quite good.) Of what I ordered, the Roasted Young Beets was my favorite, but was similar to roasted beet salads I've had elsewhere. The mushroom ceviche was nice, but a smidge more vinegar-laden than I would have liked, but then again, maybe that's a ceviche thing--I haven't had any previous experience with ceviche, so I had no idea what to expect going into that dish. The Rainbow Cauliflower was oddly and inexplicably vinegar-y tasting when it should have been more lemony, so I'm wondering if maybe having the ceviche where I could smell it was affecting my ability to truly taste it. The cauliflower was ultimately abandoned by the rest of the table in lieu of other things, so it kind of fell flat for us (I finished it anyway, though; I usually love cauliflower).

From what I remember of what the non-vegetarians ordered, they had the Cocoa Espresso NY Strip, the Bone-In Pork Belly, the Tempura Green Beans, the Baked Mac & Cheese, the Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto, and I believe an order of The Devil's Eggs. Of these, a second green beans was ordered and the mac & cheese and the risotto disappeared fairly quickly. I seem to recall a lot of anticipation for the pork belly that didn't quite appear to deliver, but I do believe the ones that had the deviled egg liked it. Again, I am not sure. They also got a Bourbon Fudge Brownie to share for dessert, which didn't go over well with the ones that don't appreciate salt in their sweets and weirded out Mr. Piano a little with the bacon ice cream. I'm mostly just mentioning this in case it's helpful; it doesn't make sense to work any of the stuff I couldn't try into my rating.

The service, however, is top notch! Our waitress Felicia was really friendly, great with making recommendations (including recommendations for my dietary restrictions & allergy), and seemed to really enjoy working there, which can be a real breath of fresh air :) She also had some fun recommendations for things to do or see around town, which was nice of her. The setting of the restaurant itself is pretty tastefully done and I like the décor--it's a cute place.

Overall, really awesome service, but they need more (and perhaps better) options for vegetarians/vegans, or they need to make the options that sound like they'd be vegetarian/vegan actually be so. I had previewed the menu before we came, and thought there was more I could eat, like the flatbread. Also, a good traditional tempura batter can easily be vegan, so there's really no reason to have people making sad eyes at crispy, delicious green beans that they can't eat, guys :( I'd probably be okay eating here again if I found myself in Vegas again with friends who wanted to go, but I'd have to have a snack first. Or hit up O-Face Donuts next door immediately afterwards (vegan donuts).",tUsrdWOWjOGf_hTsjMKycA,0,0,3,uBRWEopGhl6ffX1W9fWlcw

I asked the waitress to repeat it and she laughed. Like its  a joke that you expect my 16 month old to stay seated at a booth.

Bacon jam with baguette- 5 stars on first try, but went down to a 3 for me. Second visit, the bacon jam was waaaaay sweeter, and it almost ruined it for me since I had been obsessing over it for months. 

Crispy chicken skins- 3 stars. This stuff is good, but I've definitely had better.

Rainbow Caultiflower- 5 stars all the way. This stuff is sooooo good, I wish I could eat it everyday. Unfortunately, they were out on my second visit.

We travel to find new places based on good food, good service, with a great vibe. I stumbled on a review of this trendy hipster movement that seems to be happening in towns from coast to coast. We have found many. We now have another one to add to our favorites list. One block from Fremont street you will find carson kitchen. From the outside, you would never guess what they are doing indoors. We went there for lunch on a Thursday. It was busy, with about a 10 minute wait. The whole time we talked to the hostess who was so excited to be leaving NV and putting her food biology degree to use. We wish her well ! We were seated at a big table with 3 other customers. Some people might not like this, we love it. We're people - people. Never met a stranger ! We were greeted by "" Felicia "" our waitress. She went over the menu, got our drinks going, came back to figure out what we were going to try. This place has a great "" share "" options. A great way to try many items. We started with the fried chicken skins, ( don't judge us ) delicious!!! Had to order the lamb tacos, started talking with the other friends"" we were seated with, and before long we were sharing food. We ordered the bacon jam with brie, grilled artichoke! Our neighbors ordered green beans and mac and cheese, oh my !! I've had a lot of artichokes and this one was the best. Everything we had was amazing !! Our kids were flying into town in a few days. We were thinking where we were going to take them for dinner. With so many options in Vegas we have never gone back to the same place, yet alone the same place in the same trip. But that's what we did. We came back on Saturday night. Had a bit of a wait, even after we called. No reservations, but they will add your name 20-30 min out. If took a bit longer because we requested "" Felicia "" again. Our dinner order: chicken skins( don't judge us again ) lamb taco ( lettuce wrapped because of the GF daughter) still tasty, black rice risotto, devil eggs, two orders of artichokes, and ended with whiskey desert drinks and the best bread pudding ever tasted. I can't say enough about this place. Do a few things really really well and you will be successful on many levels. Add amazing wait staff, which they have and it gets even better.

Only reason for three stars instead of five: 
Last visit, I cracked a tooth on a piece of bone. 
I didn't want anything because of it, but mentioned it to the manager AND the waiter, as they both were at the table asking about our experience when it happened. 
Neither responded, except for asking if I was done with the plate. 
Plus, we waited 45 minutes for a table , while there was two 'reserved' tables. Neither was occupied when we left 1 1/2 hours later. It is a small, cozy place, but they kept saying we couldn't sit at the tables for 4 when we only had three people in our party. The ironic thing was we were seated eventually seated on a table for 6.

I ordered the Apricot Cider and we started with the Chicken Skins. They are served with a spicy honey that made me feel like a kid again, but with that grown up vibe. I seriously loved chicken nuggets with honey when I was growing up. 

My friend and I split the Buddy Burger, cooked medium rare, and the Roasted Rainbow Cauliflower. Yum.com!!! It was pretty enough to take a picture, which I did! The burger was juicy and fabulous, cooked perfectly, and those tater tots with spicy ketchup? Am I in Narnia?

Gastropubbish hipster place with a menu to match (oxtail risotto, chicken skins, etc). 

Coolest thing about the restaurant is the resto itself and the location its in. Great bar!  The neighborhood is in a revamped area of old town Vegas and the building itself is a renovated hotel where other businesses share office space. They string up lights outside in the patio with a nice little fire pit. 

BUTTER BURGER - $14 (2.4/5) - The handful of tater tots were good. Ordered the burger medium rare and it came out tough, chewy, more like a well kneaded meatloaf burger. Not really buttery or juicy, on the smaller side. Should rename it the MEH-tloaf burger. Didn't think there was alot of value or anything special about it.

I got the NY Strip. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had and the price was great. Didn't catch any cocoa-espresso flavor though. The size of the serving was generous. I asked for medium and got medium. The flavor on the outside was mouth-watering. Seriously!

I also got asparagus but it wasn't what I was expecting. I was hoping for grilled asparagus but this was really a salad with a little lettuce, bite-size asparagus pieces, and some really yummy pickled onions, and huge croutons that were really good. And the dressing was great. 

My husband got Mac n cheese and he said it was better than my aunt's (which we always use as a measuring tool). I agree. It was really good. You can tell the cheese was fancy. Since they encourage you to get a lot of dishes and share, it could be fun for people who have extensive tastes. My husband doesn't eat red meat and doesn't like asparagus so sharing wasn't really our plan and his serving of Mac and cheese was smaller than what he was hoping for so I didn't want to eat more than a bite. But still, it was awesome and I want to go back next time I'm in town. 

Oh - The place is tiny and can get crowded. But we came without reservations at 6:30 on a friday evening and were seated within 5 minutes.

Atmosphere? Some folks are dressed super fancy while others are not. It's definitely a mix.

After waiting an hour and longer, we finally got seated upstairs in the patio. It was a nice area! I loved the decor and the chill atmosphere. 

A lot of the entrees and dishes are meant to be shared like tapas, so we ordered a crap load to share. For appetizers, we got the:
- Gyro Tacos (YUM!)
- Deviled Eggs (Can't ever go wrong with these!)
- Fried Chicken Skins (DELICIOUS! It tastes like chicharrones)
- Bacon Jam (Skippable, but that's just me! The rest of my table liked it, but I wasn't a fan of it. We ran out of bread and they charged us another $1 for an additional plate of 4 tiny pieces)

As for entrees, we got the the steak and the lamp chops. The steak was delicious and I'd definitely recommend getting it! It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The lamp chops were good too.

The entrance is a little obscure and there are two doors right next to each other, so it's a little difficult to figure out which one is the one you can enter through. We approached and tried the door and when it didn't open we walked around to the other side of the building and then had to walk back and realized there was another door right next to the one I had just tried. When we walked in, the hostess mentioned seeing us miss the door and walk around and I kind of wondered why didn't she didn't come out to let us know instead of just watching us wander around the building. I saw this same thing happen to a number of other customers as well, so they might need a sign or something. 

Once seated, our server was very attentive and friendly. We quickly ordered some cocktails and sodas and he let us peruse the menu for a while. There aren't a huge number of menu items to choose from, but almost all of them caught my eye, so we decided to share a number of items amongst the group. 

Items selected: 
-Cocoa espresso NY strip steak 
-Devil's eggs with caviar and crispy pancetta
-Crispy chicken skins with a smoked honey dipping sauce
-Beef Wellington empanadas
-Butter burger spicy tater tots 

Everything we tried was great. The strip steak was perfectly cooked and had a nice rich flavor. The deviled eggs were a highlight of the meal. They were rich and a great twist on the typical deviled egg. The chicken skins were very rich and I'd recommend sharing these with a larger group to save you a stomachache. The Beef Wellington empanadas were very tasty, although I did feel a little more sauce would have enhanced the dish quite a bit. The butter burger was very basic, so I probably wouldn't order this dish again.

I don't believe that we made reservations,  but we got there right when they were opening for dinner.  Got a parking spot right in front of the restaurant,  and we were seated right away.  Location is in downtown close to Fremont St.  Charming restaurant with good food and service.

Here is a rundown of the above average fare we shared that evening.

Crispy Chicken Skins were delicious!  I'd order that item of crispy goodness again!  (4.5 stars)

Tempura Green Beans were good.  I don't think you would be disappointed with this either.  (3.5 stars)

Rainbow Cauliflower was something that I enjoyed more than the Tempura Green Beans.  (4 stars)

Pork Belly Carbonara was okay, but not as good as I thought it would taste.  (3 stars)

Butter Burger with Tater Tots was delicious!  Try it for yourself!  (4.5 stars)

Pork Osso Buco was okay.  Again, I was expecting more out of this choice.  Was good though.  (3.5 stars)

Carson Kitchen in Las Vegas is a fine dining option.  I recommend you check them out too.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,8,8,4,VrJeRWRPBjATXxhDhn7pqg

Carson Kitchen was a pleasant surprise. After we walked around the block a couple times trying to find the entrance (it's a little confusing) we were promptly seated by the window for a party of 3. We were entertaining our friend from out of town and had just come from the Mob Museum (highly recommended). The place was packed, so we were delighted to be seated quickly. 

Our server was very friendly and helpful. He suggested a few dishes and was spot on. The plates are small portions, like tapas. They are shareable. We ordered green beans and a wonderful, tender steak. It was amazing! The guys each had a domestic beer, but I ordered a cider based on the server's recommendation. I forget the name (I'll add the name later when I find it). It was an imported cider from Swizterland. Wonderful and refreshing! The atmosphere is a modern, trendy pub with unique artwork. Very hipster. 

We loved Carson Kitchen, but unfortunately they lost tons of points with me after I saw dogs laying around in the dining room. Yes, DOGS! LIVE DOGS!!! This disgusted me and I couldn't help, but think there was dog hair in my food.  

I've since have discussed this with the owner who tells me he only allows service dogs in. Although, there isn't a lot of regulations on how to determined whether a dog is a service dog or not. He has assured me he has trained his staff and looked into the legal requirements. It turns out the owners of the dogs do not have to provide any proof. Just about anyone can walk in with a dog and say it's a service dog. It most likely was service dogs we saw that night. 

I can understand business owners delimma. If they question whether a dog is a service dog they run the risk of offending the owner. If they refuse to let them in the risk a lawsuit. When they do let them in other customers, such as myself, are turned off. I've also learned most service dogs are used for depression and anxiety, not physical disabilities. There seems to be a lot more ""service dogs"" around. I'm seeing dogs in hair and nail salons, restaurants, and I even saw one in a Target that had a grocery section! 

If I do return to Carson Kitchen and there happens to be dogs in the dining room I will choose to go elsewhere.",lQIRECQHOD_pI18z4Yh4fQ,0,0,3,ZZh9WZcnL6-6AZNJmY3vtA
5965377,2018-01-14,0,2iTsRqUsPGRH1li1WVRvKQ,We went  on a Friday so it was packed and had a 45 min wait. We waited in the bar area and when two seats opened up at the bar we went to go sit there but were told they use the bar as regular dinner service area so we went back to sitting on the window sill. We ended up being seated at the bar anyway and we ordered four items.  They bring food out when it's ready as opposed to bringing it all out together.  They forgot our salad so we cancelled it and ordered a dessert instead but that was taking a long time so we cancelled that too.  The Mac & cheese was amazing and so were the tempura green beans. Food good but service not good.,20RdU_fn50Ju60q6-J9dcw,0,0,3,6adX0wXcDXGGxVlDOXgNXw

They keep it simple, no fancy bacon or lobster or anything like that, just literally macaroni and cheese, a tiny hint of truffle and a little bread crumb on top. It was incredible! We also tried the mushroom flatbread, green beans, and gyro tacos, all which were wonderful! Dipping sauce for the green beans was great, big chunks of cream cheese mixed with some sort of chili sauce. Our server, Brittany, made excellent recommendations and was super personable! Highly recommend this place. Also heard they are working on a rooftop patio which will be fun. Can't wait to come back and try more. Great spot!",jJtMKVIUzdDG4xagIOSraA,0,0,5,ZA6A9pPFOnhmMPf7CHG3lw

All of the food is great. Service is awesome, atmosphere is poppin, inclusive, young, fun and inviting. 
I highly recommend the fried chicken sandwich. You can also get the turkey burger without the bun (on a crisp bed of lettuce).
The cook was very personable and recommended other places to go later.
Check it out!",_JJPDaa6oV5NRxC57B0ahg,1,1,5,pqpzNdcrn6ES2mIhSh3ffQ

The setting, the staff, all on point. Make sure you order the baked Mac n Cheese too. Then whatever bacon jam you have left over, smeer it on the baked Mac n Cheese! Major mums indeed.

Very small place, they are going to have to expand. Best dinner so far on this trip. Glazed Donut bread pudding was even better than it sounds.",b-aH-XvGb3XNdH4DJGyRgw,0,0,5,CWyGG66wp83upp3vtYrNyg

Since the disappointing dining experience?I gave this place two stars. To my surprise, the business owner left me a message the next day and his tone was full of sarcasm. I drop the rating to one star because of his attitude.",qxFeoBgxgkKh6IBmaRHU2w,3,1,1,SHmMAZdzgLDU-50e9SesaQ
