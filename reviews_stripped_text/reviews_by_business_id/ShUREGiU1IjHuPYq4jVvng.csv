If you can get past the odd, ""grandma's bathroom"" aroma of the casino, then you won't mind the semi dark, and much quieter restaurant that is completely closed off from the rest of the place, thank goodness :)

The food was good, the sides are a la carte, but not over the top priced. My porterhouse steak was cooked exactly how I ordered it and my wife's shrimp scampi was very good.

They had a very nice wait staff and brought a nice variety of hot rolls promptly to our table when we arrived.

We didn't have desert, but the selections were okay.

Overall, it was pretty good. If you want a more expensive, romantic setting, albeit old school Vegas, try going to the Ranch Steak House at Binion's. It'll cost more, but the views are really cool as the night lights of Vegas come on.",uJbPFYJN25N5DTwNV3KzPg,0,1,4,Wi_0HimpAeWR2U4E-wSLCw

We Ordered a Garbage Salad where it tasted like everything was mixed a few days ago and all the flavors had blended, so it all tasted the same.

The Crab Cake Appetizer arrived scorched and overcooked. The crab meat was a good quality - just improperly cooked. No Bay Seasoning only a mayonnaise sauce. 
We both ordered the Fillet and they both were excellently cooked with a top quality meat being used. One was 50% larger than the other - which just looked odd. 
The Mushroom side dish was bland and the sweet potato fries were mainly the little pieces you get at the bottom of the bag - for the price disappointing.

A local recommended the Flame.  The casino was not too smoky, and the restaurant was fine.  Decor is what you expect for downtown; a bit worn and dated.  The waitress probably worked there forever and was very knowledgeable about the wines and the menu.
The stone crabs were very good,although I didn't expect them cold, on a bed of ice.  I switched out for a dry plate, which was better.  The dipping sauce included was mayo based, tangy and delicious.  We asked for and received warmed butter.  I prefer melted to drawn butter, so I decanted most of what they brought and melted the table butter in the candle warmed dish.  Combining the sauce with the butter was the best flavor combo.
The sides were just average.  A few slices of fried potato, and a small vinegar based coleslaw.  An order of grilled asparagus with a wonderful Hollandaise sauce was well worth $5.
For a $5 wine upgrade, we selected a French Beaujolais; it was perfect with crab.
Use the included crab cracker tool.  I cut my finger trying to pry open some pre-cracked shell.  These crabs have a thick shell.
We don't eat meat.  There are other seafood items on the menu, so plenty to choose from.  And I'm sure you could get a good steak there.

I will do this review on a pro and con format.
TheCons
-When I was seated I wanted a cold beer,I had been walking Fremont St. and just want something cold, so I ordered it and waited and waited and I was just getting up to walk out and it arrived. The service never improved, basically when I wanted something I had to flag the server down all the way up to the the check, ask for it, wait, wait some more and flag down server. The dining room was not busy, maybe half full.
-After my salad arrived I noticed that everyone but me had rolls and butter!!!
-I ordered a NY Strip steak, of course it came out improperly cooked, but it was terrible, full of gristle,tough and no taste.It was not Prime or even Choice but probably Select grade which is what one buys for say making stew.
The Pros
-I oredered a Wedge Salad as an appetizer, it was possible the best I have ever been served.
-The terrible steak was done Steakhouse style with just a little char on the outside.
-The steak was $25, at Flemings or Capitol Grill it would be $37 or more, of course it would be Prime and melt in your mouth.
So if you want a steakhouse on a budget this might be the place.",-GM-Kv07HZwOPiU9wqvZcw,0,0,2,ca6QVCOks1nI3KD_oyiV3A

1720959,2010-10-24,0,ShUREGiU1IjHuPYq4jVvng,"DH and I were on the annual trek to Vegas and were tempted to try the Flame based on a coupon from restaurant dot com.

Walking in, I felt like I was going back to the days of Vegas and mobsters.  Salmon leather booths, plain tables.  No families, no kids. Quiet.  Mostly older couples - I think  we were the youngest in the room (and, believe me, we aren't that young).  But we thought - hey, its okay, how bad can it be.

Talk about never judge a book by its cover!  We started with salads that were just too huge for one person - the caprese salad would have served 3 easily with the most wonderful heirloom tomatoes.  I could have stopped there and been happy, but we kept going - and I was glad we did!  Let me warn you - the sides are huge, they are splittable so don't order too many!  Baked potato was just a good old-fashioned baked potato that was so creamy, it was a meal in itself.  We had asparagus w/ Hollandaise and the mushrooms sauteed in Cabernet butter - heavenly.  My DH had a steak which was quite good - nice size, cooked perfectly.  I challenged the kitchen to serve me medium rare lamb chops - and the chef rose to the challenge!  Grilled perfectly, they were tender and flavorful - I wanted to gnaw the bones, they were so tasty!  Even the bread was good - a nice, old fashioned variety of breads, warmed to perfection.

Our waiter was that rare breed that understands that it is important to pay attention, but not be bothersome. His recommendations were right on (the Pinot Noir was a great choice).   In this day and age of waitstaff that is either ""perky"" or ""non-existent"", I felt his service was deserving of an email ""shout out"" to the restaurant management.

All in all, the  Flame was a great experience.  It is definitely one of the old Vegas restaurants - no flash, no glitter - but worth a repeat trip next trip out!",6ldbs7uuetv5UOWm_21REw,5,2,5,PJMhbn3Oyr_fLwoDZQRA2g

I came here with a group of people who I mostly met for the first time. I had a blast and I was very excited. Why? Well, coming from California I already had a mission leaving the Golden State: have foie gras.

So simply, I ordered:

TOURNEDOS OF BEEF ROSSINI - $28
Seared twin filet mignonettes, pate foie gras, madeira demi-glace.
Are you kidding me?! I get both filet mignon AND foie mignon?! Oh man am I in for a treat!  I was hesitant to order a while steak like everyone else but my tiny self don't need all that meat! I'd much rather pay a bit more for better quality meat (in my opinion) that is a good portion for me.  I get these two decent size filet mignon that was so rich and flavorful that is topped with the wonderful page foie gras! AHHHH!!! I ate the while thing! However the steak entrees here do not come with sides.  You'll have to order that separately.  The side I chose to order and share with my new friends was:

GARLIC MASHED POTATOES - $9
Roasted Garlic, buttermilk
This was. Sharing portion so it was plenty! It was delicious creamy mashed potatoes that had a slight hunt of garlic! Perfect with steaks!

For dessert our server verbally explained to us what they all are.  Here's what I ended up choosing because it sounded so fantastic:
 
STRAWBERRIES ROMANOFF - $8 
Fresh hulled strawberries macerated in Cointreau, orange juice, ice cream, whipped topping.
Okay, so the way our server describe this dessert was like a truffle.  He elaborated so poetically how it has a layer of this and that and then this as if it's the most amazing piece of art! So of course I had to have it! It sounded like something unique and the name alone had me thinking I never had such an exotic sounding dessert!  So the dessert comes out and placed in front of me.  This is a strawberry milkshake.  I had my first taste. This tastes like strawberry milkshake.  I was so amused!  Don't get me wrong this romanoff tasted like a decent strawberry milkshake! I should have gone with the chocolate cake...that's called chocolate cake, heh.

I had wine but I won't bother talking about it cuz I'm no wino so I'm no one to elaborate on any okay wordy smokey berry tastes I get having it. :P

My wife and i started with the calamari which was good but nothing special. I then moved on to my ribeye. The steak was a great piece of meat cooked perfectly. My side was a garlic mashed which also was very good. My wife had the fried shrimp which was actually an appetizer. It came with 4 huge shrimp lightly breaded, She also had the chicago garbage salad which she said was great. 


ok...so the place has great food with prices you cant beat BUT its as simple as a place can come. If you are looking for a fancy atmosphere this is not the place for you. The tables had basic white table cloths with cafeteria type silverware. The overall decor of the restaurant consists of a single LCD TV mounted on the wall playing loops with scenes of Italy, The lack of atmosphere will make it feel feel like you are waiting twice as long for your food. 

The service...it was good. They wont make you feel like a rock star but your drinks will be full and your empty plates with disappear when expected.

This place delivers a solid meal for a great price in a clean and updated environment away from all of the smoke and desperation that typically emanates from all corners of the El Cortez casino.

On to the meal:

It's known far and wide that I love a good steak meal. It's also known far and wide that I refuse to pay 200+ dollars per person to have said meal.  In this visit I had the Steak Diane which I rarely see on a menu these days.  The steak was good (albeit somewhat thin) and prepared to the proper temperature but it wasn't as I am used to in cut sizes.  I'm also used to the meal being prepared table-side which is not the case here at The Flame.  For sides I had steamed asparagus and baked mac n cheese.  Both were quite good and the mini shells were a nice touch.  The only minor complaint I have is that there was no crab (or lobster) bisque on the menu and the flat bread was stale and chewy.  I feel every steakhouse should offer some type of bisque...self serving requirement as it happens to be one of the only types of soup I'll actually order at a restaurant.

The service was quite efficient with proper timing and presentation. I can't comment on the wine selection or quality as I was drinking ice-tea this evening.

Overall this place is a 4 out of 5 based on my initial visit.  I hope to return again soon to try other offerings.",UQB87Neb-M6xbxT6hi9rcw,4,2,4,-KXhVzYiBhzS_c922cUxsw

To begin, several different types of bread are offered with a wonderful creamy butter! We shared the onion soup ($5), which was very tasty, but was topped with a little too much melted Swiss cheese for our liking as it made it cumbersome to eat as it coated the spoon. Our 12 oz. Prime Ribs ($21) were cooked as ordered and were absolutely delicious: tender and very well-seasoned! As with most steak restaurants the sides are extra ($5), so we split a baked potato and were glad we did as it was literally the biggest potato either of us had ever seen! All of this was paired with a Woodbridge Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon that was very reasonably priced at $18. 

All in all an exceptional meal, and we look forward to our next visit!

For those new to the downtown area: the El Cortez is an older casino (but one of our favorite places to gamble) and one might not expect a nice steak house to be inside. Also it is just off Fremont Street, which is an area you want to be careful in at night and you want to be sure you know where you are going (thankfully there are more and more businesses expanding into this part of downtown).",g5ihTl7F8VmVuKHtpPYCaw,1,0,4,LcL7Xw_Rw1QaQSH3c7C9yQ

3063478,2011-08-11,2,ShUREGiU1IjHuPYq4jVvng,"Located at El Cortez Hotel and Casino, this place has its ups and downs, but, I say it's OK.  

Coming to El Cortez, I did like the fact that parking is free.  El Cortez overall is a nice place and have that old Vegas feel.  Focusing on The Flame Steakhouse, it has a very nice setting as well.  Very well decorated and not to crowded.  I did like the fact that they had a live Piano Player who played through out our stay.  

As far as the staff goes, they are quick and I did like the fact that some one is there to refill your drinks.  Our waiter who took our order was also nice as well.  Everything was done is a good amount of time to keep me satisfied.  

What was a bit unsatisfying was the food portion.  Don't get me wrong, it was nice and great, but probably could of been done better.  Even though the bread that was served was okay.  It seems like they were in a hurry to serve it, that they didn't sliced it all the way.  So when you're trying to get a slice of bread, you're either breaking off the bottom of the slice, or getting the bottom half of the other slice.  As far as the steaks goes, I was not totally impress with it.  It was decent in a way, but when asking your steak to be cooked medium, I don't expect it to look burnt or black.  It looked like they left it on the grill to long.  As expected, it did look a bit over cooked to be a medium.  Our sides of Macaroni and Cheese seems to be covered in burnt cheese as well.  It did look nice and tasted great, but the top layer of cheese was like a blanket, that we have to dig for the macaroni, cause the cheese seems to be too cooked and stuck to the bowl.  But it was decent enough to eat.  Dessert was okay as well, but not much to make it stick out.  

Overall, not highly recommended if you're looking for a steak house.  But a good place to go if you're hungry and don't mind your food to be overcooked, at least you know its cooked.  The place is nice, the service is quick in a timely matter.  I'm sure you'll have a decent time there.",VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,1,1,3,m-n-PEvdlDb8BxKd9RHuQw
3084328,2013-08-01,0,ShUREGiU1IjHuPYq4jVvng,"Okay, here is the difference, I am old-school, so I tend to think of the way things used to be. But even taking that into consideration, the last two times I have been here sucked, and it is absolutely the last time I am going. Even if it is free for me. 

This used to be a great place, you would go in, sit down and get a bowl full of olives, peppers, celery, carrots and green onions. They would also bring out the bread, which was always wonderful. For dinner, we would have our entree as well as soup or salad, vegetables,  baked potato or mashed or rice, and the price was fair.

Fast forward to last night. I took my 90 year old mom there. The TV's in the room are very distracting. They are large, hanging from the walls and show ariel views of different exotic locales. The ariel views caused me to have motion sickness, and I tried hard not to look, but they are everywhere. 

The wait-staff brought a basket of ""bread"" two little rolls and some kind of horrible tasting cracker things. Let me tell you, I am a human garbage can, and I will eat practically anything within reason, but I couldn't stomach the taste of these really disgusting crackers. 

I ordered the small portion of prime rib. It was the one saving grace, but I would not have paid over 20.00 for it. It was flavorful and I liked the spices on the crusty part. I did have to take off a HUGE chunk of fat, so it wasn't as big as I thought it would be. There was no vegetable, no salad, no nothing, everything was a la carte. I really didn't want to get a small portion of mushrooms or spinach for an extra $5.00 (although we did have a comp). 

Now for the bad part, my Mom ordered the Shrimp Scampi. I understand the concept of Al Dente pasta, heck, I even cook my own pasta Al Dente, but this was WAY underdone. The shrimps were horrid. She couldn't eat any of her dinner, and although she wanted to share it with me, I tasted it, and was shocked at how horrible it was.  I shared a bit of my prime rib with her. 

We have been to the coffee shop a few times in the past, and I know for a fact that the food comes from the exact same kitchen, so I don't know how they can justify the price difference.  

The waiter didn't even ask my mom if she wanted something else, even though we told him it was not edible. 

I would not recommend this place at all, and all I can say is a little relish tray or a small baked potato goes a long way, but maybe those things are just a part of the past in restaurants, I don't know.",rN45nHPgx7ir1lDQy_cqBQ,0,0,1,qu2uamTyuCd4yfzFqnbGGQ

The chowder was good and I ate half of Andrea's salad.  With dinner, we got an order of steamed asparagus with hollandaise and shared.  Everything was well prepared and excellent.

The ubiquitous flat panel screens are here, too, but instead of the omnipresent sports on TV, they had a DVD loop with scenes of various places in Italy--from Rome to Venice and other destinations.  The HD quality of the video was superb, and it was quite relaxing.

Not just ""rubbery"", Thick cut and overcooked, then piled into a deep bowl so it steams itself as it sits. Horrible. The crab cakes were cold inside and flavorless.

I don't like ""old,"" maybe because I am, and walking through El Cortez to get to the restaurant didn't buoy my spirits, nor did the atmosphere of the Flame once we got inside.  Our friends had reserved a circular booth, but I'm too short to be comfortable in a lot of booths, so we switched to a table.

The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant reminded me of several old-world restaurants in NYC that my ex-MIL used to us to, the ones senior citizens feel comfortable in.  It's just not my speed.  

We rarely go to steak joints, because neither of us is a big fan of steaks.  It takes a really special hunk of meat to wow me, and this wasn't it.  The steak was fine, but not spectacular.  Our friends ordered a mushroom side for the table, and we shared a couple of baked potatoes and asparagus.

My New York Strip was also cooked perfectly, I ordered it medium, and the meat cut so easily (4.5 stars).

We selected two sides to accompany our meal the steamed asparagus and the garlic mashed potatoes (both a solid 3 stars).

For our dinner wine we selected Santa Rita 120, Chile, Cabernet Sauvignon ($18, 4 stars, it was recommended by our server in the price range we were looking for).

Linda was our server, she was very attentive, and made some excellent recommendations.  She scores 4.5 stars.

Our overall experience at the Flame Steakhouse was fantastic.  Our total bill for everything listed above was $100 (add $24 for Linda since she was a great server).  

For the price I am not sure you can beat this place.  I would recommend coming in a little earlier (we got there at 5:30pm) and making reservations, the place was pretty packed on a Saturday night after 6pm.",43H1P3A_4fnfisgGNGNMqQ,1,1,4,3sgNnK_PcvhGMdyPg6IvWA

I'm not a fan of the downtown area (too depressing and sketchy) but it was worth it.  If you use the valet parking service at the El Cortez, it's painless.  The restaurant's pretty close to the valet/front entrance.

I got the oysters appetizer (Kusshi).  WOW!  They were sooooo yummy.  They were an AWESOME deal.  13 juicy plump babies, for $9.95!  I could've ordered 3 more of those.  The last time I had Kusshi oysters in L.A., I paid $1.50 EACH.  The boyfriend got the babyback rib appetizer and he raved about them.

For the next course, I got the French onion soup.  Not only was it one of the best I've ever had, at $4.95, it was a steal!  I knew I shouldn't eat all of it so I could leave room for the entree, but I just couldn't stop myself.  The seasonal green salad that the boyfriend got was... good.  Seasonal.  And green.  

Our entrees were excellently prepared and seasoned (surf & turf for me, the bone-in ribeye for him.

The reason why I will definitely go back is not for the entrees or the ambience (or lack thereof?) but for their appetizers and the French onion soup.  We discussed the probability that we'd just order all the appetizers and skip the entree.

Oh, and I wish I had gotten the name of our waitress, but she was awesome.  Not only did she NOT get snooty/grouchy when I told her I had a coupon, she provided us with some of the best service we've received anywhere.  It turned out that with the coupon, it automatically added the tip (I think 15%) but I left her closer to a 25% tip because she was so sweet and attentive.",FLZVbNL6gLji3ghze303Fg,0,0,5,FnyRzesznM9JqCc75weNpw

- In El Cortez. Upon entering, there is a sign that requires appropiate attire, and I came in wearing a hoody and tennis shoes, but I was fine. The restaurant is fancy so I can understand why. Wish I knew in advance. I'm glad they did not turn us away.
- We were seated immediately and got our orders in within 10 min. 
- Service was sub-par for a STEAKHOUSE.
1. No introduction, ""Hi, my name is...i'll be your server. Today we have..."" 
- It went more like, "" Today's fish is...Today's soup is...I'll give you a moment""

- Compliments for the steakhouse 
1. Live pianist. He played nice Christmas songs. 
2. Romantic seating and dining. 
- Presentation and taste of food was average. 
1. The pork chop was grilled well, succulent and not overly seasoned. recommend. 
2. The shrimp scampi linguini tasted as if someone spilled their white wine on the dish. 7 pieces of shrimp. do not recommend. 
3. Cream corn was okay. I enjoyed the baked layer of cheese on top, but the corn seemed canned, which probably it is not. I just know when I went to ENVY Steakhouse, you can tell they cut off grilled corn on a cob. They did not do that here.
4. Mac n Cheese was delicious. Also a nice baked layer of cheese. Shelled-noodle. 
- This is a nice restaurant to put in El Cortez, but to compare to other Steakhouses, it did not wow me. Although, it is cheaper than most, so that may provide a bit justification.",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,5,3,3,AuepucRhK5vcKLdB7r2aaA

I saw the Flame and we decided to give it a shot.  We were glad we did. The service was superb. Our waitress has been working there for 18 years and could not have been more enthusiastic about her job and the food.

For an appetizers shad crab cakes which were average, as was the iceberg salad.  My better half had the cream of asparagus soup, which was very good.

For the entrees, I had the queen size prime rib.  It was excellent, tender and cooked perfectly. It's not a gigantic serving, so those with a hearty appetite may elect the king size.  My girl had the whitefish which she enjoyed very much. We shared two sides, garlic mashed potatoes and creamed corn. Both were excellent.

* Fried Oysters
* French Onion Soup
* Prime Rib
* Steak Diane
* 8 ounce Fillet
* Mushroom Side
* Garbage Salad

None of it was the best I've ever had in the history of all the restaurants I have been to, but when food is this cheap, it tastes pretty damn good.  My only real complaint was that the meat in the Steak Diane wasn't charred like I love the most, but it was so tender and flavorful I did not care after eating it.

We walked out, after using our restaurant.com certificate paying only $60, which for four people is a steal.  My mother, who never goes to these types of restaurants and only wants comped buffets, was so happy with the meal that she cannot wait to go back.

5658551,2010-12-29,2,ShUREGiU1IjHuPYq4jVvng,"How does this place have 4 stars?!? 

I met my sister and my brother-in-law in Vegas for Christmas and we went to The Flame Steakhouse for dinner on Christmas Eve. I was a little unsure about the place considering the location, downtown really isn't known for fine dining, but after reading the reviews on yelp I thought my sister had found a diamond in the rough. I was wrong! 

For starters the reason we picked The Flame was they have stone crab, which their menu prominently mentions they have from October until May. Christmas Eve is clearly during that period, but they didn't have any when we were there and said they wouldn't have it all weekend. 

So as for what they did have, I started with the French Onion soup, which was bland and nothing special. There was very little onion in it and I would say it was on par with what you would get at a Coco's or Denny's. For my entree I had the shrimp scampi, which again was bland and nothing special. I could hardly smell any garlic at all. I've had better at the Olive Garden at a fraction of the cost. So if you like bland food that is nothing special, this is the place for you. 

Then there was the service which was completely atrocious! Slow and inattentive would be the most complimentary things I could say about it. At one point my sister made a comment about how bad the service was only to have my brother-in-law mention that last time they were there the service was bad also. So apparently bad service is the standard here. 

At this point they would get 2-stars instead of just one, as the food was edible even if it was bland, but there was one other element to our dinner. We were seated at a table that was adjacent to a row of booths. A woman in one of the booths somehow lost her cell phone between the cushions of the booth. They had to bring out a maintenance man to literally tear apart not only the booth the woman was sitting at, but the booth behind her as well to retrieve the phone. It was incredibly loud and disruptive and took over half an hour!! 

I get that they wanted to take care of that woman and help her get her phone, but not at the expense of disrupting the meals of everyone else in the restaurant. It was completely unacceptable. They should have waited until the restaurant was closed and then retrieved the phone. 

Overall it was a bad experience and I will never be back.",pS0h-b_aWVm-drm880T01w,1,1,1,BsQ2nsO6RaQMWP4lqsT0lQ

A large Deep Fried Walleye Pike snuggled inside a light breading was an excellent entrée, while dinner rolls were just okay.  Large sautéed Mushrooms were very good and crunchy, and Fresh Cut Fries were an instant hit.
