So we were off running here and there for errands and I had a coupon for a buy one get one free whopper. We don't live far from this location  and we ran the errands needed in this side and it was about lunch time and my dad's like ""hey if you still have that coupon we can eat lunch here"" and I said sure I mean two whoppers for the price of one....thats a good deal there. We walked in and we were greeted with a smile and I felt like a VIP with how I was treated. The employees even came over and asked us if everything was going fine and if we needed anything. 

This is one Burger King I will be coming back to in the future, even though I don't eat out on a daily basis",7QRec81IeLgHcG6Tln0D8w,0,0,5,Xr5-C_qyfsHEh-4HVC8CLQ

Food wise i mean it's a fast food franchise so it's consistent in taste with all of them. Thing that stands out to me is how fresh they seem and when i do get my food the bread isnt all beat up and flattened up and the veggies are actually pretty fresh,ozm5zo-Z_Cm5SUCFXfzjkA,1,0,5,gAqzE0gI-0X5mrfZh0MVfQ

The food is average... I can't say that it's any better than any other BK.

The reason I gave them 2 stars, is because the service was horrible! We waited 2 minutes before ordering. The girl at the counter was far from friendly. Then we waited 15 minutes for a Whopper, Fries, and a Salad.

But no judgment, obviously I went there and we all need that grease bomb sometimes, right?   There's a 75% chance it's because you're hungover.  

But I came here to review the service.  Today I went through the drive thru for lunch - right in the middle of the lunch rush, about 12:15.  I placed my order and at the window and they asked me to pull around because they were making fresh fries.  No problem!  Love it when the fries are freshly saturated in hot transfatty oils... mmmm... 

ANYWAY... I pulled around, and I listened to the radio and played on my phone for awhile and then I realized a few other customers had come and gone since I parked and I figured they'd probably ordered fries, too, so someone forgot to bring my food out.  I got out of the car pretty annoyed - I mean, I'm not a crazy person (not in that way) so I wasn't ready to blow up or anything, just peeved off.

Then I went in the store, told them what happened and the entire crew, I kid you not, stopped for a beat and all looked so horrified.  And there were a lot of crew members on because of the lunch rush.  My heart went out to them so much, we all make mistakes at work, right?  Especially when we're busy.  Took them about 29 seconds to get my order in my hands and I received a thousand apologies.  

I was so impressed, I wish I had said something then and I hope my tone was polite when I told them what the situation was.  I also hope that this is a reflection of good management and the employees are taken care of and valued.  

To be honest, I hope I don't visit your establishment often but thank you for your prompt response and I promise to make you my hangover stop from now on... ok, maybe that will be fairly often........ ;-)",c9zCTLnrvPXGYwk0TcoqFA,0,1,5,mEG02QdOpXwWNjTB22rI7w

This BK is pretty close to my apartment. Its kinda hidden behind trees and such, but its next to Outback Steak House. My son had been asking for one of their crowns so on our way home from the library we stopped in.

Walking in its nice, it has one of then things to follow so you can stand in a formed line, the menu is big... but the value menu is to the left and a lil small.... great marketing BK! Lol. Today we got a chicken tenders kids meal and a double cheeseburger combo.

The kids meal was cute, it comes in a box with a crown attached and your choice of chicken tenders, cheeseburger, or regular burger. Plus you get the standard fries and a drink. I got the double cheeseburger meal with the ice cream sundae. At first I was like a little iffy, Im not super into fast food but this one was yummy! The new fries they have are thick and crispy and have a good amount of salt. Now I usually like my stuff salted and this was perfect! I really like the self serve drinks and ketchup, I feel like Im not wasting when I use the ketchup dispenser. I tried all my food and it was delish! I then tried my ice cream and was in love!! ITS SOOO RICH AND CREAMY! For BK this is awesome! I loved it! 

We found a seat in the play place which was pretty large and had a ton of seats... most of all it was CLEAN! Yay! My son enjoyed himself very much in there! It doesnt get too crowded when theres a lot of children and its temp is cool in there!

I would've given this review an extra star for Brandon's fairness, except when my friend got back he noticed that the sandwich he had originally ordered was wrong too & had mayo on it when he asked for no mayo on his chicken sandwich. Let's just say Brandon needs to run a tighter ship & make sure the employees at this location are doing their jobs correctly & making the orders right.",z0MjzM0fzwQpMuYYQY4VHA,2,0,2,YGf1xPyWI0HnQvSuGFqZJw

I was waiting in line earlier today for a while in the drive thru, and when we reached the window to pay, the manager told us that we had been waiting a while so the shake was free! 
I thought that was really awesome, considering that they consistently produce a good product at this location compared to other BKs. 
I am a customer for life here!",soFNjo1-ao4grGSJ0u9S4g,0,0,5,ti_xW6bG6NYT-2sWVumitg

Wouldn't you know it, the order taker stalked up with a forceful stride and demanded to know if we were eating in or taking out.  We barely had a chance to glance at the menu.  Why is it so fucking important to know that right away?  Why shout??  She needed to make herself heard over the blaring pop tunes blasting.

Why not just say, in a polite tone:  Hi.  Let me know when you're ready to order.

In less than 30 seconds I decided it would be a struggle to enjoy the Smashburger experience.  Lucinda agreed.  We headed down the street to Burger King.

Play it safe and order from the drive-thru.  Less chance to be irked.  A friendly gal named ""Baby"" believe it or not helped us.  ""Baby"" is the superstar who makes this venue worth a visit.  Not to slam the youngsters, but Baby puts her heart into her job, doesn't act like it's beneath her the way so many sullen youngsters do.

I fell for the A-1 special cheese burger supposedly served on a ""warm, toasted, Artisan bun.""  Here's a tip:  Don't fall for these gimmicks.  Their tried & true standard bun is far better.  

Lucinda wisely chose the Whopper with cheese & bacon.  A very dependable selection.  Way better than the A-1 special.  

Don't bother to say ""no onions.""  Just pick 'em off.",PYnnzS_3-0oDAT3cmcfs9Q,2,3,4,_9UKxPSPmJh6VOhGGYwDlA

I waited 10 minutes for 2 orders of small fries and a couple chicken sandwiches. Horrible by the mgr and kitchen staff. 4 employees that didn't know crap,Ee7DchX4XXDIC-5AR_ypTQ,0,0,2,E3lzAtJ835BAwu3jWpdM2A
