61970,2011-09-29,1,QOE93SXgKd8EsaUT-DaXhA,"Often imitated but never duplicated it's the original 808 shave ice booooooy!  

People call me silly and some even call me Mac Miller cause I'm always double thumbs up (google him if you don't know)  but in the end I only get cherry because it's my favorite and that's just how I roll. I know I know pretty plane jane but hey I know I'm not alone on this one. 

However, for those of you who are more adventurous than I, say like my girlfriend who hasn't missed a flavor on that truck. Then you could enjoy all the greatest things this glorious truck has to offer and here are a few: sweet condensed milk( you know they call this snow capped), caramel, chocolate, mochi, azuki beans, chile con limon, sour spray and a few more that I can't remember.  

More flavors than anyone can eat in one day so I advise eating 2 smalls on each visit with 2 flavors on each shave ice even though you could get up to 3 or more if you would like but I think sticking with 2 smalls and 2 flavors each time, like cherry and lime or lime and lemon would get the job done as well ans would leave you very happy and more on your way to a favorite combo of your own. 

The best thing about this shave ice is that it's ""NOT"" a snow cone. I repeat it's ""NOT"" a snow cone it's literally shave ice and when you eat this ice it's like eating a freshly fallen snow flake except one snow flake isn't  enough so they pilled a bunch into a cup and poured great flavors on top and it's delicious. I like to eat mine layer by layer as I run the spoon up the side of the shave ice peeling off a little bit of that glorious ice at a time. Warning: If your looking for chunks of ice in your shave ice than this is not the place for you because they only serve the finest shave ice in Las Vegas. 

Also, the staff has always been very nice and filled with many smiles. Hope this review doesn't fall all blind eye's  and sorry for the length I thought it was needed  to show just how good this place is.

We always thought of a snow cone that has cheap sugary syrup and crunchy crushed ice.  Boy, were we wrong...went on vacation to Honolulu and had Matsumoto's Shaved Ice and the Ice Garden.  [Note: a snow cone should in no way ever be compared to shaved ice].  The ice is shaved so fine that it appears snow like and the flavors and toppings are insane.  We were sad when returning to the mainland knowing that we would have to wait until our next trip back (who knows how long that will be) to have this delicious treat.   That was until we found Snow Ono Ice...we didn't think it was possibly to find this on the mainland let alone Las Vegas.

My shaved ice experience must be pretty limited because I've never seen a place offer ice cream and milk and what not on it, so being the first time I only tried a dual flavor cup, but next time I am gonna try something new. 

I got a large tigers blood green apple combo, my favorite flavors.  It was good and sweet and great for the 100 degree day we were having.  The girl that took my order was nice and gave me a stamp card with their social networking information.

Only gripe I had was that I had ALOT of syrup.  After just a minute or two I had a bit of a congealed mess, but it was hot out so it's not something that can be helped. 

I'll definitely be back for more because there are so many other flavors to choose from.",0jh6FM1kd6ecYs1ESjFZKA,1,1,4,-qMi7RM6j-suGH3ylybp1w

SnOw OnO! 

What a great choice indeed. Such a choice I would high five myself. SnOw OnO is a truck full of pure 808 shaved ice deliciousness. I was hesitant to try SnOw OnO because Hawaiian Shaved Ice is possibly my favorite thing to eat when I am in Hawaii. SnOw OnO did not disappoint! I got the Onolicious (strawberry, blue Hawaiian, pineapple) with a snow cap on top. Whats a snow cap you ask? It is sweet condensed milk splashed on top of your shaved ice.  Don't knock it till you try it my friends.

They also have excellent customer service. I accidentally ordered a large which is practically like size of my head ( they are gracious with their servings.) and I knew it was too big for one girl to eat I asked to go down a size and with their positive aloha attitude  told me it was no problem and gave me a refund for he large I originally bought and made my shaved ice with a smile and sent me with away with a happy look on my face and nice ""mahalo.""

 Now I will give you this tip. SnOw OnO has a big following so don't be surprised if you wait 30 mins for a delicious cool treat. I'll tell you though it is definitely worth the wait.",T0ua11LxP335TfFsuawbNw,0,0,5,B5PssXg8tYp9tcLYn75Z-Q

297682,2011-07-04,1,QOE93SXgKd8EsaUT-DaXhA,"I am a ""snow cone"" snob.  I grew up in Hawaii where we call it shave ice because it is quite literally ice shaved so thin it's like snow.  There is a significant textural difference between what people perceive snow cones to be and what shave ice is.  The texture of the ice and the flavor of the syrup really makes a difference!  Having lived in Vegas for over 10 years I have been unable to find anything that matches the beloved Matsumotos and Aokis from the North Shore of Hawaii.

Until now.

Snow Ono is incredible!  I had heard there was a Hawaiian shave ice truck here in Vegas and immediately had to find out the who, what, where, when.  Following her on Twitter makes it easy to figure out where the truck is and when at any given time.

The shave ice is the bomb!  It comes in four sizes - Kiddie, Small, Large, and Bowl.  You can choose up to 3 flavors - there are over 30 to choose from including local favorites POG, Li Hing Mui, and Lilikoi.  Ice cream, azuki beans and mochi are extra but there are free toppings such as sweetened condensed milk (snow cap), Li Hing Mui powder, and a sour spray.  The price is very reasonable considering the portions are incredible - we have had the Large $5 and the Small $4.

For me the thing that makes good shaved ice is the the texture of the ice. Some places have a granular texture which I would consider not shaved ice but a ""snow cone"". You know the thing you used to get from those ice cream trucks when you were little. Maybe that's why I was never a fan. But Snow Ono's ice is like nothing I've tasted before. It's nice and flaky giving it a smooth texture in your mouth. They also offer all kinds of syrup flavors and unique toppings.  

I just recently got back from Hawaii and Snow Ono rivals some of the places out there. I became a shaved ice critic and found only 1 out of 5 spots that came pretty close to Snow Ono.

I have been looking for a place that has really good shaved ice in Las Vegas after trying the Get Shaved Ice truck in the Los Angeles area.  I haven't been to Hawaii yet, so I can't really comment on the authenticity of it, but from what I tasted, I hope I won't be disappointed when I do go to Hawaii.

The quality of the shaved ice is as good as it gets.  It is like powdery snow, and melts in your mouth almost instantaneously, unlike some of the iced chipped imitation ""shaved ice"".

They have a lot of flavors to choose from as well as some combo items if you can't pick just one flavor.  The price is pretty reasonable and the portions are pretty big.

The workers are really friendly and their service matches their personality.  I am definitely looking forward to following this truck as the summer season in Las Vegas is approaching and this type of treat will be needed.",tbXrF0IhRCONUGNRWkXwIw,0,0,5,YTZEpezMQKwj2wvR9-AqUg

45 seconds, bicycle crunches,
45 seconds, inch worms,
Sprint to the line
......etc, etc.

You got it, I was in boot camp at 6pm with 100-degree, ""dry"" heat.  What better way to wet my whistle at 7 than Snow Ono Shaved Ice that just happened to be in the same park?

With probably 30+ flavors and free mix-ins, like condensed milk and caramel syrup (ice cream is extra), Snow Ono is a divine experience.

I had the amply-sized small for $4 with Watermelon, Lime and Blue Hawaii.  What came out looked like a colored mess of goodness not that different from an ordinary snow cone, but what I tasted was anything but a snow cone.  You can't compare it with any other shaved ice and syrup experience because, unlike the Slurpee, Slushee, Icee or Snow Cone, the ice is so fine that the syrup forms an almost non-Newtonian fluid with it - stable enough that I could drive, but instantly liquid in the mouth.  Unlike the others as well, the shaved ice and syrup are so perfectly blended that you never get to the bottom and find unflavored ice.  What you do get is a little bit of crusty ice around the edges that adds a different texture and adds to the refreshment overall.

Like everyone says, its not a gross snow cone.  Its shaved ice.  Almost like snow... like good packing snow.  (if you're from the Midwest, you know what I am talking about!)

I had a small (which was enough for 2 people!).  I had strawberry and melona (honeydew melon) with ice cream on the bottom and a snow cap.  A snow cap is condensed milk.  Total price: $5.

I placed my order and waited about 15-20 minutes for the tasty treat.  There were a TON of families that placed like 6 orders at a time.  I didn't mind as I walked around to the other trucks- Tasty Bunz, LuLu's and Grouchy John's just to see what they had going on.

I heard my number called and went to the window.  Sure with the red and green color my shaved iced was screaming MERRY CHRISTMAS and who cares- it was DELICIOUS!  I ate the entire thing, minus two bites that my husband was able to get in.

amazing, outstanding, marvelous, f***in out of this world, mind blowing - seriously none of these words cut it.

i've had more shaved ice in my lifetime than is actually necessary.
i really love me some shaved ice so there was little doubt that i'd also love snow ono.
i was more than pleasantly suprised.
i don't even know if you can call it shaved ice.
there's nothing 'icy' about it.

the snow that snow ono produces is like what a snowboarder imagines in their wettest snowboarding dreams.

we usually get the tropical flavors - guava, mango, lychee, etc with some red beans and condensed milk.
but it's not even about the flavored syrup or toppings.
it's all about that super velvety smooth snow they produce in that lil cart of theirs.

In fact, Las Vegas has even been called the 9th Island by Hawaiians that live here. This has developed into some Hawaiian traditions crossing over into Las Vegas traditions.

One of these, of which I am particularly fond, is the SnowOno Shave Ice truck.  For those of you keeping score at home, shave ice is a totally different thing than a sno cone.  I didn't believe it at first either, but I just drove thirty miles at rush hour on 215 for SnowOno and I wouldn't cross the street for a sno cone.  The difference begins in the texture of the ice.  I have seen the machine up close and still have no idea how this texture is achieved.  It comes out somewhere between actual snow and soft-serve ice cream.  They have a ridiculous array of flavors ranging from cherry, to egg custard to Tiger's Blood, I tried some of these until I fell in love with the egg custard.

There are a plethora of additional toppings and combinations that the staff quickly and professionally prepare while you wait, from mochi to caramel to condensed milk.  Perhaps, these are traditional island flavors, or maybe the minds  at SnowOno have just worked overtime to create the most addictive dessert in the desert.

As a food truck, SnowOno is always popping up around the valley.  The staff here does an excellent job with social media to get the word out about where they will be next.  For this I am grateful to them or as they might say; mahalos!",V6fWM24mP46KwJ5_zpEWNQ,3,1,5,Z9U_4_1PNi_e2n9sPfx6gQ

First, you're able to pick up to 3 flavors, and with there being over 30 flavors to choose from, there is something for everybody. You can also make your shave ice even yummier with add-ins, like condensed milk (free), vanilla ice cream, mochi bits and azuki beans for an additional cost (there are other offerings that escape me). 

My favorites are da Strawberry Shortcake, which is strawberry and wedding cake with condensed milk on top and the Horchata (ask for a sprinkling of cinnamon for that added flavor). Their flavors do not taste artificial, and they do not skimp on the flavoring. 

The sizes they offer:

Kid's $3 (the kid's size is a generous amount, even for a fat trucker)
Small $4 
Large $5 
Bowl $6

The girls are super friendly and accommodating, offering free samples of any flavors for the indecisive and giving suggestions.

2639403,2011-08-28,1,QOE93SXgKd8EsaUT-DaXhA,"Been anticipating to try this Shave Ice that many rave about... It was a humid night at Tommy Rocker's and instead of trying this first... we saved it until the very end. It was close to midnight when we ordered a large Tiger Blood, Horchata, and Lychee flavored shaved ice with add ons of mochi bits, ice cream, and condensed milk. Half way of making our order we were told they ran out of ice cream and received a refund for that. We were crushed by the news, since I was told by a great food source that I must get these flavors with mochi bits, condensed milk and the ice cream. Quite disappointed, but what can you do.. I know... try this truck first, then go eat the other food trucks next time.

My brother was ecstatic as can be when he first took a bite of this shaved ice. Actually he was head over balls for it! He shouted out and into the truck... ""this is the Best! I'm so happy to be here!!!"" He claims the taste was still great without the ice cream and for the musky weather.. it was perfect to have one of these to cool off your senses. I took a bite of each flavor and they taste true to its name. Horchata was wonderful and felt like I was actually having one, but with shaved ice. They even sprinkle cinnamon on top, like the real thing! Lychee was refreshing and with the bite of smooth, velvety shaved ice.. it was definitely a real, juicy treat. Now for the name Tiger Blood... the color was a fiery red and the taste... well I honestly couldn't describe it, but it was good. It didn't have a strong bite to it, but you can definitely taste it. I just love the color! The mochi bits gave the shaved ice some excitement and texture... they were fresh and soft. I enjoyed the slight marshmallow feel, it gave in my mouth.

After taking a few bites... I thought out loud that this is a lot and attempted to take the rest home, so my Mother could try it. So I took off and with my right hand holding the shaved ice and the other on the steering wheel.. I almost did an illegal left turn on Dean Martin Dr., but on the corner of my eyes, I saw a bike cop... so braked and changed my signal to right. Bike cops are notorious to pulling you over for anything and everything, so beware!!! So I turned right and got in the middle lane to make a u-turn, but wasn't successful in completing it.. I literally had to reverse then turn my steering wheel then put it back to drive to make the u-turn.. All while holding this shaved ice cone haha I had five cars racing down like mad bulls my way and I maneuvered everything just in time to not get hit by one. Thank goodness I'm both handed!!! Dashing away and looking like Statue of Liberty, I finally made it home to give my Mother the shaved ice that was still intact and not melted. She loved it! 

This Hawaiian shaved ice concept is such a brilliant idea to have... especially in the hot summer nights and after a long, hard day at work. We were all pleased with this delightful, powdery ice dessert. They even cater for Birthday parties, Weddings, and any Celebration!!! My brother loved it so much he's even wanting to book them for his Birthday Extravaganza! We'll definitely come back to try it with ice cream... Very kind people that run this truck. Many flavors to choose from, even sugar-free kinds, and great add ons to customize your taste buds. You can have up to three flavors/syrups and be flower powered by this shaved ice cup... it's so kawaii!!! aka cute.

The title of the truck alone clued me in these folks were the real mccoy.  Having dated a girl from Hawaii, I learned that Hawaiians call it shave ice, not shaved ice, although the grammatical inconsistency still baffles me.  I guess one could argue popcorn should be popped corn, but I digress...  The other word I learned is that ono means ""delicious"" in Hawaii, although it may as well be your last words when you realize you've already eaten the entire bowl and there's none left (Oh Nooooooooo!!!). 

It's the perfect dessert for the vegas summer since it is refreshingly sweet and they have a million combinations ranging from tropical (mango and lychee) to the decadent (wedding cake, red velvet) to the bizarre (afraid of what ""Tiger Blood"" tastes like).  I went with the lychee shave ice and added some mochi balls and azuki beans.  The ice is definitely velvety smooth without the choppiness of snow cones and they managed to distribute the syrup evenly throughout the bowl so that every bite is consistent.  Mochi balls had the right amount of chew for contrast in texture and azuki beans added some depth and color.   Sweet condensed milk and vanilla ice cream were other options, but I was already dangeously close to approaching a diabetic coma, so my only recommendation would be to request them to go easy on the syrup, but then again, my sweet tooth is a bit on the subtle side.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,2,1,5,pmj79_OQz6cqsOdKikmB7g

I had the Upside-down (pineapple, vanilla & coconut w/condensed milk) & it was delectable. The consistency of the ice is what makes it so amazing. It's not chunky - super fine & fluffy like a cloud of ice. It's powdery almost - imagine biting into actual snow. Also, the consistency allows the flavoring to permeate all of the ice. I'm sure you've had a traditional snow cone that runs out of flavor quickly due to the syrup being watered down by the large chunks of ice. This is absolutely not the case with this shaved ice - the flavor is never compromised by the ice & there are so many flavor combinations to choose from. 

The shaved ice I'm accustomed to from the Virgin Islands is called fraco. It's delicious, but the ice isn't as fine as SnO OnO's because it's actually shaved by hand. 

I am so elated to have found this place! Fraco is one of the main things I craved from St. Thomas, but was never able to have it here in Vegas. Now, I'm able to have an even better version of island flavor on the mainland! (please understand the previous statement is very strong because islanders are wicked loyal to their roots - SnOw OnO is THAT awesome!) 

I look forward to trying all of the different flavors & I'll definitely be stalking this truck on a regular basis! Maholo :-D",b47lvNKar71g-RQ7WFCaAA,2,1,5,QRtDDFqN50rfXQUt6TnmpQ

Me either.. until today and most definitely whoops the butt of any ice related dessert I have had in my life. 

There are 36 flavors and additional toppings such as condensed milk, sour spray, and azuki beans. They also offer sampling the flavors before you buy it, similar to when you buy gelato :). You can get up to 3 flavors for each order, which is great that they don't limit the flavors based on size. I had the melona and tiger's blood with condensed milk, and holy wow I don't know the origins of those flavors but mhmmm they're good. 

The shaved ice comes in four different sizes which are child, small, medium, large, and bowl. The sizes are really an understatement though, because every size is hugeeeee. I think it should be renamed medium, large, the small island, and the really big island. I think the child or small is great for individual and medium and up is big enough to share. 

I honestly don't know the difference between good shaved ice and GREAT shaved ice, but I know that the shaved ice from SnOw OnO delicately melts in your mouth very quickly like.. cotton candy.

When the weather warms up I can definitely see SnOw OnO being crazy busy because of their super value and its ONOlicious (ono means delicious).  SnOw OnO is usually found at farmer's market, such as Fresh 52, Bruce Trent park, and the Garden's Park. http://twitter.com/#!/SnOwONOShaveIce for more information :)",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,0,0,5,-4GY68DbqnCckdFMEV0ynA

We're punished in the summers with the scorching hot heat from the Vegas sun, but I believe everything happens for a reason. So from this torching summer fire we endure every year, comes the birth of a snow cone food truck to ease your troubles (yes they do). 

The girls that run this truck are actually snow angels, blessing us with a gift of pure heaven! Good, soft, cool, sugary heaven. I love how they give you the option of the amount of syrup you'd like (light, normal, or heavy) and the fact they offer punch cards to redeem for a free snow cone in the future, if you fulfill the punches of course. 

I've tried the Tiger's Blood and the Melona. Tiger's Blood is a popular choice and it isn't bad.. but I prefer the Melona. Add some condensed milk and it's like you're eating a Melona Bar! ..If you haven't tried Melona Bars then you need to start looking into it, I mean it!! You also have the options to add on things like ice cream, mochi, a sour spray, etc! 

They have several flavors but I honestly wished they had more (greedy much? why, yes, yes i am hehe). I just miss my black berry. black cherry, ice tea, cantaloupe, options that I had in TX. But still I'd have to say the snow in Vegas beats the one in TX!

He was definitely in.. So we headed out to the spot.. There was a nice show up of folks.. smiles on all faces.. We made our way to the truck and placed our order..

For those of you scratching your head and thinking 'They are the same thing' no, they are not... Snow cones use crushed ice, shaved ice is much lighter/finer. Shaved ice is more snow like then a snow cone, despite the name... 

SnOw OnO sells three sizes of shaved ice and you can select up to 3 flavors from a plethora of different options. They also have some premade concoctions.

SnOw OnO has been on our radar since the first mention of their truck and we finally got around to trying them a few months ago!  Boy, are we glad we did!

For the Husband and I, we usually share a large with ice cream added.  Our favorite flavors are POG (Passion, Orange, Guava), Mango, Tiger's Blood, and Melona.  But there are still so many we have yet to try! They use those plastic flower cups (that are recyclable) that are often used in Hawai'i.  We think their version is powdery soft, just like Waiola's!  

They have about 40 (give or take) flavors of syrups to choose from and you're allocated three for your shaved ice choice.  They also have sugar-free varieties too!

Customer service - these girls are super nice!  Not only do they do their best to remember you, but they make a point to thank you for coming by again and again.  (And you actually feel like they really mean it too!)  On our first visit, they made sure we had enough syrup for our shaved ice and if we didn't, to let them know so they could add more.  

This the real deal here!  No snow cone action!  Just real island style shaved ice!  The President would be proud!  If he can't make it home and has to stay on the mainland, he knows where to go now!  This truck will be waiting!

Prices:
Kids size $2
Small $3
Large $4
Bowl $5

$1 extra for ice cream, mochi, or azuki beans
Free for snow cap with condensed milk, chocolate, caramel, sour spray, or li hing powder. 

Check out their website for their weekly schedule.  For the most part, they are pretty steady on certain days, but private and special events mix it up a bit!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,13,8,5,Fk4AvLRnvgag0HdNJq1L_A

5049732,2011-04-25,4,QOE93SXgKd8EsaUT-DaXhA,"Let's get on to confusions first. This is NOT a snowcone! There is a DIFFERENCE! 

Snowcones is like snow, rougher, uneven pieces of ice because you use the machine to crush ice into small pieces. It's kinda crunchier pieces and doesnt hold syrup as well. Shave(d) Ice is finer fluffy ice and comes from shaving off fluff from a block of ice. It holds syrup better so you get full flavor in every bite and melts the flavor into your mouth like how cotton candy would. 

They're the only shave ice in town, but I think I could still say it's the best. There are so many syrup flavors to choose from so there is something for everyone and they're the real deal, shipped from Hawaii syrups. There are a few sugar free options too (the consistency of the ice slightly changes with that syrup- but still amazing for those who can't do sugar!). You can pick up to 3 flavors and a ""snowcap"" of either chocolate, caramel or condensed milk syrup on top. Premium toppings can be added on: vanilla ice cream, azuki beans, li hing mui powder, mochi bits. 

The sizes are generous- a small ($3) is way more than enough for me. Vanilla ice cream ($1 more) and condensed milk is a must! My favorite flavors so far are: melon, rosewater, green tea, POG (passionfruit, orange, guava mix), lychee.

Can't beat the quality, generous portions and variety for the price.

Customer service is really good and friendly. Yes, I know the ladies through the Yelp so I may be biased a bit, but really- they're always so nice! What Hawaiian business isn't about hospitality though?!!

You can choose up to 3 flavors per Shave Ice. They have approximately 30+ flavors to choose. From classics like cherry and bubblegum (regular and blue) to traditional Hawaii flavors, to several types of cakes. 

Some add ons like ice cream and sour spray and other stuff I don't recall are only .50 to $1 to add. Condensed milk is free (if you've never had condensed milk on a snowy treat, do it; you are welcome).

We hit up Summerlin Farmer's Market at Gardens Park a couple of Tuesdays ago, and there it was...gleaming in all its icy cold beauty...the shave ice food truck!  We couldn't believe our eyes!  It had dawned on my husband that this was the very shave ice truck that his colleague had mentioned a few days earlier.  We had to try their ice.

Sure enough, as the guy in the truck puts it, their ice is shaved most similar to Waiola's.  I'd say they are very similar to Koko Nuts in Koko Marina too!  The kids had their usual, rainbow flavahz, strawberry (or cherry), banana, and vanilla, while my husband and I tried their blood orange and mango, a favorite also of one of the ladies in the truck.  Shaved ever so delicately, their ice melts in your mouth faster than it can in this 100+ heat!  Their syrups selection is great!...too much for me to remember.  I guess we will have to return again, and again, and again...!

The truck staff is uber friendly and their service is exemplary of how a small shave ice business should run itself here in this desert heat!  It's good to know that they strive for the best and most friendly service (that I have ever experienced), despite the known fact that it's way too easy for just about anyone to lure heat-stroked customers with just sweet, sweet thirst-quenching shave ice!

Snow Ono was the saving grace of that food festival. After waiting in a few lines only to be told that they ran out of food when we got to the front, the girls here were awesome. They took our order, smiled, made small chit chat, and had that warm Hawaiian aura that I love.

On top of that, there product is like eating fresh powder snow. Their tiger's blood is my favorite flavor. They allow you to customize your snow cone with three flavors and a variety of extras. Some of these include mochi bites, azuki beans, ice cream, and caramel drizzle.

I've always loved sno-cones, but so entranced was I by these delicious treats, I would actually stop what I was doing on my trip, drive across the island, and hit up Wishing Well as fast as I could.  Upon returning home, I checked into shave ice rehab, and knew the day would come when I would fall off the wagon.

Enter South Point's Food Truck Fest.

Snow Ono actually parked in front of our business during an event one day, but I was too busy to try them out.  This time, I was going for it.

So I waited in a crazy long line, but it gave me time to size up flavors, and all the little side additions that they would put upon it.  Upon getting to the window, the lady asked what I wanted, and she must have hexed me or something, because I was pretty much answering ""okay"" to whatever suggestion she offered to enhance the shave ice experience.

I waited a little more, and was served this beast of a treat that was three parts tasty, four parts delicious, and another three parts heaven.  So what if it was early February and I was freezing my butt off?  Man, that shave ice was awesome.  I saved a little for the missus, and then had to fight her off from eating the rest of it.

I'm telling you now: When it hits those batmess hot 100+ degree temperatures this Summer, I am hunting these guys out.  I don't care if they end up making their way to Pahrump.  I'll still drive over there to find them.  If I can cover an island, I can make any drive.  Gollum has his ring obsession.  Mine lies in shave ice.

One word: YUM. Alongside Tiger Blood, I also tried Wedding Cake and Cotton Candy. Absolutely delicious. Wedding Cake is especially good with the sweetened condensed milk they suggested - although I chose not to have them coat the whole thing as it was fairly hot today and to me, milk doesn't mix well with heat.

Their unusual toppings are also something I've never seen offered before, possibly because the only exposure I have had to shave ice has been at the occasional half-assed summer festival in Vegas. I chose mochi bits for $.50, but I was intrigued by the sour spray they offer as a free add-on. The cups they give you are adorable as well - very reminiscent of flower petals and fit in my cup holder just fine.

On top of the outstanding shave ice, the service was incredible - I can't tell you how many times I was told ""Thank you for coming"" and asked questions about how I liked what I ordered, how I heard about them, etc. -- and offered to add more syrup or toppings if I liked.

Going to food truck gatherings, especially when the weather is getting warm, it is a godsend to be able to hit up the SnOw OnO Shave Ice truck and order a bowl (largest size available) of shaved ice to cool your insides.

For those that are not familiar with SnOw OnO, you can order up to 3 different flavors for your shaved ice out of their menu of 30+ flavors.  You also have different add-ons that can be selected for free (sour spray, condensed milk, plum powder, etc) and others you can upgrade with for a nominal price (scope of vanilla ice cream $1, red beans, mochi bits) to customize your shaved ice into your personal favorite.

My favorite flavors thus far are lilikoi, lychee, and mango.  But you should try whatever flavors that catches your eyes or ask the lovely ladies of SnOw OnO to make something up for you.

Tips:  At food truck gatherings, try to hit up SnOw OnO early, as the line can get pretty long on hot days.  If the line is long, place your order, go get some food from another truck and come back to wait for your order to be made.  No need to stand around in line waiting for your number to be called.

Specifically, their last two days of business. :( Yeah, I know, I am from Hawaii and love shave ice, but I don't really do well with following food trucks. :P Sadly, they have shut down for good, but I'm happy I tasted the best shave ice ever! You heard that right folks, Snow Ono is better than any shave ice in Hawaii!! Why? The ice is like a powder. You don't need to chew on bits of ice because it it smooth and just melts in your mouth! Yum!

My favorite flavors and toppings were strawberry and mango with condensed milk and mochi bits. It was nice of them to give out free shave ice (and pizza from Biaggio's Pizza) to all their customers on the last day. Although it was 50 degrees out and freezing, we could not put our spoons down until the last bite. It was totally worth it!

I'll miss you Snow Ono!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,3,1,5,8BpqSygNUO754-WAzp485Q

It took me five minutes just to read all of the flavor choices, but I went with what I was familiar with. Lychee and Mango with a drizzle of condensed milk.  Woooooohooooo!
Upon first spoonful, I was transported back to Hawaii. The mountain of powder was like a spoonful of silk at every bite. It is NOT a snow cone at all. It is a lil piece of heaven. 

A small is only $3 and their version of small is huge!  I can't wait to try other flavors (wedding cake, dreamsicle, strawberry cheesecake) and toppings!  I wonder where they will be today...",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,2,2,5,uDEUKaNYEJHShuepA-ac1g
