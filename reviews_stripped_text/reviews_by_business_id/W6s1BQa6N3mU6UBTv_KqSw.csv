The cashier saw us and waived us in with a big smile.   The cashier was beyond knowledgeable and helpful with the menu.  We received out food very quickly and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  The Cherry Popper Burger was outstanding and the truffle fries are addicting.   One of the very best burgers in town. All the staff were friendly and happy and we never felt rushed, even though we were the last ones there.  This was my third time there and the food just keeps getting better and better.

Maybe my mind went in ""pre-blown"", but I and the other three people I went with were not impressed.  The restaurant's decor and style was a lot of fun and looked nice, but the food options were confusing with how the menu was set up and a secret menu that is only secret if you don't look at the TC screen?  After figuring out the menu and what we wanted, we received our meals... this was the disappointing part... the food was just meh, not bad, but not great.  

I will not be eating here again, but I know a lot of people who love it.  I know this isn't the most helpful review, but I don't think you will be missing out on anything if you don't eat here.",Roo5xp66Ky7Su7I8cy03ng,1,0,3,C206W2sOrVp9-3EmTTStwg

I didn't even know about SkinnyFats until yesterday afternoon haha. Firstly, I was amazed at their menu options. Loved the breakdown of the menu & the healthy | happy sides of the menu. The selection was impeccable, the meals were unique, pricing was fair, & there were vegan, vegetarian & gluten free options available! Secondly, I was blown away by how KIND, RESPECTFUL, PROMPT & HAPPY the service / employees were at this location. You could tell that everyone genuinely likes to represent their business & that is something that is lacking at most establishments these days. The cashier was courteous & greeted us upon coming in, she took the time to break down the menu for us & go over the craft beers available. She knew the menu & made recommendations. I got the Zucc It bowl- 8/10 (a little spicy but so delicious  the zucchini noodles were filling & the veggies in it were amazing) I also got the Healthy Hangover juice- 10/10 (the cashier was kind enough to sub the celery with orange for me), & a lemon blueberry cookie - 9/10, would give 10/10 if they were vegan or gluten free but it was still sooo good  (which the very kind lady comped for me after I waited in line to get a box when I didn't have to lol. What place is that cool!? That's so nice of them. Seriously.) My boyfriend got the Ahi tacos which were full of flavor-10/10, truffle fries 10/10, a raspberry beer 8/10 (has a tart yet very sweet taste but pretty good). Our friend came with us & was a few people behind in line but they brought his food out at the same time as ours! All around the service was impeccable. Restaurant was very clean, they had eco friendly bathrooms / sinks, the seating selection was nice. I could go on.

1362337,2017-11-20,0,W6s1BQa6N3mU6UBTv_KqSw,"SkinnyFATS is a really fun place to eat. The menu is divided into the Healthy side and the Happy Side. I have chosen from both sides, my husband and daughter only choose from the Happy side. The menu states the calorie count for the Healthy side, but not for the Happy side. Maybe if you knew how many calories the Happy side had you wouldn't choose much from that side. I don't know. Some people don't care about that when they go out. At any rate, they have something cool for everyone. Sometimes they have items that aren't on the menu. They are on the wall shown on the little TV screens where you wait in line to place your order. This is gourmet type food with non gourmet prices.
 The entrees are $7-$14.

My husband likes their soda made with cane sugar. Some people get excited about that. They are interesting flavors, not just the regular coke and sprite type. I don't get the juice because I don't want to spend a lot of money on a drink. The cookies are very good. 

In my opinion the best of the Healthy side is the STEAKation. Yummy...really and truly. Last time I ordered something called Pilgrimamedic (not sure of the title). It is just for November. Sooo good. Turkey ham on a waffle made of corn bread stuffing ingredients with fried green beans with some cranberry sauce with an over easy egg on top covered with some hollandaise type sauce and a few sugared cranberries. Wow!  My taste buds were very happy. Not sure what side that was from. Probably the Happy side. I just discovered that they have the breakfast menu all day. I'm going to try that next time. 

The decor is interesting. They have TVs which doesn't make me happy. Apparently some people cannot survive without TV every waking hour. The staff are very pleasant and they seem happy which is good. They have some booths, bar seating near the kitchen and a huge table in the middle that multiple parties can sit at with chunky barstools that are hard to move and not extremely comfortable. I'd rather sit at a booth, but they don't have many of those. They also have a little outdoor enclosed eating area. They do have some free standing tables with chairs near the front windows which are not very inviting or cosy. 

All in all... this is a fun place to go when you don't want to spend too much money and you have people who have different taste desires. We bring out of towners here when they visit.",NJf8eisOIQW_mqMaz-LP9g,2,1,5,qI34VNCEDnXLFLgZfJmezg

My friends kept stealing sips! Within about 10 minutes my food came out and it was delicious, I threw some hot sauce on there for extra spice and made it just a touch too spicy, but kept quenching my thirst with soda ( I eventually moved on to black cherry soda).

I was dining with a vegan friend and there were tons of options for her to choose from, I sampled them all and they were all yummy! The bathrooms are clean and spacious.

Both sides have plenty of delicious choices from a simple mixed green salad to a fully carbs loaded pasta bowl. My fiancé and I got ""Nice to Greek you"" and ""Fresh Morning"" and they were both pretty good, except for the ""Fresh Morning"" was a bit dry and could use a little more sauce.

Fresh smoothies with great unique flavors and now they are gone. My favorite was the Delightful Cucumber and secondly the Ginger Cinnaps and my husband and kids loved the Charlie Brownie flavor. I've seriously considered contacting the owners to ask them to bring them back or give me their recipes for them to make at home.  The 3 star I gave is solely because they stopped serving the smoothies which was the thing that brought me in the most despite them being pricey smoothies, it was worth it to me. 

But it you're tired of me complaining about that...I do enjoy the Buff Chix meal. Their fries are amazing. Wasn't a fan of the Zucc It. Cookies are also huge and delicious. Their sandwiches are amazing as well. Good large portions. They always have friendly staff and are willing to make substitutions for you in the meals. The atmosphere is clean, fun and enjoyable.

The way food is ordered and served is pretty cool too, although it is kinda awkward to stand around for a table if there aren't any ready to sit at. 

The service here is excellent! From the cashier to the food runners to the bussers, everyone was super friendly and accommodating. 

I got the vegan blue berry yum yum French toast and the avocado scramble. 
-French toast was not very good but it was edible. I think they're doing too much with it and could easily simplify the whole dish to make it better. 
-The avocado scramble I was actually really looking forward to because I dig a good tofu scramble and I make them for myself all the time. However, it was gross. Over powered by turmeric and garlic, I couldn't eat it. Tone down the spices please! 

The staff was VERY understanding that I didn't like my food and offered to remake the dish or make me something new. I just got a juice (hangover) instead and that was really yummy. 

My boyfriend got the steakation and LOOOOVED it! The hummus that came out with his burger on the other hand was not so loveable... him and I both tried it and weren't into it and we've tried a lot of hummus.

Three locations, the Dean Martin one being the only one that doesn't serve alcohol.  Catering menu available.  This review is for the North Decatur location.

Skinny Fats is exactly what it states.  The photos below contain the menu boards.  The area in blue are the calorie counting healthy menu options.  The ones in yellow are selections for people who care about flavor alone regardless the amount of calories.
The adjoining store front is their cold press juice selection.  Our choice was from the healthy menu and cold press juice side.    Prices for the food and fresh juices range between $4-13.   It's hard to say if I would frequent a place like this at home because I'm always at farmers markets gathering up goods to make this kind of food and do my own juicing.
I liked seeing the calorie count next to the dishes in blue, it gave me an idea of calories I'm consuming when I make these  foods at home. 
I usually go out if the food Im craving is too much trouble to make at home or I want to sample something to duplicate cooking at home.  Or if I just don't feel in the mood to clean my juicer.  Visiting the area, we found it to be an excellent find.  We will be back!

Loved the vibe.  As you enter, it's clean , organized and equipped with a well trained friendly staff.  
You can tell they do get very busy by the amount of stanchions they set up to form organized lines.  They offer the entire menu throughout the day.  Breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Whatever your in the mood to have, there are no rules.  Nice, flexibility in dining major points.

Hours are 9-9 daily.  Easy peasy to remember.

Ambience, 5 stars...the space was warm and inviting with reclaimed wood, decor is cool, rustic and comfortable.  Music selection was great.   A place you'd want to hang out for a length of time if your schedule allowed.  The bar appeared to appeal to folks who dined alone.  It was a cross between what appeared to look like a bar and a diner cafe.  No one sitting on it ordered alcohol.  But then again it was 9am.  But then again who knows in Vegas?! 
The crowd the same, a cross between young laptop users and an older cozy diner crowd.  Interesting

I can see this being popular for diners who want to dine together in the same restaurant but want totally different kinds of foods.

We ordered
Wrap supastar-$10
Chicken, egg whites, avocado, pico, spinach all wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla covered in Cajun cilantro avocado crema
Healthy & tasty 3 1/2 stars

Chickpea & quinoa soup
Vegetable soup
Healthy & delish 3 stars

It was huge, we should have shared.  Delicious juices

Two cold press juices, made fresh to order
Vitamin extraction on the spot

Sweet ginger-$8
Apples, beets, carrots, lemon & ginger

Loved it 4 stars

Hangover remedy-$8
Apples,  cucumbers, celery, carrots, spinach, beets and ginger

Just what the doctor ordered. 4 stars

Service is quick, after you make your selection, you are provided a number and in the time you select a spot to eat, get settled...everything is promptly delivered to your table.  

If your in the neighborhood, I recommend you stop in, even it's for just their tasty cold press juice. You'll want to linger just because they make you feel welcome despite how busy it can get.

I'm super happy to report that we tremendously enjoyed most of our food tonight, all from the Happy Side and all with tasty animals featured.  As a lady in line behind us remarked to other patrons, ""I only ever order from the Happy Side because you can't go wrong!""  I couldn't agree more!

Hubby had the Cherry Popper with sweet potato fries and I had the Sweet Cheese Us with sweet potato fries.  We also had the Tu-Nuts to share.

First of all, if nothing else, I would come back every day just for those fries.  They are literally perfection and tonight was somehow even more crack-iliciously good than normal!

The Cherry Popper was absolutely scrumptious, at least from the tiny piece I was able to finagle off of Hubby.   I'm actually sad that I didn't go with my original intention of ordering this myself.

The Tu-Nuts was also divine!  Beware, this is sinfully rich, but oh so worth it!  Hubby would've liked to have a little more heat to balance all the sweet richness, but I thought it was great as is.  Interestingly, this may be the only dish on the entire menu that lists spicy ingredients but is actually LESS spicy than expected!

Our only slight disappointment, bringing this down to 4 stars from an otherwise perfect 5 stars, was the Sweet Cheese Us, specifically the very thin and grainy cheddar sauce.  The meat itself was tender and juicy, if a tad under seasoned, but the sauce left a very odd texture and taste in our mouths.  If I ordered this again, I would skip the sauce and just keep the pepper jack cheese it also comes with.

I was also happy to see that the names of some new items had been changed since our last visit to avoid any future confusion with same-name items at their other locations.

Great job, SkinnyFATS, on both service recovery and living up to your delicious reputation this time!",KadHfarZ0SHqvvz6hdiiRA,3,0,4,ZUktF_q7feCng2Om80K15A

Well they have it! 
I came here twice in 1 weekend. I had the mean bean burger on my first visit. I really enjoyed it. The bean patty had a good bite to it and had good flavor. I used some of their very own spicy ketchup to add some kick to the burger. I chose the cauliflower rice as my side. This was a bit on the bland side but still a nice addition to the burger. I would definitely order the burger again. On my second visit I had the blueberry yum yum French toast. This was very good and the berries were the perfect compliment. This really curbed my craving for French toast. Coffee is free before 11am.

The employees here are super friendly and helpful. They greet you as you walk in and thank you as you leave. The restaurant it self is also super cute. I felt such happy and positive energy during my visit here.

While this place has a ""healthy"" and a ""happy side"" I always stick to the happy side because well ...YOLO!!! So far I have had the classic burger, the cherry poper burger, the chix on broadway sandwich, and the hot chix salad. Out of all of these my favorite has been the chix on broadway sandwich. The sandwich consists of a HUGE tenderized chicken breast, thick cut pieces of bacon, cheddar cheese, veggies, and a fresh lemon herb aioli. The lemon aioli was a suprise but it helped to add a dash of tartness to balance out the rich fried chicken. The portion of this sandwich is extremely large and I had  to share the last bit with my hubby. Pair it with either their truffle or sweet potato fries and you have got a winner!!!! As far as the restaurant goes the employees go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your meal. One time my husband's burger was over done and they quickly prepared him a new one and comped an extra side for him.

I ordered the buffalo cauliflower which was really good and spicy, but with just a handful of florets, not worth the price. 

The zucchini noodles were bland. I had to add a lot of salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to give it flavor. 

When I went to pick up my food, it sat and sat forever and  there was no order or structure for pick up orders. By the time I got home, both the cauliflower and zucchini leached a ton of water and it just wasn't pleasant to eat. For $15 (which isn't a huge bill), I was pretty unsatisfied. 


UPDATE: I tried this restaurant again hoping I would have a better experience. The main issue is the lack of organization with pick up orders. After waiting in line behind people ordering, I got to the register where I was informed pick up orders should be picked up at the bar. A sign at the bar stating ""pick up orders here"" would be helpful. 

I ordered buffalo cauliflower again, but this time they forgot to add the yogurt sauce that comes with it. Again it was small, so this must just be the normal size. 

I added chicken to the zucchini and it was pretty good.
The naked chicken with balsamic, capers, and arugula was really good, and the caper dressing was great. 

The side of cauliflower was pretty paltry. I was shocked to open it and find the container not even half full. I would say maybe a quarter cup. It was very strong on the garlic and I didn't really enjoy it.

The atmosphere is cool, the menu contains more than enough options, and regardless of which side of the menu you order off of (Happy or Healthy), you're going to be stuffed (or leave with a to-go box).  Speaking of the menu, be warned: even if you order off the healthy side, you're going to feel guilty because of how good everything tastes, and probably because of how much you'll end up eating. 

Here are a few of my favorites:  try the ""S'motherload"" burrito (Happy side), the""Sweet Cheese Us"" (Happy side) and the ""Caulifire"" (Healthy side).  They have a nice selection of juices, smoothies and shakes on the menu, but I've always grabbed a soda from the fountain.  By the way, the cups for the fountain drinks are sturdy plastic cups.  You can toss them in the recycle bin when you're done, or take them home.  Skinny Fats even lets you know they're dishwasher safe.  So if you have a need for plastic cups at home, these are keepers.  A few other suggests of information:  for those who want breakfast during non-breakfast hours, they serve breakfast all day.  They also offer a military discount.

When you come in and head to the counter to order, take notice of the display that's about chest level along the wall.  It scrolls specials across the screen for you to consider.  It's definitely worth taking a look to see what's featured there.

This location is in a storefront with lots of parking.  You can strut toward the restaurant with great satisfaction since others in the parking lot will see you headed toward deliciousness, and you can quietly laugh at the people who aren't going to eat what you're about to eat.

This is a second review, ( 9/8/17) I ordered through Postmates to get delivery. I have ordered the stuff on curry bowl in the past and really enjoyed it. This time however, it was terrible. It was completely bland yet overwhelmingly spicy at the same time, the noodles were undercooked , dried out, and had zero flavor, almost as if they didn't season it whatsoever. There were also about a pound of jalapeños in it, both raw and cooked and it was so overly spicy it was inedible. I'm extremely disappointed because I know the potential of this place but sad to say I probably won't order from here again. 


Review number 3! After my bad experience last time and my prior review I'm happy to report that SkinnyFats reached out to me to make up for the bad meal.

I definitely plan to go back and try some of the ""happy"" menu items as well as some of their juices and cookies.

First of all, you have to wait in a super long line which they purposely make you wait in because they don't want too many food orders to go into the kitchen at once. However standing there, especially with kids, is not the way they should do business. Their salads are way too expensive for the portion that you get. I had the chicken and waffles today. The waffle was tough and my chicken was soggy. The atmosphere is great and the people are really nice, but the food is very hit or miss. The one positive thing is the cookies are amazing! Even though I got my cookies to go and when I got home they gave me the WRONG cookies. Nevertheless, they were still very good.

I had the TeriyAHI and the flavors were so amazing and the bread I feel like really made the sandwich especially with the sesame seeds. Kids got a burger the only thing that bummed me on that was that I was told they are small so I got two instead of one like I normally do. I have twins and they always share and even then they don't ever finish. I guess lesson learned on that. Husband got the meltdown and he said the spicy aioli was really good. Also had the truffle fries and again really good. If I had one negative it would be that there aren't any drink options for kids. All they have is soda and my kids don't drink that. They had a fruit smoothie which my daughter loved but my son not so much. The decorations are really cool with all the wood on the walls and art.

I ordered the One-Eyed Monster, Two-Nuts, and Truffle Parmesan Fries. The cashier was really friendly and patient, and engaged in some light conversation while my credit card was processing. 

The wait for the food was average, didn't take too long. Taste was good, overall. My FAVORITE thing from my order was the One-Eyed Monster. For $4.95 it's a good size (well, snack size, for me) and a quick breakfast bite. Presentation was cute too. The Two-Nuts was OKAAAY. Presentation was nice, but eating it was hard. The cucumber boat it came in was pretty hard to cut through, and made all the contents spill out, so I ended up just cutting it all up and mixing it together like poké. I love fries, so that's pretty standard, but my fries were not hot when I got them. A little disappointed, but I ate them anyway. 

The other reason I am giving them only 3 stars right now is because they don't accept phone orders at this location. I'm not sure if it's because it's new, or whatever, but REALLY? Why no phone orders? I may have to edit this if they change their mind.

This is *the* spot to go if you're craving something either healthy or fatty to eat that's not a fast food joint or Chili's. The menu is similar to the SkinnyFATS locations across town, but I prefer this one over the others. Food here is consistent, and the service is fantastic. 

The Teriyahi sandwich s a must. It's hard to believe it's on the ""healthy"" side of the menu at just a little over 400 calories (if you're counting). The sandwich is hearty and flavorful and bomb over all. Seared ahi tuna slices with citrus slaw, spinach, and tomatoes sandwiched together, what's not to love about that?

The Vegwich sandwich is also a perfect pick for a meal, and you won't miss the meat. A Portobello cap, avocado, horseradish, and pepper marmalade comprise this sandwich. This is full of flavor and the peppers add some serious heat. 

Sometimes, pasta can just suck it (sorry, pasta, I still love you). For a lighter fare, the Zucc.It bowl is the perfect mix of all things good for you. Zucchini noodles, eggplant, squash, peppers, and mushrooms...yum! There's also an option to add a protein of your choice. Shrimp is a good option, IMO. 

Juices and chocolate chip cookies are awesome. Give those a try, too. 

There's hardly ever a short line here, which is why I take my orders to go. Ordering online through their website or their app is the way to do it.

Overall price was $20 something dollars... pretty expensive in my opinion for a patty melt, sweet potato fries, drink, and fried pickles. 

Flavors were great though with the sweet potato fries being the best I've had yet. Beating out The Habit and some other places that serve sweet potato fries as well. They had nice dipping sauces at the table for you to use like Chipotle Ketchup.

It had me visioning spiral cut zucchini noodles with a tasty sauce and vegetables.  Spiralizing, I've seen this trend in restaurants and food magazines.  When my dish arrived what was in front of me was not what I had imagined at all. I suppose as a culinarian, I read too deep into the description of the menu.  The zucchini noodles because they were shredded thinner than angel hair pasta, once cooked, became soggy strands in the sauce. The ratio of zucchini noodles, which is the highlight of this dish considering they named the dish ZUCC IT, was not the highlight at all. There was way too much sauce for the amount of vegetables and very little zucchini. The result of this dish was an unappealing texture of web like strands of zucchini tangled in cuts of vegetables drowning in arrabbiata sauce. Can you envision it?  Calling them ""zucchini noodles"" may make the dish sound hip and trendy. However, it only lent to the failure of this dish.  Just cut up the zucchini and leave the word noodle out.  What I ordered was a bowl of vegetables stewed in arrabbiata sauce.  That is what your menu description should have read.  I would have ordered that with no further expectations.

There's so much to rave about, but let me also add. I RARELY drink soda or sugary beverages, but the soda fountain here has sodas made with cane sugar & extract oils. They are not too sweet, they are delicious!

Glad we chose to come here for our date day.

 Hubby ordered a caulifire and a slow boat to China. I had Tu-Nuts and a spicy Latina. We were ""supposed"" to share. He did, I didn't.

The caulifire was good, a little vinegary but light. Both the slow boat to China and Tu-Nuts were pretty filling yet refreshingly good. I preferred the Tu-Nuts just because I'm a poke freak. The spicy Latina was muy Caliente! It was cheesy, creamy, spicy yet light. Everything was good. 

We walked out of there feeling satisfied. So glad they're in my side of town. We will definitely be back. I already know what I'm ordering next :)

SkinnyFATS got me on all kinds of indecision, and it totally affects my ODC.  I mean, it's already hard for me to make a decision on where to eat...let alone what to eat!  So needless to say, it took me a while to decide what I wanted to order.  My family...not so much.  After a brief pause, we ordered:

*T.A.T.S. (healthy) - Turkey bacon, avocado, tomato, spinach and spicy mayo on 9 grain bread

*Cinnutella (happy) - Cinnamon sugar French toast, berries, spiced Nutella, orange agave

*The Big (Bad) Parm (happy & on their secret menu) - Garlic brushed toasted hoagie with breaded chicken, fresh mozzarella and marinara

Overall, good food!  The T.A.T.S was tasty...but would have been 100x better with actual bacon!  Forget the healthy!  Go swiney!  Nice, thick 9 grain bread, lots of fresh avocado and veggies.  Kid was OK with the Cinnutella, but it was hard to distinguish where the actual Nutella was.  Was it supposed to be in that spiced Nutella sauce of sorts?  If so it was light on taste.  The orange agave was good but my kid wasn't too interested in it.  Plus the serving was on the small side for being an actual breakfast entrée.  It would have been better with 4 slices instead of just 2.  The Big (Bad) Parm was definitely a BIG sandwich!  Not much in terms of veggies going on here, folks!  Just look at the pic, all I see is red & white!  Carbs, breading, sauce, and more carbs!  But damn did it make me happy!  Crispy garlic bread, fat breaded chicken breast, topped with a load of mozzarella & marinara!  Like an Italian dinner in a bun!  Mangia!

The regular fries and the sweet potato fries at SkinnyFATS were great as well.  Kind of a thinner cut, but fried crisp and easy to eat.  Damn near addictive with their branded ketchups!!

Only issue I have here is that SkinnyFATS isn't exactly skinny on the wallet.  Entrée items are a bit on the high side but thankfully for the most part the food is very good.  But don't get me started on those expensive fresh juices!  Near the cost of some actual food!  Wow!

Service for us was friendly, quick, and pretty knowledgeable on both sides of the menu.  I know I asked a lot of questions!  Perhaps on my next visit I'll try something on the healthy side of the menu!  But....maybe not.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,9,9,4,NvujAvjvJifTc1GoogjBcA

The truffle fries were hot, crispy, and tasty. My companion had the Chickawaffledoplis. The chicken tenders were nicely breaded and crispy fried. The waffle was fluffy and light.

Most importantly, I no longer have to drive 30+ minutes to get my SF fix.  Just in case you haven't been to SF, I'll educate you a little.  This is the 3rd location in the Las Vegas.  The menu is separated by a Healthy side (the skinny) and a Happy side (not so healthy). Thus the name, SkinnyFATS.  

I've been a fan of SkinnyFATS since day one.  And over the years, I found what I really like here.  I usually order their Wrap Supastar (Chicken & Egg White Wrap).  It's my favorite simply because there's so much protein in it. It taste good too. On this visit, I decided to get something off the happy side of the menu.  I got their Meltdown, which is basically a double meat patty melt.  My patty melt was very good and it came with a side of soup. The overall menu consist of Shareables (the apps), Between the Buns (Sandwiches & Burgers), Tacos, Things in Bowls (exactly how it sounds), and Breakfast (I shouldn't have to explain what that is).  Besides the drinks, the prices are very good and the portions are big.  The line was little slow, but it wasn't due to the staff.  The staff was efficient. There is a lot on their menu and the customers in front of us were just a little undecided.  

Just a note...currently, this location has items that cannot be found at the other locations.  

Just another note...off the menu items can be found on their TV screens by the register. 

Just a final note...I love SkinnyFats' initials SF.

4078347,2017-01-10,1,W6s1BQa6N3mU6UBTv_KqSw,"Finally! It's about time the Northside gets some cool restaurants. That means less gas and time wasted traveling across town for this gem of a restaurant. 

Unlike the Dean Martin location, this place is much more spacious and have plenty of seating (yes, no more table hogging like savages). Of course, their interior is definitely up to par with their other locations; super hippie and great for pictures! haha. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgable of the menu so no worries if you have any questions.

Just like their other locations, they provide, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free options; so this is great for a group of people with different lifestyles. 
So here's what my friend and I got:
--Salmon Overboard: A cucumber boat with a generous slab of buttery salmon topped with a creamy spicy slaw. Great appetizer or mini entree if you're not too hungry. It comes with 4 pieces and is listed under 'Shareables' in the menu, but honestly I ate it all to myself. lmao. 
--Naked Chix: Chicken topped with a mango basil sauce placed on top of cauliflower rice. I've never tried cauliflower rice before but I am quite impressed! Although it tastes nothing like normal rice, it still is a great alternative for those eating low carb.

Altogether, a great first impression of this place! They're about to open an extension called Coldpress Express so I'm definitely looking forward to that!",2yPRCQMd2u0ka7r5IdITBQ,4,3,4,N7L5ziVdm1P0dErpt4DBdg

Awesome Customer Service from The Order Counter, to Table Service. Friendly & Sometimes Playful, lol!

I digress...

They do have Healthy and Happy Juices & Shakes like the Delicious Cucumber that are made on their Cold Press Side of the Eatery. I do believe they have Cucumber Water as well, but just ask them. ;)

The Tu-Nuts that I spoke of earlier consisted of Fresh Ahi Meat & Spicy Slaw, Sitting in a Cucumber Boat, sprinkled with Almonds, Teriyaki Sauce, Avocado Slices and, Sriracha Aioli, it was on their Shareable Menu, but I could easily eat all of the delicious goodness myself!

 The Delicious Cucumber Shake that I had consisted of Juiced Cucumbers, Strawberries & Lemons, with your choice of Ice Cream or Froyo, 2% Milk, or Soy Milk.

Mom had been there before, but she wanted to try something different.  (By the way, she's had the Berry Strong protein waffle and loved it.)  The register cashier was so helpful with his suggestions.  He explained what was on the menu and gave a few ideas for us.  

We both ended up ordering one of his choices off the Healthy side menu. I had the Bleu Balsamic.  The portion size was nice, the steak was abundant, and the ingredients were fresh!  Next time, I'd ask for the balsamic on the side, because the vinegar was a bit too overpowering.  Mom had the Avocatoast.  She loved it and finished every bite.  I loved that both meals were under 550 calories and quite filling.  They also have Happy Side meals, which aren't so low in calories and would make anyone comforted!  And included in their menu are vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options.

Parking is close, free and plentiful.  They are in a major strip center, so don't panic if you don't see them from the street.  Just drive along the side and you'll find them.  It's worth it!",DjcRgZ0cJbf6-W2TxvFlBA,2,2,4,SAlE3_8hf3c-iYYgHvwubw

Went there Saturday morning just after opening and it wasn't too crowded. We were in the area and didn't research much in reviews since we were hungry. Made our order and grabbed a table.
I got a coffee and wasn't sure if refills were available since it looked like it was only behind the counter and nobody was doing top offs. Not a big deal and I didn't go and ask since I had water too.
My husband got the chicken and waffles. He said both were ok, nothing amazing.
I got the avocado-tofu scramble sandwich. They don't mention in the description that they use curry or some strong seasoning in it. I really didn't like it. My stomach wasn't in great shape to begin with and I found it nauseating. I ate half because I had ordered it, but thank goodness it came with a side. The truffle fries were really good. And I realized after I left that the sandwich had dyed my fingers yellow.

The drink cups are actually very sturdy and are made to be reused. So you can even put them in the dishwasher. They also have an option to recycle them at the restaurant instead of just throwing them in the trash. This is cool, you know, save the earth and all. The food was very tasty and fresh. The employees were nice and helpful. It was clean and I liked the atmosphere. My only complaint is that the portion to price was off. I don't mind paying for quality, but it was a little over $10 for 1/4 cup of hummus, a small pita bread, cup of soup, and small drink. I was honestly still hungry when I was done.

Super casual and never packed when we go, maybe because we try to go late night. Cashiers are always helpful since we've had different ones each time we come in and we always ask their opinion on favorites. 

Appetizers we've had: 
Balls 2.0- AMAAAAZING, don't question just try it. You won't be disappointed 

Truffle fries: although big in size, it lacked flavor and zero truffle flavor. I wouldn't say I'm a truffle fry expert, but I have had my fair share. 

Main dishes: 
Naked chix: really good, hubb's staple dish

More cow bowl: I'm so disappointed that the beef is so chewy, I've ordered the beef dish twice and still chewy so I've given up ordering anything 'filet mignon' mentioned on their menu. Other than that the taste of the dish is pretty good, just a bummer that the beef is such a disappointment. 

Turnip taco: good, yet again the beef was such a downfall. Def would swap out for ahi

It's just a great place for lunch.  I love that the menu is split down the middle for healthy options and fat options.  I love that I can order a beer or a fruit a smoothie.  The Nutella shakes are amazing.  The buff chicks (buffalo tenders) are among the best in the city, maybe the best.  The truffle fries are a great side for the tenders, and the sauces are to die for.  Skinny fats offers peppercorn, jalapeño, and pineapple ketchup; all of which are extraordinary.  In fact, I even buy them by the bottle and use them at home.  

All this talking about skinny fats, and I want it more than ever.  I really hope they're open right now..",x7tsmp5lbgWXQ72pkwEWPg,1,0,5,l4SbLEeHEX4BY6922F2tBQ

Firstly, the staff here are super pleasant! They're friendly, energetic and helpful. I totally think the service here rocks when most order and pay type establishments really don't offer much service at all. 

The food has been pretty solid. I have favorites on the menu: caulifire, teri-ahi sandwich, smotherload (ask for more sauce!),more cow bowl. And there's always something different on their secret menu, their 420 menu, a different weekend or monthly benedict and Sunday Sundae. What's cool and what sucks about the various benedict and sundaes is that they don't repeat... I've had some favorites (chicken curry benedict called curry underwood, and a carrot cake waffle sundae). I really like the ma the meatloaf sandwich and blaze of thunder spicy chicken that's off menu. 

I tried Skinnyfats years ago in the OG location and my impression was pretty ""meh"" due to execution. What a difference a few years and location makes! I've actually gone back to that location and the SW one.... This one is THE location! The food is cooked better, the staff is more on it. I've been about a dozen times and only had one day that they looked short staffed so they really weren't at fault for that day being subpar. 

I'm glad this isn't far from my house! If I don't know what I want to eat I just go to skinny fats",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,30,22,5,KWZlo7zhlX3FwuaXBrIf5g

After a couple of less than pleasant experiences at their first location over on Dean Martin, I had been abstaining for quite some time. My husband convinced me to have lunch here today, and I admit to protesting just a little but gave in.

Katie was our cashier today, she was awesome! Very personable and understanding when it came to doing a bit of customizing on my order to avoid dairy and wheat. Easy peasy with the Tu-Nuts. We also ordered a Green Mile cold pressed juice to share- delicious. And I'm glad we shared between the two of us because it's a pretty big cup. My husband ordered a Chix on Broadway, but by mistake received a Chickhumm. No biggie, he still ate it anyway and finished it up, with a generous side of truffle fries. We also ordered a side of sweet potato truffle fries. I'm a bit of a sweet potato fry critic (much like T is a fry a hot dog critic) and one issue I have consistently noticed is that places can't get them crispy. I am thankful to report that this is not the case here today. We received a huge plate of them and they were SO good. Paired with their CHILLpotle ketchup... YUM.

Every member of their staff that we interacted with today was awesome. I have to give a shout out to the gal who brought out our food and also brought me a side of sriracha (thanks!) and also the one that found my phone, what a fail that would have been.

All in all, I'm happy that they have finally lived up to their hype. We'll definitely be back. OH, and if you can, snag a spot out on their patio- super chill.",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,5,2,5,5PDSPQ4WWj8GbpGWNSR_xA

After a meal here, you may be feeling more fat than skinny. My roommate brought home some delicious fried pickles the other night and I had to know where he got them. Sure enough, it was SkinnyFats. I was planning to make a trip over, but Bubs suprised me with a smorgasbord of items for dinner. We had fried pickles, a shrimp taco, a mahi taco, poke with cucumber, a sourdough burger with a side of truffle fries, and a mango shake. All of that was around $50. Decent portions but it did lean towards the pricey side. Sorry for the lack of pics. It all looked so good I couldn't hold back! The poke was served with avocado slices on a hollowed out cucumber. It completely fell apart, but the flavor profile was still good. Original way to serve poke. Nice and fresh. The only items that fell a little short were the truffle fries and the mahi taco. The taco had good sauce, but the fish was a tad on the dry side. The truffle fries were shoe string skinny. I may be biased but I prefer thick cut.

As soon as you make your way to the order counter, there's always a big bright smile waiting for you. And I remember when they first opened, we were guinea pigs for menu items they were testing out and they were very receptive to feedback. My friends and family have been coming here every week after the gym since then...sometimes, even more that some employees already know what I'm about to order. I appreciate people who remember little things - it shows that they pay attention and care enough. That or I'm just very predictable.

Moving on to their food...they have a ""skinny"" side and a ""happy"" side on the menu. ""Skinny"" would be the healthier options, and ""happy"" includes fried, rich, or sweet options. I've tried items from both sides and I haven't had anything I didn't like. A list of what I normally get:

Zucc It (spiralized zucchini with steak, eggplant, squash, peppers, mushrooms and arrabiatta sauce)

Buff Chix (buffalo chicken tenders with a side of truffle fries)
Slow Boat to China
Smoke in a Bowl

More Cow Bowl
Charlie Brownie (Nutella, strawberry, banana, froyo, almond milk shake)
Cinnutella (cinnamon-sugar French toast with spiced Nutella and orange syrup)

Kids seared chicken, fruit, and honey mustard) nice to Greek you, (flat bread, grilled chicken, onions, tomatoes, balsamic dressing and Greek sauce who's name I am blanking), smoke in a bowl (BBQ grilled chicken, cauliflower rice, sautéed onions and peppers, cilantro yo and my husband got it with mango salsa instead of beans, Phenomenal, will be ordering again, and again) and buff chick (buffalo chicken, and truffle fries, PERFECTION.)

All were amazing! Kids meals are reasonably priced especially given the amount of food. 

We will be returning. Often.",wk_Tw4BuYmsbRcP4gCI-Cg,0,0,5,g926e0LLVSUhNKagMfWW4g

I was honestly turned off by the name ""Skinny Fats"" because it sounded like it might be a ""Heart Attack Grill"" kind of place, but it's completely different, and I'll explain what I love about it. 

*I love how friendly the hostess is, Mariana I think was her name. 

*I love that they have a ""Healthy/Low Calorie"" menu AND a ""Fatty""-- but still fairly healthy menu as well. 

*I love the fact that they have very good coffee, in real mugs, with free refills, and the mugs, as strange as this may sound, are really enjoyable to drink from. Specifically the top of the mug just fits your mouth better. Again-- I know that probably sounds really strange, but I think you'll know what I mean when you try them. 

*I love the food!! I had the breakfast sandwich (I forget what it was called) and it was delicious and just $8.95. It also came with a side order of your choice. I chose the sweet potato fries (mainly because they are healthier) but my friend got the house potatoes and the house potatoes were delicious! 

*I even liked the fact that the men's room had a unique hand dryer different than any I have seen before. 

*The seating is very comfortable as well (large booths with comfortable backing).

*I could go on with things that I like and or love about this place, but I will leave it at the fact that the prices are very affordable for the quality of food and the experience you have.  

This is an easy 5 star review and I will definitely be back.",jdb99ppiySCe_bDsb7NXTA,0,0,5,7zpoI0xn2ycMhJOCARiPOA

Those that did were never disappointed! So when our trip to Zion took us past North Vegas I was so happy to see a restaurant right off the freeway & we stopped in! I had the Cherry Pepper Burger & this is a 6 napkin burger! AMAZING! Sweet potatoes fries were perfectly cooked! My BF has the Sriracha Ahi Tuna tacos & loved them!

What the steak is marinated in was very salty. My fries were the same...too salty. I had to use a napkin to remove some of the salt, finally asking a server if the could make more fries with less salt. The fruit salad has been around for a while. I can only assume from the appearance is that this comes from a package and not prepared fresh daily.

I've had a hanger to partake from both happy and healthy sides, and they both have incredible options. As I am working to eat a little cleaner, I'll share from the healthy side. Cluck Moo is probably one of my favorite any-time-of-the-day meals. I surprised myself by enjoying the Naked Chix, chicken with mango over cauliflower rice. Everything was surprisingly flavor-packed, and the cauliflower rice was not nearly the bland, lifeless dish I assumed it would be! 

As for environment, the place is stunning - the atmosphere and decor are a mix of modern, eclectic, thrift, and just COOL. The bathrooms were clean and have the coolest dual faucet/air dryer I've ever seen. They stay fairly busy but get the food out fast. If there's a line to order, it can be tough to see/read the overhead menu; they planned ahead and provided a ton of menu pamphlets throughout the ordering line, and have visual screens displaying some food options as well.

All in all a great visit with great atmosphere and delicious food. I'll gladly go back!",NO7hzgi7ZS3b2D5gNi2Gfg,1,1,5,zUxJBsH4dTq2EH81NVN3Vg
5620639,2017-01-10,5,W6s1BQa6N3mU6UBTv_KqSw,"Living in the north part of Las Vegas has meant that we need to drive some distances to our favorite eateries, but 2017 is starting off right with the opening of SkinnyFATS' third location.  Located off of the 215 and Decatur near BestBuy, this is excellent news for us because we don't live too far away at all.  We've been fans since the first SF opened on Dean Martin and now we can become regulars here.  

What's so great about SkinnyFATS?  The menu offers up the healthy side and the happy side, so depending on what your diet and stomach wants on any given day, you can find an item to satisfy you.  There are also vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options if you need those.  Plus, the staff is friendly and answer any questions you may have about the menu.

Located in an already busy shopping plaza (the Costco side), just head for Massage Envy and BestBuy and you'll find it.  I'm giving you directions this way so you don't drive around in circles.  The interior of the restaurant has the cool murals like the other locations, a communal table, booths, and tables, plus several flat-screens.  The menu here boasts items that the other locations don't have, too.

We had dinner here last night and the joint was jumping.  There was a line to the door for ordering, but I didn't really mind since they did just open and it gave us a chance to peruse the menu.  I went with the Healthy Side's T.A.T.S.:  turkey bacon, avocado, tomato, and spinach on 9 grain toast, skipping the spicy yo sauce because I'm a wimp.  This comes with a side and I decided to get happy with truffle fries:  balance!  It was a great little meal and I'd have this healthier version of a BLT again.

I tried the b/f's Spicy Latina soup side and it was spicy, but very tasty, so try this chicken soup with tortilla strips and pepper jack cheese if you're in the mood.
For a first visit at a location that just opened its doors, we left with our Happy Meter reading at ""overjoyed.""  See you soon, SkinnyFATS.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,9,7,4,gQe4KT0DSVSf2AEI-Ev8uQ

She got the skinny fats punch which is fruity and good. I got the hangover remedy. It was very heavy on the ginger or I'm sensitive to ginger because that's all I could taste. Next time I would request no ginger or very little. I put ice in it to weaken it up a bit. Nice environment and staff.,OWPMRewj-pwDQissu2vlDQ,0,0,4,fR3AMGXvNNVNbOeYmRQ_pQ
5646835,2017-11-21,2,W6s1BQa6N3mU6UBTv_KqSw,"Really cool restaurant. This chain restaurant is unique because it has two different menus to order from. The ""healthy"" side is for people tying to watch their weight and the ""happy"" side is for more flavorful, higher calorie foods. The decor here is really nice. There is a nice outdoor seating area perfect for anytime except summer, and the inside sitting area is very trendy. My personal opinion, I like this restaurant but I'm not blown away by it. Everything I had on the healthy side is mediocre at best (I was a vegan for 2 months and came here often because I work close by). In their defense, healthy food doesn't always taste the best. The happy side of the menu does taste good but I feel is too pricey for what it is. I enjoy the water dispenser because they add cucumber slices in the water which adds a refreshing taste to it. I'll probably come here occasionally because I work close by. I enjoy this place, the service is really good and the atmosphere is fun, but I can't see myself eating here more than once every other month.",4lWQjFGyGQZa61AfdcRr_Q,5,2,4,I2wkoS-5D_kuwvyFA8Ekmg

Being that it was our first time I looked at the menu prior to going, so I had an idea what I wanted. That being said when you walk in you order at the counter, so you either have to look at the menu on the screens or on a paper menu. Ordering took a tad longer then I would have thought it would but  I got the children's chicken fingers and fries, children shakes, Balls 2.0, fried pickles, steakation (with sweet potato fries) and swinology (with regular fries). The kids enjoyed their chicken and fries and their shakes. The fried pickles were ok but they were served with some weird sauce that I found off putting. The Balls 2.0 were ok, the balls themselves had no flavor but the sauce they were served with helped a lot. I had the steakation and found it very, very dry. For the amount of bun there was I think it needed to have some sauce or something because it just felt dry. Even when I tried to just eat the inside of the sandwich without the meat everything was dry. My husband had the swinology and said it was ok and he could live without coming again. We like to drink water and so if you opt not to get a soda and want water be prepared to get up a couple times during your meal to do so, or grab more then one cup.

To start off with the Balls 2.0 fell short from the ones we had at Warm Springs. They were dry and solid like an over cooked meatball and the aioli sauce fell flat. (Warm Springs did an amazing job on the Balls 2.0) 

I also ordered an VG bowl dish that I can't recall the name but it had noodles, curry sauce and topped with fried chickpeas. It sounded amazing but when it came (and after the waitress left) I noticed no chickpeas. Being a vegetarian dish the chickpeas was equivalent to ordering More Cow Bowl and not getting any meat. 

Maybe I missed the chickpeas? It's possible. So I rooted around my bowl for a bit like a hungry stray dog looking for a treat but couldn't find any. I asked my wife and she came to the same conclusion soooo I notified the waitress. The waitress was very apologetic and said she'd have the cook make me a side of fried chickpeas on the double. 10 minutes later, my dish getting slightly colder as I sat there patiently waiting as child waits for mom to finish dinner a different waitress/staff member came up to me to advise that they're almost ready.

My wife was finishing up her meal and mine still sitting there flaccid and cold chickpealess when my chickpeas finally arrive. The chickpeas were hot, crunchy and delicious. It would have complimented my meal well (when it was still warm).
