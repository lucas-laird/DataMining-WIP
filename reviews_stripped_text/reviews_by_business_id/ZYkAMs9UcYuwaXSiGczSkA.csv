975013,2013-06-06,1,ZYkAMs9UcYuwaXSiGczSkA,"Ran through the drive thru today on the way to work for the much advertised ""Egg White Delight McMuffin"".  250 calories & 7 grams of fat! (versus the regular Egg McMuffin-300 calories and 12 grams of fat)  Oh hells yes!   I am a HUGE fan of the Egg McMuffin and was excited to try this one.  If only McDonalds would serve these breakfast sandwiches all the time and not just the morning my whole darn world would be brighter!  Sigh!  I think I need to start a petition!

Anyways, back to my sandwich.  The egg was fluffy, light and airy.  Totally not what I expected but hugely amazed at how good it was.  It wasn't dry like I had thought it would be.  The cheese was a white cheese versus the American cheese on the Egg McMuffin.  I didn't notice much different.  Overall the Egg White Delight is probably better than the Egg McMuffin.  Ooops shhhhh did I just say that?  

The service was alright.  Nothing too crazy but it WAS in the drive thru.  As long as everything comes out as ordered all is good right?  My only complaint which is always my complaint with Micky D's is they never put very much ice in their drinks.  Why is that?  SMH",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,3,1,3,ZucIqgo4BHfUlxdQJnyoHg

It was early so they weren't busy and we got our food promptly and it was accurate. What stood out most to me was a young man, who's name I might be getting wrong here, Chauncey. He was so polite, greeting us on the way in, checking up on us at our table and at the other tables asking if everything was good and if we needed something. That has never happened to me at a McDonalds before. He kept busy, sweeping the floors and wiping down tables. I was just so impressed with his courteous, hard work. I forgot to mention that I had gone up to order another round of pancakes for the bottomless pit that is my son. They're weren't busy so they delivered the food to us instead of just calling out our number.

2238139,2014-12-13,0,ZYkAMs9UcYuwaXSiGczSkA,"Over the past few months, my consumption of McDonald's food has markedly increased, thanks to an increase in my cycling mileage.  I mean, really, when else is it acceptable, nay, even expected, to replenish lost salts and calories via Mickey D's?  Thus, my feelings towards McD's may be skewed to be more positive than most yelpers.  When I dropped into this McDonald's for a quick lunch break during a bike ride, I was famished and heartily devoured a hot cheeseburger and fresh fries in approximately 2 seconds.  After inhaling my lunch, I noticed that the place was clean and, after a quick visit to the loo, the restroom was clean as well.  Staff seemed pleasant enough and got both my husband's order and mine correct (although that should really be a given).

2847149,2018-06-04,0,ZYkAMs9UcYuwaXSiGczSkA,Went here to get a quarter pounder and a Coke. They had two drive through lanes and I picked one. Shortly thereafter someone pulled up into the second one and placed their order and drove through. WTF? I was there first. I was ignored until I yelled into the speaker that I would like to place an order. Employee taking the order couldn't get it through her head that I didn't want fries. I only wanted quarter pounder and a Coke. She really did find it difficult to comprehend. After paying for my order I went to the second window and was told to drive to the waiting area for the quarter pounder. Kind of weird this McDonald's has a dedicated waiting area. Defeats the purpose of a drive-through. After a few minutes an employee came out and delivered to me a quarter pound or with way too much to ketchup.

When I order I always ask for something to be added or removed so that I know that it is fresh. I usually have my order to eat there so that if there is any issue I can get it fixed. Since the remodel it gets busy here during lunch hour as I believe the kids from the high school come for lunch break.

First time I was there I told him I wanted the new egg white mcmuffin with the white cheese ( I even POINTED to the huge pictures they have displayed on the wall)  and i want sausage.  When I opened it up, there was american cheese on it.  

When I went the 2nd time in the drive thru, I ordered a sausage egg biscuit and a sausage egg white muffin with the white cheese, and a hashbrown. I had a buy one get one coupon and my total was only $2.40 I knew right then he messed it up.  Sure enough, I pay and open my bag and there was canadian bacon on my sandwich instead of sausage and no egg on my sausage egg biscuit.  

Both times I was the only person there. I'd hate to see what kind of mistakes they make when their busy.
