So as semi-embarrassing as it is, I order the kid's meal with grilled cheese, tater tots, and Ocean Water, a delicious blue Sprite-like soda drink. The grilled cheese is always on thick, spongy bread and made to perfection. And the tots.... oh the tots. SO good. I also ordered a snack trio that comes with mozzarella sticks, tots, and onion rings. The food came out quickly but they did forget the marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks, but it was still delicious without. 

Sonic is always quick and easy, and the price is always nice; they even have a $1 menu now. The food is always great and they have items I totally crave in a drive-in setting that is very convenient.",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,4,4,4,nl7idR-QoSrWQ-DQqhMC1Q

I first tried sonic when I was a fresh transplant, and I guess I liked it enough, because I kept going back. 

Over the past couple of years, though, as I upgraded my eating habits, I became more and more disappointed in the quality of their food. It's actually to the point that I don't eat here anymore and will only get drinks or shakes because after every meal it seems I have some pretty major stomach issues (I'll spare you all the gory details!).

But. . . tots are just a side (well, to most people).  Sonic also has burgers and hot dogs, but they're mediocre.  But in a town with In n' Out and Five Guys, why would you order a fast food burgers from Sonic?

2000683,2013-11-18,1,WlTeMP8p3m1b3LxkfBllLQ,"Normally I reserve my review writing for restaurants that serve great food, I'll make an exception this time.

Everyone knows that Sonic isn't the best place to eat, unless you want your arteries to clog and your heart to fail you generally just come every now and then for a shake or to get that tater tot fix.

I happen to drop by here frequently because I'm a big fan of the Rt. 44 Diet Coke. This isn't my favorite Sonic, that's the awesome one on Warm Springs and Eastern, but this is sometimes closer to me. 

So, drop by here one day and sit and sit and sit, just waiting on my oh-so-difficult order of a soft drink. I see one person go through the drive-thru, then another, then another. I finally buzz asking where my drink is. I'm on lunch and I have a job that isn't as easy as delivering a drink to a customer so I've got to get back to it. I wait and see ANOTHER car go through. I buzz again. A few minutes later FINALLY someone comes to give me my drink. Without a straw. Nice. 

So, I give this dump another chance and drop by today. This time I have a coupon for a free drink. I go so often I deserve a free one every now and then. I have some teenager with an attitude problem (working at Sonic, of course you do) confront me and ask for my coupon. I tell him I use this all the time. He demands it again. I tell him to get his manager. His manager, who barely speaks English, comes out and I discuss the problem with him. He PRETENDS like he cares and is going to fix the problem. 

I wait and wait and wait. Nothing. I buzz and ask for my drink (anyone see a pattern?). Says it's coming, nothing. Finally I get my drink FULL of ice, little drink and just want to get out of this trashy place.

This Sonic isn't a corporate store, it's a franchise and they do not give a sh** about you. Go to any other Sonic because they are awesome. This one blows. Ugh.",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,5,2,1,_V1olPX0C38qxbblgfnKqw

2533878,2007-03-20,1,WlTeMP8p3m1b3LxkfBllLQ,"In the fast food world Sonic ranks right up there for four very important reasons:

Cherry Dr Pepper.

Tots.

Breakfast burritos.

Breakfast burritos with tots inside.

I'm not the biggest fan in the world of a Sonic burger.  Their chicken  sandwiches are ho-hum.  Their wraps are actually good, and if you get the grilled chicken one it's actually not too bad for you, either.  Nothing else on the menu really grabs me where it counts, ya know?  By no matter what, if I get it with a side of tots and a Cherry Dr Pepper I'm a happy girl.  Better yet, if I get one of their, frankly, pretty effing awesome breakfast burritos encapsulating not only the eggs and peppers and all that goodness but also acting as an edible treasure chest full of tots I'm over the moon!

Their soda fountain can't be beat.  I loved it as a kid and I love it now.  Although I'm pretty much firmly ensconced in the Cherry Dr Pepper camp, you can add one of TONS of flavors to any drink, not just your traditional chocolate, vanilla and cherry.  Orange, grape, watermelon, coconut, lemon, lime, strawberry - the list goes on and on.

It's still funny to see the carhops come out in their roller blades.  I know Sonic gave up it's trying-to-do-the-50s thing a while ago, but the roller blades still crack me up.",VeYSD3Xgxd-R4yowet51tA,2,1,4,qVlLz9obcdvWgDmoCoiUCg

They have tons of floats, limeades. cream smoothies. they can mix just about every flavor ever. And it's not all sugary syrups, a lot of their flavors are fruit juices and purees blended in. 

They had/ have? a dollar menu. It was at the Flamingo location across the Palms and then suddenly gone. They may be erratic depending on location. 

they have delicious tater tots, also, but you have to ask for tots when you get a combo meal, or they'll automatically throw in fries. The burgers are kinda plain, but they have a hugr toaster burger on texas toast that's great.
