Staff was the most friendly and accommodating. This has got to be the cleanest bar in Vegas. One guy was constantly cleaning which indicates this place is well managed.

If X tells customer A his $ is no longer acceptable--

4447923,2017-03-24,6,vmg_VdqXVOVhUoacU2pfdw,"The Bar has really grown on me and is now one of my favorite local spots! Located right on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wigwam. The Bar is a solid bar for gaming, drinks, and food. 

Food:
- The buffalo chicken dip is life. Ask anyone who's tried it. A piping hot generous portion of Buffalo Dip (filled with cheesy deliciousness, hot sauce, and diced chicken breast) served with tortilla chips. I'm pretty sure I order this every time I go
- Buffalo Chicken Wrap; Very tasty, filled with veggies and ranch/buffalo sauce. Comes with tater tots or fries. Both are bomb but I love the tots Usually stick to drinks and dip if I'm here but there has been a few times where I've been starving and got this wrap 

Drinks:
- Blue Moons are my go to beer - always go for the bigger size!
- Pretty standard selection of beers, liquors, and wine... Never had a disappointing experience with their drinks 

Gaming:
- Trying to cut back on my degenerate habits but if you like video poker, keno, black jack, etc. the machines here are great. Video Poker sucks me in every time. I've won a few 4 of a kinds with and one of my girlfriends hit a royal the other night! 

Ambiance:
- Dimly lit, average sized bar. Bar seating around the main rectangular bar and plenty of booth and table seating
- My previous review mentioned it was smokey. Still kinda is (to be expected anywhere smoking is allowed) but not as bad as I recalled my first few times visiting when they originally opened over 2 years ago 

Service:
- The bartenders here are SO nice and attentive! It's difficult to come across a bar where the service is consistently way above average. There's a tall female bartender with long dark hair that's always smiling and super sweet. There's a ton of regulars who come here and I'm sure the service here is a huge part of the reasoning! 

Oh and there's shuffle board in the back. I'm terrible at this game but it's always fun to play with good company. Love The Bar!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,9,7,5,I57QMzFnERRuJQHEnGs6fA

Very clean, approachable gaming bar, that makes you feel comfortable and welcome when you come in. The reason for the 4 stars and not full 5 was a mix up with my food order.

We drove down Las Vegas Blvd. and everything was closed except for a few fast food restaurants.  Not wanting fast food we kept driving and spotted the Bar was open!  Well to our surprise the place was not what we expected. The dinning area was warm and inviting with very comfortable booths. The food was exceptionally good and everything on the menu look appetizing.  Well after we got home from Las Vegas a week later my girl friend realized she had left her prescription glasses at the Bar. I contacted the Bar and describe the eye glasses and to my surprise they were still there.  The manager was nice enough to return the glasses to us in California.

From the outside it looks kind of corporate or industrial, not too inviting but with nine foot letters that say BAR there is no mistaking what it is.  

Inside is a different experience altogether, a great atmosphere, a lively crowd and some really amazing and engaging bartenders and staff!    I absolutely love Lindsay and Spencer.  I met them the first night of my recent visit to LV and after one brief meeting they remembered my name the rest of my stay.   Lindsay is the kind of bartender that when you say you want to settle up she flat out says ""No!""  You smile, take it as a compliment and order another drink. (then quietly pay your tab and sneak out when she isn't looking) 

The food is really very good.  One time I tried the tomato soup and grilled cheese the other I had a chicken tender appetizer.   

One morning I was heading to breakfast and when I looked up the restaurant I realized that it opened at 8am, it was 7:15.  No problem, The Bar is open 24/7 so I popped in, visited my favorite bartender (end of her shift) and ordered a Bloody Mary...Just the right spice... oh, and the drink, it too had the right amount of spice.",Uk3X2AypU8AqvcYEVf7s6Q,0,0,4,vXj0exnD4Ds3f3KydbHqzw

Adam and Patrice took care of me however every member down to the Barback makes sure to give you the best service! If you haven't been try the bacon cheddar tots followed by the fried Oreos!! They have 4 locations and hands down the cleanest and best food out of all bars in Las Vegas!",h9Qu4M-uM2BbGRxUbxBX_A,1,1,5,thNvEqFpK51be8FteCN3Vw

My party of 2 sat at the bar while one of us was gaming and one was eating. The menu is pretty solid and above average for a poker bar. They have a card now for their slot club, instead of the former weird black doodaddy that sorta looks like a key. They have a wheel promo also that you get to spin for hitting a 4 of a kind. 

I was happy it wasn't smoky while we were there. Staff was friendly and had suggestions about the menu when asked. The drink selection is pretty nice and they even had quite a variety of wine beyond red or white, which I appreciate. This was mentioned in other reviews, and also stands out for me- the access. LVBS can be a bitch to drive on, and that would be a factor for me when considering to return here or not.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,3,1,4,vzgTfHC6QVfMyDU1qkGPdQ

Great place to stop in for a cocktail, watch sports and have a snack anytime! Their menu is great- good bar food options and some with an added twist. The food is GREAT! The place is super clean, nice friendly staff, and the place is open 24/7.",6NYDXzkyYW3O2zYjzPRMsg,0,1,4,jMNQiFO4bJI72SAcX9ovRg
