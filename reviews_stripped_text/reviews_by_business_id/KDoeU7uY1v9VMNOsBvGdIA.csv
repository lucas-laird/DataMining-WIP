At first I was a little nervous to eat here just because it's connected to a Motel, and the area surrounding the restaurant is notoriously sketchy. I braved my fears and stopped by the other afternoon with my hubby and baby. I have to say the food was super delicious, and my hubby said that many of the dishes tasted close to what his mom cooks at home. Which in my opinion is the ultimate compliment. We had the spicy chicken, spicy seafood tofu soup, and kimchi onion pancake. It was all super amazing. We also enjoyed the traditional appetizers served before the meal as well. Our food also included Daikon soup, which many restaurants dont serve with their food and I really like. If you're looking for a good, reasonably priced korean restuarant near the base. This is your place! Plus our waitress was great, very friendly and helpful. Try it out!",_SVRjnfpqenbLZDYrBhrNg,6,2,4,T6ItqSbp8FLrmZTRfm2rUA
