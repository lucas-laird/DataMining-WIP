Soju was great and they had a buy 2 get 1 deal. We also had kamikaze drinks and they definitely got the night going.

So I was really happy with the service, from the host that setup our over the phone reservation, to the attentiveness of the staff. Justin was fantastic, very fast in getting us our drinks and helpful working the karaoke machine.

Overall was a great time with local friends. I highly recommend ZiZZYS because of the service. I work in the service industry and I can say that the staff tonight were great!!

1404228,2015-01-20,14,FqA7ofYWGVHnAIF4jjznHA,"Zizzy is quietly becoming one of my favorite spots in town to grab a drink or a quick bite of bar food here in Vegas. What I like most about this place is their happy hour, which lasts from 6pm to 9pm. 

This little bar is located in the popular strip mall that houses Ichiza, Tea Station, and a bunch of other crowd pleasing eateries. Parking here can get kinda crazy, especially during peak hours, so sometimes it's better to park in the Chinatown Mall, right next door, and walk over.

I like the dark, intimate setup when you walk through the door. There are a few small tables where groups can hang out. This place is also a Korean karaoke bar, with rooms in the back where you can unleash your inner Ariana Grande. There is a full kitchen in here, so you can order a wide variety of food options.

But, let's face it. You know I'm all about that HH. Zizzy has the best happy hour times of 6pm to 9pm. I mean, come on! That is ridonkulous!! On the board it says that the HH changes regularly, but the current promotion is half off drinks and $2 off apps. I got a bottle of yogurt soju for like 6 bucks. And Zizzy pours their YS stronger than Bazic or any other K-bar in town. Great deal. Also, got a huge mound of crispy, well seasoned fries for 3 bucks. Can't beat it. 

One of my favorite hang out spots with buds, bartenders are cool as hell, and will probably partake in some karaoke festivities in the very near future.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,19,16,4,fJrHqZVMImCffqucVlJcYw

2096000,2017-12-18,0,FqA7ofYWGVHnAIF4jjznHA,"No longer named Zizzy but now called Western Soondae, this small restaurant features all the traditional Korean food favorites.  The place looks very dark from the outside from the heavily tinted windows but is actually quite well lit in the small dining room inside with a bar.   Apparently, this used to be one of the go-to spots in Vegas for karaoke and drinks, but now seems much quieter and more family-friendly featuring full meals and table service, not just appetizers and drinks.  I have no idea if there is still karaoke or not seeing as how no one was singing there tonight.  

All three of us had the Hot Spicy Threaded Beef Soup which was very tasty.  Fearing the worst, I asked for only medium spicy and, honestly, I wish I had kept my mouth shut since the soup was missing the characteristic delicious BURN that I so love about Korean soups.  Each giant bowl (seriously where did they find bowls this HUGE??) was served with a small bowl of white rice on the side.  We were also served 3 different kinds of homemade pickles and kimchi for the banchan and a small side of cold japchae.  The banchan and the japchae were absolutely delicious and I only wish we had been offered more of them throughout the meal, as I'm accustomed to at all the other Korean restaurants I've ever been to...and a refill of the water container at our table.  The server was a very kind older Korean man but the extent of our interaction consisted of him taking our order and dropping off the food at our table when it was ready.  We were the only people in the restaurant for about half of our meal and he spent the entire time after dropping off our food somewhere in the back completely out of sight, only reappearing when other customers (all Korean) arrived.  Maybe he is not very confident in his English because he was very friendly and engaging with the Korean customers, not a bit like he was with us.  Thankfully, the food was very good so we had no reason to call him back to our table except for the empty water container.  At any rate, I believe we will definitely go back in the future to try other items on the menu, especially since they are open until 4 am!!",KadHfarZ0SHqvvz6hdiiRA,0,0,4,5XX-HbJiDrPscHR4ipgVxg

Perhaps we were just too early, but there were only 3 other people in there, and I think they were all friends of the bartender and server. The bar is rather small, and there are a couple of booths, then of course the kareoke rooms. 90s/2000s hip hop was playing, which I appreciated, but surprised me. Wedding Crashers was playing on one of the TVs, and No Strings Attached was on the other. No complaints, but again, strange. 

The best thing was that the bathroom was clean- actually, it smelled strongly of bleach. A good thing, too, because I dropped my cell phone in the toilet. Eeeek!!!!! I was truly horrified, but if the bathroom had been nasty, I may have had to sacrifice it. Luckily, my phone survived.

I went out to the bar and the bartender looked flustered and wasn't very helpful and to ask the male employee.

A lot of our songs would stop in the middle. I told the male bartender. He didn't seem to care and told me to tell the other employee. I guess he felt bad and later, they came to reset it and it finally worked. One of the male employees who wasn't a bartender was nice.

Just tell the bartender you are there for karaoke and he will take you to a room. They also have a small selection of snack foods and drinks. Price was $15 per hour which is similar to the other karaoke place I have been to. Only thing that sucked about my experience was the occasional feedback from the microphones which was annoying. The song selection is pretty old by about a year or so. They have a good selection of English songs, but they could work on updating and expanding their selection.

3532624,2016-05-19,0,FqA7ofYWGVHnAIF4jjznHA,Came for karaoke on a delirious trip. We were looking for J karaoke but came in here instead because we didn't pay attention from deliriousness. Perhaps it should have been for their food or drinks. So this review is for their karaoke side. It's got old songs...they don't have newer options. A lot of korean songs which is expected since it's a korean place. We don't know if there are new korean songs since we can't read korean. Sad English and other languages' selections. I didnt expect the Indonesian songs to be big but they have really waaayy old indonesian songs that nobody under 40 sings lol but probably most places are like that so that's not a complain. The mandarin is like 90s selection. The english is same story. The newest is probably from year 2004. We always have fun in karaoke places nonetheless.. And price for the room is really cheap.,_sGmH0de33hKAiFR0_0-HA,0,0,3,6VptUuU1KHmPpCQRuGfjXg

3824909,2017-02-18,1,FqA7ofYWGVHnAIF4jjznHA,"Stumbled upon this place when we were waiting to eat at Sushi Kaya just a few doors down in the shopping center. This place looks pitched black from the outside, but on the inside you'll find a retro korean karaoke bar, not your average korean bar. Being from out of town, this bar is a little more initiate than other korean bars I've been to. Granted it was a Wednesday night so we were the only ones in there the entire time we were there.

Our bartender Matt was awesome! He was still in training but I wouldn't have guessed if he hadn't told us. I ordered a Midori sour and my boyfriend got a beer. They have happy hour specials from 6-9 and after 9pm too. We didn't have a whole lot of time to spend in here, but if we did we probably would have taken more advantage of those happy hour specials!

They have private karaoke rooms for those of you that like to sing or are looking to have a good time. Everything inside was neat, clean, and very pleasant. I can see how busy this place could get on a weekend. 

Parking can be scarce in the small parking lot they have, but there are spaces available in the back of the building too. I'm glad we got to try this place out so we know where to come for karaoke when we come back!",CYAjJDdvPTZE_d23BDmr2Q,0,0,5,esh8It4F8RZmfi-N54KS2Q

Food: Bulgogi fries are a must try! You won't regret it!
Drinks: The bar is pretty well stocked and they have a decent selection of beer. Soju cocktails for the whole group are always fun and moderately priced. Best cocktail has got to be Marlan's Bitches and Cream or the Panty-dropper! Don't leave without trying it :)

4265816,2015-07-29,1,FqA7ofYWGVHnAIF4jjznHA,"Are you down to hydrate your non-alcohol-filled self? Well, you got a choice of hitting up the strip where a drink will cost you $8-$15, or you can go to PT's, or you can hit up this super quaint, but hole-in-the-wall type neighborhood spot. 

I was a bit skeptical coming in here, as there are not many places to sit. You come here with a group of people to take advantage of their drinks, and then maybe enjoy some karaoke while you're at it. 

Cocktails are modestly priced at about $4-$6. They have some great HH deals from 6-9p.m., where all drinks are 50% off, food is $2 off, and karaoke is $5 off/hour. I got to know the bartenders there (Jen and Justin) who are super cool, and I had a great time swapping really random stories, which I can hardly recall. 

Try the soju mixed drinks. It comes in a bottle where they mix half a bottle of soju with a ton of other flavors ranging from mango, strawberry, melon, yogurt, to apple and more. I didn't think it'd taste good, but it was surprisingly easy to go down, and does the job if you wanna let loose. The karaoke is a bit outdated, and they don't have the newest songs on file, but if you just want to sing some classics and some semi-recent songs that are maybe 6 months old, then you're good. 

I had a sampler, and it was really yummy. It came with onion rings, jalapeno poppers, chicken strips, and some other stuff, This is a super local, neighborhood joint, immediately next to Tea Station. I highly doubt I would have ever known about this place unless some local had brought it up. I think my review is super biased based on their HH because it can't be beat.

The videos were definitely interesting to say the least, but the song selection was very wide ranged, lots of English songs. They had a pretty decent food menu which was nice as well. We ended up sharing some of the jalapeño poppers, bulgogi fries, nachos and potstickers. I'd have to recommend the fries the most. They were delicious and the portion size was huge!

Every now and then they'll do special events with live DJs, ufc fights, etc.  They have happy hour from 6pm to 9pm EVERYDAY which is unheard of!  The karaoke rooms are fun, affordable, cozy and perfect if you want to get rowdy or just feel like singing your heart out.  Bring your crowd of friends or come by yourself to just unwind and you'll be taken care of by their awesome bartenders Justin, Angela, Marlon, Andy or Joseph.

Their flavored soju (watermelon, peach, and yogurt) are my favorite flavors! Packed with a semi sweet taste and a burst of flavor.

I love the interior of this place, what's awesome is that it doubles as a karaoke bar. It contains about 6 or 7 rooms for people to sing and get boozy among each other.
