It looked nothing like the picture, the bacon was totally crispy and crumbled all over the table, there was a thick layer of brown sugar coating the bacon which was so sweet it was like eating spoon fulls of brown sugar right out of the box.  You have to try it to believe it, but i wouldn't waste the money.  Now, their smokehouse sandwitches are good.  So are their club sandwitches.",GcAUfPrz43QCrFDT5STUfA,1,0,1,eK5F9R_gvDMqyiETstJL9Q

Last night i waited over 15 minutes to get one fish sandwich that i ordered. They did offer me a free milkshake while i waited, which i took & drank right there but it was all foamy & almost completely melted. Not enjoyable. Most of the staff looked like it was their first day on the job. What a clusterfu*k of confusion. Absolutely pathetic it was. I will still go to this store, just for the convenience of close proximity to my workplace but seriously Arby's - you need to start hiring  better quality people.",PH2Ly-LUDc5i-eW_97MlNw,1,0,2,xdtniEu4JHyMxsOSthmspw

Recommend to shop for different roll or maybe it's just rotation or over ordering . 
There are many Bakery that will deliver fresh daily like Great Buns ..

1613270,2015-05-28,0,pvLUYFU0zF7ADbK0sPkslg,"Good service and good food. The only thing I find odd about this fast food restaurant is they make you sign the receipt when using a debit card?!?! The receipt even says no signature required. By the way they don't check your ID to match the debit/credit card but make you sign the receipt. This is obviously a clueless manager or owner who thinks signing a ""no signature required receipt"" protects them some way...while not checking ID with the use of credit/debit cards is not protecting them or their customers. Get with the times Arbys on Flamingo.",QhbSR9gcA4wiudFKNDH6ww,1,0,4,rzPKlyQn3tklYvE0TJ5CLQ

Drove 6.8 miles to get an internet promotion, thats open to anyone who walks in 
Deception!
The worst is you get a sandwich not like the promotion picture ; but a salad in a pita with bits of meat 
I showed the girl she went to another person in the back and came sorry gave me another sandwich 
Still little bits of lamb",sEYhtPp7-Dm1b241JigCkA,0,0,1,vd07UAgnoXvyi84o13w9iA
2103918,2015-01-26,0,pvLUYFU0zF7ADbK0sPkslg,"Arby's is a lot different from your traditional fast food restaurant. You won't find any burgers on the menu. What you will find are roast beef sandwiches, potato cakes and apple turnovers. My favorite thing on the menu is the Beef n' Cheddar. It is Arby's roast beef piled on top of a warm onion bun with hot cheese sauce and red ranch, which is kind of like a sweet ketchup. If you have never had one, do yourself a favor and try this sandwich. My last visit, they had 2 french dip sandwiches for $6, so I got that and had one for lunch and took the other home for dinner. 

This location is cute, they have these cute wooden benches as seats at some of the tables. The staff are always friendly and my food comes out quickly. I have yet to receive anything wrong with my orders. You can tell they take the time to check and make sure everything is correct, whether you are dining in or hitting the drive thru.

Well the sandwich I got could be best described as a lettuce sandwich with a hint of bacon. Total rip off for the price - would never order again,sb5_opPGQCQs7h8qzGWFzQ,2,0,1,CLoY2WDjymNLHXm5wQcVYw

2926900,2017-04-09,0,pvLUYFU0zF7ADbK0sPkslg,"Imagine another negative review for this location.

The Curly fries were cold, The diet coke was flat, and the ad I am subjected to 50 times a day was not honored at this location. 

Companies should hire someone to read the reviews and address the issues. Needless to say my poor GF didn't want get forced in to 2 combo meals so she opted to just get an order of fries. Well it was unfair and when I realized the she did not one I threw mine in the trash. I will never know if they are any good because I will not go back. Now we are going to drive over to Gyro Time on Charleston and go where we know we will get what is advertised and at a fair price.",cav24ztwyZ-ddNNWCplIpw,2,0,1,vZ00uH2sWJ6405Gx9h_hvw
3190805,2017-01-24,0,pvLUYFU0zF7ADbK0sPkslg,"My third time ever going to an Arby's , I have to say it wasn't to bad. The food was ok but not bad for a fast food place which is good. The cleanliness wasn't that great but at the time it was raining which could be why. The greasiest thing about it was the customer service which was 100% great. Very friendly people which is super rare for a fast food place but nonetheless it wasn't a bad experience. 

Try the Rueben sand which it's really good.",20A973mMPWOXJYHpcuPXjg,0,1,4,x5kbThXqufI2mnxNk9gHng

The management must not oversee or care. There are not Alot of Arby's so it's a shame I don't have this one to go to. Fail for Arby's everywhere.

She was telling me some guy walked in there earlier and tried to use 8 coupons for himself.  Was he planning on eating 8 roastburgers and 8 soft drinks in one sitting?  Crazy bastard.  

Its just a roast beef sandwich dressed up in burgers clothing.  Ketchup and roast beef don't taste that great together imo.  Bun was good though.
