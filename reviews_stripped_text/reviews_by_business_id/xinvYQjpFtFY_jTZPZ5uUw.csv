I had their combination pho. The broth was okay nothing too great. Everything about the soup was fine except for the onions. They were large chunks of strong onions that entirely ruined the soup. The bowl size wasn't that big either, and overall I paid around $7-8. One thing that I did like was their honey dew slush with boba. I am also aware that this place has various deals however I can't recall all of them (deals such as buy a certain amount of sandwiches and receive one free) It can also apply to drinks and combo meals as well.

I opened up my sandwich. Didn't see a lot of meat filling, mostly the greens & onions. I don't think it is worth the $3.99. At least the small amount of meat in the sandwich was tender. The sauce used to season the meat had a nice sweetness to it. As for the baguette, well, bread is just bread.

Not too happy about the three colored ice dessert. Too much ice! I may be exaggerating, but remove the ice and the drink would only reach about halfway up the cup. Also not worth $3.

My sister and I come here all the time during our break at school. 

I didn't order food this time but my sister gets the same dish aka the chicken red curry. Today, the chicken tasted rubbery and tasted off kinda like plastic, probably because the way it was cooked that day. Who knows....

When she told the worker that it wasn't good/edible he said ""don't worry the chicken is well cooked honey"" first of all, don't call her honey like she's a child. Second, don't try to make excuses when she gets the same meal every time. The guy wouldn't even try it himself....how about you just accept that fact that it's bad?

He then asked if she wanted shrimp instead. She said yes and the dish came shortly after. The women manager or lady in the front came by our table shortly later and stood by our table staring questionably at us. She then proceeded to say ""was that a way of getting more food"" since I was drinking some of the leftover curry broth, and then just walked away. How did we get more food when they took away the initial dish??? I love the attitude and the stinginess of this restaurant!!!

I'm sorry that your chicken tasted weird.. maybe you shouldn't be rude about it and give us attitude. Maybe you should be more understanding. Maybe if you aren't willing to try your own meat to see if it tastes bad then there is a problem... also work on your customer service skills and get the flies out of your restaurant.

I've had a bunch of different flavors of their boba slushes, milk teas, and smoothies and they're not all bad considering the location. I like my boba a little chewier than most so I think it's perfect consistency. If chewy boba isn't your thing, this is your warning. I had a peach slush one time that resembled the flavor of peach Ciroc but other than that, I really enjoy their boba. $3-4 for a cup is right up my alley. I'm really fond of their avocado, thai tea, coconut, taro, and honeydew flavors. 

Food wise I stick to pho and sandwiches. Favorite sandwich is always the brisket one. I don't know what they did with the sauce for their brisket but they did it right and it pairs perfectly with the right amount of pickled vegetables too.

Ambience: this is a storefront small fast food eatery that is very informal and fairly small. I ordered takeout, so it's hard to comment about the cleanliness. However the men's room was surprisingly clean. And the few tables that were empty, were clean.
Service: there was no one in front of me when I placed my order yet it took about 15 minutes to make the dish. Considering that this was not on the menu, I guess that was a fair amount of time. Also, most of the tables were filled so they were cooking for alunch crowd.  However, it really shouldn't take that long to put together a dish like this considering the noodles were probably already prepared and the chicken should have been readily available.

I also got an avocado smoothie boba , they allow you to substitute milk for almond milk or soy milk which I thought was pretty amazing so I got the almond milk with it. The smoothie was bomb.com but the boba was a little weird it felt like I was chewing plastic haha thank god I got light boba.

Unfortunately, I should have followed my elitist instincts and skipped this place. I should note that I've heard good things about the sandwiches and fried rice here, but I don't judge Vietnamese restaurants based on those dishes. I judge on the quality of the pho, and it's lacking here.

When grocery shopping, I used to stock up on packets consisting of a small amount of rice noodles, a bit of oil and flavored powder. Although the noodles were billed as ""Asian,"" they paled in comparison with anything served in a restaurant and served as little more than a small, mildly satisfying snack.

The seafood pho I got at Mr. Sandwich bore a remarkable resemblance to these packaged soups, right down to the noodle texture and bitter undertaste. The seafood didn't impress, nor did the sliced tomatoes (?) included in the broth. 

The restaurant's atmosphere was similarly underwhelming. On a hot summer day, one of the doors was wide-open, leaving the seating area uncomfortably warm. No bean sprouts or sliced jalapenos were served with my soup; I had to ask for them. The non-bottled water tasted bad -- a not-uncommon problem at desert eateries. And the food didn't arrive quickly. 

This place might be a great experience if you're looking for banh mi and bottled water on a late-fall day. But I advise against replicating my poor experience.",hm6Iy0z325GZqQ09ozZgLw,3,0,2,_cvHSJBD6VjFZO9Ayordfw

WOW. I will link the SNHD review with Mr. Sandwich below but here are the bigger cliff points of interest:

1. They have had a rocky inconsistent review rating since 2014. 
2. They have been closed down by the SNHD TWICE.
3. They have had MAJOR roach infestation issues on clean dishes, soy sauce dishes, storage containers. 
4. Not washing hands.
5. Not handling raw food correctly or storing them correctly.

My wife and I came here for a quick lunch. We always pass by this place as its on the way to Seafood City where we grocery shop. My wife said her soup was bland and not worth the price. My curry lamb was good but you pretty much get meat, broth, and bread for 10 bucks. I was expecting at least some vegetables. I admit though that the curry broth was pretty good and so was the bread. The bread was very airy and light and perfect for using a sponge to soak up the broth. I would have rated this place 2 stars if not for the fact that they serve a lot of drinks (i.e. smoothies, lattes, slush, etc.). This is probably the first place I've been to in the U.S. that sold a durian drink so I had to try. They say that durian smells like old mushy onions in custard form. And boy, were they right!

As I held back tears because seriously WTF, I took my plate up to the cashier who said ""Ew sorry let me give you your money back"". Thanks. Perfect way to handle this situation. Who knows how many roaches are being cooked into the food. Boyfriend ended up getting his money back too because no way in hell is he going to take another bite knowing the food is prepared in those nasty conditions. 

Word of advice to students or any other customers eating there. DON'T! 
If there was a ROACH in my food then there is a good chance there could be one in yours too.",NZ5N7rB_Bpof3SPNlMylGw,5,0,1,J-2JWzLbR5a3PlcYvGVZKg

I hadn't had a Vietnamese sandwich in a long time, and was excited about the fact they had a tofu sandwich. I got a sandwich, fries, and a mango boba. It was a tad slow, but mainly because they got super busy after I ordered. Food was great, everything came to about $10, and I got a ton of fries. Only downsides were: My food didn't all come out at the same time, the fries took a while, so my sandwich was already done by the time the fries came (I really tried to wait). Only other downside is if they're going to have a vegan menu, it would be cool to have soy milk or almond milk for the boba teas (I had it anyways, and it was good, but I prefer not to consume dairy if an alternative is available). I definitely want to come back for some vegan pho, as a lot of places that serve pho typically use meat based broth.",SEzZkjAKSRcJGJ48cUwFig,1,1,4,192ge6I1rqdHcxIjzRWJ0A

Downfall is that their broth for the pho isnt so much to my liking, I feel like there is something missing. I keep comparing it to the taste of pho kim long,pho so 1 and pho Saigon 8. These are 3 different pho restaurants that I usually go depending on where im the closets. Although it is personal preference, if youre one of the people who goes to restaurants I mentioned, just dont expect so much from here.

Their service is very personable and I like it. The guy who took my order was very cheerful and it definitely sets a good mood since Im really hungry!

Honestly, I usually hate people that write shitty reviews on Yelp. This is my first (and I don't know if it counts because I'm still giving this place four stars).  I think it's a huge waste of time to talk about a terrible customer service experience because...well who really cares? But, I had a pretty awful experience last week so listen to me complain.

The night of February 14th, Valentine's, I wanted to take my date out to eat at this location for the amazing Tofu Curry I was talking about earlier. The door said open until 9PM. A man stood inside behind the counter on his cell phone, the doors were locked, and he refused to acknowledge people were at the door. Now, if this was an employee I would think that he was really ballsy to do what I've wanted to do at all of my food service jobs... lock the door early. Anyways, I just found out that it wasn't an employee. 

It was the owner. I think it's a little cynical to lock the doors early on Valentine's day, but to just stand behind the counter, in plain view of people knocking at the door of your business and not give an explanation? I wouldn't be writing this if he cracked the door open and explained that he wanted to go home early or that it was slow and everything was cleaned up and turned off.... but he just stood in plain view of the door on his cell phone and he didn't turn around and acknowledge the fact  people were outside, standing infront of a sign saying open until 9PM at about 7PM. 

Was he just having an off day? I couldn't tell you, he didn't open his door and acknowledge me or speak to me. He stood on his cell phone, in plain view of door, ignoring people that wanted to have Valentine's day dinner at his restaurant lol",3I2HRfBXoCsEeWigVQuFdQ,1,1,4,d3nt6eohEAZkXHMheir_Yg

But I say that because for one when she takes the orders if you don't know the number but you know what you want she screams ""what number!"" then she rushes you to order if their busy, my order wasn't even done and at one point I had to tell her to not rush me!! Then I asked for extra greens onions twice nobody brought it then once they brought out my egg rolls and i began to eat them the meat had a slight pinkish tint to it, i didn't complain because it was my first time getting egg rolls my second time being here soo i wasn't sure if it was just me or the food, as I was about to leave I needed a to go cup for my drink and they do have a station that has to go cups and to go plates for your food ONLY like I said I needed a Togo cup for my drink and a bigger bag for my leftovers I simply asked the same women for a cup and a bag and she again yelled at me ""it's over there!"" I go look and what I'm looking for is not there soo I asked her again she yells again for a third time ""were very busy! You can get it yourself"" well I obviously couldn't get it myself!!! After waiting around for the next employee or the owner who in a nice way gave me the bag and smiled at me i got my stuff and left.

I completely understand that they were busy and it's a small place but I'm a bartender and your still suppose to provide excellence customer service busy or not I'm a paying customer like everybody else and that was absolutely disgusting for her to treat me like that being that that was my 2nd time coming there and it sucks that the rest of the employees were very nice but because of that one certain employee and her very shitty attitude and lack of customer service is what ruins that place.

I arrived about 5 minutes after placing my order, knowing that I would have to wait for a while, but it took an extra 10-15 minutes for my order of grilled chicken with rice, beef pho, and Thai tea. My only complaint is the wait time. The food itself is SUPERB and the food portions greatly exceeded my expectations. I definitely recommend the grilled chicken with rice (it comes with two huge chicken thighs, cut up veggies, and piles of fresh rice), as well as the beef stew pho (which came with a whopping container of savory broth, a pile of noodles and veggies, and delicious tender beef). The portions are so large that I shared the beef stew pho with my sister and we didn't even finish it. Of course my favorite thing about Mr. Sandwich is their Thai tea, which is authentic, sweet, and perfectly chilled.

I live close to Sam Boyd Stadium and we have no boba place in The Henderson area. With that being said. That's mainly why i continue to come here. The milk teas are good don't get me wrong. The boba though , way overlooked and mushy. Seems to be the story of my life. They have food too but I've yet to try anything other than the milk teas. They have pho for $6 a bowl. Pretty cheap but with Pho Thang Huong across the way I doubt I will try the pho  or order from the food menu. Maybe I'll try a Bahn minor something someday but today we will just talk milk tea. 

Here's the deal. I've become obsessed with milk tea. I just love it ! Refreshing and sweet. I just can't do without the boba and I crave milk tea all the time so when I'm close I frequent this location. I've had the mango milk tea , jasmine milk tea and Thai milk tea. The jasmine would probably be my favorite of the three. Most of the drinks are made from powder :/ They have different jellies and bobas including green apple boba flavored Jellies and popping bobas. Small is $3 medium is $4 and large is $5. The milk teas aren't bad I just wish the texture was more firm on the boba.

The restaurant is dirty.  I suspect it's because they're usually busy from the student rush and they appear to be severely understaffed.  If you order water, don't expect a refill.  Your food might come before your drinks, and you might need to loot forks and/or napkins from nearby tables.

Additionally, there are a few homeless men who linger around this general area due to the location near the school and on Maryland Pkwy.  When I was there one of these men entered the restaurant through a side door and just sort of wandered around a bit before wandering out another door.

With that being said, after my first stop here, this place has never been a place I've chosen to go to, it's just been more of a place I end up at due to circumstances. It's not bad, but it's not good either. It just sort of exists. The pho is slightly below average; the broth has no flavor and the sandwiches are about average. You'll eat the meal, but nothing has ever stood out and made me want to return here. The staff has never been good or bad. They've never wowed me, but never been rude or unpleasant. If you're at UNLV and you absolutely have to have pho or banh then they'll do, but there's entirely too many alternatives without even leaving the parking lot",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,1,2,2,b5cThYm1ax5ZTmQ9ptKdrw

I actually liked it, to be honest. They make my orders quick and they seem nice too. Better than I expected hehe",9qa58_rp6DOcrSaBRx3RaQ,0,0,5,d9npGKjUV-1_tIVrIanW7Q

Don't get fooled by the name, they sell way more than just sandwiches here. I've only had two of their sandwiches which is the charbroiled beef and the pork. The sandwiches are really good for less than $5! Beats Subway mostly cause a 6 inch is not enough and a 12 inch is too much and they no longer have the $5 foot longs. Anyways, I love the bread they use because it's crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. I've also had their pho and other dishes, and so far I have yet to have a bad experience. 

As far as he service goes, it's hit or miss. When the boss is there, the service is great! He's kind and will take care of you right away. Last time I was here, I literally waited for over 10 minutes at the counter to order whilst the two workers fail to acknowledge me. It was only when I left the counter to complain to my friend about leaving, when one of the guys finally take my order.

I'll be back again. Hopefully I have a better service experience next time.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,4,3,3,Eri-Fr_qXPa5erBwzapL9w
5959448,2013-12-04,4,xinvYQjpFtFY_jTZPZ5uUw,"Crumbs everywhere! That's the story of my lunch. I was craving banh mi and since I'm a big fan of the Mr Sandwich on Spring mountain I was happy to have a location open up on the East side. Came here around lunch time and they were pretty busy. Mostly people ordering pho on this cold day, but I was in a rush and just ordered the charbroiled pork banh mi and a taro milk tea with boba. 

The sandwich was just ok. The bread was way too crumbly and made a mess every time I took a bite, which was annoying. Tasted slightly stale as well, which was disappointing. The meat and veggies were ok. Wish they were a little more pickled to add more flavor, but still ok. 

The milk tea was good and basic. Would have been a little better if they added more ice, but I enjoyed it.

Overall, I don't see myself going out of my way to come here, but it's a good addition to the area.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,7,3,FZeVu2lnzp8hk8Lvwjm9hw
