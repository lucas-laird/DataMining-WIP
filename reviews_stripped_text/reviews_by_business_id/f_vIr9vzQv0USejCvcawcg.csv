Beyond that, nothing too special, but definitely get bang for your buck and fulfills that Chinese food craving.  They do give you free eggrolls and stuff if you order over $15 of food, though I think that's pretty typical.",LR9E4bHOHnYnjLnUGYOV8A,4,0,3,TC4j5SyFHXZkjI6zxoUnvQ

It was conveniently located near us so we had some food delivered.   It was just awful.   Probably the worst Chinese food I have ever had, and I've had a lot.

I'm getting bad memories while writing this.",UQm8Cib9mvQpxHE07sAhFA,1,0,1,hVwQnKuBKUlkqt2KbIg80Q

Not only did the lady behind the counter try to get into a conversation with me about the US Economy as she had with the previous customer... the food was rather awful the past two times I went. The first bad experience I brushed it off because the place was usually steadily decent for the price. The second time I gave up as my meal completely lacked flavor of any sort and got me sick (I think the food may not have been completely cooked). 

I will never go to this establishment again. Off to find a new Chinese hole in the wall...",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,3,1,1,ErvJMPxmbX7ZeFV3giHhEw
