900142,2012-07-05,0,JTknlKD6bviJZLngdpbydw,Awesome chicken amongst the best.  Nachos could have more chicken and condoments. Monster fries also great but the original chicken is hands down the winner!!!!,YKBtPh1MBjjG1uYIPVYN1A,0,0,3,Fdzmo6tDJ_nDtOOy8K8htg

3311991,2011-01-11,0,JTknlKD6bviJZLngdpbydw,chicken was great! a little pricy for a combo with fries coleslaw and drink but you get really good food for the money. the chicken tasted fresh and was perfectly fried. it also tasted very healthy. it wasnt dripping in oil. will go back just for some strips next time im in vegas.,1noEnpLlagabkc7TXKXBBQ,0,0,4,bWnG8Uk72eRK2PGv3enskA
4297139,2013-07-09,0,JTknlKD6bviJZLngdpbydw,"Honestly, I don't know what everyone is complaining about. I eat here almost every time I come to Meadows Mall and I love it. My food is never stale or bad, it they typically give me more than they are suppose to...even the first time I ate here they did. 

The only problem I can think of is some of the younger kids that work here. They don't pay attention and are a little rude....Kool-aid is super sweet sometimes too. Otherwise, I've never had problems and neither have all the friends I recommend this place to.",3pg7K9tKaS4kfBnybh0pVA,0,0,4,cz2Jrr8sLWw5OegzlqWEiw
4387771,2012-07-19,1,JTknlKD6bviJZLngdpbydw,"Let me start off by saying they deserve no stars at all!!! 

Boyfriend and I waited a few minutes for anyone to even take our order. 

I ordered the grilled chicken quesadilla a la carte for $5.44 and an order of monster fries to share for $3.99. Boyfriend ordered the 5 piece buffalo tenders a la carte as well for $6.44. 

My quesadilla was a single soft taco sized tortilla folded in half. Could not even see the cheese from the side. Came with some lettuce and chopped tomatoes with about 6 stale tortilla chips and a blob of sour cream. Chicken was very blah.

Monster fries looked like French fries that had previously been fried then refried to our order. (working in the food industry I am very aware many places will blanch the fries but this was not the case) crunchy oil soaked fries topped in what I believe was chili, 3 jalape√±o slices, about 5 pieces of diced tomato butts and some cheese. Oh almost forgot about the almost non existent bacon bits. 

My boyfriends chicken was drenched in the buffalo sauce and just wasn't very appetizing. He came home and was sick for an hour! 

This was the worst $20 I have ever spent on food!!! We will never be eating here again.",y1hBRVR8kVx6htQsAa1mYA,0,0,1,k5f7mohNJoT69PUXrNPrKA
4491301,2011-12-03,0,JTknlKD6bviJZLngdpbydw,I found myself at Meadows mall shopping early for Christmas gifts. Shopping can sure work up an appetite! I personally love Great Steak because I love their Philly Cheese sandwiches! My husband doesn't so we had to compromise. We decided to go to Chicken Now to get basic chicken tenders. I found out  later it's cheaper just to get a meal. The sauce that they serve with the chicken tastes really similar to Canes except Chicken Now's sauce is a bit on the salty side. The menu is a little more extensive then Canes they have things like chili cheese fries if you like that kind of stuff. They also serve the Texas toast with their meals like Canes.,48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,1,0,3,kC8KWeNfd6P-d_2xQuQlqA
5811632,2015-11-17,1,JTknlKD6bviJZLngdpbydw,"I could not believe this location was closed. They seemed to have really good food.
We were walking the mall and wanted something different.

We ordered a Chicken Bowl.
It was really pretty good!
It was fresh tasting and it was good. 
We both commented on how it was better than most food court food. There is just so much Chinese food and pizza you want to eat so it was nice having a place like this. We had never heard of before.
I did notice there was a couple of other locations. If I see this place again it is a place I would get something at again that's how good the bowl was.",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,2,2,4,IkNQiLlhU93a8sBS8UkCmw

Portions were generous and we enjoyed them very much.  Recommend this place highly.  Will return if in the area again.",Ryr40H9FPLejph748_1fvw,0,0,5,2Wr1PxNKldBTAdjy6CenOw
