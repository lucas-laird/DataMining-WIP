Ever since that first time, I have been a repeat customer of this meat booth. I have never tasted lamb like that before. That is what I purchased the first time.  I felt adventurous on my next visit and bought beefalo: yes, its part cow and part bison, a real USDA grass-fed animal raised on a farm, as quoted to me by one of the partners. Ive never seen beefalo anywhere else. Their meat is awesome. I hope they stay around and do other markets so my friends that live around other parts of town can get some.",vTrkB-LVxFKrxrJBEsGZKg,0,0,5,h-rZQryfzOU8Xd5EDocqLA

I just stir fried it with some onions, garlic, and tomato paste and I was told it was the best food I ever made!!! (Shocking, bc I cook a lot of different tasty and way more complicated recipes). Although it's not certified organic they had a big sign that said no hormones, and grassfed. The guy (I'm assuming was one of the owners) told me they're gonna open a permanent shop somewhere soon. I will buy from them again.",dPG1cOGb7ZnyaUl8M7h4bQ,0,0,5,nxjTe1ihFScooip-HjeGcw
