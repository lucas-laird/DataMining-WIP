Place also has a refrigerated section and small groceries area.  If I knew this food well, I'd probably shop here.  Would rather leave the cooking to the experts though.  

By the way, in their shared parking lot there's an outdoor mini putting golf course.  Most likely not theirs, but how cute is that?!

Ron's is 100% legit. 

Last night we ordered their chicken lula (ground chicken kabobs), beef lula, steak, chicken, some hummus, french fries, rice, dolmas (grape leaves), and lebneh. 

Not only did everything arrive on-time and hot-- it was insanely tasty!!! The chicken lula kabobs have almost a sweet glaze flavor on them that is incredible-- the chicken, all white meat and not chewy, just moist and perfect. The beef, incredible. Dolmas were also wonderful ~ give me some tasty grape leaves dipped in hummus and I'm in hog heaven.

My favorite is their sauce (the equivalent of food-crack)... I'm not 100% sure exactly what it is, but it tastes like a sweet red pepper type of sauce... it's sweet and savory. I'd legit buy a jar of it and put it on sandwiches, rice, anything; it's that good.

They have hands down the best Kebab in Las Vegas! I'm Persian and I know that the owners I believe are Armenian, but their food tops any other middle eastern place that offers kebab and I've ordered from before. Their food always has that scent that you smell from a mile away. Their kebab is ALWAYS juicy, a big portion and always flavorful. U fortunately most Mediterranean or middle eastern places I've ordered from here in Vegas, are over priced and when your order gets there, the kebab is dry, no flavor and the meat doesn't taste or smell fresh. Also it just tastes so bland just like a piece of ground beef or chicken with no seasoning. However this place OMG for under $10 you get a huge portion, the rice is flaky and tasteful and the meat you can still taste the fire in it and the middle easter seasonings they were marinated in... the owners are the nicest people, their mom and pop shop is also a great place to get your fix for some European import groceries, chocolates etc ... I absolutely love this place!!!!! If I could give it ten stars I would",yiK-wKE_fnhrNz9MO-Clzw,0,0,5,KKOYn3Oiu_ZH3LMmkzBHWQ

The butcher is super friendly. He recommended some meats, let me try a few samples of the deli choices, and had fresh kabob meat ready to take home. Seasoned meats and a huge selection of European treats. 

The current menu is amazing but I just heard about their new menu to come!! I'll I can say is HEALTHY OPTIONS!!! 

I tried the kabob meal. Simple and delicious. Good size portions. I'll look forward to the new menu.

ONE LAST THING, Rumor has they have a FREE 5GALLON water machine BEING INSTALLED THIS MONTH!!!!!

The pita chips were a big hit with hummus - totally addicting. The piping hot pita bread was also great. Not much ambience with the market right next to the seating, and it would be nice to have ice available for the drinks. Other than that, a fine place for a quick, cheap and high quality meal.",PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A,0,0,4,HK25_r2XETwxiN3L1es18g

Firstly, there are no pictures to share because when our appetizing Mediterranean fare was delivered we demolished it upon arrival. We ordered a steak kabob, lula kabob, fries  and hummus. Entrees came with savory grilled tomatoes and pita. Furthermore, the value for our gourmet cuisines was excellent. One of the best Mediterranean meals we have had all in the comfort of our home. We look forward to dining in one day. If you are craving a delicious take out meal order from here, Ron will not disappoint!",vSnYdIYsF6SJ7mHS9ESSjQ,0,0,5,2Ni3dbau5rmn6M3Eg18ahg

Its a cute little grocery store, so I decided to walk around. Then my stomach started to grumble....hangry (hungry/angry) time. I looked at my watch and my receipt, it was 25 mins since I ordered. The kabob was ok, but I'm knocking off stars because of the wait time. The bread was really good. But if you don't have 30 mins to kill and want just as good food, then walk across the street to Stephanos....Nicer vibe/ambiance and they'll bring the food out faster to you. The price range is similar.",R9aBuKDLUfxvJsJI9yyo9w,1,0,3,jmckCHECdyXneie1tuDFjA

I'll give them 2 stars for price and speed of delivery. The meat tasted like they cooked it the night before and microwaved it before bringing it to my house. Had that microwaved meat taste. The rice was unbelievably bland and so was the meat. The pita bread tasted and was as hard as a piece of cardboard. Just not good at all. I'm so disappointed :(",v3in4pF9w0wxtPNF09za5Q,0,1,2,1WQyMtsPEGhIyk-G-M8QUg

But I was pleasantly surprised and very happy I tried it anyway! Great gyro over filled with meat great sauce the garlic hummus is fabulous! The amount for the price was a great buy and I'm very happy! The delivery was faster then quoted to me!,7Qn4SDuGp7VP8bh_iG3Ckg,2,1,5,ksQGegX0X_tg25qXdarsnw
