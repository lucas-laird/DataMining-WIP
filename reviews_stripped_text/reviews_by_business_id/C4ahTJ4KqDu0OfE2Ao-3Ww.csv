Inside, they play nice music (Euro-pop?), not too loud. The food is excellent! It's almost all fresh-made from fresh (not frozen) food bought daily, according to the assistant manager, Josh. I would call this place fast-casual. You order at the counter, but they bring your food out to you on disposable dishes. The kabobs I ordered were delicious and the hummus was also! The pitas were the best I've ever tasted in a reasonably priced restaurant. Decor was decent, and the service was very good for a cafe of this type. I will definitely be back, and will recommend Cous Cous to anyone I know who likes Greek food and will be in downtown LV.",zXbWlmnJ3htn65aKppKIWA,0,0,4,MEZtTsX_bvM4X8ecEOrWtg

The falafel pita pocket was around 95 percent damp, frigid, flavorless salad with a couple of ancient falafels hiding at the bottom. The fat young woman who took our order and later delivered our meals couldn't have been more charmless on a bet. Avoid!",UfDqJLjNNzLQeKvmYq5PiQ,0,0,1,6ALU81UKJz9SIsZr8Wl2CA

2402658,2017-09-18,1,C4ahTJ4KqDu0OfE2Ao-3Ww,"The only thing worse than the cold, stale gyro I ordered, was the even colder uninterested service recieved. The taziki was congealed. The meat was crusted and cold.

I get that sometimes food prep is less than desirable in a tourist spot like this, but to get horrible food AND have the staff not look you in the eye and show any form of common courtesy, is unacceptable.

I wish we had walked just a little bit further down Freemont St., to one of the many ""off the Freemont Experience"" places for good food and friendly service. 

A mistake that will not be repeated.

And don't even get me started on how much my wife despises this place. Her experience was even worse.",PlkylgiPVmPHVcHydmK1eg,2,0,1,BhiG0-3iGJ9CqkgInaRzqw

We even knocked on the glass door to get the cashiers attention but he wouldn't even acknowledge us. How rude and unprofessional.,nDEUdSzCtrzxr6YoqY7IIQ,0,1,1,3OmGvLLyvFO6qj_RJhrA3w

When she got back to register I said excuse me we were here prior to the people that were there and she began to tell me that she only serviced people by the register. Even though I told her I was there before and that I only sat because I had a broken toe.  I told her she was being rude because she started taking someone else's order.  She even went as far as telling me she was the owner when I told her I would report her.  She was rude, unprofessional and disrespectful.",vWpGXMIP86B1dGyBSTzHrQ,0,0,1,A1uCWSN8RuBIQFVewCw5eQ

I went in stood look at the menu for about 5 mins figured out what I wanted then went to the counter to order my food but I had to use the restroom. I ask the lady at the counter may I have the code so I could use the restroom, she was so rude to me. She literally said no it's for customers only, which I understand that part but It's the way she said it to me and she also didn't even ask me whether I planned on dining with them or not. I politely let her know I've been standing in your establishment for 5 mins looking at the menu &d it wasn't for my health. Finally get the code use the restroom and order the chicken Greek salad, which was the worst Greek salad I ever had in my life. First thing is they give u 4 small pieces of chicken for 3.50 extra and they were dry, there was barely any cheese, barely any tomatoes but a ton of olives and onions on the salad. U could tell the person that was making it didn't really care about the food. Tried to sit down in the restaurant but all the tables were dirty &d I didnt really want to bother the lady at the counter again so I just left and eat the salad somewhere else.",CSTck9Q_Pk87pkfkC4p7UQ,2,0,1,KsnTmHcd31NzLWw53YxCCg

We came in here 2 weeks ago , 4 of us ordered appetizers and Kabobs with rice.
Food was ok but too much salad  in our Sandwiches , its a sign that they are cheep .
I don't think they use the right Mediterranean spicing in the food  , its a place that will do well if the improve on the above items I just noted .",Ni37YcpXU8R1dM4_qLz1Nw,12,10,3,rzEKDUI92G4rCEMxVLwpcw

Not sure what kind of cheese but it was not cheese curd. The  brown gravy was not correct for poutine. Probably from a can. The chicken shawarma was chopped chicken,.
