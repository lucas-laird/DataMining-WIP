When I went, the owner was there to greet us and I wasn't sure that I could handle 6-12 donuts...but, these donuts are not overly sweet to where you feel sick if you give in to your donut cravings. I had the Whippi Goldberg, Heaven Bacon, M&Ms, Taylor Crunch one, peanut butter, Oreo, etc... all were equally good. 
So yes it's more like a yeast-cake donut which my refined palate prefers. They even stayed fresh for a few days in my house with no problem!

At Crunch Donut none of them looked appetizing I think it was the lack of lighting in that place so I just decided on the glazed. If the glazed isn't good then typically the others will be just the same or worse. Well for $1 each it tasted about the same as a grocery store donut, but I'd be paying half as much at my local grocer. A $1 donut is relatively expensive for the quality you receive.

In my personal opinion, this place couldn't keep up. We would go when the place was still fresh and new and the quality of their donuts were amazing. As soon as they gained more popularity it's like the quality of the donuts was replaced with quantity. I can understand high demand, but the donuts were just stale, the cream cheese and the caramel they used tasted like they were a bit sour. I just really hope they find a way to change the quality so I can give a more positive and updated review.



This place is hands down amazing. 24 hrs and the owner and the people who help manage it are wonderful people and very nice. Very nice and delicious selections of specialty donuts and kronuts.

My first order (about 6 specialties, bout 3 yeast specialties 3 cake specialties) I made was during a holiday, New Years Eve or New Years day, fairly late and I was definitely impressed the first time but only by the yeast donuts really and not so much the cake donuts (fairly dry). So I don't know if it was because it was a holiday and so late I got a stale batch of the cake donuts or something. Eh, still pretty good. The Samoas Hyack I was looking forward to, being a fan of the cookie. It just didn't hit the mark. Cake donut itself was kinda dry like the others, but the toppings itself just didn't smack me in the face like the cookie and it was really the most disappointing out of my order.

I mentioned this to who, I imagine, is the owner tonight and he decided to throw in a Samoas one for free as it is his favorite and was perplexed that I didn't like it. Case closed, this time around it was AWESOME. Took a bite and knew I had to throw up this review asap. I've yet to try the other 6 donuts out, but I'm sure I will enjoy them. 

Ultimately, I think the only thing that might hurt this place is the prices BUT being that these are specialty donuts (they have some regular kind too) that's open 24/7, that could be it's saving grace. Plus, out of all the specialty donut places (Pink Box & Donut Bar), this one seems to hit it's mark a lot better. It's not AS expensive either I believe (i.e. someone stating almost $7 for 2 donuts...) I believe their specialties are $1.99-2.50 range and you can get half a dozen specialties for about $10.99 or a dozen for $20. Not too bad. Their donuts are pretty big. Apple fritters were probably the largest I've seen and they were $1.99. 

Either way I was pleased the first time with some disappointment, but this 2nd visit definitely swayed me to return a couple more times...",ndhakszVplkDWU-2ApTfRw,1,0,4,NvMQ598Gk6Mb55C-GLQ2vA

I went with the waffle with a banana split on top, basically. I forget the creative name they have for it but they have catchy names for everything on the menu. Really entertaining to read them all. 

The waffle was good, but not great. A little over cooked even. However it was made to order so nice and fresh. 

The place is nice and clean and has a cool theme inside. The service was very good. One young lady working and she was very friendly and welcoming and made the experience even better. 

Reasonably priced, and a good location (for me anyways since I work in the area.)

2290977,2016-12-01,2,2rvBPUBtQU0WfcOAHLQWRQ,"Having personally learned how to make donuts from scratch, my review may be a little more critical than others so I'll try to stick to the other things first.

Strange smell upon arriving inside. 
Not only was the girl sick while handling the food AND money by herself but she seemed to kind of be rushing me while being extra friendly to others. Two guys in front of me and she was chatting it up with them. With me, it felt like I was annoying her by asking what is popular to try. Then, at the register, as I'm paying, a customer wanted more coffee and was all up in my face trying to push his way in. ALSO, another customer that was just coming in ( who it sounded like she knew ), her attention was on him before I was even done. Tables were dirty. 

Ok, so onto the actual product, the donuts. I'm not so sure I like the idea of being able to create your own. I learned how to make donuts from scratch and I found that the toppings need to be applied while still warm. The donuts for create yourself are in room temp storage so I'm curious as to how those actually are. But, tasting the donut, I realized why...they use a different type of flour that is more of a cake type batter so it can sustain the sitting. Furthermore, the toppings are also more of a cake icing ganache based topping. 

This place should be called CAKES....not donuts. So, in that sense, they aren't bad cakes but they certainly aren't traditional type donuts. They are just shaped like donuts. Donuts are fluffy and moist. These are full bodied and more towards the dry side which is why the icing is important. 

This is why I give 3 stars. If there was another helper and the service was better, I might give a better rating. But, with donuts a block away that are real donuts and less than a dollar for one, it's gonna be hard to compete. Also, 7/11 next door with dollar donuts ( given again that these are more cakes ), I will be curious to see how this place does in the coming year.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,1,0,3,UDCBiQAB1hIMVzmJtD0wDw

First of all idiots, the Katy Cherry has no cream cheese inside her as its just on top of a plain yeast donut!  That's it idiots!  What a crappy donut!  No surprise in the middle as I wanted to eat her out deep from the inside expecting all that gooey cream cheese.  This donut is nothing more than a plain yeast donut serving as a carrying vehicle for very plain topping.  

Next, I had high hopes for Angelina Cherry but was also let down.  Very little peanut butter taste to the frosting which made it taste more like a cupcake rather than a topping for a donut.  Inside her was bright red artificial cherry filing so I ate out Angelina from the inside unlike the dry Katy.  This was a big donut in size but just plain.  I was tempted to try the Brad Fritter but it kind of looked like what my cat throws up.  Maybe next time I will make a trip to choked down Brad.

I passed on the tiny $1 donuts as they were just too small to waste the calories.  Seriously I laughed so hard at the size of those little suckers!

The guy behind the counter was nice and told me they charge an extra $0.35 for credit cards which none of you morons posted.

I customized my waffle with just vanilla ice-cream and Nutella drizzle. We tried another dessert place before coming to this one, and I needed something that wasn't too much over the top! Hahaa

My sister got the Bananarama Split and my brother ordered the Pecan & Nutella waffle. All were pretty good and we had no major complaints. Although, my sis did complain to me that her waffle was overcooked and a lil hard.

Almost all their menu items are named after famous celebrities. However, they have a lil twist on them. I think you know who Leonardo DiOreo, S'Morgan Freeman, and Dough Wayne Johnson are. LOL I thought that was pretty clever.

We were all just too full to try any donuts or take some home, but it gives us more reason to come back.

We ordered on uber eats...

We were excited this place was open late and we were looking for a midnight desert, they had some delicious looking waffles....

Bananarama Split was supposed to come with ice cream and it did not. My wife ordered the Heaven Spacey. Neither was good. 

They both were supposed to have fresh strawberries, they seemed like the canned strawberry syrup with chunks of strawberries. 

My kids wouldn't even eat them. 

Anyways, we are quite annoyed. But we ordered 4 donuts for the morning, I know they won't be as fresh, but they have to be better than these failed waffle deserts!

Unless these donuts impress us in a big way, I will never order from here again, open 24 hours or not....

Update:

Moved it up a few stars. The donuts were delicious. I mean very good. I had a Samoas Hyack, caramel icing with a crunchy coconut with chocolate drizzled. I didn't taste the donuts the rest of the family had, but they also like theirs. 

I will probably go back for donuts, and it is possible our waffles were just made by the ""B"" crew, not sure. But I will never order a waffle from them again.

UPDATE 2: Back to 1 star due to employee incompetence. 


We had a guy from their business respond saying sorry and offering free food.  However we didn't take him up on it because I wanted to do so in person. 

We ordered UberEATS again, but just ordered their delicious donuts. The delivery was here super fast. Thanks uber!

We ordered their dozen donuts. And we ordered 2 extra bacon maple bars. The receipt was correct. We paid for everything. 

In our dozen, 2 Angelia Jelly were supposed to be included, but somehow got left out. 

The guy who responded to my original review, admitted my waffles were made by the ""B"" crew in the middle of the night, guess the daytime weekend crew must also be a ""B"" crew?

2 out of 2 times they botched our order and didn't give us what we bought. And one time they gave us horrible inedible food. 

So... I no longer have interest in the free food they offered as I don't care to have another order messed up, I can get my order correct elsewhere for half the price.",S1-mvFcylZc8OmOb8zOtxw,2,0,1,WoVykvIfvnG9oyBystxhOA

4007004,2017-02-25,1,2rvBPUBtQU0WfcOAHLQWRQ,"I'm born and raised in Vegas and when I was a kid there was a place around the Lakes called Lamars, they had these amazing cake donuts topped with mini m&ms but they were ahead of their time with the crazy donut fad so they closed years ago. I was so excited to see another place doing these types of donuts so I was eager to try this place. 

I'm giving this place 2 stars because it's 24/7 and my husband liked their soft serve, but that's the extent of the positives. We get there and I get it was late because this was about 130 am, we'd just left a friends birthday and we have a friend staying with us so we figured it'd be nice to get some donuts. We get there and it was us and another couple and the girl says ""I'll be with you in just a minute."" I've worked retail, I'm very patient, so I say ""no problem."" I understand she's by herself so I wait. She's gone for 5+ minutes and the other couple starts whispering wondering why it's taking so long and I'm wondering the same. She finally re-emerges and doesn't seem thrilled to be at work and she seems like she may have a cold. I request a few donuts as the case is missing several of the flavors, it's the middle of the night, I get it, but the few other 24/7 shops make the donuts fresh every few hours. She starts packing my donuts into a plastic container, I've never seen this at a donut shop and I try to use as little plastic as possible, so it was a weird to see. She then crammed all my donuts into one container which smushed my donuts into each other and got icing from some of them onto the others, so that was annoying. 

The donuts were a complete let down, they tasted like gas station donuts and were not worth the price tag. 5 donuts and soft serve for about $16. Cake donuts should have a firm and somewhat crisp exterior with a cake center, these were insanely soft throughout but not in a good way. They tasted like the box donuts you get at the store that are basically just sugar and preservatives. I've never had a more disappointing donut in my life. Also, the Eminem donuts are advertised as being covered on top, when in reality it's a slight sprinkle of m&ms. 

Honestly, I just think this place is trying to do too many things. They do specialty waffles, make the fad cereal and bacon donuts, and also do soft serve with a toppings bar. Pick one thing and be good at it, don't go so overboard. They're trying so hard to be Voodoo donuts on steroids and it's a cheap imitation. I really don't understand the positive reviews, maybe some of them are from closer to when they opened. I definitely won't be back unless they changed their cake donut recipe, made the Eminem donuts as advertised, and used boxes like every other donut shop and not plastic.",4M25m7sE45Q_hNOch4b8fA,0,0,2,9QLbzVH9wmX3_Rs5HbvuQA

With some spare time on my hands and being on an empty stomach, I thought it logical that a donut from Crunch Donut Factory was in order. Located next to Roberto's on Maryland Pkwy. just across UNLV, Crunch Donuts is offering up a gourmet selection of creative donuts. Each donut has a cute name. For instance, I got the ""Whippy Goldberg"". I think all donuts are named after celebrities, with most ranging from $2-4. 

WHIPPY GOLDBERG ($2.49): A double chocolate donut with chocolate frosting and a huge dollop of whipped cream on top. The chocolate donut and frosting were great, but I wasn't too keen on the whipped cream. It was thick and super sugary. I guess I like more airy, lighter whipped cream. 4/5

The shop is super cute and modern. I definitely want to come back to try an apple fritter or two.

Recently opened in the same shopping plaza as Al's Donuts, a location directly across Maryland Parkway from the UNLV Student Union seemingly the perfect spot for 24/7 fried treats, Crunch Donut Factory brings its concept west from Arlington Texas and with clever celebrity names for each of their concoctions the results are mostly impressive.

Not exactly as 'artisan' as Donut Bar pretends, yet not as slipshod as a place like Voodoo Doughnuts in Portland, Crunch Donut Factory on Harmon Avenue splits the difference between tradition and modernity with a bevy of Cake, Yeast and Filled choices topped with simple glaze or many preconceived combinations, an added bonus offered by way of building one's own at the Crunch Creation Station.

Decorated in pink and white stripes with green detailing, each booth bearing a logo with a bizarre Donut man smiling for selfies in back, service at Crunch just prior to 6:30am on Saturday came by way of a chipper youngster, gleefully shouting greetings about Crunch Time to each patron who enters.

Perusing the glass case, Donuts fried throughout the day to replenish supply as needed, most options range anywhere from $2-$3, a cheaper-by-the-dozen-or-half deal yielding six carefully boxed rings plus a Fritter for a pre-tax cost of just thirteen dollars.

Chuckling at the seemingly nonsensical references involved in some of the choices, though Betty White makes perfect sense in the setting of a soft and rich Old Fashioned while the knockoff of Voodoo's ""Blazer Blunt"" based on Snoop Dogg proved superior to the original despite Vanilla Cream only filling a quarter of it, ""David Doughy"" was lost on me both in terms of taste as well as title as the 'yeasted' base was far too dense, particularly with the glob of unsweetened Cream Cheese filling.

Pun-infesting an Apple-heavy Fritter that could have stood to be crispier with Meet Joe Black as a whole lot of sour Citrus filled a fluffy pocket topped with Lemon frosting for Mrs. Jay-Z the best bites from Crunch Donut Factory came by way of their Cocoa-heavy Cake choices, the Marilyn Mondough accenting moist Red Velvet with Strawberry Cream while Matt Frank Dough was intense and indulgent with Darker Chocolate first shellacked in Chocolate Icing and then slathered in German Chocolate Frosting.

**** Anticipating this opening for some time, the signage replacing a Shave Ice spot several months ago, Crunch Donut Factory brings good Donuts to a neighborhood in desperate need of them, a strong competitor to Donut Mania or Pink Box with the ability to customize to ones liking presenting something entirely new to the Las Vegas area.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,7,4,HaGaf1FcRV5RrGL8e1DxYQ

I did experience a bit of sticker shock when I spent close to $7 for only two donuts. Granted, the names of the donuts are so creative because most (if not all) are named after celebrities. Still, I should not have to pay Hollywood prices for average tasting donuts.",_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w,2,2,3,W5NZqtmwege_GNkxC97dPg

In reality, this donut shop is nothing to go out of your way for.  Mediocre donuts in a mediocre shop in a kinda sketchy part of town.  Another donut shop (Al's Donuts)  is practically next door but I hear it's even worse. 

My suggestion: Skip this one. There are plenty of donuts in this city and there's no need to stop at this one (especially at night) hiding not-so-special donuts behind celebrity puns near the strip.",UZAwgKcQaPgYIoS75qO0Xg,1,0,3,l2ab_UQtHkcptQ_qTp7OTw
5309623,2017-08-06,0,2rvBPUBtQU0WfcOAHLQWRQ,"o just say.....I should have listened to all the bad reviews. 

1) it said they are open 24/7 but upon string at 5:45pm there was a sign that they were closed until 6pm 

2) the gentleman who I later found out was the owner unlocked the door and didn't invite us in as he saw me with me two kids 

3) walked in and he was busy on his laptop to even acknowledge us

4) majority of what's on their menu was not available. I understand they said they don't have all bc each day bakers but majority unavailable is a little weird especially for a donut shop that's supposedly open 24/7

I ordered 2 dozens. 1 dozen of just the original glazed known as ""Justin Timberglazed"" and the other dozen with 3 each of Blue Carrey, Choc Carter, Halle Strawberry and Buttermilk Bars. I also ordered 1 Russel l Kronut which is the maple syrup and bacon style. 

I was really excited to each my kronut. I love kronuts and I love the maple syrup bacon flavors! First bite, DISGUSTING! Kronut was stale and doughy and the bacon was thick and  chewy. I'm sorry Kronuts are suppose to be fluffy and crispy. Bacon is suppose to be crispy!


I also tried the Blue Carrey and it was ok. I just took one bite though. Blueberry flavor was there but again doughy.

I don't recommend this place and indefinitely wouldn't be back. Like I said I should have listened to the reviews but I was asked to pick up donuts and unfortunately this was the only one in the area that was ""open"" at that time.",kgGYqH5_wCWr3EK1rxllGw,1,1,1,pjesZCRL_e2XiiQZhtZQUg

The names of the donuts we so cute and they looked good in the case even though the selection was very very poor. We settled on the 4 out of 6 choices and shared. We ended up have a bite each of the 4 and that was it. They were all stale. They were definitely not as good as they looked. We were mad that we wasted our money, and they weren't cheap. We probably should've asked for our money back but were too tired to hassle it. Wouldn't go back :(",ZuFMw_WJZuOgvndGnr2xXA,0,0,2,zsJcyHjLn7cEmD8jam6AiA
5876153,2017-06-27,7,2rvBPUBtQU0WfcOAHLQWRQ,"The creativity behind the menu is impressive. 

Katy Cherry? Kim Kardoughsian? I mean, c'mon. They have lots of donuts, waffles, milkshakes. They even have a burger on the menu with a donut bun. The space is wild and colorful and there is plenty of seating.

I am convinced I love donuts until I order them and realize I only eat a few bites. I like donuts and I liked Crunch Donut Factory, I just didn't love it. 

We stopped in mid-day and noticed Crunch is open 24 hours. Not sure when or how often they are baking, but the donuts didn't taste fresh The space was also looking a little neglected and needed a good wipe down for how slow it was. 

I will say that I loved the Katy Cherry. A yeast square donut topped with a ring of cheesecake and a cherry filling. I'm a sucker for anything cheesecake and anything cherry. Out of the four we ordered, it was my only favorite. The flavors of the signature Crunch and Lemony Snicket were very artificial and the donuts were very dry. I was most looking forward to the Taylor Crisp (for obvious reasons *ahem, my name*) but was so sad that the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal was totally stale. 

The staff seemed pleasant enough and one of the patrons assured me that I could look like him if I ordered a dozen. We both had a good chuckle as he rubbed his belly.

It might have to be a late night before I return to Crunch, but I have high hopes for this creative group.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,18,9,3,iNL-xPxeWrdUID5RTKDyZw

The Leonardo oreo one was very dry and dense,
The Adoughl one looked amazing with Butterfinger bits on top. Again, had minimal toppings and was very dry.
The Sheryl Krognut was extremely delightful, flakey layers filled with Apple cinnamon, just delicious. The Nutshell Doughbama was nice, not completely overwhelming but likeable.
I did fancy the Angelina jelly, it's like eating a pb&j
