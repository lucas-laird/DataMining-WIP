Shortly after this review the ""Owner"" contacted me wanting to get my side of the story after speaking with the ""manager"". Largely motivated to find a solution so he could have me remove the photos and change my review. 

I told him I would consider it if the ""manager"" wrote a thoughtful apology and fully admitted to his actions and took accountability. 

The ""manager"" did. I've posted a picture of the apology for everyone to see that the quality of the apology amazingly reflects the quality of service and food they are selling, ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!

1807979,2017-03-19,0,XarMlmD4QuRgGdoYoKRRSQ,I am  visiting in town and decided to use uber eats for the first time as we had a long day and wanted to stay in. This was one of the most disappointing experiences I've had. The restaurants lack of concern from the way they packed the food to the burnt garlic bread that was as hard as a rock and the 4 missing side salads that were supposed to come with my dinner as well as the 2 liter of soda for my hungry children was appalling. I can't believe with such convenience to gain tourists business they would have such a lack of concern with fulfilling an extremely easy order as all 4 dinners were the same exact thing. Needless to say I sent my dry pasta back with uber driver as all the sauce was at the bottom of the bag. Luckily pizza was 1/2 way decent so I could feed my 2 children who had been swimming for the past couple hours and were starving. Uber eats driver was very gracious to take my food back and pick up fresh pasta with sauce on it not in the bag. Uber's driver was great but restaurant really needs to reevaluate the quality of service provided to their customer. This is nothing more than below the line behavior.,syPOHeM9X-XrxhjwfkFRuw,1,0,1,Z2NNXhn_3TvJcze7cXF43w

We've tried the pizza, wings, burgers, and Philly cheese steaks. Each time we all left feeling like we didn't want to go back, but it's the kind of location you wish you could.

Pizza - pizza hut quality crust & sauce quality with papa murphy's (frozen pizza) quality toppings. The pizza was a mess. The toppings rolled right off of the pizza and ended up on your plate in a big mess rather than in your mouth. The quality of the toppings were mediocre. We got a supreme pizza (large) and it fed 2 of us but wasn't something I would go back to eat again. You could get a higher quality pizza at a franchised pizza delivery service (for less $$ too) even though we dined in.

Burgers - had a western burger and it was decent. It's not a burger joint but the patty and bun were good. The fries weren't good. On multiple visits we tried the fries and each time we couldn't try more than a couple. They were hot, but the taste was incredibly bland and tasted worse than if they had just used a frozen bag from the supermarket.

Wings - the best thing at Joe's. Well breaded, tangy sauce. Multiple members of the group stated this was consistently the best thing they tried. The only problem was that I wouldn't go to a pizza place to get wings. This is kind of the general problem - too many options on the menu with not enough focus. Is it a pizza place? Deli? Burger Joint?

Service - there are always a lot of employees. They all seem nice enough but almost every time we have been there the staff acts as if they've never taken an order before. Again, the staff is polite but untrained or socially awkward.

Water - we were charged $1 for a cup of tap water and we weren't told about that before we paid for it. If we would have known we would be charged for tap water we would've gotten a soda. 

This is a place I really wish I could like. The people making the food and taking the orders seem very nice. It's also local, so I want it to succeed but it just seems to lack focus around the menu and the ingredient quality. I know this place has (12) 5 star reviews which I think are all from the staff so I wanted to write something realistic to help other yelpers in their food decisions.",r6ri9WCAr77pD2r7uUXRjg,3,0,2,Gdp5Ys0jyce7gFCA-RwHGQ

My friend insisted on upon ordering in Joe Phillys and I went along with having never heard of this place. We ordered a medium meat lovers and a order of chicken wings and fries. Delivery was surprisingly quick, beating their estimate of 45 minutes by 20 minutes.

Unfortunately the pizza was soggy due to the grease from all of the toppings and cheese. We had to put the pizza in the oven but it still didn't fix the problem. The chicken fingers were dry and looked like the came from the freeze section of Costco. The fries were tasteless and under cooked.

3566791,2017-08-26,0,XarMlmD4QuRgGdoYoKRRSQ,"I was really in the mood to get a couple of slices of pizza, and had been thinking about where to go, when I remembered that there was a pizza place near the airport.  This is not the same pizza place that was there in the past, but I figured I would give them a shot and go ahead and get something to eat.

When I went into the restaurant, I noticed that it looked similar to what it had looked like under the former name, so made the assumption that the food would still be similar.  I ordered two slice a pizza and a drink along with some fries.  When they told me almost $10 I already started to rethink my order, but was stupid and went ahead and paid anyways. $10 may not seem like a lot, but for a fast food pizza joint in LV, that is more than you should pay unless you are getting really good high quality slices.

I did receive the order quickly, maybe too quickly, which should have been the first sign that speedy service was more important then getting good food.  The French fries tasted like they had been cooked to quickly in oil that wasn't as clean as you want for a good order of fries.  I only ate about half of the fries and then gave up on them (I still have an upset stomach several hours later).  I had figured that I could drown the fries in ketchup, but it was obvious that used a generic brand of ketchup that tasted cheap.

I also received my pizza slices at the same time as the fries, and the first thing that I noticed was that one of the slices looked like a normal size slice, while the other slice looked like it was on the small size, almost like it came from a smaller pizza.  I figured that since I paid the price for an entire pizza, I should at least get two decent size slices, which I didn't (I guess this wasn't important since I ate only part of the second slice and decided it just wasn't worth it, and left).  When I tried the pizza it was very obvious that the slices had been siting around, and they tasted like they had been reheated, but without being even a little crispy, and they had very little flavor.  The pizza also had almost no cheese or pepperoni which put this pizza at the level of a little tony pizza you would buy for about $1.50 in a grocery store.

I would suggest if you see this restaurant, you keep walking, because the food is way overpriced and not very good.",kMESHR02O5I4ZeIVIIrDaQ,1,0,1,IwPjg5S7FC8zNAou68jYvQ

I'm not sure why it's called ""Joe's Philly's Pizza"" as that seems kind of confusing. Are they about the pizza? Are they about the Philly Cheesesteak? I didn't know that Philadelphia was known for their pizza.

Anyway, in three visits, I've ordered their cheesesteak twice and it was pretty good. I've eaten a lot of cheesesteak sandwiches in my life - I would have to say this ranked somewhere in the middle to lower spectrum. However, the lunch special comes with fries and a fountain drink for around $6. I do have to comment that the fries were pretty soggy and under salted. The sandwich itself is not bad, it could use more meat, cheese and onions and peppers. The bread was decent as well.

I've also gotten the chicken wings. The wings were actually pretty good. Not the best I've had, but definitely not the worst. The amount of buffalo sauce really varies. Sometimes they've smothered the wings and other times there's hardly been any on them. Either way, I think it tastes just like Jack's Hot Sauce, so I'll just put that on if I go back again.

The service is pretty quick. They usually have your order to you within 10 minutes (usually less). All in all, it's not a bad place, but fairly mediocre. I'll have to try the pizza  if I go there again.",lTrFOWPEb_NkbOLNN9Dkrg,3,1,2,n9Jixbw94wf2DjvTKoxsXw

The Goods: Friendly service, decent wings & good crust & sauce on the pizza. 

The Not-So-Goods:

It's kind of hard for me to pin-point what exactly is wrong with this place. The servers are friendly, but they don't seem to know what can and can't be done. Example: I ask for a small cup of water and here is what I was replied with the times I asked - 1) Grab a bottle of water and it should be fine. 2) Sure, here's a cup and you can use the fountain. 3) Ok, I will give you a cup but be sure not to fill it up with soda...AND THEY THEY CHARGED ME FOR FOUNTAIN SODA ANYWAY (I didn't realize until after I paid). 

To continue with the lack of consistency, even though we eat in every single time, we are often brought out food already boxed up as if we ordered pick-up or delivery. One time once we ordered a pizza, the server walked out with the pizza in the box without any plates or utensils (you might ask why utensils...read later). At least attempt to cater towards your dine-in visitors. 

Lets talk about the pizza. I am a major pizza enthusiast and I don't believe there is a such thing as a bad pizza. But I've never been more disappointed with a pie in such a long time.

I tried the supreme pizza and outside of the crust and sauce...everything was such a complete hope mess. It just seemed like they threw on numerous frozen vegetables, and then caked a lot of cheese on the top of the toppings and assumed that was it.  The peppers, and onions weren't fully cooked and the toppings were so heavy, I could barely even hold a slice without all of the cheese and toppings falling off. This is why having utensils would be nice so I can at least some pieces and eat the pizza with the cheese and toppings in one bite.

This pizza would be somewhat passable if they only delivered, but if I'm dining in, I would expect some kind of quality increase since the pizza would generally be fresher. I severely question the reviews that say this is the best pizza in town. I understand that this is a local establishment, but that doesn't mean it should get favorable reviews for unfavorable flavors. 

Is this better than Digorno? Nope
Is this better than Little Caesars? Sorry...but not really. I like LC though, but why would I come to a place that has lower quality pizza for double the price of LC ($8 for a supreme)?

Despite the fact that some of their other food is decent (mainly the wings), I place a heavy weight on the pizza itself. I really wanted this to be a great place, but #soniamdissapoint.

It just seems like they are on the cusp of making a damn good pizza, hopefully they take actual criticism and will make proper adjustments. If anyone is wondering why am I so critical of the pizza, it's because it's a pizzeria.

I lived in Philly for 6 years and I've had some great pizza, this place was kind of disappointing one this night.  The staff were not very friendly or helpful and acted like you were bothering them.  

I guess being open later then some places you get a lot of people wondering in and since people tend to order something, they don't have to go out of their way to be friendly or helpful.

The pizza was more dough then pizza, it was almost like eating a pretzel with sauce on it.  I ordered a sausage slice and they were not very generous with the sausage, it was mostly a cheese slice but with the sausage price.

I would not go back to this place when in Philly again, there are way to many pizza places to have to return to this one.  It also could have just been the staff there on this particular night, so its hard to say.  The best suggestion I can give is to stop in, grab a slice and post a review.

4655441,2017-03-08,7,XarMlmD4QuRgGdoYoKRRSQ,"Extra! Extra! Read all About It: Joe Philly's Is One of the few Places Serving Pizza Burgers! 

   Both Eastern Avenue and Sunset Road make news for the hot new restaurants and coffee houses that border the two thoroughfares. What has been kept out of the news is that at the corner of Eastern Avenue and Sunset is that there is a pizzaria that is one of the few and possibly only place in the southeast Valley to pick up a pizza burger. 

  What is a pizza burger? The pizza burger is the marriage of pizza and hamburger. It is a hamburger that is topped off with mozzarella cheese and pizza sauce. Although the pizza burger is rare in Las Vegas, it is a common staple of the family owned diners that are popular in the New York metropolitan area. They are so uncommon in Las Vegas that this pizza burger was the very first one that I ate in Las Vegas since relocating here in 2004.

  It wasn't the pizza burger that brought me to this pizzaria tucked in a strip mall in back of a McDonald's and across from Sunset Park. When I stepped inside on February 24, my intention was to try their pizza and check out their menu. If you know me, you know that what I like more than pizza is the eggplant parmagaina sub that some pizzarias serve. Joe Philly's apparently isn't one of them. However they have a good size menu that includes combinations displayed on the door and window. On my first visit, I'd try their two pizza slice special. 

   Their two pizza slice special goes for $4.99. The special includes a fountain Pepsi. When I paid Angela at the register, I noticed a sign that says if you check in on Yelp you get either a free cold beverage, coffee, or slice of pizza. This would come in handy for the pizza burger. Before discussing the pizza, I will write that Angela was the employee that I dealt with both times. After paying her for the food, a few minutes later she brought it to the table. Her attitude was good. Just like Angela's attitude, the slices of pizza were good. 

  Exactly a week later, I returned for my debut Las Vegas pizza burger. I paid Angela $8.99 plus tax for a pizza burger with fries. By telling her that I was checking in on Yelp, the fountain Pepsi was on them. After paying, I returned to one of the sundry of tables opposite the counter. Later I would step into the extra room to photograph a mural depicting a journey from Chicago to Las Vegas. This is one of my pictures below. Now a few of my pictures below are of the pizza burger. The Joe Philly's pizza burger just like their pizza is good. Being that it is so difficult to find a pizza burger in Las Vegas, I am content with a good pizza burger. The dripping mozzarella cheese and pizza sauce over a hamburger patty between two buns brought back memories of the pizza burgers that I have enjoyed in the New York diners. 

  Although this place is called Joe Philly's, in my book it is Joe New York's. When I ate their pizza burger it simply put me in a New York State of Mind.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,11,3,AgVTcyFM_dFmwwG1tE6wZA

The sauce that we asked for was not in the bag and once the driver returned we called the store to ask for the sauce. The guy on the phone said that the driver had forgotten it and that basically there's nothing he can do. My husband asked for the money back and the guy on the phone said we had to get it back from grub hub, we ordered from yelp, in cash. Even the driver couldnt understand why he wouldnt just give us back cash. Not too mention he didn't know how much the zepoles cost! We were on the phone with this man debating on the price and that its in cash and to give us back the $4. Never ordering here again. That driver should have never been blamed for the mistake of the store.",nwPRF-NNYxB-hx56LoBWBA,1,0,1,eTGhgCOKljS8zp27Pv3V_w

5949693,2015-01-11,0,XarMlmD4QuRgGdoYoKRRSQ,The customer service was excellent. I placed an order for delivery. I ordered chili cheese fries and a garden salad. The fries were okay because the chili had beans. I should've asked but most places don't have chili with beans. I  will order from here again but something else. If you like chili with beans you'll like the fries.,5U0xR6gLovxvnEKfn0eG1Q,0,0,3,9YMGytuKY1RZtkfKGqDxBA
