The boneless wings were actually more like chicken tenders, but they were meaty and delicious. White meat chicken, fresh, and the batter was good. The hot sauce was similar to a franks sauce - definitely hit the spot.

The regular wings (Bonz) were a good size and tasted fresh. I thought it was just as good as Buffalo Wild Wings if not better. Nice and crisp on the outside. However the honey bbq sauce is better at BWW's. Still good though.

The fries were cut super thin which I liked. They were well seasoned and crispy. I'll definitely be back to try their other sauces and sides.

The restaurant is quite small on the inside, but it has some cool decor and a fun, casual atmosphere.",BCjrY4emoG1yyjhO17WdWg,0,0,4,wLJgqVrwYkUVEGLW1gVtaw

Not just once but on several occasions.  Chicken Bonz has some of the best wings I've had in a while and they are crispy, large wings that don't disappoint.

When you walk in there is a huge menu board that you order from at the front counter.  The girl I ordered from was very nice and energetic (I wish I remembered her name, sorry).  And she also served us or food.  The ambiance of the place is laid back and almost feels like a college bar esk type of place.  We got the wings and they were at a good temp, large and crispy (just the way I like them).  Oh and the sweet potatoe tots are AWESOME!!!!! They make a mean sweet tea and the TV's were on ESPN.  So all in all it was a great experience...  

So if you have one by you or your craving some seriously good wings look the place up!",aT_AzbpcsbodNNtFzPqRVg,1,1,4,61GPOJYJkfFJislYA2e_bg

I decided to check this place out when I had a craving for some chicken wings and honestly BWW just doesn't do it for me. Ironically, this location was across the street from BWW so thought eh what the heck, I'll try it. 

Once we arrived it was dead! However, that didn't discourage me from trying this place. Looking at the menu, the AYCE is the best deal. At first, I was a little confused on how the process worked since the hostess/cashier/waitress really didn't explain it. But in the end I was ok with it. After an hour, then service picked up.

So enough with the fluff, let's get down to business. These little suckers are huge! Seriously the first basket with 10 pieces will get you full. Make sure to split the order with 2 flavors so you can sample at least 2 different sauces. After the first basket, each basket comes with 5. And nothing says awesome like $1 PBR to wash down the wings. For a minute there, I felt like I was a competitive eater as I raced to beat the 12-yr old kid that kept eating wings. Unfortunately I paid for it after 30 some wings.

We seriously tried every flavor - sesame soy started off good but by the 3 wing, I need something to drink. It became salty and the sauce was thick. The Garlic Parm wasn't bad but honestly just tasted like fried chicken. I love sweet chili but they didn't put enough sauce on these suckers. Remember folks, if chicken is battered and deep fried, more sauce is needed than usual especially when the sauce is thin. The hot sauces were pretty similiar to Hooters. Overall, if you're a fan of Hooters, you'll enjoy this place. It's quieter, $1 beers and big screens to keep you entertained.

The wings here are large and in charge, and I like that they don't over-batter them.  They always seem to come out crispy, and not drowned in sauce, which is a plus for me.  I don't care that they don't have like 20 flavors like BWs, because their sauces are tasty and they run the spice gamut.  Service is friendly, and fast, and I like that they have rolls of paper towels on the tables, and give you wet naps to clean up when you're done eating.

Now I have not been inside their yet, this review is for a catered lunch from my work by them. 

Ultimately my biggest problem was with the wings, the tenders were decent and so were some of the sauces, but the wings were not like chicken wings, they were breaded a bit which from containers they were catered in, made them soft. Truthfully, I would compare this chicken wing more to KFC than to Buffalo Wild Wings. They are big like Buffalo wings, and the chicken itself was fine quality, but the breading ruined them terribly considering them as chicken wings. Not sure if my work ordered them like that but it was definitely no good.

Maybe I will walk in and try the place and see if they can up a star. $1 beers might do that :)",x16Fl_5h9aX4tn38kKSGHw,0,0,2,7I3hHiz1Dh2B5dpANoGvIQ

1942434,2012-10-30,0,S1Bs_x9aHFFZozwJLCNTgQ,"I have to wholly recommend this place. It blows most wings you have tried in your life out of the water. The deal for endless wings is great ($12.99 all you can eat). 

The wings come breaded and fried, never cold or nasty-tasting.  They are very crispy and have a great texture. There are several sauces: regular wing sauce with varying degrees of spice and a few other ones (Honey BBQ, teriyaki, sweet chili garlic, sweet and sour, etc.). The regular wing sauces come with a nice buttermilk ranch as well, not the mayo-based sauce other places might serve. The wings are very big and meaty, not very tiny. They give you bigger portions in your first round and afterwards shrink it down. Not exactly what some may like, but it is all-you-can-eat  and it is less wasteful in case you overestimated your appetite. 

I have to also recommend the fries. They come very crispy and thin. These have to be among the best tasting fries I've had as well. They don't give you sauce for these fries, you have to get it over at the condiments counter but the side benefit is they also serve fry sauce and in case you want to dip it in ranch, there usually is enough left afterwards for dipping. There is a drink fountain (Coke-based) and a tea machine for those who would rather partake in that instead. 

Normally, the service for this place is decent; my only complaint is that sometimes the waiters can screw up the sauce you have, but bringing it up with them usually fixes the problem. I have to commend the employees (an older brunette and a young cook with a buzz cut) that worked yesterday. Although it was very busy and understaffed, they did not lose their cool and kept the service with a smile. I hope the managers do, however, at least adequately staff the place for the busier times. It's not fair to the customers, nor is it to them, who have to bear the grunt of it.",CvfrgJUaMAwD3ALeKGgJ4A,0,0,4,XMrbujWTCiuiVe54NGSNaA

Went back today after a long hiatus and I must say that I'm very disappointed in the service. My husband ordered the all you can eat wings, like he has many times before. It took forever for someone to even come back to our table and finally ask if we were ok. My husband had to ask for a refill (never had to do that before) and finally got more wings. The waitress then asked if he wanted her to put another order in and he said yes. Needless to say it was another long wait before he got his additional order of wings.
This used to be one of out favorite places. Now, due to the shoddy service, I'm not sure we'll be back.",fb_nXRS-sPEM2Eg_yvPS0w,0,1,2,65yLU-bZkEQJ8_M_J2qJjg

You can call this a small sports bar that happens to sell chicken or a chicken place that happens to sell beer.  They have a few small screen TVs and doesn't hold a lot of people.  But it does serve some pretty good chicken tenders which looked like were made from actual chicken meat not the processed stuff.  The wings were so and so but I guess you could compare them to Buffalo Wild Wings which is right across the street.

They are so large that I can barely maintain my grasp without them falling out of my hand because of the weight. I have been to the location on Decatur twice and this one is equally fantastic. We ordered 37 wings, large fries, and 2 ranches which came out to about $45 dollars. However, because of their special that was announced on Yelp this week, I got 50% off my meal. 

The wings: we ordered 4 flavors and my favorite were lemon pepper and damn hot. The lemon pepper was exceptional and WAY better than Wing Stop's where it tastes a lot like oil with a hint of lemon. This lemon pepper really has a zing from the lemon and is as refreshing and light as a deep fried chicken wing could be. The damn hot was a solid spicy buffalo sauce and really isn't that hot. The fries were thin and delicious while the ranch made an excellent side-kick for the wings. 

My only qualm is that it is definitely pricey (without promotions) and that my two orders of wings (25+12) didn't come with ranch. I will definitely come back to this location when the wing craving hits.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,1,0,4,x-ex_xWZbn1rBYAmV8LUrA

2840979,2011-10-22,0,S1Bs_x9aHFFZozwJLCNTgQ,"My brother and I tried this for the first time a few weeks ago and it was love at first bite. Since we wanted to try as many flavors as possible, we went for the all-you-can-eat special for $13 each. As noted in other reviews, the wings were FANTASTIC and ENORMOUS! I have never seen such massive wings in my entire life. My favorite flavors were the Teriyaki, hot and sweet chili - simply irresistible. Service was really good too, but possibly because it wasn't very packed on a Friday night. 

My only complaint is the size of the first basket you are served with the all-you-can-eat special. There were literally 10-15 gigantic wings in this first basket. Given the size of the wings, it was extremely tough to get through this basket in order to make a pass at all the other flavors I wanted to try - sort of defeating the purpose of all-you-can-eat, in my opinion. To add on, each additional basket has at least 6-7 massive wings which further limits the ability to try all the flavors you want. Maybe that's their intention so you have to come back again to try the other flavors? Seems totally unnecessary to me. This is a great product, so no need to pull any tactics to reel potentially repeat customers in.

Anyway, I have wanted to go back again for the all-you-can-eat special but I'm not sure if I can stomach the massive first basket again - no matter how ridiculously tasty they are.",gHDqDsYd9k-3VqjwEOz6UQ,0,0,4,YbAKGSOQkQE2MJWlElFNJg

...So rolling with my two favorite ladies going to the SW to see a friend last Saturday the 2nd, and searched yelp for CHICKEN WINGS BURGERS in SW Nevada. Chicken Bonz came up as number 1 most reviewed for the SW.

So after we hit my friends, we went over to Chickn Bonz on Durango and Warm Springs. It's kinda hidden from the street as your going east to west on warm springs, so look for it behind a jack in the box I think it was.

Anyway, pulled up about 8pm on a Saturday night, got out of vehicle and.... fell in love instantly....with the sign i read.

ALL YOU CAN EAT CHICKEN WINGS - $12.95

Really!!? REALLY?!?! YIPPEE KI YEAAAAAAAA MOFO!

*ahem*

Anyway, proceeded inside, nice sports barish atmosphere with neon signs, and cool memorabilia on the wall, not a big sports fan so didn't really pay attention. Few video games, and nicely decorated. Ordered our food from the smokin' hot counter girl, that was mutli-tasking like a mofo. Good size crowd taking up most of the tables, got our pitcher, and chilled for about 10 minutes till we got our food. The girls ordered a juicy looking burger that they shared, totally enjoying the texas toast used as a bun instead of the normal McD's bun. Nice. For the AYCE you get 10 to start, and have to order in increments of 5 after that. 

Ordered the Garlic Salsa somethin somethin at the counter of the about 10-12 different flavors they had. I can't remember because the counter girl was hot and I was distracted. 

Anyway, I was expecting tiny little wings like you get at Hooters (I go for the wings) and l and behold, good size pieces of  wings filling up the little tray basket. slathered in my choice sauce. The cool counter person working by herself came up and apologized for it taking a little longer than expected, but she was single handedly handling the entire front by herself with about 15-20 customers on the floor, and about 8 in line AND asnwering the phone, and rocking getting everybody's order in. I worked retail/food the last 11 years and give her kudos, she even managed to compliment my homegirl's tattoo in the middle of all of it!

The wings filled me up surprisingly quick, convinced we were going to sit there for at least two hours  (my homegirls know I love wings) I ended up ordering just one more set of wings and I was content, fat and happy after just 15 wings. I was not surprised with the good size delicious wings, and threw in the  towel at 15. My friends were surprised I was done too. I only tasted the Garlic Chili and Teriyaki, but will go back to try the other ones. 

Had a definitely enjoyable experience, wish the place was a little bigger, as far as choice of seating, but perfectly good time eating some wings.

I live in the north, but will drive down to the SW just for the service, atmosphere and great experience I had with my friends at this location, even though there's another one I guess 10 minutes away from where I live. (I asked the counter girl)

The atmosphere is a fun, bar-like style with four or five flat screens covering the walls and a ""big ass fan.""

Now for the most important part--the food. Obviously chicken wings,(Bonz), are their specialty as well as chicken tenders, (Bonzless). The chicken is freakin delicious! It's got to be some of the best chicken for a place of it's kind in Vegas. They have twelve different sauces ranging from Lemon Pepper to Damn Mistake, which you can have as a dipping sauce or have your chicken tossed in it. 
If you aren't a fan of chicken, or simply not in the mood for it, Chicken Bonz also offers really unique burgers served on Texas Toast! Another popular choice is the salad bar, for those of you who don't like tasty animals.... 

The prices are very reasonable. A 5 piece bonz or bonzless combo, with fries and a drink, is $7.95, a burger with fries and a drink is $6.95-8.95, depending on the size, and the salad bar is $4.95 for one time through.

I went here last weekend with a friend on his recommendation. Right after he ordered and sat down the girls behind the counter began snickering and making fun of him. They didn't realize I was with him until I rather angrily brought up that he was my friend, then they shut up. 

The food itself? Its mediocre as hell. I ordered the 6 wing and fries combo and what I got was wings that were barely sauced, overly breaded and that tasted almost metallic. The fries were straight out of the frozen food section at Sams Club and tasted like sticks of styrofoam. And after waiting nearly 20 minutes for WINGS and FRIES, the food was lukewarm. If you keep me waiting, the food had damn well better be hot when I get it.

One more note: the server (I noticed) was avoiding us and the group that was seated  behind us (minorities), but was going out of her way to attend to the white frat boys on the patio every five minutes. Read into that what you will.

The waitresses were super friendly, the service was quick.  I ordered the salad bar, it's limited choices and only allows one trip through but it's cheap.  The boy ordered 2 different types of wings, garlic parm and hot, as well as their sweet tater tots.  We weren't disappointed in anything.  The salad bar is limited but that's ok with me and the dressings were good.  I love wings that are ""dry"" and still moist and tasty.  The garlic parm wings were just that.  Tasty, moist and crispy.  The hot wings were hot, we are kind of crazy about spice, but not super hot.  They have two levels higher so I can imagine if you want to cry and sweat there is that opportunity, we'll try it next time.  The tater tots were really good and flavorful as well.  

It was the day after st. patty's day, so I will give them a pass but there was no beer left at all.  That was too bad.  But all in all it was a great experience and we will be going back.  Love it!",WEXkES4QG-INtrBMtdFyBQ,1,0,5,sFzsOdgHTP6_kpcjM7PBKw

When I went to the cashier to use it she nicely tried to explain to me that it expired and another man that worked there RUDELY told me it expires before that date not through that day. Then tries to degrade me saying it was only $6 like I was being cheap. That was not the point of using the groupon since I had never been there before, that groupon opened my eyes that it was there and we eat out alot. i had to step out of line and almost started crying because of this rude employee. I told him I wasn't arguing with him and he walked away. He was rude to another group of men sitting by us so I know he is just an unhappy person. We debated even eating there, but did, since I've always wanted to try it. Food was pretty good which is why the 2 stars and the cashier was a nice woman but it's a shame this one experience will never get me into another chicken bonz anywhere because no one deserves to be treated like that.",jT-NvMDXLGlgFCtzl0ERLw,0,0,2,cLcSI3NLCY1hGp7KWOYaFg

6 wings, some fries and a drink for a price of $7.99, ouchie! Not that bad when you get 12 wings, a lot of fries, and two drinks for $7.99. Went with the flavors that I usually order from Wing Stop which were lemon pepper and honey BBQ, not bad, but not going to pull me away from Wing Stop or Buffalo Wild Wings anytime soon. I did notice that the wings were slightly bigger.

Parking and service was as good as it gets for a chicken wing joint.

Me and the bf went here one night and I was conflicted if i liked the place or not lol, I ordered the bone in parmesan chicken wings with fries and a drink. I must say I love how big the chicken wings are and the way they fry them is delicious but i wasn't a fan of how they do the parmesan they just sprinkle it on so half of the wings were just plan because the parmesan wasn't sticking to it. I usually go to wing stop and i love the way the do there parmesan wings its more like a sauce rather then just throwing it on so if chicken bonz had wingstops parmesan sauce they would have been alot better. I'm not a fan of their fries either there thin and tasteless. 

I thought this place was ok and its a bit pricey I'm not sure if I would return here I might just stick with my wing stop and call it a day.",hv_M1Kf1EPWDBB1bgnzu6Q,6,3,3,LvpXq6B4h8VM18DeV2Whpw
3698064,2012-03-16,0,S1Bs_x9aHFFZozwJLCNTgQ,"Chicken wings? How can you say no! You just can't go wrong with chicken wings. Hi five to them for providing an awesome 20% check in discount. I just ordered a simple 5 piece bone in chicken parmesan deal. No combo. Total came to $4.95 after the discount. 

The chicken was awesome! A nice crisp outer crunch and a tender juicy center. How many bites does it take to get to the bone? I'll never know...

The only downside was that the 2 offerings I was looking forward to wasn't delivered. They had free wifi, but I couldn't connect. $1 draft beer! I was so stoked, but alas, they were tapped out (no pun intended!) Figures. $1 beer was just too good to be true. Why offer $1 beer for people to look forward to and then be out of beer. Big sad face to that!

Here's are a few offerings I noticed as well:

75 cents extra for ranch or blue cheese (but that's a given I think any chicken wing joint charges for sauce)

$12.95 for all you can eat chicken wings

$7.50-$8.00 for a 5 piece chicken wing combo depending if it's bone in or out

Burgers come with fries and are made with Texas toast for buns.

Flat screens to watch that game you had just placed a bet for. I know that's a big plus for all you sports fans!

It's a very hip little joint to go to if you want to grab a good bite to eat alone or with friends!",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,3,2,3,bYKr3iHx3K2pi48Q_w25pA

The batter is slightly soggy and the atmosphere is quite dank and vacant feeling, even with people there.

This place has mixed ambiance.  Part sports bar, part family friendly, part salad bar? Odd.  

The salad bar is what you would expect: basic romaine lettuce and a myriad of toppings.  Pleasantly surprised by how clean and fresh everything was.  It could be vastly improved with a nice spring mix in place of the bland romaine; alas, die hard salad bar fans would likely disagree.

We had wings, fingers and sweet potato tots.  We tried two different flavors of sauce.  It was nice that they were on the side so you could pick and choose and dip or not dip.  Chicken was very good.  Tots were tasty.  

A nice neighborhood spot to hit for a quick dinner with the fam.  Nothing to blow your mind but plenty to fill your belly without breaking the bank.

4239059,2011-08-12,2,S1Bs_x9aHFFZozwJLCNTgQ,"I wouldn't want to mess with the chickens that these wings came from. They're gigantic. It's like they did a few leg presses before they met the butcher.

Thanks to my handy Yelp app, I was able to get a ""buy one get one free"" combo just by checking in for the first time. Pretty slick. Came up to around $10 total for two 8 piece combos. You're able to choose from a variety of wet or dry sauces for your wings. We went with the following:

-Garlic Parmesean: Fried to perfection, with a delightful crisp. Not too greasy either. Goes awesomely with the bleu cheese.
-Teriyaki: Pretty much what you'd expect from the name. Standard teriyaki wing sauce. If this is your thing, it's not bad. I'm not the biggest fan of dousing my wings with teriyaki.
-Sesame: Loved the sweet glaze on these wings. Adds a unique twist. Good choice if you're not a fan of dipping the wings in ranch or bleu cheese, since these wings are great on their own.

The skinny fries that these combos came with were also a pretty nice complement to the wings. Dipping them into the bleu cheese was fatteningly satisfying enough to fulfill any of my manly instincts. Plus, with the walls surrounded by gigantic TVs on every corner, it's a great place to check out a game. 


Note: One thing that stood out to me were the All You Can Eat Wings for $12.95, which I'm definitely going to take advantage of on the next visit. Get this deal while a game is going on and you're good to go.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,2,0,4,LgtlW-ZG3iUFrEn3J5ypCA

The chicken is always freshly breaded and fried to order. The fries are good too, skinny and crisp. And the value is outstanding, for like 7 bucks you get 5 really large boneless wings and fries.

I am way behind on my yelping!

I wish they offered a 8 wing option, because that is my magic number.  6 and I feel unsatisfied,  and 12, well, I physically cannot do 12, no matter how hard I try and I really wish I could!

I normally get Honey BBQ and Sweet Chili Garlic. That sweet chili garlic, well, great, I am drooling now like Pavlov's dog. I don't loooove the honey bbq, but I don't do buffalo sauce and I don't like a lot of spice.

Because they are breaded, they get soggy really fast, we used to get our bonz to go, but they are 100x better if you eat in. Even our 5 minute drive home ruins them.

Get the sweet potato tots and extra ranch - then drink the ranch.

10 wings per person for 1st order
5 wings per person for orders after that
You can order as much as you want
Pick and mix sauces. Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan are the only 2 dry rubs.
Order up front first, then the waitress will come around and take your order every time after that.

The Lemon Pepper is my favorite. They have a Cayenne garlic Parmesan flavor too, my second favorite. Blue cheese or ranch dipping sauce. The wings are pretty big compared to the wings in the SGV. They have a soda fountain so free refills as well. $1 beer gets you a small cup of beer on certain brand. Others are $1.50. 

They also have combos you can order if AYCE is not your thing. They take pre-order if you're planning a party. The boyfriend and I ate 15 wings each. Well worth my money!",o2b3y3m4-sT4jUllCn2-oA,3,1,3,j7emNSkzscT05WS6eZSZRQ
