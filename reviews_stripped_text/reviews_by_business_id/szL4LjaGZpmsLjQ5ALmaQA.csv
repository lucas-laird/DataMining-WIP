If you go during peak hours, be prepared to wait. If you have somewhere to be or wanted to stop by here before getting to work, give yourself some time. Line will sometimes extend out to the Walgreens drive through pharmacy and the inside won't be any shorter.

Service kinda sucks here and the baristas are not the friendliest but oh well... Now for the drinks, just like other places, they're made inconsistently. Rarely do I think my drink was delicious but I always give them the benefit of the doubt for their seasonal flavors. But majority of the time, drinks here taste watered down even after adding an extra shot of espresso. I will say that I have never gotten my drink order messed up though!

Overall, this is my go to spot if I need a quick caffeine fix that's near home and don't feel like driving far for some better coffee. This place isn't the best but it gets the job done.",Ucn8yabLDIiDasbLkNy0Ng,0,0,3,Md6tK2rAIgwt8ajx6HQ96A

2231423,2016-12-30,2,szL4LjaGZpmsLjQ5ALmaQA,"This is the slowest Starbucks ever, and the staff today (29 Dec 2016 at 2 PM) were the dullest bunch I had ever encountered. 

 I ordered a grande dark roast via mobile app, and I waited for 20 minutes, frequently walking over to the counter to check for my order--my app said that my order should be ready.  I was frustrated because there is no preparation involved in a grande coffee--the barista just has to fill the coffee into the cup and put a lid and sleeve on it.  I assumed that my order was backed up because the staff was too busy with the drive-thru, until someone who ordered long after me got their order.  So then I waited in the queue and then asked the cashier what was going on.

I told him that I ordered a grande dark roast on my mobile app about 20 minutes ago, and he said that they don't brew dark roast after 12 PM, then fetched my order receipt that had been sitting on their counter the whole time I was waiting. I just told him to get the regular roast, and he apologized in a manner of just playing it off as nothing.  

In summary, there were three problems that could have improved this situation, one on my part.

1) I could have forcefully demanded one of the baristas for my drink (adding the fact that all they had to do was pour it into the cup) rather than waiting patiently and assuming they were busy with the drive thru.

2) The baristas could have noticed the many times (4 or 5, I think) that I walked to the pick-up counter, holding up my mobile in the most obvious way possible, and asked if I was Karen, since the receipt was SITTING ON THE COUNTER THE WHOLE TIME.

3) Whoever updates the ""not in stock"" status updates on the mobile app (probably one of the baristas) should have updated the dark roast to be unavailable after 12 PM if they were going to mess with my plans to drink dark roast like that.",1TAa3rcRk8jf7Vb0yodXJA,3,1,1,AyA7Vd3_lXbU5llAvZmLXA

I did give them a star for friendliness but I would've given more stars if they get my order right more often. 

It's a very clean & well stocked store with treats & bottles drinks.

There has been times when I'm sitting at the window and I get my stuff but they just left me there, didn't say ""thank you, you are good, or have a nice day"" nothing, by the time the girl opened the window she was like ""yeah can I help you?"" then the other day my wife got a bagel, toasted, with cream cheese to go on the app. I ran in grabbed the bagel, it was not toasted, no big deal I'll eat it like that, then I realize that there was no cream cheese, I stand there wait till I see that there is an opening say excuse me, two girls stop look up and then get back to work...Cool, they are busy I get it, I wait till they finish the drinks they are working on, I again say excuse me, this time one only looks up and then goes back to work. This time I had enough, I bellow ""excuse me please"" so that everybody in the store hears me, a girl answer ""how can I help you?"" I tell her I have no cream cheese, she gets me one. She then ask me if I even ordered it , to which I reply yes, she then wants to give me attitude and finally hands me my cream cheese...These are just two occasions that pop to the top of my head, there has been many more...

Da Wait: 1/5 if there is more then one car in the drive thru expect to be there forever!!! They are so slow!!! We have waited over 30 minutes before.

Da Good: Customer and paying it forward. 

Da Bad: Super long wait times, always mess up the drinks, and attitude galore!!!

Da Ugly: The people that work here are pieces of poo!!! Not all of the but a lot of them...they act like us as customers should feel honored that these people are serving us.

Overall: I dislike starbucks a lot, they mess up the drinks, they give lots of attitude and they are way to expensive...save your money go to a mom and pop shop...

PS: I don't spend money here, I refuse. My wife gets lots of Starbucks gift cards...this is the only reason I go here....

PSS: southern highlands we are getting a dutch brothers!!!!",7KoN2yg19p6wwDg755Qtug,0,0,1,VjNJvOEqW-yXoIw46WJV9Q
4971441,2016-08-17,0,szL4LjaGZpmsLjQ5ALmaQA,"First off, I really hate writing negative reviews. I've worked in the service industry and I truly understand the struggle to make customers walk away happy. However I have lived in southern highlands for over a year and have battled with my feelings toward this particular Starbucks. I have never seen such a lack of consideration towards other people's time. It's astonishing that this drive through and store have lines that take over 20 min with 4-5 cars. Something is fundamentally wrong here. Management needs to really take a hard long look at the training for the staff. There is absolutely no sense of urgency, some of the drive through baristas are cold and rude. There are much higher volume stores on the strip and all around vegas that can get orders out the door in less than half the time that this particular branch can. So this review is for the management team, something needs to change and it starts with you. If a manager can't inspire and encourage team members to take pride in their jobs and be motivated, it may be time to reconsider the service industry. Management sets the tone for the team, and clearly it's not working. Don't let your team down and continue to get poor ratings.",lPFa-FnB3ve56mt3YIvlRg,1,0,1,nB1KFXBRJpgH8ZGNJs9R0Q

They also never warm up my banana bread when requested. Never. The say they do. She also gave me the wrong size straw for a venti size frap. This has got to be intentional.

I've stopped here to get my usual drink on multiple occasions due to the fact I pass through this area frequently. My drink of choice is simple, an iced coffee with extra soy milk and classic sweetener. Every time, it has been wrong, either the classic sweetener is not added or they barely put in any soy milk, AND I'M ASKING FOR EXTRA. Let's be honest, I like my iced coffee light brown colored and sweet(like my women). I usually go through drive-thru to get my drink but today being National Coffee Day, I decided to walk inside and try my luck. Yet again, this Starbucks has failed me. I was served this bitter unsweetened icy concoction. I gave you multiple opportunities to right your wrongs, but it's just no use.

Then, when we tasted our drinks they were awful !! They were totally watered down and my white choc mocha had nothing but foam and only was filled half way !! I should have taken a pic... When I went in to have the drinks re-made, both of the employees were rude about having to re-make the drinks for me. Finally, I asked the girl that didn't wash her hands to please wash her hands next time she makes people their drinks and instead of her apologizing and admitting what she did was wrong she tried to turn it around and make it seem like what she did was okay with a bunch of excuses..

I'm sure ALL Starbucks are busy during the day, this location is no exception.  The staff is friendly, both inside and through the drive-thru.   

Today, I decided to use their app to order my coffee and sandwich before I got there and it was amazing.  You can order online, pay online, and when you get there it's ready to go at the pick up window.    

Pros : fast and convenient if you're on the go.   

Con:  I ordered a breakfast sandwich and call me picky, but it took me a couple mins to get there and my sandwich wasn't as warm as I would like it.  Understandable since it is sitting there.  Also, if you have any offers from the Starbucks app, you won't be able to use it to pay online ... bummer.

When I moved to Vegas by far this is the busiest Starbucks I've ever seen. I'm not a drive thru person and I like that customer service experience rather than driving Thur one window to pay and then proceeding to the next. For those that are, depending on the time, the lines are ridiculously long. I prefer going inside however they are just as busy as their drive thru. Theirs usually around more than 7 baristas working altogether lol that is a lot. Clearly they are a busy location. Most of the time something as simple as screwing up my simple order of making my tea is ludicrous. This happened 7 times to me and the most recent time I told the barista that my tea was plain black and not what I ordered she gazed at me because they had to make it again. If you do it the first time right correctly you wouldn't have to do it again. I didn't even get a ""I'm sorry"" and they definitely don't say thank you or anything. Friendly wise they usually just yell your name out when they past out drinks and that's all you get.

In the afternoon you will wait approximate 10-15 for a coffee and most likely your order will be incorrect.

I understand it was not a slow day, and I don't mind the lack of smiles and greetings, even the wait.
But I got the Green Tea Latte instead of Green Tea Lemonade. After I reflected the mistake, the agent looked at me coldly without saying a word. Right before she redid me the right one, she made another wrong drink, and no one ordered it.
I doubt if Starbucks still holds its golden branding after the two bad experiences back to back in different locations.
