The Benihana at westgate ruined my weekend Vegas vacation by charging me a different amount than I signed for on my receipt by more than double. And when I tried to get it fixed they acted like they had no power as a manager to fix it, referred me to the hotel manager who had nothing to do with Benihanas and they kept me in a phone circle for a whole day and I have yet to be refunded the difference or offered a solution.. I will not only not recommend this place to anyone but I would say to just stay away in general. Never bringing them my money again... If I could press charges I would.

Sometime you can get lucky and make them the same day, but I wouldn't chance it. We made reservations for a Sunday evening at 6:30. We were running late so I called ahead to push my reservation back 30 minutes, the hostess told me they were full and they could only hold our spot for 15 minutes. We make it there at 6:47; they honored our reservation and sat us promptly.  The waitress came around and took our drink orders, she brought me out the wrong wine, but she corrected it right away. It took about 15 to 20 minutes before the chef came out and started taking orders. We all ordered the Benihana Special, which comes paired with steak and a cold water lobster tail, along with soup, salad, veggies and rice. Usually the food is amazing, this time everything came out perfect except the steak which was a bit bland.

 It killed me to watch our tablemates have the chef cook amazing filets, NY strip steaks and chateaubriand to death - medium well on the grill.  To do this, the chef had to cut 4 inch slabs of prime meat into little pieces of overcooked morsels the size of dog food.

Unfortunately our server, Maria, didn't know how to replenish drinks and took forever to bring the checks at the end of the night - it drops my review all the way down to only three stars.  

The food was excellent but I feel it was somewhat overpriced (especially with the lackluster service).  Maria told the table that it was her first night back from a months long vacation and that she wished she didn't have to come back.  Nice!  That's what I want to hear when we are spending a couple of hundred dollars on dinner.  

Shrimp, scallops and steaks were delicious  - but felt I was being fleeced enough without being charged an extra $5.50 a piece for fried rice.   I also loved the green tea icecream!

The night got off to a somewhat rocky start because by 7:15 the chef was still not at our table. We were worried because we had a show to make at the Mirage in a couple of hours, so we advised a waitress of our show time. The manager came over to confirm our show time and they were very kind and accommodating, however, I don't think the chef actually showed up until 7:20 or so. So take note, it's probably best to let them know if you have somewhere to be when you call to make your reservation.

The food was really great, if inauthentic. I had the filet mignon, which was tender and flavorful. My husband had Rocky's Choice (chicken and steak), whichw as also good, but the chicken is nothing special so if we ever go again I think he'll probably stick with the steak.

Our server was TERRIBLE 

We dined here tonight to celebrate mine and my boyfriends birthdays. As soon as our waitress saw we had a birthday coupon she rolled her eyes and gave us a dirty look. 

Our first drink order we asked 3x for limes with my boyfriends cocktail. Never received. I ordered a strawberry margarita. Received strawberry colada. Waited for My server who never even came back to see if everything was ok so we proceeded to drink our drinks as we already waited. And wanted our drinks before our meal. When she finally came back to the table I ordered another round. Asking please make sure it's a margarita this time. Received daiquiri. 

So both my drinks were not even close what I ordered.  I also ordered shrimp tempura, I received vegetable tempura and was charged for a shrimp tempura. 

Our teppan chef was amazing, and the only reason for a 2 star rating I wish I had cash to tip him separate from our waitress. I'm a server I never leave less than 30%, if she gave good service to the only person at the table wearing $10,000 in accessories she probably would've received a tip 10x the amount of what I left. Leaving $10 on a $150 check is not me. But I expect the service to match the bill.

1. The menu showed $28.95 for the Hibachi steak for one. And I am sure somewhere it says the fried rice is extra, but I didn't see it.
2. I ordered the hot tea - it tasted like balsa wood. 2a. I ordered the diet coke because it was the only sugar free item on the menu. [Diabetes type II]
3. I ordered the Hibachi steak medium well, was asked if I wanted fried rice, of course!
4. The diet coke is a 14 oz glass with 10 oz of ice.
5. No choice of ginger or cream sauce [I don't like ginger on my salad.]
6. only positive so far, the soup was OK.
7. drank my 4 oz zof coke and asked for a refill
8. finally after waiting close to an hour, the chef arrives bringing his scowl with him. I didn't laugh once. He only did two 'tricks' and put no heart into it.
9. finally another good thing. grilled shrimp appetizer, about a half dozen.
10. No one is laughing however and it looks like the rice won't be that good. It isn't bad, but is lack luster.
11. Grilled vegies also nothing to write home about.
12. Where's my second 4 oz of diet coke?
13. What happened to those wonderful noodles I get at Shoguns? not here!
14. Steak is overdone and tough. not a happy camper tonight. 
15. Chef leaves with the scowl he brought, but now the whole table is scowling with him.
16. Still no diet coke refill! ate all I wanted, which was not as good as Mikata, much less Shoguns.
17. Surprise. Bill is 28.95 for steak, 3.50 for the coke and a whopping 5.95 for the rice. with tax it's around 42.00. This is for ONE PERSON, no alcohol and only one softdrink.?!?!?

One word says it all AMBIANCE!  As you walk into this place you find yourself right smack dab in the middle of Japan.  Who knew walking through an old worn down hotel you would find yourself in a hidden jewel?!

We arrived for our 7pm reservation for 5 on Friday night for my friend's birthday.  Without hesitation we were lead to an elevator that takes you to the second level.  My friends being that they have been here several times never had been to the second level.  We were seated in kind of a quiet room with only two tables being used-out of six.  There were other rooms we walked by even bigger that were full and totally loud.  So I dont know what is worse being loud in a quiet room or screaming over people in a loud room?! LOL  

The dinner was awsome.  I ordered the spicy chicken breast and the BF ordered the filet.  Both were amazing.  The chicken really wasnt all that spicy but it was still good.  Everyone else loved their food.  We asked for our fried rice extra crispy and the chef was fine with leaving it on there a little longer.  Because it was my friends bday they gave her a kids chefs hat (hehe) and let her man the food for a minute.  It was great for pics.  The chef was great and very entertaining.

The only complaint I had was the waitress wasnt picking up the empty glasses and dishes we were done with so they accumulated in the middle where there was an empty chair between us and the other party.  A little tacky I would say.

So with everyone ordering 2 drinks and a dinner each our bill was $320.00.  That didnt count the $20 we gave the chef beforehand and the total tip at the end.  Whew thats a hefty bill but the experience and food were worth it.  A great memory!

On our way out there were little secluded areas with couches where you can sit and over look the 1st level and just chill and have some drinks.  Totally cool.  Not sure if you can rent those but it would be cool to have a small party there.  So on our way out FIRE WORKS!  Yes fireworks shown on the upper walls just for us!  It was pretty cool I must say.

The show (throwing my food around and stuff) was okay but kinda weird. I ordered Prawns (Spicy) and steak. Was sort of weird as they cook the prawns.. throw em around.. cook up an onion.. set it on fire... then way later knock out my steak.. I ate.. onions.. shrimp.. them steak.. was like two meals.. kinda strange. I would rather they kept it in the kitchen under a heat light then served it all at once. Oh well.. 

So the service as in drinks was low.. not Silverton (the bench mark of crappy service read my review if u don't know that place) but not very good. I would have enjoyed getting a few drinks but instead.. i got .. 1.. lol.. oh well..

Came here on a Saturday night past our reservation, with 3 people in our party. They told us it would be about a half hour wait, but in less than 15 minutes we were on our way upstairs to be seated with 5 other patrons. 

It took a little while for us to get drink and food orders in, but about 10 minutes or so after we put in our food orders, side dishes started arriving while our chef was preparing to make our food. 

I ordered the Garden Vegetable plate for $24.95 (I realize now that they forgot to give me asparagus, grr). If you're ordering a vegan item on the menu, the first thing you bring me should NOT be chicken-based soup. That was a major turn-off and I'm amazed that came with the meal, and they should have asked if I wanted it before doling it out. 

The second part was a ginger salad that was really good, I loved the dressing. After this, our chef came and started making our meal. He was really funny, and did a lot of little tricks that made the dining experience almost like seeing a show too. Sometimes my veggies got a little too close to the meat on the grill for comfort, but they never mixed, although it would be nice if they could have 1/3 of the grill sectioned off for veggies. He made me zucchini, onion, and mushrooms on the grill, and he also had a LOT of veggies steaming in a separate area as well. My plate was HUGE and I didn't even finish everything, I was totally full! And the onion volcano that the chefs make is definitely must-see. It was a total blast.

I alerted the waiter that it was my friend's birthday, and they brought out a complimentary tangerine (?) topped cheesecake slice and sang to her. This cheesecake was AMAZING. It had angel food cake as the crust, and the back part was made up of nuts and some kind of frosting/fondant. The presentation was lovely and it totally made her day.

My only qualms were the pricing ($25 is a bit pricey for veggies, but I think overall it was worth it - my TWO friends got a chef's special together with steak for $34 which is ridiculous in comparison, since they got just as much food) and the fact that the grill should be sectioned off for vegetables and meat. Otherwise it was quite the enjoyable experience and I can see why this place is packed on a nightly basis. Very entertaining and I am sure I will be back again.

One last tip: Go to the Chef's Table section of the official Benihana website, and sign up. You will receive a $30 gift certificate for your birthday :) My friend used hers that night! Oh and don't lie, they ask for I.D. lol.",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,5,4,4,btAY6KqtTuWO1yTdCGfUEw

 It was truly an amazing experience.  I would definitely go visit Benihana again but not this specific location. 

Upon arriving we politely asked to be seated for two and were informed that it would be a 25 minute wait which we were perfectly okay with, after all we did not have reservations,  but one of the ladies said we could wait at the bar just outside, which was nice of her until she said ""but only if you're old enough to drink"" which somewhat bothered me since I am in Vegas alone with my girlfriend inside a casino resort. That isn't the main reason I am giving them 3 stars though.  As we walked in I wad made to feel as if I were underdressed when the waitress mentioned something about what I was wearing(which was attire for 90 degree weather because Vegas is in the desert after all. 

This restaurant is amazing but fairly overpriced.  The price is understandable though since it is just east of the strip and in a hotel. The one thing that it lacks is great service from the waitresses. I did forget to mention our cook which was amazing.  He went out of his way to attempt to tend to everyone's needs and was great at it.  He made jokes and made us all laugh. He is was the light of our night after the not so nice waitress. The photographer lady came to our table and completely ignored us and only spoke to a group of for that was sitting at the same table.  Now I'm not saying this was a terrible thing because we weren't willing to buy a very overpriced photo but I always thought it was common courtesy to greet everyone at a table.  

If you can manage to go there and get a nice waitress you'll probably have a blast.  I loved the ambience and cook. If you go try not to dress too casual as I and a few other people were.

By then our rice and veggies were cold. The waitress tried but she seemed very overwhelmed. We were there a total of three hours! Then all of a sudden it was as if they wanted to kick us out. Except they forgot that it was my fiance's birthday AND desert came with our meal. I asked for a bag for our food and they bought everyone back a bag EXCEPT US. I wasn't sure if we were being discriminated against or if it was just a mistake so.... I asked to speak to the manager (as did another party at our table). It took the ""manager"" 15 minutes to come to our table. She spoke w/the other party first telling them that all she could do was give a discount while waving her hands and seemingly very annoyed. 

Once she got to me I told her that I did not want a discount I wanted to give feedback on the service because we spent quite a bit of money to be treated badly. She told me that she was not the manager and that I shouldn't give her the feedback because she wasn't going to do anything with it... color me SHOCKED. There's no manager? My feedback isn't valuable? By now our ice cream had melted and we still had no check. Finally we paid and I requested the managers card.

We had about 25+ people in our party, but they were expecting us, so it wasn't much of a wait.  At first we all gathered in a very chill bar at the front entrance.  Plenty of chairs and low lighting make it comfortable.  We filled up three huge tables.  The service took a while, but it was a busy Saturday night and given our huge group, I give it a pass.  On to the food.

You might have heard from your friends, et al about the Benihana's gimmick.  After you place an order, a chef comes out to your table and makes it all right in front of you on tabletop grills.  Sure enough, that's what happens and the chef's also have a little standup act going to add to the showmanship.  It actually made it very fun.  Certainly beats sitting around for a half hour for your food.  I had the Chicken Hibachi.  The early courses include soup and salad (nothing special) and your choice of shrimp or veggies.  I went for the shrimp, because I'd never had shrimp before. (I know, I know)  To tell you the truth, it was kinda bland.  The chicken on the other hand was incredible.  Add a little bit of teriyaki and you'll be loving it.

The pricing is high, but not astronomical.  I paid about 30 bucks for my meal, which is among the cheaper items.  The specialty alcoholic drinks are overpriced for what you get, so maybe just stick with a coke or beer.  The motif of the restaurant is like some Japanese village, with fountains and such all around.

When we got there the ambiance was very nice seeing the waterfall then they walk you to the elevator and up you go and then the hostess is there to receive you.

I arrived at the Benihana desk to inquire about dinner for 1. The lady behind the desk offered me the sushi bar (separate restaurant area) or the Asian restaurant. I knew that there was plenty of room at Benihana and replied that I came to eat at Benihana. I was given a pager and told it would be 15 minutes. Ok. Fine. 
I was out front waiting for several minutes when the pager went off and I was seated at a table that already had 4 people at it. Ok. Fine. How long had they been there? Long enough to already have water. 
Our waiter spoke broken English and was hard to understand. Worked through that and ordered a drink. Eventually ordered dinner. 
We had a great chef who talked with us about his sharp knife, how long he had worked there and let it slip that management wasn't having the waiters tip the chefs as part of their payout anymore. If you know anything about tipping in a Japanese restaurant or sushi place, you know that it is customary to tip higher because the chef needs to be tipped. Not here. The wait staff keeps the tips, yet all they actually do is bring you drinks and the appetizers from the back. The chef does most of the work. 
Easy to fix. Tip the chef in cash and reduce the tip to the wait staff accordingly. As I told the chef, two can play at this game. Now I am letting everyone know what they actually do. This is worse than pooling tips and dividing them up to everyone including lazy staff. 
As I said, the chef was great and the food was excellent. 
Now, about our waiter. Two people asked for more water. They got 7 up or some similar lemon lime soda instead. It had bubbles, the customer said it was sweet and it definitely wasn't water.

I ordered the filet mignon (cooked medium with extra garlic butter and seasoning...try it and thank me later!), and lobster tail ( might I suggest you request it sauteed in fresh squeezed lemon juice, chili garlic sauce, and garlic butter... it is sinfully delicious.)  The meal was huge as Hibachis tend to be.  It came with perfectly grilled veggies, and as a mushroom lover I was in mushroom heaven.  The shrimp appetizer was cooked perfectly and your chef may even give you left over extras after serving your table. I loved the sauces for dipping, particularly the brown colored sauce- very strong flavor...if you go for strong flavors.

I stayed at Westgate Hotel for the week and  that weekend too so I had several trips there just to order a to-go sorbet, I'm sure they thought this a bit weird, but I can not deny the desire of my taste buds!

There have been some changes to Benihana's since the last time I was here.  Nothing appeared new, it just looked further tucked in the back.  Anyhow, it took nearly 30 minutes to self-park with my date on Valentine's day.  We then got to walk completely across the property to get to the restaurant.  Talk about setting the mood.  Our waitress comes to the table speaking a broken English and was very hard to understand.  The waitress had about zero personality and explained how everything you wanted to substitute on your meal was going to cost extra.(brown rice $3, fried rice $6, extra plate $10).  We were with a group of 8 others so she proceeded to tell each and every one of us the same exact thing(everyone but me wanted the fried rice).  I went for the brown rice so that's more as well.  Not quite sure why.   It seemed like we were waiting about 30 minutes at the table before the chef came over.   He was pleasant enough especially after being conditioned to the shortness from our waitress.  We asked for no onions which didn't seem to translate to the vegetable portion of our meals but they were big enough to pick out.  The food tasted good however they should trim the fat from the premium cuts a little better.  They use a lot of butter in their food preparation as well, so plan on a bit of a stomach ache if you aren't used to that much fat.  The bill was $120 for the two of us with each of us having one alcoholic drink.  For our convenience, the smug waitress added 20% tip to our bill as we were part of a 10 person party.  This policy is the obvious reason for our poor service by our waitress who was guaranteed 20% regardless of her performance.  It's a shame that Benihana corporation lets this sort of thing go on.

The chef never changes those steel spatulas, so during the chicken fried rice cooking process, he cuts the raw chicken up on the grill and then leaves it there and then immediately heads over to the rice and stirs it up with those same thongs. He goes back and forth between raw and rice and even gets those things into some veggies. So in theory, all of the chicken fried rice should be poisoned and yet somehow I have never gotten sick. For years, we are taught to keep the raw and everything else separate. We finally found the exception. OH yeah, this was a free birthday meal. Go to Benihana website and join free birthday club.

plus. it really bothers me when people say they *love* sushi and then order a bunch of cream cheese filled crap (with a pink ""martini"" on the side).
however, im not adventurous enough to just order the more traditional stuff because i have no idea what it is, how it tastes or what i would even like. however, when my boss wanted to stop for some on the way back to an event, i trusted his taste (and was not starving) so i told him to order whatever he liked and i would try anything at least once.

we trried ahi, yellowtail and salmon. i was stoked to see they came out as simply cuts of raw fish - no cream chesse in sight. and was even more stoked that i liked it!

We loved the interior design, it was all very clean and you really feel like youre in Japan!

This was our first time so I'll explain how it works, you sit at a table with the grill built in, theres 8 seats in total, so if you less than 8 in your party you will be sharing the table with strangers. That can be make or break for your experience right there, if the people at your table are rude that will totally suck. Our table group wasn't lively at all, so it was kinda a downer but no the fault of Benihana. You order your food and appetizers from your waiter, all entrees are cooked to order right in front of you. It takes a good amount of time from ordering to actually eating so be prepared for that. We had Mike as our chef and he was really awesome. They make jokes and do tons of tricks. The average plate is between $25-$50. So you can leave spending only around $70 if you want. 

Our waiter was really good to until the end of the night,as you eat you food the other partys finish and pay, and if they don't get dessert you'll be the last ones there.

We came here for a post-SEMA dinner and I was with a bunch of friends from Los Angeles. I've never been to this location, which is inside the Westgate Hotel. The moment I walked in, I was amazed how fancy and huge this place was! A two-story Benihana? Crazy. And the decor was very nice. Little asian bridges, and everything. I was thinking, this must be the biggest Benihana ever, and sure enough, the hostess mentioned that this is, in fact, the largest one in the world.
Not only did I think this location was visually impressive, I truly believe that the cooks here were a notch above other locations I've visited. These guys were on their game. They were moving faster, swinging their tools like ninjas, and I had a good time watching the preparation, even though I knew what to expect. And of course the food was excellent.
My only complaint was that it took forever to get started with our meal for some reason. The soup and salad portion of our meal lasted so long before our chef came out and started with the main course. Oh, and another very minor complaint...  the crew didn't sing happy birthday to one of our group members when they brought out the birthday ice cream scoop. Otherwise, fantastic. If you can, you should try this place once. 
Just one point... even though this is a Japanese-themed restaurant, that doesn't mean you should try to get cute and add -san to everyone's name unless you're speaking Japanese. For some reason, a lot of people were doing that when we went, and it was contagious. Drove me nuts.

My friend and I were seated on a Saturday evening with no reservations and no wait. The menu? Full of good choices. Then I see it. Singapore Sling, right on the drink menu. They made it the right way. Considering what is actually in a Singapore Sling, that is painfully uncommon. So even before the show and food, I'm already pleased.

I order the spicy chicken and much to my surprise, it is properly spicy. There's no overcompensating flavorless spice, nor is it a sauce that has a faint hint of heat. It was as spicy as it should be. It was a case of mass market appeal done right. If you're wondering about the soup and salad beforehand, I skipped the salad and the soup was pretty good but really just the standard for teppanyaki restaurants.

Like Jose G, I had the pleasure of Tuan as chef. He kept up a stream of wisecracks and terrible puns that had everyone chuckling through the performance. Definitely has the comedic chef routine down well and he read his audience just right.

So, the drink is five stars, the food is five stars, the chef is five stars, what could possibly be so tragic as to mar this otherwise amazing experience? Getting a drink refill was irritatingly difficult. Only halfway through the meal did I manage to catch the waitress. I say catch as she was clearly about to pass right on by. I wouldn't say she was unfriendly, just sadly inattentive.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll almost certainly drop by here again even if I don't stay at the LVH. I'll just have to be extra vigilant about getting that second drink before I'm halfway done. I wish I had the opportunity for a second try before giving this review, just in case it was one streak of bad luck. I hate to hold back a star for something that in the grand scheme of dinner is not a huge deal, but I just don't find nearly enough places that can serve a proper Singapore Sling and being deprived of such for so long instills me with a sense of saudade and woe.

Seriously though. Tuan rocked that grill. If you think I enjoy loquacious diatribes, you haven't seen my love for horrid puns. I don't know if Benihana actually earned the fifth star, but Tuan did and he works there so they can show it off too.",m2a1WvdBx9tCohxvhPaTyQ,1,0,5,obpVkZbJOMFn8AMsq5_iog

It's a little on the pricey side with the cheapest entree being around $30 but I feel like that price point is to be expected for a celebration-type event. If this type of food/experience is your thing, you really can't go wrong.",Spgm6HFWgc4YXJlbhg11Pg,1,0,4,xGRk_rzSZPqp_blOBIrL_g

The d√©cor is 5 stars alone.  It is simply breathtaking in here.  The waterfall, the two-story atmosphere, the feeling of being in a little Japanese village.  Superb.

I went here for my mom's birthday dinner last weekend.  My fianc√© and I were meeting up with them so I went to the podium and told them what the reservation should be under and the time.  It took 3 of them to search for several minutes before asking what the last name was.  I gave it, thinking it was odd to ask for that, and they said they didn't have a reservation but I could look around.  Uh, OK...

Mind you, my mother made a reservation several days ago.  Whatever.  They ended up being in the bar and then we checked in and waited to get sat, which was another several-minute process with several people.  Didn't know this was so intense.

Our chef, Tommy, was good.  Nice personality, chatty, funny.  The service was terrible, the food made my fianc√© and I sick for DAYS after (but at the time it was BARELY above-average tasting) and I probably would NOT go back for the outrageous prices alone.

Our teppanyaki chef was very funny and my nieces enjoyed the show. It always adds another element having dinner teppanyaki style. The food was good. I had the hibachi spicy chicken that was good. It not over spicy but had nice kick too it. I also had a spicy tuna roll start my meal. Good. Sushi Benihana mot one of those places would recommend but since there had sushi itch like why not.

They all had little train whistles our guy was so lazy he didn't even pull his out he just tapped his spatula on the grill and said Choo Choo.

Reservation highly recommended 

Food was fresh tasting. Cooked to perfection. Scallops, shrimp and lobster were mouthwatering in lemon and butter. It was cool to see all the food cooked right in front of you. 

Onion soup was simple and had delicious broth. The salad was also simple but the dressing was thick and tasty. A different variation on French onion.The chicken breast and filet mignon were great! I love my filet mignon medium rare and it couldn't have been anymore mouthwatering. Melt in your mouth. Perfect portions. You won't over eat.

Definitely love the decorations. There was a water feature but don't remember if it was a waterfall.  Also don't remember if there were koi fish but it really felt like there should be.

The dining experience was pretty cool, fun and entertaining. Went with the Teriyaki Steak Teppanyaki.  It comes with everything you need.  Started with a bowl of Benihana onion soup, it wasn't that bad but I was very hungry and savoring every bite of it. Next came the Benihana salad, it had a good taste but became watery towards the end of eating.  

Once the chef came out I was happy because now the real food came out. He started with laying some zucchini and onions on the cooking area. When he starting building the onion volcano, it had my full attention.  When it was lit a small flame and smoke started, I thought ""boo. that was it"" but all of a sudden eruption ""kilauea!!!"" the table was engulfed with smoke.

Next he started making some shrimp apps showing off his lightning fast knife skills.  I almost cleared my plate as fast as he made them.  His flipping skill might need a little work.  He dropped the lime twice and missed his hat while tossing the shrimp ends away but still cool. 

He then started making my Teriyaki Steak dish.  By that time I already forgot what I ordered.  There was steak and chicken cooking. Once he dropped the steak into my plate I started to eat.  Later he added mushrooms ""sweet it comes with mushrooms too"".  I then stopped and waited to see what else I was getting. Nothing else just the bowl of steam rice.

But as an avid fan of Japanese food (and being Japanese myself) Benihana's just isn't very good. 

We booked a reservation for 4 at 9:30pm Saturday night and waited near the koi pond for about 15 minutes to be seated. Due to the amount of Hibachi grills shoved into a single room it was impossible for the 4 of us to talk to each other because it was so loud. Once we ordered I was shocked fried rice was extra but ordered it anyways as white rice with Teppanyaki is boring. 

Order and review of food appearance: 

1. Soup - I really enjoy the onion soup so to start the meal with it was great!
2. Salad - This was ultimately iceburg lettuce with a bland ginger salad with an awkward texture
-Chef began cooking-
3. Shrimp, veggies, fried rice, steak, mushrooms - they were all flavored with their ""garlic butter"" and it was BLAND. Although the meal was served with dipping sauces, it shouldn't rely on the sauces to make the meal, just enhance it. I was highly disappointed in the lack of flavors for the price of this joint.

This is the most luxurious location I have ever been to. They are boasted as the largest Bennie's in the world and designed to replicate a small indoor village! They have 2 stories, fitted with separate ""chef's table"" dining rooms and also lounges with access to gorgeous views of custom rooftops on faux buildings. Upon leaving the dining rooms, you're immersed in an indoor Japanese garden; the entire space is adorned with a variety of eye-catching props such as: dangling red lanterns, shutters, bridges and my favorite LED fireworks dancing on the backsplash of the town. They even go as far as incorporating a dramatic waterfall and a rock garden creek. It's truly a random casino getaway. So peaceful!

Alright, I'm going to go ahead and say it - I like Benihana's and I'm not embarrassed about it! I actually enjoy dining at the clich√© ""chef's table"" and the food isn't as terrible as most people make it out to be! Granted, you have to know what to order and stick to it! Once you venture off to uncharted menu territory - you're on your own bland journey.

I'll give you tips based on trial and error: Stick to the steaks (New York or filet mignon) and the colossal shrimp is always winning! I always order the Splash & Meadow combo $39.50, it comes with a small grilled shrimp appetizer and also a small side of grilled sweet onion & zucchini. The combo also comes with a side salad with house miso dressing and an onion broth soup that is cooked for 6 hours - Intense! Make sure to get your steak medium, since it tends to come out well - but if you like your meat bloody like I do, ask for it rare and it will get to you medium (there's a small percentage of it actually getting to you rare.) *shrugs* - don't forget to add a chicken & egg fried rice for $6. The fried rice is super simple but the garlic butter they use could make a boot taste amazing - I love the fried rice! $6 is expensive for a small bowl, but it makes me happy! If you're ballsy, demand that the chef add more butter! I'm sure the rest of the table won't mind. More is more!

Don't bother with the hibachi chicken combos or sushi! I've had both and they are extremely disappointing. The spicy chicken hibachi combo for $25.95 looked pretty good, but the spicy sauce is bland and the chicken is somehow always overcooked to smithereens and dry as cardboard. The sushi is lacking thought; I recall the rolls having lots of rice and being horribly dry!

If you like it saucy like I do, make sure to get extra miso salad dressing on the side and use that as a dip for your steak and shrimp - delicious! It's so much better than their other 2 standard dipping sauces. Also for the spice advocates, ask for a side of the diablo sauce which is their house spicy mayo with a real kick! I love dabbing a little bit on my protein, it wakes up all of the flavors wonderfully!

They will forever do the same onion volcano, train, shrimp and heart fried rice trick; true, the hibachi show may be played out, but I always get a kick out of it and think about Chris Farley as a Hibachi Chef in Beverly Hills Ninja! Freaking hilarious! THE BEST MOVIE SCENE ever!

Sure, the chef's table is always crammed and it's totally awkward sitting with a table full of strangers - but it's Vegas! Why not spark conversation with people from all around the world - don't be shy! It's fun learning about where people are from, their Vegas itinerary, and also partaking in other bizarre topics of discussion. Don't be that guy whose face planted in his (delicious) fried rice and not a smile to be seen even when everyone is having fun and engaging him! Yeah. That guy? He's having a terrible time AND he sucks.

PRO TIP: sign up for their email club to get your $30 birthday credit! Not to sound like a cheapo or anything, but that's the only way to dine here! It also comes with a complimentary birthday ice-cream and if you're lucky, maybe even a cringing birthday song dedicated to you from your table companions!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,72,70,4,qcZ1NWTqMvX68QExuHUeMw

The food.... MEH..... little to no flavors. He did salt , pepper, soy everything, just bland... onions were great, who doesn't appreciate grilled onions or mushrooms? I had the hibachi steak. Cooked correctly, but unfortunately bland. This dish comes with shrimp, which is only half deveined= nothing on the top but a big ole vein of special shrimp surprise on the under.... ew.
I gave this place a three for ambiance, theatrics and quality service. If it were rated on food alone, one and a half or a two at the most.They are very pricey for the quantity and quality of the food . My companion ordered the fried rice, for which they charge 5.99 . It was a small bowl and not at all worth the cost. Stingy there too.  I ordered a green tea, the ice tasted as if some one working a grill had handled it to put in my glass. It was gross. I didn't say anything, just ordered a sprite---- no ice...LOL. Waitress was nice. Gave me an extra set of chopsticks to take home. Keep in mind, they seat you family style so you sit with strangers.

Our reservations were for 7pm but had to wait to have enough people to fill the table.  We were finally seated at 7:30pm.  The hostess was friendly, quick and very attentive.  She took our drink orders immediately and throughout our dinner, we never had to ask to have a refill, she just seemed to be there as soon as we needed another drink. The meal, as usual was delicious, but the highlight of the evening was our Japanese Chef, ""Antonio"". He was friendly, witty, funny, and very charming.  He did all the usual tricks, the volcano, the egg roll but the best was when he threw an egg in the air and it landed on his knife, split with no mess!!  The food was tasty, cooked well and plentiful.  The evening would have been a 5 star had it not been for the picture takers, there were 2, one very brassy and loud older woman, who is the Saleswoman, and the young brunette who actually takes the pictures.  We had barely been seated, when in they come, and they really hate to take no for answer!  When we explained we were locals and came often to the restaurant, the brassy one said to the young one,Well, we won't make money off of them.  The other 2 couples also felt that the older woman just didn't quit.  So ok, one couple decided to take their pictures, and right when the Chef is bringing in his cart,  brassy woman comes in again, giving her pitch for one picture $25, 2 pictures $40.  Of course, we all had to wait while the couple looked over the pictures in order to select the one they liked.  How about the picture taker stay outside the restaurant, since the pictures did not show the restaurant background anyway.

I love the scenic walk to the table with waterfalls, red bridges and flowers brought a serenity to my mind. The scents however, brought an aching in my stomach for seafood, fried rice and green tea ice cream. However, since I'm gluten-free, I knew that I would be limited to what food I could eat, just like every time I have been to Benihana in the past. This time, the magical waitress put a smile on my face that did not leave throughout the entire meal.

Benihana has finally gone gluten-free! Not only have they gone GF, but they have also trained their chefs how to avoid cross-contamination! JOY TO THE WORLD! For the first time in YEARS I finally had zucchini and onions with GF Tamari soy sauce, chicken fried rice with a steak and shrimp dinner. I had a salad without dressing (both of them have soy sauce) and no soup, but hey, I was OVERJOYED to FINALLY eat a traditional Benihana meal!

Not only was the food exactly how I remembered from before I was gluten-free, but the show the chef put on was great and the service was PERFECT. Our server was friendly, understood my allergy, was cautious, educative and such a good advocate for me. 

The food was exactly the same as it is in other states. Even though it is nothing out of this world that will change your life forever, it is a good meal with a fun show, some laughter and plenty of hot sake keeping piping hot on the table griddle in front of you. All around it is always a good time.

The hotel where it is located is no longer the Las Vegas ""Hilton.""  Today, the letters LVH now stand for the Las Vegas ""Hotel.""  But, this elegant and happy eating place is still there, and the food is still terrific.

But, every great place sometimes has a ""negative,"" or two...

For example, one gets used to seeing a friendly, smiling Japanese male coming to your table, bowing deeply and speaking to you with a delightful, ""broken English"" Japanese accent (even if it is an ""act"").

Those days are gone, unfortunately, because Equal Employment Opportunity Laws in the USA mandate that ANYONE can cook your meal for you at your table, as I discovered when a non-Japanese person arrived with our food, a few years ago.

Personally, I don't really care about the gender and/or the race of the person cooking our food, but having a non-Japanese performing that task (and he did it FLAWLESSLY, by the way) is akin to having a non-Vulcan as a Science Officer aboard the USS Enterprise.

It's like meeting TARZAN in person, and discovering that he's not wearing a loincloth.

But, that aside, I urge you to patronize Benihana as often as you can, because the food really is meticulously prepared, and the staff are most cordial and professional.  I have no hesitation about recommending them, and I enjoy their cuisine, whenever possible.

The fact that my wife and I share very close birthdays brought us to the Vegas Benihana. They gave us a $30 credit EACH. $60 bucks! I have enjoyed my experiences in the past so I figured, how bad could a Benihana be? Especially with a $60 credit! 

This location is the nicest I have seen. Gorgeous. Trees, waterfalls, elevators....When we checked in at the front desk, they took a birthday photo of us. I thought, oh here it comes, they will want $20 for the picture. Nope! They handed us a free birthday photo! How cool is that! I also expected the food pricing to be higher than any other Benihana as stated in other reviews. It was not. 

This is NOT an inexpensive place and some would say you are being over charged, but it is a Benihana. You are paying MORE for the experience of knives and food flying dangerously close to your face. 

I had 2 drinks and the wife had one. We had the Teriyaki steak and the Filet Mignon. The cost was less than I have spent at most steakhouses. ESPECIALLY with the $60 credit! (THANK YOU BENIHANA for the birthday gift! More than I can say for my buddy Bob. Wait, did I just say that? Sorry Bob, I am kidding)

Look, this place is a Benihana. No more, no less. All the negative reviews seem strange to me. Not sure what they were expecting. Every single cook was actually Japanese! Felt very authentic. Super friendly staff and very attentive. If you are on the fence, don't be. Just go with friends and have a good time. They have $8.95 drinks! Go most places and you are lucky to pay less than $12! 

The only real negative is the seating arrangement. Unless you go with a group of friends that fill up the seats, they seat you with strangers. Kinda like a Club Med Benihana experience. Cool for Club Med, not cool for dinner in Vegas unless you are in that type of ""wanna meet new people"" mood. I was not.",MNeRZjw3NoJlCavv7SatzQ,4,1,4,iXLBOO0VSXtPztSWYLQ9dw

The waitress was very attentive, and the chef was your typical hibachi chef, with the same ""volcano, choo choo train, and egg flying tricks"".

He went to the back and brought out more fried rice for them, and get this...... it had chicken. 

The reason why I left out a star was because while the food was excellent, the portion sizes were way smaller than your typical Japanese steak house and the prices were a lot higher.

No one in their right mind would ever come here for ""authentic Japanese cuisine"" but like any cheesy reality show, it's all about the experience. It is alive and well for the now Las Vegas Hotel (formally HIlton) establishment, with full on displays of in your face cooking and awe-inspiring food play (#1). 

For those not in the know, Benihana is a chain of faux Japanese stirfry, where folks sit around a giant grill, where a chef cooks the meal in front of the guests, serving it fresh off the grill. Due to a height in popularity and a lack of Japanese US people, it's usually a non-Japanese person doing the cooking. One thing different about this Benihana is LVH's ability to slot in actual Japanese people or Asian actors with an impossibly good Japanese accent. Either way, it keeps the facade going and the customers happy. (#2)

From the tacky Japanese decor that makes me feel like I'm on a boat to the wait staff dressed in what appears to be uncomfortable kimonos, it baffles me how this is considered a ""fine dining"" restaurant for casino standards. The prices certainly match it, most of the hibachi grilled meats will run anyone from $23-32. Throw in seafood and the price nearly doubles. You know you're an expensive place when the cheapest thing offered on the menu are sushi rolls ($8-12), along with dessert.

The food isn't a total fail but it's far from a total win. Sadly overpriced, it's the reality of most casino establishments any way. When in Vegas, try to let someone who had a good day in the casino take the bill, or get it comp'd off. I think Benihana works best as a general group dining restaurant, one where the experience will likely trump the food.

Definitely fun because of the ""show"". Luckily, our chef had a personality and was chatting up a storm with us. But I can imagine how quiet dinner would have been if our chef was all show and no talk. He did a number of tricks throughout dinner. My favorite was the onion ring volcano.

The food itself was pretty good. First some a bowl of soup (simple but it had a good base), salad (too much dressing), then some shrimp for everyone. One side order of fried rice for two is a good amount to share if you're not trying to completely stuff your face. So the fried rice... Dang they put a lot of butter, but it's okay because it's ""Japanese butter"" so our chef said jokingly. I mean it was good but obviously that's the #1 thing everyone talks about from here and definitely overrated in my opinion.

We ordered Shrimp Tempura for the appetizer and for dinner, the Chicken & Shrimp plate and Steak & Shrimp plate.  Before our chef came out, we were served a mushroom soup and salad. We also received our shrimp tempura plate. 
For $12.95, you only get 3 pieces of shrimp and vegetables with it.

Kind of a joke with only 3 pieces of shrimp. Not worth $12.95, that's for sure. It was plain and the sauce was bland. The veggies were good, but it just wasn't what we ordered. A little misleading.

When our chef came out, he introduced himself. His name was Sheyan. He joked as he cooked. It made everything a good & fun show. He was very fast with his cuts, made everything look beautiful. He did the amazing fire volcano, the children at the table loved that....I can be a kid at times, so I loved it too. I had ordered my steak cooked meduim rare and he did great with that. The cut of steak was tender. Delicious. I got to try my husband's chicken and it was nice & juicy. Mine was juicy too, but I think it's harder to cook chicken and he did a great job keeping it moist.

We decided on Benihana for their fame of having an amazing teppanyaki experience. When we initially arrived to the restaurant it looked completely empty but don't let that fool you. Once we got inside we were directed to the elevator that took us to the second floor where they have several tables with many chiefs cooking all at the same time. One of my main complaints would have to be how hot it was. There are many chiefs cooking at the same time and the entire second floor was significantly warmer than the first floor of the restaurant. With the scorching heat of Vegas the last thing I need is to be uncomfortably hot while I eat. Also, this was not my first time having a teppanyaki style dinner and I was surprised with the lack of privacy. All the tables are relatively close and it was hard to focus one our chef while he was cooking in front of us while there was 2 chefs in front and to the side of our table being just as loud. 

Prior to your main course they serve you a salad and a mushroom soup. The salad had a really good tangy dressing but the soup tasted like salted water with a couple slices of mushrooms. As my main course I ordered chicken with fried rice. The chicken was really juicy and the fried rice was impressive as well. At the end of the meal they also give you hot tea. I only had a sip of the tea because I was so hot on the second floor. I didn't miss out on much because the tea was very diluted and the water tasted like it came from a faucet. 

When our dinner was over and we were handed to bill our server made sure that we understood that our bill did not already include the tip. I don't know about you but it bothers me when people make me feel obligated to tip. I usually tip well when warranted so I hate it when people make me feel obligated to tip when I am already going to tip you pretty well. 

Overall, I would probably never go back unless I had to.",NciZAStzBA8hWGuzd2RqZQ,0,0,3,f35Ju3ti1YAxXpskbFkcTQ

On Wednesday night, my dad took some of his customers out to eat here. It's 2 stories, and it's actually a VERY nice set up. Very Asian-esque, and..it was just really pretty. They have this ""firework"" show that they do as well. 

Anyway, I went to meet up with my dad with my sister and her bf, and they had a little patio outside from where my dad was sat. It was set up like it was outside. With birds chirping and all. It also had a cigarette stand with about 20 buds. You would think that you could smoke out there then....right?

So, my dad smoked. The manager came stomping in and said, ""NO SMOKING!!"" -_- DAFCK. Lol. Why are you going to have that in there with used cigs and say no smoking! They didn't know it was there. -_-_- 

Thursday night, since there's really nowhere else to eat, my dad took us out to eat here. The manager saw my dad and immediately say, ""Don't smoke in here again!"" Don't be rude about it brah. But, as the manager was seating us, he ended up being a super funny guy. He had jokes on him..I like dat. 

We ended up getting the same cook my dad had the night before, and he was AWESOME. His name is James, so if you guys ever go there..I hope you get him! He's so funny. Our waitress was named Mokoto, and she was the sweetest gal ever. Always so happy! 

The thing I liked most about this Benihana, is that everyone is mainly Japanese/Asian. It's way more authentic than the Torrance location, because everyone there..all the cooks are Hispanic. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it just doesn't feel authentic. At this location, it did. 

Since I've been here many times, I knew of the tricks he was going to do, but he changed it up on me! Made the whole grill light up with fiyahh! 

Also, they randomly comped us a round of free drinks for no reason. Possibly because we were speaking Japanese to them? Who knows.. 

We also ate here on Friday night, because it was going to be a free dinner. I'm seriously Benihana-ed out for a while LOL. James happened to be at the table behind us, and we were bummed that he couldn't cook for our table again that night. We took a picture with him though!

It's the largest in the world so that's pretty cool and it looks a little like the restaurant used in one of the fight sequences in Kill Bill. There are water features, bridges, tables everywhere it looked like a movie set. 

The place was empty, there were maybe 5 people in the downstairs dining area and upstairs there were a few full Teppan tables. We were shoved in a back table in a small room, we got there a little late so we were seated with the most boring people on the planet - and you know fun people are part of the experience of restaurants like this. 

It took a few minute to get our drink order and our food order then about 25 minutes go by - no salad, no soup but they sit another two people. Um ok, a little late to the game but whatever. Our soup comes out, the late people give their order, another 15 minutes go by and our salads come out. 30 more minutes go by and oh look our chef. Their timing was horrible, we were sat at 8:15 and our dinner wasn't completely served until 10:20. They were so slow that by the time my steak was served, everything was cold and I was no longer hungry. I've never had a Teppan dinner that was this slow and for the restaurant not being busy there really isn't an excuse for it. 

The steak was not good, I ordered it medium rare - it was gray/brown on the outside close to burnt and completely raw and bleeding in the center. Not exactly appetizing and not something I want to eat after waiting that long for my food. The fried rice was marginal, the veggies were ok and so was the shrimp. My husband got the spicy chicken and he loved it, maybe that's the key just stick to the chicken here and skip the steak. 

My advice is to stick your head in and walk around, then yelp Teppan and find a local spot to go.",BXUY0yIowGHpXbyqeVa76g,0,0,2,zRRYatqx3uXJcOGpugUvww
3795556,2013-04-16,2,TL5Dtfnf-5hYG13lBF9N2A,"Id like to be clear, Benihana in the LVH (formerly LV Hilton) is like an abusive husband and I am the abused wife who won't leave and will always make excuses for him. I've been coming here for at least 25 years and growing up in a place like Vegas its nice to have at least one place that I thought was cool as a kid that doesn't change. 
Before my pros and cons I'd like to voice 1 gripe, Benihana does a thing called chefs table where there is a 2 for 1 special each month. Ive ordered it here several times yet every once in a while the hostess or waitress will say they dont honor it here. I then go thru the uncomfortable exercise of explaining well I ordered it last time and it was no issue. Then after a ""talk with management"" I am fortunate enough to order the special the restaurant inundated me with emails about, gee Im honored!  Oh and EVERY time I have ordered the chef table special I have been told, ""its a small portion. .etc"". No problem I'll take my chances considering the last 5 times I noticed no difference in portion whatsoever. Im mean really Benihana LVH? You have to try and scam a couple extra bucks out of someone who has eaten at your store no less than 75 times??? In the meantime you do so by demeaning your own special!
Pros- the show, you either like it or you don't and it never gets old for me
Ambiance-  the Benihana Village to me is awesome and I could hang out in the faux Japanese village all night
Shrimp- my favorite, love the way its prepared
Selection- I don't go to other Beni's but I have been to several other tepanyaki places and none have the array of choices this place has
Kids menu- moderate prices and decent portions for the kiddos to make it not a special occasion only situation 



Cons, service-very hit and miss. This place gets busy and Im sure the location makes for some loud drunks as well but the servers make you well aware of this with the hurried attitude. Also the front desk guy who has been there forever is not a pleasant gent most of the time, smile dude!
Price compared to quality- look I love tge food and even I could tell you the prices are a good 35-50% higher than what I would consider fair. You want a good steak look elsewhere. 
Sushi-its just abysmal.  Really no excuse for this, I understand you don't go to Benihana for sushi but the village has a seperate sushi bar.
Getting seated next to uninterested diners- I get tense when the chef and his tricks are being ignored by a table full of texters, talkers etc. I realize this has nothing to do with the restaurant but its pretty rude not to at least pretend to be interested when an elderly Japanese man is making choo choo train whistle noises pushing a smoking onion around the table",bW2fmK-FnGDvAVQo-PH1Nw,0,0,3,8BG2tjnOVDkZbR_-eiftyA

It was the second best part of the meal. I got hibachi chicken it was plain and rubbery. Maybe I should have gone for the spicy. The sauces they give you...awful. They both were bitter. The waitress was on top of the drinks! The chefs always do tricks knives, banging, whistling, egg spinning, and catching a lemon in a fork. As luck would have it I got squirted right in eye with a flying drop of juice. This almost never happens. The chef was very concerned, it was an accident, they happen. Pass on the mandarin cheesecake.i was looking forward to it. Not great but I was so hungry because the food was sooo bland. I am not an adventurous eater I don't particularly like things that are overly spicy or flavorful so if I'm saying the food is bland you know it has virtually no taste. Also the location is very difficult to find it isn't clearly marked I walked right past it the first time and the Westgate really needs to have some better signage or directions.

I had Steak and Chicken which was bland. It was as if seasoning is a foreign concept. They were actually so bland that they were barely palatable. I ended up not eating most of it. Sooooooo disappointing at $40

My fianc√© had the seared ahi tuna which okay. Also no seasoning. Again, disappointing for the $40 price tag.

Now, on to the rest as this was a 6 course meal: 

Soup was DISGUSTING! I took one bite and pushed it away. It was like watered down beef broth with some green onion in it. Yuck!

Salad was a bowl of iceberg lettuce and some odd tasting ginger dressing. Really??

Plain white rice.

Veggies were good, but how do you mess up saut√©ed zucchini? 

Dessert was a scoop of ice cream. 

Decor and surroundings were lovely. The koi pond throughout a portion of the restaurant was very nice.

All in all this was a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY! We felt as though the soup, salad, dressing, veggies, rice and ice cream came from the .99cent store. 

The meats are clearly good quality but we both wished we had opted for teriyaki style so we could have had flavor. We expected MUCH MORE in the flavor department. Who eats meats without seasoning? They did provide a mustard sauce but ewwww. That is not an appetizing thought: mustard on your steak and chicken.  No thanks.

It's been years since I ate here and I decided to give it a go.  You need to like dining with strangers and meeting new people or go somewhere else.  There were four people from Eastern Washington State and two from Texas at our table besides this local.

We ordered different things, but the chef kept everything going well. A woman comes and takes your drink orders first.  After being served the drinks, she brings everyone a bowl of Benihana onion soup.  Then you get a Benihana salad.  Then the chef enters the picture by arriving at the table with his cart of food.  He starts by cooking some shrimp and flipping the tails onto his chef's hat.  He does some other tricks with his knives including the standard teppanyaki onion volcano tower which he then sets on fire.  I ordered the Teriyaki steak, extra rare.  He cooked it perfectly.  He was just as good with everyone else around the table for their preferences.

With the teppanyaki meal, everyone gets a shrimp appetizer, hibachi vegetables,  dipping sauces, steamed rice and hot green tea.  There is also dessert.  I got the green tea ice cream.  I also paid the premium to have chicken fried rice.

The next day we come again. This time at 9.

Rolling there eyes and treating us as if we did something wrong and giving MAJOR attitude!!!

And it turns out the only reason the chef came out was because the customer got tired of waiting and went and complained that he's been waiting for over an hour to eat. Our experience wasn't much better. The chef seemed to be drunk or high he kept sending food flying at us left and right then spilled this little girls drink all over her plate of food. He even openly in front of us said butter makes you horny. For all of you who have been to Benihana it know they use a lot of butter in there cooking.

My husband and I typically go to Benihana about once a year, in September, when I get my $30 birthday coupon (good only Monday-Thursday). You can sign up to receive your own birthday coupon here:

I find their prices to be on the high end for the quality of the food received, but with this discount it makes the final check far more reasonable. 

On our last visit, our waitress was a bit difficult to understand but our chef was fantastic. His banter was witty and did not come across as scripted. I ordered the Land & Sea (filet and scallops) which my husband went with the spicy hibachi chicken. 

Our chef was open to special requests (extra garlic butter on everything for one of the ladies seated at our table, extra lemon on the scallops for me) and cooked my filet to a perfect medium rare. He also ensured his was adding enough 'heat' to my husband's chicken, and asked him if he wanted more sauce after his meat was cooked. 

After our entree, we were offered hot tea and a green tea ice cream sundae was brought out to me, complete with whipped cream, a cherry, a piece of pocky and a candle.

I had JUST gotten MY food (I had well done steak so I got my food last) and employees KEPT coming by asking if I ""needed a box."" I was asked more than three times if I needed a box. It was obnoxious. Then one guy just brought a takeout box out and left it in front of me. I felt like crying. It made me so upset because I had literally gotten my food less than 2 minutes before. My food was still steaming hot and I had taken about 3 bites of food. I am not exaggerating!

Then, they came out with a birthday sundae for my husband WHEN WE BOTH STILL HAD MORE THAN HALF OUR FOOD ON OUR PLATES. His ice cream just sat on the table melting with no offer to replace it when we did finish eating nor any apologies. I was even MORE upset by that. His ice cream sundae turned into nothing but a bowl of melted ""soup"". We are NOT super slow eaters but since we were the last ones served at our table, we got screwed. It was unfair. 

The trick is to order seafood only because they cook and serve that first so you can start eating while they cook the other stuff for everybody else. They at least give you the check when you are done so the other two parties sitting with us were able to leave, and we were the last ones at the table. Call me crazy, but when I'm dropping $100 on a dinner for two, I expect to savor my meal and not be rushed out the door. 

The service made me NEVER want to go back there again.  

The food was good though! We had chicken, shrimp and steak. We ordered a side of scallops (they were delicious) to share. The dinner came with a tiny bit of shrimp as an appetizer, some onion broth soup, a little salad, vegetables (onions and zucchini), a cup of hot green tea, and a scoop of ice cream. Well, forget the ice cream, we were served it so early that it was melted. The portion sizes are on the small side so if you are a big eater, I'd recommend ordering a few sides or an additional appetizer. The ""show"" was fun as well. It's so cool to watch your meal prepared right in front of your eyes. Your experience will differ based on your tablemates but we luckily had a fun and chatty table. Not a place to go if you are shy (or a slow eater). 

My husband and I frequently entertain clients for work and based on this disastrous service, we will be crossing Benihana off both of our business and personal dining lists. It's a shame because it could've been such a fantastic experience.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,4,0,2,i5NZifsjR5OHuRBvuAwLpA

We were again rushed to close our check which was very annoying and disrespectful as a consumer. Again the whole process of waiting and getting our food took forever, estimated about 2 hours. What's disappointing is that not only did this happen in our hometown San Diego but again in Las Vegas.

The decor of this restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and inviting! As the conference was for photographers, we even heard several photographers comment, ""What a great place this would be for a photo shoot!"" The ambiance is exceptional! 

We chose to enjoy the teppanyaki for dinner. We were seated at one of the upstairs teppan tables. As the hostess brought the other patrons to join us, There were two gals who had never experienced teppanyaki before. My friend and I convinced them that it's fun and that they would enjoy the whole experience.

There were a total of 8 people at the table. The waitress expertly took all of our orders and promptly brought the soup, followed by the salad. Before too long, our charming chef arrived and reviewed everybody's orders with them personally, assuring of their order and how they wished to have their items prepared.

The friendly banter among all of us seated at the table grew as we all became comfortable with the others. It was quite enjoyable and there was fun laughter and chatter as our chef prepared our meals. 

Our chef was a genuine showman, as is to be expected at Benihana's and he did not disappoint. Not only were his ""moves"" expert, he also had just enough comedic character to enlist laughter from his diners.

The waitress continued to be expertly attentive, not leaving any single patron wanting for anything.

The food was better than good, everybody cleaned their plate without complaint and several exclamations of delight came from those at the table.

As the dinner time wound down, we all learned that one of our table-mates was celebrating his birthday. The waitress immediately jumped up to the plate, brought him ice cream with a candle and we all sang him a hearty Happy Birthday song! 

After the checks had been distributed and paid, our waitress had a little time available to stand and chat with us. We all remained at the table and talked with her, learning that she was soon to be married! As she was approaching her senior years in life, we all were exceptionally happy that she had found this new joy in her life and all wished her the very best.

All in all it was an exceptional evening of enjoyment and sharing among people who's paths happened to cross unexpectedly and with hosts/hostesses that facilitated a perfect celebratory dinner.

My wife and I use to come here every year for our Anniversary, but on our 6th year of coming here, we noticed they stopped the free photo for special occasions, so to us it was no biggie, but the we also noticed the service went down hill. 

       When we arrived on October, 27th, 2016, we sat with a group who all agreed that during the meal the chef was polite, but the waitress failed in every area possible. She only came to fill up drinks once not twice or rechecking everyone's drinks, but once. She picked up a few empty first course meal plates and bowls once, the rest were left in one side of the table. Sitting with people whom we did not know, all looked at other tables just to see if they too had issues and sure enough they too were wanting refills and plates removed from the table to make more room 

       Now when stating more room, I mean imagine 8 to 9 people at a table, but your kind of squished together and you literally only have, so much room to move empty plates and cups. Before leaving I spoke with the manager telling her that the service was poor, but the meal was great and all she said was sorry no refunds lol. I never asked for a refund, never asked for a discount, and never once did I raise my voice or yell I just simply explained how our night went with this place and it use to be great. 

      Every waitress is different, but overall I I experienced way better service and respect from a manager in other high end restaurants than this place. We decided to bring our business elsewhere. Specially after being polite and trying to explain how the service could of been better. I even observed others from our table and other tables in the room trying to get the attention of the waitress and or a manager and despite all they just want your money. 

       Many may not agree or agree with my opinion and that's fine, but I am being straight up and honest about what took place with our service and noting how the manager can careless about service and expectations. I get that each table has 8 to 9 people or more sitting and needs service as well, but when someone is paying over 160 for two people for the last 6 years at the same place and now you out of nowhere drop the respect and services, yeah elsewhere is where we will go.",Fr9OjCKLIKrV9zXoyrbSHg,2,1,2,ifzTrDoUjdnihoLQMixYBg
4231423,2017-05-23,0,TL5Dtfnf-5hYG13lBF9N2A,"It was my second time in Benihana at Westgate. One of our favorite menu for family night out is Teppanyaki. We usually go to Ohjah since it is near our house, and Geisha steakhouse as well. We had a late mother's day dinner here last Sunday, and left with no excitement at all. 

Our server, Roger, was wonderful with a great smile and customer service. There was nothing that disappointed us from his point. However, when you come to a Teppanyaki restaurant at a hotel-even though we know its just Westgate- or even Benihana-which they call themselves the Originals- you expect more than local hibachi grills. Our chef, Paul, definitely had no sense of humor during the entire dinner. Unlike the server words where he said, enjoy your dinner and show, there was no showmanship at all for our hibachi. It seemed like none of the hibachi chefs around us were doing such a thing called show except for one. Honestly speaking, show is the main reason people go to Teppanyaki instead of just paying the same price for a steak.

In sense of quality, the meat was definitely better than other restaurants. We got the Hibachi Supreme, which comes with fresh lobster and chateaubriand, land and sea-filet and scallops, prime NY, and just chateaubriand. The chateaus were fabulous, they were tender, lean and they almost melted in your mouth. NY was great as well, the filet was a little tougher compared to the other ones but still great. We asked the chef to put less salt in our part of the meat, but he did not take that into consideration and put same amount of salt for all table's meats, which was a bit too salty for us.

The one thing that this place sucks, is that they charge 8 dollars extra for you to get fried rice. That kind of takes aways the whole fun of hibachi. 

It was a good experience for us to compare different restaurants, but I hardly doubt I would bring anyone back here. You can get such a better show for hibachi at better prices, and get better steak at a nicer restaurant.",s01liMq8lG4G3f3AvJMi5w,0,0,3,aY3yIH3HQYtfi6Gfm1gnOw

And then a crazy amount for the fried rice which is the obviously the best. I have been to other Benihana's that included everything plus ice cream for way cheaper and tasted way better.

The only downside is that it is a little on expensive side, for what it is. But still every once in a while, it can't hurt. Don't forget to show your local NV ID for a discount.

I've not had teppanyaki/hibachi grilled meals in a long time, so I was looking forward to it. Located in the LVH, Benihana is in this little Asian-themed restaurant area. Decor is lovely and fitting.

We had 7:30 reservations but were about 5 minutes late. We were seated just in time, as the rest of the people around the hibachi had just ordered. Unfortunately, the photographer had already made her rounds at the table and skipped us! Boo.

I got Rocky's Choice (steak & chicken) and my friend had the Imperial Steak. The meal came with soup, salad, shrimp and some veggies (onions, zucchini). When ordering your meal, the waitress will ask if you want fried rice -- my opinion is NO. Don't get it. Not worth the upgrade price for a little bowl. In fact, I just made my own fried rice by tossing the veggies and shrimp together with the steamed rice that comes with the meal. Ok, so it's not really fried. But the rice was getting cold (it came out right after the salad).

As for the showmanship of the hibachi chef, he was meh. The onion volcano was nice. Maybe it was just an off day for him. He wasn't very engaging, in my opinion.

You start with some soup (that used to contain more mushrooms and onions). The broth is still good though. Next onto the same salad they've served forever: iceberg lettuce (meh) with a tasty ginger dressing.

Next, onto your ""appetizer"": zucchini, onions, shrimp -- all good, as are the dipping sauces. Then onto your main course. My favorite is the Chateaubriand. You also get some tasty mushrooms. Can't eat it all? Makes for damn good leftovers.

This particular Benihana though was surpisingly nice.  The decor was extremely nice with all the nice Japanese touches.  I'd recommend going here just to take a look and hang out in the lounge areas.

Teppanyaki is done on a grill which you sit about 8 people around each grill.  The seats are a bit crowded together so use the restrooms before you sit down.  The waitress will take your order which is usually beef, chicken and/or seafood combos.  After your typical soup and salad (which were decent but nothing special), the show begins.  The chef twirls and clashes his cooking utensils like a crazed knife-fighter.  The most common and popular trick seems to be the flaming volcano.  The cook reverse-stacks some onion rings to make a volcano shape in which he pours in some oil and lights the oil.  The flames shoot pretty high and after the oil is burned off, it continues to smoke for a long time.  Neat trick.  Food is usually cooked in this order: Veggies, Seafood, Meats.  (So if you are in a rush, order seafood only combos).  The quality of the food was decent, but nothing spectacular as one might expect.  The sauces were nothing special and didn't seem to really enhance the flavor of the meats and seafood.

So if you are looking for an entertaining dinner show while you are in Vegas, this is as good as any.  If you are looking for some really tasty food, I'd look elsewhere.  4 stars for the nice decor, 3 stars for the food.

Cooking up a storm, enjoy some of their drinks that come in a Buddha, geisha and other shapes.  Pretty neat.  Makes you want to keep going to see what figure is next. The chef takes your order and gets to cooking.  If you've never experienced this, I won't give anything away, but your eyebrows will be fine with all the heat.

Once the chef is done cooking, he disperses the food, for you to enjoy.  After all the ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" from the mini show, there is silence.  Everyone is enjoying their food.

I feel that when they complained, they should have asked the person causing a scene to leave. Instead, a hotel host went over to welcome him to the casino. I get it, that young flashy guy was a high roller. Oh well! then give him a private table away from society.

I hadn't had tepanyaki/hibachi in forever so when my birthday rolled around & I received a $30 birthday credit I knew where our next date night was going to be at haha I didn't think I had to make a reservation on a Monday night but I made one anyways and I'm glad I did because shortly after we were seated the place got packed! I really loved the ambience of the first floor, very zen... the second floor is where I think most of the hibachi takes place & it is hottttttttt! 
If you're going to do tepanyaki be aware that you are going to be sitting next to strangers and basically be sharing a meal with them, it's part of the experience so be friendly and have fun :) We were fortunate enough to sit with a fun group of fellow birthday folks so shout-out to them! LOL 
All of the servers here seemed to be older Japanese ladies so there is a little bit of a language barrier at times but be patient with them.. plus if you're nice she may show you a magic trick at the end of the meal! There is also a photographer who goes around taking professional pictures of guests~ 

The meals start out with the included onion soup & house salad which are both average at best, nothing special. Then the chef comes out and the real fun begins! Going into dinner I already knew that we would be paying more for the show than the actual food so I wasn't expecting much but I thought the food was still tasty!
*Hibachi Vegetables include zucchinis, onions & mushrooms~
*Shrimp Appetizer- if you're allergic then you are assed out.. They will grill the shrimp & shellfish last but you don't get any substitute.. However, your dinner date will get an extra serving of your shrimp :)
*Teriyaki steak ($29.95) - meat was actually very tender; if you don't like sweet things obviously don't get this..
*Hibachi Lemon Chicken ($25.95) - chicken breast with lemon lol I love lemon so I asked for extra lemon! yum!
*Hibachi Chicken Fried Rice ($5.95/pp) - I thought it was just ok.. very buttery! not worth $6! LOL and your meal comes with steamed rice so just save your money and stick with that!
*Dessert- Complimentary hot green tea to end the meal and we also got a complimentary ice cream treat for my birthday yay 
*Alcohol - we spent almost $40 on 2 Kirins and 2 small hot sakes :X ($9 each) & they don't have large hot sakes :( Next time I think we will just share a Scorpion Bowl ""the 60oz crowd pleaser"" for $25    

Our chef, Tuan, was really entertaining and we found him to be very funny but I could see how some people might not find his jokes funny.. But they should get the sticks out of their butts then ;ppp Don't forget to tip your chef when he is done~

When the bill came we had $30 taken off but an 18% auto grat in its place (I guess I didn't read the fine print? lol) so the total came up to $100 + the $10 we gave to Tuan... $110, so it wasn't a super cheap dinner.. Will I be back??? ehhhhhh I think it's more of a once every 3 years kind of thing but definitely something to experience if you haven't already!  

HOT TIP: Join the Chef's Table to get $30 off on your birthday

4940635,2013-07-12,0,TL5Dtfnf-5hYG13lBF9N2A,"Let me begin with the fact that I am no stranger to Benihana. I grew up coming to this chain for all my special occasions. Especially since my husband is a picky eater and this is one of the select places he will dine. 

This was my first time going to the one in Las Vegas though. It's so beautiful. They stay very true to form with their employees. Problem is most of them hardly speak any English. I was used to one overrun with Hispanic chefs. At this location everyone appeared Asian but many didn't speak any English that I could understand. They were all friendly enough though and the d√©cor is gorgeous.

Our chef this time did a decent amount of tricks but I saw some photos that my friends who went a week or so ago had and they got way cooler tricks. Maybe our chef was new? I had two kids at the table so I really would've preferred some cool stuff. He didn't even try to get the shrimp to be caught in anyones mouth.

My biggest pet peeve though and reason for not giving 5 stars is the fried rice was TERRIBLE . Its my favorite part of benihana and he made it dried out with like no flavor. I felt like I could've gotten better at Panda express. That's saying something FOR SURE :/ Plus we asked for our meat to be cooked Medium Well and Well done and both people that requested it had almost bleeding meat. Yet its Benihana and who wants to be the person at the table complaining about their food?

For $250.00 I feel like there are WAY better places to go to in Vegas. I am just sad since in my old home town this was our GO TO PLACE for awesome :/

I had the benihana special, which is steak and lobster.  The wife had the surf side, which is shrimp, scallops, and calamari.  These meals come with the traditional teppanyaki accompaniments you've seen at other restaurants:  onion soup, salad, tea, dessert.  You got a couple of shrimp for an appetizer, which was a nice touch.  Also, Benihana serves ice cream, which was also welcome.  The meals come with steamed rice, fried rice is an upcharge.

Overall, I was sated, but certainly wasn't blown away.  The shrimp and lobster were probably cooked the best of all of the meats.  Of the surf side, I liked the scallops best.  They retained the buttery texture that makes scallops so great, but weren't overcooked.  My steak was average, maybe a little below average.  I've certainly had better at other teppanyaki joints in town.  The fried rice was decent, but I wouldn't call it ""classic"" as the menu does.

Service was hit and miss.  Our server forgot a drink order once and failed to fill my wife's soft drink for several minutes.  But, she was friendly and apologetic.  The cook was great, he really played the role well and gave us a twist on the classic onion volcano I hadn't seen before.  He was funny and engaging; I think we got a good chef.

- I also love watching them prepare the food. Sitting there drooling over the food for a while as it's being prepared makes it taste that much better when it's finally ready. Not to mention that it's entertaining! Every time I've eaten there the chefs are fun, personable, and impressive.

When you enter, there is this dark ""garden"" they lead you through that is just beautiful. There is a lounge over looking it and there are seating areas and sushi bars around it but oddly none of it is being used..perhaps not on weekdays?. They lead us up an elevator to a teppan room that is pretty ordinary comparatively to the ambiance of downstairs so ambiance was a bit wasted. 

They start you off with getting you out a soup, a salad with ginger miso dressing. They hand you 2 different sauces (hot sauce on request), cook zucchini and onions, shrimp appetizer and seafood items, then fried rice (extra. steam rice is what comes with your food), meat entrees and the guy did some mushrooms.I had the scallops, calamari, shrimps and BF got shrimp and chicken. Our food was cooked nicely, but it wasn't particularly special. The sauces were just okay, they needed more punch, it's just a bit bland and runny. 

They have a efficient little planned out show and then the guy was gone. I was barely getting into our food and the guy just packed off and left. I was glancing at another table that just started their show and it was almost the same thing.  Service from the server helping the teppan guy was very personable and attentive though. Definitely top notch service and he even gave us some green tea ice cream and chatted with us a bit after dinner. I will give them that- excellent service. However, a bit sad that the server was more memorable than the teppan show! 

I can't help compare them to Musashi, a local teppan place I've had great experiences at over and over. There is so much more they offer there and that really overshadowed my experience at Benihana. The show is lengthier, a bit more complex tricks, the jokes and stories are fantastic and each teppan person has their own unique style, a bit cheaper in price with a really awesome fried rice included, soup, salad, veggies and plenty of different flavorful sauces freshly made in front of you. 

Glad I tried it, but will not be back. Even with the $30 birthday discount the bill was $70+ for two plus the tip. I went to Musashi a few months ago and spent $70 for two including a hefty tip! I had way more fun and better food.

 Um yeah. This feels like a no brainer to where I'll be going to the next time I want a teppan experience to bring visiting friends and family to.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,1,3,LLmvN5kGuw8tvemeHSGFlQ

The location itself is terrible. Inside the LVH (formerly the Hilton), a place that has absolutely no reason for anyone to visit other than possibly going to Benihana. I feel like they would do so much better if they moved to the strip. It's a pretty wild atmosphere when you walk in downstairs with a waterfall and everything.

Well I was either young and dumb or just starving for food and entertainment.
The only reason we decided to hit Benihana was that I had a birthday coupon for $30 off. Depending on what you get, its a free meal, so why not?
We got there when it opened so we got a seat quickly. The room filled up fast though, apparently there was a Physicians Assistant convention in the building. The entrance is beautiful, very serene.
Our waitress had a thick asian accent so it was difficult to understand her at times, but she was pleasant and efficient. Our chef was a little dry and boring, he seemed like he really didn't want to be there, it his first seating...he has a long night ahead of him!
Drinks were large and fruity, just the way I like em. The soup and salad were standard faire, veggies and shrimp appetizers were good, my husband hates seafood and ate 2 of them!
I got steak and chicken, my hubby got steak...the meat on both were a bit dry and bland, very under seasoned.
At the end of our meal a man at the end of the table began to have chest pains, unsure if it was indigestion or a heart attack. The waitress was quick to call for help, they provided him with a wheelchair and got him out of the room with paramedics on the way. I was impressed they dealt with everything so well. He was lucky he had a nurse (me) and a P.A. at his table, we were standing by ready to lend a hand.
After the commotion we were served our ice cream with a birthday candle, nice touch.

It also took her about 3/4of the meal to bring the hot sauce i requested with my appetizer. It felt odd giving her any tip at all with her bad attitude and piss poor service

Oh and the tuna was near flavorless, drown in what tasted like straight up vinegar and covered with soggy onion crisps and a few edamame beans. Gross. 

My date had tofu steak which was worse. It was undercooked, soggy, and flavorless as well. With as much butter they use you would think some flavor would even accidentally happen. No such luck. She requested noodles instead of rice which cost an additional $7 (ridiculous upcharge for butter noodles) and still that meal was borderline inedible.
Leftovers were okay because I know how to cook tofu and add spices to food to enhance flavor.

FULL REVIEW
If you want a positive experience here, start with the fish tank outside and enjoy the last living fish they have in it. If you want the full experience; just enjoy the ambiance, take a few pictures and go to a Brazilian steakhouse ouse or the Wynn buffet a block away for the price.

So let's dissect this beast of a rip off:
First off, the hotel is absolute garbage. The one time I made the mistake of booking here, they had to change my room three times due to AC problems. You would think it was admirable that they comped me a Buffet, however this was the result of the worse food poisoning I have ever had in my life. So that said, the is the legacy of this resort. Fremont offers better accommodations, and damn that's saying something already.

PROS
The servers were very nice and on point. The chef did his best to be funny but shouldn't take his focus off the cooking for a poorly articulated joke. When he asked how I wanted my steak, I said medium rare and the other two couples around us said well. Somehow he managed to serve mine last after setting them all down to cook at once... maybe he was trying to mask the flavor of the cheap meat (yes that's me being facetious).

CONS
The salad and soup starters are an absolute disgrace to the heritage. Two leafs of greens and a slice of mushroom in a tasteless broth. You can get better at 7/11 and save yourself $25 already.

The twin lobster tail; I am originally from Maine. $55? This was an absolute rip off. The tails are small, frozen, and the chef actually had the audacity to serve one and half! I couldn't believe it. SERIOUSLY! GO TO THE 99 CENT MARKET DOWN THE STREET AND HAND PICK THE BIGGEST LIVE LOBSTER YOU CAN FIND AND THEY WILL STEAM IT ON THE SPOT IN 15 MINS YOU HAVE REAL FOOD (that will run you about $25 total). You are welcome.

All the saut√©ed vegetables completely lacked in flavor. If you are here for flavorful quality food, you are in the wrong place. The chef was so busy making lame jokes - the food matched his humor well. At least he paired that well as a chef. I know it was all scripted and the point here is entertainment; but if you really think that's the only thing food service is about, you should invite chef Ramsey over.

The rice was an up-sell for fried... I had white and my girlfriend tried the fried. Honestly, blind taste, I couldn't tell the difference. My rice cooker is much better chef than everyone in that kitchen combined.

The only thing that made any sense was the sake (if you don't look at the price).

I do regular reviews for things that are amazing around Vegas. Though the resort already put a bad taste in my mouth and I walked in with a sense of skepticism, I was optimistic and chose this location over the one in Fashion Show Mall - I deeply regret paying to eat here. Taste wise, this was the most amature food I have ever paid for. I felt like I was playing with my niece in her play kitchen as she tossed two leafs of greens and a bouillon soup with a tiny mushroom floating in it. This place is a waste of time and money. They should turn it into a laser tag arena. It would suit the hotel perfectly. It's the equivalent of the Boulevard Mall with their little kid parks. Except it's classier there and the prices make sense.

For half the price, go to China Town. All you can eat sushi! Custom order anything you want straight from the chef. Honestly, I left Benihana's hungrier than I came. You would have to roll me out of Yama Sushi.",MkjBwkCSKXd85F5uUB-RJg,1,0,1,ceIIvmPMA60rP5gVuDB9Jw

Generally, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants. And Benihana is not an exception. Except for this Vegas location. And it's not because of the sushi and sake, which I find around average. But, the decor, the architecture, the ambiance- it's stunningly beautiful and aesthetically gratifying. Just an incredible place to have dinner.

Even one from last November!!  The teppanyaki show is great fun, of course.

Cute decor (if you like Disneyland versions of things)

Pretty unexciting showmanship and culinary skills from the teppanyaki chefs.

How about not flipping dead shrimp into the plates of vegetarians Benihana guy? 

The food was remarkably blah.  The salad - even the dressing is better at your local sushi joint.  The onion soup- yech. The steamed rice- pretty awful (and there is an art to rice that Benihana should have learned) and finally, if I myself took some chicken, sauteed it with butter and poured sesame seeds over the top it would taste MUCH better and cost WAY lest than the 49.50 that my client had to pay.

PS If someone doesn't eat red meat- can you please not put their chicken next to a bloody piece of steak cooking on the grill?  Could you perhaps use a different knife?  The whole thing was gross.

Sadly I think that the experience has been lost in translation and their sharp knife that was used to slice would-be competition is slowly dulling (pun intended). The teppan cooks we had tonight was ""ok"" . He did the standard flair tricks and jokes however quickly became flustered with the cooking and food management and that's where the entertainment portion ended. We were lucky, the group across from us were seated after us and their chef came and went before ours was done. We could hear them arguing with the manger about the quality of service, taste and a missed order. I don't know about the validity of their argument so I'll leave it at that. In my personal option, I think the level of expertise/standard of the teppan chef/entertainers have gone down. 

Another area for concern on this outing was our kimono dressed waitress, she was not friendly nor very customer service oriented. She forgot 2 of the tables drinks on the initial order and had to be flagged down constantly for refills. Each engagement with her felt like we were inconveniencing her versus being felt like a welcome guest. 
The last complaint about the staff was we were not thanked once after paying our bill or walking out of the dining area! Not the Japanese way!  

Other observations:
When the couple next to us asked for a take out box they were given Chinese take out boxes?!? I find this odd and at the same time insulting. This is supposed to be a Japanese dining experience not a Chinese one. I'm not racist (I am actually both Chinese and Japanese) but do not confuse the cultures! How do Chinese take out boxes play into an authentic Japanese dining experience? It doesn't! It may seem trivial but It tells you how they view leftovers and the food. You are paying $30-60 for a meal and by giving you a cheap Chinese take out box and LVH gift shop bag makes the restaurant look cheap and takes away from the experience.. Its the little things people...

We came here the evening before his birthday and they took our picture and printed it out for us as a birthday present. We were seated quickly and luckily the place was pretty busy for a Tuesday, so we didn't have to wait long to get the show on the road.

You can't find anything for less than $25 and most are around $40 if you want anything including steak. Fried rice is also extra. 

Our chef was friendly, but it's hard not to notice that pretty much everything he said was scripted. The chef behind him was about 15 minutes behind our table and I heard everything our chef said repeated by the other chef. It was still fun and entertaining, but I've seen better. The food was just ok as well. The steak was a little overcooked and underseasoned, but still tasty. My chicken was nice and spicy, which I enjoyed quite a bit. 

They brought out ice cream to everyone at our table, well everyone but me, since they forgot mine, but since I didn't really like the ice cream I tasted from my fella's dish, I didn't bother asking for one for myself.
