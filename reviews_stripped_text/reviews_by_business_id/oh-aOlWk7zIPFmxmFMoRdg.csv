However, now that I am in a city where you have to drive everywhere, I've decided to revisit fast food. Yes I've seen fast food nation. Yes I know that it's bad for you. But c'mon, it's convenient!

This review is primarily for the item that I have been consistently ordering here: the Cranberry apple walnut salad with bleu cheese (instead of the balsamic because, really, you can only be so healthy here). Let me preface this by saying that I love salads and I would happily eat a salad for every meal if I could. This salad is a must-have. Thank God I decided to come back to Carl's, because this salad is bomb-dot-com. Like seriously. It's savory, then sweet, crunchy and delicious. 

The place isn't too shabby either. It's clean and it feels fairly new. As a side, I forgot that when you order food they bring it to your table. Always keepin' it classy Carl. I can definitely appreciate that.",UZd_TFUcSgO0gRzLPZ8eIg,2,1,4,oG9RR-dxdxPJ9QPMe25roQ

You need to properly notify customers of this with better signage. Parking a vehicle in front of the window is not my idea of a large chain restaurant to show you're closed, because people still can pull up to order, which will have no responder, then as they pull around to the window to try to speak to someone a car will be blocking it, causing the customer to have to back out, which is somewhat difficult, especially when theres another car behind you about to go through the same ridiculous process.

i recently moved to the blue diamond area earlier this year. when this carls jr opened, it was definitely good news! you can only eat jack in the box, in n out and mcdonalds so many times!

my boss at my internship was talking about the new chicken strips @ carls, and i HAD to try them!!!! so - we went for dinner tonight. ordered the chicken strips, chili cheese fries, criss-cut fries and a few sodas. also wanted to order their banana chocolate chip shake, but the guy said they no longer have that item. why have the sign up then?! but, he did try to sell me on a chocolate malted something or other shake.

anyway, we get home, and everything was in the bag. the chicken tenders were pretty damn good! kinda remind me of chicken crispers from chilis, but the batter wasnt as fluffy. very flavorful and juicy. chili cheese fries were ok. a little greasy and a bit too much cheese (yes, i said it. too much cheese. i love cheese, but when theres more cheese than chili thats just weird to me).

I went in this morning and talked to Fe. She was awesome. She apologized again, got me the replacement items and even gave me a complimentary drink while I waited. 
The most important part of customer service, to me, is how an error is corrected when one is made. Lisa and Fe handled the situation perfectly. Thank you, ladies. I will definitely continue going to this location. :)",pmy2Y7CazBa3t_469KYAbw,0,0,5,aMaeFzzxm5osNtYx5tGvHQ

It's just slopped together and the service is even worse! John shouldn't be allowed to clean the floors much less at the drive thru window... He can't handle taking orders or getting them correct & forgets everything. No napkins or utensils & any condiments. Not even a greeting or thank you! 
I know it's just fast food and not brain surgery but... Wow!",-ZCGdGLtETgNEaOtqHQmSQ,0,0,2,JaJGbJhlQpXfaIOtpGFR2A

I am a fan of their burger menu. Ever since my first huge six dollar burger, I've been sold. Especially since I  am from Canada. 

I love their breakfast menu. Very affordable and tasty. The hashbrowns are awesome when they are fresh. Hot and crispy! Their zucchini is a must try item. Their fries are average. They need to up the ante on this one, fries are a staple and can make or break you. There are few places where you find yourself craving for their fries. 

I was especially excited about their Breakfast Burger! Beautiful concept! And it is delicious. Needed a bit of ketchup to balance the flavors. 

This location is my favorite.",f587WkOuLAotgXOVAybylA,0,0,4,TBd0B0xT8QJpI5uKTCqyHw

Work for 55 people  customer service and my girlfriend wanted me to stop to pick something up that would be easy But the same person a man was the person  who was at the drive thru  Ordered-a turkey burger which he informed they don't have anymore ok that I understand  I then ask for a grilled chicken to keep it healthy  he put down a bbq chicken I said no that he said all chicken has bbq on menu I questioned him so the chicken club  is bbq he said yes  but it took him 2 minutes to answer now I asked for the manager no response   I pulled up he was standing here like I was ok o called my gf  who has been sick and waiting to eat something with me This guy at 11pm on Tuesday the 27th ruined my day me and my girlfriend night. If u are going to hire somebody please teach them hod to answer. Questions when asked t would be embarrassed if I owned this location I have lots of people that live in by you  they will All hear about this  One employee. By the way he should be fired for lack of customer service and knowledge has made me vnever want to go to Carl's Jr. sgain,_ohfMxMkA3wVTmez71cPAA,0,0,1,fwukszUGuhNsIIE_22QDwQ
5726797,2016-05-31,0,oh-aOlWk7zIPFmxmFMoRdg,"I am updating my most recent review of this Carl's Jr.  I previously gave three stars due to slow service and lackluster fries.  Today I'm giving four stars.  I ordered my favorite El Diablo combo but chose jalapeño poppers instead of fries (they really need to work on the fries).  When a staff member brought me my meal, I noticed they had given me fries instead of the poppers. I pointed out the error and she said the order had fries listed but she would take it back.  While she was gone I took out the receipt and sure enough the cashier had forgotten to change the fries to poppers.  When the staff member returned she had replaced the fries with the poppers.  I asked her if I needed to go up and pay for the poppers since I had only been charged for the fries, but she gave me a sweet smile and said no, that the cashier had made a mistake and asked me to enjoy my meal.   This was totally unexpected and demonstrated true customer service.  This CJs has a great staff and I will continue to eat there. Kudos to the employees!",qFWwKwo3eLNWYKwXU_-WPQ,0,0,4,7SxKEnDLVGtmwEy8jqiA5Q
