I found myself ordering the a chicken sandwich. I asked the young lady how was chicken on the sandwich cut, she explained that it was chopped. When I was given my sandwich chopped was not the word. The chicken breast was chopped into big huge pieces which kept falling out of the sandwich. I believe it would have tasted better if they would chopped the mean up into bite size pieces if not shredded or a maybe even a chicken breast patty would have been better option. The sandwich ended up satisfying me for lunch. I would like to go back and try other menu items.",cbeWm8MMxapQHS9pJbp5-A,0,0,2,1diXGOWjY7fLy7-fb-AUjw

The meats and sauces are delicious while the sides are a bit lacking.  I don't think anyone can beat Big Ern's for BBQ Beans....

123255,2014-01-06,0,EcsUxHW1keLUl5w-3ZEbAw,I had brisket and hot links with baked potato casserole and friend okra for the sides and I loved every bite! It's difficult to find good bbq in Vegas and those places usually close down. I guess it's just not as popular out here. Being from Texas I'm very picky about bbq but I must say the brisket was tender and juicy and the hot links had a great spicy kick. The okra was fried perfectly and the baked potato casserole had a great flavor. The sweet tea and soft serve ice cream topped it off too. The staff here were all very friendly and made great suggestions too! I will definitely be back for more.,2yJerrXPMe4DjJjBzLInxA,0,0,4,KJBY_SC3UAQoDGYh13PJOQ

With the plate you get 2 sides (about the size of the small sides at KFC)and  a roll the was just ok. Slice of pickle and onions which I declined. Of each meat you get about 3.3 oz. I saw them weight it out. It's not much food for $13. My mom got the ribs and loved them. 
Service is a little slow but that might be because they just opened.
I will eat here again but I will just buy the meat and skip the plate. A pound of meat is $13. I think that is a better value.

745559,2014-05-17,1,EcsUxHW1keLUl5w-3ZEbAw,"Living in Vegas for 9 years we haven' t had many bad experiences in dining, but this, unfortunately, was one of them.  Here's how our experience started out. We were in line behind a couple who hadn't ordered yet and was waiting for the guy behind the counter to acknowledge them, once he did, he was nasty as all beat hell. Very poor attitude and acted like he was late for a cigarette break or needed a hit of something. The whole place seemed disorganized and none of the workers looked happy to be there, though the cashier was very polite and thanked us for stopping in.

 We debated about leaving but decided to see if he acted that way to us, he was a little bit less rude, but you could tell he hates his job..The couple in front of us? They walked out with him rolling his eyes.
 
  We went to order and upon ordering, we were told  that my first choice, ribs, they were out of , so then I ordered the Spicy Cheddar Sausage, yep, out of that too. My next was the Brisket, they were out of the sliced (which I wanted) and only had chopped. I went ahead and ordered that as a sandwich with two sides (mac & cheese & jalapeno beans). The mac and cheese was bland and the beans were the worst thing I have actually eaten other than a bar of soap. My wife lucked out as they they actually had  the item she wanted, a Pulled Pork Baked Potato. She  liked the pulled pork but it was cold as was the potato. My sandwich was ok . The best part of the meal was the crushed ice for our drinks.

 We will usually give an establishment a second chance but not this place. How could you be out of ribs, sliced brisket, spicy cheddar sausage, polish sausage, and chicken on a Friday evening at 5:45 pm? Quite a few customers came in to order, only to be greeted rudely, and told they were out of almost every meat on the board except for pulled pork, chopped brisket, and ham. Most of them walked out and the rude bundle of joy just rolled his eyes and smirked. Not a good representative of your business having this idiot being on the front-line greeting customers, he  obviously needs to be in the back of the house or better, sent back from whatever work release program he came from. The total of the bill for a brisket sandwich and loaded baked potato and 2 sides, plus two drinks was $26.00 or should I say, too much.

Once again, an establishment that has poor judgement in hiring this guy, being poorly managed by not having the product that people are patronizing your establishment for, will not have our business, ever.",Lnm4Jf67yBmTUwyWVqpbKw,3,0,1,sGlLCkhrOkLuTgitvVRxFg

Cindy said a bad attitude, she didn't have enough to feed us, and that she didn't have 3 lbs of anything. Its Friday night, we have a family of 6, and you all don't have enough to accommodate our order. The lack of customer service and the neglect to come to a resolution, is very upsetting. We came to this restaurant to celebrate our sons 12th birthday, and we politely decided to take our business else where.

My husband and I were greeted with a big hello and smile. When we informed them it was our first time.. He went to go get us some samples. We tried some delicious brisket ( top part a little fatty and very juicy bottom part much leaner but still juicy. We also sampled the spicy cheddar sausage.. It was okay not my favorite but my husband liked it. I decided on 2 meat combo with ribs and brisket( comes with choice of 2 sides and roll and onions and pickles. I chose Mac and cheese and fried okra. Mac and cheese was pretty good .. A little mushy but not bad. Okra was good .. Fried crisp and not greasy at all. My husband got the daily special which was pulled pork and sausage. He got fries and coleslaw for sides and enjoyed it all     I actually had leftovers on mine .. Didn't look like that much but the sides are large and was quite filling. All in all great value for the price and good customer service.

Mushy pasta with what tastes like canned cheese sauce. The bbq beans are good. 
I had the 3 meat plate. Pulled pork, chopped brisket and spicey cheddar smoked sausage. The sausage was great but I prefer a more pronounced smoke flavor on brisket and pulled pork. My sides were the onion tanglers(fried onions), delicious and the Mac n cheese :(
They offer 3 bby sauces. Regular, sweet, and spicey. Tasty. The sweet tea is particularly good. There's also a soft serve vanilla ice cream machine which is always a nice way to finish a meal.

Ribs were tasty fall off the bone meat and the bbq beans also tasty.  The brisket on the other hand was complete garbage.  I don't know if it was sitting in a holding bin all day, probably was, but it was aweful.  Dry as bone, no smoke ring or smoke taste and chewy as hell.  I have fed it to my dog over the last 2 days and she loved it.

Ribs good, brisket horrible.  Worse than horrible an offence to the word bbq brisket.  Hell a sandwich chain that rhymes with scharmbies has brisket that is 100% better than what I got.  I will never be back even though the ribs were good.",KlU35KQ1_D5XOhM7Yjjvdw,0,1,2,DRDysSVj8hoTmklBwWgZdA

Pulled pork was OK but was flavorless. The sauces didn't really help as they all tasted too vinegary and watery. Beef Brisket was probably 40% fat which turned me off. The Barbeque Beans though.

2084407,2015-09-24,4,EcsUxHW1keLUl5w-3ZEbAw,"If you are looking for good BBQ, look elsewhere. If you are looking for reheated meats and microwaved sides, keep reading. Obviously this place is a chain, but I didn't know this until I did some further research after eating here. This is a fast casual type of place, where you order and pay at the counter, then self serve drinks and condiments are around the corner. They have daily specials at $9.99 each. The special of the day (Friday) was pulled pork, 2 sides and a roll. I went with this deal, and also added a drink so my total was around $12. As soon as you tell the guys behind the counter what you want, they start preparing your food. The counter is super duper high, so you can't see what is going on while the food is being made. This bugs me a little bit, but it's not a deal breaker.

While my food was being prepared, I made my way around the corner to get my drink. Fountain sodas and sweet/unsweet tea was on tap. I chose the sweet tea and it tasted pretty un-sweetened to me. You could tell there was sugar in it, but if I am drinking sweet tea I want it to be SWEET. They give you a large souvenir cup that you can take home with you and reuse which is cool. Next to the drinks they have some vats of house made bbq sauces. Spicy, original and sweet, I got a cup of each.

I got back to work, and when I opened up the box of food excited to dig in, I was underwhelmed. Inside lay a pile of un-sauced pulled pork, 2 raw white onion slices and a few dill pickle chips. A white roll accompanied my 2 side dishes of jalapeno beans and mac and cheese. Let me just say that the beans tasted like Bush's from the can, and the mac and cheese tasted like Stouffers. The meat was not seasoned at all, there was no smoky flavor and I had to douse it in bbq sauce. I thought all the sauces tasted very similar. All in all, I can't see myself coming back here.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,7,3,2,znMNz4Wpu6rR8R_gwrYeXA

2332524,2014-01-09,0,EcsUxHW1keLUl5w-3ZEbAw,"Dickey's ending up being my new spot too try this week. It really close too my home past by it almost daily basis and always wondering about the food. More times then not the parking lot seems empty and keep thinking too myself how long will this place last. It been while since had some BBQ so just meant too be.

It was my first time not sure where I was going too attack the menu. Sandwich. Even if I wanted Ribs apparently they ran out that night. I found little odd cause came here for dinner around 6pm. Either there really good or make so much each day?? Any case not feeling like ribs but nice pulled pork sandwich. I ended up getting the Westerner Sandwich. It comes with two choices of meat. I was thrown for loop thinking more times then not sandwich is one kind of meat. So have few choices too choose from I went with the pulled pork and beef brisket. If you want can go double the same meat instead of mixing it up. I felt same as most reviewers beef brisket was dry side. The pulled pork I did enjoy! I felt pulled pork nice and moist combine with the BBQ had nice flavor. The sandwich needed more BBQ make up for the beef brisket but thankfully they have pot of BBQ on the side that you can add much as you please. Also the sandwich did come with slice of cheese (it made no sense that cheese never melted) and sliced raw onions (both things if want without can do). The bread for the sandwich was ok. I had much better at other BBQ restaurants. 

My sides (they have lot too choose from) went with the Mac and Cheese, second side jalapeno beans. The Mac and Cheese was ok. The pasta was cooked right on and nice cheddar flavor could have been creamer texture. The Jalapeno beans for me not work at all. The guy like it has nice kick too them. I could hardly taste the kick or see any diced jalapenos in the beans. Overall not much flavor in the beans. Both sides I liked the portion size not huge nor tiny but decent amount. 

The sweet tea was disappointing for me. I use too Raising Cane sweet tea here just not even come close. I felt like needed more sugar in it. They do offer both sweet and non sweet tea. 

The service was great! The guy at counter was very helpful being my first time. Not sure if manager but also came around asking all the guest checking up see if enjoy the food. Every staff member had smile on their faces and friendly. There wait staff you go up too the counter order and most part they put everything together then pay. 

Overall thought the Westerner was good sandwich. It was nice hearty, filling, and sides just ok. So much more better BBQ around Vegas. It not high on my list but since close too my house probably be back again.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,1,0,3,QRO51UpNIJH7uj9YkdoH_A

I got here on a weekday around 12:30 for lunch and it wasn't very packed at all. I placed my order, paid, got my drink and my food was ready before I even found a seat. Awesome! At the other location I've experienced longer wait times even though there are only a couple people in line, mix ups and sometimes even issues at the register. 

I went with a rib plate that included 2 sides and a roll for 13 bucks. The plate came with 5 ribs, which were good overall although some pieces were a little chewy. I got mac and cheese and a Caesar salad for my 2 sides. Their mac and cheese was very cheesy as usual which I love but the salad was a little overdressed for my taste. The roll was meh since it was just a roll and I didn't really bother to eat it. I'll be coming to this location more versus the old one because service here causes a lot less headaches. Their food isn't the best but it's probably one of the better fast food/chain BBQ joints around, especially in Vegas, and will fill you up quick for cheap.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,2,0,4,8r83Xm6uyjI7LyewoHmMPQ

2480086,2015-09-14,0,EcsUxHW1keLUl5w-3ZEbAw,"First off, the description on their website about the meat platters is not accurate for this particular location. This is not enough to quench a meat eater's craving as it falls a lot smaller in portion than what I was expecting. I ended up getting two orders of the 2 meat option (brisket & pulled pork) with fried onions and mac & cheese for carry out. What I ordered smelled amazing and the aroma got me so excited to dig into these two plastic wrapped bundles. 

However, to my shock, the meats and fried onions were disproportionate in serving. The brisket and pulled pork serving in one to-go container was smaller than the other, very annoying. Not to mention that their fried onions, the one thing that didn't seem pre-packaged, also came out disproportionate. 

I have no idea if this is just a ""to-go"" thing, but I'm willing to try ""dine-in"" options.",adu8EjLJ4UAVwZVHnXJzpA,1,0,3,XmyUj-yOOw6sBRmOcuZXiQ

2518130,2015-05-14,2,EcsUxHW1keLUl5w-3ZEbAw,"Dude. This place is HEAVENLY. 

Been here about four or five times with my girlfriend and we have never walked out disappointed, however we went last night around 8:30 and we were beyond satisfied...

Dickey's has daily specials - $9.99 each. Yesterdays was a pulled pork and spicy cheddar sausage sandwich and it came with two sides. I got the mac and cheese and waffle iron fries, my GF got the fried okra and jalapeno beans. If you've read my past reviews you know I'm stupidly lactose intolerant - yeah, no, I regret nothing because this mac and cheese was like a tiny orchestra playing O Fortuna in my mouth (Google it). Also, I tried fried okra for the first time here and let me wish every other establishment that gets blessed with my presence good luck because Dickey's set the okra bar PRI-TY high. The beans are always perfect; the fries are always a crispy gold. Ugh, delicious.

Not to be outdone by the food, Dickey's also offers a variety of self-serve BBQ sauces for those of you who are like me and like to DRENCH their food in sauce. Go big or go home, right? My favorite is the spicy flavor. In addition to the sauces, they have packaged ketchup which I always appreciate because it minimizes the amount of wasted product (plus I can take my unused ones home and stash in my ""unused condiments"" drawer for when the struggle is real). And instead of those ugly WHITE plastic utensils, you get pretty silver utensils for when you're feeling classy but need to be reminded that, hey, you're eating BBQ and are gonna get messy so don't take yourself so seriously.

Dickey's also offers pecan pie for purchase and self-serve ice cream cones FO FREE! The drinks come in these large plastic yellow souvenir cups that are absolutely perfect for traveling or drinks on the go. I think my GF and I have about six now. 

Okay - so I said last night I was beyond satisfied and believe it or not, it wasn't exactly because of the food. Again, if you've read my previous posts you'll know that I am a firm believer that no matter how good your food is it means nothing if your service sucks and if your service sucks I will not return. The service here is always great but last night the staff went beyond ANY customer service I've ever received. Every time we walk in we're immediately greeted. This time we were greeted by a young man named Dustin. I'm not sure how old Dustin is but obviously at least 16 (Dustin, if you're reading this and you're a lot older than 16, I'm sorry. I too get mistaken for a 16 year old and I'm 26. We'll be thankful for it later). Dustin had the manners that I hope my children have one day. It was ""ma'am"" this and ""sir"" that. He thanked us for coming in, he checked on us when we were eating. Rather than go up to ask for boxes, he came and brought some for us. My GF ended up tipping twice LOL. 

In addition to Dustin there was also another gentleman whose name I didn't get. He was working the grill and had the best attitude - very friendly, charismatic, patient. At one point during our meal another customer went to the counter and told them their rolls were hard and their pork was cold, then looked at his ""companion"" and asked ""any other complaints?"" Honestly a few other comments they made, made me realize these people were a bit obnoxious. Regardless I watched the staff apologize and remake their meal. After giving the couple their new food I continued watching the staff, waiting to see an eye-roll or look of frustration. Nope, I was wrong. They all just went back to doing their job and that impressed me. It was near closing time and it would've been easy to be a bit annoyed but they weren't - instead they made the customers happy because regardless of how wrong someone may be, the customer is ""always right."" Honestly I was beyond impressed. Thank you all for doing what you do and not only making the most amazing BBQ food but for providing the best customer service my girlfriend and I have ever received. We've been to a lot of restaurants, a lot of hotels, many businesses, etc., and this is the first time I was ever excited to write a review on a business based solely on the way they conducted themselves.

Okay, I'm getting all sentimental now.

The place is homey, clean and staff are very friendly. Ordering is simple too, there's a menu on the wall or if you can't see, there's also paper menus for you to look at.

My husband got the 2 meat platter and I got the 1 meat platter that comes with 2 sides each and a roll. I would say for the price, I think mine was 11.99 or 10.99, there could have been a little bit more meat. I picked chopped brisket with a side of fried okra and green beans and my husband got pulled pork and cheddar sausage with Mac and cheese and BBQ baked beans. 

The meats were nice, tender and moist with a good amount of smoked flavor but a tad bit lacking salt. There are also 3 different types of BBQ sauce that they have as well- original which is pretty good, sweet has a bit of a tang and spicy has crushed red peppers in them. I liked all 3 of the sauces! 

The fried okra has a nice crunch to it as well, the way fried okra should taste! The Mac and cheese was nice and saucy and the BBQ baked beans were delicious with a bit of a vinegar twist to it. The green beans tasted a bit off to me, I couldn't put my finger on it, but it wasn't my favorite. 

They are also famous for their big yellow cups as well that you can keep for a souvenir and once you're done eating, there is a free ice cream cone waiting for you as well! 

This wasn't my favorite choice for BBQ but I will come back to try other items on the menu to give another opinion!",rqb5abV146wcU-Z7JxfEIQ,4,3,3,91JU2Jt-5WtHFWwJL9MK-A

3029667,2014-01-16,1,EcsUxHW1keLUl5w-3ZEbAw,"I first tried them in McKinney TX and I was not a fan. 

It was like eating steamed meat with no flavor. I was a bit surprised actually as to why my Texas born bride was so excited to eat there?

Because of this new Las Vegas location, I like Dickey's. I live walking distance from a Famous Dave's, but it's nice to change it up sometimes. 

I've been to this location twice now and it was consistent. The staff is very accommodating and will fix any issues you may have if you just ask.  

The ordering process is a bit annoying, especially for short people. They have this castle like wall that you have to call out your order to the person behind it chopping up your meat selection. The menu is so high up that you will hurt your neck even if you can read it clearly. You then move down the line and call out your side dishes. You then get to the end, and have to tell the cashier what you ordered. If you are buying for a group of people, you might want to write it all down lest you make everyone in line wait longer. I'm not a fan of this system. It's backwards, UN-efficient, and mistakes can (and have) be(en) made. It is designed for one person at a time which must be hell when its busy.

The layout of the restaurant needs some rethinking. I haven't been here for a busy dinner, but not sure I would want to especially if I was in a wheel chair.

There is only one 4ft wide isle that gets you from the back to front of the restaurant. If you come with more than 4 people, you may not get to sit together because there is no room for joining tables.

Once you get your order and get your beverage, you have to cut through some tables and dodge around other people trying to do the same thing as you. 

Most of the needed space is being wasted by the enormous one-person-at-a-time backwards ordering line. They have these large connected pillars to indicate an ordering line that is about 5 feet in width. No one needs that much space to stand.

My suggestion would be to invest in a POS system with 2 order takers at the front of the line. The POS system will assign guests a ticket number, tell the meat cutters what to make, track all the data you can ever use and simplify the process of getting hot food out to hungry guests as fast as possible.

FOOD

The brisket can be hit or miss. It tends to dry out on your plate if you dilly dally with eating it. Pulled pork was as it should be. Turkey was really, really good. 

I've tried their bbq beans and mac n cheese which were very good. Cole slaw was forgettable, okra perfectly fried. The little roll they give you with the combos is soft and fresh and useful if you like building a BBQ slider at your table. 

They certainly know how BBQ properly at Dickey's, I only wish they seasoned their meat more. 

I shall return",lhPuskGXTRSjCwKOOOYeoA,1,1,3,UN3bXdjHRdrg0V07as5-PA

I know I'm going to get good BBQ in a clean restaurant, good bbq sauce, free ice cream, and excellent deep fried okra. Some of the other sides aren't spectacular, but they're all decent (except the green beans), and good for when I get a craving for smoked meat. I've been to 4 or 5 locations across the country, and I can say the same for all.

I didn't actually realize this location was here until today, from what the employee said they opened in October. The LV Blvd location is too far for me to go for weekday lunch break, but Spring Valley is perfect.

This location is bigger than the LV Blvd store, and the ice cream machine is easier to use, otherwise it's pretty standard. The ordering location is that weird tall wall like everywhere, not sure why it's so tall, I am 5'5 and can barely see who I'm talking to. When I go with my husband I always make him order for me.

To sum up: Good enough to go again, and a good location. Recommended.

PS, if you plan to be a repeat customer, don't forget to bring along your big yellow cup, drink prices are much cheaper (free sometimes) if you bring your cup.",tC5ra2SjMvYLZ1e1DPPHLg,1,0,4,o0R447ck5ZcJBcbZ1FKiNg

As a result, we drove out of our way to satisfy her desire to try these ribs. The service here is deli counter style. Bottom line, the ribs were excellent. They had great flavor and were fall off the bone tender. However, I was taken a back at their prices. $16 for a half rack and $29.99 for a full rack. This was for ribs only. Sides are 'a la carte. I for one did not think much of their sides. However, my wife liked the green beans with bacon. They do have a great daily lunch special with a pre determined entree by day of the week, side and beverage for $9.99. I took advantage of this special and on this day it was the pulled pork sandwich.  This sandwich was very good. I ordered the Mac and cheese with this special and it was lacking.

4049947,2014-10-24,0,EcsUxHW1keLUl5w-3ZEbAw,"I really want to like this place, but it has some flaws.  The smell of the meat cooking in smokers is overwhelmingly good and really makes you hungry.  I think if they could just improve the service the place would be better.

First of all the whole ordering thing is somewhat disturbing.  You stand in a line and tell some guy who is chopping the meat what you want for meat.  Then you stay in line and move on down to the next station where you tell them the sides.  I tried to tell the first guy my order and he almost bit my head off with a ""Tell that to her"".  Then you slide on down to the next station and wait in line to pay the money.  I was somewhat offended that you are talking to people working behind what seems like a wall that is almost 6' tall.  It's just plain weird.  This sort of concept might work if you had enough people working to handle the workload, but in this case the ordering and payment process took almost 10 solid minutes.  They need to rework this and have at least two registers, two people on meat, and two people on sides.  It also took 10 minutes more to actually get the food.  It was not that busy for the service to be this slow.  The people at the register seemed distracted and not fully engaged with the customers.

OK On to the food.  I ordered a daily special which on Friday is a Pulled Pork with two sides and a drink for about $8.99.    This is not a bad deal, but the regular prices are quite high in my opinion.  The pulled pork was tasty, but seemed a bit too mushy almost like they boiled it or added a bunch of water to it.  It's not quite the pulled pork that I expect.  The Mac&Cheese was quite good.  The potato salad was also pretty good.  I liked the sides better than the meal.  It also comes with a warm roll that I dipped in their BBQ sauce which was quite good.

Brisket - It's okay. Barely any smoke ring and no bark as they scrape it off. Pass if you want good brisket. Strike1

Ribs - The must of found the worst time to give me the part of the ribs that should be trimmed off before smoking as they will burn and be over done. Guess what burnt and over done. Strike 2 

Sausage -  Although Jalapeno Cheese sausage tasted best of the whole meal it's texture was a bit funky. Strike 3

Employees - These people had awful attitudes. Sorry that I bothered you by ordering food and trying to pay for it. The guy cutting the brisket was clueless. I asked for a certain cut and it was like he either didn't know what I was talking about or didn't care.

I've tried a few in Vegas and only like one other place in north Vegas (a small drive through place), but today we decided to try Dickie's for Mother's Day because my mom wanted ribs for lunch.

We almost decided to go to a chain place, but we knew it was going to be busy. I'm SO glad we decided instead to go here-- a small business, family friendly, clean, fast and super generous spot.

The employees were amazing! They were so nice, making recommendations, giving us honest opinions/samples about the food, and being very amenable when we changed an order. I sampled the potato salad and it was not very good. It tasted like it had sour cream in it. All 3 employees behind the counter were friendly and went out of their way to ensure we were satisfied. Plus, Sundays, kids eat free!

I paid about $40 for 3 adults and 2 kids. And we had plenty leftovers. The adults had the 3 meat combo and a rib plate. The baked potato casserole and fried okra sides were awesome. You could actually taste the okra. They weren't over fried and greasy. The fries also were nice--the oil for the fried stuff was not old or overwhelming. The bread rolls were a little too soft, maybe undercooked. But that was not a big deal.

 Even the kids apologized for thinking they weren't gonna like it. They both had the chicken nuggets and mac & cheese with a drink. For dessert, there's free soft serve ice cream. This place was almost perfect.

 The only thing I didn't like was a huge Ronald Reagan photo on the wall. I'm assuming with the owner. I'm not a republican and not a fan of this racist, classist president. Although all the workers were white and most of the patrons as well, they were all nice. So I hope Reagan is not representative of the politics or bias of the owner.

The beef brisket is moist and tender, I just wish it has bit smokier flavor. The ribs are tender, juicy, finger licking good. The spicy cheese sausage has a nice kick (although a bit greasy and not as smoky as I want).
SIDES:
The side are tried are: fried okra - delicious, crispy and not greasy, Mac and cheese (very good according to my daughter. Once more, she did not share), fried onion tanglers - cut small and flavorful, potato salad - has dill flavor which I like.

Ordering is a breeze. Staff are nice and helpful. Place is small but clean. Will be back.

Again with a condescending tone ""Don't you see the sign?"" She pointed up. I tilted my head all the way back and saw the order here sign about 3 feet above my head. I said ""I see it now. She said ""yeah just making sure"" raised her eyebrows gave a fake forced smile. It didn't feel good to be talked to like I was an idiot. I left immediately and will not be returning. The young blonde girl behind the counter cost this business years worth of my money. Maybe she has to say it all day long or perhaps she thinks that everyone should know that the sign is there because she knows it is. But I personally think that her remarks and attitude were unnecessary.  I also think the counter is extremely high to be an obvious place to put in an order.",_IxpA1gPqN8G3t0bFDaspA,2,0,1,6wCeNfGTXJXCEUxWBWhfkw

I've never been the biggest BBQ fan and by no means am I a BBQ expert (after all, I am from NYC... I know pizza and other things but not BBQ). I didn't know what to expect from Dickey's. Recent BBQ I've had elsewhere wasn't all that impressive to me and I found myself wishing I had something else instead.
The decor is cool and about what you would expect for a franchised (I think) joint. The service was a bit awkward and I felt like one of the guys working for sure was either pissed off or just did not want to be there. I don't think he smiled once the whole time. The other guys were ok and they lady at the register was very nice and friendly.
The counter where you place orders is really high which I can imagine is not customer friendly for those of you under 6 feet tall. For me it was a bit high and I'm 6'2"". The guy taking the order is also the one dishing out the meat which is a bit strange... almost like a BBQ version of Subway except you can't see everything going on. Not comparing the food to Subway... just the experience. Think they need to work on some things here. Maybe it was just because it was late? Not sure.
Anyway... to the food. 
The Westerner Sandwich - choose 2 meats - I ordered pulled pork and brisket - comes with onions, pickles and cheese. I didn't want this sandwich to end. Everything was delicious. I never really been fan of pickles on my sandwiches but I gave it a try and it was awesome. Meat was delicious and cooked perfect for my liking.
Giant Baker + Meat - texas chop brisket - with the works. This thing was GIGANTIC! KC thoroughly enjoyed it and has leftovers for lunch.... and dinner... and maybe another lunch.
Mac & Cheese - typical BBQ joint mac & cheese. Nothing fancy, just the basics.
Fried Onion Tanglers - basically skinny onion rings and a must side for BBQ for me. Threw some on my sandwich and I was golden.

Will be back. Hope they open more locations around Vegas. Guess I'm a fan of Texas style BBQ.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,0,0,4,jyKWse0m562n-L3Qp1fMaQ

My brother & I decided to do Thanksgiving w/ friends super last minute. Hash House a Go Go ran out of turkeys. WTF. So did Mimi's Cafe, Lucilles, and Famous Daves. Double WTF. I needed Thanksgiving to-go and only 2 days to do it! Dickey's had 2 turkey options for $49.99--Cajun Fried Turkey or Smoked Turkey. Of course, they were sold out of the fried turkey but they had 1 smoked turkey left. I called dibs!!!

The pick-up process was easy. Zipped in and out within 5 minutes. They're closed on Thanksgiving so pick-up needs to be the day before. They're open late so I picked up around 7pm. The turkey is wrapped in foil and comes in an oven-safe aluminum pan ready-to-heat. It takes about 2 hours for the turkey to reach eating temperature. Excellent packaging since my friend just moved to Vegas and has minimal bake/cookware available. I needed low maintenance food and Dickey's definitely made the holidays a bit easier for me.
 
The turkey itself was pretty tasty. I was a little concerned that the smoked turkey wouldn't have the Thanksgiving flavor I was looking for but it was delicious. Not the best I've ever had but very good. As much as I love cooking and being able to put all the flavors I want into things.

My 3 meats were pulled pork, beef brisket and turkey.  All of them were good with the brisket being best.  There have been a lot of complaints about the brisket in several reviews being cold or dry.  The lady in front of me ordered a pound of brisket but let it be known she worked for a well known publication in town and spoke with the manager on duty as well.  I think they brought out the most recently cooked brisket because of this.  Maybe everyone should do this to ensure the best quality meat?

The ribs sucked big time.  I am not sure if it was the quality of the meat, the preparation or all of the above but they were very disappointing.  I won't be ordering these again.  They advertise them as ""fall off the bone"" and it was anything but that.  Stay on the bone ribs?  

I also saw that Nadine K just posted a picture of her ribs from this location and mine did NOT look like that at all.  Her ribs look much better.  Maybe she works for Time magazine?  I would also avoid the green beans with bacon side since that was a watery mess with not so fresh beans.

I rank the chopped brisket the best of the three meats chosen followed by the pork ribs and the polish sausage rounding out the three based on flavor and overall texture.  The ribs were quite tender but could have used more meat surrounding the bone.  Chopped brisket was flavorful and somewhat tender.  All three meats went well with provided BBQ sauce.

Pulled pork was definitely moist but lacked any type of smoked or seasoning flavor. Brisket was a little dry and also lacked smoke taste but had appearance of dry rub. 
The sauces available were all very good in taste and certainly helped flavor the meet, however, I am always looking for the meat itself to taste flavor before adding sauce.
The soft serve ice cream was a nice little addition available if you choose.

Overall it was okay but definitely not in comparision to my experience at Dickey's in Dallas. TX.",fnrbFJ3P8bdFK7DMceZ7LQ,1,1,3,h8RPsJ-q2iq-5YMkqRPwfQ

Called at 820pm to place a pick up order (40minutes before closing) and told them I'd be there with in 5minutes as I was in my car driving there... well we close at 9 are you going to be here by then, I replied yes I'm on my way and it is a take out order I'm not coming to hang out....arriving at 830...she's still rude. I almost don't want to eat my food because the vibe she just gave me about. It being happy that I stopped in to pick up food??? I'm unhappy and wish I wouldn't have even ordered pick up food..I'll just stop somewhere else on my way home and grab something different. Never had a bad vibe from this place EVER. But this girl is just not happy with life. Ps. As I write this entire review..guess what you're still open another 15minutes!!! I hope someone else walks in to order right now.",oBtTr0JeYwQt5lWMM81Mzw,1,0,1,haUWjkGodrNugevmHbFVPg

5802103,2017-05-08,0,EcsUxHW1keLUl5w-3ZEbAw,"We were driving by and saw the place and decided to try it...great that it's a Sunday and kids eat free.  My ten year old was the only one that enjoyed her meal and it was free she had the chicken nuggets and she didn't even get her fries. My husband had the ribs it was cold and the sides were cold the baked potatoe casserole you know it's cold when  the cheese don't melt.  My other daughter and I had the $6.50 BBQ pork nachos....it was cold and the cheese didn't melt it just sat on top of the meat.  We barely ate it.

The good part was the manager came out and gave us different ribs that were still cold and the guy that cut it was not happy that he needed to cut us new ribs.  And she corrected that I was charged $9.99 for the nachos. The other thing was the ice cream my kids liked that.

So in other words we will not be returning.  It was a disaster and not worth the money.",RK6y75HQGNT_E_21Ou4eVA,1,0,1,LLsKRc904cSiS10IaLXCMQ

From green beans with bacon to loaded mash potato casserole to fried okra, it feels just like the southern food I grew up with in Tennessee. The spicy cheddar sausage and chopped beef brisket are both personal favorites! You shouldn't neglect their spicy barbecue sauce, and don't forget the free softserve ice cream cones!",riioc0xJzVmtklxPIQmMlw,0,0,5,AjWZiEn-s9-bUUKXQSKM9w

This location is close to home but I don't think we will be back after this first time bad visit.

I don't enjoy BBQ that is reheated and still not warm enough to enjoy. We both ordered a 3 meat meal, double order of brisket and pork rib. The brisket and rib was cold, dinner roll was hard and cold. My one side was even cold, macaroni and cheese. The baked beans were the only item I ate that was hot. 

My husband complained to me that his food was cold as well, we dined in so this is unacceptable.

We ate it, what could we do, walk our trays back up to the counter and ask the girls to heat it up after we already took a bite? It just was not something we wanted to have to do so we ate the cold BBQ food and left highly disappointed.

I may continue visiting the Las Vegas Blvd location once the bad taste of this location visit wears off in my mouth :/

Not a happy customer :(",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,7,4,1,9ILnKU19Prn0owb8PwBb8w
5882886,2018-03-16,0,EcsUxHW1keLUl5w-3ZEbAw,"Food is good but customer service is a bit awful. I asked if they had a location out in Tennessee because I haven't heard of Dickies in a while and wasn't sure if where I was was what I remember. The girl shrugs her shoulders in a ""don't know/don't give a shit"" way. There's ways to shrug your shoulders out of not knowing something and not look like a snooty bitch about it. 

I had to look it up myself. Typically, BBQ places have good service, but I guess this place has ""don't know/don't care"" attitude. 

I got the Westerner with Waffle fries and a coke with a side of jalapeños and their delicious sauces. Very awesome food",j7SH8LM1L8eExP2AO71UbA,0,0,3,-KajBgUAqc1qcavyQuiLYg
5959981,2015-05-31,10,EcsUxHW1keLUl5w-3ZEbAw,"This place isn't so bad if you arrive with low expectations. I had a coupon so we ended up picking two to go plates to take horn with us. 

My fella and I both chose the two meat combo. They have pretty limited selections of meats and from these choices I picked the spicy cheddar sausage and the pulled pork and the potato casserole and mac & cheese. 

We were in and out in no time and took our meals home to enjoy. The meat was dry, both moisture-wise and sauce-wise. They didn't put any BBQ sauce on any of the meats and they provided a very tiny portion in the takeout container. Luckily we had some of our own to douse the meat with. The sausage was spicy and tasty but nothing I couldn't have purchased in a prepackaged container from the grocery store. The pulled pork was decent but definitely needed more sauce. 

My two favorite things about Dickey's were the potato casserole which is essentially loaded mashed potatoes and the crushed ice from the drink machine. I don't think that's enough to draw me back without a coupon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,14,11,2,kZ7_JJiaKHSdVLMolVzpQw
