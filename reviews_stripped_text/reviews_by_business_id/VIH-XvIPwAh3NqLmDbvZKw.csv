The meat in the pho tai is a little weird and chewy, and the broth was a little bland and tasted off. But I couldn't complain because it was exactly what I expected and hit the spot for my noodle soup craving between blackjack hands. Goi cuon spring rolls were decent, and peanut sauce was tasty but watery. Server was very nice and attentive. 

Came out to about $40 for two of us for two bowls of pho and the spring rolls plus tax and tip. (My Vietnamese father would have disowned me if he knew I paid that much for crappy pho, but Vegas ain't cheap!)",0wArRCmvQKjwp2VDwR_a4g,0,0,3,Fx3XH4yxtoLLr3P6YS-Jvw

The food here is below average.  For a restaurant inside a Vegas Casino Resort (TI), you'd expect a much higher quality.  The Pho I got had the raw beef on top which is supposed to be cooked in the hot soup.  The soup however was lukewarm and did nothing to the uncooked beef.  I had to fish out almost half of the beef cause I did not dare eat it.  (Didn't want to get food poisoning while hitting the clubs later that night.)  Imagine the disaster that would cause while being shit faced drunk with severe food poisoning.  Which end will you point towards the toilet???

The Pho was double the price compared to restaurants in Chinatown, but I do not mind the price as it is expected to be high for being on the strip, but at least make an effort to cook the food right.  

Another complaint are the servers. They're nice and friendly, but so damn SLOW.  There is definitely a lack of communication between the staff.  We asked for chopsticks to go for our leftovers and was told to talk to the host at the front.  We walked out and asked the host, but the host said we are suppose to talk to the servers.  We spent 10 minutes going back and forth before someone finally came out with some chopsticks.

I really enjoyed my pho. For the first time in my life, I ordered the chicken pho (i am normally a steak/brisket lover) and I thought it was near-perfect.

Most important was the fish sauce which was also ok and a little too sweet/salty, a little off from generic Vietnamese restaurant. What can I say, this place wasn't an actual Vietnamese place so ill give them a benefit of the doubt. But to charge people double from what they could've brought elsewhere, I would expected them to hire an actual genuine Vietnamese cook or something, right. This dish which would usually cost about $6-7 cost us $15 here!

Next day we decided to order American instead. Sis craving a club sandwich. We thought, you really cant mess this one up right. Its just a sandwich. Again, it was ok. Turkey was a little dry, bacon was cold and the fries were a little bit cold and soggy too. Obviously this only means that nothing is really freshly made to order.

I ordered the Pho Dac Biet (Combination Pho). When it came out, the bowl itself was very hot. The actual broth was not, it was lukewarm. A big disappointment. As far as the taste, the broth was very bland and I had to add a lot of condiments to get through eating. 

The boyfriend ordered the Marinated Chicken with Fried Rice. A totally misleading and inaccurate name and description. I don't know what the chicken was marinated in, but we could not taste it. Like the pho, it was very bland. On top of that, the chicken was so dry it almost tasted like it was left out for a day or two. There was not one ounce of moisture left. We had to dunk it in sauce to try and re-hydrate it. What they called ""fried rice"" was anything but that. The rice brought out was orange and had no peas, carrots, or anything fried rice should have.

After a disastrous pho aka ""Zen Noodles"" experience at Grand Luxe Café at our last Vegas trip, I was very skeptical when Nicole S. brought us here on Friday, March 4, 2010. But, I'm glad she did because who would have known you could find almost authentic Pho in TI?

FOOD:
*Cha Gio (Vietnamese Egg Rolls - $9): Meh. It tasted like pork veggie lumpia straight from the freezer section from the local Asian supermarket. The pork and veggie filling had no flavor and was very dry and it wasn't wrapped in the traditional banh tranhg (rice paper). The nuoc cham tasted water down as it lacked the pungent flavor from the fish sauce. 

*#11 Combo Pho with rare beef slices, brisket, tendons, and beef balls ($14.95): Yes, the pho is almost 3x the price of what I would normally pay at a Pho place in SF's TL, but you CAN NOT put a price tag on a hangover cure! The beef broth was rich, savory, and wasn't too salty (the MSG did kick in heavily later). The portions are massive and they do NOT skimp on the meat portions. The rare beef slices and brisket were very tender, the huge chunks of tendon literally melted into your mouth, but the beef balls were a bit hard. The noodles were cooked al-dente just the way I liked them. Throw in the lime wedges, fresh basil, hoison sauce, and Sriracha and you get the perfect balance of tart, liquorice, sweet, salty, and a fiery kick. Just to note: stay away from the bean sprouts which were brown and not fresh. 

SERVICE:
Fast and attentive. We got our pho within 10 minutes. However, on our second visit on Sunday, March 7, 2010, our waitress had somewhat of a bi-polar personality. When my friend was ordering her pho, she requested no onions, and the waitress kept on insisting on the green and red onions. My other friend tried to clarify, and the waitress rudely shushed and waved her hand at my friend. But, then throughout our meal there she was as sweet as can be.

No frills coffee shop type of feel with brown tables and booths, and funky multi-colored brown carpet.

 I was surrounded by so many varieties of breakfast. I just didn't know what I wanted. I knew I wanted to walk. I was staying on the strip. So I started walking around hoping something would come to me. Eggs didn't sound to good. Definitely no buffet. Oh yeah, there is a pho place in Treasure Island. Sure it's overpriced Vegas hotel pho, but it was the viable option, to me, at this point.

 I wandered around a bit in the Treasure Island casino(coincindentally the second place I ever stayed in Vegas, when it first opened)  wondering if the pho place still did exist, or maybe it never existed at all...Oh wait, there it is, ok.

I was sat immediately, no problem. I enjoyed friendly Las Vegas coffee shop service from the waiter and the busser, working together. Full water and all that.

I got the rare steak pho and iced coffee. The soup looked exactly like what it was, overpriced Las Vegas hotel pho. But damn if it didn't taste pretty good. Also there was a ton of it, could not finish, this is rare. The broth tasted a bit different than what I am used to but it wasn't bad at all, in fact it was enjoyably different. The noodles weren't the best but you have to be realistic in Vegas and in life if you want to squeeze the maximun enjoyment out of it. 

The coffee was fine. It had ten fingers and ten toes, you know. I was full, awake and happy once again.

I also got to look out at the empty pool area and watch some high roller guys charge stuff to their friends room via a casino manager and telephone. It appeared to be rather old school. 


If you need it and you are on the strip, go get it. I did. Afterward I wandered over to play some craps and had a blast. Good people in there.",pqpNykuboTkUZs52MxZrQQ,1,0,3,TjILehZ8V7bu0VDObKdfaA

This was an excellent lunch option close to our hotel! Let me start off by saying, I'm using my Vegas ranking system which is...it's gonna be more expensive. However, I've paid way more than I should in Vegas for food that was gross. So in my mind...if I'm getting tasty food and a lot of it for less than $20.00 per person, I consider that pretty awesome. 

I had a bowl of the Vegetarian Pho and it was HUGE and delicious. We also had the spring rolls, and my BF had some kind of a meat dish that was really great as well. Food was great. I also had some of their red sangria, and it was SO good. Seriously. And at only $7.00 a glass, I was very happy with it! We even took some in to-go cups! Gotta love Vegas...

However, a star was lost because the service was pretty terrible. We waited quite some time to order and I didn't get my sangria until AFTER we had our food. But once we ordered food, it came out very quickly and was awesome.

I seriously can't believe this place is so horrible. I have never ate anything worst than this place. After not eating for 12 hours we, my family decided for a quick dinner in treasure island where we were staying. They seriously took almost 10 minutes to sit us down even though it was 11pm and there were so many open tables. I'm far from racist but our waiter was a short, stubby Hispanic lady that was so rude. We couldn't really decide how much food we wanted and she just stood there really impatient so we just ordered a $14 bowl of pho and $10 bowl of vermicelli. After 10 minutes of waiting we tried to order another plate but our waitress was no where to be seen. We asked 2 different people working there to call our server back so we can order but no sight of her. After waiting about 20/25 minutes for a bowl of pho and vermicelli, she finally can out and brought out our food. 

First of all the food did not even smell good. How do you make pho and have no pho smell? leave it up to this place to fuck up making pho.

secondly my bowl of pho was TINY. For almost 3x the price of pho anywhere else at least give us more meat or noodles! It was so small i seriously thought i could have finished it 5 minutes (which i pretty much did)

Lastly, the most important factor... Just because it didn't smell delicious or didn't come in a large quantity, i thought it might be good still. ""Good"" is very subjective usually resulting in mediocre definition but i could not even describe their food as ""good."" It simply sucked. It gives a bad name to pho and bun. The soup was so tasteless. As there was no scent of pho at all, there was also no taste at all. The vermicelli was dry as hell! I seriously could go on but i don't think i need to.

This is what we get when we want to try something instead of going to a place we know is already good. We usually go down the street on spring mountain call Pho Kim Long (i think)",S2YXQsLC3Lr1_aMkf9zrPQ,2,1,1,gPoIFnAryFfsipO8Jpf-vg

Now, if you're like me, and you wake up from Vegas after being out until 5 am, there are very few things that make sense.  One of the few things that actually do work in my foggy mind - FOOD. My fiance made a small mention of pho at TI and once it was put out there, I couldn't take it off my mind.

So, in our hungover state, we walked over, stood in what was a very short line for a table and ordered two orders of Pho Tai.

Sure the service was OK, and sure it won't size up to anything you'll find in Westminster or San Jose, but all things aside, this place seriously HIT THE SPOT.

The name of that place will be kept undisclosed because I'm not one to bad mouth an establishment, unless they give me food poisoning. But I digress.

Our lunch special came with appetizers as well...i could have done without them, the egg roll was very bland, even with the dipping sauce and the shrimp tempura was all batter.

If you aren't, then you will just be disappointed by mediocre food and excruciatingly slow service. 

I dined here with my parents when we stayed at Treasure Island last week. I had just arrived from the airport and it was 10 pm, so I just wanted a late dinner. At first, we were unsure which restaurant we were walking into. Pho has two separate menus for the same dining area: one Vietnamese, and one American diner food. I'm not sure why they didn't just put up a wall and create two separate restaurants. It just seems weird and inefficient. 

The service was terrible. No one came to take our order for at least 15 minutes. After that, we didn't receive our food at least another 45 minutes. The restaurant was not crowded, but the servers never seemed to be around. This is clearly the way the service always is, because they didn't seem the least bit aware that the food took a long time to get out.

When we did get the food, it was disappointing. I got the blackened chicken sandwich which was somehow really greasy. Also, the fries were basically just thin strips of overcooked batter with a little bit of potato in them. I know if I was hammered I'd be probably enjoy it,  but sober, it was bordering on inedible. The food was definitely not worth the wait.

My girlfriend and I were at TI to see Mystere (which was fantastic, by the way, but more on that in another review).  Afterwards, she wanted something to eat and some Vietnamese sounded good.  Now...lets face it.  This is a late night cafe inside a casino called ""The Coffee Shop.""  Even ignoring the 2.5 star average reviews, why would they have good Pho?  Just putting ""pho"" in the name doesn't qualify you.  That said, Vegas does have a large Asian population and lots of Asian tourists and some of them were in here eating.  We weren't in the mood to do a lot of research or bounce all over Vegas, so we rolled the dice.  We got Pho.  At a coffee shop.  We deserve what we get.

I'd probably have gone with 3 stars after my first bite.  I got the beef stew pho - so not really your standard Vietnamese fare.  I figured at the Coffee Shop, lets make it a bit more american and a bit less Vietnamese, and maybe it would be okay.  The first few bites were good.  I was pleasantly surprised.  But the more I ate, the more chewy and gamey the meat became.  I probably had about half the bowl, and then gave up because my stomach was warning me that I was already in for a rough night, and I was pushing it.

As you can probably imagine, I didn't leave there feeling too good.  By the time we got back to our hotel, my stomach was making me pay for what I did.  It was a very uncomfortable sleep that night.

So, why 2 stars instead of 1?  Convenience and taste.  Like I said, it started out pretty good, and it was good enough to finish half of it.  That has to count for something.  But now I know - you don't order Indian food at a gas station; you don't eat the last hot dog at 7-11; and you don't order Vietnamese food from ""The Coffee Shop.""",0-hb63A9uWjR1YIyVMu6rg,1,0,2,zjdHWYQPL51VIjmAJJ0lWA

Service was mediocre at best, and I was surprised to see a $12 banh mi on the menu too.  I got the chicken pho, cause I was in need of some rejuvenation.  The food came out soon enough (I didn't time it though), but it's not instantaneous like a lot of real pho restaurants.  I remember asking if the orange juice was fresh squeezed... and the waitress (bless her old, heart) told me it was from a sourced company who pasteurized it... ""Huh?"" she repeated it once more for me, and I smiled ""no thanks.""  Good try, grasshopper.

The chicken pho was a clean soup.  Didn't feel like a punch of MSG like a Viet Lefty (see: Donnie Brasco).  Nothing extraordinary, but a good chicken soup.  It did the trick, I felt rejuvenated and ready to hit up a pool party.  One friend gave their beef pho a thumbs up.  The other friend gave one up, one down.

If you need semi-quick replenishment, and don't want to poison your healing body with grease, this pricey bowl of pho is it.  I wouldn't make the trip down from South end of the strip though -- only if you're at the hotel, or adjacent.  If you're already in your car, might as well let yelp guide you to better spots.",-2UOdDlzg7XLuUuyOrldhA,2,1,3,rJ1FmMHGoJQW1M-1-tBJNw

So my turnt down party crew and I crossed the bridge and hopped over to Treasure Island to have a bowl of pho at their pho restaurant. 

The service was pretty slow and all I could taste was MSG. The hot soup helped the hangover, but I had to add extra hoisin sauce and sriracha to hide that dreadful MSG flavor.

Came around 11:30 pm and was seated very quickly which was nice. The staff were all personable and friendly. Service was great, however the quality of the food and price completely ruins their score.

First, the pricing is ridiculous. Now, they do give you a large amount of meat for a bowl of pho, which was great! They also only have large bowls, however that's not enough to sway me away from the outrageous prices. $15 on average per bowl, and $19 for specialty bowls. NOT WORTH IT. You can definitely find cheaper, better pho elsewhere. Vegas can price their food however they want, but I'd rather go with half the price off the strip.

Second, the staff was great, but when our bowls finally arrived, they were cold! We had to ask for another full bowl of broth just to get some warmth into our meal.

Overall, this place isn't worth it. I will admit that I have not tried anything else aside from their Vietnamese menu. Maybe their other dishes are better? I don't know, but I won't be going back.",FMrF3ry4QdYTozPuuWV_wg,0,0,2,MjMiRocueFSl1W1yT1sREw

They claim it is authentic so I tried the traditional Vietnamese soup called ""Pho"" and not only did it not taste as authentic as they claimed, it came out cold so the meat did not cook through well, and the the egg rolls I ordered separately were cold and soggy. To top it off, soup and egg rolls came to $36 (tip included). Service was good so I tipped the server but gave my comments politely on the food.

I think your better off going to the smaller mom and pop shop restaurants as they are fast, hot, good tasting (authentic) and reasonable in price. Pho at the cafe is in the Treasure Island Hotel where I am staying, so I thought I'd save myself a drive. Bad mistake; as I should have taken the drive to get a better meal! 

I've tried the Mongolian beef and the honey walnut prawns here during my last visit and would rate the taste and quality as average. It will put a dent in your wallet though as these dishes for a single serving are about $25 each.

The hostess told us that we would need to wait in a nonexistent line and then put up a divider to separate us from the restaurant, even though there were several empty tables.   I had a horrible hangover, so I felt like I was being barred from nourishment.  I began to wonder if I was going to die waiting in line for pho....

I ordered chicken soup with glass noodles and my friend ordered standard pho.  She said hers was average.  Mine was too heavy on the MSG.  In my opinion, a restaurant shouldn't have to rely on MSG to make food taste good.  The glass noodles were cooked fine.  The chicken tasted pretty good on its own.  This did not cure my hangover at all, so I resorted to eating rice and cucumbers until I could lift my head again... I know it's kind of anal and stereotypically Asian of me to mention this, but the rice was cooked with way too much water.  Thank goodness for those cucumbers that saved my life.  

We felt good enough for dessert by the end of the meal, so we ordered the sorbet.  It took them over ten minutes to bring the sorbet out to us, and afterward they incorrectly charged our credit cards.  When I looked at my account the Monday after, I saw that they had charged me twice.  Not cool!  I'm already broke from Vegas as it is!  And the sorbet wasn't flavorful.  Don't get it if you are actually a sorbet person.
