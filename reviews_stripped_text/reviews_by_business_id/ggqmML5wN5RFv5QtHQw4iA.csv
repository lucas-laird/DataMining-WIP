They had zero other customers and no line. Too bad for them. 

The Visa merchant agreement says this:
""When should you ask a cardholder for an official government ID? Although Visa Rules do not preclude merchants from asking for cardholder ID except in the specific circumstances discussed in this guide, merchants cannot make an ID a condition of acceptance. Therefore, merchants cannot as part of their regular card acceptance procedures refuse to complete a purchase transaction because a cardholder refuses to provide ID. It is important that merchants understand that the requesting of a cardholder ID does not change the merchant's liability for chargebacks. However, it can slow down a sale and annoy the customer. In some cases, it may even deter the use of the Visa card and result in the loss of a potential sale. Visa believes merchants should not ask for ID as part of their regular card acceptance procedures.""",cmxqXzcfB2j2qdDEZIp8bQ,0,0,1,DSxCcQZ9lAsjiMQjNdi5wA

It is chilled and the bread is toasted. I was just used to it being served that way. My friend ordered a shrimp roll and it was chilled as well but looked completely raw. She asked them to heat it up. They said that's the way they serve it. Should be mentioned in the menu. I should've asked them to heat up mine also but I was starving.

You pay $20+ for a small lobster roll with probably half the meat. It looks like a price of toast folded in half with half of a lobster on it. When the menu said ""Maine lobster"" I thought the rolls would look like one you get in Maine as well. Well it isn't....it's just tiny. The taste of the Cajun roll I got was good. But let's be honest...it's kind hard to mess up a taste esp if the lobster is fresh enough. 

The side of potato chips that it came with also taste burnt. I think I only ate one and threw the rest away. The side of salad was good. I think that could have been the only thing that met my expectation. 

Totally not worth grabbing a bite here if you have other choices. But if this is your old choice I do recommend getting the Maine original roll. The Cajun isn't spicy at all so it won't satisfy your spice cravings.",bOl7m4puZIXTL5E-Z4ReBw,1,0,2,2DZteGUug3GyktlkzaQ8Yg

I was dead wrong. For the first time in my life, the food actually looked like the picture on the menu. The taste was even better- full of lobster and flavor and juice and sauce, but not overly salty or drenched in sauce. 
The roll itself is sort of too small to be a filling meal for a hungry grown adult, but it's perfect for someone who wants a satisfying meal without feeling full to the brim.

Lobster grilled cheese sandwich something, it was Amazing!!!

5938891,2018-01-26,1,ggqmML5wN5RFv5QtHQw4iA,"Decided to go to Lobster ME for a nice lobster roll lunch today. I've been here before but I don't have much memory of it, probably because I was hung over from a crazy bachelorette party last time I was here haha. Anyway, today, I ordered the Maine lobster roll cajun style (which is basically just adding aioli sauce and scallions for free) on top of your choice of butter and chives or mayo and celery -- I went with mayo and celery plus cajun style. Then it comes with coleslaw and waffle fries but I had the option of adding $2 to make my fries crab loaded or some other options... sure, why not load my fries?

Food came, lobster roll looked great. Huge chunks of lobster. I was excited! But once I took a bite, I was letdown immediately. Not much flavor to the lobster at all. It didn't taste like fresh seafood. And I could barely taste the mayo, and not even the aioli sauce. What gives?? Plus the thickness of the bread roll really takes away from the bites of lobster I put in my mouth. Then the crab loaded fries were so blah. The waffle fries were a bit too hard like they had been sitting out for a little while and it wasn't hot. Again, the crab didn't taste fresh either. I would pass on upgrading my regular fries next time. And onto the coleslaw, omg, worst coleslaw I have ever had. Had NO taste to it whatsoever. I felt like I was chewing grass... err.. I mean, cabbage. Ugh... 

Anyway, that was my experience today. All in all, a little below average. If the lobsters are shipped from Maine, I can see why it doesn't taste fresh since it is most likely frozen. I would come here for a quick fix. But really, it doesn't hit the spot at all. Plus not to mention, they increased the price to $24 a roll now which is even more pricey than before. But hey, what can you do? It's Vegas, you're probably hung over,  hungry, and spending lots anyway. So spend, spend, spend away!",uQ_G0FooT9T0m0eL8Tc2gQ,1,1,2,1ssvdkH-q_MCbmwldn0dvg
