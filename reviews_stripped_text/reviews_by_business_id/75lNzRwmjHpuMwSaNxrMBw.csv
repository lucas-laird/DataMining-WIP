So before the Gazillionaire Elite Event at Caeser's my friend and I decided to go to Muncheeze for a quick bite due to our time constraints.  I personally think and hour at a casual dinning establishment is more than enough time to sit, eat, pay the bill and leave but I guess I was thinking the wrong thing in this instance.  

We were greeted by the hostess and seated quickly.  As we arrived we sat next to a couple who had just sat down and ordered, the waitress then took our drink order at the same time and I asked that a TV be put on a specific game.  We order our drinks and she gives us a minute to look at the menu.  5 minutes later the table next to us gets their drinks and she takes our order.  10 minutes after that we get our drinks (15 minutes just to get drinks?) and the table next to us gets their food.  15 minutes later the table next to us is done eating and are given their check (now in most cases the server would see that we are right next to them and we don't have any food AND the TV that I asked to be changed was never changed) another 15 minutes passes as we watch them pay leave and their table is bussed before the server comes back and says ""you don't have your food yet?!?"" in which I answered ""no, and actually I have to be somewhere at 8pm, I'm going to have to cancel our order.""  She said ""OK, but I can check on it for you, do you want it to go?""  Now since I was going to an event I didn't want to have to carry this stuff across the Casino and then have to eat it while at the event.  So I declined and asked to speak to the manager.  Before the manager comes out the table the food comes.  Now I'm even more irritated.  We have already cancelled the food, obviously we were hungry otherwise we would not have been there, but to not have enough common courtesy to not put the food in front of me that I can't eat now because I have no time to so would be great.The manager seemed friendly enough though about the situation and was very sorry for the incident but the damage had been done.  He offered to get the tab next time we stop by but I'm not sure if I want to do that, I think they lost me at the 45 minute wait.",aT_AzbpcsbodNNtFzPqRVg,3,0,1,b4qGKEzG2wMSFWHQOPNj0A
449144,2011-06-27,0,75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw,"I love to support the food truck scene in Vegas so when I heard about Muncheeze I had to check it out! A grill cheese food truck is brilliant and much more feasible. It definitely cuts down the waiting time you might encounter at the other food trucks. 

My co-worker and I decided to try this place during our lunch hour. First impression- great looking truck! The graphics were cute and so was the truck name...Muncheeze (genius)!

To be a fair judge as always we ordered quite a few sandwiches (Sassperilla, Chi-chi and Piggy Mac) to judge the quality of the sandwiches. I must say that I was impressed and thought that the Chi-Chi and Piggy Mac were pretty dang good. I prefer the Piggy Mac more over Chi-Chi. The bbq pulled pork was just right because it wasn't drenched in BBQ sauce and did not hide the taste of the other ingredients. The Sassperilla was drenched in A1 sauce and by the time I ate it, the sandwich was soggy. The Chi-chi was my second choice, great concept but it was a little dry. 

We also had a side of Mac bites and well I wasn't a big fan of the holla-peno ketchup. I think they should have a spicy ranch dipping instead or maybe just serve with a ketchup/marinara & ranch. 

My co-worker was a little disappointed that they didn't have the tomato soup on that day so another day that I went again they were out of soup...do they ever have the soup? 

For $10, you can get a sandwich, bites and a drink, this saves you a couple bucks, which isn't bad considering the prices of the food truck combos. 

Overall the experience is worth it. Some people get annoyed with the guys blasting the music with your favorite song or whatever they are in the mood to listen to and still they're still getting a hang of the biz but this shouldn't distract you from attempting it just once. C'mon Vegas support your food trucks! Follow them on Twitter, Facebook or their website to see where they end up next.",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,1,0,4,_ZmbcMYTRmsb7vtKDzYQcA

I've had bacon on a grilled cheese before.. but adding BBQ pork, mac & cheese, and jalapeno to it... greatness.

2036442,2011-04-19,0,75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw,"I was so excited to try out the eats from here. And I finally got the opportunity at the last StrEATS. 

They didn't get off to a great start. Glitches prevented them from opening on time and left a few of us waiting in line for a long time salivating and exercising our patience. But hey, they're a newbie truck, so you have to cut them a little slack.

The lobster bisque (one of their soup offerings) was absolutely fantastic. It was served in a bread bowl and filled with all kinds of yummy. Temps outside may be rising, but don't pass up this tasty delight.

For a sandwich, I opted for the one with the pulled pork and mac 'n' cheese. It was good, but not great. It was missing the ooey gooey cheese. But props for an interesting combination.

All the sandwiches come with fries and a dipping sauce (like ketchup, but not). Hint: try dipping your grilled cheese in the dipping sauce.

My main complaint was that it was a lot of food. Especially in a setting with so much food goodness (in other words, so many eats I wanted to sample), the amount of food was overwhelming. It was also awkward trying to balance everything and eat so much while standing up. The portions and packaging didn't quite lend itself to street food. Offering half sandwiches and fries as an optional (not automatic) side would be nice.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,1,0,4,5aKWduMdXvaePR5Dz3d8MQ

2509126,2011-04-26,0,75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw,"The concept of this truck is awesome. The execution still needs a little work though.

I appreciate the trendy food truck craze that is currently overtaking every major city. I think it's awesome. Muncheeze menu is outstanding. There's a little something for everyone. You have the grilled cheese that includes pulled pork and mac n' cheese, or the one that has steak, or the classic ham & cheese, or a combination of cheeses and bacon. Everything in that last sentence flows so beautifully. I'm a cheese enthusiast, so if there is cheese on something I'm usually gettin down with the get down.

Unfortunately where Muncheeze falls short is the quality of the food. Unlike their sister truck Slidin Thru, they miss on a few key points. If I order a grilled cheese, there better be a lot of cheese on there. If I order your grilled cheese that includes 3 different types of cheese, THERE BETTER BE A LOT OF CHEESE. That was not the case when I ordered the Cheesy Lovers Delight (I selected American, Cheddar, and Mozerella). The cheese was barely noticeable, that was disappointing. If it had more cheese it would have changed my whole experience. I decided to get the combo meal, appropriately named the Munchbox Combo which included a tasty glass Coca-Cola and Mac-Bites featuring Holla-peno ketchup. The Mac Bites were a bit greasy and lacked a real cheesy flavor, so those fell short as well.

Another disappointment was that they were out of Lobster Bisque, or, they never really had any since we got to the truck 20 minutes after the windows opened. At first they weren't sure if they had Mac Bites as well. I thought the organization was a little all over the place this time around.

With the awesomeness of Slidin Thru I definitely had high expectations for Muncheeze. Unfortunately they fell short. Knowing that they are run by the iconic slider truck I will give them a second chance.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,3,1,3,k8a7yT7pblV-dZ8ubbA8Cg
2676302,2011-10-11,0,75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw,"Some of these bad reviews I'm reading about Muncheeze Truck just amaze me because I've gone to Muncheeze Truck MULTIPLE times and never had this experience. I think since the truck got new management, especially, the food has gotten better. Although, I am a fan of the old menu. 

The mac bites are delicious. Anybody complaining about a fried food being greasy is ridiculous to me. I LOVE getting the Cheesy Lovers Delight with bacon added. I always leave the cheese choice up to the cooks and it never disappoints! It seems like it's gotten even cheesier since the new management. Also a fan of the Piggy Mac, but the Cheesy Lovers Delight with bacon is by far my favorite.

My service has always been fast with the truck unless I'm at something that's crazy busy like Vegas StrEATS, but you know going into that place that you're going to be waiting for a ridiculous amount of time because the amount of people that are there ordering food. First off, LOOK AT THE LINES! You can easily judge that you'll be at each truck for about 45 minutes to an hour. (I waited at Fukuburger for an hour last time I was there and they were out of half of their items!) A lot of other trucks have food that can be pre-prepped, where as a grilled cheese can't be made ahead of time. And for people bad mouthing grilled cheese businesses and saying they'll always fail, maybe if these don't do it for you then you should check out how successful the Grilled Cheese Truck in Los Angeles is. 

The only thing I'd like more with the truck is for them to be open more often. I haven't seen any dates posted lately...",b2L2ct__m_Su3g5aZqYbgQ,0,0,4,Nx3wn4oVauYdEOCss10SsA

The fleet design and the name of the truck are awesome. The website design is great, menu is comprehensive. And I think the best way to properly serve a grill cheese sammich is via the immediacy only a home kitchen or lunch truck can deliver. All around Muncheeze is a superb idea. BRILLIANT! However: 

I stood in front of the order window with no one in line in front of me for a good seven minutes before I got a greeting. 

I got the OG ($3), just a plain grilled cheese sammich. I also wanted a $5 Tomato soup to dip my OG in and my bf wanted Mac Bites ($5) and the Lobster Bisque ($6). The soup warmer was out, so no Tomato Soup, no Lobster Bisque for us. 

The OG was good. My bf said the Piggy Mac was good, too. Not overpriced. But the service was subpar. I'll be willing to patronize again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to seek them out like last time. Novel.",bEVFXdlFYzZzXsYY1DmXQg,0,0,2,Y1PYYWEfT8xe4Fqfn5uEJg

4451997,2011-09-10,0,75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw,"20 minutes to wait for food from a food truck at a very busy strEATS event - okay. 

To wait 45 minutes - NOT OKAY.

I really wanted to like Muncheeze truck because I love, love, love cheese! When I started following their Twitter and saw that there was a new menu I decided I would go down and try it out. To my surprise this Vegas strEATS was packed! I guess it's gotten a lot more popular since I went to the first couple times.

The Muncheeze truck line was long, but I figured, hey, it's a food truck, they serve out the food pretty fast. I waited in a long line at Lulu's before, but the wait wasn't too bad. Boy was I wrong on that account. Look, the people taking the orders were super nice, I'll give them that, but the guys in the truck making the food? They just looked like they were pissed and moving at a glacial pace as everyone outside their truck stood around and sweltered in the heat.

The food did not make me happy either. I opted for their version of a tuna melt. Welp, it was not melty. Yes, it had tuna in it, but sheesh, there wasn't even any melted-goodness cheese going on! I also got the buffalo cheese curds. The curds were inventive and good, but I wish they had been more ooey gooey rather than rubbery. Luckily I opted to take my food home and popped it in the microwave - 20 seconds later, voila! My curds were actually perfect. 

I've done a sampling of a few of the food trucks here in town and I gotta say Muncheeze is now at the bottom of my list. I suggest they start putting a little more effort into the food.... I think they have a novel idea, but gotta work on it guys.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,0,2,ERCWdw5j1SeQKYHLJYSITg
4744462,2011-04-27,1,75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw,"I doubted Muncheeze Truck.  A grilled cheese truck?  Isn't grilled cheese one of the first things we all learn to cook ourselves when we're children?  And as we grew up, we threw more than just cheese into our sandwiches?  For me, a grilled cheese sandwich is a clean slate where you open up your cupboards and refrigerator, see what random veggies and meats you have, and throw them into your own creation.  Pickles, chips, bacon, tomato and whatever was laying around and doing a bad job at getting eaten.  Why would I pay someone else to make me a grilled cheese sandwich?

Because, unlike Muncheeze, I don't have what amounts to Pulled Porky (Slidin' Thru) ingredients in my refrigerator.  That, and my curiosity had to be quenched; this is the sister truck to Slidin' Thru after all.  I ordered $10 The Munchbox Combo (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw?select=mpiJd-Oce51nSrAv40SWsw), which includes:

-Any sandwich; I went with the Piggy Mac (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw?select=kzXgIx3n3pYd6YEX23Jobg): pulled pork with jalapeño, bacon, mac&cheese and BBQ sauce.  Think Pulled Porky slider with mac & cheese.  The one ingredient that fell short of expectations to me was the mac & cheese; it had that re-heated consistency where the macaroni appears to have absorbed the gooey cheese that you have when it is fresh.  I also don't think it's plausible to have a fresh batch of mac & cheese made for each sandwich, though.

-Six Mac Bites (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw?select=YP__n0J35JtAdi4DlcdPOg): Little macaroni & cheese poppers that comes with a ""holla-peno ketchup.""  It was marinara sauce with a slight zing to it.  The bites themselves (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw?select=VeHYtE8SFymSQHZrRjCKIA) suffered from the same critique I had of the macaroni & cheese in the Piggy Mac.

-A drink; I got a 700ml bottle of water.

If you go strictly by the menu pricing, the Munchbox combo saves you a dollar: $6 sandwich + $3 Mac Bites + $2 drink.  If you go by execution I think it falls a little short; I was hoping for more cheese!  A gooey Piggy Mac that struggled to stay together because the macaroni was swimming in cheese!  Mac Bites that burned the roof of my mouth with cheesy macaroni!  Maybe I was just a hungry kid that grew up putting way too much kids in my sandwiches.  But that is what I was hoping for.

Either way I will be returning to the truck.  I gotta try the Tomato Soup and Lobster Bisque; maybe even the Chi Chi and Sassperilla.  As for their Piggy Mac?  I'm honestly tempted to take home some Porky sliders and pair it up with some fresh mac & cheese for a homemade Piggy Mac...

We were also recently spoiled to have a visit Roxy's Grilled cheese truck from Boston visit Vegas so I got a chance to compare to what a true grilled cheese truck should offer. (I wrote a review for them in another entry)

Anyways Grilled cheese musts.....are CHEESE! GOOEY Cheese, Hot and not Burnt.
Well thankfully this sandwich was not burnt. I ordered the 3 cheese with bacon for $5. It came on standard white bread. The cheese inside was partly melted but not all the way. The Mac bites on the other hand $3 and 6 of them was excellent! It came with with Holla-Peno Ketchup and was well worth the $3. 

Muncheese is the sister truck to Slidin Thru and I know they start making some kickass grilled cheese after they start looking at the product better at the lab.
My only suggestion is using a thicker bread like a Brioche or Texas toast and unique cheeses like Brie, Maytag Bleu and Muenster. At least add thicker cheese and make sure it is gooey/stringy when pulled apart, I will keep visiting and I love the concept and will change the rating as I know you will get better,",hkSiQAfl6w3882JJQzRTlQ,1,0,3,FB1-Hf0_FzMzLGkwx23now

5550188,2011-05-23,11,75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw,"Muncheeze.  Wow, what a complete fail of a business.  It's like the guys that started this food truck only did it to find a place to hang out together and play annoying gangster rap music.  While I was here, I was reminded of not only the Dad's Grilled Cheese business in town that failed, but the show ""America's Next Great Restaurant,"" where there was a contestant who also had a grilled cheese restaurant idea that was eliminated because there was nothing really original or unique about what he was doing.  Regardless, both Dad's Grilled Cheese and the contestant on TV do grilled cheese sandwiches better than the Muncheeze truck.  Hell, I do an infinitely better job at a grilled cheese than they do.  

Okay On to the food.

Basically, it is hard to excuse a place that supposedly specializes in grilled cheese sandwiches when they can't even melt the cheese.  Yes, both sandwiches that were ordered had no melted cheese, but were just a little warmed up.  And there was so little of it.  The quality of the bread (they only offer basic white and wheat) is also pretty flimsy.  Can I also mention that they served stale potato chips with these?

The mac and cheese bites were the neon orange mac and cheese straight out of the kraft box.  At least take the time to make your own mac and cheese from scratch.

And the soups - they were out of lobster bisque but I question their ability to make a quality soup after tasting the tomato soup.  It was worse than a canned campbell's soup.  It was like they bought it bulk from the Cash and Carry/Smart and Final store and served it up.  And the bread bowls they served it in were cold and there was no incentive to eat the bread after attempting to finish the soup.  Anyone that yelped  liked the soup must never get to eat homemade, from scratch tomato soup and knows what it tastes like.

I just can't believe how incredibly lazy the people that run this truck are and how they have the gall to call this actual food and serve it.  The only way I would ever eat this food again is if I was homeless,  but even then with the insanely high prices they are charging for this crap, I'd never be able to afford it.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,16,4,1,TuKLzTX6DHdi08uscjW16Q
