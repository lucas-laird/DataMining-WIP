48548,2015-02-15,0,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"I had dinner here with a group of friends on a Friday night in early February at one friends' suggestion and had a good meal and very friendly service. Overall, it was a good experience and I'd go back on a future trip, but it wasn't knock-my-socks off enough to get five stars.

I hadn't checked the restaurant out beforehand since my friend made the reservation same-day, and I have to say I was a little disappointed in having so few choices for food. The cocktail menu was nice - I had the Red Dawn instead of my typical Moscow Mule, and it was good but not particularly strong. For an appetizer we had the Siberian Nachos. They were good, but I was disappointed at the tiny dab of maybe five or six roe that constituted the caviar portion. I was also extremely surprised to see them come on basically a Ruffles potato chip. I was expecting a blini. For an entree, I had the Beef Stroganoff, and it was really delicious. The beef was so tender it just fell apart, and the noodles and sauce were spot-on. That was enough to make me come back. Because our friends had a show to make, we didn't have dessert.

Our server (Brandon, I think?) was very friendly and gave good recommendations for the menu. The only real issue we had was that the food was coming out of the kitchen a little slow. When my friend mentioned they had a show to make, the dishes came out only a few minutes later.

The decor is interesting - eclectic for sure. It's definitely not pitch dark like one reviewer mentioned. They were also nice enough to give our party a table in the center of the room, so we had a good view of what was going on outside and at the bar. 

Despite a couple of minor complaints, I'd return on my next trip and would recommend it to others.",0c-F2TWIcP8ejWoc5MWajQ,0,0,4,v9NXr-DnblIhuSiku7Jnew

82938,2015-05-11,0,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"It makes me sad to give Red Square a poor review, because in the past, this was my absolute favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The atmosphere is fantastic, and the food used to be stellar. Sadly, I'm not sure if they changed owners/management, but the last time I was there, the vibe was completely different. For one, they no longer had my favorite menu item - the steak tartare, which was one of the best I've had. I was barely getting over that disappointment when I realized that their signature item, the beef stroganoff, was completely changed as well. I ordered it anyway, and while the new version was a perfectly fine braised short rib and noodles, it was nothing like the rich, creamy deliciousness with thick homemade noodles and crispy potatoes that made the old version so special. Their drink menu was also presented to me in an iPad, which completely clashed with the old school Russian atmosphere. Finally, the service was terribly slow due to a large demanding party that our server was dealing with. However, they comped us a very nice bottle of Cabernet when I complained, so props to them for that. All in all, I guess if you haven't been before, it might be ok, but personally I feel like the recent changes were completely off the mark and very disappointing.

Let me first explain that I am part Russian.  Therefore, I appreciate good Russian fare. I enjoy making Russian classics from time to time, but, Red Square toasts Russian culinary while still acknowledging Las Vegas style.

Any Russian loves a good vodka martini.  The ice bar solidifies that your vodka will remain cold while you admire that there actually is an indoor ice block inside of a restaurant in one of the hottest cities in the world.  

The food is the upscale version of country Russian fare.  You will find no gristle on the filet mignon here, nor will you find dried fish on the menu, but this is as classic Russian grub as one can find in Nevada.

We sat for about 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged by the bartender. Don't know her name but she was blonde with tattoos. The bartender ignored questions and told us we could not take pics in a part of the restaurant because,""It's for VIPs only"".  I was told they had vodka samplers that are served on a red block of ice. The bartender said they didn't serve the samplers on ice anymore (One of the main reasons the BDay girl wanted to come here). My friend ordered a Moscow Mule and received it in a glass not a copper mug as it is on the menu and basically anywhere you order it.  When asked about the copper mug the bartender said they didn't have them.  Another friend pointed them out behind the bar. The bartender told my friend they only had two mugs and they were for VIPs only. The bartender seemed to not want us there and we were happy to oblige. The reason i gave two stars was due to the ice bar and the apps. Would of been a cool place to hang out and celebrate but the customer service was awful.

The cocktail waitress should have told us about the happy hour. There is a sign out front but we came in from the other direction and didn't see it. We did speak to the manager but all we got was a couple desserts and coffee but too little too late.  It was obvious the cocktail waitress was more interested in a larger tip than service.

We stumbled upon a statute of a beheaded Lenin, signaling the entrance to the Red Square, which didn't open until 4 PM.  Once 4 arrived, we were the first to walk into the bar that day, taking seats at the bar, which is made out of ice.  

Since this is a Russian-themed bar, they stock a wide assortment of vodkas.  On their menu, they had pages and pages of specialty vodka drinks.  We decided to each order different drinks so that we could sample each others.  

Since there were only a few other patrons, we learned about the history of the place.  When the bar first opened, the bar generated a lot of controversy with the Russian community because of the statute of Lenin -- head attached -- and the perceived romantacizing of Communism.  The bar caved -- or maybe it was really a great publicity ploy -- and decided to behead Lenin in a public ceremony.  The head now resides inside a block of ice in the vodka locker, a walk-in, sub-zero freezer that stores premium vodka for their clients; it's so cold that before you enter, you need to don a thick, russian like fur coat and hat.  

We toured the locker, knocked back a shot of vodka, and read the names of those who rented shelf space inside the locker.  For several thousand dollars a year, one can rent a space, store any vodka you please, have a name plate, and enter the locker any time you please.  Not a bad deal if split among the three of us

We continued to order drinks off the menu until we knocked back every single drink on the menu.  We looked around.  Just as we entered the bar as their first patrons, we exited as their last.  It was 4 AM.",5Qtl5jsqsdmi5g1I869iaQ,0,2,5,iPOEoz2e3g4aq9j1zfqmrg

284288,2009-02-07,0,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"Red Square gets 5 stars based on their Happy Hour, or Cavi Hour, alone.  I've never eaten at the restaurant, but have enjoyed what is perhaps the best, albeit high end, meal deal in Vegas many many times.

I've been coming to Vegas since '86 and truly miss being able to get from Bally's to Fremont St in 10 minutes :D.  I also miss the meal deals in those bygone days when you'd eat prime rib and lobster for lunch because it was actually cheaper than a burger.  Red Square offers a bargain that rivals those $3,95 wonder-meals...only at 2009 prices, with much better ambiance, and with higher quality food.

I'm describing the Cavi Hour where you can get 2 martinis and an ounce of Petrossian's osetra caviar for only $30.   Ok, I've eaten at Petrossian's in Manhattan several times and I know that an ounce of osetra there will set you back about $45 (they sell it by the gram, so I did a little conversion for ya!).  And that's if you buy it ""to go"" and of course, it's much more expensive - almost double - if you get the whole set up...and that's what you get at Red Square.  Caviar served on a bed of ice, mother of pearl spoon, blinis, creme fraiche, chopped egg, etc...the whole bit.

Sit at the cool (get it?) ice bar - be prepared to wait for a seat - and enjoy the great bartenders and an ~$100 extravagance for only thirty bucks.  Heckuva way to start the evening!

Update -  Thx to Kurt S. in LA who (gently) corrected me that the caviar is American Sturgeon and not Osetra...hey, at least I calculated the price/value within a buck :D!",u1C6Qf5DN5qoqlPFAaSr3g,4,3,5,wcBQaNTql72c80WdI3rwsw

When we got to the front we were told by the hostess did we want to get seated because the kitchen closes at 10. First mistake we should have run then. Why would the kitchen close at 10 on a Saturday night and more importantly why would you seat a party of 6 at 10w ith a closed kitchen . So here we go off to the races . Four different waters were doing hit and runs at our table they would ask the same questions and never come back with what we asked for . Then the one of the waitresses came over and we then were hurried into ordering and she forgot to take one of my clients orders . 25 Minuted in no water at the table and no drinks .

We go to Vegas quite a bit for tradeshows etc. and are frequently stuck between Manadalay and Luxor for our entertainment.  This time we discovered Red Square.  I had heard of it before, but had never popped in.  Well, a friend of ours called to have us meet him there and am I glad I did!  He introduced us to Zyr vodka!

According to our pal, it's only sold in 5 states(unless you can have it shipped, which I can not b/c the state tightly controls our liquor here- boo!)  It is the smoothest vodka I have ever tasted and it would be a crime to mix it with anything!

I also tried their Espresso and Banana martinis-- fabulous!  The Espresso martini came with a red, candy square in it (nice touch!)  And the banana with a large slice of dried banana dipped in chocolate tucked into it (yum!)  

I loved the decor- very dark and rich with onion shaped blown glass shades in a kaleidescope of colors on their main chandelier in the bar.  Gorgeous!  I will def. pop in here for a cocktails with friends the next time I'm in town.",97VE7yPbzssyZMzh4LXrvA,0,0,5,wuB1cWj6WEYW96_aoTzWNQ

The menu offered some unique selections, but I thought it was a bit pricey considering what you actually got and for the uninspired service we received. The stroganoff was good, but not memorable. The tuna tartar was a nice appetizer and we enjoyed the Siberian nachos.

588441,2011-01-01,0,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"My friend and I made reservations here for their $95 New Years Eve pre-fix menu since we were attending the Mandalay Bay Block Party, and I had been wanting to eat here for quite some time.  Overall it was a good experience, good food and great service.  

Food
- Amuse:  ""Caviar"" (caviar filled beggar's purse) - this was actually very good.  It was filled with some type of extremely creamy cheese that had a strong flavor.  I love cheese so this was good in my book.  The beggar's purse evened out the creamyness and added a nice balance.

- Appetizer: ""Crab Cake"" (jumbo lump crab, shaved white asparagus, Russian  remulade) - the crab cake was fairly large in size and tasted good, although very standard.  There was not an overwhelming amount of filler & outside had a nice crisp to it.  The asparagus was very crunchy so if you like crunchy, you'd like this...however, I was not a fan as I prefer my asparagus cooked fully.  The remulade was good but did not stand out; it reminded me of thousand island dressing.

- Salad:  ""Crispy Goat Cheese Salad"" (baby argula, granny smith apples, endive, champagne vinegrette) - lovvvveeedd the salad!  Again, I am a huge cheese fan so this was great.  The cheese was a perfect crisp, atop of the bed of greens.  The vinegrette was light and refreshing, and not too overpowering.

- Entree:  ""Scallops"" (seared jumbo sea scallops, lobster mashed potatoes, charred tomato relish) - although no scallops have been able to touch the ones I had at RM Seafood (flippin' amazing), I was still a fan.  The presentation could have been better, as all three scallops ranged widely in size and looked like they were slopped on top of the taters.  The taters were standard, and I'm not sure they should have included ""lobster"" in the title, as I encountered one SMALL piece of lobster.  The charred tomato relish was very tangy.

- Dessert:  ""Chocolate Caviar"" (crunchy chocolate pearls, strawberry creme fraiche, vanilla blini) - I didn't like the creme, it almost reminded me of yougurt with a very strong ""yogurty"" taste.  The chocolate pearls tasted like dark chocolate and were good, however you had to sift thru to the bottom of the creme to get to them.  Vanilla blini was a tad dry.

For drinks I had some type of martini, (can't remember the name & can't find the drink menu online) which was very good.  It was strong, not too sweet and refreshing.  It had grapefruit juice which balanced out the flavors.  It came garnished with a huge wedge of grapefruit, so big it kind of made us laugh.  A champagne toast accompanied dessert, which was good.

Overall the food presentation was good, minus the scallops.  The service was spectacular- our server was very friendly and personable, the host girls were cute and welcoming upon arrival.  Timing of the food was just about perfect, the courses were spaced out very well.  I really liked the enviroment, as it had an almost old Russia feel...the lighting was very dim and red which added to the experience.  I also like the fact it's off Mandalay's casino floor. 

By no means was the food the absolute best I've ever had, however it still good warrants a return visit.  Putting together the  atmosphere, service and food, Red Square was an overall good experience and there are many other menu items, including their extensive vodka selection, I would like to try...

The Vodka Vault experience is a joke at $90 for four half shots of vodka and 20 minutes in the vodka storage room.  The fan was so loud we could not even carry on a conversation.  Many of the Russian specialties are no longer on the menu, but the shrimp cocktail was quite good, as was the steak and lobster.  In hindsight, we could have had that combination at one of the many popular steakhouses around LV.  If we ever decide to go back, it will simply be for vodka and caviar at the bar.

The sauce is not anything close to what one would expect for stroganoff. There was no hint of the sour cream flavor that is commonly used in stroganoff. The menu listed creme fraiche as being used. But, the sauce was so dark, that if creme fraiche was used it had to be a very small amount. The taste, color, and consistency of the sauce was more similar to beef stew. I did not like the Strozapretti noodles at all. 
The chef chose to use Strozapretti noodles instead of egg noodles. I am fine with making changes to improve things but  these noodles were thick, mushy and did not go well in this dish (think of big thick noodles inside your beef stew).

865662,2009-04-02,1,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"Red Square is one of those meal experiences you will never forget, and always hope to experience again. A friend works for the restaurant group responsible and made a reservation for us to dine here. 

First of all, the decor is absolutely perfect, with dim red lighting, pictures on the walls, a bar to the right with shelves upon shelves of vodka. Was a great atmosphere for a dinner celebration. All sorts of people dining or having drinks, old to young, groups of all woman, groups of men, couples, you name it! 

The minute we sat down our server came to speak with us, made a couple of jokes and told us not to be shy about being loud and enjoying ourselves. He was the friendliest most helpful waiter I have ever encountered and we felt very comfortable.

He explained the drink menu and made recommendations. We pretty much stuck to the drink recommendations he made and were not disappointed. Drinks were fabulous! Make sure and at least try one. The drink menu is beyond anything I've ever seen, many different kinds of vodkas, martinis, and cocktails. They also explained they can pretty much make any drink you want with any one of their vodkas on hand-- just take your pick! 

We had these dumplings as an appetizer that our waiter recommended. He said it was on the bar menu but that we could order it if interested. It came in a very rich broth, and once we ate all of the dumplings we asked for more bread so that we could soak up the rest of the broth. Delicious!

I ordered the dinner special of the day which was a steak with crab on top and Bearnaise sauce. It also came with truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus. Now, I like my meat mooing-- you heard me, mooing. My piece was made exactly the way I like it- juicy and rare. The mashed potatoes were also delicious and the asparagus- I actually ate all of it! I am not the biggest vegetable fan, and I actually liked it, so that says a lot! 

I also tried some of the other dishes my friends ordered, including the lobster fettucine-- hearty and tasty, and the strogonoff-- again, really hearty but flavorful!  

We got a round of Vodka shots, I am not sure which one it was, all I know is it was a flavored vodka and we were all pretty loud and rowdy after that! 

For desert, my friend was kind enough to set up a ""Birthday Desert"" which I believe was an assortment of different sweets on their menu. My favorite was this faux sweet blinis. There were these crunchy chocolate balls in a sort of strawberry yogurt, and it resembled caviar. Then you assembled your own little blini with the chocolate on top- SO GOOD! Wow, absolutely delicious, I was eating it by the spoon full! The chocolate cake was also delicious, and the plate said ""Happy Birthday Nicole"" in chocolate! So cute, and so special. I was so touched! 

We then had to experience the whole Vodka Vault thing, having shots off of Stalin's head in fur coats and hats. We took a whole lot of pictures in our gear, and the nice woman in charge of the vault was very patient with our over eagerness. 

The service was absolutely impecable- but in a very intimate, friendly sort of way. I strongly believe that even if they food were terrible (which it wasn't) you'd still have a great time. Great for big groups, celebrations, dates, any occasion. A wonderful way to start out my Birthday weekend in Vegas.",4ZPxHxEfLcVFJoFhGAuc2w,1,1,5,0d9D3iJ_96_zlsLASKoVxg

992405,2014-08-28,1,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"My husband and I have talked about dining at Red Square for a long time, but for one reason or another it has never happened. When I saw their restaurant week menu my interest was immediately piqued they were offering choices unlike anyone else. Dinner was $40.14, there were three choices of Appetizer and Entree, and two Dessert options. We started with Mini Lobster Tacos and Siberian Nachos. Entrees of Beef Stroganoff and Chicken Kiev followed, and we finished with Toffee Bread Pudding for dessert. 

It was a shame the tacos were bite sized because they were mighty delicious and I was left wanting more. The delicate lobster was perfectly prepared, which too often is not the case. The nachos were intriguing, with smoked salmon piled high on potato crisps and topped with American caviar. I wish the potato slices were thicker to better support the salmon and if they were unseasoned there would still be plenty of residual saltiness from the caviar. 

I've grown up eating Beef Stroganoff, it's one of my favorite comfort foods. This version was more rich and better composed with braised short rib, wild mushrooms, perfect Strozzapretti and dollops of ricotta. It was tasty and a hearty portion. The chicken kiev was served with Brussels sprouts, it was unfortunate that the pan sauce was so overwhelmingly over seasoned that any other flavor beside salt was completely lost. 

Our waiter strongly recommended the bread pudding. I typically do not enjoy bread pudding so I was hesitant but agreed. Honestly, I'm glad I didn't have to share. Croissant pieces were piled high and served with salted caramel ice cream and toffee sauce to drizzle and it was topped off with vanilla Captain Crunch. It definitely had a breakfast taste, reminiscent of warm cinnamon rolls without being too sweet. Truly, it was a pleasant surprise. 

Our dinner was deeply discounted, it was a great opportunity to try Red Square. We had an enjoyable meal even if two of the dishes were over seasoned. 3.5 stars.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,1,2,4,QVGyAlGYgtm_LcG9B1Beqg

I'll admit this was the place I was looking forward to going to the most. Now I know the biggest complaint is this is not real Russian food and that's true. They will tell you this when you sit down. This is Russian influenced food only. Keep this in mind if you try this place. Second, There are two things to go for one being the Vodka flights and Vodka locker and the other is the ice bar. We had a reservation for 7 PM on Christmas eve and we were seated right away. The atmosphere was amazing here. The attention to detail was what made this restaurant stand out from others. The service was spot on. The waiter went through every page of there huge menu and was VERY knowledgeable. He gave some suggestions and he was dead on. One thing to note this is not a cheap meal and if your strapped for cash not the best place to go. Maybe for a special drink but not to eat. There meals floated around the $32.00+ per range. My friend got the Kulebyaka (Salmon) it was pretty good. I got the Chicken Kiev and it was incredible. It just melted in your mouth and was just perfect. Also, got a the USSR Vodka flight and this was a real treat. The vodka flight is a must have if you like vodka. There are 4 shots and plenty for 2 people to share. The total for the 2 meals, vodka flight, and a salad (Czar) came to $122.84 before tip. Very much worth it in my opinion. I would most certainly return in the future. I will not make this a yearly visit for food but will go to the ice bar for drinks on every trip. After I had paid the bill we wanted to go to the Ice bar for a few martinis. I've never had one nor really like them but the bartender was very cool and willing to make anything you want with no questions. Willing to make them stronger if they were not without charging for each shot and the bar area was really a cool place to have a drinks.

The foods I tried were at happy hour (4-7 daily) and were therefore less than full price (woo hoo for me). The Siberian nachos featured a freshly made crispy and thin cross-cut potato chip topped with buttery soft smoked salmon. There was a dollop of sour cream and some fine black caviar on top.  The portion would have been fine to share, and with the fries it made more than an adequate dinner for little ole me. The atmosphere at the bar is dark and a bit noisy.

We ended up splitting the crab-stuffed portobello mushroom to start, which was a good choice.  For dinner, we shared the butterfish and the stroganoff, with a side of asparagus.

Your vodka shooters are awesome (anywhere from $28-$100+, depending on what you want), you have more booze than I've ever seen, the entire interior of your place is RED, and you have a freezer where you can do vodka shots off an ice sculpture of Stalin's head in fur coats and hats??? I think I'm in love. 

I'm only subtracting one star for your incredibly high food prices - and the fact that I couldn't afford to go inside the freezer and drink. Your appetizers are delicious, but $18-$24 for a snack is not my idea of reasonable. However, you do get props for splitting an entree for one of the couples with us into two dishes, and not complaining about them trying to save some $$$ by doing so (pasta for $42). 

Thanks for being so cool, Red Square guys - even if you did try to kill me with the alcohol content of that Chernobyl drink!

After dealing with a hostess, who didn't care that the OpenTable Reservation system had not worked for the past three days, we were seated at a very comfortable booth and our evening began.

To start, we ordered the Siberian Nachos, which are just spicy enough with a touch of Wasabi and some delicious Salmon.

I ordered a Kiev, which was good, but lacked the Banana taste it was alleged to contain.

It was followed up with some ""Pretzel Rolls"" which had just the right amount of salt to offset the Alcohol in my Kiev.

For an Entree, I ordered the Stroganoff. It was good, but not quite as wonderful as I had been led to believe.  I also tried the ""Lenin's Kryptonite"" which I enjoyed more than the Kiev, as it was slightly sweeter.

Dessert was ""Raspuin's Magic Chocolate Bar"" which did not disappoint.  I'd never heard of ""Peanut Butter Dust"" before!

As will all the Restaurants in Mandalay Bay, there is a price to be paid in the form of a high bill at the end. However, I was ultimately not discouraged and would very likely return again in the future.

The waitstaff was exceptionally prompt, and our waiter was always present and happy to answer any questions we had.

The YS ordered a flight of vodka (four shots) that came in a red square of ice to keep it chilled.  That was the most fun trying all of those and the cool way they had of presenting it.

We of course being the model customers had to have drinks, dessert and appetizers because you know that's where they make their money.  It was all so eloquently done we hardly minded the $200 that was to come by later.

They used to have great shirts and caps that read ""Red Square - Join the party."" Now the waitresses are dressed in more Vegas-y seductive military-esque uniforms, which fit the theme better, I suppose. 

The drinks are always amazing. We've tried the White Ruskie (a twist on the white Russian), the Root of Sin, and the KGB, and all three were very tasty and strong enough. My girlfriend looks forward to the KGB especially, every time we plan a trip.

The last two visits have been since they changed the menu and shirts, so the review will be on those. 


Visit 2 - 4/5 stars. 6-18-2015 

The one dock of a star is because they overcharged us and then wouldn't answer their phone when we called to resolve it. If someone messages me saying they will toss the tip to the waitress, I'd be more happy.

We both asked for recommendations from our waitress, and ended up ordering the steak and the prawns as our dishes, with some sliders for appetizer. The sliders were very small, but tasty. Nothing special. 

Drinks were amazing.

My steak was very juicy, and well-portioned. They said it came with one side-dish, but ended up charging us for it ($9). We noticed it, and called to tell them to give it as a tip to our waitress, because she was pretty good. Instead it went to the restaurant for a sneaky charge. Lame!

The steak came with two sauces. The first was a sharp, tangy red wine sauce that really electrified, tangy, the tongue at first taste. The second was a green peppercorn sauce, which was creamy and sweet, with a bit of an earthy undertone.

I asked for mashed potatoes as a side dish and they were amazing. It came with a bit of smoked sea salt, and the texture was heavenly. It was creamy, with hearty chunks stirred in, and the flavor was rich and smoky. Very unique, and perfectly complimented the steak. One waiter stopped by and hinted that it went well with the green sauce, and indeed it did!

My girlfriend ordered the prawns, per recommendation, and she was 100% satisfied. I don't do seafood, but she wouldn't stop talking about it all day. The side it came with was delicious, and she kept stealing my red wine sauce and forcing me to try it with different parts of her dish.

For a dessert, we did a bread pudding with caramel sauce. Bread pudding is either amazing or boring, and there's not much in-between. By this point, the drinks had me a little biased, but I believe it was on the amazing end of the spectrum.

Visit 1 - 3/5 stars. About 2 yrs ago.

The drinks were great. I ordered the only chicken item on the menu (lays chicken) and my girlfriend ordered a lobster dish. My entree was surprisingly tasty. Would probably have been a decent portion if I didn't have to split it with my girlfriend when she got jipped on her portion.


The lobster dish, however, was pretty plain, and although it was presented beautifully, the portion size was actually very deceptive. They put a large shell on the plate, which made the food look raised, and better portioned than it really was. For the $35 or whatever it was, it was essentially appetizer-sized, and didn't even taste good enough to be memorable.

Overall, it was good, but we both could have used a little bit more food.",1AX2vfedlAF30hsn_-ILMg,4,1,4,InAlfadwvpG2spOwOcM5gg

I had celebrated many birthdays and meals before concerts at this place.

It had been a few years since I had gone back but I was there this last July. I was told with new management they no longer make my favorite peach bellini. That annoyed me. How could they get rid of it!  I ordered the chicken kiav. It was so disappointing. There was no butter in the dish and it was intensely dry. That's what chicken kiav is;  moist chicken filled with butter and crispy on the outside. It was filled with some green vegetable. I couldn't even tell what it was. My husband did not like his steak and my sister felt the same way about her chicken kiav. After that I knew I was never going back and this ruined it for me.

We had a wonderful, filling dinner capped with delicious signature cocktails. I already liked Russian food and I was impressed by the kitchen's attention to detail.

A night or two later, we came back with the entire wedding party. We wanted to toast the bride and groom with the whole vodka bottle service in the freezer shabang. Little did we know that the staff at Red Square were going to want to close a full two hours early. No kidding, I was shocked.

We ended up in the lounge during happy hour since they don't serve their full menu until 5pm. They had a fine array of small plates and drinks. I was already super drunk, so we ended up just ordering a bunch of appetizers on the happy hour menu! Overall I had a 5 star happy hour experience! 

The happy hour food:

1. American caviar tasting - Highly recommend! The plate comes with 6 pieces of blinis with with 3 different caviars each with its own flavor profiles! Great for 2 people. 
2. Mussels and clam - my favorite dish that we ordered! Like the name, it's a bowl of mussels and clams with grilled bread. Very flavorful and not overpowering with the garlic. At the bottom of the bowl, it had this sauce that I dipped the bread in and it was a wonderful experience in my mouth! 
3. Steak tartare bites - this dish came with 4 small bites of the steak tartare on its own piece of toast. I've never had steak tartare before, so I didn't know it was a cold dish. Nonetheless it was very tasty! 
4. Meatballs - the meatballs were very good as well. Pretty standard! It also came with Grilled garlic bread that looked like pita bread that paired well when you dip it into the gravy sauce! 
5. Toffee bread pudding - we got this for dessert and it was very good when you take a bite of it with the salted caramel ice cream that comes with it! 

Ambiance: it's very spacious and dark with tones of red lighting! Even the waitresses are dressed in bright red dresses. Very calm, not too noisy.

I have a confession to make. I found out about this place because I did a search for ""vodka"" on Yelp. I was like, ""Ooh! A vodka bar? Sign me up!"" Then I looked at the food menu and decided I really, really needed to go here.

So my boyfriend and I ventured over here for dinner the first night of our most recent Vegas trip. It's a good thing that he also likes vodka, because we ordered a lot. We ordered two flights (Around the World and USSR), stupidly expecting Utah-sized samples. When the eight full shots came out, we were a little overwhelmed. However, good vodka must be consumed! Around the World was the clear winner here. I was already quite familiar with Vox, and the vodkas from Poland and Iceland were first rate. 

Then we ate some food, because you have to soak that vodka up with something, right? Oh, this wasn't just something! I got the angel hair pasta with crab meat, because I was totally in the mood for pasta. This is one of those dishes that can easily be unremarkable, but the freshness of the crab meat and the subtle but awesome spices of the tomato sauce made this one to remember. It must be noted, though, that my boyfriend's Roquefort Filet Mignon blew my entree (and most food in general) out of the water. Tender, tasty meat + delicious blue cheese = epic win. 

Oh, but we weren't done! We decided we were not yet done with drinking and ordered the dessert shot flight. We started with the key lime pie one to get it out of the way because neither of us really like key lime pie. This, however, was stellar. I think that when Camilla asked Dexter to find her the perfect key lime pie, she should have totally brought her this shot. Not saying anything other than that because I don't want to put a Dexter spoiler alert in my food review! Anyway, that was followed by two coffee flavored shots which ruled, and a banana shot that was the perfect end to a perfect dinner. 

So, the food and drinks were obviously awesome. Service was occasionally slow, but our server (Joseph) was very friendly and had some great recommendations. I was in love with the atmosphere: dim lights, vaguely hip music, Communist memorabilia. The hipster in me was so excited to be here.

t began with a friend of who won several $1K's of dollars playing poker and staying in a suite at Mandalay to convince me (a local) to come visit him for a drink at Red Square.   Our bartender, Rebecca was delightful enough to oblige our request for a few special cocktails. 

Then the barback, Jason, obliged our request to have multiple shots, after inviting a few other guests into the Vodka ""Freezer"" Chamber for a few shotsl  

Upon returning to our seats, after 10 shots total and 3 rounds plus appetizers at our table, we were having a great time.  Coupled with the NBA playoffs, (and some high bets on the game) we decided for on more round of drinks, which Rebecca served.  During the ""mixing period"" of our drinks, the bar has some bottles of Vodka 'frozen' into the bar which my friend and I promptly released as a jest to the challenge that it couldn't be removed.  Once removed, we were playing a funny game of hide and seek.  

Coincidentally, our bill came!  We promptly paid it after returning all the ""preset alcohol bottles"" back (per Jason's request).   After our credit card and bill (for $300+) was approved, the security PROMPTLY came and asked us to leave.  We hadn't done anything wrong aside from removing the bottle from the ""frozen bar"" but we replaced it before we left!!!

Nothing more embarrassed my friend and I in front of our out of town guest than the unresponsive (ignorant) security asking us to leave.  They had no clue of the situation they were responsible for removing until we requested to know why we were being asked to leave. The ignorant security responded that the manager saw us taking the bottle from the bar, and wanted us to leave.  Although we had returned the bottle (and conveniently had just paid our tab) they continued on and did NOT give us explanation as to our request for departure.  The manager walked away and the ""security"" did nothing intelligent nor poignant  to express our reason for being dismissed. 

We left without refute but still completely unsure of the purpose.   Fortunately we had paid our tab, yet on our way out, we were completely confused and dissatisfied with the way we were treated upon our last 30 minutes there after spending over $300 and a few hours having great conversation and drinks with the bartender (Re)becca) and barback Jason.

I love vodka, but since I had an early morning scheduled for the next day, I decided to just stick with wine.

Since we were in a large group, we were seated in a private room toward the back, so I can't really comment on the decor.  Service was excellent and attentive.  The waiter expertly guided us on choices for both appetizers and entrees.

For appetizers, we had the calamari, tuna tartare, siberian nachos (essentially smoked salmon on wonton chips), and steak tartare.  All were excellent, especially the siberian nachos.  Next I had the goat cheese salad followed by the salmon kulebyaka, which is a seared filet of salmon sandwiched between puff pastry served over mushroom risotto and topped with an american sturgeon caviar dill-saffron beurre blanc.  The entree was outstanding with a more than generous portion size.  I was stuffed from the appetizers, so I wasn't able to finish my full entree, which usually isn't a problem for me.  We passed on dessert because of our work schedule.  Overall, a great experience.

1978974,2017-11-14,0,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"Our experience with the restaurant was terrible:

THE FOOD: My wife ordered the Filet Mignon. The $50 steak had no flavor. You could get the same piece-of-meat at Norm's for 1/3 of the price. The dish came with no sides so it was an additional $8-$12 for the sides. I am sorry but this is not Morton's or Flemming's. This is a lounge bar that thinks their food is upscale, which is is not. 

THE AMBIANCE: If this was suppose to be an upscale lounge, it certainly did not look it to us. It was about 7:00 PM on a Friday Night and the patrons were a few older couples and a table full of people on business. The music was booming but the atmosphere was sad. 

THE SERVICE: All the waitresses were wearing tight short mini-dresses and high heels. Was this supposed to be a high-end Hooter's? They had absolutely no service skills. Our waitress was unfriendly and totally disinterested. When asked about some of the items on the menu, her answer were curt and short. It was as if she had somewhere better to be. Sigh! After taking our orders, she came back 3 times to check on us. Each time, she barely stopped walking passed our table. She whizzed by while asking if ""everything was OK?""

THE WORST: We paid a portion of our bill through Groupon. First, there was a automatic gratuity for just 2 people. Really?! When we were presented with the bill, it was carefully folded so that you could not see the charge of $18.00 for gratuity. The portion of the bill that you could see stated that gratuity has not been included. What?! If you did not look, you would end up paying the gratuity twice. Second, when we gave our credit card to the waitress, she charged the balance to our room including a second gratuity charge . We never asked her to do that. We did not even tell her that we were guests of the Mandala Bay. She took our name off the credit card, looked us up on their system and charged the balance of the bill to the room. Why did she do that? That is a total invasion of privacy. She wanted to double her gratuity? When I called the next day to speak with the acting manager ""Reva"", she informed me 3 times during our conversation that ""this happens all the time"". At which point, I asked ""what do you mean that it happens all the time? and ""it happens all the time that your staff take it upon themselves to look up the guests' names to see if they are guests of the Mandalay Bay and automatically apply the charges to the room without their permission?!"" She replied that she needed to speak with the waitress. At this point, I realized that she was just deflecting. I was not going to get an apology nor some sort of answer so I thanked her and ended our conversation. Even now, I have no idea if additional charges are going to show up on my credit card or my room charges. I guess they can place charges onto your credit card or your room without your permission. 

I sent a message to Guest Services at the Mandalay Bay but  have not heard from them yet. My next recourse would probably be security services or perhaps contact the Las Vegas PD. I feel that our privacy has been invaded. Now they have access to our info including our credit caqrd number.

My husband and I went here last night on our first night of our mini vacay. 
I was very much looking forward to my dinner here.  The ambiance was fantastic and I've heard great things.
We each started off with a martini (a peach something for me and a dirty bleu cheese olive martini for him) both of which were super strong but delicious. 
We had the salt and pepper calamari which was very good.  The batter was crispy and not too greasy and the dipping sauce was sweet with a spicy kick.  They give you a ton of calamari so we didn't finish.
I got the chicken kiev and he got the rack of lamb.  I was extremely disappointed with my chicken :\  The breading fell right off the chicken and was soggy.  There were a few big fatty pieces and everything was very under-seasoned.  Not even any salt at the tables to fix that.  My husbands rack of lamb, though, was impeccable.  It came with a sweet potato flan that was a thing of beauty.  The lamb was perfectly medium rare with a hazelnut dijon crust.  I might just dream about it.

I heard another waiter at the table next to us announce a special of filet oscar as we were almost done with our meal.  I was very disappointed.  Filet oscar is my all time favorite and I most definitely would have ordered that had I been told it was a special.  It would have been in their best interest, as well, since I ordered the chicken which was the least expensive thing on the menu but would have ordered the oscar which was probably the most expensive thing!  We had another couple of cocktails which were good but not mind blowing and didn't have room for dessert.
My husband really wanted to try the vodka ice bar thing, but it was a 200 dollar minimum for a bottle and I have a hard time justifying 200 dollars (or more!) for a bottle of vodka that I could buy at bevmo for 30.  I know, I know, it's the ""experience.""",Z0Nbmdco1Xz1ZH5SxpV_kQ,0,0,3,P1k_u__1svuRqLMNlMdAKQ

We were going to start out with the vodka vault so that we could get all dressed up in the fur coats and hats but decided last minute that the required minimum bottle for $200 to get you in wasn't worth it to us. However, if you don't finish the bottle, they give you unlimited mixers at your table or you can even bring it home with you. Unfortunately we were heading out for a long night and we didn't want to carry the bottle around with us.

On to the food - we ordered the Siberian Nachos, Stroganoff, Salmon, Chicken Kiev, and Skirt Steak. Everything was delicious!!! I'm not a smoked salmon fan so that didn't do it for me, but the rest of the table loved every bite. Also, the portions here were really generous. None of us were able to finish our plates because we were all so full. But if I could have stuffed one more bite into my mouth without feeling like a whale I would have because it was that good.

The drinks - we tried so many martinis. Since they're famous for their vodka drinks, we didn't hold back and they were worth it. Strong and not overly-sweet which I can't stand. So they get a big thumbs up from us on that note.

A huge statue of Lenin dominates the doorway, as well as the USSR hammer and sickle on the tiled floor. The interior can best be described as dark, with lots of red and lots of ice. In fact, part of the bar is a frozen block of ice lit underneath in red. Great for keeping the drinks cold long after they've been poured. 

Going along with the themed decor, the food selection includes several types of caviar, along with blini, Chicken Kiev, and Stroganoff. 

Atmosphere is laid back and casual. Everyone is dressed from jeans to dresses depending on where they're coming from or planning to go to after.

It was not at all busy at this time. (6pm). There were two other tables occupied, and yet, we were sat in an awkward corner in the front of the restaurant, by the door. We were almost hidden! We got ice waters almost immediately from the pleasant busser, which was a relief because we did not get our actual drinks until our food came out! 

Like I said, the food and drinks were excellent, but we were almost neglected the rest of the experience! We finished our food and wanted a dessert and a key lime martini. Those came out pretty quickly, and again, by the busser. Our server seemed to be missing in action! (again, it was not busy!) 

The server did show up to give us our check (big surprise!) and we wanted to charge it to our room to get our M Life points but she didn't leave a pen in the check presenter. And she was missing...AGAIN! We waited almost 20 minutes (no exaggeration!) for her to come back to us. Luckily, we had cash on us, because we would have waited another 20 minutes for her to swipe a credit card or to charge it to our room! 

It's obvious that the server didn't think we'd tip her well, so we were not worth her time. Funny thing is, we are 20% tippers (I'm a waitress) and she really missed out! 

If you do decide to dine here, don't expect great service if you're dressed in casual attire and/or look young! It's really unfortunate because the food and drinks were great and the decor was beautiful. (could have done without the 'club' type music... something softer and classier would have made it much nicer)

We decided to stay for more food and drinks after our vodka Vault experience. Our bartender was super attentive and knowledgeable about the drinks that they had available. The bar itself was really neat as it had ice running down the center to keep your drinks cold. We ordered the meat and cheese board that came out very fast.

Ahi tuna, salmon, pork tenderloin, rack of lamb, lobster ravioli or pasta, and steaks, as on every other menu I looked at that week. Sometimes duck, and when it is, 95% of the time it's a combo of the grilled breast and the confit prepared separately. As always, the obligatory chicken dish, too.

The other drawback to Red Square was the insipid trip hop that droned the entire time I was there, and the clientele that seemed to enjoy it while sipping their $17 froo froo martinis. Must have been on company money, or they're out of their minds.

The traditional beef tartare was very good, and not more than I would expect to pay a hamburger-sized ""patty"" of raw beef. I'm glad they kept it simple and didn't try to do anything original.

My duck was not bad. It would have been good for, say, $13, but I think it was close to $40. I wasn't able to finish it, not because I was full, but also not because it was horrible. I guess a taste of it would have been enough.

Even if you just stop in for a drink or two, the bartenders are great showmen and the drinks are pretty damn tasty - and usually I don't go for too many martinis in the first place.

The bar made of ice adds something wonderful to the decor, too - especially since it keeps your drinks chilled for you if you just decide to sit around and sip it. I haven't managed to drop the change to make it into the locker but I'd love to sometime.

This time the atmosphere was the only thing it had going for it (well the bar  menu was still great).  Premium caviar choices were replaced with second rate stuff, portions were much smaller on the appetizers as well as main dishes, and the overall presentation was seriously lacking.  My cesar salad was brown and mostly iceberg lettuce slathered in somethinig that did not resembled cesar dressing. I had the Chicken Kiev-over cooked, greesy and gross.  My date had the tasting menu, I'll let him yelp that one, but I was unimpressed.  
On the good side: The bar selection offers an extensive vodka list as well as great mixed drinks. The dinner rolls were good. And, it's pretty neat inside, Lenin's head with the Vodka's was pretty cool.  Worth a stop for drinks, don't stay for dinner.

Red Square has a truly impressive vodka list...if you like Vodka.  They have numerous specialty martinis and cocktails as well.  Casual and hardcore alcoholics alike will undoubtedly find something to their tastes.

We ordered an appetizer and entrees.  I had the filet with crabmeat and she had the pork with asparagus and sweet potatoes.  We topped things off with a very nice creme bruele.

The food was very good with very nice presentation.  Ambience on the other hand left much to be desired.  The tables are very crowded and it was often difficult to focus on our conversation as it became a chore to try to tune out the conversations of those around us.  To say the tables are too close together would be an understatement.

Not bathroom in the actual restaurant was a real downer.  No patron of any restaurant should be told to leave the restaurant in order to go to the restroom.  Big minus points there.

Overall the food was good.  The decor was themed perfectly and very attractive.  However, the lack of any real intimate space and lack of onsite bathroom facilities necessitate the 3 star rating.",DVUHKCbcWbRSnLJGR8vbQg,0,0,3,nKrZU3CYtS7orPwT4QsVgA

As far as dinner, I ordered the Australian hazelnut crusted rack of lamb with cherry sauce.  I asked for the meat medium rare, which, in my opinion, is a great way to eat lamb.  It came and was much closer to rare, and in fact kind of grossed me out because it was so raw in the center.  Which is saying a lot, since I'm totally comfortable with rare meat, generally speaking.  It was just such a drastic difference from inside to outside, and not very appetizing.

I would recommend the siberian nachos, however, which were essentially tuna tartar on wonton chips.  These were great!  

My friend ordered the special, a filet mignon, which he said was very good.   Maybe my meat situation was just a fluke.

The best part of dinner by far was the vodka menu.  It's awesome, and a lot of fun to look through together.  I ordered the Tall Blonde Vodka, up with a twist.  I was not disappointed, that was one awesome martini.

They did the typical pour, taste thing and, for the first time in my life, I actually couldn't stand the wine. It wasn't just warm, it was hot. Like it had sat on or near a heater. I asked my coworker to taste it and he was equally put off. So we asked them to go chill it. They didn't mind at all and actually brought us a new bottle that was at an appropriate temp. Everyone has problems, it is how you make up for them that counts and they did a great job.
As for the food, we ordered a dozen oysters. Considering it is the middle of the desert, you might expect mediocre oysters, but these were killer! Served with a nice mignonette sauce.

Most of this bar is red, and there is a lovely community table in the middle of the bar that you can sit at and enjoy your martini, or if you don't feel like talking to strangers, and you think community = communism,  there are other places to enjoy your beverage as well.

The bar is swanky.  and if you sit at the bar, it is essentially one long sheet of ice, and you can enjoy your cocktail at the proper temperature  Its not the whole bar...just the top.  It keeps the drinks cold. 

The bartenders have flair.  Myself, Eric W. and a few of his friends all ordered martinis at the same time.  The bartender stacked the glasses all pyramid style, took the shakers, put them all together, and poured each individual martini at the same time, with a perfect pour, not a drop spilled.  It was awesome, and I bet the communists would have been proud.  

If you are going to spill a drink on yourself, make sure its one that smells good...just ask Eric.  He ended up smelling of key lime all evening.  It was delicious.  I just enjoyed that martini, which had plain ol' vanilla vodka, stuff to make it limey and a graham cracker crust rim.  However, if you are looking for something stiffer, more potent, more raw....this is the place.  The Russians sure do like their vodka, and this is the drink of choice here.  Just look at the menu.

There was this lady who was wearing this mink coat outside the restaurant and i thought that was a very good touch to the 'russian feel""  just hoping its faux lol. I ordered the Roasted Lamb Loin and my better half ordered their special, Filet Oscar with Lump Crabmeat sauce. My dish was exactly what I expected it to be just the right portion not too small not to big just perfect. the meat was cooked to perfection and the sauce was a great compliment to the dish. The Filet Oscar however blew my mind. Im not sure if they serve prime steaks but it doesn't matter this dish was an orchestra or wonderful textures and flavors in your mouth. The sauce had a hint horseradish and wow I would eat it again and again and again.

This place has a romantic feel as well. With the red hints of lighting and decor and dimly lit. I loved everything about it even my water haha.",K1gF80uSOKjWqE9TOAqLjQ,0,0,5,zB8CDTPO-jGI74B-jW6FpA
2723662,2010-05-23,0,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"OK, so this WAS my favorite restaurant in Vegas.  Now?  Not so much.  I just went here with a friend - we were looking forward to a great experience.  Not so this time.  The service was the worst I've ever experienced.  The food - some good, some bad.  On service I would give this 1 star, but the food saved it.  

We started with the stuffed portabello appetizer - pretty good.  I ordered a salad and my friend ordered the lobster bisque.  The lobster bisque was horrible!  Instead of a subtle lobster flavor it had a fowl fishy smell with a sharp metallic after-taste.  We sat and waited for our waiter to come by and check on us so we could return the soup - he completely ignored us.  I was confident he would return to at least offer some fresh pepper for my salad.  I was wrong.  The pepper grinder made it to other tables from other waiters, but our guy just kept returning to the bar to check the hockey score, and disappeared in the back room.  At one point I thought I caught his eye as I was trying to wave him down, but he turned around and went to another table.  Seriously, how can you just drop food in front of people and not ever go back to see if they need anything - fresh pepper, or whatever.  Finally he came by to see if we were done eating, and at that point I told him that the soup was inedible, and he took it away with no apologies.  When the manager came by, I told the manager the same, and I got ""we're looking into it"" back.  We're looking into it?  What the heck does that mean?

Now, the entrees came and they were good.  I had a steak and my friend had the Chicken Kiev.  Quite tasty.  But then I was surprised that the waiter didn't come back to check on us.  The manager did, which was nice.  The waiter came by when we were done.  

Kudos to the restaurant for a good appetizer and entrees, but shame on them for such horrible service.  Will I go back?  Hmmm...maybe after a while.  I'll give them some time to fix their service, because this used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas (I previously gave them 5 stars) and it would be a pity never to go back.  But for now I'm still shocked at the horrible service.",iW1-D-TqJ1CZ7na_D6OMwA,3,0,2,RecDCGsj9GTc1-wFRuEkrw
2739312,2017-07-24,2,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"This review is for the service, bar, and ""ice vault"". 

Not a good experience. I am trying to be fair by giving the second star. 

In town from Chicago. Have been shocked in general at the overall poor level of service and quality versus expense we have encountered during on trip.

But only Red Square has made me want to review!

We were excited when we found a Groupon for a flight experience in the ""ice vault""... sounded fun and cool (pun intended).

Figured it would be a cheesy over the top Vegas experience...

I am at a loss for businesses that sell through Groupon and then are unhappy when you actually want to redeem the Groupon.

Now- I guess at $15-30 a shot for vodkas like Russian Standard, Absolute, and Titos....There isn't enough mark up room to take some off for Groupon. 

I get making money- but come on. Not one of those bottles cost $30.

Ok- if you are way overpriced - then you are going to offer a killer service and experience- right???

Nope.

From the minute we told the bartender that we had a Groupon- it was an eye roll and attitude. 

There was already a group in the vault- so we ordered a drink to wait.

Immediately the bartender set 4- 1/2 shots in a rack on the bar and said the other group would be done in a minute.

The other group ordered another round and ended up staying in the vault for 20 more minutes. I am glad they were having a good time!

Those shots that were set up ""for us"" just sat there in the heat.

When it was our turn to go in the vault- he started to bring in these warm shots. I felt one and said they were warm and sitting in the heat too long. He said ""they're fine- and would get cold soon enough in the vault"". He refused to pour us new ones.

The vault experience is ok- you get to stand (there is only room for one chair)- and drink on a ""block of ice"" with Stalin's head inside. 

The room is unbelievably loud- and only mildly cold. More like being in a refrigerator than a freezer... nowhere cold enough to chill down the vodka shots.

We stayed in about 10-minutes- and the novelty wore off. Then it was just loud and warm vodka.

We where handed a bill as soon as we came out- I guess they figured Groupon holders would never stay for another drink!

The bill had a set gratuity of 18%... for horrible service and warm vodka.

We asked to speak with the manager about the experience- thought it would help make it better for the next guest.

He told us we should have said something about the warm vodka... which we had... and gave us a very patronizing half hearted sorry.

$98 for 2 beers, 4- 1/2 shots of low level vodka, and 10-minutes in a refrigerator!  

Ah Vegas!

This bar/lounge takes it's Russian theme very seriously. The entire space is illuminated in red, propaganda posters grace the wall & the chandelier light covers mimic the shape of ornate domes seen in St. Petersburg architecture. Kind of intense--I loved it!

The bf & I dragged our friends here so he could get his caviar on & I could get my vodka fix (in case you didn't know, I'm a vodka girl.) The bf ordered a dessert cocktail, key lime pie (a little sweet for me) & I had a bellini (champagne w/ peach vodka, about $13-$14 per cocktail.)

The good stuff: the decor and ambience is kitschy, with a big drawing of Lenin on the back wall. (When I noticed it one of my friends was like, ""I wonder why there's a picture of John Lennon in a Russian-themed restaurant,"" and we just laughed. Obviously, we had Beatles on the brain). The DRINKS ARE AWESOME. If you like vodka...you'l love this place. The vodka list is most impressive. A group of guys at a bachelor party asked if we could take pictures with the groom-to-be, and, when in Vegas, flirting with bachelors is mandatory. They sent us a round of martinis afterwards (very gentlemanly), and we were sloshed. 

The downside: the food was only okay, and very expensive. I tried a pasta with lobster and alfredo sauce that cost around $40ish and it was not that good at all. My friend had steak and it was better, but not the best either.

The server seemed as if it was inconvenient that a party of 4 walked in to eat and that she had to do ""work."" 

The Happy Hour menu was ok...discounted prices for discounted portions so not really sure it was of value.  The beef slider on the menu was $7 for A slider...yes, you are reading that correct...1 Slider...not really a shareable item, now is it?

The Steak Tartar, the salmon pizza, and the buffalo wings were good.  The Moscow Mules we all had were quite enjoyable as well.  Certain cocktails off the bar menu were discounted from $18 to $11.

""Bitter waitress"" just couldn't seem to get her attitude straight the whole time we were there and I can't explain how much service adds to your opinion of this place. I am just gonna say this one time:

*People in the service industry -- I don't care if this isn't your ""real"" job and you are really an actor/writer/director/painter/musician/dancer with a heart of gold - whatever. When you are at your place of work please remember you are an employee there, you are at a job and you really really should take whatever job you have been given seriously. If you don't like doing it, do something else! Think of it this way -- this job, this ""thing I don't really do, I'm really a ----"" is paying for you to be able to be a -----. Be grateful! Do not be bitter or stupid and waste my experience and money with your sour attitude. Be responsible, be an adult - be good at your job! It's not rocket science.*

.......

OK! Sorry! *Steps down off the Lenin statue* Back to the real review....

We had two flights - the USSR and the Best of the Motherland. Eight shots total for a group of six and we all just passed each one around and tasted with a sip or so. Actually, if you do it that way it ends up being a pretty good deal as the flights are in the forty to fifty dollar range.  Then my group decided to get a couple more drinks and all in all the bill was about $100. Not bad, not bad at all!  One drink in particular, their apple martini, was made with whiskey, not vodka and I will tell you what - it converted me! Honestly, it changes the flavor of the drink and for me personally its for the better.  (and it is always a hard fight whether I am more in love with whiskey or vodka at the moment)

I found a couple new vodkas I loved, ( I would love to share, but the website doesn't have a menu) we started the night off right for the newlyweds and although we missed the vodka room (where I guess you get to wear furs and do shots) I would say Red Square did us right --

I first stumbled upon this place two weeks after they opened and have consistently enjoyed the dining experience (about 8 times in total). The last time I was there was a week ago.

Restaurant / Decor:
As you approach Red Square, two things will stand out, one, a huge statue of Lenin that looks like it has lived there for 50 years with all the trappings of pigeon minus the head and a large Russian stylized casement window to a freezer that holds some of the most exotic vodkas on the market today. The decor has changed some since the first year of operation to help accommodate their popularity but it has not significantly taken away from the overall experience. The furniture is all antiqued and the walls are designed as if it is pealing back decades of propaganda. The lush red velvet curtains and huge chandeliers makes it out to be a place where the Kremlin elite would come to have a drink with less than subtle hints of it's past as maybe a church or where Bolshevik revolutionaries might have hung out. The restaurant is very clean. Relatively accessible within Mandalay Bay Casio (casino's are hard to navigate in general). Though it has little online presence. 

Specialty / Favorites:
The drinks!  They host the largest selection of vodka's I have ever experienced and I love vodka. I have been exposed to new vodka's for the first time there by ordering tasting flights (explained below). They also have an awesome selection of cocktails from savory to sweet, all worth tasting. 

Food / Drink:
They have had good consistency for many years though I would be remise if I did not say this last time was not as good as past dining experiences there.  

There menu is relatively consistent with a few changes here and there though I am not sure if it is seasonal or otherwise.  

For starters the Steak Tartare (raw beef, onion, capers, dijon mustard-anchovy sauce, creme fraiche, with melba toast) is fabulous, prepared at the table and good to the last bite. The Lobster Bisque has not been consistent and I have been disappointed with it, though the Chilled Lobster Salad (with cold lobster, tomatoes, baby greens, basil oil and lemon creme fraiche) was really awesome though I think it is a seasonal dish since I did not see in on the menu this time. I personally always order Caviar Smothered Blini (a large Russian blini smothered in creme fraiche, American sturgeon caviar and herbed beurre blanc, a potato pancake with caviar and a creamy sauce).  

As for the entrees, the classics are all very solid; Chicken Kiev (stuffed with herbs, cheese and butter, served with vegetable rice pilaf and a mushroom and port reduction) and Seared Ahi Tuna (warm Yukon potato salad and chilled asparagus in a spicy tomato dipping sauce) are awesome; the Stroganoff, Roquefort Filet Mignon (potato pure with roasted garlic and red wine sauce) and Salmon Kulebyaka (salmon seared with dill on a puff pastry with a dill saffron buerre blanc) are also favorites, though I don't like Salmon all that much so it is a shared opinion. 

Deserts... The chocolate cake was really good. Sorry, I am normally not very sober by this time.

But the real reason to go eat at the Red Square is to drink at the Red Square. It is truly all about the vodka. I love vodka. It is one of my favorite alcohols and they offer something here that I had never seen before, Vodka Flights. You can choose from several Vodka Flights, based by geography, ie, American or Russian, by flavorings, potato vodkas or exotic vodkas, etc. You get 4 shots served in a red block of ice. To best describe this you have to imagine a bright red cube of ice with 4 holes for the shot glasses, it is like nothing I have ever experience before. But if raw vodka doesn't float your boat, there are 3 pages of fabulous cocktails that are honestly some of the best drinks I have ever had. The showmanship at the bar is worth ordering five or six alone. 

Service:
This is not 5 five star dining though there is a real attempt to be very professional and take the extra steps to make sure you have all that you need as you would find in a more formal environment. I have found the staff to be attentive, especially with water, which helps with the impending hangover. The wait staff's description of the menu offerings have been accurate and their opinions helpful. 

Hospitality:
The staff is all very friendly and welcoming. There seems to be a pride in their work and most of the wait staff has a passion for food. I have never felt stupid asking a question about the menu.

Value (price vs. overall experience):
Setting expectations is very important. As experience has taught me, there is no such thing as value in Las Vegas. So in other words I always expect to spend more in Vegas for the same quality or less than I find else where.

Red Square was the perfect example of the facade that is Las Vegas.  Beautiful themed ambiance, with little substance to back it up.

The menu has pages upon pages of cocktails, and on the surface it appears impressive. But read the descriptions, and it reveals cheap ingredients. 

Moskovskaya vodka is listed in several drinks. Sounds impressive? It's that $8 bottle from Trader Joe's. You can have a shot of it in a cocktail here for $13. Worth it? Depends on how much you value the cocktail over the 10 seconds of the guy pouring it with great flourish into a pyramid of glasses. 
I lost count of the number of cocktails using Sierra Mist. 

We got the tasting menu, at $65 each +$10 for foie gras. The food was good, but overshadowed (pun intended) by such a dark interior we could hardly see it. Dark restaurants don't do service to the dishes, it makes me think there's something to hide about the food. 
The most our server could offer up by way of describing the dishes and highlighting its best qualities was to say the plating was ""really cool, huh."" 

My feeling is that Red Square doesn't appreciate its own food. And we walked out, $200 poorer, feeling the same.

The vodka vault was really just a gimmick (and a ripoff, depending on how deep your pockets are).   You basically pay 200+ dollars for 1 bottle of vodka and you get to go inside this room that's basically like a freezer (10 degrees).  The missing head of the statue out front is encased in this plastic cube made to look like ice.  This is basically your table.   There was one ornate chair in the room and the room itself was tiny.

But on to the food...the steak tartare was excellent. Some of the best that I have had - really.

I think I must be the only person who has actually been to Red Square for food...!  Where do you go with a week's notice and 11 of your closest friends?  Red Square was able to seat us with a 9 p.m. reservation which was not too shabby considering that we weren't planning weeks in advance.  

The table we had was great - a little tucked away in the corner which was a good place to sit since we actually wnated to hear each other and catch up.  The area we had was roomy, and the table was nicely set.

There were lots of great items on the menu, and the server pushed the rocquefort cheese filet mignon which I gladly ordered.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share - fried calamari, tuna tartare, crab cake and the Siberian nachos.  I had an opportunity to taste all but the Siberian nachos because those went quickly...which makes me think they were very good.  My favorite was the tuna tartare which was delicious, but I'm a sucker for tuna tartare (and apparently for filet mignon).  Everybody was delighted with their meals - I think we all ordered beef!

The server told us that Red Square is the largest vodka distributor in North America which is pretty darn impressive (if that's true); they had all sorts of flavored vodkas.  I tried to cocktails - the pomegrenate martini and the eqiuvalent of a mojito...but made with vodka.  Both were great!

There is a cute little freezer/icebox room at the front of the restaurant where you can drink vodka in a freezer.  I'm not sure what the novelty is besides the fact that you're drinking in a freezer...and wearing dead animals (Red Square will provide mink coats and hats for the party).  It seemed kind of interesting but I was not about to hop into a 5 degree room to drink vodka.  But, I think it was something around $200 for a bottle of vodka for you and your friends to taste...

Funniest moment of the night (or at least up until that point in the night), a couple of girls walked up to our table and asked to join us mid-meal because they thought the table could use a few girls.  Granted, it was a party of 9 guys and 3 girls, but the girls at the table were a little insulted (I didn't care too much...but then again, they weren't trying to pick up on my husband).  Anyway, props to the girls for their bold and aggressive behavior...but man, that is ROUGH.  You are really putting yourself out there to join a dinner part of friends mid-meal...

We started with Siberian nachos consisting of wonton chips topped with caviar, wasabi, smoked salmon, and creme fraiche.   The interplay of flavors in this appetizer was enhanced two fold when we paired it with the restaurant's version of a Bloody Mary.  The drink was awesome- it was spicy, accented by a green olive stuffed with blue cheese poured over the smoothest vodka I've ever had.  Ever!

For dinner I had the Salmon Kubeyalka (sic) which consisted of a buerre blanc sauce beneath a puff pastry topped with mushroom risotto.  On top of the risotto was the flakiest and most tender piece of Salmon resting beneath another layer of puff pastry which was adorned with a hard boiled egg white filled with caviar.  

Our waiter was very accommodating, very attentive to the details, and extremely knowledgeable about every aspect of our dining experience.

So I decided to try it again and see if they are consistent. They have gone way downhill. First off the ginger beer did not taste like fever tree and if it was, then it was very old it had a gross aftertaste. I have tried every brand and it actually tasted like they were using Reeds which is my least favorite brand. They also started using toto's vodka which to me tastes cheap. We ordered off the Pre-Fixe menu again and this time I got the lobster bisque which was really good but also very spicy, I got the chicken Kiev and they brought me a butter knife to cut it up and that did not do the job it was so tough I couldn't cut it so more than 3/4 of it was left on the plate. Don't even get me started on the dessert. Again they said it was vanilla ice cream. I declined. Then the server came back out and said actually they had lemon sorbet that night so I decided I'd give it a try since it came with dinner. The second the spoon hit my mouth I regretted my decision. The lemon sorbet was literally I think, the same vanilla ice cream from one year ago that had probably gone bad but they wanted to still serve so they put some lemon zest in there to try and pass it off as lemon sorbet. It was the most powdery disgusting ice cream mess I have ever tasted. I stopped short of spittinf it out, but only because this is supposed to be a nice place.

I came here for my wedding dinner. Staying in the Mandalay Bay, we wanted a place which could accomodate gluten intolerants, a vegetarian, children, and a steak loving husband. Red Square was literally able to accomodate all off one menu.

We had a table for 12 which I was pleasantly unexpected was semi-private. The lighting was adjustable which was awesome as we got to somewhat pick our mood. We ordered a few bottles of wine from the extensive wine list and each bottle was amazing. Somewhat annoyingly though, the gluten intolerants and vegetarian had to take turns with the special menu as they only brought the one. 

I skipped appies (having to not have my dress burst at the seams and all), and had the Filet Mignon for my entree. I'm not a huge red meat eater, but this was a fantastic dish I would order again.  My husband was in steak heaven. All children ate. Gluten intolerants (myself included) were happy), and even the vegatarian was impressed. Dessert was Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee which I now regularly crave and must go back there just to eat.

If you are looking for food indicative of the people and their culture, you have come to the wrong place.  The Siberian Nachos (smoked salmon, wasabi cream, and chives on top of a wanton chip--surely a traditional staple of the Gulag) were surprisingly good.  My entree of Strozapretti Stroganoff, however, was far from anything special and, to top it off, came to the table seeming like it had been sitting around for a while.  Orders of caviar come with a full array of traditional condiments--blini and toast points, creme fraiche, crumbled egg whites and egg yolks from a hard boiled egg, chives, and onions.

We returned to Red Square to fully indulge in the restaurant's vodka menu--which is extensive.  We took a pass on paying ""bottle service"" prices to visit the private vodka vault and instead ordered shot after shot after shot after...you get the picture.  Red Square is definitely the place to go if you're looking to try a lot of different vodkas.  2 oz. shots were in the $11 to $30 range (for the high end vodkas).

That being said, I am very much a foodie and adore the fact that in NYC we have all the best restaurants in the world at our fingertips..HOWEVER, my absolute favorite part of our Vegas trip every year is our annual trip to Red Square. This restaurant NEVER disapoints. The food is absolutely outstanding and is time and time again, the best meal we have in Vegas. Last year we went to Cut, N9NE steakhouse, and a number of other 5 star Vegas restaurants and they could not compare to the quality of the food we had at Red Square.

Our favorites are: the Siberian Nachos, the pelmeni (which are small, melt in your mouth beef dumplings, the borscht and the Beef strozapretti and the Red Square filet mignon (which are beyond delicious). And the drinks, of course, are incredble.

The atomosphere is sexy and romantic, with just enough kitsch to make it fun.

I'm on the fence about this place, or should I say, ""on the wall."" Ok, Russian/Commie jokes aside....

Headless Lenin out front of the Red Square has finally won me over after years of enticing me to visit each time I walked by, all thanks to their happy hour that's now daily from 4pm-7pm. My friend and I met up here on a Saturday evening for pre-concert drinking and noshing. First impression of the restaurant: it's a cross between a run down church that was converted into a communist hideout and an upscale bordello -- I can only imagine. It's on the gaudy side, but I actually dig the decor. 

The place was rowdy and packed with patrons who were mainly hanging around the bar area eating and watching games on the mounted televisions. We were lucky to find seating at the corner by a window. Our server gave us the happy hour menu and a separate dessert menu upon request. 

Duck Fat Fries: French fries fried in duck fat topped with shredded parmesan cheese. The fries come with lemon aioli and tomato jam dipping sauces. Fries fried in duck fat sounds deliciously gluttonous, but I think the flavor -- to me -- needs to be acquired. Both dipping sauces were good. I thought the tomato jam tasted similar to cocktail sauce, but it complemented the fries as opposed to the aioli which did a better job at masking the duck fat. 

Summer Blueberry and Peach Pie: I was anticipating a slice of pie, but I actually received a personal size pie with a small scoop of ice cream on top. The crust was flaky and had a slight crunch and there was more blueberry than peach filling. The sweetness of the pie alone was perfect and didn't give me a sugar jolt. One downside about this dessert is the side of caramel sauce that I didn't bother using. It was in a separate pouring container, but I wasn't able to pour any caramel sauce onto my pie because it was solid....

Service was slow, but overall it was fine. Our only issue was tracking down our server to pay our bill because we had to head off. However, it was almost a full house on that Saturday evening. Slow service is expected.

Although it was a busy happy hour, a return visit is likely, but it might have to happen on a weekday.

There are two major problems with the new setup. First, the price point is much too high. We ordered two shots of mid range Polish vodka, a crab cake appetizer, and a caviar sampler. The caviar was a trio of domestic caviars, with the basic trimmings; between the three types, we received less than half of an ounce of caviar. These items together cost $150.00 plus tip. In comparison, when we went to Red Square before, we could get two shot of Russian platinum premium vodka and a half ounce of good quality black caviar with all of the trimmings for $35.00 Sticker shock much? Second, the new menu is standard American. It may be well prepared, but there is no reason to choose Red Square over any other restaurant in Vegas. It is boring. In contrast, the old menu was distinctive. The caviar came with blinis as well as toast points and the other trimmings. You could order a delightful perogis in consomm√© and several other Russian dishes in small sizes or as full meals. Red Square used to be a distinctive destination in its own right, but no longer. I will miss it.

My friends and I used to love going to Red Square. In fact, we would make it a point to visit on every trip to Vegas (several times a year). Unfortunately, now that the restaurant has been bought out, we have no reason to return.",skx2qKrW_dWI3eosYuPMYg,4,0,1,jvwiH5YVkfBFft1WRDzYKg

My husband brought me here on Valentine's Day for dinner this year. When I first walked into this gothic style restaurant, I was immediately excited. I really enjoy dining in different settings, especially if it makes it seem like you're in a different place. I felt as though I had left the country and stepped into a restaurant in Moscow. 

The service was excellent. Everyone was friendly, but not over the top too nice there were minimal interruptions.

Our first trip was a late night visit. To my supreme delight Red Square was having a reverse happy hour: 50% off of drinks from the cocktail list!  (I think this is available on weekdays from 11pm to 2am). I tried a few things on the drink menu including the ""Jewel of Russia,"" a delicious refreshing fruit infused vodka. Fantastic! I'm thinking of trying to find this online so I can buy some for happy hour at home.

Our second trip to Red Square was for Cavi Hour. Every day from 4-6 you can go buy two Imperia vodka drinks and with this you receive 1 oz of Petrossian caviar including the full spread of toast points, hard boiled eggs, chopped red onions, and creme fraiche. A beautiful delicious spread, and the best caviar I've ever had. (Granted I haven't had a whole lot, but I've had some and this was amazing).

After a previous day of gambling on food and hitting the jackpot, the house won this one. Red Square looks great in an ironic soft of way, with busts of Lenin and workers revolution posters in a shrine to capitalism. 
We chose the prix fixe menu because that would give us the greatest variety. It was pricey, but we hoped worth it, and we could share. Caviar appetizer was overwhelmed by sugar cookie wrap, and the foie gras also battled against the brioche and sweet berry jam. I know this is a current way of presenting foie gras, but the balance was off. 
Salt and pepper calamari was barely a step above TGIFriday food. The filet mignon was a tender, but slathered with an overwhelming blue cheese sauce. My Beef Stroganoff (the only thing on the entire menu that can be called Russian) was tasty but meh. I could have been having this meal at any old place and for much less. Same thoughts for the dessert.
Yes, they have a huge vodka menu. The cocktail menu, though two pages, didn't have too many surprises. I nixed anything with pre-made mixes and soda (Sierra Mist!!) and narrowed it down to only a few to choose. The one I got was okay, nothing to write Moscow home about.

I was staying at Mandalay Bay, so the location was convenient, about a 5 minute walk from the door of my room to the restaurant. It was almost dead on a Monday around 7, and we got in just in time to grab a happy hour drink. We sat at the bar until they had a table ready for us, and the bar is made of long piece of ice with vodka bottles frozen in! It's pretty cool (literally) and I couldn't stop digging into the ice. I had the KGB, which was delicious, and I can't remember what my companion had.
TIP: check in for a free well drink!

Once we were moved to our cozy booth, which was romantically lit by fringed lamps, we were greeted by our server and took both of his recommendations for meals - the dumplings for a starter, and the short rib stroganoff for our entree. I didn't know what to expect with either dish, so I was pleasantly surprised when the dumplings came out and they were delicious crispy pierogies! Unfortunately, there was an odd number of the dumplings, so it was a fight over the last one. I thought that these were a must-order.

The entree took a strangely long time to arrive in a restaurant that was so dead. I highly recommend the short rib stroganoff, though. The short rib was so succulent and the mushrooms were so flavorful and there was a dollop of some sort of creamy cheese on top of the noodles that was so decadent and it really tied this dish together.

The food was delicious. I had their short rib stroganoff and my husband had the surf and turf special.

Went there with a friend this weekend.  We researched ahead for a good-very good restaurant at a reasonable price.   I didn't want a fancy French restaurant, and the menu at Red Square looked good.  I ordered the special for the evening - steak topped with crab meat and dressed with horseradish sauce.   DELICIOUS!    OMG, I am very picky about steak and honestly, this was the best I ever had in my life.  The manager was attentive to our table throughout the evening.  The steak was prime cut and came from South Dakota.   All I can tell you is that my friend and I had a wonderful evening with a delicious meal.  My special cost $50, but it was totally worth it.    Although next time I go to Vegas, I would like to try a different restaurant, I would definately go back if someone in my group wanted to go.   Our cost for two dinners, plus wine, no dessert was $124.00 - not bad.  Again, totally worth it.

I'm a Gibson fan (vodka martini w/ onion) so I asked the bartender what brand he recommended for a his favorite vodka martini served up..  I was introduced to Zyr (still not available in California) and this has since been my favorite brand.. Its filtered 9 times and distilled 5 times and it is smooth as water.

My server was Mary and she saw to it that I got my iced tea quickly and she gave me plenty of time to look over the menu and then answer some questions.  For an appetizer, I got the Siberian nachos.  This is a fun way of doing nachos in a different manner.  There are five, very thinly sliced,waffle potato chips each with a nice slice of very good smoked salmon.  Topping each is a small dollop of caviar and sour cream.  The potato slices are so delicate, you can't pick up the chip and eat it with the salmon on top.

The main course had to be beef stroganoff.  This was made differently than I've ever had before but it was no less good.  In fact, this was the star of the meal and I recommend anyone eating here try the stroganoff.  It's a braised short rib that was extremely tender accompanied by wild mushroom tagliatelle.  There is some truffle flavored ricotta placed between the pasta and the beef.  Unlike what we normally think of stroganoff, this one was not heavy on sour cream to make a gravy for the beef.  Rather, the ricotta simply becomes blended a bit with the very good juices from the meat.  I like their way of doing stroganoff.

I took Mary's advice for dessert--it's actually what I was going to order anyway.  This was good but was a bit of a disappointment.  The strawberry baked Alaska wasn't made nor served like a traditional baked Alaska which could have been OK except for one thing.  The base was a thin sponge cake with some fresh strawberry slices.  This was topped with some strawberry ice cream, and then the whole thing was mounded--not with meringue--but with marshmallow fluff that had been browned.  When I put my spoon to what I thought was meringue I learned by the very thick consistency how wrong I was.  The marshmallow was overwhelming in texture and in sweetness!  I was glad to get below to the strawberry ice cream to offset some of the cloying sweetness.

Service during dinner was excellent and Mary was a very pleasant server who made the dinner pleasant.  The runners made sure my iced tea was refilled as soon as I finished my glass.

I like the room with it's Soviet themes.  This starts with the beheaded statue of Vladimir I. Lenin at the entrance.  The head was cut off and is in a freezer in the vodka tasting lounge where you get bottle service.  Above the door inside is CCCP for the Soviet Union and there's a hammer and sickle vodka vault sign by the bar and I could see part of the one mural in the bar/lounge area about a delegate--that's all I could read of the Russian letters.  While passing time between courses, I did notice that on the wall above the side of the bar, they have misspelled the Russian word for Square in their Red Square.  Perhaps it's the teacher in me and maybe it was my tough Russian professor in undergraduate school. 

Finally, the restaurant is very vibrant--sound wise.  I wouldn't plan on having a quiet conversation with your table mate.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,7,3,9Zf8kxsNjRJjlL2mucJecQ

The atmosphere of this place is probably great...when Rumjungle isn't open next door.

All we could hear in our booth was the thumping bass of the rude neighbors next door. 

I know I'm in a ""Russian"" restaurant (I put that in quotes because I don't really see anything much different from a regular steakhouse), but I don't care much for Vodka, my friends do, though. So, I regrettably ordered the Czar Margarita. It was horrible. 

In my experience, Mandalay Bay seems to specialize in poorly mixed drinks. I think the casino cocktail waitresses mix the drinks for the restaurants as well because each time I have had a mixed drink at a Mandalay Bay restaurant, it has sucked.

Our bartender even got in on our discussions since we learned that he goes to EDC 9 years running now; small world.

We arrived during happy hour, so we took advantage of their drink and food specials. First the good:

I ordered the KGB cocktail (Ketel One Vodka, Fresh Cucumber & Watermelon, Chili) and it was delicious and refreshing. I'll admit this was one of the better cocktails I've had in a while, as all the components worked perfectly together.

(I'll also note that the happy hour price is $11, which seems steep but is a veritable bargain compared to the normal $18 price tag.)

Now the bad: We wanted to get a snack, so we went with the Oysters on the Half Shell (Tobiko Caviar, Soy Mignonette, 3 Per Order). First of all, I have to note that the ""3 Per Order"" warning was *not* on the menu and I certainly wouldn't have gotten it if I'd known there were only three. It meant I only got to eat one, since I offered to let my dining companion eat the third one. One oyster!

I love the dim red lighting.  The chandeliers are gorgeous.  The booths, walls, and all around decor perfectly create the spectacular ambience.

I ordered the stroganoff and it was delicious.

In order to get the true Red Square experience, you must purchase a bottle of vodka which earns you automatic entry into the Vodka Vault.  I think the cheapest bottle is $150, but it's well worth it.  You get a Vodka Goddess who assists you with picking your bottle and escorting you into the vault, plus you get free unlimited mixers with it.  There were 4 of us so we all had plenty of vodka tonics (or martinis or whatever you prefer) with dinner, then saved 2 shots of vodka each for when we went in the Vodka Vault.  

The Vodka Vault is a below zero freezer where they keep an array of these fine bottles of clear liquor.  Once you're ready to enter the vault, your Goddess will help you slip into your mink coat, and optional mink hat, and escort you inside.  Outside of the restaurant is the statue of Lenin's body, minus the head.  Inside the vault, Lenin's head awaits you where you are encouraged to take your vodka shot(s) off of.  It was really, really fun.

Then everyone kept watching us rolling there eyes at us and the manager kept close to our spot and kept on talking about us.

First of all if you like Martinis or Vodka brace yourself for over 500 different ones on the list.  The wait staff is great about suggesting and they have Vodka Flights.  This is a must stop place before going out at night.  If you have a group of 4 or more do a bottle service.  They take you to the Frozen Room Vault and you can finish your bottle at your table during dinner.

We got there the last few seconds before happy hour was over so we went off the bartenders recommendation for appetizers and drinks.  

The meatballs- wow these were amazing, 4 meatballs covered in incredibly yummy red marinara with some kind of cheese I have no idea how to spell.  These were a favorite of the night.

Chicken lollipop wings- I was madly in love with these and even planned a Vegas trip for them to learn they were no longer serving them.  Well, they are back.  This time they are more like a spicy chicken wing which for a wimp like me can be challenging but I did it.  The tender meat on them are like no other place.  

Sliders- You only get one per order but surprisingly that is all you need unless someone else wants to try it.  I woke up today (okay, this afternoon, its Vegas) and immediately thought of the sliders.  It is surprisingly filing and full of flavor.  A definite for any slider fan.

Last but not least we went on the bartenders choice for drinks and I tried my first Moscow Mule.  Lets just say that once I tried it, I stayed with it all night it was so refreshing, not sweet or bitter, and went down easy.  I will be making these at home from now on.

4451461,2013-09-10,1,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"Pre-gaming before a concert, my friend and I decided to give Red Square a shot.

I'm giving it a 4-star mainly for their happy hour. I think their happy hour pricing and the selection the offer for happy hour is really good for it being a restaurant in a casino on the strip. Their food menu actually has some good finds - salmon pizza, duck fat fries, meatballs, kobe beef sliders, etc. And the prices, again, for being on the strip are not bad. My friend and I shared the Duck Fat Fries with a side of aioli and tomato jam. Each dipping sauce added a little different taste to the fries. These fries are definitely an acquired taste and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone just desiring regular old french fries. Never the less I though they were tasty and the tomato jam was truly a different type of taste, one I've never really experienced before.

Drink prices are also pretty decent. I had two glasses of pinot noir ($12). There are also well drinks and about four beers on the happy hour as well.

My friend also ordered a blackberry and peach pie off the dessert menu. It came out as a round little personal pie, not a slice with a scoop of ice cream and caramel. Um, the caramel came out in a little pot and was solidified. I honestly think they forgot to warm it up so it would pour before they brought out the plate. The pie itself was quite tasty, nice crust, and the fruit inside was not overly sweet.

The one thing here is service is a bit on the slow side, especially since it is packed during happy hour. My friend and I had to wave down the busser to get our check to our waitress who hadn't been back to our table to retrieve it. As we were trying to get to a concert this miffed us a bit. So just remember that when dining here. 

Overall I would come back here for happy hour and reccomend it to anyone seeking a happy hour that is a bit ""different"" on the strip.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,2,4,u8rkaG4NEv3E83P00-bj3Q

The best drink by far is the spicy bloody mary special complete with several cheese-filled olives which can be had during happy hour for $5.  Also they serve some amazing sliders during that time from 4-7 which are also $5 along with truffle fries.

Food wise there just wasn't really anything that particularly impressed me. I had the oysters to start which were good, but not great. For an entree I had the scallops which were super disappointing mainly due to the portion size. The dish only came with 3 scallops atop a huge bed of mushroom risotto. The flavors were good, but come on only 3 scallops for an entree? I felt pretty ripped off. For dessert we shared the cake pops which were also very unexciting. The flavor was kind of dry and bland.

4709020,2018-02-04,1,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"I have now been to Red Square twice. My interest in the place is because my parents both immigrated from the Soviet Union so I am very familiar with Russian food and I thought coming here would be a familiar and comforting experience. However, the food is very Americanized and I think I now understand how a Chinese person feels going to Chinese restaurants in the US. You want to order what you're familiar with eating at home but it's all American food with small traces of the food you know. They use ingredients used in Russian cooking such as dill, buckwheat, potatoes, salmon, etc. but it's really not at all what I would expect. As an example, their Heritage Charcuterie on the menu states it's ""recipes passed down from generation to generation"" and imagine my surprise when it was all Italian meats such as salami and prosciutto. I imagined a family recipe pate and delicious imported meats from Eastern Europe but that's not at all what came out.

Furthermore, the prices are crazy! Even after I accepted the fact that this is just a gimicky restaurant, the quality of food didn't justify the prices charged. I love fine dining but I also don't like overpaying for something that is average. My husband ordered the filet and lobster special and he said he could have gotten better filet at the supermarket.

Finally, their vodka list is embarrassing based on the fact that that's their whole thing. They advertise their vodka cellar tasting experience but none of the vodkas on the list were anything I couldn't get at a liquor store. I was hoping they'd have my favorite Ukrainian vodka that I go out of my way to my local Russian store to get but they just had a limited list of Russian and Polish vodkas that are pretty mainstream at this point in time. I don't know how they feel they can advertise their vodkas when they don't even carry anything special that would make it worth a vodka connoisseur going out of their way to come here.

Drinks: Husband had the Root of Evil and I had the Bad Apple. Both are whiskey based drinks so if you don't like whiskey don't get them. Otherwise... Very good cocktails and highly recommended! 

Dinner: We ordered the combo cheese and meat platter, split the beef stragonoff, and mashed potatoes with caviar. Platter was great but pretty standard (how do you mess that up?).

Can't go wrong with a refreshing gingery lime drink served in a copper cup. We also got a complimentary shot of vodka with our drinks. How cool is that?!

Overall, the service was ok. It took us forever to get a server with the iPad menu and then to order drinks. Once we got our first drink, they became attentive and service drastically improved.

Maybe because the entrance looks like the entrance into a cold frigid fortress, or maybe the idea of a Russian restaurant inspired thoughts of strange food ending in ""kiev"" that I wouldn't like.  All of this was completely illogical, of course, as was proven to me one night during a girls night out.

Taking a seat at their ice bar, the bartender asked me what I wanted to drink.  I had no idea where to even start with their HUGE selection of vodkas surrounding me.  He asked me what my favorite fruit was and so I thought of the first thing that came to mind...strawberry!  He started mixing a couple of vodkas together and poured his concoction into a martini glass.  He added a fresh raspberry and blueberry to my drink and I took a sip. Yum!  My bf had a classic martini himself.  

We perused over the menu and although I was tempted by the caviar, I had to say no.  I was still full from my huge meal upstairs. 

We were then invited to the vault.  Putting on the crazy hats and the crazy coats, we proceeded into this ice chamber for a shot of vodka.  I went for the Mango flavored vodka.  It went down smooth... 

I should mention...I'm not usually such a lightweight.  But as I started drinking my martini, I could feel it...damn, I'm getting buzzed already!  Wtf! So, you can imagine I was feeling pretty damn good by the time we left, and that was only after one martini and one shot.  Sheesh. 

Anyhow, when you're there...ask for JD to take care of you.  He's the cute Asian bartender with the funky glasses and the tats all over his arms.  Ask him to make something special for you! 

Overall, for the brief time I was at Red Square, I had such an interesting night.  We met the most interesting of people and witnessed the most interesting of things.  I'll definitely go back for some caviar and a seat at their ice bar.

Update! 03/03/08 - Has it been so long since I've experienced the vodka vault?  We're lucky to swing by during their ""Cavi Hour"", which runs everyday from 4 pm to 6 pm.  With the purchase of two Imperia Vodka Cocktails per person, you receive 1 oz of caviar to enjoy while you sip your drinks.  What a decadent treat!  

I enjoyed a mixed concoction of vodka and a bunch of fruity stuff.  The BF and another friend had their vodka straight up.  The real winner was their Russian Mary!  My oh my and what yum!  This mix has been sitting around for a little while and has some serious hotness to it.  They mix it with their Bloody Mary mix and top it off with a couple of blue cheese stuffed olives!  So delicious!  (And yes, I was getting a nice little buzz from here!)

Their caviar comes with triangle toasts, blinis, creme fraiche, red onions, hard-boiled egg whites and egg yolks, and chives.  And yes, I'm one of those people who would rather eat such loveliness without all the condiments 'cuz caviar just tastes so good!

I do have to make it a better point to come here more often, and especially to take advantage of their Cavi Hour!  What a fabulous idea!

We did it just to say we did something a bit different than ordering a round in a bar. And since we are all very much into vodka, we wanted to try some different kinds.

SITREP

I found myself hitting the Happy Hour here at Red Square (located at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino) and it did not disappoint.  

THE SETUP

My sweet dance partner and I were jone'sin for some munchies before we hit a dance competition event, but there was not going to be any food there.

Interestingly enough, we had just talked about our uncles - how they both hail from Idaho - and hers is sportsman who catches Salmon from the Snake River.  So as we arrived into Red Square, two (2) menu items just JUMPED OUT at us, like 2 Chinooks, and so we ""jumped on them"", so to speak.

LE MENU

The items had Salmon on them!  So for us, this was meant to be:

(1)  I saw the Siberian Nachos, which consisted of Salmon, Crispy Potato Gautrette, Sour Cream, and Caviar, believe it not.  Absolutely delicious, and probably the most singularly different nachos I've ever had; and then,

(2)  We were BOTH intrigued by the Smoked Salmon Pizza, which consisted of generous strips of smoked salmon & pickled red onions.  [The flavor of the pickled red onions  was a bit much for Cassandra, but we resolved that issue by picking them off.]

The menu is authentic Russian.  Western dishes such as smoked salmon atop won ton chips with wasabi cream and tobiko (very refreshing and delicious) sit next to a classic steak tartare.

Stick to the old school classics.  The seared foie with baked apples served on French toast with a warm, apple butter and huckleberry gastrique and garnished by  smoky, oily bacon is sublime.

Their cavi-hour is a good deal - during certain hours, it's a half ounce of caviar free when you get two drinks made with Russian Standard Vodka.  Sure - the drinks are not cheap - it's Las Vegas - but the Caviar actually makes this an excellent deal.

They also have a small vodka vault.  Apparently, they rent out storage lockers in there, but you can also buy a bottle of vodka and spend some time in the vault in fur coats doing shots off the top of the decapitated head of the statue of Lenin they have out front.  They let you buy a half bottle ( still about $100 ) if there's only two of you, and you can take the part you don't finish home with you.  It's kind of cold in there, but a cool experience.

Service 1/5
Atmosphere 2/5

We went into this place with eyes open.  After all there aren't many ""Russian Cuisine"" places around and we were pretty stoked.  Our food hosts who selected this place drink Vodka with every meal so I thought maybe they'd get a discount being honorary Russians after all, but no.

You get a menu and a drink menu like most places.  There are many kinds of vodka available.  If you are going to pick just one and roll with it (and have vodka) then go with the Espresso martini.  I found the dirty vodka martini to be meh.

I had borscht (must be experienced, but if you've had it...nothing new to see here.  Didn't finish it), Pierogi (yum) and Stroganoff (yum yum).  The group had a few types of caviar and were not disappointed, very good.

The whole meal was paced very poorly, to the point that it became a major distraction.  From the time we arrived (though we did have apps) to the time we ordered entrees was about an hour.  We didn't order extra drinks or anything really just sat and waited and munched the caviar.  Also, there wasn't much direction given like - ""I recommend these things together"" or ""We're known for this.""  Given that we are dealing with fairly unfamiliar food choices, I would have appreciated a little more direction.  

Finally, the place was just loud and the music was generic.  As much effort as was put into the decoration of the place, it just seemed sterile and uninvested in the Russian concept.

Meatballs : Cabbage-wrapped, Roasted Tomato & Bulgarian Feta. Wow! Extremely flavorful meatballs, extraordinarily juicy being cooked in the cabbage. Highly recommended! 

""Gorba"" Chop : 14oz Berkshire Pork Chop, Carrot & Dill. As delcious as it looks, sizeable chop resting in a tasty puree!

Georgian Cheese Bread : Bulgarian Feta, Farmer's Cheese & Farm Egg. Outstanding, perfect amount of cheese with a nice crunch on the crust/edges. Highly recommended!

Mushroom Julienne : Cheese & Cream. Powerful flavors, umami like seasonings...recommended!!

Brussels Sprouts : Bacon, Grain Mustard & Honey. Stop the car...you read the ingredients right...awesome combination of unique flavors coming together so well!

He was so kind! so right away, I liked this place. Customer service was amazing, attentive, and kind. Waters were always filled and he always came to check on us. Great server you have red square!

For food!!! We ordered the calamari as our appetizer. nice and crisp just the way i like it... with an amazing spicy pepper sauce. my fatty self was drooling for more! also had some goat cheese salad... at first i thought it was strange...but the more i ate it..the more i loved it! had a lemony dressing with onions, apples, and fried goat cheese. everything blended well together. Now for my entree... i ordered the filet mignon with a side of the smoked mashed potatoes. Holy cow was it cooked to perfection. The two steak sauces they give you are exquisite.

Came here for some shareables before Britney Spears and everything was so freaking delicious! 

The smoked salmon pizza is more like a little flatbread, garnished with pickled red onion, caviar, and capers, all on top a thin layer of creme fraiche. SO GOOD. Flavors all work beautifully together, and salmon has a very delicate smoked flavor. 

The steak tartar bites were equally as delicious, served on little rounds of toasted bread brushed lightly with truffle oil. So simple yet so yummy. 

Finally, saved the best for last - the meatballs in 12 hour gravy. If you get anything, get these. Without a doubt some of the best meatballs I've ever had - and at a Russian joint? Who knew?! Meatballs are a generous portion served with ricotta and large pieces of grilled garlic bread. Heavenly goodness.

I was so full by the end, but had there been anymore of anything I would've eaten it because it was all so freaking good - and happy hour prices are fantastic. 

Drinks are expensive so be prepared - cocktails run $18/piece and some vodkas run upwards of $60 for rocks pours. However the entire place is just a great experience so it's worth trying a cocktail or two while you're there. 

Highly recommend to everyone visiting Vegas.

Cavihour has changed from 2 drinks to 4 drinks. And these aren't cheap drinks people. At $17 a pop, we spent $90 for this cavihour promo. Hardly a ""great deal"" anymore.. kinda depressing! I would think with the economy places would be making their promos better, but it seems a lot of restaurants have made their promos worth by jacking up prices and decreasing portions. 

Drinks were tasty, but honestly I'd prefer grey goose if given the choice instead of the russian imperial. The pomegranate cocktail on the 2nd page was our favoriret. Caviar on the caviar hour was decent. It was the tiny kind (which I love), but it had more fish and less salt than I like in flavor. The sides that come with the caviar is why this place gets 4 stars.. wow! Fresh hot blinis, toast, eggs, onions, creme fraiche.. truly the works. 

Overall still a great place for happy hour - especially if you LOVE caviar like I do! At $90 for 4 drinks + some caviar, it's more of a splurge type place and less of a deal.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,1,1,4,nmRE-Yql7JnNPe6ONpfPNQ

5278828,2018-04-19,5,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"Formerly part of Light Group, a location next to the nightclub no accident, it was shortly after Red Square Restaurant & Vodka Lounge's transfer to Hakkasan that Christian Concepcion took over fresh from Portofino, the young Chef with time at noma under his belt reinventing a boring Steakhouse menu into something rooted in the traditions of Eastern Europe that still remains modern and accessible.

Always something of an outlier in the Las Vegas culinary scene, its Vodka Lounge clearly an impetus to place a Restaurant themed on the former Soviet Union near Mandalay Bay's primary entrance, guests will easily recognize Red Square as the Restaurant harboring a headless statue outside, the likeness of V.I. Lenin decapitated in 1999 amidst controversy but in the process creating another ""Vegas"" moment whereby visitors can don furs and do shots off the head in sub-zero temperatures.
 
Situated just off the Casino floor en route to a dining collection that remains one of Sin City's best, Mandalay Bay's numbers unfortunately still lagging some six months after the tragic events of October, it was shortly after checking in at the hostess stand that a table for six was readied beneath a sizable chandelier at room's center, music as well as lights subdued with a red hue making the latter a challenge for amateur Food photographers.

Presenting a one-sheet bill of fare in print that may see older patrons pulling out lighted magnifiers, a much thicker list suggesting a collection of Wines, Cocktails and Spirits, it was abiding to the theme that drinks such as a Moscow Mule, KGB and White Ruskie were requested, each well crafted from top-shelf liquor but at the same time subject to ""Strip pricing"" at a base of $18.

Ordering broadly from various sections, a request for plates to be coursed out flanked by two surprises attempting to create a true 'tasting menu' experience, it was with a trio of Caviar bites that dinner began, housemade Blinis as well as a crispy Potato Chip offering delicate support for everything from Trout to Golden Osetra with each distinct, delicious and also available in traditional by-the-ounce service.

Allowing the kitchen to dictate the pace, a pre-theater surge dying down by eight o'clock allowing Chef Concepcion to spend time describing his extensive research in recreating the concept, it was to the benefit of two children that crunchy Fingerlings with dipping Sauces joined a collection of imported Charcuterie for round one, the chunky Pate of Pork and Beef amongst many highlights but Troyanka's spin on Finochietta stealing the show with big notes of Paprika showing where Fennel often overwhelms.

Moving on to a collection of Starters and Salads, most surprisingly well portioned at prices that range $14-$16, it is not even in the simple Chop Salad that Concepcion goes low-effort as a pile of Vegetables is enlivened by housemade 'pickled' Vinaigrette, the use of Dill prominent but restrained just as it is with Scallop Crudo that even the Kids found enjoyable as their parents focused on what can best be described as ""Grandma's"" Stuffed Cabbage without any Rice and superior quality ground Meat.

Happy to see a collection of Dumplings given their own headline, the lack of Chicken Paprikash forgivable even though it would seem better-suited as an entr√©e than Chicken under a Brick, the decision of where best to invest another $15-$17 comes down to one's personal preferences though those dining as a group would be well-served to order all three, the Vareniki probably 'safest' as Christian's Pasta making skills are exhibited in Mushroom Ravioli though the Pierogis should be prioritized by those familiar as they are as good as what one will find in the 'ethnic' shops of Pittsburgh or Cleveland.

Further impressed by Khachapuri, the Georgian boat of bubbling Cheese cooking an Egg added tableside into a gooey Fondue eaten like Pizza, it was by way of three Entrees and an equal number of sides that savories came to a conclusion, Escoffier's model for Beef Wellington serving Salmon inside delicate Puff Pastry for just $29 while the Stroganoff and tongue-in-cheek ""Gorba"" Chop were both highlight reel dishes priced affordably for sharable portions, the former brightened by Carrots and Dill while the Bone-in Short Rib eats like Portofino's Osso Bucco amidst springy Egg Noodles.

Slowing down at this point, Brussels Sprouts gone and only a few spoonfuls of sweet Cabbage or Mushrooms n' Cheese remaining, it was with palates cleansed by Coffee that three Desserts were offered, this part of the experience still ""a work in progress"" according to Chef Concepcion and only the buttery Bread Pudding currently on the menu, though with any luck the flaky Pastry filled with fresh Cheese, Fruit and Nuts as well as pan-seared Dumplings full of Juniper-perfumed Berries will be quick to join it.

Salmon Kulebyaka:

5320648,2014-12-12,9,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"11/28/14: PLEASE let me save you from coming here!--TOURIST TRAP of the worst kind!  D√©cor is very trendy and artistic.  Looks beautiful in a dark and mysterious way.  Well, the parts you can see anyway cause this is probably one of the darkest lit restaurants I have ever been to.  Tip: Use the flash on your phone to read the menu.  Well, as I was saying, it looks and feels like a heavily themed Disneyland ride, though a beautiful one,... and that's what you get with the food too: described to be luxurious on the menu with prices to reinforce, but served up cardboard.

1. Moscow Mule $18: Says on the menu it's made up of vodka, lime, and ginger beer... and whadya know... it tastes just like that.  Yes, that's right, go home and mix your own vodka, lime, and beer and you got the same dang thing.  ZERO complexity.  Tastes fine as a girly drink--but you don't pay $18 for a cocktail you drink at your cheap company's holiday bash.  1/10.

2. Salmon Pizza $21: Crap.  Utter crap.  I don't care if it has little tiny dabs of caviar and is covered in salmon.  The bread is a tasteless piece of cardboard, and this dish is hardly deserving of your hard-earned money.  1/10.

3. Bone-In Ribeye Tomahawk $58: Straight up LIE.  It says ""24 Ounce, 2 Signature Sauces"" as a description.  Look... I've had honest 18oz steaks that I could barely finish, ...this is NOT 24oz.  I wolfed it cause it tastes good, but was still plenty hungry.  Note that this steak is extremely marinated--like it's completely saturated with some kind of marinade which really covers up the natural meat taste.  Yeah, I'd say it tastes good, but for $58, you don't pay for a plate of marinade.  $58 will buy you an amazing steak at Mastro's or Alexander's... this place has no right to serve this crap at that price.  3/10.

4. Bread Pudding $9: OMG, one sanely priced item.  Too bad it doesn't taste that great.  Your local diner will probably serve better.  Well on that note, there is one curiosity--do I spy Captain Crunch Cereal covering the dish!?!?  (See my pictures!--seriously.) I don't get it.  I mean, did they attempt to try to make Captain Crunch in-house?--or is that really the stuff you buy at the super market?  Well, if they made it, it sure tastes like Captain Crunch.  Would an ultra-high-end fancy-pants I-got-$300-caviar restaurant dare put Captain Crunch on a dessert???  Sigh... 4/10.

If you think I'm just joking around and you think the current 4-stars it has on Yelp could be correct... go right ahead.  Just promise me you'll get the bread pudding and ask for some milk--tell the waiter that you will need it to go with your cereal.

1/5.

Sure, this place is famous for its zero-degree vodka vault, impressive caviar selection, and 200 vodka brands, but the restaurant is extremely well-run and worth a visit, too. The service is exceptional, the staff is super friendly, and I've never left Red Square with a bad taste in my mouth.

I've visited here countless times over the last year alone and I've never heard a single complaint from anyone I've dined with. Whether we've come for the drinks, appetizers, entrees, desserts, or all of the above, we've always felt our expectations were not just met, but exceeded.

As a result, Red Square is easily one of my favorite spots to meet friends for a drink or grab a bite to eat before a big night on the Strip (whether we're going next door to Light Nightclub or not). 

Their signature Moscow Mule cocktail is a must-try and their martinis are the strongest and best-tasting in town -- especially the espresso martini, which is the best I've ever had.

The trademark of Red Square is the vodka vault, however, where guests wear fur coats to enjoy shots at the infamous ice bar. It's a great photo opp with your date, spouse, or friends along with an experience you'll never forget.

I've lived in this town for over a decade and I firmly believe this place should be on everyone's Vegas bucket list.

This restaurant was sent, I believe, as a personal gift to myself from Russia herself.   Quickly, yes its expensive, can be tight quarters, and low lit... But, its Vegas, everything is expensive here, or at least most good things, and Red Square in now exception.  We did a bottle of Vodka with dinner, I highly recommend this if you plan on having more then 5 drinks at your table as the bottle does come with full service and mixers at no additional charge less the individual gratuity they request.  The bonus on ordering the bottle is gaining access to the Vodka Vault, a below zero freezer where they keep these find bottles of clear liquor.  If you purchase a bottle, of any value, you will be given private access to the vault with mink coats, in addition to shot glasses accompanying your bottle of vodka... which can later be taken off of Stalin's head inside of the chilled room.  The food was spectacular, I split a steak and salad with my wife and it was amazing, not to mention a way to save a couple of bucks on the final bill.

The intermezzo was a tiny shot glass with balls of sorbet and champagne poured over it i could have ate an entire bowl of just that!! next came my beef stroganoff now this is not your mothers beef stroganoff this is heaven in a bowl filet mignon slices peas baby pearl onions and fresh pasta with a darker sauce rather than cream sooooo good.

Atmosphere? 5 stars!
Service? 5 stars!
Vodka? 5 stars!
Food? 5 stars! Name it and I've tried and loved it! Standouts for us have always been the osetra caviar, steak tartare, borscht, lobster bisque, czar salad, brilliant stroganoff, yummy lobster fettuccine, lamb, and chicken kiev!

So this past weekend we took some VIP's out to dinner at Red Square and, while the food and service still rocked, other things didn't-

#1 We reserved our usual large booth in the back for our party both online and when I called to confirm the reservation. Upon arrival, the young female seater tried to give us the small wooden table at the front door, ugh! The manger came, smoothed things over, and we waited an additional 15 minutes at the bar for a smaller booth located on the side of the restaurant. 

#2 The bill arrived. I paid, giving a generous gratuity, like we usually do, sign the charge, smile and chat up the manager on the way out, and begin taking some photos with the VIP's outside the restaurant. 

Suddenly there's a hand on my shoulder and it's the assistant manger, ""Umm, we ran your card again and it's declined."" 
WTH?!
First of all, get your hand off my Gucci sportcoat, secondly, why would it decline when it was already approved???
Over it!!! 
We pay in cash, and leave for the Mandalay Bay casino. 

Five minutes later my phone rings in the casino and it's the fraud prevention representative from my bank who informs me that someone at Red Square is still trying to run charges in varying amounts using my credit card!!!! 

We go back to the restaurant to see what gives and speak to the manger who assures us that they don't retain the records of the credit card numbers used for their restaurant patrons. Bullshit...the bill was settled (still with our usual generous tip I might add) so why in the world is someone at Red Square restaurant Mandalay Bay trying to use my credit card as we speak? Huh???

So good! So brilliant! The Wild Mushroom Risotto was outstanding! The Czar Salad - big, delicious and not at all what I was expecting.

Shitty Service: I will say though that my friends had the Lobster Bisque and they both got sick after. Was it the richness? Was it bad shellfish? I don't know, but when I notified the front desk upon check out (they didn't get sick until long after we'd left dinner and the restaurant had closed) the hotel clerk said I needed to fill out a security report. 

That seems wrong. 

And when I said, we're not filing a complaint we just don't want other people to get sick and could they please tell the restaurant staff, she said no and it wouldn't really help if I called them directly.

Some menu-born promises, such as a chocolate-covered plantain in the ""Russkie"" (see, stupid names), are satisfied in name only.  In that case, by a dehydrated plantain chip with a smear of chocolate on it rode the foam of a banana-creme martini.

Our server had zero taste, first recommending the steak tartare and then mauling it table-side by adding absolutely everything served on the plate to it.  If I wanted even parts caper, onion, beef, and horseradish sauce mashed together, I would have done it myself for less than $20.

Foie gras was okay (not great, as the foie gras itself was uncharacteristically bitter), served with a berry sauce, an apple, bacon, and french toast points.  There's a reason that most French preparations stick to brown sweets, like apple, raisin, and fig.  Berries for the $24 fail.

My wife's entree, lobster fettucini, was remarkably unremarkable, with a rubbery, overcooked lobster-claw in a thin and under-salted cream sauce.  She was tired, and the not-really-rich cream sauce was all she was really looking for.  $32?  Ouch.

My entree, the Stroganoff, was absolutely offensive.  In short, it tasted like boiled anus.  The tenderloin tips were overcooked, fibrous, and bland, and they rode around in a sauce so poorly seasoned that it could absolutely never have been tasted by anyone in the kitchen.  The noodles were reasonably cooked, but covered in that terribly executed sauce, and it was all topped off with onion strings that had clearly been fried at least 30 minutes prior to being plated.  They tasted of cold, congealed fryer grease, and they were the only salt carrier of the dish.

Near the end of our meal, crappy club music (and I like club music) started thumping through the entire venue.  Not a gracious end to a meal that cost nearly $150 before tip.

Then he actually picked up my shooter and poured it back into the ZYR bottle and said ""oops"".  WTF?  Uhm, no. If you overpour by an ounce or two you just don't do that.

First, I'd like to know why it took us so long to try this place. As Las Vegas locals, we rarely think about eating on the strip. We had a staycation at the Delano and decided to do an all day event on the hotel. I did not want to leave the hotel to go anywhere or drive. 

It was getting later in the evening and I was getting upset because I was starving. I picked this spot based on review, I also called and they allowed my kids to dine too, and because Groupon gave me a generous credit. 

The decor of the place was very Victorian, so to me it looked a little dusty but it's ok because anything old should look dusty. (The place was not dusty by the way.) the lights were nice and dim and it was so red inside, so red it was so ridiculous like me, I LOVED IT! The chandelier was huge and it looked like it can tell a lot of stories. 

The kids had the Kobe sliders with fries. No truffle oil or anything fancy for them. They ate their food so I say it was good. My husband had the 20oz ribeye with mushroom risotto. He was in love! The ribeye was delicious, flavorful, every bite felt like it was melting in your mouth. There was also this broiled/steamed tomato on top of the ribeye that complimented the ribeye so well. I was expecting basic tomato flavor but I got a kick of sweet, tangy, salt and pepper.  I settled for the short rib stroganoff and I seriously said, ""OMG,"" with every bite. I get overwhelmed with the truffle flavor but this was PERFECT. 

We would come back here again, maybe without kids.

They made up for it by giving him a complimentary shrimp cocktail and dessert but he really wanted to eat an actual meal so it only made up for it so much.

The cocktail prices are fitting of the establishment. AKA overpriced, but you have to know that going in.  I mistakenly ordered the hot pepper martini and imagine it to be very similar to drinking battery acid without the lingering physical damages to your face.  Keep in mind, I LOVE spicy/hot food.

5986771,2011-01-30,0,g62SlImzhs6_1t-knPjd8w,"Zdrahstvooy!  On the mall of the Mandalay Bay is a one-of-a-kind dining experience called Red Square.  As the commercial says, ""opulence, I has it!""  This place was incredible.  As you walk up to Red Square you are greeted by the beheaded statue of Vladimir Lenin.  The mood is set and this is not the Cold War's Russia...but a venture forward into the modern excess that has swept the country for those who weren't devastated by the economic transition to capitalism.

As I was in Vegas with a group of guys, we started the evening off the only way we could, but drinking with Vladimir himself.  For a costly $300, we bought a bottle of Kettle One and the right to don fur coats in the decked out sub-zero bar (the Vodka Vault)  where Lenin's frozen head encased in glass provides the bar for your sub-zero Vodka.  It's worth saying, this pricey endeavor wasn't bad when you figure 8 of us had about 3 - 4 shots each, and there was vodka left.  You're paying at least that much if you're at the bar, and no fur coats, over-sized throne to sit at, and certainly, no Lenin's head!  The choice was clear for us as to the variety of Vodka, but if you wanted another, the room is stocked!  Some restaurants have lengthy wine lists; this is Russia, and though wine is on the menu, Vodka is the focus!

For my meal, I indulged in the tasting menu.  Whenever i go to a new restaurant, I like to get the lay of the land.  In this case, it was perfect as the portions were ample, but not overfilling, and the selection was wonderful!  The meal began with Amuse Bouche, literally meaning a small bite before the meal, paired with champagne.  The decadent hors d'¬úuvre was lovely toasted bruchetta with a  light seared tuna, a delicious savory drizzle topped with delicate caviar.  I had arrived. 

The second round was my choice of three appetizers, of which I chose the peppered calamari.  As an Italian boy who grew up with calamari, I wasn't sure how the Ruskies would do, and wasn't let down.  When they say peppered, they aren't kidding and it was wonderful.  Perfectly breaded, deliciously tender and wonderfully spicy, this was a great way to make sure my taste buds were still working after my vodka starter!

My third course was a delicious house salad.  It was nothing special, but it wasn't a garden salad either.  Delicious arugula kept with the peppered theme of the appetizer and though, I'm quite certain it wasn't a Russian themed portion of the meal, it was appreciated.  The salad was followed by a pallet cleansing Intermezzo, a term I knew from music as an 'in-between' that brings two parts together, but have never so elegantly had tied into a meal.  This delicious treat which was a small cordial flute filled with a dollup of vanilla ice cream in a lovely champagne was a perfect way to ready myself for the main course, my steak. 

When I stay steak, I don't want to confuse you...as this wasn't dad's steak either.  Instead, it was the deliciously sinful Roquefort Crusted Filet Mignon.  To say this was incredible was an understatement.  When going for the gusto on a large meal, fillet is always my first choice.  it's delicious, it's often something the chef's can cook to order well, and it's not over-sized.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Cooked to a wonderfully warm medium rare, the fillet encrusted with a delicious cheese and atop of amazingly garlicy pureed potatoes...it was fantastic.  It's worth noting that there are two flavors I love above all others...the creamy tangyness of cheeses and the wonderful comfort of garlic, and this had both!  Not to mention, the steak was cooked perfectly.  It was a delicious salty crust on the outside that gave way to velvety red of a perfectly medium rare steak, all topped with a red wine sauce, and it was wonderful!

At this point, you could've suck a fork in me, as I was done, but they weren't!  The final course of this journey in opulence was the dessert, a caramel-vanilla bean creme brulee that was phenomenal!  I love creme brulee and often find it either not crispy enough on top or too watery on the bottom, this was perfect in both regards.  

In the end, this gets my five stars because the food was amazing (as was the food of the other 7 guys who were there), the service was excellent, the ambiance transported you a continent away to world's largest country, and the experience from top to bottom was one to be savored.  This was a great idea, and I owe my friend Jay for making this happen, as it was well worth the wait and cost.  And, while I'm on that, my tasting menu, incredibly reasonable at $65...yeah, that's it.  Get there people, get ready for a great meal, and enjoy!",bIj9V-65IohUp6zB3eiyEQ,0,0,5,Hj3zGTmiTTkg4UIeaxQDSg

Yes, admittedly, the bar made of ice (normal bar but with a patch of ice running down the middle to set your drink on or play with if you are a strange person) was the deciding factor on entering this bar.
