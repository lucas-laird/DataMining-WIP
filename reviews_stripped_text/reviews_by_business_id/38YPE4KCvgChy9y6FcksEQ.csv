They are crumbly and all of the cinnamon falls off when I pick it up. I've had this problem in the past, but I usually just call them and they have no problem replacing my order.

I ordered online and the website froze. After calling their customer service to make sure my card wasn't charged I called the store number given to me by customer support to see make sure an order wasn't placed and to order something. 

The first person I talked to told me they had the same deal as online but that they didn't deliver to my address. I called the store she gave me only to be told they didn't deliver to my address either. I called the first store back and asked for the manager. He told me they did deliver to my address. I was forced to spell out the name of my street several times and give examples of the street name in sentences.  Then he tells me  he couldn't provide me the same deal as online and it would cost me extra money for something I didn't want. 

I decided the $5 extra dollars for Papa John's was worth it because at least Papa John's website works, they can in fact find my address, and they care about making things right for their customers.",ectKhQKIrLRq3hEdKXOtuQ,1,0,1,UaZCEQXPy03J1NAg6vc9yg

I ordered delivery via the app on my phone. Delivery was a must and after ordering the pizza my phone even gets updates making sure the order was received, and when it's out for delivery. 

The Pizza Hut app is extremely simple to order from, plus they offer a rewards program here that rewards the customer for buying pizza. Their rewards program adds up dollar amounts that can be used towards free pizzas starting with mediums and the point values go up from there. I believe that it is worth it, and I am getting close to a medium in points.

I ordered a Large Stuffed Crust pizza with sausage and bacon. At $9.99 that is not a bad deal, this price includes the up charge for the stuffed crust. I also took advantage of the 2 medium 2 topping pizza for $5.99 a piece. Both mediums toppings were the same mushroom and sausage. The cheese bread sounded so good too! So we had this too! 

The pizza was delivered within 20 minutes of when they received the order. Their pizza ovens at the store must make those pizzas instantly: it seems.
