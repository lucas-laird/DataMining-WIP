8017,2012-10-14,0,0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q,"Sirio is one of those gaudy, overdone, bombastic kind of Las Vegas restaurants that is a sensual overdose before your food even arrives.  It is also ridiculously expensive.  But if you get past the high-roller, Sin City riff, you'll find outrageously good food and drink and attentive service -- the kind of impeccable that you can't find fault with, although you can't really be sure it's enough to bring you back.  

I was in Vegas on business, and wanted to treat myself to a nice dinner.  I was warmly greeted and not made to feel awkward as a solo diner.  The wait staff was very pleasant and attentive, from the hostess, to the waiter, to the flirty sommelier.  I had an excellent seared ahi appetizer, although I confess this was a second choice because the ala cart pricing scheme for more typical Italian choices was just simply outrageous: build-you-own platters of olives, cheeses, meats and pickled veggies at $12 PER ITEM!  So a antipasti platter of 6-to-8 items, which might run you $14 to $18 anywhere else, you're looking at close to a hundred bucks here.  Just stupid.  I had a stuffed veal chop that was excellent, actually worth the $49 ala carte price.  The wine list rocks.  I enjoyed an unbelievably good Super Tuscan from my favorite Italian winery, Gaia, a treat that I rarely see on wine lists outside of Europe or China.

Not a place I'd take the family, but a solid choice for a romantic dinner or to impress a client.",N6xxOl7GXyCwBwmlEYuA9w,0,0,4,MExvaR_eSBiyP3kYnsgZoA

Having said that, the service was horrific.  It took a long time for the waiter to come over. It took him a long time to come back.  The wine steward came over as soon as we sat down but before we had decided if we wanted to have wine or not - she never returned.  There was no bread at the table or water in our water glasses until we asked.  When we ordered our food they didn't ask everybody if they would like a drink and almost left before we said wait, because we hadn't had anyone come by for drink orders before.  They switched wait staff on us a few times.  While eating, a hand would routinely come over my shoulder and clear some of the table in front of me.  They asked one person if they wanted coffee after dinner, that person said no and the waiter left the table instead of asking other people.  The waiter disappeared for about a half hour after dessert. We couldn't get our check. We asked another waiter to send ours over. We watched him tell our waiter to come over. We watched our waiter ignore it. We had to ask the hostess to get the waiter.  Finally the check came and the waiter, who liked to sprinkle Italian words into his English, addressed us as ""ragazzi"" or ""boys.""  I'm not old, but, I'm not a boy either.  For a tab that was about $500 we deserved much better.",Cj2s4xAWQy21KJL8g5DN3w,0,0,2,uSCvNwuGTONb4VtDxJumkw
122268,2010-09-01,1,0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q,"We stopped by last night for a late dinner. The restaurant is divided into two large spaces. The front contains the bar and a rather large seating area with a somewhat informal feel. The back of the restaurant is a large square room that is more formal. The ceiling in this second room is silver and rounded, with the lowest point in the middle of the room.  It gave me the feeling that we were about to be squashed by a flying saucer.

Their service was quite good but the food was mixed at best. We ordered a Pizza Margharita, a pretty good test of an Italian restaurant.
It was easily the worst pizza I have had in years. I cannot adequately describe how bad it was, the dough, the cheese and the sauce would not compete well with the worst frozen pizza. 

After the pizza, we set our goals pretty low and did not try to challenge the kitchen.  The best dish was the Risotto with Truffles.  The pasta with pesto was good, but unremarkable.

Their pricing structure suggests they are quite proud of their food.  But at any price, they have a long way to go before they get to mediocre.",U6Mca-GmMJTuTPNH75czzQ,1,2,2,AVNJqPNnPrbH6TiNm5ejjw

367896,2013-07-02,3,0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q,"How disappointed am I?  Let me count the ways...  (Please note, there are a couple of good points towards the end)


My wife had never tried homemade pasta so I decided to take her to this place.  I had high hopes despite it not having 5 stars on yelp.  The experience went down hill from the get-go.  

General:
First off, seating at the Cheesecake Factory is more romantic.  Secondly, there were lipstick marks on my glass at the table.  Noticed it when they started pouring the sparkling water...and when they got a new bottle, they actually tried to charge us for it.   Yes, please let me pay for something I didn't consume!  I really hope it was an honest mistake but my feeling is it wasn't.
Other than that, service seemed decent, but far from 5 star.

Drinks:
Wine list is mostly aimed at the top 1% of the wealthy.  It fits into the restaurant like a giraffe at a polar bears only convention.  We brought our own wine thankfully...but with the 35 dollar corkage fee, the bottle wasn't the only thing getting screwed.
Their signature cocktail is worth avoiding.

Food:
Got the bruschetta and frittura.  Bruschetta is basically cheap hot house tomatoes with some garlic and basil loosely placed toast.  Frittura is ok, but a little too greasy.  Marinara sauce is yummy though.

Arugula salad.  Save your 17 dollars.  It's nothing special at all.  For 17 dollars, you could make 10 of these salad at home easily.  If you go to a classy restaurant, I would expect some creativity rather than just bowl of leaves and a couple of cherry tomatoes.

Main courses - waiter suggested the lobster ravioli, it was unimainative and the fishy taste was dominant.  The pasta did not taste homemade as the waiter had said, wish I had instead taken the fusilli with lamb meatballs.  We also got the pico toscani which, funny enough being the least expensive pasta, was absolutely delicious!  Its a handrolled spaghetti of sorts.  Veal, beef and pork meat ragu, very very tasty.

Side dishes - if you like salt, get the mushrooms,  they're ok but you will get a lethal dose of sodium. 

Overall we dropped a small fortune and we did not get what we paid for.  A note to the restaurant, consider adding a nice homemade lasagna to your menu, your meat sauce is amazing and would be be great in a lasagna.",1maqfBdVnGthpLebQQin-Q,3,1,2,b5wmbHQkQzv6LSbGfJnFxA

Everything was very good. We started out with a Cappuccino appetizer that was great. Then we decided to follow the server's recommendation to try the ravioli tasting as a second appetizer. It was outstanding and should not be missed. Both of us had as our entrée diver scallops with prosciutto that was over the top. The wait staff member left us wanting for anything.

Early Evening Menu
Sirio main dining room
$49 + tax and gratuity
5:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.
Another one is available for $39 at the cafe side, but the extra $10 pushed ok to wow for sure!

Appitizer:
TARTARA DI RICCIOLA
Yellowtail Tartare, Avocado, Artichokes, Asparagus Salad, Champagne Vinaigrette
*Very mild and clean taste, perfect for a hot summer day, put some on the flat bread and finished in 4 small bites.  Very Yummy (106 outside)

TUSCAN ANTIPASTO
Prosciutto San Daniele, Tuscan Salame, Roasted Ham, Parmigiano Reggiano,
Olives, Tomato Bruschetta, Roasted Bell Pepper
* This whole dish was excellent.  Out of everything on the plate the Parm was amazing! Tomato Bruschetta was the best I ever tasted. Roasted Ham - Prosciutto Arrossto was the least tasty of the plate.

Main Corse:
RAVIOLI ALL'ASTICE
Lobster-Filled Ravioli, Artichoke-Fresh Tomato Ragù, Lobster Bisque
* It was prob the best lobster Ravioli to date, but I just didn't fall on the floor with this dish.  Maybe because the other main dish was so much better.

AGNOLOTTI DI VITELLO
Braised Veal-Stuffed Agnolotti in Butter & Thyme, Melted Pecorino Cheese,
Wild Mushrooms, Marsala Glaze
* This is a fancy way of saying "" Veal Ravioli, but this was the WOW of the evening.  Super rich and full of cheese and Veal flavors. Hands down the table favorite.

Deserts:
CRÈME BRÛLÉE DUO
Chocolate & Vanilla
Wow again best creme Brulee to date, simple but perfect texture and flavor. Crunchy top and smooth center.

TIRAMISU
Traditional Tiramisu
Simple version for sure, smooth mascapone cheese and coffee soaked lady fingers served in a small cup.

We asked our serve and opted out and get the cheaper dessert, from the $39 course and it was worth it.  Maybe next I will stick to the $49 selection.

Nobody drank alcohol, but ice tea and coffee was $4.00 each, I would drink water and get another appetizer for that price...Food wins every time over drinks for me :)",NqlF_0uGf-XevdN_BuGzyQ,0,0,4,KSIX5D1fkvhnVMI9bbMsJw

My good friend Rhonda W. and I stopped in at Sirio for the Restaurant week. I met her at the bar, where she was finishing up her lemon drop martini (""tasty"") and I tried the truffle popcorn they provide as an alternative to bar nuts. The popcorn was good and had a good truffle flavor.

The service was excellent. The hostesses and waitstaff were all very attentive and friendly. 

Cocktails:
I had the Sirio Bellini made with blood orange and sparkling wine.

Appetizer:
I had the prosciutto with cantaloupe. It tasted pretty good.
My friend had the signature Insalata Caprese Con Peperoni Arrostiti (Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil, Roasted Bell Pepper). It turned out to be a big ball, the size of a tennis ball, sitting in a thin layer of sauce. It didn't taste bad, it just wasn't a very appetizing appetizer. Who wants a big ball of cheese in this situation?

2nd course:
I had the grilled 10oz beef NY steak with a dijon demi glaze, sauteed spinach and tuscan fries. The steak was cooked to my liking, and the sauce and sauteed spinach were delicious. The tuscan fries were basically potatoes cut into thick french-fry looking pieces. Not actual french fries like I was expecting.
My friend had the pan-roasted sea bass in a potato crust, with braised leeks, asparagus, and crustacean sauce. She liked it and enjoyed the crust. 

Dessert:
We both ordered the tiramisu. It was pretty good. I liked how it differed from most by having a nice thin layer of hardened chocolate on the very bottom. And it was accompanied by hazelnut gelato.

Restaurant week menu offers 5 entrees, you should have enough on hand to feed your guests. I could be more understanding if it were just before closing, but this was 7:30. Stale bread is never acceptable and rock hard butter is a major annoyance. I suppose in this case spreading wasn't an issue.

Our drinks were never refilled and a different server came to the table for drinks, ordering, food delivery, and check. Quite bizarre.

I started with the clams and sausage appetizer and thoroughly enjoyed it, sausage was slightly dry, clams were perfect, and the white wine tomato broth was super. Blended, they were very, very tasty.

1414643,2013-03-17,2,0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q,"CLIFF'S NOTES: 
Bland, flavorless, no depth, uninspired, luke warm, waaaaaaaaaaay overpriced.  

IN DETAIL: 
We were obligated to come here because we were part of a big group of friends celebrating a bachelor/bachelorette weekend. Reservations were easy to get for 16 people on a Saturday night holiday weekend. That should already tell you something. The restaurant was pretty empty. 

(By the way...if you go with a big group, ask ahead of time if you want split checks. Apparently the waiters aren't properly trained to keep track of dishes by seat number, like I was in fine dining. It was apparently impossible for him to split our checks. Of course it's always extra fun because a big group means bad service because they don't earn a tip when it's an auto-gratuity. Fabulous.)

The menu is uninspired and absurdly ABSURDLY overpriced. I'm not one to shy away for paying a hefty price for a fab meal, but this was some of the worst Italian I've had in a while. Since I tried several dishes of our friends, here's a run down. 

1. CAPPELLACCI--Spinach and Ricotta Cheese-Stuffed Fresh Pasta Pocket, Tomato-Gorgonzola Fonduta 29 

Only thing good was the marinara sauce. It was bland, lacking in texture and depth. Just a bunch of mushy ingredients stuff into a mushy pasta ""pocket"". Ew.  

2. Risotto with duck confit. 

So overwhelmingly blue cheese flavored. Awful texture, tempid tempurature, salty, no depth of flavor. 

3. CAPRESE--Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil, Roasted Bell Pepper 21 

Tiny portion and I'm almost positive that the mozarella had turned sour and gone bad. Beyond gross. And I love caprese salad. Oh...and unripe tomatoes. 

4. Polenta--9

Weirdest flavored polenta I've ever had. How do you mess up polenta? These guys know how. 

5. Asparagus au gratin--10

Waiter recommended this over the creamed spinach. It came out with maybe 10 tiny asparagus stalks. cheese on top looked to be melted and then sat around, so it was coagulated and hard, and was served lukewarm. There was nothing to it. And asparagus can be good just served sauteed. So they had to work hard to make it disgusting. And the waiter recommended it!!!! ???? 

6. PICI TOSCANI AL RAGU--Hand-Rolled Thick Spaghetti, Three-Meat Ragù 29 

Delicious. Only thing on the table that I would describe that way. 

7. CARRE D'AGNELLO--Colorado Lamb Rack in Pistachio Crust, Semolina Gnocchi in Butter and Sage 50

Didn't try this but friend got it. she said it was delicious but very heavy.

In any case, my hubby and I were in vegas to celebrate our anniversary and we were looking for an Italian restaurant to celebrate.  We ended up with Sirio in the Aria Hotel.  Our meal was beyond amazing and we were extremely happy with our choice!

We started with an antipasto platter which you can create from a number of selections.  We had two types of salami and the bruschetta.  It was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!    The service was very attentive as our servers kept checking in on us.  We also never had to wait too long for our food.  

For our mains, I had the seafood spaghetti and my hubby had the pork done 3 ways (pork belly, pork ravioli and pork tenderloin).  My seafood spaghetti was overflowing with really fresh seafood.  My only slight problem was that the pasta could have been a little bit more al dente, but overall, it was still an excellent dish.  My hubby loved his main as well, especially the pork ravioli.

We selected Sirio over other italian restaurants in vegas because of the menu.  THe menu worked well for us as I always want to have pasta, and my hubby likes to try other things besides pasta.  In addition, we both love antipasto platters.

Highly recommend. I've been to Bartolotta in the Wynn many times but I liked my meal and service at Sirio better.",5CXmvhmGcSaaDYh9JmLapA,6,3,5,0yIkH4lKqHeP-eCdZp6Nzg

They must have worked out the bugs because, unlike other reviews here, the service and food were excellent. 

We started with apps. We went for the seafood platter and finished it off with a couple of entries of the fresh made pasta with meat sauce that they divided into app portions.

For the entre, I threw the crew a curve ball and they hit it out of the park! I asked if they could make Veal Saltombocca since they had all the ingredients listed on otter dishes.

It was a friday night and the place was nearly a 1/3 full @7PM. That should have been our first sign that something was up with this place, but we decided to proceed with our meal. For appetizers my wife ordered the beef carpaccio with red pepper coulis, arugula and parmesan. I had the smoked swordfish carpaccio with frisee, and pistachios. The greens on our apps came out undressed, no olive oil, vinaigrette or and kind of dressing, forbidding the dish's true potential from being displayed. On my app all I could taste was the smoked fish, over powering everything else on the plate. The pistachios were unrecognizable (almost powdered-like) and the dish just felt/tasted incomplete and amateurish. 

Entrees my wife had the Dover Sole with cauliflower and mashed potatoes. I ordered the rack of lamb with pistachio crust. The Dover sole was presented and de-boned table side which is always a treat. She liked the fish but I thought it was overcooked since it didn't melt in your mouth and became ever more noticeable when I tried it without the sauce. The cauliflower and mashed potatoes were appalling.. Down right nasty and shocking that a place charging $$$ for food would serve such garbage. The potatoes were cooked and lightly mashed, then mixed with a little bit of pine nuts and garnished with micro greens. Not one hint of butter, salt or pepper. Definition BLAND, want-to-throw-it-in-the-chefs-face-disgusting! The cauliflower tasted like it had been blanched in unseasoned water and had as much flavor as the potatoes and probably my napkin.

My lamb chops were also inexcusable and completely fowl. There was so much fat left on the chops that I honestly never had a single bite of the meat with the crust. Easy 50/50 ratio of fat left on the chops. The semolina gnocchi were also disgusting and midway through my entree I stopped because I felt like I was going to be sick. 

Our meal was graciously taken care of through a friend who works at the hotel, and when our entrees were cleared we immediately asked for the check. The server asked if we would like any dessert, but since how horrible our meal had gone we decided gellatto from JP would be the best choice. The staff mentioned that our friend picked up the bill and asked if we wanted to change our minds. We declined their offer and exited that grotesque shit hole. 

As for the service, we had about 4 waiters. Never knew which one was our main waiter and they did a horrible job presenting and selling the items on the menu. Only one of them had a personality and we thanked him for his humor as being the best part of our meal. We tried to remain as polite as possible since our meal was free, and left without mentioning anything to the gm or chef. I wish we could have, but I didn't want our friend to think we were ungrateful and receive any word of our unhappiness.

Sirio is shocking! Shockingly BAD!! I never knew or could conjure up, that a restaurant on the strip on a Friday night could fuck food up as bad as this place. The feeling was reaffirmed the next morning which I spent praying to the porcelain god and pondering vegetarianism. I wouldn't wish our meal on my worst enemy.

Solid restaurant with great front of the house and in house staff.  Love the exposed salad and appetizer area, maybe a little cheesy with the massive displays of retail items.

-Beef Carpaccio, loads of parm and baby arugula
-Market Greens, fresh greens and great white balsamic dressing
-Pappardelle, foraged mushrooms, earthy, rich, beautiful 
-Med Sea Bass, huge portion, crispy skin, well seasoned, nice fennel agrodolce
-Filet, solid, temperature the way I like it, rare

Okay:
-Caesar, good croutons needed more egg and anchovy, just more pow, please
-Penne, veal ragu, a touch too much sweet from the sun dried tomato
-Bombolini, too dense for me, nice variety of sauces
-Veal Ricotta Meatballs, good flavor, too dry, more fat needed

Food wise, girlfriend got the pasta which she liked but I wasn't too fond of personally because it had a weird kicker taste to it. I got the Osobuco which was the veal that was recommended to be fairly popular. It was very tender and nicely cooked. Though just wasn't my thing.

I ordered an antipasti platter and they added a huge bowl of olives - it was so much food that it was unappetizing. After my husband ordered a pasta dish and a chicken dish, the waiter asked him if he wanted to add a rack of lamb - what?! Who adds a rack of lamb to an already large order?

2206233,2010-08-30,3,0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q,"This review pertains to the summer tasting menu.

The Skinny: surprisingly weak in the flavour department, poor execution, and lack of a clear thought process make this place a no-go (2.5) service is quite good in the restaurant (4) value: given the quality, $42 per person is pretty ridiculous (1).

We were originally going to hit up American Fish for their happy hour but unfortunately they were closed. We stopped by Sirio due to their appealing summer menu offerings.

My husband and I both ordered the summer menu which consisted of beef carpaccio, mixed green salad with goat cheese, apple and candied hazelnuts, mushroom ravioli and the roasted chicken with asparagus, artichoke and mushrooms.

The beef carpaccio (aka ""where's the beef"" carpaccio) was overwhelmed with arugula, capers and cheese - not much beef on the plate. The beef lacked adequate seasoning and was surprisingly dry. The dish really needed more of the citrus oil to moisten the meat and add flavour.

The mixed green salad was astoundingly bland given the number of ingredients. The apple in the dish was tasteless as if dunked in water for too long. The champagne vinaigrette was indiscernible. Goat cheese had no goatiness (in a good kind of way) or even saltiness.The only thing in that dish that imparted some sort of taste were the lovely scattering of candied hazelnuts.

Ravioli, in my mind, was more than al dente - it was definitely undercooked. The filling which was supposed to have mushrooms in it was overwhelmed by the thyme inside and had no mushroom flavour whatsoever.

Albeit, the skin of the chicken was nice and crispy, the breast was dry and overly salty. The lemon in the glaze did not work well with the wine reduction used in the sauce. The sauce was unpleasantly odd and overwhelmed the vegetables. You couldn't taste the mushrooms, asparagus and artichokes. It was a very unsuccessful dish.

Finally dessert. I looked for redemption on the last course of panna cotta and gelato/sorbetto selection. What I found was the complete lack of thought in these dishes.

The panna cotta was okay - perhaps a little too much on the gelatinous side but fine. When served over the berry soup, the sweetness of the panna cotta made the berry soup overly sour. 

The same thing happened with the gelato and sorbetto. They served vanilla bean gelato with two sorbets - passionfruit and peach. When you took a bite of gelato then taste the sorbet, your mouth puckered like you emptied a bag of Sour Kids in there. Individually, each ice cream was okay...it's just the combination made no sense. There was obviously very little consideration put into composing this dish - a recurring theme at the restaurant.

Given the poor quality and exorbitant pricing, this place rates a 2.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,8,4,2,15hoDq8nPq224v5mKanEGw

This was my first time here and I had scored a coupon for a 5-item antipasto platter for free for playing a game on Facebook. My boyfriend and I got there early and there weren't many patrons there yet. I was greeted by waitress by name and asked me if I wanted to look over the drink menu. I was given an iPad to look over their drink menu which is something I haven't had happen before. 

We ordered the antipasto plate which is normally $52 bucks for 5 choices but in my case was free. I chose Parmigiano Reggiano (because they didn't have any Castelmagno), Formaggio Sottocenere, Bresaola, Porchetta, and Mortadella. All of it was really good but I think my favorite was the Porchetta which really just melted. The platter comes with a little dish of honey and balsamic dipping sauces for the cheese. 

Parmigiano Reggiano - Emilia Romagna, Cow Milk, Hard, Fragrant, Savory
Formaggio Sottocenere - Veneto, Cow Milk, Semi-Soft, Mild Taste, White Truffle Flavored, Aged in Ashes
Bresaola - Air-Dried Salted Beef
Porchetta - Slow-Roasted Pork Loin Wrapped in Pancetta
Mortadella - Cooked Pork Sausage

For dinner we ordered: 

Risotto - Robiolina cheese Asparagus, Artichokes,Fava Beans, Sweet Peas - $34 bucks

Branzino Di Orbetello - Pan-Seared Imported Tuscan Sea Bass, Charred Heirloom Tomato Coulis, Fennel-Fingerling Potato Cake, Asparagus - $41 bucks

While I liked my sea bass, I couldn't help but thing that it needed a little salt and pepper. The potato cake that came with it though really tied the dish together. 
At the end of the meal we were given a little plate with some dessert bites (free) that had a caramel corn, fudge bite, lemon cookie, and some other little nosh. 
All-in-all it was pretty good and while I may not come back on my own I still think it is a place I would eat if others were full. Of course it is expensive but if I can get another coupon in the future then I'll probably come back.",yj8qKmj-6PeWa-G2191Jkw,1,0,3,qjbJdDY_8bM5-tw5HuA5VQ

We placed our order, and didn't see our waiter until the food came out.  They dropped off our food then we didn't see them again until we asked for our bill.

2497508,2012-03-06,0,0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q,"Just OK. For the price, the food should be better. 

We arrived around 7:15 for our dinner reservation at 7:30. Half of our party was already at the bar enjoying a glass of wine. Even though we we're still two people short of our full party of twelve we were promptly ushered into the formal dining room. Everyone was offered flat or sparkling water and handed a menu. We chatted while we waited for the last two guests to arrive and munched on the three bread baskets that were deposited at the table. Party intact and several bottles of wine on the way we were ready to order. 

It was a large party so I can overlook the fact that the waiter had to be called back to the table to take the order of diner number twelve. After he spoke with the eleventh guest (me) he just disappeared. After the ordering was taken care of and we were all happily sipping wine, the antipasti platters arrived at the table. I'm not a fan of cured meats so I declined to try but the presentation was lovely and very prompt. I did sample the marinated artichokes romana style and enjoyed them. Our wine and first course was a success. Then came salads and the two black truffle risottos that we ordered for the table to share. My salad consisted of baby field greens, balsamic dressing, heirloom cherry tomato and cucumber. It was good, pretty standard. The risotto was met with a mixed reaction. A few people enjoyed it, but several of us including myself had one bite and decided not to have another. Not very good. It was like a sticky rice with some truffle shavings on top. Not a good consistency and definitely lacking any kind of flavor. It was bland and expensive. Not a good combination.

For my entree I chose black and white tagliolini pasta with prawns, sweet peas and vodka pink sauce.  I don't know if it was $34 good but it was good never the less. I also sampled the sea bass, as our group tends to share everything, and the lobster ravioli. The sea bass was wonderful, I would order it again, and the ravioli was just average. Lots of things in this restaurant were just average. Maybe my expectations were too high to begin with but I just can't find enough reasons to grant this place more than a mediocre three star review.",u9w4LOoKYsM00Scb0HCH1w,1,0,3,YfkbcsfGY9PX-AMbLogD1w

You can read my details in a bit, but overall, I think the food sucks and overprice!

I went here because my wife wanted to have Italian.  It was also last minute so I did not do research.  I though since it is at Aria, how bad could it be?  Boy, was I wrong.  We did not want to wait another 30 minutes, so we went straight to the bar section where we can still order the same food.  We got the ""regular"" menu and the more ""extravagant"" menu.  I selected the meat lasagna.  My wife was about to order to clam lingunie, but I said since we are here why not go for the lobster ravioli...so she did.  When my meat lasagna came (pictured is available by another reviewer), it wasn't bad looking.  The taste was reasonable; although I think it is microwave.  The center was hot but not the outside.  Additionally, the food got cold quickly.  When the lobster ravioli came, we were totally disappointed!!!  The ravioli was extremely small.  They are about the size of a 1/2 dollar coin and flat!  I didn't taste any lobster.  It looked like somethng you order form Trader Joe's, boiled and served.  This item cost $39!!

The service was reasonable from bar.  So I paid my 15% as a courtesy.  However, I didn't realize my credit card was missing until an hour later.  My wife called the restaurant and they said they'll keep it up until closing; otherwise, they will have to give it to the security card if I don't pick it up by the same night.  I rushed back to the restaurant and talk to the front desk.  I was then told security came and insisted that the credit card to be held at their office.  So I had to go all the way to the security station.

So, overall, I think the food sucks and overprice.  Service was so so.  I tried other restaurants and I think they were most tasteful.",9GjI-bewbBalq8hw7ZkOBA,6,1,1,fkwzTN8VgP8cemcHaJb3kw

I had the pancetta wrapped swordfish as an entree. It was painfully meh, but I did try the amazing veal scallopine from one friend, diver scallops from the other. They were much better than my dish.

The front host 3 stars. We had reservation and was told to wait for a bit. She was talking on the phone. Then when she hanged up asked us if we want the bar or the inside. I said the inside, she said ok. Please wait on the seating area, asked us to give her about 5 mins. Granting it just opened and practically no one was there aside from the 2 group of people that came in ahead of us and was already seated.

Service (Kudos to Maria our server) 5 stars
Excellent customer service, knows my bf's name maybe because of the reservation, but like BF said, that's good customer service to remember his name.

Now for the food, 5 stars!!! Excellent food, just right portion. 
BF had tuna tartare, it was good but not a avocado fan
I had the Tuscan Antipasto, its yummy.
My BF had Veal Agnolotti as the entree, it's ravioli with osso bucco inside, Awesome!!! I had the Lobster Ravioli, and I love it as well, but maybe next time I'm going to get the Veal, BF offered me his entree, but I have been eating steaks for the past 2 days and I want to change things up for a bit.
BF had the canoli for dessert and I had the Panna cotta, both are excellent
We also have complimentary italian cookies, its good.

We will definitely come back.",cCeQbEy6NREx2-QIB-GCcA,0,0,4,d-mj2pZwCKALnAUzYuF-cQ

They should be in contention for the best Italian cuisine in the city, but somehow they're forgotten by just about everyone not staying in the hotel.

Starting our meal was the arugula and black mission figs salad ($19). Sweet and fruity from the figs and saba, the flavors were complimented by the bite of the gorgonozla and slight bitterness of the arugula. The beef carpaccio ($20) was plated differently than your typical carpaccio dish, with each slice of beef rolled around arugula and mushrooms and topped with capers and parmigiano reggiano. 

The two pasta dishes we tried were both very good. The pappardelle ($29), topped with foraged mushrooms and cipollini onions, had a deep, savory and earthy quality to it. In contrast, the sweet corn ravioli ($25) was much sweeter. Thanks to the corn and the liberal use of butter, the dish left us craving more. It was, by far, the best plate of the night.

Unfortunately, we were too full to try anything else, but a return trip is guaranteed. Despite a menu that isn't very large -- two pages in all -- their refined cuisine should be on the short list of best Italian on the Strip.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,4,4,4,OOezKSxAiX6e8GjddOftTQ

First course:  

[mixed garden lettuce, pears, champagne vinaigrette, carmelized almonds, gorgonzola crostino]
--This is one of the very best ordinary salads I've ever had. The champagne vinaigrette was wonderful - at first bite it feels like it will be too much but immediately mellows beautifully on the palette. 

[prosciutto san daniele, tuscan salame, roasted ham, parmigiano reggiano, olives, tomato bruchetta, roasted bell pepper]
-- Antipasto ingredients were top quality, smooth, tasty

Second course:

[lobster filled ravioli, sunchoke-fresh tomato ragu, lobster bisque]
-- Lovely and lighter than it sounds the lobster bisque's primary flavor was of tomato and not too thick or thin. Ravioli melts in your mouth, perfect.

[veal scaloppine in marsala sauce, wild mushrooms, braised sardinian couscous]
-- Full flavor and prepared nicely.

Third course:

[sicilian-style cannoli filled with ricotta cheese, dried fruit, pistachio]
-- The ricotta also had almond extract perhaps? The fruit flavor clashed with the pistachios or something and it was not as successful as it could be. 

[panna cotta with strawberries]

3971685,2012-05-25,1,0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q,"I went to Sirio earlier this week and was very pleased with the meal.  I had reservations and I was asked if I wanted to eat in their café area or the more formal dining room.  I chose the dining room, and I'm glad I did because I really liked the room.

My server brought the menu, noted the specials of the day, then went to the à la carte selections, and finally showed me the two tasting menus on the last page.  He recommended the 4 course if I wanted a tasting menu as there were choices for each course.  I opted for no choice--the 5 course selection--because I liked the different things that were offered, choice or no choice.

They brought out some bread--normal Italian bread and Focaccia.  The waiter poured the EVOO into a small dish and then added balsamic vinegar.  Several times during the meal I was asked if I wanted more.  They were very attentive.

Descriptions are from Sirio's online menu:

Course 1:  Appetizer--Crispy langoustine tails in Kataifi crust, white balsamic syrup, and sweet pea-mint sauce.  The langoustine was excellent and the pea-mint sauce was very tasty.  The stringy top was a bit difficult to eat and I had much of it on my placemat.  You just can't take me anywhere.

Course 2:  Pasta--Asparagus ravioli, parmesan sauce, early summer truffles.  The server put extra grated cheese on my dish as desired.  The ravioli was excellent and the parmesan sauce was delicious.

Course 3: Fish Entrée--Roasted halibut fillet with spotted prawn, sautéed fava beans and morel mushrooms, and sweet onion purée.  Another winner.  My server asked me if I wanted parmesan on this, and I had some sprinkled on.  The fava beans and the morels just gave the dish an extra flavor and texture that made everything stand out.

Course 4:  Meat Entrée--Roasted Wagyu beef flat iron steak stuffed with Swiss chard and spinach, roasted new potatoes, garlic demi glacé.  Excellent!  The beef was superb and the Swiss chard added a nice flavor.

Course 5:  Dessert--Sautéed balsamic strawberries, lemon Zeppole and pistachio gelato.  There were some glazed walnut pieces and some extra chopped pistachios sprinkled on the strawberries.  This was excellent, too!

Service was top notch from the time I walked in until I left.  Someone was always stopping by to see if everything was OK or if I wanted something without being bothersome.  Fresh iced tea glasses were brought and the almost empty ones whisked away.

The one server took me to see the private dining room you can book for a group dinner.  It's a beautiful room.  Now, if I can only get Yelp to host a dinner there, we're set!

They say the dress code is business casual, they must use Steve Jobs' definition because there were several people in the main dining room wearing blue jeans and t-shirts, and not the fancy going-out kind either, think of a Vegas IT business convention nerd's after-hours clothing. Considering I was wearing a shirt, tie, and khakis, I thought it was very uncool. 

For an appetizer we chose three items from the ""display."" Grilled eggplant, italian sausage, and some truffle-infused cheese. Of these the most disappointing was the sausage. It was literally nothing more than three deli-meat slices of mortadella. It was not at all worth the $12 that portion of the appetizer cost. The cheese was paired with some nice fruits and a sweet sauce that were a nice complement, though. 

I was disappointed that, at an Italian restaurant, they did not have a Valpolicella wine offered by the glass. I did have a very nice Super Tuscan recommended by the waiter to pair with my entree. 

For our main courses, I had the $48 Colorado Rack of Lamb. She had the ricotta ravioli. Hers was decent, a strong, bold, flavor from the ravioli and the accompanying butter-based sauce, but nothing spectacular. My rack of lamb was inconsistent. It started nice, but its pistachio crust overpowered the taste of the lamb at times. It was also inconsistently cooked. The first chop was a nice medium, the second was closer to medium-well. I don't know how the two large pieces were inconsistently cooked, but it was disappointing. 

We didn't have dessert because nothing jumped off of the page to us, but they did wish my girlfriend a happy birthday and presented a complimentary assortment of petit fours and biscotti. 

The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was interesting, but nothing special. I agree with an earlier reviewer referring to the ""Death Star"" protruding from the ceiling. One thing that was odd was a solid 50-60% of the restaurant was empty. The people who were there were put into the same section, which made it much louder than it should have been. Spread us out a little bit so we can enjoy our meals! The music could use some work too, or at least a few more songs in the playlist. The hour and a half we were there, we heard Bobby Darin's ""Beyond the Sea"" twice. The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable, but nothing special.

We decided on Sirio because it was in our hotel (Aria) and because we had gotten a reward for playing myVEGAS on Facebook.  The service was a little slow which was irritating at first, but then we realized they want you to enjoy your meal and the conversation so dinner flowed at a leisurely pace.

After we ordered our drinks a server brought bread (regular and Parmesan-crusted) to our table along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

We ordered a five item antipasto platter (reward from myVEGAS) and were amazed at how big it was!  We got three kinds of cheese (I only remember one was Parmesan) and two meats: salami and prosciutto.  It also came with garlic bread sticks, giant crackers with cheese baked on top of them, walnut bread, with honey and balsamic vinegar for dipping.  I would highly recommend the antipasto.  We weren't able to finish it all so we snacked on it when we got home from the club.

I ordered the potato gnocchi with creamy basil pesto and shrimp.  My one friend ordered the same thing with chicken instead of shrimp and the other ordered a cheese risotto with peas, asparagus, artichokes, and pancetta.  We were all happy with our orders.  We definitely could have ordered the smalls since we all brought leftovers up to the room.

It was my friend's birthday so we surprised her with a dessert, which was very, very small.  We got petit fours and saying they were bite size is generous.  They were free so I won't complain.

The boyfriend wanted Italian for his 30th birthday dinner so our group of 5 ate here to celebrate. 

-Food is ok, just don't come here expecting your typical Americanized Italian food. I ordered the ""Branzino...."" aka Tuscan Sea Bass & Langoustine, Heirloom Cherry Tomato Guazzeto(?), Garlic Ciabatta Crouton, Braised Black Rice, and Garden Vegetables. The fish was tender and flaky, the black rice was a bit too al dente for me, and the side of vegetables were bland. The special sauce which I assume was the cherry tomato was extremely salty. 

-Our server was nice and helpful, but MIA for most of our dinner. Even getting our entrees was a bit of a longer wait than what I've been used to. 

-On a brighter note, the table next to us was full of Italian mob type old timers going to town on the food and conversating with their hands. It was all very entertaining. 



                    *****The below review is for the CASUAL dining @ Sirio******
Sirio has 2 separate sections: a casual dining area, aka The Caffe, out front with the bar and then the formal dining area at the rear, where we ate for my boyfriend's 30th birthday.  We happened to try out the Caffe the night we were leaving Vegas, 2 days after our formal dinner at Sirio. While I don't remember what we ordered, I do remember the fettuccine alfredo being the best damn alfredo I'd ever had. Me and my boyfriend had already eaten our prior 2 dishes, but decided to order the alfredo and share it amongst ourselves.

4346987,2009-12-30,1,0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q,"I was pretty disappointed in our Sirio experience.  I wanted to book a table for after the Viva Elvis show - the only option was 9:30, though when we arrived the restaurant was at least half empty.

The hostess was friendly but told my husband they had a ""no hats"" rule in the dining room. Had this been a baseball cap, I would have understood.  However, we were easily the most dressed up clientele in the restaurant, and how his bowler would have offended the half-empty room of casually dressed folks was beyond me. It wasn't a good way to start the experience.

The staff was incredibly attentive - almost irritating, in fact. We received a wine and cocktail list and were repeatedly nagged about taking an order.  I finally had to emphasize that we needed a few minutes to actually read the menu, and seeing the food menu would be nice, too. That said, our waiter did recommend a couple Italian wines by the glass which were reasonably priced, delicious, and exactly the flavour profile we described.

In my opinion, the food is over-priced.  A basic caesar salad was $16, first course pastas anywhere from $15-$17, and the main course pastas were in the mid $20s. Meat entrees were mostly in the $35-$50 price range.

The focaccia that came to the table was very good, but the deep dish of oil & vinegar they provided made it impossible to get a good bite without drowning the bread in the pool of oil to get at the vinegar. The caesar salad was tasty.

The four cheese and truffle ravioli, however, was not cooked when I received it.  I hated to be ""that girl"", but it was far beyond al dente so I had to send it back.  And while the waiter was very gracious about it and delivered a properly cooked version of the dish, I still found it to be incredibly bland and without any hint of truffles.  The asparagus sauce on top was lovely - it turned out to be a great compliment to the bread. For a $22 starter portion I expected much more. My husband was happy with his spaghetti and meatballs, but they were nothing remarkable. 

The dining room is very modern and nice looking, but I am puzzled about the perpetual references to ""fellini-inspired"" decor. There is a big dome that looks a lot like the Death Star in the middle of the room, though.

The waitstaff was very friendly, but the food was such a major disappointment I didn't even bother to order dessert (which is a rarity for me).  I'd say give this one a miss, or give them 6 months to get the kinks worked out.",3UfaNU33lD86wnyAIwyhzA,0,0,2,Eel0PvK3MA30l2dtzNRWfg

When we arrived, in shorts of course, hostess sat us in the cafe (outside area). I asked about the inside seating and then she said, we seat our patrons with shorts out here. When you are paying $250 for a dinner for 2, excluding tip, eating in a nice, dimly lit, white table cloth, with maybe table lighting would be nice vs. eating in the cafe section, more akin to a food court in a shopping mall.  Thank god the scotch and chianti kicked in.
Waiter was very cordial and of course with an Italian accent (real).  Ordered the caprese which was nice, then  cappelace, spinach, ricotta stuffed pasta, 3 large stuffed fresh pasta, very good, and then the Ossobuco, a good size serving, fall off the bone, flavorful cut. The bone had marrow in it which was outstanding! Dessert I ordered the panna cotta, again, so smooth, creamy and flavorful, the best I've had so far.
I'm sure staff at Sirio will read this and hope that for future patrons, that they are made aware of the dress code.  I don't really have a problem with a code, but to somehow prior to seating, let us know. I still tipped 20%. Not the server's fault!

In a city with lots of wanna-be Italian restaurants, this place just doesn't cut it.  It is WAY too Americanized but yet they make airs about being authentic, and it just comes out disappointing.  (For the record, I don't have a problem with Americanized Italian food as long as they don't pretend they are something else.)  For the price you pay, you can have a much better meal elsewhere in Vegas.

The Caesar salad was awful.  It had obviously been sitting in the refrigerator for a while; it was ice cold with cold water at the bottom of the bowl.  The dressing had no taste whatsoever.  And for $14, I expect them to take out the brown bits of lettuce, please...

I asked for a recommendation for a pasta dish, and they recommended the home-made spaghetti with meat sauce.  It tasted fine, but the square spaghetti pasta was a little clumpy in parts, and the meat sauce was overwhelmingly greasy.

Joe ordered the stuffed salmon cooked medium.  It came out very overcooked; the salmon was dry.

Go somewhere else.  There are lots of other good restaurants on the strip.",WxJ8l6OTDvvbQKQyv_-5kw,2,1,1,Id4qhlKWeFnNFJ3yZacBVA
4527539,2014-07-28,0,0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q,"I have been to the Aria a bunch of times, but this was my first trip to Sirio.  We had a 7:30 reservation on a Saturday night.  We arrived 10 minutes late due to the Zarkana box office having issues pulling up my show reservation.  The hostess did not have an issue whatsoever.  We were seated immediately.  Pietro came to our table, took our water order, and dropped off the menus.  We didn't see him for a while after this.  A manager of some kind came up and asked if everything was going well so far.  We said yes, but we are in kind of a rush (meaning we had about 1.5 hours to eat) and we had to catch a show soon.  He gladly took our drink and food order.  

A cheery waitress brought out our appetizer, the Tuscan Antipasto.  It had a few points of cheese with a watermelon marmalade to top them with; 5 pieces of salami; 5 pieces of prosciutto; 5 pieces of something resembling bologna (wasn't the biggest fan); 5 pieces of garlic bread, and 5 pieces of pecorino (had to google that one).  I gave this a 3 out of 5 stars.  It was like 24 bucks, wasn't that much food, and the bologna thing was very ""meh.""  

Our drinks came out midway through the appetizer, hand delivered by that manager.  I got a Chimay and my blonde got the ""Tuscan Sunset.""  Her's was definitely too sweet for me.

Our main courses came out, via the same waitress that brought our appetizer, right as they took our appetizer plate.  I got the Linguine All' Arrabbiata.  It was very good and very filling.  Had just the right amount of spice and they were very generous with the crab and shrimp portions.  I gave this a 5/5.  The blonde got the Crab Risotto special.  I only had 1 bite and was very unimpressed.  The dish itself looked bland; almost like grits with some asparagus added.  The asparagus flavor seemed to over power anything else.  I give this dish a 2/5.  If I had ordered it, I would have asked to get something else.  Blonde ate about half.  We shared a side of the mashed potatoes.  They were pretty standard, not mind blowing, 3/5.  Pietro came by about half way through our main course and checked on us. 

We weren't able to get a dessert due to time constraints.  The check was was brought out promptly by Pietro.

Pietro did have about 6 other tables, 2 of which were 5 tops or greater.  I still tipped well because I assumed that the second waiter that started helping split the table with him.  

Overall, I give this place a 4 out of 5.  It would be a 3, but the manager helping expedite everything gave them an extra star.  I wish I got his name.  Male, 5'9, dark hair, early 30's.",tXntiyHEXbme6bptI8LDgA,2,0,4,lU8BfgQC9G1U83hh-zlzFw

Our waiter was from Milan and the sweetest Italian man.  He was captivating and so attentive.  I felt rather spoiled. We started off with the caprese salad and proscuitto antipasti. The mozzarella was so soft and the tomatoes were quite flavorful for February. I suppose I have become accustomed to avoiding tomatoes except during the summer when they actually have a texure and wonderful acidity so, I was surprised to eat a tasty tomato. 

Being true to my italian heritage, I had to have a pasta course. I ordered the linguine and clams. Unfortunately, this course was the only reason this restuarant did not receive a 5. The pasta was brought out with my veal marsala and the clams were terribly chewy. I had to send them back and of course, our waiter was extremely apologetic and removed the item from our bill- no questions asked.

Like Vegas, I love veal. Oh was it exquisite at Sirio. You know it is good when the veal almost has the consistency of butter in your mouth. It was rich, but not overly powerful and incredibly fresh. My only complaint was the fact that I ate it all and could have eaten more.

As if things could not get any better, I ordered dessert! It's not often to find restaurants with souflles, but Sirio's chocolate souffle beat any birthday cake I could have had that night. It was paired with a vanilla creme anglaise and it as a chocolately cloud of heaven. Again, my only complaint was I ate it all.

I mentioned to our server that I couldn't eat the beef (I'm vegetarian), so I was served an extra serving of the bass. The salad was good-- not drenched in dressing. The sea bass was tender and flaky-- perfectly cooked. The potato gnocchi was nice and doughy. The crunch of the string beans added a different texture to the gnocchi, which was nice. The cannoli was huge-- at least 6 inches long. Not the most elegant dessert to eat, but it was tasty. We watched the pastry chef prepare the cannoli from the kitchen while we ate.

1.  Ambiance -  4 star - Surprising to myself, it was nice and kind of cozy. Most of the seating is in one main area, you can see the food prep and others dining.  Not intimate, but cozy.   Otherwise, it feels very and looks very expensive in a minimalist way. That is impressive. 

2.  Service - 4 star - I believe that they train and have some of the best staff here. Attentive, knowledgeable and pleasant.  I was taken aback by their policy of no shorts, however, they said they will make exception for us as we had a table for 14.  All I can say is that all the others in shorts on tables of 2, 3 and 4 all must of had the same special exception.  It is called the norm, and no, it ain't that guy sitting at the end of the bar in Cheers.  Odd at best. 

3.  Food - Ok, we had the early evening menu as we were going to see the Elvis show (yawner) .  Should have opted for the full course and missed the Elvis show...

a.  Tartara di ricciola - Raw yellowtail fish.  4 star - What they gave me of it, a tiny morsel, was excellent.  As in the movie Oliver....""please sir, may I have some more?""  Me thinks they are kinda like that Nouvelle Cuisine where you have a large plate and you arrange your bits of food on it for decoration and spacing... Anyway, great and yet sparse.  What a tease.

b.  Wife had the Tuscan Antipasto - 3 star - You know, deli type of meats, bruschetta, olives, cheese.  This was really great and they give you alot of it.  I stole her cheese. A dry gran padano type that was just great! Other than the cheese, all the rest was to me, okay.

c.  Salmone Arrosto - 3 star - It was okay. Completely uninspired, but otherwise extremely edible.  I finished the whole thing!

d.  Ravioli All'astice - 4 star - This lobster ravioli was pretty good. My wife ate it and again, I stole a piece.  Since they gave you like 12 pieces, I had to pace myself.   Hold on Wilbur!  

e.  Cannoli - 3 star - I really like Cannoli normally. This was no exception. It had a nice crispy crunch and the ricotta cheese filling was nice, a bit bland, but nice. I have had this at many places and like the one at Montesano or Siena Deli.

Overall, a pleasant experience, a nice area, you feel a bit special.  You spend a lot for a good decent meal.  If you are craving great Italian food, I suggest you go off strip to Ferraro or to La Scala. Here you will understand what really great Italian food is.  Or, go to Il Mulino or Rao as well.

The last time I was there, it was right when they received their shipment of the season's first fresh white truffles.  Naturally, their specials reflected this.  In fact, at the request of the proprietor who we were dining with, we had a white truffle pizza as an appetizer.  It was just wonderful, so much so that I almost wish that more pizza places could carry it!

My dining companion and I couldn't decide who should get the white truffle risotto and who would get the Australian Wagyu fllet in a white truffle foie gras demiglace, so we decided to just split both!  The risotto was so rich, and the taste of the truffles matched perfectly with the parmesan (I think, can't quite remember).

Now, this steak... Let me try and explain it.  If you didn't tell me that this steak was Australian Wagyu, I would have seriously suspected it.  It was almost soft enough to cut with a spoon.  THAT is how tender it was.  It had a light but full flavor, and the strong white truffle foie gras demiglace complemented it immensely.

I wish I could have given this place a better review but we weren't impressed",a2Q-sBu1bvI_vtirn0LQPA,0,0,1,vLvBV2Wz7o_k1ryVJnB4MA

Locate in the promenade level of Aria Hotel, right next too Jean-Georges Steakhouse. Small, open space, but not intimate as Le Cirque  or Circo at the Bellagio.

Serving rustic, homemade style Italian special dishes from Mr. Maccioni's Tuscan homeland. Executive chef Vincenzo Scarmiglia, former chef at Osteria Del  Circo (pronounced: CHEER-ko) and Circo was 1 of my favorite Italian spots in Vegas. 

Coming here with certain expectation & was surprise how small the menu was, but yet, amazing food.

- Insalata Caprese Con Peperoni Arrostiti - - Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil, Roasted Bell Pepper - was nice light, & fresh.

- Trancio Di Salmone Arrosto, Coulis Di Peperoni E Spinaci Spadellati - Pan-Roasted King Salmon Steak, Bell Pepper Coulis, Sautéed Spinach - was perfectly cook. 

- & anything pasta, literally!

Reasonable price point, excellent service. Wish the place was cozier & more inviting.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,2,1,4,xq8fRhQZcqYbhFyJKiJeVw

My friend and I ate here last minute before the Viva Elvis show. We informed the waiter we were on a time crunch and he said it would not be a problem. The waiter in general was fantastic.

We both had wine. My friend ordered a steak dish and I ordered the grilled vegetables dish. 

Here's the thing, I don't really eat meat besides chicken and turkey, but I always try a bite of the other person's meal, regardless of the meat. When I do that, I always (yes, always) shrug and think ""Not missing much."" 

But that was not the case with my friend's steak. It was delicious. The kind of steak I heard people talk about, but I never really understood. Until that moment. And that, my friends, makes me believe this is an amazing restaurant.",J2OtbbY1pEXJrCLa1fQNHQ,1,1,4,T0nvSU-_9vyG6bBUcg8zEA

Bread was uneventful with a tiny 2 inch dipping oil dish !  No wheat bread ? Calamari Appettizer was excellent, sauce was blah.. Salmon was good, sauce was good.  Where was the brocoli ?  4 tiny pieces under the salmon, really ? Tiramissu was in a cup, a single spoon full covered in cream !  Cannolies were much tastier.  Service was adequate but not up to par with pricing.  Biggest turn off was the sommelier, came poured the wine, read the label and left ! No smile no hello no explanation, just robotic motions. $220.00 for 3 people should be better..",W1dDITORrt3c4UFi9sqztg,0,0,2,l2EvWzZ3Fj8Vb4LVIq4KHw

Loved the Mediterranean Sea Bass. 

The charred octopus wasn't too bad. Not amazing but decent. 

Service was as usual per fine dining standards. As expected, of course. 

I came with a friend and we did not finish our food. Took the fish and pasta to-go. Octopus was a small appetizer dish so that was easy to finish. 

Also comes with some bread but it wasn't that good. Same ole. :(",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,2,1,4,ER6zapkNJatA4FpALXz5OA
5754329,2014-07-25,0,0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q,Prieto was our server and he was great. Had the Caesar salad and the risotto dumplings as starters. Both very good. For the entree we got the lasagna and the Tuscan seabass.  The Seabass was perfect and the lasagna was some of the best lasagna I've ever tasted. For dessert we shared the Berry sorbet and the chocolate fondant cake  which was the perfect level of sweetness and richness of chocolate. Definitely recommend this place to anyone that visits the aria and is looking for a great Italian restaurant.,8-MuwNEIYWl8pbUmDGB3Wg,1,1,5,JQlO0lmHM48H4utnUQ-XoQ

Thanksfully we did win in craps Thanks Aria and to the girl with the golden arm at the craps table. 
But ok, about the food. The dinner we had sucked and was overall quite bland,
My husband had a Caesar salad and it was something out of a bag. Very basic, nothing ""home-made"" or exciting. Very small portion, like elf food... but was like a bagged salad that you can pick up at Safeway.

Our entrees were Lobster Ravioli, Veal Chops and Seafood Risotto- again its Elf food so we had to order 3 dinners.

Lobster Ravioli was very strong flavor, too much spices, too over powering to let you enjoy. Simma down now! too much spice is NOT a good thing!
Veal Chops were breaded and fried with salad on top. ZERO flavor, my 2 year old could have cooked this better in her kiddy cooking classes. It was nasty, tasted like cotton. Ever had cotton? ugh...
Seafood Risotto was not cooked enough, the rice was crunchy, and shrimp was like rubber. Ever had crunchy rubber...yum...not!

The meal was so shitty we didn't dare spend another dollar on dessert and went around the corner for chocolate and ice cream from Jean Philepe's. 

I dont mind paying good money for good food but this was the biggest waste of $250, high prices for low end food. I'll need to get real drunk to make me forget this meal, and I dont even drink!",WEn-a3_Pl3GV2ZOReirizg,1,0,1,W9AwWAcezzn5d6iEle06Rg
5832396,2014-08-31,0,0xdpv5CPpbUUch7JKBG98Q,"We had a larger party than usual, so we sat at a round table (no bar dining for us this night). 

The décor is fabulous. Best ceiling ever. We really liked the dramatic table in the center. Equally impressive was the full-length, glassed-in station with market items on display. The bathrooms are starkly white, whereas the resto is very dark.

The menu is large enough to please all. Everyone in our party found something that suited. Prices are commensurate with an establishment of this sort on the strip, although the resto week menu seemed very reasonable considering the options. One of our party selected from that menu, while the rest chose individual dishes. 

Service was great - not too intrusive, not too negligent. 

Not the best Italian food we've ever enjoyed, but perfectly fine. It was as I had anticipated it would be.",A0kENtCCoVT3m7T35zb2Vg,0,0,3,4Vt-_pOpIMLHj4Pa1eM-qg

Since we had a party of 28, we were able to reserve a private dining area which was truly wonderful. The staff was very attentive and the food delicious!  They were great about keeping us on time so that we could leave in time to attend a show.  I highly recommend celebrating a special occasion at Sirio!",UP8HdwmXTP0mrYTgvrI-0w,1,0,5,pxPghxQnbrBgbJakkP4ccg

We ordered a 2 meat 3 cheese appetizer with truffles! They were amazing, not a must but defiantly awesome! The four meals ordered were; veal Oso Bucco, Pork porterhouse, handmade spaghetti with meat sauce, and a Tuscan pizza. 

That night I ate one of the best things I have ever had. The 24 ounce pork porterhouse for only $40. I have never had a pork porterhouse, but I have been missing out. As soon as it came one of the workers came up to us and proceeded to explain the porterhouse, showing us the NY portion and pointed to the filet and said ""that's dessert"" we kinda laughed. Once we bit into it it was very clear what he meant. It was one of the best dishes I have ever had. 

My other favorite was the Veal Oso Bucco, it was great, it came with saffron risotto. The marrow what awesome! Another amazing thing was the service, it was out of this world! They have the best sommeliers. There was not one person who did more than one thing. I would come here time and time again, especially for that porterhouse!",tRBazUwnbucERsEaarXZOQ,2,1,5,_LFfc-gPRHAeUbyXNVnx-g
