I walked seven blocks to eat there because nothing else sounded good and how could a sandwich be bad? Well it can. It's called mustard. I hate mustard more than anything in this world. When I got back from the market to my job to eat there was mustard all over it. Would've been good to know what exactly was on it not just some of what's on it and whatever they feel like adding.

I brought it back to the counter, and was told that they knew they were having issues with the cook and grilled cheese, and offered to make another. I declined as I didn't want to wait an additional 20min, so they offered a refund instead. 

Second visit, I tried to purchase a pre-made sandwich and a beer. You need to have food to order a beer due to liquor license restrictions. One employee stated that I may not be able to order beer with the pre-made sandwich. I was told by another employee that I could order a beer as I was still ordering food, it was just pre-made. I was able to order a beer after all, however no one knew how much they were. To add to the confusion, the cook was also the cashier at a register several feet away from the kitchen.

On both occasions, the staff was nice, albeit clueless. There's an obvious lack of training, management and professionalism. Issues with cooks should be fully addressed before allowing food to make it to customers, and rules regarding beer for consumption on premise should be posted and the staff should know them.",M5bUAv15zYbYrpE6MEmyCw,5,0,2,zPmxBN9mgwuj3hh2WiZwog

This grocery store is like a miniature Whole Foods but more reasonable. They have an unbelievably wide selection, a little of everything in a small space. Their deli/bakery/ready-to-eat section is great. Pizza, salad bar, hot entrees by the pound. Super fresh produce and competitive pricing. Fresh breads, canned goods, dairy, lots of artisan bottled drinks like fresh juices & kombucha. The best part about this market is their customer service.  It's a Groupon that brought me in for my 1st visit.  The cashier was so pleasant and helpful, no rolling eyes as I asked for help, no sneer about the Groupon (unlike many establishments who frown upon those bringing in Groupons, which BTW that business took upon themselves to offer their Groupon).

I chocked it up to an opening week mistake. Today I ordered a veggie sandwich, paid for it and then was told their was no eggplant and they could substitute something. I said that would be fine so long as it was veggies. I walked over to the prepared food section and it looked like they had other roasted veggie options. He came back a minute later and told me they were actually out of all the ingredients for the sandwich. How can you be out of all the ingredients for one of your only vegetarian options? I asked if he could just make a sandwich with other veggies and he asked if I could pick  something else on the menu of 6 sandwiches.  I ended up with an ok but overpriced grilled cheese.

The Market has the opportunity to be this community's culinary salvation, but management is falling short of delivering on that promise.  The vast majority of the store is filled with heavily processed 'health foods', energy drinks and packaged liquor.  The limited amount of produce that does exist is old, mealy or otherwise unappealing.

My friend ordered the Peruvian Chicken with a side of Basmati Brown Rice, which was also paired with grilled peppers and tomato.  She liked it so much that she didn't let me have a bite! haha

Another one of my friends ordered the Skewed Grill Shrimp, Drizzled with Chimichurri Sauce, with Basmati Brown Rice and Grilled Tomatoes and Peppers.  HE at least let me have a bite.  I thought I was delicious!  The shrimp skewered were grilled to perfection!

Finally, my last friend ordered the Vegetable Falafel with Vegan Szechian Sauce, paired with Cranberry & Almond Quinoa.  I have to admit this was my least favorite of all the dishes, but it was still delicious!

The Market is very well organized and clean.  I really enjoyed the beverage selection especially the craft beer.  I must come down and try a sixer or two of some of these.  The ""Green Flash IPA"" looks delicious and a few other caught my eye.  When we were there over the weekend they were doing some wine sampling with a very good mix of variety's of California wines.  Very nice.  

Next time we are here I think we will order some food from the counter.  They offer sandwiches made to order and ""grab n go"" items that are cooked but ready to heat at home for a quick meal.  They Whole foods style self serve buffet line is great in theory for cold items.  When you prepare hot foods it is really important to keep these items fresh.  The chef needs to work on his execution on some of these because onion rings after 3 hours, IDK! I do not care how drunk you area at night but that cannot be good.  I would experiment with this section to see what will hold the best under these warming equipment conditions.  The soup they offer was a Broccoli and Cheddar and was delicious.  Another recommendation is don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach otherwise you end up paying for a $15-20 pile of food you won't be able to eat.  

Outdoor and Indoor seating is available for you to enjoy your purchase.  I like the outdoor area for people watching. They also have available for use while here IPADS while you eat your food. Just ask.  If your in the DTLV neighborhood stop by ""The Market for some goodies weather it a sandwich or brew support these local businesses.

More often than not when I come in there's woefully little produce, and the dry goods can be hit-or-miss. Dairy is also semi-empty, but at least they have something of a selection and for that I am thankful. Liquor is available, and they do have a decent beer and wine selection, for the size of the place.

But honestly, this place is more geared towards the hot prepared foods bar, and the sandwiches they make at the deli.

I was in the area looking for something to eat before I went to work. I passed by this business and saw that while most of the negative comments were towards the grocery store and customer service aspect of this establishment, it seemed like their freshly made sandwiches and the salad bar were given positive reviews.

The first employee I interacted with was kind enough to run me through the menu and he gave some suggestions. I ordered a sandwich and while waiting for it to be made I put together a salad from the salad bar and picked up a couple of drinks.

As I went back to the register there was a different employee with my completed sandwich and ready to ring up the rest of my items. I was told the price and I proceeded to pay with my debit card. 

After the first swipe it looked as if my card did not go through. It was then that I noticed a different price was displayed on the register versus what was stated to me. I was told to swipe again but opted not to and pointed out the two different prices. 

Up until this point, this second employee and I had not talked to each other that much. He just stated how he was looking forward to me coming back to try their other items. Once I pointed out the two different prices this second employee became very nervous, started to stutter with his speach, and in a very overly professional and robot-like tone, stated how he was going to speak with a manager to resolve the issue, and he walked away from the register.

Once he came back he began to speak in a whispered tone as to not embarrasse me and stated how my EBT card would not be able to cover the salad I was attempting to buy.

At the very least, this second employee was grossly incompetent. But with the possibly that he was trying to scan and dupe my card to drain my bank account (it has happened to me a couple of times this year already at other businesses) or that he automatically assumed to process my card as EBT card since I was a person of color, as I did not have time to get into with him,  I just walked out of the store without purchasing anything.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,6,1,1,9HuUVzVflZx-FCc1myXs4g

The juices are really large and at only $6, are such a great deal, especially since they are made fresh to order.

First day we got green apple, celery, and cucumber with tumeric lemon and ginger. Second day we got green apple, cucumber, and beets with the same add-ins. So fresh and delicious but also healthy!

The ticketing system for the deli is essentially non-existent, creating unbelievable mis-management and disorganization. The cashier would deliver people's orders while there was a long line of people waiting to order and pay; the people supposedly making the food were obviously just wondering around behind the counter, completely lost on how to prepare something from their maximum eight-item menu. 

The real kicker was that I ordered a $7 grilled cheese sandwich that I waited 15 minutes for (I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt since there was a ""rush"") before going back up to the counter to check on it. They completely forgot about my order, but informed me that  they ""just put it in the oven"" and it would be another 15 minutes. At this point I had spent 25 minutes in this grocery store, with 10 minutes in line just to order, and asked for a refund. They, for some reason, could not process a refund back to my debit card, and therefore had to give me cash. At this point the manager had stepped in to finish the transaction, but was so detached from the situation that he didn't even ask if there was a problem, just handed me cash and moved on with his day. 

While I wasn't able to actually get my deli food and review it, some of my coworkers actually received theirs, and felt it was mediocre at best. One of their sandwiches was even missing one of the main ingredients (avocado), and the other's food came cold. On a higher note, one of my coworkers really enjoys their mini pecan pies , so there's that.

It's really unfortunate that this is the only grocery store downtown. Hopefully they get it together in the next few months. If not, you're much better off at the ever-wonderful Sprouts, or if you're ok with spending The Market prices, your money is much better spent at Whole Foods.",5lI9bnqtUC2pHkTspM4gOw,2,0,1,VD527WwvrhE3Nhzf5vaMNw

The establishment, in itself, is neat and tidy. The staff is generally pretty friendly, and today proved to be very helpful. My partner went to the cafe to see if they had bacon jam scones. They were out, as usual, but the clerk offered to call the other Bronze Cafe location to see if they had any. Unfortunately, they were out, as well. 

I continued to do a bit of light shopping while he was asking about the scones. They only had half gallons of whole and 2% milk - and quite a few of them, most of which would expire in less than a week - but they had no gallon sizes. They only had cartons of 18 eggs, no dozens. The produce was fairly stocked, at least on the fruit side. They had Asian pears which looked good, but had no price marked. 

And everything is definitely on the pricy side. They seem to capitalize on the fact that there isn't a real grocery store close to the downtown area and charge you for convenience. 

When I went to get bread, I noticed that they had three different types of Texas toast, several loafs of an ""artesian"" bread by Sara Lee, and one loaf of sourdough. My partner and I were excited to get the sourdough until we saw that it had several moldy spots on it.

The Market is a pretty small store with more common produce items, cereals, frozen vegetarian treats, teas, coffee, non-dairy milk, chocolates, snacks, dried spices and mixes, O Face doughnuts, cookies, pies, etc. It's not a full-on grocery store so, there are items you won't find here. I was looking for fresh cilantro which they didn't have but they were nice enough to get me a small bunch from their kitchen. Talk about going above and beyond customer service!

That's what impressed me the most about this place. The people that work here are from the area and I think it's important for the local community to benefit from current development downtown. They're helpful and friendly. We got to chat with the chef that makes all the prepped food who told us how he makes his dishes and when they serve certain dishes. Soul Food Sunday, anyone?

Get a reusable bag for $5. They have items with clever marketing strategies: Bruce Tea if you're a Bruce Lee fan...Grumpuccino if you like Grumpy Cat. I'm a sucker for both so I ended up getting one of each flavor teas and coffee they have.

This may sound bizarre but they have the best shopping carts ever. They're tiny so, going up and down aisles and making sharp turns are easy. They're like the BMW of shopping carts: FWD + power steering.

Prices were ""OK"" and didn't strike me to buy anything in particular. The beer/wine selection was alright. Honestly, it wasn't anything I couldn't find at a Smith's comparing prices.
