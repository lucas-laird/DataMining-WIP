I see lots of people complimenting their marinara sauce, so it can't be that bad.. but the one I was served was either the end of the batch of they ran out and had to use some baught in the store.
Their pasta were very bland, nothing out of the ordinary, store baught pasta are just as good.
The worst part, to me , was their garlic bread. i refuse to believe that what i was served is what they normally serve. I look, and tasted, like frozen garlic bread from the store, only with more garlic and more cheese added.
I had a garlic taste lasting for days after that one..
Like I said , after reading the other reviews, something must have been wrong when I was there , was the chef off ? maybe they didn't receive some deliveries ? Maybe they had tons of cooks calling sick ? 
I am not sure , but I will have to come back , for sure it won't be as bad..",MgTR_Hp2YhIDaodXcZgIhw,0,0,1,wGa4-jNbIRCLaFCOagHeZA

I visited Nora's many years ago and was disappointed but after hearing so many positive things, I decided to go back - eager, hungry and with an open mind.  I figured I must have visited on an ""off"" night before.

Nope.  Quite mediocre.  Food quality seemed greasy and cheap.

Fried Calamari:  Greasy but certainly edible (2.5 stars)
Caprese Salad: Mozzarella (5 stars), tomatoes (less than 1 star)
Tortellini with Vodka Sauce and added chicken:  pretty tasty (3.5 stars)
Garlic Bread:  Tasty but cheap and I am huge bread fan (2.5 stars)
Chicken Parm - terrible, way too salty (1 star)

Soda: crisp and bubbly (5 stars)
espresso:  strong with great flavor (5 stars)

When the chicken came it was a bit over cooked and I thought the spaghetti sauce not up to par, but it was still pretty good. 

It was my friend's turn to pay and he gave the waitress his credit card. She returned and apologized and said since we hadn't been there in a while she would have to see his ID. My friend was not put off by this, but I was. I would have been very annoyed if that had happened to me, especially if I was bring someone there for business and they recognized me as a returning customer and still wanted to see my ID. I left not eager to return. WHEN I MENTIONED THIS CREDIT CARD ISSUE TO MY FRIEND MUCH LATER, HE TOLD ME THAT HIS WIFE INSISTS ON WRITING ON THE BACK OF EACH OF HIS CREDIT CARDS, ""PLEASE DEMAND TO SEE MY ID."" So, I think what happened is that the waitress obviously didn't look at the back of his credit card, the cashier did and just told the waitress w/o explanation to check that customer's ID.

We were seated immediately and our server, Ed, came to greet us with a smile. He made good recommendations and we were pleased. 

Starters were tasty. The shrimp scampi was very good. Lots of tasty garlic bread to sop up the sauce. Would I make the bread crispier? Yes
Did I eat it? Yes
Would I order it again? Yes

The Mozzarella Cambrese was fine. Cheese was on the edge of grainy....not awesome, but fine.

The Osso Bucco was outstanding. Tender but not overcooked. Delicious and sumptuous.

The crazy alfredo was excellent, although a little stingy with the protein, but still, quite tasty.

Veal Parm was solid.

The surprise of the table was salmon piccata. As dish that would be easy to mess up...they didn't. They married those hard to meld flavors into something special.

126128,2016-11-09,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Went on a surprisingly busy Tuesday night of the Election.  We had made reservations for 6:30 pm, but because we were a little bit hungrier than expected, we arrived at 6:00 pm.  Obviously, we were a bit too early so we waited for no longer than ten minutes to get seated for dinner.  Not a problem.  When we finally got the chance to sit down, we were immediately greeted by assistant waiters who eagerly got our drinks order.  Again, it was a busy Tuesday night so the wait for the drinks was a little bit longer but wasn't waaaay too long.  It gave us just enough time to say dinner prayers so we were thankful for that.  I ordered the Puttanesca as my entree and while it was deliciously hot and tasty, it was somewhat lacking the anchovies which I was looking forward to.  Mom ordered a Riesling from the wine collection and it was dynamite.  So good.  Ramon was our waiter and my goodness, what a terrific server.  He asked us first if we had any questions about the menu after we spent about ten minutes with the menu before he came over to take our order.  What a rare treat!

They gave us a seat outside and even though it was 100 degrees that day, they had these little cool fans pointed our way so it didn't feel bad at all. My favorite thing about this restaurant was that it just felt like an Italian restaurant instead of being a flashy place to eat in Vegas. The crowd was a little older and there was a band playing music as we dined.

The servers were attentive and the food arrived promptly. We ordered the fried calamari to start which had a nice crunch to it. My main dish was the Primavera which was good.

310411,2009-06-13,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Overall: 
Fantastic food for the price, a great find off the strip. From what I've heard, this is where Vegas chefs to go eat :) 

Ambiance/Location: 
Strip mall, but worth the drive off the strip. When you walk in you see chefs making pizzas which sets a nice tone. We sat in the room with the bar and were able to see the end of game 4 of the NBA finals :) Typical dim lighting of an Italian restaurant. 

Food: 
Fantastic! Per our waiter's recommendation, here is what we ordered: 
- garlic bread (one basket complimentary) - fresh soft bread, tasty, crispy 
- House salad - the regular portion was split between 4 people, but if you're big on salad you might want to get your own. A nice blend of lettuce, mozzarella, olives, pepperocinis, tomatoes with a oil and vinegar dressing. 
- Alla Nora (with angel hair pasta) - hearty red sauce not too tart or overwhelmingly tasting of tomatoes. The eggplant was breaded and fried adding a crispy texture. The ground beef did not overwhelm either. My favorite of the dishes we had. 
- Mt. Etna - chicken with multiple layers of tomatoes, fried onion strings, on a bed of red potatoes in balsamic reduction -- chicken was a bit dry, but good flavors 
- Chicken Carfucio - the flavors of the capers and artichokes rule this dish which is overall pretty light and allows the fresh tomatoes to balance the dish. This dish is more about the separate ingredients merging than about the sauce (which is mainly oil and garlic) 
- Crazy Alfredo - rich and creamy with multiple fun additions including jalapenos! My mom's favorite, and it was indeed a dish to be ordered again. 
- warm chocolate cake - you need to preorder this (when you order dinner) and we got 2 for 4 people, which was perfect. I've had others which were creamier and had a more molten center, but this one was unique. the cake was a bit more coarse but very flavorful, and it was topped with crushed pistachios which added a salty crunch, and surrounded but a white cream sauce. I'm used to eating this ala mode, and I think ice cream would also have paired well with this. 

Wine list: extensive both by the glass and bottle. 

Service: 
Friendly waiters and busboys, we had to ask once to get our water refilled though. 

Price: 
Entrees $12-20, Dessert $4.50-6.50, Wines from $7.50/glass",ZdtsXzT3H-3nk5ajVR95Xg,2,1,4,gZAV_c_mD2_DPjvmmJM0Ww

The quality of the food was good for the price, portion size was good: generous without being crazy.  I ordered the Eggplant Parmesan, my coworker had another pasta dish, I don't remember which one, but it had a meat sauce.  We split a Caesar Salad.  Wine selection was fine: plenty of options, good prices.  We didn't have room for dessert, but it looked tasty.  
The garlic bread is garlic-y and yummy.  The service was excellent on this surprising busy night (we didn't have reservations, but opted to be seated immediately over by the kitchen).  Water got refilled promptly, people came by often to ensure we didn't need anything (almost, but not quite, too often).

But we were on vacation. My buddy read up on this place and convinced me to join him and his family. And I'm glad I did. 

Yeah, the kids got cheese pizza and angel hair with butter. Man, are they REALLY my kids? When are they gonna expand their palates? But the rest of us went for it on the menu and I have to say I was fairly impressed. 

The garlic bread they drop off at the table is warm, chewy and garlicky. Nice start. And they kept it coming.  Me loves that.  Lots.

Hands down best calamari I've ever had in an Italian restaurant. The accompanying sauce wasn't just boring ol' marinara, it was a nice, complex side that went well with the light and crunchy squid.   My buddy ate all the tentacles.

Solid house salad. Nothing amazing, but good, fresh ingredients and a tangy dressing.  Perfect soaked up with the bread. 

The so-so. (There won't be a bad category). The chicken parm was on the small side. Good enough, but not outstanding. Don't order it. Same for the special veal chop. It looks impressive and the price isn't bad - 28 bucks - but it didn't make any of us at the table scream  ""Mangia, mangia!"" 

The good. My son's cheese pizza.  Really awesome crust and blend of cheeses. And made for a good breakfast the next day. My wife had the pesto. Perfect. Absolutely perfect. And my linguine with clams? A ton of clams and garlic, nicely proportioned. I cleaned my plate happily. 

I'm a former waiter and I have to say, the service was pretty good. Apparently, the night we went, the place got slow, so they let a few servers go. Then they got slammed. While we did have to wait, the waiter and bus staff kept their cool, never running around like chickens with their heads cut off. That showed professionalism and didn't ruin our dining experience. 

Though on the flip side, why didn't the manager just call up a waiter? Tell them, ""Get your butt back here, we got slammed!""   That happened to me back in the day.

Finally, the bill came. And considering all the food we had, I thought we got out of there cheap. We didn't drink much alcohol, but nine people were stuffed to the gills.

The marinara sauce was excellent and the garlic bread heavenly. My husband ordered the linguine and clams and it was devine.  One of the best I ever tasted. We also ordered two glasses of sangria and it was wonderful. For dessert we ordered the cannoli. There are no words in the English language to describe the amazing flavor. The cream was made from scratch and was very light and not overly sweet. The atmosphere is pleasant and the service is great. The staff is very friendly.

I ordered the huge ribeye steak (16 oz), calamari, and tirimisu for dessert. The calamari is a large portion and the dipping sauce was out of this world with a beautiful basil flavor. The steak was juicy and tender and flavored well. The tirimisu was good too.

Checked in on the Yelp app and received a glass of wine! Free wine = AMAZEBALLS!

Started off with the house garlic bread. It was very good. You could tell this was homemade, not some frozen loaf coming from a distributor. Just that principle of not having frozen cheap appetizer had me already falling in love. 

Then we moved to the bruschetta. It came served on a large slide of soft bread. This was some of the best bruschetta I've ever had. It was not your average sampling, this is what I've been missing my entire life. 

My entree was the rigatoni gorgonzola with chicken. Similar to the bruschetta, this was done right! The pasta was perfectly textured and consistent throughout. The sauce on this was heavier than my liking, but it fit very well with the dish. The biggest surprise here was the blue cheese on top. I've never heard of pasta being topped with blue cheese, but I fell in love with it!

HOWEVER... The service is horrible!!!

First of all the hostess is more concerned with blatantly flirting with other staff members than doing her job.  It was almost disgusting to see.

We were sat at a nice table and waited for our server. And we waited and waited and waited. After about 10+ minutes a waiter shows up and asks for our drink order. No apology for making us wait. He brings us water and our drinks and disappears. After about another 10 minutes another waiter comes and asks for our food order.  Again no apology for waiting and not even a hello.  Anything we needed - like more water - we had to flag our waiter down as he couldn't seem to notice more than one of his tables each time he was in the dining area.  He continually disappeared and we were left waiting, for everything. We wondered if this was his very first shift waiting tables.  There were two busboys who seemed to be working very hard but some how never made it to our table. 

So finally our food arrives. And it is absolutely outstanding! Service might be horrible but the food is most definitely worth the visit. Just don't go unless you have time for a leisurely meal. 

Word to management: train your wait and hostess staff! And then manage them!! The food is fantastic but you are losing guests due to horrible service.",pj4j5_mOavr8GTbYoAxAQA,0,0,4,iFkSK5emLy9xpAFE9gt92w

Overall experience here is definitely four stars. Came here not knowing what to expect-- it was busy, small but had that feeling of authenticity, friendly staff, tables covered with butcher paper.

But we were able to be seated immediately without being given a hard time so I guess dress code wasn't an issue. 

Service was quick despite of the traffic. We immediately started off with calamari which was excellent, and also the garlic bread--nicely toasted with some butter and ofcourse garlic. With the help of our server, I got myself a cocktail called the ""berry explosion.""And it was excellent, not too strong and was berry delicious.
For the entree, my bf ordered the ""Crazy Alfredo""--sausage, chicken, mushrooms, and shrimp. That was actually real good, I say better than what I ordered, which was the Orange Roughy with angel hair pasta. It was a wee underflavor and wow that fish was fishy. Not a big fan of it but yet again there's plenty of food to choose from and there will be a next time. 

The place is not that cheap either. 70 bucks including tip for this dinner but it was worth it, minus the fish.. sort of.

496750,2010-05-04,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"My husband and I didn't want to eat on the strip as they are often overrated and overpriced. After looking into Italian foods (I wanted pasta) here on Yelp, we decided to eat at Nora's.  Pretty easy to find, but I agree that the exterior didn't really do its justice for what was offered inside.  

PROS:
The food was pretty decent for Vegas and for its price.  I had the ""crazy"" alfredo (due to my pregnancy hormones, I had to substitute the chicken for clams).  NOT BAD AT ALL!!!  The Jalapenos actually worked really well in this dish. The portions were pretty big.
Had the warm chocolate cake for dessert...it was ok.  I mean, can't really go wrong with chocolate but I've had better.  

CONS: 
Had to wait at least 15 mins for a table even though it was obvious that there were empty tables around.  The hostess never offered an explanation as to the wait.  As she stepped away, a random waitress had to search for the hostess to seat us..as she wonders why we had to wait.  
The lasagna.  My husband didn't really like the ricotta cheese...instead he helped me finish my pasta.  

Though they mixed up my food (the substitution in my pasta), they seemed really apologetic...and the service was great.  I didn't get our server's name but he was friendly and actually took the lasagna off our bill (we didn't even had to ask!).  SO all in all, it was a good experience...yeah we would go back...I would recommend it to others...especially if you just want to casually dine off the strip.",d952urHXaR7F3jTeRlg4tA,0,0,4,eGrOnLVYrBxs_0COCUJaDA

I ordered the Puttanesca, which was tasty but wasn't able to eat much due to the saltiness. If you like salty food, then I would recommend this dish. 

The kitchen was extremely slow on the weeknight we visited. It was not a busy night, as there were empty tables. It took more than an hour (one hour and 15 minutes to be exact) to receive our order which was fairly straightforward. No sides, no appetizers, just five main courses. We could see other diners expressing frustration with the same delays in their food. Wine helped.

The wait staff was excellent beyond compare. Everyone was friendly, courteous, apologetic and tried their best to entertain us while we waited and waited and waited for our food.

It's not overly expensive, but for the portion and the quality, it's still a rip-off!

The food doesn't have to be great, just decent and a lot of it.  If you don't believe me, look at the runaway success of Outback Steakhouse.  Las Vegas locals are no exception, which is why Nora's managed to get so many glowing 5-star reviews.

I started with the fried calamari - better than your average calamari, but that's not saying much.  The batter was nice & crispy, the dipping sauce was OK (actually better without the sauce, I thought), and the portion was plentiful for the price ($10.95).  I also got the fettuccine carbonara and requested it extra al dente.  It came out just somewhat al dente, but the quality of the pasta was better than most Italian restaurants.  It wasn't true carbonara, just pasta with lots (and LOTS) of ham thrown on top and then drowned in a very generic cream sauce.  There was so much ham, must've been almost a pound of it in the dish, that I actually left quite a bit of in the bowl.  But for $13.95, you had your protein fix for the week.  I couldn't decide between two desserts, so I just ordered both (judge not lest ye be judged).  The salted chocolate panna cotta is more like a dark chocolate pudding than a true panna cotta, and yes, it's salty, but the saltiness works.  I also got the pistachio cannoli, requested it without chocolate chips, but got the chocolate chips anyway.  After picking off the chips, I really enjoyed this dessert - crisp shell, good vanilla ricotta filling, complemented by ground pistachios.  The desserts were a notch above the appetizer and main and also the reason I bumped the rating up a star to A-OK.

There is far better Italian food in Las Vegas (Allegro at the Wynn is good, Sinatra at Encore is better, Verandah at the Four Seasons is outstanding), but it's also a lot pricier.  I spent half, maybe even less, at Nora's compared to a similar meal at a Strip Italian restaurant.  If you want decent Italian at great prices, go to Nora's.

I had the Chicken Marsala... excellent.  Someone else got ""Crazy"" Alfredo... super good and very popular dish.  Seriously, anything you order there would be good.  I would recommend this place to anyone and can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It came  45 mins. later ""extra well-done""  I couldn't even cut it, tough as leather! 30 mins. later another one came and it was cooked perfect.  But, still very tough. Cheap grade of beef !!
My friend ordered Clams and Linguine. Surprise she got 1/2 cup of pasta & 3 clams in a big bowl that was so super salty she couldn't eat it.  That was sent back too.  The waiter suggested she try the Octopus instead. That was interesting when it came to the table there were 5 tiny round pieces the size of a quarter, weird sauce and 1/2 cup of cooked green lettuce in the center. Again not-edible.. Next  came the no taste Osso Buco ( from a crock pot) and the grand finale was my husbands so called Lasagna. There were about 6 bites hidden under  2 inches of melted cheese on the top.

Otherwise, the bar is first come first serve. I actually prefer the bar because service is better and more prompt. Besides, the drinks here are AMAZING! My personal favorite is the Sicilian mule.

Location: The place is always busy, if you're going to relocate, why not make the restaurant larger to accommodate more people instead of having people leave due to the wait or if you call to make a reservation, not have any availability until late the night of. 

Food: All the food I have tried here has been good. The fettucini carbonara, crazy alfredo, and wild boar pappardelle are great options for pasta, I also liked the Nduja pizza. They also bring out a basket of garlic bread to start, and don't be shy to ask for more. For dessert, the cannoli is soo good- I really enjoyed the mascarpone/ricotta filling.  

Service: Like I mentioned before, the service is good at the bar, but at the table it can be hit or miss. Sometimes the server is attentive but sometimes you'll see them come by once in a blue moon. I've also come another time when one of our orders was not properly made, and when we spoke to the server and manager about the issue, neither handled the situation well. For a ""classy"" establishment, customer service should be top notch. Remaking the food is a must, but the dish should have been comped or at least provided some form of discount since the one person in our group didn't end up getting the remade order until AFTER we were almost finished with our meal.",WUbIK69vpDlFnSDgxzB_Kg,0,0,4,LXvhqe-yPG79kWzbFnR1PQ

My friend from out of town and I were both craving Italian food for her last dinner here! We stumbled on Nora's from Yelp and decided to give it a go. Like I said, I've had better service but it wasn't the worst. I will say the restaurant staff did keep up with refilling our waters, which was awesome! One of my pet peeves is when servers are not on top of water refills..I drink a lot of water while I eat. 

So onto the food...hmm. Well the garlic bread was good. Hot and crispy! The first basket is free which is nice. Maybe I'm just stingy, but I was just a tiny bit annoyed to pay $2.50 more for another basket of bread. We decided on mozzarella sticks for an appetizer. They were hot and tasted like any other plate of mozzarella sticks. Tasty but nothing special about them. 

My main dish was the most disappointing :( I was stuck between trying their Alfredo sauce or their pesto! I asked our waitress which one she preferred, and she just suggested I do a creamy pesto sauce to have a little of both! I thought...oooh perfect! When it came out it smelled amazing and looked like it was going to be a great dish. I took the first bite, it was okay..then I took another and was I a little confused if I liked it or not. As I kept eating all I could taste was pesto and maybe a tiny bit of cream sauce. And the pesto sauce just did not WOW my taste buds what-so-ever. I honestly took at most 10 bites and was over it..I was hoping for a wonderful Italian dinner here, and didn't find it. Instead of trying another dish, I will just try another restaurant.

Made an 8:30pm reservations. Arrived at 8 which is early and we didn't mind waiting.  We checked-in at the front to let her know that we're there.  The table got ready at 8:15 but the lady keep calling the wrong name, first of all if you take down the name and we checked in providing the same name you figure she will get it right, but NO! She keep calling the wrong name so we ended up seated down at 9pm.

we sat down near the kitchen which is not bad as we witness the in and out of the waiters & servers. The waiter was nice and took our order and we trusted that he got all of our order right.  But NO! He forgot the most important order the ""desert"" 

we got our first order which is an appetizer, it took 30min for it to arrive and when it did it was cold . The food was good but it was cold. 
then our second order did not come until 30-45 min after the first course.  The second course was better, but what we didn't like is the manager. The Manager was standing by the kitchen watching his cooks, I have never seen a manager do that! most of the restaurant manager walks around and check people that are eating making sure that their customer is/are happy but not this one he was by far the most HORRIBLE MANAGER we have encountered and gives you an attitude (what the...) when you check your food, who does that! 

If you want good Italian food then come here but be prepared on the bad service specially the MANAGER.  The 2 stars is for the food!

Also, did I mentioned that their food is not cheap, you figured that the money they charge they will give you a better service, NOT!

My party of three and I shared the gnocchi with pesto and the cheese ravioli with vodka sauce. It was ridiculously delicious, since pasta has a tendency to be boring. The house salad was hardly boring and the desserts (yay for my birthday) should be declared illegal by the FDA for being capable of jump-starting a myocardial infarction.

We got there and immediately decided we should have scheduled a reservation. We waited almost an hour for a table, which we expected. I'm not complaining about this, it's just a fact.
We got our table and ordered our food. And barely saw our server after that. Which would have been fine if the food had been as as good as we were expecting it to be, especially for the price. The complimentary garlic bread we got was okay, but it tasted a lot like the Texas Toast you buy in the freezer section at the grocery store..

Fast forward one year: Nora's has built a multi-million new building 3 blocks east of their old location. It is state of the art and magnificent! What they left at the old location was good service and great food.

When we arrived, we encountered two young hostesses at the front desk with an aura of disdain and boredom. They told us there would be a 30 minute wait, or we could eat at the bar or on the patio. It was a beautiful evening, so we chose immediate seating at the patio. It was lovely on the patio.

We waited for about 20 minutes and flagged a passing waiter. He said our waiter was too busy, but he would try to take our order and pass it along. Yes this really happened. Another 30 minutes go by and we inquire about the status of our  dinner and drinks, the waiter apologizes and about 10 minutes  later our drinks arrive.

Our waiter finally shows up with Nora's signature garlic bread. It was cold and soggy, yeech!
Then our dinner arrived, even worse! It was tepid, aesthetically unpleasing and cold. It was actually awful.

We then tried to find grated cheese for our pasta, but gave up after ten minutes, asked for a check and paid for our mostly un-eaten, disgraceful meal.

Nora has really gone from the Ritz to the pits. A sad excuse of a restaurant. 

Please bring back the good old days when Nora was the best Italian restaraunt around. Today it is a pretty shell with awful food and worse service. It actually makes Olive Garden look appealing.",MrjvyojdHapN_o1zfeyT3g,0,0,1,vy5_lmWOyy-uDwJiNhESyQ

With the only options 4pm, 4:15pm and 4:30pm, we picked 4:30pm. When we got there at 4:20pm, not only the restaurant was full, the reception area was also full of people. When we finally made it through the crowd and get to the hostess, we were told that they just need to clear up a couple of tables then it'll be our turn. 

After couple minutes into the wait, I realized pretty much EVERYONE around us HAS MADE reservations. I hate to assume they overbooked but I guess I'd never find out what really was going on. Because we left empty stomach after standing in the annoyed crowd after an hour. By the way, my husband did check with them one last time before we left. The answer was the same, ""We just need to clear couple tables.""

Well, my three stars are for 1. The hostesses kept their sweet smile on even they knew everyone was hating them. 2. They dedicated one employee to serve the waiting crowd sparkling wine and she always came back with more. 3. Our love for Nora's based on our past experiences.

So obviously we were not happy and really disappointed with this one experience so I decided to leave this review and only three stars. Hopefully the owner and the management will notice their overall rating is going south since they moved into this new location and do something about it. Check out other reviews if you will.

I googled this place the other night, never heard of it and decided we'd try it out. As soon as I walked in, the feeling of a fine, classy, sophisticated, elegant italian place is the vibe you get. Not to mention, for its ""space"", it's adorable. Nice bar, live italian music playing and a good amount of well-dressed people have let me know this is a decent place.
We didn't have to wait very long which was nice. While we did wait, we were able to watch the cooks preparing authentic italian food. When we sat down everything was formal, almost as if we were on a  spot on the strip. Though the room started to remind me a little bit of an office building, the decor made up for it as the ceilings were decorated and the walls were dressed as if it may be your own grandmothers dining room. Cute. 
I enjoy when the servers are wearing vests because I know I will get the quality I want. But downfall was the server took a long time at first. The complimentary italian garlic bread is a bit buttery for my own diet but the fact it wasn't just a basket of butter packets and bread made this place a little different then the others & also, the fact that it had fresh, chopped garlic on it  as well made up for the too much butter .When we got our dishes the food was perfect and just enough. One of the dishes we ordered was the 'Alla Nora' and I'd recommend it if you like a robust meat sauce (bolognese)  with breaded eggplant - fried. Comes with spaghetti obviously. Not bad if this is one of their signature dishes -assuming.
For the lack of perfect service the girl made up for it by bringing us a complimentary dessert. Or was it because we told her it was our first time there? :) Either way, Tiramasu is definitely not my type of dessert but its the thought that counts.
I'd recommend this restaurant for a special birthday or a romantic, quiet dinner.

741040,2016-12-09,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Horrible service ruined this much anticipated experience. Made a reservation. Arrived 10 minutes early. Was able to see tables needed to be cleaned however no staff around to do it. Waited over 20 minutes past my reservation time to be seated due to no clean tables. Waitress treated us like an inconvenience however once we only ordered water for our beverage, I could tell by the look on her face that she knew it wasnt going to be a big ticket meal and she was annoyed. Waited another 15 minutes for bread. When she finally brought it she practically threw it on the table while walking by us. A different person brought us our food. She only followed up with us after a different person took our plates to bring us our check. Didnt even ask if we wanted anything else or dessert. 

I was hoping a manager would be circulating the room to ask us how our dining experience was. No such luck. I witnesses a short Asian guy in a grey suit running back and forth in front of the cooks but he NEVER approached a guest. 

My impression was this would be a classy place however the hostess is wearing nothing short of her work out clothes. I would have thought the hostess would have at least been dressed business casual or put on some real pants, maybe a pair of slacks but I guess this is the poor standard for Nora's.

I am a full time uber/lyft driver. I get tourists asking on a daily basis what are the good local restaurants. Once I saw Nora's had moved into their new location I thought I would try it out. I brought my Nephew who was visiting from out of state to try it with me. He is a waiter while finishing his last year of college. He was even disappointed with the service. 

I will not be eating here again. I will definitely NOT be recommending any business to Nora's. Too much competition in Las Vegas to waste my time to give them a second try. Its a shame they opened this beautiful location however forgot they are in the service industry.",DrvbRKDAogKN0nBkrnLIsQ,6,0,1,xMgFwUiESlWYL5Nrinxqkg

HOWEVER, even though we made reservations we had to wait endlessly for a table. We thought the new somewhat larger location would alleviate the wait problem, but I guess they just can't get organized. We may not return because of this.

After waiting with a crowd of people who had no reservations, near the door which was continuously cold & uncomfortable, we were finally seated last evening.  Still, until I saw that the manager (who was at the bar with other patrons) happened to notice that we were sitting there without water, bread or anyone acknowledging us or coming to the table,  a waitress magically appeared.  That was about 10 minutes.

To top it off, after the long uncomfortable wait, we were seated near a large noisy birthday party - a few of them were actually toasting above my husband's head.  I was waiting to see if they'd spill wine or food on him. - Private Parties?  Make them take a private room.

The calamari was typically mediocre, the same kind you'd get at Cheesecake Factory and the like.  The risotto balls were decent, though there wasn't much cheese or saffron in it.

There were three of us and we had a reservation for 7:30 PM on a weekday evening. We were quickly seated and given menus. The waiter kept prompting us to order drinks but only one of us wanted a glass of wine. We received a small basket of garlic bread which was OK. It was quite a while before our food order was taken and by the time our food arrived we had been there for 50 minutes. Two of us had the ""Crazy Alfredo."" The third person had the pasta with broccoli. That dish was so salty as to be inedible and was sent back. It was another 15 minute wait for it to be replaced.  The two of us who had the Crazy Alfredo both thought it was OK but nothing special. Same opinion from the person who had the pasta with broccoli.

Around 8:30 a female vocalist and her male musician accompanist began performing from a small stage at the front of the room. Mostly blues and song titles from the 40s & 50s. That was enjoyable.

Menu prices here were average for a restaurant of this caliber. Drink prices seemed high. A glass of ""house red wine"" was $9.50. Sorry to say, but there was just not much here to draw me back again.",85BQgqhjtrYsSECBDQ9mTw,1,0,2,y52OyiUxC0sHkxBL23hUUQ

Loved loved the garlic breads. It was cut into a bite sized and it was yummy and crispy. Not long afterwards came our menu. Mine sure look a lot lol...it's crazy alfredo with chicken, bell peppers, shrimp minus the sausage. It was rich and creamy...gosh....I'm in pasta heaven...it sure a class of its own.

I gotta believe I've been to Nora's at least 10 times since the last review so it gives you an idea how much I like the place.  What surprises me the most is the pricing - though I haven't been to Olive Garden in a long time I bet Nora's pricing is similar.

We went with the aracini rolls for an app, the crazy fettucini and spaghetti and meatballs for main event ( I was chastised for not getting a dessert .. next time ) - total cost $42 ( darn good value ) 

the food ?  gf felt the risotto rolls were ""old"" - I call BS on that - what do you want - make the risotto fresh, roll them up and put them in the fryer ?  she thought the oil might be old ...whatever, more for me !

the spaghetti and meatballs - above average - the balls might have been a little too dense ( ie no filler ) - sauce decent could have been a little thicker ( personal preference ) 

The crazy fettucini - your basic fettucini but they add sausage, chicken, shrimp and for a little bite - jalapeno's.  I liked it though maybe a little too much going on.

order came with garlic bread - my guess an entire head of garlic in one roll ! whew

He ordered us the anti pasta salad for us and recommended the seafood dishes. I'm not a huge fan of seafood if at all so I stuck with the pasta dishes. They have so many classic options and twists on classics as well. I decided for chicken Marsala which was really good. One of the better ones I have had. I will say it comes with a side of pasta but it was weird that it came with red sauce on top. Typically when I order chicken Marsala the wine sauce is served over pasta. The garlic bread they bring out is outstanding and we could have eaten that for an entire meal. The dessert was good too, we got the chocolate lava cake. The vanilla sauce is just so good.",fGFcJxYCs7DTp89Hxt5_sA,0,0,4,awmzu4FBHBghpzMtRLW4XA

1148135,2012-04-25,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Being second generation Italian, people ask me where my favorite Italian place in Vegas is, and Nora's is it.   But not the whole menu.  For me Nora's is about one thing, and that thing is the eggplant parmigiana (and the cannolli).

I'll get to the parm in a sec, but definitely start your meal out with one of Nora's family style salads.  We get the house salad, and even the generous portion is polished off easily by a group of four.  The garlic bread is a take it or leave it thing.  I've taken people here who thought it was great, and others thought it was okay.  The garlic ensures that you definitely need a breath mint after just one slice, and if you plan on locking lips with someone later on you may want to pass on it. 

I've eaten in Italian restaurants all over the country and they serve the best eggplant parm I've ever had.  Thickly cut with a meaty texture, fried to perfection and topped with a generous portion of mozzarella cheese, then popped in the oven (or salamander) it's to die for.  Maybe they put a little too much cheese on top, but I'm the type of guy that says you really can't put too much cheese on anything.  Also I'd get a side order of meatballs, they're top notch.

If you don't like eggplant I'd go with the baked ziti. It's served a little different, with balls of ricotta covering the top of the ziti.  The pizza is solid, but not NYC style, so if that's what you're used to, just order the eggplant.  They do make a white pizza which is kinda hard to find in Vegas. I would not order the chicken parm or the chicken Marsala, it's not made the way people are accustomed to, and besides, I told you to order the eggplant, so why are you looking at other menu items?


At the end of your meal I deplore you not to leave this joint without ordering cannoli.  They're just like momma made 'em, crisp shells filled with a sweet but not too sweet, creamily delicious ricotta, topped on one side with pistachios and the other chocolate chips.  I've also tried the tiramisu, which is very good, but takes up precious cannoli space in my stomach so I usually don't order it.

For me, going to Nora's and not getting the eggplant is like going to a steakhouse and ordering a side of veggies.  This is my go to place for some just how momma made it eggplant, meatballs and cannoli.",_8nmm7M1uEXquSUFAqm0fw,3,1,4,6jDMG8YHnSiK6s6KZ8qJNg

The ricotta on the pizza was so fresh it would melt in your mouth. The dough was just perfect. Not too heavy, not too doughy, not too thin, not too thick.

In addition during these busy times the front door host staff really struggle with the intensity of the traffic and tend to be really rude, short, curt and out-right offensive. Instead of greeting you or welcoming you to Nora's what you will tend to hear as you step up to the host is ""the wait time is....."" in the most frustrating tone imaginable. I spoke with the manager on duty in one of these instances who apologized and explained it was really busy which I understood and advised him that good customer service can never be undermined despite the greatest of food. I am a local and choose to come here also during the slow times of day when Nora's is pretty empty and tourists are out enjoying Las Vegas therefore my money and my business really matters. He again apologized and explained he would speak with the hosts. You decide, if you come in the evening between the hours of 6-10pm expect chaos, long wait times, limited seating as you wait, rude hosts and great food.",WuBkC_QzIq5__s5lYgqsAw,0,0,2,IkmvKAFG7tw5S07QbM-_tw

My wife and I both ordered fettuccine alfredo, and I'm sorry to report that there was absolutely no taste in the food.  There was no garlic, no flavors that you would expect in a (expensive) Italian meal.  When the waitress asked how everything was, we were very honest.  I explained that there was no flavor in the food, to which she apologized.  She brought terimisu (sp?) out complementary at the end, but again, even that lacked flavor.  I hate to say it, but Olive Garden has more flavor, and we despise going there!  This is my suggestion - go to the grocery store, buy your own ingredients, buy a bottle of wine, and have a stay at home date with your partner.

Located on the north side of flamingo, a little east of jones, came here on a Friday Night around 630 PM. The place was pretty full but luckily i guess we got there before the dinner rush so we got our table pretty quick. 

A LITTLE NOTE : uhh i think this place may have or rather should have some sort of dress code... i think we were the most underdressed table in the entire restaurant.. me and my friend were ok but my other friend had a bright blue t shirt.. lol uhh id suggest to dress a little nicer for this place... 

The restaurant is family owned. opened since 1991 starting with 12 seats ! quite expanded since then.. restaurant decorated with family pictures i believe which is nice. 

We were greeted by the server and got our drinks pretty quick. We had noticed that with a check in on yelp, you get a complimentary glass of wine :D 

After we ordered, it took a little while before the food came and we were starving.. they gave us some Garlic Bread which the first batch was free, but if u wanted more, i dont remember it being that expensive. It was yummy ! pretty much pieces you'd see if you split a loaf of french bread in half, baked it, and cut it into 1-2"" pieces down the split loaf. it was slightly baked.. I LOVE GARLIC BREAD ! their's still had a soft center with the exterior crust still being crunchy but not hard no wont pierce the inside of your mouth. 

When the food came... its was piping HOT !! i had the alla nora myself. which was a baked spaghetti with eggplants, ground beef, pesto, tomato sauce and cheeses. When i ""broke through"" the top, oh man there was a lot of steam ! not complaining ! very good thing that i rarely experience ! all the ingredients were fresh and seasoned well. egg plants were slightly fried but not over fried so still quite juicy and moist but soft. tomato sauce was fresh and delicious. sweet, tangy but savory? 

My friends had the rigatoni special and the crazy alfredo. i didnt really get to try either of them but im pretty sure you'd find a nice review on here somewhere. I tasted the veggies of the rigatoni special. Very fresh and sweet. Not overcooked so they still had a nice bite to it. The crazy alfredo looked delicious. Packed with various ingredients all with a creamy alfredo sauce ! i wanna get that next time ! 

But all in all.. great place.. highly suggested. reservations are available if needed. would suggest to all who ask and take more here :D",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,1,5,PZU23rprbRZyJ6bCUuC32A

Quick note about the ambiance. This location has WAAAAY too many tables crammed in. It's not intimate at all. It was loud and crowded. I had to shout to speak across the small table. This was an immediate turn off to me. They've clearly packed in as many tables as possible to maximize the number of guests that they can seat, however, the sacrifice is poor service and poor atmosphere.

Yesterday was my wife's birthday and we made reservations at 6:30pm. Her parents and her arrived at the restaurant on time and I arrived about 25 minutes later. They had already placed their order and there were some appetizers on the table when I got there. I have to say that the salad dressing had way too much vinegar in it for my taste. The calamari was good. The waiter came by to take my order. I ordered the rib-eye steak medium-well and substituted the fries for veggies. Nearly an hour later my steak comes out burnt to a crisp. I took one bite and flagged the waiter down to tell him that it was not edible. He takes it back and tells me that that's how they make a medium-well steak. I told him..""ok..make it medium-rare because I don't want a burnt piece of meat."" I wait another 30 minutes for a new steak to come out. This replacement was much better but still burnt around the edges. It was odd to me because it had even thickness all around but the outside ring was way more done (brown) than the center (bleeding). I'm thinking perhaps this was frozen and not properly thawed prior to being cooked. So I ate the $30 steak and was not very impressed because it had almost no taste and I was not offered any sauce to compliment it. Also, the ""veggies"" that I got were literally a small cup with some poor excuse for broccoli, sauteed tomatoes, and mushrooms. At this point my wife and her parents have been done with their food and it's already in boxes. They ordered a couple of pasta dishes and they seemed pleased with the food but did not rave about it. We decide to get a couple desserts (canolli and cheesecake) and a couple of cappuccinos. The cappuccinos came out in about 5 minutes alone. We didn't want them to get cold, so we drank them. The cappuccinos were actually VERY good. I'm sure they have a fancy espresso machine in the back. Then about 15 minutes later the desserts came out. While they tasted good, it would've been a much better experience if I would've gotten my cappuccino with my dessert. Overall I was EXTREMELY disappointed with entire dining experience. My family and I will be avoiding Nora's in the future as a result of this experience. In Las Vegas there is so much competition for Italian food and this experience really turned me off to this place.

Edited to add that I would've liked it if the manager on duty would've stopped by to ask about our service because I would've given them an earful. My wife was against me going to find the manager myself to give feedback because it was her birthday dinner and she just wanted to leave.",2e-_BVPBowP4ccOA1Lw1Ew,0,0,1,YeLBVqQOp_Uuhwqfvk3xVw

The food was pretty good though, so I'm sure I will be updating my review at some point in the future to comment on the actual restaurant!

The food that we had catered was the Chicken Parmesan, Meatballs, Fettuccine Alfredo and Penne with Marinara. 

The chicken Parmesan were smaller than I have typically had, but still delicious. I think it's because I am used to restaurants pounding the chicken flat and Nora's seemed to just cook the chicken breasts as they are. No big deal though as they were still flavorful. 

The meatballs were average sized and also had a good flavor to them - lots of red sauce, yum! 

The fettuccine Alfredo was great! The sauce was not to thick nor too runny - perfectly creamy and flavorful! The penne seemed a little dry to me for some reason though.

We ordered: pomodoro bruschetta, crazy pasta, and frutti di mare (subbed with arriabiata (sp?) sauce). Everything was so delightfully delicious!

If I could critique Nora's on any one thing, it would be ""charm."" That *something* was missing. What happens at a lot of Italian restaurants is that after a certain period of time, the family goes new school. They're no longer hands on, yet want to portray the image that the grandkids are running around the restaurant and grandma's making meatballs. That's likely what happened here. The restaurant was only Italian in the food, but overall vibe was not that.

We made reservations for 8:45pm on a Saturday night and the place was packed. It is located in a small strip mall and would be easy to miss. We were promptly seated and that is when everything started to go downhill. It took ~15 minutes to even get acknowledged and place our drink order. Their gnocchi and pasta are not made in house. I am not sure what would compel someone to pay $12 for gnocchi out of a package when I can get delicious gnocchi from Trader Joe's and toss in some pancetta for $5. I opted for their Frutti di Mare ($21) which was linguini in runny arrabiata sauce with an assortment of seafood. The husband had their carbonara which ranks among the worst I have ever had in the states. I am not even comparing this to Italy standards. While two of the three members of the party were still eating, one of the people's plates got taken away to be boxed up. Awkward. The server ignored our table pretty much most of the time and then rushed us out at the end. I would not come back nor recommend this place.

Luckily, a coworker insisted on dinner here so I finally got a chance to visit since their relocation, which puts their great food and attentive service (especially from Don!) in a suitably beautiful setting.

Started with a round of house salads, fresh with a great house dressing, plus their house garlic bread I raved about on my initial visit (spoiler alert: it's still amazing!). Tried the decadent carbonara, which I'll definitely be back for, but ultimately opted for my old standby, the Alla Nora (baked spaghetti topped with eggplant, meat sauce, and pesto) and was not disappointed. Kicked it up with a third course of chicken marsala and lamb shank, which was a huge, beautiful portion, perfectly cooked.  Might as well go big and have dessert after all that; the panna cotta topped with fresh berries was just sweet enough. I have no idea what witchcraft keeps me from thinking of Nora's when I want old-school carbs, but I'll be making a concentrated effort to visit more often.

After being seated, we saw a group of three arrive, with an elderly woman who was using a walker.  They were made to sit in the lobby for about a half hour, until the people at the table next to us left, and that table was cleaned off.  That was with the 5 tables still empty.

We ordered, and I ordered the ""Crazy Alfredo"".  It was described to be loaded with jumbo shrimp, chicken and sausage.  It showed up with two shrimp, two pieces of chicken, and some sausage.  It had a tasteless alfredo sauce on it, that was just warm starch.

My wife had Chicken Marsala, which I tried a bite of, and found it to be much too sweet.

Our waitress came by to take our order, and that was the last we saw of her.  Someone else brought out the garlic bread, (which was just ok), and the meals.

The salad was ample, with lots and lots of roasted peppers marinated with garlic, just like I make at home, but rarely bother to do.  The pasta portion was fine for me, having started with a salad, but I would have been wishing for more if that was the only thing I had ordered.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, while the sauce was tomatoey goodness.  I soaked up every bit with the complimentary garlic bread.  The food came out quickly and the waiter kept my iced tea refilled.  I was surprised at  how nice the dining room was, with white tablecloths and big windows letting in the sunlight.  The quality of my experience was way above the price I paid.  I'm looking forward to returning with a friend and maybe sitting at the lovely bar.",yh1cYqWWUfwMHp_4a8t51A,1,0,5,JPij4UouWXr6mQlUbk3HbA

Our table of 6 was ready 15 minutes early, ambience is very nice with a jazz band performing live after 9 p.m.  Service was very good except for the fact that each couple was served at separately rather than get help to bring out everyone's course at the same time.

As to the food, the steak bruschetta is very good as an appetizer but the caesar salad was terrible.  Hardly any dressing and very little parmesan cheese with no fresh pepper as a topper.  My wife ordered a chicken alfredo with boiled chicken and small portions compared to the mound of noodles with little sauce.  Her chicken was not seasoned at all.  I ordered the veal marsala which had great portions but was way overseasoned to the point I was chugging water and the spaghetti was not that good.

Dessert was tiramisu which is good but a little sweet.  Pricing is certainly the best part, our dinner was $83 for the 2 of us which included wine and dessert.

 It makes me sad, but we are extremely disappointed with our experience and food last night. First, I remembered having soup back in the day and it was yummy, so my sweet husband called to see about placing a to-go order since I am with a cold. First without even hearing what we want, the girl on the phone says ""It will be an hour & half for togo orders"" WTF.... ok but we just want soup. Which she replied ""ok anything else but that and I can't do it"" umm ok at this point I told my husband just hang up but he is way nicer then me to put up with that. SO we order for pickup 3 soups, 2 bowls and 1 cup (small was for my son), he brings it home and much to our dismay all were exactly 4 oz. of soup!!!!! 4 oz!!!!!!!! Seriously !!!!! it was a tiny little cup and he was told ""we don't do cups of soup anymore"" OK but where is the soup if this is your ""bowl"" of soup!!!!! I don't want a shot of soup! 

In regards to the food, that was sad sad excuse for a shot of soup I've ever had!!!! 
I can make chopped up onion & celery here at home, add water, salt & a crap load of pasta noodles and call it soup!!!!!! 

Today I will make my own soup and enjoy!!!

First the new location, while beautiful was horribly designed from a noise perspective.  You literally cannot hear people across the table from you...when I leave I sigh in relief because the din of the dozens of conversations at once has ended.   

I mentioned this on my first dining at the new location to the manager... I work in the studio sound business and I recommended Paul Tan or Acoustic consultants.    I noticed this trip one wall has tapestries on it, but they need some Rockwool (Roxul) or sound soak behind them.   We're not talking a bunch of money here....a few thousand bucks for a noticeable reduction in noise.   Though if they really did it right, it could cost close to $25K for maximum reduction

Nora's, the noise IS hurting your business.   Once the newness of the new location is gone...people like me may not come as often.

Walking in, it has an old Tuscan feel to it. It's dimly lit, bar is situated in the middle, and it gets pretty noisy. Our server was great! I think his name was Don. He kept our drinks and garlic breadsticks full! Speaking of the garlic breadsticks...omg they are the best thing ever. And they're complimentary! 

Onto the food!

Calamari: Yum! Fried and seasoned perfectly. It wasn't oily at all! I really enjoyed the sauce it came with. I'm not sure exactly what the sauce was but it tasted like a marinara and it was a nice change from the typical creamy, white sauce most other places give. 

Grilled octopus: I wished it had more of that char taste I was looking for. The texture itself was nice but it wasn't the most flavorful dish. I would probably skip next time. 

Lasagna: omg so. much. cheese! I did wish it had more meat sauce (l like saucy lasagnas). This is definitely not for someone who's lactose intolerant. But then again, who takes that seriously? Lol kidding. 

Crazy Alfredo: I really enjoyed this dish! It has a nice kick of spice from the jalapeños. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the dish had the right amount of sauce on it. 

Osso bucco: this was so tender! Comes with mashed potatoes. 

Ribeye (came with truffle fries): We asked for it to be cooked medium and it was perfect! It had the nice char and wasn't chewy at all. It comes with a side of truffle fries which I am all about! 

Most of the entrees could be shared, such as the osso bucco and crazy Alfredo. They're huge! 

Overall I do recommend this place. It's nice that it's not on the Strip and the prices are reasonable. The food and service was excellent. Only thing I wasn't down for was the noise level. It gets LOUD.

4. Penne w/ Arrabiata sauce & sausage.

I'm hoping to one day venture out of the ""ravioli box"" and try one their pizza's or maybe some seafood?  But I love what get every time, that it's so hard to try something different!

Noras recently moved to a new location just a few blocks east of where they've been forever . Beautiful restaurant and excellent decor. Place is stunning . Had a 645 reservation on a Tuesday for a 30th b day party. Only four of us.  Wasn't seated until 700pm. Had to flag down the manager and ask why walk ins were being seated before us?  Eventually he sat us and bought us a round of drinks. Don was our server as he has been for many other visits and did a great job as always. Appetizers came out in a timely fashion 10-12 minutes but we waited a full hour to get our entrees. This is not an exaggeration . Manager Dan was apologetic and compensated our table with many rounds of drinks and a reduced bill, but that's not why we visit Nora's.  I did not want a free drink (was drinking sprite) i wanted to enjoy my meal.  The food is always spot on but they were not ready to open at the new building. The kitchen was buried , one hour for entrees is inexcusable.  He said they are working on getting ready for the Grand Opening which is in a couple weeks which made us feel unimportant.  That is why you run a play day and a soft opening with friends and family of the employees to work out the kinks before opening to the public.  It was an awkward dinner to say the least.  We will return eventually but not any time soon.  I put this on the owner of Nora's not on the manager or server.

The food is good in that carb laden, dripping in cheese and sauce way that is absolutely yummy to eat, but requires a double trip to the gym the next day to work off the guilt. Additionally, the portions are large so the overindulgence brings on the required nap afterward. One of the best lemon drop martinis in a long while, however my pizza was very good in flavor, but too heavy in crust and cheese-almost dripping-and while i favor a thicker crust-it was almost like eating a loaf of bread which was too much for my taste. Prices are right, service is prompt, taste is good, just will keep this for a very very occasional if the goal is to eat a bit lighter.",C3-__jJNxwbR5Rvr-CaW1g,0,0,3,3bV4vNBqfa93v1LGv04x-Q

And OMG the pistachio chocolate is to die for!!! The best dessert you will ever have if you like pistachios and chocolate. You have to order it early because they make it fresh when ordered so I recommend ordering it right when u sit down to make sure there won't be a wait when you are ready for it. It's got a warm melty center and soft outside drizzled in the pistachio sauce. I cannot tell you how good this is. This restaurant has been my favorite for years and will continue to be as long as they keep doing what they are doing!

So I step inside and the first face I see is old baby blue eyes. It's too bad that this and a street name is all we got left of him in Vegas.

The hostess was distracted with takeout orders when I entered and I was left waiting for more than five minutes at the front. After I was seated, I was greeted by the server, who addressed me as ""sir"", which would normally be awkward for me but came off as polite in this instance.

My bread and drink came out relatively quickly. The bread was a garlic toast which was a little on the soggier side and not so garlicky. 

I ordered the ""crazy"" Alfredo, which is the standard fettuccine Alfredo with jalapeños, sausage, chicken, and mushrooms. I guess somebody was eating pizza and decided the toppings would be just as well in a pasta. The peppers really did overpower everything else in the dish as it was hard to even taste the Alfredo sauce. The pasta was cooked correctly but the taste was not all that great.

The check took a while to come out so I would say that the service is inconsistent here.

Perhaps they realized they didn't put enough in the pot and added some a few minutes later...? Who knows. They use ham in the carbonara. It was like they rolled up a bunch, cut it and threw in the. They didn't separate the pieces. There was so much ham I couldn't taste anything else. I spoke to the manager and showed him my plate. He agreed that there was too much ham in the dish. We didn't discuss the other issues. He asked me if I wanted it remade but I didn't. I had to go in search of a manager because I couldn't get the waiter to come to my table.

Unfortunately for us, they made us wait for a bigger table because Rachel brought her son. I didn't think that it was necessary to make a reservation for 5 people because he's a toddler and sits in a high chair, but whatevs. We had to wait an additional 15-20 minutes to be seated because of this, so by the time we sat down I was hangry. 

Our server was nice, but service was slow the whole time. We ordered drinks and then ordered our food. We didn't receive appetizers, salads or bread for *at least* 30 minutes. The bread was good, super garlicky and buttery. The salad was yummy, and I enjoyed the house Italian that came on top. Finally after what seemed like forever, our main courses came. I had the chicken parmesan with spaghetti alfredo, and my boyfriend had the baked rigatoni special and a side of meatballs. The baked rigatoni and the rigatoni special are separate entrees. The rigatoni special has meat and the baked rigatoni does not, but he asked if he could have both put together and they accommodated him. It looked so cheesy and delicious, but I was too busy enjoying my delicious cheesy chicken parm to even ask for a bite. He said it was amazing. The meatballs I tried and they were good, but a little cold on the inside. We all sat in silence for a good 15 minutes eating. We all agreed that it was a delicious meal and no one had any complaints.

Even after all that food, Rachel and I ordered the chocolate lava cake for dessert, because YOLO. The cake has to be ordered when you order your entrees, because they are made to order. This cake was nothing short of delicious. It came hot out of the oven, garnished with pistachio crumbs and a sweet vanilla sauce. When I dug into the cake, I got a spoonful of hot, creamy chocolate and it was divine.

The restaurant was bustling when my date and I arrived, but we were sat immediately.  Somewhat annoying where we got placed though, which was a seat near the server's station.  They should move that table further down.  During the busiest hours, I'm sure it'd be annoying with servers going around you, ""excuse me, excuse me, coming through, whoops.""

Food was fine.  I've had better Italian, but the food is fine for its price.  Nothing mind-blowing, the pasta could be softer, but that's just my preference.  Other than that, the seafood and the sauce was spot on.  My date got just regular chicken alfredo.  She hadn't tried that restaurant (although it was she who suggested the place).  She also would've liked her pasta softer, so maybe it isn't just me.

2146366,2010-02-04,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Our dinner last night at Nora's was our fourth since we discovered it about ten years ago when we asked an Italian employee at the Venetian where to get great Italian food in Las Vegas. He said quite assuredly, ""Let me tell you about all the restaurants in the Venetian."" Then he leaned in and whispered, ""Now let me tell you where to go eat. Nora's."" 

His recommendation was a good one! 

Our first visit to Nora's was probably our best experience - the flush of ""first love"" for what was at the time a little known, truly ""mom and pop"" venture located about four miles off the strip and tucked behind an Arby's in a strip mall.. There were four of us, close friends, we walked in on a Friday night without reservations and ate in the bar...which may even have been the only eating area at the time...where we had a wonderful pasta entrees, shared appetizers and desserts and with bottle of Sicilian red wine and the entire bill was just about $100. 

Time marches on, Nora's has been discovered (even it seems through a visit from Food Network - alas).  Reservations are not only recommended but essential.  The wine prices have gone WAY up. The menu seems to have been pretty static for each of our four visits to Nora's  and while our meal last night was good, and we still recommend it to those who want traditional Southern italian food, there are so many options now in Las Vegas for Italian fare that our visit last night may have been our last to our ""old friend"". (One of those options is Nora's Wine Bar, owned by the ""sons of Nora"".) 

The low point of the meal for two at Nora's last night was the antipasta.  Nora's preparation, with Italian deli meat, canned black olive slices and grated mozzarella on top of blandly dressed lettuce, just didn't ""cut it"".

But the linguini friutti di mare that followed was wonderfully prepared with succulent mussels, clam (not in shells), shrimp and calamari rings and tentacles (yesssss) in a well seasoned red sauce. A glass of Barbara and a glass of Nebbiolo plus two desserts (espresso tartufo and cannoli) brought our bill to about $75 which we thought was a good value for the quality of the meal and the friendly service. 

The yelp reviewers who have cheered about the chocolate cake are right...the Valrohna chocolate cake with the molten center that is served warm is delicious. But the espresso tartufo, coated in a chocolate shell, and the cannoli are both worthy contenders.  The tartufo may be among the best we've ever had of that dessert option. 

We noted that on a Tuesday night in a bad economy, Nora's was still doing gangbusters. all tables full by about 8:00 in a mix of what seemed to be local regulars and tourists like us. The enduring popularity of this little place is well earned.",3CwMwbY9UgP-qvTDxNs_0g,1,2,4,dE18eU4wseiq6vr0zMeyJg

The old location used to be a tiny kitchen with only about 4 tables to eat at. They expanded twice and now have moved to a completely new location. I have dined in all the locations and have never been disappointed 

Nora's is the best Italian food I have ever had. I have tried countless Italian restaurants and nothing compares. I used to complain that other Italian food was gross and actually wouldn't even eat any other Italian food for a while. Not only is it the best in Vegas, but it also holds as the best over many other restaurants in other cities. 

Spaghetti and meatballs are a classic but the best I've ever had. Penne ala vodka is amazing. Penne with broccoli sauce and chicken (not on the menu but they always make it for me) is so good. Really I'm not even going to continue because everything on the menu is divine. 

The Mauro family is amazing. They've always taken care of my family and I, and we are so grateful for that. Not only do they put out the best Italian food in Vegas, but even in their homes. Their rich Italian culture has been brought out in their loving natures and food-filled parties. 

Truly the best Italian restaurant (and one of the best restaurants in general) in Vegas, backed up by one of the best families!!!",izfWQA3OBPyFh-FiGPzScQ,0,0,5,FbSHlkRf1EX9hPbmUVIQLw

Service
Overall very polished! We had a reservation on a Monday night and were seated about 10 minutes after our time. The place was packed!  We were promptly greeted by the server, and he was attentive throughout always refilling our soft drinks quickly. The meal was well-paced and not rushed nor slow. Fresh silverware was provided after each course - a small touch, but don't you hate going to a restaurant and being told to ""keep your fork!"" as if they only allow one per guest. A bus boy graciously packed our leftovers for us which we appreciated. 

Ambiance 
Sorry Lola, Nora wins here hands down. Modern upscale interior. Extremely classy. No booth seating, however, so when it's crowded it doesn't feel too intimate or private.  

Food
Truly exceptional.  Lola might have the slenderest advantage, but wow it's a close call. We started with two wonderful cocktails including a peach Bellini. Tasty and great presentation. We had some soft drinks too which were constantly refilled. We had arancini as an appetizer which was ok.  A bit mushy on the inside. Then a Caesar salad which was very good. Truly tasty dressing and fresh lettuce. The garlic bread was exceptional!  We had read on Yelp only one basket per table was allowed, but we asked for more which wasn't an issue at all (no charge). It would honestly be pretty gauche for a place like this to charge for more bread. Entrees were... amaze balls! Chicken Parmesan and pork fillet. Wow. Huge portions (see photos) and both were flavorful tasty meat. The pasta with the chicken was wonderfully al dente.  Very large portions (plenty leftover for both). For dessert a slice of spumoni (so so tasty and flavorful) and bread pudding. The bread pudding - wow!  Not like the typical dry bread but so soft and moist like a custard. Lola's is similar, so this must be an Italian style bread pudding. So delicious - you mustn't pass this up!!

Mojo
Overall an outstanding place with great service and exceptional Italian food. Lola's might take a slight edge for its homey authentic atmosphere and overall taste, but if you aren't up for a trip to Ohio you must (really you MUST) eat at Nora's!!  Total bill for two cocktails, an appetizer and a salad, two entrees, and two desserts was about $100. Very reasonable for the quality of the food!",TGSi0e7-ovol_PBIQgodOg,2,1,5,DK7AZMLIxBz34Ml8mh7htg

2186131,2017-06-29,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"FOOD: Ok

SERVICE: Poor... Very poor. 

CLEANLINESS: The appearance and cleanliness is very good. 

Beyond the above, this was our ""wish we can hop in a DeLorean and go back in time to avoid this place"" experience. Just a note: it's fairly long, which is why I already put the key things above. So read beyond this if you'd like. If not, I totally understand. 

This was our wedding anniversary. At our hotel, an employee recommended this place to us. We do have this one other place we absolutely love, but I'll get into that later.... So, we decided to give Nora's a try.  We made reservations for four.  Upon arrival, we were seated in a timely manner. But this is where things came go a stop....That's exactly how it felt from the moment we were seated. 

We waited. Waited. And waited. Finally, someone asked for our drink order. Another stoppage moment. Waited. And waited. A waiter, I think Sebastian or Sebastia, hurriedly comes to our table and repeatedly apologizes for the long delay. Oh yes. This dude was very aware of our wait. He went on how he has to cover the other side of the restaurant. Not a few tables in the same section. But the other side that you cannot see from where we are sitting. Apparently, he's the only Italian speaking waiter and this large party on the other side who spoke Italian, needed attending to. 

Okay. Our only thought was ""So, why doesn't management or the owner step in?"" Why don't they be proactive and have someone cover his tables while he attends to something they are unable to do?""  Makes sense, right? I mean, if he has to step away because he is the only Italian speaking waiter, this will take time away from his other customers. This was not done. And boy did we pay the price. 

Here's the deal... we waited ONE FULL HOUR till our food arrived at the table. Yes, you read that right... one hour. I even told him ""do you realize your repeated 'sorry, but you have to do something else' had us waiting for one hour?""  And I kid you not, this was his answer... ""I'm so sorry."" I don't know what was more sorry... choosing Nora's or this guy's attitude to put on a disappearing act followed by the only line in his one-man show: ""I'm sorry.""  I mean, it was that bad!  

In Los Angeles the stereotypical thing is that many waiters are  ""actors"". So I'm guessing being in Vegas, Sebastia, has a desire to be a magician and one day headline his own show on the Strip. I mean, he has certainly mastered the art of illusion with his service. David Copperfield, if you're looking for a protege, this is your guy. I can vouch for his disappearing act. 

In the end... Families. Couples. Out-of-towners. Newlyweds. Honeymooners.... we would not recommend this to anyone at all. This was a horrible experience for us. It didn't help that the food was just ok, too. But that service... by far the longest wait we have ever experienced. And the lack of having someone, whether it's management or anyone of authority to recognize this and be more proactive about the situation... talk about being complacent.  The respect for the paying customer: Zero. 


So back to that one place we absolutely love.... There is a silver lining to this whole thing. You see, no matter how crazy or unprofessional these moments might seem at times, always know this: You have the ultimate decision to do whatever it is you want to do. So rather than making this wedding anniversary dinner at Nora's spoil our Vegas trip, the next evening, we decided to return to the place we love... PIERO'S. The host has always been incredibly professional. The servers: A whole different level of service, and I'm talking amazing service . If you were to peak behind you at times, you would notice another staff standing by to make sure you were attended to. You know how you sorta look around, and they catch this, then someone says, ""Yes, is there anything I can get for you?""  And best part of Piero's... being this was our anniversary all over again - the host sat us at the booth they used in the movie ""CASINO"". 
The scene where Robert De Niro and Sharon Stone sitting at their booth. Although the movie used a different name, this was the restaurant, Piero's. 

Good luck to all. It is your money. It is your valuable time; especially to those from out of town, time is very short and you want to make the best of it.",V_vc008-2umfV4m80LWzPQ,0,0,1,nqnhu5mm8e2oSrS6C6wASA

Next I split the truffle fries ($5.50) which whomever I happen to be eating with.   The sauce the give you is delicious and I always have to ask for a bonus sauce.  

For the main course it's either the cannelloni with ricotta and spinach or baked ziti (they use a different kind of noodle but basically same stuff).  Both are really good.

Called a little a head of time to make reservations that night. We pulled up to a strip mall, next to a bowling store.. OK so the outside wasn't fancy, but as soon as you get in the doors you understand why people aren't scared to return. The interior is decorated very upscale, except for the white paper table cloths. Our party walked in around 6pm and the place was packed, already people waiting for tables to be seated.. As soon as you enter the restaurant a wall of deli shes garlic smells make your mouth water. As we waited the few minutes, we got to enjoy watching the cooks, cook in the kitchen, which is placed right in the middle of the restaurant. We got seated near the bar and got to watch all the locals sit down and wind down. It looked like they had some fancy martini's if your into that kind of stuff.. 

As soon as we sat down we were served a huge bowl of garlic bread, no extra cost. And they didn't skimp at all, I mean this was a huge basket of really yummy garlic bread. Our wait staff was on their game this evening, filling glasses of water, and refilling the garlic bread basket a few times. We also ordered a small salad for an app. The salad was no where near small, it feed the four of us. 

We all ordered our food, someone got chicken Marsala's, another got the lasagna, and I got the Alfredo Carbon. The portion sizes where huge, and the food was great!

We had a resi at 8 on a Sunday, and waited about 10 minutes passed that for a table. Once we were sat we weren't greeted. Ever. Not by a busser, not by a manager, and definitely not by a server. 

We were right up front by the hostess stand, so we asked one of the 4 girls standing there if maybe our server didn't know we had been sat, and they assured us one would be right there. After nearly 15 min, we abandoned ship to dine at the bar. If we hadn't had our hearts set on the meal, we would have left for sure! Our equally unattended neighbors were jealous that we had found 3 seats, especially since they had been sat before we even walked into the building. 

Once we secured some service, we found that Adam was a fantastic bartender, and the only redeeming thing about the visit. He was prompt, attentive, and personable. We appreciate that he took care of a round in apology for the slow service. 

Food was good as always, even if it was missing a certain je ne sais quoi. 


I think what bothered me the most is that after we sat and waited unacknowledged for so long at a table, we saw tons of staff standing around and holding up the walls for the duration of the meal. The chefs looked unoccupied, 3 waiters and bussers milled about while the bartender's trash can overflowed (even after he asked for a clean up), and none of the signature Nora's service quality was present. No folded napkins when guests went to the restroom, a woman dropped her pepper flake shaker and went unassisted with 2 young waiters remarking that someone had broken a plate (couldn't be bothered to break off their conversation and pick it up), and just general lack of genuine interaction that I loved before. It used to be like dining at the mob's table, and now it's a one-off Cheesecake Factory.

The service for us was below expectation. Trey was Inattentive to say the least. I could see him leaning against a wall by the bar instead of checking to see how the food was or if we needed anything. They had a band jazzing it up at 9PM, which certainly set the mood.

2276763,2007-06-16,1,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Nora's is an off the strip delectable Italian eatery in Las Vegas.  Located in a strip mall near an Arby's, it's a completely unexpected treat!  Last weekend my entire family (and some friends too) descended upon Las Vegas to celebrate my Grandfather's 90th birthday.  The big birthday bash was held at Nora's (a place my dad saw on the food network).  They seated all 40 of us on the bar side of the restaurant where we mostly took over the place.  

Since our party was so large we had a preset menu all served family style.  Caprese salad, antipasti salad, garlic bread, calamari, pene with vodka sauce, eggplant parmigiana, chicken marsala, seasoned pork tenderloin with parmesan crusted potato wedges, tiramisu and canoli!  Oh my God I'm full just thinking about how much food I ate that night!  All that for $35 a person.  The food was excellent...especially the garlic bread, calamari, marsala, eggplant...ok all of it was awesome.  

The service was ok, but considering the number of people they had to contend with, I won't knock off a star.  They didn't even mind when we set up the gigantic poster board display of Grandpa's past 90 years on top of their beverage service table and they let us decorate with birthday banners and trinkets.  They also didn't mind when my dad and uncle got into a brotherly wresting match and broke one of the sparkling water bottles on the beverage service table....they just came over and cleaned it up.  

All and all it was a good time with good food and crazy company!  I would like to go back to Nora's to have the non huge group of people dining experience.  Plus I need to have more of that garlic bread, cause it was damn good.  Congratulations Grandpa on 90 years!",aKDe5qvoYT_1jdMOalehmQ,2,2,5,H2QgwqE0_HlhtyztJshh5w

First, the parking situation was horrible. On a Wednesday night, there's no parking... people were parking in the dirt or the plaza across the street. There is always a wait.

Most recently when I went, I made a reservation a week ahead of time for a party of 12. We arrive on the dot and ended up waiting 20 minutes for the table, only to find the table to be very cramped for the large party. The service was horribly slow. We had to ask multiple times for the [delicious] bread. We waited probably around 1 hour for our main courses... which came out dry. We ordered a good variety from pasta to fish to fillet mignon to osso buco. Nothing was prepared right. The meat was over cooked, the pasta was oily and you can tell it was sitting under the heater too long cause the sauce was dried onto the plate around the edges, and the flavors were just not there.

I understand this place is busy, but the server just never seems to be around. They never seem to have the beer selection from their menu. 

Only redeeming thing is the busser was always around to ensure we had water and drink refills.

Anyone got good recommendations for a new Italian restaurant? I'm open to suggestions at this point.",JY0rvs_4HBjXKdRB07aEnQ,5,2,2,TMSK5_tJj7laTkuu1y5MdA
2302661,2010-12-17,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"I guess I had high hopes when I finally had the time and reason to go to this restaurant,  I was thoroughly underwhelmed.  I have heard of Nora's Cuisine from tons of people.  They always say they are the best at Italian cuisine.  I for one as I said, was underwhelmed.  We had their garlic bread basket and all have to say is that it is definitely garlicky!  I am not sure if it's the an area that they're representing, but whatever it is, the food either was under seasoned or intentionaly just bland.  I ordered the Chicken Masala that came with a side of pasta with tomato sauce.  The Marsala was cooked very well and tasted awesome.  The side of pasta was another thing altogether.  The pasta was way too al dente!  The sauce lacked any seasoning.  It's like they opened a tomato sauce can and just put iton top of the undercooked pasta. My partner ordered the Chicken Parmigiana.  I don't know about you but I always associate parmigiana with a bread crusted, flattened chicken breast.  Apparently, that ain't so!  The chicken wasn't breaded at all.  He also has the same complaint about the tomato sauce: bland.  After a lackluster dinner, we opted to have the chocolate souffle which we ordered at the beginning of the meal.  I have to say, this concoction of chocolate souffle with vanilla sauce and pistachio was pure heaven.  But this dessert won't change my review of Nora's.  

One other point of contention that this place needs to revise: their waiters just plain suck!  The waiter in charge of our drinks was very attentive, but the main waiter who took our order barely showed his face.  We had questions and he wasn't around.  When he was around and we asked why the chicken wasn't breaded for my partners' Parmigiana, all he said was, ""I don't know.  Weird right?"". I was baffled to say the least.  We finally got our answer by looking it up on Wikipedia.

I have to say, Nora's really FAILED to impress me.  For our 4 year 11 month anniversary(we're leaving Las Vegas and wanted a nice celebration in the city before we left), Nora's just didn't deliver the ambiance we were looking for.

First order is free with meal and second order they charge a small fee I think $2.  The meat lasagna was pretty tasty but little on the small side.

2318624,2011-07-24,1,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"I'm always looking for places where the locals eat - chain restaurants are the same everywhere (which I suppose is their appeal).  Nowhere is this more true than Las Vegas.  Everywhere a traveler goes is greeted by chains, cheap ""bargain"" places that scare me, or fancy culinary experiences that may be great, but not necessarily affordable by a family of four.  That's why it's worth finding what the locals like.  Nora's Cuisine is such a place.  

Our first mistake was not making a reservation - its very busy on a Saturday night with an active, upscale bar crowd and live music.  We sat in one of two other rooms which was also very nice and not too noisy.  

The food was quite good and very reasonable, especially considering that the portions were large and filling.  The menu was varied and interesting, so my two picky eaters were happy.  

Make no mistake; I've had much better Italian food, but this place was comfortable, friendly, not too fancy (Jeans OK, shorts no), and good service for a decent price.  The next time in Vegas, I'll probably return.",Tkf835w9SXFTzTQbAkWWSQ,1,1,3,mWelDCE8KpgZSOGqmQUcAQ

My gf and I double dated with another couple here late on Friday night. I was a bit worried to sit down for dinner after 10:30, but my worries were quickly dismissed upon arrival. 

There was a band playing some jazz music in the room to the right and we were seated far enough away from the band to where we could talk but still hear the music faintly in the background. I was very happy about this because sometimes loud music blaring in my ears can be a turn off during dinner time. I like conversation, what can I say. 

I discovered that upon checking in on Yelp, I received a free glass of wine. AMAZING! Our friends ordered the sangria which they could not stop raving about! I highly suggest ordering this if you love sangria because it is some of the best I have ever had. 

We began our meal with an order of Arancini. I've never heard of or seen this on a menu before, but when my girlfriend saw them she went nuts. They looked like meatballs but were fried balls of risotto, cheese, peas, and meat sauce. Incredible! I could have eaten ten of them! Our waiter also brought out a basket of garlic bread and I thought it was excellent. 

We opted to share the special for the evening upon our server's recommendation, which was Chicken Mount Etna. This dish was really unique. I have never had anything like it. The chicken was cooked perfectly with some mozzarella cheese and peppers and was served on top of crispy, fried, angel hair pasta (think ramen noodle texture?) with a balsamic sauce/reduction and topped with onion strings. Strange combinations for an Italian restaurant, but REALLY REALLY GOOD. I cannot stress the deliciousness enough. It was a perfect portion for us to share, but I couldn't resist ordering a side of penne a la vodka (I'm a sucker). Their vodka sauce was delicious! 

For dessert, we pre-ordered the warm chocolate cake. I'm not a chocolate cake fan, but my gf loved it as did the rest of the table. 

Our server was amazing. My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions. Even though we were one of the last tables in the restaurant because we started late, I did not feel rushed or get the vibe that they were waiting to go home. Everything was perfect. 

I recommend this spot for a date night, dinner with friends, or any time you want some home cooked, reasonably priced, off the strip Italian food.",1pqyIOcWh-EEHOR9AHUkWA,3,3,5,4g8MB4QfArzNwgfIG1Dpgg

I really like the design and atmosphere of the new place, and I'm glad they decided to relocate to a new building. It really sets to mood for Italian cuisine. We arrived passed 10 PM on a Friday night and they had plenty of seating. The hostess was friendly and seated us promptly. I forgot what our waiter's name was, but he was really attentive and friendly as well. 

I ordered the lasagna and my friend got the ravioli with meatballs, and we shared a house salad. My friend said that her meatballs were cold, but the waiter put in another order and they were out right away. I usually order their specialty items which I really enjoy, but this time it was a little on the plain side. The lasagna was lacking a bit in flavor, however it was a big portion and I had leftovers for the next day. The house salad was good and fresh, although I prefer their Antipasto salad because it's huge and filling plus it comes with plenty of ingredients. Oh, and we also ordered the Sangria which was quite tasty! 

Overall, it was a great experience especially since we stayed till after 1AM! And they didn't even rush us out or anything! There were still two tables on the bar side of the restaurant, and they didn't seem to be in a hurry to leave even after we left. I felt so bad because I didn't even realize that it was so late! So when I realized, I was so embarrassed and I immediately began to apologize the the staff. The staff was really nice and laid back, and they reassured me that it was completely okay because there were still customers eating and it's often the case that they stay very late to clean up. It just seemed like a regular day at the office to them, except they had such great attitudes about it. I presume that they have good management, because it really shows in their attitudes! If I could rate it with a 4.5, I would...I would have usually given a 5, but this time I felt the food was lacking that punch.

i thought the service was great (waiting on nine young loud women for a pre-bachelorette dinner can't be easy, but the general boisterous atmosphere helped) - our waiters told us about the group menu option since we were a group of nine, and that made things so much easier. thus, we were able to eat family style and we tried a variety of reliably good dishes, including gnocchi, veal marsala and meatballs. for $22 per person, it was a great deal, esp given the amt of food we got.

The first garlic bread you order is free, and nothing tastes better than free food! The bread was soft and they use real ground garlic on it, unlike some cheapie places. We also preordered the chocolate cake because it takes 25 min to prepare, but our waiter forgot to put it in, and gave us the tirimisu for free which was really nice.

They serve complimentary garlic bread which is SUPER garlicky so OF COURSE I loved it. 
We started with a House Salad which wasn't bad. I ordered the Frutti Di Mare - Our server asked if I liked spicy at all and I said Yes! Make it EXTRA spicy. I ordered Spaghetti and Meatballs for Hunnie Bunnie and he asked if I would like to just do a Side of Spaghetti and Meatballs? Yes for sure! 
The side came out and was the perfect size for her with one giant meatball on top. 
Mine came out and the seafood was fantastic - LOTS of calamari and BIG mussels and shrimp! It wasn't spicy though so I dumped red pepper flakes on it.

Our waitress, whom according to the receipt, Nina, was very un-warm and  un-welcoming. She did not greet us cheerfully, she did not ask us about appetizers. I had to ask to start with one. Her demeanor was one of discontentment, almost like she ""got stuck"" with our table. Maybe she pre-judged us because we had a 9 month old with us, I don't know. My mom asked for lemon in her water, which she did not get. When she refilled my wife's tea, she only refilled mine about 3/4ths of the way. When the main entree came and she was removing the dishes, my mom said ""oh my fork"" and went to grab it, my wife witnessed her roll her eyes to the other staff member who was helping put the entrees down. Several times I saw her run her forearm across her nose to wipe it as she came from the kitchen. She never asked about desserts. She just had a subtle arrogance in her demeanor, almost as if she were somehow part of the family who owns the restaurant and she can do as she pleases, she kept going and chatting with the staff and sorta every now and then looking towards us. At the end, my mom asked her if she would take a picture of us and her reply was ""can I clean the table first?"" A few seconds later she did try to smooth it over by saying ""oh I like a clean table."" But her overall attitude was just rude. She wasn't busy running around with other tables to make this request a hassle. Overall food was good, and hostess was good, busser was good, atmosphere and new building and location were good.

My buddy asked a local to recommend a good Italian restaurant. Without hesitation, Nora's was the choice. Since it was only a couple miles west on Flamingo we decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed. 

Our party of five arrived at 4:30 on a Friday and the place was already busy. However they were able to seat us in about five minutes. Great start. The server, whose name I wish I could remember, was wonderfully friendly. In fact, every one who worked there had a wonderful disposition while hustling to provide great service. We were very impressed. 

The dishes ordered by us included two dishes of spaghetti with marinara, one with sliced Italian sausage, Linguini and Clams (clams both in the shell and mixed in with the pasta), Spinach Cannelloni (my choice), and cheese tortellini with marinara. We also ordered a house salad served family style which was wonderful. There is also strips of garlic bread served with dinner. 

All the dishes were raved about. The servings were large without being ridiculous. My wife only was able to eat half of the Linguini and Clams, but since our hotel room had a mini-fridge she was able to take it back for a late-night snack. My Spinach Cannelloni has (of course) spinach, fresh pasta, ricotta cheese, mozzarella, covered in a tomato sauce. I was a little nervous about the tomato sauce but I needn't be. It has a wonderful flavor that complemented the stuffed cannelloni. Delicious!

Next trip to Vegas we will be back. Without a doubt one of the best meals we've had in the city in our many years of coming. Prices are also very reasonable for what you get. Great food, great service, great dining experience!",psRiCvu6WEJTbpTfa2ebfA,0,0,5,m4RE3WCSDdsbPGbsF7XXQw

Nora's is a more upscale Italian restaurant and now they finally have the location that expresses how great they are. This family owned restaurant serves up great food with amazing customer service. 

Food:  For all the carb lovers, this place is a must go! You start off with some amazing garlic bread! This is made with fresh garlic and grilled to perfection. 
For starters, their salads here are AMAZING! They have the greatest antipasto salad I've ever had with a rolled up cheese/meat combination thrown into a great, fresh salad 
The crazy alfredo is the best item on the menu (and quite possibly the best item at any Italian restaurant). This is a must try!! 
For desserts we had the luxury to try the cannoli and Tiramisu. Both are five star and must at this restaurant. 

Service: we went on one of the busiest nights (Saturday on Valentine's Day weekend). And with that, the service was phenomenal. With a reservation, we were sitting down within 15 min and our appetizer was at our table within 5 min after ordering. 

I must acknowledge 2 people who went out of their way to make my Valentine's Day that much better! Jessika and Dayton both WENT ABOVE and BEYOND to make an amazing experience. 

Price: $15-$20 per entree. Our bill was $61 for 2 people (but we did get appetizers).",iYpP1bb2LN5RJaucO4Azlg,0,2,5,v1RU5uMMZCE3KTSyZjLyuQ

The whole plate can fill you up without having an appetizer. We also ordered the cannoli for dessert. It's homemade with 100% riccotta cheese, bits of pistachio, and mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.

Went in for the 1st time with a friend who recommended this place for our date night. Have to admit was a bit skeptical being from Bensonhurst Brooklyn. Was blown away by the food and was pleasantly surprised by the live jazz band they had performing (Saturday night).

2804849,2015-09-16,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"We had our food to go so this review so I can't speak for the dining in experience. We came across this place on one of those nights were nobody feels like cooking and after attempting two other Italian places that were listed as open on Yelp but turned out to be closed, we found Nora's. 

Al Prosciutto Pizza - 4 Stars. Think a combination of regular run of the mill pizza with better ingredients. The crust wasn't super thick or super thin, def. not the artesianal-type but not chain-style either, rather just a nice middle ground. It had very little - basically no sauce or cheese as the first layer. The crust had been brushed nicely with olive oil and perhaps a light dusting of parmesan and large slices of sun dried tomatoes. The arugula and Prosciutto were added after baking but while the pizza was still hot, giving the greens a nice bit of wilt without being mushy, then more parmesan sprinkled on top. The only down side to this pizza was just too much garlic, and we actually like garlic, but this just had a bit too much. Deduct one star for that. I wouldn't want to have eaten it on a first date! If we ordered again we would just ask to hold the garlic. Other than that, great pizza. We had plenty of leftovers. 

Spinach, Gorgonzola and Farro Salad - 4 Stars. The farro was nice and tender and topped with a generous portion of fresh spinach. The salad was rimmed with large slices of fresh, firm tomatoes and topped with crumbled gorgonzola. The salad losses a star due to slightly too much dressing for our taste. I would ask for dressing on the side next time, but other than that, a really nice, fresh and simple salad. 

Rigatoni Special - 4 Stars. I wouldn't likely order this dish again, but that is because I don't happen to care for most of the meats in it, not that is wasn't good. The pasta was cooked to a nice texture and the sauce had a good flavor. A nice red sauce with just enough oil and spice to give it a little kick. The amount of meat in the dish was generous and the meatballs were flavorful and tender. The Italian sausage slices were what you'd expect, but if that's a flavor you like, then you'd be pleased. The sautéed green peppers were sliced very thick, making it so you could really taste their flavor as opposed to be little diced pieces you might miss in the dish. 

Pasta Fagioli Soup - 3 Stars. I didn't care for this dish so much. I felt it was lacking in a bit of taste - maybe some salt or something. It had a generous amount of beans and pasta, and the pasta wasn't mushy, so I'll just chalk this up the fact it just wasn't quite my thing, not that it is bad per-se. 

Bottom line, the place was pretty good and the prices were right. We'd definitely eat here again and check out some other menu items.",G8LFAjlCCJ8Ivij897PYlg,0,0,4,l3-ldtlVwMZXswNmk6VfZg
2807786,2017-02-17,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Nora's is a hard place to describe.  One thing I can say for sure - Nora's is very, very popular.  It recently moved from a strip mall location to a large, stand-alone building down the street, and even this larger space is packed every night.  Beyond that, I don't know if Nora's set out to be all things to all people, but it very nearly succeeds in reaching that goal.

Is Nora's a local hangout, family-friendly, with reasonable prices?  Yes, it can be.  My wife and I are locals, a couple of miles from Nora's, and we consider it to be a neighborhood joint.  You can get a lasagna or cannelloni for about 15 bucks, and leave full and satisfied.  (One thing about that family-friendly part - there are usually families with young kids in the dining room, and not all of them are, shall we say, well-behaved; so it can be kind of noisy in there.)

On the other hand, is Nora's a high-end, destination restaurant that draws tourists from the Strip?  Yep, it's that too.  And if you want Nora's to be a $$$ restaurant you can certainly start with the shrimp scampi appetizer at $17 and then have the veal chop at $40.  

My recommendation is to go with your favorite pasta dish.  Most recently, I had the Crazy Alfredo, which is sort of a paella made with fettuccine instead of rice, and was quite good.  I have also enjoyed the veal cannelloni a la vodka, and the fettuccine carbonara.  All of the pasta dishes I have tried have been rich, rich, rich, even for Italian food, so you definitely don't need multiple courses.  But if you do choose a starter, I would suggest that you stay away from the pasta faggioli - that was a dish I didn't care for.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,4,gq2bz_YvKrUmAQhinZrjjg

I give this place a 4/5 came here friday April 28, 2017
Let break it down...

Overall experience 4/5
Reason being we had a 7:15pm dinner reservation, however did not get seated until after 8pm and waited another 20 minutes for bread and wine.  Our appetizers didn't get to us until almost 9pm.  Our server was Jessica...She was amazing.  The problem wasn't her it was the lack of policy the restaurant doesn't have in regards to large party payments.  Being a waitress prior I understand that a party of 10 w/separate checks will happen, but poor thing had two parties of 10 separate checks we witness as she served different receipt books.  So needless to say we understood how busy she was, but my gosh it's a friday night, couldn't the party arrange something else, or the restaurant have a rule.  Then the funny thing was, Jessica finally got to us and the other party interrupted in the middle of taking our order and pulled her back to the table.  Jessica was very kind and apologetic, but the restaurant owners should really put a stop to large party separate checks on friday/saturday nights.

Service 5/5
Jessica was very friendly and delightful, you would have never have known her chaos unless you witness it.  She never complained and never showed it on her face.

Food 4.5/5
In between above average and amazing.  Octopus was my favorite.  I love the jasper grilled items, great flavor.

Atmosphere 4/5
It is VERY loud inside if full.  Waiting area was very small and crowded with minimal sitting inside.  The decor is new and fresh, which looks great.  If in heels the floor is slick! BEWARE.  I will be excited to come back and enjoy the patio area under better weather.

Would of went to Rao's in Caesars but had little Buster with us and wanted to be able to leave him in the car safely. Nora's is the kind of Italian restaurant that you would go to all the time if you lived in Vegas. Just looking around at the packed house you get the feeling that none of the diners are from the hotels. Had a decent veal parm plate. If I would change anything I would stop the use of the salamander.  The hot plate warning when the server delivers the plate has almost always been the first sign of a mediocre meal. This case was different as the veal was delicious and the melted cheese a velvet blanket of goodness. Can't wait to try it again next trip.,qzkA4pdGVtQOxYUOdQtuKA,0,0,5,H_drblNBK4QJLRSby38UWA
2822732,2014-02-23,1,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Aaaah what happened to you?? This was my favorite Italian restaurant of ALL time. I am sad to say that I will have to find a new spot:( 

I spoke so highly of Nora's, so when it was girl's night out, we had this place in mind. Parking can be a pain during the dinner rush because there are like 10 businesses sharing 50 spots. Make sure to give yourself some time for that. As for the restaurant itself, don't let the exterior fool you. The inside is nicer than the outside. To the right of the restaurant is the bar/lounge area and to the left is the more lit up family area. 

Service was pretty normal. Nothing special, she was nice and did her job. The average rating goes towards the food. Like I said, this WAS my favorite spot until now. Let me explain why. 

Garlic Bread: a few years ago it used to be thick slices of bread covered in butter with huge chunks of garlic right there staring at you. Bad breath for hours, but so good. Now, it's thin slices of bread with just garlic flavored butter. It's like something you could have bought in the frozen food section. 

Appetizers: Cesar salad was pretty boring. And $5 for a few pieces of lettuce was way overpriced. The truffle fries were pretty boring too. Just plain French fries sprinkled with Parmesan. Boring all around. The fries did have a good crisp though. 

Eggplant Parmesan: this is the ONLY thing I order off the menu. Pan fried eggplant covered with marinara sauce and mozzarella served with a side of spaghetti. Sounds good right? It was before. This visit I got a pile of mush. Maybe because they messed up my friend's pizza order so my dish was probably just chillin. Very disappointed. 

All in all, I probably won't come back to Nora's. It still beats Olive Garden, but maybe I'll just stick with Bootlegger's from now on.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,3,0,3,uNQsuNocAyZG83PNEK-NvA

We are both bourbon drinkers and were very impressed with the extent of the bourbon menu.  Our favorite (Booker) was available and this bartender knew how to make a cocktail.  A very generous pour and $9 is practically a steal for this bourbon.  
We started with the spinach salad with farro which was a perfectly balanced combination with gorgonzola dressed in a delicious balsamic vinaigrette.
The mussels arrabiata had a nice zip to the broth and the mussels themselves were the largest I've yet to come across in Las Vegas.  We also had to try something from the Josper Grill and went with an order of the pork belly which was rich and grilled to perfection.  
We finished with the rigatoni gorgonzola with chicken and we fought this morning over who was going to take the leftovers for lunch.
In closing I must add that one of the hightlights of our dinner was our server Sebastiano.  What an delightful fellow and very attentive.",mNd6zM4Kq2dbQdm3fpsESQ,0,0,5,faLrMTYtMXXt4Urp0EBWOw

My best friends had their birthday dinner here. The parking is pretty limited. We went around 630 and the lot was pretty packed. Also it's in a strange location. I couldn't find it at first I was expecting it to be a bigger restaurant but I don't  judge. 

We decided to grab some drinks at the bar first. Lemon drop, bomb. Rose sangria, bomb. Moscow mule, bomb. That witchcraft drink, don't get! made me grow some chest hairs!

Finally seated, our waiter was amazing and very good looking I might add. We started with calamari. Very good, the sauce it came with was to die for. I ordered the Veal Cannelloni. Oh my gosh it was one of the best things I ever tasted. I honestly didn't know what veal was when I ordered it but it was amazing! My friend got the Frutti De Mare which was amazing also. It had a very seafood taste to it very different from my Veal dish but I loved both. 

They brought our tiramisu and a Canolli for my best friends birthday on the house. And that Canolli was heaven! It had pistachio crumbs and that just made it perfect. The tiramisu however, I've had better but doesn't mean it was good.

We arrived and were asked to wait while they got the table ready, not a big deal. We were seated and then proceeded to sit at the table for 10-15 before any one even acknowledged us. We eventually had our server come over who apologized for running late. She was going to take just our drink order but we had enough time to order our appetizer and dinner in addition to our drinks. We didn't want to risk not seeing her again. I got the Sicilian Mule (Moscow Mule) and my boyfriend got an Old Fashioned. My Mule was outstanding, could have used more Vodka but that's just me. My boyfriend thought the Old Fashioned was too sweet due to them adding an orange slice in addition to muddled brandies cherries. We got the garlic bread and the mozzarella sticks. Both were absolutely delicious. I got the seafood pasta which was great and my boyfriend ordered the primavera. We found ourselves unable to fully enjoy our meal for to it being unbelievable hot.

I usually review a place mostly for its food quality, but Nora lost a star due to its extraordinarily bad service. 

Let's start with the food first:
1) Pomodoro Bruchetta (3 stars) - but unless you're hankering for it, I say skip it... for tomatoes on toast, it's not worthy $7.
2) Truffle fries (4 stars) - very truffly, crunchy and delicious, but over the top salty.
3) Garlic bread (3 stars) - not bad, not great... it was made better by olive oil
4) Alla Nora (3 stars) - the eggplant was really dry, crunchy, bordering on hard to chew. The meat sauce had good flavors, but the spaghetti is also crunchy and dried out on the edges.  
5) Primavera (4 stars) - it's like a garden exploded on a plate. It's good, but after half of the plate the oils felt over powering.
6) Pappardelle with Wild Boar - not sure, since I didn't get to taste this dish, nor did we have a discussion about it... Dennis finished it, so it can't be bad. 

The pages of the menu were a bit sticky, that should have been our first warning, but one never really think of such things when your tired butt hits the seat. The bar service was actually reasonably good, other than the placemats being wet. We wanted to sit at a table, so as soon as one became available, we switched over. The first napkin was a bit dingy in one corner, but once reseated, there was a second set of napkin/silverwear combo, so I didn't say anything. My bread plate was coated with a thin layer of grease and a chunk of dried food on one side - had to ask for another one. Within 5 minutes of sitting down, we realize we were against the stage where the band (arriving in at this moment) will be playing. After being brushed behind the head with the cello, I got up to the hostess and asked to be reseated. She looked me straight in the eye and said ""no - the table that's available is already taken."" BY WHO? No one was there. 

No apology. 

I return to the table and me and my table mates sat stunned for about 5 minutes. At which point a man walks over and pulls a chair from our table and set up a tip jar right at our table. Liana about flipped out, and got up once again to request a table switch... this time asking a different hostess, and probably raising her tone slightly. 

We were reseated in the kitchen area with annoyance from the staff. 

Again, no apology. 

We had no water refills for 15 to 20 minutes and while the bus girl was responsive when we were able to flag her down, we were already rather displeased. The food was abysmally slow. 

Seriously, I am so irritated typing this review that I want to give them just one star, but I'm being judicious. 

I would not come back and I would recommend you don't go at all.",aqXY7pN0nIHfyrusGA71pw,3,1,2,Y6Zfc_5Gii-CrUX2wlohzQ

Employees? Fun, playful, attentive, offer their recommendations on menu items.
Atmosphere? Clean, dimly lit for great ambiance, colorful, busy (it was packeddd on a Thursday night, yet the room didn't feel crowded or chaotic.)
Food? Not just the best Italian food I've ever eaten, but some of the best FOOD I've ever eaten in general! Wine selection was great. Appetizers were hardy. All menu items were not outrageously priced (as you would expect them to be for a meal of this quantity AND quality.)

It seemed I never even seen the waiter the whole time we were eating and to tell you the truth if the waiter is not going to be on top of their game and they have the bus boy doing majority of the work they might as well stay at home. I believe our waiter will be fired in the near future if he keeps his ways up. Even after the bus person served us our desserts and toke great care of our family. I was surprised and irritated that the waiter took his time even taking care of our bill. Needless to say his tip fell shy of 10%. Times are tough in the economy. He should be so lucky to still have a job. Waiters in Vegas be aware people that work, meaning, the ones that still have jobs. They work hard for their money and when they go out they want excellent service. His butt was saved because of the great food and the Bus boy. Next time he may not be so lucky.

Soo let's start with the atmosphere. Seems pretty casual, some people were dressed nice but I'd say it's the same type of atmosphere as Cheesecake Factory. It's pretty packed and some people might consider it loud. Definitely make a reservation if you're going more than a two person party. My boyfriend and I were seated after a 5 minute wait on a Sunday @8pm and within that time we saw three larger parties come in with reservations. I've come to learn, busy=yummy :)
The first thing they brought out was a basket of garlic bread. This is how all other garlic breads should aspire to be. Real garlic and lotttts of it!! Off to a good start!
We ordered the Arancini as our appetizer. They were really flavorful breaded risotto balls with marinara sauce. Really good and I liked that the breading wasn't too thick. I was hoping it was a little more cheesy but it didn't need it. $8.95
For entree, I had the Rigatoni Gorgonzola with chicken. Again, super flavorful but not a bundle of flavors that you can't distinguish. You could really taste the Gorgonzola and the addition of mushrooms and sun dries tomatos made it heavenly. Large portion and extremely inexpensive at $14.95.
My boyfriend had the small (ahem* small is used very loosely here lol) Snow White pizza and added pepperoni to it. This thing was massive and a steal at $12.95. Wow. Sizing- Small:12"", Medium:16"", Large: 18"". I stole a piece of course and I loved the crust!!  Soo good and not paper thin or focaccia bread thick. Very prominent garlic flavor and you could really taste all 4 cheeses they used, especially the ricotta.
Lastly, we had the Warm Chocolate Cake. My Oh My. Soo good. Make sure you order this with your entrees as it's a pre-order only. It had this creamy vanilla sauce and pistachios. I thought the pistachios would be a little over powering but they used it soo lightly that it was more like little hidden notes behind their masterpiece of a lava cake. It's actually very similar in texture and taste as Fleming's chocolate cake without the saltyness. $6.50
Our total bill for all four items before tip was $46. I'm not lying, I know, greaaat deal for the quality of food you get!
Our server was on point, very professional without being stuffy, as well as being fast and friendly. Our drinks were also never left even half empty. Great job! 
I really couldn't find anything wrong with place. I will definitely be back to try more items from their massive menu!!  :)",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,6,5,5,6BKWpmRwDeowcCXeXJVgBw

So, here goes.....I made a reservation for two at 5:45 on a Tuesday night.  We were welcomed by the hostesses and sat immediately. Our server asked for a drink order and I had read that the sangria was good but not enough fruit in it. The server asked if I would like to sample it before ordering a glass.  I thought that was top notch customer service.  It was a red sangria so I opted out and ordered a glass of Reisling. I normally don't order wine, but I thought I would treat myself.  The other member of my party (my 17 yr. old grandchild ordered a diet Coke).  Before I continue I would like to state that the server and waiter's assistants were incredible and my grandchild's drink was refilled at least 5 or 6 times.  We were brought complimentary garlic bread and it was delicious.  After we inhaled the first basket, our server asked if we'd like another and we couldn't resist.  We ordered the crazy alfredo that I had read so much about, and the server told me it was the most popular dish on the menu. That item was $22.95 which I consider pricey for pasta regardless if what is in it.  In addition I had always wanted to try bransino (a whole small sea bass) and decided to treat myself as it was pricey for my wallet at $28.95.  We also ordered a small white pizza that had beautiful mounds of ricotta for $13.95. Cutting to the chase.......The bransini was very dry and no flavor even though there was a spring of rosemary and a lemon wedge or two inside. The dish was served with a mound of dressed arugula salad which was the 2nd highlight of our experience.  The crazy alfredo was dry, the sauce was rather brown in color than your every day alfredo that is white.  The pizza was the highlight of the meal and the least expensive item. Our entire bill was $84.22.  We didn't finish the meal and brought home the pizza and pasta. I left a hefty tip for the pristine service.

All the customers were smiling and having a fine time. It was hard to choose from the extensive menu because everything sounded so good, and the plates of the other diners all looked wonderful. The more expensive dishes are gargantuan while the less expensive ones are merely huge.

I decided on pasta alla Nora since it is something I couldn't get elsewhere. It is spaghetti covered with meat sauce, cheeses, and pesto (which I didn't notice if it was present), then topped with bite-sized slices of eggplant and baked or more likely broiled. If you like eggplant, it's heavenly. It looked like a manageable portion to begin with; I actually breathed a sigh of relief that I wouldn't be overwhelmed. However, I ended up bringing half of it home with me; it was much bigger than it looked. My friend ordered the fettucine carbonara, and we both agreed it was the best we'd ever tasted. We both loved the garlic bread.

Before we ordered a bottle of wine, we asked whether it could be capped and taken home if we didn't drink it all. Our waiter had to go and check; yes, we could. The bottle we ordered was sold out, so he substituted another wine and reduced the price for us. Great service and a really sweet waiter.

I had actually been to Nora's twice in the past and remembered really enjoying it the first time but felt ambivalent in the second. However, I arrived at the new location and was really impressed by the new exterior and interior decor as well as just the overall increase in space of the restaurant. 

Unfortunately, my experience as a whole did not mirror my expectations one bit. For starters, my grandma had informed me that she had made a reservation for 11 am on one of the days we were in town. Because we decided that we would rather have Italian food for dinner, I called and was told that there was no reservation for 11 ( and in fact, they do not take reservations for lunch! ). I'm not sure where the miscommunication took place, but not to worry since we were planning to go in later that night anyway.

We arrived right before our reservation time of 4 PM and were asked to wait while our table was getting set up. Not sure why it wasn't set up already, but no worries. Waiting for a minute or two is fine, of course. However, one minute turned into two turned into five turned into what seemed like at least ten minutes. No one seemed like they were in a rush to get us seated, which was a bit annoying. If that was the case, what was the point of making a reservation?

Finally, we were seated and all was fine. Nothing exciting took place between getting seated and getting our food ( except that the food seemed to come at a rather slow pace which was strange considering that the restaurant was mostly empty at this hour ). We ordered a Calamari Fritti, Truffle Fries, Shrimp Scampi, Frutti di Mare, Crazy Alfredo, and the Rib-Eye.

1) Calamari Fritti: This was actually really good. Perfectly crisped and flavored. Good sauce to go with the fried calamari. Would definitely recommend this. HOWEVER, when we were given the bill, they charged us $2 extra for this. The waitress told us that this was the price and when we showed her the menu, the prices did not match. It is fine if it is supposed to be $2 more; however, please update your menu to reflect the same. The staff did not seem to be pleased in helping us fix the error and, in fact, made us seem like we were a nuisance for asking for it to be changed. When there are pricing errors, it is not so much that the customer cares about the difference in price, but simply the principle that everyone is accurately charged for the food they are getting.

2) Truffle Fries: Overly salty and not very much truffle flavor. It's overall okay, but not the best that I've had. Wouldn't really recommend. The only reason I got it was because I had been craving it a few days back and was happy to see it for a decent price at a restaurant. Wish it would have satisfied that craving better.

3) Shrimp Scampi: I didn't have much of this but my grandma and uncle both ordered this and liked it. Too buttery for my taste and not salty enough ( which was surprising considering how salty the fries were ).

4) Frutti di Mare: Also not the best that I've had. Again the sauce was a little bland, and considering that this dish is usually very flavorful in other places, it was severely lacking that night. Not sure what could have been done to make it better. Definitely some more salt would have been a start.

5) Crazy Alfredo: This dish sounded amazing on paper ( and some of the reviews seemed to agree with that ), but I did not like it at all. The flavors didn't seem to marry well together, and it was too heavy ( which I suppose I should have expected with an alfredo dish ). 

6) Rib-Eye: This was definitely the highlight of the entire meal. The meat was very well cooked and flavorful. If I had to go back, this would be what I would get. It's a bit confusing because the menu has an option with fries and another with roasted potatoes. The fries option is $1 more than the roasted potatoes, and that was not the one that we wanted, especially since we had just ordered a side of fries as it was! Nonetheless, out came a bowl of fries. Now, this is just what I've experienced at other restaurants, but usually, if a party orders fries, the waitress asks if we still want it since one of the entrees comes with a side of fries that's the same size as the one we paid for. This was never brought up, though they were at least accommodating enough to bring out a side of roasted potatoes instead ( which took another fifteen minutes at least ).

Overall, didn't really enjoy my experience here. To get the bill took what felt like eternity and our waitress just disappeared on us for most of the meal that we had to flag down other waiters who were confused as to where she was. In additioit seems the online menu and the in-restaurant prices do not match. I am not certain if it is supposed to, but it doesn't seem to be a reliable source. I don't believe I will be going back again sadly.",3URiiM_5vqsaNlywokYauw,3,0,2,W4FPfFS0gqKnkT1yxFlCtw

The food tonight was good. Not excellent, but it had some high points (gnocci w/ vodka sauce, veal scallopinni). However, other items lacked flavor, or in the case of the chicken parm, fell apart all together. 

The hostess and bar staff were great. They handled the dinner crowd very well. We had a drink while waiting for our table. Once it was ready we were promptly transferred to the dining room. This is where things went down hill fast. Our server was waiting on my wife and I, a party of 16, and 3-4 other tables. We noticed she had a busser (Justin) and 2 other food runners helping her with the party. All this assistance should have freed her up to provide atleast a bit of competent service to our table and those around us. In the hour and twenty minutes we were in the dining room we interacted with our waitress 4 times. 
1. Placed order for 1st cocktails, appetizers, entrees.
2. Delivered 1st cocktails, ordered waters
3. Ordered 2nd cocktail because we hadn't recieved food.
4. Recieved check. 

Notice it wasn't our server who delivered our second drink or our FOOD!!! She didn't approach our table until we requested our check through the busser. When she did approach the table she asked how everything was tasting. There were no plates on the table because we has finished our dinner 10 minutes before. 
My wife and I have no idea what she was doing the whole time we were there. Her large party seemed to be cared for mainly by support staff such as the food runners and the busser. 
Unfortunately I cannot rate the individual parts of this establishment separately, so they receive 2 stars based on the dismal performance of our server and lackluster food. 
However Justin the busboy is a 5 star employee. He never stopped moving. He turned tables with absolute efficiency and was incredibly professional in dealing with the customers. We observed him distributing  plates and flatware to the large party. Everyone was handed items individually, with an excuse me and thank you when he had to reach the opposite side of the table. We laughed when we observed another employee simply walk up and place a handful of forks and a stack of plates at the end of the table, and walk away just expecting the head of the table to pass them out. Fantastic job tonight Justin, we appreciated your effort.",aE7UsbwHJuhxbwERqu0H0g,1,0,2,aQTQeiTpSANG5KronGty7A

3115620,2013-03-29,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"My boyfriend found this place on Yelp - we were looking for places a little further from the strip and less touristy. (Even though we ourselves were tourists, go figure!)   Made reservations and got there early so we could check out the bar for a pre-dinner martini.  

The stoli lemon drop martini I got was in the top 5 lemon drops I have ever had (and this is coming from someone who has spent thirty minutes making a 'perfect' lemon drop martini for myself on more than one occasion).   The lemon slice they had in there was actually candied/seared  and I think that (along with the freshly hand-squeezed lemon juice) is what made it so delicious.   So they'd already won me over before we even got to our table.    The bartenders were courteous and prompt and humored us by taking our photo (twice because I looked fat in the first one haha).

For starters we ordered the calamari appetizer and caesar salad.  They also brought us a complimentary basket of garlic bread - which was delicious!  Lots of butter so it's gooey in the middle and crispy on the edges, just how i love it.   The salad was good solid standard caesar - nothing over the top or unique but very enjoyable.  It also came with more of the yummy garlic bread cut into crouton sized pieces on top - bonus!  The calamari was good - nice and crisp, not too greasy, and was a generous portion.  The dipping sauce they served with it (a caper infused marinara according to our server) is what makes this dish stand out.  It was NOM.  

The wine selection was also pretty nice and the server did a great job of recommending pairings. We ended up with the La Giaretta Cab Franc which paired very well as it was able to hold up to the bold italian flavors we were eating.

Entrees:  I got the crazy alfredo, and it was as delicious as the portion was huge.  If you're a shrimp lover you may want to ask for extra shrimp because my serving only came with two.  That didn't bother me though because I feel like the sausage and sun dried tomatoes were the true stars of that dish and I actually felt like the shrimp didn't need to be there. (Borderline sacrilege but true!)   The sauce seems like  an alfredo with some marsala sauce mixed in... lending it a beautiful golden color and sending the flavor through the roof.     I highly recommend this dish. 

The boyfriend wasn't as pleased with his, unfortunately.  The server told us the special was veal chop parmesan but we only heard 'veal chop' and envisioned something a little more pure and refined... so when we got a breaded cut of veal covered in red sauce and cheese we were a little disappointed.  Miscommunication aside, it was ""good"" and enjoyable but not great or anything to write home about.  I don't know about anyone else, but for me veal is such a rare, guilty pleasure that when I do eat it, I expect it to be damn good and also expect the chefs preparing it to treat it with due respect.  Unfortunately I don't feel this did justice to it.    Boyfriend says he was also shocked to see that the veal chop was $34 when we got the bill.  Completely out of line with the prices of the standard entrees printed in the menu which range from $9 to $22. 

Service during the dinner had its highs and lows.  Our server for the most part was friendly, nice, easy to talk to, and gave great wine and desert wine pairing recommendations.   There was a rather long delay between our salad course and entree course.  The server explained there was some confusion in the kitchen.... yada yada he apologized and told us he'd be happy to give us a free dessert.   We were fine with that, not a huge deal as we had eaten something already and were enjoying the wine and the music.   But then there was the awkward moment (as I'm browsing the dessert menu looking at wines) when he snatched the menu out of my hand and set a piece of cheesecake in front of me telling me he'll save me the trouble, this is the best dessert they have.  This made me feel a little awkward as though he thought I was trying to take advantage of the situation and order something super expensive or something, which I wasn't.   Well, neither of us usually eat dessert so we accepted the cheesecake with thanks but without much enthusiasm and proceeded to get the menu back so we could order some dessert wine.  The wine he recommended me (to pair with the cheesecake) did in fact pair so well with the cheesecake that I ended up eating almost the entire piece, of which I had initially planned to take a few polite bites and leave it at that.    

So all in all, despite the few hiccups, it was a very pleasant experience.  We had a great time and came away satisfied.  Our entrees were huge enough for us to share AND take home an abundance of left overs.   We'll be back next time we're in Vegas for sure and will definitely recommend to our friends.",UfbpDl7oBzwmO7L8jVZowg,1,1,4,FoNoUQXXuV4LOjJ2PPbpNg

3119516,2011-03-31,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"We ate dinner here after attending Penn & Teller on a Saturday night. The restaurant is about two miles from the Penn & Teller theater, in a strip mall. When we arrived, there was a live band playing, there was a dark ambience, and the restaurant was about half-full. 

The tables were covered with what appeared to be butcher paper, which I thought was a little odd. When I got my menu, I was surprised by the number of choices. I opted for the special, called the Mt. Etna Pasta, which consisted of pan fried angel hair, chicken breasts, potatoes, peppers, and a balsamic reduction, among other things. 

When my dish arrived, it looked like a volcano of some type. I didn't know where to begin. It looked odd to be certain, but I reserved judgment until I had a chance to taste it. I must say that it is one of the tastiest Italian dishes I've had in the last 10 years. I devoured the dish despite its large size, and left a happy camper.

The prices were reasonable. The band was just okay. The butcher paper table was a little bit tacky. The service was good. Overall, I recommend this place to anyone that is not desperately trying to impress a first date. Get to know the person a bit, THEN take him/her here and tell them to get the Mt.

For starters I was invited here on a date and reservations were for 7:15 PM. We weren't seated until about 7:45PM. I was on the verge of just saying you know what this isn't cool and walking out. Of course as soon as this almost happened we were called to our table. What is the point of a reservation if you can't be seated on time or at least within a reasonable grace period after that? The two hostesses working seemed overwhelmed and clueless. Oh but I wasn't alone in the not being seated for a reservation fiasco! There had to be about 3 other parties that were also waiting to be seated and inquiring frequently since we all couldn't pile up in the doorway.. Who would've known that this place would be jumping like this on a Thursday night? Anyways...

We were seated and immediately greeted. The server was cool nothing much to say about him he did his job. Usually when you ask somebody if it's there first time and they respond yes you start off with some possible suggestions..  Whatev...I guess that's not apart of the job description though. Moving on to the food. 

Appetizers:

House Salad (Romaine Lettuce, Mozzarella, Olives, Onions, Tomatoes, Pepperoncini,
Homemade Italian Dressing)

Mozzarella Caprese Salad (Tomatoes, Basil, Rosemary-Garlic EVOO)

Entree's:

Crazy Alfredo (Fettucini, Chicken, Sausage, Shrimp, Porcini Mushrooms, Mushrooms, Roasted Bell Peppers, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Jalapeños)

Chicken Carciofi (Tomato, Artichokes, Capers, Linguini, White Wine Sauce)

Conclusion: The food overall was pretty good no complaints on that. If you love pasta then definitely you can't go wrong with the ""Crazy Alfredo""! My Mozzarella Caprese was good as well. My last complaint which cost them another star was the fact that when we asked for to go boxes the waiter brought them back and gave us the wrong damn to-go boxes. Nothing like getting home from dinner with somebody and finding out that you got the other persons food. And in my case this was a date..so imagine how awkward that was for me?.. Eh I may try again who knows....",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,10,8,3,WuOE5avT6XNfcAxeYb3zIQ
3142101,2014-07-31,2,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"The food I tasted here was low quality and did not taste freshly made. 

After sitting down, the garlic bread was brought out right away. I spit out the first bite because the bread tasted days old and was soggy. I asked the bus boy how the bread was made and he said Nora puts the spread on in the morning and then they bake it. If any type of spread is sitting on bread for hours it will still have that soggy consistency no matter what you do to it. He said he would bring us another batch and it would be crispier. It was crispier, however, it still tasted old and even though there was plenty of seasoning it had minimal flavor. I ordered the alla Nora and my friend ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. My pasta was baked in an oven and came out piping hot. They need to cool this pasta before they bring it out to customers because it's impossible to eat for at least 10 minutes. The first bite I had was awful. The eggplant was soggy and the tomato sauce tasted like it had come from a can. The tomato sauce reminded me of the one time in my childhood when I tried a friends spaghettios. My friends pasta was better than mine and for an Alfredo the sauce was lighter than I had expected. The chicken was okay but it would have been better if it was grilled and the pasta was mostly clumped together. I called over the manager to tell him I could not eat my pasta and about the other issues I was having. He apologized and expressed his embarrassment for the situation at hand. He ended up comping our meal and sending us home with a free dessert which was a nice touch.

18"" SHRIMP WHITE PIZZA $19.95 - white sauce pizza w/ diced pieces of shrimp, garlic, tomato, & mozzarella...  this pizza was PACKED w/flavors!! It was packed w/ little bits of garlic which was in every single bite.

GARLIC BREAD $2.50 - crispy outside but soft buttery garlicy on the other side. They give you a complimentary basket when you dine in & then additional order is $2.50 or when you do takeout.

3239764,2017-12-10,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"We were swinging by Las Vegas for a quick weekend getaway, so I reached out to Philip T. for some Italian recommendations in town. Nora's was one of the off-strip suggestions. 

I tried to reserve a table in the Yelp app, but they didn't have that service available. Tried OpenTable, which had the restaurant on the app, but it didn't take any reservations. WHAAT! So third time's the charm, right? Called the restaurant and they said that they are fully booked and wait time could be up to an hour and a half. But we had to be there to put our name down. We were determined to try this restaurant, so we drove out there and was met with a packed parking lot, and a bunch of people gathered outside the entrance. We put down our name and were told to wait nearby. Luckily, we noticed a couple leaving the bar area, so we snuck in and found two perfect spots smack dab in the bar. WIN!

I started with a Pilgrim's Passion to calm the nerves and ease the appetite... Gin, St. Germain, passionfruit puree, topped with a sprig of fresh mint. So smooth, so fresh. 

We ordered a plate of Mozzarella Caprese as the appetizer, which came with complimentary garlic bread. The fresh mozzarella with the EVOO drizzled on top was a perfect start to an Italian dinner. Paired with a glass of red and my cocktail, it opened up the appetite for a pasta dish.

We ordered the Melrose with shrimp... Linguini, creamy basil pesto sauce, zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes topped with roasted pine nuts. 
and...
Eggplant Parmigiana with mozzarella, tomato sauce and side of spaghetti with tomato sauce. The dishes were huge, and we quickly realized that one entree would easily please two people.. but hey, we're in Vegas so we smashed down as much as we could.. but boy, was the Melrose heavy. The creamy sauce made it rich, and really heavy. It was so tasty, but I threw in the towel after 5 minutes. The Eggplant Parm was really tasty, with soft breading and basil tomato sauce, it was definitely our favorite.

The service was very inviting and prompt, and everyone seemed to enjoy the food and ambiance. It's definitely a place we would return to on our next visit in Vegas. And thanks to Philip T. for his awesome recommendations!",sTQZr_UkryqAmLSIQQzuhQ,1,1,4,dqMtrsIjlsNaKS3hHjkmNg

The dining room is a beautiful mix of brick and stone with a nice balance of wall art. Comfortable seating at large tables is available throughout. The background music combined instrumentals and vocals was at the perfect volume with the dining room people chatter.

We were seated immediately as our arrival was ten minutes prior to the reservation time. Service was spot on efficient from ordering cocktails , maintaining the water glasses and removing the finished items. On this evening the dining room was at full capacity and our server Kenia followed up on our satisfaction as she made the rounds.

The bread basket contained wonderful garlic bread so soft and warm. Hard to resist. My entree was a whole Branzino that was perfectly grilled. Crispy skin and moist inside. One of the best I have tasted. The fish was stuffed with sliced lemon and a sprig of rosemary. A few pieces of lemon  for squeezing made the fish outstanding. The dish included  tender and tasty  arugula which was the perfect complement. 
My wife ordered the chicken piccata which comes with a side of pasta. The chicken was tender and the lemon wine sauce provided the perfect balance. Also the capers did not over power the dish. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the tomato sauce was simply delicious. Both items were large enough to share or in this case to take home. 

It is extremely difficult to pass up Tiramisu in a great Italian restaurant. In this case we agreed to share. The size was perfect for two people. The dessert did not disappoint. A nice combination of flavors and light on the alcohol.

Out of the Restaurant: 9:37 pm
Party Size:  3

This place is definitely a local spot. The food is decent but the service is so, so slow. My family and I ordered salads to start and then we got a  pizza and 2 pastas.

Salad:  I had the Caesar and my mom had the house. Way too much dressing and cheeses on both. 

Pizza and Pasta:  The pizza was ok and the pasta again was nice, cooked on point but again way too saucy. Almost overwhelming. 

Service:  We were a table of 3. We did not order anything complicated.  We did not leave until 9:37 pm. It took almost 50 minutes from the time that we finished our salad to get our entree. Absurd!  The waitress did come by and say it would be just a few more minutes however that's just nonsense. There was a large table of 12 that they needed to serve before us apparently and that is why the wait was so long. We were about 5 minutes from walking out.

3294133,2009-11-17,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Nora's is one of your not-so-secret neighborhood gems residing in a nondescript strip mall on the corner of Jones and Flamingo. it seems as if much as been written about this place and opinions vary. Mainly, it seems like an issue of expectations. So here is what to expect and you can decide for yourself if this is going to make your dining rotation. 

Nora's is really the combination of two suites in a strip mall. The room to your right will have a band at 9pm on a weekend night offering smooth jazz or whatever is Italian restaurant appropriate. The music is not too loud and you can either enjoy the music in the background or sit nearer to the band if that is what you are there for. There is also a semiprivate room for about 10 if you are having a little party. The other dining room is just a dining room. I didn't eat there, so I can't really say what the experience is like. 

Service. I will get this out of the way since this is where they lost a couple of points. The service was by no means terrible, as we were seated on time, food timely and drinks filled. It was just more of an intangible indifference I felt, as if I was not supposed to know about this place. Maybe everyone was in a bad mood because the night was cold and they were missing out on the Pacquiao vs Cotto fight. Or maybe you need to be a regular for a little warmer service. 

Anyway, I just desire warm, friendly service with Italian food. It just seems appropriate with pasta. Just like I expect bad service from the best Chinese restaurant. Not a big deal, but this prevents this place from being remarkable. 

The interior design is nice and they do good job of providing a good atmosphere. You will forget that you are in a strip mall. 

Food. Obviously, that is what we are here for. Firstly, by no fault of the restaurant, I ordered the wrong dish. Rare mistake. However, having said that, I believe that carbonara should be a wee less salty. Granted, this is from the perspective of a guy trying to limit his salt for health concerns. However, it is rare that something is so salty that I cannot finish it. The first few bites were delish, but got increasingly harsh as time wore on. Personally, I think that the prosciutto itself would lend enough sodium to flavor the dish nicely, but they went overboard by salting up the sauce. 

Shrimp scampi appetizer = good. Nice large shrimp, good sauce that goes well with the garlic bread. Speaking of which, the garlic bread was okay, with a home made kind of feel, if you like that sort of thing. 

Dessert. Somewhat limited choices, but the tiramisu was satisfactory with a nice wet cake to it. Ladies should have no problems here. 

Wine. An excellent selection of by the glass in case you are drinking solo or otherwise cannot take on a full bottle. Mostly Italians and California wines. You can go budget for $6. I got a couple of glasses of Regaleali for 8.25 each. 

What you must compare all this with is the fact that most of your pasta dishes range from $10-20, dessert is $5 and tea is $2.50. The scampi is mildly pricey at $13.95, but it was still worth it. 

I think it is unreasonable to expect some sort of mind blowing experience. Really, Nora's is a nice local restaurant for a casual meal with a lady friend or perhaps a decent group gathering. Good for conversation, a generous serving a pasta and perhaps a nice bottle of Italian red for a reasonable price. You can stroll in here with a sportscoat or dress more casually if you like (maybe leave the jorts behind, though). So don't expect the world and just have a good time.",xgcxhbbnokR-ZBazUrtXnA,3,1,3,cd7ACueFuDBa6k5UMngsyQ

We were quoted a 2.5-3 hour wait or we could sit outside on the heated patio.  Granted it was windy and cold outside but I really wanted to try their Chicken Marsala.  We decided to sit on the patio, all by ourselves.  It was cold even with the heater and we did sit out there for maybe 10 minutes before we were acknowledged.  But once we were acknowledged, service was good.

I started with the Pasta Fagioli Soup.  It was good but not super memorable.  The Chicken Marsala was really good.  Chicken was tender and the sauce was flavorful and had enough mushrooms.  My husband ordered his usual Chicken Parmesan.  He liked the flavor but said his chicken was a little tough.  Their garlic bread is amazing.

Like I said, our service was good and it was quiet outside until a large party with kids came outside to wait for their table.  The kids were screaming but the most annoying part was the loud, pompous man with them demanding his table inside.  He marched around like he owned the place.

Get your electrician to put a dimmer on the overhead lighting in the room w/the bar. It's too bright for the amazing atmosphere you have created.

Nora's is located off the strip in a shopping plaza, where you would never expect to find this little hidden gem.  I made a reservation but my party members were late.  The hostess had no problems with this and I was seated promptly when my party arrived a few minutes later.  You walk into Nora's and you see a part of the kitchen immediately.  To the left and right are dining areas that are reminders of what you would expect at an Italian dining establishment: lower lights, intimate areas, cozy, etc.  

We were seated and given bread.  We then ordered some wine and beer which was reasonably priced considering it is Las Vegas.  I had the house specialty seafood pasta with a caesar salad; all perfect and as tasty as expected.  The other members of my party had Chicken Parmigiana and an Eggplant Parmigiana.  Both were also great when I tried them.

When we sat down they gave us baskets of garlic bread to hold us over until we got our actual food. I ordered the gnocchi in vodka sauce and it was delicious. The price of food was fairly cheap  $12-$25 a plate depending if you got meat or not.

My most recent dining experience tonight left me both angry and disappointed. 

1. No one likes a cutter. Our reservation was at 7:45pm and we checked in 30min earlier,  but apparently that was not enough for the hostesses who chose to seat a couple that not only checked in AFTER us, but WITHOUT RESERVATION. Not cool. 

2. Third times a charm to cook a steak? NO. Medium rare does NOT EQUAL well done, but the server quickly offered to re-cook a new steak. Again, medium rare does NOT EQUAL rare- the second steak was not only unappetizing to look at, but also extremely red on the inside. At this point, the MANAGER came to CONVINCE us that it was the right cut and the right level of doneness. Third steak...AGAIN- it comes back medium well, but everyone has finished eating and it has been over an hour since we sat. For better or worse, we seemed committed to this third steak. 
Not cool, I know what medium rare looks like and shouldn't have to be convinced/almost bullied into accepting it. 

3. Check up on us. If you and other members of your party have ACTIVELY VOCALIZED CONCERNS/COMPLAINTS about the restaurant YOU ARE MANAGING, I would recommend checking on them to assure no other problems or even to offer solutions to fix problems. No manager in sight after initial conversation. Not cool.

Our party was however the youngest and least dressed up because it was a last minute decision as our first choice place was closed for the day. We really didn't know what to expect as it was our first time. If they didn't have a dress code, they should, because everyone else was dressed really nice and seemed like they were there for some kind of special occasion! 

We came here around 6:30pm and beat the dinner rush! Didn't take us long to be seated. I really didn't know what to expect, because outside it didn't look like much, but on the inside, it was like WOW. It was really nice, there are three parts to the restaurant, the middle is where you enter, you can see some people working on the pizza boxes and such and a hostess, the right is the bar area with a lot of seating and the restrooms are located there. The left was the main dinning area where we were seated. 

The restaurant is family owned which opened in 1991 (the menu had a bit of history on it when you first open it). With the yelp check-in you get a complimentary glass of wine, with any order. Which it came in a decanter (see picture) and they pour some of it into your glass after they place it on the table. 

It took us quite a while to order, well myself really, the guys already knew what they wanted. When we finally ordered, it took a while for the food to come out, but when it came out it was HOT, fresh hot out of the oven / stove. Out of our group we had the Rigatoni special, Crazy Alfredo, and al la Nora. Oh we also got a small basket of garlic bread, which the first one is free, and if you wanted more it was about $2.50 (I'll confirm again next time I go). 

The Rigatoni special contained sausage, meatballs, onions, pepper, in a tomato sauce, it was very good. Everything was cooked very well and contained a lot of flavor in the meats. I really enjoyed it and it filled me up fast. Though I felt there was more meat than there was pasta, for some this is a good thing, but for myself it isn't. I would still recommend it! 

The crazy alfredo contained both meat and seafood, which looked good, but I didn't get to try it. And the al la Nora was a baked dish containing spaghetti, eggplant, beef, tomato sauce, and some others ingredients (I don't remember all of them) which my other friend enjoyed.

As for the environment, the interior is quite cozy and good for a time out with friends or maybe even a casual date.  The noise isn't too loud nor is it awkwardly quiet, which makes it easy to catch up and maintain a conversation.

The service was good; however, at peak times it seems like they are understaffed.  The wait can sometimes be long if you don't call in advance for reservations.  Nonetheless, it is worth the wait.

3532924,2014-09-21,4,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Barely contained chaos would describe the atmosphere at this very loud restaurant which we recently visited on a Saturday night.  Understaffed, crowded and noisy would be another description. The saving grace would be the food which is pretty good.....for Las Vegas....but would be mediocre at best when compared to what you you might find in NY or San Francisco.

We started our meal with complimentary garlic bread -- way too much garlic -- and kind of soggy.  We then tried the Caprese Salad which had very good mozzarella but very pedestrian grocery store tomatoes. We also tried the lemon clams which were in a tasty lemon butter sauce, but about a quarter of the clam shells were broken and to be safe, I did not eat the contents of these particular clams. The kitchen should remove such broken shell clams before serving. 

For entrees we tried the Chicken Carciofi, a pretty good dish full of chicken, artichokes and capers on linguine. We also had the Puttanesca which was tasty although full of green olives instead of black olives which I have found to be milder and better suited for this dish. The portions were enormous, a negative in my book. 

Service was spotty as it seemed our waiter was a bit overwhelmed covering two tables plus a birthday party table with 14 guests.  The appetizers came out very quickly though, but we were put off when the entrees arrived when we were only halfway through our appetizers and when we were finished with our appetizers, the appetizer plates were not removed from the table. 

The wine list is pretty good. 

Zagats rates this as the third best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas which may be correct but only serves to prove that Las Vegas is indeed in a barren Italian culinary landscape.",9VUBm41ZyGrLo4seD7Iqgg,2,0,3,WkCmb8vmfvn-8kFfa9QRCA

We also tried to change our reservation as soon as they opened that day to add one more person and we were told we could not. So in order to have everyone fed, we had a table of 8 in one room, a table of four in the second room, and one person at the bar. At the table of 4, it took 20 minutes just to receive our salad but dinner went pretty easily after that. We took out time and enjoyed all the delicious flavors. When we were done and getting ready to pay the check for the entire party we found out that the table in the other room hadn't even received their entrees yet. At this point we had all been seated over an hour so I'm not sure what the hold up was.

The alfredo was delicious, but I didnt care for the chicken so much in it.  I did order a side of meatballs, (this was just ok, I wouldnt order it again)

We also ordered some drinks that the servers had made up, its in the cocktail menu on the first page.  He ordered the toasted coconut which was AMAZING and I ordered the pilgrims passion, it was super good as well.

Nora's looks like an Italian restaurant out of the movies... looks a lil Godfather-ish on the 'right hand' side complete with a bar and live music...

We were seated on the 'left hand' side - still very good - Appears that this side is suitable for large groups...

Onto the food... Wow!

We were on family night... this is how it went down:

First we noshed on the (free - 1st round is free) Garlic Bread... I loved that they sliced the bread very thinly - it did not fill me up... it is all in the slicing of the bread that made all the difference to me & my guys... We also had the Calamari as our appetizer (Yummy - full squid and all!)

Mom (Me): Gnocchi w Vodka Sauce w a glass of Annabella Cab Sav ;-)
Geo: Pasta Alla Nora
Lu: Baked Rigatoni

Everything was very tasty & true to Italian Cuisine.

I rarely every give 5 stars... this would apply especially because of the area that the restaurant is in... not the nicest... However, Nora's makes up for it!

Since, I love to review I am sharing this - even though I do not want All of Vegas there taking up my space... lol

It was quite busy, however, there was still room for more... It was a Tuesday... I would say that if you are going any other day, like say the weekend, call and make a reservation & give them at least an hour or more notice...

Nora's is a legit restaurant that has been serving huge plates of tasty pasta since 1991 ( that's a long time in Vegas land). 

They have moved from their original strip mall location to a much larger free standing building. The new location is gorgeous with lovely wood floors , modern light fixtures, outside dinning ( at 105 degrees we opted out of that!), a very lovely large bar.

We did not have reservations and had to wait an hour...but it was worth it. My tip to you on this is to come in after the first rush around 7 and it should be less hectic.

Great appetizers: free garlic bread, wonderful done calamari, mozzarella sticks, a very solid Cesar salad ( somewhat pedestrian but okay).

The menu has something for everyone: great gnocchi, fantastic lasagna ( layered with light al dente  pasta, bechamel cream,  tomato sauce and rich cheese), hearty wild boar  pappardelle, lovely linguini with either shrimp scampi or salmon.....even their classic cheese pizza is pretty darn good.

The meat and fish dishes also looked fantastic although we did not partake.

Nice and extensive wine list ( nothing crazy but good solid pics). Two of us had a Chianti Classico and it was okay not great!

Service was impeccable: polite, efficient, and consistent. All used utensils were replaced with new. Water was filled consistently fast. Waiters checked back frequently to see how things were....and these guys are working lots of busy tables!!!!

Desserts looked great but we were too full.

I highly recommend Nora's for 2-10 people and feel you will have  a wonderful experience away from the strip.

Expect to pay $30 for an appetizer, a pasta dish and maybe a glass of wine....and for me from San Francisco that's a deal!",kroQYWSj-BhIEXT4VwLRHA,13,11,4,72_5-t2wSWEs4_PF1t8qPg

I ordered the lasagna and my bf ordered the ""works"" which is a mixture of sausage, jalepenos, shrimp, sun-dried tomatoes, and pasta. My lasagna was gross. It had pounds of cheese to mask the nasty flavor of the dish. I couldn't figure out what the flavor was sort of like nutmeg. The works dish was somewhat better.

Food: Get yourself some of the fried risotto balls for an appetizer to go along with the complimentary garlic bread.  My favorite entrees are the Alla Nora and any pasta with the vodka sauce.  My husband likes the linguine with clams.  I know that one of their ""famous"" dishes is the Crazy Alfredo, but I'm here to tell you that you can pass on that dish.  Too much stuff in there and the flavors don't stand out because they're all competing against each other.

Drinks: Original and handcrafted cocktails at the full bar.  Of course they have a substantial wine list also, but I'm a cocktail girl.  Those bartenders know their drinks, and can make a wicked Sazerac.

Service: There are two dining areas and a private room that you can reserve.  The private room does have a fee to reserve it, but you get this amazing appetizer platter that is enough to serve around 12 people.

And there are benches inside and outside to accommodate guests waiting for their tables. 

When we were seated, the first thing I noticed was the noise level. It was quite loud. Hard floors, high ceilings and open layout made it a little playground for all the sound waves! But it got quieter as people trickled out. The service was nice and attentive. Food came out in a timely manner.

We had the grilled octopus and calamari as appetizers. Both prepared well, but the octopus had more flavor. I had the Crazy Alfredo which I enjoyed because it was a touch spicy.

Our group of three came on a Monday night with a 7:45pm reservation. We arrived around 7:30 and were seated around 8:15. The place was packed!

My friend had about 1/4 of her Sauvignon Blanc left when the waitress came and took it away without even asking. Only one of us was given a glass of water. About halfway through the entrée, a waiter came and took our diet cokes (which were half full), ostensibly to refill them. He only brought one back.

Two of us ordered the Wild Boar Pappardelle and one ordered the eggplant parm. The egglplant parm portion was huge. Both dishes were really tasty and reasonably priced. 

I also noticed the staff walking around the restaurant were acting as if patrons were in their way and would push past you if you were walking between tables.

3737195,2017-07-10,2,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"The new building is beautiful but attitudes have completely changed.  I always loved Nora's when it was in the strip mall.  It was cramped but the food and service always left you with a good feeling despite the close quarters.  I think we are giving up on the new location though.  It started with a takeout order.
      I had ordered a good amount of food including a chocolate cake.  ""That cake takes like half an hour"", said the person on the phone.  They told me to pick it all up in half an hour.  I arrived and the hostess seemed irritated by my presence.  She came back with my food sans cake.  ""You know that takes like half an hour to cook"", she told me about the cake.  Her tone suggested I was a dumbass for ordering cake.  My food sat on the host's stand getting cold while I sat and waited for cake at the bar.  The bar tender asked what I wanted and I told him I was waiting for cake.  ""That takes like half an hour"", he said.  Thanks bud.  I asked to speak to the manager and told him my beefs.  He was very professional and gave me a voucher for $30 off my next meal.  Cool. 
      Several weeks later my wife and I pop in late in the afternoon with the plan of getting some apps and cocktails.  We used to do this frequently at the old location.  We loved the arancini and calamari.  We sat at the bar and were unacknowledged for ten minutes despite multiple people behind the bar.  It appeared the person who's section were in had tables outside the bar that needed his attention and the other bartender was not going to bother with us because we were not in his section.  This just made me sad because, as someone who worked in restaurants for years, I really admired the teamwork and camaraderie at the old location. It just gave you a good feeling while you were there.  We were never ignored there.  We got up and left, if anyone noticed they didn't care.
      The last time, still holding the $30 voucher, was around 5:00 last Saturday.  I approached the host stand, met with a rather curt, ""yes?"" from the hostess.  ""Table for two please"" I said.  She looked left, and then looked right at the half-empty dining room.  ""It's going to be about half an hour unless you want to sit on the patio"" she said.  It was about 110 degrees that day.  She cared more about keeping the sections even than getting people served.  As we left disappointed I told my wife, ""I'm tired of holding on to this stupid voucher, I've had it in my wallet for almost six months.""  ""Just give it to someone"" she said.  So I handed it to a dad in the waiting area and finally severed my maddening tie with this indifferent restaurant.",mphzknVwWCSL_St49OVNqg,6,2,2,ynsoTdYolTRkuRZeQ9y8KA

what i ate:
- mozzarella caprese (app): delicious caprese. fresh ingredients. very tasty. 
- pomodoro bruschetta (app): very fresh and garlicy on top of tasty bread. while very good, i was nervous about eating more than one and getting too full
- garlic bread: soooo garlicy and buttery and delicious. i was starving when i got to the restaurant so i think i inhaled about 1/3 of the basket. left my mouth super yummy and garlicy. but beware this bread basket! the more you eat the less room you'll have for other delectable treats
- antipasto salad: i know this is a salad, but dang, it's a filler. plenty of cheese, ham, salami, olives. very tasty italian dressing
- penne w/vodka sauce: suprise dish of the night! that vodka sauce is UH MAY ZZING! so addicting. the leftovers were pretty good the next day too
- chicken parmigianai: very well cooked. not too heavily breaded. the chicken was still moist and juicy
- pork tenderloin alla siciliana w/arugula salad, garlic red potatoes: the pork was good, but it got kicked up two notches when paired with the spicy, citrusy arugula salad. the garlic potatoes were so perfectly roasted, though i wonder, did they flash fry these suckers cause they were so crispy and addicted. probably due to being drowned in oil? shh, it's okay, just keep eating them.
- tiramisu: dessert to get! so tasty and perfect. not too soggy, not too cream. this was soooo good. i wish i had more room in my stomach to keep eating
- cannoli: tasty, but id rather have more of the tiramisu
- house sangria red and white: omg, BOTH were so tasty. not too heavy on the wine, not too sweet. just a perfect pairing. (yelp check in FREEBIE: buy one sangria or house wine, get one FREE!) the bartenders were pretty annoyed that we all used the app to get the freebie, but no shame. the sangria is great! the white one was much more refreshing, but i preferred the slightly richer red wine

pros:
- service: we had a very large party, but the server was great. he tried to keep on top of things as much as possible, despite having to juggle so many of us
- FOOD: everything!!!! i ate was so tasty and delicious
- live music: when we went on a friday night there was live music in the bar dining area. i cant really remember what kind of music they played, but it was relaxing and nice... but, due to the loud music, it may be difficult to have a conversation with your date if youre sitting in the bar dining area
- prices: very very reasonable for all the food offered

cons:
- only 1 bathroom for each sex. i was there for a few hours, and every time i went to the restroom there seemed to be a wait.

The Nora experience ...ahh where to start...
From the moment you step into Nora's you feel right at home. 
The restaurant has this indescribable homey feel to it that just puts a person at ease. There are two rooms to the restaurant, without having made a reservation, we were lucky enough to be seated immediately in the room by the kitchen.
Their ceiling is very unique and is decorated with Trinacria ornaments which is the symbol of Sicily. Our server was nice enough to give us a short history lesson...pretty interesting. 

The garlic bread...ahhh the garlic bread...I could probably eat three baskets myself. So thin, crispy, and buttery....ahh AND GARLICKY...so delicious. The first basket is free and every additional basket is 2.50...which is smart of them because it is just that addicting. I can see people going off on the garlic bread and call it a day. 

I ordered the Chicken Carciofi in attempts to be ""healthy""....I figured that chicken breast can't be that bad for you...eh. 
The order is served with pasta, fresh tomatoes, artichokes, and capers. The chicken was so moist and the flavors were just MMmmmMm...perfect...not to salty and just right. Pretty much blown away at first bite. Very generous portions, which explains why I'm stuffing my face with pasta at 1:30am...
Such a bad idea blaghhh...Body will hate me for eating all these carbs before bed.

Friends got the rigatoni special and cheese raviolis which were great as well but I was pretty overwhelmed with my Carciofi to really enjoy theirs.

We also got the calamari and mozzarella sticks as appetizers, but I wasn't really impressed with either.

Really great Italian food at very reasonable prices without sacrificing service. Our server was very attentive and informative. I will definitely be back to try the crazy alfredo. It is probably a good idea to make a reservation next time to be seated in the main room.

Lets start off with the positives: the food. 

The food is great! I haven't had a bad meal here yet. Their prices match up to the quality and the portions quite well. It isn't a cheap dinner, but it isn't outrageously expensive. 

The drinks: great wine list, and great cocktails! The bartenders know what's going on here.

The negatives: THE WAIT!

I'm tired of the wait here. We've been here 3 times at the new location, and only once did we get our food within 45 minutes of ordering it. We waiting and hour and 10 minutes the last time we were there. That is unacceptable. 

It's hard to talk negatively about a restaurant whose food you love, but I really just don't think it's worth the wait at this point. The service is WAY. TOO. SLOW.

A beautiful batch of arancini came out on the house, and was quite delicious as well. While I was tempted to give the alfredo another go, I chose our server's recommendation of the Chicken Carciofi. Super delicious if you like the flavors of lemony capers and artichoke. I must add that the dinner portions here are huge, but I was happy to have leftovers to enjoy later.

Housemade tiramisu hit the spot to close out a great dinner. Staff was attentive, attractive, and kind. Atmosphere was upscale chill without a touristy Vegas strip feel, which I really liked.

I did mention it to the server but, didn't want to make a scene in biz. I had only a few bites. It was clear when the server picked up my plate that I didn't eat it. 

After leaving I called to inform a manger so they could do better next time. After being out on hold and then hung up on (by accident,I assume). I called back and asked for a manager. I was told there wasn't one there, he had stepped out. So, I left a message and told them what I wanted to discuss

3885589,2016-08-13,1,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"I've been to Nora's twice and had somewhat different experiences. 

Both times that I went the food was very good. I've tried their gnocchi, and their fettuccini Alfredo. The gnocchi was very good, not the best that I've had in Las Vegas, but it was delicious. Everyone that I've dined with at Nora's has enjoyed their meal.

The first time I visited Nora's was with a large group, so I can understand that service was a little slow. The next time we visited with a small party the service was excellent. 

The dining room is crowded but has great ambiance - exactly what you would expect from a nice Italian restaurant. Unfortunately, you may not be seated in the dining room. The second time I visited this restaurant was when my mother was in town, and we took her to Nora's because she wanted a nice Italian dinner for her last night in Vegas. We did not have a reservation, and we were happy to wait for a table. After waiting for a few minutes we weren't taken into the dining room but instead sat next to the bussing station and kitchen. There's a tiny row of tables behind the hostess station - it's noisy,  busy with servers running food from the kitchen, and warm. I realize that this restaurant is small and busy, but I don't think it's an acceptable place to seat diners at a restaurant with prices this high. It was made even worse by the fact that the only people sitting in this area were people who were more casually dressed. So, I guess if you would like a nice seat at this restaurant either make a reservation specifying a table in the dining room or make sure you aren't dressed casually. Either way, I don't think I'll be back. There are many places in this city to get good Italian food at a lower price point with just as much ambiance as you would get sitting next to the kitchen at Nora's.",n-Hit0Y3O6FxTiEhdEEsZw,3,2,3,UumHqD0AUIQB9OF1PXomMw

The ambiance was very nice, upon entry it seemed very classy and upscale, but don't be fooled--the prices are very affordable. We were greeted by very sweet hostesses and seated immediately. 

The menu is not too overwhelming. There were a lot of options, but not too menu that you don't know where to look first. It's also nicely sectioned off hy what kind of dish you are looking for--meat, seafood, pasta, etc. As an OCD list maker, I appreciated that. 

The food was absolutely amazing. I ordered the crazy alfredo and was blown away! I love my food spicy and the one thing about pasta is that other than red pepper flakes added after the dish is served, it is not usually spicy. This dish had jalapenos in it and while I am not a fan of jalapeños, I thoroughly enjoyed the spiciness it added to the dish. 

The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because we waited quite awhile for the garlic bread to come out. I had previously looked up Nora's on Yelp and had read that their garlic bread is the best in town so I was anxiously waiting for it. Which by the way is completely TRUE.

We came with the 3 kids 2 in highchairs and they seemed pretty family friendly. But I felt they seated us right in the middle of the bar area and with kids there just wasn't much wiggle room and felt out of place with singles and older couples drinking at the bar and trying to enjoy their night out. They did have an entire other side of the restaurant which would've been a better option to seat a party with kids. 

As for the food it's was meh. My hubby loves Alfredo so he got the crazy Alfredo which he did eat it all but said there was too much going on with mostly sausage and peppers. I got the lasagna and we didn't finish it, and a white pizza which definitely lacked flavor, it was just crust, spinach, cheese, no fresh herbs or drizzle of olive oil which is common at other pizzerias on their white pizzas. The garlic bread had a ton of garlic, kids didn't like it but hey I like garlic so it was ok. Service was ok nothing worth noting just kinda blah. I also saw 2 other tables that sent food back, not sure if it was the flavor or just the wrong order. So yea I could say it's worth a try on date night but I would stick with OG which might have even been cheaper too.",RdTdVgd9u58BA52d0eHqcQ,1,0,3,Ebuu_P93aLc_QNyZWjfmGw

The only thing we would change is more live serenades - we miss it when one of the owners sons would give us Italian serenades (these were frequent at the prior location just a little a little West of the current NEW location).   

Inevitably, returning family and friends from out-of-town always request a meal at Nora's.  Tonight, we had a party of 10 and we received the most attentive and perfect service from Daniel and Jacob.   A huge thank you to the staff at Nora's for excellent service and even more amazing food!

I ordered one of their menu's ""Lunch Favorites.""  It was the penne chicken broccoli pasta with garlic and oil.  It was excellent.  One minus--there wasn't enough garlic taste for me.  One of the others at the table ordered a large pizza with pineapple and mushrooms--the pineapple being a first for me.  It was such a pity when there were three pieces of pizza left over and she couldn't take it home with her.  She was winging back to Canada the next morning.  I made the sacrifice and took one for the team.  I brought the three pieces home, had one for dinner, and have the other two frozen for a lunch treat!  Tip to Yelpers---go out to eat with out of town friends the day before they're flying home and you might get some take out for the rest of the week.

3982333,2012-11-03,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Italian food is tough to get wrong, but also tough to get right. Nora's gets it almost right, but I don't find it to be the local legend people make it out to be.

The complimentary (well, uh, the first basket at least, which is pretty miserly!) bread is pretty good - flavorful and crisp, and buttery on top. Just a little burned on the edges too, which helps. The appetizers and entrees, while tasty, just aren't rich and robust enough to be legendary. The pasta has never seemed particularly fresh to me, and the portions are pretty tiny. Still, it's good, hearty Italian food - just a bit generic.

Last time, I was daring and tried the Chicken Mount Etna.
Don't repeat my mistake. Its flavor is more Chinese than Italian.

Lastly, a couple of non-food-related critiques:

1. Service can be inattentive at times, but they get pretty insanely busy so it's excusable.

2. Try and avoid the obnoxious band. If I want live music, I'll go to a concert.
2a. It's loud as hell in there, even when there isn't a band.

3. They partake in possibly my most-hated restaurant ritual - having empty wine glasses on the table upon arrival. Prepare for an awkward moment and a subtly disappointed waiter when you don't order wine.

When you're in the mood for no-nonsense Italian, Nora's can certainly hit the spot. I just didn't find that it lives up to its reputation.",ITNVSsPgUIWOwgKMSqwZ2w,1,0,3,7xBRbcw2WazpRD-oF4npPg

Nora's serves up hot, chewy, buttery, garlicky bread to diners.  They offer an extensive wine list and tons of specialty cocktails.  Last night, my husband sampled the pilgrim's passion.  An alluring blend of gin, passion fruit, elderflower, mint and egg whites.  I had a HUGE glass of red sangria ($7.50).  

We started with the gemberroni fritti.  Lightly dusted, fried plump shrimp with mixed greens, lemon wedges, and a zesty tomato caper sauce.  ($9.95).  A great way to start.

Next, we shared the alla nora ($9.50) and the fettucini carbonara ($12.50).  The alla nora is ground beef, eggplant and spaghetti baked with a crispy crust on top.  It's really good, and a heaping portion. The carbonara was as heart stopping as you'd imagine.  Creamy, dreamy, and delectable.  

We finished our hearty meal with a tiramisu.  Light and creamy and perfect coffee flavor.  The tiramisu vanished but lots of leftovers to take home otherwise.

One year we took a trip to Texas to buy a car, so when we planned our route back to California, we stopped in town for dinner, since it was during the holiday season, Nora's wasn't open on the day we went so we stayed the night in Las Vegas just so that we could dine at Nora's the next day, that's how big a fan we are!
 I have become adventurous and have tried many items on their menu, it never disappoints. This past August we took our 6-year-old super picky eater to dine at Nora's.

Probably the best meal of the entire trip. Everything that was said here about the food is all accurate and true. The portions are huge, enough to be shared family style, a small salad for 1-3 can still feed 4-5. 

Service was very friendly and generous. I made reservations ahead of time based on the reviews that it can get quite crowded, even on a week night, we were seated in the dining room where the room was full of families, women on a girls night out, couples, etc, the room was alive and buzzing. 

Had a lovely glass of Dr L reisling which comes in an adorable little carafe. WIth an unfortunate helping of parmesean cheese garnished on the dish of one of my lactose intolerant dining companions, they were quick to replace the dish with a fresh bash of non dairy product . 

We shared the antipasto salad and bruschetta and indivdually ordered the linguine with clams, baked ziti and chicken erbe fini. 
I had the linguine with clams with the white wine, olive oil and garlic sauce, excellent dish, plenty of clams, pasta served el dente, was too much of a serving, that I couldnt finish. 

We had also earlier ordered the chcocolate cake based on the numerous suggestions here and it was a great way to end a very hearty meal. The chocolate cake has pistachio bits and has a brownie like crunch to it, but very ooey and moist on the inside. 

The only sad part of the evening is that we were so stuffed and knowing we were going to be heading out to a party later on and that we're staying in a hotel with no fridge, had no way to savor any of the leftovers the next day. 

I've had many of good meals in Vegas during my trips there, however this is a kind of place you want to go to when you're wanting to go where the locals go and stay away from the pretentiousness and drama with some of the high end restaurants on the strip.

Wouldn't recommend for lunch, if you're okay with going to the strip for some Italian food go to Grand lux cafe or somewhere else, this place just set the expectations high and exciting but didn't provide the flavors or the quality of service we were looking for.

Gio used to sit me down and feed me pasta with meatballs and a sausage shaped like a penis - thanks for that Gio :D hahaaaaa

Good times. Their food is honestly delicious. They just opened a new location next to the old location and I'm so happy they did because they made the restaurant bigger which was needed, and they did a beautiful job with the new place. It's a wonderful environment to dine in.

I hear Gio is turning the old location into a pizza place, which I could not be happier about because I love their pizza. The Snow White pizza has been a favorite of mine in town for 14 years. And I'm a huge pizza lover with very good taste in pizza, when I say pizza is good it's very good. The service is always great as well.

4163718,2016-11-20,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Last night, Saturday, My boyfriend, friend, and I went to eat at Nora's. I was excited to eat here and expected a lot. We walk into the restaurant and the new set-up is beautiful. I pass by the restaurant every day on Flamingo on my way to work, and the new location is much nicer, aesthetically, than the old one. So, I decide to take my friend here as a special occasion since she is visiting from out of town. 

Anyway, this was our first time eating here. We had reservations at 8:30pm. We arrive at that time, and get seated shortly after. The hostess gives us our menus, and we wait for our server. We were right by the entrance to the kitchen, so there were many workers who passed us. No one came to greet us. At about 8:55pm, still with no service, we literally had to track down our server, who seemed reluctant to help us when we approached her. She didn't even acknowledge that we've been waiting. There was actually no greeting or introduction at all. Just, ""Can I get you something to drink?"". We ordered our drinks and food from her at the same time. 

I ordered a Hitachino white ale, water, and angel hair pasta with arrabiata sauce and sausage. My boyfriend ordered a diet, water, crazy alfredo pasta, and a calamari appetizer. My friend ordered water and fettuccine alfredo. 

After waiting for a bit longer, and still nothing on our table, the server came back to tell me they are out of the beer. So, I ordered a sangria. Meanwhile, my boyfriend goes to speak with the manager. He said the server is newer and he would expedite the order. After this, the food arrived in the following order: 1) my sangria, 2) only two waters, 3) the calamari, 4) the diet (after re-requesting), 5) the third water, 6) the complimentary bread, 7) the main dishes. 

The food, itself, was tasty but nothing spectacular. I enjoyed it, but for the price - not worth it. The portions were decent. The food presentation was good. However, taste-wise, it was like any other Italian restaurant. I would say, the food rates a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Honestly, it wasn't something I would come back for, even if the service was good. 

The service made this experience a poor one. When service is this poor, the manager usually does something about it. I was a server for years, and a comp of some type is usually offered to the guests. Nothing. After almost a half-hour, we had to sequester our server to come help us, and when we previously waved or tried to flag down anyone else, they ignored us. Most likely, because it wasn't their section. I mean, c'mon, at least attempt to rectify the situation by offering us a second round of already-free bread or something. 

The restaurant was busy, and it was a Saturday night. However, there were a good handful of people, bus boys and servers, who were quick to clear a table once the party was finished. Like, I'm talking, immediately after guests left. So, busyness or lack of help was not an excuse for not assisting us. 

Our bill came out to $81 for the three of us. I rarely ever leave less than 18-20% of the taxed bill. Last night, I made an exception. The food was okay. Service was terrible. I do not recommend this restaurant and will not be returning.",nrzswAPvMSjecJt8nK_BFQ,4,1,2,bjpR1X2Qs3fJpchYd8TuGg

Then we the food runner gave us our plates, my boyfriend had visual mushrooms in his dish, after he had specifically asked for no mushrooms to be on there. My dish was not even the one I ordered. The woman apologized & took them both back. When she returned everything was right. Our server asked what went wrong, but didn't seem to apologetic. Both dishes were delicious. I'll definitely be back to try more. My boyfriend agreed. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because 3 out of 3 dishes needed to be remade & nothing was taken off the bill.

Anthony was on top of it and greeted us right away.  My bf got the veal (wah I tell him veal is not pc but he won't listen) and I ordered us calamari to start and Anthony recommended the alla nora to me over lasagna.  We were started with garlic bread which was good though it was covered in butter... straight to my ass. j Straight to my ass!  Second and third pieces... no control whatsoever.  The calamari was also amazing!  Perfect amount of crispy texture and the sauce they serve it with I had to ask for a second ramekin- I wanted to drink it.  I debated taking the ramekin into the bathroom so I could lick all the marinara out of it but thought if anyone saw me take a ramekin into the bathroom they'd think I was a weirdo.  Ok trying to maintain some class I stopped eating the calarmari.  I'm a little person so I was already full at this point.  I took a few bites of my dinner when it came but was still full.  There was a piece of crisp basil on top of the alla nora that I was in love with.  Next time I go to Nora's I'll ask for extra basil leaves like this!!!  Obsessed.  Alla Nora had a parmesean-basil type of grantinee over eggplant, meatball and spaghetti.  I loved it.  I tried some of my bf's side of plain spaghetti which was also very good.  I mean it's weird bc something so basic as spaghetti I don't generally find good but this was.  I did not try my bf's veal but he was very very happy with it.  He is straight-up Italian so he just loves Italian food.  We eat at Mezze near our home a lot and we decided it's a close call which is better but Nora's wins.  I ordered a cannoli to go but wished the chocolate cake had been offered at the start because it takes 20 minutes to make and I didn't read that on the menu.  It was the only chocolate dessert.  The cannoli has chocolate chips on half of it so I guess there is that.  The other half has pistachio bits on the cannoli btw.

4175979,2017-02-22,4,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"The Yelp reviews enticed me to visit this place. Summary: Food was good. Service was absolutely terrible.  Very rude waitress.  

My first experience, I came here with a date.  I ordered what appears to be everyone's favorite - the Crazy Alfredo.  I love Alfredo sauce. The portion served could feed two people. We ordered the Bruschetta Promodoro.  Recommended.  We moved on to the entries and finally desert.  Overall, the food was pretty good. 

Unfortunately,  the waitress was very rude and provided exceptionally poor service.  If someone doesn't like their job - they really shouldn't put themselves in such situations.  From the time we arrived, the waitress appeared unfriendly.  Her demeanor left me with an impression that she was not happy 1. doing her job. 2. providing us service (personal problem of hers maybe?).  Both relatively polite individuals who didn't make any odd/uncommon requests for service.  

I ignored her rudeness, since I was there to enjoy dinner with my date.  Naturally, I avoided any additional order or asking any questions about the menu options.  She made me feel so uncomfortable, I just didn't want her near our table.  

On my second visit, we got the same person.  The waitress remembered me and appeared to make an effort to be friendly, initially.  Unfortunately, that was short lived.  Her presence was just negative.  You can just sense the negativity in a person - whether it is their dismissive facial gestures, or overall rude tone of voice.  

Again, I have no tolerance for such people and pay no mind.  What bothered me more on this second visit is her crude remark.  Apparently, a term I used to describe what I wanted to order - rubbed her the wrong way?  She made a very rude remark that made me give her a quick look - but I smiled and moved on.  I don't come here to engage such petty people - I come here to enjoy good food with good company.  Unfortunately, this same waitress chipped away at my attempt to enjoy dinner with my date. 

On my third visit (Italian is a favorite for many, and the food is good).  This time, my date insisted on visiting this place as she never had the pleasure of experiencing it herself.  So, I took a chance.  Long and behold - the SAME waitress for the third time.  No difference.  This waitress provides such poor service, I had to walk over to the bartender, order a drink and tipped him well.  He noticed the poor service being offered by the Waitress.  In fact, he even gave me a look as if he acknowledged what was going on.",buibBR68DBwEOn-KEyepyw,3,1,2,0jc_8flfvf62rzjX1bkA9g

What does this even mean?  We were then offered the bar or the patio.  Being our anniversary this is not acceptable.  Nora's used to be a fun place, but it seems they have gotten too big for themselves, they have stopped caring about the customers.  I guess they have enough so why be bothered.  They need some kind of actual system for reservations that works.  On New Year's this also happened but it was worse because 5 tables that had reservations after us were sat first, looked like they forgot us at the bar.

She's 7 and also made a compliment about how delicious it was. I had the linguini and clams it was pretty tasty except my hubby got the angel hair pasta with the arrabiata sauce and after I took a taste of that we ended up switching. He liked the linguini and clams better and I liked the angel hair and arrabiata better so it worked out very well. I just wanted to try something different. My husband had a cup of coffee and he said it was pretty good which is also rare for him to compliment restaurant coffee because he uses a French press at home and he swears they make the best coffee. We ended our meal with tiramisu. I have to admit as a tiramisu fan I didn't like the way it was prepared. The lady fingers were very soggy which ruined the entire flavor of the dessert. I am still giving Nora's 5 stars though due to the fact everything else was great. We will for sure go back whenever we're on that side of town.",EoDVa1xeOQVzfVSeCJZPbg,0,0,5,5kOXfOh6FvW2J7GzMxf4CA

We waited about 5 minutes before being greeted by our server and asked if we were ready to order. We then told him it was our first time here and would like some recommendations, he wasn't very friendly and seemed to be rushed. We got the ceaser salad that was way over dressed and tasted like an overkill of anchovies, we couldn't eat it. My husband had the chicken Milanese and was very bland and lacked flavor. I had the lasagna it was just ok but the pasta was very mushy definitely wouldn't recommend. My kids had chicken parmesan it was the best one out of the three dishes, but the marinara sauce could definitely have a little more flavor and seasoning. Never really saw the server around until he dropped the check without offering dessert or asking if we wanted or needed anything else which I wanted dessert, but when someone drops the check it must be because you don't want us to spend anymore money or appreciate our business. This is a huge pet peeve of mine. I was watching the server next to us and he was amazing at interacting with his tables and recommending dishes with wine and constantly being visible to where if his tables needed anything he was on it. My husband and I had to ask his name it was Donald he was amazing keep up the good job. So if you do decide to go there ask for him he will give you better service and a better dining experience.

Had lunch there today, ordered calamari, pizza, and angel hair with meatballs and marinara sauce.  The calamari was the best part of the meal, actually very good.  However, the pasta and meatballs were bland, sauce did not taste like any marinara sauce I have had, and the meatballs did not seem to have any type of seasonings.  On the opposite side, the pizza was so salty, could only eat a slice, and there was something missing that I just couldn't put my finger on until I got the bill.  That's when I discovered that the Capricciosa pizza we ordered was not what we received, instead our waiter, Travis, brought us a All 4 Stagioni; considering all the stuff on the pizza, no way could we tell what they were serving anyway and seeing our bill it all made sense about why the pizza tasted so different than what we were expecting.  Then to top it all off, the coffee we asked for never arrived, but the bill sure did!  Look, the place is nice and airy, very clean, and maybe there are other things on the menu that may be good.

When you walk in,  you come directly to the pizza order counter,  but we were seated to the left, which was a more private area, nice for dates, possibly. Frank Sinatra, Michael Buble, etc. was playing in the background.

On to the food. You start out with a complimentary order of the garlic bread,  which was amazing! Sooo garlicky, with fresh minced garlic. We had the fried calamari, which came out quicker than expected. Microwaved? Or maybe it was just because it was slow at the time. Either way, it wasn't as crispy as I'd like, but still enjoyable.  It was served with this sauce that kinda tasted like a roasted chile salsa you'd find at a taco shop, and paired really well with the dish.

For the main dish, I had the pappardelle pasta with the wild boar and red wine ragu. Oh. My. Poop. I loved it! The meat was tender and the sauce full of flavor. I had some leftovers and was actually excited to get hungry again so I could eat the rest of it.

You can sit at the bar and have an amazing cocktail and chat up some of the regulars. When I go I usually order the clover club.

My wife and I, along with 3 other couples from San Jose, traveled to Las Vegas to meet another couple for the husband's 65th birthday.  Friends had a strong recommendation for Nora's from people they trust, so the group agreed to have one of our 3 dinners at this restaurant.

Although we stayed in a hotel along the infamous Strip, Nora's was only a 10 minute cab ride to the west.  As many Yelpers have noted, it's not a fancy place from the outside...and not exactly on the inside either... but some of the best Italian food we've found was in similar surroundings ( like the late lamented Gaetano's in the LA suburb of La Habra and some in our hometown of San Jose ).

We had reservations for 10 people at 915 PM on a Thursday evening, but when we arrived at 9 PM, it was packed.  No surprise according to plenty of reviewers.  But the guy handling reception duties, servers  and even other customers waiting for tables were in a good mood.  Is everyone in Las Vegas a comedian ( or trying to be )?

By the way, there was one promising sign of a happy meal to come.  We all know how big promises can lead to big disappointment, but I've noticed...at least with Italian restaurants...if it smells good in the parking lot, it usually tastes good later on.  Nora's passed the smell test.

Patrons were slow to leave, but one table left at 915 PM so some of the staff rearranged things and our group got into their chairs by 925 PM.  A bit late for me ( I typically start dinner about 7 ), though we were on Vegas time. Although we shared the room with a party of 20 celebrating a birthday, there was no cramping of space for us or several other tables for 2 and 4.

Age has its benefits, but short-term memory is not one of them.  Details on the food have faded into a haze ( maybe from the casino in the Mirage.  What a hell hole! ), but longer lasting impressions are important, too.

The menu was quite large and varied with many favorites recognized from the lists of Italian restaurants in neighborhoods around the country.  Question was...how well did Nora's handle the job?

First thing on the table were loaves of garlic bread.  I usually can't resist that stuff, especially is it's half decent, and it was really good that night.  Or maybe I was just starved.  Either way, after a basket of bread and part of my draft beer, I began to breathe as if the waiter brought a dose of smelling salts.  I'll always remember my mother saying ""don't load up on bread"", but it's a hard habit to break.

Friends passed around several salads, though since I'm not a sharer, I kept my plate behind a moat of utensils.  That's just as well.  I need my own salad every day...and it was quite good.  Nobody at the table voiced any disagreement.

My entree was eggplant parmagiana, which as a ""chicken-fish"" vegetarian, I seem to order a lot of the time.  I'd give it an 8 on a scale of 10.  Not bad!  Good size, texture and tomato taste.  The side order of spaghetti was also respectable.  My wife's chicken marsala was good, but she thought the sauce was too sweet.  I can't remember what our friends had, but nobody raised their hand to complain, at least publicly. By the time we finished at 11 PM, our group of greying baby boomers was a tad tuckered, so we bypassed dessert and called cabs for the short ride back to the Mirage.

We split the bill evenly among the 5 couples and each paid an astoundingly small $44 plus tip.  That's a lotta food in a high priced town.  Service was friendly in a good-natured, smart-alecky way.  The oldest member of the staff I spotted was in his 30's, so it seemed like a bunch of neighborhood kids...the family?...running the restaurant and having fun doing it.  You almost felt like a regular after one visit.

There must be tons of Italian restaurants around Las Vegas, but if you need to get away from crowds in the big hotels, Nora's is a solid choice for eating within a decent distance of your room.",5AVWo7Un0bM9qbhvgC8pCA,2,2,4,sBgNo8TzbP3HzBM2NE3i-Q

We arrived at the start of dinner service and found that they were already getting busy. The hostess was quick in getting everyone seated. Our waiter was quick to greet us and get drinks started. He was friendly and professional. There was never a long period of time without him checking in on us. 

The garlic bread was really good. It's definitely meant for true garlic lovers, but this is why I liked it. We passed on a second basket because we didn't want to get too full, but I regretted it later. 

I started with a House Salad and my husband started with the Caesar Salad. Both salads were very good. I really liked the house Italian dressing and the large portion of cheese on top. 

For my main entrée I had the Crazy Alfredo because this was the dish recommended to me by all Nora's fans. The dish lived up to the hype for me even though I think this was my first alfredo dish in at least 10 years. The sauce was delicious and I loved the combination of chicken, sausage, shrimp, jalapeno, cheese, and mushrooms. Definitely a yummy combination. The portion was enough for two people and could definitely be shared. I'd also recommend sharing since it is such a rich dish.

My husband ordered the Veal Parmesan. He thought it was good, but not the best he has ever had. I tasted the red sauce on the spaghetti and didn't care for it.

We were able to get a table for 4 at 8.30 pm. The place was PACKED. Hardly any parking and every single table was full. Very little waiting area near the hostess booth. 
However, we were seated right at 8.30 pm, so that wasn't a problem.

I ordered the Frutti di Mare, which is mussels, calamari, clams, and fish over linguini (red sauce). Big disappointment on the mussels. There were only 4 and they were very very briny and fishy tasting, leading me to believe they were not fresh. I'm from Southern Italy. I pretty much started eating mussels out of the womb, they shouldn't taste like that. 

The calms were un-shelled and mixed in with the pasta. I would much rather have them in the shell. In the sauce, you lose the flavor of the clams. Overall, pasta was cooked well and sauce was good. But for $22, not worth it. Calamari tubes are really cheap and the plate was loaded with it. They need to knock down the price of this dish. 

Our waitress did not bring us water, even though we asked multiple times. We all left parched.

Thirty minutes later, another waiter came to our table, as I guess we were just sitting there with blank stares on our faces, and asked if anyone was helping us.  At that moment, our food came out.  We were fried after sitting outside for an hour in the heat, even with their misters, and were tired and annoyed it took an hour for our meals to arrive.  We had them box it up, cancel our dessert, and we left, about 70 mins after arrival.  I couldn't stomach the idea of sitting there for another hour.  Or whatever it was going to be.

Reserved for a Wednesday night dinner at the newly relocated Nora's.  

Reservation process was a complete hassle and I should have taken notice early on.  No Open Table and Nora's on-line website booking system unavailable.  Telephone call resulted in a ""we're not open message"" without any option to leave a message.  Repeat call resulted in a long hold for a live attendant to accept a reservation.  Reservation offered was 15-45 minutes adjacent to requested time, which I gladly accepted.

Arrived just a few minutes before our 6:45 reservation to a jam packed waiting area filled with mostly angry patrons.  Second sign I should have abandoned the reservation.

Checked in with the hostess and proceeded to wait 45 minutes beyond my reservation while witnessing two things exclusively:  #1, patrons simply abandoning their reservations and departing; or #2, patrons waiting 30-60 minutes beyond their reserved / promised time, while complaining amongst themselves and / or to the hostess stand -- all to no avail.

I've dined at Nora's many times in the past while visiting Las Vegas.  Things have changed for the worst and I won't be back.

I understand issues and circumstances arise.  Communication goes a long way towards mitigating unforeseen matters.  Issues / circumstances were not the issue, its simply they way Nora's chooses to do business.  Oversubscribe, overpromise, and under deliver are the new norm and this customer votes with his wallet.

Hostess sat us, 45 minutes after our reservation, without so much as an apology.

Loads of outstanding restaurants in Las Vegas.  Many of which appreciate your business and honor the very basics, such as a reservation time.  Nora's has run its course and we won't give them another opportunity to showcase poor, poor execution.",lqkOwVbYONxxmc8qvKCmHw,2,1,2,p7SQtvhKagHrqeKCG3NPnQ

It was a while in coming: two previous attempts to make a reservation got shot down, but on a Tuesday night we were ""allowed"" to dine at 9:00 p.m., and found the place mobbed.  Incredible.

So why not five stars?  After all, the house salad that we shared was pretty damned nice, too, even though I don't eat olives or pepperoncini.  But Herb does, and when it was served we thought they had mistakenly brought us the large size.  And tasty, complimentary garlic bread was a delicious touch.

The service was terrific, too, with our waiter available when we needed him, but not overly obtrusive.

We were, sadly, disappointed in the Chicken Marsala.  Perfectly pretty spaghetti accompanied it, and the chicken was very tender and juicy.  But the sauce was overwhelming sweet, overwhelmingly drowning the chicken, and frankly, the portion - compared to everything else we had, and saw on other tables - seemed very skimpy.  I can't remember the last time I disliked this dish, except maybe in a New Jersey diner.

I also found the prices to be all over the place.   There's something for everyone, but if you're on a budget, many items seemed priced too high.  And that goes for the award-winning wine list, too - wine prices are steep.  Our total bill was reasonable, but we're not big eaters and usually don't eat red meat or seafood.

I can see why Nora's has such great ratings.  I recommend it highly, and will go back as soon as possible.  But for me, that fifth star is elusive.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,12,8,4,D_dtxw7Bjb0Jm_mjl5sUMQ

Service is always a main concern for me and I definitely felt Nora's exceeded in this area.  I believe our servers name was Bryce and he was helpful the whole time.  Calamari appetizer was great.  I ordered the crazy Alfredo and wasn't overly impressed, but it wasn't bad by any means.  I'd order something else next time probably.  My parents ordered the carbonara and a penne dish and both loved them.  I personally didn't like the sangria...something tasted really off to me but again my parents both enjoyed it.  I had the Oreo dessert and they got the pistachio cannoli...both tasted  excellent but my parents found a piece of plastic in the last few bites of their cannoli.  The server ended up taking it off the menu for us.  Kind of a subpar experience overall in my opinion.  I want to like this place and would probably give it one more shot.  Everything would need to go right from the service to the food the next time though for me to make Nora's a repeat place for me.",QP1R1yG1YeOwsamlE9aOfw,1,0,3,CEgnWuE_nenmy8gNotSVhQ

The service doesn't deserve a star!!!  We were originally seated at wobbly table and the Hostess kindly changed our seating with no hesitation. After waiting for water for 10 minutes our server came over ready to take our order and we still didn't have water at that time. After placing our wine order, I had to stop the waiter immediately to place an appetizer order. As we sat and talked we realized it's taking our order longer than anticipated. It finally came. Same thing with our food.  The waiter didn't ask if we would like anything or advised us of our food being up shortly(time frame) The waiter dropped our food off and didn't look back. Didn't ask if we needed anything. We had to ask for red pepper flakes for our pizza. We asked for water twice and received it once. Now, if someone buys a bottle of wine, isn't it just business sense to ask if they would like another bottle? (Increasing Nora's revenue/sales) Would you like dessert? I mean sell us!  We are there to dine and enjoy!!!  We wanted another bottle, we wanted to converse with our waiter, we wanted to eat until we were stuffed to the gills. Instead, we received a hurry up and eat. The food is great the service is HORRIBLE!!! I even asked the family behind me. The father wasn't happy as well.",88o0eMIJRbQPgI4MUI8iAg,0,0,1,_2vR1cQGxFiOapgv9UCbow
4491249,2014-12-27,7,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Nora's Cuisine has been seen as Las Vegas's best kept secret since opening in 1991. I recently was let in on that secret when I was on West Flamingo with a strong craving for Italian Food. When I walked in I noticed the decor of dark cherry and textured paint on the walls. My first condo was decorated  similar so it felt very inviting. The limited seating also made for a cozy dining experience.

We were brought some complimentary garlic bread almost immediately after being seated. The aroma from the bread was intoxicating but when I bit into the bread the grease was too heavy that I felt it on the roof of my mouth. I've had better garlic bread so I just moved on to the Caesar Salad. The Romaine lettuce was crisp and lightly coated with homemade dressing.  Honestly the croutons that topped the salad were much better than the bread and the Caesar dressing was perfect. 

I was torn between the Chicken and Veal Parmigiana so I asked the waiter his favorite out of the two. He said he preferred the Veal. When I can't decide sometimes I ask for the waiter's advice as a tie breaker but it doesn't always go so well . I'm happy to say this time the waiter knew what he was talking about! The veal was tender inside with crispy outer breading. It was served  over a tasty marinara sauce and topped with a healthy dose of mozzarella cheese. I also tested my husband's Baked Rigatoni which was made with a meat sauce, rigatoni, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses. My impression at first bite was it was too salty. It tasted better the next day. 

On a sweeter note we had the Oreo Tartufo for dessert. It was a ball of cookies and cream ice cream covered with a hard chocolate shell. It was big enough to share and small enough where you wouldn't  feel sorry you ate it. It was sinfully delicious! 

Nora's is great place for date night or a family dinner. The portions are generous and the service is excellent!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,13,9,4,T7Z0K2mGCZ2MYC6TkeHXKw
4492079,2011-05-25,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"I heard great things about Nora's so we decided to give it a try.

It's literally in a strip mall on Flamingo/Jones. And, decor is nothing spectacular. I was, also, a little disappointed with paper tableclothes, but if the food was good I was willing to overlook it.

We sat in the dining room to the left of the entrance which had tables right on top of each other, so definately not a place togo if you want any sort of quiet or private setting. It was kinda loud actually, and we were very aware of the birthday party happening to our right and the party of 12 to our left.

They give you a basket of garlic bread to start (1st basket is free) and it wasn't very good...it seemed just like anything frozen you can buy at the grocery store.

We were never offered a wine list, which I thought was odd. Aside from this, I thought the service was really good.

We ordered 2 entrees...chicken parmesan & sausage rigatoni.

The chicken parm was an unbreaded breast with tons of cheese, and pretty tasteless. It was served with about a pound of pasta (literally). I make better chicken parm at home. The sausage dish was actually my husband's, but I did get to sample the left overs. He thought it was excellent. 

For desert he had some sort of oreo ice cream dipped in chocolate. I had a traditional canoli. We respectively, gave these a B.

They had quite a list of dessert martinis, as well, and I couldn't resist trying the banana coconut cream pie martini. It was pretty small, but really strong, and didn't taste much like any thing except alcohol.

The entire check came to around $50 for 2 people.

Overall, Nora's was just OK. I probably won't go again simply because I think there are much better places to get an Italian food fix. But, atleast I can say I've gone.",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,2,1,2,wyBNbeBBw6g6DMFuqIDQ-Q

On my menu....

Trying to keep track of what someone else is consuming is a pain. I'll just recite what I had yesterday...

Garlic Bread (*** Complimentary) Unlike other patrons of Nora's... was not overly impressed with this Garlic Bread. We had two to three re-fills, and each refill was not consistent with any previous refill. Bread not up to par with the rest of the meal...

Alla Nora (**** 1/2 $10.50) Spaghetti, Eggplant, Ground Beef, Tomato Sauce, Pesto, and a variety of Cheeses with a light layer of Breading on top thrown together into a Bowl and baked until the surface is lightly crusty. I told you I was going to have this entree on my next visit! Did not disappoint!

Carafe of Sangria (****) Sangria is supposed to be the Wine Punch of Spain... what is it doing on the menu of an Italian restaurant? The Red Wine was light and dry... but in Nora's version the Fruit, either sliced or chopped was missing or in small supply. Would have been more refreshing with more Fruitiness.

Service was business-like and efficient... and distant. My favorite Italian, where I live, the owner is quite a bit friendlier and attentive... and hand-kissing towards the fairer sex. Maybe I didn't notice it on my first visit, but I was sitting on one of the outside seats of the table.... and caught my attention very quickly. Waiters a little too brusque for me... maybe they weren't Italian!

We got to Nora's around 5pm to 6pm, and there was no problem getting in and, most importantly, no waiting! But... after we got seated, the rush of diners started.",K5FrmVM70cJDbMiZ9ywMag,1,0,4,C502YGwKkvCc6X3dJNTFVw

It was very noisy and you could hardly hear each other. But the waiter was very nice and accommodating. May give it one more chance on the patio.",T9KGawbYlehkYy0MfwroXg,0,0,2,kTyqevcxKakFn7eeF3WL5Q

The lunch service was a little slow but I'll tell you what, the FOOD was worth the wait.  We got the Steak and Arugula Bruschetta as an appetizer and it was out of this world!!!   AMAZING!!!  They do bring you a small basket of Garlic Bread, the first one is on them the menu says and then $2.50 after that.  The bread is amazing but when you get a basket with just 4 small pieces for two people and then want to charge me $2.50 for another 4 pieces, that I may question.

I had the Rigatoni Special and the sauce, the sausage, the meatballs, OMG... we also a Nora special which is not on the togo menu so I cannot tell you the exact name but I was told it was the BEST they have ever had.

So since our experience with the food was SO AMAZING, we decided to go back last night and bring my daughter and her husband.  Of course we had the Steak and Arugula Bruschetta and they ordered the regular Bruschetta and both were again very good.  We also ordered the regular Antipasto Salad which we have had in a lot of Italian places and this was by far the BEST.

This time I decided to try the Chicken Parmigiana which you can get breaded or not and it was AMAZING..  The portion size was give me a to go box size which I did take home.  We also had the Veal Chop Parm, a $42 plate but I tell you what, the size of this Bone in Veal was so big, it came home and provided two more meals.  My daughter had the baked Rigatoni and her husband had the Snow White Pizza.  I guess he was having a Disney moment.  

Both dishes were amazing and to go boxes were in order for those as well.  he ordered the medium pizza and it was big enough for 2 to 3 people.  

They all wanted deserts and OMG, the cheesecake is to DIE for, no you won't die if you eat it but after all the food you might explode, the Cookies and Cream Tartufo was amazing, the Panna Cotta was WOW and then a Toasted coconut drink with drambui, and brandy was the topping on the meal.

My friend Frank from AZ comes here all the time and this place was packed non stop last night until about 8:30 then it started to slow down, but I truly understand why Frank says there is NO PLACE like this in Vegas for food of this quality.  Everyone from the hostess to the Manager last night were some of the warmest and friendliest people who ensured the place was running like a well oiled machine and they did an AMAZING JOB!!!  Many kudos to the kitchen and the entire staff, this is one of the BEST Italian places we have ever found her in Las Vegas and HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place and we will be back often, it is just that good.

They do not give military discounts but that is ok, this place is so good I will support them and so should you.  The prices are very reasonable and it is worth every penny.  I don't want to see corners cut to provide a discount and GOOD FOOD is worth paying for and this place is for REAL!!!!",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,5,4,5,RiXlrTfgcseLhqN1tmEKzg

Yummy garlic bread.  We had the Spaghetti and Meatballs, and the meatballs are excellent!  Full of flavor, moist.  The Antipasto Salad is super fresh, crisp romaine lettuce, great deli meats.  Sadly The Chocolate Cake was a bit disappointing for us.  I think it had like nutts and and lemony sauce, it just wasnt quite our cup of tea.  But their Canoli's, OMG those where some of the best i've ever had, very very good!  We visit Vegas often and so far we've been back twice( in 2 months) .

I came here twice within a month.  It's intimate, yet fun to bring a small group of friends.  Reservations are recommended, because they are quite popular with the locals.  

The calamari is a great starter (light in batter, crispy, yet not oily).

The Frutti di Mare with the spicy marinara is yummy if you like a whole lotta seafood.  All portions are big, so you can share between two people. 

But if you like something light in taste and creamy and not too meaty... I recommend the Melrose Shrimp.  Creamy basil pesto, zucchini & sun-dried tomatoes, and linguini-- garnished with 3-4 giant succulent seasoned shrimps.  There are pine nuts added which gives it a nice crunch, but you can ask them to hold off on that if you're allergic or it's not your thing.

I really enjoyed their live band which played a lot of vocal jazz (New Orleans kinda tunes).  It was great vibe.  My friends and I had so much fun--we'll definitely be back!",gtEjMgcW74ZcG0zzMctmKg,1,2,5,azEauWOrgkBDEqnCEUy7gg

The Alla Nora was a wonderful combination of eggplant, cheese, and pasta, baked and topped with herbs.

I had expected this to be too cheesy and creamy, but it was just right.  And how can we not top of an Italian meal with a dessert of Cannoli?

Went there last night and I'm sorry to say the food wasn't as good as it should have been.  The Chicken Marsala was OK, nothing special, tasted the same as all the Marsala dishes I order at other Italian restaurants, nothing special to set Nora's version apart. 
 Also ordered the Eggplant Pizza which was terrible, the egg plant was burnt and the pizza crust was un-chewable, sent it back and ordered the Eggplant ala Nora without the Pesto on it.  Again the eggplant was overcooked so it tasted burnt which isn't exactly a treat, and it was just an average dish of spaghetti with sauce and then topped with burnt pieces of eggplant.  
The food isn't fantastic, it is just regular Italian food you could eat anywhere and pay less for.  I don't go to a restaurant because the building is new, that is not what I am paying for, I am paying for a fantastic dinner and I didn't get that.  It was below average but priced above average.  More detail should be given to the quality and preparation of the food.   It wasn't worth my going there because I didn't enjoy myself nor did my companion and we had terrible indigestion for the better part of the evening after dining there.  
There are many Italian restaurants around town that can compete with Nora's and the food is more enjoyable, prepared correctly, and not as costly. 
 I don't understand all these great reviews because I looked at the food coming out of the kitchen (not just what I ordered) and it didn't look like it was anything special.  I just think people are so used to going to Nora's that it becomes a habit and they go not for the food but because they are used to going there.

4695493,2012-10-10,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Nora's is legendary for Las Vegas. Every local tells their friends that this is the spot. I think it is for a few specific reasons. Food quality is always good and the dishes are consistent. Sequence and consistency of service is always on point. it is always busy. Everytime I have went, there is a small wait (not bad) because they are busy turning tables. Their operation is very efficient with scheduling. The price point is very afforadble and of course they are the home team favorite. They are the underdog off the strip. All that contributes to the fierce loyalty they receive from their customers. I would even dare to say they are like the Rao's of Las Vegas. No, they don't have a 3 month wait and their tables aren't owned by certain families and you have to get approval from them to sit there or anything silly like that, but you might want to be prepared for fisticuffs if you say anything negative about this place in certain circles. 

I joke. . .

I checked in and they gave me a comp glass of wine. I made the entire table check in and they gave a comp carafe! Score! Winner! Winner! I think it was also because it was my girls birthday.

I only gave it 4 stars because of the atmosphere. I know they tried a second restaurant and it didn't do as good. I think that was probably because it lost some of its mom and pop charm that the original stores oozes. I too would have some hesitation on doing too many upgrades in order to not disturb an already successful business, but there has to be a happy medium that can be achieved where the design of the space can be more indicative of their food quality. 

The lighting does not have enough highlights or shadows in the room. It is all diffused mid-tones so nothing stands out. There is no contrast on the walls. The ceiling has some ornate feature that I couldn't really make out. I like the pizza/app guy at the front as you walk in and a long bar inviting you to start there, but other than that the chairs and tables and lighting threw me off making me want a cooler atmosphere but it would not deter me from going there time and time again. The vibe was a little ho-hum. What about a little music in the background? Doesn't have to be themed to italian, adult contemporary could work too. I understand music is a big commitment as well. In addition it will also increase the overall ambience of the room and I noticed quite a few people that have most likely been going there for years (perhaps decades). They won't like the higher noise level, but it will most likely increase the length and purchase of the customer visit.

Ok I am rambling. The place is good. Eat there and love it.",7uOxjRC9lVRc8SEjHDHHMw,2,0,4,Oxui4_SErXlRnR-vdVReUw

Was greeted right away and informed us of a 15 minute wait. However, they were able to get seated in 5 minutes, so that was a plus.

The ambiance and decor is classy and charming. The wine room with the ceiling to floor window is their highlight. Wine barrels repurposed for the chandelier lighting over the bar area was clever and unique. The wine menu was made of cork. How appropriate! With all this attention to detail, I was a thrown off by the butcher paper on top of the dining table. I know some Italian restaurants have them and give you crayons ( if you have kids? ) to doodle on, but we didn't and they were kinda in the way. The paper was folded into half and it made the table uneven in parts so I had to move my drink to the more level part of the table. There is a white table cloth underneath it, so it would have been nice to do without the paper overlay. 

Server was very prompt and friendly. Complementary garlic bread came out first. It was soft, had real chopped bits of garlic on it, and buttery. Yum! Was hoping the rest of the meal will just be as good. Ordered the fettuccini alfredo, spaghetti and meatballs, and mozzarella sticks. Mozzarella sticks were safe. The garlic marinara dipping sauce was above average. The fettuccini alfredo was very basic. It needed salt and was swimming in butter. Felt that it should of been creamier. It could of been better. Spaghetti and meatballs was underwhelming. Meatballs were moist, but needed more seasoning. The sauce didn't have a robust flavor that comes from a low and slow cooking methof at all. The red sauce actually looked very plain. No flecks of Italian seasonings or pepper in sight. These 2 dishes are simple, but when done right it can be amazing and these were not. It was simply just ok. 

The atmosphere is upscale casual. Details in decor are thoughtful and chic. Pricing is very reasonable. Would be good for a first date without breaking the bank or to watch a game at the bar without the rowdy crowd of a typical bar.

I get it, you weren't treated like a superstar as you may have been before they moved, but you even acknowledged how great the food was, that the bartender was fantastic and even comped a round for you, but still give them 2 stars - napkins in the rest room weren't folded as they used to be, seriously, stop being such a snob you're at a busy restaurant with absolutely delicious food for very reasonable prices, best restaurant this side of the strip and finding stupid reasons to mark it down.  Sorry, I don't usually react this way, but this restaurant is my new favorite - moved here in January and have looked around for good food at reasonable prices and this is the one.  They get large parties all of the time and are swamped, all of the time.  So some of the waiters stand at the front, any good restaurant does that so they can overlook all of their tables to see if anyone is looking for help.  Apparently, you got a table that was busier than most, your waiter may have been waiting on one of the large tables and hadn't made their way out to you yet.  If you really think this is a two star restaurant then you definitely won't want to go back their again.  But...if you find yourself back there soon then you should update your review because you know their restaurant is so much better than any others in this area.  I know they're busy, I've waited for my food and service as well, but I'm out to dinner so I realize that's always a possibility.  Rather than having a restaurant that treats its customers like cattle and moves them in and out quickly, here you just sit back and enjoy yourself and the atmosphere and stop all of the phony pretentious attitude - missing a certain je ne sais quoi, come on, you're not at an upscale restaurant that charges a hundred + bill for a spaghetti dinner, if you were they'd have waiters tripping over each other!

It's in a crappy little strip mall kind of tucked away where you wouldn't see it unless you were actively looking for it.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  The place was packed, the hostesses/waiters were nice, there was a small jazz band playing, we were seated promptly (we had a reservation - HIGHLY recommend booking one) & the food/drinks...oh god it was all SO great.  Here's a rundown of the food we ordered:

Appetizers:
 - Garlic Bread (1st basket on the house - it's so good, you'll want to pay for another basket but don't be tempted to fill up on bread!) 
 - Arancini (so good!)

Dinner:
 - Alla Nora (This was my order & it was SO good)
 - Pork Tenderloin alla Siciliana  (My friend's dish - it was excellent)
 - Chicken Parmigiana (The birthday girl's dish - also very good)

Desserts: 
 - Oreo Cookie Tartufo (This was good but VERY sweet)
 - Salted Caramel Panna Cotta (**THIS WAS MY FAVORITE***)
 - Tiramisu (Good! I like a little more cookie to cream ratio but very good)

They moved in to the new building last month in September. Their new location is just a block away from the old one, conveniently on W Flamingo Rd & Duneville. The two level restaurant is surrounded with lots of parking spaces! Luckily we don't need to leave because of not being able to park our cars. It happened before at their other location!

The new building has plenty of tables and seats. On the ground level, immediately on the right side, you can find the full liqueur bar with seats, and tables in the same area. From this room there is an entrance to the upstairs dining room (still waiting to be finished, as of last week), and also there is an entrance to the outdoor patio dining area. On the left side they have another dining room. 
They've kept the open kitchen concept, so the restaurant stays very casual.

The menu also stayed the same! 
I'm very pleased to find their lunch specials unchanged, with same prices as before.
I think the complementary garlic bread taste even better, knowing that at the end of your meal you'll be getting the bill, and no surprises!

Our lunch experience was very pleasant.
Our waiter ( sorry, I can't remember his name) from Italy, took his time to talk to us, served our drinks and meals, and made us feel very welcome in the brand new location.
I specifically asked for my sandwich to be prepared, and I got it perfectly right. 
Due to food allergy, my BF also had a special request to skip certain items from the salad. He got his meal absolutely perfect.
Our drinks were refilled by the busboy. Both waiter and busboys were very attentive.

We tried other menu items many times before (of course at the other location), but we are looking forward to coming back to dine here again.

I've been to Pasta Mia quite a few times and well...whenever these decisions come up I'm always rooting for Nora's.

Now maybe it's because I grew up going to places like Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill, but for the most part I've never ""craved"" Italian food for the better part of my life.  Nothing against those two restaurant chains, I've had good family celebrations there, but the food never hooked me.  Well, my opinion of Italian is slowly changing after visiting Nora's repeatedly.

I started out with fettuccine, spaghetti, etc. and all those other dishes that most places serve.  What really won me over was their Melrose Pesto.  I've had pesto before at other places, and there were times were I was gagging it down.  I'd given up on the green sauce, until a coworker brought back leftovers of their Melrose Pesto at Nora's.  I ate it the next day for lunch, and immediately knew that I had to try that on my next visit.  I was able to do just that this week, and here I am anxiously waiting for my next meal there.

Also of note is the skill of the bartenders.  They make some well crafted cocktails, and outside of Downtown Cocktail Room, this is the only other place that I trust to make me an Old Fashioned.  Nora's makes it to my list of repeat eats.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,11,9,5,nJu2SQsPQRIyLkfTMLmQjQ

We made same day reservations and they seated us within 5 minutes even though we were running a little late. When you walk in you're hit by a great smell and the place feels like a happening local food spot.

I go out of my way to find ""normal"" family owned restaurants.  We found Nora's and always impressed with the service and price at this Italian eatery that started many years ago as a pizza joint.  Even on a week night, reservations are recommended.  A typical evening will show you 5-6 different servers all focused on your needs...  One does beverages, one does bread, one takes your order, one does water, another serves your order...  And they communicate very well so you dont even notice that it is someone different each time.  The food there can be good to great.  The portions, generally speaking, are not huge but filling, but they are priced right.  For dinner for two, we plan about $40.

   Our main dishes seemed to take for ever to come out. When they did again half seemed to have been held at the pass under warming lights. They where on the drying side and not as hot as they should have been. I had the Chicken parm, it was very tough and on the edge of drying out. The Breading was soft and tasted like rye bread.. The noodles that came with it
where way to al dente like the where rushing to get food out..  The food was also very lacking in flavor.. I use to love the old school tastes here, its almost as if they went to cans and boxes.
other pastas in out group where the same not cooked enough and lacking a good portion of sauce. so barley covered the noodles. 

   The staff was friendly but not warm. They where moving tables much like any other fancy place in town it become numbers not family. They have definitely lost the good old home feeling which we so liked.. 

   I doubt I will return, have had better food at Olive Garden to be honest compared to this visit..

Congratulations Nora's for stepping into the uppity fancy bland like everyone else's restaurant.",r2wK-bxWTIRTupmbOcrEWg,7,1,2,tBnOlMogL5z4m-0Cz643kg

If there is a wait, hang out at the bar (a friend of mine, Angela, works there and is super awesome) until your table is ready. 

Once you get your bite into ANY of their food, you'll realize that the wait was worth it. Definitely try the Veal Parmigiana with Meat Sauce! The portion was huge!

I've come here multiple times and get pasta every time. Their penne with vodka sauce is delicious and creamy. The pesto is very rich but a whole bowl of it can be too much. Their wild boar perpedelle is also wonderful but sometimes can be on the saltier side. 

My favorites are the pasta all Nora ( basically spaghetti bolognese with eggplant) and their rigatoni special but I sub the tomato sauce with vodka sauce for a creamier richer taste.   

They also offer complimentary garlic bread to go with your meal and the garlic bread is delicious. Sometimes I'm guilty of filling up on that too quickly but thats ok because I'll have leftover pasta for the next day!",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,3,4,5,DlZdtr2da8NaNSbmpkcaDw

It's filled with business men and brunching women so me and my tattooed friend felt a little out of place but that didn't stop us. We had a glass of moscato each, the steak bruschetta (SO AMAZING) and we split a pasta. Our bill came to around $60. 

Our server was a little strange. We asked to change the sauce on our pasta to a vodka sauce and he kind of just said ""well I like it the way it is but I guess whatever you want"". We thought that was weird because we're both servers and we would never say something like that it comes off judgmental and what's it to you?! Then we asked him to split the pasta in two plates if possible and he made us feel we were asking too much. We said if it's too late no worries but if not it would be easier. He comes back and says ""well the kitchen yelled at me but here you go"". Again as servers WE WOULD NEVER SAY THAT. Why would you try to make the guest feel bad especially at a higher end spot like this where you're going to have pickier eaters. Maybe he was having an off day. Me and my friend ended up laughing about it but it was uncomfortable.

Every single pizza that they make, it tastes great, flavorful, nothing to complain.
Their complimentary garlic bread is amazing, do request for cheese on the top for extra, it will make it even better.
But I am not really a big fan of pasta that they give us. Seafood pasta - I am not a big fan of seafood, happened to try that because my girlfriend loves seafood, she said that it was good. 
Gorgonzola & Mushroom pasta (forgot the name sorry) was really unique in flavor, it was really flavorful with interesting tastes. 
Chicken parmagiana - Chicken was really tasty, I don't know if it was not supposed to be crispy for the chicken part, but what threw me off for this pasta is, it is not really flavorful, no tastes into the pasta by itself, it was very plain in my opinion. Tomato sauce was not very special at all, I felt that it tastes like a spaghetti sauce that you maybe able to get at Walmart. I guess I just chose the wrong menu.

We were given a basket of garlic bread while we wait for our order. MM! I am a garlic freak so I was taking the garlic off everyone else's slices since they like it light on garlic. You can also request plain toasted if you don't do garlic. 

The BF had cheese ravioli w/ alfredo- the raviolis are fresh made in house and were very good (I took a bite of course, tee hee) and the sauce was thick and had good flavor. 

Mom had the lasagna- she's been wanted lasagna for weeks and she was very happy with it here. It had little sausage bites in it instead of just meat sauce and cheese. She's a light eater normally, but she tore into that! 

Grandma had spaghetti and meatballs- she liked the meatballs here a lot and they did look quite good. 

I had the chicken mt etna- it wasn't bad, but I think I ordered the wrong thing. The individual components were good- chicken with peppers and cheese and balsamic together was nice and chicken was juicy, the onion strings were crisp and the seasoning was great, roasted potatoes good. There was angel hair that was crisp to like a uncooked top ramen consistency which is a bit odd and between all these layers was a bit much. I ate the onion strings and some of the chicken. I can see some people really liking this type of stuff (I ordered it based on the Yelp summary on top of it being mentioned in reviews), but to me it's the classics here that are standouts and can't steer wrong with a solid plate of pasta.

I ended up asking for a side of linguini with vodka sauce. I'm so glad I did because it really changed my dinner. The sauce was superb and close to the vodka sauce at my favorite Italian place in LA I've been going to since I was a kid. I got my bread and wiped that bowl clean! The BF tried some and he is now saying we are going back for some of that! 

The quality, taste,portion to price ratio is fantastic here. Most pasta dishes were around $9-11 with specialties in the $14-20 range with a few meat specialties from $22-30. That's like Olive Garden prices and leaps better. Very reasonable compared to a lot of other Italian places in town. $60 +tip for 5 dishes and drinks is not bad at all! 

Our server was very attentive, personable and polite throughout. He kept checking in without being obtrusive to dinner conversation, filled drinks half full, had good pacing for boxes and check that we didn't wait for any need. We ended up chatting with him and he's actually a busser who they sometimes let serve. Casey should be a server as that's some seriously great service!  Way better than some of these seasoned jokes around town. He gave me a tiramisu even to top off the  birthday dinner (for those curious- pretty good, heavy on the coffee notes so a dessert for those who love their coffee). 

Despite what I ordered originally, this place is great for the classics and service is great. Definitely coming back and sad I haven't tried it sooner.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,6,4,gTGustutBnqwn2-wZj6sng

Only ordered a glass of malbec wine $10 and a house salad $8 and Arancini $8. Food came out quickly, literally 5 minutes. Yet I didn't receive my complimentary garlic bread for a bit, asked a waiter about it and then got it. Salad was very good and fresh tasting, not even a huge fan of tomatoes yet they were very ripe. The House Italian dressing was very tasty. The garlic bread was definitely just what I wanted, very buttery and tons of garlic on it. Can never have too much garlic in my opinion. The Arancini was flavorful but I do think maybe it could have  been a little warmer/hotter, and possibly deep fried just a touch more so that when they are laid over the tomato sauce they wont get soggy as quickly. They were slightly breaking open due to them absorbing the tomato sauce liquid. The server suggested a Malbec wine, it was indeed a very good choice.

My dad ordered a veal chop that was butterflied with the bone on.  THIS THING WAS HUGE!!!!!!!!!!! I ordered a linguinni in pesto cream sauce with shrimp and pine nuts. It was a little rich for me but was incredibly delicious.  We did try a tiramisu for dessert and I'm very picky about that particular dessert but it was home made and I think most people would really like it, I didn't care for it though.  

My overall experience is DEFINITELY 5 stars and I'd go back any time.  It's a GREAT place for some good upscale home made italian food.  Just don't forget your reservations cause they are very busy.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,1,1,5,DJzS01fHSbdtWvv_eDTilg

I felt like their garlic bread could have been frozen before because I could probably find bread like that in the grocery store. From all the great reviews, I was expecting freshly made bread with a rustic outer layer that you see all the top Italian restaurants have. I ordered the crazy fettucini that had everything in it. A little too much going on there. The pizza was good. Nothing will beat the East Coast. It was super dead and I was expecting the restaurant to be super busy! If you sign up for their e-club you get a free appetizer and dessert which is awesome! Our server looked like she was having a bad day on top of this. Maybe it was just bad timing.

5078236,2016-03-10,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Overall, my experience at Nora's was solid, and I plan on returning. A little detail, and I'll start with weaknesses because they were (in my opinion) not deal breakers: 
-The hostess who sat us was kind of a brat. I don't want to say she was rude, because she wasn't necessarily rude.. They were super busy, so maybe she was just in the midst of something frustrating. Anyway, her attitude just came off as bratty. 
-I thought our waiter was going to be the same because of how he answered a question I asked regarding a menu item, but he ended up warming up to us (once the rush died down).
-The layout is NOT ideal. It is crowded and busy. We ended up getting completely blocked in because they had to put a couple tables together to seat a large group, so that was a little frustrating for us and for our waiter. (They are moving soon, so I am assuming this won't be an issue once they move.)
-It took a while for our food (~40 minutes for baked rigatoni and chicken parm). As with all of the above, I figure this was because of how busy they were (we were there at 8 pm on a Sunday, btw--we were glad we made a reservation!)
Like I mentioned, none of those are deal breakers for me, but they are the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 this time around. 
Now for the good.... THE FOOD OMG. The garlic bread was awesome. The chicken parm was good my husband loved it, I'm just not a big fan, as the chicken doesn't typically have a lot of flavor and I'm weird like that). The baked rigatoni was fantastic. The meat sauce was just like I remember growing up with Italian family--you could tell that it was cooked right, because it had that brownish color that a good meat sauce gets. The ricotta on top of the rigatoni was AMAZING. Just good, good food. 
We are excited to return once they move locations (honestly, maybe even before that).",3Hfw-nd6WQ3VB7wKiyjlkg,0,0,4,2jtqJhcdOBDgXmvHkgcM0g

Called midweek for a same day reservation. They said 9pm was the earliest. We showed up 30 minutes early and they sat us promptly. 5 star 

Didn't care for my table that much. It was a small 2 person table against the wall crammed next to a stage. But we had a table, and the place was packed.. walk ins were being told long wait times, so I cant complain. In the future I might request not having that table again.  4 star

Wine list was solid and sure to have something for most people though I wish it had a few more options in the 100-200 range. 4 star

After I ordered a bottle of amarone it arrived with a decanter and the waiter proceeded to open it. What shocked me was the battery powered aerator that was used during the pour from the bottle to the decanter. Our first course was tomato bruschetta. The nice thing about mid age armarone for me is the way it opens up over the meal. The acidity would have paired perfect with the ripe tomatoes, and later on, after it sat for 30 minutes in the decanter, it would have opened up perfectly for the main courses. I didn't get to enjoy that experience. What I got was a wine that tasted like it had just been through a blender. 2 star

Tomato Bruschetta was decent, but I wasn't a huge fan. The baguette was fresh but had been soaked in way to much olive oil. The tomatoes were cut too large to eat on a baguette without falling off and I never got the flavor of garlic, basil and pepper. Not to say there wasn't any but for me it was bland. On the positive side my girlfriend highly enjoyed the generous portion of tomatoes, almost twice as much as you would normally see on this type of dish. 3 star

For the main I ordered the crazy alfredo and it was amazing. Packed with mushrooms and peppers.. pasta just right... topped with awesome shrimp... the sauce was perfect! This dish is divine. 5 star

She had the spaghetti and meat balls. The meatballs were enormous and very good but the noodles were served soft. In an Italian restaurant, we were expecting al dente. It wasn't spaghetti either, it was more like spaghettini. Overall a decent dish but I had higher hopes. 4 star

We pre ordered the souffle for dessert. NOM NOM 5 star

It was so good it has inspired me to create my own yelp award. I will call it the Nom Nom award and reserve it for dishes that are so good they make you slow down when eating... enjoying the moment while making cavman like noises with your partner in between the omg this is so freaking good stares you share. Yea, its that good.This dessert is 5 star plus and wins my first nom nom award.

Service was excellent. Staff was busy but not stressed out, everyone was happy. With a full house and a line almost out the door this is a rare combination. Our waiter was prompt, friendly and serviced the table properly. Our wine and water stayed full and the table was kept neat by the busser. 5 star

First of all, make reservations. This place is a madhouse on a weekend night. 
Secondly, prepare to wait awhile if you don't. 

We were starving after driving and waiting for an hour. So you'd think everything would be amazing. Eh, it wasn't. 

The service was bad. Not horrible, just way under good. We could barely get her to stay at the table without her wanting to walk away when we'd tell her one thing. So that was sad. 

We had --

The risotto balls. I don't know the actual name. They were...meh. Really cheesy. But the marinara was delightful. 
Spaghetti with meatballs and marinara. Meh. The marinara was delightful...hahahahaha. 
The crazy Alfredo. Meh. I don't know. Nothing about it stood out. 

I will say this -- the pasta itself is super good. Like, excellent good. 

We also had some really good Malbec. For the full bodied, non sweet wine lovers, try Amancaya.

Rigatoni was highly recommended (over the lasagna) by the server. Pasta was chewy and dry due to the scant amount of sauce. As much as I love garlic, it's way over used...to the point of drowning out the flavors of any other spices or the meat. The ricotta survived the garlic tsunami only because it was in volcanic-sized dollops.

At $21 a person, for pasta and a beverage (no cocktails), I fail to understand the rave reviews. There are numerous and far better options in Vegas, several in that vicinity.",NPmKodK-FMd7jsql8E9Tbg,0,0,2,O0a7UEpHHdAYMbJZ21ZBpw

Jessika was our server and she gave great service. She didn't make us feel rushed when we took forever and a day to look at the menu. She was very informative when explaining the menu and was very friendly despite how busy it was and how busy she clearly was. 
As a starter we ordered the pork belly. It was tender and melted in our mouths, however the edges were a bit burnt so it would have been perfect without the burnt parts.
As the entree I ordered the crazy alfredo but I asked to substituted the pasta for angel hair pasta. My dish was delicious, the only thing I wished was that I rememebered to ask to have it without the jalapenos. The shrimp portion was generous and I enjoyed the creamy sauce.
My husband ordered the rib eye. The first parts of the steak was cooked medium well rather than the medium rare he had asked for, but as he continued down the rib eye it was cooked more toward his liking. His rib eye came with truffle fries, which were mostly eaten by me, haha.
We had to get our food taken to go. Jessika did mention that the portions were fairly large, but when she said that I didn't know she meant it was enough for 3 meals. No complaints though. It means no cooking the day after which is always a plus for me.
For dessert we had the chocolate lava cake with some kind of pistachio sauce. The center was perfectly gooey and went deliciously with the sauce.
The reason why I put 4 stars for this experience however is because the section we were put in was with large parties and they were really loud. I felt like I was yelling so my husband can hear me talking.

Not only is it the best Italian I have had, it's also one of the best priced meals that I have enjoyed.

Atmosphere is nice enough for date night, but not too formal, where you have to get dressy or feel like you are going to break the bank.  Service was very friendly, and attentive...couldn't have asked for a better server.  Went with a good bottle of wine that the waitress recommended as well...win!

On to the food!

Garlic bread is good...very garlicy garlic bread lol.  It was good, but not mind blowing like some have said.  But good garlic bread nonetheless.

Started with the shrimp scampi...very good...wish the shrimp was seared a little more, but very tender and  the sauce was yum.  This was more expensive than both of the entress lol.

We went with the lasagna and the ziti...not only were they the best I have had, but they were both about $10 a plate!  Not even Olive Garden is that cheap...and OG is like Mcdonalds compared to the taste explosion that is Noras.  I don't know what they put in this food at Noras, but I am still thinking about it days later.  Portions were generous as well.  

And lastly, tiramisu for dessert....very good.  Seems like you can't go wrong here.

I am actually looking forward to visiting again...I'd like to try some more of their seafood options!

For starters we had an antipasto and minestrone soup.  Both were delicious.

For my entre I had veal scallopini, which was tender and delicious.  I love garlic and Nora's knows how to use it properly, not overwhelming, but definitely there to enhance the true flavors of the veal.

The ambiance and friendliness of the servers made the experience totally enjoyable.

Friday night in Vegas, it was my mom's choice for dinner and she is a Vegas local, so of course she didn't want to hit the strip, or have a buffet, or deal with the traffic and valet at the hotels.  

Nora's Cuisine is a mid-size local Italian restaurant, that appears to be popular.  They had live entertainment, which I found to be ok, but definitely geared towards an older crowd (and hell I'm older now, and it was still too old for me!)  The portions are large but I found the prices to actually be on the high side.  Let me explain:  Italian food usually is larger portions and usually is on the cheaper side, excluding Northern  Region Italian and some pricier ingredients, think Marscapone Cheese, Veal and Fresh Seafood.  I ordered a fairly basic salad and spaghetti & meatballs, both really standard with basic and cheaper ingredients.  

While both dishes were large, the salad was again, basic, could have used more mozzarella and other than a few olives, tomatoes and onion, was overpriced at $7.95.  Highlight of salad was the homemade ranch dressing which was delicious.  The spaghetti & meatballs was again large, but the 2 meatballs were more on the smaller to medium size and you were really left with quite a bit of pasta.  I did not detect any veal in the meatballs, and the seasoning/ingredients was not quite there, as they were not soft and tender and appeared to be missing the requisite amount of cheese.

I found service to be lacking, I had to ask twice for a simple refill of iced tea and I also had to ask for parmesan cheese as a topping for my spaghetti & meatballs.  The waiter seemed stressed (too busy perhaps) but that's not exactly my problem, is it?  

Side note:  My mother had made reservations, we were on time, but we still had to wait about 15 minutes.

Overall I would recommend Nora's, but I don't know that I would make it a for sure Italian destination when I'm back in Vegas.",WGBpuJBQ1FqRTxM8J5BBHg,26,26,3,8u16nZ8OeaSkX9EwzWjyaQ

- Prices were very reasonable in the $15-20 range. Definitely a Vegas Italian restaurant locals can go to on a weekly basis.
- Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and had a great bite to it. 
- Calamari was really good. Portion size was larger than I expected for a seafood appetizer.
- Plenty of parking out front. However, this place gets packed quickly.
- Make a Reservation. Expect to wait 15 minutes after your reservation on busy nights.

Environment: The inside is beautiful. After moving into their new location roughly a year ago, the interior finally lives up to the standard of the food which they serve. The restaurant is bright and open with an abundance of seating ranging from indoors, to a patio, to private rooms, and to a full-service bar. Each section of the restaurant has its own drawing points so I am never disappointed where I am sat. Interestingly, my favorite place to dine is up at the bar. It is clean and spacious and allows for easier conversation if you are on a date, however when I come with groups I opt for a table. Additionally, the open kitchen is nice and adds some ambience. Finally, there have been a couple times where I have come in during the evening sand there has been a live band which adds yet another classy touch to the restaurant.

Food: If the restaurant itself wasn't so nice, it's the food which has me coming back every time. Everything I have tried here has been excellent. I have tried various appetizers such as the grilled octopus, fried calamari, arancini, and the clams and each one has been delicious. For the main dish, I never miss ordering the rib-eye steak and the fettuccini carbonara. The steak is always cooked beautifully with tons of flavor, and it pairs perfectly with the creamy pasta. Additionally, their garlic bread Is phenomenal. They serve it complimentary and are very good about grabbing you more once you finish yours. We usually go through about 5 baskets during and before dinner and always take some home too because it is just that good! Their cocktails are nice too, and I have tried several them but I always end coming back to their house sangria which is the best I have ever had. It tastes so fresh and fruity without sacrificing being too sweet.

Service: Service is up to par with a classy restaurant as I mentioned before the waiters are always eager to get you anything you need without being invasive. Additionally, when I have sat at the bar the bartenders are very personable and helpful with recommending drinks and dishes and making conversation throughout the meal.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone I have recommended has loved it just as much as I had, so I will be back again and again and again!",5fxjUT0sLg9ueMAYtn2PZw,1,0,5,1YWg7199oI4Vh9BA4Suvow

Did I mention we are starving? The lady friend left about two hours ago for some errands. What that really means is a full manicure and pedicure.

So the gal pal finally gets home and we head out for some good eats. We waste about a gallon of gas before be finally decide on Nora's Cuisine. I've never eaten here before but I've heard good things about it.

We roll up around 8:15 and the place is pretty full. The hostess nicely asks if we have reservations. We decline. We were then told the wait would be about 10 minutes or so. After a brief glance around the room, I noticed a lot of empty tables, Hmmmm...? 10 minute wait?

We finally get seated and the hostess apologizes for the wait. She explains that the dish washer is not working at full steam (insert joke here) and the wait was more for the clean dishes than an available server. I am always willing to wait for clean dishes!

The menu looked decent for an Italian place. It has all the usual Italian fare one could ask for. You can pull up the full menu on their website. We finally decided to start with the Calamari Fritti and a simple Caprese Salad. My two friends both ordered the Shrimp Scampi and I decided to go for their best seller, the ""Crazy"" Alfredo.

The Caprese Salad came out first. We just wanted some greens, tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese drizzled with a light olive oil. We got exactly that. It was simple yet very tasty. Next out was the complimentary garlic bread. We started gnawing on the bread when the Calamari came out. I'm so glad we squeezed the lemon wedges over the golden crispy fried calamari because, at least now it had some taste! Ouch! The side sauce that came with it was pretty bland as well.

Out came the main dishes. The Shrimp Scampi looked pretty good. My dish looked awesome as well. How can you go wrong with the best seller? Well... To be honest I didnt read the whole description of the dish. 

""Crazy"" Alfredo - This best-seller features the classic fettucine Alfredo piled with chicken, sausage, jumbo shrimp... (Honestly. I stopped reading here. I should of read on.) ...porcini mushrooms, domestic mushrooms, roasted bell peppers, sun-dried tomatoes and jalapenos.

JALAPENOS? Yes. You read that right. Now dont get me wrong. I love japapenos on my nachos or mexican food... But in my Alfredo? To be honest, it was too much. I picked them all out and it really did look like someone took a huge handful and tossed it in. Maybe I'm missing the 'gourmet taste' of it or whatever, but I can definitely do without it.

The dessert selection didnt look too exciting so we decided to pass on it. Our final bill came out to around $70 before tip. Overall just an ""A-OK"" meal. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish. Would I eat here again? Sure. I'd give it another shot. Next time I'd try the pizza or another large salad.",0ObIfSgndeeR_kGlo1S7Ww,2,2,3,VkONK4io2dTlZlZfrLrb4g

We got calamari which was tender and crisp.  I got gnocchi in Alfredo sauce which was creamy and absolutely fabulous.  We also got the rib eye sandwich with gorgonzola topped with onion strings and homemade potato chips on the side plus a basket of fries.  It had huge chunks of meat and the rich and tangy flavor of the gorgonzola complements the meat.  For everything we got, I only paid less than $40!

The service was good.  Remember to check-in so you can get a free glass of wine.  The free garlic bread is great.  You can definitely taste the garlic which I love.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,12,6,4,FqTObd3zCZNHwej86SWc2A

Great Italian food and drinks, with very generous portions. The lady and I always tend to order appetizers along with our entrees and we've never been able to leave without a takeout box. Nice classic drinks too, especially their Negronis and Old Fashioned(s). 

I've liked most items I've had here food wise, namely: the rib eye, salmon, branzino and the wild boar ragu pappardelle. 

I highly recommended calling for reservations/waits for parties greater than two during dinner time.

The new location (just a few blocks away) is a more modern, trendy type place.  Our first visit to the new location was disappointing.  The noise level was just awful.  It was impossible to carry on a conversation.  They have since added things to muffle the noise and it's much better.  I think they still need to work on that, but it's better.
As for the food.....Back in 2005 I tried Chicken Erbe Fini....(not sure of the spelling).  It's chicken, cooked in a ton of garlic and it was served in a bowl with their spaghetti.  I'm not a huge fan of chicken, but this was delicious.  At some point it was taken off the menu and I was now going to have to find something else to eat.  The server told me that I could still order it, the chef would still make it.  
Last night we had dinner there with family and when I ordered my Chicken, the server said....ahhh, you must have been coming here for a while......it's been off the menu for at least 4 years.....not to worry.....we will still make it for you...and I was a happy diner!!!
Thinking back over the years, whenever we have out of town company, we ALWAYS take them to Nora's.....and some of our friends ask if we can go there again when they come for another visit.  I can also say that of all the different people and food choices, we have NEVER had a bad meal.  
I do have one little issue.  We had dinner there last night.  We always order the small house salad, no onions to share.  The lettuce last night tasted and even looked different.  It was much thicker and had a little different taste than the usual Romaine lettuce.  Our server checked and they said it was the same.....I don't know about that.

As an Italian who's lived in Vegas for 10+ years and has close family members living in Italy, I'm embarrassed and angry at myself for not trying this place years ago.

I was skeptical when I saw it was situated in a small space in a dingy strip mall, but my concerns were squashed when I walked in and saw how busy it was on a weekday night. In fact, I highly recommend making a reservation if you're the impatient type who doesn't like to wait (especially since their waiting area is extremely small).

The starters are all excellent with the Calamari Fritti, Antipasto Salad, and Steak & Arugula Bruschetta being my favorites. The entrees range from the Italian classics to the Crazy Alfredo, which is easily one of their most popular dishes. It features fettucine Alfredo filled with chicken, sausage, jumbo shrimp, porcini mushrooms, domestic mushrooms, roasted bell peppers, sun-dried tomatoes and jalapeños. 

The prices at Nora's are also more than reasonable, especially for the ""basic"" pasta items (cannelloni $9.95, lasagna $10.50, rigatoni $12.95, fettucine carbonara $12.95, fettucine Alfredo $10.50, pasta primavera $10.50, etc). 

Whatever you decide to order, the food is exceptional and it's just as good or better than many of the Italian restaurants on the Strip. Nora's location and building may not live up to your standards, but the quality of the food will make you forget all about it.",vJ9UB9QpSbSkvTZnS-dsyQ,0,0,5,GBzG4ObZV3Cotbj29hw1wA

5349144,2015-10-24,2,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"Nora's been a favorite place for Italian food for a lot of my friends and even my manager. The first time I had Nora's, I was not impressed but fast forward about two years after my first visit, I gave Nora's another try. I'm glad I gave Nora's another try because I've enjoyed every visit thereafter. 

There will always be a wait at Nora's. Always. I would suggest for you to make reservations if you know you want to go and have dinner there. Sometimes, if they are backed up and running late.. you will still have to wait about 10-20 minutes even if you have a reservation. 

The food is really good depending on what you order. Their pastas are amazing. I always order a pasta with arribiata sauce, al dente pasta, and extra spicy. I love how they put a lot of garlic flavor into it and they give you a good portion. I always have enough to bring home for lunch the next day. The one thing that I've tried and absolutely do not like is their chicken, which is what caused me to not go to Nora's after my first visit. I had ordered a chicken parm dish and it just did not speak to me. Therefore, it doesn't matter if you get a chicken parm or if you add chicken to your pasta (I tried that too). Their chicken is just not good. Their chicken is pretty hard and dry..very very dry. Even when I have it in my pasta with a sauce, it is still dry. 

Nora's also gives you the first basket of their garlic bread for free. Complimentary on them. It's really really good. It's usually toasted nicely with tons of garlic and butter on it. It's so delicious. We tend to gobble that basket up!

As for the service, it seems pretty average to me, especially when they get busy. 

Overall, definitely worth a try, worth a visit...worth several visits. It's also great for families and friends to dine together!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,4,3,4,zMokLI7sTz24GY94nyQ3vg

After only waiting for a few minutes, we were taken to our table and enjoyed some fresh Italian bread and olive oil. Our server was ridiculously attentive and really made us feel special and well taken care of throughout the night. His recommendations for the food and wine were on point, with every dish being freshly prepared and bursting with flavor. I will say that the Crazy Alfredo was great, but really lacking in the shrimp department (only ?!?).

At the end of it all, we had 4 glasses of wine, an appetizer, two main dishes, and two desserts (sorry, I do not remember all the names). The best part? It all came to $100 (not including tip).

Items we ordered were:
-Sangria was good but not memorable. (Awesome that you get a free sangria with yelp check in).
-Complimentary garlic bread was soooooo goooood!! Hot fresh crispy yet soft bread lightly buttered and seasoned with fresh bits of garlic. Very addicting.
-Caesar salad was good but I've had better. Greens were bright green and crisp. Fresh baked homemade croutons as well as pieces of garlic bread. Dressing wasn't too heavy on salad. Just tossed perfect.
-Calamari was okay to me but the sauce it was accompanied with was good. 
-Cheese ravioli with vodka sauce. Generous portioned Raviolis were nice and fluffy. Tender when cut. Vodka sauce was full of flavor.
-meatballs were an option to add to your pasta dish or as a side. They were delicious and tender as well. 
-Oreo Tartufo as dessert. It was pretty much an Oreo ice cream chocolate truffle ball. Was a little hard to cut into as first. Might want to wait till it melts a bit more. It was alright, nothing spectacular.

As far as service goes, it was excellent!! Our server had a smile on his face from start to finish of service and was very friendly. All staff seemed friendly, even a couple of the chefs gave us a warm smile on the way out.

Little events were off throughout the dinner, but the food was good enough to overlook them. A wine/cocktail menu was not presented until I asked. A talk with Robyn L. a while ago had me searching for the Pilgrim's Passion. Ordered that for my friend and I got the Berry Explosive. Both were amazing and worth the $9. It took some time for them to come to the table. I wouldn't have noticed if the waitress didn't come to apologize, so that was nice.

The garlic bread came out to tide us over. Surprising that the basket had about ten pieces in it. All were heavy on the garlic. I could smell it when brushing teeth later that night. Oh baby, does that turn you on? They ran the gambit in texture though. Some were burnt, some crunchy, while others were soft and drenched in butter. Most were edible and enjoyable. Dinner is more fun when playing roulette with free items. 

At least there was no losing in dinner. I had ordered the Alla Nora and it was a bountiful feast.

Not to be a nit picker but my food wasn't up to par so I might as well complain about the dirty with sauce table cloth as well. Otherwise the restaurant itself was nice. Lots of room, it really filled up the longer we were there. Our waitress was average, she helped with questions but otherwise wasn't very attentive.

We were given some small pieces of complimentary garlic bread to start, it was average, nothing special about it. I'm a big fan of Arncini, so we ordered a plate to start. Ick! I ate one and didn't even want to finish that one. It had good crunch but the taste of the inside was not appealing, I make Arincini at home and have had it many other places and this was the worst I have ever had. We didn't even finish them or the bread and my husband is a bread fiend.

On of the menu items I saw had gotten lots of good reviews and states its a best selling dish was the Crazy Alfredo, I love Alfredo and wanted shrimp but also wanted to try something different so I ordered it. The dish was piled high but it didn't seem like Alfredo sauce, it was more like they threw Parmesan or mozzarella in the pasta, it actually started to harden as it cooled. The spice of the jalapeño wasn't over powering which was nice. Disappointed there were only 2 shrimp in the dish. Tons of sausage. The fettuccine tasted like box pasta. My friend got the same dish and was disappointed as well. Her husband was the only one that was pleased with his dish which was the Chicken Mount Etna. My husband got the Gnocchi with Vodka Sauce and added Chicken. OMG! I felt so bad for my husband, his gnocchi tasted like wet balls of wall paper paste, no taste, and the sauce did nothing to help. We've had gnocchi before also and these were very heavy and gross.

There's a ton in his dish and it's worth every penny. 

The breadsticks here are also very very good. It's made with real garlic and really hits the spot. The first basket is on the house! But I always order another basket :)

I opted for the gnocchi with vodka sauce after learning that crazy Alfredo is only offered at dinner.  Also. I been seeing gnocchi at at the world market and contemplated making it at the crib.  Because it primarily consists of potato and basically a dumpling, it is rather filling and pretty heavy.  The vodka sauce was excellent and the good came out in a flash.  Let's not forget about the fresh garlic bread....whoa!  My garlic gauge is enhanced so I love how they load it with butter, seasonings and garlic, and lots of it!

I found out they moved into a nice larger building so I was anxious to go, so I talked my family to take me for my birthday. I had heard they were quite busy and should make reservations, so we did. And good thing cuz they were very busy. We got our table and it was very loud in there. Could not hear any of our conversations we practically had to yell at each other. 

The service was fine and it was nice they gave me a free dessert for my bday. But the food, was just average. I got a steak. Wasn't bad but nothing to rave about. My husband got the chicken marsala. It was kinda strange that everyone else's meal was pretty good size but his chicken was small and dinky. And the side of pasta was as bland as could be. This is an Italian place. Shouldn't it be amazing.? My husband did love his old fashion though.

While service was a bit hit-or-miss at times, the quality of the food more than made up for it, and when the staff made mistakes, management was always quick to offer compensation. We always felt we were going to a friend's house for lunch or dinner. And there was a definite Vegas ""vibe"" to the place; one could imagine the old-time mobsters having a meeting at the back table.

Alas, the new restaurant looks and feels like a chain restaurant. The decor and atmosphere are similar to any Macaroni Grill. With the exception of the music (jazz standards, very nice), the restaurant could be picked up and directly transported to any large city in North America. The mobsters, I'm sure, have found another Vegas haunt. The romance is gone.

The food remains pretty much the same, if you're lucky enough to have it delivered before it gets cold! The service is dreadful. My first experience was take-out. The pizza was brought out first, and the hostess informed me that she was waiting on the chicken. After about five minutes, I asked if the pizza shouldn't be held someplace to keep it warm while waiting for the chicken - ""oh, we have no place to do that."" REALLY? The pizza was cold before I got back to the car! And although apologies were offered by the front staff, but no mention of any compensation.

We went for lunch, and experienced more bad service: We had to hail a waiter to get water and drinks after 15 minutes of not being acknowledged. We ordered pizza and chicken again, and a regular house salad. The pizza was lukewarm. I guess the same thing happened that occurred with our take-out order. The server never even apologized for his lack of attention (nor did anyone else). And the bill came to eighty bucks for pizza, chicken piccata, salad and two glasses of wine ((which we had to order by intuition; a wine menu was never proffered).

It's a damned shame to see a cozy, friendly familiar place turn into a cookie cutter chain restaurant. I'm afraid we'll be looking for a new Italian ""joint.""",UL4bxNpzHk5V-xDrF7H5fA,1,0,2,tMQJXY2B-OtcXH0srQ5FzQ

The ratios for my dish was incredible and left me feeling beyond satisfied. Additionally, I might add that my girlfriend's dish had exquisitely fried and crispy mushrooms to compliment.
Pro tip: don't build your own pasta unless you're willing to spend a lot more. You will get more off the original dishes if you do substitutions. 3 pieces of shrimp (literally 3 pieces only) is a $5 charge and 5 pieces is an $8 charge. To me, that's absurd for an establishment that's not necessarily upscale.

Went on Sunday 12-20-15 at 6:30 with my yelpy friend Jamie P.  She was nice enough to make us reservations and the place was packed so I'm glad she did that! We had 4 adults and a baby in our party and the hostess threw a hissy fit because she said the reservation is for four....not five people...so we'll have to wait.  I was thinking can't we just pull up a high chair to the table?  The answer was no.  Ended up being seated about 7PM and no food on the table until about 7:40 but that's the *only* puny little complaint that I have.  

$95.83 got us a small 4 Staggioni pizza, a margarita, a whiskey sidecar cocktail, an appetizer of clams, a house salad, a chocolate cake, two coffees, and a ginger ale.  The table and napkins are real white linen and the table is covered by white paper.  Crayola crayons were brought out for my boy which I thought was cool (none of that cheap-o Rose Art shit).  

I originally wanted the Branzino but they were out :( *sad violin noises* 

The clams were hot and fresh and the menu says it comes with 12 but I swear there were at least 2 dozen in my bowl.  The menu says  ""12 Manila Clams, Evo, Lemon Parsly"" and I'm pretty sure that's not how you spell parsley and shouldn't it be ""EVOO"" if they are trying to say extra virgin olive oil?  Whatevs....it was $14.95 and the clams were hot and sweet and wonderful.  I only had one that was sandy but the rest were awesome.  

The 4 Staggioni pizza had pizza sauce, sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mozzarella, and olives.  The small was $15.45 and worth every penny.  I loved the puffy crust and I'm enjoying the leftovers today as we speak.  

The chocolate cake must be ordered ahead of time (at the time you order your entrees) and was a steal for $6.50.  It is a rich, soft centered, Valrohna chocolate cake adorned by a vanilla sauce and pistachios.  Valrohna is a type of rich chocolate heavy on the cocoa side.  I absolutely loved this.  It's making my mouth water right now just thinking about it! 

With Olive Garden being the only other italian food I've experienced, this place blows it out of the water.  It would be a great place to take a date or family members that come here from out of town.  I liked it a lot!  And I liked the good company even more. *wink wink*",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,12,10,4,m7Am45_camZyzIkxRwC19g

It doesn't change the fact that the food is crap but their customers will rave about how great it is. 

I think it must be the same with your place. You have loyal customers, for whatever reason, but don't even begin to pretend that you're dishing out good Italian food, because you're not. Well, not to me you aren't. I'm comparing it to Italian food that I know to be good. I've been all over the world - including Italy - and I know the difference. Your food is no different to what you would get out of a Stouffers box or at an Olive Garden.",6VtxTwQ1AQmPy_F1U9LWIg,2,0,1,ot8a2sqaombd-GQnRTqE-A

Complimentary garlic bread - Really good, 4/5

Crazy Alfredo - $23 - solid 4/5

Bruschetta - Average, 3/5
Shrimp appetizer - average, 3/5
Caesar salad - pretty good, 3.5/5

The energy gave of very welcoming and family oriented. We sat outside and watched numerous patrons and families keep coming in (even though it was Memorial Day and were closed an hour early) Noras seemed to keep welcoming all! My only reason for 4 stars was the service overall was slower than expected however we will return and keep the hype alive!,3fb9-jtZT9_g02W5f9RJDA,0,0,4,Fgi96Kr_JwtrnJ2E1yY5VQ

The tables are covered in white linens and butcher paper which gives it a formal feel without the pretentiousness and cost. Whenever my parents are in town we head straight to Nora's to appease my Italian loving dad.

The Italian food is hearty and delicious. Every table starts with a basket of crunchy garlic bread. The pieces are covered in garlic and a good size, so you won't feel so guilty about eating 10 of them. You want to order an appetizer, either the mozzarella caprese or an antipasto, trust me they are both seasoned perfectly and hit the spot. My current favorite pasta is the Rigatoni Special, I mean it has meatballs AND sausage, you can't go wrong! I will say that I have had the lasagna and I'm not such a fan. It wasn't really special and I'm pretty sure mine is better. My husband always gets the Pork Tenderloin alla Siciliana. The pork is melt in your mouth tender and the side of potatoes really puts it over the top. My dad is a sucker for their giant bone in Rib-eye, seriously it's giant so bring your appetite. The pizza is just as good as the pasta, but I always end up ordering pasta. Oh and be sure to pre-order the chocolate cake, you want the chocolate cake! It's so melt-ey and molten-ey and lava-ey, all the -ey!

Ordered the Crazy Alfredo
Caesar Salad
Calamari

Everything was pretty good, but honestly nothing really stood out to me as craveworthy.

Crazy Alfredo was pretty good, a TON of meat. Pretty rare that you run out of noodles before protein, but I was left with a pile of chicken and sausage after all the noodles were gone. Flavor of the sauce was decent, tasted like a bell pepper alfredo sauce.

Caesar salad was a bit disappointing. Not bad by any means, but it is pretty hard to mess up a caesar salad. The dressing was just a bit too creamy for my liking and didnt have that tangy salty flavor Im used to with caesar salads. Could use some shaved parmesan too.

Calamari was just good, pretty basic dish. The sauce was interesting though.

The main downsides were an hour wait for pickup even though the restaurant wasnt exactly packed, there were plenty of open tables. Price was a bit steep, came out to $50 for an entree appetizer and salad. Also I specifically asked if the meal comes with garlic bread and was told yes, and they forgot to put it in the bag.. pasta without garlic bread is just sad..

Probably wont come back here for a while to be honest, just nothing to write home about, and so many other places with better tasting food in Vegas for much cheaper.",2r0CnsEbhBo75KYoVF8eGA,0,0,3,YEnPLpuNKK0uF89btl45Vg

We sat outside and ordered drinks and food. Food came out and drinks came out before our utensils. We had to ask 3 different people until we finally saw our server to let her know about the utensils. We also ordered 2 bottles of wine and the server just dropped them off without opening them. She walked away expecting us to have our own wine opener. Manager excused it as her being new. I guess common sense isn't part of the job application. Came here to celebrate but left very underwhelmed. The old Nora's has way better service than this place.

We tried to make a reservation but the lady on the phone was unintelligible so we just went and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. We sat in the ""kitchen area"" which is not a great place to sit due to all the servers constantly going back and forth. 

Once seated expect the server to make a concerted effort to get the table to get a salad (which are $11.50 to $17.90). The unaware diner might get the sense that they come with dinner as the servers never really let on that it doesn't and you have to pay for it. 

Of the 3 dishes our group got I'd only recommend the Fettuccine Carbonara which is alfredo sauce, ham & prosciutto. If you're on a diet you may want to steer clear though as there is some serious fat in this dish....we took the remainder to go and after being refrigerated the fats all solidified into a hard pasta-brick. Hmmmm.

The Alla Nora is over-rated. For one thing the spaghetti was overcooked so bad that I could never twirl it into a forkful...the spaghettis would simply break so I had all these tiny sections I had to fork up.

The food is to die for. There really aren't even words to describe how perfect this restaurant it. The quality, for the portions for the price cannot be beat and you'll always go home with leftovers that still manage to taste as delicious as they did hot out of the oven! 

The wait staff was professional, knowledgable and attentive and the food came out hot, well-plated and absolutely delicious. (Although I almost could've dined on the pre-dinner garlic bread alone!)

I'm not a crazy yelper so I will just share my honest opinion ...We work at a small Italian restaurant on the Strip but we love Nora's and we couldn't wait to try the food, as he's never eaten here. Food was awesome . We shared a white pizza , mussels , truffle fries and bruschetta appetizer . Food was on point , hot , fresh and the bill was only $46 . Pasta will be next time as we will return !!! We had such a good time, we sat at the bar and laughed, talked, watched the game,watched the hustle and bustle of the night... only low point was the younger male bartender . Rudest service I have had in a very long time. Never once said hi to us when we sat down . We had to ask for menus , ask to order , sat with piles of dirty dishes at the end is our meals , he asked me to move my purse so I would not hit his shaker cups, just plain nasty. Have us dirty looks all night . I mean we were dresses nice, we are polite , we work in the business , 20+ years for me and 35 + for my friend , we didn't ask for anything but menus and to order. The 2 female bartenders were busting their butts back there. When we first walked in to hostess desk , we put out name on the list and went to bar to get a drink, the dark hair bartender , young was super sweet and made one kick butt martini, probably one of the best I have ever had . Me and my friend actually talked about it for 2 days! It was perfectly crafted . So all and all , the experience was awesome , I will be back and I'm super excited about Nora's but thought the bartender should be aware that he should be a little nicer to his guests .

The garlic bread was addicting and we had two family-style salads which were delish. I had spaghetti with eggplant, ground beef and red sauce for my entree and it was very good. The only very small hitch was that we traveled with a vegan who wasn't able to eat the pasta because it's made fresh with eggs. For us non-vegans, that was a big plus!

Wonderful food smells of pizza and other Italian delicacies strike one's nostrils as soon as the front door is opened; the friendly service has remained generally excellent regardless who I was served by; and the food has continued to be piping hot and always delicious.  I now realize that the Veal Parmigiana is as good and tender as the Veal Marsala; the Garlic Bread is consistently delectable (my group of 4 polished off 2 baskets); and the Chicken Soup is on the same high plane as the homemade Pasta Fagioli.

On my latest foray I enjoyed Antipasto Salad, and could barely finish half of it.  I look forward to eating the remainder later at lunch today.  Topped by chunks of fresh Mozzarella Cheese, folded over curls of tasty ham mixed with leafy greens, ripe wedges of red tomato, black olives, pepperoncini, and more, all coated with a dripping light Italian Dressing, beckon.

The Chicken Soup, which I was smart enough to order as a bowl rather than a cup, contained thin lengths of chicken just as I preferred, mixed with cooked celery and pieces of tomato, swimming in a hot, very tasty chicken broth.  It took many tablespoonfuls for me to finish it all, and almost ruined my appetite.  But not quite!

With considerable effort I also finished off a large cheesy and tomato sauce-covered medallion of Veal Parmigiana accompanied by smoking Spaghetti Bolognese with mushrooms added, as I had decreed.  Diane got a requested bowl of extra Alfredo Sauce to ladle over her Veal and Penne Alfredo at no extra charge.  Here one can have whatever the tummy desires!

If you can't accommodate your customers with their large amount of extra seating you have, then hire a larger staff. Isn't that why you moved into a bigger building in the first place? For more business? I called around 7 pm on a Tuesday, was told it would be a 25-35 minute wait which I was not happy with but because I really love their food, I was willing to wait. I literally walked into the restaurant 5 minutes later and was told that it would then be an hour long wait due to their ""reservations and walk-ins"" coming in just recently. They don't accept reservations for less than an hour when you call but yet an hour wait is somehow acceptable to them. Sad.",OLXQbtFoIMob7kDr6AL0ZA,0,0,2,CJx0NWl6ENkF_lRj797LxQ

We ordered a salad that was wilted and drenched in bottled dressing, pasta puttanesca (which we figured no one could screw up - but lo and behold, they destroyed it), and a veal dish.  We had to send the veal back because it was so tough and chewy, they very graciously took it back to the kitchen, but sent a new one to us that was just as terrible.  We didn't eat hardly anything and then left without even taking the food home as it was that bad.  We couldn't figure out why anyone would recommend it.

5893864,2017-01-05,0,pHJu8tj3sI8eC5aIHLFEfQ,"DL and I were promised a free breakfast and a $100 Visa gift card just for ""touring"" some new Time Share units and giving our ""opinion"".  An offer we couldn't refuse.  After 1 1/2 hrs. of unrelenting, hard sell, we left the sales office feeling even $200 wouldn't have been compensation enough.  The only good thing to come of the grilled-over-the-coals experience was the salesman's recommendation of Nora's.  We decided to take the Visa card and go there for dinner.  All I can is, ""all's well that ends well"", and it all ended very well, indeed.  The salesman has redeemed himself with  us!   

We're barflies and love to eat and drink at the bar.  It's a great place to sit if you don't want to be rushed or have your dinner tete a tete constantly disturbed by well-meaning waitstaff.  Love Nora's white and gray-streaked, beveled marble bar.  Elegant.  You could slice cheese on it!  I like my Manhattan's chilled to almost frozen and I told our friendly bartender to ""shake the hell out of it.""  He shook it all up like Elvis and poured it into a thickly frosted martini glass.  Peeling the lemon was a show in itself.  

Our first order was a tower of veggies--zucc., eggplant, Belgian endive, all topped with two fat slices of red bell pepper and arriving perfectly blistered from its bake in the wood burning oven.  You could taste the mellow woodiness in every bite.  Each leaf and ingredient in the house salad was lightly coated with the most perfectly balanced and seasoned House made Italian dressing.  I've been trying for decades to make a dressing like that at home, and still haven't succeeded.  We finished the entire generous portion between the two of us--a first for salads for us.  We usually get bored halfway through.   

The pizza was made with all imported cold cuts.  Flavor burst from all points on the compass with every bite.  It's the kind you can fold and eat neatly.  The crust, including the bottom, was browned and lightly charred and I saved a few crusts from the rim to have with my coffee this morning. The surrounding crust was surprisingly light to the touch even though it had the appearance of a dense peasant bread.  You won't break your teeth on it.  Nowadays, pizza has come to mean ""salty, oily, and characterless"", as in almost all chain foods.  Or overly precious and pristine, (think ""white"" pizza) as in many high-end bistros.  If you're bored with all that--you are in for a surprise.     We are relatively newcomers to Malbec and don't count ourselves among the experts.  We got the least expensive bottle and were well pleased.  It complemented and held its own against this hearty fare.    

An interesting aside:  How do all the girls gathered around the reservation podium stay so anorexically thin with all those aromas and glorious visuals swirling around all night?  Inquiring minds want to know.",6c1t4iWwA-gcKFyyicPulA,0,0,5,6jzLrw2OI0rVci1zJRtFWQ

I was dining alone, Michelle was pleasant and attentive. Had two glasses of a Sauvignon Blanc which I felt was just about right for portion size and price. My (smaller) size Caesar Salad could have been a little bigger, and I like larger croutons than what they serve. However the extra taste of anchovy in the dressing was a welcomed treat. Too many Italian restaurants these days seem apprehensive to add a little of the salty goodness. The initial basket of garlic bread was too soft, and more of a ""butter sponge,"" would have preferred some crispiness in it. I ordered the Linguini with white clams. Michelle paced the meal just right, it was served very hot, thank you! Pasta was a perfect al dente, sauce was very enjoyable with a nice balance of garlic, herbs, and butter. I requested a few slices of an alternate bread to finish the bottom of my bowl. A nice hot french style bread was brought and I preferred it way over the first serving. Did not partake of dessert, I rarely do after an Italian meal.

As I understand, they've expanded onto the original.  What used to be a pizza kitchen with 3 tables, went left, and went right, and now has 3 distinct rooms with 3 distinct different feels.  When reserving a table, make sure you specify.  The family room (quiet and better for families), the casual (still 3 tables, attached to the kitchen), and the ritzy (connected to the bar, very nice, and hip).  PS.  One little TV in the bar doesn't quite cut it.

(1)  One free Sangria with Yelp check-in with 1 purchased.  A $7.50 value, giddy up.  Could be more fruity and less sharp.  (4.0 stars)

(2)  Pasta alla Nora ($12.50) -- It has everything I wanted.  Pesto, meat sauce, eggplant, and pasta.  I added a meatball for $1.50, and it exactly fixed the spot.  Huge portion.  (4.0 stars)

(3)  The Melrose with Shrimp ($17.50) -- a creamy pesto sauce with sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts, and medium-size shrimp.  A little heavy-handed with the sauce, but better than not enough.  (4.5 stars)
 
The service was nice, but wavered between unavailable and forgetful.  Overall, this place just makes me happy.  It would totally be my everyday place if I was local.

The restaurant is decently sized with two dinning rooms on either side of the kitchen & main room, adequately lit, and is warm and cozy.  The service has consistently been genuine and friendly.

For starters, the garlic bread is delicious.  I always have to remember to stop eating it so I can save room for my actual entree!  That and I don't want to smell like garlic on date night.
The gnocchi and vodka sauce are a delicious combo.  I'm a meat and starch kind of girl, but that dish is so good on it's own I don't even need to throw in anything extra.
The crazy alfredo is crazy huge and packed with so many ingredients and flavor.  This dish could probably feed two people.
When it's a special, you MUST order the osso buco.  It's much more pricey than normal Nora's items (~$35), but it's soooo worth it.  It comes with a little spoon for the bone marrow, which is absolutely delectable.  This is my favorite dish in the world, and it nears perfection here.

If you're an Olive Garden/Carrabas/chain Italian restaurant kind of person, give yourself a well deserved real Italian meal and go to Nora's.  It doesn't disappoint.

If I'm going to splurge and have pasta, this is the dish I usually want.  But deciding between the two can be difficult.  Not anymore.  Last night I felt like red sauce so ordered the ziti which I just had in early Jan and they hadn't done THIS to it.  It's $13.95 and they reduced it to about a 1/3 the size.  I think I could have counted the number of macaroni in the (no more than) 3/4 in shallow dish about 5 inches in diameter.  Whaaaaaaaaaat are you doing?!  My companion order the Crazy Alfredo and it looked to be the usual dish/portion.  And he loved it!  You could always count on Nora's to be consistent in the past.  You never had to worry about what you would get but last night was far from the usual.  My ziti was always piping when it hit the table.  Last night I could eat it straight away.  We actually waited quite a while for our food.  After I got mine, I think it was because it had been sitting up on the line for awhile or they found some from the lunch hour to re-heat.  (A side note, Nora's, I was a little perturbed that after I told the busboy twice to leave the remaining bread on the table, that at some point while I was in conversation he came by the table and picked it up.  Trust me that you need to reiterate to your bus staff not to clear a table without ASKING the diner first.)  I will go back for the Crazy Alfredo (until they change that) and my second is now my first rated for Baked Ziti which really sucks because I love the mounds of ricotta on the top.

Sent us to the bar without enough seats.  No one sat at the table we were asked to surrender in the fifteen minutes we were there.  Never been upset with Nora's before!  This treatment was rude and unnecessary.",WGJfOKLBlPgHQrf6-Sbm6Q,0,0,2,2ArQZlLkUPYnHZ1x0BEr-A

Food: I got the crazy alfredo which was pretty good. I liked the elements entailed to it such as the Jalepeno for an extra kick, bell peppers for texture and a hint of sweetness and sausage for a heightened flavor. Still, it wasn't anything impressive that would amount to a total of $20 something per plate. My girlfriend got the pasta with meat sauce but wasn't impressive as her dish mostly had cheese. Quite disappointing to say the least. At the end of the meal, we received a complimentary dessert in celebration of my birthday which was one of the most exceptional tiramisu I've ever tasted. 

Service: it was okay. Nothing outstanding but for the type of restaurant they were, I expected a little bit more attention. Our server wasn't at all enthusiastic and made it seem like we were just another customer. Quite disappointing. 

Ambiance: beautiful venue as this is their new location. I really felt like this restaurant belonged in summerlin or even the Strip. It was modern with a dash of classic. 

Overall: I mean, I wouldn't be in a hurry to visit again. If you're a huge fan of Italian, I do suggest to give them a try but I wasn't too impressed.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,1,1,3,nSfZPahsWJdn5THpGcj9EQ
