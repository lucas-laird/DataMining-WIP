I ordered the lobster egg rolls.  Waited 15 minutes before (I think) waitress told me they were out of lobster egg rolls (not exactly sure what the reason was her  English wasn't great..but she blamed the chef.)  My partner was almost finished eating his mongolian beef meal by that time.  My vegetable order- which was placed less than 3 minutes after my partner placed his Mongolian beef order- was also delivered 15 minutes after he was served (again she blamed the chef.).  The final nail on the coffin was I asked a half an hour before my check came to have a mango pudding saved for my dessert. The pudding was on the dim sum menu which ended at 3PM.  Waitress said she would save one.  Then half an hour later I was given the check with no mango pudding.  Had to track down the waitress who said she was already over her shift time and was supposed to leave at 3PM and she said she was told pudding was sold out. I asked her why she didn't save me one as she had promised and she just made excuse after excuse that everything was the chef''s fault and not hers. She didn't want to pull one until I was finished with my meal.  I wasn't offered any discount for the lousy service.  I was told the manager leaves at 3PM for me to make complaints and it was 3:15 at that time. It is now dinnertime and I have again been told the manager isn't there and to call back tomorrow.  Although my baby bok choy in garlic sauce was delicious, both the spring rolls I had substituted for the lobster rolls and my partner's mongolian beef were awful.  The beef was very chewy. The only thing great about the place was the ambience which is much better than KJs original restaurant on Spring Mountain Rd.  Same bad, uncaring  service though. Save yourself the stress.  If you are not Asian and can't speak or understand their lingo it's nothing but frustrating.

The dim sum plates came out first. The ribs undercooked with the meat pink, shrimp was also undercooked. As for the beef chow fun, they half assed cooked it, from what it looked like they cooked the noodles separately and the beef, vegetable and sauce just getting dumped over. Sorry I'm not stupid, I eat it enough at other places to know that the noodles aren't white if it has been mixed with the sauce. Roast duck was super dry. HORRIBLE SERVICE and FOOD preparation. I couldn't even get a refill on water either. No racial but my gf and I were maybe a few of the couple asians(like 7) in there with the majority being white. When it came time to asking for the check it was like waiting in line at the dmv. C'mon now half the restaurant was empty and these fools can't even get me a bill?

I liked the shrimp (don't know how else to say this, so excuse me) balls. They were cooked well and very tasty. There were things that looked like wontons with chicken and spinach in them, that were very good. The tea was okay, but the servers were definitely on their job; constantly checking on my drinks, but not in an annoying way. Tried this rice that was in a giant leaf thing, didn't care for the flavor. Had this dessert that was made with sweetened egg, and it was delicious! I also liked that the portions were small, so you could try multiple things. 

My friend said that there was some pressure from the women with the carts, so I'm not sure if they work on commission, or maybe they need to empty their carts in a certain amount of time, or what. If he were not a confident man, I'm sure this would have made for an uncomfortable vibe, but him and I laughed it off.

Hands down this is the worst place I've eaten at. My friends and I had dinner here last night and I couldn't have been more disappointed with the service.

Here is why:
1. Our waiter was a tall, older looking Asian gentlemen and couldn't be bothered with actually taking care of us like waiters are supposed to! Thankfully there were 2 other men that saw his crappy attitude and took action. 
2. At the end of our meal, one of my friends politely asked for a box so she could take the remainder of her food home. Our jackass waiter proceeded to put my friend's plate in the bin with other dirty dishes, then put her left-over food in the box and handed it back to her. THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED. I SAW THIS WITH MY OWN EYES AND WHEN I CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT IT, HE DENIED IT. I asked to speak to a manager because I was so appalled, but all they did was say ""sorry."" I was FURIOUS about how they treated us like dirty street rats instead of human beings.
3. If reasons 1 and 2 didn't already convince you not to go here, here is another: 2 of my friends had explosive diarrhea this morning after eating food from this place.

IF YOU WANT SHITTY SERVICE AND EVEN WORSE FOOD, COME HERE. If you're smart, you will stay away and find another restaurant that is cleaner, less expensive and that has a welcoming atmosphere.",7iIAQSeISsQ_kyaNRuQ65Q,6,2,1,dIAZNv49ZZeSRmKm2VHHHQ

The chicken feet were undercooked and no flavor. The ribs were more fat then meat and again flavor lacking.  The shrimp were just average. 

My recommendation is to go down to Spring Mountain Rd and try another type of Asian food which has much better flavors. There are a lot there with much higher quality, fetter taste and good prices.

They have a good variety of dim sum and it's served hot like it should be. The soup dumplings are one of the best items, though this past Saturday they weren't very tasty. Maybe just a bad batch? Other favorites are the sesame balls, egg custard tarts, taro buns, pan-fried chive dumplings, and dumplings with peanuts inside. I wish they had sticky rice, the kind *not* wrapped in a leaf. We tend to go early to beat the crowds, so I'm sure we might be missing out on some variety that tends to come out later as mentioned by other Yelpers.
What makes it stand out for us is the restaurant is clean, stroller friendly, and the cart ladies are nice, unlike NYC! I guess some might consider that part of the experience but I'm over it. There's always a lot of Chinese patrons, always a good sign.
We haven't tried enough of the regular menu to comment on it yet, but I've had the beef pan-fried noodles and they were excellent!
Some things I don't like are how they charge for tea. Getting your check added up can take a while. We just walk it up to the back desk ourselves and pay there.
Chinese food is generally supposed to be cheap, so when I see outrageous prices at Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas (for example: bowl of won ton noodle soup in NYC - $5, Vegas Strip - $15!) it makes me nuts.

I know a lot of tourist might come to this restaurant because they just happen to drop by but please don't compare the Chinese food and the prices here to places in LA, NY, SF, or even HK.  It's because I know food is much, and cannot be compared other chinese restaurant in a desert.

Had visited other restaurants in ""Chinatown"" Spring Mountain Rd. area but were not impressed with what we had in the past ( FYI Sam Woo is the worst !  Very expensive and just plain bad).  Being from Toronto Canada, we're use to good authentic Chinese food.  When I came across KJ DS based on an Internet search, decided to give it a try, and we're glad we did.  In the end, we ended up at the place 3 times during our 5 day visit and we weren't even staying at the Rio hotel !
First visit was actual Dim Sum.  Compared to Toronto, the prices are very reasonable/similar.  Selection at times can be tricky since it all depends on what cart comes by your table.  Within 5 mins of being seated at our table, we had tea & food on the table and we were munching away. Flavor and presentation were good and what you would expect.  We were especially impressed with the BBQ roast duck (skin was really crispy !)  In total our bill for 4 people including tea & tip was around $55.
We also went two nights for dinner.  We ordered off the regular and Chinese menus. (You might need to ask for the Chinese menu).  The size of the dishes was good and very tasty.  The selection was also quite impressive and we managed to order dishes which suited all tastes.  Along with our dishes, we received complimentary soup of the day, rice and dessert.  In total our bills were in the $55 range, including tips. 
The service on all occasions was really good without being too pushy.
Based on our experiences with this level of food and service, we will definitely be back on our next trip to LV.

Duck: This was a total rip-off and I'll tell you why. The dish alone is $42 bucks !  That's about $10-$15 dollars over other restaurants in the area.  But we accepted the price since we knew Peking duck comes 2 ways and that would sort of make up for the price.  The usual crispy skin with bao buns and then minced duck with lettuce wraps is usually how the dish is served.

So they bring out the duck and it is the ""complete"" duck, meat and skin and all.  So we asked about the minced meat part with lettuce wraps.  They informed us that it would be extra charge.  $15 dollars extra to be exact.

The waiter kept telling us that they don't do it like LA restaurants. I don't know what he's talking about since restaurants in the area do duck 2 ways when you order Peking duck. I don't care where your at. When you order Peking duck, it is always served 2 ways and not charged EXTRA. The price on the menu is the price you pay!

Anyway.  We settled with what we had and asked about ordering more bao for our duck. We only wanted a couple more. The waiter first told us that you have to order by 3 or 6.  Then he comes back after checking with manager that minimum order is 6. The baos' are $.75 per !  

At this point we were totally dumbfounded and furiously frustrated by how badly we just got ripped off and how this restaurant tries to nickel and dime you with their outrageous extra charges.  

The waiter, sensing our great disappointment, offers us free dessert. It was taro with tapioca and was good, but not enough to dissuade me from writing this poor but deserving review.

The food was good and they did try to give us some sort of comfort with the free dessert.  For that, I give them 2 stars.",BAAFYijEbFgJbVVYh2XE-w,2,1,2,4lDRVtTgmQ0tCvK35MdFhA

I came here with a big group of friends for a friend's birthday lunch. We were staying at the Rio and I was pretty surprised that they had an actual dim sum restaurant there rather than off the strip near Chinatown.  

The carts went around pretty frequently with a vast variety of hot and freshly made dishes.  Everything was pretty tasty. My favorites were probably the shiau mai, fried turnip cake, and tripe.  Of course, I also enjoyed their pork and thousand year old egg congee-this always helps cure a hangover. Their portion is prettty small for the congee, so if you're not feeling so well, I suggest one congee per person.

We also ordered their duck and barbeque pork fried rice and fried noodles, all which were fulfilling as well.  

Coming from the San Gabriel Valley and having had my share of Dim Sum experiences, I would definitely recommend this place.

1380629,2012-02-05,2,fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A,"This is my new favorite dim sum place in Las Vegas. First experience, went with my parents. The wait for a table was maybe 10 minutes as I went during prime time for lunch (around 12pm). After I was seated at my table, I ordered the usual things you'd usually get when you go dim sum. Siu Mai, Steamed chicken feet , and sticky rice wrapped w/ lotus leaves. Very fresh, flavored well, and steaming hot ! When even I say hot, its HOT. 

The chicken feet were flavored well. Not over seasoned, though tendons still a little chewy (could have used a few more minutes in the steamer) but still pretty well done. 

The pork siu mai was topped with some masago (capelin roe). Steaming hot. Flavor was good. The pork was ""chewy"", not in a bad sense but it has a slight resistance that shows it was made properly. There is a fairly decent size shrimp piece in there as well, that was not over cooked. 

The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves was nice. Wrapped normally with a few lotus leaves. Did not fall apart as i was taking the leaves off. Flavored well, good amount of ingredients inside the sticky rice. 

After a few other items were ordered, ranging from a few different buns, shrimp rice noodle, pan fried chives dumpling, and egg tarts. 

There were two types of buns i had ordered. One was called (directly translated) leaking sand bun which was made with i believe a salted egg yolk mixture which when you pull apart the bun, the rich, egg yolk mixture oozes out. perfectly made. that's the result you'd look for when you get this bun. hot from the oven, before the bun itself soaks up this yolk mixture. very delicious. 

the other bun (directly translated) is called the snow mountain bun. Has a white crust on top with i believe a lotus filling. Very good. Nice and hot off the cart. 

The shrimp rice noodle was well-made also. Good thickness to the noodle and a good sized shrimp lined in the middle of the noodle, topped with a soy sauce that was prepared to be slightly sweet. 

The pan fried chives dumping is one of my favorite items to get. Parts of the outer skin layer crispy due to the pan fried technique while the size is still nice and soft. The filling had ample amounts of Chinese chives, shrimp, and pork. Seasoned really well, not overpowering the natural tastes of the chives or meats. 

Last but not least, is the egg tarts.. Fresh out of the oven, nice flaky golden crust with a glimmering, shiny egg filling in the middle. The crust was warm and flaky but still unable to taste the butter? they use to create the flaky crust mixed with a bite of the the slightly sweet egg center. One of the many favorite dim sum items or snack items among the chinese communities. 

Unfortunately this was my first meal, so I didnt get to order much before I was stuffed. I will not hesitate to come back again for another round of dim sum. 

A little suggestion, try going with 4-6 people in your party if you want to try a good amount of the dishes they offer during lunch. Lunch is served between 10 AM and 3 PM. Don't hesitate to go early or late ! They will specially prepare the item of your choice even if you don't see it available on the cart. 

The prices are very reasonable, especially considering this restaurants sits inside the Rio Casino & Resort. The prices are as followed:

Small: $2.28
Medium: $3.18
Large: $3.98
Special: $4.98

*edit*

For travelers like me, the logistic was convenience from the Strip, and the hotel was less rundown than triple P one block west.  The interior beautifully decorated in a big dining area with different sizes of table in column formation.  They got about four different TV on the wall playing sports and Chinese dramas on mute.

For Dim Sum, they got the flavor right with carts flying all over the place, they do seems a bit lacking on the grill stuff, and they are using metal baskets instead of bamboo, which retains excessive water in the dim sum.  However, quality wise still decent for what they got in this town, definitely cannot compare with California level.

They open until 2am, but they do not seem to have any late night special after 9-10pm like most locations in town.  Regular dinner was ok, nothing exciting about it.  We got some Black Bean Beef Chow Fun and a Seafood Tofu Pot.  Both were very good compare to my home state, but just ok if you use Vegas standard.  The bill came to about $50.

After sitting down, I recommend that everyone orders the hot tea. It's not complimentary, I think it's like 3 or 5 dollars, but it's unlimited refills, and nothing goes better with dim sum than hot tea.

So there are carts rolling around the place that are loaded with goodies that you can just pick and choose which dishes you want. Definitely if you are going here, I would recommend ordering the har gow (shrimp dumplings), shumai, pork bao, and coeng fan (rice noodle rolls). And, save some room for dessert, their egg custard tarts are fantastic, as well as their green tea and taro buns. But, always be open to trying new things, that's the key to dim sum.

Not everything I thought was stellar. First, the XLB or ""soup dumplings"" are not very appetizing. There is hardly any broth inside, and it's basically all wrapper. And, the char siu baau is pretty average, with it tasting more of sauce, rather than pork. And sometimes another issue I have, not all the dim sum are piping hot, which I feel should be.

Overall, this place is really great, with the positives greatly outnumbering the negatives.

The restaurant was less than half full, and it was close to 10pm, with plenty of waiters. So there was no excuse.

My husband and I ordered soup, mongolian beef, and steamed rice to share.

After 15-20 minutes, no soup had appeared. But our waiter dropped the mongolian beef on our table and before he ran off, my husband reminded him that we had ordered soup. More time passed, and no soup. Also, no rice had been delivered to us, so we couldn't really enjoy the Mongolian Beef, which was getting colder by the minute.

Finally a different waitress stopped by and we told her we were waiting for our soup.

She disappeared into the kitchen, and finally our original waiter came out with the soup and served it to us. We reminded him about the rice, and he said the rice wouldn't be ready for five minutes.

We ate our soup, all the while our beef dish sitting getting cold, and still no rice.

A different waiter stopped at our table, and we asked for rice and she said it was ready. Eventually someone brought it to us.

The food wasn't bad, but being from the Bay Area, it's nothing above average.

But the service pretty much ruined the meal for us.

Also, it was very overpriced. $13.95 for hot & sour soup, the other soups were $19.95. Mongolian Beef was I think $12.95.  All the food at the Rio is overpriced though. See my other review about their ""All American Bar & Grill."" Another bad experience. I would be really afraid to have Dim Sum there and not know how much you were being charged until the end.

49ers lost. To themselves. They would've won the superbowl.

UGH.

So we went down to KJ. The line for Carnival was horrendous. 

We got seated immediately.

It was just my fiance, our three year old, and I. So we got some chow fun, some dim sum, and..... duck feet. I actually just changed this to five stars thinking about the duck feet.

The chow fun was great, exactly how you'd expect it. The dim sum (I grew up in Hong Kong) was great, exactly how you'd expect it (if you know what to expect). The duck feet. Oh. My. God. The duck feet is why I'm going back, it's an appetizer so not tooo pricey but they perfected the flavor. 

I didn't win (I only play poker-against people, not casino) at the Rio on my free stay,the 49ers lost because of themselves, but I consider the trip a God Send because of KJ. 

And yes, we had breakfast, and dinner at Carnival, which was really good. I dream of the next time we goto KJ and try the Sea Cucumber.

If you haven't been to KJ, in my opinion. Try. This. Place. Don't settle for the Dim Sum. Try. This. Place. Order at least one dish from their MENU, not the dim sum menu. Their menu.... (So, my advice is TRY MORE than dim sum. Hell, they advertise themselves as a seafood restaurant!!)

The ambiance was great. It's so awesome to actually have Chinese servers in a Chinese restaurant that all speak English you speak respect, or humanity? Towards them first... I was slightly intoxicated and stumbled upon open kitchen doors, and are you kidding me? There were Chinese cooks!

There is a really great picture of recent Hong Kong Island on one of the walls, my son loved that as we have smaller versions in our house.

Food was 5 star service 4, in our three person experience. Maybe because I'm a white guy that speaks Cantonese? 

I'll be going back. Soon.",ht_vlqQzggJXm6s4IPHp8w,1,1,5,Ye-b5UgZyQGmEXrHpQPDSw

1641798,2017-06-09,1,fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A,"SUMMARY: Apparently this is a popular spot for dim-sum; my NON-dim-sum experience was pretty underwhelming.

THE UGLY DETAILS: I am passing away my morning at The Rio, while an auto shop across the street is installing new seating leather in my car. It's a Thursday at 11:30am. This venue has about 70 table-tops. And, except for a couple of the 12-tops, this place is full to the brim. Almost entirely with Asians. And I mean local Asians, not tourists. And they are all here for the dim-sum carts. When they could have gone just two blocks over into Chinatown for their dim-sum. To me, that speaks volumes regarding the quality of the dim-sum here.

I was seated promptly, to an egg-white tablecloth 2-top. One paper napkin and some plastic chops are my only table-mates, no salt, pepper, soy or rooster. I will be truly be dining alone. The entire staff, not surprisingly, were also Asian. My servers had accents so thick, I could only understand a word here and there, and they chattered away at the speed-of-light. Hence the direction that my meal was actually taking evolved into a bit of a mystery.

Again, I was only one of two tables that was not entirely Asian. The other was four WSOPers who were already drunk. Meaning they were already eliminated from the tournament in the early rounds. Yet they were taking turns trying to verbally out-blab one another with their insightful poker observations of the other players. General Custer graduated last-place in his competition at West Point - but he also got eliminated first at the Little Big Horn. All of you lost. Babble on about how THAT played out. And drop the testosterone talk. Then maybe you'll be better poker players down the road.

The menu is over-priced, again not entirely a surprise given this is inside a casino property. The cheapest meals on the menu were Mongolian Beef or Kung Pao Chicken, $17 a plate. A bowl of Wonton soup, get this, $15. Maybe it was a bowl the size of Viet pho, but so what? It's still step-sis to chicken noodle soup. Most of the plates were in the $20s, $30s. $40s for duck. I went with the Kung Pao. And two egg rolls at $9.

""No egg rolls. Spring rolls."" Ok, so it's spring rolls. Rapid-fire unintelligible chatter. I think he's telling me that's going to be $10. Or maybe $10 MORE. I can't tell. I ask if the Kung Pao comes with fried rice. More rapid-fire unintelligible chatter. I think the answer is yes, for $1 more. ""Fry rice what?"" I say pork. The menu doesn't have a single beverage listed on it, not even hot tea, so I figured those prices were stealth so as to be outrageous - and stuck with water.

The spring rolls appear in under two minutes. Fried not fresh, three of them. They are warm outside, cold inside. That means they got nuked to find their half-life on my table. Meh.

Then the Kung Pao. With a side of white rice. I say I thought I got ordered the fried rice. More rapid-fire unintelligible chatter. I think now he is jotting down a full order of fried rice which is going to come in at nearly $20. I signal to stop, saying I will just eat what I have.

When he leaves, I see him go consult with his peers, all looking back at my table, apparently discussing my unusual ordering habits. What with me wanting egg rolls and a side of fried rice in a Chinese restaurant and all. Instead of eating conger eel and whatever off the carts.

The Kung Pao is bland. Really bland. It's no more tasty than what I can get round the corner at my local take-out joint. If that tasty. Not bad, just bland. The portion is what I would call a bit less than average. Now I am thinking it's a durn good thing I didn't go with dim sum, because I would have had no idea what any item was going to cost ... and so I could have easily ended up with some kind of three-digit tab for lunch.

When I got back out into the casino, I was still hungry. And I mean immediately, not in an hour. I caught myself wishing I had tried a Philly Steak at the Sports Book instead.

RECOMMENDATION: All these Asian customers are probably not wrong, so the dim-sum is probably pretty good. I mean it all even looked good. So if you are down for dim, it's likely worth investing in your own evaluation. But for non-dim sum, steer clear and just head up the street to Chinatown.",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,3,0,2,ArhBqHrsyGRTMJlo0oTlRw

Depending on the dish, it falls into different categories:
A costs 2.28
B costs 3.18
C costs 3.98
And they charge you a dollar per person for tea.

I've been here twice now, and both times the food has been enjoyable. I particularly like their liu san bao (excuse my butchered pinyin)

I went on Chinese New Year, which was probably my mistake because all of us asians decided to crawl out from all the nooks and crannies of vegas to get dim sum. I wish they had a microphone or a texting system to notify you when it was your turn. Instead, there was only the hostess shouting out numbers in canto and English; so everybody basically huddled around her booth/the entrance of the restaurant. I think that could be made much more efficient. Additionally, the hostess would lead the people to their seats, and while that happened, people waiting in line to get a number would get shuffled around. We were actually waiting at the hostess' table waiting for a number and we got cut by two different people who just interrupted and demanded a number. That's more the patron's fault than the restaurant's, but still it brought a sour taste to my mouth

Service: We waited for some time until someone came up from the restaurant to assign us a table. The dinning area wasn't full at that time, so obviously they were  understaffed. It was also very hard to get waiters' attention *any time*. I asked for something not on the menu to get a vegetable dish and also asked how much it would that be. The waiter told me it would be $10ish. Then he suggested Treasure Island Pea Sprout. I assumed it would have a similar price and didn't ask further. However, we found that this dish costed $10 more expensive. They also forgot our dimsum order, which was also printed on the bill. Given that this restaurant didn't even have a line waiting at the door, this mistake is not acceptable. 

Food: Their food was on the salty side, such as seafood eggplant in a claypot, Cantonese style beef. They taste good with rice, though. The green bean dish we got was half raw. Chow fun and Yang-chow fried rice was good. However, they are not even par to average in the line of Chinese food IMO. It could be that I am spoiled by SF  Chinese food. There's no free dessert, but there are fortune cookies when checkout. 

Price: This place is overpriced given the food quality and service. 

If you are craving for Asian food, I would recommend dropping by the Asian food court around Chinatown mall on Spring Mountain Rd. Food/price is much better/more reasonable there.",aPMmr7_ETLGlUTRApg1Dbw,2,0,2,IMcs87r3un0ChpPfujZZUQ
1789929,2013-02-10,0,fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A,"A great dim sum place near the strip at the Rio.  You can get here from the strip from the free shuttle bus from Bally's or simply take a cab.  Brightly lit, clean interior with great service too.  In my opinion the dim sum here rivals those of Seattle and San Francisco Chinatowns.  Even the tea (goke fah or chrysanthemum) was fragrant  and high quality.  Our total bill before tip came to about 70 for seven people, and we ordered lots.

Some standout items included curry fish balls, sticky chicken rice, beef balls, Siu Mai, black bean spareribs, and fried bean curd filled with shrimp.  All of these items had just enough salt and weren't too oil - in fact all still had good texture.

A minor miss is the beef chow fun.  Beef was seasoned well and there was plenty of ""wok breath"", but the chefs here sliced up the rice noodles.  Most of our group were used to llonger wide noodles, and I tend to agree - it would make the dish better.  Imagine eating pasta with spaghetti sliced up and you'll notice the difference!

1848007,2015-02-02,0,fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A,"I'm writing this review based on my experience over this past Sunday. The restaurant is located inside of a off-strip hotel (RIO) so it's reasonable to expect that a lot of patrons who dine here are guests of the hotel and a mix of locals. I am the latter and neither myself or my dining guest were of Chinese nationality.

We were sat in the middle of the restaurant during a moderately busy Sunday early afternoon and were quickly approached by the food carts (we had no qualms with the delivery of food, with the exception that some dishes were served cold when they should have been hot). 

A waiter then approached us once and asked for a drink order. Other than that, there were no efforts made to check on the table. We tried several times to flag down a waiter to get some basics (chili sauce, soy sauce, napkins, etc.) and were met with quick turns of the head as if they ""didn't see us."" After several minutes of being what we felt were purposely ignored, we noticed these same waiters were very attentive and visited several times the tables seated with all Chinese or mostly Chinese guests. Finally I was able to get the attention of a gentleman I assumed to be the restaurant manager who asked if we needed something. After requesting my simple condiments I received an eye roll from the gentleman and then an ""ok."" After observing him going back and fourth to other tables after waiting 10 minutes for the delivery of two simple items, we noticed he went back to the main reception desk and stood there, not making an attempt to deliver the items to us. We then had to literally almost grab a hold of another waiter before they acknowledge our presence and again requested our simple condiments, that were then promptly delivered. The (assumed) manager then walked to a table of women sitting next to ours and proceeded to have a full on conversation, even going so far as to sit down at their table and socialize. I did notice on two occasions that he did glance our way and give a rude, irritated look our way as they proceeded to talk. At this point both my partner and myself were fed up with the incredibly rude, purposeful lack of service at our table and asked for the check, which they were quick to get us and wisk away as soon as we put out cash in. When the server looked in the pocket and noticed that I had given 3 $20 bills on a $58.35 check, she asked if we were ready to pay and I nodded yes, she then stood there for a few seconds with a look that almost said, are you kidding with this? no tip? which was purposeful on our account. 

This may sound like a rant, and it is, but I want to make it perfectly clear that we were treated with indifference and rudely the entire experience, for what seemed no other reason than that we were not Chinese. 

For a restaurant located inside of a hotel to provide this sort of service to it's guests and guests of the hotel is unheard of. This experience reflects poorly not only on the restaurant but the hotel itself. 

So my suggestion, if you are not Chinese, then don't dine here because they obviously and clearly do not want your business. Next time, I'll go to a establishment on Spring Mountain.",gHPondOlRoeerorwe51M3w,3,1,1,7ZpdGf5MhiGTk3RnePiRTg

We don't really eat dim sum in Las Vegas. The reason is that the dim sum here ain't that good in town. Considering the number of Chinese tourists, you'd expect things to be a lot better than they are. That being said, if someone has a hankering for dim sum, we generally come here for the more comfortable seating arrangements and the slight edge it has on the food.

Don't get me wrong, it's nothing really special. I'll be the first to admit that the meatballs have been mixed with too much cornstarch. The cheung fun has way too much rice noodle compared to the meat filling. All the meat items kind of taste the same. Oh and the XLB come in little foil cups which = not good in my books - and the fact that they serve XLB in the first place but that's another story. The pinepple bun/runny egg yolk buns often leak too and they look exactly (suspiciously) the same as the ones that you get @ East Ocean. Hmmmm....

I'll be the first to admit though, their sweet tofu is a guilty pleasure and I usually get an order of this because I'm a sucker for fresh sweet tofu.

KJ is a bit more upscale; the ambience is nicer, and of course the place is newer.  The service we had was also actually very good for a Chinese dim sum place.  The last 2 times I was in Ping Pang Pong I actually found the service rather chaotic.  So this is definitely a +1 for KJ.

The dim sum was above average, and actually really good by Vegas standard.  The congee rivaled some of the best in the SGV.  Pork spareribs were yummy and there was more meat than bones.  Cool!  Bean curb wrap was good and so was the steamed taro cake.  We also liked the beef balls although I found the Chinese bbq sauce flavor a bit too overwhelming.

Homemade potstickers are OK, not amazing.
Clams with ginger-scallion sauce are good quality, but the sauce is a too oily and unappealingly thick and not usable as a sauce you would actually eat on your rice. If you must, get the black bean sauce and request 'low oil'. You'll probably get 'high saliva' ha ha ;)
House Lo Mein comes out kind of oily as well. Again, ask for 'low oil' if you gotta get it.

Management is a bit odd, a holdover trait from the original Spring Mountain Road location where you get a completely different menu w/no specials (and a fork) if you don't speak Chinese.

Dim Sum here is pretty average - it may even make you realize that you don't actually like Dim Sum. Kind of like jazz. We're told that it's good and that we should appreciate it, but the nuts of it are that it kind of sucks. Eating lukewarm food that was cooked 5 hours ago off of a rolling cart is just dumb.

- Pork siu mai 
- Calamari
- Chinese broccoli
- Pan fried noodles with chicken
- BBQ pork bun
- Rice noodle wrapped with beef
- Roast duck 

All these items were very tasty. The rice noodle wrapped with beef, calamari, and the pan fried noodles with chicken were my personal favorites.

Let me get to the heart of the matter... KJ is easily the best Dim Sum that I've experienced in Vegas. Formerly, I visited a few spots, mostly Ping Pang Pong, Cathay House, and Orchids...all because I had my heart set on something specific. These establishments often had items I would enjoy, but also would routinely break my heart with other underwhelming items. KJ Dim Sum & Seafood does everything as good or better than the rest. It's not that my heart skipped a beat upon tasting KJ's offerings, but after experiencing several quality items on my first visit I had a change of heart with both my dim sum expectations and my restaurant choice.

I never claimed to be an expert in anything Chinese...but if you'll allow me to wear my heart on my sleeve for a moment, I did read a Wikipedia Page on Dim Sum, so with complete, absolute, and total uncertainty I can tell you that Dim Sum (dmsm; ??; ??) could maybe, perhaps, and even possibly be translated as: Touching the heart...a gesture from the heart...how it is that one's heart is so...a gift from the heart. The gifts at KJ Dim Sum & Seafood include Har Gau (Shrimp Dumpling), Lau Sa Bao (Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun), Shrimp Rice Noodle, Daan Taat (Egg Custard Tart), Fried Shrimp Balls, Siu Mai (Pork Dumpling), Taro Bun, etc. These are some of my favorites to satisfy my bleeding heart, but if I truly bare my heart, there are many other items I've enjoyed at KJ over several visits as well.

As others have noted you need to time your visit right, so bring some patience and your heart of gold. It is actually better to have to wait in line a little if you are looking for the largest variety and freshest food. This waiting period can be a great chance for a little heart-to-heart with your dinning companions though. When they are busy they obviously turn over more food, so the carts are re-filled quicker. There is also a better variety during the busier times because they know they will find someone willing to take all of the different types of items the kitchen produces. If you're a man after my own heart, this variety is welcomed in dim sum options. In contrast, if you come too early or too late, the food will sit on the carts a little longer and the number of different items made will decrease...and in this case, absence does not make the heart grow fonder.

KJ is known for their food, not their service. Their service has even been know to break your heart from time to time. However, there are levels of service that can be expected. Like many Chinese options at this price point, the service will not be that great. For best service, the faint of heart would do well to bring a Cantonese speaker that doesn't mind being vocal to nearby carts. If you are out of luck there, then ask questions...even a group of white folks can manage to get what their heart's desire without too much difficulty, but you need to be proactive. If you can't be proactive simply say a prayer, cross your heart...and hope to die?...actually just point to things that look good.

So boldly follow your heart as you venture in to KJ Dim Sum & Seafood to eat your heart out! I sincerely hope, from the bottom of my heart, that you enjoy the experience. And if you don't rest assured that dim sum isn't really all that expensive so it won't hurt the bank that much and after all, a heavy purse makes a light heart.

-We kept asking for soy sauce, 3 times, and we never received it

Congee: comforting with Century egg. 
Salt and Pepper Squid: perfectly executed.
Walnut Shrimp: deliciously decadent! 
Shrimp Balls: bite sized balls of goodness :) 
Egg Custard: my favorite in Las Vegas. 
Red Bean Bun: savory, fluffy bun.

Chive Balls: not at all greasy. 
Sweet Tofu: flavorful without being cloying. 
Taro Bun: so very good, real taro flavor. 
Chinese Broccoli with Garlic: superfresh
Sesame Balls: sweet, nutty, tasty balls! 
XLB: everyone loved them: I don't eat pork, but they were soupy for sure!

I consider myself to be picky when it comes to dim sum, we just moved here from California and we were spoiled with many heavy hitter dim sum restaurants close to home. Since we've moved here, we've tried almost all of the popular dim sum restaurants in Vegas: Orchid Garden (2/5), Chang's (3/5), Cathay House (3/5) and also Ping Pang Pong (3/5). Yet, I would still easily recommend KJ dim sum as sum' of the best dim sum in Vegas! 

It's located inside of the Rio, right across the way from the Carnival World Buffet. We arrived around 1pm on a Saturday. They were bustling but we didn't have to wait, they were able to seat us right away. They were quick with rolling the carts by and were quick to grab us our drinks and tea. I was extremely pleased with the service here. 

Now let's get on to the best part, the food! 

Shumai - they were very moist and had great flavor. A nicely done shumai for sure. 5/5

Har gow - so much yum! They make them amazing here. Super delicate clear wrapper and steamed to perfection. The shrimp inside tasted amazing. I can eat 10 orders of these! 5/5

Fried taro puffs - these were little fried fluffs of taro. The taro filling tasted good and the exterior was fried well and flaky. 5/5

Bbq pork bun - the buns were small, glazed and sticky. The bbq pork filling inside was just enough but super flavorful and moist. We enjoyed them! 5/5

Bbq pork bao - (the one that looks like white clouds) it was piping hot and steamy, very fluffy, and the filling was moist. The bbq pork flavor is great! We devoured these little morsels and also saved some to eat later as well. They were still amazing after siting in the container and at room temperature. 5/5

Shrimp noodle rolls - these were perfect! I enjoyed the soft, moist and tender noodles. The shrimps inside were flavorful as well. 5/5

Egg custard tart - I was completely taken back by how they stayed warm at our table the entire time! It was extra custardy, super crazy moist, velvety buttery, and very flaky. I was in heaven! Omg. It's the best egg custard tart we have ever had! I grew up eating these babies in California, but man these win them all. 5/5 

Total damage with a coke was $25! That's a good price for 2 hungry adults. We love this place!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,11,7,5,eKGvt3c93L_tuvcVk9EHYw

I love dim sum, and I have been used to the best in Manila because of our proximity with China.  But when we moved here to Vegas, it's been quite a challenge looking for good dim sum.  Thanks to the suggestion of a dear friend, we've decided to give it a go.  The first thing you immediately notice is the vibrancy of the place.  High ceilings, uncrowded tables, red walls, soft lighting and very clean/crisp table cloths.  So often you see dim sum places pay little attention to details. (The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)  

We came early thinking to avoid the crazy rush hour which we did, but unfortunately could not order anything off the dim sum menu since the chef arrives at 11:15am.  Make sure you go after that time of you want to enjoy their fried rice, noodles or other entrees.  But you will have plenty to choose from the dim sum carts whizzing by - from congee/rice porridge with century egg, silken tofu, fried shrimp wantons, egg custards, taro cakes, pork buns and dumplings.  Our favorites were the steamed pork buns, hargaw or shrimp dumplings and the sweet spare ribs.  They tasted like they were all freshly made and although they still do not quite compare to the stuff we grew up with, esp from Binondo (Chinatown)... they are the best dim sum I've had so far in Vegas.

If I had one small quibble, it's that the soy sauce in their Kikkoman jars did not taste like Kikkoman.  Heh.",b_9bJ2YjHbbvAob56f6U7A,0,0,4,G6BoLlx77yzVZ5g2m8EOqg

This place obviously is biased towards Chinese speaking people. I asked the server if I can order some snow pea leaves, and she said it wasn't available. OK, well, a short while after I see a table getting exactly what I ordered delivered to a Chinese family. I then hailed the server and pointed at it. Well, they served it warm not hot and also it was $18.... Later I checked the menu and it should have been $12.

They charged us $1 per cup of tea for each person in our group even though only 1 person actually drank the tea (the remaining 5 cups were upside down on turntable).  The rest ordered sodas or water, so in addition to a $6 tea bill, we also had a $6 soda bill.
2. Their menu was not available because they were changing things, so when we ordered chicken fried rice off the menu, we had no idea how much it cost, and we were shocked to see our bill for $13.95 for a small plate of it.  
3. There were no prices on the dim sum either. Not even dishes marked A, B, C, D and no price points on any paper indicating what dishes A, B, C, D might cost so we were ordering blind.  When we asked, the dim sum cart ladies did not speak any English.
4. The dim sum cart ladies were scamming us by stamping our paper for more than they placed on our table.  I had to watch that stamping process very carefully and question everything (with hand gestures) and for some reason, we ended up being charged for 5 A dishes, 9 B dishes, and 4 C dishes, which is odd because the same items I order at other dim sum restaurants seem to be A dishes with an occasional B or C dish - again I felt scammed.
5. The bill for 4 adults, two children for lunch was $89 plus tip.  Typically when we eat dim sum at other restaurants with our Chinese friends, we have 5 adults and two children and our bill averages only $50-60, which is why we love dim sum so much.  There is usually so much value for the price.
6. Some of the food was good, but some of the hot food was cold.  Not impressed with anything.

We will never eat at KJ Dim Sum again.  There are just too many other great and trustworthy dim sum restaurants to eat at and those restaurants offer English menus with prices in plain sight so customers know how much they are paying and are not shocked by the bill.",LA8nn9AJnP9ED-DEXzPqrA,0,0,1,hhY3wrXkPtYbhPXOJIiMqA

I visited KJ Dim Sum & Seafood the day after I visited  Ping Pang Pong. I arrived at both restaurants late for typical dim sum. I also showed up at both locations with 2 different sets of people who'd never had dim sum before. The difference in the experiences was night and day and difficult not to compare. It didn't help that both restaurants are across the street from one another Ping Pong Pang is in the Gold Coast which reeks of old smoke, cheap liquor and the sweat of desperation. The other is in the Rio which may be as old as the Gold Coast but it's kept itself in better shape so you aren't turned off by your experience and your nostrils aren't assaulted with funk before you even get to the restaurant. KJ  Dim Sum is also close to the exit of the casino.

We were seated fast and maybe because we were late and they were empty the trays came often and fast. What didn't they have? By the time my cousins came back from the restroom our table was pretty much covered with dim sum and my mouth was full. By the way you should know that the restrooms are a bit of a trek from the dining room so govern yourselves accordingly.
 
The food was good so I'll be honest I didn't really want to stop and explain what everything they hadn't seen before was. Can I just tell you I'm tempted to give this place a 5 because they had duck. So few dim sum eateries have duck and their duck was delicious. The only drawback was that the duck was a little on the cold side and filled me up so much that I couldn't really do much but peck at the other dim sum dishes we ordered. What I had, I enjoyed and was prepared in a style I've become accustomed to over the years. My newbie cousins actually asked where dim sum had been all their lives. To which I explained that much of America has been deprived of quality authentic Chinese food which is a crying shame.

While I found the prices at Ping Pang Pong to be a little bit higher than I'm accustomed to. I walked away from KJ Dim Sum feeling like I got a deal. I might just stay out at the Rio on my next visit to Vegas so I can eat there every day of my stay. I don't like having to travel miles for good Chinese food. Call me spoiled.

Everything was good. Then we got the beef chow fun, there was lots of onions, green onions and bean sprouts but minimal noodles and beef. All I tasted were the veggies. No, seriously!!! I have gotten in the past and it's perfect. Not sure if they started getting stingy with the noodles and beef part. Since I was paying $15 for the beef chow fun, I said something to the server and he basically said, ""This is how we make it. If you want another one, you can order another one."" Wow.

First of all, we came in on Wednesday, September 13 , 2017 around 10:30 a.m. We were greeted and seated. There wasn't a lot of people in the dining room until 11:30 a.m. Instead of drinking random drinks, we drinked traditional with our dim sum, hot tea.

We ordered:
- Har Gow
- Chicken Feet
- Shu Mai
- Lo Mai Gai (Sticky rice with meat and egg)
- Char Siu Bao (Steamed BBQ Bun)
- Shrimp Rice Noodle Roll

We had to wait about 20 more minutes for more different dim sum food to come out. We also ordered:
- Char Siu Bao (Baked BBQ Bun)
- Coconut Bun
- Egg tart
- Fried Dumpling
- Fried Spinach Dumpling

Some of the foods were ok. The variety was small and not as big. Each dish costs over $2.99 each! The service was alright, I was happy that they served us but not in a happy way.

She pointed to the kitchen at the back of the room, (we were seated near the entrance) and continued to say, ""I just came all the way from over there."", making it seem like getting drinks was sooo hard for her to do.

My dad apologized to her and explained that she must've heard us incorrectly. Before she left to get our soda, my dad apologized again. Not our server. Must be a generational thing for him to apologize to her for the miscommunication, but she definitely should have not given us an attitude about it.",9ajubOF2dbxHYNuEMkYycw,0,0,2,LfPd6kPOHZWrClqRDCDxqQ

We asked our server for some tea, hot sauce, hot mustard, soy sauce, and ice water...but he left halfway through our order and we were yelling at him as he was walking away from us.  He didn't even turn around to acknowledge us as he was waking away!!!

I've been to my share of dim sum restaurants around the world, from Hong Kong, NYC, SF, and LA, so I get that good service isn't considered to be important to most operators...especially to non-Chinese customers.  However, being in the Rio Casino, I would think that KJ would make more of an effort to elevate their level of service.  At the least, I would think that the Rio would demand a minimum level of service standards to uphold their rating as a top level hotel.  

KJ fails in the level of service, but there aren't many dimsum restaurants in town to compete with so they probably get away with it.  It's disappointing but hopefully somebody else decides to open up a dimsum spot that provides the same level of food but focuses on a higher caliber of service than that found at KJ.",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,2,1,2,-O6cCavZwcVT7JXDnN0CpQ

Upon arriving, we were sat immediately and offered tea, water or beer. Once we knew what we wanted, we put the order in. About 6 minutes later the food started arriving fast. Here is the scoop on our food....

Spring rolls....tightly wrapped and super delicious.

Hot and sour soup...huge bowl, best I have ever had..took some home.

Scallops with seasonal greens....omg! So good and so many scallops, had broccoli cooked perfectly with mushrooms, onions and red pepper flakes...so good.

Beef tenderloin app...different as the beef is chilled and sliced thin. Comes with pickled veggie strips that are amazing.

Sweet and sour chicken...huge portion and so tasty.

You can get a bowl of steamed rice for $1.00 as a base .

The servers are quick and polite though not overly friendly ( they were busy) .

The décor is nice and room comfortable.

I took off one star as they did not offer even fortune cookies for desert and did not seem very welcoming ( again maybe because they were busy) but for the price, the could offer fortune cookies after the meal.

3307911,2015-09-15,0,fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A,"Located inside the Rio close to the Carnival Buffet end, KJ is pretty much on par with Ping Pang Pong, another dim sum place at the Gold Coast.  These places reside in the older hotel casino places that are designed to attract more value-minded Chinese people who are looking for cheaper limit gambling and are comfortable having something familiar and convenient without having to leave the premises.  We were attracted to KJ because someone told my wife that they had the best dim sum in Vegas, but that just makes me feel more leery of the local standards for such food...

The dining room is large and expansive, especially when compared to PPP.  The feel is like that of an 80's style HK or Cantonese dim sum house complete with old school push carts making their rounds.  On the day we went, the dining room wasn't half filled at 1130am, but ebbed and flowed while we were there and seemed busier by the time we were finished.  The crowd was not very diverse, about 95% Chinese which was probably a good sign actually...

The three of us each picked the items that we liked although I wasn't feeling particularly adventurous this day as I only went for the items that I personally wanted.  Usual staples such as haw gow and siu mai I didn't even bother trying myself this time.  Some of the items were disappointing because they were not piping hot like the Vegetarian Pan Fried Rice Noodles (haw fun) and the Fried Turnip Cake (low bok go) was downright cold, to the point that we had to ask them to return it to the kitchen where they reheated it as opposed to replacing it with a fresh one.  The service didn't balk when we asked them to do this and was polite and attentive all around and the push-cart ladies were mostly cheerful...

I had the Sticky Rice (new my fon) wrapped in leaves and the Thousand Year Egg Porridge (pay don sow yuk juk) and was generally satisfied  although both of them were not particularly special and maybe even a little flat or bland tasting...

I found the Green Tea Buns surprisingly good.  Their outside texture was not unlike a pineapple bun with a crumbly, crusty top but the flavor of the filling was not quite as sweet as a pineapple bun.  Two out of three of these on the plate had a lighter color than the third one which I can only assume meant that they came from different batches...

Since it wasn't too crowded during our visit it was nice that we didn't have to fight over the items in the carts with other patrons, but the bad side is that you worry about food turnover and items becoming stale and in some cases cold.  I was generally satisfied with our experience although nothing particularly felt special or stood out to me, but my expectations could be affected by my experience with places like Ping Pang Pong where I had very low expectations but was pleasantly surprised, and then coming here after being recommended to us.  I would return but probably not come out of my way, aside from being in LV in the first place...",LP59kBNEHmASJZWynra29g,2,2,3,bhdIX4jB0uHZnnJjXqiQAg

We ordered a few of our favorites: Haianese chicken, pea sprout leaves w garlic sauce, beef w orange peel and salt and pepper fried fish filet. They were all pretty delicious and generous family style portions. There really wasnt anything to complain about.

One thing was the orange beef could have been crispier, some people like it soft and tender and other people like light batter and crispy.

Girl #1: ""Hi, I'd like to have the beef pan fried noodle""
Waiter: ""Ok""
Girl #2: ""Hi, I'd like to have the seafood pan fried noodles""
waiter: ""Beef pan fried noodle?""
Girl #2: ""No....Seafood pan fried noodle""

first the garlic scallion chicken comes out first....almost halfway through eating it, we had to remind the waiter of our shumai. He clearly had forgotten about it and ran to go get it. Fortunately, the shumai was DELICIOUS. the second i bit in, my mouth automatically went MMMMMMMMMM. it was uncontrollable. 

then our gf's pan fried noodles FINALLY come out.........guess what comes out? TWO beef pan fried noodles!!!!!!!

my gf pointed it out that she ordered the seafood noodle........and it was hte most awkward exchange ever. the waiter pauses ""OH No my mistake......."" pauses and looks at her.......and did not immediately even offer to take it back........and my gf is just like it's fine don't worry about it (she obviously didn't want to wait while we were almost done with our food) and he has a sigh of relief an djust leaves it.

NO one comped her meal and he didn't even offer to take it back and just looked at her to see if she would just accept it! Thank goodness she even eats beef!

Available parking outside by the hotel or in the rio parking garage. If you go early you'll probably get slammed with people or get lucky and find seats super quick. Aside from their super oriental interior design the service is superb. Being Asian American has its perks, I can order in Chinese and sometimes point of course. 

The dim sum ladies are everywhere. If you find a cart pushing towards you better order as much as you can because everything looks super delicious. It's delicious, only reason I always come back to the rio.

Still a great place to get your dim sum fix, and I'd like to hope much safer considering it is inside a Hotel/Casino as opposed to a free standing restaurant in Chinatown(I'm looking at you, Cathay House!) If you haven't seen that ""Dirty Dining"" segment, better check it out!

Everyone has their opinion on dim sum , and KJ is still in my top 3. They are fast, there are a lot of items to choose from, and from my experience here, they always got different things on the cart I haven't seen or tried. After grubbin' on some savory offerings, the dessert cart comes around and I grab my usual Rice Cakes and there are these buns with a white crunchy topping, so wifey asks about it and we find out they are Taro Buns. We get them, and it was love at first bite! They weren't real taro root though, it was purple sweet potato, and they were BOMB!

After paying our bill and on our way out, I spied similar looking buns on a cart and asked the lady what they were...They also have Green Tea Buns too which is another excuse to return!  ALOHA!!!

They have really good Chinese pastries such as the Pineapple Bun (which was served warm, sweet, and coconutty), BBQ Roast Pork Pastry (which is triangular, sweet, savory, and sprinkled with sesame seeds), and Egg Custard Tart. 

Other favorites included the Crystal Shrimp Dumplings, Shumai, Beef Balls (which consists of beef, water chestnut, and parsley and served with Lea and Perrin sauce), Chicken Feet, Crispy Beancurd (which was wrapped with shrimp and parsley), Beef Crepes, Shrimp Crepe (which was filled with large shrimp), and Chinese Broccoli (which was served with oyster sauce)

Service was terrible each and every time.  It was chaotic and the management doesn't seem to care.

Such was the case Saturday with Li Ly, our friend who is moving back to San Francisco and the reason 7 of us got together for brunch.

We had shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, sesame balls, sweet buns, and some good shrimp balls.  I don't know the Chinese names for any of these, but they were generally good.  

We had fairly good service although Li Ly had to dig her heels in and get the service we needed.

Other than in the Midwest, this may be some of the worst dim sum I've eaten. When frozen dumplings from Trader Joe's or the Asian supermarket taste better, you have a problem. Unless you really have a hankering for dim sum and can't get it anywhere else where you live, I would recommend eating something else.

This is located inside the Rio, across the from the buffet. We didn't have a problem getting a table for 7 when we arrived around 11 am but there was a wait when we left around noon.

The service for the carts was extremely slow - I don't know if that's normal, or if was a function of where we were sitting.

Best Dishes:

Har Gow - Shrimp Dumpling - This actually tasted normal, and 4 pieces per order. The size of each dumpling was smaller than you usually get elsewhere.

Crab & Shrimp Dumpling - This was one of my favorites from what we ordered.

Mediocre / Nothing to Write Home About: Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, Steamed BBQ Pork Buns, Chinese Broccoli, Shrimp in Rice Noodle (the rice noodle portion was a bit on the thick side and the shrimp was a little sparse)

Pass: Fried Calamari - this tasted like it had been deep fried yesterday and nuked in the microwave. Not fresh at all. Veggie Dumplings - These actually have shrimp in there, but the veggies and shrimp didn't taste very fresh.

The one saving grace was that it was inexpensive - our bill pre-tip was $65 for 7 people, but you also get what you pay for. The food was edible, but I wouldn't crave this or make a special trip to go here. There are far better places to eat in Vegas.",cSNER_qF_bb1t7kN0kZ44Q,2,0,2,9Jv-Gz4bMKl7IuLq-4-Ixw

Fried Meat Ball = huge here.  A little more of a tang to the meat, but the outside fried mochi was nice, thick, and oily; just the way I like it.

Shrimp wrapped in big noodles = wasn't warm enough; and didn't taste fresh.  Not enough sesame oil

Preserved Duck Egg & Pork Porridge = a little on the thin side, i like my porridge thick, but flavorful w/ no soy sauce needed.

KJ Dim Sum & Seafood is conveniently located near the Valley View entrance of the Rio. Just park outside (assuming that's allowed/available) or in the ""Carnival"" parking garage and it's a quick walk that won't even take you by any slot machines.

Today was the Monday following Easter weekend, and peak lunch was exceedingly busy. I would guess that the vast majority of their clientele today was Chinese tourists. We had a roughly 20-minute wait for a table for two (important: keep the ""raffle"" ticket which the host gives to you). After we were seated, we received a small a la carte menu, which we simply ignored. The dim sum carts arrived promptly.

My favorites today were the cheong fun (rice noodle rolls with shrimp) and the egg tart. The rice noodles were fluffy and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The sauce complemented the dish just right. Make sure they cut it into smaller pieces for you. The egg tart was one of my last bites, and even though I was full (and bored with the other items), my taste buds were thrilled. The flaky crust and hot egg custard that unexpectedly started to melt on the tongue were fantastic.

The chicken feet were pretty good. I'd order them again. The turnip cake was fine, with a bit of a crisp on the outside and enough seasoning throughout that it might be enjoyed on its own. The har gow (shrimp dumplings) were tasty, but the shell was too easily torn apart, making it hard to fish out of the metal container.

That's about all that I'd reorder from today's choices. The shu mai was disappointingly bland for some reason. The shrimp balls were even worse. They were too hard and something was very off about the interior. Either there was too much flour, or the shrimp was too mushy. It just wasn't the typical juicy shrimp interior, and the mayo sauce should not have been wholly necessary to rescue the shrimp. Finally, I'd have to classify the taro dumplings as another letdown. They were smaller than expected, and not as flavorful. I appreciate that they weren't dripping with oil, but that's not why I eat dim sum.

Prices are were $2.28-$3.98 per dish, and $1.00 per person for hot jasmine tea. Service was surprisingly decent, with quick responses to such concerns as lack of soy and XO sauces on the table, requests for a to-go box, and closing the check. All of these were positives, but not enough to outweigh the boredom of the majority of the meal.

KJ Dim Sum just didn't live up to their reputation. This would be a 7/10 if I could rate it that way. I don't get decimals in this 5-star scale, and the disappointments today outweighed the few positives, so I'm saddened but content to round it down. I'd easily stop by again to ask for egg tarts and possibly cheong fun to-go, and that's about it.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,6,3,L6-rkgDTwP5fq728Q8X1rA

When we got there the place was busy and most patrons were asian, great sign! We were seated right away and got bombarded with carts (of course).

Here's a breakdown of what we ended up with:
-har gow
-shu mai
-rice noodles with shrimp
-mushroom dumplings
-char siu bao (steamed pork bun)
-sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf
-xiao long bao
-scallop dumplings

Of what we got here's what I would recommend, xiao long bao, har gow, and mushroom dumplings. The rest where okay and some were not that great. The notable bad dish was the rice noodles with shrimp, which was definitely off. For the noodle dish, usually the shrimp is especially sweet and the noodles are wrapped up but separate. These noodles seemed overcooked because half of the noodles seemed to have fused together.

We get darn good dim sum at home, so this was a little bit of a let down. I'm also tempted to take away another star for service because even though we were seated promptly and got our food quickly it took FOREVER to get our bill and after getting it for someone to take it.

The Yelp secret for KJ is to do the Dim Sum for breakfast or lunch, and to arrive around 10 am, when they open . I have eaten dinner at this location, and agree with my friend Stefany V, that there is better Chinese food for dinner. 

I have found the actual taste of the Dim Sum to be tastier, and fresher than Orchid Garden. I do not think they have as much variety as Orchid Garden, but I feel they serve better quality and better tasting Dim Sum. 

Costwise; they are about the same as Orchid Garden.

Visiting from a smaller city, I would've expected this place to have better dim sum than my hometown, but it was on par.

We were a party of 6 and were seated right away (less than half of the restaurant was filled up), as we had arrived around 11am, which is a bit earlier than the rush. Once we sat down, the cart ladies were quick to come over one right after another to show us their available selections. I have never been to a dim sum restaurant where we got all the dishes we want within minutes. I'm so used to always eyeing carts for everyone's favourite dishes, and even asking the servers for specific dishes. We barely had time to start eating the dishes that were already in front of us, when the cart ladies made their way back to us again. We joked that they might have been on commission, as they were very persistent. We were in and out in less than an hour, which was faster than the shake shack line we were in the night prior.

We had a little time to look around and enjoy the atmosphere.  The restaurant is decorated in bright and cheery reds - red carpet with what appears to be butterflies fluttering about the floor.  The carpet contrasts with the shiny black chairs and the white walls which are covered with large black frames filled with brightly colored pictures and 4 flatscreen televisions.  It's not quite enough to convince you that you're in a sports bar, but they get the job done.

There were four occupied tables near us. At three of the tables the occupants were  speaking Chinese and eating Chinese style (eating rice out of the bowl, and other items off their plates).  I always have more faith in the quality of the food at an ethnic restaurant when at least some of the other customers belong to the ethnic group.  DJ Dim Sum definitely makes the grade in this respect.

We also asked for our sweet & sour soup to come out first (as it should) and yet it came out 2nd and only after we asked our waitress where it was.

Bottom Line: Mediocre dim sum. Disappointing.

Service: Service was okay, but nothing special ... and somewhat slow.

Food:

Rice Porridge(Congee) - Watery, skimpy on the extras (thousand-year-old egg, green onion, etc.).

Steamed Pork Bun (Char Siu Bao) - Okay, but nothing special.

Steamed Pork Spareribs in Black Bean Sauce - Okay, but again nothign special, very fatty.

Chicken Feet - Mediocre, lacking in flavor, possibly underseasoned.

Rice Wrapped in Bamboo Leaves (Zong Zi) - Very mediocre, somewhat bland and mushy.

Fried Shrimp Ball - Mediocre, lacking in flavor, very dense, and not crispy.

We were seated immediately and offered beverages (water and hot tea). The carts were slow to visit our table, but it was forgiven after I finally got some food in my belly. It was a bit difficult to understand the employees describing items, but fortunately I knew what I wanted. It did create an issue when I asked questions or requested specific items and I received the wrong information or wrong items. I asked three times if the cart had TURNIP Cake and I was given Taro Cake without realizing it. I asked for Shrimp Shumai, but I was given Shrimp Ha Gao. I asked for Char Siu Bao and I got a confused look. It felt like they weren't even listening or attempting.

Anyway, we really enjoyed the Char Siu Bao, Shanghai Dumplings, Shrimp Ha Gao, Fried Shrimp Wanton, Turnip Cake, Beef Rice Noodle, Chow Mein, and Baked Salty Egg Yolk Cream Bun. They were all SO, SO delicious. Extremely filling, but I could've just kept eating.

The prices are wonderful as well and just such a fun atmosphere. I love small plates type of eating, no matter the cuisine. Yum!

DO NOT COME HERE FOR DIM SUM!!!!  I REPEAT...DO NOT!  

My family and I frequent this place regularly for dim sum.  But yesterday was the last and dual final time I will be coming here.  

1st - they now charge $1 per person for tea, which normally I wouldn't mind, I understand tea gets expensive and can add up.  But the jasmine tea tasted like hot water with a hint of color to it, no Jasmine taste what so ever. 

Service is slow and servers all looked unhappy. I'm Chinese, and trust me I'm used to Asian restaurants with bad or no service, it just comes with dining at an Asian restaurant. Especially Chinese.  But this has got to be the worst I've had in a long time. 

Sat down, was asked what kind of tea would you like. Not aware $1 per person. I ordered the stream rice rolls with cilantro n green onion with the server.  15 minutes went by, not a single food cart. Entire restaurant 4 carts, steam cart, congee cart, miscellaneous food,  and Chinese broccoli cart.  The ladies were pushing them like the wheels were broken or something!  Finally the stream cart came by. We ordered 8 dishes my Mom, boyfriend, n myself) figured we load up since it took so long.  The same cart with the same food came by 3 times after that, no new items.  I asked for steamed tripe, and shrimp rice rolls and she looked around at the other carts and said ""I don't have it.""  

I finally get my order of cilantro and green onion rice roll, only to see a plan ol' plate of steam rolls, no herb. I told the lady I wanted cilantro n green onion. She walked up to the waitress that I placed my order with and told her next time not to write the word white in the order, white means plan. The waitress then comes over to the table and says, ""the lady just started working a few days ago so she made the mistake. We have to make your another one.""  In the meantime, no other carts came by but the 4 carts that had nothing that sparked my interest. Asked for egg custard tarts, nothing. Not a single one to be found. As time pasted, I got more and more frustrated as I watched the lady bring out cilantro green onion rice rolls to all the other tables that were seated AFTER us!  The table next to us had 5 orders of egg tarts delivered to their table.  So I decided to place one order and ask for the check...we were fed up at this point. 

The waitress took the check to tally up and added the order of egg custard to the bill.  She came back and said 15 minutes wait for the egg tarts.  So damn frustrated I said NO!  I can't wait anymore, I have to leave now (by now it's 90 minutes).  She walked away, went up to the cashier, came back n said ok 6 minutes ok because she already added the tarts on your bill.  I finally said fine and agreed.  15 minutes later...no tart in sight and the waitress kept dodging our table because she knew I was trying to get her attention.  Finally got her attention and she went to get them. I felt played for a fool.  

$50 later and we were all still some what hungry. Because of this almost 2 hour lunch, I was almost late to work.

Food- everything I have tried was fresh and yummy. I personally love leek and taro, so I really enjoy their leek items here. I have the following list that I order every time I go.

1.Teochew Dumplings (????)-- I enjoy their Teochew dumplings every time I go. This is a dumplings with clear noodle wrap and filled with leek, water chestnut and pork.  
2.Pan fried Leek Dumplings(???)--love their pan fried leek dumplings as well. It's perfectly made with enough leek and meat to make it juicy not dry.
3. Shrimp in rice noodle wrap (???)-- this dish tastes the same at most dim sum places you go but their shrimp is a decent size. This item is on a must list whenever I go to dim sum as well.
4. Fried Taro pastries -- the crunchiness of the outside and the moist/ soft taro inside, yummy!!!! This dish is not a dessert, the taro inside is seasoned with salt and other stuff. 
5.Shumei -- their shumei is decent. I would say it's better than most places in Vegas but somehow I still love shumei from Jasmine inside of Bellagio the best. 
6.Shrimp dumplings/ Haogow-- it's also a must ordered dish when I go to dim sum. It's not too bad here also. 
7. Sticky rice wrapped in leaf -- I love sticky rice and this dish here is decent as well. Definitely give it a try.
8.Pineapple Buns -- I order this item from time to time. They have green tea flavor now which is different and interesting.
9. Tofu Dessert soup -- I love tofu and they are very generous with the portion. Silky tofu in ginger and sugar soup. Yummy.
10. Last not least. The famous Egg Tarts -- I love love love their egg tarts here. Majority of time when I ordered, it's hot and fresh like they just came out of oven. I have not tried egg tarts from golden gate bakery but this is one of the best that I tried before. Although I do wish they have Portuguese egg tarts here! 

Services-- they are usually busy so they are not as attentive as I would like them to be but they are usually very friendly even though you don't speak Cantonese. Unlike some other places in town, if you don't speak Cantonese In a Cantonese restaurants, you get some kind of attitude :/. 

Environment -- the place is big and clean. Also its got many TVs in here.

The YELPY Version:

Yesterday afternoon, my friend and I decided to give the new KJK a try, and was delighted by how good its dimsums (we had 4 different kinds, at $1.50-$3.60 each) and the ""Seafood Noodles"" ($15) tasted! Happy to report that our dimsums were as good as those we had in the best of Chinese dimsum restaurants, and the noodle dish the same quality as that from the ORIGINAL KJK in Chinatown. For our wonderful afternoon meal, the tab was $28, including Tea and Tax.

By the way, the quantity of the dishes was pretty good, too. After all those tasty dimsums, as delicious as the plate of noodles was, we could not finish it, we flipped a coin for the leftover, and darn, my friend won the toss and took it home!

This huge restaurant was ~80% full around 2pm, and we were not surprised. My friend and I are regulars of the original KJK, and we will definitely frequent the NEW one as well - when we have a craving for dimsums and/or want to dine in a more ""plush"", upscale setting.

Although this NEW KJ Kitchen opened only very recently in Rio Casino, its ORIGINAL location in Chinatown has been a favorite for local Asians (and some smart and some ""Well Informed"" Westerners) for years - for its very tasty Chinese dishes at reasonable prices. That small, popular (thus) crowded, original KJK in Chinatown was not well known to most tourists other than those lucky Asians from Los Angeles, however, perhaps because it is NOT listed on the TripAdvisor Network? Now, the NEW KJK in Rio will be a TREAT to the TOURISTS, as well as to the LOCALS! In addition to its traditional, great tasting Chinese dishes that it is famous for, the NEW KJK also offers a variety of delicious dimsums, all at moderate prices, which the original KJK does not.

Good & Bad......

Good:

 - Food was absolutely amazing and quite authentic based on the vast experience of my companion.  Recommend the salty fish fried rice with scallops and made with egg whites....fresh and light tasting, super delicious....added the Salt & Pepper Squid, also amazing taste and perfect texture....Also the Chicken with Scallions and Ginger....supper yummy.  More than enough food for two.

Needs Improvement:

- Service, probably what you should expect from an authentic Chinese restaurant, abrupt and efficient with little personality.
- Pricing, a bit steep even for Vegas, and while the service does not live up to the cost, the food does.

Overall, the experience was very hit and miss.  The food is so good that you reluctantly overlook all the rest of the deficiencies. 

Looking around while we were there the large number of groups of Chinese patrons, literally 90+% of the fair number of people there for dinner, made it obvious this is authentic Chinese food.

I could go on with examples, but overall, just remember you are there for the food and nothing else....it is worth dealing with a less than traditional American dining experience to partake in the delicious creations coming from the kitchen.  Yes you will curse me and or yourself for the unorthodox service experience you just got.....but at the end of the meal you will be so happy you ate there and the next day you will want to return to suffer through it all over again for the food.",09bgQ_LuYbXkfvKsWmWXvg,0,0,4,5-D9ZFHnKMb9rCfhImyBMQ

There were some ""BEST-Ive-had"" dim sum items here!

For example, the Roast Duck. Easily the best I've had at dim sum! Skin was crispy, meat was tender and flavorful. Awesome!  You can find better if you look REALLY hard in Chinatown, but for dim sum, there has been no close second!

The Fried Shrimp Balls. These were easily the BEST I've had! I really don't know how they get ALL that flavor inside, but they are awesome!  Seriously, I have NEVER ordered items to take to-go...usually dim sum is oily and gross reheated....THIS was my first time, and surprisingly, they were actually good the second time around too LOL!

Salt and Pepper Squid. Another winner! This was soo good...so much flavor here, and much better than the shimp version!  If you like this kind of dish, do yourself a favor and order it :P

Shu Mai. This was very tasty and better than the others I've had before. Lots of flavor in the shrimp!  

Cha Siu Bao. These were tasty, but very small compared to all the others I've had before. Still one of my favorites! 

Egg Custard Buns...So good!  Again, very small portions, but they pack tons of flavor inside! This version was a little more ""runny"" inside than most. 

And remember to finish off with the Sweet Tofu! It is a tasty rendition here :)

Got a new favorite in town!

But I go in around 10, the place is really dead, and I try to order. The guy looks at me like I'm an idiot and says Dim Sum is only mornings. ""We're authentic"" he says with an attitude normally reserved for the French.

Fair enough, I think. I've been to China, I know the drill. This is traditionally a morning thing, although they didn't give me grief when I was in Hong Kong asking for it for a later lunch, but whatever, we're going authentic here.

It would seem that the authenticity ends with the serving times, because the food was about as authentic as Panda Express. I'll say it falls more between PF Changs and Panda Express, but I don't think you'll find any Chinese willing to use the word authentic to describe any of those establishments either. 

To be frank, the food kinda sucked. And the service was practically non-existent. The food came out quick, which is good, but keep in mind no one else was ordering. But then it got dropped off, no asking if everything's cool, and the guy then heads back to a table where the servers seem to be eating their dinner. 

It's cool, I know everyone has to eat, but I don't think I'm being overly snobby to say that if our waiter is taking his dinner break, give us another waiter. After a 5 minute attempt to politely get his attention, I finally got up to retrieve a bottle of soy sauce myself. Not the end of the world, but not the type of service one would expect for a $60 dinner for two. 

Getting the check was a near similar hassle, but thankfully I was able to divert his attention away from the big TV long enough to drop that off. 

Oh, and you know how when you get fortune cookies, not here, they're to ""authentic"" for such Tom Foolery, but at other low quality places? You know that thin strip of paper inside the cooke that was your fortune on it? That's about the amount of lobster in their ""lobster"" egg rolls. 

The place blows. If you're in Vegas looking for a decent Chinese place, as a local I'd recommend Red 8 in the Wynn. It's not really any more expensive, it's much nicer, the servers are top notch, bordering on hovering, and the food is genuinely authentic, and fantastic. Tell them I sent you, and get a free blank stare of non-recognition. But seriously, that's the place for Chinese here in town.",JOR6G--IM6p9ltgyU25gWg,1,0,2,thukD9JD2NxhDyEvgaNc_A

Most certainly not a connoisseur of dim sum but having now visited a handful of the reported 'best' in North America from Toronto to Vancouver/Richmond and down to the San Gabriel Valley it was with high hopes that I entered KJ Dim Sum at The Rio alongside a friend and with the restaurant packed to overflowing with Asians both local and visiting the carts and service that awaited rendered an admirable effort the sorts of which many would have you believe cannot be found in Las Vegas.  Admittedly a 'standardized' menu featuring solid renditions of the classics but little innovation it would be easy for me to dock points for issues such as tepid duck or small, slightly overcooked shrimp but taking into account the nature of cart service compared to the menu style common to the elite of the SGV or BC nearly every dish we selected was nicely prepared and ample in portion, the total bill for 11 selections ringing in at $45 before tax and tip.  Speaking to specific must orders, particular favorites particularly well done would include both the baked salty egg yolk buns and the even more impressive steamed version of the same, but most of all the golf-ball sized crispy shrimp balls served along semi-sweet Chinese mayo sauce - the rich, supple interior so good a second order for 'dessert' proved mandatory.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,3,3,w0zchmUFG79Qh83cajhreQ

We got har gow, siumai, chicken feet (I don't eat feet of any animal), roast duck, shrimp wontons, baked cha siu bao, steamed cha siu bao (BBQ pork buns), crispy shrimp roll, salt and pepper shrimps, egg custard, shrimp balls, calamari and sweet tofu. My favorites were: roast duck, shrimp balls and sweet tofu - they have the best version of these dishes in town. I've had sweet tofu that has a strong ginger flavor...KJ's version is just right.

Wasn't anything unusual.  Ordinary dim sum.  We did order one order of chow mein and one order of chow fun.

Do not come to early because the all food might not be ready yet, do not come too late otherwise there might not be anything left.

Beware of the flood gates. When you do come around the before mentioned time, the thongs of antsy Chinese people will bum rush the hostess stand. Get your number and back away slowly. No one needs to get hurt. Stand too close to the podium and you will get stampeded. 

It is hard to go wrong when you come with a group of eight people, load up the lazy susan and still walk away with a relatively small bill.

The food: all the classics are solid. Har gow, shu mai, chicken feet, veggies in bean curd wrappers, pan fried noodles, and veggies sauteed with garlic are all tasty. The desserts are the star here.

Shumai: *two thumbs up*

Dan tat: We got it fresh...but definitely less egg yolk than other places. I like my dan tat really yellow otherwise they taste more like cream than anything

When we got there at 11 am, it wasn't too busy. There were three parties ahead of us to be seated. They gave us a number. One of the members in the party after us must speak the language because he was right next to the hostess and kept asking her about when they would be seated. The next thing I know, our number was skipped and they got seated. We thought maybe it's because they have a bigger group and it was a bigger that table came available. Then she started seating other people that came after us. My husband told her that she skipped our number and then she seated us. (2) Little variety. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant with a large aisle. The whole time we were there, the same two carts came through. I asked one of the ladies if they had chicken feet. Instead of saying that she can have the person come over, she said ""later"". Later never came. (3) Service is poor. It was hard to flag down a waiter for refills or for questions. Once they seat you, the waiter does not come back to check on you. When we were done with being disappointed in the food and service and ready to leave, we could not get the attention of a waiter to check us out. My husband gave up and took our check to the register himself to pay it. This is one of the rare time that we did not leave a tip.

The prices, while good for chinese food are not great for dim sum and you won't be able to try 20 different selections unless you want to spend a ton.    The food we ordered was mixed.  The lobster spring rolls had decent chunks of what appeared to be lobster but had no lobster taste to it.  In fact, they were ultra bland.  The walnut shrimp was tasty as was the sizziling seafood which included scallops, calamari, an unidentifyable fish, shrimp and more.  The sweet and sour pork was also lacking in flavor but was not overly soggy.  They are less than generous on the rice portions.

Located inside the Rio, across from the Carnival World Buffet, this Cantonese cuisine restaurant that's been opened for only two months offered just what we needed: delicious and better yet, reasonably-priced dim sum for lunch.

Of the things we tried, shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, tripe, beef wrapped in flat rice noodle, tofu flower dessert, pan-fried shrimp and chive dumplings, they all tasted absolutely fabulous, maybe even exceeding the flavors of some dim sum restaurants in San Francisco. 

My only gripe is that if you are a solo non-native diner, the cart ladies may easily pass you up. You really have to be assertive if you want them to stop by your table.

Hubby dug up a nugget from his memory bank and suddenly remembered that a coworker of his had mentioned this place and said it wasn't bad.  I guess ""it wasn't bad"" was good enough for us to defect from the buffet line.

And honestly...it wasn't bad.  It's exactly the same as all the other dim sum places we've had in Orange County:

- Hit or miss dishes (some dishes were overcooked so the skin on the dumplings were way too soggy)
- No service for the meek.  Speak up (raise your hand) or you'll sit there without hot sauce, soy sauce or iced water the entire time
- Semi-aggressive sales ladies trying to get rid of their wares

No one dish really stood out except maybe the stir fried rice noodles which didn't come with much except scallions and onions (no meat) and cost $6.95.  We happily packed up the leftovers and had it in front of the TV later.

Waiter #3 came back and asked if we wanted the Pan Fried Noodles Cantonese style...crispy dry noodles on bottom and sauce on top? I said yes, that's the way I like it.
The Mushu came out very quickly. It was love at first bite. I can honestly say it was the best tasting Mushu I have ever had. Flavors were perfectly balanced, sauce was light and both the meat and veggies tasted fresh. A delight!
 Waiter #3 returned to ask if I was sure that's how we wanted the Pan Fried Noodles reminding me it was dry at the bottom and sauce on top...I said I was sure. Then he came back one more time to ask if we needed silverware...we said no, we are fine with chopsticks.
The Pan Fried Noodles came out rather readily thereafter. They were wonderful as well. The noodles were tasty,slightly browned on the bottom and crispy throughout until the top sauce softened them. The sauce was again perfectly balanced in flavors and very light. We told the waiter that everything was really good and he nodded politely. They are not big conversationalists here but are quiet and polite. Either way, the food was superb.
 I heard quite a bit of yelling in the kitchen and they seemed to be well staffed with servers and runners and it did look like maybe they were putting forth managerial effort to keep the kitchen from getting backed up. There were a lot of Asian diners and I believe the wait staff is trying to make sure that non-Asians know what they are getting. Some people are upset if it not like American take out Chinese food...and it's not...much more authentic...and it is really good...and I will definitely return.",tOZSL8plD7JGsa_A-ZKiNg,1,0,5,waZrnb6d87tNh6y2ETlLWA

Sticky rice in lotus leaves: Check 
Rice noodle in shrimp: Check

Service: Really nice for the most part, except the hostess asked if I wanted a lunch menu and never came back with one though she did apologize after remembering 20 min later.  Also, they added jasmine tea to my bill then removed it after I told them I didn't order or receive any tea

Overall a really impressive experience for a large Casino Chinese place, though I don't really mind driving to Chinatown and I hardly go or stay at the Rio so it's not that more convenient.

$1 charge/person for tea... that's actually average so I didn't dock points for that.

Food...  sigh.  This is where the problem is.  Being Asian and knowing what dim sum is supposed to taste like... sigh.  There were a lot of Asians in here (Asians, not Asian-Americans... yes, I mean fobs :P)... but that's probably because they were craving food from the motherland.

The shu mai... bland, small, and the texture was just kind of weird.   Rather than small chunks of shrimp/pork... it was like they just threw pork and shrimp in and processed it together...

The chicken feet was not bad.  But it wasn't as soft as I like.  Maybe that's a preferential thing.  It felt like it wasn't that fresh.  Maybe that was the problem with the texture.

Spare ribs with black beans.  Again, flavorless.  It was the typical meat:fat ratio you get at most cheap dim sum restaurants (read: cheap, high fat, low in meat).  But again, the meat itself was very bland.

My buddies had the rice noodle wrapped in shrimp, i opted to just try the rice noodle wrapped in bbq pork.  The rice noodles weren't bad, but the meat... lets just say I think the meat:fat ratio was again off (read: STOP FEEDING ME SO MUCH FAT!!!)  This was also very flavorless.

We got the bbq pork buns.  My buddies did not seem to enjoy that either... and they eat anything.

To sum it up:  I think this restaurant was catered towards non-Asians.  Food lacked bold Asian flavors typically savored and it was a huge disappointment.  I think the dim sum that they offer in the Rio World Buffet would've more satisfied my craving.  And no, I'm not exaggerating on that.",Jndb3IoOrN-xj1QFxvKAcA,3,0,1,Gv6qOMDCUc3045kT0gySnw

Let's get one thing straight:  This is not an average Chinese restaurant.  The place is pretty decent in terms of size and has the patience to deal with people that don't really have that patience.  I seriously admire the service staff for putting up with people don't have patience.  They are quick, friendly, and extremely hospitable and that goes without saying that this is the most important aspect of a restaurant.

Food is awesome.  How awesome you say?  Well besides the traditional types of dimsum, you also have to count this restaurant for dinner.  I've had some pretty interesting experiences as well as some nostalgic ones.  You have classic stir fried dishes like Kung pao, as well as individual dishes like crispy chow mein with gravy.  Though that is more of the American side of Chinese cooking, there are some delight-able treats that they have here for an authentic Chinese palate.  I hate to say if anything is truly better than anything else, but they have the best steamed chinese fish that I've ever had and let me remind you that I am a VERY picky eater.  Be warned though, the price is expensive (40 USD for a pound).

They run out of dim sum almost every day. The sooner they run out, the sooner they can charge for full meal orders. There are better dim sum houses in the Bay Area and LA. It can be extremely busy. On all 3 of my visits, most of the patrons were asian, speaking several dialects of Chinese. That was taken as a good sign, as dim sum is of Chinese origin. 

Food
Although the menu is pretty big, the food is average to pretty good. The entrée  recommendations are roasted duck (1/2 serves 2 people), #4 fried beef rice noodles, and sautéed beef with orange, extra crispy. I haven't tried the soup but it didn't look great. Dim sum highlights are short ribs, BBQ pork buns, crispy shrimp balls, and egg tarts. I can't really recommend anything else. The rest is ok. 

Service
When busy, the chaos sends the staff into panic mode and anything can happen. The manager, an older Asian man speaking Cantonese and Mandarin, in a dress shirt and Lacoste sweater vest was rude to people in at least 3 languages. Our server was a nice woman from Hong Kong. Many of the bus staff seemed slow to help and quick to argue with other staff. 

It's a fun place to watch people, staff and customers when it is busy. There's always some little drama. For the best value, go early for dim sum. Be prepared to wait. Try only recommended dishes.

It is located right across from the Rio's Carnival Buffet, so if you paid too much attention to the line of people waiting for the buffet, you might have to bust a U-ey like I did earlier today.

The dim sum selection is pretty vast.  They have all the usual popular dim sum items and some rare gems (highly recommend #32 Baked Salty Egg Yolk Cream Bun is a nice dessert to finish off your meal, but we also used it as our intermission break).

The food were hot every time we ordered it off the dim sum cart and the servers were friendly and timely in refilling tea pots, getting us extra hot sauces and napkins, and clearing away empty plates.

Overall, the food was good. Perhaps not as great as the top dim sum destinations up and down California.
