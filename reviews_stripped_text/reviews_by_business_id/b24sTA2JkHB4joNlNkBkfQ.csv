The chicken tenders are hand battered and they actually give you a very generous sized portion of protein. Chicken tenders are my favorite cheat meal when I am dieting, so I eat them alot and the ones here are my favorite.

The one thing you can skip here is the breakfast..seriously $10 for a generic plate of reheated stuff. You can do better then that Venetian! I had the bisuits with gravy and sausage, and it reminded me of the free stuff I get from the complimentary breakfast at the holiday inn!

In here, you have a cafe, pizza stop, gelato, and San Gennaro Grill.  My choice was simple, nothing with red meat or pork.  I ended up with their Chicken Philly Cheese Steak.  Even though Steak is in the name of the meal, there isn't any steak.  The meal came with fries for about $12.  The fries were  okay, but you wouldn't know it because I killed it.  As for the chicken philly, it totally hit the spot.  Melted cheese, mushrooms, and green peppers covered my chicken.  I thought it was also seasoned well.  My only issue was the green peppers. I love green peppers but should have requested them on the side since there was so much of it that it over-powered the taste of the chicken and mushrooms.  

The food does take a little time or they take their little time to cook it.  When I first arrived, all I saw was a bunch of people sitting at tables doing nothing.
