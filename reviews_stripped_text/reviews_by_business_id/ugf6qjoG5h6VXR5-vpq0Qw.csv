I've worked for the industry in Vegas for almost 3 years and it is so refreshing to find servers and service of these quality. Going to firefly, we are helping our local community by investing more in our local business. It is a versatile place to dine out, either for a date, friends, or even family reunion. I am latina and firefly is THE only place in vegas that offers a tasteful place to enjoy latin american culture. I hate to hear people bad-mouthing these great restaurants, but plz keep in my these are ignorant people. Before any out there start pointing fingers, check your own kitchen and how you prepare you on own food, there are more chances that you will get food poison in your own kitchen, than in Firefly. Media is just taking advantange that Firefly is a place loved by locals and they are just making money out bad publicity. I can speak for my friends n myself that i will go back to firefly as much as I always do ( which is twice a week, every week) no matter what.

It made my birthday even better.

Whether they're hot or cold, their tapas are graciously portioned and reasonably priced. The Firefly fries are such a tongue twister to say, but simply delicious and full of crispy, parmesan-covered potato goodness. I'm also a fan of the mushroom tart, mac and cheese, and the bread. Oh, the bread with its honey chipotle butter or whatever that is. Just keep it coming!

Their watermelon mojito was just balanced and refreshing. I didn't quite like the pomegranate drink with the lillet blanc, and it's precisely because of the aperitif wine that was mixed in. Just haven't acquired a taste for wine yet, so don't let my opinion sway you against ordering it.

For a Friday night, the place was packed, but the service was excellent and the dishes came out in a timely manner. They're definitely on top of their game. Parking can definitely be an issue, so try and carpool if possible. No reservations on Fridays and Saturdays, but hey, more reason to come early for their happy hour right?

Now that I've got a new go-to place, I absolutely would love to try out more of their menu and grab a drink with coworkers or spend a night out with the girls.",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,4,1,5,yLC7tL8szLcSbMbUw7AicQ

173632,2011-11-24,1,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"Felt like having tapas and had read good things about Firefly.  Thought we'd give it a try.  

We had used open table to make reservations and when I checked in with the hostess she said ""for Jen?""  Yup, that's me.  Thought that was nice. They asked us to sit and wait for a bit because the people prior to us hadn't left our table yet.  After about 5 mins the decided to sit us elsewhere which I thought was nice.

The food was very very good. The average price I would say is about $6 per plate.  Some are $7, some $10, some $4. We had 7 different plates and the dates and the lobster escargot were the fav's at the table.  I had the Red Sangria which had a flavor that I wasn't expecting and I didn't care for it.  I ordered the White Sangria instead and sadly, still didn't like it. Of course I cannot let alcohol go to waste so I drank it anyway!  We also ordered the Padron Peppers.  I love these peppers and they say that 1 in every 100 actually contains some heat.  It must have been my lucky day; I should have hit the casinos.  The ones I was lucky enough to choose were friggin' hot!  Hot as in burning my mouth and getting the hiccups level of hot. Getting the hiccups while at a nice restaurant is something I would like to avoid going forward. One person at our table loves super hot anything and she loved them!  I did like them and which I could have had more but I just couldn't do that do my mouth anymore.  

I deducted one star because of the sangria.  The server was great, food was wonderful, decor very contemporary.  Would definitely go back.  Total bill for 3 people including tip was $112.",F9qyc6w1D2fsvIl0upQEGA,1,1,4,FTwrOw-fuE1U9tfZtGb93A

1)Firefly is....
A.) a delicious mouth watering tapas and sangria experience that you can't miss out on....

2) I would rather...

A.) GO to Firefly the delicious mouth watering tapas and sangria experience that you can't miss out on..

For question one if you answered  ""A""  you are correct!
For question two if you answered ""A"" you are correct.!

See I told you this would be easy. You had nothing to worry about my little foodie scholars. Now, lets get down to business.

Firefly Tapas Kitchen and Bar is one of the hottest spots to eat in town. From their wide selection of hot & cold tapas to their delicious I repeat DELICIOUS sangria. 

Firefly is very family style. Not so much as in large meals as it is having everyone order two different tapas to pass around and share. So, my family and I ventured here the other night. 

We ordered ALOT. My goal was to be in  food coma by the end of the night. (mission accomplished)

I loved and adored the following menu items.

Smoke Salmon: This was such a delightful tapas. You really can't go wrong with this choice and I don't even like salmon.  It had a very fresh 
summery taste. Very Barefoot Contessa esque.

Ahi Tuna Skewer: Oh my lanta. We ordered 2 plates of these little guys. Mariniated  with mango, basil, mustard-ginger glaze, it is so good you may want to eat the skewer is came on... not that I tried. They are cooked rare, but you can't taste the rarity of the ahi tuna. The red wine reduction really completes the dish.

Stuffed Dates: Ay yi yi! This is possibly one of my favorite things to eat on Earth. The bacon-wrapped, smoked almonds, with a nice red wine reduction and stuffed with a bit of blue cheese.  This dish I recommend to hide when it comes to the table...most likely on your lap under your napkin. This isn't something you want to share.

Manchego Mac& Cheese- also may want to hide under
 your napkin.

Paella - They bring this puppy out in the pan. 
Saffron rice, clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage don't tell me you don't want to take  bite of that!
If you really don't want to take a bite of that...lie to me please. You'll hurt my feelings.

FIREFLY FRIES: This is one of their signature dishes. My favorite fries on the planet. Fries mixed with herbs and topped with Parmesan cheese. Then with the magical aioli (garlic mayonnaise) on the side?!? This is one of those things you eat and you cant stop saying mmmmm and mid chew looking at the person with you and saying ""THIS IS SO GOOD"" 

These dishes you cannot pass up. We ordered more however, none of them can compare to these 4. I'll leave it up to you to take your taste buds on an adventure different from mine..

Now for the GRAND FINALLY!  It is what you have all been waiting for.

SANGRIAAAAA

It is a crime not order  pitcher of Firefly Sangria. You can order Red, White, or Sparkling Sangria. We ordered all 3. Don't judge me. Sparkling is my absolute favorite. It is so light and airy while it trickles down your throat. You will just die and go to heaven with one or two glasses.
Fun Fact: They marinate the sangria's for three days before serving it. So you know you are getting the absolute best sangria in the city hands down. 

  My  Tips
1.) Try and go early on the weekends. Firefly is always busy but weekends are the worst. 
2.) Order the paella as soon as you can. It takes 45 min. to make, but well worth the wait.

So my time is up. I've got nothing left to say. Actually I always do. You know me to well. I'll leave you with this.... If you don't eat at firefly, you ain't livin doll. 

All my love...from my heart & belly.",T0ua11LxP335TfFsuawbNw,6,4,5,Q_5juGOdWT6Kq1Hv86qCQw
200294,2012-07-17,0,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"The other reviews were right on with the red sangria ($7), yummy!  Although I thought it was on the strong side, which is fine by me.

Smoked Salmon Toasts ($7)- raw salmon layered on top on wheat toast topped with dill dressing and capers.  Oh yeah, these were yummy.  This tapa seemed to provide the most bang for your buck.

Bacon wrapped dates($4-5)- You want to order these!  They were the best tapa we ordered.

Ham and Cheese Croquets ($5-6)- 3 fried little things that were the most unhealthy thing we ordered and were my least favorite.  Not very cheesy and did not have much ham in them.

Spicy Shrimp ($?)- Cooked to perfection and were not terribly spicy.

The waitstaff was very attentive.  Our waiter was able to split our check three ways with credit card, which was helpful.

I wouldn't recommend this type of dining to parties less than two.  It's family-style dining, so you would want to go with at least three people.  I'm not sure this place is for manly men, lol, being that the portions are small and aren't meal-like.  It's a great place for us ladies, though.

It is on the pricey side, about $20-30 a person.",lXAIuBWT0fvt3uAw-shh8A,0,0,4,vTV2XEf6wqSz9O0aWkfZlw
217582,2012-12-10,2,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"As good as it gets in Las Vegas....

If there is one item on the menu that I would highly recommend to anyone eating at the restaurant for the first time, it would be stuffed dates. The plate consisted of dates wrapped in bacon in a pool of smoked almond, red wine reduction and topped with blue cheese. What an interesting combination, but, boy were they MARVELOUS. You know the climactic moment of sex when your body quivers and eyes roll back. After one bite, you will have the same sensation. Trust! That good. Haha.... A+

Other tapas we tried:

Tuna Tartare - cubes of marinated ahi tuna, topped with avocado; taro chips on the side for slight contrast. My second favorite dish. They were not stingy as they served a hefty portion of ahi tuna. Fresh fish and crunchy taro chips were a perfect combination. A

Firefly Flies - cut fries sprinkled with parmesan cheese & fresh herbs, served with aioli sauce. Nothing to rave about. The aioli sauce had some kick to it. B

Thai Beef Salad - seared beef with all the works drizzled with thai dressing. Did not choose this dish. Beef was seared to perfection. Dressing had some zing to it. B

We had a couple other dishes that were delish. Cannot remember the names, though.

Besides the awesome food, we ordered a couple pitchers of their house brewed white sangria. At first, I did not like it. Then, the more I ate, the bitterness went away. The bits of sweet mango on the bottom of the pitcher neutralized the sharp/tartness of the drink. B+

The ambiance was loud and intimate. The lighting was dim and dark red (hence, Firefly). Decor was simple. B+

Service was stellar. Forgot his name, but, he was attentive and recommended in detail the best tapas on the menu. A-

Bottom Line:
My experience certainly exceeded expectations. The stuffed dates wrapped in bacon alone gives this restaurant an A in my book. Firefly will definitely be a regular stopover any time I visit Vegas.",we8xobdZHc_K-VZ7lMbDmA,2,2,5,-Q_IB3co3A0yavcWrXASSQ

There were only three other people at the bar and I asked them to watch a different game and the bartender said that the other people were watching these. They definitely were not watching any of the games, so we decided to leave.

A couple weeks later, we came back for lunch and the service was horrible. It took forever for our drinks to just get ordered. When we finally ordered the food, they didn't even tell us what they were putting on the table. As for the food...eh. This is pretty heavy tapas, so be ready for that.

Don't miss a plate of the Padron peppers... roasted and doused in olive oil and sea salt. My favorite was the shrimp diablo... grilled and hot in a delectable sauce that was just the right burn. Stuffed chicken and chorizo mushrooms were awesome as well as the phyllo topped sauteed mushrooms in a lite cream sauce, The empenada actually seemed mundane after the myriad of flavors the other dishes had! Wait staff was efficient... serving the  plates taking and taking away the finished ones at an appropriate pace.

As a service industry worker myself i will give slack to the waitstaff/bartenders if they are busy. We had a party there just for 7 people there last week...we were told 25 minutes for a table. it ended up being over 1 hour.  The mngr did notice our wait time and did get us a pitcher of sangria (which is amazing) and sat us as quick as he could. Once sat our server made us feel rushed so he could turn and burn the table.  Again, as an industry person myself...i do understand turn and burn. But not after waiting over an hour for a table.

we decided again to go there after a couple of days to celebrate a family members 21st birthday. What were we thinking?  i get there to set up balloons...it was like pulling teeth to let them let me go to the table. (half of the party needs to be there to sit) all i wanted was to set up balloons. Next, once sat we sat there 5 minutes...10 minutes...15 minutes finally comes and I had to go back to the hostess stand to ask if we had a server. Hostess laughed like i was joking.  She tracked down our server...he looked at our table and he was shocked that he actually had us. HMMMM.....if you run a restaurant you need to hire people that understand where there SECTION is!!!!!  Finally....we were getting service. The mngr on duty who was different than a cpl days before came up to us and apologized for the delay of service because one of his waitstaff had to go to the hospital and they were short staffed.  OK, i understand being short staffed but dont tell your customers why.  Anyways, he offered the 21 year old a shot.  That was very kind....except he took 2 shots with her. I wasnt aware that managers can take shots during a shift. I know i cant when im on shift as a bartender!

The only things good at this Firefly is the sangria and food. Dont go there if you want good service thats for sure.",U5jd_Q4yB870L2dF89-r8Q,0,0,2,RvoPdK9zlHkP92SDO7IhuA

Right away I loved the decor and the giant fireplace in the bar.  The Staff is amazing and efficient.  Firefly reminded me how much I do love tapas - 2 nights in a row.  The bar is great and comfortable with plenty of high tops, but they also boast a large heated patio.

Any tapas place worth it's weight should have outstanding Sangria in both varieties - and Firefly delivers.  My favorite was the sparkling White Sangria - it was refreshing, fruity and superb.

As for the small plates, we sampled the following:
Tierra Y Mar Skewers - the sausage is the most outstanding tidbit.
Empanada - 2x because just one a piece wasn't enough.
Meatballs - or Albondigas as they call them.
Veggie Empanada - delicious, and just as good as the pork.  Maybe better!

The bar was busy, but the bartender looked cool and calm and I had excellent service, he even took the time to go through some of their new wines with me and I ended up trying a malbec that was amazing. I talked with the couple next to me and they come in at least twice a week. They said they even like it better than the one near the strip, which I was surprised to hear. My group finally showed up and we were seated right away. There was eight of us total. Our waiter was so nice and friendly from the moment he walked up to the table. He recommended some of his personal favorite tapas dishes and of course we had several pitchers of the famous sangria. The entire staff was great. from the hostess, the bartender, the waiter, the busser I honestly had no complaints...

enjoyed the croquettes, tomato bread, steak dishes.

The main issue I had with the place and the reason I probably won't return is the front of house service.  I have worked front of house and my husband is a chef so we are familiar with the restaurant flow and professionalism.  The hostess was a ditz that seemed to flirt with every server there.  At one point, she was standing right next to my husband and a server guy started giving her a back massage...it was so awkward for us! And it was our anniversary dinner, to top it off.  The server we had was a bald/shaved head guy who had no personality.  The bussers/runners were great..kept refilling our drinks and checking on us! I wish I could have given the whole tip to them!  The server was preoccupied with flirting with the hostess to even bring our check.  We sat there with empty sangria and water glasses for 10-15 minutes until finally my husband had to walk up to him and ask for the check..in which he didn't even reply to my husband.  He then briskly walked by and threw the check on the table.  Soo disappointing..and it was a slow Monday night!  they seriously need management help there. i saw them on one of those restaurant nightmares shows..and it looks like the FOH has gotten worse.  Now, with the health issues at the Paradise location..I think i'll just stick away.

However, I'll start with the good: ambience. The setting is dark, intimate, and not so loud that you need to shout at the person sitting across the table from you. I imagine this would be a cool place to go later in the evening. I was there for HH and definitely didn't mind the 1/2 priced beers - I'll take a Stella from the tap for $3 any day!

For tapas I went with the the Manchego Mac 'n' Cheese, which was quite good but very rich. I also ordered the Tierra y Mar skewers that include steak, shrimp, and sausage. This is where things took a bad turn. My first bite of the filet mignon was so tough I had to stop and take a second go at it with a knife and fork. For such little pieces of meat I expected more tenderness. The shrimp was just ok, and I really did not care for the spicy flavor of the chorizo sausage. But perhaps my taste buds are just weird. Overall, Firefly gets an initial 3.5 stars. I'll be back to try other tapas on their extensive menu.",lALW6UN3fU2DRaiMzH9kMg,2,2,3,SRDRb4r9mE5cTamNU5Fxug

But we got four items, and that was the only one we both liked. Tuna skewers were bland, the lobster ""escargot"" was just off, and the sliders according to the guy was ""ok.""
Service was also mediocre. Sure money is important, and focusing more on larger parties means better tips, but we tip too!! And sometimes alot more than we really should! We shouldn't have to constantly flag someone down for a refill and we hardly saw our server. We politely asked for more bread, and he looked at us like we were bothering him. =\

558386,2012-05-18,5,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"I would rather not write this review seeing as how i have been a fan of the firefly on paradise road. I have been going there for four years.

So i have only ever worked in this industry. I am 24 years old and work in the back of the house now but i started at 16 as a hosts. I have done every position in the front and back of the house so i know the problems that each can face and i tend to give leeway whenever i go out to eat. but this firefly was another story. 

The food: 
I have nothing bad to say about the food, as always my guests ( in this case my 7 relatives from out of town)  were impressed with the quality of the food. We ordered so many different items and everyone was so happy.

The service:
So our servers name was Mandaline. she was very Rude when i asked her about splitting a check. Then when i asked her to keep track of who had what so it would be easier for us to divide up ourselves at the end of the meal she refused to do that as well. She neglected to take some of our food order, did not hold the desert to be delivered at the end of the meal like 2 of my guests requested,  after taking the food order she never visited the table to check on us even though i specifically told her that we would b ordering another round of tapas. At the end of the meal after my family had had there fill of food the check was presented and we proceeded to attempt to break the check up ourselves (which was extremely difficult seeing as how it is so loud in the restaurant and that despite everything being ordered in groups by the people who wanted to share individual checks the items where all jumbled on the check. When we figured out the check and everyone had paid their portion i handed the check to our server and in a condescending tone she said ""there that wasn't hard was it?"" Had our server been nicer and paid better attention to our table our bill would have been much higher and her automatic gratuity would have been much higher. but there is a price to pay when you want to give bad service. I just hope she reads this review or her manager reads this review so she can take a moment and realize that good service is the cornerstone of a good dining experience. 

I am known by my friends and family to over tip.our automatic gratuity which was applied to the check was 25 dollars. had we received better service the check would have been higher and the gratuity would have been higher. and i would have added on an extra 10 bucks of my own money at least. but thanks to the bad service we received  if the gratuity had not been there i would have left no tip. a tip is a way to thank your server for taking care of you. our server took no steps to take care of us in any way imaginable. 

Conclusion:
Service sucks, food was good as always, but i will not be returning to this location.",VwkOlr_TjA_iRq_Tfo5m4w,0,0,2,3FnJCU7lRJdozQi9aTreFw

It was also busy here but at least we could wait indoors near a fire place. There were some less than optimal seating options near the constantly opening doors that we were crossing our fingers not to get called for. Luckily we got a table not near the doors(patio and front entry way). The service was fantastic, especially compared to my last two visits to the Paradise location. The staff was attentive and friendly. The dishes were mostly good but some were a little different that we expected based on previous experiences at Paradise. Most were as good or better but the Chorizo and Clams was the only one that was WAY OFF. The menu description even stated the sauce was made of white wine yet the sauce here was made of a heavy tomato base and came across more as a pasta sauce. The chorizo was the saving grace as I think it ranks right up there with bacon.

690931,2010-11-03,0,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"I am a lover of the original Firefly (so much so that I was there 3  times in a week and a half recently)- so when I heard the new, much closer location in Summerlin was open- I brought my out of town guests here for some nibbles.

I used to visit this building years ago when it was Z Tejas, and the new decor is right in line with the Firefly brand. Love the painted walls and the layout is not too crowded and not as loud. I would suggest a long communal table- truly Spanish style!

Hostess I called was much friendlier and more helpful than original location, and we had no wait to be seated (a first!) The dinner rush was subsiding, as it was after 9pm, but a fair amount of tables were still there- only a few were empty.

We ordered all of our regular items and most were really good. There is always a learning curve at any new place, and I took that in to account in this review.

Garden Variety Salad- smaller than the original location and not as many ""goodies"" but still very edible!

Boquerones (Anchovy toast)- Good but bread not toasted- had to send back.  Beautiful presentation and this cook likes to use his sauce bottles;)

Artichoke toast- Bread not toasted (really? it's on the menu as toast) and there was a little push back from the waiter when I sent them back to be toasted. Oil and dressing were fanstastic on these- much more flavorful than the original!

Mac n Cheese- excellent!

Stuffed Chilis- Amazing and on par with the original location.

Staff
Waiter had too many tables and wasn't all that attentive. He wasn't as familiar with the menu as I would have hoped- but again, they just opened. Luckily for him, he had good support.

Busboy- AMAZING! If he wasn't trained at the original location, I would be surprised. He was very attentive and bent over backwards to make sure our meal was perfect after we sent back the toast(s).

Manager?- there was someone in a suit flittering around, not sure who he was, but he didn't stop and address the table- only the staff when we sent something back. Would have been nice for him to have received our feedback personally, not just from the staff. No harm done though, and I was glad to see someone was there.

Overall- I can't wait for this place to gain some more experience and really shine! I will go back, I did enjoy the meal and wine and wouldn't hesitate to send friends there, with the caveat that they are still working out the kinks.",1llLRrB6uFwACTleMfoYuA,2,1,3,J5c2ua2JjqQ7js2ZfCDUQg
701853,2011-05-25,0,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"So I came back to Firefly with my two daughters to give this place a second try - and I've got to say, we were blown away!

To start, the service was wonderful, just as it was before. Every time we went through a glass of our drink, it was replaced almost before we even noticed! The waiters were so attentive, and always came in with friendly expressions. We were even able to meet the chef (James), who explained some of the concepts behind the dishes and entertained us. Everything was just perfect as far as service was concerned.
 
And now for the greatness of it all - the food! We really enjoyed some of their signature tapas, such as the skewers with the grilled beef and shrimp (called Terra y Mare skewers on their menu), and the tomato soup with the grilled cheese sandwich (called Tomato basil soup on the menu). And let me tell you- that was no ordinary grilled cheese sandwich! It was simply amazing on its own, and definitely going on my list of favorites! The outside was crispy, the bread was so tasty, and the brie cheese on the inside just completed the deal. We will be craving it again, that's for sure. And for some other tapas that get noteworthy mention: the tuna-stuffed red pepper on a thin taro chip (called Tuna peppers), and the bacon-rolled dates in red wine sauce (called Stuffed dates). The Tuna peppers made any of our apprehensions about cold tapas disappear in an instant- It was tasty, it was fun, and it was wonderful to snack on! And perhaps best of all, it was unique. As for the bacon-rolled dates, you've just got to taste it to believe it- We weren't very fond of dates, until we tried this dish! And that's not to say that it tasted primarily like dates, but actually quite the opposite: it made us realize that it was possible to make dates appeal to people who weren't keen on them to begin with.

As a side note for fans of more traditional food: they make an awesome macaroni and cheese dish. You can't go wrong with it, and it's one of the best mac&cheese dishes we've ever tasted!

And anyways, I think by now, you already get what I'm saying: the tapas here are excellent if you're willing to give them a fair try!

And what I mean by that is: maybe not all of them will match your tastebuds, but you've gotta find those that cater to your taste. And with a selection as varied as that of Firefly, you definitely have a chance at finding ""the one,"" or ""ones"" in our case!

As you may already know: we didn't hit a home run the first time we went to this place, and even had a couple dishes fall through the second time: we didn't dig the spiciness of the spicy shrimp tapas (Camarones a la diabla), nor were we huge fans of the Padron peppers. However, with the fulfillment we received from the other tapas mentioned above, one or two tapas like these were mere bumps in our road to satisfaction.

Finally, we got to taste their specialty Paella. And it was absolutely wonderful. The flavor of the tomatoes and peppers blended with the wholesomeness of the rice, and mixed with our favorite seafood, just made it an absolutely worthwhile dish, that we only wish we could fit into our stomachs. Quick tip: believe the menu when it says it could serve six.

Bottom line: Come with an empty stomach. Try as many items as you can. Leave as a changed person with a satiated appetite and a somewhat wider horizon, wishing you'd done it sooner. And that's all I have to say. Thanks for reading.",I60YrEZoiD1P_2k1C8kp2Q,1,0,5,CaExiwAU5D0wzAAmoJxBxw

We were there during the early portion of happy hour and sat in the bar area where there were couches and low tables.  It was a super loungy feel that I really like.  Towards the end of happy hour the place did get really busy, but the service never suffered.  The pitchers of yummy sangria were half off...so we enjoyed 3 :)  The variety of tapas was superior to many places I have been with a large range of veggie items.  I also liked that there was a range from super inexpensive to fancy...something for every budget.  My favorite was the Manchego Mac and Cheese and the stuffed Pasilla Peppers.  I also really liked the lobster escargot, and I tried the Anchovy toasts that my Dad ordered and actually liked them (I hate Anchovy)...the Anchovy was fresh, and didn't taste or like the Anchovy you get in many dishes or on pizza.  My parents loved the Bacon wrapped Dates (I don't eat bacon so I couldn't partake but they looked and smelled amazing)  They had also brought out complimentary bread with almod butter and green olives that were of super good quality. 

The staff was awesome!  We never had to pour our own Sangria from the pitchers.  As soon as our glasses were getting a little low, our waiter would rush over and fill them up again.  He was really friendly and very attentive, as we ordered just a few plates and finished them before ordering a 2nd and 3rd round.  Our table was also serviced by several other young men who would clear plates or fill water glasses.  There was never that moment during the meal when you are like ""where is the waiter, I need water...or sangria...or food...etc"".  

I don't much like Vegas, but I feel like I will visit my parents more often, just so that we can go to Firefly :)",OA2e5J1J6P6KInt25kwYfA,0,0,5,b9mST8sy72f7gL5ipheDsg

The servers, though also pretty to look at, are an odd bunch.  They sometimes seem downright confused.  I don't think there was a language barrier but definitely some sort of difficulty.  We asked for water and the waiter had no idea what we were aking for.  We tried sign language and pointing to another table's water and he finally understood.  We asked for our check and were delivered three menus.  When we finally got the check and had finished paying, the server brought us someone esle's mac'n cheese.

Pulpo asado- still delicious according to my husband!

Boquerones- Spanish white anchovies with roasted peppers avocado- my husband said its not as good as it used to be.

Veggie empanada- if you like mushrooms, spinach and cream cheese then you will enjoy this. I would order it again

Smoked salmon toasts- If you like smoked salmon then you will enjoy this dish. It was good and tasty!

For example, the Thai beef salad.  The beef tasted good.  But the lettuce was drowning in sauce.  On top of the beef salad, a heap of fried crunchy strips that you find on Chinese Chicken Salad.  Below, there's even more fried crunchy strips SOAKED is sauce.  We ordered this because they don't have many green vegetables on their tapas list.

""vegetables and lentils"" =' carrots and celery.

The boquerones that come with roasted red pepper and yellow pepper ""vin"" is also overpowering.  There's also dotted aioli on the plate.   You can't taste the fish which makes you wonder if the chef and staff hate boquerones as it's total disrespect for the ingredient.

The chorizo clams is more like a chili with so much cumin and chili oil, it's diarrhea in a bowl.  I could totally see Anthony Bourdain doing a schtick about this dish on No Reservations.

The roasted tomato basil soup was plain and comforting.  Especially in light of the heavy sauces overpowering the palate.

Albondigas pretty tasty.

But the service.  It ain't Picasso even though there's faux Picassos hanging.  And service doesn't even come close to the strip.  Unprofessional and uneven.  Bus boys work pretty hard, and ours was no exception.  Our waiter, however, was more interested in flirting with single women patrons and other staff.    We had to ask two people to get our waiter as he left us hanging with appetizers (3!) and no wine.  He still didn't come.  Uh hello, people want wine WITH their meal.  We even made that clear when we sat down.  We just needed a moment to go through the wine list. 

It's also obvious when there's all this SAUCE left over and separation of food from the sauce that something is wrong with the dishes.  The waiter chose to remain oblivious.

Previous Review:
It is not often that a restaurant goes from extremely good to extremely bad, but here is the exception. This restaurant used to be really good, but the quality and service has slipped over time. I have been beyond dissapointed the last three times I've gone there and embarassed in the cases where I brought others. Further, our last server badmouthed another local restaurant - low class. Oh, and here's the killer... the owner of the restaurant they badmouthed was the person that recommended  Firefly to us in the first place! The bacon wrapped dates which are a tapas staple used to be a standout, but the last few visits the bacon was barely cooked and was more like a withered grape wrapped in a cold rubber band. it also seems that they perhaps downgraded the quality of the meats they use overall. Hopefully they don't continue their downward decent quality wise - and hopefully they gain a simbilance of class back by not badmouthing their competitors to customers. I can only speculate that whatever made this restaurant what it once was either left or moved to the other new location across town.",43mw4n9eZA5o8_hiwZIulQ,0,0,3,mvLjP2RqjKRSO30XHnf3yQ

The service at Firefly was top-notch, very fast, and as a bonus our server was nice to look at. The decor was pretty cool and I loved the table we were sat at, which had little couches instead of chairs; it really lent itself well to the relaxed atmosphere, plus they were SO comfortable!

When we ordered, our food came really fast--much faster than we expected, not that that's a bad thing. Unfortunately it was definitely hit-or-miss. Here's what we ordered with my impressions:

-Smoked salmon toasts: The only thing I really did not like. At least to my palate, the dairy and salmon flavors they used were not complimentary at all, and the added dill and capers just made a bad combination somehow worse. Yuck.

-Stuffed dates: These were fantastic and I could eat them all day if no one stopped me and the dates didn't run out. If you don't at least try them you're depriving yourself.

-Tomato basil soup: The soup was too salty and nothing much to speak of, the brie sandwich was good (if you LOVE brie like I do) but it would have been done better justice if it were paired with some fresh strawberry slices or strawberry preserves. It's just not a good tomato soup companion.

 -Firefly*fries: These were delicious, but the aioli was nothing special and I would have loved a different dipping sauce with these fries.

-Crispy duck rolls: These were just OK. The duck was overcooked and tough, but the flavors were okay. It would have been better if the duck had been shredded more finely, and the hoisin sauce a little sweeter.

-Lamb skewers: These were the biggest disappointment unfortunately. They tasted OK but they were very tough and unremarkable. You can get much better lamb skewers at Flame Kabob.

Dessert platter: I had the lemon-berry tart (delicious but it's just a bite), flan (very good, not too dense), and the tres leches cake--which was much too dense, a little mealy, more like a brownie. I was not a fan, nor would you be if you like REAL tres leches cake.

Plus a martini, forgot what it was called but it was a gin martini with cucumber and lime. That was pretty fantastic.

Overall, I would go there again for the $15 pitchers of mojitos during happy hour, but I will have to learn what's good and what isn't from their food menu. The place is pretty OK, but not great.",6sqRgMuw379kw4bIz44sPA,0,0,3,hZVsYao1PfH4A1nu2Fyg9A
1540586,2012-07-16,3,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"Sunday, July 15,2012. Firefly Tapas. Dear Mr. Vernon, We accept the fact that we assumed that Firefly was only a Lunch/Dinner spot. What we did *was* wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you why we came for Sunday Brunch at 10:00am. What do you care? You see Firefly as you want to see it - in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. You see it as a brain (making delicious cocktails), an athlete (bringing top notch service), a basket case (what's with the pictures of cocks, and was the wall paper painted after a fifth of gin?), a princess (paintings of beautiful flamenco dancers, but why are they all facing away?) and a criminal (black leather seats and rivets? Are they into S&M). Correct? That's the way we saw Firefly until at 10:00 this morning. We were brainwashed

Yup, you heard right, Firefly is now open for Sunday Brunch. If that doesn't make you squirm in your seat, moth watering for tasty tiny plates of flavor, you need to get out more.

Here is a detailed breakdown of what we had, and what we thought:

Firefly*Benedict - one Benny with chorizo - lots of flavor, but you'll need something else to rest your palate. 
Patatas Bravas - Mmmm, tasty potatoes with a seasoned aioli, very yumm
Carne Asada Breakfast Taco - good complement to the benny, this could be a bit bland on its own
Huevos Rancheros - perfect balance of egg, bean and sauce
Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes - the Molly Ringwald of the day, light and fluffy, and tasty with blueberry gravy - we had two
Kinky Kelly - this is one of their signature cocktails, like a sweeter belini with a fruit rollup candied flower floating in it
Blackberry Gin and Tonic - another delightful cocktail, perfect balance if you like gin

One last note about the service, please remember that this is tapas, which means that you are likely going to make your server run in several orders as you taste and sample the many delights. If they are able to manage this with multiple tables, with some sunday brunchers bringing groups of six to eight, they are kickin' butt. For good service, you might want to kick in an extra percent or two for the extra effort that this requires.

So in closing:

Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we thought Firefly was a night time place. What we did *was* wrong. But we think you're crazy to no get your butt up on Sunday to try their Brunch. You see them as you want to see them... In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain drinking cocktails
The server: ...and an athlete, remember 15 visits to your table...
The decorator: ...and a basket case, those are chickens, not ""cocks""...
Flamenco Paintings: ...a princess, isn't my neck lovely...
The decorator again: ...and a criminal, leather and rivets remind me of Spain...
Skacey: Does that answer your question?... Sincerely yours, the Firefly Brunch Club.",GTcKUjRulTRN_XxehMgSZQ,2,3,5,4h29baMx8RYQzfXcZ5YN8Q

The sangria is great. It's an absolute must. I love both the white and the red.

When it comes to food, you pretty much can't go wrong, no matter what you order. And despite being tapas, the portions are actually pretty generous. Because there are so many options, I try to change up my order every time, but I always bully my friends into sharing an order of the fries (which are amazing). 

And if you somehow manage to save room for dessert, the banana nutella sandwiches are highly recommended.

Everything there was delicious, except the tuna tartare that I tried from Marie T.'s plate which was fishy tasting enough to be sent back. I had the shrimp diablo which was fantastic, and the fries which were possibly the best fries I've ever had. I was thinking I needed to order 3-5 dishes to really fill up, but to my surprise I only ordered 2 and I was stuffed.

Due to the niche location they have more to lose so they cannot be inconsistent with their food or service (like I feel the Paradise location is a hit or miss!). The bacon wrapped dates (stuffed with candied almonds) with blue cheese are TO DIE FOR. That's why I order two because I don't like to share. Tip: Instead getting an order of garlic fries and an order of the filet mignon small plate, a bright idea is to go for the ribeye entree (which comes with a big serving of garlic fries). It comes out to the same price, but the portions are bigger. More to share. (see my ribeye pic). Other than that we got the octopus (I prefer the Paradise locations way of preparing it, it was dry bland and not as fresh as I would have liked or had in the past at the Paradise location).

1770508,2013-07-20,0,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"From reading most of my restaurant reviews you will notice a trend with me.  I think it's a woman thing to look for an experience and good food and maybe the gentlemen focus more on the food itself.  I have always loved the great music at Firefly and they used to have some pretty cool artwork of flamenco dancers about the restaurant.  So that starts me off on a great mood.

I met up with some Yelp friends after work for happy hour.  By the time I got there, there were two sangria pitchers on the table.  (Thanks Vanessa N.)  I tried the white one since the red is generally traditional and it was very refreshing.  I am not sure the type of wine that was used but I was very happy with it.

Next I ordered tuna tartar and the shrimp diablo.  While I was waiting for my food to arrive, River let me share her fries.  That could have been a mistake because I think I ate probably half of that!  Thanks River!  Those fries are amazing with cheese, parsley and garlic I think on it.  Very addicting.

It's no big secret I have a poke addiction so I guess I have a palate for tuna.  I am sorry to say that the tuna tartar was not good.  It was fishy and old tasting and the color was not right either.  Marie T. ordered the same thing and hers was bad also.  So we sent those back.  I do have to complement management because they did the right thing by sending the manager over and spoke with us about it and offered to remake it for us, but I didn't want to press my luck.  They did take our tunas off the bill so they did the right thing by us on that.  However, I think it would be a good idea to have the chef taste it and check for freshness when you're sending out raw fish like that.

The shrimp diablo though was excellent and it came in a sweet, spicy hot sauce served with some grilled bread.  The extra bread at the table made it easy for others to try the sauce by dipping the bread.  They all seemed to enjoy it as well.

Loren F. let me try a piece of her artichoke bread.  That was very nice too.

All in all I had a really fun time with my friends, I had a nice sangria, the shrimp diablo was very good, the fries were addicting and the artichoke bread were all things I would recommend.    But because of the bad tuna I am giving Firefly a 3 star rating.",VtLdzz_1olnpRU6AuSsEVg,0,0,3,5tTptzCfQMCRymrdEldyIA

I've been a fan of this place for years, and love their new Summerlin location because it's so close to my house.  It's always very busy and attracts a young, hip crowd.  Luckily we had a large group when we went last weekend, so we didn't have to wait for a table since they'd let us make a reservation in advance.

They have 3 sangrias on the menu (the white is my favorite!) and at $24 for a pitcher, it's a good deal since you'll easily get 6 glasses out of the pitcher (versus paying by the glass).

The impressive menu is loaded with hot and cold tapas, most of which are perfect for sharing.  The complimentary baguette toasts with almond butter are really good and addictive.  Menu favorites include the firefly fries (loaded with parmesan cheese), the bacon-wrapped dates (a delicious combo of salty and sweet), the baked tetilla (a cheesy baked fondue to dip bread in), the manchego mac n' cheese, albondigas (meatballs in tomato sauce) and the fried calamari.  I wasn't as fond of the tomato bread (it's served cold and I think it'd be way better warm) or veggie empanada (kind of bland).

Service here is usually pretty good and our servers were very attentive and constantly refilling our glasses with our sangria pitches and whatnot.  The food also came out very quickly despite the fact that we had a large group, which was great.

I would define it as: small plates which allows you to order and try many things on the menu.  It's usually good for a group of girls sharing dishes. :)

We ordered:

*Roasted baby beet salad

-YUM!  The vinaigrette went great with the greens and the toasted pecans were almost like candy!

*Chicken salad 
[chopped breast, grapes, smoked almonds, creamy cider dressing, endive]

*Firefly* fries

*Camarones a la diabla 
[shrimp, spicy chile sauce, grilled bread]
- wasn't too spicy at all, just a tiny bit of heat, which was nice, since it was the only ""spicy"" thing we ordered.  6 shrimp came on the plate.

*Empanada
[pastry stuffed w/roast pork, red pepper, w/salad, aioli]
- really liked the salad.  Only one empanada came on the plate (cut in half), a little dry, but still good.

*(i don't see this on the online menu)
Lobster w/ parm and basil
-it was OK.  That was the only dish that the 3 of us didn't like.

For Dessert:

*Banana-Nutella sandwiches 
[w/Nutella cream dipping sauce]
-can you go wrong with nutella?  no.  'nuff said.

*Chocolate cherry bread pudding 
[warm w/port wine reduction, vanilla ice cream]
-good except for the fact that they use cheap vanilla ice cream and that ruined it for me.

Never had chance to go, or didn't want to pony up the cab fare and would settle for something on strip.

My wife and i treated a friend who is local  to a show and drinks, and told him we have to go to Firefly after the show for eats.. It was a great move, and a great meal to cap off a great day.

Firefly is happening. Dark, nut not too dark.  Music at just the right volume.  A Younger crowd, but not too young and obnoxious.  Lot of service professionals frequent this place.  It was 11pm on a monday and they were busy.  Thats a testament to what they deliver on here: solid flavor,solid portions, @ great prices.

We started with the bacon wrapped, almond n bleu cheese stuffed grilled dates(5pc).  This is the signature starter of every tapas place on Earth.  Its pretty dam good here.  Not as good as the ones at La Cave (Wynn) but real good.  The Salads we ordered (Garden Variety & Apple Manchego) were great. Fresh. Not small.  But a little overdressed.  Get them dry or ez dressing.

The Firefly Fries are pricey($6) but 3-4 people can share them.  They were a wonderful accompaniment to the Filet Mignon Sliders that came with breaded onion straws.  While i doubt they are ground filet (perhaps could be utility grade), they were hearty, not tiny, and the breaded onions were great.

The chorizo stuffed mushrooms were great, but the star of the show was the Lamb Chops.  Loin cut, cooked medium in a red wine reduction with lentils and julienne cut veggies.  They were tender and had great flavor.  Must have been 3/4' of an inch thick. 2 of them for $8.50. If you know cost of lamb like i do, then you know thats very reasonable.

We passed on dessert. I had a glass of red wine sangria and it was great. Not too sweet.  Sangria @ Todd English's OLIVES= $14  The one i enjoyed at Firefly=$7.

Firefly is worth the trip off the strip and is one of the city's best values with an upbeat atmoshere.  We'll be back.",Hd6pD2G26ObK3gtvdhyHGg,3,1,5,Z4QwRJ0WnTxVVowluXxO-A

The West Sahara location can get very busy. I first went on a Friday night around 7pm and had to wait for over an hour, but I didn't care, it was my birthday and I wanted to eat here. The bar was also crowded around this time so we sat outside. The hostess asked for our phone number and called us when the table was ready. 

Our server was ok, he was slow and didnt come over and ask if we wanted more drinks. We ended up going again last month and got the same server and the same bad service. They bring out the food at all different times. My husband and I ended up getting all of our food before my friends got any of theirs. So they had to sit there and watch us eat.

I understand that some things are just not anyone's fault or at least out of the restaurants control for example getting your tap lines cleaned in the middle of service so I can't have a second beer during dinner but I could have the first. Out of your control and no big deal. Keep in mind I manage a high seafood restaurant on the strip. I never complain or make a fuss about anything at a restaurant but the next part is inexcusable. The steamed mussels were bad and I don't mean the taste I mean the freshness of the mussels. So we told the server to take them away cause they are not fresh maybe ate four or five mussels from the dish. He takes the mussels away apologized and business as usual which is fine. Until the check comes and you still charge me for the old mussels which if I ate could have made me sick. I mean really I have worked in restaurants for over 10 years and have never seen anything like that anywhere. Wow.

Standouts were the chicken skewers, tortilla espanola, shrimp diablo, mac and cheese and firefly fries. Unfortunately they were out of lobster somewhat weren't able to try those dishes. For dessert we chose the fruit tarts and the chocolate tres leches. The tres leches was definitely the better of the two but nothing to write home about. All in it was about $45 per person with a cocktail. It isn't haute cuisine but the ingredients are good, dishes well executed and the hot food hot, cold food cold.

Very very bad tapas. Firefly fits in between the two more so good than bad. We ordered the cheese and Serrano ham plate and for the amount and variety they give you, I think it's priced too high. The paella was good but before we could enjoy the nice crust that had set at the bottom (again, per my bf, this was the best part) the server mixed up everything and the crust was no longer. The other plate we had was the fondue like cheese, it was sweet but subtle and it was ok, with bits of chorizo. Last but not least, there was a white sangria. It reminded me of a Zima and white Zinfandel with small bits of apples. I was not impressed. $90 later plus tip for mediocre service I'm at 3 stars.

It was definitely busy on a Saturday night, but our group was able to be seated in the lounge area at one of the tables in the back. This was great, because it was intimate with couches and low chairs, and we were able to stretch out a bit and enjoy ourselves.  Service was a little slow, but we couldn't fault them for that- they were pretty packed.

I had a blueberry mojito, and while it wasn't bad, I've definitely had better. The food was very good, however. We had the meatballs, empanadas, duck egg rolls, lobster escargot, calamari, steak and mushroom skewers, stuffed dates, and maybe one or two other things I am forgetting. The calamari was great, and I also enjoyed the empanadas.  Despite all of this food, the portions are small, so you likely won't get full. The stuffed dates were delicious as always, and so was the calamari. The lobster escargot was good, but had lots of garlic!

2150570,2010-11-08,1,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"The Skinny: affordable fusion-Spanish tapas with some hits and misses (3.5), service: not as prompt as the Paradise locations - then again, we went when the place wasn't official open, lol! (3), value: for what it is, it isn't a bad place to hang out and nibble on some snacks. I have to say though - the chocolate tres leches is to die for! (3.5)

My hubby and I came with a group of friends to enjoy Firefly two weeks prior to the official opening date. I have to say - the place was pretty hopping from the get go and we got the feeling that the staff wasn't quite ready for it (ie, long waits for drinks, lengthy time between dishes). Seeing at how the Paradise location operates, I'm sure once their open for good, the service will be brisk and efficient.

The beauty of tapas is that you can try a little bit of everything - sorta family style. We were enthused that we now had a location so close to our neighbourhood.

So we ordered the thai beef salad, the chicken salad, the ahi tuna tartare, meatballs, filet mignon sliders, diablo shrimp, some skewers (steak and mushroom, chicken), crispy duck rolls, and the grilled Merguez sausage.

Overall - I have to say that the dishes were only so-so - nothing terribly exciting and would generally rate a 3 stars. The food was generally seasoned well however were often times overpowered by a strong sauce (ex. meatballs, diablo shrimp). The proteins in general tended to be on the overcooked end of things (the Merguez and the skewers tended to be a trifle dry). And the Asian fusion dishes fell flat due to oversweetness in various sauces (not to mention the duck rolls weren't really that crisp).

The chicken salad for me was a big surprise because I thought it was going to be grilled chicken on top of salad topped with some sherry vinegar dressing. Nope - it's a creamy mayonaise chopped chicken concoction you normally get in between sandwiches... without the bread.  I couldn't even taste the grapes and there's virtually no lettuce at all on the plate. Would not recommend. 

I have to say this - if you're looking for a good tres leches cake, come to Firefly. My favourite thing on the menu by a long shot. The cake soaked in milk is perfect for when you have the doldrums - a nice chocolate sponge drenched in milk - yum! A definite pick-me up. That alone is a 4 star dish.

Given these factors, I'd say Firefly deserves a 3.5 star review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,3,3,O7MCA7W0ahIWWKbAKRjsSA

2223001,2011-08-11,2,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"Two years after one of my students, who'd recently traveled widely in Spain, suggested Firefly to me, we finally popped into the Sahara location near Fort Apache.

I was a little hesitant because I'd done my own travels across Spain - a month in 1994 - and as a vegetarian it hadn't gone well. One extraordinary lemon sorbet and the first plate of asparagus I ever liked aside, that entire trip could've been dubbed ""Parade of the Manchego Sandwich."" And manchego is a pretty hard (as in knock-knock, hear-an-echo hard) cheese to endure in a sandwich. Twice a day. For a month.

But the menu at Firefly looked invitingly diverse, so I put my prejudices aside and off we went.

I was concerned that the atmosphere might be uncomfortably posh or trendy for this aging suburban nerd, but it was truly an all-types atmosphere. I saw families, older women chatting together, couples, and the usual bar scene, which didn't dominate the rest of the establishment. 

Four types of seating are available: barstools, high-tops for four, lounge sofas and ottomans with lowish tables for 6-8, and traditional dining tables for 2-4. We didn't want a high-top, so the hostess offered us a lounge ""quadrant"" all to ourselves. Nice! The tables are not ""ultra-lounge low,"" so we enjoyed the seats even though we were there to eat, not to laze around and drink.

We both ordered soft drinks (lemonade), and even though one might think ""tapas = bar = alcohol,"" the waiter didn't ignore us as sometimes happens, and refills came quickly.

Soon a plate of small slices of toast, balls of sweet (really sweet) butter (and garlic?), and a little bowl of unpitted Spanish olives arrived. All three parts were tasty, and I've been a hater of the green olive all of my life. But in this set-up, it just finally clicked. Mostly, though, I was impressed that they'd throw in a complimentary like this when we'd be ordering our own series of small plates in a moment.

(Firefly does offer ""big plates,"" bowls of pasta, and they also do paella from scratch - and advise you of a 40-minute wait - including non-seafood and even vegetarian versions.)

We started with the lightly dressed green apple and manchego salad with smoked almonds. This was probably my favourite dish of the evening. Both the cheese and the apple were cut matchstick style, so in the dim lights it was hard to tell which was which, and I think this added to the experience. (Kind of a spin on the ""dining in the dark"" trend - probably unintentional, but it kept my mouth surprised.) I don't know what type of herb was on the salard, but it added pep to what is always a nice combination. Light and delicious!

Next we had the veggie empanada and the regular (roast pork) empanada. I'm a sucker for empandas, so they couldn't go wrong here, and it was my husband's number-one pick. Each was served with a different kind of dressed greens, making these choices, at $4.50 each, an especially good value.

After that we had Spanish-style tortillas, which means something like a little omelette made of potato, onion, and egg. Three fave ingredients, but it was at this point that I noticed there wasn't any salt and pepper on the tables.

Finally we tried the stuffed peppers, filled with mozzarella and garlic cream cheese with a tomato sauce. Hitting the mozzarella center provided an interesting chewiness, but honestly, it tasted more like it should be described as ""cream cheese with a thick skin around it."" Enjoyable for one bite, but that was it for me.

After this we were full, with all of my plans for mushroom tarts and roasted potatoes in spicy aioli and tomato-basil soup with tiny grilled brie sandwiches floating away. We didn't even get the Firefly fries! This is the disadvantage of going as a twosome; you won't have room to sample as much.

For friendliness, Firefly gets a 5. For atmosphere, a 4-5, just because the traditional dining tables (where I'd rather sit next time) looked a little close together and noisy/busy, and this was a Wednesday night, but it's a pretty space with several seating options and not at all bar-loud. For menu variety, a 5. As a vegetarian, I was elated. My husband wasn't, but he's truly the picky one. (So, check out the online menu first if you're Driving Mr. Fussy that night.)

Now, for taste. I'll say... 3. 

I loved the green apple/manchego salad. I wish it was next to me right now. But the rest? While the tortilla was the worst example, everything tasted a little bland to me. It wasn't that it lacked spice so much - and it's true that I have my Indian/Thai/Mexican biases - but that the flavours didn't offer any interesting contrasts when mixed together. Maybe the missing ingredient was a side of booze.

Fair enough. And I still want to try that mushroom tart, that toasted brie sandwich, and - ooo - the roasted eggplant cannelloni! I'll definitely be back, but it's no hardship to wait until Mr. Fussy owes me a favour.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,2,2,4,aKIpE-y9BHt_81iZ7_pCEw

The fish sticks were ok. It was the crispy texture that made it fun to eat, but the spicy tarter sauce made it extra spesh.

Tuna Peppers: Sweet with a little kick. loved the different testures of this dish

ceviche of shrimp: i didnt eat it, cause im not a fan of the shrimp. but my friends loved it

stuffed dates: Hands down my fave dish of the afternoon. it was sweet and savory and tongasmic. Bacon, cheese, dates and a piece of nut in the center. How can you not love??


Veggie & pork Empanadas: the veggie one was great and didnt feel like you were eating veggies wrapped in fried dough. it was smooth and great flavor. The pork was good but the veggie was my fave

Camarones a la diabla: i didnt eat  the shrimp cause im not a fan of the shrimp, but the sauce that came with  it was  superb! we requested more bread and i lathered it up with the sauce and inhaled it! 

Albondigas: i love meatballs but i had better. the meat was a bit tough and not as succulant as meatballs should be. but it had delicious flavor. just the texture of the meatballs turned me off

I was so disappointed when I heard about the health code issues at the Henderson location, so I was happy to see that this location was good to go. 

We ordered a plethora of dishes, all of which were very delicious! However, they are so overpriced that it was hard to make sure the small party I was with got even a taste of each dish. Some of the small dishes had only 2 pieces! For $10-ish dollars, I think that's a bit ridiculous. I simply couldn't afford to eat here with more than one or two people, because that adds up quickly. 

I love the interior of this restaurant. It is a pleasant place to be! I especially love the patio, although it was closed the last time I was there. 

Overall, this would be a good restaurant for a date, but, in my and my wallets opinion, not so great for a party of multiple people because you would need multiple plates of the same item. The bacon covered dates and sangria are must haves.",TXo4TyFJrCbwl4mJsHDUzg,1,0,3,uOZdYaEey9bDkSf0YkGHPg

This location is a lot roomier than the Paradise spot and it is better for accommodating large parties... and we were a LARGE party! We had a bunch of tables put together in the middle of the restaurant and the more people that came, the more tables they added on. I have to say, the staff, especially our server JOSHUA, were all VERY accommodating, nice and friendly, and were super nice about getting us more tables, getting the food out to us, spread out all over the table, clearing the table and getting us drinks and water!

I like tapas style, allowing you to try many different dishes, and Firefly has a good selection to choose from. I try to stay away from bread/pasta as much as possible and there are still plenty of options. And any of their locations are good. 
Why a 3-star you ask? It's a good consistent place, but food quality lacks for me to be able to give it a higher rating. I usually keep my higher ratings for grass-fed beef, free range chicken, organic option places. 
For lunch I get the chicken salad tapa, which is plenty for me. For dinner, it's a great place to go with friends. My top favs that I always gravitate to are: the Firefly fries (addicting), stuffed dates (very addicting), chicken skewers and petit filet. 
Drink Menu: White or Red Sangria, can't go wrong! Goes down like kool-aid. Not a fan of Sangria? They also have an excellent Pomegranate Martini.",utb6bhr1Fx7_Z5hZnPq_dQ,1,0,3,4OyFafRXub_RlUIsQYLKSA

2439674,2013-06-10,2,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"I love Firefly! Ive been to the other two locations but this one is my favorite. Its closer, less crowed, and I like the way this one is set up. Right when you walk in you see the bar and the large beautiful fireplace. They also have a really cute patio for when the weather is good. Ive never had to wait longer than 10 minutes here and the time that I did have to wait they gave me a free glass of sangria while I was waiting! 

First of all I love the drinks! Ive tried some of the mojitos but mango is my favorite, its so delicious that if I know Ill be there for a while I get a pitcher. Their red wine sangria is phenomenal. I always think of Firefly first when I want sangria. They do have a happy hour for the drinks I believe after 6PM the pitchers are half off. Make sure you at least try one of their mojitos or sangrias. 

Okay now on the the food! Every time I come I try to get something I haven't had before but its so hard because I have so many favorites! If you've never had tapas before the way it works is you order a bunch of things (they are all small plates) so you can try a variety of food. Everyone at the table shares, its family style dining :] I personally love this kind of dining because you can try some many different dishes and everyone else can try them too! My favorites items on the menu would have to be: 

Apple and Manchego salad: Apples and cheese are cut julienne style, so crisp and flavorful! They also sprinkle nuts on the top, delicious! I always get this first whenever I come to Firefly. 

Steak and Mushroom skewers: THE STEAK... mmmm so tender and juicy! I cant get enough! OH and the mushrooms so amazing and they complement the steak beautifully. I absolutely love the sauce the pour over them, ahhhh these are a must get! 

Stuffed dates: WOW small little things but packed with flavor! These cute little dates are wrapped in bacon, yes bacon and stuffed with blue cheese mmmmm. Get these, that's all I have to say. 

Shrimp Civiche: Wonderful, so fresh and with large chunks of avocado. The chips that come with it are very good too. 

Baked titilla: Not sure if I spelled that right, but this dish has manchego cheese in fondue form with chorizo and tomato. Very good if you're a fan of Manchego cheese. It also comes with crispy bread to put the cheese on. 

Tuna taretare: mmmm very tasty tuna! Comes with taro chips! 

Those are just some of my favorites, everything on the tapas menu I've gotten I've loved! Ive also tried the chicken and mushroom piallea, very good, very large! If you want to order this make sure a few other people with help you eat it. I was with 2 other people and we barely made a dent. It also takes around 30 minutes so make sure you order it right away or have time to spare. 

Oh yeah and the desserts! I think I've had almost of them, banana-nutella sand-witches: decadent and oh so yummy! The tarts are really good, and you can go wrong with bread pudding! That is if you even have room for dessert, I usually don't because I get so much food...  If you've been wanting to try tapas come to firefly!",KHTCHdnjQfLx2c4d3UnPmg,5,4,5,WQVjRl4y_HajD-iWjhwALw

Parking:  Easy there is a lot right next to the restaurant so no drama there.

Ambience: Has a dark and sexy vibe to it, the tables in the dining area are a bit too close together for my taste. If you want to avoid that just sit in the bar section there's a bit more room there.

Service: Was good overall my waitress was friendly, the dinnerware was cleared in a timely fashion with each set of tapas that came out, and they kept my water glass filled. 

Food:  The prices are very affordable tapas range $4 - $12 per item while the big entrees range from $12 - $24, now they cook everything to order here so if you're in a big rush to eat you might want to save this place, for when you have more time. 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's what I tried:

Warm spinach salad- This salad was great it was fresh, light and the vinaigrette had a nice balance and wasn't too overpowering.

Empanadas- Was good the pork was season well, the was pasty light, wish I could have tasted more of the red pepper but it was a solid choice.

Ham and cheese croquetas- My favorite so far, between the smoky ham, the warm  
creamy, cheese and the crispy fried exterior I was in heaven. I                           
could have easily ate my weight in these they're just that good. 

Lamb skewer- Delicious, tender, and well -flavored.

Paella- Now it takes a while for the chef to prepare this dish so make sure it is ordered  at the very beginning.  I liked it thought the rice and the meats were cooked well, It was flavored well; however the dish was a bit salty which might have been due to the chorizo, I would order it again and just ask them to ease up on the chorizo next time.

White Sangria- light, sweet and refreshing.

I come to Vegas several times a year on business and this is my go-to place to get out, relax and NOT see anyone I know or work with in my industry.  I guess that you can't keep a secret for too long, as I always see people I know here now.  Even so, I won't stop coming because of it, although I may go to one of their other locations further outside of Vegas?

I cannot pinpoint any one item on the menu that I love more than the others (except for the Stuffed Dates, which simply ROCK), but just take some friends, order 6-10 tapas plates, get a few pitchers of Sangria and try not to look surprised when the check comes.

I have been scared to try tapas since, until I couldn't stop hearing about how amazing Firefly was. Unfortunately, Firefly ended up being more or less the same as that other restaurant: really small plates, mediocre food, and overpriced. 

Bacon Wrapped Dates - These were pretty decent but the bacon was so hard that it could be viewed as a weapon in prison. 

Manchego Mac and Cheese - Really cheesy but I can make a 9 x 13 pan of margherita mac for only a couple bucks more. Not worth it.

Vegetable Empanada - The crust was yummy and flaky but the filling wasn't as delicious. My husband didn't finish his half. 

Firefly fries - big serving and decent but I wasn't planning on getting full from fries alone.

Our bill was $24 for those dishes and we left to get different food because I didn't want to drop $70 to get full off of seemingly mediocre food. I think if you're the type of person to who doesn't need much to get full and likes variety, Firefly is for you.

We were told that, with the package we chose, we could have 6 different tapas and they would be served family style and  be all-you-can-eat. Well, there's a catch. Not only were they served on the usual small plates (not very family style-ish), but you can only order more food once all the courses come out. So after waiting (at least 10 minutes between each course), we were finally able to order more. By that time, though, no one felt like waiting any longer. 

The servers, though hard working and somewhat nice, seemed to be blind as to making sure drinks were adequately filled. Most people had to ask (in some cases, several times) to be served a drink.

I like this place. I love the food. There just seemed to be a little bit of a breakdown the night we were there. I'll be back, but won't be booking any more private events there.

Firefly looked very appealing. The ad and menu in the back of the book both stated they were open until 11. We arrived at 9:25, the hostess said they were about to close but if we ""hurried and ordered"" we could make it. Being super hungry we decided to stay and hurry our order. There was so much to choose from that it was a shame we had to pick the first thing that caught our eye. We were excited to try many plates but couldn't because we were rushed. The Dates were great as was the steak. When the food came out we asked if we could order dessert right then they said we just made the cut off time. We ordered the dessert sample platter, it was obviously pre made/plated. The dessert quality wasn't as good as the food. Plus, we were sitting at the bar and both had empty drinks and had to ask 2 times for more beer and water.  Another table had to walk up to the bar and ask for more wine, the bartender just handed the customer the entire bottle without even corking it. I could hear employees in the back talking about how its pointless to close at 10 when they allow people to stay until 11. When one of them came out I told him that the advertisement said 11. He expressed to me that some ads say 10 and some say 11. No big deal but we just felt like we were being rushed, There were so many great choices on the menu that we were looking forward to having the full Tapas experience.

Anyone who has been to firefly knows that almost everything is yummy. I always order the bacon wrapped stuffed dates. They are sweet and savory all in one. The pork empanadas are flaky and the pork is flavorful and moist. The spicy beef salad was also yummy. Beef was tender and dressing on the salad had a nice heat, nothing too overwhelming.

Than that leaves the Sahara location. People might thing I'm crazy to eat here again but I do enjoy their food until now. 

Friday nights are always usually super busy. We came in and it was pretty dead. Ordered the usuals that we usually get-- 

spicy beef salad (my fav)-- still taste amazing. Warm salads are always my fav. Add ginger in it for the kick & it's delicious. 

Empanadas- really dry. The salad that comes with it had a sour dressing with it that didn't taste too familiar. 

Ceviche- oh how this dish had change. Less less less. I remember they would bring a bowl with hella chips. Now it's 6 chips with palm full of ceviche. One of the worse ceviches I ever had. 

Albondigas- the meatballs are smaller now. Tasted pretty good still but something was missing. I don't know what it is. 

Cocktails & sangria -- pretty much the same no changes there. 

I used to be in love with this restaurant but I guess all good things must come to an end.. ¯\_(?)_/¯ Oh and if anyone's wondering.. I didn't get sick.",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,2,3,2,lXiFbz438VTSsLohaLAGjw

This was my first time going to Firefly after watching them on a rerun of that restaurant makeover show.  I was a bit hesitant, but it turns out that the service is decent.  

The food, however, is okay but lacks finesse and pop that I expect when I pay $10 for two small sliders, for example.  I also bit down on a fish bone on my ahi tuna dish.  Ouchies.  I didn't tell the staff, but I do have a picture of the bone just in case anything happens to my gums in a few days.

Any who, service was decent and the best part of the tapas experience there were the steak and mushroom skewers.  I don't dig paying that much for small plates, so I guess I don't fit into that ""in"" crowd.  I also didn't dig the black walls.  The whole color scheme screamed villain to me for some reason.

I'm docking a star because the service has been consistently slow. The wait staff takes a while to come around after you're seated, and then they doesn't check in that often. The other side of that is that they are really friendly and make great suggestions.  Their bus staff is incredible. Plates are cleared promptly and water glasses are kept full.

3068256,2012-05-16,0,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"Went here for our anniversary dinner Friday night before Mother's Day. The cons are very few so let me start those off. 

VERY LOUD! The location, and I love the decor and ambiance, but with the place full of customers, it was extremely hard to have a conversation with hubby (and yes I was sitting next to him). The place echoes a lot on top of all the conversation, so by the time you leave you almost have a headache, and the traffic sounds are peaceful crickets! Then again we went on a Friday night - so of course it was really busy, but still - a bit louder than I would have liked. Won't stop us from coming out again, but may decide to eat outside next time where it will be a bit quieter. 

We had the seafood paella, and it was very mouth watering good - really good! Just a tad too much salt in it. Not enough to make you stop eating it, but enough to make your throat parched enough.

Like I said those are my cons. Now on to the pros!

Roasted Baby Beet Salad
     Very light and flavorful! Didn't know beets could be yellow, so we were 
     pleasantly surprised on that one. A nice start.

Roasted Eggplant Cannelloni
     YUMMMY!!! The eggplant flavor being very delicate was a little overpowered by 
     the cheese filling, but I kept going for more. Also noted the cheese filling 
     tended to get stuck in my upper mouth. But like I said - yummy! Couldn't put my 
     fork down. 

Pulpo Asado
     What a yummy delicate surprise! The tenderness was so awesome and spot on!     
     They paired the pulpo with potatoes, giving it a very earthy flavor, but the herbs 
     kept it just light & airy in the mouth. Mouth watering just thinking about this dish.

Empenada
     I'll admit I was a little hesitant to eat this when I saw the pastry had been 
     charred, & was tough to cut into. When biting into it - the pastry just melted away 
     in the mouth, and a very nice fire popped into the mouth! All the different spices, 
     & herbs - we just were in heaven!

And as noted above the seafood paella well worth it! Like I mentioned a tad too much salt in it, but we loved it!

Passionfruit Cheesecake
     Oh baby. Ohhhhh baby! Now THIS ya gotta have! Perfect round little morsels... I 
     still want more!!!!!

Service
     Can not find one fault with them! Spot on service! Drinks refilled at the perfect moment, without even asking! Very polite and making sure all our needs were being met. 

Yeah we'll come back. :D",iUds9-iyxd4PFW0jMh15TA,1,0,4,HvimSI5g1aQzqSF51mDZyw

It got frustrating to the point where I decided to directly confront the Host staff, and refused to step out of the way (i'm intentionally making them uncomfortable) until she made it certain that we are getting our table NEXT. 

Insanely expensive tapas for portions the size of little niblets. At least Sammy's Woodfired has tapas that are considerably larger, two of which can add up to a meal. 

But between me and my brother, we needed around 8 or so shared between us to get full. With a humungous freaking bill totalling over $70 before tips. 

At least our actual server for our table is fairly fast on his feet and competent. Both of us tipped him while specifically telling him not to pool his share to the Hosts. 

Oh, and this is not the same location as the 2nd one on Paradise, which is all the hoopla about the food poisoning outbreaks and restaurant closure by the health department (read the Review Journal). And as far as I can tell, me and my brother never got sick from our one and only time coming here. 

Watch out for the drivers in this side of town in the establishment's parking lot. The locals don't care if they hit your car or run over your infant toddler, since they got plenty of dough to hire their lawyer and fix up their Mercedes while suing you all the way to a homeless shelter. 

In fact, I would say that as a poor person, I wouldn't ever want to be taking my own car to Summerlin and definitely not a place as trendy as Firefly. The locals on this side of town make running over ""peons"" like a GTA video game.",USpN4MpgR9RpwT7eKUA3aw,4,1,2,p24ZjO85wGloMbITb0AbDQ

I'm happy to say that months after opening, the food is just as delicious as it is at the other Firefly locations, and they are still always busy!  Definitely make a reservation, and if you can...get there early!

Served on small plates, tapas were originally meant to rest on a small plate on top of your beer as you stand in a group and talk ( thus the name tapas ). Eating small amounts but throughout the entire evening helps combat all the alchohol thus allowing you to drink more and longer! Brilliant! Firefly is a fun place to gather with a large group of friends, drink and eat. A decent selection of many spanish styled tapas ensures that one can find at least a few pleasing dishes.

I'll start with the pros: The food is still pretty good. I ordered the Patatas Bravas (roasted red potatoes $5.5) and the Steak Skewers ($9). The steak skewers were the same delicious steak and mushrooms that I remember, served in a flavorful red wine reduction. The potatoes seemed to have a little more of a cheesy sauce to them, than I remember but they were still really good. 
I also still like the original, red sangria. Red and fruity deliciousness. 

The service was good, they seemed to be attentive. One of the servers did forget to bring me a water, but he apologized, and brought it later.

The cons:
One of the side plates on our table had dried food on it, this was before we were brought any food or drink. The menu also had some dried food on it... not that big a deal, but they should be more attentive to cleanliness. 

When I arrived there was only a few of us sitting at the table and I asked if I could be on my own check. The server agreed, I only had one sangria and more people joined our group, the server told me that I had to cash out and go on the group check. All parties of six or more must be on the same check. This doesn't really make any sense to me, and is quite an inconvenience.

Also, our table was never brought any bread. I didn't even think to ask for it, and actually forgot about it until I saw the photo of it on here.

My review is based on service and in the restaurant industry customer service should above and beyond that's what tips are based off right? Well in my case my server took a few mins too long to greet our table didn't really care for us.... Our food came she didn't even ask us if we liked it or how was it... She didn't even top off our waters!! She was passing my our table and didn't stop once and she would be either her coworkers by the register chatting away ... This is tapas plates get empty fast and we finished and waited for some interaction from her. I was so irritated I had to speak to a manager who then only offered drinks... She allowed the same server to serve and she was now being rude in purpose. For a Friday night that was only maybe 8-10 tables with people they were having bad customer service as if they were a full house and short staffed sad to say I won't go back in particular to this location
I got better customer service at old firefly that has a wait and elbow to elbow tables that are full

I frequent Vegas often, but I had an unplanned, overnight stay on Sunday, due to a layover. I ended up going to Firefly for a late dinner w/friends, around 10:30pm. We waited less than 10 min for a table for four. Their menu is on the lengthy side, but it was very easy to scan through, which surprised me. There are a lot of words, but descriptions get to the point and just tell you the main ingredients. Good enough for me.

Things we ordered: (Ready, set, DROOL!)
-Ceviche of shrimp
-Firefly fries 
-Mushroom tart
-Steamed mussels
-Ham and cheese croquetas
-Steak and mushroom skewers
-Crispy duck roll
-Chocolate ""tres-leches"" cake
-Passion Fruit mojito

Drooling yet? YUMMO! Everything was great, but my favorite was the mushroom tart. The mojito was very refreshing, the service was great. I can't wait to try more tapas from their menu! When I'm a fan, I'm very loyal. I will definitely make it back to Firefly again soon.",IoLEAD87RD1tJzaBTjS1IQ,2,0,4,24w99qQMp0swoSGYOajFPQ

We had been to both locations numerous times and loved the food. The management was very helpful in planning the event, picking out menu items, reserving the private room, etc. At the rehearsal dinner (the night before our wedding) everything went wonderfully, all of our guests had a great time and enjoyed the food... UNTIL 10+ of our guests came down with horrible FOOD POISONING the night of our wedding! Both of my parents, my sister, my fiancé's mom, members of the wedding party, and friends from out of town, all became severely ill, to the extent of visiting the hospital emergency room! My family was so ill that they were not able to see family and friends that had come in town for the first time in years.  Once we realized exactly what happened we called and spoke with the restaurant manager who, when first hearing the story, did not seem all that surprised. He offered to speak with his boss and get back to us. When we finally heard back (after having to track him down) he offered to do NOTHING!  Not even an apology!  After spending quite a bit on this dinner only to have our family and friends fall ill, I was amazed.  This is the first Yelp review for me, I just had to let others know.

I mean, it was on my list of places to try... but I wasn't explicitly in the mood for tapas that night until we checked Open Table and found they had a table available at 10:15.

We were seated right away, and a waiter magically appeared seconds later to take our drink orders, before I'd even opened the drink menu! I'm glad I took a second to peruse it because they have three different kinds of sangria and I decided to try the sparkling first. I wouldn't get it again; it was more like a sweet cocktail than I'd expected (I swear there was midori in there) but the yummy red sangria I had next made up for it. The red sangria is GOOD STUFF.

We were really hungry so we ordered like 6 dishes and enjoyed them all. We had the tiera y mar skewers (steak and shrimp with chorizo), baked tetilla, patatas bravas, crab claw corn dogs (i LOVED these), lobster ""escargot"" (little lobster knobs in a scampi or de joghne-like sauce) and shrimp ceviche. Everything was delicious! 

The only thing really lacking was the service- the two girls at the hostess stand ignored us and kept right on chit-chatting for a couple of minutes when we first walked in, and our waiter could've been friendlier, but it was nothing egregious and the food and sangria is good enough for me to come back MANY times.",rUW7_B9pBNdDR3Y2bBz9TQ,0,0,5,HlT4yB13MVFJ0E1-miA3kQ

Service was good, but you can tell the hostess and wait staff were still tryin to get the feel on how to best service the guests (asking every 5 minutes if were ok and if we needed anything)...

Since there was only two of us, we shared 4 dishes.  We ordered the babyback ribs, mac n cheese, thai beef salad, and terra y mare skewers.  I thought it wasn't going to be enough for us but it was just right.  Every dish was so good - just like on Paradise.  It was my first time having the mac n cheese and it had really good flavor.

We had:
Camarones a la diabla [I think out of everything we tasted this was the best plate. What really made this dish as delicious as it was, was the spicy chili sauce which was YUMMMYY!!]
Fried calamari [Calamari was good buy not anything exciting but like the Camarones a la diabla it was the SAUCE that made it delicious!!]
Roasted eggplant cannelloni [I don't plan on getting this again, I love eggplant but the goat cheese was overwhelming]
Firefly*fries [Never can go wrong with fries and the sauce!! Yummy!! AGAIN]
Stuffed dates [Bacon wrapped stuffed dates sounds good if you look the salt & sweet combination but the dates were too much for me! ]

Very slow and waitress was not very nice. She snapped at me when I told her dish was prepared completely different from Paradise location. She said it wasn't possible because they use same recipe. She didn't ask if I wanted anything else, instead I brushed it off and ate it anyway. Later, she comes back and apologized after confirming with Paradise location they do in fact prepare differently. Again, she did not offer to bring something else. 

Conclusion: 
Sangria is awesome. I love this place, just not this location. To wrap up my story with cherry on top; we come to find out later the the restaurant gave themselves a $20 tip!

Perfect example is Firefly on Sahara. The only decent items we had were the olives and tomato butter you get in the beginning, and the Bacon wrapped dates.

We ordered the other following items which were a total failure in taste and execution:

Ceviche-totally overkilled with lime juice and you could hardly taste the fish, and where's the salt?

Boquerones- When I ordered these at the Paradise location, the bread was slightly toasted, the roasted pepper vinaigrette was full of flavor, and the Aioli was garlicky and creamy-this time, the bread wasn't even toasted, the pepper vinaigrette was barely noticeable, and the aioli was not only flavorless, but was also runny! Aioli does not run!!!

Mussels-Ever had mussel jerky? They do it very well here. My order was almost all shells. when I did find a mussel, it honestly was the size of a dime!(PLEASE SEE MY PICTURE!!!PLEASE!!!!) To the idiot who doesn't know how to cook mussels properly-They're done right when their shells open!!!!

Pulpo Asado-No charred,grilled taste whatsoever...more like stewed with peppers and sherry vinegar....wtf?????

Firefly Fries- we got these free because the table next to us that did order them already had their order. Cool! Right? WRONG!
drenched in that same tasteless aioli-YUCK!

So our waiter suggests the Chocolate Tres Leches and the Banana-Nutella Sandwiches......sandwiches were forgettable and the tres leches was a total mushy mess! You're better off going to Mariana's or Cardenas and getting the real deal Holyfield Tres Leches at a fraction of the cost.

Passion fruit mojito? BOMB!
Pomegranate martini? BOMB, but strong
Pumpkin Spice martini? Strong, spicy, and EXPLOSIVE in your mouth!

The food? I honestly lost track of how many items we ordered because it just kept coming! They were all so good! I mean we practically ordered half of the menu.

Chicken skewers: so full of flavor and tang, that its kicking soccer balls of flavor in your mouth. chicken very tender.

Beef and mushroom skewers: very very good. Tender, juicy, and flavorful.

Fish sticks: a great crispy breading with a very tender filet.

Lobster escargo: AWESOME.ORG!!!

Ceviche: Very light, and soft flavor

Honestly, we had more food, but I just lost track and couldn't remember thanks to the food coma I had towards the end of our meal. I was so stuffed and buzzed that I didn't quite know what hit me more...

We started with three plates--the Firefly fries, steak and mushroom skewers, and marinated and grilled octopus (pulpo asado).  All three dishes were excellent.  The fries are completely addictive.  You cannot stop eating them.  The have parmesan cheese and herbs on them and a side of aioli for dipping.  I liked them without dipping.  Did I mention they're addictive?  I think the FDA will soon start regulating their distribution and sale.  :)

We decided to try two more things because this is tapas.  I ordered the scallops ""escargot"" for myself and my wife got the ham and cheese croquetas.  Both were winners all the way.  The butter/garlic/herbs with the scallops fooled one into thinking they were having real escargots.  The ham and cheese deep fried croquetas were really tasty and the aioli on them was super.

Finally, we ordered some dessert.  My wife got the chocolate and cherry bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream and I ordered the banana-Nutella sandwiches.  The sandwiches had mashed bananas inside and Nutella drizzled on top and there was a small side container of more Nutella.  Absolutely delightful!!!

Our server was Joshua and he was top notch!  He answered questions we had, recommended some things when we asked, and he always saw to it that we had new glasses of iced tea before we finished the ones we had.  It seemed like everyone in the place was very customer oriented and we felt welcomed and appreciated!

I will be back to try some more of their goodies.  But, this time I'll skip the fires.  As addictive as they are, they can also be very filling and you just cannot stop eating them.  I was waiting for my wife to say, ""Put the fries down and put your arms up.""

5 stars for a place with great food and service to match.  And, 5 stars to a place where my wife tries a piece of octopus and actually likes it!  Miracles do happen!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,5,4,5,W5zLr6XEEBTKUEMbhu0AiQ

If I have great service but a bad meal I'll come back and try another item or a different time of day. At Firefly you will find fantastic tapas at great prices and generally very inconsistent service to go with it.

I have been to this location 3 times and have been consistently happy with the food. The lunch deal ($10) is basically a full portion with a side and fills you up for cheap. The brunch was really good too and offers some gourmet lunch items in small sizes. I really liked the breakfast tacos and benedicts. The chicken skewers are a must for the lunch deal and the Firefly french fries are a delicious go-to when ordering off of the regular menu (get extra aioli).  I haven't found a favorite dish yet because everything I've tried has been great so far.

The happy hour wasn't really described by my server but the gist seemed to be 50% off everything from the drink book from 3-6pm and no food items are discounted.  We got a large pitcher of white sangria (delicious) and it came out to a total of $14 on the bill, what a steal!

On the flip side the service has been pretty nonexistent all 3 times. Does your server ever come back to check on your food or allow you to order more food? Rarely, and usually by then you aren't hungry for more. Does your server bring you water or keep it full? Not when you sit in the on the patio.... although a female back-waiter we had yesterday was very attentive.  It seems that the only time we had good service was when the restaurant was actually busy instead of an off time.  The bartender was chewing gum with her mouth open while talking to guests, there were servers on the floor talking in large groups instead of working and one server was even at a table with his cell phone out for a good 5 minutes before he left the table.  We also saw that fabled creature, a manager, for the first time as well.  But with all of the above we still had an awkward server that forced some jokes and seemed to be around when we needed him, which was a welcomed change to the type of service we usually get here.

The food is fantastic, reasonable priced for gourmet style, and the service is hit or miss.  Will I be back?  Absolutely, I'll just make sure I come during regular times instead of off times.

tapas and sangria were enjoyed by all, especially the bacon wrapped dates, the mac and cheese, the filet mignon sliders, the lamb skewers, the thai beef salad. some people will be like, oh is this place authentic? blah blah. well, it's better than some food I had in barcelona, if that answers your question, and I had some food in spain that could never be beat by anything stateside.

Trendy, upbeat atmosphere coupled with tasty beverages and chic tapas style food makes this a winning hotspot.

Happy hour is awesome.  Food is normal prices but ALL drinks are 50% off! That's right! That means you can get a pitcher of sangria for $14 or a pitcher of mojitos for $15.  That could be the price of one glass elsewhere!  You can get a glass for $2.50 or a shot of infused tequila for the same price! Bananas!  Wines are priced low anyhow... $5 -12. But at 50% off, this is probably the best drink prices you'll find!

Went on a date with my hubs yesterday.  We shared a pitcher of white sangria which was zingy and refreshing.  We also had mussels.  They were served steamed to perfection in a spicy curry coconut broth with a baked baguette crusted with cheese.  Very good!  We also had the thai beef salad.  The flavor of pickled ginger is overwhelming; however, I love that flavor so its fine by me.  The bacon wrapped dates are a winner too.  They are crispy and hot and served with a stinky blue cheese and an incredible red wine sauce.  Ask for extra bread to soak up the sauce and they will gladly bring it to you.  

Firefly is always good; however, if youve been as many time as I have to their three locations, you know....nothing ever changes! It's the same menu all the time for like 7 years!  YAWN! Personally, I am hoping they will wise up and create some specials and new items!

I had the apple and cheese salad which had a little kick to it thanks to some finely chopped cilantro.  Then I tried a mini fillet mingon which took a while to get to the table but was worth the wait.  I ordered it without mushrooms and the first one came swimming in them.  It was ten dollars and in my opinion a really good deal.  The mac and cheese was gooey goodness.  I ordered the dessert platter but wasn't impressed with anything because the cheesecake was too tart for me and the rest was just okay.  The only thing I didn't like was the service was a bit sketchy.  It started out great but over the course of the meal, but the waiter was few and far between after we were seated.

4117238,2013-05-18,2,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"I feel the need to not only give a bomb-ass review to Firefly but to stand up for them despite what happened at one of their locations within the last few weeks.  First of all, let's all be sure to understand - when you go out to eat, you are choosing to put yourself at risk to any number of things that could happen.  You could slip and fall walking into a restaurant or yes, you could eat food that won't sit well with you.  Neither event is ideal to you and certainly not ideal to the owner/staff of the establishment.  People get into the restaurant business mostly because they want to host and give everyone a great experience.  They never anticipate the unfortunate event that the science of food and cosmic forces at work will cause anyone to get sick.  So, let's not continue to punish them because I'm sure they feel bad enough.

Again, being new to the Vegas scene, there are sooo many places that I have yet to try.  One of the fellow foodie girls that I work with had been insisting that I needed to try Firefly so we took advantage of the only night we were both free! Again, I have to say - I LOVE WHERE I LIVE! Firefly is a 10 minute or less drive down the street from me that requires all of 2 turns to get to.  The decor and set-up is pretty standard but with the kind of food they are serving - they don't need to worry 'bout it! We shared a pitcher of the red sangria that was BOMB.  I'm pretty sure I consumed most of it but she was busy talking so I don't think she noticed.  As far as food, we tried SO MUCH! I'm so glad I saved the receipt to know exactly what I had so I can be sure to try more next time: tuna tartare, terra y mare, camarones diabla, petite filet, dates, camarones ajillo and the banana nutella dessert.  The bonus of this place is that everything (with the exception of the dessert) was Paleo-friendly! I mean seriously, meat on sticks with sauces?! You've got this girl's heart.  And I'm sorry, don't put nutella on the menu unless you want to see me dominate a plate - because that's exactly what happened.  We rounded out the night with a shot of Don Julio and their Ginger-Pear cocktail and I'm already excited to go back!",47-nM4VOQRwu86nJ4r3dEw,8,5,5,TlL5OViHKXazS7H3MUNXKQ

The service was great, not once was our water glasses not filled up. I ordered the ahi tuna tar tar plate and sad to say the tuna tasted not really fresh at all. The meat looked dark, i thought it was just the sauce. The chicken empanada came in just 1 piece cut in half. Kinda disappointing for $8 bucks if i remember the price correctly. However, the mango bbq ribs plate was the best! And the bacon wrapped dates we're amazing too. The steak and mushroom skewers were good also. Take notes, they are tapas so most of the plates are very small dishes. The dessert was next and I got the dessert sampler. The cheesecake was sour, the flan tasted like spoiled milk at first, but my friend loved the tres leches cake. So this place really has its up and downs on food plates.

We went on our last trip to Julian Serrano...

and we must say - Firefly is world class; Julian Serrano's is run by chefs hoping to become Denny's salad cooks.

And the price is half the cost of going to Julian's (note: We pigged out so you could actually save a lot more if you were not as piggy as us.).  
The decor is stellar - rich hues; red lights; beautiful.  While Julian Serrano is right off the casino floor - none of the richness of some of the restaurants you so want in las Vegas.  Firefly delivers.

So if you want tapas and wonderful sangria wine to go with it, do not stop but head immediately to Fireflys.

Our party was a party of 3 and of course we started with their wonderful dates - just right.  Fantastic.  We continued with their lentil and vegetables (and so good). We continued with their meatballs, steak and mushroom skewers, ahi stuffed pepppers, and empanadas. All pure food magic - great taste; and so much more.  We had a very good banana desert.

The person we brought was not sure when we wanted to go to Firefly's.   He had read some down reviews about the place and said - what the heck - at least we get to talk.  And we did in our nice booth in the back.    However, his comment at the end was - This was truly the best; it is a memorable meal; it is fantastic.  And the reviews I read - they must not have eaten here.  

Locals love this place as well as visitors.   Its closer to Red Rock Casino than the strip but if you have a car its worth the short drive.  All in all - a big thank you to the cooks, the wait staff; and everyone at this fantastic restaurant.",2e7h0LdZjyCLcpBa9UwBaw,2,1,5,Ny8uVq2VuSz59Vqq4feuaQ

I would def go here during the day to try it out. One of the things I did really like was the street taco area outside prior to leaving, for 2$ you can get pollo, adobada, or asada and you can put as much crema on it as you like.... I love me some crema!! LOL.

*Food*
5/5 Bread w/ sweet almond butter spread: I'm addicted to this FREE appetizer. It's just a simple french bread cut into slices with olives and this amazing sweet almond butter spread.  

3/5 Baked Filets of Tilapia: Tasted like your normal fish sticks with tarter sauce. It came with a salad and this light dressing. I loved the dressing very light and I can't really explain it but it was delicious. 

4/5 Ahi Tuna Skewer: The tuna's seared with mango's left in a a sweet soy sauce salsa. First I didn't think this was my ahi tuna skewer till I realized OH ITS SEARED. I was expecting fresh chunks of tuna but its okay it gave the skewer a nice flavor seared. 

3/5 Camarones al ajillo: My favorite and one of my usual orders at firefly, I was pretty sad to taste that there was a huge difference between the paradise location and this location. Camarones al ajillo is shrimp/garlic/butter and its delicious. I felt at this location there wasn't enough butter or garlic but more lemon. It had more of a tangy sauce rather than the butter goodness I'm used to. 

4/5 Steak and mushroom skewers: One of my usual orders, I pretty sad to taste that there was a difference between the paradise location and this location. The creamy sauce the skewers are placed in tasted off. If you want to try this tapas I suggest trying it at their paradise location first because you'll absolutely love it there. 

4/5 Filet Mignon sliders: The filet Mignon came wit 2 small buns topped with some kind of creamy cheese and caramelized onions which were crunchy. Very delicious. The filet Mignon was also juicy. 

*Drinks*
5/5 Sangria: Red, everyone knows Firefly is known for their sangria. I've always gone to their other location on paradise but my boyfriend and I couldn't get a reservation there. So we tried this location and in my opinion I think the sangria was much strong here than their other location. We ordered a pitcher for 2 people surprisingly we finished it. 

*Desert*
5/5 Chocolate ""tres leches"" cake: get this desert, I've tried the Gelato which was also good but super bad for you lol but this cake omg.. it melts in your mouth. Its not your traditional chocolate cake you would expect. The cake is super soft and what ever cream sauce they drizzle on it is so yummie...

*Service*
5/5 The Service here was amazing! I went on Valentines day with my boyfriend. Before walking in I felt bad because the workers had to work on Valentines day. I thought they would be sluggish or rude but omg they were so nice. I had a great waitress that was super funny.

We came here a couple months back with a large crowd. We ordered the sangria pitcher which was very potent but very good. We love the complimentary toast with honey almond butter & green olives which were set down immediately after we were seated. Ordered our favorites like bacon wrapped stuffed dates (get a few of these because they go fast), artichoke toast (love the creamy garlic sauce and grilled artichoke), manchego mac & cheese (comfort food) big bowl of pasta (which is like angel hair pomodoro with vegetables), tuna tartare & taro chips (perfectly fresh & good portion), albondigas (a little dry), the empanadas (were ok).

When I go out to eat I like to relax and enjoy good conversation over tasty food. The Sahara location had music playing in the back round ....but it's not too loud. She Will Be Loved by Maroon 5 was on during the meal which helped me relax even more because I do like that song. 

The interior is done in a nice red and they have this huge fireplace that's on the left as you walk in. It gives off a homey feeling in a ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" kind of way. It's not because Selma Hayek comes out and dances with a big yellow snake either... I think it's because of the picture hanging above the fireplace. I didn't have my glasses on but it looked like a skeleton of a male Flamenco dancer. It just gave me that vibe but it was cool....I liked it. 

The service was very good and we didn't feel rushed even though they were closing in an hour. My husband and I ordered a couple of tapas to share. I started out with the Tomato Basil Soup that came with a mini grilled Brie sandwich. I'm sensitive to salt so it was a little too salty for me. My husband who is a bread and cheese lover didn't like the grilled sandwich so for us that was a miss. We also ordered a Beef Thai Salad which was delicious. The meat was very tender and had some kick to it! Our last non sweet dish was the Filet Mignon sliders. It had ham, crumples of cabrales cheese and onions on the side. The cheese had a very sharp taste but it was still very good. We polished off our mini meals with Banana Nutella Sandwiches per recommendation from our waiter. He knew what he was talking about! I wish I ordered it with some ice cold milk. 

I think this is a nice cozy place to grab a bite to eat whether you are on a date or hanging out with a bunch of friends.",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,3,0,4,k8IVwDzR6BgnLlhP8Cwo_w

TIME SPENT
2x at night-time

LAYOUT
south american decor, low lounge seating, very somberly lit.   everything seems to roll together to give off the right upscale and interesting social experience.^^   it may even be even good for a romantic engagement.

SERVICE
prompt at first, but delivery is slow.   i found the server friendly and knowledgable about the menu.

FOOD
be warned, the majority of the food is not meant to fill...   the portions are small and the selection is meant to be picked over while u converse with your party.   however, what u get IS tasty, but the sangria is average fair.

PRICING
the menu isn't expensive, but all the small orders do add up.   drinking prices can look pricey ($8-$16 avg), but is really the norm in Vegas.   i'm actually surprised they're not pricier as Firefly feels very upscale.

CLOSING
i think Firefly is a great place to be -- if you're a local.   sure, the decor is nice and the ambience is good...  but ur buying into a look and not the over-all experience.   IMO, the Vegas experience tourists should value, is the kind that they can't find anywhere else...  am i right.??

low lighting, common tapas food, and the selection of exotic drinks (who doesn't have a signature drink these days) at Firefly won't leave you with a lasting impression of Vegas.   this place is more for locals who want to kickback after a long day of work or schmooze with their friends.

and i hate to say nay to something and not fix it.   the Gordon Biersch Brewery right across the street would do you a better service.   i know my friends would recommend Musashi's located in the same shopping center, but i say meh to that also......  i'm not on their payroll, btw...

Just went back after a month.  Warm Spinach salad is great.  The dressing and the cheese, peppers, artichokes  were good.  My fish was excellent, great sauce.
Unfortunately I was next to this rude and grumpy table of six.  They didn't understand that little plates come out at separate times.  They all wanted to eat together.  And they were confused by what they ordered.  The people that had the lunch specials complained about the fries being cold.  Now that was a real complaint but it could have been fixed.  
The ""Ringleader"" of this group was very unpleasant.  I think we all know what type of foods they are going out to eat now.  (No more Chinese!)  Apparently they eat out a lot!  Eating out is great but we don't all need to hear for 15 minutes what you six are going to eat.

We went on a Friday night around 7 with me, my hubby and toddler and my parents. Even on such a busy Friday night, the staff was very accomadating with us and our small child. 

To start off, there are so many delicious cocktails to chose from so we asked our waiter Eduardo for suggestions. We ended up with the Blueberry Mojitos which i have had before and are to die for. My husband had the Delirium beer which is a pretty strong beer but refreshing. 

Next i feel like we ordered everything off of the menu. Its pretty hard at Firefly when it comes to ordering because pretty much everything on the menu is fantastic. From the Bacon wrapped Dates to the Shrimp Diablo to the lamb chops and mussels. YUMMM! Even though you can get a little crazy ordering for dinner since there are so many fabulous options, i would highly recommend saving just a tad room for dessert. 

We went with the Tres Leche Cake and Chocolate Cherry Bread Pudding. OMG! Even though none of us had any room for either of these, we shoved them in our faces as if we had never eaten before. Man they were both to die for. So good!

 Its so refreshing to go to a hip place with a small child and have a great time and leave 100% happy.

I would suggest Firefly to any of my friends and it is especially great for groups. We came here for my 30th birthday party in December and were wowed again.

The ambiance of the restaurant is dim makes it romantic. LOL. Service was good.

Anyways back to firefly....I'd recommend making reservations for big groups and in general so you wouldnt have to wait that long. We had a prefixe menu so we had a variety of appetizers and 3 desserts.

A must try items...
Ceviche of shrimp - Delicious but has a lot of lemon juice.

Stuffed dates - Bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese. Delicious but not a fan of blue cheese.

Patatas bravas - love how the spicy aioli is smothered on the potatoes. Not too spicy.

Mushroom tart - Delicious mushroom tart especially the cheese!!

Filet mignon sliders - These sliders was delicious!! especially the fried onions on the side..

Babyback ribs - sweet and smoky yum!!!

Fried calamari - Love the dipping sauce mildly spicy yum!!

Crispy duck rolls - Delicious, savory egg roll.

It's got a good vibe and a ""locals"" feel to it.  But the best thing in my opinion is the sangria.  That's why I'm thrilled about this new location --- it's within walking distance for me!

I will admit it, I'm a girly-girl.  That's why I like the sangria.  It's light and fruity and tastes good.  But the other thing is the price.  You can get a glass for $6, a pitcher for $24.  And if you go during happy hour (3- 6 pm, weekdays), drinks are half-price!  That means you can get a pitcher for less than the price of one drink at many Las Vegas establishments.  

The food is an issue for some people -- it's hard to know how many tapas to get, especially if you're hungry or if you're planning on drinking and need something in your stomach.  That's why I think it works best to go with a group of people and split a number of dishes.  

That being said, I think everything on the menu is good.  I've never liked dates before, but the ones here are fantastic.  I'd never tried octopus before, but I get that here on a regular basis.  The mac & cheese is good, especially if there are vegetarians in your party. 

As for service, I've had both good and bad here.  It depends on the time of day and how busy the restaurant is.  I've been at 3 pm, right when happy hour starts and it's usually fine.  So I plan on being there at that time on a regular basis.  And yes, I'm going to walk so I can have as much sangria as I want!",oxJ4R-1TqBjegZHU6h1bKg,4,2,5,zNQqc7uAwoGQIvGrSGeYxA

I love going with a group of friends or family and choosing many plates. That way you can sample much of their menu without getting too full.

But you'll get away from Firefly for about 40% less than you will at the Aria joint.  Highly recommended.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,0,0,4,r7ZEmikGjGITaDP-6uT_yg

This location is much bigger and a bit more trendy compared to the Paradise Rd. location however, that's not necessarily a good thing.

The menu offerings are exactly the same as the other Firefly location.  This time around the s/o of course had to order the Bacon Wrapped Dates, which are always a hit.  We also ordered the Ham & Cheese Croquettes which were okay, kind of reminded of a Fried Cheese Stick.  I ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms and totally forgot I ordered that the last time and didn't like it much, thankfully I did remember to ask for lemon to squeeze over it, which in fact did help tremendously.  Not sure why but, I ordered their Fried Calamari, which was really basic but wow, it was greasy.  You know that lethargic feeling you get after eating greasy food...thanks Calamari!

The service...oh boy, this is where they fail and why they lost so many stars from me.

Our server who I won't call out, was really blah.  When he introduced himself, he didn't go the extra mile about talking about Happy Hour, any specials, etc. he just simply asked what we'd like to drink.  To sum it up, we saw him four times; first to introduce himself, second to take our order and last to bring the check and return the change.  I did have to roll my eyes when he asked, ""Any change needed?""  Eff yeah dude!  However, credit is due to the food runners and bussers, they were the ones that provided us spectacular service.  I wish we could've given them the tip instead of our server.

Overall, nice location but we won't be back, we'd rather go to Paradise Rd. instead.",-vBbg7fTK3y8W0PtpzlLWQ,3,2,2,yYZ18IYHw4PoHIA_n_Z3cA

I do love everything I've tried on the menu which is a good handful of items. I cannot say anything bad about the food on a positive note. Personal favorites are the firefly fries - crispy and served with shredded Parmesan cheeses and really good dipping sauce, delicate little bacon-wrapped dates, spicy beef salad, calamari, tomato soup, sliders, chicken skewers, empanadas, and a few others. At every location the food is similarly presented every time and is absolutely delicious. The prices are a little high for tapas, but a few options shared will still leave everyone with a full and happy belly. 

The one thing you always have to get when you come with a group of friends is a pitcher of sangria or the passion fruit mojitos. So yummy! 

The service at this particular location however is another story. It has never really been outstanding. First of all, the hostesses were not pleasant and did not really appear like they wanted to be working there. 

Our waiter was hardly that friendly and did not return once to our table to check up on us and see how we were doing when we had dined there for about two hours. The busser was not very nice either. She came a few times to see if we were done with our plates when I was clearly still eating and when I told her that she seemed really annoyed. 

We asked for another serving of bread to go with our cheese fondue dish and she forgot about that. Since our waiter never came back once I had to track him down in order for us to get a chance to order some of the Nutella crepe dessert that they have. 

I think waitstaff is pretty important. They make a big part of the dining experience and contribute to the ambiance of the place. I am not trying to bag on this restaurant at all because I know I'll be back for the food, but I sure hope I'll get waited by people who know what impeccable customer service is like next time.",runIV_idgvT6jeNcT1CyMQ,4,0,2,Y0KBwgp-7To3pslYR8d-hA

We had fun, and the bar is decent, but the service was average (which for Vegas is code for ""not great"") and the food is fair. A few good tapas (I particularly liked the crispy duck egg-roll thing), most were only OK and not that special. Lots of Asian-fusion tapas, which sounds like it would be good, but it wasn't really (except the duck thing). I much would have preferred amazing Spanish dishes.

I also was a little surprised that the inside was almost exactly the same as the old Z Tejas, just a new paint job. I never liked the step-down dining room and I think a complete renovation of the space would have been better.

Quite frankly, the reason it was so crowded is because there's a dearth of places like it in or near Summerlin. Which made it fun to go to, but I'm not rushing back anytime soon.

Although if you haven't made that decision already based on all the other great reviews, you are clearly too picky!

My only gripe with Firefly has been that there portion sizes seem to change frequently and that often the dishes are inconsistent in appearance and extras on the dish. Most noticeably to me is the Eggplant Canneloni which I've gotten several times and always seems to be different sizes. Sometimes they are big, sometimes they are small, sometimes they are medium... you get the point.

5127001,2011-01-29,0,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"I absolutely love the Firefly on Paradise and I have a review of them up already. I was crazy excited that there was one now close to my house because this town spoils me to the point where I dread having to drive more than 10 minutes to have to do anything. So how does it stack up??

Initially, I was expecting the ambiance to not even come close to the Paradise location, and unfortunately I was right. It's not even close. But they do get props for a fireplace. Even though it was off to the side nowhere in sight while we were eating. It looks like a typical restaurant that you would find in this neighborhood. This strikes me more of a Firefly that people might bring their kids to, which I definitely wouldn't say about the Paradise spot. This may be due to the fact that I was there around lunch time. For some reason, the average decor takes a bit of the magic out of it all. I guess should I one day have kids, it will be nice to have both options.

The hostess was very friendly. The waiter on the other hand, was one of the crappiest waiters I have had. The guy reminded me of Andy Samberg, minus the personality. That part I don't really care about. I mean, you should be friendly in the service industry; but if you are a great waiter who is attentive, I can easily look past the lack of friendliness. This guy however never really checked on anything, filled drinks or saw if we needed anything at all.  It's like he disappeared and went to the gas station to play the machines and pick up a pack of smokes or something, while the busboy took care of everything. The busboy by the way was also pretty nice. It also came to the point where we had to ask the hostess to tell our waiter we were ready for our check. That's  just plain sad. Now I should note this was during lunch time. It's possible the other waiters during lunch and the nighttime staff are better, but that has yet to be seen.

The food was pleasantly similar to the paradise location. Not quite up to par but close enough I think. I definitely prefer the herb roasted chicken at the other location. And the menu appeared to be identical. 

I will say this, the Mojitos were a bit better here. I like that they don't crush up the mint where you wind up sucking mint particles up through the straw like the other one. Maybe it can be argued it's supposed to be like that, but in my crazy mind, this was the better version. I'm not usually much of a Mojito drinker but I'm always tempted to order them at Firefly. It kinda reminds me of Family Guy where Brian drinks a Mojito while he's on the dating show. ""I don't think it's a gay drink. Mo-jiiiiito."" Lol. My normal drink is a Jack and Coke, so it's one of the few times I actually branch out. 

So there's my overall assessment of Firefly on West Sahara. I will probably be back. Plus, if the service was an isolated incident, I'll probably be a regular.",eBWDX4a5iURWg-MA97hFpg,2,1,3,UlOlwK5OiCy0-PHyuKRMeg

The sangria was sweet nectar from the Wino Gods!  I normally don't like dates but OMG!.. the BACON WRAPPED STUFFED DATES! That is a FOODGASMIC EXPERIENCE! So, I was giddy with excited to learn they opened another location just 2 blocks from my house. Sometimes when there are multiple locations, things get lost in translation but not with Firefly. They are on point with every detail right down to the atmosphere. Every time friends or family come to visit I make them come with me and I get them addicted just like I am. I instruct them they all have to have their own order of DATES and then we get several items to share ranging from the Ham and Cheese Croquettas that just melt in your mouth, or the Artichoke Toast, or the Lamb Skewers that are tender and juicy every time! There isn't a bad item on the menu.  For those of us who are allergic to seafood, they take great care not to mix the dishes.

5167118,2010-12-13,1,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"Thank you God for letting us arrive at Firefly Tapas Kitchen and Bar.  I couldn't be more than thankful to leave the bar we were just at.  It's definitely a nice change of pace.  As soon as my friends and I arrived, I gave my boss's name and they advised us it could be about thirty minutes wait.  That was fine by me since I was still a little bit tipsy from the drinks I had at the other bar.

I decided to use the ladies room to freshen up, and they really keep that up.  It was one of the cleanest restrooms I've seen in a while.  It might just be because I was a little buzzed and when I'm in that state, I am normally biased in a positive way.  As soon as I got out, not more than five minutes after we got seated.  The hostess was super sweet enough to seat us outside where it was away from all the noise of the inside.  Seemed like people there can't hear each other well since they seem to yell at one another while in conversation.

I've been to the Firefly on Paradise Road and found that really great.  It's one of my most favorite restaurants to take my friends to when they're in town or if there's an occasion to celebrate.  I'm really glad they made one on the west side of town and a good one at that.  

As soon as we were seated, we were served with bread and butter and olives.  Mmmmm... olives.  I love olives and these olives were so yummy too.  The bread wasn't old and had the right texture, and combined with the butter was just oober delish.  It was time to order and considering I wasn't in the right mind to order, my boss ordered for me.  :D  I'm not very picky so anything would do.  I love to try different kinds of food.  I guess that's a great thing about me.  My tummy is easy to please.  

My friends ordered as follows: (Oh and I remember because it's food.  When it comes to food, I have a sharp memory.  Don't ask.)

Firefly*fries  [parmesan, herbs, aioli]
I close my eyes and remember these are the best fries I've ever had.  I keep forgetting to take a mental note of what they put in this so I can make it myself at home.  Luckily, I can just remember this review and make my own.  :)  The combination of the cheese, herbs, and aioli definitely work well together.

Empanada  [pastry stuffed w/roast pork, red pepper, w/salad, aioli]
This was delicious.  However, I think that Filipinos make the best empanada's.  This has a whirlwind of flavors.  I'm still impressed.

Lamb chops [2 chops, red wine reduction, sautéed lentils & julienne vegetables.
I love lamb when it's prepared correctly and they did a fine job getting all the flavors together.  I didn't taste any of that weird lamb after taste.  Thank goodness because I would've spat it out on the floor, or to not be overly dramatic, just close my eyes swallow it and drink the whole jug of mojitos on the table.

Plate of Serrano ham, Manchego cheese  [grilled bread & garnishes]
I loved this one too.  It definitely goes well with a tipsy body.  I think this is what helped me sober up a little.  Or it could be the combination of all the food on the table.

Albondigas  [meatballs in sherry tomato sauce, parmesan]
I will definitely order this one again.  I love meatballs and the cook was definitely happy that night when they prepared it.  The flavors definitely played with  my tastebuds and was happy with it.

Pomegranate Flavored Mojitos
I normally only like the regular way mojito is made, but the flavors of this was pretty decent.  No complaints to how this was made.  I was thinking keep them coming.  But I know I would've had to be carried out of the restaurant if I didn't stop drinking it.

I can't forget about our awesome waiter who was very attentive and on top of his game.  What ever my boss wanted, he was there to give it.  Could it be because he was under my boss's charmed spell.  She can be very bewitching and full of charm.  Or, it could just be because he's just that way with all his customers.  Great job Mr. Waiter!

My overall experience in Firefly was awesome!  My expectations of Firefly has always been high and they've always come through.  I hope everyone else has the same experience as I did.  I will go back again soon.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,4,3,5,KmyqQH6mGAe3tNP6HCaoHQ

The best part was actually the green chile sauce on top. If I knew how good it was going to be, I would have asked for a side of it. 

After eating a few tapas and a basket of Firefly fries, it was time for dessert. We split the flan and chocolate tres leches cake. I have to say I have never seen chocolate tres leches cake, but what more could you ask for? It was really moist like all tres leches should be, but had a great chocolate taste.

Service was really good. My waitress was attentive but, agree with other yelper, the bus guys bust their butts and there was always one around to order more food (yes, surprised they did this, needed more water, or plates cleared).

Food was great too - I am not a drinker but everyone else had a drink - I do not eat meat for the most part and everything I ordered was delicious. In order of tastiness:

1) Thinly sliced roasted eggplant stuffed with cheese (goat, I think), with a little tomato sauce
2) Veggie empanadas - first time I have seen empanadas served without meat - YUM, you won't even miss it - seasoned empanada eaters
2) A tie with above, the salad of apples, manchego cheese and bits of smoked almonds
3) the potato espanola thing, a potato casserole, this may have been better but, it was the last thing to come out and the other dishes were so flavorful. I couldnt tell if this really fell short of the others or if it was timing.

I had the berry lemon tarts for dessert - presentation was pretty and they totally hit the spot for the sweet little something.  I ordered this from the bus guy, and had asked him the flan or the lemon tarts - he hesitated giving me his recommendation but, said for him, the tarts. Good recommendation!

That was plenty for two people, and the bill came out to about $50, drinks included.  We left very satisfied with our dining experience.

Of all the tapa orders, only the steak turned out.  One friend's eggs came alone on a plate & her toast was burnt & not buttered.  Myself & another friend ordered the same warm spinach salad & sent them back because they were swimming in a very acidic dressing & hers didn't contain any of the red peppers.  We exchanged these for a garden salad but that equally small one didn't contain hearts of palm as stated in menu.  Either the server or chef forgot about my eggplant cannoloni for a half hour & it came only after my reminder.  Unfortunately, it was a tiny portion, mushy & obviously overcooked.  Since  they were serving pumpkin beignets, we weren't offered the bread basket with the good almond butter.  We asked; then received enough for two, & weren't offered more.

The restaurant never did see many guests that morning, and considering the faux pas on so many items we ordered, the manager could have offered a future free meal or desserts for all of us, or a glass of wine.  But we merely were asked if we wanted anything else.

As a recent newcomer to Firefly, I was not impressed and will make no plans to return to neither the Sahara location nor Paradise.

When we first walked in on a chilly Tuesday night, the restaurant seemed poppin'. After looking around, I realized most of these kids were teenagers! WHY! Is this where the cool kids flock to during the weekdays in Vegas?

The hostess seated us after a few minutes and we took our orders. I was FREEZING! Has this restaurant heard of a thing called HEAT?!?! It was especially cold for my table because we were positioned right next to the patio door. Every time someone walked through...WHOOSH! A slap of cold air delivered directly into my face. OK, so maybe I'm exaggerating a bit...but it was cold!

I ordered the meatball tapa, a nice salad, and the sliders. They were all extremely satisfying! I especially liked the sliders, but I was a bit full off of my other orders and the bread. My friends ordered the fries...and that meal...was...wow. The fries themselves weren't fantastic, but when you have a bunch of friends at a table just talking...the finger foods will inevitably be eaten just because they were there in front of us.

So that was our meal. A little pricey for the drinks...the service was subpar...and I was shivering most of the time. But if you're going here to catch up with some friends (or make new ones), by all means...go for it!

I can't say that I'll be here again because I don't live in Vegas, but I wouldn't mind returning if someone wanted to go. So all in all....mediocre.

If it was not for my friend wanting to drive around before dinner, I would still be going to the Paradise location. These two are like polar opposite siblings; one is the dark party monster while the other is a more laid back social butterfly. 

The reasons to love the Sahara location. 
1- The fireplace is a nice touch that gives off a more chill atmosphere.
2. High ceilings and adequate lighting makes it look larger. 
3. It is not crazy busy, so we were sat right away.
4. Staff are quick to drop off food, remove dirty plates, refill drinks, and even pour my sangria for me.
5. For the first time in eons, I checked the bill and it was right. (The last three times my group went to the other one, we had to get things removed because they never came or they ran out and didn't take it off.)
6. Food is still delicious (Different presentation style then the other one, but flavors are spot on.)
7. Right now they have Pumpkin Beignets. They are not really beignets, more like donut holes, but still delicious. 

The reason to dislike the Sahara location.
1. If you are sitting on the high tops near the door, a cold draft hits you every other minute. 

The Lamb Skewers were tender and juicy. They sat on a bed of lentils. I would have been happy with just a bowl of these phenomenal legume. The purple onions contributed to the flavor and gave them a nice bite. Duck Roll with a hoisin reduction will always be high on my list of to get items. The Stuffed Dates and Patatas Bravas are also crowd pleasers. 

We made the mistake of getting a pitcher between the two of us. $28 is a great deal compared to the regular price for two glass, so it was a no brainer to just man up. This man will be giving up alcohol for a while.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,1,4,oPfEVhQrbqjlcTaCSXHqjQ

The Artichoke toasts,  Padron Peppers, Firefly Fries, and Baked Tetilla are tasty as well. Not a fan of the Albondigas, a bit plain, nothing exciting going on there.
Their mojitos and sangrias are perfect belly washers. The complimentary olives and toast with butter spread is perfect. Fun place for a group to pick a bunch of tapas and share, then you get to try more.

For starters, they have an AMZING patio with shades, misters, soft seating and even a fireplace! It's great for all seasons.

I'm a big fan of Tapas because I love small bites ad love to try different things. Only once have I ventured off the Tapas menu for a lunch special (soup and sandwich I think) and I didn't really care for it.

My favorite menu items are: the Bacon wrapped dates (order one order for every person, trust me!), the Manchego Mac and Cheese, the Tuna Tar Tar (salivating thinking about it - ask for extra chips), and absolutely hands down, the Filet Mignon - it's only $10 and well worth it!!!

We hadn't dined at a Firefly in at least a couple of years so what the heck.  I actually prefer the atmosphere of this one over Paradise.  High ceilings, less cramped and more parking space.  

The menu hasn't changed much from what I remember but I did notice a couple of things like the lobster corn dogs and lobster ""escargot style"" so we got those at $10 a plate.  The corn dogs were the only disappointing dish of the night.  The breading was not good and it was kinda soggy.  The escargot lobster was tasty.  I suppose anything cooked escargot style would be.  

Aside from the usuals like bacon wrapped dates, empanadas (pork is better than the vegetarian) and sliders, we went with our waiter's one suggestion of the warm spinach salad.  Glad we did that!

So the other day she goes out with friends and ends up at the Firefly on Paradise.  Lo and behold she comes home raving and admitting I was right and we should have tried it long ago.

We loved the bacon wrapped figs (even my daughter loved it to my surprise.).  The crab claw corndogs were good and I did love the spicy mustard dipping sauce.  We enjoyed the mushroom tarts, the steak and mushroom skewers.  The crispy duck spring rolls were excellent.  My daughter liked the empanada.  On the negative, I would stay away from the big bowl of pasta.  With shrimp it cost $22.00 and to behonest, I have had microwave meals that tasted better.  THe sauce is good but watery and the angel hair was way over cooked.  Also, it wasn't $22.00 worth of pasta and shrimp.

The food itself is fine, but the prices for them brings down the rating for me. 

It seems to be more a place to hang out and spend money with the drinking + social life combo hang out. 

I prefer tapas in the Japanese places around town or dim sum.",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,0,0,3,KqNZ6ZzrOpvvwFwOlY9GdA

The crazy thing is that I actually made two separate visits in the same day with different friends, was so not planned that way however this place I could go round the clock! Is just crazy, have never been and then i go twice in one day! lol

Mouth Orgasm at it's best. I seriously sat and moaned for two hours straight, savoring every bite, not sure what the waiter and other patrons thought, so it was either, amused, aroused or annoyed? A tasty explosion in my beautiful mouth no less.

I have to say is really night and day in comparison for my two visits, the first time was at 3pm, only one other patron in the whole restaurant was quiet and we obviously were seated immediately. The next visit was at 8pm, wow a whole other world, we waited about 30 minutes to be seated and the place was packed beyond capacity, lol. I have to say either way it is a fun experience! I have listed the goodies I was able to enjoy during my two visits. Everything was scrumptious!

It's within walking distance. I'm stoked. I had the Crab Leg Corn Dogs, Duck Rolls and a pitcher of Sangria with a friend of mine. 

I'll definitely be going back.",9oqHQ9wThZD09fS-B12uzQ,2,0,5,vm9N0M99_rNf1MPsnWMoqQ

DECOR: Contemporary, Artsy, Tall ceiling created an open space feel while dimmed lighting dominated the entire venue, in fact, reading the menu was somewhat difficult but manageable, LCD TVs at the bar!

VIBE: Cool and Energetic, Loud music played throughout the Evening, Hustle and Bustle from the Staff

DRINKS: Red Sangria had that great balance of fruit and wine which resulted in a very tasty concoction you would expect, so good we ordered 2 pitchers! 

FOOD: The sweet, nutty ALMOND BUTTER that came with the COMPLIMENTARY bread was OUTSTANDING! 

**TAPAS- incredible flavors and texture for just about everything we ordered, from the FILET MIGNON to the Eggplant, the STEW with thin, Toasty Bread was delicious, the EMPANADAS came out crispy and full of porky flavors

**PAELLA- Packed with all sorts of MEAT and SEAFOOD, I could not find a single complaint about the tenderness and flavors of each element in that regard.  The RICH SAUCE that encompassed every single solid object in that sizzling, hot pan was very HEAVY but not overwhelming, the RICE was cooked PERFECTLY, however I typically prefer my rice to be fluffier but for an $18 Paella, it did its job, as far as I am concerned! 

SERVICE: The only complaint I have was it was somewhat slow at times when trying to get some attention for more bread or water or just ordering more food.  Our server was doing his best but I can sympathize with the overwhelming demand and service at this particular night.  We had to wait 40 minutes to finally get a table, so I can understand that, perhaps they were understaffed? 

Due to the quality and price of the food, I was able to overlook the slow service and grant Firefly it into my Vegas Hall of Fame!",8DGFWco9VeBAxjqsuh1aSw,3,2,5,tzE7wFy1nP2IuGPQQ2KVFw

Some of my favorites include the macaroni & cheese, padron peppers, bacon wrapped dates (these weren't as good as before, hopefully just an off night) and the shrimp diablo. 

On this particular location we brought my friend's 3 year old daughter. Not the greatest location for kids, but we were running out of options and this was a good alternative. The staff was very accommodating and it ended up being a fantastic evening.

Good company helps, so I highly recommend this place for groups.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,3,4,y0DA2ZaHvJwrEf3qm2b-4A

Sometimes one may totally overshadow the other so that nothing can really help it. That is what happened when I visited here to celebrate my friends birthday. Walking into this place it was dark but lively. The hostess were friendly and sat me right away. Be warned Saturday night was busy and they don't take reservations so FCFS. Well Jorge came by and got me started on the Watermelon Mojito (eh, not bad). We ordered the Petit Filet, Duck Roll, Ahi Tartare, Ceviche, and the mixed Paella. Believe me for two people this was way too much but it was necessary. All the tapas we ordered were delicious. The seafood was fresh, hot plates were hot. My favorite had to be the Filet Mignon as it was tender and juicy plus I loved the sides it came with-spinach and potatoes. Everything came out quick too, except the Paella but that takes awhile. While we were eating our tapas the hostess approached us bc she needed our table for a big party. Like who does that!? We were a little taken aback but we said ok. When our server came back to move us I asked if they normally do this and he said they have a few times? What? I've worked in restaurants for over 10 yrs and we have never done that. So we move and we are at a loss for words. We had a momentum of gabbing and it was lost not to mention ppl watching us move. Anyways the manager on duty, I think his name was Carlos, came by to apologize and took care of us but still it was awkward. The Paella finally came and it was enormous! It could feed six ppl. It was very tasty.  We also had the white and red sangria, both were good but I preferred the white. It was like alcoholic apple juice. For dessert we had the tarts which were the size of dollar coins but just enough for us since we were stuffed from dinner. So food was on point. Atmosphere was loud and dim, next time we'll eat in the bar. And Jorge was nice, knowledgable and attentive. But that game of musical chairs while we were eating was no bueno!",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,1,0,3,JsBgnFqUbR2q4Ndg5SocHQ

1. Gather a group of friends
2. Order a pitcher of sangria
3. Order everything that your heart desires
4. Taste a little bit of everything
5. Order more sangria
6. Take notes so you know what dishes to order and what to avoid next time. 
7. Top off the meal with dessert and more sangria!

With so many tapas options on the menu- there will obviously be some hits and misses.  Personally, there were a lot more hits- including:
- Bacon wrapped dates: sweet, salty, bacony- always a hit
- Manchego mac n cheese: one of the best mac n cheeses I've ever had
- Artichoke toast: hearts, basil, aioli, pepper- perfect blend of flavors
- Petit filet (medium): very tender, but the mushrooms and red wine sauce were my favorite part.    
- Tierra y Mar skewers: shrimp, filet mignon, and sausage on a skewer. Delish.  But, order your filet, medium. 
- Steak and mushroom skewers- another hit
- Camarones al ajillo- recommended by our waiter was the star of the meal!
- Chocolate tres leches and the Cherry bread pudding were both decadent desserts and will definitely order again. 

The items that I can do without the next time:
- Tuna tartare and the Shrimp ceviche were both missing something (maybe salt?)
- Firefly fries- if you don't mind your fries soggy- then you will enjoy Firefly's version.  I prefer mine more crispy which is why this didn't appeal to me. The aioli was tasty though. 

And of course, the sangria and the mojitos were faaaaabulous. But, that may also be because I just had a baby- and had my first taste of alcohol after 9 months. Come during happy hour and you can drink even more! The atmosphere and vibe are great.  And the service was one of the best I have encountered in a while!",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,2,1,4,Ztant0ze7faw7y1Rg8afvQ
5994624,2012-01-23,0,ugf6qjoG5h6VXR5-vpq0Qw,"We were able to slip into Firefly during lunch when it was not too crowded. With a group of 12, we were lucky that it wasn't. However, the restaurant doesn't plan so well for larger groups with the tapas styles, as all the plates we were ordering didn't fit so well on the table that we were at. 

The menu has a wide array of items and everyone should be able to find an item that they like. I personally enjoyed the filet minon sliders with a good balance between the sauce and feta. The ahi tuna was a little tough and would have been better if just seared on the outside instead of completely cooked. However, in the tapas style, it was great to try a number of dishes you didn't order to add to what you did, such as the mac and cheese which was pretty good considering I am not a big mac and cheese kind of guy.

They also have a good selection for drinks to compliment the various tapas. With a good wait staff and good ambiance, I would say I'd be back, but only if I drive, as it was a bit out of the way.",ux69F4wFyJvUNpcAoX_bAg,1,0,4,ZXKf5ABiVjK3R8i1to26UA
