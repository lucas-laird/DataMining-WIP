I am certain that are re-frying old fries from the day, or possibly even week before. I used to live over in Sunrise, and I LOVED the Angelina's on that side of town. I will never oder from this restaurant again. I wish restaurants would realize that just because you are open, doesn't mean anybody wants your food, and once word spreads that your product is terrible, and you have no pride in what you are putting in front of the very people you depend on to make a living, it's only a matter of time before your customers will start going somewhere else. I guess it's back to Pizza Hut for me.",NnzlKb79WFKppSW_0Lg1-A,0,0,1,BCch2BV5RPuacHsHxXCbDw

From their burgers, to their pizza, to their calamari--delicious!!! And their portions are way more than enough! 

Would definitely recommend to a friend!",u8DFIdpVWYXh2X1DnV5wcA,0,0,5,A7CkQG-PSq-U6IDNrBqE_g

Delivery takes FOREVER and this time argued that I hadn't paid with my card when it clearly showed it on eat 24. Also I could hear the girl on the phone being as nasty as she could be to the delivery driver... He's doing his job maybe you should do yours.,CJuka8-Hh1iwqKtlxvF2iw,0,0,2,eO2SST_irtQYwqwT9NjWRA
