He didn't even care enough to ask me which bus boy was involved. 

This CPK has one common sink for both men and women to use together OUTSIDE of the restroom in a walkway? Are they serious? Why has CPK decided to force women, men, children, and people with special needs to share a sink outside of the restroom in a walkway? Is a sink in each restroom with their respective privacies too expensive to offer to the customers they supposedly value? I will never return.",GTSv5QBAjgtTzWX1vB6gpw,0,0,1,HpPS4YzkfJC9iobGuDCKjg

We had a few questions about the menu and Jessica was very attentive and kindly answered any questions that we had.  We ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza to share.  Half way through we realized there was never a piece of chicken in any bite. We raised our concern with Jessica and she apologized and asked if she could get another pizza made, or have some chicken delivered (anything to make sure we didn't leave having a bad experience).  We didn't want to wait and told her it was perfectly fine and that the food was still good, maybe a small discount would suffice.

No chicken lettuce wraps, which were my wife's favorite.  I ordered the Ban Mi Bowl and the chicken was burned.  I said something to the waitress and nothing was done.  I got a curt sorry about that, but no further action.  Most restaurants would offer to bring a fresh plate or even comp the dish since it was ruined, neither was offered.  When she cleared the plate it was clear that I only ate about 15% of the meal, only that much because I was so hungry.  We ordered the chocolate soufflé for desert.  It was cold, barely room temperature.  I mentioned it to another waitress that was helping out.  She said she would let the manager know.  Again, it would have been nice to offer a new dish or at least take the cold plate they served off the check.  Ten minutes later the check comes with no sign of the manager and no adjustment to the bill.  But most importantly, no apology.

We've all enjoyed CPK so we hit this one up. MISTAKE. We requested outside dinning and we were completely ignored during the entire service. We all ordered booze, I requested water and that water did not show up till twenty mintues later with the meal. We had no silverware on the table, had to take some off another table, we waited for refills on water for fifteen mintues until our server brought the check. 

WORST of all we asked for a manger. We told the manger our complaints with the service and she had the nerve if we brought this to the attention to the server. listen lady the server was not present during the entire meal, we were not able to say anything to her! Mangement should never argue with a customer or make them feel that THEY are the ones at fault. She gave us a discount, but didn't close us out, so we had to wait for our same crappy server to close us out.

We've come with other friends and families and kids and babies - they just know how to treat customers and larger parties don't ruffle them.

I always get the Tostada with gluten free crust.  First visit aside when they had just opened, they nail that crust.  It's the best pretend pizza crust I've ever had and I've tried the ""gluten free crust option"" in a bunch of places.  Unless you have an allergy, the key is to have them place the crust directly on the oven shelf and not in a special gluten free pan.

1331097,2017-02-10,0,JhRxDdmZSGDG_u7cGxaYrw,"I want to start off by saying the food was good. Hence why it is 2 stars instead of one. 
So here are the problems.

1. The portions are so ridiculously small. We paid about $20 for a small 6 slice pizza that's maybe a foot in diameter at most. We ordered online and online did not say they were that small. There were no size options so I'm guessing all their pizzas are that size. We ordered the potatoes too and that was enough for only one person. We also ordered the avocado chicken rolls. They were actually good. Still small though. 
Overall we spent about $72 for a meal that left us still hungry. 

2. The customer service was sub par. We ordered delivery on grub hub. Here's the thing. We ordered extra toppings for the pizzas, and got none of them despite being charged. We called them knowing grub hub is not so great at coordinating with the restaurants and these things happen. Usually we just give the restaurants a call, let them know, and they offer to fix the order and send the proper food. We were willing to wait and everything. Here's where the problem is. Instead of offering to give us the correct order, a credit, anything, they just told us to just call grub hub for a refund for the toppings. They didn't even give us an option. We didn't want a refund, we wanted the correct pizzas. We wanted our food. But they just brushed us off and offered no help themselves. Given no choice that's exactly what we did, and called grub hub who was much nicer and more professional. 
We didn't yell, we didn't harass, we even laughed on the phone to ease the tension that goes with making a complaint. But we got no help what so ever. 

So basically if you've got a bunch of cash to blow for a little bit of good food. Great. I say don't order over grub hub. And if you get your order wrong. Don't bother calling them. They probably won't help you. 
We will not be ordering again.",Y0UppGcJruH_iO6uxZbxWg,1,0,2,rbA4f4CtjYHFuM7CFjvIOw

The bread served with the meal is tasty, but the seasoned olive oil is wonderful! I recommend the Thai Crunch Salad for a main course. Order it with light dressing; otherwise, there is far too much dressing. Also, order the dinner size, take home the leftovers (covered with a paper napkin to keep it fresh) and a side of dressing, and you can make a huge salad by just adding lettuce at home. 

The only thing I didn't like was the bathroom. There are no sinks in the mens' and womens' bathrooms; you have to go out into a communal area. It seems odd.",7hlF-dR-m-e8nFZMWao8cQ,1,1,4,ecElhBWg8P34FXlkd1GWEQ

My main concern was always that they are a family friendly chain (kid menu, high chairs, crayons, etc.) but the young staff have little to no idea how to serve a table with toddlers. For one you don't put hot pizza plates directly in front of them and it's helpful to remove all plates when we are finished as a table with toddlers needs as little on it as possible. Before you start thinking I'm an entitled mom looking for special accommodations let me explain. My children are held to a very high standard in restaurants. There is no running, throwing, standing on seats, or disturbing other guests, etc. I even clean up the floor before we leave and never tip under 20%.

Ok, no problem that's pretty common. The restaurant was not very busy at this time. (4:30 ish) After the usual to be expected struggles (drink that didn't arrive until I asked for it again when the manager brought out our dinner, no plates being removed, no water refill) I was asked, ""are you planning to order anything else because I'm almost done?"" I told her the kids would probably have their ice cream after dinner but that would be all. She said ""ok I'll bring it right out."" I was ok with this  I guess even though they were still snacking on dinner. She came over with the ice cream and the check and within 2 minutes I handed her my card. She boxed up my pizza and brought the slip back. Because I was juggling two toddlers with ice cream and trying to keep them clean and wiping up spills so the bench wouldn't be sticky for the next guest, I didn't sign it right away. About 3 minutes into eating dessert a different girl came by and said ""are you all set with your check?"" I replied, ""she ran it, yes, but I haven't signed yet."" To which she responded, ""well could you? I want her off my clock.""
While this may not seem like a big deal, it most certainly is. I was a waitress for 12 years and I can tell you, you don't rush a guest like this. I never would have even approached a table sitting with an unsigned bill until at least 20 minutes had passed and that would be after continuing to check in. I had the unsigned slip for under 5 minutes! Further, we were still eating and drinking. We are your customers until we leave, NOT until you take my money. Aside from rude, it was unprofessional. ""I want her off my clock.""???? Really CPK you already cut my first server and 30 minutes later you are that desperate to cut another that this is how your staff talks to repeat customers?? I took the signed slip to my waitress and told her that I found this approach very rude and that we would not be coming back. She said nothing, nor did she make any attempt to apologize even as I was still at the restaurant for a few minutes putting my kids coats on and getting my daughter in her stroller. She still got her 20% and I cleaned up our table and stacked the dishes, but we will not be coming back. I work too hard for my money to give it to rude people. So I hope you saved your $1.30 by getting that waitress off ""your clock"" and ruining our date. 
I asked the bartender on my way out if he knew the name of the front of the house manager that night and thought it was Dina. She didn't seem to fit my description though so in hindsight I'm wondering if the rude girl I thought was a manager was just a fellow waitress ""helping out"" by moving customers along - I'm not sure which is worse.
The 3 stars are for the food (quick and tasty)

I would like to add that the manager on site that evening, Dina, contacted me after posting my previous bad review. She was FANTASTIC! I feel completely confident that my concerns were addressed with the appropriate staff members and I am happy to say we'll get to go back for more dates!! I know not all employees are going to behave perfectly. All I can ask is to be heard and I feel confident that I was.

We ordered drinks and appetizers and once they arrived, the waitress left the food on the table and left. Another waiter walking by asked if we needed plates. He returned five minutes later with plates and silverware.
Once our food arrived, my daughter and her friend noticed crickets all over the ground and my husband felt a couple on his feet. He got up and asked if we could be moved inside and they said yes. We ended up having to carry our own plates and had to return a second time to get our drinks. No one (waitress, manager) came up to the table to ask of everything was alright or to attempt to apologize for the inconvenience. 
Our waitress seemed to give up on our table. She did not return to check and see if we needed anything or wanted to order anything. Our plates sat on the table for ten minutes and we had to get another waitress's attention and ask her to get someone to clear the table. They removed two glasses and did not return for the rest of the dishes. We waited another 5 minutes and the waitress took our desert order. Before leaving, she took a single plate with her. Another waiter brought out the desert and my husband asked if he could remove the dinner plates and silverware from our table. 
The original waitress only returned to give us the bill and said ""thanks"" when we paid and that was it.
I am not sure why they were slacking tonight. The service was not at all what we have previously experienced and the cricket overflow was disgusting. They should spray the patio at least once a month.

We love the Szechuan dumplings, and the crispy tenderness of the 'traditional' crust they use in their pizzas.  The only problem with getting it delivered at home is that everything is usually lukewarm to slightly cold, and a lot of it has to be zapped in ""Chef Mike"" before we eat.  I wondered if the food was even better if ordered and eaten at the location we usually get it delivered from, so we decided to try them this past weekend.

Wonder no more.

The food, served fresh at the restaurant, was ASTONISHING. Not a word one usually uses for a chain restaurant, but everything, from the Mexican Street Corn, (they need to serve extra large bowls of that as an option for an entree), to the luscious and decadent Butter Cake for dessert, (NOT a part of the delivery menu!) is so much better, flavor and temperature-wise.

2716958,2015-06-26,1,JhRxDdmZSGDG_u7cGxaYrw,"I really don't like writing a negative review, but sadly this is the second one in a week.  My wife and I went to CPK for a lunchtime meeting with a small group of other parents from our son's school.  After not eating at a sit-down CPK for several years due to a bad experience, history repeated itself at another of their restaurants 2400 miles away.

Right after we were seated, our waitress took our drink orders.  She wasn't unpleasant but seemed a little put out that she had to be there.  Everyone's entitled to a bad day and she was doing her job, so it was hard to be critical at this point.  She brought our drinks then disappeared.  Fifty minutes later, and with mostly empty glasses on the table she returned to take our lunch orders, now making faces as if she'd been forced to be there and deal with customers.  At that point, she'd gone from a server I thought was having a bad day but doing her job (gets the benefit of the doubt), to a server who disappeared for almost an hour, then returned seeming even irritated that she had to do her job.  What was equally stunning was during that 50 minute absence, no other members of the waitstaff seemed to notice we weren't being taken care of.  I know they saw us (eye contact) as we kept looking around for our waitress but it seemed as if they either weren't supposed to back her up.  Or they didn't care.

With somewhat limited time left for lunch at that point, my wife and I asked our waitress if our food could be rushed, explaining we both needed to leave 30 minutes later.  She said it wouldn't be a problem, so we ordered.  Thirty minutes went by without seeing our waitress again and my wife got up to leave to make her next appointment.  It was just at that time our food started coming out.  I needed to leave as well but remained to asked the waitress to please box our two meals to go, and to bring me the check.  Once again she seemed annoyed that I asked her to do something, and she even looked surprised that after ordering our food to eat there, I apparently decided I wanted it to go instead.  I reminded her we had told her we needed to leave 30 minutes from the time we ordered (and an hour and a half after we were seated).  I paid and was out the door about 10 minutes later.  I've only walked out of a restaurant without paying one time in my life.  This would have been the second time, but I didn't want CPK to stick my bill with our friends.

I like the CPK menu the several times I've eaten their food:  in full-service restaurants, in airports and even their frozen pizzas.  Most of this was before I joined Yelp.  Oddly, several years ago in Baltimore, MD, I had the identical experience at a CPK full-service restaurant there.  The management was unconcerned and unapologetic.  That was the last time I ate at a full-service CPK.  This time, the lunch venue was picked by others in the group and I figured I could get over my previous bad experience--maybe it was just a singular event.  I was stunned to see the identical lack of desire to take care of the customer here in Las Vegas:  two restaurants on opposite sides of the country that provided an almost identical experience.  I know there are a lot of CPK fans out there, but for my wife and I, this visit only confirm my original observation that I don't need to dine at a CPK restaurant again, especially when there are so many other wonderful dining options available.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,3,0,1,Rj-TrCOEBkZC6wH3JX4wIg

3222197,2015-04-24,1,JhRxDdmZSGDG_u7cGxaYrw,"Alright guys... so I've worked in restaurants so I know how hard being a server can be sometimes. However saying that, I've worked with people who are just not cut out to be in the service industry. It's not for everyone. Every restaurant I've worked in as a server, you're expected to know the cocktails and foods that are offered, at minimum. So when it took our server 15 minutes to actually greet us and take our beverage order I thought ordering a margarita was pretty basic. So another 15 minutes when pink drinks were being dropped off at the table I was slightly confused where I was informed that they were the ""platinum margaritas"" that we had ordered. Weird, I remember ordering a margarita and asking what tequila was used (the server couldn't answer that so I said well was fine) but not a platinum margarita. Upon sending it back I noticed on the menu that the platinum was significantly more expensive (which I wouldn't mind paying for, if that was actually what I wanted in the first place) and it came with my choice of chambord or grand marinier in terms of a cadillac margarita. Hmmmm... so instead of asking which we preferred she automatically put in chambord while upselling us without our permission. Shady. Fast forward to 30 minutes and four trips to the table later. I have successfully had to explain to our server what chambord is, what grand marnier is, and what a cadillac margarita is. (They don't teach these things in training?!) The manager had to stop by the table because after the fifth time when the server couldn't get a request right as simple as extra salt on a margarita for my friend, we have just had it. 45 minutes to get a simple margarita order right is completely unacceptable. I'm sorry to say this, but this has to be hands down the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. And I didn't even try the food because the service was so incompetent. Such a shame.",W6pHfnwxbzRvkKtGh0Vnxg,4,1,1,AJ3aNxfE3SWYNkHiedLL8g

Didn't have to wait long to place an order not for our food to arrive. Everyone was satisfied with their food selection and the server made sure our glasses remained full. I really loved the decor of the place. It was not like your typical CPK. I'm really happy there is a CPK closer in town now.

I think the best thing I've tasted at CPK is their salads. I'm not sure but an order is probably for two. I can finish it alone. Try their Chicken Cobb! The last time I had their pasta with some exotic mushrooms - I forget the type of noodle - it was chewy. I asked if that's how it's cooked. Yes that's how the texture of the pasta is. Chewy pasta never again.

Good news is they serve gluten free options; for those sensitive to this type of diet. Menu items include appetizers, small plates, pizzas, flat breads, soups, salads, pasta dishes, main courses, desserts and full bar! Love that their main course plates have fish choices of mahi mahi, halibut, and salmon :D Chicken and beef I believe are available too.

This CPK, compared to the one in the Riverside Plaza in Riverside, CA, has a very cool interior design. Looks like a modern industrial art studio. Their lobby is a friggin living room! Yeah go look! There's a section in the back near the restrooms, with a room divider hung from the ceiling - super nice. And the wall before entering the restrooms extremely creative idea. The concrete sink is outside the restroom doors - good idea. But y'all needa empty the paper towel trash more often okay...please...thank you.

Being Christmastime, CPK was dressed to the nines in holiday decor. Maybe it was also the fact that it's pretty chilly in the valley this week, but CPK was very warm and inviting. My Mimi even ordered a hot tea that came in the cutest tea pot!

For lunch, we split the half Thai Crunch (subbed chicken for avocado, natch) salad and the Wild Mushroom pizza with truffle oil on the side. The Wild Mushroom pizza was so good with its offerings of cremini, shiitake, portobello and white mushrooms galore. Needless to say, I lurved it.

The service was excellent. Our waitress was attentive, pleasant, and prompt--all the things you want in your service. CPK staff were also helpful and kind when I couldn't find the restroom. It's located behind a pillar, and the door frame is the same color as the pillar, so if you don't know it's there, it's a bit tricky to find halfway across the restaurant!

First, there were probably as many people in staff as there were eating. Our server interrupted us frequently, and was heavily pushing from the start a dessert we had no interest in for lunch. My food was almost taken out of my hand while I was still eating. I was asked probably 10 times in 10 minutes if I was done or wanted a to go box from about 6 different staffers. Also was additionally asked the same over and over for drink refills after we said no. 

I'm excited about the new restaurant but just let people eat and enjoy the food and atmosphere! We were patient and understanding for a while but it got to be too much so we left and walked around for a bit.

I like CPK for their Cedar Plank Salmon ($19) and their West Coast Burger (formerly the CPK Burger / $14).  The salmon is blackened perfectly and kept unseasoned by request.  It's so good that I will have my salmon with a side of additional salmon.  Their burger is surprisingly awesome and has become one of my favorite items on their menu.  The burger patty is made up of ground chuck and brisket.  It's so juicy and delicious.  The only issue with their burgers is that it doesn't come with a side.  CPK also has other things on their menu like soups, salads, steaks, and even pizza.  Their signature is the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  Overall, it's not too bad.

I came to this new location with a friend and we ordered 2 salads of the same size, but different types. What was served was very odd to say the least and pretty darn disappointing. 

I had asked for my salad to be modified, because I can not eat onions and everything seemed okay until the waitress came back to mention a small issue. 

The waitress had said that she could make me an Asian chicken salad, but the cabbage with the onions would not be included, so she suggested that I add more romaine instead. I thought nothing of it and agreed to her suggestion. 

What was weird is that this simple modification became a small food nightmare for me.

I did not realize that just by subtracting an item that I am allergic to I was going to get a miserly portion. This really should not be the case. 

As I had mentioned earlier my friend and I ordered the same size salad and my was literally half her size, yet we paid the same price for it. 

The worst part is that I literally got about maybe 2 oz of chicken for my large salad what cost a whopping $14 and this just makes me down right annoyed.

Why are you skimping on the ingredients just because I requested for 1 small thing to be removed? So in a nutshell I ended up paying for a few pieces of lousy lettuce and 4 paper thin pieces of chicken and still left hungry.

To me this is not my idea of a great dining experience and at this point I'm not really sure I'd ever come back. This experience definitely left me feeling like I got ripped off real good.",5I6-yegWr4p1mtUMwNkVtg,2,0,1,Py1a8kkWDOqYtWMBdBz3IQ

My favorite is their lunch menu because you are able to have smaller portions of bigger items on the menu. They often quite a few great things from their artichoke dip, buffalo cauliflower, salads, and their pizzas. They also offer other options for people in your party who aren't in the mood for pizza. 

This CPK is in a great location. The inside is beautiful and I just love all the outdoor seating. When I visited, it was a little to chilly outside for me to sit and enjoy my food but it was a beautiful day. They have a lot of great seating options that offer natural lighting. I also noticed several garage doors, that are more than likely opened in the summer. 

I didn't visit the restrooms, but the restaurant and tables were clean even with a steady crowd. My waiter was amazing. To bad I don't remember his name because he was super nice and attentive. He greeted us with a smile every time he stopped by our table and gave me as much cheese as I wanted. :)

CPK is a yummy place for yummy food in a great area. Summerlin is a great location because after your meal you can enjoy some shopping or a simple walk around. It is also close to Red Rock Casino.",dIHHaoF-yyIvBFEOyEQ8Pw,4,2,4,mz28rfNmtOpoSTsQbs96Xw

There are lots of dining options at Downtown Summerlin, so we didn't even know that there was one here. 

The ambiance is really nice (LOVE it), and I love that the windows really light a lot of light into the restaurant. The bathrooms are in the far back of the restaurant, but the communal sink is just outside of the bathrooms- womens is to the left, while mens is to the right, btw. The unique wall of the bathrooms (front face) are colorful with the color blue being the main focal scheme, and appear to be from recycled skateboards. I kept looking at it, in admiration, as our table was not far.

We ordered four pizzas (six slices, I think to a pie)- the club one was my favorite, the shrimp scampi was spicy, but just enough, I like it medium, the original BBQ (that was my fave before trying all these other ones), the works- spicy italian sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, mozzarella, red onions, green peppers, olives, and oregano, two appetizers- chorizo queso fundido & flatbread (one was free, *I became a member online recently*), the salad was really delicious- the original BBQ chopped salad, and there were several drinks for part of our party. I could've gotten a dessert but we didn't get it, and it's too late, ah, maybe next time. Anyway, we asked for more chips and we had leftovers.  

Our server was really attentive (I'm sorry, I can't recall her name), she was patient with us, as we were talking more than checking out the menu. We were so busy that I didn't take any pictures (darn!), like I usually do! And the pizzas, the apps, and the salad were all so yummy!!!

I usually come to try the different pizzas by which are consistently okay.

For some reason on this trip, I didn't feel like eating pizza so I got the Pasta Bolognese instead.
The pasta tasted alright and the portion was decent but the their was not enough sauce, it was a couple of dollops of tomato puree with beef, 
I had to make sure not to eat all the sauce all at once because then I'd be left with a half plate of plain pasta. 
Definitely not what I was expecting, lesson learned. 
i'll just stick to the pizzas.",bLExVDNKxXMjjZcx3YG36Q,5,0,2,bNi4DVEsYvMZQxRE4LXQBw

The quality of the food is definitely better when you get it there. For dinner we ordered a buffalo cauliflower, street corn, cheese pizza (with cauliflower crust), bbq chicken pizza, and macaroni and cheese. Buffalo cauliflower is definitely better in the restaurant, it's one of my favorites on the menu. Street corn is amazing, definitely recommend. For pizza I saw on the menu cauliflower crust, this is a gluten free option and I would think the calorie count would be much lower than the usual classic dough. After I ate it, I went online to see the calorie count and it's not much different than the usual pizza dough they use. However, if you want a gluten free option its definitely worth getting! I really couldn't tell a difference between the cauliflower crust and no one else in my family could either. Bbq chicken pizza I didn't have, but that's always a classic at CPK.

Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad - just ""ok,"" really lacking definition, funny little pile of shredded chicken on top

Lobster Flatbread - terribly tough bread and mayonnaise-y small pieces of lobster 

Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza - the only thing worth eating again, with good flavor and a nice chewy crust

Our server was extremely kind and attentive, almost to a point of annoyance (you know when they do the thing where they crouch in front of your table or put their arms behind you and lean in). Another odd annoyance: the booths near the bar have a small retaining wall separating from the dining area, and the manager kept dragging her arm/hand along the railing as she walked. This was particularly distracting when she was near my head.

We have eaten at California Pizza Kitchen restaurants since it's inception in California.  Being able to sneak into a CPK in Summerlin was a big plus, until the menu changed.  No more potato soup, no more 4 cheese pizza, and less healthy/super salty and sweet choices everywhere...I can embrace good change, but in the name of infusion, the new menu also pairs some strange ingredients in new dishes, and wipes out some long-time favorite choices.  For instance, the roasted vegetable salad paired a sweet roasted butternut squash and vinegar based sun-dried tomatoes with a balsamic dressing. It. was. disgusting. The infamous bbq chopped salad wasn't chopped--it was sliced--and the bbq dressing was altered/tasted artificial. I have eaten this for almost 30 years, and so the difference was instantly recognizable.  Our server seemed equally confused with the new menu when we asked questions about some of the strange combinations.  We attempted three times to make this work by trying various things (two dine in and one take out), but our favorites are gone; the new menu is a big miss for us. The last time we were there, the normally crowded restaurant was almost empty.

We checked out this location for the first time and it's a modern, spacious spot.  I had a half order of the BBQ Chicken Chopped salad and we shared the Original BBQ Chicken pizza, CPK's signature pizza (since 1985!).  This food is fresh and the pizza is as I remember it:  not greasy and that slightly sweet crust is fabulous.  The salad consists of chicken, BBQ sauce, corn, black beans, jicama, tomato, and tortilla chips on top: yum!  Service was excellent throughout.

Our server took long enough to make initial contact that we were able to decide on what we wanted and still have some time to wait. She initially said she'll be with us after waiting so long and then came back a few minutes later. She took our entire order then. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Egg Roll to start and a Mango Lemonade and I ordered the kids pizza for my little one. We got our drinks and waited and eventually the appetizer was dropped. I chomped down on one and was not pleased. It wasn't very flavorful and I had to dunk it into the accompanied sauce to get some slight enjoyment from the egg roll. That enjoyment was short lived when I noticed the tuna in the other egg roll had some rainbow discoloration to it. That didn't look normal to me so I didn't touch it. The other egg roll looked ok so I tried that one, but the lack of taste just left me in a blah state. After sitting for awhile more waiting for our entrees, some bread was dropped off. I'm pretty sure that should have been dropped at the beginning with our drinks....Soon after my kids pizza was dropped and she started to indulge. A few minutes later my carne asada pizza was dropped and again, not too pleased with it. I was really looking forward to it because of the failed egg roll and the pictures on yelp made it look scrumptious. But i was sadly disappointed. The poblano peppers were very overpowering in spice and the meat was not flavorful at all. I had two slices and was done. I will take the fault on this one. I asked the server if it was spicy and she said it was a little spicy. I should've known better but figured I'd give it a try. It's sad because I've had great experiences at the Town Square location. Their staff, management, and food quality has always been on point there.  Service was subpar. Don't know her name because she never gave it but she did do a check back on the food.
