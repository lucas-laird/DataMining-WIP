I usually go by protein house because I used to work their and I know the food is great however when I was looking on google maps for directions this place popped up instead. (Thank you Jesus :) 

I ordered the baked tuna Tostada.... it was only $3.50 and more than enough for me. It was sooooo delicious. The cut cucumbers and salad are nice and crispy and you can tell the food is fresh. I also ordered a protein shake and she so kindly made me 1 based off my preferences. Again Delicious

I have to say, I prefer this place to protein House or any other smoothie/healthy eating spot I've come across. Literally half the price (I didn't see anything over $10) and great food, clean spot. 


So to not be one sided Only thing I would say would make this place better is if they had wifi but then again it's not a huge place and if they did they'd have no open tables for eating customers so get yourself a hotspot  if you're coming here to study like myself",q-0Um-wv45DcHdNIyhTUOw,0,0,5,hwWlnxT673VEEeSnWQtHaw

I'd recommend this place to anyone",g4piCxqiPfVlaX8xFUxDmQ,0,0,5,UrEf8WZJawwpu_QxVtHOXA

I've had multiple occasions where the staff isn't keen on being welcoming, or getting my order right. I will not be coming back here again, not at least until they change their staff, other than that this place is good, just don't expect to be treated nice.",Eh5Ihci_poCf03AQ_5i-Ig,0,0,3,6ulY4bB1yfK35SdGtXo-FQ
