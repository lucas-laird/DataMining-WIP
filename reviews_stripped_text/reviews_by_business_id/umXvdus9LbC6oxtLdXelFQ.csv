I tried the jack in the cup(chocolate shouffle), Stella , and the mt. Fuji. I love the stella(strawberry tiramisu). The presentation of the dessert was amazing. Everything tasted so delicate and yummy. The staff was very accommodating. I had to leave for the airport right after and they asked what time I had to leave. They were able to serve the desserts quickly so I can leave on time. Love this place!",qAnyqoPMYvU_U0soS7CYVA,0,0,5,2xxxXhPLWBMx2kT6A1MHNw

141642,2013-08-08,2,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Let's make this clear before I begin...I LOVE RAKU...LOVE!  That's why i was so excited to hear about this dessert bar opening.  I thought it was a fresh idea to have in Vegas.  Like the other reviews the restaurant itself is spot on.  All white...great plates, glasses, tea pots, tea cups, silverware, they have a modern twist on them all.  I was so close in snagging a spoon for my ice cream at home. LOL!  Restroom was very cool, but I don't know how long that remoted controlled toilet will last and I figure someone sooner or later will think the sink is a trash can, but whatever it's still very cool.

Now, let me get to the part why i gave it 2 stars.  Lets get to the desserts...

Amuse:
Strawberry sorbet with mint jelly.  This was a strawberry sorbet you could get anywhere nothing spectaculor about it.  The mint jelly had no flavor and I feel was simply there for texture.  Not impressed.

Apollo:
Raspberry mousse and a thin layer of custard in between two layers of chocolate mousse topped with fresh raspberries.  Again, I did not see anything great of this dish just a typical dessert you can get anywhere.

Marriage:
Strawberry mousse, banana custard, sponge cake, fresh berries, white chocolate and whipped cream with gold leaf. This looked awesome, but tasted again like any other dessert.  Truthfully the sponge cake was dry and not that moist.

Petit Four:
Chocolate lava cake lightly dusted with powdered sugar, raspberry marshmallows and passion fruit marshmallow. Cool idea with the flavored marshmallows, but the chocolate lava cake was too bitter and nothing on the plate to balance it.  

I must add that I did think making the menu being edible was fun and creative.  

I did receive the goodie bag and I have to say that I was more impressed with the goodie bag than what I had in the restaurant.  The madelines were kinda of dry, but the almond brittle was really good and the chocolate cake was very moist...tasted like there was fruit or something inside and the chocolate top had a nice snap to it.  

Based on the quality of Raku I had extrememly high expectations and maybe that's where it all went wrong.  Presentation is great, but is the flavor or presentation better than say going to Jean Phillip...No!  These were really just typical french style desserts.  I was expecting something more creative from Raku using more inspired japanese or asian ingredients.",_O34OQgnyeJ-9w3VnjDR1Q,9,4,2,Lr1HKXc_WESGJXolbzarEg

No where did it say they were closing early today. And the waiter asked how many was in our party and then disappeared somewhere. They had us standing there for about 10 min until someone came over and said they were closing early and last seating was already over. Like ok. Wtf. If that was the case, your employee should've known that and told us that instead of making us wait and think they were going to get us a table.

224691,2015-02-20,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I have found my new favorite dessert restaurant. When you enter, there's a large wine rack behind a glass casing that separates the dining area from the entrance. There's also a wall of tea cans. 

If you sit at the bar, you get to see them making your desserts. 

I love how everything was just so wonderfully designed, white, clean, and comfortable. (Minus the claustrophobia at the bar.) The kitchen was very pretty and orderly. The waitstaff were also just so nice. :D

You can eat the menu and dip it in a delicious apricot sauce. I tried to see if the plates or the glasses were edible too. They were not. 

We tried the Mt. Fuji, Petit Four, Carib, and sorbet with jelly. Each dish was a work of art and they all tasted delicious. You get to chose what flavors you want for the filling in the Petit Four. I went with chocolate and blackberry, buuuuut I also enjoyed vanilla with raspberry. 

When they finish making the Carib, they pour a sweet sauce on top and the chocolate disk melts right into the glass. 

Switching topics to their very popular side feature. The bathroom is far too cool. The toilet is also a bidet and the lid automatically shut. The controls for it are on the right and you can adjust the settings. And even better: the seat warmed up! (I want that toilet. Haha.)

The sink was cool too. There was a little (statue) frog and some plants inside. The water does jet out and kind of splashes against your hands, but ehhh. 

Oh, and the price for each person runs to be about $25.

- Be prepared to wait. 
- Try to sit at the bar if it's your first time.

My friends & I came here after dinner around 10:30PM on a week night during the holiday season. We were seated a little after an hour wait. It's a nice little setup.. you can sit at the bar & watch the girls make the desserts or you can sit at one of the 2-3 tables of 2-4 seats. Our party of 5 was lucky enough to snag a spot at the bar. We were entertained by the girls plating the desserts.

Once we were seated, the menu was explained to us. It's a prix fixe menu where you get 3 ""courses"" for $19. You get a starter, an entree (5 options available), & petit fours. OH! The menu (like everyone else has shared) is edible with raspberry dipping sauce. Nothing too exciting, but how many places can you say you've eaten the menu, right?? 

The amuse was a raspberry sorbet with mint jelly. Light, refreshing, can barely taste the mint. For our entrees, since there were 5 of us & 5 different entrees, we all picked one & tried each. 

- Marriage: this was my favorite out of the 5.. a spongecake with banana custard inside and strawberry mousse on top with fresh berries. 
- Baton: this looked like a chocolate silo filled a chocolate cake, topped with chocolate & pistachio mousse with a cute candied ribbon on top. 
- Angel cream: fromage pear.. super pretty presentation! Delicious & light. 
- Mt. Fuji: chestnut cream cake.. tasty, but too much cream for my liking. 
- Ringo: another beautiful presentation! My second favorite: it is basically apple pie with with a candied apple filled with cream and a side of honey ice cream. 

The petit four was a chocolate molten lava cake with dried fruit and marshmallows on the sides - would skip the fruit. 

Overall, super cute dessert place where you don't have to feel bad about taking pictures of your food because everyone else is. ;)",8kblFESkorfP00ryDTBuRQ,4,2,4,II1Ro5R728RVNMrKsVIAZg

As for the desserts, we ordered the 3 course dessert and an ala carte item: mango sorbet with mint jelly, the stella, the cream puff with vanilla filling and raspberry jam and baton. I enjoy the desserts because they aren't overly sweet. I looooved the 3 course dessert. The mango sorbet definitely hit the spot, the stella was worthy and the cream puff was yummy. The baton, however, was super rich. The chocolate outside was rich, but I can stand rich chocolate (I believe it was dark chocolate). The pistachio creme, however, was way too rich for my liking. They also had this jam-like sauce between the pistachio creme and chocolate creme, and I did not like it. It tasted like alcohol to me, and I'm not a fan of alcohol. I would not order the baton again. 

The perk of this place was the edible menu. I really liked it. c:",8u40NmUttgpEpAJr249Fcg,0,0,4,IKssD7wSXBs9HBir5-bNHA

My boyfriend and I went with the three course dessert option and it was fantastic. The first course is a delicious mango sorbet with mint jelly. Incredible. The second course is entirely up to you. Mine was the Mt. Fuji and while it was a large serving size, I could not bring myself to put my fork down. It was so good. The cream that comes on top is something I wish I could keep in my pantry and eat all of the time. My boyfriend got the marriage and it was a twist on strawberry shortcake. The cake was moist and the berries were very fresh and juicy. Finally, the last course is a fresh baked chocolate cake with a liquid chocolate center. YUM! It comes with raspberry and passionfruit marshmallows and they were the more fantastic marshmallows I have ever had. I would go back just for those. 
All in all, this place is the most unique and wonderful restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. It will certainly become a place I frequently visit.

Anyways...

When we first arrived there was a line to the door. I assumed it would go by in about 45 minutes. SO WRONG! We were in line probably about an hour and a half, maybe more. I'm a pretty patient person, but it was quite upsetting for a lot of reasons. 

First, their staff didn't even have the decency to check on their customers or let anyone in line know how long the wait would be. Second, they place no time limit on their customers, they had a party of 5, taking their sweet time eating. Mind you, this place is incredibly tiny, so they took up half of the bar. Third, their pastry chefs have no organizational skills whatsoever and take as long as needed making each desserts. I do understand that fresh desserts with nice presentation take time, but this was ridiculous. Lastly, parking is pretty bad too.

I assumed the long wait would be worth it. However, it was not. I've had way better desserts with better presentation. The taste of everything was mediocre at best. I would only recommend this place if there is no line and no where else to go.

We sat at the bar and all ordered prixe fixes for the full experience. We had the mango sorbet with mint jelly amuse & chose the following for our desserts: Jack in the cup, Carib & the Mt. Exotic. I'm not going to go into great detail & describe each and every dessert as it will just sound redundant, regurgitating previous reviews. Bottom line, each is an epitome of perfectly created dessert with surprising fusion of tastes & textures that caters to the most scrutinizing palate and borders as art. 

So, why lacking a star? After telling my girls about this place & going on & on about everything that makes this place unique, we did not get the edible menus! I was so busy playing hostess/tour guide that such important highlight escaped me. I don't know if they stop doing this or if our server simply forgot, I think it's a paramount aspect of the Sweet Raku experience.",A2I7OGC_piOIkU7oMveOTg,0,0,4,F3hxUUj1V8Cag8WabbfyPg

Days before we left for Vegas, my wife started looking places to eat. And this was on top of the list. Man that was treat, a true experience. We had a coconut mouse to start with and it was heaven. Then the ""main courses"" came, and after taking the first bite, I was speechless. To be honest i don't remember what each of them was called. They prepared both in front of us from. It was fun to watch too. 
The decor was clean and modern. The only catch? There's a $12 minimum order per person. Mine was worth every penny.

It is a 2 course menu now for $15. The first option is an amuse or you can purchase single desserts for $12. You can also purchase a cream puff for $5. If you did want 3 courses, it'd be the $20 as opposed to the $19 it was a year ago. 

They no longer have the menu items on the rice paper. It is going to be a menu with the different desserts on there. They do still have the rice paper for you to eat. When I went, it was an apricot sauce. 

I had the mango amuse with a mint jelly which was pretty good. It most definitely had an authentic taste. It tasted just like a mango. My friend got the carib which is a coconut panna cota. It was very delicious, and cool. What they do is the have a piece of chocolate on top. Then they some hot ( I think it was mango), and melted the chocolate on top. It was super cool! The dessert I got was the Nasri which had a fake pear made out of sugar! It was very unique looking. There was a sorbet of some sorts. I'm not sure what flavor it was. But it went really well with the pie. I think it might have been a pear pie, but it was really crisp and flaky and amazing. 

The service was decent. At one point, I ran out of water, and no one filled it up for me. The dessert is very unique, amazing, and wonderful. I wouldn't come here every day because I don't think it's in my budget to splurge every day like that, but I would definitely go again!",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,0,0,5,YoYiiw3C5zQl4z-gN2mdIw

One of my friends that dined with us was full from dinner and did not wish to have any desserts.  She ordered a glass of wine and declined to order anything else.  We were then told that the restaurant REQUIRES the patron to order a dessert.  She was then practically forced to order something (a cheese plate) in order for her to stay, even though she physically could not eat anything more.  It was not like she didn't order anything.  A glass of wine (equivalent of a 1.5 shot) for $10 a glass isn't cheap.

The tea was too strong, over steeped or too much tea leaves.  I've never had Jasmine tea that literally overpowered my taste buds.

Place was full but it is tiny so probably 20 people total in there.   Was promptly greeted and seated.   I ordered a dessert which was a take on pumpkin pie.  The starter was a taste of a ginger chai flavored creme brûlée.  I ordered a latte to go with it.    

The presentation is aesthetically appealing.  You can tell the chefs are into the artistic aspect of dessert.   

The rest of the experience falls flat.   

I waited 30 minutes for the first course...a 2 ounce creme brulee which was nothing special, tasted like something you would get at a casino buffet.  I've had lots of creme brulee all around the country and I assure you this is not even remotely on par.   

As for the main course, the pumpkin creme tasted pretty good but the dish as a whole did not flow and the flavors of the crust and sponge cake were too subdued/overpowered by the rest of it.  There should be a natural flow to it, aromatic then sweet then savory.  They tried to attempt this with the saltiness of the crust but as a whole the dish doesn't work.   Especially with the weird fruit filling takes away from the whole thing.    

The latte was a plain old latte nothing special plenty of specialty coffee shops in Vegas that make better ones.   


Overall I paid $23 for a coffee and dessert and wasted literally 2 hours of my time.  It is obvious that their priority is presentation and visual aesthetics not service or taste.

I ordered the two-course dessert pairing: I chose the blueberry champagne ice-cream amuse and The Ringo as my main dessert. The blueberry champagne pairing worked quite nicely, as for the Ringo, it reminded me of the apple turn-overs I had as a child. I would recommend ordering the apple green-tea as it complemented the dessert extremely well. The edible embellishments on the Ringo were both visually stunning and quite tasty.

1235605,2015-03-13,2,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Sweets Raku is located in the same plaza as Kilroy's, Monta Ramen and other eateries. Do not confuse Sweets Raku with Raku. Sweets Raku is specifically located right next door to Trattoria Nakamura-Ya with a large spoon right next to the front door. 

My husband and I arrived around 8:45 pm last Friday. There were 2 seats available at the bar, where I wanted to sit (after reading the reviews, I wanted to sit here so I can see the chef assembling my order). The chef behind the bar just stared at us but did not bother to acknowledge us and offer us a seat or ask if we would like to sit down... it was just an odd moment for us. Then a female sever came out and I asked her if we could just sit there. She hesitated at first and said we could... not sure why it was a big deal for us to sit there.

But anyways, sitting at the bar was rather cramped. The woman sitting on my right hand side had a undesirable odor that was rather off putting during our time here. My husband and I both had some trouble getting in and out of our seats as well just because of the lack of room. 

It took some time for someone to bring us the menu after we sat down, as the first female employee who eventually let us sit at the bar did not bring us menus and the chef behind the counter just kept on ignoring us (what a great first impression). Eventually a male server came out and brought us menus and told us about the special $15 dessert set that comes with raspberry sorbet and my choice of one dessert. But if I just want to purchase a dessert on it's own, then it would be $12. Then he left and came back with 2 plates with their edible menu. The menu itself has no taste but you are supposed to dip it in the sauce they bring you. On our visit, we had apricot sauce. 

After we looked over the menu, we ended up ordering:

Dessert set, $15 prior to tax: As mentioned earlier, this came with raspberry sorbet. The sorbet was refreshing. This reminded me of the sorbet that tea rooms serve between courses to cleanse the palate. The dessert I picked was the Stella which is a  strawberry tiramisu. This dessert are artfully plated, which you can tell that someone with the right craft truly perfected it's display. This dessert was pretty good, but I am not sure if it worth $12 (on it's own or $15 as part of their dessert set). 

Liver Pate, $7 prior to tax- My husband wanted to get something savory and decided to get this. The liver pate was really good but the 6 pieces of bread is not enough. And although the bread was warmed and perhaps toasted (as we saw the chef place it in the oven in front of us), it didn't taste like it was. And when we asked the male server if we could have more, the couple next to us (who also ordered liver pate) got the extra bread instead of us. They didn't even bother to ask for more. And as soon as the chef gave it to them, the male server came to us right away and said he told her we wanted that bread. My husband got the chef's attention to get some more bread, which we eventually got. 
-------------------------
(Total= $23.78, includes tax)

Although we did like the food, the service was nearly nonexistent. In this little place (12 seats available at the bar and 4 small tables) there were 3 servers on the floor and one or two employees in the kitchen and one chef. Two female servers were just chatting away among some of the restaurant patrons (which I assume must be regulars). The male server was really the only one working and serving others, taking orders down and removing plates. So since he really was the only one really doing his job, this may be the reason why he wasn't very attentive for us. But when we asked for the check, the servers were just so quick to move.

Even with beautifully plated and good food, it can't save this place for a good rating. Service is a HUGE part of the dining experience and can truly make or break your night. And since I was here to celebrate my birthday early, I truly was disappointed with how we were treated. This place is overly hyped and overly priced. And with that, my overall rating for this place stands at 2 stars. 

By the way, they have one unisex restroom. Although other previous yelpers may mention how cool it is, I felt a bit confused when I went in. I literally thought to myself 'I'm confused, I just want to pee' (honestly, I really thought that). I also did not like the sink, as water just splashes all over the floor (must be a pain to clean the floor and walls). 

And also the ovens facing the bar doesn't do anything except heat things because everything is already cooked. All the chef really does is place items in these ovens to warm them (but even then, items don't come out warm/ hot by the time they get to you) and assemble your dish (especially if you order a dessert). It is all more just for show and nothing else.",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,4,2,2,xzRQQrSjib1rm8ycGy20uA

It's a small space so you may have to wait especially if you are larger group. We walk right in and were seated at a 9:30 on a Thursday, there were folks waiting most of the time we were there. It's all white space including the kitchen and bar. Seat at the bar if you can and watch them make the desserts.

There are only 5 dessert choices and the best way to have them is in the prix fixe. Each one has a theme and they are marvelous. The angle cake is a round mound with a edible halo and wings. The designs are simple but playful. 
the prix fixe consisted of- the edible menu dipped in raspberry sauce, an amuse of sorbet & gelee, a choice of dessert and a tiny chocolate molton cake with tiny marshmellows and rum raisins. The apple pie was shaped like an apple, another dessert looked like a meatball covered in spaghetti. 

We also got the caviar service which was good but not top notch. They use farmed caviar and didn't mention it until we were served. It has a weaker flavour than real caviar. But it was delight to layer the egg, onion and caviar on the tiny bread puffs.

They make excellent cappuccinos. They also have wine pairing for the desserts.

The space is wheelchair accessible, very good lighting. The servers was very sweet if rather soft spoken.

That being said, Sweets Raku has made me dream about their desserts after trying them out back in November (yes, 5 months ago). The set up is like sitting at a sushi bar (if you sit at the counter): you have full view of everything the pastry chef (that's what they're called right?) is doing. All the desserts have amazing presentations, and the wow factor is definitely there. From melting chocolate, to dry ice vapor, you will pretty much get dessert and a show. 

The menu is fairly limited, and I think seasonal as well. But there is something for everyone. This was the only place that has gotten me to like panna cotta.

1305130,2017-04-06,5,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"When my friend found out I was in Vegas, she messaged me, saying I just HAD to try out a dessert place she saw on her friend's Instagram. Looking it up, I saw that it was in the same building where we were having dinner that night, making it an easy stop.

There was a short wait to get a seat at the bar (the only seating available). The line wrapped around the glass wall filled with wine bottles. I wanted to break it and drink all the sweet varieties inside. 

Once seated, we couldn't decide what to get. I wanted to try all the different desserts, but we were full from dinner. 

The Ichigo was my first choice, because it was so pretty, but I was set on getting Mars, because it had a dome that melted. I was hoping my friend would want to try the Ichigo, but she opted for Mount Fuji instead.

Our desserts took FOREVER to come out. It felt like at least an hour and I'm sure that it was close to it. They brought out the mini tiramisus first, and neither of us liked them. I love tiramisu, so that was a letdown.

As for drinks, my friend got a wine sampler. It came with cheese that she didn't eat. I got a plum wine and sake drink that was utterly fabulous. I could have had those all night.

My dessert came out first. It was set down on the bar, and then a long-handled container of alcohol was heated until it caught on fire. It was then poured over the dome, which melted, exposing other goodies inside. I wanted to wait for my friend to get her dessert, so by the time I ate mine, it was cold and congealed. 

My friend didn't even like her Mount Fuji and only took a few bites. My dessert wasn't the best either. I mostly ate it because it was dessert and I like sugar. It wasn't cohesive at all. Every bite was different, but they didn't work well together. One was sweet, one was fruit, one was really alcoholic. I wish that there was a marriage of some sort between the flavors, but this was missing. 

The place is cute, the desserts are beautiful (even if not very tasty), and the presentations are worth the trip. Just don't have high expectations for the flavors and you'll be good. Oh, and get the plum wine sake.",lufa4bHQd3XLYQE1zXis0g,6,6,3,AFqR9eOUBXeng9-H1CHRnQ

This spot is literally dessert heaven! They don't take reservations so it's best to go really early, or really late like we did. Either way you still have to wait since the place is really small. It's worth the wait for a bar seat though, where you can see them creating magic in front of your eyes! They use everything from cakes, fruits, fire, liquid chocolates, to even jellies!

They start you off with some beverages and they come around putting spoons for right handers on your right. If you're left handed you'll need to let them know so they can switch them.

We did the 2 course dessert for $15. During this month, they had tiramisu coffee mini cup which was a soft gooey tiramisu top with powder, and delicious coffee jello at the bottom. Good for a good bittersweet start before your sweet course.

Then we shared a Mars, Fuji, and Primavera amongst ourselves! The Mars was a cake of fruits with a dome of chocolate on top that they flambéed with vodka (which means they set the vodka on fire and poured it over the chocolate)! The dome was red so it felt super Christmas~y! The vodka made the cake not so sweet so it was good! The Fuji was a fluffy dessert of yummy and that was really fun to watch them make it!

My favorite was the Primavera, which kind of looks like ice cream or dessert in a cup! A mix of yummy coconut panna cotta with fruits, and raspberry syrup poured over a white chocolate lid that melts! Oh my gosh, it was so yummy! This one was super sweet and tasty with so many complex flavors!

The only thing I felt like they could change are the alcoholic drinks. We had some champagne sake and they had added a sweet jello in the drinks. It turned the drink into an alcoholic dessert but it was thick and not liquid~y. Made it a little hard to quench our thirst with the thickness. I eventually ordered water, had some of my friend's tea, and gave my friend the champagne! The taste and flavor was good though, just maybe not for me!

However, I would definitely come back to try every single dessert on the menu!

1455458,2016-07-23,5,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I was yelping up desserts in Las Vegas and knew I had to go here after one look at those photos. My bf and I came in around 10pm and luckily found parking in that crammed lot. There's just TOO many good restaurants in this plaza for the space. After eating at Monta Ramen (which was amazingly cheap and delicious) we headed over to Sweets Raku.

Be prepared to wait. This place is TINY. but it's so well worth. Unfortunately we came a little too late and they sold out of the Ringo and the Mars :(. Literally the people in front of us got the last one. Luckily the people next to us got the Mars and we were able to get a video #forthegram..

After two of the menu items were crossed out we were left with 3 options.. we ended up trying the:

SPRING MOUNTAIN - I wouldn't get this. It tasted.. alright but didn't look that aesthetically pleasing. It's literally like a giant mound of pistachio cream. We struggled to finish this dish. 

PRIMAVERA - Okay I really just got this cause the chocolate melting looks amazing BUT it also taste AMAZING. Seriously all the flavours blend in so well and it's just delicious and the right amount.

1459625,2013-09-05,21,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Sweets Raku is the brainchild of Mitsuo Endo of the Abriya Raku fame (a 3-time James Beard Award nominee). The concept of this restaurant is a dessert bar, where you come in, order off a prefix menu, or order the desserts à la carte. Being a dessert bar, you will be served desserts only (but I've heard that they also have a cheese plate). After hearing some interesting comments about this dessert bar, I went with a buddy after my SnowFlake Shavery fix to get some dessert.

SR is located in the Seoul Plaza on Spring Mountain Road and Jones. It actually sits across the same building complex as Raku. Walking inside, you'll notice an amazing display of bottles of water and other refreshments built into a see-through wall. The clean, modern, and white interior give you a sense that the people who created this restaurant really wanted to give you an unforgettable experience. There is an open kitchen, and around it sits a bar with around 15 seats where you can watch all the desserts being made right in front of your eyes! There are also tables, but if you have the opportunity, sit at the bar and enjoy the show.

The pastry chef is Mio who is in charge of the kitchen. She's been a pastry chef for over a decade in Japan, but you would never guess due to her youthful appearance. The server dropped off a menu that was rolled up in a sugar ribbon ring. After ordering our drinks and the prix fix menu, we waited for Mio to start. The menu is also edible, and I thought that was a real neat and fun idea to be able to eat a menu!  It didn't have a taste at all, which is good because I would have gagged if it tasted like paper. The server then brought us our drinks.

- Americano coffee: They use the Illy brand coffee, and it was bold and well made.

The Amuse/First course came up first:

- Strawberry and Mint: A strawberry sorbet with mint jelly, with a fresh sprig of micromint. The strawberry sorbet had a nice strawberry flavor. The texture was sort of weird for me, it wasn't icy... but I guess it wasn't as smooth as I would have liked.  It's hard to describe. On the other hand, the texture of the mint jelly was well done, but I couldn't really taste the mint flavor that much.

The main entrees then arrived:

- Mt. Fuji: This was a play on the classic French dessert, the Mont Blanc. This was my favorite dessert of the night. The chestnut cream was amazingly light and had a smooth chestnut flavor. The cake was moist, and the chestnut glace complimented the whole dish. The presentation was also pretty cool.

- Apollo: Chocolate and raspberry mousse on top of chocolate cake, Earl grey tea ice cream, raspberry meringue, chocolate bases, and raspberry sauce. I thought the mousse's were all well made and so was the chocolate cake. The chocolate squares around the plate and the Earl Grey Tea ice cream were my favorite part of the dish. The ice cream tasted exceptionally well with the pink peppercorns that were ground on top. I thought the meringue and raspberry sauce were O.K. This was my least favorite dessert, I thought, flavor wise... it was just too safe.

The petit fours/Last Courses arrived:

- Parmesan cheesecake with oranges: I loved the concept of this dish. It is like eating two different courses in one dish. By itself, the cheesecake is very savory, and I thought that this would make a nice appetizer on a restaurant menu. But then, after eating the cheesecake together with the oranges, it complimented the savoriness of the cheesecake perfectly, and it became a dessert again! I found this to be absolutely fascinating.

- Chocolate Fondant with marshmallows: The warm chocolate molten cake was well executed with a cakey outer shell, and a warm molten interior. It was a well balanced cake. My favorite accompaniment of the night had to go to the lemon marshmallows. They had a bright, strong,  lemon flavor, and they tasted just like a lemon curd! I thought the raspberry marshmallows were lacking in raspberry flavor, but the texture was good.

The service throughout the night was top notch. The server knew when we needed drinks refilled, and cleared our plates at the right time. She was super friendly and knowledgeable and engaged with us enough, but not overly smothering.

Dining at Sweets Raku brought an old smile to my face. It brought me back to those pre-""Great Recession"" days. I remembered when the properties on the Strip were in competition with each other... not money-wise like they are now...but quality wise. Back then, F&B programs were trying to think of ways to create unforgettable experiences to their guests. Now, it's all about the bottom line, which is why we only see now burger joints, bars, and steak houses popping up, with inconsistent service everywhere. There are some flubs in this place, but you can find flaws at Raku, Joel Robuchon, The French Laundry, etc. But, this place deserves 5 stars, because.. it's the thought that counts. 

Kudos to Chef Endo and Chef Mio, true artisans of their profession!!!",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,34,35,5,QEGHbaqPVIzUtiJkXC75FQ

Sweets Raku has unique and creative twists on dessert classics that everyone should try when they're in Las Vegas. The attention to detail is amazing as well as the great customer service that is provided the moment you step through the door. Seating is very limited so it would be best to come in a small group. We had 6 people in our group and luckily were able to be seated at the bar after about a 20-minute wait. I highly recommend sitting at the bar to see the desserts being prepared! 

The Sweets Raku Dessert Set is a two-course dessert for $15. It includes a seasonal sorbet followed by your choice of one of the five main desserts.
 
Seasonal sorbet- Our first course was a mango sorbet that was topped with a mint gelée. It was a refreshing palette cleanser that was a nice segway into the rich dessert which was to follow. 

Mt. Charleston- The base was a chocolate ice cream with a lavender mousse. This was then topped with a fluffy meringue. I loved that the lavender didn't overpower the entire dish. But it did linger after a couple of bites which was nice. 

Mars- This was my favorite dessert. A white chocolate dome resembling the red planet was presented then flambéed with Hennessey by the pâtissière. As the dome collapsed, the yuzu mousse, chocolate cream, hazelnut crunch, and assorted fruits were exposed. The yuzu kept the dessert light and airy.

Mt. Fuji- Also known as a Mont Blanc, the Mt. Fuji is a fluffy sponge cake topped with chestnut cream. I enjoyed watching the prep for this dessert as the chestnut cream is dispensed through a squeeze tube resembling spaghetti!

Ringo- A deconstructed apple pie to say nonetheless. Honey ice cream is served on the side along with a candied apple filled with a vanilla bean cream. 

Primavera- Watching the pâtissière prepare this made it taste even better! The base was a coconut panna cotta followed with strawberry sorbet, chocolate cream, fresh raspberries, and a rose water Moscato gelée. A white chocolate disc was then placed on top followed by a raspberry sauce pour over that melted through the disc!

Nicest and most courteous girl ever. *SIGH* If only I was sober enough to have asked for her name, or even have the receipt spell out for me as I write this review.

She even got me to reconsider placing a pre-order for one of their holiday items. Onto the food...
Cutest desserts ever! I honestly snapped multiple pics of my main dessert, Ichigo, like it was a model.

In a small busy, little outlet of small shops and restaurants in Chinatown, Sweets Raku is unbelievably clean and beautiful. I had seen videos of this place on food blogs and immediately went to try it on my trip to Vegas. We got there at about 11:20pm (they are open late, till midnight, which is very cool). There was a line out the door, but understandably so. After about thirty minutes of waiting, I realized that everyone around me had buzzers and I did not. It was about 11:50pm at this point, and someone had just walked in and asked for a buzzer and was turned away because they said they already had booked up their wait until close. I was immediately heart-broken because I thought I wasn't going to be able to eat there. I decide to just wait in line and see what the servers would say. Amazingly enough, the girl allowed us to be the last customers. The staff is mostly Japanese (as that is where the pastry chef is) and were very sweet and on top of it all. They gave great service and kept the small restaurant very well managed. Our meals took about 30 minutes, but that is very quick for having freshly prepared, handmade, beautiful deserts. They are interactive as most of the deserts have one last preparation as they are in front of you. The pastries were delicious, light and airy, flavors bursting with every bite.

Lunch will usually take about three hours (watching them make it + eating the yummy goodness!) so make sure you have time. This does not include the wait time if you go after opening time. Super neat experience. I can't wait to take friends here. 

Very clean, small portions but filling, pricey for what you're getting, elegant/pretty and the employees are very nice. Some stuff were just okay (i.e. mango sorbet), some are awesome (i.e. salmon croissant), but overall, you go for the experience of watching them make the pretty food. 

Make sure you try everything! I highly recommend the prix fixe menu.

UPDATE: No more edible menu. A lot of stuff are premade and they just assemble it anywhere on the counter (usually towards the kitchen), no longer making it specifically in front of you. It'll still take them about 1.5 - 2 hours to make you your food b/c they're making other people's food and you're just waiting. It's still very pretty desserts for the most part.

Ambiance
The place is very small and intimate.  It's a very classy modern set up.  Most of the seating is at the bar where one can see the kitchen and the employees making the food.  

Food
Very detail oriented in preparation and presentation.  It's almost like coming to a show with how much I can take video of their food making process.  The quality is top notch.  The Ichigo runs out early at times every night.  The food can be pared with a wine tasting which is a nice touch.

It was just the last 2 out of 5 seats still available at that time. We ordered one dessert to share and a drink. We ordered Ringo which is crisp apple pie, honey ice cream, cream & caramel filled candy apple. The apple pie was indeed super crisp and so good, the honey ice cream was too sweet for my taste. I enjoyed the candy apple the most, watching the shell started to break and melt as the cream and caramel filling came gushing out. The waiting line got super long as we were dining there and until we left the place. And upon watching them work, I don't really know why. The service was super slow and they were not understaffed. Even when there was empty seat, the next people in line never got seated until 15-20 minutes later. It also took a long time for our order to come out, and there were like at least 5-7 people preparing the desserts in front of us.

The decor is very clean, white and modern. There's an impressive wine shelf covering most of the front of the store. My friends and I got in at the last minute before they closed and were able to sit at the bar. I wish I had a better memory of this, but I think most of us got the prix fixe menu which is basically an appetizer dessert and your full-sized dessert. 

I had the Jack in a Cup which is a chocolate souffle with a hot, creamy banana concoction underneath. There were various jelly-mousse things decorating my plate. Nearly all their dessert dishes are beautiful and sitting at the counter, you get to watch them make it in front of you.

I also had a Cherry Blossom tea. When we walked in, I kind of gushed seeing the familiar Lupicia tea brand. They make awesome fruit-infused teas, so I was anxious to try one that I never had before. The tea went well with the dessert. I just wish we had more time to hang out there even though we pretty much stayed there past closing time.

Sweets Raku popped up at the top of the list.  We flipped a bitch and made a turn and then another turn before pulling into a packed parking lot on the NW corner (sort of) at Decatur and Spring Mountain.  Lucky to find a parking spot after pulling into a busy commercial center, we made our way to what could be the end of the dessert rainbow.

Tight quarters coupled with a wait normally make me freak out.  But walking through the door, I could see and smell this place was special.  And so we waited behind a party of four and another 1/2 party waiting for the other 1/2.

Time ticked by and we occupied out time looking at all the beautiful pictures on yelp.  This garnered the attention of a party of two ladies who checked out the photos before one of them remembered they had the yelp app on their phone.

As we entertained ourselves in the hallway by the front door, eventually the party of four were sat at.  And eventually the party of 1/2 now two were sat.  

In nervous anticipation, we waited as my eyes survived the surroundings.  All white was the surroundings.  The chefs moved creating curious pieces of tasty looking treats like Willy Wonks's Umpalumpas but the were much more adorable and precise.

We ordered off a prefix menu and had three amazing sweet treats that I could not even tell you what the hell they were and that includes devouring the menu...literally.

Both Mr. B and I were in awe with the work she did on a wedding cake that she was working on when we walked in.  We knew right then we were in for a treat getting to sit at the counter and watch her make our desserts.
 
This innovative restaurant focuses on dessert only that is served in courses thru their set Prix Fixe menu (1st amuse, 2nd Entree/main dessert, 3rd petit four)  or you can order the feature dessert items ala carte as well. 

Rant: We witnessed some guests that had an issue regarding the price ($19) + no sharing on Prix Fixe menu. Seriously you're going to squawk forking a couple dollars more? For what you get, that's an exceptional deal!  If you dine at some of the upscale restaurants you will pay the equivalent for just a single dessert. (Mr. B reminded me about the time I dragged him to MO for the tiny cupcakes and 1 pot of tea $50..lol) Too bad for the people that walked out because they couldn't get around the no share policy. Your date missed out on an awesome dining experience. (and you lost your baller status Mr. I Drive a  90k+ car) 

Back to raving:  Even though we were full from dinner and shaved snow as it was,  I managed to get the Prix Fixe with Apollo as my choice dessert and Mr. B just got the Veil ala carte. Dessert was superb!  Especially made us much more appreciative of it when we got to watch Chef Mio carefully prepare each of the components and details of the desserts with such precision. Watch the procedure when she makes the bird nest topper for the Veil. It's crazy!

This place was a bit difficult to find. We came here initially to have shaved snow desserts over at Snowflake Shavery.  I knew this place was close by but couldn't see any sign glancing around Seoul Plaza. Finally we spotted the silver spoon to the right of the storefront. Thanks to Roger T for replying to my SOS quick for that visual cue
.

My mans bday came up so I thought why not try something different for dessert & I chose wisely.
We walked in around 9pm & were very lucky to get seated right away. The staff is very nice & loved hearing that we were newbies & got word of them on yelp. 
We decided to share the prix fixe menu since we just had a big dinner & it was perfect. I took pics of everything & by far the best part was watching them assemble everything right in front of you. I also need to mention that the aromas in the air were unbelievable. One moment it smells like chocolate & the next it smells like vanilla cake. I wanted to eat the air in that room! 
Everything that is presented to you is so delicate & beautiful. Every plate was artistic & memorable. 
My very favorite plate was the last one, a warm cream puff with vanilla & strawberry. My least favorite plate was the Mt Fuji and I loved that it was delicate & not very sweet but I felt it needed something else to it. Some extra flavor or texture, not sure but that's the only thing I wasn't impressed with. Overall the experience was incredible & I very much look forward to going back to try something different.

We loved the atmosphere (it's very intimate and I love the white marbling everywhere) and everything we tried here was absolutely wonderful. Our server Yuka made sure we all had a great time.

They make changes to their menu every season. We ordered all five of their main desserts they offered in the spring which were:
Ichigo - White chocolate cup filled w/ strawberry mousse and cake & strawberry candy filled w/ strawberry sorbet and condensed milk.
Miyabi - Similar to their Mt. Fuji w/ cake and cream & berries on top.
Mt. Fuji - Chestnut cream cake w/ coffee-flavored cream & shards of chocolate.
Mars - Chocolate hazelnut cream , yuzu mousse , and berries & served flambeed w/ brandy.
Angel cream - Fromage and pear w/ white chocolate wings & a pulled sugar halo.

Desserts are very light and delicate. We ordered every single thing on the dessert menu and we didn't get a sugar crash. My favorite was definitely the angel cream and they even had a special ""Happy birthday"" white chocolate decoration & the workers came out to sing to me. We ordered their Sakuranbo tea (Japanese cherry black tea) and Tsugaru (apple green tea) for our drinks. We also paired our desserts w/ a bottle of peach moscato. Other desserts we have tried were their vanilla raspberry cream puff , earl grey ice cream , raspberry sorbet , and macaroons. They also have a small savory menu to balance out their desserts. We tried their proscuitto and salmon tartare at the end. They gave me a small bag full of their pastries (chocolate croissant , blueberry brioche , and custard brioche) to bring home too.

Dining here is more of an experience rather than a going in then out sort of place so plan on spending quite some time here :)",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,2,2,5,3qpTL4Fs2zShAix97LsAVQ

I first discovered this place with my friend on a Vegas trip two years ago. I was so mesmerized by the edible menu with apricot jam and the creativeness of the desserts. I knew I had to bring my husband during our most recent Vegas trip. 

We came on a Friday night after dinner and it was busy. The shop sits about 25 people max but the wait wasn't long at all. The sign outside the shop says ""Raku"", but don't get confused with the restaurant, which is a few doors back. 

I tried the 2-course tasting menu, which includes a preset raspberry sorbet as the first course and a choice of one item from the a la carte menu. The sorbet was fruity and lightly sweet. The rose petal on top is edible. I picked the Ichigo for my second course and it came with a white chocolate shell filled with cake, pie crust, mousse, and strawberries. It also came with a strawberry candy filled with sorbet and milk mousse. There's different plays on texture and strawberry. 

My husband ordered the Mars a la carte menu and its composed of chocolate hazelnut cream, yuzu mousse, berries, white chocolate, and brandy! Yes, brandy that is flambeed in front of you! So make sure you have your phone on video mode! His dessert tasted chocolatey and you can definitely taste some alcohol. 

The desserts are fantastic both visits! The story of each dessert is created and unfolded in front of you, which makes for fun and yummy experiences!",3JJGEQ6nV3edLA9Aso2mNA,2,2,5,m_mcUF9TvDI3gwhv7nmgGw

This is in the same shopping center as Raku the regular restaurant, but Sweets Raku is towards the front of the parking lot! We were confused at first and didn't know they were difference restaurants. 

FOOD:
Red rock (4 stars): Raspberry and white chocolate go so well together. The raspberry sauce is really good. My favorite dish out of the ones I tried. The sauce in the cake part is nice and warm too. All the textures work really well together. 

Baton (3.75 stars) Couldn't taste any pistachio in the dish. The chocolate cake with what tasted like a raspberry or wine like sauce at the bottom was really rich and good! The passion fruit gelee bits were also good. You can't taste all the individual flavors together though, I had to specifically look for each component to get that flavor. But I did like the chocolate wafer it was covered in. 

Stella (3 stars): My least favorite. Definitely not a tiramisu. More of a strawberry tart. 

Calbri (3.5): If you love fruits and mango you should get this one. Very pretty dish and great presentation. The most fun to get because they poor a sauce over the chocolate covering the glass. But the dish is not so pretty once you start eating it because the glass starts getting smeary and you can't see what you're eating from the sides of the glass anymore. It had a lot of components but you mostly taste mango. 

Such beautiful presentation. It's a great experience, makes you feel fancy in Chinatown. I love food art so I had a great time seeing the beautiful dishes come out. The flavors just didn't live up to the presentation. Each dessert was $12 and each person needs to order one. I just didn't feel like all the flavors in the description came out in each dish. I have the biggest sweet tooth and I love desserts, so I am a little more picky about them being perfect. 

ATMOSPHERE:
Very pretty restaurant. You can sit at the bar and watch them make the desserts. They first come out with edible menus which was really cool. They give you a yummy raspberry sauce to dip it in. And I had to check out the bathroom after reading reviews on here. It is a really nice bathroom, haha, so check it out as you wait. 

SERVICE:
Our waitress was really nice. I noticed when someone was about to walk in the door they say something out loud to let the waitress know to come out and greet them. So service is important to them. They also put a cute chocolate sign that said happy father's day on one of the desserts for a father when we came in on father's day, so nice.",kSyhGgF0uuFDleLcgyTSgw,2,0,3,bQcSbq9cfH4U01Ty8NeMGg

So I braved the parking again and actually tried this place.  I figured I had to try this place as pastry is what I do. :-)

It was ok. The concept is cute. And they finally got a sign!!!!!!! 

Edible menu was just rice paper with Raspberry Sauce.  I guess if you've never seen rice paper it's amazing but I see it all the time so nothing special for me. It would have been nice if the sugar ring was flavored and not just pulled sugar. 

Orange Sorbet.... too much air worked into it.  Otherwise, the flavor was good. 

I had the Angel something.  It was good and very pretty. Flavor wise....I wished that the pear flavor was more forward.  It was light and creamy but really nothing stood out. 

Also had the strawberry Tiramisu. This one was much better.  More forward flavors and it felt like a complete dessert with the different textures in the dessert.  The cake part of it was my fav. :-)

They called it hot cream puff but I guess I like my cream puffs a little softer.  This one was rock hard.  The chocolate custard had just the right amount of bitterness to it but the blueberry jam inside threw me.  I would have just preferred it to me plain chocolate. 

Would I come back.  No. Was it a good experience to have yes. 

~~~~~~~~~~~

This review is just based solely on parking and the lack of signage for the restaurant.  

Ok. If this was a brand new restaurant I could understand why there are no signs for the restaurant.  BUT really??  They can't spend the money to put a sign up to let their first time patrons know where they are located?????  Really????

And seriously, parking or rather the lack there of parking? What's the deal?  You can't let your first time patrons know that parking is bloody murder? To add on at least 30 minutes to try and get parking or tell them to park at another plaza and walk over?  Is that so hard to let people know? 

I called to ask them where they are located while I was sitting in front of Raku(which had a sign). The girl on the phone laughed and said yes no sign like that was a good thing... and then when I mentioned the parking she just laughed again and said to just drive around and look for parking.  Nice.  No help at all just a lot of laughter.

This pretty much makes me not ever want to try this place.  If I ever do want to face the parking again I will update this review with what I thought of the food. From what I read... mixed reviews.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,2,0,3,05L5R_8arFSLNiTAhGIupw

Sit at the bar if you can so you could watch the chefs in action. We ordered the two of the 2 item combo for $15. Each plate is about $12, so why not get a little something extra for $3 more.

I ordered the Mars which is that red half ball you see in pictures. It has fruits such as raspberries and yuzu covered in chocolate. The chefs light up Hennessy (alcohol) and pour it on, so you'll get a little bitter taste, but it's good! The 2nd item was a coffee sorbet, so flavorful and had coffee jelly.

My gf ordered the Primavera, which was coconut Panna cotta, with fruits and raspberry raspberry sorbet. The 2nd item that came with it was a raspberry sorbet, very flavorful.

You will not find this artistry, this painstaking attention to detail, this serenity in any other dessert place in Vegas. I highly doubt it. Raku, the savory side, swept me off my feet two years ago. And the sweet-offering sidekick has done it to me again.

Enter this modern space to find a bar surrounding a dessert prep area where you can watch staff blowtorch, arrange, pour, roll, and form wondrous Japanese-style desserts. Like European pastries, Raku's creations are light and not too sweet. They also show great finesse in how they are presented and made. The flavors are so complex, and Raku's staff skillfully balance the rich and sweet with a little bit of tart. Do as they instruct, and eat everything the way they suggest. You won't have any regrets.

Their macarons are to die for, especially loved the green tea and red bean macaron. The fixed price, two-course menu option, with optional wine pairings, is a steal when you consider the level of expertise and work involved. I had the blueberry sorbet with the coconut panna cotta. Not only were these desserts beautiful to behold, they were also refreshing, sumptuous, and unique.

Right now there is a line inside the store but because the shop is so small the noise sounds very loud. It somewhat ruins the classy, sweet, relaxed atmosphere the store originally has. If they can have the line be outside then it would enhance the tone of the shop. 

Their bathroom is fancy! Japanese butt washing/massaging toilet. They also have a stone like cylinder as their sink.

Food:
Excellent! Being an Asian with a semi sweet tooth, it is hard to find dessert that I can enjoy eating without it being too sweet. A lot of American desserts are hard to enjoy simply because the sweetness is so strong that I can't even finish it. The sweetness level at Sweet Raku is perfect. Sweet enough for you to enjoy every level of the dish. It is not overwhelming at all. The decorations are just beautiful. It is simple yet it holds a story.

Price:
Very reasonable. Could be charging more if you ask me. Just the kitchenware and the presentation alone says ""high class dessert"". I ordered a 2 course dessert meal which includes a mini shot glass tiramisu for appetizer and a coconut/raspberry parfait all for $15 (tax not included)

Service: 
Most of the workers here are sweet and very polite. Some smile more than there's but overall the experience receives a thumbs up.",dlVCAhA_DpjQoxGT4ehVgQ,0,0,5,JkrDwqDGXBthaYeiBHM4Sg

Cons: Located in a small plaza so parking sucks all the time, usually cannot find parking during dinner hours so you have to park at the plaza next door and walk over, not a big deal. Another con the place is TINY... There are 3 4-tops against the wall and about 12 seats at the counter. Very crowded seatings!! There is usually always a wait... I have been there when the line goes all the way out the door... Definitely try to go right when they open or later. Another con is that they no longer have the edible menu that they had when they first opened :(

Even though the parking and the line situation sucks... I would definitely go through it for this place. Great service, the ladies are so nice, offered water right when you are seated and we were greeted warmly. If you sit at the bar you can see the ladies put dessert together and it's such a piece of art. The desserts look good and tastes good! 

The ladies are also very nice, whenever they pour sauce over a dessert or set something on fire, they let you know and count to 3 so you can take pictures or videos. Very considerate of us foodies who want to take pictures of everything. 

I have been here twice now and would definitely keep coming back since their desserts change from time to time.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,0,1,5,0WbSNjAL26tcwH9jWbmjPQ
1994840,2017-03-21,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"After 3 years of wanting to try Sweets Raku, I spontaneously got the chance to go on one random Tuesday night!!

I was expecting the edible menu and a three course pre-fixe that I kept hearing a lot about, but there was no edible menu and the $19 three course had turned into a two course for $15.

The first course was the seasonal raspberry sorbet and a second was a choice of a specialty dessert. Since there were three of us, we each chose different ones and we picked Ichigo, Mars, and Mt. Fuji. The presentation of the desserts were amazing, but unfortunately I was not blown away by the taste.

What I had:

Seasonal sorbet - 4/5 // Pleasantly tart with it's raspberry flavor and chocolate crunchy balls on the side. It tasted exactly how I expected it to be, but the crunch balls made me giddy inside since I love eating anything chocolate with a crunch!

Mars - 3/5 // The dessert that gets cracked open with a flaming sauce! There was a VERY strong unpleasant citrus flavor that came out of nowhere that caught me completely caught me off guard. I thoroughly enjoyed the dessert until I hit that overpowering flavor and I honestly can't remember anything else about it because that became my main focus.

Overall, I loved the presentation of the desserts but I was disappointed at the taste. Now that I've finally tried Sweets Raku, I can't see myself wanting to come back.",8RuySv_b1YVWVK_0mMqKOw,4,1,3,7wruVpUT6KLAsRLRaFtFYw
1999511,2014-10-12,4,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"This is performance dessert:  sit at the bar to watch the delicate menu items come to life, the chefs using unusual tools and even tweezers to make sure everything has perfect presentation, then try to have the heart to eat the art. The $20 pre-fixe includes an amuse-bouche palate cleanser, your choice of main dessert, and ends with petit-fours you can customize by flavor and filling.

Amuse was a flavorful pineapple sorbet topped with lychee jelly.
The CARIB is visually stunning, served in a wine glass covered with a candy lid that is melted with heated fruit sauce as it is served falling into the glass to mix with the other ingredients prior to eating: fruits, custard, caramelized banana, and mango jelly combine harmoniously.  By far one of the more unique desserts I've tried. 
The MT. FUJI is a delicate sponge cake with custard, topped with delicate ribbons of coffee-flavored cream and shards of chocolate. This dessert was more in line with what I look for in desserts, and seems to be a safer menu option.
Other options are the STELLA (strawberry tiramisu), the RED ROCK (raspberry lava cake), and the BATON (pistachio cream in chocolate tube). 
The PETIT FOURS, similar to profitroles, available in customized flavor fillings and jellies. Raspberry and black currant was a good combination. Presentation even for this simple ending is beautiful, completed by a smear of citrus sauce and two house-made marshmallows.

All of the desserts look amazing, and with the amount of business they get in the evening you are sure to see them all. Unique place to experience even if you're not a dessert person, definitely a place I'd suggest all locals go at least once for a sweet date night. It's like an intimate, made-to-order version of Extraordinary Desserts (in San Diego).

The restaurant itself is very quaint and modern, with a pretty crazy bathroom that has an automatic lid lifting bidet and unique sink. The associates in the store are all very friendly. After reviewing the menu and learning about the 12 dollar minimum per guest (you've been warned) I opted for the Carib and Mars. 

The pastry chef creating the dessert was meticulous and extremely detailed with the creation. From the careful color spraying of the Mars dish to the piping of each part of the Carib cup, it was like watching an art piece come together. However, the disappointment was mainly with the flavor of the desserts even though they looked so pretty. The Mars white chocolate dome gets a nice dosage of flaming cognac to melt the chocolate and expose the inner ingredients. I felt as though I was just eating a super fancy yogurt, because the base had some granola and the ""filling"" was topped with two berries. The Carib cup was covered with a chocolate kid and then some hot filling is poured on top to drizzle through the lid and into the cup. The flavor was not good nor bad, but I just found it odd to mix coconut panna cotta with hazelnut, mango, and melon. 

Overall, this would not be a place I would wait 30+ minutes like some people did. I also ended up spending about 30 bucks for two people. If you're into the experience and nice looking foods, then I would highly recommend visiting at least once.",lZiqaMOH-thX0t48mT0Qug,0,0,3,qhgO-QeQMtcVW8XN_FkEMA

Exterior: at the China town of vegas. When I saw the video of the food, it was hard for me to believe the food was served at a small shop at a dark parking lot. There was two raku in the plaza but the one in the back is closed or something. Raku sweets is the one on the side with a red carpet and big spoon.

Interior: cute but small. Cute candy box on the wall and a wine glass. The store is really small though so the wait for it is kinda long. There was only 4 family in front that were either actually a family or just couples yet it took almost 40 minutes. So expect a small line yet long wait.

Service : really nice and friendly servers. They try their best to make the food come out as fast as possible but it still takes a while. The water refill is a bit slow. The friendly smiles you get makes up for it though. 

Food: I love it the desserts there. But I was super disappointed when they ran out of the ringo though (the apple dessert that you have to break open). So instead, I ordered Mars and the carib. Mars was unique. The heat brandy and light it while pouring it down to the dessert which melts the chocolate on top. The mousse was good but the brandy was strong. The carib dessert was the best. I wasn't expecting much because I dislike cinnamon but I didn't even taste it. After eating Mars which had a strong taste, the cup dessert was light and refreshing. The fruits and mousse went well with the sorbet melon balls. The mango sauce that melted the chocolate on top was a perfect match to the dessert overall. The carib dessert is a must try.

We walk in and my mouth kinda dropped, open modern kitchen and it reminded me of being at a sushi bar. Everything from the flow of the space  to the sleek modern kitchen equipment to the friendly smiles, was so inviting !

Puff pastry with fresh pâté a choux, raspberry and fresh cacao .
Apple pie - deconstructed Apple pie, honey ice cream and a edible cream filled candy apple ... All 5/5

FOOD
There's a minimum order of $12/person so be prepared to buy something if you come here. It doesn't have to be dessert as they have some wine and savory foods as well. All of the desserts are $12 each, but you can order a combo for $15 that includes a main dessert and a scoop of sorbet. The menu rotates all the time so this review is for the November 2015 menu.

Ringo: Basically apple pie turned into art. The pastry was super flaky and the apple compote was perfect. It's served with a scoop of honey sorbet topped with cinnamon and a sugar apple filled with whipped cream and honey. AMAZEBALLS. This one is a must-try.

Carib: Panna cotta served in a wine glass with fruit. This one was the least worth it due to the small portion. It was still pretty cool served in a wine glass which is covered with a thin piece of chocolate. They pour this warm sauce through the chocolate which melts it and is fun to watch. The fruits are very fresh and the textures in this dessert are nice and varied.

Mt. Fuji: Chestnut cream cake. Very light and not too sweet. This was the least interesting due to the flavor. I would not get this again.

Sunset: I was under the impression that this was supposed to be a 'pie' but it was more slush. The peach moscato flavor was very strong which was a turn off for this dessert. It was also slightly stressful to eat this one as it melted quickly. Other than that, the pastry was good.

AMBIANCE
The shop is small with about 4-5 tables and bar seating. By the time we left, there was a wait. Everything was white and super clean. I loved the wine display case in the entrance and the cool wall art. I felt pretty fancy eating here LOL. Even water was served in fragile glass tumblers with fancy coasters.
  Even the bathroom was visually interesting! The sink looks like a well complete with rocks, twigs and a porcelain frog. The toilet is Japanese and has those butt washing buttons.

The dessert bar seats only a number of people, less than 10. Upon seating, they'll provide you a menu as well as a pre-fix menu. What's interesting a bout the pre-fix menu is that the ring is hard candy and the menu itself is edible. Similar to unleavened church bread. 
 
The dessert here is good. Didn't think it was great. Subtle, simple, and not overpowering. Presentation is like artwork. Drink menu is full of dessert cocktails and dessert wines. The Red Rock which is a raspberry fondant with gelato is unique, colorful, and quite good. Another dessert that is very good is the Carib which is a coconut panna cotta. What's interesting about this dish is watching them make it. it's served in a wine glass with a printed top layer of white chocolate and warm mango sauce poured over.

From the edible menu to the petit four, the whole experience was very unique and tasty. 

My suggestion is to get there early as they do run out of items. We were able to try the Marriage but they were out of Mt. Fuji. =( Ringo comes with a candied apple made out of sugar and marshmallow!

They prep the desserts in front if you sit at the bar. They prep with such eloquence just like how food is prepped at Raku; not a bit of attention is left behind. The coconut sherbet is to die for, with the Mt. Fuji, and i topped it off with a cream puff. Seriously a 3-course dessert in itself. 

One tip, dont bring rowdy kids here. The place is small already, loud uncooperative kids kills the experience, ""Thanks"" to the lady sitting at the tables behind us.",9CdjLCciQL-vP8409B9Pzw,0,0,5,8M3WIqSDvLShjChegVl_5Q

This is dessert fit for fine dining! It's elegant, beautiful, refreshing, and light!

We came here directly after dinner at Raku and I was concerned of being too full however I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious and airy the sweets were. They also offer flavor tea such as apple green tea that work well in settling a full stomach. 

Decor is modern and cute!

As much as I loved Raku, sweet Raku was just as wonderful! You get a selection of 5 different beautiful desserts for $12 or $15 bucks for an extra dessert (sorbet or small Creme brûlée). 

The raspberry sorbet was tangy and refreshing. 
The apple green tea had a great apple flavor. You get a pot to share. 

We got the Mars as the main dessert and so happy we did! We get a show and a yummy dessert! Mars is a yuzu mousse and chocolate cream with hazelnut covered by a white chocolate dome flambéed with brandy! That is a mouth full of creamy deliciousness. Not too sweet. 

One of the best desserts we've had!
Highly recommended!!",CdjhLoudvFZ2VfVIvGxL3g,4,4,5,5T4bpESicVegQF1jz29hmw

What if you were not a fruit person? Most of the desserts contained berries or coconuts or some other fruit. 
The water smelled fishy and the waitresses seemed annoyed. We were here on a Thursday night at 10:30 pm and the place was super busy.  2 stars for trying really hard to be trendy bit the flavored were not worth the $60+ bucks we spent on 4 desserts.

The interior is a stark yet warm white.  Everything is white and it's nice, very clean feeling.  We went late one weeknight and walked straight up to the bar and were helped right away.  The decided to go for the two dessert option where we each got a seasonal dessert which happened to be watermelon, sorbet, mint, and gelatin.  This was honestly very surprisingly amazing and super refreshing.  We then each got to pick our own other dessert from their specialties.  I got the spring mountain which looks like a bird's nest.  Hiding inside the frosting twigs was raspberry cream, and a few other delectable layers that I don't want to describe because I unfortunately forgot.  My date got the carib which if we were judging solely on presentation would get a 5.  It is mango puree and ice cream inside a wine glass with other flavors, a cinnamon cookie stick, and a white chocolate disk over the top.  They then melt the disk with a warm mango sauce.  Everything here was amazing!

Now that I am done talking about the food, please, when you are here, try the bathroom!  I am not kidding; it is so awesome.  It is all bright red in contrast to the white restaurant and has one of those super fancy, deluxe Japanese toilets.  Also, the sink in essentially a vase with bamboo and flowers in it.

I recommend coming right at 6pm, so you don't have to wait in line because their desserts take a while to make and people take their time to eat here. 

ENVIRONMENT: There's 2 Raku's in the plaza.  Be sure to find the one with the big spoon and red carpet.  The other one is just a restaurant. The staff is super friendly here and talented! 

FOOD: I recommend getting the dessert sets ($15) for the full experience! They start you off with a sorbet.  When I went, I got the pineapple sorbet. It was soooo light and fluffy.  Definitely tasted like a dole whip haha. As for the main dessert, I got ""Ichigo"" and ""Miyabi"".

ICHIGO: Within the white chocolate cup was pie crust and strawberry mousse.  Everything just goes well perfectly with each other.  There's also this strawberry that has strawberry sorbet inside. 

MIYABI: Green tea souffle with citrus cream topped with berries. There's this crispy green tea thing that went really well with the citrus cream.  On the bottom is a green tea souffle. I totally forgot that it was a souffle, so I was surprised to see green tea filling on the inside.  

STRAWBERRY & VANILLA GREEN TEA: Decided to order tea with our desserts. This was a lightly flavored green tea so the strawberry and vanilla taste weren't too strong but you can still smell it. I enjoyed this alot. Wish we got more but there was only enough to fill 2 1/2 cup. 

MACARONS: Because they messed up on our miyabi dessert, they gave us complementary macarons.  We got the green tea which had red bean filling on the inside and coffee with caramel on the inside.  They were some chewy, moist macarons.. so good!

Three courses of dessert?! Yup.  I had only imagined the concept in my fondest of thoughts.  My girl friend had been here before and was excited to bring me. I think I was really way more excited than she was. 

We came in and got lucky there was a spot for two at the bar open. The place itself, it's very clinical and contemporary with its stark white walls and decor. The ladies manning the fort were friendly and kept up with the diners' oohs and aahs. Oh and endless photo-taking. 

We each opted for the three or maybe four course dessert which came with dessert wine. Even the menu was edible. I surely loved that little touch! Each course was meticulously prepared and artfully presented. 

Now these aren't your fattening, carbloady desserts. Surprisingly each course was light, airy, but still satisfying that sweet tooth.  Each course was a curious surprise waiting to unravel.

Yes, there's Cheesecake Factory, the numerous boba cafes, donut shops, or bakeries, but this is strictly for the sweet tooth and the experience.

Their desserts are not super sweet and rich like a german chocolate cake, but more on the subtle, tropically inspired, and texturally flavorful side. Want to have a whimsical experience? Want to see a real candy (not candied) apple? Want to see how your dessert is constructed? Come here.

Tips:
* Sit at the counter if there are seats available. It's part of the experience to watch them create your dessert.

* Ask questions if you have any. The servers are happy to explain anything you don't know on the menu.

* Be respectful in their bathroom and don't break their Japanese bidet. Have a try if you've never seen one. Also part of the experience ;)

* Groups larger than 6 will be hard to accommodate. Please plan for being split up as they don't accept reservations.

The desserts are gorgeous and it's fun sitting at the counter watching them being made, and the wine pairings with the desserts are quite good, but somehow the desserts themselves are honestly a bit bland.

I've visited twice and tried:

Rikyu:  black sesame sponge cake with sesame paste and green tea cream.   The black sesame flavor was weak, the green tea cream had such a weak flavor of green tea, it was mostly cream.  Boring.  2/5

Mars:  yuzu mousse & chocolate cream with hazelnuts and assorted fruits, covered with white chocolate.   Barely any yuzu brightness.   3/5

Potiron:  sponge cake covered with pumpkin cream.   Better than the other two, but maybe my expectations were toned down.   Again, the pumpkin flavor was very light, it was mostly cream.  3.5/5

Seems to be a better spot for Instagramming desserts than eating dessert, sorry!   All my friends love this place so maybe it's me, but if you also prefer strongly flavored desserts, this is not for you either.",gipgMGX89Jp0jLqJ-y4rhg,0,0,3,uwhxJQrolvyiT6mo1hoHoA
2252119,2014-12-12,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Sweets Raku is the real deal.  I haven't had any of their savory stuff but their desserts are top notch and the service is about as attentive as you can get without being overly intrusive.

Came here with a local friend who said I should check it out.  We had the Dessert Prix Fixe and an A La Carte dessert (they charge a little more if you split a Prix Fixe) and he also had a Prix Fixe.  When you receive the actual menu, it comes rolled up in a ring (ours was a sort of pretzel ring).  They gave us a plate of some sort of apple sauce and then game the fun part.  You dip the menu into the sauce and eat it!  Yes this is possibly very gimmicky and yes it's still AWESOME!

Our Prix Fixe started with a pear sherbet dollop that was crisp and refreshing.  The actual main was the Stella which is some sort of fantastic strawberry confection.  It was plated beautifully and had just the right amount of sweetness as well as a little bit of gold flake.  For the third course it was our choice of cream puff and it was just the right size with, again, the right amount of sweetness and sauce.  

For the A La Carte dessert, I ordered the Carib which was a mixture of cinnamon, fruit, cream, sherbet, and custard in a wine glass.  They place a thin circle of white chocolate over the top and pour a sauce on top which melts away the chocolate, dripping onto the contents of the glass.  The flavors melded well and in my opinion it was the star of the show.

Afterward we inquired about some blue sparkling wine some other guests were having and our server poured us some complimentary glasses with a couple blueberries as garnish!

I would say I was definitely blown away by the experience and actually quite upset I have not found something like it back home in SF.

If you go, you will likely enjoy yourselves and experience tasty delights. And you should go. If $20-ish for a three course dessert meal doesn't make your wallet/purse cry, then you should definitely go and have an enjoyable time.

On the other hand. If you've experienced other high concept ""dessert bars"" like Chickalicious in New York (let's not kid anyone, Sweets is nearly a direct emulation of Chickalicious down to the amuse bouche and the white walls) then you might find yourself a bit underwhelmed at the end like me.

Fast forward to planning our Vegas trip and doing my yelp research. I came across this place and remembered seeing the videos and made it a point to make it here on our trip. 

I know that popular places like this can be hectic and that affects the service and experience. Due to this, I read a lot of the reviews and took notes of the little tips. We made sure to come right when it opened at 6 pm. I already knew what we were going to order. Alittle obsessive? Maybe. I like to think of it as good planning.

We sat at the bar. This was cool because we watched the pastry chefs at work.

We ordered the Ringo and Primavera. The Primavera had some entertainment factor as the fruit gel is poured over the white chocolate. 

The Ringo was warm had the effect of comfort food. This was a fancy comfort food. The Primavera was very refreshing. It was a bit chilly outside so the Ringo hit the spot. Every and I mean every ingredient tasted fresh. I watched the pastry chefs construct our desserts. They really took their time as each piece was added. The sweets are indeed works of art.

The girls next to us ordered the Mars. It had a great wow entertainment factor with the blow torch. I had read that it had a strong alcohol taste so I decided not to get that one.

Yesterday I brought my parents here that were in town while I was visiting my in-laws, my parents thought they could have shared a dessert instead of getting two desserts. Their policy is one main dessert or $12 minimum per person. My parents decided to opt out when they told them that you would have to pay $9 to share. My mom told me that my fiancé and I that I can order and they will wait for us to finish. 

After that I realized everything was taking unusually long for us to get our desserts after we got our sorbet. The lady who was preparing desserts was making Mother's Day desserts and I figured she would stop and start to make ours. She then proceeded to make croissants and threw them in the oven. She kept stalling and finding other things to do. Then one of the other employees needed help making the cake so as she started making my dessert she then stopped to go help her. Then she got back to my dessert. I've seen the other pastry chef multiple times so I know she knows what she is doing, she kept interrupting her while making my dessert and asking her questions so she would stop to help her.

Mind you there was only two other couples besides our party and the other couples were just waiting on their food and desserts. They can't even use being busy as an excuse, there were only four other people besides us.

When my fiancé got his dessert he got the Mars and it didn't even melt, totally intentional. She poured it and it barely melted. While the couple on the end that they talked to, joked with and payed full attention to had got one that melted completely.  My fiancé has gotten that dessert and it always melts a lot of the chocolate but we waited and it just stayed in tact and then a little hole opened, most of it staying in tact. They spent more time talking and joking in Japanese with the couple that I thought their next move would be to wipe the sweat off their forehead or feed it to them.

As I got my dessert finally after the head pastry chef finished finding everything else that she could find to stall making my dessert, I took one look and realized she rushed it and gave me barely any ice cream. I looked at the cookie on the bottom and it was burnt because she was more concerned talking to the couple she spent talking to the whole time we were there. The other couple got the same dessert and she made hers look grand and put a lot of ice cream. She took her time to make theirs nicely and rushed mine and barely gave me anything. As I'm eating they are giggling to each other and whispering, that's when I knew it was intentional. 

At the end of it we told our waitress that we were terribly disappointed with their service that it took forever to get our desserts and they barely paid attention to us as they catered to the other couple, we told them how the other couple got a beautiful dessert and they rushed making our dessert and barely gave us any. She apologized and she called them to the back, as they came back out the head pastry chef was laughing and not even sorry. 

Now they lost two loyal customers because they were probably bothered that my parents changed their mind on getting desserts and decided to wait for us to finish.",KHt4wF6kXQZTAZ485SIv6g,8,0,1,nwWkOaJYlnQryKw7p2Yt3g

Located in the same plaza as the Raku restaurant, away from the strip.

It's a small gastronomy-ish dessert shop next to a massage place. We came during Valentines day and there was a line to be seated...not surprised. Luckily we came at the right time, we only waited about 10 minutes and was seated at the counter per request. Because it was during Vday, the two desserts I wanted were out :( Luckily, I ordered this other pastry before that was all out. A bit bummed they didn't have the edible menu when we visited :(

You'll see the main dessert chef(?) in front of the counter running around preparing every order. This includes creating chocolate shells to tossing pastries into the oven. There's one or two servers taking orders and drinks.

There's no reservations nor a sign in sheet. The place is big enough to seat maybe one large party against the wall.

What I ordered:

Ringo:
Gorgeous candy apple filled with light cream and caramel. Freshly baked apple pie and honey ice cream. 

Jack in Cup:
Light chocolate cake in a cup filled with cinnamon cream. The bottom had some nuts and other cream inside which made this cake less boring.

Now, usually I would turn around and leave but after hearing about this place I just couldn't pass the chance. After about 20 minutes we were finally seated. We ordered the following:

Primavera $12

Spring Mountain $12

The primavera was a strawberry based dessert with strawberry sorbet, chopped fruit, gelatin, and white chocolate. It came in a wine glass and very beautifully presented.  They pour a warm strawberry sauce over a circle of white chocolate that acted like a lid to your glass in which the white chocolate melts and drops into your dessert. It was AMAZING! My visitor's dessert was made of puff pastry, fruit, and a pistachio cream. It was good but not as good as the primavera. I liked the fact the desserts were not too sweet and light tasting.

Sitting countertop high observing the show felt like sitting front row orchestra at a Broadway play!   I had the dessert 2 course meal starting with the light but strange earl grey tea creme brûlée, the crunchy sugar topping cracking with goodness.  Second course was their table side infused vanilla creme soufflé that was pillowy light but needed just a hint more of sweetness to elevate it a little.  The side of green sorbet had a strange grainy sand like texture but tasted better as it melted.

But not just any dessert, Japanese desserts. When I eat here it's almost as if I'm eating in Japan. Most of the staff is from Japan. The main pastry chef is also from Japan. 

Grab a seat at the counter so you can see your dessert being made. It's awesome to watch them put the different desserts together. 

There's a prix fixe three course dessert set which is presented on a rice paper menu with Raspberry dipping sauce. I've eaten it on 2 separate occasions. The first course is a sorbet. the most recent time I went it was pineapple sorbet. The pineapple sorbet was so good and refreshing and I don't even really like pineapple. The main course is a choice of about 4 different desserts. I've had the strawberry tiramisu and the ""Mt. Fuji"" which is a chestnut Mont blanc. The Mont blanc is delicious. Rich but light. The last course is a petit four that's a cream puff with your choice of fillings.

We chose tea to acompany our desert this time and it was perfect! 

Price is high considering it's desert. However, the price account for the quality of work and ingredients they put into the their cakes and pastries. And it is competitive if you compare it with bakery at the strip.

Our song would be Def Leppard's 'Pour Some Sugar On Me' and it would be the sweetest, tastiest, most self indulgent love affair of all time. 

For those of you that have not yet met my secret lover (aka Sweets as I like to call him) behold a delectable gem hidden in a strip mall that is ironically off of the Strip. There are no strippers here but the tantalizing beauty of these desserts might just drive you mad to the point of stripping all your clothes off. Cover your eyes kids, this could get ugly. If you're like me and once dreamed of transporting yourself into another dimension so you can visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, then your first step towards that happy day has finally arrived! You don't get a golden ticket but you do get an edible menu that you can eat with strawberry syrup. Uhhhh whuuuuuut?! Sweets Raku rules!

First off, don't come to Sweets Raku on a totally full stomach because you'll definitely want to order the three course pre-fixe. Only weaklings order just one dessert! Two of my friends who came with us were weaklings and afterwards we de-friended them from Facebook and fed them to the wolves. My other friends who made the brave choice of ordering the pre-fixe however were rewarded with a crown of diamonds and three bags full of gold. I mean, come on people, it's just dessert! Do some air squats and suck it up!

For our first course I got an amazing orange sorbet and watched as the pretty Japanese pastry chef lovingly made each dish right in front of our eyes! Momentarily I turned into a piglet and went weee weee weee all the way to heaven! Just look at the photos, they were all beautiful works of art! I felt like I just ate a Picasso except I think Sweets Raku tastes much better than an old painting.

Word to the wise, be careful or Sweets Raku will spin its way around your heart and you'll be caught in its web of sugar spun ecstasy. Step off though 'yo, because I was here first!",fgwI3rYHOv1ipfVfCSx7pg,15,14,5,zbTp7bFQMQstGSkwkjxbFg

First of all, I think she does not understand what I am saying.

2464591,2016-07-07,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Coming in here for the first time after looking for a nice desert place, I found Sweet Raku. It's a bit away from the strip, close to the china town district. I honestly didn't know what to expect but once my wife and I got in, she turned back to me and asked, ""Did we need reservations?"" This restaurant is set up much like kitchen with a bar top with some seating on the side. Overall the place probably can hold up to 24ish people. What's nice is that everything is very clean, and after being seated with a menu, we found that the menu is actually pretty simple. You either choose the lunch sets, Desert set($15 is what It costed me), or a main desert. A couple of things to note is that each person must order at least one Main category desert(I mean, why would you come here without trying a main desert anyhow??), and because the chef's make the food from scratch in front of you, it can easily take up to an hour and a half, if not longer before you're all done. 

With all of that said, I tried the Desert Set that included a Mango sorbet with mint jelly(Really good!), and for the main desert course I choose the Puffy Cup, which is a raspberry and blueberry souffle with a vanilla cream interior, and Mango compote on the side. Having already been so impressed by watching the chef make everything, I was equally impressed by how it tasted. It was Creamy, slightly tart, and semi sweet. Who knew a raspberry/blueberry souffle would pair so well with a Mango compote? The warmth of the souffle paired really well with the chilled compote. 

Overall the service here was excellent, the chef's presentation was awesome, and the food was great! I couldn't recommend this place more.

2468776,2015-10-16,2,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I absolutely love this place! It is without a doubt a one of a kind dessert experience and I highly recommend for everyone to try it out. Although it can get a little pricey, I definitely think that each penny spent is well worth it and here's why:

SERVICE:
The servers and pastry chefs were all wonderful and had great customer service skills. They explained each dessert item very well and were also very good at conversing with us. Through their explanation, you can really get a sense of what the dessert was. They were also very good at making recommendations. All of them were great and really added to the whole experience!

THE DESSERT:
The dessert was amazing! Not only did they look great being made right in front of you, they tasted even better! I do recommend getting a seat at the bar as it heightens your experience by seeing how they made each dessert. During my first ever visit, I ended up trying their Carib, which was by far the highlight of my whole dessert dining experience. It was delicious, to say the least--the right amount of sweetness, great textures, and mixing of flavors you didn't think would taste good together. Definitely a must try! I also got the chef's special that night, which was a coconut strawberry sorbet. That too was really delicious! As far as my friends, they ended up ordering the Sunset and the blueberry champagne sorbet. For me personally, the Sunset was a little too tart/sour and was lacking in sweetness. The blueberry champagne sorbet as well had an overpowering taste of champagne in it. Granted they were good, they were not to my full liking. I did greatly enjoy the desserts that I ended up ordering.

OTHER OPTIONS:
Aside from desserts, this place also offers a savory menu. I think this is very smart of them to have this option as although they are predominantly a dessert place, they can cater to those that want something savory to eat first, followed by an indulgence in something sweet. To pair up with the savory dishes, this place also offers a variety of red and white wines. All compliment their savory dishes very well. If wine is not your thing, Sweets Raku also offers varying flavors of tea. The strawberry vanilla tea was really good as well and I highly recommend it.

LOGISTICS:
This place is located in a plaza with other varying Asian restaurants and dessert places. The parking can get a bit packed since there are so many options to go to in this plaza. Also, make sure not to confused this place with their presumed sister restaurant offering Japanese cuisinei that is also called Raku. Like stated before, it is recommended to sit in the bar area to see how the desserts are made!

Overall, one of the best dessert experiences that I have ever had. Sweets Raku is one of a kind. I have yet to experience nor taste anything as delicious and as original as this place!",8nWC0YJ7EGR6uuizFQqQkQ,2,4,5,XYtfMIzM2DuCoO2X6HiU6Q

This place is more to do with the over all experience. You sit on the bar and you can see how they carefully craft all the desserts. It's fun to see them pouring hot liquid on your dessert and the thin chocolate melting away. It's not everyday you get to eat such fancy looking desserts.

Tasted like liver which I'm not a fan of in the first place.  But my friend who ordered it liked it.  I did like the fact that it came with caramelized brûlée topping.  The hint of sweetness to the savory treat was pleasant.  

Second item - Cream Puff 
Tasted like a cream puff.  Nothing too special. 

Third item - Sakura
This was a cream cheese soufflé with strawberries and cherry blossom cream.  Moscato sorbet on the side.  The soufflé was very meringue like and less cakey than a typical soufflé.  Person preference, I like the typical kind better.  It did go well with the cream.  The sorbet pairs well with the soufflé, but I would rather have something non alcoholic.  

Ringo - 
This was an apple pie with honey ice cream and a cute apple shaped item filled with whipped cream and caramel.  I liked it that the whipped cream was not sweet and went well with the dish.  The honey ice cream was delicious.  

The bathroom had an interesting sink that looked like a log with plants inside.  The toilet seat was warm.  However the bathroom floor was wet.",4gAZMOUpbENF-Iu_hl2PoA,0,0,3,vgbZYJ-d9MYDFBchKNTRkQ

2496967,2013-12-10,6,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Dessert Art at its best!...Think Mondrian not Pollock here though.

Yet another dessert review from the guy that loves savory items...I first came here when my sister had a molten lava cake urge that needed to be satisfied and I refused to go to Chili's.  We were fortunate enough to run into Cathy C. (maybe you recognize her form her S.R. ROTD fame--the duchess herself).  Cathy offered some suggestions and we were on our way to a blissful experience.

Sweets Raku is as much about the experience as it is the dessert.  The food is presented masterfully with an eye for composition.  Most of the seating is at the bar--allowing not only for a pure, open feel, but also for a wonderful look into the art of plate presentation...a Vegas show worth checking out!   The ambiance is angelic.  I was waiting to hear Morgan Freeman or James Earl Jones' voice welcome me through the back door of heaven...instead the door at the back leads to one of the cooler bathrooms in Vegas...and yes, this is still part of the experience, so be sure to check out the bathroom while you're here.

The desserts are well above average, but play on the clean/delicate side as opposed to the ooey gooey/decadent side of tasty treats.  While quite nice, the short of it is that I would not give out 5 stars on the desserts alone.  When paired with the preceding paragraph, I am all-in!

Sweets Raku also has one of the better selections of dessert wines...dessert wines are not my cup of tea...err...glass of vino, but I did enjoy the dessert wine pairings...they're worth a shot to those moderately open to the idea.  They also have a few nice Reds and Whites...so you're safe if you despise dessert wines...in fact they offer a couple pinot noirs that are mellow enough to pair with many of the the deserts.   Speaking of pinoits, they offer a few savory items including a cheese plate that is asking to be paired with a glass of pinot or balanced red wine.

Stay away if you are afraid for paying a little more $$$ for a little less in dessert quantity, but put Sweets Raku at the top of dessert list if you are looking for great experience and a break from the norm.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,11,10,5,KTgLJvuzU7njmEGlaPcyhw

The Carib was the best dessert we had out of the three that my family shared. The second best was the Mt Fuji, the Sweet Raku version of a Mont Blanc. The Mont Blanc could have used a bit of a palate refresher as it was a one-note flavor profile, but it was well crafted. 

The Jack in the Cup was a disappointment, though - the soufflé was too eggy and the banana pudding was a bit bitter for some reason. 

I could have used a bit more iced tea than I got, too. 

TL;DR: overall a bit overrated but there are some great Flavors to be had with the Carib. Jack in the Cup isn't worth the wait.",fMTT_T57XXk0GbT_frG7ug,1,0,4,eZd8VsEkx642Y8gf-cbhTw

Venue: sleek, clean white/grey color scheme to match the white marble/stone countertop.  There are around 10 seats at the counter and 6-8 table seats.  If you are at the counter, you are able to watch the chefs create the desserts right in front of you.  They also display their extensive wine collection at the front (if you are interested in their wine tasting).  Seats fill up quickly so probably will be best to come at an off-peak hour.

Service: everyone is very professional but sometimes service was on the slow side; we had a bit of trouble flagging someone down for water or the bill and it took 15 min for us to receive a pot of tea (idk if it takes that long to heat water up and brew tea that long).  Desserts understandably took a bit of time to make, but maybe because I couldn't see if there was something going on in the kitchen, I felt some things could have been a bit quicker.  The chefs at the counter were also a bit too serious and didn't smile at all, even when people are watching them, to the point that you wouldn't want to talk to them.  

Food: everything is beautifully presented, but luckily we ordered desserts that also tasted great!  The two dishes were pretty light in own opinion, so we were pleasantly full without still being hungry or too stuffed.  They also offer a ""tasting menu"", but I was pretty satisfied with just one dessert (my date had another and so we tried each others).  We ordered them with a pot of jasmin tea ($4.50), which was not too strong, but had a great floral flavor to it.

-- ICHIGO (white chocolate cup filled with pie crust and strawberry mousse served with strawberry candy filled with strawberry sorbet and condensed milk mousse)($12) - was worried the combo would be too sweet but thankfully it wasn't!  The strawberry mousse was light and fluffy and worked well with the sweeter white chocolate cup and crunchy pie crust at the bottom.  Takes a bit to get the perfect bite, but it works when you do.  Love how they included the tart, strawberry sorbet to act as a palatte cleanser with a decent hit of acidity.  

-- MT. FUJI (chestnut cream with fluffy sponge cake)($12) - my bf was disappointed that they didn't have the Rikyu dessert (similar except green tea) but he actually enjoyed this!  The dessert isn't very sweet overall (as we like it), especially with the earthy chestnut cream to counteract the light, slightly sweeter sponge cake underneath.  Also didn't get the feeling that there was too much of the cream either / wasn't smacking our mouths from the amount of cream in each bite as expected.  The tuile was also a nice touch to add crunchiness to the soft cream and cake.  

Overall, my date and I were satisfied with this place!  We both are fans of lighter, less sweet desserts (akin to the Japanese style they use here) and so we enjoyed the dishes for their taste as well as presentation.  Service is the only thing that I hope they can improve on and the reason why I don't give this a perfect rating.  

So peeps who are Insta-fans or like Japanese-light desserts, you should probably try this at least once.",-oksEyZRFqwe708oV0CBQg,0,0,4,ewNkCF-figRfIqatKGGHTQ

WHERE: On Spring Mountain and Decatur, in the same plaza as Raku and Monta Ramen.

WHEN: They are open on Monday through Saturday from 3pm-midnight.

WHAT: What to do when your friend and yourself are craving something sweet at 10pm? YOU TAKE THAT CRAVING IN YOUR CAR, AND HEAD TO SWEETS RAKU!

My friend and I GPS'ed Sweets Raku with excitement on a cold night. As we parked, we were looking for restaurant sign, but couldn't seem to find it. We ended up walking to their sister restaurant, Raku, and the lovely lady came outside of the restaurant to point to where we should have been. Fyi, if you are first timers, look for the red carpet and or huge spoon right beside the DOOR TO HEAVEN!

When we walked down the red carpet, and through the doors, it definitely felt like HEAVEN ON EARTH. We were greeted and sat at a table, our server came up to us asking if the seats we had were okay because they actually recommend you sitting up at the bar as first-timers. So we ended up moving over to the bar so that we could observe the dessert chefs making our desserts.

The menus were brought to us... COOLEST THING EVER... The menus are edible! (For all of you Asians who remember the White Rabbit candies where they had a second edible wrapper, it is similar to that!) The server saw me chewing on my menu, and offered raspberry syrup do dip it in. ;) EVEN BETTER!

Prior to devouring the menu, I made the choice in ordering the Prix Fixed desserts, where there are 3 desserts for $19.

The first is a Mango Sorbet with Green Tea jelly, the second you may choose from the desserts in the A la cart- there are normally about 4-5 desserts you are able to choose from, and then lastly, the Petits Fours, which is a Molten Chocolate cake with marshmallows and raisins drenched in goodness.

For the dessert of my choice, I had their Angel Cream. It was absolutely amazing, and shaped into a Yummy angel. NOTE: I LOVE HOW ALL OF THEIR DESSERTS ARE NOT CRAZILY SWEET. They are all filled with LOVE, and not too much sugar! (Diet friendly). My friend also chose the Prix fixed dessert, and chose the Chestnut cake. It was also a light dessert, amazingly PERFECT!

OTHER THINGS I LOVE: The ambiance is just so soothing. The decor is a very modern chic, with white on white furniture! Simple, yet Beautiful! I love the utensils and their setup! I love the wonderful and cheerful chefs and servers. I just love this place and will be back every single month! I want to go back just writing about it! Sigh... Lol.

We got here just before 9PM after dinner to see about 9 people in line. Like many reviews have stated, this place is small. It was a bit hard to find because there are two Raku's in the plaza, and Sweets Raku just has a simple Raku sign outside next to a large metal spoon. It's the one near the outside of the parking lot. The place was tiny but the employees were super nice. They handed us menus to look over in line. To my disappointment, they told us that the special seasonal dessert ""Ichigo"" was currently sold out but were working on making more. I could see that they were slowly working on the handmade strawberry candy in the back. Wow the workmanship looked amazing!
We waited about 45 minutes in line before getting seated for our party of four. When we got seated, they informed us a limited supply of Ichigo was ready. All the main desserts are $12, but for $15 you get a main dessert + the daily sorbet. There were two daily sorbets that day: tiramisu and mango. I ordered the Ichigo with the tiramisu sorbet, my dad the Mars with mango sorbet, mom the Angel Cream and my cousin the Mt. Charleston.

We waited about another 25-30 minutes for the desserts to be made while waitresses frequently refilled our water and were super friendly. When we finally got them, we were shocked by the work and detail put into each dessert! The sorbets were light and had tons of flavor. My favorite dessert of the night had to be the Ichigo, the strawberry candy was super pretty and everything on the plate was delicious. All of the desserts were delicious and well-balanced, so if your choice is sold out, you can't go wrong. The Mars had a really strong alcohol taste so beware! The Mt. Charleston was balanced between the rich chocolate and light lavender mousse. The Angel Cream was probably the simplest: pretty much like a cream cake but had beautiful presentation and was still yummy.

The waitresses are patient and know how to accommodate the crowd. The wait (the line and for actual dessert) is long so be prepared. When I visited on a Saturday night, it seemed that it was most crowded right after dinner time (7ish) and around 10pm. Be patient, enjoy the experience, understand that these desserts take time and care, and you won't be disappointed!",hDLdCWSEGddIUDntpKtqVg,7,6,5,EtGNYNxAofZP_2IKUZ8gCg

There was a short wait, but its because its not that large a space, and every seat in the house was filled. 

The way it works is that there's a $19 Prix fixe dessert menu that comes with a sorbet, a cream puff, and a main course dessert. Or you can get the main course dessert for $12, which is what we all did.

The desserts were wonderful. Very pretty and appealing to the eyes. They were also delicious. I particularly liked how the desserts weren't overly sweet.

The staff working that night were also very nice and courteous, from seating us to explaining the menu to us. A cherry on top for this wonderful visit.

We have been big fans of Sweets Raku and recommended it to many friends. To say we were underwhelmed this evening at Sweets Raku, for the first time ever when visiting this previously wonderful place, is an understatement.

Look at the Yelp review comments: #1 under comments is the wonderful chestnut cake. In their wonderful wisdom, Sweets Raku no longer offers their most widely acclaimeddesert. That was a major disappointment.

OK, we worked past the nonexistence of the Mt. Fuji offering, and then decided on a selection of other offerings, party to identify potential a ""new favorite"" to replace the no longer available and #1 listed crowd-pleasing Mt Juji.  However, in addition to eliminating their most widely acclaimed desert, they've also instituted a ""minimum order"" amount.  Huh??  I just didn't find enjoyment in being forced to order something I don't want, just to satisfy their stupid and arbitrary ""minimum purchase' rule.  Hardly what I'd call acceptable at any dining spot. 

At this point, I was inclined to just leave, however, my good friend insisted we get something tasty and we ordered some cookies to go.  They, along with all products at Sweets Raku were very tasty but I must admit, based on the first two disappointments this evening I doubt I'll return to Sweets Raku.    

Sweets Raku is a classic example of inept management screwing up a good thing.  Let me know when the new inept management is gone, Mt. Fuji is back on the menu and I'll then know it's safe to return.

2724976,2017-07-23,2,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Sweets Raku is a beautifully decorated dessert and wine spot located in the same complex which also hosts other popular restaurants such as Kabuto, Raku, Big Wong, Monta Ramen, and Hwaro.  They make beautifully crafted desserts but also offer excellent savory options.  After a delicious dinner at any of those places, do yourself a favor and make your way here for dessert.

On a Thursday, the wait was about twenty minutes.  Prepare to wait longer on the weekends if you aren't coming there right when it opens.   

The menu is fairly simple.   You can order sweet or savory dishes a la carte or you can opt for their $15 two-course dessert option.

I had a watermelon small dessert followed by the Mars (Yuzu mousse, chocolate cream with hazelnuts and fruit covered by white chocolate).  The entire dessert flambee'd brandy.   Fairly good.

My wife had a raspberry starter followed by her choice, Ichigo.   This was a beautiful take on strawberries, reminiscent of a strawberry shortcake.   Pie pieces, strawberry cream, strawberry sorbet, condensed milk all encapsulated by a thin layer of white chocolate.  This was the best of the desserts.

Of course, when foie gras is on the menu, it's getting ordered.  The foie gras here was ABSOLUTE PERFECTION.  Four pieces of creamy, house-made foie gras with balsamic,  served with pecan, honey comb, fruit puree and pie sticks.   I fell instantly in love with this dish after the first bite.   I almost convinced my wife to go back here just for this the next day.  Almost.  Darn.

We rounded out the little meal with prosciutto and cheese as well as a 3-flight wine tasting.   I had no complaints with anything.

I definitely would not go back just because it's so $$$ and kids just don't appreciate dessert either.....they just eat anything sweet! I might as well take them to buy a pint of Ben and Jerry's and they'd think that was the best Vegas could offer.

I was not super impressed about their cakey desserts, but the two dishes I mentioned above were astonishing. the pastry chef sorta 'finish up' your dessert in front of you, or make it in front of you depends on the type of the dessert, and that's so amuzing to watch.

2737666,2018-01-29,7,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"If you like desserts and a experience, then this is one of those places that you have to put on your bucket list.  It is a little on the pricey side but when you factor that they are making it in front of you and there will be a wow factor is most of their desserts.  (Just trust me, keep your eyes on them while they make it to the time you eat it and you will know what I mean).

Like most good things in life you will need patience:

Patience in parking as this place is in a small strip mall that is filled with a bunch of other good places to eat. Trust me, it is a foodies dream come true. With that said, parking can be a pain at times.   If you are impatient there is street parking as well.

Patience in waiting in line.  Sometimes you will see a line to sit down.  I believe there is no reservation so it is first come, first served.  We try to come later in the evening to avoid the lines.

Patience to eat.  While the prep-cooks make certain things for future orders, most of it is made right there in front of you.  So you will need patience but watching how they make it right in front of you is pretty cool.  (note: try and sit up at the counter so you are able to watch)  If you don't care, then just grab one of the tables.  

Desserts:  One thing I like when I come here is one that is called Ringo.  It's like a apple pie on steroids.  It is like a masterpiece on a plate.  Almost looks too nice to eat, but trust me I ate every last bite on the plate.  You have of course a small crisp apple pie, honey ice cream with a cool shiny apple.   We took a video of cracking it open and watching the whipped cream and caramel sauce ooze out slowly.   

Then there is Mars.  This is another wow moment;  It's a white chocolate dome that they drizzle a flambeed Hennessy over it and you watch as the outside layer melts away exposing a yuzu mousse, chocolate cream with a hazelnut crunch.  It looked amazing but the taste was so-so.  Not my favorite but it was a fav on all social media platforms (IG, FB, and Snap) as my friends made comments of wow and amazing.  

Just a FYI I heard there is a minimum of $12 per person but the desserts are $12 or you can do the 2 course option which comes with a extra dessert of either a raspberry sorbet or a small Creme brulee and one of the desserts on the menu.  Also, this is Japanese style desserts so it's not too sweet so don't be expecting a sugar rush biting into them.",ETt5294q4Xm1ZB8EX28Ejw,7,10,5,ilgQBBLcFzCJg9dN0mCsbg

then i got the fromage pear, which was a creamy cheesy, sweet, but not too sweet cloud of fluffy rich deliciousness in my mouth. i highly recommend this if you're lucky enough to have it as a choice. my friend got her usual, a raspberry lava cake. i usually don't like such things because they're always so sweet, but this one wasn't and it was perfect.

at the end we got a cream puff and it was whatever. i really liked the fig sorbet we got as a palate cleanser. and we also got the wine flight, which came in these little test tubes on ice. it was fun to try but we didn't like any of the wines and it was also just kind of weird and hard not to shoot the whole thing because it was so tiny.

anyway the part that makes it feel so cool is that you get to watch the people make the desserts. they are beautiful and it's so cool to see them be so graceful about a highly technical process. that's why it's worth waiting for a seat at the bar. the service is really good. everyone is polite and attentive.

Note that this review is centered around the service and not the food since we never got to sit down. We arrived about an hour and a half after they opened. We were the second group in line and the place didn't appear to be busy and had plenty of seats open. There wasn't a hostess or anyone to greet anyone in line, but there was a sign on the wall that said to wait to be seated.

We waited about 30 minutes and still none of the staff had come to talk to anyone in line. The entire time, we only saw one employee but she was working behind the counter. By then, the line was almost out the door. Eventually the party of 8 in front of us just decided to sit down in the empty chairs since no one had come to seat them during that time.

The service here didn't seem to be all that great. I don't know if they were extremely short staffed, but you would think an employee would at least try to greet the customers in line and acknowledge them instead of ignoring them.

Charging $12 a dessert and skimping on the ingredients is totally unacceptable to me.  Instead of giving you three full pieces of raspberries, they cut it in half so you get three half pieces of raspberries.  Really? 

The foie gras, instead of full pieces as shown in the menu and how it was served before as you can see from other Yelper pics, they also give you half pieces.  I should've known by then and take caution with this place but I didn't learn my lesson until this time.

This time I ordered the caviar ($30 for 10g).  It came tin unsealed, caviar was loosely packed with a thin layer that seems like they have took out some instead of it densely packed like how a tin or jar of caviar should be packed.  You can even compare my pic with other Yelper pic how it was much fuller in the past than mine.

Quality totally gone down as I saw the baker put together the dessert quite sloppily and fed no passion.  Huge contrast from the first couple times I went.  The wait time for the caviar was long perhaps they need to bake the puff pastries.  

It's the little thing that some customers pay attention to that the eateries often think the customers pay no notice to.  Unfortunately I am one of those customers who pays attention on details.",P561nJlF8nDFzyHgrWkARA,1,0,1,VsSbn3tyIZRjgVuPHy2Hog

First of all, finding their place is kind of a dilemma. There is no sign whatsoever that indicates ""Sweets Raku"". After sticking my head in the door and asking if this was Sweet Raku, was only then that I was at the right place. Heck, I even took a pic of the giant shiny aluminum spoon to the right of the entrance door so I can remember where they are. What really stands out are the many bottles of different water with ph levels I assume? I forgot to ask them about it but you cant miss it. The place is small, I would say good for about 20 people? 

Now for the menu. You get it rolled secured with a bracelet type ring. Your server comes around, pulls the menu out, unrolls it, pours some type of raspberry sauce on your plate, and says you can eat the menu and the holder with dipping it in the sauce as an option. 

At the time of this review, it was a pre set price of 19 dollars for a set appetizer, choice of a main course, and then another set dessert. Our server said you couldn't share unless you added another main course for 12 dollars more. Can we say, ripoff?

So we went with the Apollo and the Marriage. I would have loved to describe all what we had but I am kind of shocked at the amount of money we had to pay just to have dessert. It was decent but nothing to be excited about.

The total of our bill came up to 33 dollars and some change. All for just dessert? Our original plan was just to share the already ridiculous price of 19 but was forced to order another main entrée for another 12 bucks? Sure the décor and the bathroom was nice but overpriced dessert was definitely not our thing. I don't think we'll be coming back any time soon.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,18,6,2,h7DiGy5G3OH823uuffLjbA

We waited in line for 30mns but the joy to see them prepare your dessert was worth it 
you MUST sit at the bar to enjoy watching them prepare your dessert. 
the atelier is very clean, beautifully set up and their outfit so cute!
we ordered the $15 2 courses dessert.
Do not expect to get your order at the same time unless you order the same dessert... 
if you don't like ice cream or sherbet, just go straight for your dessert.
Course 1 consist of a raspberry sherbet or a green tea ice cream.
I had a glace of white sangria (not sweet enough for me), my husband for a jasmine tea. i should pick the jasmine tea as well! i loved it :)
course 2, i picked the Ichigo and he picked the Pearl
we Loved the Pearl! chocolate mousse and the little white chocolate shell with the coulis of passion fruit were to DIE FOR. 
i was little disappointed about my Ichigo. the red berries were little sour so it killed it. i didn't like the red fruits mousse
watching them prepare the dessert was just delightful!
the only thing i would say... the staff wasn't too friendly, barely smiled but i still enjoyed our dessert date night!

This place will always be a four star to me because unlike your fancy smancy strip dessert, the actual chef works here and is right in front of you preparing artistry.

2832974,2016-06-07,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"If I'm at a Vegas buffet, one of the things I do is save room for a final plate that consists of nothing but desserts. It's generally my favorite part of the buffet. Well, now I might just bypass the buffet, and eat somewhere else and hit up Raku for dessert when I'm in Vegas.

A friend of mine posted a video they had online of the bonkers dessert presentations that they have here, and I was about to head to Vegas, so I figured I'd give it a shot. We came in around lunch time, because nobody in the group was actually hungry yet, but figured since it was just dessert, we could go roam afterwards if we weren't full.

Right around the crack of noon we show up. From the outside, it seems like you're in the wrong place. Especially since there's another building in the area with the name Raku. It's got a big plate glass door and rows of wine bottles, so it seems like more of a restaurant, but it's the right spot. It's located in between a massage parlor, and the excellent Kabuto sushi restaurant.

Just about 10 minutes after we get seated, the place fills up. And there's not a lot of room inside. Pretty quickly, there's a line has formed and it's almost out the door, so if you're dying to check this place out...either come solo or in a group of 2, or come early.

I ordered the sandwich and dessert set. This consists of one of their sandwiches of your choice, whatever seasonal sorbet they want to serve that day, and a dessert of your choice. The sandwich also comes with a cup of soup and a salad.

The soup was some kind of tomato seafood bisque, and it was very rich and flavorful. The sandwich seemed like it might be a bit odd, but the salt and richness of the roe works great in the croissant with the salmon.I would have been happy with a meal just consisting of that.

Then came the dessert. I ordered the Mars, but after hearing a bunch of people talking about how the Ringo was the thing to get, I switched my order over. One of my friends go their panna cotta (Primavera?), and the other got their version of a Mont Blanc (Spring Mountain). Everyone loved their desserts, and even though, I think the Mars has a more grandiose presentation, I'm certainly not going to complain about the Ringo. It all tasted great. My friends loved their desserts as well, though they were disappointed with the Iberico bacon sandwich.

Sadly, they don't do much in the way of take out, so if you want to hook up a friend who wasn't able to join you, all you can do is bring back some cookies. While they are damn fine cookies, they're just not quite as great as a full dessert would be. Though, I can't really blame them for not wanting to let people take delicate dessert home into the Vegas desert.

This will definitely be on my list of places to hit up if I'm in town. They were even offering all-you-can-drink sangria while we were there for $12, and that was tough to turn down.",eiSIwHugjw9GlbqCgbER8A,0,0,5,3UUehZkib6k-k-94CJYZaw

Sitting at the bar is awesome because you can watch them create their amazing desserts. There are these little hooks under the bar where you can hang your bag/purse. How thoughtful!
The menu: They have a wide array of seasonal items, and also cheese plates, as well as dessert wines. Ask them for recommendations on pairings. We ordered a bunch of stuff that I can remember the names because they're funky, so check out the pics I posted! We were a group of 6, so we pretty much ordered one of each of their featured dishes.
The finale: EVERYTHING.WAS.AWESOME. what more can I say? From watching them carefully prepare each dish to finally eating it!
Good notes: My son has a nut allergy, so I am always anxious getting him desserts simply because of the high risk of cross contamination. I told our server about his needs and ordered the raspberry sherbert. She was conscientious and very good. 
The service: IMPECCABLE 
The bathroom: Forreal, I felt like I was in a modern art museum. And they have a bidet! With an automatic toilet! And it was clean!
This is definitely a MUST for anyone in Vegas. It is in the Chinatown district, in a Plaza that has a lot of Japanese spots. They also have a non desert spot on the other side of the plaza, with a huge line outside all the time. My friend told me you can get a pork belly bowl for $4. Will definitely check that spot out too!

I came here with my friends after having oyster bar, we weren't planning on all getting a dessert but they have a minimum order here of $12 per person, so we each had to get one. I would have given them 5 stars if not for this rule. 

They don't have the edible menus anymore, now they have laminated menus.  They changed the menu pretty often, we ended up getting 4 desserts even though we only wanted 3. We had the apple pie with caramel apple, a cantaloupe / honeydew sorbet , an alcoholic based dish, and a chestnut cake. 

These are the most basic descriptions of the desserts because I forget what their names were.  My favorite was the cantaloupe / honeydew sorbet dish.  It was light and not that sweet and the sorbet was soo fruity and fresh.  The rest of the desserts could have been slightly sweeter.  They used the minimum amount of sugar which is how most Japanese desserts are, but I prefer my desserts to be alot sweeter. 

The presentation of the desserts is what makes this place so popular , the interior of the restaurant is beautiful, stark white and clean, but has warm accents especially with the oven right in the middle. The restroom is a stark contrast with the red and black interior.

This gem is in one of the busiest plazas in Chinatown. Parking is getting harder and harder here with the quality of businesses in the area, so you may have to resort to nearby street parking. If you can, sit at the bar, so you can watch the master dessert makers at work. It's very mesmerizing to see people who are so good at their craft up close, with so much skill and refinement to what they do. You can choose from a la carte desserts or a dessert set, but there is an order minimum per person. Everything is so light and perfectly thought out, but be warned the alcohol-based desserts have a bit of a kick to them, so I would not order for kids (even my 15-year-old brother felt guilty with his moscato-based dessert lol I told him he didn't have to tell my mom he ordered it). 

This place is also immaculately clean at all times. You can see that they've put a lot of care in to the set up of the restaurant and re-used a lot of non-conventional items, e.g. silicone lego mats as coasters, the tiling in the restaurant as utensil holders. They don't do the edible menus anymore, which I really miss, but I think the whole staff does a great job at making your time here special.

As if in contrast to the more dark & savory Raku motif is perfect with a finish in the sweetly minimalistic white interior of Raku sweets.  They do serve as a compliment to each other in all things excellence, delicacy and deliciousness.  

Sweets' ambiance is a clean postmodern sterile envelope perfectly suited to accompanying the visually stunning dishes from the menu.  Handcrafted desserts created only by a sophisticated level of skill.  The entire menu is an experience in itself, like literally; the menu is written on an edible (rice?) paper and you may devour it with a warm tangy & sweet apricot sauce.

On to the tastes.  From the lunch prefixes we had a bevy of adequately sized portions including thimble cups of soups and a Japanese salad.  I had the lobster bisque-esque (lol, sorry) soup which was creamy & layered.  Just just the right touch of salt and a hint of lobster.  The salad was the kind you get at a Japanese restaurant with a dollop of some white potato salad type something.  

I ordered the grilled salmon and ikura croissant sandwich.  Soft flaked croissant split and filled with salmon and micro greens with salmon roe on top laced with a creamy aioli.  Warm & toasty with little ocean salt pops of roe.  This reminds me of a Frenchier lox & bagels.  A great first act before the grand finale.

Finish with a 2 course dessert.  First up a palate cleansing sorbet.  I think it was strawberry with mint jelly.  Then came the main event.  I had the Carib she got the tasse or lasse.  I cant begin to describe mine other than a microcosm of sweet custards and creams contained in a wine glass as a volcanic fruit lava pours down onto an ornate chocolate disc.  Mixing and melting over a civilization of Mmmm.  Hers was like an ala' mode sent down from heaven and guided by angel wings made of cotton candy.  But dat sugar sculpture doh!

Fortunately, the menus at Sweets Raku are actually edible. That's right, you can EAT your menu. Although it's not that tasty, it still makes for a nice photo op!

Onto other things...

My boyfriend and I shared the prixe fixe menu. We ordered Mt. Fuji for the main dessert. The first course was some sort of green tea custard, which had a nice light flavor. It was a very small portion, but just right. Second course was the main dessert, Mt. Fuji (chestnut cream cake). It was awesome to watch them make this one. The texture was so soft, hence the ""cream cake"" description. It almost tasted like a tiramisu, but better. It came with a few chips stabbed into it, which was nice for dipping into the outer layer and eating. The third course was a mini lava cake dessert with homemade marshmallows and alcohol infused raisins on the side. It was soo rich and soo good. The perfect ending. 

Pros: 
-the place is spotless
-service is great. They are very attentive and even open the door for you on your way out 
-dinner and a show: you get to watch your dessert being made right before your eyes! Of course, most of it is already premade, but you get to see it being put together in a very artistic fashion. 
-the bathroom is incredible!! It's something you have to see for yourself
-you can share the prixe fixe menu at an extra cost, which I highly suggest (I don't think I could've finished everything on my own)
-I don't know what kind of milk they use, but its sweet and delicious! 

Cons:
-the bathroom door doesn't close all the way unless you give it an extra pull. Someone actually walked in on me. Luckily I was already done with my business!
-the waitress took my coat, but forgot to give it to me on my way out. I almost forgot about it completely

All in all, I think this is a great place for dessert, especially if you're trying to go somewhere different with a great ambiance.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,2,1,4,1l8S7eNZU0kv6NPTS1QZ9g

2989183,2017-06-27,5,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Visited Sweets Raku at the tail end of our Las Vegas trip this Spring. We didn't venture outside the general strip/ major tourist areas too much, but decided we had to check this off our bucket list before we left based on the great reviews. 

- Seating: Luckily, we arrived fairly early near the opening hours so our party of four was seated upon arriving. Shortly after, more people began arriving and there was quickly a line that formed for seating. We sat at the bar/ counter, so we could see the desserts as they were being made. 

- Desserts: We decided to go for all of the main desserts after trying their three most popular desserts. Each desert came out to $12 on its own. 

The first we tried was the Ichigo (Balloon Shaped Thin White Chocolate Cup filled with Pie Crust and Strawberry Mousse, served with Strawberry Candy filled with Strawberry Sorbet and Condensed Milk Mousse). This was by far my favorite, from the creation, presentation and taste. It was certainly 'gram worthy and felt like a party exploded in your mouth each time you took a bite! If you had to choose just one dessert from Sweets Raku, get this! 

Next we got the Mars (Yuku Mousse and Chocolate Cream with Hazlenuts and Assorted Fruits covered with White Chocolate Piece Flambéed with Brandy). This was my second favorite order and again was well presented. They pour a hot syrup on top from a gold glass over the dessert which melts the perfectly rounded dessert to expose the ingredients inside -- kind of like a planet exploding to reveal it's inner deliciousness. 

Then we got the Miyabi (Green Tea Soufflé, Vanilla Ice Cream and Seasonal Fruits in a Green Tea Cookie Wicker Basket, Served with Kumquat Sauce). This was my third favorite, it was an interesting and unique taste with a bit more bitter taste than the other dishes but complimented well with the sweetness of other flavors. The various textures like crunchiness also added another layer. This would be great for those that prefer a dish that isn't overtly on the sweet side. 

After receiving the aforementioned desserts, we decided to just complete the rest of the menu with two additional dessert dishes -- in hindsight we wish we hadn't as the following two weren't as great in their taste. 

The Angel Cream (Fromage Blanc Mousse and Pear Mousse with Earl Grey Cookies and Dark Chocolate) was absolutely beautiful and a pleasure to watch being made with a special carefulness and precision. However, the taste which was unique and combined interesting flavors, wasn't at all to our liking. The last dish we got was the Mt. Fuji (Chestnuts Cream with Fluffy Sponge Cake). This was also interesting to watch being made, with spaghetti like dessert noodles being spurned out and spices dashed on top. This was very bitter and again, not very tasty in my opinion. 

Overall, we had a great experience at Sweets Raku, one that was heightened by our sitting at the bar and watching how each dessert dish was carefully made with care by the chefs. The dishes were well portioned and we were easily able to share each one amongst our party of four. For those trying Sweets Raku for the first time, I'd recommend trying just two to three of the desserts in the following order: Ichigo, Mars and Miyabi. Also try to get there early when they open or you'll have to wait in line that quickly builds.",AqR9SsmS6ehOnWV4-gO68Q,11,9,4,13jkVjQW8M2qjNPbAuWGIw

The Mt. Fuji cake was arguably the best dessert item I have ever eaten. The cream puff was delightful. The Jack in the Cup was a unique treat, if a tad too reliant on cinnamon. 

The best part about the food is that they don't rely too heavily on sugar. Everything is made with a clever blend of flavors.

The restaurant is very small, with about a dozen bar seats, and three small tables, so I don't recommend showing up with a large group of people.",ntMEMTFEOtiZmny6946Etg,1,0,5,tAmVEzJcf-weFl2SiPpUXw
3033059,2014-01-14,4,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I know EVERYONE and their Momma's are raving about what a WONDERFUL place this is.  If you want a great waste of hard earned money, sure! Honestly, any dessert place on the strip will knock this place out of the map when it came to taste.  The funniest thing is that almost every review of this place only talks about how the desserts look and how they are prepared, barely any of the review tells you how the food actually TASTES.  And if you're going to put ANY sort of food in your mouth, TASTE is pretty damn important. (DUH!)

The GOOD:
The ambiance and the posh-ness of the whole place (very IKEA-ish). I think the BATHROOM takes the cake for me (pun intended).  It was the most exciting part of the whole thing. AND the preparation/presentation of the food was pretty cool.  

THE BAD:
All smokes and mirrors in this place.  When it came to taste, it wasn't even up to par with basic desserts you can make yourself.  HONESTLY, the only thing this place has going for it, is that THEY MAKE THE FOOD LOOK GOOD. So, if you want to impress your friends on Instragram or Pintrest or your social medias, by all means, $25 + tip is not too much, I guess.  But if you want to satisfy your cravings for sweets and dessert, THIS PLACE IS NOT IT.  

ETC:
The flavor, texture and the complex of their menu items is very bland and I felt like I was eating a bunch of flavored fondant, except they left out the sweetness and delectable aspects of a dessert. There's no comfort in it.  No warmth in the dessert.  It was just plain and simple, OKAY.",gsxImpt-CgCOfDe9Bghnsw,11,3,2,7crMAOj3FVPNc1fJBDxgpg

Pate Liver  - this wasn't my favorite since it was served cold and I've had better pate but decent, probably wouldn't order this again. 
Cheese Plate - this was excellent and my fav! 
prosciutto - this was a hit for our table and was gone in minutes. 

Ichigo- this is there #1 seller, the presentation is stunning but the taste is a little on the sweeter side - still very yummy! 
Mars - this was delish and very light in taste 
Carbi - this was served in a wine glass and very light in flavor as well.

Outside there is a big metal spoon hanging at the front entrance and as we walked in there was a glass wall of wine bottles displayed.  There are tables and a bar area but I highly recommend sitting at the bar so you can watch the Chefs in action.  Inside is bright, white and very clean.  We were greeted and asked where we wanted to sit, luckily there was space available at the bar.  We were given an edible menu (yes you can eat it)  and they explained each item to us.  Feeling so excited, we ended up ordering three desserts, the Baton, Carib, and the Prix Fixe which is a three-course dessert.

::Desserts::
I will start with the Baton, inside the Baton is cream, chocolate and pistachio mousse.  The Baton is delicate, thin, and made of a crispy chocolate shell.

Next is the Carib, it is served in a glass wine and presented to you when the Chef completes the masterpiece.  The wine glass is covered with a wafer, then they pour warm mango puree on top, the warm puree melts and seeps through the wafer; it looked like a waterfall going into the wine glass.  Inside the wine glass is a mixture of coconut cream, chocolate cream, white chocolate, kiwi, mango, banana, and a cinnamon crisp stick.

Now for the Prix Fixe (additional $7 for a glass of pairing wine), as I mentioned it is a three-course dessert.  From the list of desserts, I got to choose one; I picked the Stella (Strawberry Tiramisu). First, we got the Amuse which is pineapple sorbet with white jelly on top.  Next, the Strawberry Tiramisu was ready.  It had slices of strawberries and served with Raspberry Sorbet.  The plate was beautifully decorated with grapes, pineapple, gooseberry, and blueberry.  Then we got the Petit Four which is a cream puff.  For the filling I picked Chocolate, they also have Strawberry and Raspberry.  The cream puff was freshly made, served with raspberry and passion fruit marshmallow.

::Highlight::
I fell in love with this place, I will definitely be back!! I loved the presentation and the flavors of the Carib, it was so delicious.  The Prix Fixe was also pleasing because of the different desserts I got to taste.  Each course was appetizing and presented elegantly.  This place is unique and the desserts they serve I haven't seen anywhere else.  I won't forget the edible menu, it is rolled and inserted into a gold ring that you can also eat.  The menu has no flavor (I think it tastes like rice paper) but they give you a raspberry sauce to dip it in and the gold ring taste like lightly sweetened candy. The table setting is creative and there is also a big button under the table so the ladies can hang their purse. Before leaving make sure to use the restroom.  You will walk into a futuristic and clean restroom with cool gadgets!

They were featured in a show so the popularity grew. They need to get a bigger place because this place was very small. There were about 10 seats at the counter and maybe 3 booths, if I'm correct. The first time I was here was almost 2 years ago and I have been hooked since. I knew that every time I come back to Vegas, I had to stop here. It wasn't popular at the time so there was no wait time and we stayed almost 3 hours on a Saturday and also got to try some lunch sandwiches. I think there were 4 of us and we each did the 3 course dessert for $25 and we each ordered different desserts so that we could try them all. I love that they make everything in front of you. 

This time we waited about 30-45min but again it was worth it. It was hot but they had some iced lemon water for us. Sweets Raku was the reason I came back to Vegas so I had to drop by no matter what. We stopped by on a weekday so they opened at 6pm (Mon-Fri, closed Wed?). Therefore the sandwiches weren't available, just desserts. Last time they had edible menu that you tear and dip in this fruity sauce almost like chips and salsa which they currently are not serving. This time they didn't have the 3 course dessert for $25 but 2 course for $15 which came with a sorbet and a main dessert.  But what we did was saved $3 and ordered all the different kinds of desserts for $12 each and shared. There were 4 of us again but I think there were 5 main desserts so we got to try them all. Most of the desserts were the same as 2 years ago but had different flavors this time. They all still tasted amazing and so rich with flavors. Our bill came out to $100 so $25 each. So if you're the owner reading this, please get a bigger place or open from 12pm to midnight on weekdays too, not just the weekends.

Highly recommend sitting at the bar so you watch the chefs make the desserts. Saw one of the guests order the Carib where the chef poured the heated sauce on top of the sugar cover. The heat from the sauce then melted the cover to cover the dessert underneath in the glass. Such a fun and pretty presentation! 

Absolutely loved the amuse bouche as the pineapple sorbet wasn't overly sweet nor tart. Very refreshing and the white wine jelly complimented the sorbet very nicely as well. The Jack in a Cup is a chocolate souffle with banana creme filling that is injected right in front of you. So fun to watch the souffle rise. The cream puff had an airy but slightly crispy dough with the custard very light and airy (like whipped cream). All the house-made marshmallows were tiny but bursting with flavors.

Our waitress was very polite and described everything perfectly with much enthusiasm.

3130319,2015-08-15,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I was in Vegas for my younger brother's basketball tournament and was craving a pricier dessert option. I decided to try Raku Sweets with my parents while my brother hung out with his team. 

First of all, it's a really lowkey place off the strip in the middle of Chinatown. There's a private lot, so finding parking is easy. Walking in, there's a ceiling to floor wine display. After going around it, I saw very few seating, maybe 20 spots. We sat at the counter to watch the pastry chefs assemble the dessert. 

I thought they had an edible menu, but we received a regular menu. Water was served immediately on a red, rubber, lego coaster. I ordered the $15 dessert set which came with a mushed Jell-O shot/cream/sorbet starter (I don't remember the French names) and one main dessert (I ordered the soleil. The starter was perfect - sorbet was tart, cream was smooth and subtle, and the jello was fun! The Soleil was beautiful! Watching them assemble it was an experience. It was filled with Mascarpone and sorbet, outer gelato shaped like an apple, and complete with sugar stem and leaf with a flower and raspberry decorations. 

My parents ordered a cappuccino (which came with rock candy), chefs choice (chocolate truffle, macaron with sorbet filling, and a strawberry tart), and wine flight (2 reds 1 white, served with cheese). 

Overall, the experience was amazing and almost visited the next day. Definitely a must every time we stop by in Vegas! Bill was about $40",gDFC24gcljLCeWGGjL45hA,1,1,5,f6ojNq6RUsjRJqVAAfxv4Q

The store front is a beautiful glass display of wines, the bar is full marble and you have a full view of the chefs making the desserts you order before your very eyes. The large wall art piece of the world is very ornate and colorful! Very nice decor.

The only thing that bothered me was the $12 minimum per person. We came here for a double date (plus child) and we share everything. Unfortunately, the boys opted to leave with the child bc of the extra charge... That would've been a very expensive bill. Beware if you're trying to share. There is also a charge for sharing. $9! what... I felt nickel'd-n-dime'd at this point but we continued.

We ordered on dessert each. The male chef took this time with my dessert and it was exquisite! He plated sauces and even wiped the plate clean... on the other hand, the female chef was busy filling cake ordered and put minimal effort into my friend's dessert. The dish felt thrown together and messy. Definitely wasn't up to par of what the male chef gave me.

Actually I was looking for Raku on Yelp to see what I should get this last time, and came across the high ratings for Sweets Raku.  Boy oh boy were we NOT disappointed.

After a huge-a** dinner, we came to Sweets Raku and got in line.  It was rather quick to get seated if you didn't want to sit at the bar.  A lot of people like sitting at the bar so that they can see the chef make their desserts, kind of magical and good if you come with kids, or are a big kid yourself.

We went with the pre-fixe even though we were full as hell from dinner, because we were like eff it, diet in the new year!  

Let me just say, I have never had a panna cotta like this one.  Every morsel, every bite, everything was awesome.  You will close your eyes and see unicorns and rainbows.  

The hubs got the strawberry tiramisu which I was thinking at the time didn't sound that enticing and I thought he was making a huge mistake...but alas it was also very delicious.  

The cream puffs at the end, I will admit, I also thought would be just another standard cream puff like bear papas .. nope!  Dat flavor.  Perfect amount of melt in your mouth, cream was less thick and didn't feel gross as some cream puffs can make you feel.

If you are in the area, stop by.  It is delightful.  It is a Japanese dessert place, so expect light flavors and light sugar (i.e. if you regularly eat American sweets and don't think sodas are too sugary... you may not like this place!)",pD4c0eVE0ImAgcag4w4-lA,3,3,5,zqbEs10qdk3sckSNCM2xQQ

Was it good? Yes. Was it mind blowing? No.

I went with two others, we all got three different desserts to maximize our dessert experience. 

I got the Ringo (essentially a deconstructed apple pie with a delicate apple filled with custard and caramel), my friend got Mars (chocolate dome? With fruit and other custard underneath - poured with flames Hennessy over it), and lastly primavera (coconut sorbet with raspberry jelly, gelatin, chocolate- hot Rasberry poured over).

Everything looked beautiful and had great detail - the taste wasn't anything spectacular. In addition, none of them really spoke English so we just nodded yes to everything lol. Lastly there is a spending limit for each person apparently.

Do I recommend this place? Yes, to say you went.

3247694,2017-12-07,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Sweets Raku definitely hits a sweet spot. 

Things to know: 
- this place is very small, only 2-3 small/medium tables and bar seating in front of the pastry chefs doing fine handiwork
- line starts at the front, they seat full groups as soon as seat availibility opens up
- they require a minimum of $12 purchase per person
~they offer desserts a-la-carte for $12 or a combo option for $15, which includes the main dessert & the seasonal dessert 
~ try to get seated at the bar, best view of the dessert prep

{desserts)
~~ seasonal dessert: earl grey crème brulee: small but packed with flavor. I liked that it wasn't overly sweet, and it had a very nicely torched sugar layer, when overdone, it can become bitter in flavor
~~ Ichigo - means strawberry in japanese. I thought this dessert was so intricate. We were seated at the bar, so we got front row seats watching the chefs maticulously add in all the different steps/flavors/textures that go into the making of the dessert. I really enjoyed all the different textures of this dessert dish (crunchy, smooth, creamy, candied, etc). 
~~ Carib - I liked this one because it was served in a wine glass and the presentation is on point with the pouring of the cream to melt the top chocolate layer. I usually hesitate about coconut flavored desserts, but this panna cotta was so delicious and had so many other fruit elements in it. 

{drinks}
~~ Ume Breeze: sparkling drink - plum sake and champagne- light and fruity and served with a slow melting ice-sphere which I liked cus we could let it sit while waiting for the desserts to come out.
~~ wine flight - served in test tubes on ice, you get a white, red, and dessert wine. I wasn't expecting it, but it also came with some cheese! Not a fan of (or just not cultured enough for) overly stinky cheese, but it was worth a try. 

Overall, I think this place is worth its price point because of their open preparation & serving concept, you really get a sense of how intricate the desserts are. I can see why they enforce a minimum per person to prevent a large group from just sharing one measly dessert, so just be prepared! (plus if you come with more people, you have a chance to try other desserts!) Recommended spot to check out if youre looking for a dessert place off strip.

Each patron will be given an edible menu held together by a ring and served with a side of apricot sauce. It is a very unique visual presentation but unnecessary to finish. Listed on the menu is a prix-fixe three course menu. My friend split the three course with mango sorbet, Mount Fiji, and cream puff. 

Our first course was the mango sorbet which arrived in a scoop with a generous strip of mint jelly down the middle. Any mango lovers would enjoy this smooth sorbet with a blatant and tangy flavor. Mount Fiji was a chestnut cream cake with thin slices of chocolate wafer pieces. The flavors were delightfully light but I'm generally not a fan of heavily-creamed desserts. Our last course was the chocolate cream puff with vanilla custard and a side of strawberry and mango jelly. The tangy jelly pieces was a good contradiction of the sweet cream puff which was freshly baked. 

We were so pleased with the above that we even added another dessert, the Stella. It was a strawberry tiramisu with seasonal raspberry sorbet. Rather than being a typical tiramisu sprinkled with coffee powder and flavored with cocoa, it was done so with strawberry and a much lighter mascarpone cheese.

I seriously think this is a hype and will blow over once the wind shifts on to the next big thing.  Secondly, because they are so popular now they can't care less about customer service AT ALL! They WILL NOT, ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT seat you unless you are the very next one in line. We were a party of three and there were 4 parties of two's behind us. They had a seat for 2 at the bar open for 40 minutes(!!!!) but because we were a party of 3 and could not sit there they did not even ask the other  couples behind us!!!! Two of the couple left after waiting for almost an hour and I finally had to tell the server that it was ok to let the couple behind us to go ahead and sit at the two open spots! She looked confused but when I kept telling her that the two chairs has been empty for 40 minutes and the couple behind us should be allowed to sit before us she finally nodded and let them have the seats! It was like as if I solved the most complicated calculus equation and she just could not get it!!!!!! What a stupid policy! But I guess they are doing such good business they don't care to accommodate as many clients as quickly as they can. It's a very very small place and people just ""hang out"" even after they've finished eating delicately and leisurely sipping their wine or coffee or tea even though they see the line of people waiting for so long. So all in all the desserts aren't that outta this world for me to put my husband and my son through this torture. I will wait till they're not the IT place anymore and then  they actually care about client retention to come back here again. Because for now it's their way or the highway and no matter how sweet their desserts are you leave with a bitter feeling in your mouth and for 70$ for the 3 of us I just don't think that was worth it!",RhKxw4kP1V3mlxJXtyEZXw,2,0,1,pZeREre6VTbHZnVyxpWGag
3321338,2017-07-31,5,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Leave it to this place to get me to emerge out of my Yelp review hibernation of at least three-ish years!! I just have to share the joy of finally experiencing this place after years of keeping it on my bookmarks. 

My friend and I arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday night and there were only two other people sitting at the bar. We were greeted by the friendly staff and were given the menu of featured desserts for that particular day. I'm not sure if the menu is daily, weekly, or seasonal. 

I can only describe this place as a true feast for the senses. As soon as you walk in you can smell the butter, flour, and sugar aroma. Then you sit down and watch the workers prepare the desserts. Everything they do is meticulous and well organized. It's a small space they are working from but you can see they all work in sync with each other and get the job done in this sort of rhythmic, fluid motion. Definitely a feast for the eyes to see. When they drop your dessert they give you the description of what you're about to enjoy. You look at the dish with heart-eyes and start to feel bad that you are going to destroy this work of art they just prepared for you.

As soon as you take that first bite, all feelings of any kind of guilt will disappear. You're already thinking about when your next cheat-day will be because you can't wait to come back here and try the other desserts you saw the patrons next to you order. And you'll start thinking of the people you'll want to bring here that will totally appreciate this one-of-kind experience. 

Make sure you have a good amount of battery life and storage on your phone because you don't want to be like me and have a dead phone. So many great photo and video opportunities here.

If you're not much of a dessert person, they do offer some savory dishes to order from. This is a place that is definitely worth cheating on your diet for and also writing home (or Yelp) about. It's good to be back.",S2tfbnjoCzMX0U0B_cTXVw,7,6,5,5ArAs14lBXr28FZBQuXr2A

Strawberry tiramisu: just the perfect amount of sweetness. The presentation was absolutely beautiful!

Vanilla cream puff: puts beard Papa to absolute shame.

The ladies there were all so sweet and explained everything to us. The overall experience took about an hour. I understood that it took time to put together such beautiful and edible art.

Whether that's a successful experimentation with flavor or putting on a show to deliver the culinary experience, I'm all in.  As long as the flavor isn't diminished, I'm willing to pay extra for this type of extra. 

Raku Sweets delivers on that promise. Specializing in tantalizing desserts, Raku Sweets offers various pies, parfaits, and sundaes with flair. We sampled a few items including the strawberry parfait with a searing pour of topping to crack the top layer of the glass, the chocolate cake with hot run poured into the center, and a deli table apple pie presentation with an sugar apple cone. I thoroughly enjoyed the apple pie the best because the crust melted in your mouth and I thought the plate was absolutely beautiful to put it over the top. But none of the desserts disappointed. A few more options were in the menu as well and I believe they rotate and have some sample tasting menus with presumably smaller portions.

People seem to love it here (I would assume that is why there is a line out the door), usually that's a sign to grow the business a little bit, maybe expand the space to allow for more seating? Maybe try to buy out the lease on the unit next door? Just a few ideas, but anyway we stood there in line for a good 45 minutes waiting for a seat. We were finally seated at the bar front and center right in front of the chefs. I must say I love the home style kitchen; very nice!

Food is incredibly overpriced in my opinion. I write this statement even after witnessing how much detail and labor go into making every single piece, but Christ, prices this high? At least make the portion sizes a little larger to justify the pricing, then that would bump it up to 4 stars. Do something about the waiting in line (add more seating, expand the space) then we're looking at a 5-star business here!",PvBGeJiEAIIh_2puTDSmHQ,2,1,3,MUfv472BQi77Md-asbpruw

3352557,2018-01-17,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Recently went here over the holidays and didn't think the desserts I had were as good as what I had when they first opened. They are now charging a prix fixe pricing of $15 for 2 items. For the 2 items, you get to pick one item from the 5 main desserts they have and 1 from the seasonal items (when I went, they offered 2 seasonal choices: an earl grey crème brulee and a raspberry sorbet).  

I chose the earl grey crème brulee and Mars for the main dessert. The crème brulee was good, but the portion was so tiny (it came in a mini ramekin). The presentation of Mars was impressive (it involved pouring flambéed brandy onto the dessert, which then melted the dome of the dessert made of white chocolate). It made for a good video to post on your Instagram, but the taste was just not great. It mostly tasted bitter to me and I looooove liquor, so it's not because I don't like the taste of brandy. I just think it was a very imbalanced dessert. The brandy overwhelmed the yuzu mousse, as yuzu is quite a delicate flavor. I could barely find the yuzu taste. Also, while it was impressive to watch, the whole pouring flamed brandy act ruined the dessert appearance. It was beautiful before and after, it turned into a melted wax looking thing that's not very appetizing to me.

My friend ordered Ichigo (a strawberry mousse with strawberry sorbet and condensed milk inside a white chocolate cup). It tasted better than Mars, but nothing special.

I felt that this place was way better before and has gone downhill in the flavor profile. The desserts I had at that time were delicate, beautiful, and most importantly, delicious. The edible menu added to the coolness factor. After this visit, i don't think i will plan to revisit it again.",A5RC8s-n2FEbAR5GRUNHDA,1,0,2,Xf3gvc6gs98tS31CpKLOdw

Tried the prix fixe menu $19 which consisted of a pineapple sorbet with white wine jelly as 1st course, then Angel Cream (fromage pear) for 2nd course, and a cream puff with chocolate custard.  The menu they present to you is actually edible.  Just break it open and after you select what you want and tell the waitress, you can tear it apart and dip in raspberry sauce to eat.   The desserts I had  tasted like heaven!  I have a serious sweet tooth and although these were not on the super sweet side they were delicate yet so decadently delicious!  We sat at the bar and watched as our selections were created which was awesome to see.   They also sell macaroons freshly made to go and other goodies to!

They have prix fixe menu for 19 bucks. It includes 3 courses desserts. The first course is sorbet, it's like an appetizer. The second course is your pick from the Today's menu. And the third course is chef's special. 
They are doing soft opening by invitations only i think. Their grand opening is August 6th. 
This restaurant is small, maybe 20 seats. The decor is simple. The space is very opened and well lit. They have a bar and you can watch them making your desserts. 
I had mango sorbet with mint jello as the first course. The mint jello balanced out the sweet and sour of the mango sorbet. It was such a great start. 
The second course i tried named apollo. It's basically chocolate and raspberry mousse with chocolate sponge cake and fresh cream ice cream. The meringue and the chocolate crispy rice came with it was so good. Everything comes well together and it's not too sweet. 
Also in the second course choice was the marriage. It is banana sponge cake, banana pudding, strawberry mousse and white chocolate decorations. It was ok.
The last course was the lava chocolate cake with pineapple and raspberry marshmallow. It was the sweetest dessert overall. The size of it was small, its such a right portion to finish off 3 courses desserts meal. 
I love their concept: a little sour to start off the meal, a little bit of sweet as the main course, and a sweeter desserts to finish off the meal as dessert. They did a very good job to balance out the sweetness, it's not too overwhelming. 
However 3 courses desserts might be a bit too much, i might not come back anytime soon. It's a meal by itself.

The place itself has a beautiful interior, but very small, they have tables which seat around 15 people and the bar area (where you can see for yourself the desserts being made, which is awesome!) maybe 10. It's a very popular place and I have read that they run out of desserts after a certain time. Fearing this, my girlfriend and I immediately went straight to Sweets Raku after we landed and dropped off our things. It was a 2pm on a Saturday and surprisingly there was no wait! We were seated right away at the bar. Thank goodness because after we left an enormous group of 15 or so came in. 

Mars: amazing to look at it being flambeed, but not my cup of tea, only because I don't like alcohol. I didn't think the alcohol taste would be so apparent, but you can definitely taste it, especially at the bottom. Good thing my girlfriend likes alcohol so it wasn't a waste hahah I was able to take a spoonful to try and besides the alcohol taste, the inside contents were pretty okay, nothing memorable or grand. SO DEFINITELY DON'T GET THIS FOR YOUR KID

Primavera: probably their most popular dessert and even cooler to see the raspberry sauce crack through the thin layer of white chocolate. A must get if you come here. I definitely liked this one a lot more, great balance of flavors between sweet and fruity. Although it tasted great, similar to the mars, it wasn't amazing or mesmerizing. 

PRICE: Price-to-portion wise it's expensive ($12 a la cart or $15 for one specialty dessert + sorbet), but here you're essentially paying for the experience, which is just as great! Which is why I believe it's a place you should try at least once! 

SERVICE: amazing! The workers were very kind and attentive, checking back often to see how everything was.

-desserts: we ordered their signature dessert which is called Mars, which was covered with white chocolate, then they melt it into fire. We felt the smooth and richness of the white chocolate, it was so good that I wanna keep it in my mouth as much as I can, I didn't wanna swallow it. It can be rated more than 5 stars. Then we had another one is looked like the angle, the appearance already earn more than 5 stars, it's not making you feel heavy on that. The concept and combinations of the dessert was perfect. The last pieces were the chocolate that they special made, there was some alcohol inside the caramel, hmmm, you will enjoy it so much, and the lady gave us 2 pieces of almond chocolate as an extra, it's also tasted really good.
-drinks: we have the all you can drink sangria, we tried the red one first, it slowly made me feel buzzed. Then they gave me the white one after we finished the first one. The white one was so refreshing and it's sweeter than the red one, but it's good.

There's a minimum $12 order per customer now - did you know? I feel like that's a bit of a stretch for a dessert shop, though we obliged and ordered.

COURSES
Raspberry sorbet - good
Ichigo - pretty, but flavors were whatever
The pannacotta in the glass - decent, though the chocolate was odd

I think there's a reason why the chef was awarded for her pastry-ability back in the day, but the menu has literally not changed one iota, which shows me a high level of laziness. No, changing the flavor of the sorbet does not count. If you want to be able to demand big bucks in the dessert business and keep bringing in customers, you need to continue innovating. I'm not surprised there's no more lines waiting to come here - there's not enough of a draw to keep me coming back for more.

By the way, it actually gets worse - in the past you actually got more for your money. The menu used to be edible, and now even that is lacking, despite the bump in prices.

GOOD: pretty courses if you've never seen them before, decent interior design, polite service

It's located in the same plaza as Raku, Monta, Curry Zen, Big Wong, and other favorites....man this plaza does have some awesome foods. You can spend the whole day here!!

It's a small intimate restaurant, I don't know if I can even call it that but I will for now. It's mostly bar seating with a few tables, but personally I think everyone would rather sit at the bar. You get to watch them make everything! Well most of everything at least. 

So first off the edible menu....it's basically rice paper, which was awesome by itself but they gave us an apricot dipping sauce when we went. It changes from what the server told me, so it was currently apricot, which is one of my favorite fruits! Score! 

I got the three course dessert, prix fixe which isn't too badly priced honestly. Although I wouldn't spend $19 on dessert normally all the time, but once in a while and if you go to any upscale restaurant then it's really honestly not bad at all. 

Started off with a raspberry sorbert which was presented perfectly on a plate, it was fun to watch them plate everything and the techniques they use. Typical Japanese sorbert, at least for me (again I grew up in Japan) it wasn't too sweet basically perfect amount of sweetness! 

The Stella was almost too pretty to eat. I mean it was stunning to look at and I really just would have been satisfied staring at it, but alas you gotta eat it at some point!! The creme they use wasn't overpowering and didn't take away from the fruits. The tiramisu with the strawberries was delicious. I think it might be one of their popular dishes and well I could tell why just by the presentation of it and with the taste matching that of the presentation just shows you how the craftsmanship of this was top of the line!

And finally a creme puff, it was alright, nothing too superb as the bread part was too hard for my tastes. I like it when it's soft, but the creme inside was pretty good as it wasn't super sweet. The gelatin cubes were cute!! Reminded me of the candy I always used to get called cube while I was growing up in Japan. 

The servers are mostly Japanese that speak your typical FOB English, but it isn't too bad. And I'm sure they wouldn't mind if you wanted to try practicing your Japanese with them.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,2,2,5,7NbQXOT0K5y0AKWEIdIVkA

The service is very attentive and friendly. our waitress explained and answered all of our questions with a smile of her face. My bf and I ended up sharing a tasting. The menu is edible....and it tastes like paper. For some reason I thought it would taste like white chocolate...I don't know why, but it was far from it. It was seriously like eating paper and raspberry sauce. The Amuse was pretty good, and Veil was really delicious. The Petit Four with the Lava Cake was interestingly good, No complaints.

3446170,2016-12-04,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I loved Sweets Raku! I came with a group of medical school friends who were visiting me in Vegas, and we all had a pleasant experience. The place is not very big, but was fairly empty when we came so we didn't have to wait. The interior is very bright and has a sleek, simple, but sophisticated atmosphere (very Japanese).

The employees are all Japanese and spoke Japanese to each other. We chose to sit at the bar to watch them make the desserts, which I highly recommend doing. The care and detail that goes into making each dish is remarkable, though since the menu isn't too big, they get good at making their subset of dishes. The mannerisms of the workers are very Japanese too.

There is a minimum order (dollar amount) per person, which we managed to meet fairly easily. They offer a ""combo"" deal which comes with a sorbet starter, but since the combos all come with same sorbet, we decided to just order one combo and the rest of our desserts a la carte.

We thoroughly enjoyed all of our dishes. Our party of four shared everything and had a lot of fun eating each dish and savoring the various components with their different textures.

While the desserts here aren't that cheap, they aren't crazy expensive either, considering the quality of the food and the experience that you get. I highly recommend checking it out for something unique!

P.S. I apologize for the lack of photos! I went searching and couldn't find any, then remembered that I didn't get to take any since my phone died, and had to borrow a friend's phone just to check-in. I'm sure to return to Sweets Raku someday though, so will add photos after a future visit!",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,1,1,5,DWjczsbOk1F4B8vQDsxRkg

We ordered the caviar and did the dessert deal for $15 per person. The caviar is from Italy and it is a 10g can. If you haven't tried caviar before, I recommend just smearing the caviar on the bread/cracker only. They gave us Mayo, onions etc. to dress the caviar, but I didn't use any of that. Enjoy the taste to the fullest! :)
Next was the pineapple sorbet, which was really delicious. I can't emphasize how good the sorbet was. Tasted like fresh pineapples! Mmm. Second we got the Carib and Mt. Fuji. Both were different in their own way and it was good. It wasn't overbearinly sweet. All I can say about this place is, if you aren't a huge fan of sweets, at least come here for the experience and the ambience. Each dessert is delicately made in front of you.

3476239,2016-12-28,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Sweets Raku is not just a dessert place--it's an experience to sit at the bar and watch the expertise of the chef crafting elegant desserts in front of you. It's remotely analogous to integrating the wonders of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the classiness of the cocktail bar, the novelty of Benihana, and the comfort of the breakfast at your kitchen's bar stools.

Note that there is a minimum order of one dessert per customer, so come with a prepared wallet and stomach. Desserts are $12 each, with the option to upgrade to an extra course of the ice cream/sorbet daily special for $15. (There are also $5 cream puffs, and I'm not sure if it counts for the minimum order)

My MOUNT FUJI was a heavenly mountain of chestnut cream covering a snow-capped top of whipped cream and a fluffy sponge cake base with bits of candied chestnut in between. The exterior was garnished with angular pieces of crispy crepes (similar to Gavotte cookies) and chocolate with the name of the store, with a dusting of cocoa for good measure. The various textures and fragrant chestnut prepared two ways made a memorable and photogenic dessert. I found it too sweet, but I'm the type of person who avoids anything over 30% sugar milk tea like the plague; I think it suits the taste of most people. 

The boo liked the MARS for its incorporation of alcohol. I disliked it because the server torched and melted the shell before I could take a satisfying picture of the exterior. (First world problems...) The yuzu mousse and chocolate cream with hazelnut and blackberry, covered with brandy-flambéed white chocolate did feature an excellent blend of citrus, nutty, fruity, sweet, and alcoholic, rendered even more complex by the torching. The smooth dome with Mars-like crimson swirls was beautiful and melted with poise, though afterwards it looked like an amorphous mush reminiscent of anatomy lab. My slight disappointment with the interior is compensated by the unique preparation of the plate with a yellow gradient from a wizardly magical candy spray-paint spout. 

The heavy smell of sugar and baking is in the air to entice those with a sweet tooth. Decor was minimalist yet bouge, with white marble counters. Even the water cups are modern with a tulip glass shape and a slip-proof mat that looks like lego.

Pro tip: The ideal time to visit is when there's still seating at the bar, but with other visitors having placed orders so you can watch more desserts being made. We went after lunch around 1:30pm on a weekend and it was perfect.",4jPsIgMZT4_Ks5-myaW9Bg,4,1,4,gGETXeufiqPPbDMjng9TLA

I sat at the bar because I wanted to watch them bake the desserts. I now understand why the waits are so long, since each piece of dessert takes time to prepare. 

I tried the ichigo (strawberry) and mars dessert. Ichigo was definitely my favorite! It was so delicious and wasn't too sweet. Hennessy is poured over mars to open the ball (see picture). You can definitely taste it when eating the dessert haha

Part of the appeal is watching dishes be created in front of you. They no longer use the edible menu. Instead a more traditional printed menu with pictures and descriptions is used. A 2 course dessert pairing ($15) is listed in place of the previous 3 course option. I inquired about the 3 courses and the accommodated me. 

To start was a smooth and light strawberry sorbet with jelly, followed by the perfectly light for summer Mt. Exotic. Its subtle sweetness and crispy base were topped with a spongey cake and mango cream with tartness and acidity added from a raspberry sauce. My wife ordered the Ringo ($12) a la carte. It's a gorgeous and well crafted apple pie. The caramelized apples were covered by a crispy lattice crust, next to it was honey ice cream and an apple-shaped object made of sugar and filled with cream and caramel. It's an absolute must when visiting this place and one of the better desserts I've had in town. Ending the meal was a delicate and flaky cream puff filled with a semi sweet chocolate cream and raspberry sauce.

Service was excellent. The interior is stark white, clean and pristine. The chef's work station is something to behold. It's immaculate. It's interesting to watch her work.

I got the Fuji Mountain because I'm a sucker for chocolate, while my brother and my mom enjoyed their Caribs. I've tried all four main dishes that were offered here in the past, and they were all absolutely delightful. For some dishes, the dessert chef may even allow customers to put the finishing touches on their own dessert!

The servers are young, sweet, attentive, and more than willing to answer customers' questions.  

$12 for a dessert may seem pricey at first glance, but it really isn't, considering how much effort and attention to detail goes into each of these creations. I also see that they have added some new items to the menu, so I will definitely be back!

I almost got them confused with another ""Raku"" in the same plaza at first, but the other actually sells grilled food I believe. The place is very brightly lit as everything is ""white"" and gives off that clean, upscale eatery vibe. On a Thursday night there was a 30 minute wait for the counter where all the action takes place, but trust me its worth the wait as thats where all the action awaits!

First off, the menu itself is edible and its super cool to watch yourself stuffing paper bits into your mouth with mouthwatering peach sauce to use as dip.

Dessert we ordered the prix fixe menu for $19 which comes with:
- mango sorbet with green jelly-delicious! A must for mango lovers!! The flavor was super strong with a hint of sourness. 
-Jack in a cup-a chocolate souffle with a choice of vanilla or chocolate creme filling which is injected in front of you using a cool pipe-looking gadget and a half ring of nuts, fruity marshmallow squares, and popcorn I believe? This specific dessert was a little too sweet/rich for my liking so I only ate half..
-cream puff- crispy puff with a light semi-sweet raspberry filling.

From the a la carte menu $12 we ordered:
-Stella ( strawberry tiramisu)- probably the most beautiful presentation of all with a small strip of fresh fruits and light airy cream but I didn't try the actual bread portion.
-carib? MY FAVORITE! A wine glass filled with kiwi, banana, pudding, then topped with a thin lid which is melted as hot fruit puree is poured on top creating a cascading effect.

All in all it was well worth the wait and a unique experience, but the desserts are slightly overrated. We found ourselves a tad grossed out after finding a hair sticking out of the comped cookies and noticing the chef cutting fruits and plating the desserts with bare hands...but no biggie because we still ate the food.",7x1LWVBDNRaR1lPyfp3JUQ,3,1,4,qMCoyCgR4jvLJ_e4-EBsUw

Once inside you realize that you are in it for a long wait. The decor is clean and simple with the counter displaying the pasty artists at work. After waiting for about an hour and half, we got a seat at the counter and our show started.

He ordered the Puffy Cup and I got the Ringo.
The Puffy Cup is a berry souffle and it was interesting to watch it rise in the oven before our eyes. While that was baking the 2 chefs were busy at work making a handful of dishes. I saw my candy apples being made in front of my eyes and my apple pie pasty baking up. During this time I saw a couple of the Caribs made for some other customers.

The Puffy Cup was light as air and not overly sweet. The vanilla cream filling was just enough but not heavy on the cream. The best part was the little mango jelly on the side.
The Ringo was beautiful.  The apple pie was delicious and the crest was a flaky, buttery delight. The honey ice cream on the side complimented the pie perfectly with the dash of cinnamon. The candy apple was too pretty to eat but I eventually cracked it open. Inside was whipped cream and caramel.

All in all, a lovely experience and the desserts were very yummy. Would I come again? No, the wait was not worth it. Glad I had the experience, but the desserts did not change my world.",n7Axf0oKfqBprrNT26z2Hw,0,0,3,EYjZchEST7Zp5dnxTZ17jA

I guess because its not high season for Vegas and its already been opened a while, there was practically no line. 2 parties before us and we got seated within 30 minutes (the place is small. 3 tables and an L shaped bar only). It was about 9pm. 

They were out of foie gras so we got some Pate, which was very flavorful, and had a layer of caramelized sugar on top that added a hint of sweetness to play off the savory. For dessert, we got the Ringo (deconstructed apple pie) and the Primavera (panna cotta and sorbet)

The Ringo was delicious. After seeing many reviews on how items don't taste as good as they look, I wasn't expecting it to be this good! the candy apple was much smaller than I imagined but it was light, playful, and delicate with caramel inside. The pastry under the apple compote thing was SUPER flaky. I ate that part last because i assumed it'd be typical and difficult to eat but the flavor of the apple mix was amazing and the tender flakiness of the pastry took it to another level. 

The Primavera was ordered mostly for its interactive presentation purposes but it was DELICIOUS! Again, I was probably not expecting much in taste so I was surprised at how tender and delicate the panna cotta was. I also LOVE berries and fruity sauces any day and watching it melt the creamy chocolate all over everything was just the icing on the cake.

They could do better of explaining what will happen during the experience. I didn't know exactly how things were going to go and I ate most of the edible menu before the sauce came out because no one told me not to eat it. The pastry chefs make all the desserts in front of you, which is really cool. Everything we had was plated beautifully and not your standard looking desserts. All the desserts were very light tasting and not too sweet, which is what I prefer. We all ordered one of the basic tasting menus and tried to order a variety of desserts. This worked out well in that we passed our desserts along to each other across the bar, so that we could all taste everything. I recommend coming with several people that you don't mind sharing with if you want to try a lot of items on the menu otherwise it could get really pricy here.

While Chika Tilman at Chikalicious in NYC may have started this concept, Sweets Raku has definitely elevated it...

We arrived at about 8pm to an already PACKED house and endured a 45 minute wait which was perfect because the spots that cleared up for our party of four were dead center at the bar, so we could see all the action! There have been some changes lately...a couple of pastry cooks have been added to assist Chef Mio and her assistant behind the scenes, especially during crunch time. The menu has undergone some changes too. The Marriage and Mt. Fuji desserts are still there...gone are the Apollo, Veil, and Ringo Desserts. They have been replaced by:

THE ANGEL CREAM-Fromage and Pear with white chocolate wings and a pulled sugar halo

THE BATON-Chocolate tuile cylinder filled with  chocolate cake, passionfruit gelee, chocolate and pistachio mousses and a pulled sugar ribbon.

RED ROCK(The newest dessert)-Raspberry and white chocolate fondant(or lava cake, whichever you prefer ;) with streusel, vanilla and pistachio ice cream, yuzu marshmallow, and vanilla tuile garnished with spun sugar.

We decided to share the Baton and Red Rock Desserts since at that time, they were out of the Angel Cream dessert,( which was back on the menu by the time we were finished). Again, we enjoyed both desserts which were artistically presented with great flavors and textures while not being tooth achingly sweet. I also enjoyed my Iced Latte which never tasted watered down thanks to a genius idea of a coffee ice cube! 

Finishing out our sweet journey, the Chocolate Fondant has also been replaced by a crisp warm cream puff made to order with your choice of vanilla or chocolate cream flavored with your choice of ganache, black currant, or strawberry filling.
I will repeat again that this is a DESSERT EXPERIENCE, and if your idea of dessert is off a dollar menu, or ""$20 can feed the whole family"" at places like Mickey D's, Wendy's, Jack in the Crack, or Sonic, don't even bother coming here, and step aside for those who seek this type of adventure.   ALOHA!!!

3611977,2017-11-22,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"After a large meal at Kabuto next door, I rolled into Sweet Raku next door for more dessert.  I've seen this place in the strip mall and have always wanted to give it a try.

We were luckily seated right away at the bar (luckily because within 10 minutes there were several parties waiting for a table).  The menu itself is quite limited to several desserts and some coffee/tea/drinks.  Hubby and I shared what was essentially a strawberry shortcake and an earl grey creme brulee.  I'm not a huge fan of creme brulee compared to my hubby but this one has lots of earl grey flavour, which I appreciated.  It was hubby's THIRD creme brulee of the day (when in Vegas...) so he was creme brulee'd out at that point and said he preferred the first two he had earlier in the day.  The strawberry shortcake then arrived and it was magnificent both in presentation and flavour.  So delicious and unlike any dessert I've ever had.  Not toothache-y sweet and was light and creamy and yummy.  I didn't want to share!  

Sitting at the bar was very special because we got to see the chefs make the dessert and a lot of work and care and time went into making every dessert.  As I mentioned, the menu is quite limited so I am interested in whether the dessert menu changes over time.",MC-z0PlPXa8zaz3kyuGK2g,1,0,5,immeUd9M_wpSyrQxTFXoRQ

3621191,2013-08-24,11,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I have been waiting for sweets raku to be opened since a year ago. I visited this place with my husband on the second week after grand opening. We came here with full stomach and high expectation after dinner. I have to say it was worth the wait! We shared the pre-fixed menu ($19) and ordered momo (peach) and champagne rose tea ($6). (FYI, they charge $5 additional for sharing pre-fixed menu and $7 extra for dessert wine pairing !) We had seating at the desert bar and got to see how the magic happened. It was quite a show to see how pastry chef assembled all the pastries into art. 

Amuse - Mango sorbet with mint jelly and leaf
I never had mango with mint together before. I was surprised how well these two flavors went together, Sorbet had a thick texture, and I felt like I had real mango in my mouth. Mint jelly kinda refresh my palate in the end.

Marriage - sponge cake with banana cream and strawberries
I liked this dish a lot! Sponge cake tasted really moist and soft. Banana cream has just right amount of sweetness. 

Apollo - Chocolate and framboise mousse cake
I loved the earl grey ice cream on top of the this chocolate mousse cake. It was definitely the highlight of this dish. Also, the strawberry rice stick was very airy and delish!

Petits Fours - mini lava cake
lava cake was super chocolatey and went very well with raisins and passion fruit marshmallows. 

Our waitress told me that we have the option to order a la carte and it would be $12 each dish. It would definitely be a good option for people just want to have little sweet ending after a full meal from other restaurants. She also told me that sweets raku is gonna change their menu next week. (new items like apple pie and chestnut cream cake... and maybe foie gras dishes) I got really excited after hearing that!! Everyone knows me knows how much I love foie gras hahaaa!! Next time, I will come back to try their cheese plate with dessert wine pairing (illiskillin ice wine) and maybe foie gras dishes!!!!",VzBoi7n5pee-iLx5dc5BHA,18,17,5,zGjp8qBz-FgXcQXrM9osvg
3623066,2013-10-25,4,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I took my out-of-town friend here one night since she said she wanted to experience Vegas outside of the strip. What better spot then to take her to a dessert bar where you can supposedly eat the menu?! I've never been to a dessert place where there is actually a set menu with 3 different courses of dessert... faaa-annn-ccyyy! 

- Decor & Structure -  
Everything is covered completely in white - white tables, white counter top, white work space. Okay, I guess it''s just safe to say I pretty much stepped into heaven. 

There's about 2 4-top tables and 1 2-top table that are available to sit at (it may be just 2 total) and the rest of the sitting is at the bar that runs around the working area where you can watch them do their magic. We got there at 8-8:30PM ish on a Friday. I guess we came just in time because as soon as we were leaving there was a line looping around to the door. 

This may sound weird, but if you get a chance.. check out the bathroom!! I'm not going to tell you why, just do it.

- Service - 
Service was exceptional, as I would expect nothing less. When you first sit down, they give you a hot towel, of course like traditional Japanese custom. They will come back repeatedly to your table always checking to see if your glass is full and is very accommodating to anything you may need. 

- Menu - 
They offer 3 different kinds of specialty water that is shipped straight from the mountainous waters of Japan. No joke. One that is filled with ions to aid this, minerals to aid that, and one that is just the purest form. It comes in a large bottle that they take straight from the 'refrigerator window display'. It's about $4 a bottle which really isn't that bad when you compare it to the small tiny bottles of Dasani you buy in casinos on the strip, or even Starbucks. We started with all 3 bottles and to me it tasted all the same, except the purest, but hey if you're a water connoisseur you might really enjoy their selection.

Now for the important part, the desserts. To start, as you probably already know, they place a menu in front of you and because I read from other reviews that it's edible, I already began tearing pieces off and putting them in my mouth. Well, it tastes exactly like what you think a menu would taste... like paper. It was coiled and wrapped with a thin candy cane like ring. That was delicious! It's pretty much hardened burnt sugar, so it reminded me a lot of creme brulee. Well the server came back and saw that we had already began chomping away and gave us what we're actually supposed to dip it in had we waited. It was a raspberry syrup that honestly didn't make it taste that much better, but definitely very interesting!

They offer a set menu for $20 or you can order a la carte. Each dessert a la carte is ~$12. The set menu didn't really sound too appealing to me since I figure the first and last course would probably be more of a tasting experience. I was just interested in the main course which is the option you can order a la carte. I wish I could go into detail with each dessert we ordered (total of 3) but they were so fancy and I feel like the menu changes often so you really have to experience it yourself. One thing I can say is that if there's a strawberry shortcake on the menu, you can go ahead and skip that. It's nothing too spectacular. If they still offer it, go for the angel cheescake (?) - as cheesy as it sounds, it tasted like it was made in heaven. Hehe see what I did there? 

Anyway, this is something I never really experienced before and would definitely be a place I'd recommend for anyone looking for a date night, or just a sugar addict!",HmhjcPCVr0TbPsPhXV-Trw,7,8,5,ZHb_24z4z6vQ8XuBBSH5ag

3631293,2017-02-08,2,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Dessert lovers, gather round! Sweets Raku is a cute, little dessert bar located in Chinatown. It's a bit of a drive off the Las Vegas Strip but well worth it for checking out their selection of unique, creative sweets. If you have a sweet tooth that's in need of a good scratch, this is the place to go! Make sure to go early as the space is tiny and could incur a good wait if you come later in the day. Also try to sit at the counter so you can see the pastry chefs in the process of putting together all of the desserts!

Their menu often rotates and you can choose between their 2-course dessert set or ordering their individual desserts al a carte. Their 2-course dessert set gives you an amuse bouche plus a dessert of your choice. On the menu at this time was a raspberry sorbet but my boyfriend and I decided to just split the Mt. Fuji since we had just eaten lunch not too long ago. The Mt. Fuji is a chestnut cream cake, similar to that of the ever so popular Mont Blanc cake you'd find in Japan. The cake itself was incredibly light and spongy, stuffed with sweetened chestnuts, draped with a mildly sweet whipped cream and finally covered with a unique thick drizzle of fresh chestnut cream. The result was a gorgeous dessert that didn't look too far off from that of a snow-capped mountain. 

We also ordered a couple pots of their special green tea to enjoy with our cake. The peach green tea and the Tsugaru apple Green were both delicious, refreshing and worth trying out.",AsUvXYx9ZVn3IMJmAIwhYw,2,2,4,cu6qvXqPqmZ3ElrEEVLOog

Inspired by someone's Instagram, immediately bookmarked, and finally got to try it a year later. Yes you might drop $70 for ""just desert"" but the service is impeccable, the treats are out of this world, and you feel downright fancy pants.

Small place. Fits about 20ish. Always a line. We waited about 30min on a early Friday night but the staff is amazingly polite and does not rush anyone. Get a bar seat to watch them meticulously prepare the deliciousness with their ridiculously delicate hands. 

There's a daily menu of 6 main dishes, 2 seasonal supplement bites, and some standard options like sorbets. We ordered some cream puffs to go and the bite of the day was earl grey crème brulee. We had the Ichigo (strawberry shortcake), the Mars (brandy with mousse) and the Carib (tropical fruit blend). 

The crème brulee was tiny, but packed with WOW. We were supposed to eat with these awkward asymmetrical spoons that made me feel kind of stupid on how difficult it was. 

Ichigo was MIND BLOWING. And terribly fun to smash open. The variety of textures and flavors and overall depth of this dessert is amazing. There's crisp, there's sponge, there's gritty, there's creamy, there's cold, all 1000% delicious. 

Both Mars and Carib come with a show, and both also delightful on the tongue. I thought the alcohol was a little overbearing on the Mars, but I loved how the Carib instantly transported me to the beach. 

We met a couple who are regulars, who mentioned they've tried everything on the menu and said you can't go wrong with any. So we will obviously be back.",XwMZ4qe0Icf7csxWJ-Wm6A,2,2,5,PPaxG6g2Lsk6NSfXNLr7pw

Jack in the Cup - chocolate souffle with cinnamon filling. It was fun to watch them inject the filling. Too bad my fat finger accidentally exited out of my snapchat so I have no proof of how cool it was. I didn't care much for the filling, but the bread part was yummy and fluffy.

Finally made it over to Sweets Raku with a few of my buddies to check out what the ""red carpet"" out front was all about.  First off, I like the decor of the place.  You are immediately greeted by a wall of wine, which looks fantastic peering in from the outside, and a few pieces of novel art work on the wall (and in the bathroom.. very neat) that sets the tone of the evening: relaxed and inviting.  It was a little warm for my taste but they were baking stuff right in front of you so I quickly disregarded.

Now, the food.  I like the concept of the menu in that once you order off of it, you can eat it.  They even provide some dipping sauce (raspberry on this occasion, I believe) for you to dip and munch.  Pretty cool in my book.  Opted for a cheese place because we came from an edomae place before we hit up sweets and I wasn't ready to grub anything too big.  Also divulged in a few glasses Sav Blanc to keep the party going and for pairing purposes as well.  Not too shabby and the cheese plate was a pretty good way to keep me at bay over casual conversation.  The part I liked most about the cheese plate actually wasn't the cheese.. it was the spiced pastry sticks that came with it.  I would've just snacked on that for the evening if I could order just that!  Easily the highlight of the culinary venture here.  I also tasted some pistachio ice cream, mango and yuzu marshmallows, and a little bit of the Red Rock cake to get in on a few of the flavors that they had to offer.  Everything was alright but nothing to write home (or Yelp) about.  I definitely liked the fact that it wasn't super sweet as I am not really a fan of overly sweet desserts, but, again, it was an ok experience with nothing that really stood out.

Service was good and I liked the fact that I can see the staff divvy up some dishes right in front of me.  I think the prices are reasonable and probably worth the experience but with everything factored in, I just wasn't feeling it.  Note: I'm a bit more partial to the other ""face"" of Raku around the corner but just couldn't hang with this place.  Probably would bring my wife to try it out and see if she would like it but it's just not enough to coax me back for any other outings.",zB1GFKkXqn-vgoIgkjhPYg,4,2,3,mLO6yGPDC0FgNe0RVPYW_A

When I first saw the menu, I was a little shocked by the price.  It's $19 for a three course prix fixe dessert tasting, plus a $5 split plate charge (since my husband and I wanted to share).  But, after watching everything that goes into the dessert, I see why it's that price.

Let's go back to the beginning: when you walk in, it is a stark white, modern restaurant with this way cool wine rack/display.  I really dug the decor.  You sit down and in front of you is pretty much the coolest silverware you will ever see in your life.  A menu rolled up in a napkin holder thing is set in front of you.  You order, and then.....HOLD UP....the waitress pours some sauce on your plate.  What am I supposed to put in this sauce, you ask??  YOUR MENU.  The menu is freaking edible.  And so is the napkin ring holder thing it came in.  Oh my God, I would pay the money just for the experience of eating the menu.

The first course we had was a pumpkin and green tea pudding.  It was like a creme brûlée and very light and tasty.  For our second course, we ordered the Mt. Fiji cake, which is apparently very popular in Japan.  It was a sponge cake with chesnut cream frosting on top.  Last, we had this mini lava cake with fruit flavored ""marshmallow"" type things.

The whole menu was excellent, but one of the best parts is that you get to watch the chefs make these beautiful pieces of sugar art right in front of you.  The detail in the desserts is awe inspiring.

I shared the 2 course dessert menu for $15 with my friend and was told that they had a $12 minimum per person. Normally I would feel kind of iffy about this, but I see this as a well run establishment and I guess it's more of an incentive to try more of their desserts and goes towards the hard work of the pastry chefs. We decided to order the 5 piece box of macarons to go and this evened out to $24 for the both of us. 

Every dessert listed on the main course sounded so good and my friend and I had such a hard time trying to decide what we wanted. I ended up choosing the Ichigo because it looked so pretty and I LOVE strawberries. It was definitely a good choice because it tasted amazing. I honestly think it was the best dessert I've ever tried. There were so many elements to this dessert that I thought all worked together. It incorporated a lot of different textures and went from a hard white chocolate shell to a nice strawberry mousse with chunks of cake and a crunchy crust-like pastry with strawberry chunks, accompanied by a hardshell strawberry candy with strawberry sorbet and condensed milk hidden inside.

The 2 course dessert is definitely worth it for the price. It's even more worth it if you end up getting a seat at the bar and get to see the pastry chefs make it!

- nassy: pear pie. i opted for the set menu that came with a starter and the wine pairing. the starter was this refreshing sorbet. but the amazing part for me was the pear pie. it was visually stunning to look at. there was a candy pear! a delicate sugar piece filled with cream. the pear pie was crispy, and just sweet enough. it came with a very decadent caramel ice cream but there were layers of nuts, giving it this wonderful crunch texture. it was a very intelligent and delightful dish to eat. it hit all the flavors and textures you'd want while eating something. it was sweet, but not so sweet. it had a nutty savory quality too, but not overpowering. so delicate! 

pros:
- desserts! i tried my friend's orders, and everything was truly spectacular! 
- it's really fun watching them assemble it before your eyes! it's really captivating to watch. so sit at the bar and you wont be disappointed with the show!
- service, like typical of japanese restaurants, was top notch
- weird, but amazing bathroom. i'll leave it myserious like that. when you go, definitely go for a pee and be intrigued. i can share that they have a japanese toilet. :)
- loved the wine display. though, i hope the windows are UV protected since sunlight can damage wine... (omg is my oenophile side showing?)

cons:
- small! it's literally a bar, with a few seats to watch them assemble your desserts, and i think 2?3? 4top tables. so, not a place to bring 9 friends for dessert. but if your date has a sweet tooth, this place will definitely wow her
- pricey... ??? i guess? i mean our set menu, which came with a starter and delightful dessert was $15. not cheap, but considering the quality and the type of dessert you get, pretty spot on. i would not be afraid to pay $15 for just the pear pie i had at a regular restaurant. 
- small and delicate. if you're expecting giant american sized desserts, this is the antithesis of that. don't expect a slice of cake that you can share with your 9 friends. 

would i come again? sure!",JwF4WNVp2mY_HMeroVUOEw,0,0,4,x2LLmSN8N8qvAKf7FW1Z2Q

This time it was The Pearl.

The Pearl -- http://bit.ly/2lhpQQR
Rich chocolate mousse with caramel, banana, & pineapple, topped with white chocolate shell with passion fruit sauce candy pearl. 
The Pearl is amazing!  First off all, it's already entertaining enough seeing them put it all together piece by piece.  And like all their other edible pieces of art, you kind of don't want to eat it at first because it's so beautiful.  But in order to enjoy it more, you have to destroy it.  When you eat all the components together it basically tastes like a Chocolate Gummy Bear -- Chocolately with a little tropical flavor.  The actual 'pearl' itself was OMGYUM because of the brittle sugar shell with the passion fruit sauce inside.  You just have to give them a round of applause for the effort.

Another enjoyable experience at Sweets Raku is in the books.  I'm definitely looking forward to stopping by again (and again) next time I visit Vegas!",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,12,14,5,huTVhPIq84s8UWSUNenlAg

We got our 3 courses and the presentation is very beautiful, the combination is very creative, but the taste leaves more to be desired. The syrups used were not very tasty unfortunately.

Where do I start?  My first experience was in 2014 and I have been coming here almost every other month and as often as I can while living in Vegas.  Yes, that often and so worth every penny in my opinion.  Since moving away, every trip to Vegas now I have to visit at least once and purchase a large box macarons!  

Chef Mio is amazing with her creativity and patience.  She takes her time putting together her beautiful desserts as intricately as she possibly can.  English is her second language but she enjoys talking to her patrons to learn how they are enjoying their experience. 

Dining here is more of an experience than just a get in and get out sort of place.  You must sit at the bar if at all possible, but if you're in a large party,  you'll be seated at a table.  The reason why you should sit at the bar is because the experience is like an art show.  You watch Chef Mio start from beginning to end and create a masterpiece through multiple steps.  I think just watching her assemble each plate is just as enjoyable as eating it.  Her desserts are definitely not for the average American because it is not heavy and overly sweet.  In my opinion, it is the perfect dessert to end a meal in Vegas.  

What I like about Sweets Raku is that each season, they have a new set of desserts to reflect the ingredients of the season and often times rotate the popular items throughout the year.

Tea Selection - They have a limited selection of tea from Lupicia, which is a Japanese brand with very delicious fruity and floral tea flavors.  perfect to pair with the desserts.  My favorite is the supergrade oolong momo and the muscat.    

The kitchen is very cute and clean.  The bathroom, please visit the bathroom. It is so unique and quite fun to figure out how everything works.  

Service from the waiters is a hit or a miss.  Usually I request Yuka to help us since we have gotten to know each other a bit over the years of dining here.",n_UcypOj7YW8gdR43XIUSQ,1,1,5,5cOvo5YKTOXmiMhtUkgOyA

Upon arriving to Sweets Raku, I could smell the food of the nearby restaurants. Parking was a hassle and it seems that this plaza has a very high volume of traffic as customers, as well as myself, ended up parking on another street nearby. When walking up to the front of Sweets Raku, the front is very clean and modern with a glass entryway and many bottles of wine and other alcohols carefully sorted in an artistic way. The dining room was very small and there was only about 3-4 tables and then an area in which you could sit at the bar. It did take awhile to be seated, but only because this place is so popular that there were many people in line. I was unable to tour the kitchen, but I was able to snag a seat at the bar and watch all of the desserts be prepared. This was interesting because each dessert had a process that was very closely replicated each time that dish was made. The server was very helpful in describing what was in each dish and she even told me what she was doing as she prepared my desserts.
Food Evaluation:
 I chose to do the two-course dessert. The first dish was tiramisu in a small teacup. The tiramisu looked like how it should with a creamy, beige top layer (which was the only visible layer), and a small mint leaf. I could smell the strong coffee and the smell of warm milk when the server handed it to me. The taste of this tiramisu was incredible, it had the perfect balance of cream and coffee, with neither overpowering the other. This seemed to be a well-balanced dessert, it was sweet and a bit bitter. The texture of this particular tiramisu was unique. In a good way. There were small, crunchy balls at the bottom that had a chocolate flavor and there were small almost boba-like (tapioca balls) that were coffee flavored. 
 The main dessert I had was called the Ringo. It was their version of an apple pie. The presentation was very nice as it had 2 flaky, fluffy pastries with apple pie filling in between. There was whipped cream on top, a small sugar apple (which was filled with caramel and cream), and a small scoop of honey gelato. I could smell the cooked apples and cinnamon before the server even handed me my dish. The dish as a whole was very sweet, but also balanced as the pastries were salty and buttery, the filling was sweet and sour with the apples, and the whipped cream and caramel was also sweet. There were a variety of textures in that the pastries were crispy and seemed to dissolve in my mouth, while the apples were very soft and chewy. The gelato was very creamy, but did not seem too heavy, and the sugar apple was hard and crunchy with the smooth filling.",FavssEgZjXFi2unEXePkVQ,1,0,5,QVd9-1SXcZdveZC7XcBZXg

I was so excited from the moment I stepped inside. I was in search of dessert after dinner and just found this on yelp. I guess they've been open for 10 months. It's a Japanese dessert place. 

The shop: It's mostly bar seating around an open kitchen. There are maybe 3-4 4 person tables on the side. My friend and I grabbed a seat at the bar. Best spot! I went to the bathroom, and srsly, my first time writing a review about it, but it had those Japanese styled toilets. Seat warmer, fancy buttons that I did not use. I've never been to Japan, but I'd imagine this is what it's like. Best bathroom ever. haha. The place is ran by a few Japanese ladies in their 30s/40s maybe? Very pleasant/nice/smiley staff. They make the dessert on the spot for you. Everything is precut/pre-baked, but they build the desserts on demand. So for example, your cake has a few layers, so they'll put it together like they're creating an art piece. It was very cool to watch. Kinda like sitting at the sushi bar with the sushi chef putting building your omakase dinner, but w/ desserts instead! The menu is made out of edible wafer that you can later rip up and eat with this fruit sauce they give you. The sauce was good, but the menu wafer wasn't really anything, but just a fun idea! 

Drinks: They serve wine (and maybe other alcoholic beverages, didn't pay much attention) and tea! The portions are pretty small though. One pot per person in terms of serving size. We tried the apple green tea and peach black tea. Not sweetened. I liked both! 

Desserts: We decided to go with the 3 course dessert, yes after dinner already. You can either do that or just get the ""main dessert entree."" With the prix fixe, we started it off with a small dollop of mango sorbet. It was just ok. I'm not a huge fan of sorbet to begin with. The main dessert entree we tried he Strawberry Tiramisu and Angel Cake (some pear thing). There were 5 choices I think. Hard to choose. The Strawberry Tiramisu didn't really taste like what I imagined from my Tiramisu experiences in the past, BUT it was soooo good!! The little cake on the bottom was amazing. I don't have any other descriptive words to use. The side is drizzled w/ some mousse/cream? so good!! and fruits. 5 star for dessert and presentation! The Angel Cake is like 6 star for presentation! It looks like an Angel! with a Halo and White Chocolate wings. The cream on the cake was very light and yummy. The Strawberry Tiramisu was probably 0.5 stars better than this Pear one, but still very worth it and good. The third course was a cream puff with your choice of vanilla or chocolate custard and choice of fruit filling. Pretty good. If I came again though, I could do without the 3 course thing and jump right to the main dessert entree!

Prices: Main dessert entrees were $12. Three course dessert was $19. Tea was $4.50. I would say a bit heftier in price, but not terribly high and totally worth it!

Overall, I think these desserts are very suitable for the Asian palette. I can see my parents liking it. I normally do ok with regular desserts, but at times it does get heavy and rich. NOT HERE!! Everything is so light! After we were done, I felt like I could do one more (just bc i wanted to try something else), but didn't as not to be a major fatty. Check their hours of operation as it differs depending on day of the week and is a bit tricky. I will definitely come back here when in town!!",CQdE8Z4NxgX5tlMi5PTeSA,4,2,5,k59FyxRakSizUi6JMVzYJw

Sweets Raku specializes in different desserts. They had a prix-fixe of different dessert courses. My friend and I were stuffed from dinner so we split one and there's a few dollar splitting fee.

There's a display kitchen so you can see the attention to detail they put into each course and each component. They even had an edible menu made on rice paper.

Their chocolate souffle was the most memorable part of the experience.",ls9Z1mRQ9m4sYG4f-WzoUA,4,2,5,3WO4itaKBeW-2N7FQ1SGBw

The place is small with about 20 seats available. This is one of those one and done experiences so I thought the wait was OK. Servers were super nice and they explained every dish. They don't take reservations!! I suggest making an early reservation to Raku and then stopping here before the after-dinner rush kicks in.

The desserts are so delicately made and sitting at the bar, you can see it all come together! My favorite was the Miyabi! It had so many textures and wasn't overly sweet. The fire Hennessy was the best show dessert but the alcohol taste is strong so beware.

Also ordered some macaroons - must get the mango with chocolate! It was by far the best one!",9brb3jp3oZVIlL5jt4ilCA,0,0,4,ZnsxLJDQXgcooofU35gG1A

Yeah seriously I think you are just paying for the experience.  All the things they do in the open air kitchen is jaw dropping, which makes you think the dessert that will be served to you will be phenomenal. I came on a Saturday night with a friend and we waited about 45 minutes to be seated. We had dinner prior to coming, so we opted for the Ala Cart but we did consider getting the full course since you get more of your money's worth I guess. Thankfully we didn't because the desserts were nothing spectacular and to be honest they were average at it's best. I had the baton while my friend had the marriage. The baton basically tasted like whipped pistachio with a chocolate shell. No flavors really stuck out. My friend described the marriage as those cake rolls with sliced up strawberry and banana, also another dessert that was a let down. Yes, the ambiance is pretty amazing and sitting at the bar watching the open air kitchen is like a show in itself. Other than the desserts, they have everything going for them. I did hear the apple pie was pretty delicious, but unfortunately is no longer on the menu. Price is justifiable for overall experience and quality of desert, but I don't think I'll be coming back considering I can get pastries at a bakery that are better tasting and for cheaper too. I'm just glad to get this sucker off my bookmark list and say I've been here to check out what the hype was all about.",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,0,2,4,QFWu2qy5b7vJIGKCdjPW-Q

The prix fixe menu offers three courses starting with an amuse, a choice of the day's desserts, and a petit four. Wine pairings are offered for an additional $7. Prior to ordering, we were presented with an edible rice paper menu. It was a fun way of showcasing some of the thought and skill that goes into all the desserts here. It was served with a delicious raspberry sauce. 

The amuse was a strawberry sorbet with mint gelée. It was a simple, yet refreshing starter. For my next course, I got the ringo (""apple"" in Japanese), which was apple pie served with an edible caramelized apple with a side of honey sorbet. The most aesthetically-pleasing and impressive component was the apple. The flavors were reminiscent of a creme brulée with a nice candied shell protecting the cream inside. The flavorful honey sorbet was made without any sugar. 

Other main courses included the angel cream, which was light  and enjoyable. The Mt. Fuji, the most interesting of the bunch, was a chestnut cream cake that depicts the most well-known peak in Japan. It looked more like a ball of spaghetti, but the chestnut flavors dominated the dish. Our tasting ended with a mini chocolate molten lava cake with dried fruit and marshmallows. 

The unique counter seating gave a great view of all our desserts being prepared. One last note. Whether you need to use the restroom or not, check it out. The sink and faucet are one-of-a-kind.

Each time my gf and I have been here we have ordered a variety of foods which included both their savory and dessert dishes. Out of each dessert I particularly love the Ichigo. This dessert had a candy shaped strawberry filled with a strawberry sorbet and was paired with a white chocolate cup filled with their version of ""pie crusts"", sponge cake, a strawberry mousse along with what from I can taste a vanilla custard like cream. I loved that the dish had different components of strawberry flavors. I especially enjoyed the strawberry sorbet inside the candy. My gf had ordered the newest addition to their dessert menu which was the Matcha Soufflé. I enjoyed the flavors of this dessert although the souffle aspect of this dessert falls short, literally... (We both wish there was more of the mousse soufflé texture and puff to it especially if it is the main aspect of the dessert). As for the savory dishes we had the Foie Gras, Prosciutto, and Salmon Tartar. All were delicious starters/appetizers to enjoy before dessert. 

The ambience of this place is enjoyable, it certainly is a small room to only fit about 15-20 people at a time so if you don't want to have to wait I recommend planning to coming in the early evening on Thursday or Fridays. We were seated right away. Parking is pretty difficult to find in this plaza as there are also other good food places in this vicinity, there is additional parking across the street! Overall, I rate this place 4 stars, my dining experience and food here was of enjoyable and delicious quality!

3918834,2017-07-15,6,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Sweets raku is very disappointing.. I've had this place bookmarked for over a year and finally had a chance to try this place two weekends ago. My family and I came here after eating at a restaurant in Chinatown and decided to get dessert. I came at a very odd hour so the place was empty. 

The hostess only seats you when the entire party is seated. So we had to wait until the other half of my party to show up. But for some reason the hostess seated another party when only two of their party were there. I'm not sure why we had to wait when they didn't... Note: they have a $12 min per person... so you can't really share 

The desserts here look more delicious than it tastes. They have a 2 course dessert where you can get one seasonal dessert and one of the main dessert for $15. The seasonal dessert was either pineapple or mango sorbet. The pineapple sorbet was my favorite! The mango sorbet was a little sour.  We had the ichigo, rikyu, and the mars. The ichigo looked the most normal dessert but the best one on the menu! The mars had a very bitter taste because of the brandy. We had trouble eating this let alone finishing this. Not my favorite but very entertaining to watch them pour hot brandy to melt the chocolate. The rikyu was basically green tea spaghetti! Very spongy, if you like green tea, then I recommend this. The green tea sesame seed was a little disappointing.. The desserts tastes all in all was very average. The chefs do a great job in presentation, but taste could be better. 

Overall, $15 for a dessert is overpriced for me. It was a one time deal to try..",Q-jK9xcsxKFFuGM2YmuNPA,5,5,3,tso2oTFg9ziEZm_OVwfuXA
3923461,2014-02-09,5,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Maybe my expectations of this place were just too high because I love Raku and because of all the good reviews I read on here. However, having been here twice now in the last few weeks, I'm forced to recognize that Sweets Raku is mostly hype and very little substance.

Sweets Raku does have some strengths - the absolute best feature is the layout/décor/ambiance. It's a fun and cute place to be in, and the open kitchen design makes the dessert preparation a fun show. This aspect of the restaurant I do love. (And don't forget to check out the sink in the bathroom.)

Unfortunately, disappointing is the first word that comes to my mind when I think about the food. Perhaps the Mt. Fuji dessert epitomizes the problem I have with their approach;  the dish looks absolutely stunning when it is being prepared, with chestnut mousse being separated into strands and layered over cream and cake, then topped with chocolate powder and accented with crunchy wafers. But when I eat it, it just tastes like any old chestnut mousse and sponge cake. There's no depth to the flavors or texture or other sensations and nothing interesting going on. And when I visit a dessert specialist, I expect something amazing - not just any old dessert that I might get after an average meal at some average restaurant.

And that's the problem with Sweets Raku. If you don't care about the open kitchen and watching the dessert being prepared right in front of you, then frankly you're much better off heading to a gourmet Strip restaurant and getting dessert there (I know of several Strip restaurants including Michelin-starred spots that will seat you even if you're only ordering dessert, and many more will let you order dessert only at the bar, too) - and you'll pay about the same as you would at Sweets Raku, to boot.

The worst part about all this is that both times I've come here, my party has agreed that the Mt. Fuji was the best dish. If the consensus best dish is something I think tastes mediocre..... oh well. I do think that the Red Rock was a close second, although maybe only because I liked the yuzu marshmellow.

Service is also very spotty. On both visits, our courses were not paced particularly well and we were also left waiting a long time to get the check. Also, on one of my visits I had to ask twice for a hot water refill for my tea and still never got it. Some of the staff have a lot of difficulty speaking English, which could contribute to some of the interaction difficulties - and it sure makes it hard to understand sometimes what exactly we're being fed.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,5,1,2,FqnAGTEDW0EaHKKiS2ZYfA

Sweet Raku is a unique dessert experience like no other where you sit right at the bar and watch them make your desserts! It's very entertaining and interesting to watch. A great place to take a date for some added ""quality time"" and a fun place to take the family and kids to fulfill that sweet tooth!

Space is limited, so be prepared to wait if you come during peak hours (like after dinner). The desserts take awhile to make as they prepare everything from scratch...so if you are looking to order a quick dessert to-go, this is not the place to do it. This is a sit-down, watch and enjoy your dessert kind of place. Expect to be here at least 30-45 minutes. 

The desserts are so pretty and delicately made. They are a bit pricey though, so be prepared to pay $14-20 per dessert/person. Here, you are paying for the whole experience, not just the dessert!

This isn't just a dessert place. It's an entire experience. We went there on a Friday night around 9 pm. We were very lucky to have found a table quickly, but after we were seated a line started to form near the door. I recommend coming here a bit earlier or having someone visit the restaurant first because the restaurant is pretty small. 

Price: With the amount of detail, work, and the quality of the food used, it is reasonably priced. For four people, the bill came out to $54. There were also wine pairing options and a special sorbet we could add on as well. However, we wanted to enjoy the desserts just as they were. We got the apple pie dessert, 2 mars, and mount fuji. All were delicious!!! I would go back again to try the apple pie. 

Ambiance: The decor is clean and sleek. Everything is white so you can tell the restaurant takes health code standards seriously. You get to watch the pastry chef, and sometimes the owner, create the dishes right in front of you. I recommend grabbing a seat at the bar so you can see the desserts being created. There is so much love, attention to detail, and quality that goes into each dish! I understand why they are so popular. 

Food: The apple pie came with a sugar apple that has mascarpone and caramel in it. Then there was a side of honey ice cream and the apple pie itself. Be careful biting into the sugar apple pie! Our friend cut his tongue on the leaf because it was so sharp. The Mars was an interesting presentation. It was covered with a soft of chocolate that looked like Mars. When it served the server poured a warm sauce over the dish and the chocolate melted to reveal delicious berries in the middle. The Mount Fuji has chocolate chestnut with chocolate chestnut cream and a sponge cake in the middle. This was my least favorite dish, but still great. They also serve non-dessert foods, which we hope to come back and try again one day. 

Drinks: They do serve alcohol here. However, we came here from dinner and already polished a bottle of wine before coming. So we didn't get anything to drink here. If you enjoy pairing wine with you dessert, then I recommend trying their wine pairing recommendations. 

Overall, I give this place a 5-star. The experience was impeccable and I can't wait to go back here again!",kHEQu2K4TIiXdw7Onj9TIw,1,2,5,tsKleh3fFleRv_ms9P3HQg

Prices are just about right. Reasonable, in my opinion. $15 for a two course dessert meal. The first course includes a seasonal sorbet and second is any of your choosing from their menu. My boyfriend and I got two different opposite dishes. The green tea dish was super subtle. It was the traditional definition of a traditional Japanese dessert. Not sweet whatsoever vs the ichigo which was very sweet from all the fresh fruit and the syrup etc. both dishes were good and different in my opinion but honestly I think you're just paying for the presentation itself. It's a cool concept to see everything put together in front of you, but I soon lose interest after the fact of seeing everything just coming from Tupperware containers. Like everything is premade of course, and just storages away until assemble time. 

I've read it get crowded, we arrived on a Saturday evening and there was no wait but surely when we left there was a crowd starting to develop. Anyways. I recommend to go here and trying it out at least once since it was all over the internet. Be the judge yourself and see if sweet raku is worth it.

The 6 of us saw at the bar because there weren't enough seats at the tables, but hey - we got to see the artists decorate each dessert which was really fascinating. Plus, the wait for food was a bit long so we were entertained.

Sadly, there is a minimum order of $12 per person, which is the cost of each dessert so everyone had to order something. I wasn't really paying attention, but I think I heard the staff say that we're limiting in sharing too? 

***

MACARONS ($9) - Surprise! There's a center filling in each macaron!? Some of the centers were chocolate, but I think I saw red bean in the Matcha macaron (strong in flavor). 

ANGEL CREAM ($12) - This gets the Cutest Design Award. It's a heavenly dome of cream (like a cloud) with white chocolate wings and a silver halo. It looked so pure I wish I could keep it like that forever... Anyways, I ate a bit of it and was a little disappointed by the taste. It wasn't as sweet as I thought, and maybe it tasted a little too sour.

MOUNT FUJI ($12) - My favorite because I'm a huge fan of chestnuts, and how often do you get to eat chestnut cakes that's not dorayaki? It's a soft cake with chestnut pieces topped with really fluffy chocolate cream, thin chocolate bark, and thin cookies. I really liked all of it except that there was A LOT of cream. The cookie part was also very good and crispy. 

ICHIGO ($12) - By far the prettiest cake on their menu (yeah, Mars is pretty too...). It's a white chocolate cup filled with strawberry sweets and pastry bites, and a imitation strawberry (sugar shell filled with cream). I'm actually not a fan of strawberry, but this had good, strong strawberry flavor. I really liked the pastry bites too because it had a lot of layers and a buttery taste.

3974393,2013-12-31,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"For my last review of 2013 what better than to review a desserts only restaurant?  

I arrived at Sweets Raku at about 7 last night and I was the only customer for about 10 minutes.  I chose the prix fixe 3 course dessert menu along with a pot of peach tea.  I sat at the bar because I wanted to see the pastry chefs doing their thing up close.

For the three course prix fixe, you only have 1 choice--the second dessert.  The first, the amuse, and the last, the petit four, are fixed depending on the day and season.  For the first course last night, the amuse was an oval of mango sorbet with blue ice as Yuka, my server, described it to me.  It was mint jelly on the mango sorbet and it made a good pairing of flavors.

Course two I chose.  I had read the Yelp reviews and I was sure I'd go with the Mt. Fuji.  Yuka told me the Ringo (apple pie) was made that day and was excellent.  I finally decided on the Baton which was a tall thin chocolate mini-tower with chocolate and pistachio mousse and some fresh mango cubes.  It was excellent.  It was a little tricky to eat because I tried to peel a piece of the very thin chocolate tower to dip in the mousse but the tower is so fragile, it sometimes breaks away.  Regardless, it was tasty and lots of fun.

Course three, the petit four, was a delicious parmesan cheesecake with tangerine pieces.  The cheesecake was excellent.

None of the desserts was sweet which was very appealing.  It's not that I don't like sweet--it's just that it isn't needed in every dessert.  

Service was excellent!  Yuka was a gem. We did have a bit of a language problem but then I don't speak Japanese and she speaks English.  Do yourself and sit at the bar and watch the ladies work magic with preparing these delightful pastries!  

For those of you still trying to find the place when you arrive at the plaza, it's just south of Big Wong Restaurant.  Look for the wine rack through the glass windows.  At night, you won't see the spoon hanging outside.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,4,4,DEW0T0RfjaVbtXuNvbu0Qg

We had the Mt Fuji, which is interesting preparation it was good but the best was on its way Mt Charleston- this is a bomb what a desert prefect combination of flavors dancing on your palette -  sweet : sour : crunchy : salty its got it all 
I will be back here to try more of their art of dessert collection

Quote from the hubby:  ""you know what I got full from?  The MENU!

TID BITS: 
1) Sweets Raku is located in Chinatown in the same parking lot as Raku (japanese grill restaurant).  Next to a massage place. The sign is super small. 
2) $19 for a 3 course prie fixe (you get to pick 1 dessert. The other 2 are the amuse and a petit four, which is already set for the day).  $7 for one glass of wine for pairing.  $12 for ala carte desserts.  
3)  Kid friendly, however it's a small place with a quiet atmosphere.  

With a cute open kitchen, Mio Ogasawara (2013's Pastry Chef of the Year) and her assistant created our beautiful sweets right in front of our eyes.  A truly talented  team.  

The experience and surprises that Sweets Raku brings to the table is an adventure in itself.  AND I'm sure every visit is different. I won't reveal too much, so you too can be WOWed like us. 

Here are a few SNEAK PEEKS: 
1)  CARIB (coconut panna cotta). This dessert is NEW for the summer. It's SO refreshing, light and filled with tropical ingredients (papaya, kiwi, banana flambé).  A show in itself.  MY FAVE.  I'm still drooling over the melon cream. It's DELIGHTFUL. 

2) BATON (chocolate & pistachio mousse).  Did you know chocolate could be spread  thinly and baked?  You need to check out the construction of this!  
Bold chocolate flavors with a very mild pistachio mousse. Hidden surprises inside. Hubby enjoyed this dish...for the chocolate lovers!

3)  CREAM PUFFS (our petit four for the day).  Sounded boring at first. But, pretty darn good.  We got to choose our cream and jam.  Puffs were airy and crisp. Creams were light (not sweet); I liked the strawberry.  You can taste the fresh fruit extracted to make the jams.   

-PRESENTATION AND EXPERIENCE: 6 stars!
-TASTE: 4.5 stars.  Desserts were not  too rich or heavy (which is a good thing).  Was hoping the petit four would be more  unique. 
-SERVICE: Friendly! Make sure you hang onto your dish until you are completely done.  One gal had a tendency to take the dish away too soon.  She actually took away my menu, when I wasn't done yet.  She brought me another one without question  (to eat!!). 
 
YOU GOTTA CHECK OUT THE BATHROOM.  I laughed and stayed giddy the entire time in there.  It's quite the experience.   

Have fun!  This place is a MUST TRY.",loXavxKqdcIgrQeX1GSWUw,9,10,5,tSD6WVrsFqHwWWsTvAKBwA
4015523,2014-04-14,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Why does this place deserve 5 stars? Because it's an experience you won't forget.

From the moment you walk into this stark white establishment with cool decor to watching the pastry chefs prepare your 3 course dessert menu (if you don't go a la carte) to using their funky bathroom, this place is just very unique. I can't compare it to any other place.

I got the pre fixe menu ($19) which comes with AN EDIBLE MENU that you dip into a raspberry sauce, an amuse and petit fours for just $7 more than getting is a la carte. I picked the Mt. Fuji chestnut cream cake because I was so mesmerized by the way the chefs were making it. It looked like ice cream spaghetti. But it was cream...which was good, but it definitely would have been better if it was ice cream.

My husband chose the Baton which had chocolate and pistachio mousse over a chocolate sponge cake and red wine sauce. The outside was made out of a thin chocolate layer. It was beautiful, really hard to eat, toppled over, and attacked. Taste wise, I thought it was better than the Mt. Fuji.

The Sorbet amuse was a good palate cleanser but the cream puff petit four was seriously so amazing. The cream puffs were heaven. I barely took a pic of it before it disappeared into my mouth.

Of course out of all these things, the most impressive was the edible menu. As soon as they present it to you, you know you're in for a nice treat for the rest of the dessert experience. Could it all have tasted better? Yes. But because it was a unique experience that just makes people happy, I think it deserves 5 stars. I dare you to bring a sour puss in here and see if he/she doesn't come out with a smile on his/her face.",m3FleKsUG-1UNqJsJZid9A,5,3,5,Gndke6UZlhjZfAuY4UfbZw

It is sweets and a show watching the ladies work. 

I would recommend sharing the tasting. We had champagne as well and the 3 courses plus the bubbly would have been way too overwhelming for one. It was perfect to share.

I love the concept. The kitchen is beautiful and contemporary. They're very organized and meticulous.

Definitely try sitting at the counter ""bar"" area to watch the action. Watching them use the different tools and equipment and technique was probably better than the actual dessert course. 

I think the service needs some working out also.

Also the pace is super slow! Really how long does it really take to 1st course: scoop out some sorbet and ass champagne garnish and 3rd course: heat up a premade cream puff? 

They could really do themselves a favor by adding another server, adding a host or hostess, or something. Either I went on an off night or I'm just missing something.

The girls tried to be sweet and tried to explain everything well but it didn't work for me. There was so much inconsistency with service. 

Example: how about explaining the edible menu before the first course is almost coming out?

The sauce they serve with the rice paper menu is awesome.

I liked the price for the prix fix 3 course dessert tasting. I liked the desserts. I like the restaurant itself.

Small bar like area. With some seating. Large wine storage on the way in. Staff was friendly and mostly consistent with seating and host execution. 

There is a minimum dining charge per patron. It's like 20 something. Staff provided that before getting us started.

 We came in solely for dessert. Between the five of us we ordered the two course, a main dessert and some macaroon. I don't really recall the name on some dishes. We just didn't care much for the one with shaved grapefruit. It was a bit tart. 

Another was the Berry sorbet mint  Jello. The dish served as a palette cleanser. It's a different mix. Little sweet and little savory. Texture. Gets the tongue to think a bit before getting to the entrees. 

Sunset was one of the entrees. It had a mix of fresh fruit, cream, chocolate. This was my favorite. A balance of 

Otherwise everything was masterfully thought out. Presentation and arrangement of cakes, pastries, cream and fruit. Not your typical desserts. 

The macaroons we took home. All sweet. Held well for four days. The crust delicate and crunchy. The filling was rightly stuffing Asian flavored. One tasted like matcha and another was like red bean. Five flavors. Aromatically appealing.

4045349,2014-03-01,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"What a fun experience! I highly recommend it to anybody over the age of 8 or so.
First of all, the ambiance is super cool. Is this what it's like in Japan? Not sure, but I like to think so. It's a small room decorated all in white, with about 10 seats at the 'bar' where you can watch a few of the desserts being made, and about 10 table seats. Warning: there is no signage! It's located between Kabuto and a massage place.
The food menu (which is edible!), includes a 3-course prix fixe option or a 1-course option. The drink menu has an extensive selection of champagne and dessert wines, but unfortunately, these are all quite high-priced and there are very few by the glass selections. In addition, you can order from a wide variety of teas and several types of bottled Japanese water of various ph's. We tried the 'bicarbonate' one, which is supposedly for athletes. I could taste a slight difference from the tap water, but I'm not sure if it was worth $4!
On to the main thing, the desserts! They were all delicious. Our amuse was a white peach sorbet with sparkling wine jelly and it was sooo good. Usually peach-flavored things are cloyingly sweet, but this was so light and delicious! The small beads of sparkling wine jelly perfectly complemented it. I could have eaten about 10 of these.
For our 'main' dish we had the 'angel' (cookie with pear gel on top and covered with a pear foam) and the 'red rock' (raspberry molten cake with vanilla ice cream and yuzu marshmallows and some other stuff!). The angel was really good - light, with just a hint of pear - but the red rock was awesome! Seriously, I usually don't like 'molten' cakes because they're goopy and too sweet and the cake part is heavy, but THIS.....this was so good. And of all things, the yuzu marshmallows really stood out! It was disappointing that we only had 2! Our last dish was the cream puff. It was good and all, but small, and nothing too special.
I would highly recommend everybody check out Sweets Raku at least once - it's a perfect date night! Add a bottle of dessert wine and you could even skip dinner! At $19 for the prix fixe menu, it's definitely more than you'd spend on typical dessert, but it's perfect for a special occasion.
So why, you may ask, do I not give it 5 stars? Simply because it is waaayyyyy......toooooooo.....slllllloooowwww. Seriously, we were there over an hour! I appreciate that every dish is made by hand as it's ordered, but could you maybe hire another cook back there? At a pace like that, it's not really even good for kids. Ours held out to the end, but we ended up scarfing down the cream puff in 1 bite each since it was way past bedtime by that time.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,0,0,4,pcBwG4GeXVJ1nXIY3G-v6A

4059072,2014-09-03,18,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I heard so much about this place that after dinner at Japanese Curry Zen in the same strip mall (Seoul Plaza), we stopped by Sweets Raku.  SR is located West of the 15 on Spring Mountain Rd.

As the name indicates, SR specializes in desserts.  However, they do have savory items on the menu like foie gras torchon ($18) & caviar ($30).  We shared the three course Prix Fixe that comes w/ an amuse (mango gelato), your choice of one of the desserts of the day:  We chose the baton (chocolate rolled dough) filled w/ pistachio & chocolate mousse, and a cream puff filled w/ chocolate cream.  The price is normally $17, but because we shared it was $24 (O_o).  In addition, we ordered 5 macarons for $9 to go.  The meal starts whimsically, because the menu is edible and they give you a raspberry sauce to dip it in.  Unfortunately, the menu reminded me of a communion wafer, and was apros pos for the remainder of the prix fixe.

The amuse tasted good:  The mango flavor really stood out.  But it wasn't worth the average of $8 for the 3 course prix fixe:  2 Stars.  On the other hand, the second course tasted very good (especially the baton).  The baton had several layers and the fillings were very flavorful:  4 Stars.  Lastly, the third course was pretty bad.  There wasn't much too it, and the portion was tiny for the $8 average price:  2 Stars.

BTW, we tried the macarons the next day, and they were OK.  They were not as good as Bottega Louie's, and definitely not better than Bouchon's:  3 Stars.

Our waitress Yuta was super nice.  However, the courses came out very slowly.  Additionally, we noticed several guests were turned away because of a wait vs putting them on a waiting list and asking them to return:  3 Stars.  The ambiance is pretty cool.  There is an interesting spoon out front, there are tins of tea on the wall, and wine bottles in a dope display case.  However, this place is very cramped.  Its best to sit at the bar to see your creations being made:  3 Stars.

IMHO, this place is overhyped and appeals primarily to females - Including my yf Dani S.  But she didn't notice me cos she was on a date.  In any case, my date looked better than her, so Dani would have been mad!  - LOL!!!  In reality, there was only two guys on a Sat nite, and the place was packed).  Nonetheless, I won't be coming back.  I am not sure what raku means, but they are running a ""rakut"" here w/ the high prices for mediocre food.  I would have rated this place Two Stars if the service wasn't good.",o1_sfJ71nrq5QrF00v3Icw,20,17,3,EzvfoClqpQXVbQyUqurXyg

4072730,2014-07-11,4,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"In a word.... NOPE! 

Katie M's review was EXACTLY how i felt about this place after i read it on my phone after departing from this place. Of course i noticed all the good reviews first, and i am a little disappointed and find it hard to believe that this many people really think the flavors and execution here was worth the money and hype. 

Here is a hint for people going that are planning to share the pre fixe menu it says that its $19..but if your sharing then its $24. Your better off getting two of the main desserts at $12/each and not taking the 1st and 3rd items from the pre fixe given that they are not large portions or really anything special. Same money but you get more for the money.. 

I don't want to repeat the same thing that few others have said... yes the place is clean, yes the desserts ""look"" nice, and its a nice concept...yada yada. But the flavors just do not jive, and in some cases it seems there is just too much going on to really appreciate the dessert. 

What i will add that not others have said is that i don't see the passion in this chef when making these creations one bit. Im very big on taking my business and money to a place who really enjoys what they are offering to their customers, and although the presentation is lovely, i don't see the chefs heart in the finished product. She is not very delicate, nor interactive at all, and i wasn't even enjoying watching her work since the look on her face wasn't as if she was even enjoying herself. She looked more of like an assembly line worker who was just ""going through the motions"" and throwing something together to get an end product and not a work of art or beautiful creation. I wanted to like this place... but it falls far short as i have easily had better desserts for a 1/4 of the cost and from a restaurant and not a dessert specific location like this.",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,6,0,2,jaK-HiTSbP_NhThbn6K3sA
4075734,2016-11-07,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Adorable little place tucked away in the back corner of a pretty packed plaza. It's a bit off the strip so definitely quieter and less hustle and bustle. Luckily, I went with a party of 4 as soon as they opened. We still had to wait about 30 minutes, but considering how small the place was, the line moved pretty fast. They had 5 main desserts on the menu, of which we ordered 4. 

Ringo (5/5): Originally we weren't planning on getting this one cuz it sounded just like an apple pie, but I'm so so so glad we did. It was one of my favorites of the day. Everything about this dessert just worked. There was a small apple pie with tart apples and a crispy, flakey, buttery crust. It was paired with a honey ice cream that was so delicate, but so fragrant. Together, the 2 were a match made in heaven. And as if that wasn't enough, there was a small candy apple on the side that was filled with the lightest whipped cream and a caramel sauce. It was a fun play on apple pie and salted caramel apple pie. This was definitely a crowd favorite because seconds after it hit the table, we were all essentially fighting to lick the plate clean. 

Mars (4/5): This dessert was both fun to watch and fun to eat. The server used a blowtorch to eat up some alcohol, which she then poured on top of the little red dome of white chocolate on our plate. Inside was yuzu mousse that paired perfectly with the white chocolate, brandy, and fruits inside. It wasn't too sweet due to the alcohol and the yuzu which added a hint of tang, bitterness, and freshness.
 
Primavera (5/5): My other favorite of the day. This didn't look as beautiful as the other desserts since it was assembled in a wine glass, but the flavors made up for it. The coconut panna cotta inside was so good. Not too sweet, but you could definitely taste the coconut. It went so well with the strawberry sauce and the fruits inside. This was super refreshing. I recommend trying to dig your spoon all the way to the bottom and grabbing a little bit of everything in one bite to get the full effect of this one. 

Mt. Charleston (2/5): Sadly, we did not enjoy this dessert as much as the other ones. I personally wasn't a fan of the lavender. It was a bit too floral for my liking and didn't work well with the sweetness of the meringue. Overall, the dish was a bit too bitter and the components on the plate didn't mesh together. It left a strange aftertaste in our mouthes. 

All in all, I would definitely come back here to try more of their desserts if I'm ever in the Las Vegas area again. 

Cons: 
- Skip the Mt. Charleston
- Gets super crowded if you come late
- Hard to find parking
- Super small interior

Pros: 
- Amazingly well thought out desserts 
- Cute interior (love the tea tins on the wall and the giant wine cooler)
- Great service and friendly staff",iw7k_JJhDn8PkV9w-aM_ww,1,0,4,Y-xgWsVmco52PjN5FfPbsA

I have been there twice already, and they've only been open since August 6.  I was there a couple of days after they opened and they even gave me a dessert bag to take home!  I went a second time with friends from Boston and New York and they enjoyed it also.  The guys in Boston are jealous that there's no place in Boston like this.

The place is pristine white.  If you go, try to get a seat at the bar so you can watch them assemble your desserts.  Yes, desserts.  Three courses that they tell me will change seasonally.  They are flavorful without being overly sweet.  

I was speaking to the manager and she told me that getting a seat is easier in the daytime.  When it gets busy in the evening, expect about a 30 minute wait.  30 minutes is acceptable for such a unique dining experience.

The service and ambiance is so warm and inviting. The white counters, tables and china are expertly designed to compliment the colors and flavors of the desserts. Even the menus and items on it are carefully thought out to have that wow factor. I think the $19 Prix Fix is perfect! A cheap cup of factory made gelato is $10 on the strip and Sweet Raku desserts are made delicately by hand to order!

My first visit order consisted of:

*Strawberry sorbet with mint jelly- lightly sweet with a great texture contrast with the jelly.
*Ringo (Apple in Japanese)- a strudel like apple dessert with lattice top. Served next to a ruby red sugared apple filled with caramel and cream and perfectly sweetened honey ice cream! Superb!
*Chocolate lava cake with rum raisins and berry/passion fruit marshmallows!

I ordered the cherry tea which came in the most perfect tea cup with cute tea pot. This helped compliment and add contrast to the meal although water would probably do just as well. I love their tea cups!

This was an amazing experience! I was here for about an hour. Perfect wow moment to bring friends or a date. I also like eating at the counter so I can watch the process and the small detail the chefs add to make each plate edible art.

This place is hard to find if you are not familiar with the area but it is located in the Monta/Big Wong parking lot and has a small sign that says Raku outside.  There is the Raku restaurant and Sweets Raku which is the dessert restaurant.

The Ringo is their take on a deconstructed apple pie with a side of ice cream and an candied ""apple"" filled with a pastry cream.  
The Jack in the Cup was a chocolate cinnamon souffle with a side of ice cream.   When the desserts are served, they are presented and each component is explained much better than I just did, but unfortunately I don't remember the details.

When you sit down, you are given an edible menu with a sugar ribbon. Don't eat it quite yet because they will give you a yummy raspberry plum sauce to dip it in.

Luckily we must've hit an off time because we walked in and we're seated right away.  Don't get me wrong, it was almost full and after we sat down, the line started to build outaide.

So you know, it's located in a very small shopping center with limited parkimg, and just like walking in we were lucky someone was just leaving as we were pulling in.  And there are 2 restaurants named Raku.   There is no ""sweet"" listed above the restaurant, but look for the wine bottle wall you'll know you have the right one.  the other Raku serves Japanese food and not these scumptious desserts!

It is small, so seating is limited and part of the reason a line builds.  I wish I had sat at the bar to watch them create these beautiful desserts.  Each one is made when ordered, not all sitting in a refrigerator.

Yes I ordered 3!  would've ordered 5 but I need  reason to come back with my girls...  My hubby had dinner here with me for our anniversary.

It's a small place, we waited for about 25 minutes, seats around 25 people, which I think is brilliant. Creates demand with a shorter supply. We both get 2 full course meals, differing in the Mars and Primavera (plus I got the wine pairing).  

We sat at the tables and the raspberry sorbet was awesome!  Then the Mars and Primavera came out individually and I liked both.  My girlfriend was ""so-so"" on the Mars but ""loved loved loved"" the Primavera.  My poor rating explanation for why is as follows:

My complaint and giving them 2 stars were as follows: 1) there was a piece of plastic bag wrapping in my Primavera dessert! That really ruined my experience. I tried to think what it could have been, and I surmised that it must have been the piping to transport the cream/sauces into the wine glass.  Anyways, totally made me disappointed and ruined my meal.  I mean gross, for the prices I expect quality.  2) my wait staffer was a bit quiet and we could not hear his explanation of what the dessert were.

4172668,2017-01-31,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"The desserts here are both artistically beautiful and deliciously decadent. You can visibly see the time and care that all the chefs put into each of these pieces of art, and understand the price (which is so much better than anywhere downtown). The themes of each dish stand elegantly and surprises like the Mars dish are just wonderful.

Now, the reason for the 4 stars revolves around 2 small problems that my party encountered.

1) Even though the cookies are sitting out in baskets and seem like they are free for the taking (especially since they do not have prices listed anywhere), DO NOT TAKE THEM. They are $1 each, and considering that some are just as simple as an Italian wedding cookie (3 ingredients and little to no preparation required), and all are not very large sized, this is an extremely high price point to punctuate the end of your evening (like my group did). Just feels like a kick in the gut to receive a check for something you thought was free after having paid your check.

2) I know that space is extremely limited and seating is at a premium with first come first serve, but to be rushed at the end of the evening and shooed out by the chefs after having paid over $100 just for your meal feels a little insulting. I could understand if we continued to remain long after our deserts, but if the party has just finished the hostess/chef should never ask them to immediately leave so that the seats can free up. It's rude and certainly insensitive to your customers.

Again, a wonderful experience and would love to do it again, but will certainly cut back on the purchases and hope for better service on the next visit.",c6NCd2ogdPkF-GRqwEuUOA,1,0,4,gQ8T0GylI2_st0UTB0Uz9Q

.:: Stressed is Desserts Backwards ::. 

Spring Mountain $12: **my fav one out of the three we got** pistachio cream cake w/ strawberry & raspberry mousse on top of chocolate cake w/ pie crust. The mousse was stringed through like noodles and gave the dessert a kick of texture. The taste was creamy and light, yet bold in flavors. Everything combined together was amazing. The chocolate cake was moist. 

Ringo $12: apple pie served w/ honey ice cream & candy apple. The apple looked SO shiny, once you crack it there's a filling inside that tasted like cream. The honey ice cream was super refreshing. The ""crust"" that the apple pie was served in was a bit too dry for me. 

Mars $12: yuzu mousse & chocolate cream w/ hazelnut & assorted fruits covered w/ white chocolate piece flambeed w/ brandy. I didn't enjoy this as much because the Hennessy they poured in overpowered everything. We didn't taste anything but the strong Hennessy which we unfortunately do not like. 

.:: Ambiance/Service ::.
Very clean cut, elegant, and chic. They have a long bench with chairs along side of it where you can watch the chefs make the pastry. It was quite the experience. The restaurant fits about 20-25 people.
THE RESTROOM. The toilet was pretty cool. My friends were playing with it the whole time haha. You press on buttons on the side to flip the toilet seat up or down and play with other things. My friends were in there for a good 10 minutes playing around :p. The sink itself was pretty cool too. It looked like a well with a faucet. 
The service was pretty good. Everyone was quite friendly especially our hostess.

Yet the server was a disgrace to this place. The menu clearly dictates that there is a minimum of $12 per person. However, in my case I have a dairy allergy. I was hoping that either the souffle or macaroons were dairy free like in some restaurants do. Unfortunately, none were dairy free and only the sorbet was my option. It is winter time and I was not craving anything cold neither alcoholic drinks. My friends placed their order and I ask the server to give me a sec. I was thinking of ordering a tea but the server came over and ruined my evening. She said to me: ""if you don't want the 3 sorbet option I recommend for $12, then it is okay because we are slow. But if we are busy next time you can't stay unless you purchase because you are taking up space"". 

I have worked in the restaurant industry for 10yrs. I would have never said such thing to a customer, specially when they have a food allergy. Not even when the customer is part of a large group which all are purchasing more than the ""minimum"". I was extremely disappointed in the service.

4272273,2016-03-24,4,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Want to feel like you've been cast in your favorite Japanese anime? Sweets Raku is the perfect place to go. Every thing about this place is kawaii. 
Sweets Raku is a Japanese dessert shop next door to the restaurant Raku (yes, they're different places. Don't accidentally come in here thinking it's the restaurant- like so many people do). It's brightly lit with most of its seats being at the counter (3 tables off to the side). If you want to watch your dessert being made get a seat at the counter! They don't take reservations and the restaurant is small so plan ahead. 
The desserts can be ordered by themselves or for an extra $3 (total $15) you can get a bite of the most amazing sorbet you'll ever have. The mango sorbet tasted like a creamy, iced mango. The Haagen Dazs mango sorbet I've loved for years now tastes artificial and lacking. Thanks a lot, Raku! Warning! if you're vegetarian the sorbet comes with some mint jelly on top! 
The Carib, or the chocolate melting wine glass dessert you see on everyones snapchat, is a fruit and mousse dessert. The dessert was prettier than it tasted. In other words, take pictures of the one your neighbor orders and order something else for yourself. 
The Mt. Fuji (Or if you want to be a show off order it as 'Fuji-san' ;)) is a chestnut cake. Momburan, as it's called in Japan, is not very sweet and has a pretty nutty taste to it. It's my FAVORITE. The momburan at Sweets Raku is the best I've had in America and decent compared to the ones I've had in Japan. 

Obviously take your time to eat, but it may not be the best place to hold your 2 hour long conversation with your best friend that you haven't seen in years. It gets pretty crowded and you'll probably get a lot of stink eye from those standing directly behind you waiting for your seat to open up. 
If you're staying on the strip and are wondering if it's worth the taxi ride.. YES. YES IT IS. There are plenty of ""cheaper"" restaurants to have dinner at so that you can splurge a little on dessert in the area.

This time around I wanted to take my boyfriend for an anniversary treat. I had called ahead and asked if they had anything specific for a a special occasion and the lady on the phone said there was nothing specific but they would gladly from a nice message on one of the plates. Fine with me because the whole experience was already a treat. I didn't tell my boyfriend where we were going. So I made sure we had a small meal we shared together. 

On an early Sunday afternoon, the place is not busy at all, and only 1 other couple seated. PERFECT! An opportunity to let my boyfriend see all the dishes as he orders and not observing someone elses. I HIGHLY suggest to come in on an odd hour for better seating. As we walked up, he was so confused since there is no sign advertising the name of the location. We walk in and he's surprised at how this little spot could make such an impression! We sit down and our server greets us. We can barely understand her but she tries and we appreciate her kindness. Our edible menu's are served and I tell my boyfriend to take a look and then a bite of the menu. He's loving it!

We decide to let him order the Prix Fixe 3 course serving, and I would do one dessert. We are definitely are wine people and we added the wine pairing for his prix fixe and I would have the ""Wine Flight"" Here's what we ordered:

His Prix fixe ($17)
Course 1: Mango mandarin sorbet with raspberry jelly. 
Course 2: ""Stella"" Strawberry Tiramisu 
Course 3: Creme Puff with chocolate ice cream and raspberry currant. 
Paired Wine ($7 extra): A small glass of Semi Sweet Rose 'N Blum Red Wine

Ala Carte ($12): ""Red Rock"" Raspberry lava cake with pistachio ice cream and spun sugar. 
Wine Flight ($7): 3 iced tubes of wine samples: white wine, red wine, dessert wine. Served with a small dish of 2 cheese samples and a sun-dried tomato

Tasting the Wine Flight where we discovered a new wine we love!-""Tokaj Classic Aszú 6 Puttonyos (2000)"" I know this is a dessert wine, but it was perfection...

The entire experience was worth it. This is a great location for a handful of people or a one-on-one date. What add's to my interest about Sweets Raku is that they constantly change their menu. They keep their menu so limited that they can do this. And it has me wanting MORE.

4337403,2018-02-21,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I never would have thought to venture off the strip to try a dessert place in Chinatown, but my friend suggested it. My first thought was ""$12 a dessert?!"", preposterous. As you can tell by my rating however, my mind was changed.

It's located in a sort of strip mall with a private lot that fills up during peak hours. Inside is small with seating for about 20 people. There was a small line that weaved out the door. It took about 15 minutes until our party of four could be seated, which wasn't bad at all. I liked the entire look of the place. Bright, clean, modern. We got lucky and snagged counter seats, which are the way to go. You have prime viewing of the dessert makers in action. They aren't at all engaging or interactive except when they hand you your dessert. They just look like focused robots doing their thing.

Now every person must order a dessert. That is a rule, I happily obliged to. These are what we tried.

Mars - an absolute show stopper presentation. They heat up the brandy with a blow torch then pour it carefully over the red, chocolate dome that ignites and slowly shrivels away to unveil the inside yuzu cream and hazelnuts. It's quite a spectacle, however, this was my least favorite flavor wise. The brandy was too overpowering.

Ringo - I was the most excited to try this beautifully presented dessert. You crack the delicate apple shell and the whipped cream inside is light and airy.  The flaky apple pie pastry is crisp and the honey ice cream is subtle.  

 Pearl - I think this was my favorite dessert out of the four.  It comes with a white chocolate clam shell sitting upon chocolate mousse and a shiny pearl.  The pearl holds the most delicious passion fruit sauce that goes well with the chocolate and banana/pineapple compote.  

Jack in the Cup - Basically a chocolate soufflé but it's cool that they serve a light milk sorbet on the side.  You see them back it for about 10 minutes or so then when they deliver it to your seat they inject the soufflé with cinnamon cream, which makes the dessert rise up.  Another very ""wow"" presentation.

Overall, I'd say these desserts are more impressive and delicious than a lot of high-end restaurants for a similar price.  They serve some savory items and tea and coffee too but just make sure you don't come here without trying their desserts.",YhUhjDc1HdEyne6A8izSvw,5,4,5,prpGnjN3KkfCAIAeV1L7Ag

Just a heads up because first time I ever went I was confused if the GPS took me to the right place and couldn't find it immediately.  Ok now that is done, this place is such a wonderful experience! They don't just have desserts, but also have appetizers, quiches, and sandwiches.  I have had the crab quiche and the salmon croissant, I prefer the flavors of the croissant I had the best.   The salmon is cooked perfect and has a great sauce, nice greens, and ikura!  Both came with a soup and dessert.  I got the lobster tomato soup each time, it's served in a tiny cup and so yummy.  Salad is greens in a light citrus dressing and potato salad.  The desserts are wonderful to watch being made, and if it's someone's birthday they will malwnit extra special.  I have had the red tiramisu, and the Carib served in the big wine class.  My favorite was the carib it had so many flavors and textures that meld together into something amazing!  The foi gra pate is also amazing and I highly recommend it.  Their bathroom is pretty cool, but I do wish there was a purse hook, and while the sink is cool it kinda splashes every where.  The restaurant itself is super clean, modern, and fresh.  I can't wait to got again!

I felt a little guilty for holding them up but they were very nice and gladly sat us down, offering us their coffee and other drinks menu. There were a few other couples in the middle of their meals, so it wasn't an awkward closing time. They are pretty popular so it makes sense that they would have stragglers coming in so late (it was almost midnight). 

SERVICE: Quick, fun, friendly. When I told them neither my boyfriend nor I have ever been to Sweets Raku, their eyes lit up as they presented us their EDIBLE menu and explained to us the rest of their sweets on the menu, including a three-course dessert.

FOOD: We decided to skip the three-course and go straight for the main dessert course. We quickly chose the Marriage dessert choice and the Apollo dessert choice. Let's start off with Marriage: Dominate in the strawberry and shortcake flavors, with some kind of strawberry-raspberry gelee and an edible golden flake atop the banana pudding in the centre of the masterpiece. Apollo was mostly chocolate chocolate chocolate, and I was okay with that =) now for the best part of the desserts.... THE EARL GREY ICE CREAM! It came perched above three layers of strawberry and chocolate mousses and chocolate cake. At first we thought it was a Fruity Pebbles Ice Cream (it really really REALLY tastes like fruity pebbles), but they told us later when we asked. 

Bill for a large cappucinno and two delicious main course desserts, with a $10 tip came out to almost $40.

Not only did it serve as talking point, but we also learned more about some interesting techniques.  This was not all just a gimmick as the taste backed it up for the most part.

We had the Soleil and Mt. Exotic as part of our dessert sets.  The process of making the Soleil was a sight to be seen.  It was slightly citrusy and not too sweet.  I highly recommend it.  The Mt. Exotic, on the other hand, was a disappointment visually.  It just looked messy, and a bit too sweet for my taste.

I had the soufflé (I can't remember the name) with the berry mousse. It was pretty good. As you can see from the photo, mine didn't puff up.

It's gotten busier over the years, so be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes (depending on the time you go) due to limited bar and table seating.  But I'm glad to see that the quality and service is still the same as my first visit.  They usually give out edible menus with a fruit dipping sauce because their menu is constantly changing.  During my last visit, they provided a paper menu with pictures and a short description of each.  I personally like the menu with pictures so I can see what the dessert looks like, rather than just envisioning it with words.  

We tried 4 out of the 5 desserts that they offered:

Carib:My absolute favorite!  It comes in a glass and tastes tropical and fruity, very refreshing for the Vegas heat. 

Ringo: Like a deconstructed apple pie

Mars: They heat up Brandy to pour over and melt the chocolate.  I wasn't a fan of this due to the heavy alcohol taste

Puffy Cup:Like a blueberry souffle with a mango puree on the side

I recommend ordering the wine flights. Although places in Jell-O shot containers, it's enough to taste their parings with the cheese. I wish they told me what cheese was meant for what wine. But I kind of figured it out. I thought it was interesting that their Pinot noir was placed over ice. But when I sipped on it, it was like a dessert wine. The Chardonnay was actually much less sweet than the red wine.

Also the place is absolutely TINY so if the place is full you're kind of SOL.  Went there with a group of four and the place was full.  They don't have a waiting area so you have to just stand in the entry way which can be uncomfortable.  Luckily a group left not too long after we got there so we didn't have to wait too long.  Sitting at the counter is definitely the way to go as you can watch them hand craft each dessert to order.

I ordered the Ringo, which is pretty much an apple pie a la mode, but elevated into a work of art.  The ""apple"" on the place is some sort of edible candy filled with cream and caramel I think.  My wife had the Mars.  I have no idea what the candy dome is made out of but when they serve it to you the chef heats a small tin of brandy I believe with a torch until it flames.  Then they pour it over the dessert and the dome melts away to reveal the cream and fruits underneath the dome.  Very cool.

Each person is required to order a main dish, which costs about $12 individually.  So, I ordered the Mt. Fuji combo, which includes a sobert, and a dish called Mars.  When I walked in, I received no greetings and one of the staffs actually ignored me when I tried to talk to him, which initially gave me a bad impression about this place.  

Highlights:
1.  Both dishes looked pretty.  But the taste was just ok. 
2.  The staff can look cold and mean at first, but they are warm once you get seated.
3.  Tiny space for waiting, and they did not provide any seats either.

5.  The restaurant is clean and they have food other than desserts!  
6.  Highlight of the review: the bathroom is very clean and decorated with awesome designs!

Overall, I think this place provides a nice presentation of the desserts.

Unfortunately for us, once we were seated they told us their Ichigo and Mars were sold out (our first choices of course). If I knew that before walking in, we would've gone somewhere else. Ended up opting for their Mt. Fuji and Angel Cream. Both had the same assorted fruit base and weren't as rich as all the pictures made them look.

So I will be honest. I'm definitely a bigger fan of savory than sweet. Not exactly the biggest sweet tooth... I can, however, appreciate delectable sweets every once in a while.

The ambiance here is... White. Bright, white walls and small in size. There's bar seating and a few tables for seating. I imagine the most Sweets Raku can hold is 20 people or so. 

I sat at the bar with a friend - I ordered the Caribe, my friend ordered the Mt. Fuji, and we shared some macaroons. We also tried the wine flight where a few samples of wine were selected by the pastry chef (to pair nicely with our desserts). All. Of. It. Was. Delicious. 

Presentations were highly impressive and the servers went into detail of each dessert. 

- Macaroons
Order came with 5 - vanilla, red bean, lemon, green tea, and coffee/mocha. Macaroons are usually too sweet for me but these were superb. The vanilla was my favorite!

- Caribe
There was a lot going on but I enjoyed every last bite. A dessert concoction with mango and coconut flavors presented in a large wine glass. Creamy coconut panna cotta goodness and bananas along with other fruits and goodies. There's a thin candy lid placed on top of the glass and they pour a mango syrup which melts right through!

-Mt. Fuji
Mousse hazelnut with hints of chocolate. Very creamy. I didn't have too many bites of this but it was very smooth and sweet! 

- Wine flights

They were already out of their most popular dessert (Mars), even though they had barely just opened for the night.  They said it would take another hour so we opted to order the Angel Cream and Ichigo.  I preferred the Ichigo (strawberry dessert).  Both desserts were surprisingly not very sweet - not that I like my desserts cloyingly sweet, but this was a little underwhelming.  Presentation is nice and creative, though.  For the starter, we had a sorbet and a pomegranate slush.  I liked the pineapple sorbet but not so much the slush, which again, was not very sweet at all.

I was lucky enough to have found out about this place via a Facebook video.

For a weekend, the wait wasn't the worse I've experienced. It was probably a good hour wait. Seating is limited to about 4 tables and 13 bar seats. Whatever you do, it's totally worth it to sit by the bar. The bar offers the whole experience of watching the chefs do their magic. Videos and pictures sweetly welcomed. 

In addition to sweets, they also have some snacks and lunch. But who comes for those?! 

Lots of drinks offered. Tea, coffee, wine and beer. I opted for a Momoko Iced Tea. They carried the brand, Lupicia, and it comes in many different varities. 

For desserts my boyfriend and I shared:

My Favorite, Mars: ""Creamy Yuzu mousse with hazelnuts & milk chocolate crisp mix deliciously trapped inside the red chocolate dome and flambéed with brandy.""

His Favorite, Primavera: ""Sorbet & Mousse paired with fresh raspberry and strawberry in a cup.""

Presentation definitely wins. I mean, who doesn't like to see things melt? The flavors work well together and it's not too sweet. Sweet Raku is a pretty nifty treat.

I know they had a soft opening and I called to confirm they were actually open today and my luck its their grand opening today!  So we pulled into their plaza and drove right past because I was looking for a sign! No sign but the people standing outside let me know something awesome was happening! We walked up to a red carpet entering the dessert restaurant and was greeted by a server and the chefs. We were able to sit with an awesome view at the bar watching all the magic happen. 

We were handed the drink menu which consisted of coffee, cappucini, iced latte/americano, and an AWESOME list of hot teas. We went with an iced latte, iced americano, and a cappucino. We were then given our menus wrapped with a sugar ribbon. I actually ripped my menu pulling it out! The server let us know it was a pre fixe menu consisting if 3 courses amuse bouche, dessert, and petite four. There were 3 desserts to choose from the marriage had sponge cake, strawberry mousse, banana custard, fresh strawberry, fresh whipoed cream, fresh banana, white chocolate, and gold leaf. The Apollo which was chocolate and raspberry mousse, custard, chocolate sponge cake, earl grey ice cream, crispy chocolate rice square, a meringue stick, and dark chocolate. We didn't try the third because my mom and grams shared. 

After explaining the menu and ordering the server poured raspberry sauce on our plates and told us we could eat our menu! 

So our coffees were awesome! The ice is made of espresso and they gave us simple syrup to sweeten it. Our amuse bouche was mango sorbet with mint jelly. The sorbet was smooth and soft no ice crystals at all. And the jelly worked perfectly without overpowering the mango. Our main courses were fantastic!!! Not too sweet and although there were many components they worked together! 
The mariages banana custard was to die for! And the apolos earl grey ice cream had the great lemony/bitter note to set off the sweetness of the chocolate and raspberry. 

Our last course was a cocolate soufflé. Served with raspberry and passion fruit marshmallow. It was more like a lava cake but still amazing. It wasn't overly sweet and when you combined the souffle and marshmallow it was a perfect combo!

So a little tip- you are able to share for $12 for the 2nd person. So $31 total. You recieve 2 amuse bouche, one dessert, and 2 petite fours. Not too bad. 

It was $69 for the 3 of us so a little steep but we had an awesome time and the show, the flavors, and all of the small details made it worth it! I will for sure be returning!!!",JfnY0VcP63s5RF1sfOHjBQ,3,2,5,mOFFnZNYTEHy24BoT5aXQQ

The soup that came with the lunch set was so good.  Green salad with potato salad was also my favorite.  Japanese potato salad tastes different from home to home but the one served at Raku Sweets was made exactly the way I love!  I'm not a huge fun of onion slices in it, but they were well treated and prepared.  Not overwhelming taste of onions.  Just gave the right taste to it.  

The sandwich I chose was with bacon and cheese.  I didn't think my baby would eat salmon.  The croissant was crispy and buttery.  Pieces of basil and sun-dried tomatoes added good accent and some acidity.  That being said, the combination of bacon, cheese, and croissant was a bit too greasy for my taste.  

Mt. Fuji was good but not the best Mont Blanc cake I've ever had. I prefer stronger taste of chestnut in the cream.  I loved the strawberry cream on the side of Stella the most.  Refreshing yet sweet.  I wasn't too much fun of the base of Stella.  Had nice caramel taste but was too heavy for the light cream for me.

Mango sorbet was very good with strong mango taste.  The puff was crispy but by that time I wasn't too interested in sweets.  

My toddler enjoyed the whole experience, especially eating the menu.  Her expression was certainly worth a million. 

I recommend the lunch set on Sunday.  They may also have it on Saturday.  The set with a la carte desert is only $20.  Well worth it!",5a_eQcyqpO2HvWY6Y6krvA,0,1,4,1F1epjaEBNYK63xATtn0RA

this haven away from the strip provides delectable treats in a modern, artistic setting. you'd be hard-pressed to even remember you are just doors down from Ozzie's Poker Bar.

slick white tables and walls hidden behind stacks of some of the best top-of-the-line champagne. the storefront is logo-less so just look hard to find it right next to the italian japanese restaurant.

$19 dessert prix fixe - worth it. don't be like me and bypass it because you think ""it's just dessert"". at Sweets Raku - it's not JUST dessert.

$12 individual entrees if this tickles your fancy. not the traditional sickly sweet desserts either. everything is well rounded in flavor and acidity and so shockingly beautiful, you won't even want to eat it. don't worry though, you'll get over that sensation quickly.

the Marriage is the fluffiest of sponge cakes with a banana custard, whipped cream, and strawberry sorbet (?? - didn't taste like sorbet, but sure looks like it). look for the banana.. it's there, and it makes tons better.

the Mt. Fuji is a masterful concoction of chestnut. chestnut. chestnut. and more chestnut on top. but so subtle and light, it doesn't even feel like you're digging into a beautiful mountain of cream.

yes, the menu is edible. don't be like me and eat it alone though. wait for your raspberry sauce. so yumm. I ate it all. no shame.

4557815,2015-03-22,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"So let me start off by saying this is one of the coolest places i have ever stepped foot inside in my life as a diner, and so uniquely imaginative! It has the flawlessly sterile cleanliness of a prestigious hospital expertly mixed with the delicate coziness of some passionate cook's home kitchen. More succinctly, i felt like i walked into a murikami short story about what japanese heaven looks like.. And tastes like!

Now, with the scene set (although you will actually have to go yourself to either understand or believe it) i can tell you about the experience...

So what we did was we opted for the pre fixe menu ($15 dollar two course dessert tasting) which consists of (course 1) a seasonal sorbet which is made with such care and still that it not only seamlessly melts in your mouth, but melts your heart , and (course 2) a dessert of your choice from five options on the menu. 

Now i was lucky enough to go with 3 other people so we all got to taste a little bit of everything so i can tell you that you honestly cannot go wrong in what you pick. You will be satisfied. You will be amazed. 

So then, after they give you a tour of the menu (one of which is printed on edible rice paper and served with a fruit puree to dip it in! Yes, Seriously!!), and you order a cup of the peach mo mo tea (which you should), then they proceed to make your desserts fresh, one at a time, right in front of you! It takes longer than at most restaurants, but if you don't have the patience for true craftsmanship, then you probably wouldn't appreciate it anyway. 

Anyway i wont ramble on much longer because, as i said, it is not an experience that words can do justice... But i will finish by saying that they have the best bathroom that i have ever had the privilege of using so make sure you take the time to tour it. 

Seriously, a 5-star doesn't even seem to come close to describing the outstanding service and experience i received here.

Upon entering, I noticed that there was only bar seating and 2-3 tables available. So arrive early or random hours to avoid the wait. I waited for a good 30 minutes on a Saturday afternoon around 1 pm. 

I think you would have guessed that I ordered the Ringo. 
This dessert plate was basically a deconstructed version of an apple pie. 
The apple filling and honey ice cream were perfectly sweetened, but the main attraction was the sugar shelled apple that was filled with cream and caramel or chocolate. YUM !

My buddies ordered the puffy cup (souffle) and the spring mountain (cake), they were not too sweet which I liked  but  personally I did not like them because both were raspberry filled. 

Since I was seated at the bar, I was able to watch the pastry chef at work.Hopefully she wasn't too creep out because I was starring at her make these works of art. It was actually really entertaining to watch.

The wait is definitely long to get in because the restaurant is pretty small. It's mostly bar seating with a few small tables. I definitely recommend getting bar seating because that's where you can see all the desserts being made, which is the best part! Overall, we waited about 45 minutes (an extra 15 min because we wanted to wait for a seat at the bar and not sit at the table).

The desserts are super unique! We got the Ringo and the primavera and made each one a combo. The combo is $15 with your choice of a main dessert (ringo, primavera, etc.) and sorbet. The sorbet was mango with mint toppings on the day that we went. It was really good and fresh. The primavera is somewhat like a parfait with tons of layers of creams, cake, and toppings. When they present it to you, they cover the cup with a wafer of chocolate and they pour a cream sauce on top and it makes a nice visual display as the chocolate melts into the cup. You can definitely taste the richness in all the flavors and it was more tart than too sweet. My absolute favorite though was the ringo. This dessert consists of a flaky croissant topped with an apple pie filling, honey ice cream on the side, and a candy apple that's filled with cream and caramel sauce. It was amazing!!!! The pasty was fluffy and warm and so good. All of the elements melded well together so that the dessert wasn't overly sweet and overpowering.

The staff is attentive and provides a great dining experience. 

Main desserts are $12, but opt for the combo for $15 which comes with a smaller dessert which will vary each time. Me and my bf each got the combo. I recommend everything I got. Check out my videos for how the dessert looks like. 

Mars - white chocolate half ball dome paint in red to look like planet Mars. Within the white chocolate dome is fresh fruits. The staff will light a shot of Hennessy on fire and pour it over the dessert where you can watch it melt and crumble in. The Hennessy will leave a slight bitter taste but the fruits will balance it out. 

Coffee sorbet - flavorful and comes with coffee jelly. Served in a small espresso shot cup

Primavera - must get. Coconut panna cotta with fruits served in wine glass covered with a chocolate sheet. Staff will pour a raspberry sauce over the sheet and you can watch it melt into your dish. 

Raspberry sorbet - flavorful and refreshing.

I mean, one could only assume that it's possibly an IG photo stop or over sugared treat for those w the tastebuds of a 5 y.o. Despite having overeaten at our meal just minutes prior, we ordered a few items: 

:::: Tokio and Paradise Green teas ::::: 
you get a pot of tea so we each had a cup and swapped pots so we could sample both -- about two cups in each pot

::::: Cream Puff :::::
5$ light, airy custard w a strawberry sauce. Best cream puff either of us had tried

::::: Ringo :::::
Apple pie w honey ice cream served w an apple candy that you can break into filled w whipped cream and caramel sauce. Though this one was slightly sweeter than the cream puff, the dessert was so unique and delicious. Definitely try it if its available -- if just to crack open that metallic, shiny apple. It's oddly satisfying breaking into something so pristine lol

Sooo good and a great experience, despite the painfully slow service and our excessively full tummies. I don't know if it's cause there was only one lady servicing the bar and tables but don't come starved cause everyone will get a lil grumpy. This place is SMALL and combined w the slow service I can easily see it getting backed up and require a wait. 

The good news: it's in Vegas where there's an abundance of land so parking was free and easy in the plaza. Whooooo! 

I rarely say that I'd go back to eateries in Vegas cause I don't go there enough for that but I'd be down to be back if someone was craving sweets -- and assuming someone had a car cause it's way out in the boooooonies of Chinatown. 

Hopefully they'll have their green tea/black sesame thing on menu next time. Makes me drool just thinking about it mmmmmmm",ydIdyGQyO8eZe0yqgs0DfA,39,39,5,4LEQrizye4z8KTbfUW1TEw

Luckily, we came on a Sunday right when they opened and snagged the last 3 seats at the bar. Caution: this place is TINY. 

No doubt that all their desserts looked awesome, but surprisingly, their savory items sound delicious too. Even having just eaten lunch, we couldn't resist ordering a set meal to share.

Salmon Croissant Sandwich - MUST GET. Grilled salmon and salmon roe (for a pop of salt) on buttery croissant. Comes with a mini cup of hearty tomato soup (wish I could get a full bowl of this) and green salad (with a mini side of potato salad too!). 

After that, we each got the 2 course dessert, which all come with a mini tiramisu ""sorbet"" with coffee jelly, foam, and cereal puffs. This 1st course changes from time to time. The 2nd course, we decided to each get something different so we can try as many as possible.

Mars - White chocolate half ball dome painted in red to look like the planet Mars. Within the dome are fresh fruits. The staff will light a shot of Hennessy on fire and pour it over so you can watch it melt and crumble in. The Hennessy will leave a slight bitter taste but the fruits balance it out.

Mount Charleston - A sponge cake covered in a mountain of flambeed meringue. The middle layer had a weird taste to it, but everything else was good, including the fruits, chocolate sorbet, and more cereal puffs for crunch.

Primavera - Pretty presentation in a giant wine glass with lots of fruit and panna cotta in the middle. Topped with a thin layer of chocolate, which melts into the glass when the staff pours warm chocolate over it. The dominant taste is strawberries / raspberries.

In additional to all this, one of us did the wine pairing, and I did a separate wine taster, which had 3 different wines served in test tubes and came with a mini cheese platter. So cute!",9IX2jJzDNvODLA9EzSKV5A,3,3,5,lgE7BiupCYyhtQaOCh3xnw

We didn't feel like waiting for a while for a seating at the bar, so we settled for a table. Upon entering, we didn't really get greeted which I found weird. 

Anyway, they have a pretty good selection of desserts! They also have some finger foods for lunch, I think. We opted for the 2 course dessert - costing $15/person. The menu had wine for pairing with the dessert & coffee. 

The first thing that came out was the mango sorbet with some mint jelly? It was really good & refreshing! Next came the main dessert of your choice, I picked mt. Fiji (I think). You could really taste the chestnut! Super light & just the right amount of sweetness. My only gripe about my dessert was that it took a whole 10-15 mins AFTER my siblings already got theirs, so they were already done eating by the time mine came out.

Tucked in the busy and crowded plaza of like twenty other shops and restaurants, I had to park across the street one time and managed to find parking only in the actual plaza once during the weekend. There is usually a wait in line because the space is small and there is limited seating. I would not recommend a large group, but party of one and twos are your best bet. Some table seating are available, but the bar side is usually available.

The decor is very detailed made with little tiles that are the same as the utensil holder. Cute purse hooks that look like doggy tails. Impressions are very clean and culinary artful. Desserts are best with a multi course so you get to try more items in one setting. Their deconstructed apple pie with a candy shelled whipped cream filling is lovely. The orange ice cream hollowed out and filled with raspberry sorbet is delightful. Portions are just enough, not super tiny and definitely not huge. Just enough to leave you satisfied and hit that sweet tooth after a good meal elsewhere in the plaza. 

This is a sit down and relax dessert spot though, so don't expect a super fast-ice-cream-scoop and go spot.

Chef's Special Appetizer ($9): Strawberry Raspberry Tart, Macaron w/ Raspberry Sorbet, and Dark Chocolate Ganache. The tart was fantastic. Prefect crust and custard under the fresh fruits. The macaron had a wonderful chewiness, but the sorbet was awkward and it was a race to eat it before it vacated the cookie. Also, the sorbet was extremely tart, borderline unpleasant. The ganache was wonderful - I loved the texture and the semi-sweet flavor.

Mount Exotic ($12): Mango-flavored Mont Blanc w/ Mango Sauce. Beautiful dessert (obviously). Delicate cake topped with whipped cream, mango cream, lime zest, and fresh mango. Raspberry sauce and thin pieces of chocolate complement the dish. Every element was great and I loved the lightness.

Soleil ($12): Orange-flavored ice cream, mascarpone, and Piquant Cassis mousse. Besides being really delicious, this dessert made to look like an orange with an edible ""stick"" and leaf. This was my favorite dessert of the bunch.

Prix Fixe ($15)
1. Coconut Sorbet w/ Gelée. Fluffy sorbet, gelée tasted like sweet wine. Fun treat in an espresso cup.
2. Carib: Coconut Panna Cotta, tropical fruit medley, hot mango sauce poured over tropical mousse and cantaloupe sherbet.

Menu- a scroll of rice paper with a pulled sugar ring, with a raspberry sauce dip.  
First course was a strawberry sorbet with mint gelee. 
Second course you get to pick 1 of 5 choices. Though the waitress described all the desserts quickly and thoroughly, I could only catch a few words here and there. But she had such enthusiasm, that I didn't want to make her repeat herself. 
-angel cream: light, airy, not too sweet, lots of cream, mango pieces buried beneath, wings of white chocolate, and a halo of pulled sugar. 
-apple pie: a little too sweet for me, fun to eat, lots of components... 
-mt fuji: looked like spaghetti with mocha flavored crisps, had a mature taste, would go great with hot tea. 
Third course was a petite four: chocolate molten lava cake with dried fruit and fruit flavored soft squares. I don't know how else to describe them.. but it was good and I finished the whole thing..

Wait: It depends on what time/day. The first time I went was a Friday afternoon. The wait was about 30 minutes. The second time was also on a Friday but at 9:30 pm. It took about 15-20 minutes this time. When we were leaving around 10:30 pm, there was no wait at all. 

Parking: This is a small strip mall with many famous restaurants/shops. It may take a while to find parking or might need to do street parking. 

Food: It's worth the wait! Besides the fact that these desserts are Instagram-worthy, the presentation is amazing. I felt that I was eating an artwork. 

""Pearl"": Chocolate Mousse with caramelized pineapple and banana. White chocolate shell and a pearl candy with passion fruit sauce inside. The taste was good. The chocolate mousse wasn't too rich (which I like) and it went well with the pineapple and passion fruit sauce inside the pearl candy. It was a good balance between chocolate and citrus-flavor. 

""Jack in the cup"": Chocolate shuffle with caramelized banana injected with cinnamon cream. Served with milk sorbet. To be honest, I was skeptical when we ordered this since I am not a huge fan of cinnamon. It proved me wrong. It wasn't too sweet and the cinnamon added a kick to it. 

Value: $15 for 2 course dessert. For the art and creativity, it is worth the wait and money.

No more edible menu :(
Two courses now instead of 3. Starts with your choice of champagne of sorbet and then your dessert. 
If you want the cream puff ending you can still get it a la carte 
More lunch options in the afternoon 

My biggest highlight and by far my favorite dessert to date and why I am writing this today is the freakishly delicious apple pie. I kid you not I was so full but wanted to order another one. I have had cravings ever since. Perfect flaky crust. Yummy warm filling. Honey ice cream. The sugar Apple is filled with whipped cream and caramel. Delicious!

Me second favorite is the caribe. If you like melon and banana and panna cotta, just a perfect creamy topical flair. If I did not try the apple one first this one would have been a top contender. If you are on a date or just the two of you I am doing you a solid. These are the two you want. 

I had the Mt Fuji. Actually did not like the chestnuts taste. I guess I am more of a hazelnut person. Also they had sunset but the wine slush was quite overpowering. So good but not good enough for me.

You can choose if you want an a la carte dessert or do a set which includes 2 things in it: sorbet and a main dessert from the menu. I ended up getting the 2 item prix fixe which I chose a blueberry champagne sorbet and OMG best sorbet I've ever tried. The blueberries were hidden underneath so after my second bite I had a taste of it and my boyfriend said my facial expression changed dramatically and looked so surprised [in the good way]. For the main dessert I chose carib which has a beautiful presentation. The dessert comes in a wine glass and then there's a thin flat piece of chocolate over it which is then melted off when they pour some liquid thing over it. My boyfriend ordered the ringo which is like an apple pie. Great crust and super tasty. I'd recommend this dessert place for anyone looking to impress their date or is looking for something with great presentation. They make it all in front of you too so you get a little show.

What a treat this place is from the mundane dessert cafes/patisseries. The 3-course dessert prix fixe option for $19 is a wonderful assortment of treats, and show(wo)manship in one. Majority of the seats are around the counter right around where the dessert-istas make your sweets. It's fun to watch them prepare each masterpiece using very specialized pastry tools.

For the prix fixe option I had a pineapple sherbet with wine jelly, a choice of 5 desserts options from which I chose a chestnut Mt. Fuji pile, and a creme puff filled with berry jam and chocolate or vanilla cream. The menu is also edible and they come by and squirt some apricot (I think) syrup to dip the rice paper menus into. I loved this. What a break from the typical!

The waitress in Raku proper hinted that they change up the menu offerings frequently, so don't expect to see the same a few months after this review. 

Other pieces that make visiting Sweets Raku pleasing are the environment. The servers are friendly and perky, in a nice way, and greet and say good bye to customers in Japanese. 

There are many ""gems"" within the restaurant awaiting your notice and enjoyment. My favorite is the artwork of planet Earth with illustrated idiosyncrasies of each country. Fun to look at and acknowledge what was called out for each. Raku and Las Vegas are clearly called out on the art! I also loved looking around the kitchen and seeing all of their tools, and collection of All-Clad pots, and utensils. Can you spy the taste-finger spatula??

I won't write about the bathroom too much, but make sure you step in. It's a serendipitous experience in and of itself. ""I think I'm turning Japanese. I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so.""

They also offer teas and cocktails. I ventured into a green tea, Tokio, which was very nice and had a sweet aroma. Didn't pay too much attention to the alcoholic drinks. 

Enjoy!!!",dYJPAlkQx_K7WVfbg3aj7A,0,0,5,Y4Fpu2Cc10ECGBTIQ2QEIg
4846789,2014-10-15,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"While planning for our Vegas trip, my friend told me about this fabulous desserts place where even the menu was edible!  It sounded straight out of one of my dreams and earned a top spot on the itinerary.  Sweets Raku, sister restaurant to Japanese restaurant Raku is located in Las Vegas' Chinatown and doesn't take reservations.  

Nine out of ten of us chose to order the prix fixe 3 course menu for $19 and the latter chose one main dessert a la carte for $12.  The fancy dessert shop also offers wine pairings, but I selected a black peach tea to accompany my desserts.
  
My amuse bouche was a pineapple sorbet that was to die for.  It was amazing.  The other half of the group received a fig sorbet which, let's just say, was not to die for.
     
For my main dessert, I had the Mt. Fuji, a chestnut cream cake topped with layers of chestnut cream.  It was unusual to look at, but once I took a bite, I knew this was the stuff dreams are made of.  The light taste of the chestnut was delightful and the sponge cake was soft, airy and perfect.  

However, next time and mark my words there will be a next time, I will order Stella, the fairest of all strawberry tiramisu.  With its beautiful presentation, you won't want to cut into it, but once you do, it will be sure to be one of the best desserts you have ever experienced.  

The final course was a cream puff served with petit fours.  I practically inhaled the cream puff and its delicious light vanilla cream.  The pastry chefs at Sweets Raku are amazing at creating such beautiful and delicious desserts.  This was definitely an extraordinary and unique experience.

They change the menu every week or so and have a choice of around 5-6 different kinds. You can order them as a two course or just an individual. We all ordered a different one without the two course. 
My friend had told one of the waitresses that it was my birthday but she brought out the wrong dessert with the candle because she said my other friend and I looked alike. It was okay though. 
I thought the dessert I chose had the best flavor compared to the other 3 my friends got. It's called the Carib and it was a panna cotta with melon ice balls and a mango type sauce that melted the white chocolate that was placed on top of the cup. Everything worked very well together. 
The apple strudel was interesting. I wasn't so much into the strudel but the sugar blown apple with cream and caramel inside was really cool.

We would had been able to sit down 10-15 minutes before if two parties didn't do that.  Also, in my opinion for anywhere there are people waiting in line for a table.  You order, take your photos, eat, and pay your bill and get out!  LOL, simple as that.  There were some people sitting and chatting, drinking refills of water.  It's disrespectful.  

They do have a lot of great selection of dessert wines.  I had about 6-7 of the ones they have on their list.

4893894,2013-12-16,6,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"After dinner desserts with friends on a Saturday night. We wanted to try this place because of all the great reviews that people have been posting. It was a bit confusing finding the place, since there is another restaurant in the same lot with the name, ""Raku"". There was a line to get in when we arrived, so we ended up waiting about 15 minutes or so. Ask to be seated at the counter, so you watch them prepare the food.

Edible menus - ok, cute. After looking over the menu, decided on ""pre fixe"", since one of my dining mates recommended it.

Pros:

- Great presentation of the desserts; so 'artsy'!
- Clean, almost sterile appearance
- Clean restroom with a toilet that has a proximity sensor (opens automatically)
- Friendly, smiling staff

Cons:

- the price: $40+ , (gratuity is automatically tacked on), for dessert for 2 people (no drinks) - WHAT??? Ok, I see gold flake in some of the desserts that were served to us. Does that make it worth it? Well, It looked nice, but I was still hungry when I left. I don't remember anything particularly special about it. Plus my wallet was a little lighter.
- Ok, restroom was clean, but it took me a few seconds to figure out which object was the sink. It looked like a barrel of some sort.
- I could barely understand what the server was saying (see below). Perhaps they should use pictures?
- It kind of feels like you're in Japan... in a bad way, which means, it is small and cramped, and feels over-crowded.
- Get a sign, for Christ's sake! I know the giant spoon in the front is a visual cue, but how many people know to look for that, and how visible is that from the street? It's like going to a rave in an undisclosed location. You won't know that you're there unless you ask one of the other people waiting in line to get in.
- If you are lactose intolerant, cross this place off your list. It seems like everything made here is made from milk.

Summary (IMHO):

Bang for the buck?? Nope. Not here. Not to me at least. Hey, that's great that they can get away with charging almost $20, for something that I can probably figure out how to make at home for less than $10 and still have second or third servings.

Came here with a group of 4. I suggest sitting on the bar if you have a small party so you can actually watch them make the dessert. All of us got the dessert set for $18 and it's an additional $7 charge if you want a dessert wine to pair with it. The dessert set includes a starter sorbet of either mango or raspberry and then the entree dessert is any of the $15 desserts. My friends got the mars and spring mountain and I got the Carib. Both sorbets were really good and I couldn't choose which one I liked the best. For the main dessert, I would say the Carib was the best out of the 3. It had all types of flavors to it and each bite was really good. I loved the sorbet and the different items in it. 

Service was ok. They did forget to bring my wine so I had to remind them. The one that she recommended was wayyy too sweet!! I did not enjoy it at all. I believe it was the Jackson.

Upon walking in, you wait in line.  Once you are halfway to the front of the line, a staff member gives you a beeper to let you know when you will be seated.  This type of wait list is way too confusing and inefficient.  I can only assume the problem is that they do not have enough beepers to hand out to everyone so you have to wait in line until the beepers can circulate as diners leave the restaurant.  To solve this problem, a simple sign up sheet would do the trick.  

The GF and I waited close to an hour to get seated.  We sat at the end of the counter, so we managed to get a little privacy, and at the same time, had a great view of the pasty chefs at work.  We decided on the dessert set, which consisted of an amuse for each of us, the primavera, and a puffy cup.  The amuse was delicious.  It tasted like a creamy, frothy, jello.  Even though it was so small, it packed a ton of flavor. 

 Next we tried the primavera.  The presentation was worthwhile.  We saw them making it, and it clearly takes a lot of work to create this dessert.  There are so many layers and toppings.  The dessert itself was just okay.  I thought it was overly sweet, even though  there was some tartness from the sorbet and fruit.    

The puffy cup came next, which was a light and airy souffle.  It was very delicious.  A small dish of mango and jelly was served alongside it.  I tried pairing it with the souffle.  I did not really notice any change in flavor.  I did however, think they tasted good on their own.   

I would recommend giving this place a try.  The wait may be a bit strenuous, but all in all, it was worth it.",RQqfT8WQlmFHmPp9X8G9jA,1,0,4,TQigsLZnJn1gOI9GCjLY6w

The inside was very cute, it was very clean, and the open kitchen and watching these pastry chefs do their stuff was great.

It is a pricey place, with small fancy show like desserts. So, if you have a huge appetite and wanna come here, bring some dough!",GLFFf8XbOoRJuxZxGfUd8g,5,3,4,nyEJ8bXtvhCMajvJqwSK6g
4924683,2017-02-27,6,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"It pains me to give this 'ok' rating for Sweets Raku when I was the one who told my boyfriend that I desperately wanted to come here. I learned of Sweets Raku through social media, their creative and different-looking desserts intrigued me. My boyfriend was also curious and wanted to go. So we watched videos on how certain ones were made and did research of what exactly we wanted. It was a point to come to Sweets Raku during our trip just so we could experience it.  

On our visit, they did not have ANY of the desserts we planned on ordering. The Ringo and Primavera was not on the menu. I was so disappointed. There wasn't even an 'edible' menu. I had no idea this was going to happen. As I'm writing this review, it looks like their website is updated and current right now....but it wasn't when I checked earlier this year. Maybe I just have bad luck coming at a time when Sweets Raku decided to change their menu.

We were told that a new dessert Ichigo was a replacement to Ringo, so that brought my hopes up a little and we ordered that. I didn't care for the other desserts, but we wanted to get one more so I just decided on the Angel Cream because the description sounded like a safe dessert with ingredients I would like. We also got some teas to help with digestion after eating the desserts.

ICHIGO - A white chocolate shell filled with strawberries, cake, and mousse. There's also an imitation strawberry that's made of a sugar shell filled with sorbet and more mousse. We enjoyed watching Chef Mio make it. She was so delicate with her hands and the end result looked perfect and too beautiful to eat. However, all this dessert tasted like was strawberries. I love strawberries, and so does my boyfriend but I guess we were expecting something different from this. The imitation strawberry on the side was fun to crack open and eat. I really liked the sorbet inside, that gave a tangy taste and it saved this dessert from having too much sweetness from the strawberries. 

ANGEL CREAM - A dome of fromage and pear cream with white chocolate wings and a 'candy' silver halo. This was really light and creamy which I liked. But it looked and tasted too simple. Nothing to be WOW'd about. Honestly, I wish I had gotten Mars or Mount Fuji instead for a better presentation.

So we paid $12 for each dessert. That's a lot to spend on something that just LOOKS GOOD. Seriously. The desserts are not worth anything else. Taste is mediocre and we were saying there are better looking AND tasting desserts at our bakeries back home where we live. Seems like Sweets Raku's had amazing desserts in the past, and that's how they garnered all these high Yelp reviews - but I feel like they are getting lazy and less creative. The desserts on the menu now are simple and not as complex as before. 

If you don't like eating much and just want to spend money on pretty presentation and visuals, come to Sweets Raku.",29XxHvrJAyvuRaPXu_h-QA,15,19,3,P108y0IG9fIoIr0ez-MqcA
4926737,2014-11-18,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"In addition to this being a really a great and fun experience, the desserts are amazing! I took a friend here for her birthday after we chowed down some kbbq, not sure what to expect. It's pretty small, but luckily we got two seats at the bar. There are also a few tables away from the bar, but you don't want to get stuck at one of those because you miss all the action of the dessert chefs at work.

We ordered red sangria, and then shared the 3-course menu, which came with a mango sorbet, an ""entree"", and a cream puff. For our entree, we opted for the strawberry shortcake. 

First of all, the sangria is one of the best I've ever tasted. It had a ""creamsicle"" aftertaste, which may seem strange but was actually totally amazing. The mango sorbet tastes like frozen mangos pureed then frozen and somehow turned into sorbet. It was so crisp and smooth all at the same time. I could've gone for a couple more servings of that. It came with a mint jelly that did not taste like mint at all, but more like sour apple, which paired beautifully with the sorbet.

Next came our strawberry shortcake. I had told our server we were celebrating a birthday, so the chefs personalized it for my friend and everyone sang happy birthday to her when they brought it out. It was so nice of them. This dessert was TO DIE for. Seriously, the shortcake is perfectly spongy and the cream that came on top of it is smooth and subtly sweet. This dish also came with a delicious strawberry sorbet. 

Last but not least, the cream puff came and we had chosen chocolate as the cream filling. They cut it in half for us and we promptly devoured this in 10 seconds flat even though we were stuffed. Everything was amazing! The service was great, the food was great, the experience was great. Definitely recommended for anyone with a sweet tooth looking for a fun and unique experience.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,2,2,5,mZh-QIztxY2wXNSgb5bkMw

4937672,2018-01-05,2,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"When in Vegas, you must visit Sweets Raku at least once in your lifetime, especially if you have a sweet tooth like yours truly. 

Food: 
I came in with the mindset of sharing one dessert between several people.  Just know that there was a minimum requirement of 1 main dessert per person. They had the option of a 2-course dessert, in which the first course was a seasonal dessert and the second course was one of the main desserts on the menu. Pay an extra $7 to include wine with that. I have to tell you that the presentations were phenomenal and unique; and everything was edible even though you might question it based on looks alone. 
~Crème brulee: This was one of the seasonal desserts of the 2-course. Highlight was the crispy top. It was on the small side; more bang for your buck if it was larger. 
~Mars: A dessert with a red outer coating, representing the planet's color. Bust out your cameras/phones for this one because you will want to capture the pastry chef flambéing the collection of brandy via blow torch, inducing an eye-catching flame; then pouring that over the dessert, melting the outer red covering and uncovering the mousse, chocolate cream with hazelnuts/fruits. The bitter taste was slightly overpowering because of the brandy, so I could not appreciate the sweetness as much. 
~Ichigo: That strawberry candy filled with strawberry sorbet was adorable on the plate. The white chocolate cup had a small open window, giving a preview of the content inside. Simply instagram-worthy and delicious. 
~Pearl: One of the popular desserts - they ran out of this on my first visit. Essentially a chocolate mousse cake topped with a seashell made out of white chocolate. My favorite was that shiny, white pearl candy bursting with fruity juices 
~Macaroons: I had the 5 pieces. They were soft and readily crumbled in my mouth. The fillings were delicious. I even had these for breakfast during our trip. 

Décor: 
On arrival, there was a large, glass display of stacked wine bottles. Turning around the corner, various round tin containers of tea were attached to the wall. Wrapped, assorted gift bundles, some including macaroons, were placed on a shelf below ready for purchase. Two types of seating areas: regular tables/chairs versus high countertops/stools. If you do not have small children with you, I would highly recommend sitting at the counter to maximize the experience and be part of the action. I was able to watch the pastry chef assemble my dessert, literally piece by piece. It was quite a sight to see all the strawberries blow torched. 
~FYI: you must visit the bathroom - I'm going to refrain from saying anything or giving any spoilers, except that it took me 5 minutes to figure out how to wash my hands - embarrassingly hilarious~ 

Service:
Make sure that you allocate amble time for desserts. These pastry chefs take their work very seriously, and focus on meticulously fine-tuning every detail of their intricate masterpiece. Bring plenty of patience as the delicate components of the dessert will require time.",Apwv9r-1TXGoJmUo6Ye2Qg,9,7,5,5k0B_LKf1-fJMH4ECQHZcA

After all this time, I've finally had the chance to try this location with friends after our dinner at Ramen Hashi. We didn't want to be the basic Asians and have milk tea and boba next door to ramen, so instead we came here because we've all heard great things about it.

We were greatful we called ahead to get a table of 8, so it seemed it was meant to be! We rushed quickly to get there so that the table would not be taken. We arrived not even 10-15 after we called and was seated at our table when we all arrived.

All 8 of us did the dessert course menu, three of the 8 did their red sangria to share while the other 3 shared their wine flights. For me, I typically do white, but friends opted to do the red. It was nothing to rave about nor was it disappointing. 

We all started off with a green tea creme brulee. Very delicate flavor with a very crunchy top. The only thing to complain about was it was an amuse bouche. Haha. It definitely whet my appetite for the dessert to come. 

Personally I ordered The Pearl. Visually it was stunning, don't get me wrong. Flavor wise, it was okay. I'm a sucker for white chocolate anything, but the dish didn't really quite sing to me. The chocolate mousse that the ""pearl"" and white chocolate ""scallop"" shell was sitting on was just okay. I've tasted way better chocolate mousse from CRAFTkitchen's offerings. 

Sadly, I envied my friend's Ichigo. The creme inside the strawberry chocolate shell was fantastic! The components inside the white chocolate cup were very harmonious: sweet and tart. Reminded us of a strawberry shortcake. 

My other friends ordered the Carib to share. Interested with the melting of the white chocolate by pouring the passionfruit sauce over it. Panna cotta was okay. Once again I hate having to compare to another restaurant, but once again, it was just meh (other place previously mentioned does better tasting panna cotta). Summer flavours during winter is just lost on me. 

The most disappointing dessert of the evening was the Mt. Fuji. All things regarding this dish and leading up to it were all the disappointments of the evening.
1. All of the table enjoyed our desserts instead of everything coming together all at once. My friend waited the longest out of everyone. Must be because I'm just spoiled and have seen desserts plating in the past in a convention setting. If the desserts are made a la minute, I won't hold them against the timing review. But I know pastry chefs can freeze this type of dish in advance and pull out a certain amount per day and just do the chocolate shards last minute.
2. If the servers were able to gauge the table that we would be sharing desserts and knew their menu, then it would stand to reason that this dish would be the first to be served first because of the delicate flavors that would get lost and did get lost after everyone tried the Pearl, Carib and Ichigo.
3. We informed the server and it was just an ""Awe, I'm sorry you didn't enjoy it"" response with nothing to offer something else, even a small bite. With that kind of reaction, I was not very impressed with their customer service. If that was their way of just trying to get us out of the restaurant because there were about 5 people waiting at the door and none of them wanted to sit at the counter? Well it worked and to not waste money we all helped him finish it.

First impression of the place was not the best because I've waited so long to come check them out. I will still return to try the Mars if it's still on the menu. Also I will still follow their social media for any new menu desserts coming due to the seasonality of the place. However, it won't be a pressing matter the return to this place where I can enjoy from across the street the Asian dessert parlor (I can't recall the name) right next to Curry Zen where I know I will enjoy the dessert fully. But yes I will still return.",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,1,1,3,VNG5P7cXtMyahOhUcvtWfQ

Filled with sleek shiny tables of white and a bar table that wraps half way around the open kitchen, it's truly one of a kind. 

This inviting desserts bar welcomes you with an edible menu with a bright interior, great for food photography. The desserts were executed perfectly and everything I tried was palatable. 
They offer a la carte and pre fixe  set dessert menus to pair with wine and tea. Love it! They do not take rsvp so it's first come first serve. Thank goodness they are open late. Love that the desserts are not too sweet.

Dessert pairing with alcohol? Yes, and thank you please! 

The service was attentive but did not pair well with the overall ambiance. I need to revisit to see if it was just an off day.

The desserts are beautiful and creative. If you're lucky like I was, you will meet the pastry chef and watch her prepare your piece of art.

What was ordered:

Edible menu - paired with coulis sauce
Stella - Strawberry Tiramisu - Love
Angel Cream (Fromage Pear) - This was sooo good! LOVE LOVE!


What you need to know: 

-- Reservations are not accepted - Walk -in only
-- They are open late and only in the evening

4974883,2013-08-15,3,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I'll join the hype! 5 star for this unique dessert experience alone.

We hit up Sweets Raku during their opening week - specifically on Friday evening.  It was about a 30 minute wait for our party of two.  We were already invested, and decided to hold out...especially if we were going to be seated at the counter.  (This is the place you want to be seated at, by the way.)

The menu is prix fixe at $19 - you get an Amuse, a Choice of Dessert, and a Petit Four.  You can only share with another person by adding either another entree (Choice of Dessert) or an Amuse and a Petit Four.  We opted for another Choice of Dessert.  An additional $7 if you would like to do a dessert wine pairing.

One of the things I love is the attention to detail and care.  Even before we were seated, the staff are certain to make sure everything is in place before they will allow you to sit down.  The hostess was bent down on the floor sweeping with a dustpan even!

Besides the obvious water bottle display as soon as you walk through the door, it's actually a wine cellar if you can believe it!  They didn't expect to get their liquor license in time, so they filled it up with the different color labeled bottles of water in the meantime.  But ultimately, it's supposed to be displaying wine. 

The waitress hands us a menu wrapped up in a ring and you can immediately tell there's something different about the menu.  It's edible rice paper and a ring made from pulled sugar.  This isn't your average dessert joint.  They pour raspberry sauce for you to dip your paper in to enjoy, so don't start chomping on the paper just yet.  (We even got a new menu and ring to take home.)  Even the cutlery and water pitcher is something to take notice of.

* Amuse: Mango Sorbet with Mint Jelly - Our first thought about mint jelly was rack of lamb and we were a bit concerned about that.  This was far from the case.  The mint was very subtle and the mango was full of flavor.  A nice way to start our little journey.

* Choice of Dessert: Marriage ""Strawberry & Banana"" - Looking at the little masterpiece in front of you, it's as if have a miniature candy showpiece has appeared.  Delicious white chocolate, flecks of gold, fresh berries, banana cream, strawberry sorbet...it's just pretty and yummy to eat.

* Choice of Dessert: Apollo ""Chocolate & Raspberry Mousse"" - Another showpiece before your eyes, this time with this wonderful Earl Grey ice cream that rests on top (Oh how I wish I could order a huge bowl of that!).  Little accents like the meringue and the chocolate rice cookie squares were among my faves of the dish.

* Petit Four - Chocolate molten cake with marshmallows made from passion fruit and raspberry.  I enjoyed this dessert but this third part was not the favorite of the Husband's.  He really enjoyed the other courses more.

One of the best parts about sitting at the counter is watching the actual pastry chef up front and center.  Yes, she's one of the young girls working so hard to make every dessert look absolutely beautiful.  She's straight from Japan, having only arrived in the States a couple of months ago and apparently she's been trained by some of the best.

We asked how often they plan on rotating the menu and ultimately, they said they hope to do every week.  But for now, we'll see.  They also hope to have five entrees to choose from in the Choice of Dessert section.

We also got a goodie bag with yummy desserts to take home during their opening week, so I got to enjoy Raku all week long at home.

We're liking Sweets Raku and it'll be one of those places we recommend and take out-of-town guests.  This kind of experience isn't for everyone as it's quite drawn out and there's a reason they ask, ""How was your experience?"".  (Be sure to experience the restroom too!)  If you aren't into desserts, especially ones that take time and detail, this isn't your place.  They get busy in the later evenings but are slow when they first open in the afternoon.  So come early if you don't want to wait since this place only holds about 20+ diners at a time.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,14,11,5,O0WsPVaVYob7XPB9Z8tmhg

Somehow we learned about this place and, like communism, should have been great in theory.  Sadly, this was as disappointing as going to see Phantom of the Opera to find out that Crawford and Brightman are ill, and their stand-ins are Willie Nelson and Roseanne Barr.

This place is in a strip mall with a glass front that shows the wine selection.  Behind the wine selection are uncomfortable chairs at the tables and very uncomfortable stools at the countertop.  Sterile white walls and floors do their best to un-impress as you wait in a long line for one of 24 seats in the entire place.  Despite it's undeserved popularity, they have not expanded, so you will wait for about 40 minutes if you're lucky.

Let's get to the dessert - which is their ""specialty"".  We had the Mars, their most popular dessert, which involves lighting on fi-- wait, no we didn't, they ran out on Friday night.  I meant to say we ordered the Ringo, which was a mock apple pie.  The apple pie is in a puff pastry of sorts, with forgettable ice cream and an edible ornament fallen off your Christmas tree that is shiny and stuffed with whipped cream and a hint of caramel.  For $12, I'd recommend you buy 2 Costco pies.

Then we had a $12 parfait that they pour sauce into, and that's supposed to be amazing or something.  It wasn't - it was no better than McDonald's parfait.

Then they ran out of the Ringo, too, arguably a runner up to the Mars plate - remember, this was a Friday night when they should have expected to be busy.  If you study the staff, you'd quickly see that nobody appears to have worked in a restaurant before.  They are not sure when to seat guests, when to wipe down tables, when to run credit cards, how to serve everyone in the party at the same time, though they are genuinely sweet (even if their desserts are not).

It's a novelty - it's so shameful that they had a good idea once and didn't expand on it, didn't develop themselves as a company.  This fad will die if they don't figure out how the food industry works - mediocrity kills business.  $12 desserts need to be amazing, and these are not.

Ichigo-white chocolate cup filled with fruits and a bite size cake. Next to it is a hard shell imitation strawberry, cracked open and you'll have a strawberry flavored ice cream. 

Carib-colored chocolate disc, poured with warm mango sauce to melt your way into the dessert. Cool presentation. As for flavor, I believe it's cantaloupe sorbet with a bit of chopped fruits, brown mousse and a stick of pastry.

What sets this spot from the rest (that I've seen so far) is the interior decor. It is the cleanest design and color scheme... It compliments their product, delicious and colorful desserts. For a place that has earned the ""I must take a photo/video"" accolade, you must have the best background, and Raku has achieved that.

For a small room, this is worth the wait. Be appreciate of that wait because you will wait for the desserts as well. This is food at its best, prepared and presented like it was intended as, Food Art. We went for the two course dessert, chocolate croissant, and Peach hot black tea. 

Every little detail of the room is amazing. A lot of is authentic of a food spot in Japan. Even the bathroom is authentic with a Japanese automatic bathroom and a hand-washing well. 

The presentation of silverware starts off the experience. You become excited. Then the hot tea was presented and boy was it delicious. You should look into hot teas as it compliments sweet dishes very well and the hot temperature helps cuts the richness of the dessert. 

Chocolate croissant was heated up and served. My Lord was this pastry FLAKY and CRISPY. I could eat these things for days!!! I was then started off with a watermelon, lemon mousse, wine jelly, and a creme fraiche. This was over-the-top light and refreshing... So delicious! Crisp fruit, tart mousse, and a nice complimenting wine jelly. 

Let's get to the final part, the main dessert: Riyku. A mix combination of classic Asian flavors: black sesame, matcha green tea, red bean with the compliments of strawberry, chestnut, and vanilla creme. I love the light and fluffy composition. Such a beautiful dish as well.

Be honest with yourself. You didn't come here for the fanciful desserts or the friendly service. You came here for the 'gram. That would explain why everybody in line appears to be a tourist, and why they're willing to wait for a seat at the bar so they can watch the show. 

Sweets Raku is located in a pretty run-down strip mall, and the clean interior is a total mismatch for the dump outside. The outside would be enough to deter me from bringing a date here. We came mid-afternoon on a Sunday, and there was no wait for a table, so we opted for that. There were several people waiting for a space at the bar where you could watch the cooks finish your desserts in front of you. Our server explained the menu to us, and informed us that there was a minimum charge of $12 per head. With this in mind, we each ordered a dessert set.

I went with the mango sorbet and puffy cup. The mango sorbet was extremely tart, so much so that I could barely taste mango. The mint jelly was nice, though. This is listed on the menu as an amuse-bouche, which really means you get two spoonfuls of sorbet. The puffy cup is described on the menu as a cassis souffle with raspberries and blueberries . However, I could not taste any blackcurrant or raspberry. Incredibly, even though the vanilla cream was piped in in front of me, the souffle still managed to become soggy. On the side was a mango jelly, which was the best part of the meal. It was the only item that tasted sweet enough, and it actually tasted like mango. The micro mint on top was refreshing.

Service was good. They make a big show of setting your table after you've ordered, which makes everything feel rather robotic and detached. But I guess they need to do something to justify the prices they charge.

My impression of this place is that everything is highly contrived, for the sole purpose of being showy. There's little actual substance in their product. The dramatic flourishes they use have no intrinsic value and are basically gimmicks. Actually, that's probably a good description of Las Vegas as a whole lol. That being said, the staff at Sweets Raku was well-intentioned and the taste of the food was adequate. Do I think it was worth the price? Would I come back? Would I recommend this place to my friends? Unfortunately, it's a no on all counts.",amKuvJtW35lBe0o265H62A,1,0,3,OHbEyf1SMHAzcdld9m4d-Q

We were the only customers at the time we went so we had the chance to sit at the table in front of the oven/kitchen. I love watching the lady meticulously prepare our desserts which I thought it was well worth the price. The desserts are on the expensive side but it's okay to treat yourself once in a while.

We started off with a wine flight which the wine came out in test tubes. The test tubes were so adorable. It also came with a small slice of cheese and tomatoes which were a little too strong in taste for me. They are supposed to wash out after each wine taste but I'm not quite fancy yet. Another dish we tried had mango chocolate in a wine glass. The lady placed a pink chocolate cover on the wine glass and poured something over it and melted the chocolate which fell into the dessert. That dessert was fun to eat.

I absolutely love the raspberry sorbet. The sorbet was tiny but was sooo good. There were small chocolate pieces within the sorbet and I would taste the crunchiness every other bite. We also ordered a coconut dessert which was packed with a lot of different flavours. My tastebuds were confused as to what I was eating because each bite was different. 

Overall, I enjoyed the desserts which were different than the typical bakeries/desserts served at other restaurants. The service was really nice as well. I highly recommend this place!",PGJ4eb-8tmvea3XzqIdc_Q,0,0,5,dhXgfTTSbcI_2Yfdn3ySnA
5004520,2016-12-20,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Ordered two 2-course dessert sets at $15 each,  

I believe the first item in the dessert set changes frequently and ours was the mango sorbet.  It was definitely nothing to write home about and it was extremely small.

The second item that we each got were Mount Fuji and Mars.  I must say, these two were very good.  Mars had a strong alcohol taste to it but VERY good and Mount Fuji is essentially Mont Blanc, which was excellent.

The reason why I cannot give this place 5-stars is because it's way too expensive.  The chef is extremely talented and I loved the desserts but $12 per item is a bit steep.  It's worth a try for anyone visiting Las Vegas but I'm not sure if I'd go back considering the high cost.

Just a note that the plaza where this is located has two Raku's; Sweets Raku is located next to a massage parlor across from Snowflakes. Took my friends and me awhile to find (because we're blind af).

The wait was much shorter than I expected; only 30 to 45 minutes. If you come, try and get a seat by the bar! You get to watch the chefs prep the dishes, including creating the candy apple for the Ringo and heating up and pouring the bourbon that melts the white chocolate for the Mars. 

I ordered the Mars, a layered dish that included raspberries covered in vanilla and chocolate mousse sprinkled with chocolate wafers. A huge domed white chocolate dyed in red covered the dish, and the chef heated up a shot of flaming bourbon and poured it onto the dome. The chocolate melted in on itself, revealing the mousse I described earlier. The dish was delicious, although the bourbon did come off a little strong at times (since it gathers at the bottom of the plate). 

If I'm ever in Vegas again, I would definitely come back to try their other desserts.",8AUGRc11vpsRtWAltI4jBA,1,0,4,z2xIpf5FzYT1b4VbxepYNA

The service was decent.. 4 stars... But the desserts were mediocre at best. :(. 

Maybe we ordered the wrong thing?  Maybe we just have to wait for the right desserts?  We go the chocolate soufflé and the strawberry shortcake. We also got the raspberry sorbet. The sorbet was good but nothing special at all. I would say the texture and taste is the equivalent of a flinestone push pop. The chocolate soufflé was light and fluffy but I wish it had more bananas and less of that cinnamon liquid in the middle. It came with vanilla foam... Or at least that was the texture of the ice cream. Maybe it's on purpose?

My strawberry shortcake was the biggest disappointment of all. It took the lady ten minutes to assemble all the layers but it tasted like any plain cake you can get at any bakery. It came with small pieces of cut fruit (two grapes, one raspberry). Definitely not worthy ten dollars. I wish they had the Carib that everyone raves about but it's no longer on the menu.

So you can guess that I LOVED this place because this is exactly what it was!! 

it is the dessert extension of Raku, so we had very high expectations!!

If you can't find this place...I'll give you a hint...look for the red nearby in the same area as Raku. 

AMBIANCE: 5 - the place is neat and tidy. Everything is clean and completely white! anything placed on the white surface becomes the focus, and it's a striking, powerful, and beautiful dish every single time.

the utensils are retro. everything that I saw was modern and really chic. 

There is limited seating: a bar area and three tables. being seated at the bar is better, you can see them prepare dishes!!

SERVICE: 5 - They were extremely polite and answered every question that we had. They also explained every single thing that was on the plate in detail. they were extremely responsive and catered to everything that was asked.

btw, they can talk quiet and be hard to understand!

FOOD: 5 - This must come in parts.

1. there is a long, nice list of expensive alcoholic wines and beverages.
2. the menu is edible. try to eat it and they will offer a raspberry sauce, which made it better. It was a nice, tasty starter..but not really my thing!
3. their dessert menu changes every month.
4. they offer a full 3-courses of desserts called a Prix Fixe. ($19) Separately desserts are $12 and there was also side dishes! 

I chose Prix Fixe. It was delicious. it wasn't too sweet. First came Mango sorbet with mint jelly. A nice, light starter. Main Course, I chose Mt. Fuji, a light chestnut cake. It was just heavenly. Last, a molten lava cake with marshmallow and another raspberry mousse on the side. Angel Creme is also very good!! 

it was like a light sweet dessert-dinner, and I loved it. Everything was amazing!!

Sweet Raku is about hand crafted, refined, JAPANESE desserts; delicate flavors and natural, subtle sweetness.  This is not the diabetic sugary desserts most Americans are familiar with.  A fresh fruit would have the same amount of sweetness as their offerings.

Tip: Opt for the three course tasting.  Widest selection and best value.

Standout examples:

Mt. Fuji - A neutral chestnut sponge cake topped with lightly candied chestnuts robbed in ribbons of airy chestnut cream.  An ode to the chestnut.

Ringo - Modern take on the apple pie.  Barely sweetened apples sandwiched between flaky, slightly salty crust atop white chocolate.  A blown sugar apple filled with cream and an aromatic, slightly bitter sweet honey ice cream, all dusted with powder sugar finish the plate.  

Good selection of coffee and tea drinks.  Well chosen wine list.  Great off Strip prices.

Came here on a Monday night a little past 6PM. We wanted to wait and sit at the bar, but there was a family of 6 with a bunch of little kids occupying one half of the bar and it seemed like no one had gotten their desserts yet or ordered. After a few minutes, we decided to just sit at one of the tables. We asked for permission before we sat down, wasn't acknowledged or given a menu by any of the staff until we flagged one down. We ordered around 6:30 from a soft spoken male server. 
My bf and I shared the two course dessert, where we got the earl grey creme brulee and the Ichigo. We also tried to order a croissant, but we were told that it would take over an hour to make. How? They opened at 6PM-- did they run out or just decided not to make them or what? 

The first course earl grey creme brulee came out super quick, maybe 5 minutes after we put in our order. My initial reaction was, ""What the hell is this?"" It was extremely tiny that you could eat it in two bites. We both usually love creme brulee, but that was truly a sad excuse for a creme brulee flavor wise (some bites tasted a little burnt as well) and size wise. My bf said you could get better creme brulees at buffets lmao.

Our second course took 30 minutes to come out. Presentation wise, it looked quite nice. (Instagram worthy if you wanna put it). I liked how it wasn't too sweet and was on the lighter side. 

Would I come back? No. They need to work on their customer service skills for one.

AMUSE: Part of the Prix Fixe menu. It's a pineapple sorbet with white jelly. It was ok. (3 stars)

STRAWBERRY TIRAMISU: 3.5 stars

CARIB: 4 stars

PETIT FOUR: 3 stars

Sorry for the lack of description in the items. It's been a few months since I visited and I forget my exact feelings on each one. See Marvy S's review. She has a more descriptive review as to the ingredients involved in each of these. 

LOCATION:
The place is rather small. There are a couple of tables placed away from the kitchen, but for the experience it's better to sit at the dessert bar so you can watch them in action. It's really clean and modern inside. The bathroom is quite an experience as well. Sort of zen like. It's worth a visit. 

In a nutshell, I'm glad I was able to visit this place. You get picture worthy desserts and the flavor isn't all that bad. It's not mouth wateringly delicious though. Probably good for a guy to take his date if she likes desserts.",jP57G_UYWL3hYvGkEaXhNw,12,12,4,E0UUU73-gPocdyzGnESmgw

The only complaint could be about the prices IMO, but if you come in knowing you are going to spend $20 plus tax, tip, drinks etc on dessert, it's not TOO bad.

Teas are around $5, and most flavors are very exotic.  The Rosa Regale ($7) was pretty light handed...I've had this wine many times, just WISH there was more in my glass @ $7.

First of all, Cool presentation with the menu...all edible!  The ""paper"" itself and the holder are all edible lol.

Started off with the Strawberry Sorbet and Mint Jelly...simple and clean taste. Definitely a palate cleanser...good overall.

The Apollo: Chocolate and Raspberry Mousse, Raspberries and Earl Grey Tea Ice Cream. Yummy flavors and cool presentation.   Really liked the mousse and ice cream combination.

Marriage: Strawberry mousse and banana custard hiding inside the sponge cake, fresh berries, white chocolate garnish with gold leaf and sugar decorations. I thought this dish was the best out of the bunch, with the light fluffy sponge cake and custard combination.

And to finish, the Petit Four: Chocolate Lava Cake with Flavored Marshmallows. This was good as well...you can smell these as soon as you walk inside! LOL.

So overall, it is a little spendy for dessert, but if you sit back and look at the presentation and the love put into the food combinations and flavors, it's money well spent every few months or so.

As my main dessert I chose the Ichigo, and I was very impressed. The Ichigo consist of a thin balloon shaped white chocolate cup filled with pie crust and strawberry mousse, served with strawberry candy filled with strawberry sorbet and condensed milk mousse. The taste of the Ichigo reminded me of strawberry short cake which I love! My friend ordered the Miyabi which consist of a green tea souffle, vanilla ice creamed seasonal fruits in a green tea cookie wicker basket served with kumquat sauce and although it was good, we both agreed that it did not compare to the Ichigo. One thing you should know is that one main dessert is required per person, so you may share your desserts with each other as long as everyone gets their own. The cost is around 15$ per person for a main dessert and a seasonal sorbet. We both had the Mango sorbet which was good and the optional wine pairing which was in our opinion just ok..

The Ambiance was truly welcoming and delightful as well. With a gorgeous glass wall to act as a hall when you enter filled with wine glasses.

Back to the actual restaurant there is a beautiful bar you can choose to sit at, where u watch the chefs make the desserts in front of you. Or the table booths which was also a lovely touch.

I waited about 10 mins for a table, which felt like the longest 10 mins of my life, because as you are waiting, you see the other patrons eating their beautiful desserts.  You first will get seated and they will go over the menu with you in detail.   You can do the set with the pairings or just order one dessert.  But the minimum charge per person is 12.00  There's a lot to choose from, and i wished i did the pairings, but i was still too full off Raku.

I finally decided on the Mont Blanc cake, which they called the Mt. Fuji.   My friend got the Sunset which looked very pretty.   My Mt. Fuji that came out, was absolutely beautiful.  It's so hard to find this cake in the bay area.  Very few people make it and when they do they don't make it good.  There were chunks of chestnut in my cake..

 - Sunday night around 7:30 for party of 3. Didn't have to wait but the bar was the only thing that was open when we came.

LOCATION/INTERIOR:
 - located in the Seoul Plaza. The store is located closer to Spring Mountain Rd.
 - interior is super classy. When you walk in, you see a glasses wine cellar. Then you will see a wall full of Lupicia tea cans.
 - seating is either at the counter/bar and they have 3/4 tables. So the inside space is limited. 

ORDER & TASTE:
* the employees here are Japanese. The pastries  do taste very Japanese (not too sweet) and are beautiful.
 - Sweet Raku dessert set ($15): this is a 2 course dessert. Today's first course was either a raspberry or mango sorbet. Personally I liked the raspberry more. For main course, we got the Rikyu (black sesame sponge cake with sesame paste, green tea cream on top, served with green tea sesame seeds). If you like green tea, I would recommend. It has the delicate taste to it. I really liked it.

You enter, and there is a cute display of wines which is like a little wall separator. It was a Tuesday night, so they weren't too busy when we came so we were immediately seated at the bar. Awesome because you get to see the chef make everything (not from scratch of course but she puts it all together in front of you) You can even see her make the crystallized sugar as each order comes up! How cool is that? 

Service is a little slow, but with such sweet girls serving us and a show in front, it was ok with me. You're given a plate with a scroll on it to unwrap where they'll explain the menu for you. after You've had time to look over the menu, they come around to pour their TO DIE FOR raspberry sauce to dip your EDIBLE menu with. this sauce...was heaven. I swear. 

My BFF and I decided to go with 3 main dessert entree's instead of the 3 course meal just because we don't care for cream puffs much. But really, the 3 course meal is a score so it's your preference, we're just fatties like that. 

I loved every dessert we tried. EVERYTHING. Each was amazing in their own way, but the Red Rock (lava flow) was one of my favorites and tops it on my list of favorite desserts. This surpasses Roy's Chocolate Souffle and if anyone knows me, you know I die and go to heaven with each bite of his souffle but this lava cake was the perfect mix of sweet and sour and light. 

FYI: Mt. Fuki (chestnut cream cake) seems to be something thats always on the menu and their #1 seller. The couple next to us told us it was the most amazing dessert they've ever had (next to red rock) so when i'm back in Vegas, i'll be there to try this dessert. 

They don't take reservations here but if you're going on a weekday, they'll most likely have a table open or the wait isn't that long. But it is wroth the wait. Also, the desserts are $12 for just the entree and $19 for the 3 course. The chef is from Japan and if anyone knows anything about the Japanese, they're talented when it comes to food and what makes it perfect for my palate is that they know how to use sugar and not let the sugar be the main object of the piece. (it's not overly sweet, but just perfect.

The chef and Sioux chef move at blazing speed dishing out beautiful and relishes desserts in a flash. I will say that it was my best experience having dessert in LV (even though I also love eating the oversized delectables at Patisserie Manon).

Many of the dessert are played like artwork and range from light cream based to a large two part dessert to a beautiful melting dome. I believe the offerings do change periodically, so I'm looking forward to my next visit to try something new.

My choices for this visit was the two course dessert set with my choices of a mango sorbet with mint jelly and an Angel Cream (fromage blanc mousse and pear mousse with earl grey cookies and dark chocolate with a small bit of gold leaf, raspberries, and white chocolate wings). My beverage on the side was a raspberry and champagne concoction. The sorbet was light similar to a palate cleanser with the mint jelly being a light sweet and minty touch. The Angel Cream would be best described as heavenly. Soft sweet cream with pear was a surprising delicious combination.

It is off the strip and in a nice small location. I went on a weekend, where they served lunch and it was Japanese Italian infused. The lunch special was $23, which was a salad, tea cup of lobster bisque, sandwich and a choice of dessert. Great pricing!!! I also ordered the Salmon Tartar, which was amazing. The chilled sake was also very delicious, as it was not your typical sake, but it was like a gel like texture as you drank it. Different flavors, which both the blueberry and peach were very good. 
The desserts of course were so good as well. My friends and I ordered all five desserts and just simply enjoyed them all. The only downfall is, if you are going for lunch on the weekend, plan on spending some time there. It's not your typical fast paced restaurant, but more to sit and talk stories.

The three-spoonful sorbet was good but really, it's just sorbet. Nice and unique take on the apple pie, that I have to give it to Sweets Raku. Finally, the molten chocolate cupcake, really? I can make that at home using my microwave in less than 5 minutes. How disappointing. 

Just a note on the utensils: I know the knife and fork look very eclectic but they definitely were not easy to use. I could barely cut my apple pie with the knife and the fork was so awkward to handle I think it gave me finger cramps. 

As for the service, the waitress serving us had such a strong accent I could barely make out what she said. She was really sweet and nice but if I couldn't understand what the heck she was saying.

Asked by a man who many would say has dined better than anyone they know to join him for brunch during a one day stay in Las Vegas it was my pleasure to suggest Sweets Raku on Sunday afternoon, my third visit overall but the first time during a lunch service that sees the predominantly dessert menu expanded by a duo of sandwiches plus soup, salad, and the occasional quiche.   Small, spotless, but now rendered less sterile by light Japanese music playing overhead it was just prior to noon that we arrived, and seated on the corner as soon as the restaurant unlocked the doors it would not be long before an order was crafted - a six-course meal plus supplements rolling out over the course of the next hundred minutes at a slow, but deliberate pace.  Beginning first with cocktails, the light sake and bubbles pairing nicely to a both creamy foie gras with laminated pastry batons and caviar that could have used a little more crème fraiche to balance the brine, it was largely conversation about food that passed the time between courses and with a shooter of soup and crisp salad balancing light vinaigrette with creamy potatoes both pleasant enough, our 'main courses' each impressed - for him the salmon and ikura while I opted for fatty bacon crafted of iberico belly matched to crisp potatoes inside of a crispy, hot croissant.  Transitioning from savory to sweet with mango sorbet dressed in mint jelly that unfortunately got lost in the sweetness it was onward to better things that the meal progressed and while my friend enjoyed the Mont Blanc I opted for the seasonal Stella, a star of strawberries served over an almond-soaked financier with cream melding the two into a designer 'strawberry shortcake' with texture and nuance to spare.  Wrapping up the afternoon in puffs of choux offered with options for both cream and jam it was with little hesitation that both of us selected vanilla and black currant, the shell giving way in a crisp break to just a touch of pressure and melting on the tongue leaving me to wish they offered profiteroles by the plate. 

A bit underwhelmed by the caviar presentation but again impressed by everything else, including a croissant and cream puffs that made me think Raku should consider a bakery style counter as its next conquest, I still contest that Sweets Raku should be a destination for everyone who loves pastry and anyone looking to impress an out of town guest - a genuinely un-Vegas experience mere miles from the strip where passion and artistry matter much more than publicist noise or the name on the door.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,6,5,92rBKLZBFOX9nowZSOqfwA

There was a group of 5 ahead of us, and although there were 3 bar seats open (which obviously would not have worked for the group ahead of us), it took the person in charge of the seating 15 minutes to ask that group if it was okay that we got seated at the bar first.

Our ordered consisted of Jack in the Cup paired with a coconut sherbet. Both were yummy. I enjoyed the red sangria more than the white.",k2ap_dScTIr0n1D6RqVOFA,1,3,5,PzyBJlIxEUYvrfpQq6Rehw
5319906,2013-09-01,11,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"A few weeks after my first visit, I went to Sweets Raku again since they have new menu items.  I took my sister here so we can try Mt. Fuji, Veil and Ringo. As for the tea, we tried Tokio (sweet berries green tea) and Sakurambo (Japanese cherry black tea) with our dessert prix fixe. I have officially tried all their desserts, yay!

Amuse:
Mango sorbet with mint jelly.  The mango sorbet was a little bit tangy but very delicious with the mint jelly. I had the strawberry sorbet the first time. Both flavors are very good since they're two of my favorite fruits. 5/5

Mt. Fuji:
Spongecake, chestnuts with chestnut cream, chestnut tuile, chestnut and chocolate. I grew up liking chestnuts and chestnuts in dessert isn't common in Western cuisine so, this was a no-brainer.  5/5

Ringo:
Apple pie with honey ice cream, white chocolate dusted with cinnamon. There's a sugar candy shaped like an apple that has cream inside. An American classic got exciting again. Break the candy apple with your spoon for cream to put on your apple pie. The apple pie itself isn't sweet so eat it with honey ice cream. 5/5 

Veil:
Stuffed custard pie is what i says on the edible menu so it doesn't sound so interesting. I really was hesitant to order this because how exciting is custard pie? But I must say, I saved the best for last. What you get is flaky pastry with custard on top and in the middle...on top of berry cream swimming in compote all wrapped in a web made of sugar. The Apollo (chocolate and raspberry mousse) is a safe and obvious choice for chocoholics like me but I stepped out of my comfort zone and I'm glad I did. This is the best item they have on their menu. Confetti and glitter! 5/5

Excellent service as usual and our server, Kazue remembered me from my first visit. I'm still in love with this place. It makes me feel like a kid again. Genius! I think I might be addicted to this place now. The best way to end my birth month. Remember to join their e-mailing list.  Sit at the bar (if it's available) so you can watch the action and talk to the chefs. It's $19 for the prix fixe menu (sorbet + your choice of dessert + petit four) or $12 for just dessert (Apollo, Marriage, Veil, Mt. Fuji or Ringo). If you get Apollo wit your prix fixe, you'll get cheesecake instead of the lava cake. For descriptions of the other dessert items, read my previous review.

5345044,2016-06-23,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Let me preface this review with this: I am typically a very positive person & always look for good in every situation. I've worked in the hospitality industry for 7 years & always empathize with the establishment before myself. 

1. The Wait - waiting for a table will take you at least 30 minutes (if your lucky), but probably a full hour. This is mainly due to the fact that they will not seat any party other than the next in line- despite empty single seats at the bar & multiple open 2-tops. So if you are a party of 2 standing behind a party of 4 that ONLY wants to sit at the bar... You have to wait for them to be seated, even if the rest of the tables are empty.

2. The Service - our male server was of course polite ... he didn't make any suggestions on what was good, didn't try to sell us on dessert wine, nothing. The table next to us who was sat 2 parties after us (15 min after us) got their dessert first. No problem. We get our first dessert & while waiting for the second... another table that got sat after us got the same dessert we were waiting for. Then as I see the dessert we were waiting for... ANOTHER TABLE that got seated after us received it. Finally, after everyone else in the restaurant received all of their desserts- we got ours. 

3. The Food - as basic as basic could be. The flavor profiles were nothing to write home about. Even the little ""tricks"" that they do with melting chocolate shells with a hot sugary sauce could not compensate for the lack of vibrance these desserts had to offer.",4qPsVoJvyu_8cVnrXXxkJQ,2,1,1,R5F26uYnRGZ6Pt01pQ7UJA
5349218,2014-01-23,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I was torn on how many stars I should be giving to Sweets Raku. In the end, I decided on a 3 star rating.

A total of 4 of us decided to go to Sweets Raku for dessert. I've been dying to try this place and because there were a lot of us that went, we got to try a good portion of their menu! Sweets Raku does a prix fixe menu for $19 and it has a total of 3 courses. The first course and the third course is the same for everyone (kind of) while the second course, you get to choose one from a list of five choices. So let's get started!

Menu: Yes, yes, the menu is edible. When they first bring you the menu, it's rolled up and secured with a ring. The paper is edible and so is the ring. Was it good? The ring was. The menu, itself, was like a sheet of styrofoam almost. There was no taste to it and the texture was not pleasant for me. Of course, later on, they give you some raspberry syrup to dip it in and even then, I still did not like it. The ring, on the other hand, was fine. It's just sugar after all. 

First course. Amuse. It was a mango sorbet with mint jelly and decorated with a piece of mint. I liked the mango sorbet because it had a strong taste of mango. It tasted like real mango ... with a tinge of tangyness to it. It was refreshing to the senses. 

For the second course, we ordered 4 different types of dessert and was able to share it all.

Baton. Chocolate and pistachio mousse. HOW DO YOU EAT THIS THING? It was a chocolate cake bottom with pistachio mousse wrapped with chocolate wafer and decorated with candy on top. Yeah, can't say that I tasted pistachio in that. I actually didn't remember what it was made out of except for chocolate so pistachio never crossed my mind that night. I think my favorite part of this dessert was the chocolate wafer surrounding it. 

Marriage. Strawberry and banana. This dessert, to me, was one of the better ones. It was light and fruity. Can I taste the strawberry? Yes but that's probably because I ate the strawberries. Can I taste the banana? No. I still liked it because it was light and fruity. It wasn't dense or heavy. But it's not great enough to write anything home about. 

Mt. Fuji. Chestnut cream cake. This was, by far, one of the favorites among everyone. I love chestnut and I love a chestnut dessert done right. However, this may have been a favorite but I feel that there may have been somethings that could've been executed better in this dessert. Compared to the other desserts we had that night, Mt. Fuji ran a flat line for me and it held no range. There was nothing particularly different about it. I could buy a chestnut dessert at Suzuya and it could be potentially better except smaller in size. It would've been better if they had a harder crust like bottom, like they do in fruit tarts. Speaking of the bottom, the bottom of this dessert was odd. Half of the bottom was cake and the other half was something else -- I forgot. I would be eating one side, talking bout how good the chestnut bits were and my friend, who was on the other side, would look at me like, ""Where are you finding this?"" In the end...good, but can be better. 

Ringo. Apple pie. This dish is very interesting because they have a piece of apple pie on one side. Then next to it is an apple shaped candy with cream filling. Then next to the apple is a honey ice cream. If the apple pie was replaced by something else, this particular dessert would've won it all for me. However, I'm not an apple pie person and I understand that apple pie fits the theme to this dish. The candy apple and honey ice cream was great. The sweetness of the candy mixes well with the cream inside of it. The honey ice cream was not too sweet. It had a hint of sweetness but it goes so well with anything and everything. 

Now the third course is a petite four. It's typically a lava cake but if you had ordered the Baton, you get a cheesecake instead. The lava cake is decorated by fruity marshmallows and alcoholic raisins. Funny thing .. my friend tried the raisin and said it was good so I popped one in my mouth. Hilarity ensues. My face scrunches up and I automatically look for a napkin to spit in. No, just no and WHY? The lava cake is ... a lava cake. You know, when it comes to Japanese made desserts, I expect it to be light and fluffy. Nope, not the case. The lava cake was dense and so very rich in chocolate. No go for me. 

Now the cheesecake version..it was decorated by pieces of grapefruit, which I'm VERY thankful for. I like grapefruit and I know they did not soak it in alcohol first. The cheesecake? Dense and heavy. It was like eating a block of cheese -- no joke.

Was it a good experience? Indeed it was. This is the first time I've done a prix fixe menu for DESSERTS. Did I have a good time? Absolutely. My friends were there with me every step of the way. Would I go to Sweets Raku again? Most likely not. I absolutely cannot justify the price tag of $19 for 3 desserts that I didn't fall in love with. I don't even miss it.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,2,0,3,caWWx_OdMR18YIQ1rGZenQ

I always got the full 3 course meals and our group got all the different variety of the main entres so we can share.  I can't really choose  which one was best bc all of them were surprisingly good.

Each dessert is hand made and provides quite a show.

We all know that if you like desserts you will love the edible menu, the ring that holds t the 3-course is the way to go. I tried the panna cotta and the lava cake. Both were just perfection. No details because it'd be way to long of a review.

If you DONT like desserts, I know you exist, don't pass Sweets Raku. These desserts are not just sugar. They take into account texture, and multiple layers of flavor and senses.

5374797,2018-06-13,2,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Fantastic and unique experience. I've been hearing great things about this dessert place before coming here and this place definitely did not disappoint me. My friend took me there and highly recommended to be seated at the bar, because that's where you could see the whole process of your dessert was being freshly made in front of your eyes and it was a cool experience. They have a set menu of 3 desserts per person, or if you are like me and just want to try and share with your girlfriend, you can add $5. We ordered a set of 3 desserts of Raspberry Sorbet, Mars and Chocolate Cream Puff. 

Raspberry Sorbet: This was a very refreshing dessert, definitely in love with the sweet and sour taste of raspberry. This made a great introduction of the opening for dessert and made us have good appetite for looking forward for more desserts :)

The Mars: Highly recommended!! This was a one cool dessert and I not only enjoyed watching visually, but also enjoying to eat it. This Mars dessert was a mousse inside a white/ red chocolate dome outside along with brandy, raspberries, blueberries and hazelnut chocolate crunch to give it a good texture and jam. What's so cool about this dessert was that it would use a nice dosage of flaming cognac to melt the chocolate dome. It was magical to look at for sure. I loved it :) 

Chocolate Cream Puff: We decided this last course of dessert - chocolate cream puff was simply because we saw a freshly batch of cream puff being made, which smelled so freaking good. The taste of this chocolate cream puff was okay, we got the raspberry cream inside. It gave a nice touch of cream puff :) It wasn't that impressive but we still liked it. 

The staffs there were super friendly, polite and provided nice customer service. And, I really loved their bright and clean interior design with open kitchen concept. If you get a chance to visit, be sure to stop by and enjoy some desserts!",GoHx2DAe5D-gvIqg4pqQEg,5,5,5,21y3BYWDBX014cF_qVPevQ

Walking in, it smells delicious! It seems to be better sitting at the bar in order to watch everything being made. But we were a party of 6 -- 5 or more, gratuity is included in the check -- so we were seated at a table. You have to come at a good time (I'm not sure when exactly) because it's pretty small in there. Probably less than 20 people can be seated in the entire restaurant. 

It was $15 for a two-course dessert meal. The first course is their daily special type thing. Ours for the night was some sort of pineapple sorbet I believe. The second course was your choice of five items. I think the menu changes every so often... 

I ordered the miyabi and the rest of my table ordered different things so we can try them all! Buuuut again, I was not impressed. Maybe I don't have the palette for $15 desserts...

This was my first time trying a fancy dessert place. I was a little hesitant seeing the prices, but decided to try it anyway. It's advertised as a an enjoyable Japanese/French style dessert place and it definitely delivers.

There's not much parking here, but we found a spot quickly. The area doesn't look like it would house such a fancy place, but I guess that's where the hidden in hidden gem comes from.

We waited for 2-3 minutes to be seated and sat at the bar. Seating was a bit tight. It takes a little while for someone to come by and take your order but we just watched the desserts being made. This is was honestly a big part of why I liked this place so much. It was fascinating to watch everything being made and all the steps that went into each dessert. 

Food:

I got the raspberry sorbet and ichigo. The raspberry sorbet was so packed full of flavor it was amazing. The ichigo was delicious and is something I would gladly get again. 

Price:

The desserts are on the pricey side, though I think you do get your money's worth for the experience along with the food. They do have a one main dessert per person minimum, so be mindful of this if you're thinking of coming. 

Service:

Everyone was really nice and very courteous. They observe some traditional Japanese customs (greetings and things they say when they leave a room) which created a nice fun environment.",2KquSGfWJt9g0_CoQ1X82A,0,0,5,qeWNDlwQxhE6IE0JJrVloQ
5428820,2018-05-25,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,I hate to give anything with Raku a low review but I gotta tell it like it is. Our experience here was such a let down. We love Raku and coming to Sweets Raku was going to be the culmination of our Vegas trip. We arrived and the hostess was friendly and cleared a space for us to sit. We were in aw of the beauty of the desserts that were being presented to the people around us. We were full off of our dinner at Raku but we were ready to indulge some more. The hostess went over the menu and let us know it was a $12 minimum per person which we were okay with. We chose our top two desserts from their menu  and waited. We were able to watch our desserts be made and when it was time for us to eat we got to watch a bit of a show with the presentation. We had a dish with flaming brandy that was poured on top (Mars). Then we also had another dish that was a chocolate pistachio combination (Spring Mountain). The Mars tasted like a custard with too much brandy and the spring mountain just was a slight taste of pistachio with not much else but a little texture inside like a flaky cookie. We were completely disappointed so we decided to try two of their cookies that were sitting on the counter. We tried the pistachio cookie and a chocolate one. Both tasted the exact same. I would not come here again for dessert since there are so many other good desserts out there especially in Vegas. It was an experience but the taste of the desserts are a total let down.,uJPpBY08P4U4uGfjfYLXWg,0,0,2,oSUkRK6lZtY9qh7qKreEHg

I ordered for us the Mt. Fuji, Angel cream, Mars, vanilla bean cream puff, a pot of tea and a glass of sake. 

The Mt. Fuji was my favorite. The taste was bold and the presentation and creative was well appreciated. The Mars order comes with a fire show and that was cool but this dessert was eh. Angel cream was the most disappointing of them all. It composed of 3/4 cream and 1/4 cake. This reminded me of Asian birthday sponge cakes. Which isn't bad because I do love Asian birthday cakes but I could've had a whole cake for the same price. The vanilla bean cream puff with blackberries were interesting. The cream puff had a slight crunch but still seemed stale. The cream  filling was tastier than Mars and Angel cream but I was still not impressed.

We chose the mango which was an amazing choice. The Ichigo dessert also comes with a strawberry sorbet in a strawberry candy shell and the sorbet itself is worth the $15.

The Ichigo was the best of the three desserts. It was shortcake, crunchy shortcake (maybe?), white chocolate, strawberry cream, all sorts of good good. The Mars was beautiful - a hard white chocolate shell with cake and berries and maybe ice cream in the center. Your chef takes a literal blowtorch and lights up some brandy and drenches your dessert. Ours was a little too heavy on the brandy in some parts. The Mt. Fuji was bland in flavor comparison to the other choices. It looked beautiful but lacked really strong hints of cocoa, chestnut, or from the sponge cake.

There is a lunch menu, but to be real, no one is coming here for that as much as the desserts. Can't believe these are only $12.

The restaurant is small and not a lot of parking, so prepare to wait a while if you come with a large party.

First and foremost, this restaurant has no labels, signs, or advertising; just a glass wall, revealing an illuminated white restaurant and silver spoon, that turns a curious eye and allures the adventurous.  If your sweet tooth can handle it, you must do the Prix Fixe.  You'll get a very satisfying three course dessert meal that'll keep you coming back for more.  We came here in search of a new place to satisfy our sweet tooths and boy did we succeed!

With the Prix Fixe, we ordered Apollo, Mt. Fuji, Amuse (Raspberry Sorbet)...and I honestly can't remember the rest because I couldn't concentrate so I stopped taking pictures of the desserts.  Mmmmm mmm delicious!  Even though the Amuse was a small portion, it was more than enough to give me a good fill.  I can't tell you enough how amazing our experience was.

Just about everything is edible, including your menu.  The best place to sit is at the bar, so you can watch them carefully sculpt and craft your dessert.

After perusing the menu and asking the server about the current seasonal dessert, both my wife & ordered the dessert set:

(for her):  Melon sorbet followed by the Mars course,
(for me):  Mango sorbet followed by the Mt Fuji course, along with a wine flight.

Over the next 30 or so minutes, we watched them make all the desserts for the place, meticulously assembling all the components to each dish.  Our dining experience came with a free show!

The sorbets came out first.  The melon sorbet was topped with a dollop of whipped cream (made in house, of course), while the mango sorbet had a side of mint jelly.  The mango was very strong, which overpowered the mint jelly.  Texturally, the jelly was fine, but I could barely taste the flavor.  The melon sorbet was also flavorful, but a lot more mellow than the mango.

My wine flight came out next, served with two different types of cheese and a sun-dried tomato.  The presentation of the wine was delightful, served in small test tubes.  It felt appropriate, as the entire dining room felt like a food lab.  The chardonnay and the cabernet sauvignon were fine, but the star of the flight was the ice wine.  It was light and sweet and perfect with the sorbet.  I could have drunk an entire bottle of that!

Next, my wife's Mars dessert came out.  We watched the chef assemble the yuzu mousse and chocolate cream, with the fruit and nuts delicately placed on the plate.  A chocolate dome was placed over the all the pieces.  Finally, the chef poured a shot of brandy into a metal cup, then proceeded to torch the cup, igniting the brandy inside.  The chef poured the flaming brandy onto the dessert, melting the chocolate onto the rest of the sweets underneath!  While the spectacle was wonderful to behold, the dessert also tasted heavenly.  All the components fit together, which is good, since the chocolate shell was melted over everything!

My Mt. Fuji was next.  While the presentation wasn't as awesome as the Mars, it was still a wonder.  Sponge cake was surrounded by chestnut cream, served with vanilla hennessey ice cream and chocolate wafers.  It was difficult to eat without just diving into it.  A little more messy than the other desserts, but just as delicious.

The Mt. Fuji took a little bit to make (since they have to bake the sponge cakes and the dining room was packed), but I didn't mind the wait, since I enjoyed watching the chefs.  But to reward my patience (and to apologize for the delay), they gave me a complimentary glass of dessert wine.  I was blown away by the thoughtfulness of the gesture, as well as it being so unexpected.  It was a white dessert wine, the pairing for the Mt. Fuji.  It was did pair well with my dessert, though not as light as the ice wine.

Overall, it was an extraordinary experience.  Between watching the staff perform their magic, to the tastiness of the food, and the extreme courtesy of the crew, our minds and taste buds were blown away.  We will come back in our next trip to Vegas",yv9jvt_58q9ZQzl9i8xUmw,0,0,5,kYoCK39wytLl2cxrlFYHWQ

Sit at the bar so you can see them making your food. 
Go to the bathroom Bc youll step into avatar. 
The edible menu is not good but there for the fun factor.

5488282,2016-09-12,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Wow, wow, wow! Wow! 

Ok now that I've calmed my excitement over how amazing this place is, let me tell you about my experience. First off, come early as this is a tiny place with limited seating. I don't believe they take reservations but I could be wrong about that. I came here with a few friends, and everyone that sits must order something. This worked out perfectly for us since there were 5 of us and 5 desserts on the menu. We also ordered their cheese platter, very tasty cheese! 

Each one of the dessert was amazing, minus one. I didn't care for the red ball one because to melt the red ball thing they pour alcohol that's on fire on top of it and it makes the dessert so saturated with alcohol that it ruins the taste for me. But everything else...wow! Each dessert basically came with a show of melting something, which made it all the more fun! 

There's only one pastry chef and she won best pastry chef, last year I think. She makes everything right there as soon as you order it. If you're lucky enough to snag a bar seat you can watch her make everything. 

If you're in Vegas, I highly recommend trying to come by this place. Even if you have to wait an hour, it's totally worth it. Next time I'm in town I'm coming back. Seems like their menu is seasonal so always something new to make me drool!",GFyPzPnieODkHudRnfHddQ,6,5,5,8bEj8ZLdFiTmJx72wC1tIg

When you first walk up, wine racks are on display in the front window. Walking in, the place is stark white with marble countertops and tables. Try to get a seat at the bar if you can so you can watch Chef Mio in all her glory, plating up your dessert.

We opted for the 2 course menu ($15). It included an amuse (for us it was either coconut sorbet or blueberry champagne sorbet) and one of 5 main desserts. The desserts are pretty large, definitely big enough to share after a large meal. I chose the caribe (melon sorbet, brûléed banana, coconut panna cotta, mango, kiwi and some pastry stick. It was presented in a wine glass and when she set it down, there was a chocolate wafer set on top. She pours a liquid (mango) on top and it melts the wafer and falls into the glass. 

My friends got the apple pie with honey ice cream and a whipped cream filled blown sugar apple. And the other got a chocolate soufflé that the chef injected creme anglaise into right upon presentation. All completely blew me away. The presentation, execution and service were on point. Americanos were delicious. 

They do also have a savory section for those that don't have a sweet tooth.

There is a minimum charge of one main dessert ($12) per person. The 2 course dessert is only $15 and comes with a small seasonal dessert and one main dessert. It's definitely worth $3 more to get the 2 course - the seasonal dessert is $5 on its own.

5593590,2016-08-13,2,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Sweets Raku is a small dessert restaurant, usually only open from dinner to midnight, found in Chinatown. I heard about it by word of mouth (recommended by our babysitter, actually!) and decided to try it out while some friends were visiting from out of town.

First off, parking was a bit tricky. We were there at roughly 10pm, and the small square's parking lot was FULL. We circled around for a few minutes before spotting someone who was leaving. There is street parking as well.

Upon entering, you line up on the interior side of the entrance, where a floor to ceiling glass wall with wines elegantly displayed separates those waiting from those dining. We were in line waiting behind two other groups, but fortunately our smaller party of three got us seated ahead of one.  

There are roughly 3-4 tables along the side wall, and the remaining 12 or so seats are all counter - which is probably where you want to be. But I'll digress on that later. The ambiance is very trendy; not necessarily casual, but not elegant either. The counter and most of the prep surfaces are a white marble, with white tiles along the kitchen walls. The menus are already waiting for you, open and ready to explore, even before you sit down at the table/counter. The servers are attentive and professional, and the chefs are just magical with what they do.

Now why the counter? They counter gives you a full view of the kitchen ovens and prep areas, as the chefs create these magnificent and beautiful dessert plates. We watched one chef make candy apples by heating and blowing candy into shape. Another chef was busy scooping ice cream, plating creme puffs, and so much more. The ovens that have your food are right there, so you can watch your blueberry soufflé rising right before your eyes!

Of the courses my friends and I shared:
Apple Pie: Beautifully presented. The candy apple was visually stunning and delicious, filled with two types of creme. The puffs were light and airy, and the apple filling, unfortunately, reminded me more of an applesauce than a traditional apple pie filling. 

Another dessert of custard came with a white chocolate dome, which was melted and caved in via a blowtorch-heated cognac poured as soon as it was served. Sadly I forgot the name of it. The alcohol was a delightful 'kick' to the lighter, sweeter custard, and the crunchy bits hidden under the dome, along with the white chocolate, provided a diversity in textures.

Puffy: a mildly standard but wonderfully airy soufflé, with a beautiful soft blue color, with blueberries hidden beneath. The blueberries were a nice mix of sweet and tart, a good finish to the light, soft flavor of the soufflé. They inject it with a vanilla creme as it is served, and you watch the soufflé rise to accommodate the creme. There was an additional side of mango with jelly, which to me was just insanely delicious, and I could've eaten more of that as a standalone dessert.

Overall, no single dish was overly filling, as it is more an experience in visual appeal as well as flavor and texture. I am excited to return to try the other dishes on the menu. These chefs know what they are doing and their precision and attention to detail are evident in every aspect of each dish.",NO7hzgi7ZS3b2D5gNi2Gfg,3,2,5,9NmpQmFdhXSIjqQtNXvZNg

We got the 2-course dessert set for $15. It came with a seasonal sorbet and a main dessert. You can add an alcoholic drink for $7 so we got the plum sake and wine. The sorbet that we got came with chocolate cookies with coffee jelly and cream. It was pretty good.

The winner of the night is the Spring Mountain, which is pistachio cream cake, strawberry and raspberry mouse on top of mini chocolate cake and pie crust. The pie crust was flaky and everything tasted sweet and decadent. I wanted more when it was gone!

I ain't even got a sweet tooth, however, any place that offers a edible menu on wafer paper, served with berry dipping sauce...count me in!  It's like being given a top secret mission before destroying the encrypted message via consumption, I love it!

The plan was easy, devour all the extravagant sweets in sight, take photos off everything, laugh with strangers and comment about how we would all slap the spit out of our mama's since everything was soo Damn delicious, all the while acting bujee as a mofo.  Mission accomplished, and some.

We stayed with the amuse that included Mint jelly on fresh strawberry sorbet followed by conquering Mt. Fuji.  The dormant volcano erupted with a concoction consisting of water chestnuts topped with a stringy looking covering that resembled soba noodles, very interesting.  The Ringo just might be the best apple pie I ever had.  The fish came with cream encased in a sugar casing shaped like a candied apple, the design was immaculate.

5601717,2013-11-19,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"In Las Vegas you're always dining on a strip. If you're not dining on The Strip, you'll most likely be dining in nondescript strip malls in neighborhoods that you don't want to be caught walking at night. Still they are worth the drive/cab fare because the local foodie scene can be just as a fun experience as any Strip eating experience, as well as being a bit more reasonably priced. You just have to know exactly what you're looking for.

I wanted to take the No1DP out for a meal to celebrate his belated birthday and my appreciation for him being such a wonderful boyfriend by letting me tag along with him this trip. 

---
CAB FARE: ~$14 to the Palazzo base fare.

VENUE: Located in a strip mall off Spring Mountain, the restaurant is very small with about half the guests being in tables and the other half sitting at the bar. If you are a foodie, SIT AT THE BAR. You'll see two dedicated and passionate pastry chefs make your desserts with such care and attention to your dish. Walls are almost bare so as not to distract you from the desserts - part of the experience is to watch them make your dessert.

As it's a small space, call ahead for approximate wait times. They do not take reservations.

SERVICE: No1DP may be used to Japanese waitstaff but I thought the waitress serving us was very cheerful and polite. Her accent was so thick that I couldn't get the descriptions of the desserts so I had to ask the pastry chefs to explain again as I scrawled it on a napkin. 

PRIX FIXE ($19, $7 with wine)
No1DP noticed that the menu was made with a type of paper that you could actually eat and tore off a piece. This was confirmed by the waitress; after placing our orders she brought a plate with a raspberry sauce for us to dip our menus. The menu tastes like edible paper that is best dipped with the raspberries. The ring that holds the menu is also edible, we saw more rings being made in the counter.

The 3-couse prix fixe consists of the following
Amuse
Both of us started with kabocha pudding (green tea sauce, chocolate and kabocha chip). Texture is similar to black sesame pudding I've had at another Japanese restaurant. There is a mild but evident sweetness in the dish that is offset by the pumpkin. This was also the only dish we didn't see made.

Mains
No1DP had Apollo (chocolate and raspberry mouse mousse, chocolate cake, earl grey ice cream). Japanese desserts are not known for their richness though you could still taste the chocolate and raspberry. No1DP liked his dish and wine pairing enough that he was willing to risk getting a migraine to enjoy his dessert wine. As a fan of earl grey tea, he also enjoyed his ice cream.

I had Mt. Fuji (chestnut cake, chestnut paste, custard creme, Hennessy syrup). I got to see my dessert being made from start to finish. Apparently they use some contraption to make the chesnut cream take shape, followed by refrigerating the dish to let the cream hold. Chesnuts were slightly crunchy and chesnut cream and cake were light and fluffy. My wine was a slightly tart white wine to add but not overload the chestnuts.

Petit Four
As the No1DP's dish contained chocolate, his petit four was a small piece of cheesecake that contained REAL cheese on the top. No1DP notes that the portion was light, delicate and small enough for him, otherwise he would have had a dessert overload.

My petit four was the traditional small lava cake with raisins and raspberry and passion fruit decorated on the side. I saw how committed to perfection the chefs are as they erased any imperfections with a napkin and redid the decoration. Raisins and marshmallows were light. Lava cake was small enough as a finishing dish yet contained all the components of a good lava cake - fluffy yet firm cake with hot molten chocolate in the center.

As we left the waiters noticed that we were from out of town and thanked us wholeheartedly for stopping by. Considering that I rarely go off-strip to eat anything seeing warm genuine service with a smile was much appreciated. 

Final word: Go here if you want a new meaning/experience to eating desserts, which in most instances are often rush and shoe-horned at the end of meals. Don't go here if you just want to grab a quick sweet or if you like your desserts rich.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,2,2,5,q-4Wv1ibgVQa2-g4qYjIIA

Creating beautiful sugar concoctions, pastry chef Mio Ogasawara has been wowing her customers ever since 2013.  The desserts here are really works of art, made in front of you while you watch, as long as you sit at the counter.  I've always chosen to sit there because that's where you get to see the art-making in action. 
When they first opened, Sweets Raku had edible menus, which was definitely a wow factor.  Those are long gone, though, but the quality of the product has not changed over the years.  It's still a very popular destination, though, so be prepared to wait for seating.  And, as mentioned in other reviews, parking for this plaza can be scarce so be prepared to walk, too.
My favorite dessert here is the Ringo, which is a candy apple, honey ice cream, and apple pie.  Crack that apple and get to eating.  But, first, with almost any of the desserts here, you almost feel guilty for ruining them because they are so lovely.  That's why you take lots of pictures first.

5630277,2017-01-06,2,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"By all accounts, we were suuuuper lucky on our visit to Sweets Raku.  Having been fans of Raku for years (before they got super popular), we were hoping to get in on our latest visit. Luck was with us...we walked in around 9pm and there was NO LINE. Wow, yay!  By the time we left, there were about 20 people in line.

Anyhoo, hubby went a la carte with the Mt. Charleston.  I did the 2-course thing with Mars and also got the plum sparking wine cocktail.

Really, nothing beats sitting at the bar.  Although it felt like the ladies had the desserts down pat (and there may have been a sense of repetition in their overall demeanor), it was still so cool to see their work.  

My mango sorbet with apple gelee was a pleasant preamble to the main course.  I would have preferred another flavor sorbet but it was the luck of the draw.  As it turns out, this wasn't bad at all.

Our desserts came next...the Mt. Charleston was definitely yummy, through and through.  My Mars was beautiful to look at and the melting of the dome was a nice touch.  However, I could have used less brandy in the dish.  It overpowered much of the dessert though on the bites where I didn't get too much brandy, it was delicious.  I saw a lady sharing the dessert with possibly her 10 yo granddaughter and I thought it was definitely not child-appropriate. The quick toasting of the brandy probably did little to burn off the alcohol. Thankfully, the kid stopped eating it pretty soon. 

During this time, I did get my cocktail and while it did serve as a break from all the sweetness, it really didn't mesh with my palate at that point in time and I didn't really taste much of the ume.  As a result, I think I ended up only drinking about half of it.

I eventually also ordered what I think was called the Primavera...a coconut panna cotta (I love panna cotta) with a bunch of berries and mousse-like substance on it.  This one also had a flair - they put a disk of what I think was white chocolate over the glass the dessert is served in and melt it with a warm sauce.  My original choice was the Ringo but they'd sold the last one just a few minutes before.  (And the night was still young!) Still, the Primavera was soooo good.  It looked like a general mish mash of things but I couldn't get enough.

Service from our lady was very smiley and nice. We enjoyed our visit and definitely look forward to coming back again to try other things (like the Ringo).",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,5,2,4,PxPq6DE16kPGYqxj15YYyQ

The bathrooms - fantastic! (they have a remote control toilet, you hear me! remote control, with warming on the seat.... fantastic). The flavor of the dessert? Really not that exciting, especially for the price. I went with a friend. We split the sorbet, it was alright, nothing special, but not bad. On the recommendation of the waitress, I got the coconut mango flan thing that's served in a glass with a piece of chocolate on top that they melt with hot mango sauce in front of you... so pretty... so mediocre in flavor. Just somewhat bland tropical flavors with mostly mushy texture and a little bit of pie crust or something inside (which was the best part). Did I eat it.... well, was it over 10$... you know I did. Anyway, my friend got the apple strudel thing. Also so beautiful, they have a hollow apple made of candy that they fill with caramel and whipped cream... so cool. The flavor was better than mine, but still not blowing me away. We also split a chocolate cream puff.... still nothing special. Maybe this is because I prefer a richer dessert, but you would think that one of the items would be a huge stand out when you order such a variety.

I had gone in there on a Friday evening with my husband and his cousin to try dessert, since it's been on my bucket list for quite some time.

We each ordered our own tasting menu. I was a bit sad because this was 2 course tasting menu, and I had seen through other reviews that there was three course prix fix menu. But I couldn't find it. (I really wanted to try that edible menu.. Maybe next time.) With the tasting menu, you get a choice or two sorbets ( I chose the Coconut) and a main plate (I chose the Mars). 

When we our sorbets- I really like the small presentation in a demitasse. And When received my Mars dessert, I was blown away by the presentation I love the white chocolate dome that looked like Mars, and the server had a torch and torched some alcohol and poured it over the dessert, it as really cool. The flavors were real nice as well, not too sweet and some hazelnut in there for texture. I do wish the alcohol was cooked off a little bit longer though, because it left a strong flavor at the bottom every time I went in for another scoop.

Overall, I really enjoyed this place. Just maybe one thing about service though, I wish the servers would speak up a little bit. It was kinda hard to hear them, and the noise level at that time wasn't too loud. But they did a great job.

I came with here with my boyfriend and two friends. For dessert, We all got something different and started out with the Caviar appetizer which was ok, definitely a ""boujee dish"" and the brûlée liver pate which was delightful. I loved how they brulee the pate which made it stood out. We all got jasmine tea to cleanse our palette and I'm not over exaggerating- the tea was very potent and fresh. 

Onto Dessert: over all, the dessert was too sweet which was a bummer. This is Japanese owned so usually their style usually isn't super sweet. Presentation is obviously beautiful and watching them how to make it was interesting and made it an experience.

Not only does this place serve gorgeously presented desserts, but it's delicious as well. I sat at the counter and had a great view of how they prepared the desserts. They literally make everything as it's ordered so it does take some time to get your food. I got the 2 course and one a la carte.

Coffee jelly tiramisu: This one came with the 2 course dessert and had layers. This is where you dig through the milk foam and some kind of mousse to get to the coffee jelly. If you don't, tastes like frothy milk. Once I tried everything together, the coffee flavor was pretty prominent and the cream chilled it out. 

The carib: This one was made beautifully in a wine glass and had a piece of white chocolate on top. Some kind of sauce was poured over it, causing it to melt in the dessert. This was a mix of fruits, sorbet, and creams for a refreshing melon tasting dessert! This was by far my favorite one. 

Forgot what the last one was called but it was a purplish sponge cake that they injected cream into. Make sure you get every layer because we didn't notice that there was a berry compote on the bottom until the end. This cake was pretty good as it was super fluffy and had a hint of what tasted like taro. The compote sent it over the top with it it's sweetness!

Went on Saturday 3-19-16 at about 7pm cuz' we had a sweet tooth.

Pretty steep for desserts but they are fancy-schmancy and the ladies make them right in front of you. 

The experience is five stars.  The place is clean, ultra modern, and the people who work there were just bending over backwards to make us happy.

We sat at the bar and ordered our desserts and they brought out place settings, water, and the most adorable little plastic set of dishes, cups, and utensils for my toddler.  How incredibly thoughtful!  

The $12 angel cream is so pretty with it's sugared dome exterior, edible white chocolate angel wings, and pulled sugar ""halo"".  I was initially a bit scared by the description ""fromage mousse and pear mousse"" (CHEESE MOUSSE? EWW) but the dessert was light and melted in my mouth.  The bottom part of the dessert is like a soft cookie crumble.  The details on this thing are mind-boggling!  I loved this beautiful, intricate dessert. 

The $12 Ringo is a crisp apple pie and ice cream with whipped cream filled apple candy on the side.  Besides being absolutely gorgeous it was very tasty.  The pastry shell and apples were nice and warm and the ice cream was rich and decadent.  The cream-filled candy apple is a show-stopper and tastes exactly like creme brulee.  I loved it.

Seating for this place is in a line fashion, not a waitlist version where you put your name down, so if you're coming here after dinner, expect to wait at least 1.5 hours in line before getting seated. 

For the 2 course dessert meal here (which comes with your main dessert + their dessert of the day), I ordered the primavera, which is basically coconut panna cotta with raspberry sorbet in a wine glass. The dessert of the day, I forgot the name of it...but it tasted like tiramisu. In general all my friends and I agreed that the food here is good, but everything definitely looked better than it tasted. 

Lastly....they also have a 20% gratuity charge for parties of 5 or more, but don't even try to be smart and spilt up your group because they're just going to find an excuse to charge you that 20% anyways. When we informed the manager that we were different parties (I mean it should have been obvious since we were seated at completely different times) she failed to take off the 20% charge for us.

5747344,2017-09-12,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Sweets Raku is one of the top places to go in Las Vegas. It is a small hidden away restaurant that specializes in deserts and drinks. During peak hours you can expect to wait up to an hour just to get seated. For most places I would say skip the wait and go somewhere else, but for Sweets Raku, its worth the wait!
   The staff is professional and friendly and the restaurant is always spotless. They are always adding new dishes to the menu, but don't wait too long to try them because they might be cycled out once they add more. If given the choice, sit at the bar!!! You get to watch them make the deserts which is half the fun. My favorite dish was their take on an apple pie with a side of honey ice cream and a candy apple that once cracked open revealed homemade whip cream! It looked like a work of art, was fun to crack open the apple, and most importantly was delicious.

5778828,2013-08-07,6,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Opening day of Sweets Raku was pretty great. Love the simple, modern decor and that you get a high end experience, for a somewhat reasonable price. You can tell that they put a lot of thought into everything, and I love little details like the curved glasses, their utensil holders and that they made a spoon rest out spare wall tiles.

Servers are incredibly attentive and friendly - she actually remembered me from the day before when I popped in since John Curtas (mistakenly) said they were unofficially open and serving from the 5th. 

They got their liquor license quicker than expected, so they don't have wine available yet (assume that's coming soon), but they do offer yummy Illy coffee and some tempting tea selections. I went with just an iced latte $4.50, and the coffee ice cubes inside were a nice surprise since the drinks stays cold without getting watered down. 

For now, your only option is to do the three course $19 prix fixe menu w/ an amuse, choice of 3 main desserts, and petits fours. FYI maybe this will change, but it's currently an additional $12 to share - you do get a 2nd amuse and petits fours with a shared dessert. Instead of sharing, I'd suggest just paying the extra $7 so you get another main dessert as well. 

The menu is entirely edible - printed on rice paper and served with a raspberry sauce for dipping. Even the holder ring is made of pretty pulled sugar. Honestly, it wasn't particularly delish, but it's a cool concept to be able to eat your menu. 

Amuse came out quickly - it was a really refreshing mango sorbet with mint jelly. It was smooth and basically like eating a fresh mango. The jelly was minty enough that you could taste it, but not overwhelming. 

My neighbors had the strawberry/banana dessert and loved it, but I can't resist chocolate, so I went with Apollo for my main - chocolate and framboise (raspberry) mousse. The desserts are assembled to order before your eyes surprisingly quickly.   

The signature for Japanese desserts seems to be that they're never too sweet - it may end up being bland to some people, but I really like that you can focus on the flavor vs just tasting the sweetness of sugar. I love mousses, but they usually seem so heavy and rich that you feel like crap after having them. This was somehow really light with the chocolate and raspberry perfectly balanced. I kind felt like there was too much going on w/ all the other components, but it made for a beautiful dish - almost too pretty to eat. 

The petits fours was a mini chocolate lava cake w/ little raspberry and passion fruit marshmellows on the side, and some random raisins too. It's pretty small, about 2"" diameter but it's a petits fours, so you should kind of expect that. Don't expect your typical lava cake, because again, they go light on the sugar so it seemed super chocolatey to me. Kind of like a good quality dark chocolate vs a cheap hershey bar. It was a great way to end the meal. The timing of that last course was a little off - it took a while to arrive since they had to bake it, but she did mention up front that it would take time.

I actually went by myself because nobody wanted to spend $20 on dessert, but it wasn't awkward since everything came out relatively fast and sitting at the counter has kind of a more communal feel. So I did end up chatting with strangers a bit. It was overall a fun and fancy dessert experience without being the least bit pretentious. 

I can't really say these were mind blowing desserts, and if you prefer really sweet things, this may not be the place for you. But for the service level, and the fact that they're basically making art before your eyes, I think it's worth the $19 price. It's about the experience, and it's definitely a great date spot. The server even chased me down in the parking lot to give me an opening day giftbag with a chocolate cake, mini madelines and an almond cookie. She was too cute.  

I don't know that this is really a negative, but I was a little surprised that there was really nothing asian about any of the desserts - I kind of expected more Japanese influenced flavors like matcha and yuzu. But the menu is supposed to constantly change, so  who knows for the future",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,10,9,4,Lyuub_un0UNqQVCRW6BmSw
5790041,2017-10-14,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Would describe this place not as a sweets cafe, but more of a patiesserie school tester, but you'll have to pay for all that you test.

They stopped providing the edible menus (which was part of the cool experience before) and now only offer it on special occasions. I imagine valentines or christmas or something like that. 

I tried two different cakes this time, and though it was good, it was not extraordinary for me. The price is a bit steep for what you get. 

However, I wouldn't knock out their food items next time around. A couple sitting close by was eating some food along with their AYCD wine, which was quite affordable.

5863652,2015-12-31,7,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I am speechless.  I am so blown away by this place I can't think of the right word to describe the experience.  I say experience because it truly is.  This is not your typical dessert place with display shelves full of pastries, cakes, etc.  There really isn't anything to display other than its huge selection of wine, because all the main pastry items (more like works of art) are all made fresh in front of you.  If you sit at the counter you can watch the pastry chefs make your desserts right in front of you.  These aren't simple desserts that can be put together with a simple frosting or decoration; these require careful attention to detail and numerous steps to put together.  Watching them make the dessert was just as enjoyable as eating it.

Sweets Raku is set up more like a full service restaurant.  I don't think there's even a to go option. You grab whatever seats that are available and wait for someone to give you a menu.  You can go a la carte or go with its two-course dessert set ($15), which includes a choice of main dessert and another appetizer style dessert of the day.  On the day we visited it was a choice of two types of sorbets.  You can also add a pairing wine for $7 extra.

My wife and I went with the two course dessert set and chose Ringo (apple pie with honey ice cream and candy apple) and Blueberry Champagne sorbet.  We also ordered wine flight which was served in test tubes over ice.

Ringo was a dessert like no other.  It truly was a work of art.  I don't think I can ever eat any other apple pie after this.  The crust on the apple pie was hot, crispy, flaky with just the right amount of buttery taste.  The apple filling was crisp, sweet, and tart, just the way it should be.  The honey ice cream was well balanced with a perfect amount of sweetness.  The most interesting part was the candy apple.  It wasn't a real candy apple but a delicate candy shell made in house to make it look like an apple.  It was filled with house made whip cream and caramel sauce.  Watching the pastry chefs make this was truly priceless.  

When I hear sorbet it just sounds really boring, but the sorbet we tried here was nothing like ones we had in the past.  It came in three layers with a slightly frozen fruit layer at the bottom; a silky white, mousse-like layer in the middle; and a gelatin layer at the top.  I'm not sure exactly what the middle layer was made with but it seemed like an egg white mixture, similar to a meringue but in a more liquid form. Overall combination was very refreshing and not too sweet.  It had little bit of carbonation, which wasn't surprising given the name Blueberry Champagne sorbet.

Mio Ogasawara won the Pastry Chef of the Year award from Desert Companion in 2013.  We feel honored she made our dessert on the night we visited.

Sweets Raku is definitely the most yelp-worthy place I visited in 2015, which is why I saved it as the last review of this year, and my 600th review.  My wife and I will be doing a back-to-back visits to Raku and Sweets Raku every year from now on.",LGa1GmTItb4bu6HI7KPKfA,15,12,5,9DmrFImqqsCWAeA775PPtw

We accidentally got dropped off here by our taxi rather than at Raku, for dinner. Luckily, they are in the same strip mall so we trotted off to Raku, only to find we had about an hour wait. When on vacation, there are no rules, so we traced our path back to Sweets Raku and had dessert first!

This place is tiny (a few tables and the dessert bar where you can sit and watch them make your courses). It's all white and the servers are very sweet. For $19, you get a 3-course prix fixe dessert service like none other. 

They start by bringing you a rolled up menu with a gold ring encircling it. After picking what you want, they pour a raspberry sauce on a plate and you dip you menu in it and eat it. Not only unique, it was actually quite good. You can even eat the gold ring.

After the menu eating, you start with an Amuse. Ours was mango sorbet with mint jelly. I'll be honest, it looked and sounded not so good. But damn if it wasn't good! Super refreshing.

Then you pick your main dessert from four selections. I chose the coconut panna cotta and my daughter had the pistachio & chocolate mousse. Both excellent and unique. They topped mine with some sort of wafer, poured sauce on top of that, and instead of overflowing, it melted or collapsed the wafer and the liquid into the serving dish. A show and a dessert in one.

You end with a petit four, equally odd and equally good. It's really hard to explain so I'll just suggest that you go there some time and try it. It's worth it and if you're a visitor like me, it's so refreshing to get off the Strip for just one evening.

I also had an excellent cappucino with my dessert, complete with a crystalized sugar stick.

There are videos on Facebook regarding this place but they run out of everything before closing and the desert remaining are the ones that don't taste that great.",3o5RxAwstVARRW-SW66T6g,1,0,2,swqfCmocb1wYFk8dLUNyZg
5960239,2016-08-19,6,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"It took me forever and a day to finally visit Sweets Raku and then I made two visits in one week! It makes me feel like kicking myself for not visiting sooner. 

It's the tiniest, cutest little shop and despite the small location and the long line it's well worth the wait. 

I ordered different treats on each occasion and they were all excellent. Japanese desserts are some of my favorite since I don't have much of a sweet tooth and they are perfectly suited to my palette. 

Delicate flavors and beautiful presentations are the name of the game here, I can't wait to visit again soon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,21,14,5,9E_N4z7bvkJw2eXmyl2Zlw
5961922,2016-12-27,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"After our lunch and massage, I was in the mood for some dessert. Sweets Raku has amazing ratings and we decided to check it out. We were seated at the counter, which gave us a perfect view of the dessert-making process. I ordered the two-course menu, which came with the sorbet of the day and one ""main"" dessert.

The sorbet was a refreshing raspberry flavored one with yogurt on top. I love that Asian desserts in general are not too sweet and this one had a good amount of tartness.

All of the main desserts looked interesting and I decided to order Mars, which is an orb that is then flambed with brandy. The presentation was cool but I have to give it 4 stars because I did not like the taste of this dessert. The brandy pooled at the bottom of the plate and the flavor of hard alcohol was so strong, I had a hard time eating it. Perhaps my experience would've been better if I had tried a different dessert.

If you do not love brandy, then skip Mars.",2HchhLgGj16aITZGVy0hqA,1,1,4,eCeGKADgMHd8QecoLU_2gw
5965817,2015-09-19,0,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,I've been wanting to try this place for years and finally got a chance to last night with my fellow foodie! The staff is incredibly friendly and the desserts were to die for! My friend and I got the Chef's Special and the two course set (Carib and sorbet). I love Japanese desserts because their not too sweet and have a bunch of fruits! The presentation of the desserts were too pretty to eat but made my tummy absolutely happy. Definitely going again and trying something new with wine.,0Md3sO3sRR3GE4eQLtqZbw,0,0,5,ay882jDDFFqLUjPMg5p46g
5974100,2015-09-24,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"they have a minimum order of one main course per person, so do not eat too much before going!

environment: the wine wall and open kitchen were both very unique and amazing touches! 

staff: everyone was extremely sweet and the chefs were incredibly talented.

dessert: i ordered the chef's special with the mt. fuji (new item) and the mango sorbet with mint jelly. it was not a well thought out combination as these items did not pair well, but each item was exquisite on it's own. the mint jelly was delicious! such a simple concept, but it was made perfectly and really complimented the sorbet. THE MT. FUJI WAS AMAZING!! the presentation was lovely, the cake was soft and spongy, and the icing was not too sweet. 

overall, this place SLAYED! i cannot wait to go back.",Qam8ZxHCH-jPCMq0HQbQ7Q,3,2,5,ZfiwNaMHpQ_uF4UViRwwow

Tiny 12 seat dessert bar and everything made in front of you! My paradise! 

They offered a 15$ dessert with sorbet option otherwise the desserts are 12$ 

Everything from the strawberry sorbet (with jello) to the sizzling grand marnier drizzle. This place is a must visit! They said they change their desserts out every season, looking forward to coming back. 

Amazing!!",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,2,1,5,-7DQDEOqlBqjhHePY7zR2g
5979190,2014-06-04,3,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"I really liked the concept / presentation of this place and it was definitely a good experience for date night. It was fun to sit at the bar and watch the ladies prepare all the desserts. 

My boyfriend and I both ordered the prix fixe menu, which included an amuse bouche (mango sorbet), a main course (we chose red rock and the stella), and a cream puff (cream + jam of your choice).

Service as alright. When we came in there weren't many people there so they seated us promptly, but then we had to sit there awkwardly for a little while. A drink list was brought out. They asked us what we wanted to drink, but I ended up not ordering any wine because I wanted to see what the desserts were before I decided. There's a $7 wine tasting pairing that you can get with the dessert, so I ended up doing that since they had already taken the drink menu away. Since only one person is preparing the dessert, my main course came out well before my boyfriend's. Since it had some ice cream / gelato / something frozen on the side, I wanted to eat it before it melted. His came out after I finished. They also forgot about my wine pairing, so they comped it. I think the entire glass with wine had also been in the refrigerator. 

The dessert was also alright. Nothing phenomenal, but very pretty. Good for an occasion, but I won't be rushing back here just to eat.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,5,1,3,KcX5Hk7bhzCNjVw9zvXegw

5983566,2016-08-19,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Good thing I came here by myself because I didn't have to wait as long as the rest. I felt bad for the larger groups who have to wait FOREVER. There are only about 13-14 seats at the bar and only 5-6 small tables here. 

I had the pleasure of sitting at the bar, so I got front row seats to all the action. It's quite amazing seeing them work their magic in creating these elegant desserts. The amount of attention to detail that is required to make each individual one... No wonder it takes some time to get your dessert. Trust me the wait is worth it. Try to get a seat at the bar if possible.

This is my first time eating a 2 course dessert: Main dessert + sorbet. 
I ordered the Spring Mountain, which consisted of a pistachio cream cake with strawberry and raspberry mousse on top of chocolate cake with pie crust. Omg it was fantastic! The mousse was very light and not overwhelmingly sweet. The pie crust was crispy and flaky with just the right amount of firmness. The chocolate cake was moist and light as well. Expertly crafted.
On this particular day, the sorbet was pineapple and coconut which I was hesitant about because I'm not a coconut fan. However the sorbet was fantastic! If you can get me to like something I normally don't like, then you've done an incredible job.",0f_0XfO2qcgNwSJAHwfR9g,5,2,5,CwVuPvZgD1p9q2N03d5Qgw
5984325,2018-03-17,1,umXvdus9LbC6oxtLdXelFQ,"Desserts: very good. Not only good for pictures and Instagram but also taste good. The presentation was great!
Location: it's in a busy area so it's hard to find parking. I usually take a Lyft. 
Price: it's a little overprice but worth it. However, because of the price so it's like a one time experience. 
Wine: different wine recommended with different desserts were great.",vrn199rhw6WKNrafiBHipQ,1,1,4,ZZWcW9VhgoFBQwP3e8RBCg

They have water as you walk in that I'd completely empty and dirty cups all over the floor and walls.
