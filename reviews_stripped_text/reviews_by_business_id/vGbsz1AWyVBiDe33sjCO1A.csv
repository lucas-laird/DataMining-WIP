We were dining in this cafe, We put our order in for a large cappachino and medium latte in a cup as we were dining in. We were told that they only do the tiny cups and would have to have a paper takeaway cup despite the fact that we were dining in. I requested a muffin to go with it and stayed up the counter to pay. I was totally ignored so went and sat down. Our coffee was brought to is in the takeaway cups but no muffin. When I went up to get sugar etc was asked by the girl if I had my muffin which I replied no. She proceeded to get it and brought it over to where we were sitting having out coffee  in a paper bag!!!!! I asked if I could have it on a plate as were dining in and warned up. This was begrudgingly done. While we were sitting eating the waitress came and told us we should have paid when we ordered. I replied I had been up there twice to pay and was ignored.

I went for coffee, but I was intrigued by the fairly ambitious menu so I ordered the potabello mushroom sandwich, and I was very pleased. The mushrooms had been sauteed and marinated just right so that they had that almost-meat texture that I love about portobello mushrooms. The cheese, sauteed peppers and grilled bread all stepped up their supporting roles to make for a very good sandwich.

The noise and smoke that accompany most casinos wasn't an issue here, as it is just far enough away from the casino floor that I quickly forgot I was in a casino.

I'd say this place is about as good as it can be for a casino coffee shop.",ffxJtLOxDomnZIJo-GgHcA,1,0,5,xhygJvjQc79d35d2QxSEYg

For some reason the panini's took a full 25 minutes to make which was getting pretty frustrating. We could see that basically only ONE employee was making the panini's and he had to make all the customers' panini's basically one at a time as they only had 1 machine to do so and limited space.

To improve the experience, I think the cashier NEEDS to let people know before they pay that ""hey just FYI it's going to be approx an 20 minute wait"" or whatever because us customers do not want to wait that long for a sandwich!!! 

Anyways...beyond that .... the paninis were actually very delicious. I enjoyed the bread they used and everything was very tasty.

There's a limited pastry case and menu of fresh salads, flat bread pizzas, and sandwiches, with a refrigerator case of grab and go options.

We walked in and started chatting it up with the worker, seeing as there was nobody else in the cafe. He was incredibly nice and helpful. He knew the menu incredibly well. I was legitimately impressed with how well he knew everything and how he could spout all this juts off the top of his head. It takes dedication to get to that point so I admire his persistence. 

The reason I am putting it as only a 3 star is because we both ordered a chai tea latte and both of our drinks had very little flavor and were not that great. Neither of us were incredibly impressed with the quality of our drink. I would be willing to try it again but I wouldn't be getting that drink. 

Ultimately, don't go out of your way to go here but if you're around go ahead. There are many other places around where you can get a better drink.",oqQ9nGfN_z82nfcoQAxxmA,1,0,3,6voi9imEBek1GYhFy3CyEQ

I ate a slice and it was awesome!  I highly recommend this for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

When trying a place that I'm unsure of I usually order my cappuccino dry as poor baristas tend to kill 2 shots of espresso with too much, too hot, not enough foam steamed milk.

So I ordered my cappuccino ""a little dry"" and got 2 shots of espresso with too much, too hot, no foam steamed milk.  20 minutes later I'm still waiting for it to cool to the point where it is at least drinkable, knowing the coffee has been killed by the hot milk.

The service was good for a walk-up counter coffee shop and my pastry was nice but forgettable. I would like to revisit the coffee though. I had a small cappuccino which came in Italian style, foamy and without latte art. It was not overly foamy and the temperature was acceptable though i would call it on the hot side for a cappuccino. No complaints on the shot though, excellent pull of some Stumptown.

What is going to pull this place down is the sterile hotel lobby interior and elevator music, it feels geared towards conventioners and AARP members. It was very clean on a positive note, i would just advise inquiring about outside seating (also note that there is serious smoke smell wafting in from the casino floor). Also a big plus is the prices are awesome, like cheaper than most neighborhood cafes but with better beans.

In addition to the great coffee & bakery items, there is a great food menu.  The food menu has paninis, pizzas, salads, charcuterie, etc.

My favorite part of all though is the craft beer selection.  They have an outstanding selection of local craft beers, like Joseph James and Tenaya Creek.  Moreover, they have an amazing selection of Belgians, including my favorite Rochefort.  You'll also find other Trappist beers, Rodenbach Grand Cru, Duvel, and more.

The atmosphere is very warm and inviting.  It's a comfortable atmosphere and there's a nice patio outside as well.  Also, the service is really friendly.  The staff really tries hard and even seem to know some of my preferences.  Best of all, prices are really reasonable.

We also split the veggie board which had my favorite SF Cowgirl Creamery cheese (Barely Buzzed)!

Say whaaa?!

Cold brew coffee, that's what.
Not new news, but Caffé Bottega in the Tuscany Casino is serving Stumptown Coffee Roasters cold brew coffee. After recently visiting the Pacific Northwest, I didn't realize what a strong presence Stumptown coffee had there until I left. Strangely enough, I was on a tea binge at the time and subconsciously avoided coffee altogether (yes, I am looking at you S***bucks). My curiosity for Stumptown brought me on an adventure all the way to the Tuscany Casino.

From the main entrance of Tuscany Casino, go right to an almost hidden cafe. I was immediately enticed by the sweet goodies in the case, which had pastries and donuts. I went with a buttermilk bar (square shaped one) and wow, it was yummy. 5/5

The highly anticipated cold brew, was a bit disappointing. Compared to other places in town, I was not impressed. Cold brew is supposed to have a less acidic and bitter taste. This version was acidic. There were some fruity and floral tones present. I did not finish my drink. 3/5

The baristas were warm, friendly, and helpful.  They do sell Stumptown coffee by the bag for $16.",OPJ0TW8tt5UanY2_YpCgIQ,7,7,4,hqyP8oLvrzAxH28ULjaE6A
