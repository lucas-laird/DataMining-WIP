My order was given to me at 1622, 16 minutes after placing the order. In the mean time 7 customers were served in the drive through.

The employees are cool. They all seem to get along and laugh together. Quick customer service indoor and drive thru.

Great value menu. I'll have one of each item :P for my slight fast food binge. Would you care for some brain freeze? There's frosted Coca Cola flavors! Yet another bonus, their soda fountain is a fun touch screen that dispenses a large fruit variety of Sprite! I tried peach! Yaaaaheheeyyyyy!

How much could they save by putting a decent piece of lettuce on your sandwich? They had 2 whoppers for $6, by the time we added one order of fries and 2 drinks, we paid as much as 2 value meals with 2 orders of fries and 2 drinks.  The kid at the counter should have suggested that. So now I feel I didn't get a good sandwich or a good value.  Guess what? In-n-Out Burger, McDonalds, Smashburger, Red Robin, Fatburger, Five Guys, Shake Shack all have decent hamburgers. Too bad this place is convenient but I won't be stopping there anymore.

Why, you may ask, is the drive thru so important? Because as I drove by the main entrance to this Burger King, there were FIVE Burger King employees  standing no more than 2 feet away from the front door, ALL smoking cigarettes. These were not ecigs,  these were cancer causing, polluting cigarettes filling the air and no doubt entering the air within the restaurant, as the door was wide open.  Had I been trying to enter the actual restaurant with my small children, I would have turned around and left, choosing to protect my off spring from your 2nd hand smoke.

It is 2 stories with a lot of room for the kiddos to run around in.  There is pretty limited seating for adults though with only 3 tables available.

I only came for a ice cream sundae after Savers, and I went through the drive through.

SOOOOO if youre going to try and enter after leaving Chase, Savers, or any of those places you technically are supposed to go all the way around to enter. I was like wtf? and just went through anyway bc I had already pulled half way in. So I proceed to order my ice creams and the guy was ok, not amazing or super nice just ok. Service was quick but he gave me a dumb look when I asked him for a cup holder for 3 sundaes and a cup of water... hello bro! I dont have 4 cup holders!
