Food was very yummy but very small servings - I guess that's tapas for you! 

Cucumber Mist cocktail was great. 

Fantastic view. Best to request a window seat or even a table on the patio. Sat by the window and we weren't disappointed.",bhpl4CYM2C1S_hEwZOqAfA,2,0,4,Gt0lL_LUDX28SNw41jm3bw
30733,2015-04-23,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"My friend and I dined here on April 20th. It had only been open to the public for about a week and I must say everything was amazing. We were seated right away for our reservations even though the place was very busy. The restaurant is very bright, not your typical Vegas dining so we were kind of caught off guard by that. But nonetheless, it is gorgeous inside with a beautiful, contemporary feel that has an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. They do recommended 3-4 plates per person but I think that is kind of a lot for two females. We had the bruschetta, margarita pizza, red wine risotto, lamb ragu pasta and the filet with Gorgonzola cheese. By the time the filet came out we were already so full. We didn't have anything to drink since we were going out right after but some of the neighboring tables' cocktails looked amazing. Our bill came out to be around $80 which we thought was pretty cheap with the quality of food. Everything tasted amazing and I cannot wait to come back again. The lamb ragu pasta is a must! Probably one of the best pastas I have had. Also, the margarita pizza was amazing too.  The service was awesome too. I'm very happy Bellagio added this new restaurant and I think it will be doing great there!",ax1IN_M-Z5w1icCPB2DQzQ,2,1,5,ZOy99oUe8tvV6skTDqjEug

The ambiance is amazing particularly if you can get on the veranda and dine outdoors with a view of the fountain. I was so disappointed in the food we were served. We were served three starters: a bruschetta that was delightful, a flatbread that was ok and a scallop sashimi that was fine. Next course was two kinds of risotto - both were bland and undercooked. Next we were served three meat dishes: a steak and potatoes dish - meat was under seasoned as well, meatballs - which looked fantastic, but alas were not seasoned well, and a white fish - not bad. I did not get to see a menu or order my own food, so I don't know if dining off the menu would have been different, but I was severely underwhelmed by what we did get. It is Such a beautiful location and my dining expectations were not met. The 6 other people I was sitting nearest also felt the same.",fX031g2u0PRVKFfnJWWOUQ,1,0,2,_yRjzhsRAwHMYYyLSRorAQ

120003,2015-05-11,2,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Please keep in mind while reading this that many of the 4 and 5 star reviews on Yelp are by people who were provided a free meal and gift card for the opening of this restaurant (marked Elite'15)...

Perhaps this restaurant isn't meant to be geared towards a medium sized group in their 30's. The room we wound up in was an odd L shape with our table wedged in the corner like a bad afterthought. In order for one person to get out the entire side of the table had to get up. Our server kept insisting the best idea was to order a bunch of items and that the table share them to get to try everything. That concept doesn't really work here since some items are just 1-2 pieces of food.  How do you share one scallop with the table?  The better idea is to stick with getting 2-3 plates per person.  I like the small plates concept and chose several other restaurants during my visit to Vegas that used it and seemed to execute it better.

The food was prepared well and the flavors were good - but that's just it - it was only ""good"".  Not great, not amazing... just good.  With the total bill the size it was, I expect more than ""good"".  It certainly wasn't innovative with the flavors and menu items. There are certainly better options on the strip for the same prices with better menus, experience, and flavor.  You probably have a local place serving modern Italian and doing it better than Lago is, so skip this while in Vegas.

The bar/lounge area was the nicest part of the restaurant, but with a large group, their iPad menu made drink ordering extremely slow since they only had one to give us for 6 people.  Staff was friendly and attentive and worked so well together it was hard to believe this place opened only a few weeks ago!",qkjJwm4lNtpUbWrVvUcNaw,1,0,2,6J3x5zCoMG-JTdvjR7gttw

142212,2016-06-17,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"My friends and I went to Lago for Restaurant Week 2016.  The ""Week"" menu was a great offering of the menu items.  We arrived early and gathered at the bar for a drink.  Instead, we bought a bottle of wine as it was more economical.  The bartender, Christopher, was fabulous.  Gold star for Christopher!  He let us taste a couple of different wines before we bought our bottle.  We chatted with Christopher for a bit and then wandered to our table.

I was not terribly impressed with our service after we left Christopher.  While the we were there early, and there were lots of wait staff milling about, it was an ordeal to get a basket of bread.  It was also an ordeal to get a second bottle of wine.  However, amazingly when it was time to pay, staff were readily available -- a personal pet peeve of mine!   

Our first course of the five course ""Week"" offering came immediately.  However, there was a huge time gap to get our second course.  We were NEVER given clean eating utensils between courses, which I found strange given this is a upscale, pricey establishment.  Another irritating issue was there was no clear path to move around in the restaurant.  Excusing oneself to use the restroom was like playing the game Operation in that I hoped to not knock somebody's arm, purse, table or plate of food.  The tables were close together and in a random set up.  

With that being said, the FOOD was FABULOUS.  It was all very tasty with unusual offerings.  I cannot complain about a single offering.  Each person in my group picked a different offering, and we shared the plates around the table.  I can confidently say that there was not a disappointed person in the group.  THE FOOD MADE UP FOR THE OTHER SHORTCOMINGS.

Finally, let me take this minute to vent about the MGM properties (Bellagio) and the new pay to park policy.  it is bull crap!  I had to wait in a line to get off the Strip into the parking garage, and while I am a local, I still resent that fact that the MGM thinks I need to pay to spend money in their properties.  Each member in my group spend over $150 per person to dine.  What an insult to think at some point we will also have to spend an additional $10 per car to dine.  Quite frankly, if this day arrives, I will not be frequenting Lago's or other fine dining establishments in MGM properties, or if I do, it will be few and far between!   I hope the restaurants who are owned by outside companies take note of this issue and do something about it!",jU_e9Psd4mOIasHfMnieGQ,1,0,4,p5VOFMEkJ0Ch1xI_fzsl3Q
143500,2016-03-14,2,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Lago is a must-go! The ambiance of this place alone is enough to keep me coming back. That in addition to superb service and exceptional food makes this one of my favorite dining options on the strip. I walked in and was greeted by two very friendly hostesses. I was meeting friends and as soon as I sat down a server handed me a menu and asked for my drink order. I had a mimosa which was made perfectly and garnished with beautiful sugar work and a glitter dusted raspberry. My server was so patient with me even though I changed my order and was very indecisive. I started with the ahi and then I had the eggplant parmesan benny. Definitely order the Benedict, it was to die for! I finished off with the desert tastings. I have to say I felt like an un-attended minor at a birthday party because I had no self control and had a little bit of everything! I loved that there was such a variety so it was good for everyone in our group. From fresh fruit to a chocolate fountain, they had it all. My personal favorites were the crepes and the fruit tarts. 
Overall, would definitely recommend. Perfect for a girls outing or a cute date. This place will not disappoint.",6fBV8MB549fA5G1NmtRkVg,1,0,5,SHbmX8aAgA-tKkPorW9HDw

This would have been a 3 star review, but it will only be 2 stars because the manager behaved incredibly patronizing towards us when we asked for the (rather expensive) red wine not to be served extremely chilled, but at a normal drinkable temperature. Arguing with your customers, telling them to ""google it"" (which we did and google agreed with us for the record) and that they are wrong and have no idea is simply rude and terrible customer service and ruined the whole meal. 
It was a shame because the location of the restaurant is great and the view is stunning and as said above the service overall was very friendly and efficient.

432339,2015-05-14,2,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"I'm a foodie & dine all over the Las Vegas Strip Resorts 4-6 times a year, but rarely endorse any restaurants...I also don't like to drop names or status & everyone that knows me knows how humble & generous I am...I even paid for an elderly lady's gelato, at a dessert shop, that night because no one wanted to translate in Spanish & she just wanted one scoop.

Having that said...Management at Lago are a piece of $#!+ (PoS). We made reservations the minute reservations opened over a month ago & physically went there the night of our reservations to request Patio/Fountain outdoor seating...They told us to come back 45mins after our reservation & the outdoor seating was ours. They call us 45mins later & gave us ""highchairs tables"" near the bar...It's Mothers Day Weekend & my Mom is reaching 80yrs old, how do you expect her to climb onto a highchair?!? Management tells me that the whole restaurant is booked & we just gave your seats and 4 other couples' seats to a party of 10 WITHOUT RESERVATIONS because we know large groups are better clients...Really?!? WTF?!? Don't give me a lecture on that type of research & statistics...I drop 10X the average US household income at the Bellagio & Aria every year and I don't have to walk around in large groups.

I feel sorry for the 4 other couple that took whatever crap management gave them...I literally had to argue with them to get a table & get off the high table w/ high chairs.

It was too late to dine elsewhere so we did end up dining there...The food is excellent (took pics of each dish), but so is Picasso at Bellagio Resort & Juslian Serrano at Aria Resort. It is mainly Italian cuisine served tapas style, so expect to order 5 to 7 dishes & one main-course per person. Enjoy the wonderful food, just arrive early to make sure you have room to put up w/ their crap...Or arrive in a large group & hog the restaurant patio WITHOUT a reservation.

Chef Julian Serrano, if you read this I challenge you to fire the manager that was working May 9th & let me (someone like me) take over, for a fraction of his salary...In return I ask for equity on that establishment. I assure you that if you don't put a performance matrix on management, they WILL bring your restaurant down.

Food wise, the restaurant serves most of its portions appetizer size, so you'll probably need to order 3ish dishes per person to get full.  That being said though, the food is utterly excellent.  We ordered the ribs, scallops, rapini, duck, mushrooms, and clams.  The seafood was very fresh, and was, for lack of better terms, really really good.  The ribs were ridiculously tender - how did they do it!?  It also tasted incredible, and the duck was done perfectly as well.  I know rapini and mushrooms are just veggies, but they too were of the highest quality.  The dishes are around the $20 mark each, so it's around the same price as the higher-end buffets if you go with the 3 portions per person formula, but I'd say the quality is definitely a step up, even compared to a place like Bacchanal.  Service was excellent as well - staff were friendly and knowledgeable, and definitely added to a positive experience.

I'd be remiss to finish this review though without talking about the view.  The ""reverse"" view of the fountains, looking out towards Paris, is phenomenal.  I highly recommend getting to Lago a bit before your reservation to try and secure a patio seat - they're given on a first come and first serve basis, and for the most part, can't be reserved (you can make reservations for indoor seating, and getting there before your reservation time gives you a better chance of securing a patio seat in the event that one opens up).  It's hard to hear the music the fountains are dancing to from the patio (you can still make it out, but you have to try), but the spectacle is wonderful regardless.  I've posted a couple of pictures of the view to try and illustrate what it's like, but nothing beats being there.  

What more can I say?  Excellent food, impeccable service, and one of the great (if not the greatest) restaurant views in Vegas - the best meal I had on my trip, and an easy 5/5.",RikKhfqQMc5EtSHWWI5j2g,4,1,5,AYx8hCi1bAoA2YUhnLbkgA

Service was awesome, especially for just opening this month. We got sat promptly with great views of the Bellagio Fountains. Best view on the Strip. Restaurant was lively and energetic. Love it. 

The offerings at Lago were really unique and really good. Our waiter explained to us that we should be ordering 3-4 dishes per person which sounds like a lot, but turned out perfect. Prices ranged from $10 to $20 each plate which is pretty normal for a nice dinner on the Strip when you do the math. The margherita pizza and ricotta cheese pizza were awesome. The Fusillioro pasta served with lamb ragu and ricotta cheese was delicious. 

We also ordered one ""main course"" (these are a bit larger than the small plates)...the veal shank, as recommended by our waiter and it was some of the most tender meat I've ever had.

I love eating at Bellagio and definitely expect great food and service when I'm there, but wow, Lago is above and beyond.

You could never tell it just opened this week. Service was amazing! It's shared plates-style dining so the dishes are small but plenty, which is awesome because you get to try so many flavors. Our server was welcoming and explained the dishes and cocktails in great detail. 

Speaking of dishes and cocktails, OMG. Chef Serrano does an exceptional job adding exciting twists to Italian classics with five-star presentations. The ""7&7"" (lobster and gnocchi) is to die for, and the salmon and scallop crudo (served raw with lemon aioli and some blood orange awesomeness) are ridiculous! The cocktails paired well with the food and were presented unlike any way I've ever seen. My bellini even came with a gold-dusted raspberry.

Perhaps the best part of dinner was the atmosphere. Very lively and modern with great vibes. Floor-to-ceiling views of the Bellagio Fountains--just breathtaking!

Beef Carpaccio - 3/5 If your in Bellagio just go to Olives for this. After eating it there anywhere else you have it will seem sub par. Lago's version can't even begin to compare to Olives. 

Kobe Beef - 0/5 The meat itself was literally the size of a matchbook, I knew it would be tiny but was still excited to try it. I cut the meat up (even though it was itty bitty bc I was trying to be dainty). Question, Have you ever bit into a piece of meat that made your mouth water, looked tender and flavorful only to have an explosion of grease fill your mouth? Ya me neither and it caught me off guard. I couldn't even finish this TINY sad piece of meat that's how bad it was. Was it deep fried? We paid $39 for this?..this animal died for you to turn it into something completely inedible. Shame. On.

Fusilli Ragu - 4/5 Had great flavor but the pasta was overcooked..like I had to scoop this shit bc it fell apart. Im not a stickler for al dente but this was ridiculous. Everyone liked the flavor though.

My background is I'm an Event Planner.. With that being said I always look for Customer Service FIRST. I 've been a regular visitor to Las Vegas for over 30 years! My recent location to stay is the Mandalay Bay. I am the type where I usually get all Accommodations comped! Room, Food, Beverage. 
This was a trip we've been planning for years... Finally my Baby was turning 21! Her ultimate plan was to go to VEGAS!! 
Having a ton of experiences with MANY restaurants there I searched for days trying to find the perfect fit for my daughters 21 Bday dinner! There was 6 of us and I wanted an Experience plus amazing Food and of course impeccable service! So of all the Restaurants we could choose from... We chose Lago! 
It had the Water Show view, (experience), Great reviews on the Food (amazing Food) Great Service (Impeccable service) We only found those things out by reading these reviews and asking those who were familiar.

That turned out to be quite a bit difference from what we read... 
The Food Was AMAZING!!! The Server (I believe her name was Monique was AMAZING)
But we had to get past the WORST part first! Dealing with Albert Najem (the GM)

We made reservations on Open Table, made it VERY CLEAR it was a Special Occasion and Requested to sit by the window for the water show...
I then called the hotel and asked to talk to someone inside the restaurant (not a call center) I made sure I was talking to someone in the restaurant. They claimed they were one of the hostess in the restaurant! I confirmed that we would be seated by the window and that was one of the main reasons were were coming...
I also said that we will be arriving in in a limo with a time the limo would be waiting to take us back and they said our seating request and timing would be fine!!

So here we go..........When we arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservations we were greeted by Albert Najem (General Manager) he told us without hesitation that there was over an hr wait for the tables by the window... I said we had reservations specifically for that and told him I even followed up with a confirmation to the restaurant... He still said well I cant help that. his demeanor was very condescending and he really didnt care that I was so upset! 
He then offered us 2 other tables (1 being in the middle of the room- only being able to see the water in the sky... and the other a small shoved in the corner table with our backs to the water) he couldn't have been more UN accommodating. Didn't care that I took so much to make this reservation... was REALLY POMPOUS! He offered no gestures of an apology except for the sending over 2  Lemonchellos (1 for me and 1 for my daughter) TOTALLY CLASSLESS! At least i could have been a round... We never ordered them... we all had ordered drinks and he could have easily come over to say im taking care of your drinks and dessert... 
I then asked our server to have him come over... he did and I told him the least he could do was comp our drinks... you would have thought I asked him to take care of the entire restaurants dinners checks!

The reviews and photos looked pretty good through Yelp so we made an appointment really quickly (the morning of, maybe about an hour earlier) and went for lunch.

The decor was not appealing (for me), but couldn't judge too much on this as most Vegas restaurants are the same caliber in design. One great thing was that they gave us seats along the windows, which overlooks Bellagio's famous fountain. The restaurant was not full, so all the customers had at least some kind of view of the water show!

The customer service was good, nothing bad nor absolutely amazing. But the food was just okay - nothing was really delicious. We got the Agnolotti di Vitello (veal ricotta stuffing) and Ravioli al Gamberi (shrimp) and both were mediocre. The agnolotti was at least interesting, but we didn't really fancy the taste much - though eating it with the dark sauce definitely helped. The ravioli was really just underwhelming with a simple tomato sauce - just super basic and the tomato sauce was too bland and didn't have much character for my taste.

All in all, it was just an okay restaurant - everything's overpriced in Vegas so I'm not necessarily looking down on the pasta prices because it's just a bit over the ""average"" we'd pay in LA (agnolotti being $17 and ravioli being $18).

The customers next to us got the pizza and that looked pretty good - though, pizza is tough to mess up!",WFC0uljJ1RURQvSkiP8wvQ,1,0,3,EZirXAWuJ2so0YHaFlkcNg

Lago serves small plates for sharing, think of Spanish ""tapas"", except Italian. They do have some ""main-course"" meals, which may make sense if you are eating alone, but part of the great appeal of Lago for my wife and I was being able to order a selection of wonderfully prepared dishes without stuffing ourselves. 

When I made the reservation, I asked for a patio seat. It turned out to be one of the coldest days in Las Vegas. I asked the hostess if we should sit inside near the windows instead and she said that they heated the patio and suggested we take a look first. Glad we did. With the heaters we were comfortable. Some other folks had light coats on, but we had just come in from Minneapolis, so perhaps our tolerance for ""cool"" weather was higher :-)

I highly recommend sitting on the patio. Being able to watch the fountain as you eat really adds to the experience. Actually, I would only want to sit on the patio or next to the large windows overlooking the fountains. We had an early reservation, so had no issues having our seating requests accommodated (though I also make the request when making the reservation).

Congratulations and thank you for what you have contributed to Las Vegas and to countless of food lovers.

Your dishes continues to be true to form.  Based of time proven classic cuisine and delivered with flair.

On behalf of all those you have trained during the years I say than you as well.

My meal was spectacular.  The service was spectacular.  The view, pretty much speaks for itself.

My only regret is San Francisco loosing you to Las Vegas.

Still nice to know I can always come and visit and ALWAYS have a spectacular meal as long as you are at the helm.

When we arrived at the restaurant they said they couldn't seat us at a table with a view of the fountains for another 90 minutes, and the restaurant was really bright inside.  We said we would try somewhere else.  I went back to confirm something with the time, and magically, they were able to seat us at a table with a view.  That was REALLY irritating.

However, I must say the wait and bus staff were excellent.  There were plenty of people around and our server was particularly visible, helpful and available.  Because this is a tapas restaurant that is KEY.

Some of the highlights were:

Crostini with chicekn liver 
Scallops with orange and pistachio
meatballs
Risotto with tripe and mushrooms (I never had tripe before, but this was a good dish)

The crostini with salami and gorgonzola was just ok, as were the baramundi,

RISOTTO AL VINO ROSSO

CANNELLONI

The best thing about it is the environment, that's it.

Quality salmon should melt in your mouth and have a rich flavor. Next we tasted the gnocchi with lobster and then the shrimp stuffed squid. The gnocchi appeared cooked and then broiled, which I know can be done, but shouldn't be. It tasted like they had cooked the gnocchi earlier in the day and then reheated it to get a bit of a crunch.  Good gnocchi should be light and tasty. This was chewy. The lobster tasted of nothing. The shrimp stuffed squid was the worst dish of the evening. The squid was super chewy like eating a rubber band.

We were then seated in a corner, small table, with literally no view of the fountains. My wife received a rose upon seating, which was a nice touch.

Our waiter could have cared less about serving us, even after we ordered a $180 bottle of wine (having said that, the person keeping our wine glasses full, who was not our waiter, was very kind and attentive). We went easily 20-minutes without seeing him, and when it was time to pay the bill, he disappeared for 30 minutes (seriously, we timed him); upon which I went to the bar to ask if I could pay there.

Everything was fresh, and the flavors went very very well together.  The gnocchi with lobster knuckles was AMAZING as was the canneloni. The service was also impeccable.  Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing and took notice of the fact that I was OBSESSED with the Bellagio fountains - he offered to walk me to their outside tables and take my picture while the fountains were going. so sweet!

The only thing I would change was (1) we ordered a bottle of champagne that came out after almost all of our tapas were out (5 dishes).  That was a little late for the champagne for me... I think they could have brought out a few dishes and held off on the others while they waited for the champagne to chill. just IMO.  (2) the red wine risotto we had was heavy on the wine and low on the other flavors. since we ended with this dish, it left a sort of sour taste but we let it go since everything else was SO good.",Rgf9lI8RTU5q8-rc5wwklA,0,0,4,a3jt96gm7B0Ti9ZIGuyB4g

1166480,2015-04-20,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"A reason to return to the Bellagio! Something new and exciting at the former Circo property by Julian Serrano. The renovation was well worth the wait and one of my top places that I was anticipating. We were greeted at the front by very friendly hostesses that informed us we were free to view the restaurant while we waited. Wannee was especially helpful and informed that our beautiful table on the patio was ready and what a beautiful night it was to be outside.
The room is very modern European with a nod to retro.  The color scheme starts with warm orange and red tones near the front, then graduates to cooler blues in the back of the restaurant with white the backdrop. Straight ahead is the view of the Las Vegas Strip and the famous Bellagio fountains, to the right is the lovely patio.
We were seated right at the edge just as the fountain show began, there was even fog on the water which made the view even more special. The weather was perfect and the Strip in the background was ever so pretty.

We chose a few small plates to try. Brian our server suggested the crudo sampler, there was tuna, scallops, and salmon.  We also had a Cesar salad, the risotto, short ribs, and their famous gnocchi and lobster dish that melted in your mouth! Oh I cannot forget to mention the quail saltimbocca!!! Try this twist on the classic saltimbocca, I like it much better than veal or chicken versions. They have a nice choice of cocktails and even the bartender made me Virgin cocktails that were refreshing and beautiful.

Dessert was also excellent, the menu being on same Ipad list as cocktails and wines. Very fun and interactive. Sharing is encouraged here and this is a spot pre-club kinda place. Where you can still eat good food and feel comfortable to dance the night away. Hyde is located next door and Lily and The Bank are very close.

Thank You Julian Serrano and the Bellagio for bringing me back to this end of the Strip. With Omnia across the street, I feel there is a new pulse of life into the Las Vegas dining and club scene!",voNl6rXo9c-NuYIBIj5AQg,1,1,5,THH1odYRMtA2xw0ivUBflQ

Staff that don't have a clue. Especially our server and the Manager. Food came out very late over 35 minutes for the first serving and at different times for the remaining hour. I  just wanted to have a nice dinner with friends and they had eaten and finished their dinner and my basic seafood risotto still didn't hit the table. 
I have many qualms about Lago.  First the place is so loud you cannot speak to your company.  Second the service is pushed, too intense and not at all relaxing. 
More importantly the food was just so so.  Small portions, way too small in my opinion.  10$ for three slivers of lettuce is a joke.  The Sea food Risotto was Chef Boyardee out of a can quality!!!

It was hard to carry on a conversation. Started with olive focaccia.... Tiny & too greasy. Next we had the red wine risotto and gnocchi with lobster. Risotto was absolutely fabulous!!! The gnocchi was good but it was not the consistency of either a potato or ricotta gnocchi...more like a rolled mashed potato with a firm exterior. Both portions were very small. Couple bites each. We ordered clams and the filettino for the next round. For the $$ they were both shockingly big portions and both very good. They surprised my husband with a desert for his birthday that was wonderful & very thoughtful. Even though our food & service was good we can't see ourselves going back.

1222131,2015-04-20,2,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"If you want a great dining experience, let's be honest--you can find it anywhere at Bellagio. They definitely have this whole food & beverage/amazing service thing down. Still, Lago is just beyond. From the location (floor-to-ceiling windows and even an outdoor patio overlooking the fountains--pretty flawless) to the decor (sleek, modern & gorgeous), let's just say I would be here every night if they would have me (what would it take to get my name engraved on one of those tables...?)

The menu consists of small plates meant to be shared (they recommend 3-4 plates per person), which you'll love if you're like me and want to try ALL THE THINGS. If the menu is overwhelming (everything sounds amazing. hello!), your server (shoutout to Frank!) will guide you through the best of the best.

Some of my favorites include the ""7&7"" lobster and gnocchi (want to eat this, exclusively, forever. will die happy if this is my last meal. you get it.), all the crudo plates (the scallop one is ridiculous. didn't think I liked scallops before this. game changer), the focaccine with ricotta and honey, margherita pizza and the osso buco (veal shank). I assume there's a word-count limit here, so I'll stop myself, but just know that I could go on... 

I'm still working my way through the fabulous cocktail offerings, but so far I've been blown away. No detail was overlooked in creating these beautiful drinks (the Rosso Bellini straight-up has a caramel nest propped atop the glass with a golden raspberry nestled inside. Is this real life?). The Cucumber Mist is super-refreshing, and I may or may not have had two of them back-to-back. I also loved the Passion Fruit Mojito. But, like I said, won't quit 'til I try 'em all #goals and will report back. And, do check out the bar area--great atmosphere if you're just looking to try out a couple drinks and small plates.

First of all, the decor and ambiance of this place is top notch. It's gorgeous on the inside and has floor to ceiling windows that provide a good view of the fountains from many of the tables. We were seated directly across from the bar close to the pizza oven (so about halfway into the restaurant) and could still see the top of them. I would not want to sit at the front of the restaurant because it's open to the casino and just doesn't seem quite as special.

Second of all, the food! I enjoyed almost every dish that we ordered. The plates are small and pretty pricey, so take that into consideration (the 4 star rating), but hey, it's Vegas. It's kind of part of the whole deal. We ordered...
- CAPRESE
- MARGHERITA PIZZA
- RISOTTO AI FUNGHI E PARMIGIANO
- FUSILLIORO
- GNOCCHI ALLA ROMANA (My favorite... like clouds!)
- COSTA DI MANZO
- SCALOPPINA DI VITELLO (the only thing I didn't eat bc I don't eat veal)
- CHEESECAKE

Came with a buddy who happens to be a pro poker player. I will explain why this is mentioned later.


Had the mussels, clam, whole lobster, 7n7(lobster and potatoes) spaghetti di fruiti (spaghetti with seafood) and the Kobe beef. 

mussels sucks. Don't get it.

Clam was really good especially the sauce.

Lobster was ok.

7n7 was the best dish, highly recommended

Spaghetti sucked. Wasn't stingy with the amount of seafood but the sauce was very lacking especially since I had similar dish at diners and Italian restaurants in New Jersey that were much more flavorful. It was what the server recommended

Kobe beef was good but very small. Maybe two oz at max.

My biggest gripe, and maybe I am being bitter about it was the service. My buddy who I mention is a pro poker player been to the restaurant many times which he mentions to the server. He tells the server that this is my first time on this restaurant and she needs to explain and provide service to me. 

So in the beginning she was somewhat helpful with a great recommendation of the spaghetti which I will not recommend to anyone who bothers reading this review.  She asks what the occasion is for our visitation. And we tell her that our buddy is here for a poker tourney.  Her attitude immediately changes for greater once she finds out my buddy is a pro which wasn't a surprise. However the ditz completely disregards me and not once after asks if food was ok, if service is ok, if i needed anything. She asks him only if he wants desert. My buddy seeing the way ditz is acting asks me if I want deserts hoping she would get it but unfortunately that's not the case. I said sure and she brings out a desert menu which she lays in front of him and starts going over what's good.. Once again only to him. My buddy asks if I want anything and I tell him nope but she doesn't hear me obviously and keeps trying to recommend to my buddy what's good. We politely decline and ask for our check. Of course the ditz put the check in front of my buddy which I kinda took offensive too but whatever. We have it charged on the room and since it was my turn to pay for the tip, I generously gave her 15% which was 15% more than she deserved.  The helper? Who was dressed in black company outfit and not in a dress, was actually much more helpful and provided better service.  Sounds like I'm writing this review out of jealousy lolol.  

I was taught that if you ever run across a daughter who you are interested but happens to be with her mother, you always treat and entertain the mother first and foremost. I hope the ditz get it one day instead of being blinded by greed for more tip? Or just trying to find a meal ticket out of her life.",KRpxk3SlIpCXOijfr5d5CQ,5,0,2,_6boLJJykCiLK5ikauvFUg

Our seat wasn't terrible but did not have a real good view of the Bellagio fountains.  We reserved for brunch ($38 pp).  I expected to get little value for money but I could not have been more wrong.  

The brunch is technically 4 courses: bread and pastry basket, second course entree, third course entree, and a dessert buffet.

The second course was a selection from roughly 10 items.  My date opted for the duck and polenta, which was pretty amazing and I selected the carbonara pasta which was decent but not mind blowing.

Our 3rd course, was yet again a selection from list of items available. She chose the scallop and shrimp over rice and I ordered steak and eggs. I was extremely jealous when I saw her plate but one bite of my steak and I couldn't have been happier.

The final course was a dessert buffet with pies, cookies,  crepes, bread pudding, and a chocolate fountain with fruit and other items for dipping.  We tried a few thing but were pretty full.

1323662,2016-09-17,5,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"One of my TOP 4 favorite Vegas Brunches that I frequent & LOVE!  Lago's Sunday brunch & bottomless mimosas & bloody Mary's all to die for.  Julian Serrano has never disappointed me as a matter of fact, he personally introduced himself to me twice & recommended a certain  thing which will be part of my Yelp on his Aria restaurant.

Lago's brunch is a magical & artsy display of colors & beauty overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  Order both the bottomless mimosas & Bloody Mary whichever you prefer first, but definitely try both.  Come w/ an appetite & take all that this 3-course brunch has to offer!  

The pastry basket is an Italian twist of yummy cornetto, zeppole, muffins, scones, croissants, donuts, cinnamon rolls & bombolone.  I've eaten here many times so will not steer your taste buds wrong.  In order of my favorite & highly recommended, let's begin!

First Course choices...
ANTIPASTO MISTO:  Burrata, prosciutto, salami, olives, bell peppers.  Awesome w/ one of their wines from a fantastic selection of wines. 
MAC CARBONARA:  Pancetta, eggs yolks, pecorino, black pepper.  Rich & decadent small macaroni noodles mmm!  I'd add a lil spice to it of course.  
CAESAR SALAD:  Roasted chicken & hard boiled eggs.  It was good, but needed more dressing.  

Second Course...
CHICKEN ""FLORENTINE STYLE"" A-Must!!  You could cut the moist chicken w/ a fork.  It's stuffed w/ this delicious spinach-ricotta!   So tasty & my absolute fav!  I want it on the menu everyday!  
ITALIAN SAUSAGE FRIED BURGER:  House made Italian sausage & fried egg.  Large so share everything!  Even though they are known for small plates, the whole brunch is very filling.
EGGPLANT PARMESAN BENEDICT:  Exactly what it says w/ a poached egg.   I actually didn't like this at all.  Bland, tasteless, but perfectly poached egg lol.

Lastly the BEST part!!  Why you shared & saved your appetite is the unbelievable DESSERT DISPLAY!!  
The PANETTONE PUDDING oh melt in your mouth!  It's like they made it w/ love as your mom or grandma would.
CLASSIC TIRAMISU & NUTELLA CRESPELLE also do.  

Let's get back to the artsy wonderful mimosa & Bloody Mary's.  I squeezed all the creatively placed Tabasco, horseradish & soy sauce droppers stuck in a cucumber display all into my Bloody Mary.. Mmm tasty & so good!  It's also filling.  The mimosa taste is ok, but the lavish golden sugar display on top is absolutely the most beautiful mimosa I've ever seen.  Picture worthy!  

Overall, I love Lago's for all meals, but especially brunch.  Treat yourself to all of this from $50 to $80.  It's worth every second & starts your week off on the right foot.",D43OWyfzIQjL8feJpYh2SQ,9,8,5,enC4rwLH9qloG1j46H86sw

1368278,2015-05-28,1,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Well. I left less than charmed with my meal at Lago.

My friend and I popped in quickly without dinner reservations at the tail end of the night. We were seated in the lounge chars in the bar area which I would recommend against sitting in if you are planning to eat a meal. The seats and table height are awkward so eating off of plates was slightly uncomfortable. 

We ordered the following dishes:

-alla ricotta e miele: ricotta cheese with a layer of honey on a densely packed focaccia roll. For 8 bucks, you get a dense piece of focaccia bread with a ricotta spread and drizzled with honey. It's...good. The first bite was great, but overall, the bread was heavy and I didn't anticipate such a sweet dish to start my meal. A more savory dish would have probably been more satisfactory. I would recommend ordering more than one if your party includes more than 2 people. 

-tonno crudo: ahi tuna slices garnished with orange segments. 4 slices for $19. The tuna was rather sinewy which I didn't expect. The chewiness was a distraction from the rest of the dish. No good.

-spaghetti chittara: tomatoes, clams, garlic oil all tossed over al dente spaghetti noodles ($16). The noodles were perfectly cooked and this was probably the most positive thing I can say about the dish. It was bland. I ordered the dish expecting the clams to infuse some sort of seafood flavor into the broth, but I got none of that. It felt like the clams and tomatoes were just garnishes over very well cooked spaghetti noodles. 

-fusillioro: corkscrew pasta tossed with lamb ragù + spuma di ricotta ($15). This was the most flavorful dish of the night. It was robust and had nice touches in flavor, but was slightly unremarkable. 

Lago is the epitome of Las Vegas: fine dining with a so-so menu, but nothing spectacular. If you're looking for a nice place to dinner at in Vegas, I would suggest that you put in that extra ounce of effort to scout out an amazing meal. Lago needs some time to develop.",GhnqHTT1vKkLc0Z1rGsQ1A,3,1,3,bpyuoNaNeXMpWU3TlILqsw

1395034,2017-07-20,2,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"A beautiful restaurant that over looks the Bellagio water fountain. However, the food here isn't something I rave about. 

started off with some bruschetta- the ripe, fresh tomatoes were delicious and flavorful. The bruschetta was simple but yet super tasty. It was served on top of grilled buttered toast. 

steamed clams- the white wine broth was a little too light and the clams were a little fish tasting. There could be more seasonings to help mask the fishiness from the clams (perhaps some garlic)

steak- the steak was perfectly cooked at medium rare, but the sauce was way too overpowering and salty. It would have been nice if the sauce was a little lighter and the focus would be on the meat rather than the overpowering sauce. 

seabass- the mild flavor of the seabass was a little boring. It could have use more of a springy lemon taste. It taste like seabass that was just cooked on a grill with no flavor.

We were seated without a drink menu, which was odd since typically you order drinks before food. The drink menu came later. I ordered the Lago Cocktail sweet, and it came spicy. One of the menus was dirty with food-switching out the page would've been a quick fix. Some plastic drink cups and spilled food remained on the floor behind us for the entire time we were there.

1439958,2016-07-31,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"VERY, VERY Nice! And definatly worth going.
   A couple things you should know B4 you go to Lago~
   We have had lunch here and enjoyed it very much. HOWEVER we just had dinner and would NEVER GO BACK! The noise level is OFF THE CHARTS!!!! Party of 4, literally could not hear across the table. Absolutely ridiculous!  The food was fine and our server, Nadar spoke loudly trying to compensate for the noise~ Granted its a Saturday night so be warned maybe it's better during the week....  
    1) Lunch is served till 2:30 & the Dancing Waters don't start till 3pm. This will be the BEST VIEW of the DW you will EVER have, so book a reso and be sure to request a table close to the window. All seats in dining area are pretty good, the bar area could be challenging to see.
   2) Nice menu selections, tapas style. Full plate options available. 3 Course Lunch Special $28.00 w/o drink unless u have water~ I had the Minestrone Soup (REALLY DEEELISH!) Full of fresh tasting veggies, great broth with a dollop of pesto. It was chilly today so soup was a gr8 choice ~ Main course was the Branzino, cooked perfectly on a bed of baby tomatoes, asparagus & capers in a lite buttery sauce. The fish is the star here with the skin grilled nicely (easy to remove if you don't prefer it) The dessert option varies as it is a chef's choice, I indulged in a deconstructed Tiramisu which was OUTTA SITE!!! With dessert ordered cappuccino & it was good, however it was delivered about 15 min B4 the dessert was.
   This is the reason 3 stars NOT 5 as the service was not gr8, and waaaaay to much time lapsed between courses, had to ask for lemons 2x's, Iced Tea never refilled. It's these little things that are not expected @ a Julien Serrano restaurant. Would never happen @ Picaso (which yes! I have been to!!) also Masa's in SF, where the service is and has ALWAYS been phenomenal!!! The server was nice enough, just not aware~ 
   Lago's price point is classic Strip pricing. Cocktails $17.00, cappuccinos $5.25, I will say the Smoked Peach Margarita was quite good, and was not light in tequila ~ wasn't overpowering but I definatly wouldn't drink 2, then drive...",bdRS6ZRxf6CNrnULnMI1cg,1,0,3,VGRyq5FOSnGr-lIsmYf6Dw

Standouts were the pesto pasta (the pesto was clearly homemade) and shrimp stuffed squid (which I had never seen before - SO GOOD!!!).  Our server recommended 3 - 4 plates per person.  We did not follow this guideline, as this would have been very expensive.  Instead, my boyfriend and I split a bruschetta and then split four more ""main"" small plates - essentially 2.5 per person.  This was more than enough for two normal sized humans.  We were plenty full.

The atmosphere was also great.  We were seated right by the window for a view of the fountains.  

My one main complaint (knocking a star) is that the wine prices were outrageous.  The cheapest glass on the menu was $16, for a wine I have never heard of.  The good wines were $19, or $90 for a bottle.  In my opinion, this is out of control.  We just drank Goose IPA for $9 (still slightly overpriced, but it's Vegas).",zKlLgoM37YwigPhl42wBcA,0,0,4,37eA3rF7xmeb18xqU3X4jA

But, the entire restaurant doesn't necessarily have a good view. Also, quite pricey - to be expected given the quality of the chef, the food and the wine list. Negative reviews of this place tend to cluster on those two issues.

So - what did we do? We went for a LATE lunch - you know, that time of day where no one really is eating? Like 2:00 p.m. Rolled in, the place was mostly dead, asked to sit outside for a prime view of the fountains that begin at 3 p.m. Ordered a bottle of wine, leisurely enjoyed the wine, ordered some appetizers & salads. Then we shared a couple of the pizzas (the fig one was to DIE for) and each ordered an entree as well (I got the ravioli and my partner got something with lamb that was amazing!). We communicated to our server that we planned on a leisurely lunch and he was fantastic at being attentive but giving us space to enjoy each other's company and the view. Best of both worlds this way - an amazing meal (still pricey, even at lunch, but about half what you'd pay at dinner), an awesome view (by the timing getting to choose our seating - especially since we rolled out by the 5 pm dinner rush), and a high quality dining experience.

They were also cognizant of any dietary restrictions we had and made sure everyone was taken care of.

The service, however, was the complete opposite. Our server, Rene R. actually seemed to be trying to give us poor service and was focused on turning the table quickly instead of creating a great experience. 

He didn't ask for drink orders before the food order, some members of our party were never asked if they wanted a beverage at all. I ordered a glass of red wine after being rudely rushed through the process. Ten minutes later, I asked if I could receive the glass of wine I had ordered, and I was brought a glass of white wine instead. At this point, it had been about 20 minutes, so I just decided to drink it. 

While ordering food, we shared who from the party would be sharing a tab. At the end of our meal (after never being asked about how our food was tasting or if we needed anything else), we received one check. When we requested it be split up as we had requested, we were told ""I guess, but it will take me 30 minutes"". 

At that point, we reached out to the manager to share our experience. No apology, no trying to make it better. He just shared he would help calculate so it might get done quicker. 

Totally ruined our experience, and we would definitely never return.",npBxrrPCLAt1TlfeS03B2w,0,0,1,unnjP-JEue6TCTaOfKk2xA

There's an outdoor seating section and unfortunately we were seated right next to the door and it often got stuck - not a lot of people bothered to close it, so we had the summer heat constantly blowing on us.

Absolutely make a reservation before you come here, I think I saw them turning people away in front of me. 

We started with the caprese - absolutely delicious, but I'm probably biased because this is one of my favorite all time dishes. The dishes come out one at a time, by the time you've finished one they're usually pretty good about making sure the next one has already been placed on you time (if not the next 2).

Highly, highly recommend the burrata, we also had the cold cuts plater (because who doesn't love some dried meats?).  As far as pastas, we ordered linguine al pesto, gnocchi alla romana, funghi trifolati, and agnolotti di vitello. Other dishes ordered were polpette di carne and capasanta alla putanesca (scallops). My favorite dish was hands down the gnocchi alla romana - tasted like butter and the texture was fantastic. In all honesty, I would order any and all of the pastas again.

Octopus in a spicy tomato sauce saved us the airfare to the region of Italy where this dish has been perfected.   

Sea bas with olives, capers, tomatoes, asparagus should be on the menu forever.  The dish deconstructed:  crispy skin, yet moist sea bass filet, sweetness of tomatoes diminished by the right amount of salt, asparagus moist yet slightly firm.   Wish I could order another dish.

We each were able to select our own 1 & 2 course. We got the:
 Shredded Salmon Salad, Duck & Polenta, Raviolone, the Filettino and EggPlant Parmesan Benedict. Everything were very delicious! 
After finished eating we seated at patio to drink our mimosas and bellinis, and have dessert. 
They wrote 'Happy Birthday' on the side of the dessert plate. I think they went beyond their job to make sure we have a great time.

We had a 10:30am reservation on a Sunday for brunch. We were seated on the outside patio.

The hostess was very nice. Remembered us and sat us right away.

Food and drink:
Mac Carbonara - 3 stars - nothing wrong with the dish but also nothing special about it. Would order it again
Raviolone - 4 stars - as you cut into the ravioli the egg flowed out in a beautiful liquid pool.  The pasta was perfectly al dente. The sauce was very rich and a little heavy handed. I would do more of a drizzle of the sauce.
Italian Sausage Fried Egg Burger - 2 stars - overcooked a bit
EggPlant Parmesan Benedict - 2 stars - no flavor
Peach Bellini - 2 stars - just ok.  
Bloody Mary - 3 stars - this is from a Bloody Mary critic though.  Could use worcestershire, celery salt and horseradish.  Added garnishes of pickle peppers and a bacon strip would be lovely.

Service - 1 star
Ricky was our server. He was very nice however seemed a bit frazzled. My drink did not come out for quite a while however they did end up comping it. We have been there for an hour and only had one course and of the three course brunch. We stayed another 15 minutes and then left as we had a plane to catch.  We asked several time for our next course but it did not come until we were literally getting out of our chairs.  We were charged for the entire brunch.  

Ambiance - 3 stars
This restaurant has a bit of a modern vibe. The music was club music which was a bit much for brunch so minus one start. We really enjoyed the view from the patio and watching the fountains was amazing.

The food was just mediocre and the service was not good.  There is much room for improvement.  I would not recommend this restaurant for brunch.  Very disappointing give that it is in the Bellagio.",vBA7KQP9CcXVVxJl_Db6RA,2,0,2,u2RsjMkbbm_ev2EAENCAMQ

I made a reservation a week before and we were sat almost immediately upon arrival. We got a really nice seat, two tables from the window. We picked a time where the fountain shows were just starting so we got to see a beautiful show every 15 minutes.

The service was not the best I have ever had. I felt like our waiter paid more attention to the table next to mine. The restaurant wasn't that busy either so I kinda expected better service. We waited for a water refill for a long time.

The food however made up for the service. We had to try the small plates so we had a few of those along with one regular dinner plate. The Gnocchi with lobster is a must. The lobster was delicious, and the Gnocchi was one of the best Gnocchis I have ever had. The veal was a little too sour for my taste, so next time I will pass on that. We also had one of the sashimi plates, which was melt in your mouth. A little pricey, but delicious. Finally, the lamb chops were perfectly cooked and I really enjoyed that dish.

The plates were small, but full of flavor. I think ordering a few small plates and one side is the perfect amount of food for two people.

My only options for reservations were 5:15 and 9:45. I took the earlier one and am so glad I did. Despite the opening night jitters the staff seemed to be experiencing, the service was im-pe-cca-ble. I know they'd had three nights to practice on the crème de la crème fortunate enough to attend one of the ""soft openings"", but they said that it was different now that it's ""real"". :)

Also ridiculously, I can boast that I was the first customer to order the Lago cocktail, the one with the edible flower suspended in an ice sphere and sprinkled with glitter. It is a visual masterpiece and obviously, someone put a lot of thought into developing it. I felt a little guilty when I asked if the bartender would be willing to use Nolet's gin instead of the vodka in the original recipe. S/he was, and our server told us they'd run out to another bar to get it. 

We ordered: the seafood wrapped in other seafood with limoncello, the sausage/gorgonzola toast, the canneloni stuffed with short ribs, the langostinos, the filet with gorgonzola, and the shrimp ravioli.

Now for the ""feedback"" part:

~All very good, though the sauce on the ravioli was extremely salty (didn't prevent us from just scraping it off and mowing down on the pasta itself) . We did mention it to the server.

~Some (ok, maybe most) will find the portions skimpy. Prices are what you can expect - similar to places like Jaleo, Giada, Rose. Rabbit. Lie., etc. You know, the ubiquitous small-plates joints.

~Just to make it easy on the bartenders, if the spirit is on the menu, there should be a bottle of it at the bar...I still feel badly that someone had to run out for the Nolet's. 


Overall, a wonderful experience! The food was plated beautifully and presented with enthusiasm. It is good. It is also (so far) probably just on par with the offerings of other elegant strip dining establishments. Chef Serrano is one of the best, and maybe I'm just partial to his namesake restaurant in Aria, but Lago at this point is a little, well, average.

Gnocchi Alla - 4/5 - very creamy cheese taste that melts in your mouth. 6 of them were a bit rich for me. This tapas is best to be shared with another person.

Shrimp stuffed ravioli - 3/5 - mini shrimp were fresh but the marina sauce overwhelmed me a bit.

Clams in white wine sauce - 5/5 - my favorite dish of the night. A huge bowl of clams steeped in white wine and butter paired with thick spicy Texas toast  bread, with a kick. I could eat this dish all day long.


I also got a taste of the cannoli's, chicken liver and veal stuffed ravioli - all excellent.
Overall, service is quite good and the fountains provide a great view.

Don't miss Lago when you are in vegas but expect to spend at least $40-$50 per person.",vZ8V8asW6eV7wjdMoVrang,0,0,4,XUqqs0G0fZE9dhzKanbP3A

They moan and groan and smile and close their eyes while savoring the food. I always thought it was just for TV, but Lago managed to evoke those emotions out of me. Wow.

I went with three friends during CES weekend right when it opened for the day. While they set up our table, we waited near the front of the restaurant in this lounge-ish area; that was pretty cool and hip. The restaurant decor was very clean and modern. Each table has a simple metal vase of fresh flowers; I thought it was a nice touch. Tables have a marble finish, so they're great for the instagram background LOL! They definitely put a lot of attention to detail in the presentation of the place; when we refreshed our plates, the server made sure all the logos on the plates faced you instead of randomly placing the plate onto our table. And since I went for lunch, there was plenty of light streaming through the windows facing the fountains. 

For drinks, we got the ""mojito passione"" and ""rose and rye"". Presentation was SO ON POINT. The mint leaves of the mojito were even gold dusted! My friend and I did think that the drinks were pretty strong, The server did mention ""rose and rye"" was his favorite.

For food, we decided to go with the tasting menu. The food is tapas style, and they had a lot of options, so I'm glad we had the chef do all the menu picking for us. They ask if there are any allergies to be aware of. And then you just sit back and wait for the best food journey of your life. 

They bring out two dishes at a time. NOTABLES WERE: the bistecca (as part of the surf and turf), lobster gnocchi, and the burrata dish. That sauce for the steak was SO BOMB. After my first bite of meat, I had the biggest grin on my face. And even as I'm writing this review, the memory of it is bringing a smile to my face. The lobster gnocchi sauce tasted very similar to lobster bisque, and we all loved it! The biggest letdown was the pasta dish with truffle; it was just okay. The other dishes were a blur, so good thing I took pictures of them! haha

Our subtotal came out to be 406 for 4 people. We ordered two drinks and a dessert in addition to the tasting menu. Our server was great, and they even refreshed our plates halfway through the meal.

TL;DR This is undoubtedly a pricey place.  But for the food, the ambiance, the view, the service--and let's be real, we're on the strip in Bellagio, it's worth it.",QjZN6x1hGm2Edj95FfpKUA,7,1,5,YSz0RnMbRl-0efeYoTDYdQ

Date night sent us here. We were unsure about the place at the beginning but the hostess made us feel welcome and comfortable right from the beginning as she lead us to one of the best tables in the house. Our window seat with a view of the world famous Bellagio Fountain and the Paris Hotel was very impressive. 

Not being totally familiar with the tapas style of dining, our waiter easily, politely and throughly walked us through the process. After cruising the wine list, we ordered our wine with the sommelier who broke the ice and wine ordering business when the cork broke in the bottle we ordered. We all got a good laugh out of that. Oh, and the Pinot Noir was an excellent choice.

We ordered a little bit of everything...tapas style. Cold seafood, pasta, more seafood, meatballs and desert. No complaints whatsoever. None.

The couple sitting next to us was celebrating a birthday and we offered to take their picture with the incredible view behind them. They reciprocated taking our picture. Fine people from Toronto they were.

We hated to leave Lago but if you go, this is a dress-up place for ladies and gentlemen. This is also not a cheap place but, you will get great food, beverage, atmosphere that is incomparable and service that is really commensurate with the costs.

TIP: Table outdoors are not guaranteed because it is first come first serve basis. You can do a guaranteed table outdoor for $200 per person.

End up getting to sit inside because there was a private party outside. Sat by the window which is nice too cause we were in the middle and the room was not crowded. There were only 3 other large party.

We did Sunday brunch for $38 per person. Select 2 course on the menu and dessert is also included. Worth the money because it's pretty filling. They put out a ""happy birthday"" note with different desserts on a plate with a candle at the end for somebody's birthday.

You can also do All you can drink for $28 per person (Mimosas, Bellini, Bloody Mary)

1789958,2015-10-24,3,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Our dinner here turned out to be a disappointment and sort of soured our mood.  We did give the manager our feedback and he patiently listened and wound up discounting our bill.  For that, I'll give 3 stars.  The food was quite fine, but  the hostess and front-of-house service was lacking.  They simply don't communicate well and follow-up with reservations in a timely manner.

We made Open Table reservations at 630pm and didn't get seated until around 715pm.  A nice table by the windows to see Bellagio water shows wasn't available and would be 10-20 minutes wait.  Instead they had a hightop with stools available.  So we waited for a nicer table but after 20 minutes it was going to be another 15-20 minutes.  We wound up taking a table near the bar with no view.  Guess making reservations isn't useful here since they don't understand the concept of putting a reserved sign near the good seats.  If its first come first serve, why bother to accept reservations at all and keep our hopes up?

As for the food, the best dish was the Grilled Octopus with squid-ink couscous. Definitely a masterpiece with char-griled tender octopus and savory, briny couscous - it gave us both black lipgloss but was totally worth it.  The 7x7 (7 gnocchi and 7 lobster knuckles) was also good - with a nice buttery broth.

The other two dishes were mediocre.  Chittara and clams was cooked al dente but seemed a tad on the salty side.  The Branzino had a nice flavor and seasoning on the tomatoes but the fish itself was a bit under-seasoned.  

Our waitress was very nice but she forgot our crab farro salad and then didn't give us a pen when we asked for the check.  The busboys were great at refilling our waters and clearing the plates - so they probably deserve the best praise with respect to service.

The manager did discount our bill, which was honorable and a welcome gesture.  Still, with the fierce competition in Vegas for restaurants its doubtful we will return.",VHjR5F6mdnLrQcCb0nqCYg,7,4,3,2-qJ_3v2GRmls9HpwyWg-g
1800414,2016-05-18,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"We came here with friends for a ""special occasion"" dinner. We arrived at 6:15 for a 7 PM reservation requesting a patio or window table. They called us at about 6:40 that a window table was available. No patio table would be open for another hour. We took our window table.
Ambiance: The decorating is dramatic to say the least. From the moment you pass the hostess stand until you reach the floor to ceiling glass wall facing the fountains, each area of the restaurant is striking. Definitely 5 stars for the ambiance except for the noise level. Some people like the ""high energy, high noise"" dining experience. Not me.
Food: Our server recommended 3 to 4 small plates per person. We opted for two small plates and one main course per couple. Good choice. Way more than enough food. We started with a pizza, fusillioro, mushrooms and the ""7&7"" as appetizers. The pizza was excellent despite the fact that it was served just slightly warmer than room temperature. The Fusillioro is a corkscrew pasta dish with lamb ragu and spuma di ricotta. This was my favorite dish of the night! The 7&7 is potato gnocchi and lobster knuckles. Another excellent dish. The mushroom dish was the only disappointment of the night. Bland and flavorless. The main course we chose was the Pesce Intero. This is a whole boneless white fish served with a generous portion of vegetables. A really outstanding dish with very high presentation quality. Yumm!
Service: The only major disappointment of the evening. Our server was at our table fairly quickly. But then disappeared for long stretches. We asked to have the pizza served first. Instead, all 4 appetizers appeared at once (considering that the pizza was just about room temperature, I suspect it was ready much earlier). With all 4 appetizers being presented at once, our fairly small table became very crowded and hard to navigate. Our water glasses spent most of the evening near empty. I just about had to tackle a passing busboy to get them refilled once. They sat empty the rest of the night after that.
Value: The presentation and taste of the food was really memorable, but the noise level and the mediocre service make this not worth the $75 a head that it cost. I will not be coming back.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,2,0,4,aPvE7ATyfqz-0WlT_VCmTg

I wish I could give 4.5 stars and not just 4, but the pricing is a little high for what you get, in my opinion, but I guess you can chalk that up to just being in Vegas.  Service has always been decent, but my one gripe on that is that the servers seem to always be pushing you to order more, rather than asking.  Guess I'm nit picking a bit, but it's the little things that differentiate in my opinion from a 5 star establishment.

1819963,2018-05-28,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Lago is a chic restaurant space with modern decor and some excellent view seating but the wait time and overall arrogant service were disappointing, which explains my one star review. 

I called ahead and made a reservation 24 hours in advance for a birthday celebration dinner. Based on open table, they had plenty of reservation times available during peak and off peak dinner hours for Friday night. It is also advertised on open table that this is a restaurant good for large groups and celebrations. 

When I called the concierge to book my appointment, he asked many questions such as any specific dietary restrictions, are we celebrating anything, would we like a seat with a view of the fountain, etc. I mentioned yes, we have one vegetarian, we are celebrating a birthday, and yes we would love a view of the fountain. The concierge stated there are vegetarian options, he would note that we are celebrating a birthday, and that we should arrive 15minutes before our reservation time so we can get a seat with a view of the fountain. Making the reservation was painless and based on all the Q and A, I felt like Lago would be an enjoyable experience.

Our entire party arrived at the restaurant at 8:45pm for our 9pm reservation. I actually had to wait at the maitre d stand as there were several groups in front of us so by the time we checked in, it was 8:55pm. I believe the owner was the host that night, based on yelp pictures of restaurant owner. He was not welcoming at all, he and the women staff around him did not smile or acknowledge us with a greeting. It was the most uncomfortable and standoffish restaurant check in I've ever experienced. 

The host/owner mentioned we could be seated immediately or wait 20minutes for a seat with a view. We agreed to wait for the view seating since that would be part of the dining experience at Lago. He said ok you're checked in, but did not give any information as to how we would be contacted. I had to ask how will we know when our table is ready? He mentioned that he would let me know, that I should stay around the area. Most restaurants with this kind of traffic and updated technology give you a beeper or text you when your table is ready. That might be something this restaurant can take into consideration since it is a popular foodie destination.

There was no waiting area so I sat at a slot machine chair directly in front of the maitre d stand in candid view of the host. By 9:15pm, my friends were restless and annoyed that we were waiting for a table even with an advanced reservation. I approached the maitre d stand and the host/owner with a very nonchalant demeanor stated, oh your table is ready, is your entire party here? Wow!! I had been sitting directly in front of the maitre d stand for 15minutes and he never bothered to inform me that our table it ready. We were led to a table with a great view of the lago and fountain show, but it was probably not even our table as it was set up for a party of 9. Another party must have been tired of waiting and left before getting seated.

The food is hit or miss, some of the vegetarian dishes were tasty and executed well but the bistecca was tough and chewy, not a good quality piece of meat for a high end restaurant. We also ordered the lobster gnocchi based on all the positive reviews but it didn't impress. 

Consistent with the service from the host/owner, our server was aloof and unwelcoming. For the birthday celebration, they put a candle in a dessert that we ordered off the menu and had to pay for. The execution of the dessert presentation was untimely and unorganized, they didn't even ask who's birthday it is and brought out the lit dessert and placed it in front of my friend who ordered it, not the birthday person who actually went to the restroom at the time. 

If you're willing to overlook the awful service, wait time, and hit or miss food, you may enjoy the view and decor of this restaurant. For us, it was consistently disappointing and we will never dine here again, even with our free M life rewards.",MHsg3jn7l4Na0bDzITcJ7A,1,0,1,lJ8fZkdrPqnejRw8UTj2_w

Everything from the beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains to the top notch service left us feeling full and completely satisfied.  Since we had a group of 6, we were able to try a wide variety of the menu.  It's one of those meals where you try so many things, it's hard for any (or many) items to stand out, and to be fair, many of the items were pretty basic but enhanced by the grandness and atmosphere of an elegant Vegas restaurant.  That said, if you're looking for a great restaurant that appeals to a group of people with a nice view and on the Strip, Lago is a pretty reasonable option for both great tastes, tons of variety, and pretty reasonable price points.

Bruschetta al Pomodoro - perfectly crispy bruschetta that was seasoned well with the right amount of pomodoro topping, nothing memorable but a great starter and a classic
Salmon Crudo - when I'm not pregnant, I will go back just to try every plate of crudo they have, but even being able to sample some of the salmon was enough for me that evening.  Fresh fresh fish, lightly accented with caper and delicious
Branzino - probably one of my favorite items of the night, perfectly prepared and delicately flavored
Meatballs - can't go wrong here, nothing standout, but still delish
Braised Short Rib - a group pleaser 
Baby Shrimp in White Wine Sauce - Delicate and tasty but not super memorable
Mushroom Risotto - a nice heavier compliment to add some starch, not overly salty as some risotto can get
Malloredos - pork sausage pasta that was quite tasty and an excellent choice
There was a green pasta that I can't remember the name of but was very enjoyable as well
Filettino - excellent cut of meat, prepared well

Overall a very enjoyable meal.  Definitely fits the Vegas standard of grand atmosphere and service.  The food is excellent, you can't go wrong.

Stayed at hotel. Came down at 10:30 for first seating. I had reservation My grades. A=Excellent, F=fail

1. Hostess Greeting: F
2. Server: Antonio -A
3. Food: A
4. Drinks: C

Overall grade: F.   Will not return

While the food is good and wait staff is efficient and friendly. Initial encounter was so off putting, it really ruins the Sunday brunch experience. 

We had reservation for first seating at 10:30 and arrived a few minuted early. Yet we were told thete is no table. We were herded to the bar. 
After 5 minutes bar tender looked at us, proceeded to fill his ice bucket. After another 5 minutes elapsed, he asked if we wanted to get started with cocktails......not exactly we thoughg privately at 10:30 am on on empty stomach. He left us.

15 minutes into our wait, hostess came over called out my name. I and my husband stood up. She looked at me and said. ""No it's not you."" Then proceeded to invite another party to their table. My husband saw my name on the tag hostess was holding. I walked up and told her, she's perhaps mistaken. She said ""No. Not you"". I went to the 2 hostesses at the door and asked why. They confirmed to the first hostess that indeed, we are the correct party. She turned, glared at us and walked us to our table Not one word like "" follow me"" or anything. We sat down. She left. That was it. No, good morning, how are you, apologies for the mix up. Nada. 

Our server Antonio was superb. He remembered my food allergies from my reservation. Asked the chef to recook the steak & eggs.

Two points for management:
1. Either retrain hostess or get rid of her. Poor customer interaction skills turn away customers. The sunday Brunch is as much about the experience as it is about the food. Hitting 50% of the mark is failure on the fiercely competitive Strip.
2. If you need to boost the bar tabs, make the drinks exceptional. Do NOT force customers to the bar for a 1st seating brunch. If you are truly logistically challenged, at least train bar tenter to offer a glass of water while guests have to wait for you to sort out your scheduling logistics and not push alcohol first thing am.  Feels like a fundamental failure on logistics management, which is both shocking and a huge disappointment for an establishment of Bellagio caliber.",Y2cvVQJXCmze_cih9QFrsA,1,0,3,bmMyqP8a480e9sNV3brNPQ

Our reservation was for 7:15 -we were barely acknowledged at the hostess station and told to go have a drink in the bar/ someone would be by to get us in a few minutes. A few minutes? At 7:45 we still weren't seated and when I went back to the hostesses, all three of them stood at the podium staring at their table maps discussing amongst themselves what to do.  Again, no one gave me a definitive answer, and we were again told to go wait in he bar some more. At 8pm I went back again to the hostesses and said 'this is not right! What is the purpose of having a reservation if you have no plan to seat us? We have show tickets and will likely miss the first part because we haven't even been sated for dinner!'   I was ushered back to the bar by a manager who bought us a round of drinks (small consolation just to shut me up no doubt)  We were finally seated and had a 15 minute dinner so we could get to our show. 

As far as dinner goes, tiny plates- order several if you don't want to leave hungry.  No bread served unless you specifically ask for it.

The waiter was patient and let us sit for 2 hours even though it was the middle of the busy brunch time. One of my courses was overcooked (the sausage and egg sandwich) but all other courses and desserts were good.  Plus I think the bill was reasonable considering we had bottomless mimosas and blood marys as well as plenty of sweets. The ambiance feels like a relaxing European breakfast.

We stood at the hostess stand as one employee spoke to another customer for a few minutes. She could have aknowledged us with eye contact but we remained patient as she was busy. Two hostesses walked up to the desk which we were now standing directly in front of and did not even look at us. They stood there chatting and looking at their seating plan. Finally after a few more minutes I said loudly to my husband ""Are we invisible? Maybe we just seat ourselves here!"". We laughed, but they STILL did not look up. Finally, a male employee joined behind them and one woman looked up and said hello to us.
We said party of 4. She asked, ""Do you have a reservation?""  I said no. She said sorry we needed one. I asked if I could call now and make one and she said no they were full as we looked at the empty area to our left. The male employee looked down and said, ""We can seat you in the lounge area now or put you down for 8:45 or 9 pm."" It was 7:45. We chose to go elsewhere. It would have been one thing if maybe there were a black pants dress code like the night clubs and we were underdressed. I would have understood that. However, we were not even aknowledged. That is just awful customer service. We did not have the opportunity to review the chef's work or the restuarant as we were snubbed at the door. I'm not sure if they were just that poorly trained in service  (which I find unacceptable in a place like Belagio) or if they saw us and our 1 year old and thought if they ignored us long enough we would go away. We took our business to the Palms Restuarant instead at Caesars and enjoyed Surf and Turf and excellent service and hospitality to our daughter. I'd really like to give this restuarant another chance.

Our last dinner also suffered from the fact that we had no luck in getting some bread - not sure why this was such a challenge. Couldn't help but feel like the lack of bread and the tiny glasses of wine were designed to separate me from as much as my money as possible.  The acoustics in the restaurant are quite bad, so the noise level is a distraction when the restaurant gets full and the people working the host stand seem distracted with things other than their jobs as our ""5 to 10 minute wait"" ended up being over 30 minutes before we were escorted to a mostly empty room in which to dine.",CHmVscpmfsM52d9gur97pQ,0,0,2,lL7_gG1QCnjA6whIlOG-aQ

2220458,2018-06-02,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,Had severe food poisoning from their clams. Tasted odd and told them so they took it off of the bill. Called to tell manager of Lago that he had bad clams so that he could make sure that the quality control for other patrons were ok. He stated the clams come in fresh but it happens. Who says this to a customer other than a manager who does not care. Instead wanted to hear that he will do everything in their power to make sure to protect other customers from this happening.

Boy it wasn't a disappointment, only downside was there was only seating available at high tops near the casino, and not with a view.   Which was very surprising since it seemed very slow.  I ordered a whiskey and ginger, the soda was flat, but was not a big deal at all.  Just ordered another one.  

We ordered clams, filet, and a platter of different meats with bread.  Everything was cooked perfectly, very bold vibrant flavors.  The tapas style menu really allows you to try many different things.

Caprese was pretty good. The best thing we had was the crudo, with a variety of raw fish. The pasta course had some good dishes (risotto) and some that weren't so good (lobster gnocchi). The meat course was the least impressive. Mediocre beef, pasta with way too much truffle (no idea why this was part of the meat course, anyway).

The real downside was the service. The waitstaff was VERY aggressive when leaving and taking plates, bumping everyone at the table, elbowing, had food spilled on me twice with no apology. Also, the sommelier was incredibly aggressive. After our dinner host opted not to order more bottles of wine, the somm came back again and seemed sort of put off, asking again about more wine, and when he was told again we didn't want a FOURTH bottle, he went to the opposite end of the table and sort of rudely put the wine list in front of individuals asking if anybody wanted glasses of wine.

While the Belagio hotel and casino is nicely decorated, the bright blue and white decor of Lago is nice and refreshing. 
We arrived early for our reservation and were seated out on the enclosed patio. It's a great place to sit. You miss the excitement of the main room, but it's nice.
We started with the Fegatini di Pollo, the chicken liver crostini - toasted bread. It was the hit of the night. Also, Tonno Crudo di Pesce, Ahi tuna with orange segments. Delicious. A pasta di Pesce, 7 & 7, the potato and lobster plate was another hit. The Impepata di Cozze, PEI mussels were plump and juicy, about the best mussels we've had.
Deserts were just perfect, little cannolis and panna cada was absolutely delicious. 
Carlos gave us great service.
Of course, a great room, a creative executive chef, good food well-prepared and well-served might all be for naught without high-class service from support waitstaff. We got that from Elmer. He made sure to warm up the coffee cup before bringing it to the table.
However, the best example of the type of service provided at Lago occurred at the next table over. When the diner requested fresh garlic with her sea bass entree, she was told the chef had none. But in just a few minutes, about the time it took to run over to one of the nearby Belagio restaurants, staff delivered a small bowl of the requested, chopped garlic! Promptly laden onto the Bass.
We look forward to a return visit to Lago. Hopefully, we'll be lucky to have Carlos and Elmer give us their excellent service.",dbELeRFW0v_bXybQNfb-_g,2,1,5,SsKtM4WF0vjYclqLFK2jXg

Pesce.  This was raw fish, like sashimi or ceviche. We had the ahi tuna with the orange segments.  Very fresh and subtle. Delicious. The salmon with the caper was also interesting. Also fresh, but more savory.

Crabmeat Salad.  Crab with quinoa and baby greens. Tastes as fancy as it sounds. Again, it was fresh and luxurious.

Gnocchi.  We had both kinds, the plain with blue cheese and the potato ones with lobster. Both were delicious, especially the latter. It was such a good pairing.
 
Crostini. Very simple dish, with tomatoes and basil. Kind of expensive for what it is.

Deli Meats. There was prosciutto, salami, and bresaola. Good but nothing special. Maybe I'm not enough of a connoisseur to be able to distinguish between this and what I can get at Trader Joe's.

Lamb Ragu Pasta. I don't generally like lamb, but this was quite good. It was rich but I didn't taste any gaminess. 

Beef tenderloin. This was amazing. Cooked just right. It was tender and flavorful.

After the short wait they were actually able to place us directly on the patio at a front and center table with amazing views of the fountain show.

- nice place to go with a large group. The food is served as small plates, great for sharing
- good options for many palates (my co-worker is a vegetarian and she found lots of things that worked for her)
- location is lovely especially at night to watch the Bellagio fountains
- OUTSTANDING items: (1) polenta; (2) pasta with a bolognase (it had lamb in the sauce and the pasta was tubular - like a rigatoni); (3) seafood risotto;, (4) their house limocello; (5) bread with soft cheese and honey 

CONS
- We had a reservation for 8 and arrived at 8:10 (our bad). They said they would have a table in 20 minutes but we actually didn't get seated until about 9. But on the plus side, they did bring some complimentary cheese and meat, which was a nice touch.
- I thought the service was just okay - would have expected more from an upscale restaurant in this city. I had to ask for extra spoons and plates a couple of times
- Besides the above mentioned items, the food was pretty good, not great. On the ""meh"" list: hamachi crudo, spaghetti with seafood (frutti de mare), asparagus

I ordered the Papardelle with zucchini Ragu. Oh my god, there were literally 5 pieces of pasta in my plate. My husband ordered the Fussili with lamb ragu.  While the taste was not too bad, the size is ridiculous for the price.  Imagine a very small bowl (the small bowl is the center of a big plate - looking big but very small in reality) that was the plate. There were literally 10 pieces of fussili in the plate with some ragu on it.  My mom ordered something with mushroom which turned out to be a side (and the menu does not say side) and my dad ordered fussili as well.  

Tables are a few inch apart and you can hear your neighbors conversations.  The waiters bumped into my seat like a million times (sooooooooo annoying).  The view is absolutely beautiful.  Staff was OK.  We had a reservation and we were seated right away.  

I understand the concept of smaller plates and quality food BUT here they have really small plates with not much quality.  We have tried from the cheapest restaurants to the most expensive ones where you spend serious $$$$$ but this one is on the low end and we will not go back again.

Our reservation was for 7:30, we got sat around 8 which I'm fine with since we were about 7 minutes late and I work in a restaurant so I understand how it is. It was our two year anniversary and I've never been to a fancy nice restaurant. 

Our server, John, was amazing. Huge props to him for handing many tables at once. He still stopped by after we got every dish within two minutes which is a huge thing for my boyfriend and I (2 bites 2 minutes rule encase anything was messed up), got us drinks when he noticed they were half way done, and he basically suggested every plate that we had! He's very good at what he does. I'll definitely ask for him when we come back. 
Our food came out way quicker than I expected. Nothing took more than 15 minutes which was amazing! The first things we had were the brasato d'anatra and the ravioli al gamberi. The brasato.. I was literally slapped in the face with how phenomenal it was. Honestly no words can describe the flavors I had in my mouth. So many different flavors and it was so delicious. Pretty creamy too and it was just so delightful to eat we almost ordered it again. The ravioli was the worst thing we had there yet it was still amazing. Then we ordered the fusillioro. This was my second favorite plate that we had. I would trust these cooks with my life if it was based off this cooking. The risotto di fruti mare was amazing too. The clams were seasoned amazingly, scallops cooked to perfection, lobster was very tender, not a bad thing about this dish. John recommended an amazing dessert that he paid for since it was a celebration. It was the giandujotto. It's not too heavy like most desserts. You can easily compare it to a ferrero rocher. 

Our tab was $99.99. Good pricing for such an amazing meal and the location!
 We saw about 4 water shows in total. Extremely gorgeous. 

I'm a very happy person right now. Thank you Lago for making our anniversary dinner amazing. We WILL be back. (:",Nhk0jTP2gkU12G4LHJVR3A,4,3,5,XvKGmtygf6qUe7R-7wL2Jw

I realize garlic isn't a thing in real Italian, just a personal preference. The caprese didn't have enough basil, EVOO or aged balsamic and the tomatoes were again bland. 

I had a main course (large plate) of lobster and squid ink pasta. The lobster was OK but for $65 I would have expected better taste. My wife got two small plates (pesto and veggie pasta with Arabbiatta sauce). The pesto was OK, but the Arabbiatta was boring and filled with the cheapest veggies available (sqaush and carrots).

2787428,2018-04-24,11,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Great pick for a classy dinner while in Vegas. 

Not just because the food is delicious (more on that later) but also because of the location. Lago overlooks the fountains at the Bellagio and at night when the fountains light up the view is absolutely beautiful. We weren't lucky enough to snag outdoor seating but you can still catch this from inside because of how many big windows there are.

Food is small plates Italian and everything comes out FAST. So if you want to order course by course to see how much food you'll need you can definitely do that. We were pretty hungry and ordered 5 plates amongst the two of us. I'd say you need at least 4 plates for dinner because they are pretty small.

To start we had the burrata which was actually my least favorite part of the meal. The plate came with a generous portion of cheese but for some reason it didn't look or taste like burrata. It felt more like a ricotta cheese dip. Not bad, but not what we were expecting. And a little frustrating because burrata comes with a heftier price tag.

Luckily the rest of the meal made up for it. Gnocchi with lobster chunks is a must get. This comes in a delicious pink sauce and the lobster is oh so decadent. Crab, artichoke and parmesan are three of my favorite things independently, so on a plate together this was unreal good. This dish felt fresh and healthy, almost like a salad. I loved how it was topped with multicolored cherry tomatoes. And there was a very generous portion of crab in the dish. Veal and ricotta stuffed pasta - the mans favorite. Very small portion - three little dumplings but so rich that it did not need to be larger. And finally to round out the meal we put in an order of meatballs which were classic and tasty. Sounds like alot of food, but both pasta dishes were only a few small bites. 

For drinks we went with cocktails -- I had some sort of fruity vodka drink and it was light and refreshing. They also brought out a piece of cake that said happy birthday and a candle for my fiance's birthday upon request. Super sweet and he really enjoyed it! The cake was chocolate espresso... 'nuff said.

A pricey meal, but what else could you expect at The Bellagio - especially when cocktails and lobster are thrown into the mix. For a similar meal expect to spend around 100 PP. But, for delicious food in a swanky setting this is worth it.",84t6jpyclA55TMfMV0X0kA,27,19,5,RmXx_ARzoRt1A0mI8QC2cQ

My husband and I went there before going to the O show. We do not mind paying the price if the food is worth it. Lago is supposedly an Italian restaurant. We love good Italian restaurants. Judging by the menu, this one seemed promising. However, Lago's cuisine was just not up to par. I selected the mushroom risotto. The rice was undercooked and the whole thing tasted as if it had come from a dry food package.  No depth to it whatsoever. The same with my husband's small portion of pasta ai frutti di mare, which cost $29.

My boyfriend and I thought this would be a perfect choice for a fancier night out. However, while sitting at the bar waiting for our drinks, a group of people sat next to us in flip flops and tank tops.

Located in the Bellagio resort on the water facing the fountains. We had a lovely view of the fountains which we requested. Even 3 days before we arrived we were able to get this spot because we were willing to go early. We made a reservation at 5:15 PM. 

Amazing views from the balcony and the weather was so mild. The view was spectacular from our table. The food was equal or the view. 

The style here is what the waiter called: Italian tapas. Small plates.

We started with:
The Cesare which was made with baby romaine, anchovy dressing and
ciabatta croutons. Delicious.

Next we had Bruschetta al Pomodoro which was tomatoes, basil, garlic oil. Delicious. Could taste every ingredient. 

Next was Patate al Forno, roasted potatoes, rosemary. Good, not spatacular. Just roasted fingerling potatoes. Nothing special.

Next was Polenta al Formaggio which was 3 cheeses soft polenta. WOW, best polenta I have ever eaten. Soft, creamy, cheesy; Outstanding. We should have ordered 2 of these. Sooo oh good.

Next was Cannelloni comprised of pulled short ribs, parmesan fonduta, tomato sauce. Ok, but not that great. The short ribs was a sort of puree and felt strange in my mouth. Not that flavorful. I would pass.

Last was 7 & 7 which was potato gnocchi, lobster knuckles,
salsa di crostacei. Outstanding. Soft pillows of gnocchi with succulent lobster knuckles. So good.

We skipped desert as we were so full. I will be honest the desert did not look that great, but maybe it was because we were so full

We mentioned about anniversary once, in our Open Table booking, but they certainly took that into account and gave us a table by the gorgeous Bellagio fountain. Moreover, they added a special message on our dessert too.

I was not dreased in a suit or black tie such as others, but did not expect to be treated as if I was not a paying customer.

As we were escorted to be seated, the host stated rudely, ""Let's see what happens."" I'm not sure what he meant, but when we saw where our seats were, I figured he was talking about the location of our table. Our view was obstructed from the fountains and there were not enough heaters to warm up the amount of people sitting outside. 

You pay for the experience and most importantly the food that Lago has to offer. Here is a list of where Lago has failed to meet any paying customer's or foodie's expectations:

- cocktails (whiskey sour) were made incorrectly. Watered down and egg whiteless
- bread was not offered
- the oyster shooter was disgusting. Seemed like everyone around us ignored it, hoping it would be taken away
- the lobster cannelloni was room temperature
- the main dishes were okay, temperature was correct, but again had high expectations. Hoping that this main dish would save the night.

Lunch was Bronzino Livornese presented on slow roasted sweet tomatoes with capers and olives. The fish had a crispy seasoned skin and the plate was finished with plump roasted Asparagus.

My wife and I visit Vegas at least several times per year, always reside at Bellagio, and dine almost exclusively at Lago, we love it that much.

General Manager Albert Najem is always the most gracious of hosts, ensuring each of our visits is enjoyable and memorable.

It's true, this is at times a very busy and boisterous establishment, which in my opinion, adds to the overall dining experience.  Few restaurants I'm aware of could handle this volume all the while maintaining very high quality product and service.  We've never received inadequate service here, and are especially partial to Servers Denise, Jennifer, and Marcello.  All three have award winning personalities and never fail to lavish us with truly flawless service.  I should also laud the impeccable wine service from Lead Sommelier Jeffrey Bencus.

While we've never actually encountered a disappointing dish here, a few of our personal favorites are unequivocally the Cannelloni, Linguine Al Pesto, Risotto Di Fruiti Mare, Salmon, and...the Cannoli is absolutely to die for.

We also dined last week at Picasso, which was profoundly exceptional, and I ventured over to the Aria one day for a quick bite (and wine) at Julian Serrano Tapas.

Great, service, great food, great ambience!

We got there around 5:30 and was able to get a table next to the window with a nice view of the fountain. The food here is all tapa style so don't expect to get full just off of one dish. They recommend about 3-4 dishes per person, which was about right. We ordered about 1-2 dishes at a time so that we can gauge how full we were and how many more to order.

We ordered the following:
1. We started off with the caprese. It was a great start!  It's a simple dish, but they stepped it up a notch. Instead of drizzling the balsamic vinegar over it, it actually have these balsamic vinegar ""caviar"" so that it pops in your mouth when you bite into it.  It was so good that we got another one!
2. Tonno Crudo and Salmon Crudo - not bad, but not great either...probably wouldn't order again. If I'm eating raw fish, probably should have stuck with ""Yellowtail"" restaurant next door. But I'm such a fan of sushi and crudo that I had to try it. 
3. Branzino - good tender fish
4. Capasanta (scallop) - tasted good, but felt that the scallops could have been a little bigger in size
5. 7&7 (potato gnocchi with lobster knuckle) - excellent !!!  the gnocchi had a nice crunch on the outside and very moist on the inside. The lobster add a nice elegance to the dish. 
6. Caraofi & Granch (artichoike with crab) - excellent !!! This dish, along with the 7&7 above, round out our evening very well.

I would have ordered dessert because all the pictures I saw posted were just beautiful, but frankly we were so full from dinner.

All throughout the meal, we saw one fountain show after another. Great food! Great show!  It can't get any better than this. 

Would definitely come back to Lago again. Yes, it is on the pricey side...but eating in Vegas is all about the culinary experience! So if you can afford to splurge, this is definitely the place to do it. The fact that you get a fountain show with your meal just makes you feel like you are getting a full dinner package.

All tapas dishes in the menu are less than 20$, the most expensive one is 25$. There are some main courses which are bigger size and can go up to 50$.
We were offered with a special dish which was white truffle risotto. The server mentioned it is an appetizer size. He did not say anything about the price. Saying its a small dish I assumed it will be around the same price as the other tapases which is around 25$.
When we got the bill I saw he charged me 70$! Apparently it had real truffle pieces. How am I suppose to know that or know that truffle is very expensive. When a dish exceeds the normal restaurant prices by 3 times more I except the server to mention it. This just feels like they try to tricked us.

Ambiance - 5
Service - 4
Food - 4
Value - 2.75
Other - 2

Inside the bellagio, with a perfect view of the fountains. This is a pretty cool spot, that I probably don't need to visit again. Here's why: if you see my ratings above, I'll start with the 2 that I said for other. This place is too dang hot to be in nicer clothes lol. The heat plus the water, and a constant opening of the door to the patio, makes for somewhat of a steam box, not sure about the rest of my party, but I was pretty uncomfortable. I just want to be refreshed while eating, not sweating.

Besides that, the restaurant is beautiful, probably better to visit during winter months. Service is really good.

Now the food, they kind of have a tapas concepts in addition to a few normal main entree selections. Everything we ate was pretty good, my issue is with the value. The tapas concept is a lot of small plates, but here, all the small plates are on the slightly expensive side. Like $17 for a small portion of pasta or risotto. Thinking back to tapas in Barcelona, dishes were like $5-8 and you would get a bunch of items. I'm not going to get a bunch of $17 items....

That being said, we did have a group of 8, and we did share some amongst ourselves. My wife and I ended up getting the clams, the sauce and bread are perfect! I also got the seafood risotto which was good, but still hungry ha. Also got one of the pastas, again, pretty good but not 5 bites $17 good lol.

It's a nice place, just not sure I would be back.",BeWDEj2Lj9L31HtFfZGn1w,4,0,3,aCpKwO9usuZsIbG4iOGPnA

being on the more upscale side, there weren't too many kid-friendly plates.  we decided on a pizza and our waiter suggested a modification to the menu and it worked out great. 

this is a tapas style restaurant but we did not need to order that much to be full.  we had a pizza, 4 tapas dishes and a main dish and that was more than enough for 2 adults and 2 children

We absolutely love small plate set ups as we enjoy eating the most variety in the least amount of time and being able to share a meal.  On this trip we had al  cipolloto e speck, capasanta, the 7 & 7, & the fusillioro.  The cipolloto e speck is a buffalo ricotta mini pizza that was delightful.  The 7&7 consisted of potato gnocchi and lobster knuckles, the flavors were so good together.  The capasanta was so refreshing and delicate in taste.  Scallop, blood orange, and pistachio.....this flavor combination is sublime.  The fusillioro was a pasta dish with lamb ragu.  Tasty but my personal least favorite of the selection we ordered.  Which isn't against the establishment, more of a personal preference.  The other dishes were just so very unique compared to this one.  You can't go wrong with any of the items that you may order on your visit to Lago.  The drinks are fantastic also.  Mine came with a spherical ice cube with an edible flower encased in the ice.

3100322,2015-09-24,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"To preface, I visit Vegas every year. Actually twice a year. Yep I love Vegas that much. Can't help :) Lately though I haven't been blown away by restaurants on The Strip lately. Boy, I surprised myself that I enjoyed the food so much at Lago. Honestly the food was so good that I could see it succeeding in Chicago where I live. In fact if Lago was in Chicago instead, I'd make it one of my regular go-to places. 

The tuna crudo was absolutely fresh and amazing. There were only four pieces (thicker than your usual crudo for sure) but the quality truly made up for it and I'm for quality over quantity if the quality truly meets expectations). I didn't want it to end. 

The beef carpaccio was thinly sliced and refreshing. Not gonna lie -- I would have liked it better if there was less things going on top of the carpaccio. I'm a purist so maybe it's personal preference. It would be great to put the main focus on the pureness and freshness of the beef itself. Still a wonderful dish nevertheless. 

The veal was a cold dish and thinly sliced. It was my first time eating veal served this way. Very nice and not heavy!

After all the relatively light dishes, the clam spaghetti was carb heaven :) Really enjoyed it a lot.

Final important thing: Lago makes solid cocktails. I've been lately so disappointed with cocktails (mainly old fashioned and Negroni) served at places on The Strip. The old fashioned just doesn't taste as good (and I'm comparing it to Chicago, NY, London etc). Why why why. My husband ordered a negroni and I got a Boulevardier (negroni made with rye whiskey instead of gin) and both were SOLID. We later tried one of their signature cocktails made from whiskey (I forget the name) which was also solid.

It was our last night in Vegas so it made a wonderful cap to the our vacation. It definitely helped chase the coming-to-the-end-of-vacation blues away :))) I can't wait to be back.

Side note: Some reviews complained the food is overpriced. Need to be realistic. It's the Strip. It's at the Bellagio. It will be more expensive. Even a salad at the poolside is expensive. And heck even McDonalds in Vegas is expensive.",-pG4fm6eWoGLP6fIsFBvzw,3,4,5,dFn9vOJeqROtlfVAu86RpA

Out of all the times that I've dined here, I've never had any complaints.

I would recommend getting a table in this area for first timers! Especially at night, since the water fountain show comes on about every 30 minutes at night. You'll have a perfect view! But don't worry about those nights that seem too cold. They have plenty of heat lamps all around the outside.

Customer service is always great here. Don't be afraid to ask questions on what the staff recommends. Sometimes they'll even offer suggestions that pertain to the number of guests in your group, like the customizations of portions.

Fusilli with Lamb Ragu
Focaccia with cheese and honey. 
Gnocchi with Blue Cheese - Not sure what they were actually called, you'll figure it out. 

Personally not a huge dessert person, but tried a few of them and they all were great. Other people at the table were blown away by the Tirimisu, Panna Cotta, and some sort of Nutella/Hazlenut magic.

3123408,2016-03-22,2,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"The view was excellent...but that's it.  Not worth the money.

I was here on a recent Saturday night with a group of 6 other people.  The troubles began right away.  We arrived at 9:00 for our 9:00 reservation.  A couple of guys were a couple of minutes late due to having to walk over from the Bellagio. The restaurant told us to let them know when the rest of the group arrived. That's fine, I understand the desire to not seat incomplete parties.   We took a seat in the bar area. BUT, by 9:06 everyone had arrived and we let them know.  Despite that, they didn't seat us until 9:30.  No apologies, no acknowledgement at all that they had botched things.  However, it could have been worse. There was another group of about 10 people that had apparently been waiting 90 minutes beyond their reservation time.

Once we sat down, the service was slooooooooow. They may have just been understaffed, I couldn't tell. But, regardless, it took forever for our waitress to take our order. It then took a long time for the food to come out, and when it did there were some mixups with the orders.

I could look past the service problems if the food was truly excellent...but it wasn't. The food was overpriced for the quality and the alcohol was absurdly expensive. $18 for a small mojito?! Really?  That being said, the cocktail was the best thing about the meal for me, but several of my friends had their drink orders screwed up (who serves a martini on the rocks in a small tumbler, honestly?).

I had mushroom risotto where the rice was significantly undercooked and the flavors were underwhelming.  I followed that up with a braised duck on top of polenta.  It was ok, but I don't feel like it was anything I couldn't have gotten at Carabba's for half the price.  My experience wasn't unique, I think everyone in my group was fairly unhappy with the experience.

My parents and husband and I celebrated my mom's 65th birthday at Julian Serrano's newest restaurant in the Bellagio, and they showed us the best time. Memorably warm and attentive service, memorably dramatic and beautiful fountain views, and memorably fun and satisfying dishes.

We had chicken liver crostinis, guanciale and fava focaccia, green and white asparagus, margherita pizza, corkscrew pasta with lamb ragu, risotto with red wine and burrata, potato gnocchi with lobster knuckles, and the softest meatballs, and this--about two dishes per person--was the perfect sized meal. My favorite dish was the risotto with red wine and burrata--it hit all of my comfort food markers for being soft and creamy and savory, and a little tangy. I also loved the chicken livers, and the doughiness of the focaccia. Was anything the best I've ever eaten? No, but nothing was remotely disappointing! This is beautiful Italian food--sometimes very subtle or simple, but always very pleasing.

A note on the cocktails and wine list--the cocktails are strong and the pours are very generous. Don't let the price tag turn you away.

Patio dining situates you directly next to the water show. The interior decor is beautiful. The white walls provide a bright space highlighted by the wall decorations and accented by the dark multi color flooring. 
Our server Brian was helpful in explaining the menu and attentive in following up though out the meal. The menu provides a choice of many small plates with an option to choose a large main course. Our starter was the bruschetta which was a pretty standard arrangement. I would have preferred less crunch in the bread and more garlic. The choice of sides were roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary and a combination of green and white asparagus. The potatoes were shaped like small slices of bread and cooked perfectly. The asparagus was outstanding, cooked al dente and topped with melted Parmesan cheese. The two entrees of choice were a 4 oz. filet of beef tenderloin and a plate of veal piccata. The filet was cooked as ordered and served with a rich veal reduction on the side, juicy and tender. The veal consisted of 3 perfectly cooked pieces in a wonderful caper sauce. Brian suggested that we order 3 to 4 small plates and his recommendation was spot on, just the right amount of food. The finale was tiramisu. The Lago rendition is served with a side of ice cream that melds perfectly with the cake. The desert was exactly to our liking.

3260973,2017-06-25,1,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"I had a friend visiting from out of state so I decided to take him out to the famous Juliano Serrano concept Lago. We had a reservation for 2 yesterday the 22nd at 10pm for a table overviewing Bellagio fountain. The good part is that we got there and immediately we have been seated. This was all the good part of our experience.  
Now let's talk about the bad part of our experience . We have ordered a bottle of vine for the two , Caesar salads as entrees and Beef Tenderloin with grilled asparagus and roasted potatoes for main. For almost $400 dinner you would expect a nicer service but let's not get into it since we are sure nobody cares as they would fill that table up with new visitors at any given moment of the day. 
LETS TALK ABOUT THE FAMOUS FOOD OF LAGO:
Caesar Salad- 4 bottom end pieces of romain heart with sprinkled cheese and few croutons being thrown into the plate. The romaine was soft and brown,no crunch to it or anything to wow us for a plate that cost almost as a main course . 
We didn't eat the entrees and we kept sipping on the wine waiting for the main course. 
12 to 15min after the entree was served the server arrives with the main . We looked at each other and thought the same thing. Why are they pushing the food so fast on us. But anyway we started eating our main and keep staying positive enjoying the night. We have ordered the steak medium well and the asparagus grilled. What's was served to us was a bloody rare steak with 1"" thick boiled skinned asparagus. Disgusting. 
We sent the food back to get fixed . They brought back the same plate but with charbroil grill lines on the same food we sent back. The steak was black burned on the outside ,the asparagus was the same boiled product but now has nicely presented with the black grill lines on it. Still mushy and soft at bite. 
We decided not to complain anymore since they were closing and obviously didn't care about fixing their mistakes. We eat what we could, finish our vine and move on with our night.

The seating area makes you think of 2 different places in one, the front area is very laid back with high top areas around the bar and the dining room is sleek and modern with seating along floor to ceiling windows with great views. One of the cocktails I tried was a raspberry bubbly and another with blood orange, both good, although the orange was on the bitter side. The dessert we shared was also raspberry and the chocolate and both were winners. By comparison, the food fell very short. We had 2 different pizettes which were both bland, and the sausage had a different texture. The caprese salad which I normally adore was bland, along with a strange flavor from the balsamic. This is not par for the coarse at a Bellagio restaurant. If the food had some flavor and a dash of seasoning, it could have been better.

3333541,2017-04-20,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"This review is for 3.5 stars.

I came for a nice business lunch hearing about the prix fixe meal available during the weekdays.  The menu cost $28 and included an appetizer (seafood salad, minestrone, mixed plate, or caprese salad), an entree (lasagna, branzino, pizza) and then a dessert (chocolate, gelato, lemon cake).  We went with the caprese salad and lasagna for one person and the minestrone and branzino for the other.  We then shared a lemon cake and got coffees as we weren't feeling dessert at that point.  There all also options to supplement the meal with either bigger portions r better dishes, but we opted for the basic.

Overall the minestrone came with tons of veggies and the branzino was well cooked.  I was full at the end, especially with the complimentary white bread.  The lasagna was a very interesting, thinly layered variety that was quite tasty while the caprese was just your typical of that dish.  The lemon bar was very nicely crafted and exceptionally tasting.

My biggest complaint was the waitstaff.  They firstly upsold us with garlic bread when we already had regular bread.  We assumed it came complimentary but we saw otherwise when we received the check.  Second issue was the supplement pricing.  The branzino and the pollo dish we were both interested in were $29 on the lunch entree menu but the pollo dish cost an extra $8 on the lunch prix fixe.  This seemed a little weird and the waiter didn't really have an explanation when we reacted to the pricing discrepancy.  Finally, the waiter very poorly gave us alternative options when it came to dairy constraints.  I prefer not to have dairy and the only dessert offered was gelato (non-dairy?  Really?), which I don't eat, that met this criteria.  The only substitute was coffee.  I'd rather have another appetizer or price change to the menu, but I guess that's not how it works.

After a full meal it ran us about $65.  There are definitely better priced options on the strip even for lunch but with a romantic view of the fountains and quality food for the most part, Lago is a suitable option.  For a romantic or business occasion that is easy to appeal to people with all tastes, Lago is great (if you can afford it).  For a typical Vegas lunch when staying on the strip, I would go elsewhere and save your money or a nice dinner.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,0,3,uCWrQd24_V-Tcg92LnWuxw
3343520,2018-06-03,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"I want to start off by saying that after a long week here for work I was looking forward to enjoying a great meal as I have heard such wonderful things about the food at this restaurant. I unfortunately have to give at least one star otherwise I cannot post my comments. Although the real rating is zero stars. 

The tables are too close to each other where the staff keeps on banging Into the backs of everyone's chair including many members of our party. In addition, you have busy boys without common sense moving large trays of dirty dishes and glasses when their co-workers are in the aisle. When someone in our party asked for salt and pepper, the person brought over a grinder and proceeded to explain 'S' is for salt and 'P' for pepper. I mean how condescending is that? 

The food overall was good but the environment leaves much to be desired. The worst part is that we overheard one employee say to another ""Oh they want dessert so they're not leaving soon"". This was after only being here an hour after our reservation. 

The server was nice enough but the managers/maitre d are just walking around oblivious to the chaos that is being created. They are the ones who are supposed to manage what's going on and maintaining some sort of order. 

Maybe the majority of the diners are oblivious to the lack of care to detail, but with the reputation Julian Serrano has he should be ashamed of this restaurant. 

It's a shame. I plan to tell everyone about this horrible experience so that I can save them the hassle and suggest other restaurants where their experience will be better.",j1Sdvj_rXZY2wlR3J2QFww,1,0,1,dv8xI-Xj-1IglsU7CFssLA

When the weather is nice, do ask for outside seating. You'll get to enjoy a nice view of Bellagio fountain and Paris' Eiffel tower, while having your meal. We shared a seafood salad (insalata di mare) and an antipasto platter (antipasto misto) as appetizers. The seafood salad had a refreshing taste from the grapefruit dressing and you can't go wrong with cheese and cold meat platter. For entrees, I had the sea bass (branzino livornese) and shared the octopus dish (polpo alla diavola). Both dishes were so tasty! Seafood was cooked right and tasted fresh. Flavor was just right.

3355027,2016-03-24,9,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Seems like Lago has a few mixed reviews, but I thought it was Excellent!

I read some of the negative reviews, and they were regarding cost, or their reservation time or that they were 'under-dressed' and felt uncomfortable.  Well, if you're gonna go to a fine dining establishment, then don't wear cargo shorts and flip flops and you won't feel uncomfortable, lol.  I know this is Vegas where anything goes, but people, come on, this is a really nice place, at least dress up for it.

My date actually picked this place, and I was a little concerned that it would be an Americanized Italian place loaded with red sauce or grandma's ""gravy"", one of my least favorites things in the culinary world.  But no, it was actually REAL Italian, like from Italy.  So I was really happy and impressed.

Turns out, Julian Serrano is the Executive Chef, which makes sense as he's a great chef and a James Beard Award Recipient.  Even though he's not Italian, and actually from Spain, he's taken a Tapas-style approach to Lago, so you order a number of smaller plates, rather than entrees.  This makes for a fun dinner as you get to try a number of different dishes.  Was really great and tasty.

We ordered:

- Cocktails: Cucumber Mist (vodka, cucumbers & berries) & Rossa Bellini - were both excellent!

- Wine: Bottle of French Chablis, 2010 William Fevre - excellent, but Fevre is always excellent!

- Foccacia: Ricotta cheese with sea salt & honey - very good.

- Tonno: sushi-grade Ahi Tuna topped with orange segments - delicate and perfect.

- Beef Carpaccio: with shaved Parmesan & arugula - so rich & decadent...would even make Giuseppe Cipriani (creator of Carpaccio) proud.

- Funghi Trifolati: various Mushrooms sauteed in olive oil & garlic - so tasty.

- 7&7: Potato Gnocchi with Lobster Knuckles in a shellfish sauce - omg, the gnocchi melted in your mouth and the lobster had such good flavor, maybe my favorite dish of the night.

- Fusillioro: Abruzzo-style Corkscrew Pasta with Lamb Ragu and Ricotta Mousse...wow, delicious, and my 2nd favorite dish of the night.

- Giandujotto Dessert:  Hazelnut Cream on a chocolate shell and Espresso Gelato on a chocolate cake - both a perfect ending to a great meal!


The Ambiance was awesome and the style and feel of the restaurant is modern in true Italian-style, and GORGEOUS...no red checkered tablecloths here!  My date had requested a table next to the window where we could see the Bellagio Fountain Show in all it's glory.  Sounds cheesy, I know, but it actually wasn't - was pretty romantic actually.  Never thought I'd say that about something in Vegas of all places, haha.

Service was impeccable and the Head Sommelier, Jeffrey Bencus, knew his wine and had gone to the same Somm School as myself.  So, he brought us a few tastings throughout our meal of some really great reserve wine from the cellar - French Burgundies from the '80s & '90s, so that was really special...like REALLY, REALLY special, lol.  Thousand dollar bottles of wine were talking here, and of course, this was just a sip for each of us, but nonetheless, was phenomenal to have that tasting opportunity - thanks Jeff!

We had such a wonderful meal and evening, that we were the last ones in the restaurant, which was fun to be in such a nice, big place by yourselves, and they didn't try to rush us out.

And the cost is reasonable for a fine dining restaurant in Vegas - our meal for two with a bottle of great wine was $215, which isn't bad given the quality of the food, number of dishes we had, wine, service and ambiance.

So overall, Lago is a great place, and I almost venture to say that it's the best Quasi-Fine Dining restaurant in Vegas.  I say ""quasi"" because it doesn't have that formal or serious feeling of other fine dining establishments...like a Joel Robuchon at MGM (although I enjoy it there as well) and is slightly more casual, and fun!  

Love this place!  Come. You won't be disappointed!...unless you're wearing cargo pants or shorts...then you will be, lol.",KF5TkZRP2lWigBVigLEQAA,21,17,5,E4d6m-lAhq3m5VmMVzgmVQ

Our complaint was that after we ordered, our waitress recommended an appetiser special for us to try.  It was pretty much a sashimi platter and was beautifully prepared.  Once the check arrived we saw that the sashimi platter she suggested cost more than both of our meals combined.  

Yes, I know it's my fault for not asking the price before ordering it, but the fact that she just assumed that it would be OK to throw on a $60 appetiser really says something about ethics of the server and the restaurant in general. How inconsiderate do you have to be to even suggest an appetiser of that price and not inform the guest?  I don't think will return for this reason alone.

We ordered from the prix fix lunch menu (extremely economical):
Caprese salad
Seafood salad
Housemade meatballs
Four cheese spinach lasagna
Lemon bar with limoncello
Tiramisu

The ingredients used were extremely fresh - the mozzarella is handpulled in house and the produce was bright, vibrant, and delicious. The seafood salad (with an incredibly bright grapefruit vinaigrette that paired very well) was really packed with fresh seafood. I saw clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp, scallops, and crab meat, and it was all perfectly cooked and chilled. 
The marinara sauce is the best I've ever eaten, and the meatballs and lasagna were really delicious. The concept is small plates to share, so you get several bites of each item, but you leave feeling very full. It allowed us to savor the food a little more, and it was a real treat. 
My husband's lemon bar was SO good, and the limoncello sorbet was the perfect balance of sweet and tart. It also had meringues and mango sauce, which complemented it all very well. The tiramisu was oversoaked in espresso (in my opinion, and that's largely a palate thing) leaving it too bitter, and the white chocolate ... quenelle ... was viscous and frankly, difficult to eat. The cappuccino ice cream, however, was really delicious. 
All in all, this is a must for any visitor to the strip. If you go for a late lunch or early dinner, you'll even get fountain view seating and can watch each show from the balcony.",dx7AKInh_IV9p2upy3F0MA,0,0,5,TiU2sdeGSBlQguVa_Llx0g

The restaurant would change the music at the start of each show to correspond with the display which was nice touch, though hearing my ""Heart Will Go On"" from Titanic three times during dinner was enough...

The food had some hits and misses. My table for two got 6 things to share:
-A Crab meat, artichoke, and baby greens salad- it was good but no real wow factor.
-The Alla Ricotta e Meile- Ricotta cheese and honey focaccia- SO GOOD. The ingredients were simple but delicious
-The Risotto Al vino Rosso- This was a red wine risotto with melted burrata at the bottom. I have never tasted anything like this, it was rich and incredible. I'd go back just to eat this again
-Costa Di Manzo- These short ribs had a great sauce.
-Scaloppina di Vitello- The veal piccata had great flavor, but the meat was tough.
-Creme Brule for dessert. I thought I was going to leave the meal hungry, but this dessert ensured that I did not.

Unfortunately, service here was severely lacking. We did not get out first order of drinks for about 35 minutes, other tables were seated after us and had their first round of dishes before we ordered our drinks. Often times our glasses were just sitting empty for 20-30 minutes before we were asked if we wanted another- a shame because this was a celebratory dinner and we wanted to get a little buzzed at least! The timing of the food delivery was off, no plates for long periods of times and then everything at once. At the end of the meal, we felt rushed to get out with them turning off the music, putting the lights on bright, and taking the bill from the table while we were still finishing (rude!). Why should we rush when the rest of the meal was so slow? Ultimately we would have ordered more food and drinks throughout the meal if the service had been faster, but we got sick of waiting.",KhJDf1z74gxQOVl8aJ3TwQ,1,0,3,-vO01YAOnwYHnEIlupO7CQ

I was able to watch 2 of the water shows which was great because I didn't have to watch it outside in the Las Vegas heat. The interior of the restaurant is modern and clean. 

Lago serves Italian tapa dishes. You usually order a few dishes to share with your table. Everything I ordered was something unique which I haven't tried before. I got 4 dishes with my boyfriend which was more than enough. We ended up having leftovers.

3500772,2015-05-19,7,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"I came to Lago during my birthday weekend with 10 other guests. Right off the bat, the open and refreshing atmosphere really makes the experience what it is and the environment is wonderful for socializing and being happy! Lago is located in the Bellagio and sits in the center overlooking the large pond/water show outside and has a clear view of the strip. Similar to its Spanish sister restaurant Julian Serrano (which I ate at the night before), Lago serves small plates with a few options for larger individual portions.  Wether you are with a large or small group, small plates really is the way to go. Not only do you get to try a maximum amount of food, but the food comes out at all different times throughout the night and really facilitates a social eating experience.  Because of the pure amount of food we ordered I was not about to try everything but ill give a run down of what I did try...

Baked Ricotta with balsamic and rocket - probably the most disappointing dish of the night. The ricotta was so bland and the tiny amount of balsamic really didn't liven it up. I was hoping they would have some sort of burrata on their menu but they don't... ($9)

Bruschetta - pretty basic, nothing extraordinary but solid (btw they come two to a plate but we doubled up which is why my photo has 4) ($7)

Margherita and Zucchine pizzas - small individual sized pizzas that come with 4 slices a piece. Best part was the crust - great fluffy texture and prepared well ($14/$11)

Insalate Sarda- I guess their play on a caprese ... white/red/green tomatoes stacked with cucumbers and topped with (again, kinda bland) ricotta cheese. a refreshing dish, nothing with crazy flavor but good. ($14)

Gnocchi Alla Romana - I'd say my favorite dish of the night - soft pillowy gnocchi topped with a gorgonzola creme sauce. The menu is a little deterring because it says it is topped with blue cheese instead of gorgonzola. It's easy to tell good gnocchi from bad, and this stuff is good ($14)

Paccheri Al Telefono - essentially lasagna. not sure why their name has a telephone refrence but hey, pretty darn good and simple lasagna ($15)

Polletto - half roasted chicken on  a bed of roasted eggplant. one of their larger plates, prepared well and the chicken was juicy and flavorful ($28)

Costa Di Manzo - braised short ribs - fall apart tender in a great reduction sauce, I highly reccomend! ($19)

Cucumber Mist Cocktail - a good go to for a refreshing fruity vodka drink plus it comes with some fresh cucumber and blueberries so you can feel healthy ($17)

There were more dishes on the table I was much too full to try, but overall I had a great dining experience here. They even brought me out a birthday dessert! Service was fast and the servers explained each dish as they came out.  Vegas dining can be a little iffy and although Lago is definitely not a cheap food destination, I'd say it's well worth a visit on your next Vegas getaway.",JPlhAwHnoCQGcljqs9GA5A,10,7,4,RTqbcbGkQmIkTjjlFq6MJA

We kindly got a courtesy call from the restaurant as a reminder and I thought that was a nice gesture they did.  Upon getting seated after checking in, we noticed our table was going to be right in between the lobby of the hotel and the edge of the restaurant.. We were hoping for a table more to the window side to see the Bellagio fountain but oh well. Because the wait time was a little longer than anticipated after our reservation time, we received complimentary champagne which was amazing! 

We then got our drinks and food ordered shortly after getting seated. I ordered the Risotto Di Fruti Di Mare which comes with lobster, scallop, shrimp, clams and tomatoes. My best friend ordered a pasta dish. Both were amazing! I really recommend the risotto. Really well done and the right portion so you're not extremely full nor hungry. There is also complimentary house bread that was offered to our table. My other friends had steak and asparagus type of entrees. Unfortunately 2 of them got really sick from their steak and I'm not quite sure why or what happened but from my experience, this place was great for me.

3519598,2015-06-23,3,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"I almost forgot that I had a food voucher for Lago from the Yelp Gold Elite event. Luckily, I remembered to use it a few days before it expired. Without requesting it, they sat us on the patio with a great view of the fountains and Paris. 

Wanting to start out light, the Insalata sarda ($14) was good option with its ripe heirloom tomatoes and subtle salinity from the ricotta. Following that were the citrus dominated flavors combined with tuna crudo in their Tonno ($19) dish.

Almost all of the dishes after that were a hit. The 7 and 7 ($19) was my favorite, with supple yet seared gnocchi along with little nuggets of lobster meat with a savory and herbaceous salsa di crostacei. The risotto al vino rosso ($17) was a dish I sampled at the Yelp event, but had to get it again because it was so good. Less successful was the chalky and grainy chicken liver in the Fegatini di pollo ($8).

For those with smaller appetites they've got a 4oz angus beef tenderloin ($20) topped with gorgonzola. It's pre-sliced, making it easy to share with others. Likewise, the branzino livornese ($16) arrived table side cut into shareable servings. The skin was crispy, the meat was flaky, there was acidity from the tomatoes, and salt from the olives giving it varying degrees of flavor and texture. For a side, we tried the funghi trifoliate ($11) containing a few different types of mushrooms coated in olive oil and parsley.

While I'm not crazy about the futuristic decor, the concept and execution of the dishes are something I do like. Add to that a small patio with a great view and you've got a restaurant that should draw in a diverse crowd of young and old looking for an affordable meal, which is almost unheard of in the Bellagio.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,5,4,4,WRN43-KMabIOtGJO0jEd7w

As expected, the portions are quite small, but for what you get, are not overpriced in my opinion. Our server suggested 3-4 plates per person, and I think we settled on 7 total, which was plenty. The Capasanta alla Putanasca and 7&7 were my favorite!

The wine menu is extensive, with bottles ranging from $60 to several thousand. Service was great (I really do disagree with anyone else on here stating that the service is poor. It isn't.) and the servers were knowledgeable. Highly recommended!",Uy6cLDB5DDLiEswtBqtxTg,0,0,5,Hu4V-BKS1RDV9_Og2Uqi7w

My husband wears consistently the same style clothing-button down shirt, knee length shorts and leather flip flop type shoes. As mentioned before, we have been to the restaurant many times, this time we were accosted at the hostess stand about my husband's foot wear being unacceptable! In addition to this we had a 6:15pm reservation and on arrival (as directed by website) requested patio seating, we were told it would be a 2 hour wait. Seatings are limited to 2 hours so.......if dinner begins at 5pm.....7pm would be second seating.

3580586,2016-10-26,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"We loved everything about this restaurant!
It was our last day in Vegas and my husband was in the mood for Italian.  I wanted something outdoors to enjoy our last bit of warm weather.  Lago was our answer.
We visited during lunch where they have a prix fix menu for $28 per person.  This includes your choice of appetizer, entree and dessert.  The restaurant is more tapas style so our server warned us about size, but we found the portions to be plenty, especially with the three courses.
We were seated pretty quickly at a nice outdoor table.  The place settings have logo cloth napkins and stylish plates.
Your server will ask if you want sparkling or still water.  If you don't request tap water you'll end up paying $8 for a bottle of Fiji water.  
We ordered the tuna appetizer.  It was a different take on ahi style tuna with a refreshing citrus flavor.  It was, however, just four small pieces, so pricey for what you got.
For appetizers we got the seafood salad and the antipasto.  Both were nicely presented with larger portions than we were expecting.  The seafood was fresh and refreshing.  I just wish there had been more lobster (but who wouldn't want more lobster).  The antipasto was arranged with meat on the bottom around the center with cheese and olives in the center.  There was enough for both of us to try some. 
My husband had the lasagna as his entree.  It has a unique look (being mostly green) but with every bite he took, there was mention of just how good the lasagna was.  I had the beef carpaccio.  It was pretty standard carpaccio but very tasty.  It was served with bread crisps.
Desserts were almost too pretty to eat!  There were two choices so we got one of each. A lemon cake with a lemon sorbet and a chocolate cake with chocolate gelato.  A perfect way to end such a lovely meal.
Courses were spaced out well and we had enough time to enjoy each without feeling rushed or like there was a lag.
We loved our experience and will return again next time we're in Vegas.",_VTEyUzzH92X3w-IpGaXVA,3,0,5,FQC-q6jBjZFSL6tSBpZPvw

3596839,2015-07-22,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"I really like the idea of Italian ""tapas"", the view is perfect, it's a very hip & happening place, yet we were less than overwhelmed by the whole experience.

Even though we had a reservation, requested window front, M-life Gold, special occasion dining on a Sunday night, we had to wait more than 20 minutes for our two top table, three tables off the windows, while watching a group of six (with no reservation) walk in to a corner window table and a group of three with no reservation walk in to a window table seating.  So, when you start off on that kind of note, it's hard to overcome first impressions when there are so many choices in Vegas.

Our server was great and attentive until we ordered, and then he disappeared.  Runners delivered our food, and there was a check-in after we'd finished our dishes.  Other wait staff refilled our water and we poured our own wine (not a big deal, but really?).  The Somm did a great job of putting us on a good Barbaresco.

The restaurant smelled delicious, we saw beautiful dishes going out all around us, and we just didn't order the right things.  The salumi platter was great, as was the cheese board, but no one explained what each of the items were when the runners dropped them off.   Some we knew or could make an educated guess.  But once we chose not to have the Iberico jamon or truffle add-on, apparently we were lost causes.  The quail saltimbocca was good, but the sage overpowered the delicateness of the quail and we could have been eating any non-descript white meat.  No one asked us if we wanted dessert.  The check just appeared.

The decor is great.  Love the Mediterranean blues and water theme.  It was very noisy, with the background music and lots of hard surfaces and high ceilings, so it was difficult to carry on a conversation.

I really wanted to like Lago, and it was fine.  Good.  Acceptable.  But the overall experience just left us a bit flat.  Which is a shame because we have eaten at both Julian Serrano at Aria & Picasso.  Maybe our expectations were too high.",jHHRH62tCYNZnh85uMzkJg,1,0,3,3OoAOBfTgR-n4T5gdMQflg

That's one of the perks of being Yelp Elite/Yelp Gold Elite status. Thats the same thing IMO when you have a  Food critic and /or food blogger coming  in for a meal and at the end, a bill is not presented? A free meal is a free meal any which way you look at it, and who doesn't love free???  Like the saying goes, ""Don't hate the playa, hate the game! LMAO!!! SMH.....

ANYWHO.....

Chef Julian Serrano and his team take your tastebuds on a culinary voyage through the regions of Italy providing you with a plethora of small plates(and they are small!)
which are meant for sharing, and so that you may experience a variety of bites too. They suggest about 3-4 plates per person, but of course, you be the judge of your appetite! Our  view overlooking the fountains added a nice romantic tough as well. If you plan to dine here, the outdoor patio is where its at.

We went straight for the jugular and ordered up the OSSO BUCCO and SQUID INK GARGANELLI WITH LOBSTER which were good(both were a bit bland, especially the lobster and polenta), but even better IMHO are the LAMB CHOPS and 7&7 LOBSTER KNUCKLES AND POTATO GNOCCHI. Another overlooked dish that is a must order is the QUAIL SALTIMBOCA. The MARGHERITA PIZZA is fit for a 4 or 5 year old, and dishes worth repeating are the SCALLOP PUTTANESCA, RISOTTO WITH TRIPE,. MUSHROOMS, AND MINT(better this time than at the Yelp event), and my favorite, the GRILLED OCTOPUS WITH SQUID INK COUSCOUS. Dessert wise, the PANNA COTTA, BIANCOMONGIARE and TIRAMISU were a great end to our meal.

We received spectacular service from start to finish which made up for the minimal hiccups on the food. Dine outdoors for the awesome view and savor each and every bite! ALOHA!!!

3618033,2015-10-28,2,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"I visited recently with two amazing friends I have not seen in a year. This was definitely a special pre dinner meet for us. I have the say that the extravagant bill we had was mainly for the view -- which was, without a doubt, one of the Best on all of Las Vegas Strip. 

We started with a bottle of Chardonnay and muscles. Both were delicious but not to Die for. My girlfriends and I  were enamored with each other after such a long time, that everything was amazing. 

Next came the cold cuts and cheese. The presentation really lacked for me and the meats was a little warm but tasty. Lots of fatty bits. The pieces of cheese were embarrassing. I've had bigger chunks from a Whole Foods sample plate. There wasn't anything to Die for on that plate for me. 

Next came the mushroom ravioli. The serving had 3 or 4 small ravioli. I think it was 3. Again, it was very delicious but not to Die for. 

Then came a second bottle of wine and red wine risotto. The risotto was very good but that's all it was. Just risotto. We enjoyed it but it's not a dish I will crave. 

Our pre dinner apps and wine cost us over $200. That is absolutely insane to me. I've been living in Las Vegas for over a decade and I've gotten used to the Off The Strip quality, decadence and luxury of fine local dinning that sources responsibly and with quality experience in mind as well but at half of the cost. 

Corkage fee at Lago is $50. So sorry, I'm used to excellent service at places like Echo & Rig that offer free corkage at any time.

My stars are for the incredible decor, great service and a breathtaking view. The food did not win my palate. I enjoyed the company of my great friends and glad I got to experience this place, but for an experienced local Las Vegas foodie, we know where to find a killer meal/app teaser where the view won't matter a single bit.",-SWRw9-1ARVKLAWE0Sxw1Q,0,0,3,QmSIUK4uDSWVSR0puT3zhA

Service by Monique D: 3 
I could rate it an overall 4 stars but taking into account the type of restaurant this is and what I expected of it I shall give it 3 stars instead.
My pasta ai frutti di mare was delicious but the veal piccata just had too many capers for my taste. From that dish all I could taste was lemon and capers. 
Also take into account that the dishes do not come with any sides; those you need to order separately. 
For dessert I had their Gianduiotto and it was beautiful, refined and had a nice flavor/texture combination. But would I order it again? Probably not. 
As for the service I'd say it that although sufficiently efficient it was as impersonal as it can get. Monique D, at least three times, left me with half my question still being processed by my brain. That's unacceptable. She had two tables, both close, so I know it was not because she was 'on the weeds'. Was it because I'm young and look like I could also eat at Pizza Hut?
To top it off, when she dropped the bill, she had charged one of the items as if it had been dinner time and it was not. The difference was small of course but still a mistake. I did not tell her to fix it (she was not around much), nor did I tip her my usual 20%.

Oh, chef's name may invoke his Spanish heritage and one's thoughts go to dishes that would include chorizos, sangria, tapas or paella. But, think again...you're IN THE BELLAGIO!  So, in Lago, you'll find Chef Serrano's bold Italian cuisine for brunch or dinner service.  

We came here to experience the Sunday Brunch that was highly recommended by friends and the hotel's concierge.  Reservations are definitely recommended.  Upon approach, this bright space and colorful mosaic (of Milan) attracted us from the casino.  We also noted that a dessert display had been set up at the front of restaurant.  There is also a lobby or lounge to wait for the rest of your party to arrive as the hostesses won't seat your party unless everyone is present.

As we were guided to our table, past the bar and lounge area, we could see out of the huge glass window from which we clearly viewed a panorama of The Fountains of Bellagio.  During our brunch, we watched the fountains dance about to popular or classical music selections.  Our friendly server described the fixed Sunday 3-Course Brunch menu which included a basket of assorted Italian breakfast pastries AND a ""visit"" to the dessert display.  For a few dollars more, you can request unlimited Bloody Marys or Mimosas with your brunch which makes more sense than ordering by the glass.

We each selected our 1st and 2nd courses from the menu while munching on the pastries set at our table and sipped on our coffees or cocktails.  The third course was a trip to the luscious dessert bar which we did our best to save room in our stomachs for.  The nice thing about the 3-course brunch is that the portions are sensible and satisfying so you won't feel like you'll go into a food coma.  The authentic Italian flavors can range from bright to bold which are great for waking one up.

This was a sophisticated and enjoyable Sunday Brunch which we shared  with good friends over a stunning view of Lake Lago and the famous Bellagio Fountains.",HH7iiWvBqV-20lA7JlSRWQ,20,21,5,ERsQ5chxrlrZEduHT6erFw

Request was for seating close to fountain show due to the evening being our anniversary.  We even had the concierge check to be sure the request was in. There were many tables along the area close to the show so not sure why one could not be for us, considering that we were guests of the hotel for the week.  We were seated at the back of a huge room that was packed like a cafeteria with tables only inches apart. The noise level was so that we could hardly talk to each other....not a great setting for a special night.  We asked to be seated outside...no tables for us there....so we opted for a small table in a side room.  So, warning to folks who make requests...maybe if you are a Platinum member, but don't be too confident if not.  Service was good...almost too quick...only five minutes between orders....we were done and out within an hour including dessert.  Food was OK, but considering the prices, not exceptional.  Unless you are guaranteed a front row view of the fountain show, don't waste your money.

3750662,2016-08-02,1,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Pssstt, Julian, stick to tapas!

My wife and I love Picasso and we've eaten at Julian Serrano's about half a dozen times.  ""Go check out Julian Serrano's at the Aria,"" we tell people when they ask us where to eat.   We'll make sure to tell them to stay away from Lago from now on.

I've already gotten some rather brutal feedback on my review so I'm editing it to provide more information as to why we were so incredibly disappointed with our meal at Lago.   First and foremost, service was extremely spotty.   We were initially seated at a table, immediately told to move as there could be no table there as it was blocking the doors onto the balcony.   We were moved to a table nearby only to see that a new larger table of 6 was dressed exactly in the same spot some 15 minutes later.   Perhaps they didn't want to sacrifice such ""prime"" real estate on a 2-top, but we certainly felt slighted to say the least.   For the remainder of the meal, it was evident the servers were much more interested in lavishing attention on larger parties.   We asked twice for water refill while our glasses remained empty.   Sorry, but that just doesn't fly.

The food was simply not all that spectacular.   The octopus dish I had was rather chewy with a rather crude presentation, in my opinion.   The polenta might have been the highlight of the meal, but that's really not saying much.

In all fairness, it's perfectly evident that an extraordinary Spanish Chef can create incredible tapas but he may not so easily be able to create such exquisite Italian dishes.   If you want incredible French fare, go eat at a restaurant run by a French Chef.   Same goes for Spain, Italy, or Thailand.

Considering we dropped close to 5 bills on our meal here, we had much higher expectations.   Of course, many things can be excused.   Perhaps the sous-chef was ill that day.   Nevertheless, the lack of culinary depth combined with what we thought rather poor customer service made that we certainly won't be coming back.",jX52sZoojxyYV2viWNyO7A,14,3,2,a0krRT8la0DTCZcRy-oyaw
3754281,2018-02-02,11,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Lago. (4.25 stars).

""Lago: lake."" - Google

I'm not 100% certain, but if I had to guess, Lago was given it's name due to the fact that it is faces the infamous ""Fountains of Bellagio"".

Hmm... fountain, lake, potato, potatoe??

I have been to Lago at least 10 times throughout my years of staying at the Bellagio & have enjoyed dining here for a quick meal or a ""date night"" with the BF.

While Lago is a primarily an Italian restaurant, Chef Julian Serrano's creative twist on these iconic Italian dishes will surprise u.

Over the years, I have tried numerous dishes from Lago so instead of trying to squeeze every single dish into this review, I'll review my 2 favorites:

Lasagna. (4.5 stars).

I love lasagna!!

Since I was a kid, that was the one meal I asked for everyday! Garfield was my hero because he got to enjoy lasagna all the time!!

On a recent stay at the Bellagio, our friends joined us for Sunday Brunch at Lago.

The first thing I saw was Lasagna!!

Not having any clue as to what twist Chef Serrano would give this classic dish, I just blindly ordered & prayed for the best!

What I got was a stunning & colorful dish which didn't look terribly familiar to me.

When I found out there were poached eggs served with this lasagna I started to regret my decision... until I took a bite into the lasagna.

This is where ""looks can be deceiving"" is so apropos!!

This lasagna was one of the best I have had.

Why?! Because the spinach lasagna is light & cooked al dente with a savory meat sauce. The poached eggs at a richness & classiness to this dish that I didn't expect!!??

The outer crust creates a nice textural difference to help contrast the creamy & silky lasagna.

Wow, I was blown away by the simplicity but depth of flavors!! Extremely light but just as good as the original!!

There's very little cheese in this dish but I didn't even miss it!

The only thing I wish I could have had was some type of familiar protein (i.e. shrimp or sausage).

But I truly respect Chef Serrano's genius & can still say I LOVED this lasagna!!

I'll definitely order it again.

Antipasto Misto. (4 stars).

WARNING: NONE OF THE OLIVES ARE PITTED!!!

I absolutely adore olives & cured meats!!

Who cares that it may take 5-10 years off my life?! I rather live happy then miserable.

Having said that, this appetizer is spectacular... well with one exception.

The ""cracker"" that is served with this appetizer is EXTREMELY THIN. While that isn't a bad thing in & of itself, it barely holds the weight of a piece of cured meat, let alone the cheese or olives.

When I try to ""spread"" the cheese on the cracker it completely falls apart & then my poor olive rolls off my plate & onto the floor. I have lost many a poor olive to this tragic demise...

Very aggravating & heartbreaking for someone who ADORES the flavors of this dish!!!

Perhaps, my uneducated & simpleton self doesn't know how to construct this dish any better but it is still worth the aggravation to make a perfect bite for the BF & I to devour.

Note: this appetizer is very messy to construct. The bell peppers, oils, & cheese are very slippery & virtually impossible to put together with the fork given. I don't allow the BF to touch the dish, I construct everything. Aren't I just so sweet!? *Angelic smile*

---

I'm not a foodie. The true meaning of a foodie a person who is a gourmet or connoisseur!! I just love food (except fast food)!!

Lago is a wonderful place to come & enjoy a modern twist on Italian cuisine & to try some of their signature cocktails!!

Chef Serrano, a 2-time James Beard Award Winning Chef, is usually in the kitchen hard at work at either Lago or Picasso (where Chef Serrano is the Executive Chef) & I have had the pleasure of meeting Chef on a 2 occasions. A very humble & fun-loving chef!!

---

Service is always pleasant & if u get a chance, request a seat in the back of the restaurant.

Why?? The Fountains of Bellagio will greet u every hour on the hour!

I tried the Serrano Negroni. Interesting, a little sweet for my palate but the BF enjoyed my drink. LOL. I'll be back to try another cocktail on my next visit!

Sunday Brunch is available every Sunday from 1030-1430. WELL WORTH THE $38/pp price! U can also add a BOTTOMLESS MIMOSA, BLOODY MARY, OR BELLINI for $28/pp. 3 course meal includes appetizer, entree, & dessert.

Gracias Chef Serrano for a marvelous dining experience that has been ongoing since April 2015 (when Lago opened at the now defunct Circo).",Z67zFhSzaTDiIMKtVcuFFw,18,14,5,VxgMQwh28vPkBP4cjQenEQ

3759796,2017-05-07,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"We decided to eat at Lago before going to ""O"" (which is a great show).  It is a Julian Serrano restaurant. We made reservations well before coming here in order to get a table by the window to see the great Bellagio water shows.  

The interior is light and beautiful.  The waiters are in these blue uniforms that are kind of odd (the black uniforms that the bus people wear look better).  Our waiter was from Italy.  He was excellent, both with some recommendations and in service.  They also have an extensive wine list.  The sommelier helped us pick out a great Italian red.

When ordering, you have the choice to get smaller plates or a big plates.  I decided on four of the smaller plates (which was perfect for someone with a good appetite) while my friend opted for the bigger plate.

We started with the Caprese salad.  It was incredible.  It came with three slices of perfect tomatoes (two red, one orange), great mozzarella (that complemented the tomatoes to a T), and then a dollop of caviar.  It was magic in my mouth, definitely worth getting.

He brought out two of the small plates to start, short rib cannelloni and the Carciofi E Granchio (which is artichoke and crab).  Both were excellent.  The short rib is puled so that you can cut through it with a fork.  The pasta surrounded it was fresh and so good.  Then the tomato sauce and cheese was heavenly--great dish.  I also loved the artichoke dish.  The mix of vegetables with the crab and parmesan cheese was just right--and it matched well with the short rib pasta.

The brought out the main dish with the final two small plates.  I was brought the risotto di fruti di mare (seafood risotto) and a four ounce filet, while my date ordered the filleto (the eight ounce filet). The one negative point about the meal was that both steaks were overcooked.  We both ordered them medium rare.  Mine was a little overcooked, while my friends was cooked at medium.  They ended up comping the big steak, so we were pleased with that.  Even though mine was slight overcooked, it was still good with a great sear and nice flavoring.

Out of many great plates, the risotto might have been my favorite.  The rice was cooked perfectly and the way it was flavored by the seafood made it just heavenly.  I easily could have eaten a large portion of this--really tasty.

Although full, our waiter brought over a tablet that had photos of dessert--and we were compelled to order  I had Giandujotto while my friend had the creme brulee.  My dessert came with two cookies, one covered with hazelnut mousse and the other with a vanilla cream.    Both were very good.  The creme brulee was good also--they put it in a wide, thin bowl so that you had more of the carmelized, crusty top.

This was just a fantastic meal overall--but if I were to go again I would stick to the Italian dishes exclusively.",cGtyYLQStwUhgxhAd_eBvg,2,0,5,fbRQgC-mWWAvkDDC95TtVQ

We made reservations right at 11 a.m. but arrived a few minutes earlier and got seated without any issues. In fact, thanks to arriving early, we got priority seating close to the window and had the best view of the fountain show! The show began promptly at 11 a.m. with the National Anthem and was followed by another song. My husband and I opted for the three-course brunch with bottomless drinks - what a treat! I ordered the antipasto salad & my husband the truffle ravioli which was to die for. Honestly, you can't go wrong with truffle anything. Next up I ordered the Italian sausage burger with a fried egg on top and my husband the eggplant parmigiana eggs benedict, which was a tasty twist to the traditional way to serve it. My burger was delicious, and came with a salad, and I actually enjoyed that the burger wasn't such a huge & unmanageable serving. Last but not least, the dessert bar! They have strawberries, brownies and other goodies on skewers that you can dip into a chocolate fountain, or if you prefer, pick from an array of small cakes and tarts instead (or get one of each like I did).

Love that you can often see the Chef at his restaurants (Picasso and JS), always appreciate seeing that and think it's rare these days to have the actual Chef present! Go Chef!! 

In love love love with the octopus with risotto and basically all of the pasta dishes-yes, all!! I recommend going with a group so you can order everything!! I'm excited!! Portions are small and I feel are priced appropriately for the quality, taste, and presentation of the food, not to mention the gorgeous fountain view! Crab and Farro salad, so light, fresh and perfectly flavored. Being Asian I will call the crudo dishes sashimi :-)---salmon sashimi & scallop sashimi = Oyshi DOPE. Gnocchi with lobster knuckles, I mean... Wow. But my hands down fave that I will order over, and over, and over again was the squid ink pasta with lobster! Please see photo I posted. It was so wonderful!  Enjoyed the lamb and veal too, both so tender and magical to my taste buds! 

Finished this magical evening with a drink which I wish I could remember the name but it had a magical ball with magical juice and it literally exploded in your mouth... It's served in a martini glass with a scoop of sorbet that they pour prosecco over! Bravo!! 

Ok so I basically support Lago, a lot! Enjoy! :-)

P.s... Dear Bellagio-Lago-Chef, please open for lunch!!",F80__aVCvtswxqCcflp27Q,1,1,5,HCLLMfhdsq3z4qCMzVIzgw
3813543,2015-11-01,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"My family and I came here with a 10:00pm reservation but with Saturday night traffic in Vegas. We arrived around 10:10pm. The hostesses were very nice and accommodating. We wanted a table on the patio and was told it would be a 20min wait, which my party didn't mind since it was a Saturday night. The 20min was up and we were seated at the center of the Patio which had an amazing view especially since the fountain show was running every 15min. The ambiance was modern and elegant with one of the best views of the city.

Our Waiter Arturo was very friendly and knowledgeable and explained to us the concept of the restaurant setting, which was Italian food served tapas style. Every dish we had was delicious but some of the stellar dishes we had was the 7x7 and Frute de Mare Risotto which were consistent and balance throughout. Zucchini Pizza was light, crispy and delicious. 

Overall we had a great time! Service and Food was on point and the ambience created a lasting impression on us. Great place to bring a group or family with great views of the fountains of Bellagio and Vegas.",6pzA8EDhHgW3A5-rBObhBA,1,0,5,jUSA4LLnl-b2tToJKCYU2Q

3846630,2015-05-07,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"My family and I went this past Sunday (we were in town for the MayPac fight) and this was the highlight of our trip!!!  

I have been a big fan of JS for a long time and have gone to Picasso & JS in Aria every time I am in Las Vegas (about 4-5 times a year) and was very excited to hear that Lago was opening up in the old Circo space (that was a terrible restaurant).  

The restaurant is overlooking the famous fountains and if you had seen Circo before, you wouldn't recognize one thing about the space.  It was a complete gut renovation and looks awesome.  Very 50's Mod/Space age vibe with lots of gleaming white, chrome and marble.  Very cool concepts with the type of food they are serving.

We ordered a ton of food as we like to try everything the first time we go somewhere and there were some definite stand-outs.  Like JS Aria, the menu is small plates concept and they split the menu between breads (mini pizza, crostini, flat breads), crudo, veg, meat, pasta and seafood and then large share plates.

We started off with the crostini and focaccia breads and we could have ordered multiples of each.  The stand out this section was definitely the crostini with the olives and pecorino and the nduja focaccia.  The bread itself was perfectly cooked and salted.

For our 2nd course, we had the crudo of scallop and salmon.  Both were great, but the Scallop was really delicious.  Raw scallop isn't for everyone, but the texture and citrus flavors of this dish were really wonderful.

3rd course; Pasta & Risotto!!!  The highlights were definitely the red wine risotto and the 7&7 Gnocchi with lobster reduction.  Flavors, textures and ingredients were on point.

For our meat (protein) course, we had the Vongole clams, branzino and lamb chops.  The flavors were classic on all of these and not too innovative, but regardless the dishes were all exceptional especially the chops.  Usually when you get lamb chops as a small plate, they are tiny and very thin.  These were very thick and juicy with great moisture and flavor.

For dessert; we had the mini cannoli's were great and a perfect way to finish off the meal as they weren't overly sweet and had just enough ricotta and citrus zest to make them almost a palate cleanser.  

A few things that could change; they put their drinks and dessert on a iPad, which is really annoying and not necessary.  Its cumbersome and not worth the hassle to click thru images and pages when you could review a menu much more easily.  iPads have been around for while now, and its not very cool either way to have to swipe and touch a screen that many other hands have touched....talk about passing germs before you eat food with your hands.

The restaurant is loud and crowded.  High ceilings and vast space make it very loud, so don't expect a romantic date night.  Also, the seating is odd.  They mixed all different shape tables and seating, which make the restaurant extremely tight to maneuver (the hostess couldn't figure out how to get us to our table and we had to loop around) and you are sitting very close to every table around you.  

In reading some of the other reviews, a big complaint is the pricing and portions.  Not sure why people complain about pricing, when thats reviewable prior to going and as for the portions, even for ""small"" plate standards; there were really healthy portion sizes.  The waiter will recommend 3-4 plates per person and we ordered that and it was perfect and extremely filling.  Without ordering too much alcohol, you can definitely eat there for $50-$75 a person.

A lot of the food is very classic with flavors that people will recognize from their favorite Italian dishes, but most of the food is very innovative with amazing ingredients and flavors. I highly recommend Lago and can't wait to go back!",UjFMeqhGaY-lCevVKux2KQ,3,0,5,aGL5X52HerSWazX0Br17WQ

3863852,2017-04-23,5,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Well after eating at Jullian Serranos at The Aria, I wasn't completely shocked at the portion sizes here, but had I not known this, i probably would not of been happy.

We had resort credit we had to use up from M life, and Lago really was visually appealing, so we wanted to compare the two.

We arrived around 1120 pm. They close at Midnight, and our server Ariaena was pushing to get us to order. She wasnt the most friendly or informative, so of the two, service was better at JS Tapas.

We ordered a variety of dishes. Brusch Pomodora ( Brusetta ) was good, and at 8$ it was the least costly thing ordered.

We also had Salsiccia pizza which is a very small size. It was both very dry( crust ) and way too greasy 17$

Speaking of small, the Calamaro Rioieno was 4 teeny tiny bite size pieces. 

The ceaser salad was a small head of romaine cut into 4 and sprinkled with cheese and dressing.

The steak was small but very tasty. It was the best thing we had. 

We had a few other items, one drink each, and the total was close to 200$ 
I wasn't shocked since I expected it after eating at his other place, but unless it was comped again, I wouldn't return. 

On another note - this was the night that The Bellagio's Rolex store (in the main lobby) got robbed by a guy wearing a pig mask ( and others in a cat & a panda mask too ). 

When they used sledge hammers to smash out the glass , people thought it was gun shots...

It caused SO much panic and chaos as people ran and some hid under tables. There were reports of a live shooter and we assumed it was a shooting at the Nightclub. It wasn't until much later we discovered what was going on. 

Cops everywhere, we got locked down in the casino, outside gridlocked traffic and cops with machine guns. It was a crazy night. Had we not gone to dine here we would of missed it all !!",q-v8elVPvKz0KvK69QSj1Q,8,5,3,xD9bG9AcpPMmpA7iPH-C9w

3877273,2015-05-15,2,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Extraordinary. I wouldn't say Lago is vintage Vegas, but this is the direction where food in this city is heading. Unlike the buffets and steakhouses, portions are shrinking, focusing instead on taste, texture, and presentation. The popular outdoor patio seating has a front row view of the Bellagio fountains. Dining is now no longer just a gustatory and olfactory experience, but a visual one as well. 

While there are plenty of bread and meat options, the majority of the menu is seafood-heavy. The capasanta (scallop) was a light, clean, and refreshing dish to start off the meal. The pairing with blood orange was nice, and I loved the pistachios for textural contrast. One of the most popular dishes is the 7 x 7. Seven pieces of toasted gnocchi paired with seven pieces of lobster knuckles. Topped off with some tomato bisque, this dish was my favorite. For meats, the agnello scottadito (grilled lamb chops) was perfectly seared and didn't have that overwhelming gamey taste. The one dish I had an issue with was the pesce intero (baked boneless whole fish). This dish, meant to be shared for two, had quite a few sharp bones left. The sea bass itself was mediocre; however, I did enjoy the accompanying roasted vegetables. 

The service was fantastic. The cocktails were on point as well - strong, but enjoyable. Patio seating is first-come, first-serve, but worth the wait in my opinion. Acknowledging the need for a more casual dining experience than full-service fine dining, Julian Serrano creates something wonderful for the modern crowd.

I was hardly acknowledged by the host. Why? is it because I didn't have makeup on? Because I look underage? because I'm dining by myself? I gave them benefit of the doubt since bar seating is open seating. Fine. About 5 minutes later, another woman walked in, definitely more mature looking than I was. She was definitely greeted by the same host. That host walked her to the bar seat and actually pulled out the chair for her. I had to scramble to pull the chair far enough to climb up myself and be able to pull it in. Nice way to discriminate, Mr. host. Furthermore, I saw some guys who had printed t-shirts and still get treated better than me. And what's great about dining alone? I'm drafting the review as it happens. Any check ins from anyone? Nope. My water wasn't refilled, no one really checked on me for finishing although I'm sitting at the bar and there are 2 servers attending. Way to go, Lago!

I ordered the zuppa allo zenzero, a summer squash puree with spicy croutons. Not sure why I was expecting a cold soup, maybe I thought of summer and needing to stay cool. It's definitely a decent soup. It's dense in texture but not too heavy. If you're craving for a light lunch, that would be perfect.

Also ordered the fusilioro, since I was craving for pasta. I was not expecting my pasta to come out at the same time as my soup. Yes, thank you for warning me about hot plate and such. I doubt my pasta would still be dangerously hot by the time I'm done with my soup.  Yep, it cooled down a lot when I took my first bite. It was a bit cooler at the top, still warm in the center though. Yes, aside from the fantastic service, the food here is still worthy. That al dente texture to the point. It's not soft enough to fall apart like how my life is from the eyes of that host. Lamb ragu may be a bit too gamey for some folks, but those loving fragrant (very subjective) flavors, this is worthwhile even I had to deal with that rude attitude from earlier.

Lago is a newest restaurant by Michelin Starred Chef Julian Serrano; located in the Bellagio, which is a new rendition of a contemporary Italian themed Cuisine which just opened in April, 2015.

THE STAFF -

While our servers were not on their best behaviors, the food picked up their charm.
The tables are so close that the waiter's  butt kept jabbing me to assist the table next to me and he never said sorry, it almost felt like he wanted his butt in my face! 


THE FOOD -

Pasta fagioli e cozze -  this soup with muscles which my dining companions couldn't stop raving about. It was delightful and had a bit of clean yet rustic flavor without being overwhelming with salt.

I had their Cesar salad, and I rarely compliment salad dishes, but the seasoned sardines blew me away, it was really magnificent.  The texture of the vegetables and croutons was one of the, if not the best mixture I've experienced from a salad dish.

Risotto di fruti di mare - My second course was the Risotto, which was probably the best risotto dishes I've had in Las Vegas, with elegant and aromatic flavor and impeccable texture of the farro. I hadn't distinguished what trick the kitchen pulled off, but the king oyster and maitake mushroom tasted almost like a flawless grilled meat, with smoked macadamia and crispy leeks to support the mushrooms. 

Pesce fish - orata which was perfectly cooked but the reserved yet elegant flavor of curry broth added another dimension to this dish and the flavor was modest without being salty.

Our server was Carlos and we was absolutely top notch--the best!

The two of us shared all of then plates.  We started with the chicken liver and capers toasted bread.  Very good.  Next, we had the risotto with tripe and mushrooms.  This was better than the last time I had the dish when I was here for a Yelp event.  There was more spiciness to the dish.

Next we had the octopus with black squid ink cous cous.  Cooked perfectly and very tasty.  This was followed by our favorite of the night, the quail saltimbocca--boneless quail wrapped with prosciutto.  It was excellent.  Four nice sized pieces of quail with the prosciutto.  A perfect dish for sharing.

Then we had the branzino that was on top of capers, olive slices, and tomatoes.  The last tapas dish we shared was the 7 and 7, potato gnocchi with lobster knuckles.  The gnocchi and the lobster were very good.  Not yet quite full, we ordered the osso buco served on a bed of creamy cheese polenta.  The osso buco was flavorful and had a fair amount of meat.  The cheese flavor of the polenta was absent.

Not quite done, we ordered two desserts--one that my dining companion had heard was very good and one Carlos recommended.  My companion wanted the giandujotto, hazelnut ice cream with another piece of hazelnut cream encased in a chocolate coating.  Carlos recommended the panna cotta with mango sorbet and sliced fruit.  Both were good but the panna cotta was the best.  It was light and exactly the kind of dessert to have after the meal we had eaten.  It was light, flavorful, and citrusy.

Service throughout our two and a half hours there was the best you could want.  Carlos was extremely knowledgable about the dishes and when asked, he was pleased to recommend things.  Our water glasses never got below being half empty--yes, I'm a half empty kind of person--and Carlos brought a fresh glass of iced tea to me before I was finished with the current one.

It is located at the Bellagio, a beautiful hotel. The location is perfect. If you want to sit near a view of the Bellagio fountains ask, speak up. 
Please do not go dressed in shorts looking like you are on line at a cheap buffet. Dress for the occasion, wear a nice pair of pants and anything other than flip flops. This is an expensive place to eat, it is beautiful, the food is great, so treat it as such.
Everything on the menu is wonderful. Try a steak and a fish dish. They have a pizza oven and I am sure it is great, but I did not have pizza, so I don't know.
The service is wonderful, you are well taken care of and they make you feel special. If you are there for a special occasion let then know before you are seated. 
I would not take kids here. You can, but they are going to get bored, you will be there awhile. 
They have wonderful desert items. If you can afford it have a bottle of wine, but I don't think their list is the best and it is very pricey. I rather spend my money on the food, oh the food. But you do what you want. They have a full bar with great drinks.
You will be there for an hour or more. It is not that they are slow at all, the food is perfect and you simply are not rushed. If you are in a hurry, go elsewhere.

4014968,2015-05-19,21,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"OK, so to premise this off I'm not the greatest fan of tapas, or 'little plates' because well...I'm a big dude!  I love big portions!  So if you're gonna come to Lago on an empty stomach you will be sorely disappointed.  Just keep in mind most of the plates there are consistent with 2-3 bites!  It is highly suggested you dine family-style here with a good marker of at least two plates per person.  Olympic eaters beware!

Yep, I'm a Yelp Elite, and yep, I did come back with our gracious gift certificate that we obtained at a recent event held at Lago.  But, I would have probably visited without the comp anyway.  So call my review biased if you like, but I'm going strictly off of the food we ordered, and the service we received.

Because it was a Mother's Day weekend, and it was coincidentally also near my kid's 13th birthday (boy they grow up fast) I decided to make a reservation for a Sunday late afternoon dinner.  To my delight there was an opening for three, any later in the day and we probably would have been turned away.  Upon arriving at Lago, our hostess told me that the manager booked us for patio seating, right in front of the fountains of the Bellagio.  Beautiful!  We even had the 'Reserved' placard on our table - fancy, fancy.  Great start.

Our server was Christina, and wow was she super hospitable.  Of course she probably already knew we were coming, but I watched her interact with the surrounding tables and she was just as friendly and outgoing with them as she was with us.  For our entire dinner she was attentive and very patient with us, explaining every dish we asked her about.  Much thanks Christina!

After wishing the wifey Happy Mother's Day and the kid Happy Birthday, Christina helped us order some choice goodies:

*Margherita Pizzette - with tomato sauce, house mozzarella & basil
*Al Cipollotto e Speck Pizzette - buffalo ricotta, cipolline onion & speck (cured ham)
*7 & 7 - potato gnocchi, lobster knuckles, & salsa di crostacei
*Ravioli al Gamberi - shrimp/mascarpone stuffed ravioli & fresh tomato
*Filettino - 4 oz. Angus beef tenderloin & gorgonzola
*Osso Buco - red-wine braised veal shank & polenta al formaggio

With Lago, they aren't kidding with the 'little plates'!  Even my kid was like, ""Is this all our food?""  Spoken like a true champ.  But I told her to give it a try, sometimes food should taste very good but not make you overly full.  We all ended up liking everything!  Surprisingly, the ravioli ended up being the least favorite dish on our table (and my kid loves ravioli).  It tasted great but the stuffing on the inside was light.  

The pizzettes were tasty but I of course wish they were a big larger.  Wifey & kid liked the Margherita, I favored the one with speck.  That buffalo ricotta was creamy!  Faves for the kid was the 7 & 7 and the Filettino.  She loves her rare beef!  It was funny because the three of us had to share a 4 oz. portion.  Cutting that beef into small slices was just too much.  Luckily wifey let us partake in the beef while she paid attention to the Osso Buco.  That was the star of the night!  So unctuous, tender, beefy, delicious!  This was a main course, but I wish it came in a bigger dish!  I would have gotten two orders of this.  The polenta that accompanied this was divine, with all the cheese & butter mixed in, it was silky smooth.  Decadent.

You probably surmised by now that we finished every last bite!  So much so we didn't have any room for dessert, and we probably should have saved some because Lago had some pretty looking ones.  Next time!

Overall we had a wonderful experience at Lago.  Food was excellent, and our service was excellent as well.  We enjoyed out time dining there, never at any moment did we feel rushed or unattended.  Yes, I wish many of their dishes were more main course sized but if you keep an open mind you will have a good time here.  We did, and I would not hesitate coming again for a nice meal.  Much thanks to Julian Serrano and his staff for giving us a night to remember.

4017685,2015-05-09,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"4 1/2 stars!

We chose Lago for our 5 year anniversary.  We had requested the patio, but in a freaky twist it was 55 degrees and windy mid May in Vegas so the patio was closed.  We had a lovely table by the window instead.  We did pop out on the patio for one of the water shows.  It is so lovely to view the fountains and strip through the window but the show does lose a bit of it's luster without the music.  So, choose the patio if you can, it's truly spectacular.  

Inside is bustling.  The restaurant was busy and loud.  It is very modern and upbeat inside.  There is loads of cool décor, swanky light fixtures, bright colors and beautiful people.   It is definitely a different ambiance than other restaurants lakeside.  It is more casual if you want a nice meal without the full fine dining experience.  

The staff was on point from start to finish.  The hostesses were friendly and talkative.  Everyone wished us a happy anniversary.  Our service was nothing short of spectacular.  Plates were cleared immediately, but not without asking.  This is especially nice when you feel the urge to lick the bottom of all of them!  Water was constantly filled, clean plates and utensils were brought whenever needed, help with the menu was offered etc.  I was really impressed with our service.  We wanted for nothing, yet they were not invasive.  

We ordered the crab and farro salad, raw scallops with blood orange, salumi platter, eggplant caponata, meatballs, lobster gnocchi, and red wine risotto.  Everything was delicious.  Absolutely zero complaints on the food.  Many of the dishes were pleasantly surprising as the menu leaves most to the imagination.  For example, the eggplant caponata turned out to be a dish of chilled pickled vegetables with fresh herbs and raisins.  It was quite possible one of our favorite items but not at all what we expected.  I envisioned hot roasted eggplant.  The vegetables were cool and crisp and super flavorful.  The crab and faro salad was equally as flavorful, yet very light and refreshing.  It was coated in just the right amount of olive oil for a pleasant richness.  The raw scallops were like butter in your mouth but juxtaposed with limoncello and blood orange for a burst of citrus fun.  Again, we were impressed with everything we ordered and had zero complaints.  The meatballs were certainly the most heart dish.  Three large meatballs with scrumptious red sauce.  A good filler to balance out much of our lighter fare.  The sauce was yummy and I would have adored a piece of bread to sop the rest up.  

Hubby has a nice glass of red wine.  I ordered a virgin passion fruit mojito.  It was so nice to have exciting choices of beverage for a pregnant lady.  Many of their cocktails had specialty syrups and sodas so it was easy to have a fun drink without losing all the pizazz.  My mock mojito had passion fruit soda, vanilla bean syrup, lime and mint.  It was literally gorgeous topped with a pineapple cone dusted in gold fairy dust and filled with sweet ginger.   It was overly limey at first but my server gladly added some syrup and redelivered it in a snap!  

Alas, we were too full for dessert.  8 tapas for 2 was perfect and filled us right up.  

There were main courses available if a guest prefers to avoid tapas.  The prices were surprisingly not bad on those.  For example, $50 for a 1 lb. rib eye with potatoes and asparagus or $28 for roasted chicken.  

The strip is tricky because you are paying for location, location, location.  So, our lovely dinner cost us $200 for 2 with one glass of wine, and one mocktail.  The view was incredible, the food was delicious and the service was outstanding so I would recommend Lago to anyone for a very nice dinner.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,3,1,4,am5lbZs4wygqTSxFfyis2w

4038305,2017-05-21,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Came here on a Saturday evening with a reservation for 5:45 pm (which I made the same morning) I was eager to sit on the patio however keep in mind it is VERY difficult to reserve a patio seat unless you talk to right people in the casino management (or you can try your luck but may have to wait)  ounce I arrived to the hostess I gave her my reservation and she escorted us outside to the patio but not before recommending dining slots are 1:45 minutes on the patio I explained to her I intend to have quite a bit of food and drinks and knowing how hard it is to reserve the patio in the first place (and knowing I had second reservations at giadas at about 10pm and no where to go in between) I politely told her I'll take her recommendation into consideration but JUST as a recommendation the restaurant which is located in the Bellagio hotel is quite big and has a great view of the ""famous"" Bellagio fountains it has a beautiful decor which mostly consists of blue, white and silver accents it also has nice art work on the walls HOWEVER! Everything changes ounce on the patio this big 200+ seat restaurant transforms into this very small and intimate European feeling space with maybe 6 six tables your surrounded by water so close to the fountains you can feel the mist on your face and with the Eiffel Tower (across the street) and the rest of the Las Vegas strip as your back drop this patio is simply breathtaking..... taking all of this in while enjoying beautiful food and possibly too much of your favorite beverage this is by far the best way to watch and appreciate the Bellagio fountains 

As for the food between the two of us we ordered four dishes plus dessert we started with margherita pizzette which was definitely above average it was super thin and they make the mozzarella in house we also started with the burrata cheese which had a nice texture this dish was good but definitely not memorable after that we decided to try a pasta dish so we opted for the paccheri the red sauce in this dish was amazing however the over all dish again was good but not memorable after some more drinks we decided to get one more so we opted for the chicken livers it's served on crostini the dish had good flavor but was very spicy after few more drinks we decided that was enough savory so we decided to go with dessert we ordered the orange zest cannoli which was amazing the cannoli shell was really light and crisp next time I would start with this as a pre appetizer

Over all we were here five hours (I would have loved to stay longer but had to leave to make our second dinner reservations) I had to give it five stars due to the view and ambience the food it's self was good and better than a lot of Italian restaurants and maybe we ordered the wrong things but I did expect to be more wowed considering the chef is Juilian Serrano and keep in mind we did dine at two Italian restaurants this evening so I am comparing the two the other one being giadas (Which I will also write a review review) out of the two I believe Giadas has the better food (dessert excluded) however everything considered in my opinion Lago is BY FAR the superior restaurants because what it may lack in food compared to giadas it greatly makes up for in view and ambience (if on the patio) but again the food was good just not as good all in all it was an amazing experience",C-wpIHCi7XuN8FLH8Bjr5Q,0,0,5,NKO_UpBO840zox6EoxUxlw
4053686,2015-04-22,6,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"My husband and I dined here on April 20th to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary. I was lucky enough to get to attend the Gold Elite event held at Lago the previous week, so I knew I was in for a great meal in a beautiful setting. My expectations were met and then some. 

We arrived promptly for our 6 pm reservation and we were lead by the personable hostess to our reserved table on the patio, overlooking the famous Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower across the street at Paris. The manager came over to thank us for celebrating our anniversary with them, and then our server, Carlos, proceeded to explain the menu to us. 

Lago is Italian themed tapas, so many of the menu items are intended to be shared, and very few of the items could be considered a meal on their own. Carlos explained that items are brought out as soon as they are prepared, and recommended we start with a couple dishes and then order more as the night went on. 

Service was impeccable. While Carlos was our main server, we interacted with various other employees as food was brought out to us and dishes were removed from the table. Everyone was fantastic. 

My husband and I started out by sharing a few items and then decided to move on to 2 of the larger entrees. The insalata sarda was a wonderfully light dish to start off with, and I loved the way the brown sugar and balsamic brought out the flavor of the ricotta infornata. After sampling a couple more items we moved on to our entrees, my husband had the polletto and I had the filetto. My steak was such a deliciously tender cut of meat and gorgonzola with red wine reduction topping was to die for. 

We could not resists sharing a dessert after our entrees, we went with the panna cota which was a wonderful combination of vanilla and citrus. Our server Carlos said it was a favorite of his, and that was a wonderful recommendation on his part.

If it is a nice day, it is nice to sit on the Patio, but it's also nice to be casual and sit at the bar. No bad options here. 

For the food - I really like the tapas idea since I'm always one to share and try many dishes during a meal.

-Caprese, simple but flavorful
-Braised pulled duck meat with polenta - Like butter!

Upon entering the restaurant, although I made a patio request which is a request, not gauranteed, it wasn't ready. We waited at the bar for about 30-40 minutes until our table was ready.  The restaurant may be intimidating on the inside due to the noise level and people coming in and out, but on the patio it included a beautiful watershow with a great view.  To be quite honest, if we didn't get patio seating I would have left and found somewhere else to eat. I believe there's a confusion when I ask for ""fine dining"" and I'm told by the hostess that it's considered fine dining with the noise level.  For a special occasion I prefer quieter more romantic settings where this is more for social dinners.  None of the dishes were memorable but I do remember ordering beef and my SO made a comment after trying it first, ""Have you ever had a sausage mcmuffin from McDonalds?""

We ordered 6 small plates for 2 people and were stuffed by the end. Standouts for me were the 7&7 (gnocchi with lobster) and the brasato d'anatra (braised duck). For dessert, we mentioned my birthday and were brought a tasty and beautiful dessert for free. I also ordered an espresso, which the waiter went way out of his way to make for me - Lago's machine broke, so he went to an adjoining restaurant to make one and didn't charge us for it. On the way out, every single staff member we saw stopped to thank us for coming in. I'm sure this isn't the best restaurant in Las Vegas, but for our purposes it was the perfect mix that made for a fantastic night. Thank you!",fYmxh9XPEsj_VctHDlU61w,0,0,5,O9x6f0uiKtImg6b5UO_lZQ

A friend and I each ordered a appetizer and an entree. I ordered the yellow squash soup for $11 and the gnocchi for $17. The soup was enjoyable that is what the one star is for. The gnocchi was absolutely horrible. It consisted of 6 perfectly symmetrical pieces and bland flavor. I'm sure it came frozen I've never had gnocchi so bad. 
 My friend had the duck which came out looking like shredded beef and he said tasted like an Irish pot roast. He also had the chicken liver which we both thought may have been cat food instead.

I started the evening the right way, with a mojito. It had just the right balance of fresh and sweet. It also had a nice, fruity kick. 

The culinary journey continued with the summer squash soup. It was hearty, yet refreshing. 

Perhaps the top highlight of the night was the linguine pesto. The pesto was so rich, so green, so earthy (in a good way!), and so satisfying. The shaved almonds and grated parmesan added extra layers of flavor that completed the dish so perfectly.

And finally, I couldn't help but try the mortadella flourless chocolate cake. Whoa! Come through, shaved edible gold! And that was just the start of it, as there were so many layers for chocoholics to enjoy.

I must admit I wasn't blown away the first time I passed by Lago, as the exterior gives a bit of a ""cafeteria"" vibe. That all changed when I stepped inside.

No seasoning, no sauce- nothing- just a dry cup of noodles that cost about .50.

We were seated at an oversized table (two of us) in a really loud restaurant so we had to sit on the same side so we could hear each other. Unfortunately this seating wasn't conducive to a great view of the fountains which mah have been a nice distraction to the busy, disorganized circus environment in the restaurant.  Ok, it had only been open a week so I can kind of forgive the organizational kinks the I'm sure will be ironed out.

My husband and I ate here during the week on a recent trip to Vegas, making reservations about one day in advance for a late dinner.  The view of the Fountains during our meal was spectacular - I would recommend asking for a table up front towards the windows or on the patio for the best of the best.

The service was nice, but not as personalized or as steady as we expected.  Our server forgot to put in our appetizer and salad orders, and was slow to bring drinks from the bar, but overall he was polite and knew his way around the menu.

We had the Bruschetta as an appetizer, and it had a nice little kick to it from the garlic oil, then had the minestrone soup and the Ceasar salad as our next course.  The minestrone was extremely light but flavorful, and the Ceasar salad was crisp and nicely dressed - having those two dishes for lunch would definitely be a great idea!

We stuck to traditional favorites for our entrees, and the lasagna (not sure they have it every night), and the pappardelle did not disappoint.  Both were filling and you could really taste how fresh the pasta was.  I would recommend either one if you are going to have a multi-course meal, because even with all of that food, we still had room to try their gelato and maybe an extra martini or two. 

Overall, the beautiful atmosphere and view of the Fountains is probably enough to make us go back to Lago again (it truly is one of the most romantic restaurants we have been to in awhile in Vegas!), but it's the fact that the food is so fresh and so delicious that makes us want to recommend this restaurant to others as one of our new favorites in Vegas.

What a view, fabulous to have the Bellagio fountains on display. Nice decor, comfortable seating.

The food was tasty, but not more than elsewhere. We were disappointed by the appetizers: the only standout was the cheese plate that had unusual items. The heirloom tomatoes were not, and it was awkward to have 3 slices for 4 guests. The carpaccio was tasty, but can get that at a good deli. Funghi trifolati was perhaps the most original of the 4 appetizers. 

Did not appreciate the suggestion of 2-4 appetizers per person, before what is referred to as the main dishes. Also 2- 4 per person. really? There is Strip pricing and then ripoff.

For the main dishes, the Margherita pizette at 14 $ was overpriced. The short ribs were very very good: at least there were 4 pieces, about 1.5 inches square, for each guest. The branzino was fine, at three pieces. The ravioli al gamberi were fine. Wines by the glass are overpriced.

So overall, it was fair. It was very noisy but expected on a Saturday night. They have very large tables for groups and little acoustic dampening so....Service was attentive.",0rAVVW4n5t5nv2oE4yhjog,1,0,3,GemGf0aOT4zoLAObJwRhLw

But if you like to tapas/small plates style of eating or if you don't want to leave feeling like you might burst then go here. 

Lago puts you eye level with the water show so ask for a window seat. It can be a bit loud in the restaurant during peak times (acoustics, not blasting music or anything like that) but if the weather is not too hot you can ask for outdoor seating and it is much quieter outside. It's the best outdoor seating on the Strip, and there's not a lot of outdoor seating on the Strip! Book in advance if you want window seats or outdoor seating. (Another good thing about Lago is it has a bathroom IN the restaurant so you don't have to walk out of the restaurant and into the casino. Which might not sound important, but it sort of is. Also, it is a really nice and private bathroom! Though, they do use sage scented hand soap which is the bane of my existence....)

I like to dress up and you won't feel overdressed at Lago if you want to get dressy. But you don't have to. Casino's will seat people wearing just about anything, so smart casual is fine. 

I would get a reservation for any Strip restaurant. You can always cancel if you change your mind. 

I love the food here. There's a sister restaurant in Aria- Jullian Serrano Tapas- which is equally good but is interior to the casino so has no views.",fC4QgX-LpiuN-AFhpnZPJw,0,0,5,Mw6foSlOltvjoEbgOVW8RQ

4484748,2015-05-19,1,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"I think I'm in heaven!  Having been to a look-taste Yelp event before its official opening, I was eager to see what Lago was all about in its every-night persona.  This joint sure is jumpin'.

We were first seated at a table near the window; it had a great view, but also was next to a table full of conventioneers whose decibel levels were off the charts.  We were moved to a slightly quieter one in a more contained room, but happily, it still had a great view of the fountains - it overlooked the patio, which was off-limits due to a private party.  Kudos to the phenomenal management team, who really took care of us and saw to it that we would have a first-class experience.

And it was uphill from there.  Our server, Jennifer, was terrific in every way:  friendly, efficient, and more than happy to offer her opinions of the various small plates. Chatting with her throughout our meal added a homey touch to the experience.  Likewise, her assistants - Ali, from Iran and Oscar, from Mexico City - also added to the warmth.  A bonus:  I got to practice my Spanish with Oscar and my rusty Italian with the manager, and I felt like we were on a trip.  Well, we were, and it was fueled by the bottle of Prosecco we shared.

Some of the dishes we ordered were repeats, because we loved them last time:  the chilled tomato soup; the expertly cooked white and green asparagus; the red wine risotto that every reviewer raves about; the delectable short ribs canneloni.  But it wouldn't be any fun without trying some new plates.  I positively inhaled the 7 and 7 - seven gnocchi, which were hands down the best I've ever tasted, served with seven lobster knuckles.  Who knew lobsters had knuckles??  I rate this dish 14 YUMS.  Two delicious lamb chops were followed by a new taste for my husband: veal tonnato - thinly sliced room-temp veal with a light tuna sauce, enhanced with capers and pignoli.  This is a dish I used to order years ago at an ahead-of-its-time restaurant in upstate New York but haven't had since.  I loved it here, and the toasted pignoli were something I hadn't sampled on this before; they definitely added another level to it.

We don't usually order dessert, but knew we had to here.  Who could resist the crisp mini cannoli, ultra-crisp and with a tasty filling thinner than what I'm used to.  Thinner isn't a negative here.  And it won't apply after this Dionysian feast, either, when I get on the scale tomorrow!  Equally irresistible, and even better, was the Giandujotto, a hazelnut mousse atop a chocolate cake round that was moist and dense, with a tiny scoop of hazelnut ice cream on top of another chocolate round.

So what's not to like?  The noise.  This is not a place to have an intimate tête-a-tête, but rather a high-energy, fun place with a definite Vegas vibe.  And great food and service.  Can't wait to go back!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,6,4,5,X_3qE0eAiWUwyuLn0xApgg

-minimal and geometric decor. Very spacey/jetsons meets Vegas dining. Hostesses have a space dress and you half expect a hostess with green skin or a third boob to come flying out of the kitchen doors
-love that you don't feel like you are next to the casino and the large windows to see the bellagio fountains
- great menu variety and reasonable price points
- my favorite dishes: (1) octopus with squid ink cous cous. It will dye your mouth but the best octopus I've ever had. Had a lobster claw consistency (2) gnocchi in lobster sauce. Very light and flavorful (3) panna cotta. Just really light and refreshing (4) salumi platter.

The bad:
- the scallop crudo dish. This thing STUNK. And yes the flavor was not as fishy but the smell itself was so offensive that I could not forget about it the entire night
-steak. It was not my choice to order it. This was not a restaurant that had great land options. This was over cooked and had a strong char taste. 

All in all, I feel like the good was really good but it was just too hit or miss and inconsistent to give it more stars. I'll try again and choose dishes that I want next time.",FHbWz5kgIXBcDHdNfCLhNg,2,0,3,-EsXWV6P-fyLAJ08MOpJjg

4593231,2015-04-30,4,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"I'd been hearing all kinds of positive buzz about Lago, since it had only opened to the public a week or two before my arrival in Vegas.  I assumed that scoring a reservation would be damn near impossible -- especially since my visit coincided with Vegas Uncork'd -- and no seats appeared to be available on OpenTable.  However, the Bellagio concierge took pity and managed to save me a seat at the bar.  Score!

I was totally thrilled to get this reservation, because Lago is simply marvelous.  It's the latest concept from Julian Serrano, featuring Italian small plates.  Located right on Lake Bellagio (where Circo used to be), the space is bright and inviting, with lots of whites and cool blues and intricate glass tilework.  The fountain show wasn't running the night I dropped by, due to inclement weather, but that didn't seem to bother anyone.  The vibe inside was just electric.

After being seated, I was greeted by Will, who's probably the friendliest and most courteous bartender I've met on the Strip.  He wasted no time getting a cocktail in front of me.  I opted for the Sicilian ""gin and tonic"" with a crispy orange chip and blood orange spheres.  This cocktail was simply gorgeous, and packed a serious kick.  Lago definitely puts a lot of thought into its cocktail program.

Since the menu was done in the style of small plates, I decided to try an array of different items.  Five plates seemed right for a reasonably hungry person:

1.  Nduja crostini with spicy pork sausage and gorgonzola
2.  Capasanta -- scallop crudo with blood orange and pistachio
3.  Short rib cannelloni with parmesan fonduta and tomato
4.  Quagia saltimbocca -- boneless quail with prosciutto
5.  Ravioli al gamberi -- ravioli with shrimp, mascarpone, and tomato

Picking a favorite from these dishes is damn near impossible, since I adored them all for different reasons.  The nduja had a nice spice, which was a good contrast to the cool and fresh scallop crudo.  The canneloni was probably the most traditional item, but the flavor was amazing.  The quail was rich and decadent without being heavy.  The ravioli pretty much melted in my mouth.

Even after all this delicious food, I knew I couldn't leave without trying one of their mouthwatering desserts.  Will recommended the Giandujotto -- hazelnut ice cream with hazelnut/chocolate cream encased in a chocolate shell, all served with chocolate ribbons.  This dessert was stunning to look at and tasted fabulous as well.  Yeah, it's pretty much an Instagrammer's dream come true.

Something about Lago puts its guest in a great mood, because everyone sitting near me was more chatty and outgoing than usual, and wanted to know every detail about the food I was ordering.  Lago truly feels like a destination restaurant for Vegas food aficionados, and that's reason enough for me to return.",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,8,6,5,gEh61qty-R3gMD9MwM0IeQ

We made a last minute reservation on open table so we had a high top table near the kitchen.  Everything is white, bright and shiny.  Italian inspired furniture and decor, it is both modern and clean.  The restaurant itself is beautiful.  If you are able to secure seats near the lakeside, you will be amazed.

The food is tapas style.  One order is perfect for sharing for two.  Our dining for the night included:

Zuppa Di Pomodoro - a tomato bisque with mozzarella 

Nduja - a spicy sausage spread and gorgonzola on toasted bread

Salumi - platter of 3 different cured meats with thin crusted bread

Spaghetti Chitarra - olive oil based sales with tomatoes and clams
 
Risotto Al Vino Rossi - risotto made with red wine and burrata 

Paccheri Al Telefono - tube pasta in tomato sauce topped with mozzarella 

Alle Olive Verde - focaccia topped with roasted green olives and pecorino 

Langostino - broiled in shell with lemon oil 

Dessert

Lemon Curd Almalfi - with lemon Sorbetto 

Classics Tiramisu - with coffee gelato

Vanilla Bean Pannacotta - topped with grapefruit and mango Sorbetto

Don't expect a quiet leisurely dining experience here, as its lively and loud in this place.  The cost was very reasonable for strip and Bellagio dining.  Everything came out to about $175.

The restaurant itself is very modern looking and you cannot beat the view from behind the Bellagio fountains looking towards Paris-Las Vegas! My boyfriend and I picked Lago for our ""fancy"" dinner while out in Vegas and we were not disappointed. We ordered four of the entrees (really tapas) and every single one was gone within twenty minutes. The shrimp ravioli was by far my favorite of the four we had. We also ordered meatballs that were good, but nothing that you can't have somewhere else. The bread with the buffalo/Gorgonzola spread was delicious and I would definitely order it again. 
I really liked how they provide you an iPad to browse and order your drinks from. The pictures are fantastic to look at and its more fun than just wondering what that fancy cocktail is going to look like. I've attached pictures of our two drinks; pineapple mojito and raspberry purée Bellini. Obviously this being Vegas, it was pretty pricey so we stayed away from the wine list and only had those two drinks the entire evening.
Service here is absolutely spot on. Our waiter was awesome and I noticed the same around the entire restaurant. No wine or water glass was ever left empty and plates were cleared before you could even blink.
With our two drinks and four tapas meals, our bill came to $100 even (without tip). The only complaint I have is that it got REALLY loud as the evening went on. We left about 9 so I'm not sure if that was just people get amped up for the night or because the space isn't huge. Either way, it did not ruin the night at all.

4637188,2015-09-07,1,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"I want to start off saying I had the most lovely brunch today at Lago @ the Bellagio. I am a 32 year old female who dined with a friend just before we had to go to the airport. I have been living in Chicago for 10 years now--so I've eaten at some great places--and do not consider myself a foodie, but I like to enjoy a nice meal and finally have the means to treat myself (or Treat. YO. SELF.).

We made reservations for 11AM because we obviously wanted a fountain seat. We were the first people at the restaurant and were greeted by the entire staff + Julian Serrano as we walked in. And from that point forward we only had exceptional service. I have tons of severe food allergies (where I have an epi pen) and they were more than accommodating. 

THE FOOD
This review is for Brunch only. It's a pre fixe menu for $38/person. You get a fancy pastry basket, plus you get to pick 2 items from a list on the menu: I went for the duck and then the steak--I will say that some of the items are non traditional breakfast items and seem a bit on the heavy side for breakfast. But HELLO, I am also on vacation and why not?! Everything I ate was outstanding. I am not sure why people are complaining about this food.... can you cook this yourself, I would like to ask? Where are you eating that you are getting this type of food that is cheaper than $38/person? A side of bacon in Chicago is $5. So yea.... not sure why anyone would be complaining. We also got the $28 ""bottomless mimosas"" which also works for Bellini's and Bloody's. Most places do not let you cross order between drink types if they have a ""bottomless"" deal going on, so I was impressed I could order all three drink types (or more!) at the $28 price. Personally I think that was also a great deal, especially for Vegas, where I spent $19 on a cranberry vodka at The Encore Beach Club. And it was THE FANCIEST mimosa I have ever seen. It had a gold dusted raspberry on it! And it wasn't short on booze at all! 

THE VIEW
We got the middle seat on the patio aka the best view in the house. If anything, it was worth just going to see the fountain show with music playing in the background. What a great view! I also think the restaurant is beautifully decorated. SO FUN!

BOTTOM LINE
If I am ever in Vegas again, I would absolutely stop in for dinner. In 2015, I think in general, people's expectations for everything have gotten a little unrealistic that basically everything is a let down. I honestly have never seen or tasted a mimosa like the one I had today (there was gold on my raspberry!) in front of a beautiful fountain, on a sunny day, on a beautiful patio, with music playing in the background, eating steak, getting waited on.

You're in the front row to watch the Bellagio Fountains and have nice mirrored view of Paris, Planet Hollywood and The Cosmo, all while enjoying the new, classy environment that the designers have created.  I definitely recommend sitting outside, if seating is available.  I went for lunch and loved it.  Their signature cocktail looked TO-DIE-FOR!  The portions are fairly small, so I recommend ordering at least one side in addition to your main course.  Anything you order will likely taste great!

My group of 4 stopped by around 3pm and the main dining room wasn't open yet, so we sat by the bar area away from the windows. But since the patio was completely empty, we were still able to go out and take a few photos. Note to self: must make a reservation for their outdoor seating in the near future.

We all started with the Lago Cocktail - a pretty blue martini, a round ice cube with a flower frozen in the middle, and gold dust sprinkled on top. Forgot what alcohol was in it, but the bartender poured really heavy. 

For food, we shared the beef carpaccio and salmon crudo. One of my friends never tried raw beef or fish before, and she ended up loving the carpaccio. The salmon, however, was just okay. It only came with 4 tiny pieces and was a whooping $18. I'm all for expensive food that's worth it, but this was the one miss of the restaurant, so I have to dock off 1 star.

the server (forgot his name... cute chubby guy!) was very helpful making suggestions for us, and everything we got was oh-so-yummy - especially the seafood risotto and the bone in rib eye!

We ordered beers because wine by the glass is about $20. and being early we did not want to pay that much without knowing when the wines had been opened. I think that is not a concern in the evening.

I went here with a group of friends we made a reservation ahead of time and when we got there they said they cancelled our reservation because we were 10 mins late. Then we decided to just go somewhere else and all of a sudden they had a table ready for us so we just took the table instead of looking for a different restaurant. Their plates are way over priced for what you get it's an average of 16 dollars for a tapa. The first thing I ordered was butternut squash soup which is my favorite thing I was surprised they had it on the menu. The soup was so bland it didn't taste like much of anything I've had better butternut squash soup at chain restaurants to be honest. The next thing I ordered was a shrimp ravioli the shrimp on top of the ravioli were baby shrimp you would put on a salad they were also so over cooked they were chewy which is odd because my ravioli was actually slightly cold. My friend ordered a cheese board I was expecting it to be really nice but it was mediocre there were only three cheeses on the board there were no spreads or anything it was disappointing I've had way nicer cheeseboards that come with a lot more things on them for half the price of what she paid for the one at this restaurant. The service was quick I don't have anything I didn't like about that. It was nice how you could see the fountain going off while you eat your meal but if you just want to pay for atmosphere I recommend you just grab a drink here I don't recommend eating here it's really not worth it it is just a disappointment.,xRFPqnPbOrZAkoomXqRW-Q,2,0,2,Zq53x4rCmfmermUPfL7MXA

It does make it difficult to share amongst friends as you really do only get a mouthful of each dish so I would recommend just ordering a few dishes individually.

The positives:
Excellent very tasty food! My brother in law and his wife said their meal was very delicious. My husband had the grilled lamb chops and he said they were the best he's ever had: done perfectly and just melted in your mouth. I had the veal scallopini that was just amazing: it melted in your mouth with the best flavor! Our salads were excellent and fresh. My asparagus was nice and al dente. Our desserts were so fresh and delicious too! I had decaf coffee which didn't taste like decaf it was so good!
The negatives:
Very very loud. I should have checked yelp before booking! That is a complaint my brother in laws wife said she read on yelp. I avoid loud like the plague. We had to talk loud to communicate:(
Very modern decor: not my thing and not comfortable. 
Crowded tables. 

I suppose the small plates can be nice if you want to build your plate with what you prefer rather than what comes with the dinner. It was my first time and a little confusing as to how much I should order.  It worked out though.

There is a lady that comes by your table to take photos of you. That is so touristy and cheesy. Makes dinner awkward and not as intimate. I mean we're just at dinner, do we really need to be this cheesy?! 

Second,

The food is garbage. The Cesar salad was tasteless. The bruschetta was the only okay thing we had ordered. But again just okay.
I ordered Pacherri de Telefono, baked pasta. Ummm.. did it ever come out! It was the smallest dish I had ever seen. It was like an appetizer for maybe 2 people. 

My hubby ordered Pappardelle Al Sugo Bugiardo. It was a sauce. There was 1 strand of think pasta in it and the rest of it was roasted veggies in tomato sauce. We make better pasta at home. 

I also ordered a cucumber mint drink that tasted awful. I took maybe 2 sips and left it hanging. 

Then, the bill. We skipped dessert because I'm sure it wasn't going to blow our minds.

Wow is what I can say about this restaurant. I will say it looks a little out of place in Bellagio (replaced Circo) because the decor is super modern contemporary inside and out. Their main pattern design is a overview of the streets of Milan and it has nice open space.  They offer indoor and outdoor seating(patio maybe 10 tables so limited) inside has floor to ceiling windows and they have private dining room and chefs table. 

On to the food. FYI the following food has a formal Italian name to which I do not know them haha. 

We had a little of everything. To drink try the cucumber mist cocktail. Very nice and refreshing. 

The must try entrees fare the short rib, red wine risotto, lobster gnocchi, and ahi tuna crudo. All of which are pretty self explanatory but so delicious. I liked the sauces of their plate and said Mmmmmmmm to these selections. 

I also had a cured meat flatbread, quail wrapped prosciutto, branzino, a spicy sausage bruschetta and a warm pastry with honey and cheese topping. 

For dessert try the lemon bar for a fruity choice or the hazelnut chocolate dessert for the chocolate choice. (FYI- we ordered all desserts except the flourless cake as they ran out) 

Since it is new we tried almost everything. I throughly enjoyed this place. Again keep in mind that what I had may not be available to you.

The 7&7 is an absolute delight of a dish. The potato gnocchi might as well have came from an Italian grandmother's own kitchen. The lobster was some of the best I've had, and with them all being knuckles, extremely consistent bites. The Spaghetti di fruti di mare is also another perfect option. People are complaining about price and size, yet you are getting lobster, scallop, shrimp, and clams, along with solid pasta, in one dish?

1. There is food on the menu that is there because it has to be. When you have a party of 15 and have a bodybuilder who insists that he only eat chicken and vegetables. Or for the loyal husband whose seafood-loving wife picked the place, but he only eats steak and burgers. They probably only have small pizzas on the menu because they're an Italian place. Get steak at a steakhouse. Get pizza at a pizza joint. Get seafood and pasta at Lago. Its not hard

2. Of course the wine is more expensive than your local grocery store. Sure, almost all restaurants will be somewhat overpriced for a glass, but here you get a sommelier you can call over at any time to help pair a wine with a dish, and being tapas style, there are many pairings. 

3. If you want to sit by the window like I did for the fountain, you have two logical options. Reserve for 5pm, and you'll be seated by the window because obviously, you'll be the first to be seated. Or, wait, because there are people who have to finish eating for you to take their seat.

I felt bad for my wife who all day was excited to show me this place LAGO.  Now I am pissed mess my night  up.....really.  I get her to sit inside  at table near bar and not be sad since last vegas visit till we have baby.    To make things worse this waiteress is super fast like a machine says just so you know all is a la carte and super small portions.  So pay a lot for very little...then front  hostess says your gonna eat here now after trying  to patch up situation.  Terrible service, snobby, rushed and just plain unacceptable  treatment  no matter how nice to look on the outside.   We got up and left this place quick as possible.

4864087,2017-04-11,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Very disappointed and surprised this place gets such high ratings, unless we went on an all-time-low day.  I made the reservation over a month in advance for 7:30 pm on 3/14, specifically requested patio seating and as it was my 50th birthday, I noted it in my reservation.  My sister and I arrived and settled in our hotel faster than expected, so we called Lago to see if we could move our reservations up a couple of hours, which they said was possible.  When we arrived, there were only 2 tables seated inside.  We were told there was only a table inside available, but it still had a view of the fountains, so that was fine, although we saw open tables on the patio.  Everything went downhill from there.  Our server, although there were only 4-5 people inside, was disinterested, almost to the point of annoyed.  We weren't told the specials and when a new table was seated behind us and told the specials by another server, we eventually asked ours what the specials were.  He said there was only one, which was a plain pasta dish with shaved truffles for $55 and that we probably wouldn't be interested.  Pass.  We started by ordering a few dishes, a glass of wine and a mixed drink.  Where to start...  The wine was a seriously small pour, but okay, it's a ""high end"" restaurant and that happens.  The mixed drink was 3/4 crushed ice, but tasted okay, but 3/4 crushed ice, which doesn't leave a lot of room for the actual drink (3-4 large sips for $19).  The food was terrible - period.  One item was the duck.  The description was not accurate and it came out as an overpowering muddy/stroganoff'ish mess atop polenta.  This combination did not go well together, as they were both strong flavors, which do not compliment each other at all.  Since the plates are so small, after we took a spoonful each, there wasn't much left in the original dish.  My sister and I were commenting to each other about the disappointing experience and turned to see the server and manager glaring at us and rolling their eyes from across the room.   The server came back and asked if everything was alright.  I stated the duck was not good, and he was not happy.  He took the plate and again, we watched the rolling eyes from across the room.  Since the small amount of food we ordered wasn't good, we decided to just get a desert and end it.  Big mistake.  We ordered the crème brulee because I love all things crème brulee and have never passed one up, ever... until this time.  It came out as an almost solid clump of butter with still crystalized sugar, which sounds delicious, but it was not.  During our meal, another couple arrived and was seated next to us.  This was the only positive experience from all this.  They were a very sweet couple and asked if what we were eating was good because it ""didn't look right"".  They said they had eaten there on a few other occasions and this time was not the same.  When the server finally came back, we said the brulee wasn't right, and the couple seated next to us concurred.  He said, ""so you don't want it then?"", looked flustered and took it away.  Again, rolling eyes from across the room.  He came back after some time and said, ""the manager agreed to take the desert off your bill"", like it was a favor.  We had taken 2 bites, so it's not like we were eating everything and then wanting it for free.  No happy birthday... nothing but attitude.  When we were leaving, the manager just stared at us from the hostess podium, so I felt compelled to say what a terrible experience it was.  He actually looked annoyed, but did say sorry - definitely not convincing though.  Thanks for making my 50th birthday celebration dinner so awesome.  I had been looking forward to it for months.",uIphx0p-TnndNXX7i5EUVA,0,0,2,VHueui3Aqy-xfo4DuiJIpA

The location was super nice, and it felt as if I was transported to France. Also, the porch had heaters, which kept us warm. 

I ordered the octopus soup off of the lunch menu and it was pretty good! I liked the rich tomato based soup with chickpeas, and the octopus was super tender. The garlic bread crisps that came with the soup paired well, and the portion was just enough for a light lunch. My mom ordered the lobster spaghetti special and she liked it a lot, and my brother ordered a lamb ragu pasta. The pasta portions were honestly pretty big, despite the waitresses recommendation of each person ordering two items.

4916884,2015-08-12,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"We ate lunch at Lago on Saturday, and then returned for dinner on Monday -- so that says something.  Both experiences were much the same.  It is a joy to eat at Lago, with stunning views of the fountains, and a clean, open, modern decor which emphasises shapes and spaces.

If only the food were exceptional instead of competent (for the most part).

The basic concept at Lago is small plates, but they are really not so small, and two of them will satisfy the average appetite, with maybe a bit of room for one of their truly yummy desserts.  In fact, a Lago small plate is what restaurants used to call ""a meal"" before the ridiculous size expansion of the last ten years.  If you are not hungry, two per person may be too much.

All of the nine dishes we ordered were good, and we cleaned eight of our plates.  Only the pasta was left unfinished, and this because it gets very starchy when it cools.  But there is not one of them I can recommend as being exceptional but for the Bronzino, where the accompanying relish superbly compliments the fish.

Like all Bellagio restaurants, Lago is expensive, but not ridiculously so (except for wine), so you can probably afford it if you don't have a really bad day at the tables.

I loved the crisp, modern feel of the restaurant design and color scheme. I love the small plate concept for high end italian. We were able to try several great dishes as a group. 

I started with the tonno (ahi tuna with orange segments) and a caesar salad. Both were good, not amazing, but good. My friends had the Alla ricotta e miele (ricotta cheese with honey) per recommendation, and really like that quite a bit. 

We all got various homemade pastas for our entrees. Now these were fantastic. The highlight of the night though, was the pasta special which was a long thick noodle pasta with truffle oil, and then black shaved truffles over the top. It was LOADED with truffles, and the dish was out of this world! So was the price:-) but that was to be expected. I will go back just for this dish!

The restaurant decor is great too and I felt like I was having brunch at a high end Beverly Hills establishment. We could see the fountains and the strip from our table.

4926419,2015-11-21,4,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Unfortunately, Lago was just okay for me. The food is SO mediocre compared to many other Italian restaurants.  I think ""fine dining"" Italian is just so hard to do.  The ""small plates"" thing just didn't work for us. I felt that the food was grossly overpriced for what we were getting. I don't mind paying a lot for food, if the food is good and worth it, and in this case, I just really didn't think it was. 

We ordered the margherita pizza, which was a simple cheese pizza fit for a 5 year old.  We also ordered the 7&7 gnocchi with lobster, the mallorados, filet, bruschetta, and the ravioli al gamberi.  All were good, and nothing was exceptional.  My favorite was the mallorados, even though someone else at the table said it tasted like hamburger helper. :/

Another thing I didn't like was the interior of the restaurant. The decor seemed tacky and overdone.  The tables were literally 6 "" away from each other so it felt like you were eating at your neighbor's table. Very awkward for conversations.

I was here with a supplier so I couldn't take any photos but know that everything will be plated beautifully. We chose to let the waiter decide a menu for us and everything I had was at least ""good"" and many things were absolutely amazing. 

Personal favorites - pasta with lamb ragu, shirt rib filled ravioli (so, so good), a beautiful charcuterie plate and fresh burrata served with heirloom tomatoes. Expect hefty prices - most plates are $20ish and they recommend 3 per person. The wine list is both expensive and extensive with most glasses in the upper teens on the low end.

The Food:
- The chilled tomato soup was very nice.  Rich, smooth, and a little tangy.  The burrata took it up several notches.  Excellent
- The caprese salad was perfectly seasoned and the tomatoes were just the right amount of ripe
- The cheese platter had a nice mix of cheeses that were at just the right temperature.  Smooth, nutty, and strong
- My osso bucco was incredible.  So tender.  Large portion of bone marrow.  Mixed with a light red wine sauce and crushed polenta.  Oh my.  The best osso bucco I've ever had

The Service:
- We were a group of seven and the cutoff for the automatic 20% tip is 8, so I think our server was a little upset thinking we were going to short her on the tip (I didn't, even though I should have)
- She was relatively inattentive and had a few eye rolls.  Not sure why
- The maitre d' made up up for some of her inattention

We spied Lago as we were walking through the casino and made the decision to give it a go.  We didn't have reservations (not that we likely needed it on a Monday night around 9pm), but were able to be seated immediately.  Seats were also available at the bar and it offered full menu service, so we opted instead to sit at the bar.

We started off with cocktails while we looked over the menu.  I had the Rose and Rye ($16) made with Bulleit Rye, Carpano Antica, Aperol, lemon juice, rose petal syrup, and garnished with smoked maraschino cherries.  It was everything that I look for in a drink, boozy, bitter with a touch of sweetness.  Lago is a small plates restaurant specializing in Italian fare.  Being all too familiar with the small plates/tapas concept, we picked several items to share.  We had the Risotto alla Trippa E Funghi or tripe risotto with mushrooms ($17), Polpo E Fregola al Nero or grilled octopus over squid ink ""cous cous"" ($17), and Malloreddos ($14), a small Sardinian pasta that resembles gnocchetti with pork sausage and tomato sauce.  I can't say that I liked one dish over the others since they were all excellent, each in its own way.  I recommend them all!

We ordered two drinks, an appetizer, and a pizza. The entire experience was soured by being treated poorly by the wait staff right off the bat. We were ignored throughout the meal, and it took us 15 minutes to get our check. Once we had the check, it then took our bartender/waiter 25 minutes to process the payment because there was some sort of computer issue. Let me note that there was one other couple in the restaurant at the time. Right next to us, that other couple was getting copious amounts of attention/service the entire time.

The food was not bad, but nothing exceptional. It's expensive and tapas, so small portions.

3) Service: Impeccable, our service was quick and very respectful/helpful
4) Food: AMAZING, highly recommend the risotto and the polenta as well as their chocolate dessert. Food was very clean and light with robust flavors.",40IMoGChTJ3si2711EnVfw,0,2,5,hpWGIlWhx9jrjo1STifBhg

5094931,2015-12-01,11,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Julian Serrano does it again this time with a trendy Italian dining hotspot.  

Set in a stunning modern Italian dining space with views of the fountains of Bellagio, Lago delivers a great social dining experience centered around sharing plates and evoking conversation. 

Tip:  On menu small plate portions are sensible and designed for two to three.  Ask the servers as many items can be ordered individually to adjust for the number at the table.  Hold a menu and order in flights.  Dishes will always be served at the right temperature and there is no chance of overdoing it.  

In general, the food is simple, emphasizing a single element and supporting it with the addition of ingredients.  This is six sense dining with many dishes emphasizing umame.

SUCKLING PIG!  Order it when you first make your reservation or hope to get very lucky.  This off the menu item is a Serrano specialty.  Whole (about 8 pounds, half, or a quarter), golden brown, uber crisp skin surrounds sweet, fall off the bone tender, juicy, porky goodness.  Rosemary perfumes the air and tints every bite.  A singlular experience so good it can bring tears to your eyes.

The polpo e fregola al nero (tender grilled octopus legs with squid ink imbued Sardinian couscous and shaved botarga) is stunning.  Herbaceous basil, zesty lemon and peppery olive oil elevate the dish providing welcome brightness while the botarga, umame complexity.  The squid ink cous cous adds a creamy, oceanic finish to the dish that works exceptionally well when paired with the octopus.

7&7 (gnochi with lobster claw in a tomato based sauce reminiscent of a lobster bisque.  Gnochi is fluffy on the inside and pan seared crispness on the outside for great textural foil for the sweet, tender lobster knuckles.

Not to be missed, the quail Saltimbocca (boneless braised sage flavored quail wrapped in prosciutto served in its own jus).  Oh so tender, just the right of salinity, the prosciutto heightens the gaminess of the quail perfectly.  Screams autumn.

The risotto alla trippa e funghi (risotto of tripe, mushrooms, and mint).  A loose tomato based risotto hitting on all levels.  Mushrooms heighten the umame overtones when combined with the tripe's funkiness while the acidic tomato sauce provides balance.  Creamy, warm, and delicious

Finally, the vitello tonnato (chilled thinly sliced, par cooked veal loin with a tuna, caper dressing) is just good eats.  Keep thinking People Eating Tasty Animals and you're OK.  Mildly beefy, texture so soft almost like sweetbreads.  It's flavors becoming more pronounced thanks to the briny, salty capers.  Ahhhh.  

Service is outstanding however could do without the Italian fashion world attitude (Italian dining should be jovial, not standoffish).

Very impressive signature cocktail list.  Definitely try one before dinner.  Creative, sophisticated and yummy!  Very good, wine list.  Look to non typical regions for the best value and most intriguing selections (Aged German pinot noir, Spanish grand reserva Rijoa).  Vegas resort pricing.

Yet another home run.  Well worth the visit.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,18,16,5,O4u9sbQ3BeGKAiS_kyRW1A

We were served our salad, when our entree was served the wait team expected me to remove the empty plate. Pepper was not offered when we were served our salad and our wait team just never came by to check on us.
I ordered Osso Buco that was very fatty (see pic), a soup that was bland. I may have just gotten the inexperienced staff on a bad day.

5112263,2015-07-23,9,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Lago was supposed to be our one ""nice"" dinner before heading out to party the night away during our girls weekend in Vegas. 
The view of the fountains while you dine is unmatched. The food had some great flavors and came out quickly.... And that's about all I can say about what I liked.

The service was ok-ish. I didn't really think it was appropriate to have our server open up our paid bills at the end of the meal and check on his gratuities at the table as we sat there. 

As I said the food had some great flavors. Jackie B and I ordered 4 dishes to share. The branzino was done very very well. The funghi was also very good. I was excited for the seafood risotto but was left very underwhelmed. Not enough seafood/lobster to be called a seafood/lobster risotto. It also lacked that creaminess you expect in a risotto. So definitely not even close to being worth the price tag. We then ordered a Cesar salad at the end of our meal because after sharing 3 dishes we were still hungry. Quite possibly one of the worst tasting and unappealing salads i've had. The dressing was awful, the portion size literally looked as if the chef took apart a head of lettuce and found the 5 smallest leaves he could find and put them on the plate, and whole anchovies staring at me made my stomach turn. We immediately sent it back.
The rest of our group is also sorely disappointed not with the flavor of their meals but with size of their dishes especially since this was considered our ""splurge meal"". 

Unfortunately Lago is not a place to come to with an appetite or a place to come to when you expect to get a decent sized portion for the price of each dish. Sadly I won't return. With so many other amazing restaurants in Vegas, this is one you can skip.",KT18QwJ6lhC4fwDnIRt3aA,5,3,3,aqrvI3SGFbVYBpwMeoXnNQ

5134083,2018-05-17,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Well I was really looking forward to dining here. Always try to go to a new 'splurge' place each time I come to Vegas and I hadn't been to Lago yet. I'm glad I went so I can check it off my list. I won't be back. I have it 2 starts because it's a beautiful restaurant and has big picture windows that overlook the fountains. Good: they did honor our reservation and even took us a few minutes early. The appetizer we order of chicken liver on crustini (sp?) was delicious! Just ok: The food was ok. Not up to the standard of a named Chef, I thought. I ordered the risotto w Lobster, shrimp and scallops (also comes w clam, which I asked them to leave off and they did.) The risotto tasted like rice I thought and for $33, I wanted risotto, not rice. My friends meals were very small and did not come with any sides. Weren't even offered as a buying option. They do make them and they come with what they call 'The main entree' or 'The entrees' don't really recall. Which was fine but no choices I was interested in. No apparent option to order a veggie or potato to add to your meal. So after our $200ish meal, 3 ppl, 2 glasses of wine, my friend was going to have to find somewhere else to get some more food. My friends meals were good but not so good that we would come back for it again. Bad: our server, though very nice, barely came by the table. If I'm splurging on an expensive restaurant, which I don't mind doing while in Vegas, I want a server who knows their food is overpriced/expensive and appreciates that I'm there to spend my money at her place of business. We saw the water refill guy way more often. Also, I thought the wines were overpriced and my Cab was just ok. And ok  I get $20 for a glass but they offer a half bottle (2glasses) for $52. Um, really? If I wanted more then I'd have to buy a full bottle to make it worthwhile but I can't drink a full bottle of wine at one sitting and still eat my meal or walk out under my own steam.

I came here with all my ladies for my birthday. Since we're all at different phases in my life and I'm a social butterfly I figured a Sunday morning brunch would be suitable for us all to celebrate. Initially we were going to be seated on their beautiful balcony however it began to rain. We still had a killer view inside. I mean, justlcome here for the view. I decided on this spot for the view. The cherry on top was the water show front row seating we had every 15 minutes. We had a family style pastry basket brought to our table upon being seated. Everyone at the table raved about the various pastries they had. Now for the best part, the restaurant had customized the menus to read HAPPY 25th BIRTHDAY SHAHIRA!!! A menu at another table had the same header! How thoughtful is that and the hospitality is mind blowing. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE AT LAGO! 
We each were able to select our own course 1 & 2. I got the the Shredded Salmon Salad and the Filettino. Both were very delicious! The dessert bar was self serve and they had: a chocolate fountain with marshmallows, strawberries, brownies, Rice Krispies. They had tiramisu, Nutella Crepe, Panettone Pudding & Fruit Salad (my favorite; so fresh).  In addition, the service was great! They serve bottomless Sunday drinks for an additional $28.00 and they have a wide range of options from mimosas to bellinis to bloody Mary's with full range of juices.

No problem, I totally understand people not wanting to leave the patio. We got to enjoy some drinks from the menu. The drinks are very exotic and unique. The margarita for example uses volcanic salt from Hawaii . The mojito has passion fruit seeds and its delicious. My favorite was the LAGO cocktail. A vodka drink with a really cute flower inside an ice cube. The staff at the bar were friendly. They were very busy but always made sure my party and I had drinks. 
The ambiance at this restaurant is contemporary. My favorite place to seat was obviously the patio. We got to enjoy the Bellagio Fountain Shows every 15 minutes and we were almost in front of the Eiffel Tower replica, which made the view more amazing. 
The food concept was great, it was small tapas. I had the short ribs and Frutti di Mari risotto. The ribs were cold but Bryan, our server, was diligent and changed the ribs for warmer ones. He took them out of the bill which was nice. My seafood risotto was tasty and satisfying. In my table, my party got the lamb shanks with fingerling potatoes and they were amazing.

The food was so perfect, that's the best way I can describe it. Amazing ingredients and execution, so so delicious, light and clean tasting, and it literally made me feel like I was dining in the Mediterranean. Drinks were fantastic and perfectly balanced, and service was superb. And can't beat sitting by the Bellagio fountains. The fountains were being cleaned when we were there, but the water still had such a calming effect. Just beautiful. Can't wait to come back and I'm sad this wonderful lunch is over. It'll definitely be one I remember.

Wagyu carpaccio: so good. A little thicker cut than regular carpaccio, which is nice because the beef is so exceptional. Fresh, crisp, sharp arugula to bring out the flavors and literally the best Parmesan reggiano I have ever tasted. Topped with a drizzle of lemon sauce that perfected the whole thing.

Scallop crudo: the best scallop dish I've ever had. Ever. Delicate, fresh, perfect combination of flavors, and left a taste in my mouth that I didn't want to go away.

Rigatoni with lamb ragu: perfectly cooked pasta, delicious and not as heavy as you would expect a lamb ragu to be.

Branzino: skin could've been a LITTLE crisper but it was so so good anyway. Authentically Mediterranean.

Veal piccata: amazing. Just amazing. We literally were scraping the leftover sauce off the bottom of the plate at the end. Maybe the best veal piccata I've had too. Probably is.

Cannoli: SOOOOOOO GOOOD!!! I want more!!!

Amalfi dessert: also really yummy. The merengue was perfectly prepared and the flavored were lemony and amazing. Definitely recommend.

Early May, the same group decided on a road trip and we took a pit stop for the Bellagio fountains and to top off our lingering cravings of Pesce al cartoccio and the Pesce intero.

Each was delicious and beautifully plated. Although the wafer thin flatbread served with the antipasto was too delicate to be functional as a vehicle to transport the burrata and prosciutto to my mouth without casualty. The red sauce served with the lasagne may have been the most flavorful I've ever enjoyed. But....the service blemished what would have otherwise been a stellar experience.  Our server, Paul O seemed overwhelmed or at least distracted. We asked for water with lemon - water arrived - no lemon. Twice more visits to our table by Paul before lemon were provided. Later I had finished my iced tea and requested another - it never arrived. On another occasion Paul brought an I Pad to our table for wine selections - we were finished with our entrees and were awaiting coffee and desert. The pace of our meal included an inordinately long delay between our first and second course - the kitchen was not busy - so I suspect Paul failed to put in order to fire our entrees timely.

5279519,2015-04-19,10,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Sitting down with friends both new and old at newly opened Lago by Julian Serrano one could not help but comment on the space - the lounge up front lively and full of tightly dressed servers, the long bar well stocked with a bevy of spirits and ubiquitous televisions, and the breathtaking views of the Bellagio fountains gleaming in bright white - all a staunch departure from previous occupant, Circo, and although opinions varied from ""CVS"" to ""trendy and fun"" the service could not have been better, members of our table very well known to the chef and his team leading to an ""anything goes"" sort of experience where much fun was had, and plenty of plates were passed.

Part of the growing 'small-plates' trend, clearly targeting the Hyde crowd with a bumping soundtrack and see-and-be-seen settings, it was just after 6:00pm that our party of six found seating at a large circular table far from the bustle up front, and served family style with the chef making most decisions the meal began with well concocted cocktails and continued swiftly into plates of cheese, charcuterie, fociaccia, and crudo from which only the latter was particularly special - the scallops particularly buttery atop blood oranges with crunchy pistachios dialing up the textural contrast in a way that practically redefined the oft overcooked mollusk.  

Moving next to pastas, several bound to become signatures given the sharability and relative low price compared to meats, breads, and entrees, it was here that the Lago kitchen really flexed its muscles and as good as both the lobster knuckle gnocchi and flatter version soaked in cheesy fondue were it was the risotto that undoubtedly stole the show, the red wine tinged version stretchy and smooth with burrata while the spiced up iteration with mint was the most memorable plate of the evening, small bits of tripe soft and seamlessly blended with rice that was good enough that we immediately requested a second bowl.

Impressed by tender octopus with large cous-cous soaked in black ink while wishing that the crostini with spicy Calabrian pork as well as the pizza were perhaps twice the size considering the price, it was here that the menu unfortunately found a few weaknesses, for as good as the previous pastas had been neither the Malloreddos or the Canneloni were particularly memorable, the former's pasta dramatically undercooked while the sauce of each was no better than stuff from a jar or Chef Boyardee.

Moving to heavier proteins, though not particularly a fan of veal it should be noted that the Viteello Tonnato stood heads and shoulders above the piccata, particularly as a light option for those heading to the club next door, and although both the meatballs and shortribs were 'good,' neither were nearly on par with versions available both on and off strip, though both will surely please palates of the less adventurous sort.

Personally impressed by the quail, while others found the pork-wrapped bird to be far too greasy, it was with two large plates that savories would conclude and although the osso buco is a good rendition the dollar-per-ounce ratio was far tilted to the left compared to better versions at Portofino and Allegro while the $55 Garganelli's pasta and tomatoes were textbook, though the lobster was overcooked and flavorless - a damned shame considering the quality of the one served over the gnocchi noted above.

Taking coffee, a strong double espresso over ice that could have just as easily been replaced by the tiramisu cocktail I'd ordered to kick things off, along with desserts it was with an unfortunate whimper that Lago closed out the evening, for as 'cute' as each of the five plates was not a single bite save for the Limoncello spiked Amalfi was better than something found at Bellagio Buffet, let alone nearby Jean-Phillipe, the $10 each tab harkening memories of Bazaar by Jose Andres for least inspired and overpriced pastries available in a city where no lack of exquisite desserts exist.

Expectedly precious and pricey, though no bill was presented to our table, Lago has a long way to go before becoming a 'go to' for people serious about their food and although I'm sure early reviews will be gushing given the nature of Las Vegas food media (and the fact that Serrano smartly launched the place with a Yelp event giving food, and $125 gift cards away to 'gold' elites) the truth is that better Italian food can be found in almost any US City at half the cost, or in nearly any local casino without all the bright lights and Avicii overhead.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,5,3,V7Et66-kdeethyiWYoc9TA

We asked if we could sit in the patio , they said your seat will have some view..... then as we sat in the patio we were given a time limit rudely of 1 hour and 45 min?? 

Then the weighter came who was very nice and accommodating . Out of curiosity I asked people sitting on the next table if they had the same time limit. Response was yes , they also said they have been there twice and have received the same rude attitude. 

Then I'm like whatever hopefully food is great and it's all worth it .NOPE , I tried 4 dishes and food was very bland . I Thought something was wrong with my taste buds , but everyone on the table agreed . 

For a restaurant of this caliber honestly could've had better food and better service at some cheap burger joint .

5314990,2018-01-16,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"4.5 stars! Lago has elegant contemporary decor with gorgeous views of the Bellagio fountains. If you want a table right by the window or in the first row of the patio by the fountains, you need to have a small party of 2 or 3 as only small tables are in these areas. 

We sat in the patio which was nicely heated so you don't have to worry about being cold. We enjoyed watching the fountain performance with our tasty dinner. 

Here are the dishes we devoured:

CAPRESE: Must get if you like soft cheese. Simple dish showcases the freshness of the cheese and the tomatoes. 

MARGHERITA: Personal sized pizza with thin crust was a favorite. 

ALLA RICOTTA E MIELE: Cheese with honey toast is good for desert too. I don't fancy goat/sheep cheese, and I think this is was one of those but the rest of our group enjoyed it. 

CAPASANTA: scallops were yummy!

RISOTTO AI FUNGHI E PARMIGIANO: mushroom risotto was my favorite dish of the night. Highly recommended!

7 & 7: lobster and gnocchi were OK; I think the gnocchi have some type of cheese that I didn't care for, but other people didn't mind. The lobster seemed a tad overcooked. 

SPAGHETTI DI FRUTI DI MARE: a big hard to eat since the spaghetti is thicker, but we loved this dish. 

POLPO E FREGOLA AL NERO: grilled octopus is a highlight too. 

BRASATO D'ANATRA: Braised shredded duck with creamy polenta is a nice rich dish. 

Branzino sea bass: Must get! The fish is perfectly cooked with the skin crispy and the fish moist. 

Dessert selection may change, but the tiramisu is excellent. The creme brûlée has a good caramelized crust, but I didn't like the custard. It seems to have a lemon or orange taste while I usually opt for a vanilla bean flavor. 

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the memorable dining experience with friendly service, delicious food, and stellar fountain views. Highly recommended! It is also kids friendly with high chairs available unlike other fancier restaurants in Bellagio such as Picasso and Prime that only allows children above 5 years old. The food service is also fast so it's a good choice if you have a show to catch too.",28GvL338IP1NZHmQMrK6gg,1,0,4,_q7-iYkeirVJyoKKHpHOcQ

Maybe four stars, but the price, $380, was a little much for hit and miss on the plates.

The good: beautiful restaurant; beautiful view, delicious food. Brunch on Sunday was great! You choose a first and second course. A pastry basket comes to your table before that and dessert via a beautiful dessert buffet is open to you after the second course. 
Bottomless mimosas or bellinis or bloody Mary's available. I tried the Bellini with peach and then with mango purée. The mango won! The bellinis are outstanding here!  My first course was the antipasto: really good. Everyone's appetizer looked amazing. For the second course, I ordered the chicken florentine... Wow! Delicious is an understatement. All entrees were delicious! 
The dessert buffet is out of control!!! Everything from a chocolate fountain to fresh fruit to crepes to beautiful and divine cakes and pastries! 

The not bad but not great: 
- it took a while for us to get our bills and be able to pay. 
-the restaurant was so crowded with tables and moving your seat was a limited ability. Maybe it was because it was Easter? 
-pricey. If getting brunch with bottomless drink option, it is about $100.00 per person. Without it, about $70.00 per person. 
- they initially did not want to seat us until our whole party was here. They were very nice about it. Some people were late. We were just waiting outside of the restaurant. One of our friends actually went up and talked to them and they finally sat us down even though we were waiting for one more person. I can see why they may want to do that, yet it is Sunday brunch and all you want to do is sit back and relax.

Overall, enjoyed it and would go back! Everyone was nice.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,0,1,4,NTRjqMApg8E-rET9Fr7yig
5402023,2017-10-07,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,Epic Fail! My husband made reservations for our anniversary to have dinner here. We agreed to wait for a table with a view of the lake. Our hostess seated me while my husband cashed out at the bar. She told me we had a time limit on the table that is strictly enforced and expected me to agree to it before I sat down which I did not and deferred to my husband. He really had his heart set on trying Julian Serrano's food. The hostess told him that we had a finite amount of time at the table and walked away. Neither of us were pleased at the idea of spending hundreds of dollars for dinner and being rushed              through it. We then sat at the table for at least ten minutes without any server acknowledging that we were even there. During this time my husband went to Open Table a booked a reservation across the street at Giada's which has small plates and entrees of delicious Italian food. We had eaten there a few nights before and were blown away by how great the food and service was. On our way out we made a point of telling the manager what had happened at Lago and he said that they don't strictly enforce time limits on tables. What kind of fine dining establishment puts time limits on their tables???

Of course, I came here with my significant other for his birthday. I made the reservation on Open Table just a couple weeks before, and luckily, I was able to get a 6:30pm reservation. At first, I was a little bummed cause I wanted a later dinner, but this was actually the perfect time to go! We got seated by the window and got to see the fountain show both in the daytime and nighttime! The music was difficult to hear inside the restaurant though. I wish they turned it up a little, at least during the show, since the music really enhances experience. But I've seen the fountain show plenty of times before, and this was the best view I've had!
Anyway, onto the food. They have plenty of dishes to choose from, and it's a small plates style, so you can try out several different dishes without filling your stomach too quickly. We ordered 9 different plates - some were average, others were good, and others were absolutely yummy. My favorite plates were the 7&7 and calamaro ripieno!

5424428,2015-05-31,4,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Tip #1: Don't come here hungry.
Tip #2: Only come hungry if you are willing to order every dish on the menu and spend lots of money.  (That is the only way I can see one satisfying their appetite here.)

I knew coming in that the dishes were small plates made for sharing, but I didn't realize all you could get out of one dish was basically a taste of it.  Dishes ordered:

- Caesar salad: 2 leaves apiece for my sister and me

- Margherita pizza: 2 very small slices apiece

- Ravioli al Gamberi: 2 (or 4?) bite-size pasta shells apiece

- Dessert: 2 tiny bites apiece

The food was very bland in my opinion.  My taste buds enjoy themselves at Olive Garden more than they did here :p  You can get better everything anywhere else and for so much cheaper too.  The reason why you come here though is for the view: floor-to-ceiling windows for a great view of the fountain show right outside.  

We unfortunately were not able to get a seat out on the patio.  The patio is first-come, first-served, and there was a big party that got there right before us and occupied most of the outdoor seating area until almost closing.  We were at least sat at a table right by the window.   

Service was great.  The hostess was meh but all the guys who served us were excellent!  The stars I'm giving are for those guys, as well as for the view of the fountain show.

P.S. For cocktails I recommend the Cucumber Mist.  My sister ordered it and let me try it - it was light and refreshing.  I ordered the Rossa Bellini mainly for the golden caramel nest.  It packed a punch and was Instagram-worthy haha.  I preferred the Cucumber Mist, though.",KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg,8,2,3,ubrdrkCeQenDxBbSl7tmCg

It's located right behind the Fountains of Bellagio and it has a gigantic glass wall so you can see the water show while dining. It gets especially beautiful at night when all the lights of the Strip reflect on the lake and the water glistens and you can see Paris and Planet Hollywood in the background. The interior decor is very modern and clean, chairs are comfortable, and it has a vibe that, to me, is different from other Strip restaurants.

I haven't tried all their dishes (most are small plates that are shareable with 2 people), but the ones I have tried so far are the pork ribs, mushroom risotto, shrimp-stuffed squid, and sea bass (catch of the day). All were small plated except for the sea bass. The pork ribs are fantastic when eaten hot, same for the risotto. The squid was cooked perfectly but the  flavors were just okay compared to the pork and risotto. The sea bass was a bit bland, and the garnish (something along the lines of a ratatouille) didn't seem to mesh well with the flavors of the fish. But that's just my personal opinion, and none of the food was actually bad.

We had the Caprese salad and minestrone soup to start. The Caprese had delicious ripe tomatoes and was perfectly seasoned. The soup was light and full of yummy vegetables like potato and squash.

Our waiter forgot to bring the pastry basket, we had to ask, while other guests next to us that we're seated after us had another waiter, and ordered and had food, plus pastry basket long before we did.  We had to ask for several things as the meal comtinued as the waiter was either over extended in the service area or was just having a bad day.  I would recommend dinner for sure at Lago.

I don't even know where to start.  They were even very nice about making special items for one person who has to be gluten free.  We had about 12 people and they did make us all wait until everyone was there before they would seat us.  I hate when restaurants do that.  But luckily we did not wait too long.

After a glass of wine, tax and tip you may find yourself pushing that $60 marker per person. I will start with the good... the fountain view. Also, the food has some good flavors I especially enjoyed the (small) fungi and the branzino (fish).

Things I didn't care for were the lobster/seafood risotto which had 1 small piece of lobster in it. They should call it the shrimp risotto. And the $12 caesar salad which was 5-6 small pieces of romaine with dressing, cheese and anchovies dumped on top. We sent it back. Also don't order the pizzas, they are 4"" (literally, I'm not exaggerating). I have been to my share of 5-star restaurants including Pizza Mozza in Hollywood, where they make their pizza bigger than that.

Service was average, nothing to ride home about for the prices. It is supposed to be family-style but I was never offered a fresh plate or utensils. Most of my group was disappointed and it didn't make me look great since I was the one who found Lago on yelp. I know Vegas is expensive but I also expect to get quality when I pay for it.

  Lago is the latest project of Michelin Starred Chef Julian Serrano, he's been one of the original celebrity chefs to see the vision of Las Vegas; believe in it enough to move from San Francisco to Las Vegas to open Picasso at Bellagio; nearly 20 years later, just opened up LAGO in April 2015. 

   In 1998, Serrano brought his memorable Mediterranean-French cooking to Bellagio in Las Vegas as executive chef of Picasso. The Michelin two-star restaurant has been a 14-time recipient of the AAA Five Diamond Award from 2002 to 2014 and has received the coveted Grand Award from Wine Spectator magazine for its extensive wine list. 

   Chef Serrano then turned his unerring eye to the cuisine of his native Spain as executive chef of his eponymous restaurant, Julian Serrano, at ARIA Resort & Casino, which opened in 2009.  Featured on the restaurant's multiple à la carte menus is an ensemble of Serrano's signature creations including traditional and innovative renditions of tapas, paellas, seafood and more.  In 2010, Esquire magazine named Julian Serrano one of the Best New Restaurants of the year.  The restaurant also received the Best of Award of Excellence from Wine Spectator magazine in 2011.

    In April 2015, Chef Serrano opened LAGO at Bellagio in 2015. Lago by Julian Serrano will be the chef's first Italian restaurant and explored a new take on social dining. The restaurant's small plate menu will celebrate Chef Serrano's creativity and signature flavors.  Lago serves contemporary, Milan-inspired Italian small plates. I got to try plenty of dishes the last 2 months here and all were on point. 

    Lago boasted spectacular views of the resort's iconic fountains on the Las Vegas Strip. If you can RSVP an outdoor table in the evening, you would enjoy it tremendously. 

   Service is excellent here as always. If you don't have time for dinner, Lago is a perfect spot for a cocktails before dinner or show. sit at the beautiful long bar and lounge, I enjoy bartenders Emer and Christopher, they are both fantastic.  The cocktails list is amazing, you MUST TRY at least 1! 

- POLPA DI GRANCHIO E FARRO, fresh crabmeat, organic farro grain, confetti 

- FEGATINI DI POLLO, chicken liver, capers, pepperoncino

- FUSILLIORO, corkscrew pasta: Abruzzo, lamb ragù, spuma di ricotta, love it.

- BRODETTO DI VONGOLE, clams, spicy white wine, love it.

- AGNELLO SCOTTADITO, grilled lamb chops, garlic, rosemary, perfection.

- POLPETTE DI CARNE, tomato braised beef meatballs, so good.

We made last minute reservations for a Monday night after eating at Julian Serrano's Tapas restaurant the night before (which was amazing!), but when we arrived, the place was mostly empty. The hostess took a few minutes to seat us, and once she did, a server didn't show up for at least 5-7 minutes. Once someone came to take our drink order, someone else came by two minutes later to take our drink order again...which was very confusing and a bit frustrating. Many employees were standing around, and the organization of the place seemed a bit off. 

The food is of course tapas style, which we thought was very fun for Italian food, since I'm always indecisive about main courses.

We split:
- caprese: great tomatoes
- cesare: super solid
- malloreddos: our least favorite dish; it kind of felt like hamburger helper...
- gnocchi alla romana: yummy, yummy, & yummy; get this one!
- branzino livornese: good, not great

For dessert, we split the tiramisu, which was amazing, and the lemon tart, which was pretty good. We did feel a bit rushed with our check, as it was brought with our dessert...not a very respectful practice in such a nice restaurant...

A Spanish Chef opening an Italian tapas restaurant. That doesn't make sense, you say? Well you're wrong! 

Lago by Julian Serrano has replaced the space previously occupied by Circo. Everything is meant to be shared, and they recommend 3-4 plates per person. I was lucky enough to attend the soft opening, and it definitely didn't disappoint. 

First, the atmosphere. It's bright, hip and lively. There is an open kitchen so you can watch the magic happen. There is also window seating, facing the Fountains, and a small patio. 

I can't say enough about the food. Everything was really delicious and well prepared. I am still in awe over the branzino and also the grilled octopus (squid? Don't recall) served with black squid ink, risotto style. The smoky grill flavor on both of these items was out of this world! 

Another favorite was the scallops crudo with blood orange. And the filet with Gorgonzola jus. And don't miss the risotto rosa with burrata! Seriously, everything was phenomenal! 

The wine, cocktails and beers were on an iPad. I didn't explore this list as much as I should (I didn't even look at the beer!). They don't have an extensive list of house cocktails, but what they do offer was good. The Cucumber Mist and Lago Cocktail were both hits. 

Prices are to be expected for the Strip, but the portions are well sized for tapas and I think it's worth the cost.

I was surprised to be get an easy reservation. Read on to find out why....

As with most Vegas establishments, none of the staff seemed very interested in being there. No genuine smiles. The hostess could care less. Our waiter was rude. We asked him for a pic and he turned us down at the time and promised to do it before we left. He never offered and we had to remind him when the check came. But by that time, it was dark and the restaurant was crowded so we didn't get a good picture. Sad since we were in town to celebrate a big milestone birthday, which our waiter was aware of.

As for the food, only 3 out of the 5 dishes were good. Don't bother with the oysters (from Washington State; really muddy and tasteless) or seafood. Stick with the pasta dishes. Veal gnocchi was delicious. They also brought our drinks to us late...after we were done with our second dish. Someone else also mentioned that they pushed the food on them pretty fast.

I was there for a conference and my mother was my lovely dinner date for the night. I made reservations that requested a table on the patio with unobstructed views of the fountains (they have space heaters, so you won't be cold outside), but there are only two tables like that and we'd have to wait a while. Honestly, we came for the ambiance not the food knowing that we could get better Italian somewhere else. So, I guess the slight disappointment on my face showed because a gentleman at the front desk took the minute to study the screen and ask the server to put us at table #x. He said it's even better because we won't be cold and it's a direct middle view. We were not disappointed. I've posted a photo of it. Just wonderful. 

The service in the dining room was somewhat lacking. Our waiter kept kicking my bag that was on the floor close to my chair multiple times without saying sorry or offering to move it. He also came back every two seconds to ask what we wanted even though we had just sat down. 

Ah, the food. No bread basket. What?! At an Italian restaurant? We were told that everything on the menu was tapas style meaning for two people we should order at least 4 dishes. Okay. But, the Spaghetti di fruti di mare that consists of two small bites for my 105 lb mother is $38?  Okay. It was good. Not great. All in all, for $130 for two people, the experience was worth the first time and the food, while not the French laundry, was fine.

We ordered drinks which were so unique and delicious, and some of the best food we have ever tasted.

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because I made it clear to the waiter that it was my boyfriends birthday, and while several other people in the restaurant were recognized for having birthdays, he wasn't which was disappointing. Also, we were really disappointed with one of the dishes (the asparagus), and when we told the waiter, he didn't even apologize or take it off the bill.

5724347,2017-03-03,56,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"And the winner is Moonlight!  Wait!  That's a mistake!  The Real winner is, La La Lago! 
Located inside the Bellagio Hotel near the North Entrance.  This chic Italian inspired restaurant, for me, is one of the all around best restaurants I've experienced in Vegas.  Lago is deserving of all 5 stars. 

One for its Service.  A star-studded performance by the staff on each and every one of my visits.  Always pleasant, always attentive, and knowledgeable of the menu(what a concept huh).   

One for its remarkable Visuals.  Lago décor is one of beauty.  This sleek stylish design with its breathtaking panoramic center-stage views of the Fountains of Bellagio, will surely elevate the level of your experience.  They do have a patio seating area that's even more impressive.  

One for its uplifting Spirits.  Innovation in creating the most refreshing and flavorful PASSIONFRUIT MOJITO I ever had.  The smooth operator CARAJILLO with its Licor 43 & Espresso combo making it a perfect after dinner drink.  This drink's companion is a dark chocolate spoon, meant for stirring licking or nibbling, whichever satisfies your current mood.  Top billing on the Lago Mixology Collection is LAGO COCKTAIL.  A unique and impressive cast of ingredients which you can have made sweet or spicy.  I've only tried and enjoyed the spicy, where Cayenne pepper was used.  Also, making a special cameo appearance by the ROSSO BELLINI, what a diva.   

One for its exceptional Food.  Anyone who knows me, knows I love a table full of food.  Lago has some of the most fascinating tapas.  Thanks to Julian Serrano's creations, my table has always been full. 
Starting off with the complimentary OLIVE BREAD, which I must say was FUC'n amazing. 
Want raw beef?  If you do and don't mind it thin, then you'll love CARPACCIO DI MANZO...tender, moist and flavorful.  Succulent pieces of meat you'll want to put in your mouth.  The SCALOPPINA DI VITELLO (veal piccata) thin, tender and flavorful as well. 
For you Seafood lovers.  The TOTANO RIPIENO (grilled shrimp stuffed squid),
SALMONE (both sashimi & cooked), POLPO E FREGOLA AL NERO (octopus with squid ink cous cous), HAMACHI (yellowtail), CAPASANTA (scallops, blood orange, and pistachio), are equally spectacular in their own way.  The CAPASANTA ALLA PUTANESCA (scallops, tomatoes, boquerone sauce) were FUC'n amazing!  The '7 & 7' was dish was orgasmic, for you food porn lovers.  This extremely tender Potato Gnocchi with the Lobster Knuckles will surely please your senses.  Look at the pic.  I'm sure you'll wanna taste.     

One final star goes to Lago's drop dead gorgeous Desserts.  I was not only impressed with the taste, but also the plating and composition of ingredients of the desserts I've tried already.  The AMALFI is a Lemon Tart with Limoncello Sorbet and Passion Fruit coils.  The MATTONELLA AL CICCOLATO is a Flourless Chocolate Sponge Cake with Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate gelato, and Chocolate sauce.  Even though the CRÈME BRÛLÉE has a different consistency, texture, taste, I still found it to be perfect for my palate.  I enjoyed the TIRAMISU which was presented differently, deserving of an honorable mention.  Finishing this sweet list off with a happy ending, GIADUIOTTO, My Favorite.   

The Staff, Visuals, Cocktails, Food, and Desserts, all working in unison, for a complete climatic dinning experience, and all deserving of the 'Red Carpet' treatment. 

I will be returning for more happy endings!",iqalP7F7HrMbqO2762SWHQ,75,66,5,BECB-YQ18p37VWZNvvNEjg

I was expecting to be wowed by their food but it was pretty mediocre. Also sucks cause we came here to celebrate my dads bday and left unsatisfied. 

Zucca Allo Zenzero - One of the few dishes that actually was very good, it was a summer squash puree with ginger and spicy croutons for some added crunch

Bruschetta Al Pomodoro - Came with 4 pieces, the crostini it came on was crisp but chewy in the center. The diced tomatoes were light and refreshing and it was topped of with a drizzle of garlic oil and basil

Carpaccio Di Manzo - Served with big flat crackers and was kind of hard to eat since the raw beef was covered in arugula and parmesan (the shaved slices were too big and overpowering) we couldn't see that the beef wasn't in precut serving sizes it was basically just 2 or 3 really big ones laying on the plate so when you went to pick up some beef at first all of it pretty much came off the plate and onto your fork 

Polio E Fregola Al Nero - The octopus was the best part of this dish it was sooo soft and probably the best octopus I've ever had but the squid ink couscous was so salty 

Carciofi Granchio - The crab was very sweet and went well with the artichoke 

Brasato D'anatra - Braised duck was tender but the cheese polenta it was served with was so overpowering all I could taste was the cheese",JGZqnZ_WWI5S2vKsRp2ZIw,3,0,3,kVHtpmUVctEv05oQUMIruQ

5819218,2016-07-15,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"We celebrated our 5-year wedding anniversary at Lago this past Saturday.  I had very high expectations from this restaurant and chef and found it to be good, not great.  Firstly, we made a request for outdoor patio seating and we did not receive it.  I understand that the patio is small and that outdoor seating is not guaranteed, but it is unfortunate when a couple checks in with the hostess after us, admits they are 30 mins late to their reservation without calling, apologies for their mistake, and then get rewarded with super nice patio seating.  

Inside, the restaurant was absolutely full and buzzing with loud dance music.  If you are looking for a romantic ambiance, this is not it.  People are dressed very casually and there doesn't seem to be a dress code.  Many were in shorts and flip flops, and the guy sitting next to us looked like he just came back from a run, decked out in his jogging gear.  Awkward! 

Service was the lowest point.  Our waiter was hurried, unfriendly, the whole evening felt rushed, and very rarely came to check on us.  He did give us the helpful tip that we should order as we saw necessary as the plates came out tapas-style.  All in all, he wasn't very friendly. 

The food was also good, not great.  My favorite was the cannelloni short ribs and the spec pizza.  The rapini was very plain and the ricotta with honey can very easily be replicated at home.  Just a piece of focaccia with honey and cheese smeared on top.  

All in all, a good restaurant but if you are looking for something really exquisite to celebrate a very special occasion, this may not be your first choice.",qGfqAyyPIWoFZ0JC6yClgw,2,0,3,JOP8GRZKz15d_uoqORKD9Q

Once again we were seated on the restaurant patio, with an exceptional view of the dancing Bellagio Fountains and Paris' Eiffel Tower just across the way.  Service was impeccable from our omnipresent server Denise, and the food we ordered was sublime.  My party shared several small plates.

I began with fresh complimentary Cranberry Buns, a hot bowl of Pasta Fagioli e Cozze with PEI Mussels and Tubetti Pasta, a high heap of delightful Salumi and Flatbread, and Cesare Salad with Baby Romaine, a Ciabatta Crouton, and a delicate Caesar Anchovy Dressing.  Tonno Crudo was ultra-fresh, and a Honey Bun adorned with Alla Ricotta e Mile sweet and enjoyable.  Salumi was fresh, nicely varied, and a fine starter.

More substantial fare included tasty Striped Bass Entero, yummy Cannelloni, excellent plump Gamberi, delicious Potato Gnocchi with Lobster Knuckles, and juicy Filet Mignon cooked medium and served with delectable Roasted Potatoes.  

For dessert we enjoyed delicate Tiramisu, Chocolate Hazelnut Mattonella, refreshing Chocolate Gelato, and for me great Decaf.

our night started with a photo op with chef julian serrano who greeted all of us and even posed for a photo. we were quickly seated and checked on by our server fabio and the GM also named fabio.

i also loved our sommelier as i wanted to pick a tasty wine that was affordable since the ladies were treating me to a great meal. the wine menu has some solid and varied options that were familiar to me. the sommelier convinced me to try something new and boy was i happy we did.

loved, loved, loved our attentive server fabio. he seemed so genuine in his recommendations on what he liked and we got to try quite a few dishes which included his favs.

highlights were the burrata and the crab salad for appetizers. the risottos were also amazing whether it was the mushroom or the seafood risotto. yes, the dishes were on the smaller side compared to the all you can eat buffets but they were in fact the norm in europe.

Overpriced like all Bellagio restaurants.  However, we are willing to pay for over-priced if they are good Italian.  There are a lot better Italian Restaurant at Las Vegas then Lago.

Furthermore, I can't believe that Bellagio eliminated their Fountains Sunday Brunch and repplace it with Lago's 3-course Brunch.  Tried itthis morning (9/6/15).  It's not worth it.  I would definetly go to Mandarin Oriental or Wynn's Sunday Jazz Brunch from now on.  Eliminating Fountains Brunch will be one of the biggest mistake that Bellagio have made.",9spOHzbNneeJ4WUumAa6oA,3,0,2,iixWzeuVQlbhmIqWbPqkUw

5901875,2017-10-11,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"I had an incredibly enjoyable evening at Lago.

When my wife and I were first seated, I requested the wine list. I have to admit, I am not a big wine drinker. I know what styles I like but not winemakers, regions, and so one. When I realized how long the list was, I nearly fainted!

The sommelier quickly made his way over and man, what an awesome guy! He was able to relate what type I beer I like to drink to the wine list. He inquired about budget, which was nice, and found us a nice bottle from a region that he was particularly fond of.

I am sad to say, that bottle was gone in 30 minutes. It was that good! We liked it so much that the sommelier picked us out another follow up bottle after the first one disappeared.

I also enjoyed that the sommelier was able to recommend pairings for the wine as well. For the first bottle, he recommended a delicious sausage pasta. For the second bottle, he recommended some Spanish meats.

Besides the wine, the food was delicious. The good did make it to the table quickly, so I recommend spacing out your order..

I highly recommend Lago. It was one of my favorite meals in the States.",WfePuaS_iXGNGU6bfDe3JQ,0,0,5,ea9i0_xZD5sr2nza7YY2EQ

We had planned on eating at Lago because we had heard it was phenomenal. We had a group of 9 and our server asked us if we wanted to order on our own or if we wanted him to make us up a menu of the most popular items off of each of the sections on the menu. We opted to have him make us up a menu and let me tell you, it did not dissapoint. Every single thing that we tried was absolutely mouth watering. By far one of the best Italian meals I have ever had. All 9 of us left the restaurant completely stuffed!! My family and I are from Sonoma County in California and I wish there was a Lago around here so we could all go there again!",rZQF982cWwzQXl5JdH7mJw,1,0,5,xT_WAFpyy4LKz_25b8XqMg

We were greeted by the maitre'd upon check in and suggested to us to sit outdoors on the heated patio. The suggestion was spot on. There were enough heat lamps to make me warm although it was 45° outside and the view was spectacular. The fountains are directly in front of the dining area so one should try to sit on the patio. 
The food is meant to be shared plates so order accordingly. It really does give everyone the opportunity to try a little of everything. 
We started with orders of small foccacia; one  with fave been purée and pork cheek and the other was pecorino and green olive. Both were a great start to the meal to follow. 
The scallop crudo with blood orange is so light yet bursts with so much flavor.
The 7&7 is a must try. 7 gnocchi with lobster in a light sauce is perfect. 
Spaghetti with Clams in tomato sauce was heavenly as were the Clams in a spicy white wine.
The surprise for me was the Risotto in red wine and burrata. Very rich yet the burrata was a perfect compliment. 
The service was extremely attentive as was the sommelier. 
A definite recommendation for anyone in Las Vegas.",BW6y9Y9yM79DZO7E31Ri_Q,1,1,5,jwvuly29FKfn5WgUDzN_yQ

We had the mushrooms, Chipollini pizza, shrimp ravioli and beef cannelloni and all were good. Sent back the caponata as there was 2 small pieces of eggplant a lot of carrots and yellow squash making it a tasteless mix veggie dish being called caponata. Considering where you are it is worth a try. Check the bill as 2 of the 5 food items we had were over charged $1.00 from the menu price on a big party that will add up.",dqoVCK-Pk-PrRv0kfyPJnQ,1,0,3,L2bYrK-h02-KWp9Gz8JTqw
5952091,2016-07-06,0,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"Our dinner at Lago made our Las Vegas trip!! First off, I heard through online reviews that this place was the place to be to see the amazing fountains at Bellagio, and it certainly was. The view is perfect! We were celebrating our engagement and I wrote this on my reservation and requested a window table. When we arrived, I was promptly greeted and ""congratulated"" on our engagement, which was such an attentive gesture, as they actually read the ""notes!"" We were led to the best table in the house, along the window in the middle - the best view of the fountains! Because it was 4th of July weekend, the fountains seemed to go off every 10 minutes, more often than usual after 8pm. The food was amazing also. Everything was PERFECTLY seasoned and PERFECTLY cooked. I tend to enjoy food that could be over-seasoned as well, and Lago was just right, not too seasoned or salty, but highlighted the ingredients in the dish. Notable selections were (well, all dishes were great!!!) 7 & 7, the lobster gnocchi which had a sort of pumpkin/squash sauce that you lapped up with a spoon, the truffle risotto special - with tons of sliced truffles on top and a perfectly cooked risotto with lots of white wine (?) flavor - great consistency on the risotto (not watery at all, but not to thick) as most restaurants miss this mark!! We also had the stuffed calamari, which focused on the flavor of the calamari and shrimp stuffing, perfectly seasoned and cooked. We also ordered the braised duck over tasty cheese polenta, which was amazing. We don't particularly love polenta, but this was really tasty and had a good cheese and perfectly salted flavor. Finally, we were brought a surprise dessert, a small banana cream cheesecake to share and they had written ""Congratulations"" on the plate! It was such a surprise and I was so thankful for their attention to our special occasion! Thank you Lago!!! Can't wait to come back soon!",4jfPgXcOwipxR1uDIy2oEA,1,1,5,uYky-6v7FL3jhs8-Eo_o3g

5954518,2017-07-14,3,SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg,"The food at Lago is definitely five stars! I've never ordered anything that wasn't top notch! The first time I went there, I ordered the branzino livornese. I loved it! The only other time I've had branzino was at Bardot brasserie and theirs was terribly bland! The one at Lago is definitely more flavorful! I took a bite out of my friend's dish which was the Crusted Salmon and oh my, that was is also bursting with flavors! If you want to order a fish, I would definitely go for either of those two!

My second time around, I went with their three course tasting menu and ordered the caprese salad, Petto di pollo ripieno, and the hazelnut cake. My friend ordered the tonno and the anatra e polenta. The caprese salad was yummy! The tomatoes were fresh and so was the cheese. It had the perfect amount of saltiness. The chicken was a little overdone but still flavorful! The mashed potatoes that came with it was amazing! It was creamy and the sauce on it was just yums! No words could explain it. My friend's duck dish was also delicious! If you had shrimp and grits, it's kind of similar. I would want to order it next time. The two desserts I've tried is the hazelnut cake and the panna cotta and both are exceptionally delicious! 

So the jist of it all, everything was flavorful and delicious. Docking off one star because I literally had to hunt down just to get a water refill and that's my biggest pet peeve. You should always keep the waters and drinks filled. 

Oh well! I will definitely be coming back in the near future.

The duck with polenta, that could have caused a fight for the last of it, that's how god it was, great duck over creamy and cheesy polenta. The focaccia with ricotta and honey could have been a dessert, great and was essentially a cinnamon roll lol. We got the pesto but opted for the wider pappardelle noodles, great choice.

Did not do desserts but they looked good.
