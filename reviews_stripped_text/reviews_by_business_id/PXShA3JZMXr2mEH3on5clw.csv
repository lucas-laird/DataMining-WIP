11306,2014-08-23,2,PXShA3JZMXr2mEH3on5clw,"Wow, I feel bad for everyone who wrote glowing reviews.  They obviously have been subjected to really awful food all of their life.

I got the chicken fried steak with over medium eggs and one of the muffins everyone raved about.  Everything came with enough salt to preserve my digestive organs for the afterlife.  The potatoes are cheap, frozen cubes soaked in season salt...inedible.  the gravy was also way overseasoned, might of had some potential if not for that.  The banana nut muffin was nothing to write home about and had a weird texture.

The husband got the avocado bacon omelette.  Though he is a hearty eater, two thirds of his food was left behind.  The omelette had a ton of cheese melted over top, usually a good thing, not in this case.  The cheese looked plastic like and he said it tasted microwaved.  He too had a large portion of blood pressure killing potatoes.

The kid had chocolate chip pancakes.  Nothing to write home about but apparently way better than what we got.

$41 for this lousy meal.  When we paid, the lady asked how everything was and my husband replied very salty and terribly overseasoned.  She responded by giggling like a school girl and telling him the total.  Way to handle a complaint there.  A $2 egg mcmuffin beats this junk any day.",dX89VEsFD5QWztMCGRljKg,1,1,1,vT4e21xp1Je_IZNYHht6WQ

The potatoes came fresh but were over-salted and almost inedible. The side of sausage came when I was halfway through the meal. Usually when I come here the service is really good, today, it was just ok. The restaurant was pretty busy (noon on a Friday) and the service was a bit frantic and at times hard to get. The waiter didn't even bother giving his name or asking for a Yelp review, perhaps he already knew things had been a bit subpar (the receipt listed CJ as the waiter).

I asked her for a recommendation on the menu, and I'm glad I took it. She even mentioned that they did half orders on most items on the menu.

They have a system set up to grab the staff's attention when you need something. You just flip an egg icon to reveal a yellow unhappy face. We never had to deal with that since everything was perfect. Our food came out FAST. The half order of the Chile Rellenos omelet was more than enough! It came with potatoes and a banana nut muffin.

Thankfully, I didn't encounter any of the above at Egg Works.

The omelets here are absolutely delicious. I got one with mashed potatoes inside -- what's not to love? I also tried the veggie omelet -- very good, too. Oh and I'm a fan of the home fries. Fresh food, enormous portions, and friendly service.

The only downsides were the speed of service -- the kitchen was swamped that day, so things were SLOWWW. Also, the orange juice is not fresh squeezed (but I appreciate that the waitress was honest when I asked if it is fresh squeezed).",27d7hQmm76cXaK5ZbYS2Eg,0,0,4,4p6eJ_QnCVO77qFPwR3v3Q

Today we went and waited 10 minutes to get waited on.  The restaurant was not busy and with a 2 year old who is hungry and wants his milk and pancakes it isn't fun to wait.   It was very frustrating I had to stand up and wait until someone was walking around and ask for help to get our drinks and take our order.  Because my grandson is so young I always over tip usually 25% of the bill because of the mess that he can make.  Sad experience today.,hlBXFb8w8nSO7qE89crZ9g,0,0,2,-sD6DZ0kNpkOYvJJYhjNBw

319014,2012-09-16,0,PXShA3JZMXr2mEH3on5clw,"Their prices are very reasonable in my opinion because they give you large portions. I've only been to this location twice (2nd time was today), and I have to say that while the food is good, their customer service is lacking. We were seated right away since it was only 2 people, and we got our drinks fast, but the waitress did not bother to take our meal orders until maybe 15-20 min later. and the waitress who actually took our order was not the one who gave us our drinks. She was shocked that no one had taken our order and apologized. I don't care how busy you are. I just think to wait 20 minutes just to order is a little ridiculous. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate their food a 7. I'm surprised that a restaurant who serves eggs doesn't have healthier options listed on the menu. You can substitute the potatoes for fruit and the muffin/toast is optional. I think this should be listed on the menu. All the omelets have cheese on them. So you need to say no cheese if you don't want it. No big deal. I just think it's not the most health-conscious menu. I also didn't see anything about egg whites on there. You just have to ask for that. The inside is not nice at all. It looks like the inside of a McDonald's. It's a little loud in there too. 

Overall, if you want to go to a cheap place and don't mind waiting a long time for your order to be taken, then you should go here. You'll get large portions and the prices are good.  However, if you're looking for quality, a nice atmosphere, and a staff that comes by your table to see how you're doing (general customer service), I don't recommend it.",2vOCql-V-pg8CFfE5bExgQ,1,1,2,CK0VRXIQ58BwvBVUsVFvLw

Service was fairly quick, they were obv trying to turnover as many tables as possible, but we didn't feel rushed

The food was good. I order the sunrise mountain (open croissant with eggs, sausage and cheese on top), lady got the waffles and her friend got the French toast. 

The girls liked tier meals although the waffles were a bit too doughy. every special requests tended to, sizeable portions. 

The sunrise mountain was pretty good,  generous portion. It was served in a cast iron dish with the croissant covering the bottom and the eggs, sausage, and cheese melted over the top. It was pretty heavy and there was a lot of cheese on it and I will probably ask for less next time.

The husband and I gobbled them like fiends. The gravy definitely passed muster with my mid-western heart...rich and loaded with meaty flavor, and no pastiness. My eggs were perfectly cooked, as were my husband's. The biscuits were weird, tough and chewy. No fluffiness here...and they are an odd artificial golden yellow color, throughout. We actually scanned the menu to see what we could get that delish gravy on next time, because I never want to bite one of those creepy biscuits again. We'll be back to try their other offerings, because the plates that sailed by us on their way to other diners looked quite tempting. Coffee was just meh.. not yucky, just meh.

My father had the Waffle Works dish which was waffles and a slab of ham and I think country potatoes. He loved it. My mom had the blueberry pancakes. She loved them. I had the ham and cheese omelet.

Our server, Marc, was fantastic. He was patient, courteous, and friendly. He answered our questions and was generally helpful.

The food was top notch. I got the corned beef and eggs breakfast. The quantity of food made it more than worth the $11+ cost. My partner has the 'island favorite' which was two thick slices of grilled spam, eggs, and sticky rice. He thought it was really good.

In summary, Egg Works. Even though it's slightly higher cost than some, is on my list of great places to eat and I highly recommend it.",oQZnXEG-eogNm9fOweCd3A,0,0,5,kNasO6ogpIFZJkM_vEbOQw

Food:  
The potatoes have me dreaming for them at night.  That seasoning is delicious and it has just the right texture.  The first time I went here I had a crepe with avocado and pico.....I can't remember the name of it but it was delicious.

Service:
Hmm it was okay.  It could have been better considering that they have eggs on the table to show your server whether you need service or not.  I thought it was genius at first but then began to think of how impersonal it is.  I enjoy servers coming up to me randomly asking how everything is and my water magically re-appearing.  That's when you know your service is good.  The fact that they rely on the clients to passively flip a sign is kind of a turn-off.  Come and talk to me...

I ordered pork and eggs, potatoes, and toast. Since I cannot eat eggs, the waitress let me substitute fruit for the eggs. The potatoes were delicious. It was seasoned and like the potatoes that you get with hash.  My husband ordered stuffed french toast. He thought they were stuffed with fruit and cream cheese (his mistake), but when it came out it was like a french toast sandwich. An egg scramble with meat between two pieces of french toast. The waitress was willing to exchange it for the strawberry and cream cheese french toast (which is the one that he was looking at), but my husband's mistake so he kept his plate. He did enjoy his breakfast. The other people at our table ordered the banana nut french toast and the loco moco. They both were happy with what they ordered. Our waitress was very nice. She kept our drinks filled as best as she could since the restaurant was completely packed. We didn't mention that it was our first time to the restaurant, but she must have figured it out with some of our questions.

1. the potatoes.
I prefer potatoes over hash browns 9/10 times. I don't know what kind of seasoning they put on these things, but like Terry P. said, they're like crack.
2. coffee creamer.
I don't know if this is available at other places, but here they offer flavored creamer to go with your cup o' joe. I really appreciate this because I like my coffee ""girlie"".

Although I've been to the Egg & I on Sahara countless times, I had never been to Egg Works on Sunset. Same good food, same crowded environment. And, thankfully, same awesome seasoned potatoes!

Although it was not quite 11, we both opted for lunch rather than breakfast. Christy had the reuben, and I had the Carlsbad club, which was sort of like a regular club but with the addition of avocado and the subtraction of the middle piece of bread. Christy loved her sandwich (and it did look pretty good), and my sandwich was good (not great). But we each ordered a side of the aforementioned potatoes, and that IS a great thing. I'm sure the ""secret ingredient"" to these little potato chunks is just Lawry's seasoned salt (or something comparable), but that seasoning makes all the difference.

The restaurant was crowded, but we were seated quickly and our food came out fast. They have a little egg-shaped flip card on the table so if you need service, you can turn it from black to yellow and someone will come to your table ASAP. We used the flip card to ask for takeout boxes, and they were Johnny-on-the-Spot about responding. And to top it all off, I had a BYGO Entertainment book coupon, so both our meals (with two iced teas) were under $20!

Depending on which side of town you're on, you can probably find an Egg Works family restaurant somewhere near you. And I suggest you do, if not for their myriad egg dishes, for -- what else? -- their tasty taters.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,4,bGhAKd5eHgU73EKYMfpzNw

Seated quickly, even though it was busy was a plus, Hostess was courteous. The server, seemed ok, but I could tell that some of her surrounding tables, were agitated. (Shoulda known). Server took our order & most of the food came in a timely manner - most...The server dropped the food she had & took off - not asking if we needed anything else. I noticed my silverware had dried food debris - so I had to wait to have a staff member bring my a clean set. Also the fruit garnish - which I admit I dont usually eat - the pineapple slice was rotten (I took a pic to show I wasn't exaggerating). But the most irritating thing was that the server FORGOT to put in the order for one of my daughters so she sat for almost ten min with nothing - the server - while apologetic, didn't seem sincere. Maybe because I overheard her apologize to four other tables for similar mistakes - Heres an observation - if she would have done her job correctly in the first place - she wouldnt have to apologize. So she brings the meal - then wants to chit chat while we're eating - she just butt into a conversation that had nothing to do with her...Really???
I'm not the type looking for free things but when I make a mistake - I would comp the guest the item that was in question - instead she brings a loaf of banana bread - which we didnt order or ask for in lieu of a discount
I dont get to go out to breakfast with my family often as I used to  - so it is a special event for me. So when I pick someplace for breakfast I expect something close to perfection....SADLY DISAPPOINTED",tLh_JxaQNZRr07hdN5hNRA,2,0,2,qu3TogGFJShAEm_-8P1rBQ

Just a few points about this establishment:

1.  The entrance to the restrooms is decorated like an outhouse-disturbing, but cute!

2.  If it is your first time, they give you a delicious muffin

3.  Unlike everywhere else in Vegas, they leave the carafe of coffee on the table, and outfit you with all the sweeteners and flavored/unflavored dairy/non-dairy creamers your heart could ever desire

4.  The eggs benedict is probably the best in Vegas (not the best ever, by any means, but definitely fantastic)

5.  It's one of those ""pay at the register when you are done"" kind of places; just don't forget to leave the tip 
.

The  Sunrise Mountain was ok, the croissant was bland and the whole dish felt like it was missing something.  
Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy had excellent gravy, but the biscuits didn't go well with it. 
The potato's were excellent on both dishes. I'm not a huge fan of banana nut muffins, but that was probably the softest muffin I have ever had. 
The service was spot on and made the visit worth it. Our food was out quickly, our waitress was overly attentive, and other waitresses got us water as they walked by.

In the years that I've been frequenting the establishments, I haven't had bad service. This recent experience, going around noon, was no different. The funny thing about going in that time frame is that their busiest period had passed. Hahaha... According to the boyfriend, there was like 2 servers to 1 table, constantly checking on their patrons, and still able to have a good time with co-workers. 
Anyway, I like their skillets, particularly their Chicken Fried Steak. The boyfriend likes their Patty Melts. I think their fries and red potatoes (breakfast plates) are seasoned the same way. It's just yummy. Hahaha... I like the way they leave the coffee pot with the table so I can just help myself unless that runs out.
I think the only thing I didn't like about this experience was paying for the bill... The ladies didn't acknowledge me when I walked up to the desk.

egg works 2 is close to the vegas airport and closest to the east end of the strip. egg & i and egg works 1 are closer to the west end of the strip. 

so their menu is SUPER LARGE.
crepes, pancakes, waffles, bennys, french toasts, skillets, burgers... you name it, it's probably on it. 

their must order: BLACKENED PRIME RIB BENNY.
      grilled croissant with prime rib, sautéed spinach and roasted red bell peppers
      add in 2 poached eggs w/ hollandaise sauce. it does not stop there ... you get hash potatoes (w/ that lawry's like salt) ...for $12. the thing is HUGE. i mean... dude, they grill a croissant as the bread base!!! yes, it probably has more calories than your rec'd daily value... but uh... forget it for a day, yeah? :D

i ordered the CRAZY CHICKEN (using egg whites) omelet ... large pieces of delicious tender chicken with lots of avocados topped with muenster cheese and sour cream. it is HUGE... .and comes with a large side of fruit (or some other side if you wish) ...and...

HOMEMADE BANANA NUT MUFFIN!! SOOO DELICIOUS!!!

service was impeccable.. waitress was so nice to us and made sure we were satisfied. she's the one with the chinese lettering tattoos on her right and left wrists. if you see her, you know she'll treat you well!!

So, I just don't understand people willing to wait 30+ minutes to eat an omelet or another equally rudimentary breakfast food.
So, on a handful of occasions when the wait time was not ridiculous I've had a chance to try this place. They have a large menu and their service is solid. I am also a fan of the endless coffee refills.  I have had their basic eggs breakfast, sampled several of the omelets, and most recently highly enjoyed their carnitas rancheros menu item. Everything is fine, and that is pretty much the most you can expect out of these joints...hence why I don't understand the hype or the wait times.

No. It wasn't fine. It was maybe mediocre at best. I got a veggie skillet that required me to dig through the lukewarm eggs and quagulated cheese to find. Don't boast of a ""totally loaded veggie skillet!!!"" that had two mushrooms in it, a bit of tomatoes, no onions, and a few skimpy bell peppers. Worst ever.

 1. Place is popular. If you think your eating at say 10am, get there at 9:30am to reserve your seat. For us they told us it was a 20 min wait but it was more like 15 min. If you have an impatient party do come in earlier. 

 2. There are coupons in local magazines.

My friend, girlfriend, and I had already chosen what we desired yet, we waited an additional 10-15 minutes. It was busy but there's no excuse for waiting that long. I got the corned beef hash which was not that well cooked and the hash was shredded way too excessively. It was almost as if I'm tasting carnitas. On top of that was scrambled eggs, which there is nothing bad you can say about standard scrambled eggs. The potatoes were actually quite good. They had some kind of salt and spice that was addicting. But there's a problem when the side tastes better than the main dish.

Not only is it beyond busy (can't really imagine why), the staff was not helpful, orders were wrong, and the food was forgettable. 

This was such a let down. I was running late to a group breakfast with my parents and another couple, I told my mom to order for me. Without looking at a menu, I just said to get a Reuben.

When I got there, my food was waiting for me, and everyone was eating besides my mom. I guess that the waitress had gotten the order wrong, and my mom was waiting for a new plate. My mom said that I would be arriving later, and my plate arrived early.

As I tried to eat my (cold) sandwich, I asked for some thousand island and water.

While we were eating, a different waitress comes and says, ""I was told to bring you a muffin."" 

Not, hello, I have a muffin for you. Or, did someone need a muffin?

She sounded unhappy to be handing out delicious muffins. How can you be grumpy when you are handing out bomb muffins?

Overall, overpriced, bland, mushy food.
The fries were good though.
This is also the 2nd time that orders have been wrong for my parents. Not cool.

I don't usually review a place after only one visit but in this case I'll make the exception because we probably won't be back for a year. When we do come back, I'll suggest this place to the peeps because it really was that good. Loved the menu and walked away with an Egg Works coffee mug.

My only criticism comes in because they have buckwheat pancakes on the menu, which I love. However, when I asked if they were gluten free (I'm a glutard) the server had to go away to find out. On return she said no, they have wheat. WTF?! In this day and age with so many glutards out there, you have to be somewhat accommodating. I know there are many other gluten-free options on the menu, but there were no pancakes and I had a hankerin' for pancakes. This is the only reason they lost a star.

My veggie omelet was excellent and really enjoyed the potatoes. My mate had a very traditional type breakfast with eggs over easy and sourdough toast. We both very much enjoyed our breakfast.

In the end, I can only say that we loved the place and will be back next time around. The only thing I would suggest is a little more attention to detail and to try to do something for those with common food restrictions.

Upon being led to a 2-seater table in the middle of the walkway in the restaurant, I politely asked if we could sit in a 4-seater on the side of the room. The restaurant was not filled. The young brunette hostess told us that she is ""NOT ALLOWED TO SEAT 2 PEOPLE IN 4-SEATERS ON A SATURDAY MORNING."" Being that I was with my 78 year old non-confrontational Asian Mother, I did not persist in asking for another table. Our server was very sweet, as all the servers have been in my past 4-5 visits to Egg Works. 

As we filled our stomachs with hot coffee, I became more and more lucid and then noticed that the 4-seater tables to the left of us and behind us had two people at each of them. I then observed Miss Hostess bringing another couple to a 4-seater across from me. The restaurant NEVER filled up while we were there.

1942699,2016-12-01,3,PXShA3JZMXr2mEH3on5clw,"I really truly did want to try Egg Works after having it bookmarked for so long. The parking lot had plenty of parking. We arrived mid-morning so we avoided the morning rush and were seated promptly. Looking around everyone was taking food to go so we opted to share an omelette and get an extra muffin with the Yelp check-in. I asked the waiter if this would be okay and she said yes. We ordered the works omelette as it seemed to have a little bit of everything.

Our muffins arrived and neither of us was impressed with it. Sure it was warm and the butter melted on it but the flavor I was expecting just wasn't there. Our omelette arrived and the portion was really huge. I was disappointed as everything was so chopped and mushed that you couldn't distinguish any of the contents and this we both found disgusting. The even more disgusting part is yet to come. When our bill arrived, we noticed we were charged for the muffin in addition our omelette. No big deal, or so I thought. Thought they'd take care of it when we checked out at the cash register but boy, I didn't think it would take a whole lot of time.

The cashier started to pull up our check and I let her know about the Yelp check-in. She proceeded to insist that because we ordered an ""extra"" muffin that's why we were charged. After explaining it she proceeded to ask the hostess if the Yelp check-in was still valid. If anyone should know these things, you'd think it would be the cashier who rings people up all day. Now there was a line of at least 3 people waiting to pay their checks and I could certainly feel their eye rolls over waiting during this whole ordeal. It wasn't the $2 muffin, but the sole principal that if you have something on your Yelp page, you should honor it. Lastly, they had to have the manager come over and remove it from our bill. 

I'm not quite sure I understand the hype of this place. Come if you have an abundance of time to kill, but don't expect the food to be anything special. There are plenty of other places in the area that we've been to that rank way higher than Egg Works. Sorry, but unfortunately we won't be coming back here.

From the moment we walked in, to the moment we paid our bill I felt very welcomed by the staff, who are genuinely nice! 

The food was quickly prepared, then quickly eaten, lol. My hubby ordered the waffles, with a couple eggs and bacon on the side. I appreciate how they brought this out as soon as it was made so that he was able to enjoy the waffles while they were still fresh and hot! Other places would let it sit under heat lamps and bring it out when all the food was done, but not this place- this place is actually thoughtful and considerate! My gf and I ordered the delicious loco moco. Dude, this dish is aaaaaaHmazing! The gravy that's smothered throughout the beef patty is so tasty and add that all up plus my over easy runny egg- boom, you have a heavenly sent dish! So good!

Today was just another 5 star experience. Amy helped us at the counter and was seriously one of the best servers I've ever had. She knew based off my hesitation between potatoes and fruit, that MAYBE I might want half and half! And guess what? I DID! She was very nice and friendly, kept our water glasses filled and sitting at the counter couldn't have been any better.

I got my usual, the breakfast burrito (traditional one) and my husband got Brad's scramble. He was a huge fan of it because it had mushrooms in it and he wasn't aware it would come like that, but oh well! The toast was great! My breakfast burrito was beautiful made and that Diablo sauce really just tied everything together.

The woman next to me got this beautiful French toast option, if I wasn't trying to watch my weight, I would have easily ran off with her French toast.

Can't wait to eat here again, wish these were in LA! So happy they've become successful in Vegas. :)",gYXfYPo5LPv56CHd0vd_NA,0,1,5,Lo7DwiVpAkA2s0g9rkoriA

I've been to Egg & I and knew this place was pretty much the same, so of course I ordered the Stuffed French Toast Sandwich with sausage ($10.25) and chocolate chip pancakes ($9.25 for 3 pancakes) for my dad and I to share.  I've had their chocolate chip pumpkin pancakes before and it  was to die for, but the plain chocolate chips one was less impressive.  They need to add whipped cream to it or something because just syrup doesn't really work with this kind of dish.  The stuffed french toast was amazing, especially with a drizzle of syrup, and their seasoned potatoes were good too.  We also had the banana nut muffins - FREE with a Yelp check-in!  Michelle was an awesome and cool server, refilling our waters without having to ask and just being really there for us when we needed her.  The service was perfect for a Sunday morning right before heading back home.  It's very filling here, so try and order different plates and share because the menu is HUGE!

What was great was the muffin. Warm, moist and delicious. I contiplated buying the loaf to take back, but didn't think i would be able to keep it in tack during my  flight home. The pancake was moist, huge and tasty.
The eggs were not whole fresh eggs, tasted like the carton kind. I guess I should have ordered overhard. The potatoes were over seasoned and covered in paprika the worst thing I tasted on my whole trip.

All of the staff was super friendly and welcoming. They were quick to get our drink order. Coffee tasted fresh and was good. We chose to sit on the patio, but it was a little noisy because of the planes literally flying right over the parking lot, so low you could practically look in the windows and wave to the passengers. We thought that was kind of fun, but it might be really annoying for some people. 

Their menu is quite large, with many, many options. Any kind of egg dish you can imagine is available. I got the Veggie Benny and my husband got the Mexican-style burrito. (I can't remember exactly what it was called, but it has chorizo). 

The food came out promptly and looked and smelled incredible! Everything was very fresh. My Veggie Benny had toasted english muffins, topped with grilled tomato slices, fresh sliced avocado, fresh spinach, topped with two perfectly poached eggs and a tasty sauce. I greatly enjoyed it. The potatoes served with it were really delicious, but a little over-seasoned. 

My husband's burrito was large and the red sauce it was covered in looked like it was made fresh, not canned. He loved it.

The menu looks like a newspaper and reads a bit like one too.  A lot of selections including breakfast and lunch items.  We all decided to have breakfast.  I'm not a big eater and was going to simply have one egg with toast and was happy to see it on the menu; however, at almost $9.00 like wow!  So I decided for a few more dollars to go ahead and pig out, sigh.  I had the waffle with fruit, bacon and 2 eggs.  It was tasty but nothing spectacular.  My husband had the porkchops which he wasn't impressed with.  Our son had some kind of egg burrito which had too many green peppers that were raw.  They were very accomodating to remake it without the peppers which was nice.  He enjoyed it finally.  The restaurant and the restrooms were very clean.  The staff was hustling and doing a good job.  I probably won't go back because the prices were very high for the quality of food that you got.  The serving sizes were adequate.  I just can't get over the prices for food that isn't anything to brag about.",jE8f3q6WxJnU_dW-rjdHeQ,0,0,3,_44GOXMtL0r2ndGfqLu2bg

To drive all the way back to a restaurant during lunch hour is such a hassle. Then, when I called the manager to let her know my muffin was missing she said ""well the cooks said they even gave you 2 muffins and threw in a free muffin."" Lady, do you really think I would call all the way back to a restaurant to lie over a missing muffin ????? Seriously. Smh.

Then I order a kids juice for my son, and the cashier says its a large juice and it was a kids size juice for $2.70. That's way too expensive for a kids size juice which is even weird because their menu is not expensive at all !

2255086,2012-06-19,0,PXShA3JZMXr2mEH3on5clw,"Stopped by Egg Works before heading back to LA after reading about it in a little magazine that was in the taxi. We decided to make the trek out because of the free breakfast entree coupon. The yelp reviews looked great, so we decided to head to Egg Works instead of a typical Sunday brunch on the strip. Whenever we woke up that Sunday morning, we packed and stumbled to the car to get some breakfast. After about a 20 minute drive from the strip, we finally arrived at Egg works. 

The place is relatively big, so the wait for 3 wasn't about 15 minutes. After being seated, we were promptly served drinks and then was left to look over the extensive menu. I decided on a side order of the corned beef hash and the Green Chili omelet. The omelet was extremely large. It probably had 3 whole Ortega chilies, a ton of cheese, and another ton of cheese on top. The omelet was good, but nothing special. Along with the omelet came a side of home potatoes that seemed like it was tossed with a whole bottle of Lawry's season salt. If you like that stuff, then you'll love these potatoes. If not, I'd see if they can cut the season salt next time. The corned beef and hash was interesting. It was more like corned beef and mashed potato pancake that was crisped on the flat top. 

Overall, if you have time to venture beyond the strip, check Egg Works out. You won't be hungry after the meal.",KGcyC9KXloxW_6YMG3V-Ng,1,0,4,541CWhbgrbtQQMaByYAT2A

Usually come here about once every two weeks. But the last time we went....our food was not all that great. Now of course, as soon as we walked in we got seated. Didn't like where we were placed because we like a little privacy...so we asked the lady hostess if we can be moved and she said yes and placed us near the back by the kitchen (which was not too bad).

We ordered, and waited about 20 minutes until our food came out. Our banana nut muffin were the first things that came out. Probably the best thing we had from them. Now the worst thing about being at a restaurant is seeing & hearing all the arguments in the kitchen. This is exactly what happened. We heard complaints from the kitchen workers, and the waiters and just everything we didn't want to....nor need to really hear. 

Soon as our food came out, it was super salty and soggy!!! My boyfriend ordered the skillet and I had the homemade corned beef hash. Everyone loves a little salt here and there...but having too much, I thought I was going to have a heart attack! Then we got our checks and left.

Overall it was a bad experience and I don't think we'll return to this place again. Such a shame because we loved this place and it's close to our place. I hope we find another breakfast joint soon.",Hj5TpJNOXqNt62Gbpr5WYw,3,1,3,B1t8yHluTCzjHdIhEZKn5g

The portion size is adequate for the amount of seasoned hash browns. The flavor was great in both the works veggie Benedict and the veggie crepe. The service was very friendly and accommodating. They could probably cut back a little on the hash browns but because the item was such a good size, I wasn't upset at all, its just that I like to finish my entire plate but if I did, it would've been a lot...too much, which isn't exactly bad but being a former chef, I pay attention to food waste. From a customer point of view it's great, though. Plus, they are deep fried hash brown diced cubes. It cancels out my recent quest for healthy breakfast of eating more veggies.

It was delicious! I ate very bite. Yum to the 10th power!!!

I was actually impressed.  Real spacious and nicely decorated barn look!? like the entrance to the restrooms.  There's outside dining area, a kinda private room for large groups, a breakfast counter for solo diners, TV's, WIFI.  Service was quick, it wasn't that busy because it was a later lunch.

So it looks like most of their menu were breakfast dishes since it doesn't look to be open for dinner. Most of the dishes looked really good and were large portions. I had the Spinach Benny which was really delicious but didn't care for the sides, a slice of grape fruit and pineapple, with some Works potatoes. Server hooked me up with a pretty good banana muffin which I didn't order.  Someone had the pancakes which seemed a good portion but heard it taste pretty basic. Others had the corn beef hash and some other really good looking breakfast dishes, I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu.

I found a BOGO coupon online at Las Vegas Review Journal website lvrj.com and printed a bunch for our large group.

It was no easy choice as their menu is full of a lot of dishes to choose from. 

We settle on the chile rellenó omelette (4 out of 5 stars as I would sub out the red sauce for a green sauce) and the Mexican omelette 4 stars as it had a little bit more onions than I'd like).

Service is great, above and beyond what most places do. And it's also very well known by the locals and very busy all the time, but that shouldn't stop you from visiting! Parking is very open and free, and the menu is a newspaper (very creative :) )

My wife ordered an omelet. I'm not a fan of omelet but when the wife wants eggs, well, a restaurant called ""Egg Works"" should fit the bill. The omelet was actually quite good - very fluffy, very well-stuffed, and accompanied by these delicious little packets of awesomeness called Diablo Potatoes. Essentially, the Diablo potatoes are little bundles of flavor that demons have salted with addictiveness so that you will always come back and feed on them. Just kidding - they're like home fries but with special house seasoning and perfectly roasted. I got a CA crepe, filled with mushrooms, avocados, bacon, swiss cheese. It was very good and enough to feed a small 3rd world country. I only ended up eating half because any more would mean that I would food coma for the rest of the week and I would very much like to be alive during my honeymoon, 

All in all, it was very much worth the price, as we ended up sending just north of $20. So totally worth it for a nice brunch or breakfast.

I might have put up with the clucking of the loud obnoxious lead waitress at the pass screaming out for service had the food been at least worth it. My waitress was very sweet and helpful in describing what's good to eat. She was pushing the hash as the best thing on the menu. I decided to play it safe with a cheese omelet. I struck out on this one. The omelet was rubbery and the potatoes were greasy which really did a number on me a few hours later. I don't know what they put in the potatoes but they had a rancid taste and the slight smell and taste of vinegar. The portions are ridiculousness huge but considering the double wide waste lines of the patrons in this joint, I can see why the customers don't complain. 

Another reason not to sit at the counter: the absolutely most disgusting thing I have read in a restaurant or for that matter read anywhere in public, except maybe in a doctors exam room, was pasted on the wall right in front of me at the lunch counter. 

Are you ready? Wait...if you are eating and reading put your fork down now. Fair warning....here it comes: (Remember I didn't get that warning as I was eating my rubber omelet). When you sit at a lunch counter, it's normal to glance around and stare directly ahead of you. My attention was drawn to a cheeky sign that read ""Will trade coffee for gossip"". Ok, that's typical coffee house cute. That's not the bad part. Below this sign there is a typed notice from management to the employees on when it is acceptable for an employee to be excused from coming to work: There are five reasons and I only got to read up to # 2 before I lost my appetite reading about projectile bodily functions. The sign says something to the affect that in order to protect the health of the other workers and patrons, the following reasons are acceptable accuses for not coming to work. They are: 1: Vomiting. 2: Diarrhea, 3: who knows what the rest said. Bleh! 

So there I sat with little miss spitfire hollering out for service on my right, I got the busboy on my left drying all the flatware and clanging them into containers while giving me the stink eye every so often. I've got this sign in front of me that I should have taken as a warning for my afternoon discomfort to come! Earlier, the waitress offered to give me a sampling of the hash, which thankfully she forget to bring. I pushed the rubber egg aside, grabbed the check and headed to the cashier. When the cashier asked me if everything was alright, I asked her if she thought that was appropriate to post that sign at the lunch counter for customers to read. She was grossed out as much as I was and said she would talk to management. Not an entirely pleasant breakfast experience at Egg Works.  My stomach is still churning from the obnoxious breakfast and the sound of the waitress screaming ""I need a runner here!"" is still in my head.

We ordered the waffle works (Belgium waffle, scrambled eggs, and choice of meat), loco moco (popular dish from Hawaii with steamed rice, hamburger patty, smothered in gravy and topped with eggs), and oatmeal w/ bowl of fruit and side of toast and avocado. 

Service was great! Despite that day being super busy, our waitress kept everything in top notch!

I brought my dogs here several times. The servers are always very friendly but not as attentive as they could be and lack attention to detail. I've experienced this with a few different servers. Such as never being checked back on after I get my food. Never. And me never having a napkin throughout my entire dining experience because  no one anticipated that I would need one initially, or checked on me until I was finished eating . Also leaving me there way too long to accept my money. I felt uncomfortable leaving money sitting on the patio, I eventually did.

I came here on a Monday with my husband as he loves breakfast. This little traditional looking diner looks promising. After we got seated and ordered water, our server did not come back until 10 minutes to take our order. We ordered 2 coffees, corn hash with English muffins,  and veggies skillet with English muffins. 

To start of with coffee, our pot never came after 15 minutes and even the table next to us that came later got their coffee pot. We tried to wave down our server, she didn't even looked at us and said in a bad attitude that there were only three of them and please bare with me. We would've understand and be OK with the delay if it wasn't her attitude. 

When our food arrived, they said will bring out my husband's English muffins in a bit. Of course,  it never came until we waved down our server 15 minutes later. She never came to check with us if the food were ok. It turns out, my husband's corn hash was too salty. She insisted my husband to order something else but at this point his appetite was ruined. She did bring out more English muffins to make up for it but it was kind of late.

My veggies skillet wasn't exactly in an iron skilet but a skillet shaped dish. I wish the menu had said something this dish is all raw veggies.  Other than potatoes on the bottom of the dish, the onions, bell peppers, mushrooms,  tomatoes,  and spinach were raw. I went light on cheese do everything was not cooked a bit. It was basic a salad with bedded potatoes and topped with bit of cheese and 2 eggs. I asked for over medium eggs but it came out over easy. I would at least want my onion and mushrooms cooked in some way.

When our bill came, we noticed the corn hash was taken off the check but added with ""a classic"". Then she explained to us the manager replaced the corn hash with the classic because the potato were eaten. When we pay our check at the front, the manager told my husband that she was under the impression the rest of eaten except the corn hash. She finally taken it off, and we left $0 tip.

It was one of the worse experiences I could have at an American restaurant.  I've never been to a place they take of the $11 food you didn't like but replace with a $8 dish that we did not had. They didn't have the most superb menu and I could have the same thing at a different place but with much better service. Never going back.

I really don't normally write such an extensive review but our experience here is way out of our expectations at a restaurant, in a horrible way.",dRxhUmXUxqgdzuPwiEuK0A,0,0,1,E4Sg58m6VSMKC87iaqX_gw

No matter what you're looking for or craving, this place will hit the spot. 

I got the Works Skillet and my coworker had the Works Omelette. My skillet was fantastic and, like I mentioned above, huge. The potatoes were hands-down the best part of the meal. My coworker liked his omelette and said the banana nut muffin was great as well

2861521,2011-10-31,3,PXShA3JZMXr2mEH3on5clw,"First off, I wouldn't consider myself the least bit an early-riser (well, not for breakfast anyways).  I was here at 6:30 in the morn, lacking sleep, and I am still able to recall the killer breakfast at this place.  I honestly didn't even know this Egg Works had a location on Sunset (even though it has been there forever), but I'm glad I stopped in.  I needed to make a stop to the airport and breakfast prior to doing so just seemed like a good idea.
I'll probably never see this place that early in the morning again though.

So being 6:30 in the am, I figured the place would be desolate, but I was taken by surprise when I entered and saw 3 other parties grubbing on some Egg Works offerings.  Okay, 3 parties isn't much, but seriously... it's 6:30!  That was a good indicator that this place means business.  After people-watching while waiting for my juice to be freshly squeezed from their orange tree that is growing within the walls of their kitchen (seriously it took a minute, but maybe I'm just not as patient during this hour), i noticed that the 3 other parties were regulars.  Regulars equals good service!    Our waitress was very helpful and even made mention of her picks on the menu.  I ended up going with the Haole Moco, which is an Americanized version of the ever-so-popular Hawaiian Loco Moco. Nice!

Pros:
* good portion sizes... I even had to take some to go
* okay so no Orange Tree in the kitchen to my knowledge, but it was fresh
* open early for you early-risers (or late sleepers).
* good service

Cons:
* service can be a bit slow at times due to small talk w/ regulars

Tips:
  They have this little flippy-thing that doubles as a salt/pepper shaker holder.  You can flip over to a different color, which indicates to the waitress that you are in need of assistance.  Pretty nifty.  I'll be honest, I just stared at it for a good minute or two, but since there were obstructions and I was entering the beginning stages of my food-coma, I said forget it and just waited for an opportunity to make eye-contact with the waitress to get the bill.  Seems pretty cool though. I'll try it next time I go and let you know if the waitress actually sees it in a timely manner.

  One more tip, look up and watch the news.  It's more informative than people-watching, but I can't say it's more fun.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,6,4,5,pOZ7Y1VBS2531PRZWfdHaw

Each table features a little egg that yellow on one side with a sad face or black on the other with a happy face. A sad egg and everyone stops what they are doing and jumps at the opportunity to fix the situation. Sometimes i flip the egg just see what will happen :) 

I prefer the omelets and sausage links. The coffee isn't the best so I say go with some juice or something else like that instead. I had the biscuits and gravy with some scrambled eggs and sausage patties. The patties were kinda dry which was a total shock. The potatoes that they serve are simply the best breakfast potatoes money can buy. Honestly thats what bumped them up to 4 stars from 3.

We ordered:
Country fried steak - My brother said the potatoes were a little too seasoned for his taste, but he still wiped his plate clean

Fresh Veggie Skillet - Got my eggs over easy so I could mix everything up. I got a banana nut muffin that came with the meal, but I just took a couple pinches of it because it didn't taste like banana nut at all. It tasted very plain and the appearance was a little strange. The bottom part was all small and the top was kind of flat with crispy edges. Imagine a small flap jack on top of a shot glass; that's what it looked like. I wish there were a little more veggies in the skillet besides the potatoes, which took up 75% of the skillet. The potatoes looked very seasoned, but they didn't taste overly salty or anything. All in all, it was okay, but I probably wouldn't order it again. I'll stick to an omelet next time because I know it'll have a lot more veggies. 

Loco Moco (American version) - This was the American version, I believe. The gravy looked like the same gravy that was on the country fried steak my brother got and it made the dish taste just like it too. The only difference was that the Country Fried steak was served with potatoes and this was served over rice. 

The Classic - Pretty basic meal, but my mom said it was good. I guess she assumed all of our meals were going to be pretty large so she could pick at them, which is the reason why she got that. 

Of course, my mom was right. All of our meals were pretty big, but not overwhelming. My brother cleaned his plate, my mom left one over easy egg, my boyfriend had a small cup of rice left, and I had some potatoes left. The bill came out to $47, but I had a bogo entree coupon from the 2011 Entertainment book with an $8 value. I don't think there was a single entree below $8, but they took the $8 out of our bill, so it turned out to be $39. That's a pretty good deal if you ask me!

I'll come back here again if I want breakfast before a flight. They have a big sign out front that says they're open 6am-3pm, so I guess they just do breakfast and lunch. The airport is just a few turns away from this place so you don't have to worry about being late if you get here a couple hours before your flight.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,2,2,3,okbgQYcWlHHYMaI-I4qRWw

2931804,2011-01-13,2,PXShA3JZMXr2mEH3on5clw,"[Review is solely for the awesome chili cheeseburger I chased down and captured here]:

When someone recommended Egg Works 2 as having one of the best cheeseburgers in town, I was dubious.  I mean, it's a breakfast place, right?  Who would ever order a burger when there are omelets and pancakes to be had?  But I went out on a limb and tried the Chili Cheeseburger that I was recommended.  Holy tastiness, Batman!  I almost licked the plate it was so good.

For those of you that haven't indulged in the sloppy mess that is the chili cheeseburger, let me tell you that the meal lives and dies on the quality of the chili.  Under the smothering tomato-meat sauce of a good chili, the burger patty becomes mere textural background.  But given the right chili--an amazing chili--that's not a bad thing.  

And Egg Works 2 rightly deserves praise for its chili--which is cooked Cincinnati style.  Cincinnati chili is a little different than what you're probably used to.  It's made with some unusual ingredients (cinnamon, cloves, allspice or chocolate) and you won't find many chili peppers or chili powder in the sauce.  I was a little skeptical when I found out about the lack of chilies, but it's good, really good.  The Cincinnati-specific spices make the chili so much richer that you really don't miss the heat.

Order it with the works and you'll get gooey cheese and onions that make the burger a sloppy, brilliant mess.  The chili spills over the burger when you pick it up.  You'll need like 45 napkins.  But you won't care.  

Man, it's a good burger.  I'd put it in the top 15 burgers in Vegas.  Why 15?  Well, I suspect there's nothing very interesting about the burger patty's taste under all that chili goodness.  But you won't even think of that while you're scooping every last bit of chili off the plate.",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,3,2,4,FQ_-2Ov-ZRtxqWRNSX_7Jg

The restaurant itself was freezing cold. And it never changed, temperature wise. They had two hostess' and the one we dealt with first didn't take or name because she said ""your first, I've got you in my mind."" Ok, sounds good.. it wasn't. She left and the other one returned and seated new people before us. The old one came back and was like ""OMG, I'm so sorry, your next."" Then the second one came back and seated someone else again!!! We finally got seated and all was ok. The food was ok. Not great, not bad EXCEPT for the pancakes, which were hard. Yuck. Now it's time to pay. We stood in line and in front of us was a man with a Chihuahua on a leash. Yes, inside the restaurant. He had been sitting near us and was there when we got there, finished, but just sitting on his phone. The dog was terrified, and freezing too. Anyhow, at the cash register this man was yanking and pulling the dog.. I said she looks very afraid. He says yes, she's overwhelmed. My husband leans down and let's her sniff his hand and then she practically jumps into his arms. He gives her a little scratch on her back and the man turns around and says Don't pet her, she's a service dog. We said ok. Then he got belligerant with us and said I've got the papers if you don't believe me!!! Then the cashier pipes in, and says you should never pet a dog unless you ask first! I then say, we own a pet sitting business, we are familiar with animals and the guy got even more rude. The whole situation was ridiculous. The dog did not have a service vest and was clearly not a service animal. Poor pup. We felt sorry for her. My issue is with the cashier, Lacey. She had no business giving her opinion or intervening. She was VERY rude and then became very condescerning when I complained about her behavior. So, if your looking for a good meal with a pleasant experience GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

There was 3 of us so we shared the blueberry stuffed french toast that was on special and the green chili omelet the waitress recommended. The omelet was a tad too salty. If you know me, then you know things can hardly be too salty for my taste but it just wasn't that good. The stuffed french toast however was great. The blueberries were plump and the syrup wasn't too sweet. Love the chewy consistency of the bread. Not gross like some over the top stuffed french toast but a well balance of sweetness, moistness and loveliness ( Yes, I'm still talking about food)The waitress was great since we were virgins to this place and was so very helpful.

My husband and I had a rare weekday off together and we decided to try this place out (finally!). It was a Thursday around 10am and while we didn't have to wait for a table, it was surprisingly busy. We were sat at a small table just off the bar area and our server, Austin, was outstanding. My husband told him it was our first time there and asked for suggestions and he immediately whizzed off to get us some complimentary banana muffins. Heaven in a muffin tin, people! And that damn butter! Grassland Dairy, where are you? Where can I find your butter for sale? So freaking good! I'll say it again-so. freaking. good. I need you Grassland butter! 
My husband opted for a breakfast skillet and I had the spinach eggs Benedict. Husband was super happy and his skillet was HUGE and had everything he wanted. Potatoes (more on those later but mmmmmm!), eggs, ham, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms and cheese (and really, I may be missing a few items cause there was just SO much packed into that thing!). It came with a side of toast and again, that BUTTER! 
My spinach eggs Benedict was...well, it was ok. The eggs were poached perfectly and the English muffins didn't get soggy, which is almost impossible with a bennie so mad props for that. I did take issue, however, with a couple of the main parts of the it. The ham was way too salty for my liking and the hollandaise sauce was, well, just ok.  It's not that it was bad, just kind of bland. The potatoes, however, were to die for. Chopped up into bite sized pieces and lightly seasoned. No need for ketchup or any dipping sauce with these spuds-they stood up deliciously by themselves. The orange juice (which they say is fresh squeezed) cost a mint. $2.95 a glass with no refills. Save some dough and forgo the OJ in place of something less expensive. 
The service was second to none. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was incredibly friendly and easy going. Our order was taken quickly and accurately and despite the restaurant being busy our meals came out pretty quickly. 
I recommend Eggworks to everyone at least once! It's easy to see why they're approaching a cult following status.",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,0,0,4,P-wZ6RijSbykci1enj2EIg

It took me a few months but I just recently went back and now I totally understand the hype! Great prices, good flavor and portions and many locations. 
I decided to go with the Chicken Fried Steak since I'm not an omelet fan and my boyfriend went with the Waffle Works. So I'm a little weird with scrambled eggs, I like them slightly undercooked if that makes sense. I always thought places made them so rubbery and dry but this place makes them perfectly the way I like them! Soft and fluffy but not watery or rubbery. Their seasoned potatoes were also pretty addictive and the gravy on the Chicken Fried Steak was seasoned perfectly and had the perfect texture. One thing that made me really happy, the breading didn't slide off the steak! Whoo! My boyfriend's waffle was also nice and sweet with soft chewiness and I liked that they offered sausage patties. We also both checked in on Yelp to get 1 free Banana Nut Muffin each!!! Awesome! So warm and flavorful! Our server was also great and had a good sense of humor, she made us laugh a few times. 
Overall, Egg Works doesn't offer any crazy menu items but simple can definitely be better if executed right. Also, there are soo many different options to choose from! Benedicts, Omelets, Pancakes, Waffles, Scrambles, Skillets, Sandwiches, Crepes, Salads, Soups, Burgers, even Enchiladas, Burritos, and Spaghetti!

The outside of the building appears as if it would be a poor quality restaurant inside but I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in.  The ambience was high energy (as a busy breakfast spot usually is).  I called in advance and put my name on the list and they seated me almost immediately.  

The service was excellent.  Wait staff was very prompt and friendly.  I ordered a breakfast burrito and my wife got steak and eggs (we always split our two meals).  Both dishes were amazing.  The steak was extremely tender and served with egg whites on the side (per our request).  The breakfast burrito was a 10/10, filled with eggs, peppers, bacon, and sausage.  

The most impressive part of eggs works was their home made salsa!  It was actually so good that I bought a jar upfront (very reasonably priced at 4 dollars.

2978958,2012-10-15,0,PXShA3JZMXr2mEH3on5clw,"I've been dining at egg works for a very long time now, at only this location. I'd say close to 10 times. I think it's time that I finally write a review of this place. Recently, my experiences at egg works have been very disappointing. I think one of the reasons is because of how big this company is getting. I believe it's falling into a classic company downfall where the company is sacrificing quality/consistency/customer satisfaction while expanding as a whole. 
My last experience will probably keep me from coming into this restaurant again. I don't eat pork, religiously. Neither does my girlfriend for personal reasons. Anyway, the last 4 times I've eaten here, we've found bacon/ham in our food. For me, it's come three times in my Chicken/mushroom/spinach skillet. And for my girl, its come once in her VEGGIE omelet. It happens once, maybe twice, no big deal. But it happening a total of 4 times is a little ridiculous. Yesterday, (10/14/2012), it happened again. I'm not the type of person who sends things back or gets fussy about things, so I informed my server, picked the ham out, and continued to eat my meal. (after the server asked to redo the dish, but who wants to sit and wait while everyone around them is eating) My girlfriend, who got the egg white veggie omelet, ate all around the edges of her omelet because the inside was so under done that it was mostly all liquid inside. We also got one of their pumpkin pancakes, but that also was underdone in the middle.  After all of the things that have gone wrong with this meal and informing our polite server about them (while we weren't assholes or fussy about our meal) we got no attention from the restaurant manager. I'm sorry, but you just served someone pork, someone who doesn't eat pork for religious reasons, and you don't apologize for your kitchens mistake? Nor apologize for the simple cooking mistakes made through out the entire meal? Naturally, nothing was taken off the bill. Not even a comp'd coffee. 
Now, I understand that a Sunday is very busy, but when a restaurant makes this many mistakes in turning out food, it maybe time to start looking towards upgrading the kitchen staff or increasing the amount of people in the back of the house. It seems that this restaurant, while makes a good breakfast, fails to execute in their dishes. It's frustrating because they're so miniscule, but they're simply overlooked at this restaurant.",sKiHN8YAavBvWC0DsT5UOw,1,0,2,ZOuc_sy9vjCojhciz2hU5A

We were greeted right away by Robert who was great to us. He was super friendly and very attentive which made our first time here an enjoyable one. 

We ordered two banana nut muffins (SAVE YOUR MUFFIN BECAUSE IF YOU EAT IT, YOU'LL BE TOO FULL FOR YOUR MAIN MEAL). The banana nut muffin was moist, but I would have preferred more nuts in mine. But it went very well with coffee. Btw, if you order coffee, they give you a whole container of it along with different flavored cream 
(If requested). I saw some French vanilla, Irish cream and caramel. 

We also got the strawberry cream cheese French toast, which I thought would be a stuffed French toast but it was more of strawberry cream cheese sandwiched between two pieces of bread with some strawberry jam/purée on top. It was too sweet for me so I didn't add any syrup. Nothing special, so I won't be ordering it again. Maybe if they changed the bread to a baguette it would be a lot better!

I was too full to try my sisters chili cheese omelette but the leftovers were really good! The omelette was just eggs and onions with chili in between and some cheese melted on top & sour cream. And they don't skimp out on the meat like most places. It came with their seasoned potatoes which were still nice and crispy after being refrigerated and your choice of toast or banana nut muffin. We got the white toast and they butter it for you.

After your meal you can pay in the front at the cashier near the entrance.

My first impression was not corporate at all very friendly and roomy. I'm a pretty big guy and never felt stuffed (no pun intended) . My server was Danielle aka. Dani, a gorgeous young lady with a bubbly personality and very knowledgeable about the food. We talked for a second I explained it was my first time here and right away she offered me a free banana nut muffin. Now my mom makes the best banana nut bread and for the first time in my 45 years of living I must confess. .. mom they got you on this one sorry.  I still love you though. So with the help of Dani we decided to go with center cut pork cops and eggs scrambled with pepper jack cheese and potatoes on the side with coffee and an English muffin.  Food came very quickly for such a busy place,  over all the food was great, however I am somewhat of a foodie so here's my critique. For a center cut pork chop it was a little on the thin side and for my personal taste a slight bit over seasoned. If you like meat for breakfast like I do,  i think their steak and eggs would be a more flavorful choice.  The eggs were cooked perfect and tasted amazing, and a big surprise was the house coffee ahhhh-mazzzzz-ingly deeeeeeeeeeeeeelicous. Over all i gave them a 4 start rating only because they don't have 4 and 1/2 star rating.  The half off was solely the seasoning for my personal taste.  After eating and thoroughly enjoying my breakfast Dani offered me a muffin to go (sorry mom I had to take it.) Overall food 4 1/2 stars, overall look and cleanliness 5 star and as far as service goes Dani knocked this one out of the park a perfect 10.  Thanks Dani for a wonderful breakfast experience.

The country potatoes were the size of petite green peas and were a pain to eat. The pancakes were small and didn't taste like anything.

dollop of sour cream. it was great. (order a side of salsa to make it more unique)

The skillet actually has the potatoes all on the bottom and then covers them with cheese, eggs, and other goodies depending on what you order. You definitely have to try one!!! The breakfast burrito is my bf's favorite. I'm not sure if I like it as much as him...but I'm always down for a breakfast burrito. I think it's the salsa that makes it really. 

We tried ordering the Cabo burrito...that was a BUST.. it's a wet burrito...too wet if you ask me..and it just lacked depth of flavor in my opinion. Won't be ordering that again.

Whoever thought of the concept of this place, from the decor to the food to everything else in the restaurant, is a bonafide genius! So thank you very very much. 

Decor: This is an extremely family oriented restaurant. With a large dining hall with silly pictures that features eggs (example: egg-faced Mona Lisa), it's really inviting to people of all ages. The menu looks like a newspaper with cute little cartoons all over. 

Service: I don't know if all the servers are required to have their morning coffee, but all of them are so perky! There's an black egg you can flip over to a yellow egg - this indicates that your table needs something. When this happens, any one of the Egg Works staff will come over and will ask what you need. What a great idea! This prevents from you staring awkwardly all over the restaurant for your server. Your server will bring your check over to your table but won't be your cashier. So after you're done with your meal, you have to go up to the front to pay. I don't mind this unless there's a huge line in the front at peak times. Then I get a little annoyed, but I guess I have to deal with it.

Food: YUM. Most of their dishes come with their ""Works"" potatoes. Perfectly cubed and perfectly seasoned! I can seriously have a plateful of just their potatoes. You can opt out of that for some fruit or cottage cheese. I've tried many of their dishes and was never disappointed. My favorites are listed below: 

- Works Veggie Benny: Calling all vegetarians! An English muffin topped with fresh spinach, tomatoes, huge chunks of avocado, two poached eggs and drizzled in hollandaise sauce. This is my favorite item on their menu hands down. 
- Vegetarian Crepe: Calling all vegetarians, again! A hefty serving of guac, mushrooms, spinach and Swiss cheese. The Works poppy seed dressing is tangy and sweet, the ultimate dipping sauce to this dish.
** I am NOT a vegetarian by no means, but the two above are DELICIOUS! **

- Greek Scramble: Chicken, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, spinach and feta cheese. OPA! in my mouth. For real. 
-Blackened Prime Rib Benny: This is my boyfriend's favorite dish there. And I quote, ""What cow danced and left a mess in my mouth?!"". Prime rib lovers, this is for you. 

Pro tip: Portions are huge here. For a lower price, you can get half portions for most of the items on the menu. So for those on a diet, you can still enjoy the succulent flavors of Egg Works!",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,3,1,5,QfV0f1_lIVHgo9vMG6KkUQ

You know this place sells alot of egg dishes when the delivery truck delivers eggs by the stacked case - and many of them.

You can get your egg dishes just about any way you like them and know that you'll have a good experience. I tend to favorite the California Omelet which has tomato, fresh avocado and mushrooms, along with melted Swiss and hollandaise sauce. The omelet alone is more than enough at 3 eggs, but they include some great potatoes (or another side) and a banana nut muffin which is usually good, but this time tasted a tad off. I didn't mind the muffin, but my kids didn't enjoy them as much this time.

Their service style is interesting - flip your metallic ""egg"" at the table if you're unhappy to get someone's attention. Neat concept!

Warning - portions are LARGE. If you're traveling, you'll likely feel like you're wasting food unless you choose to share (they may charge for that, but it's not excessive). After the muffins, I could only eat ""most of the omelet and a small bit of potatoes before feeling stuffed.",B1XESr4SF3In0IKRXLWJLw,0,0,4,uK5wC0y1VbeDPYGWw-kowA

We had a few minor problems on our last few visits and decided to, as politely as we could, mention them to the manager. We spoke to two managers who were both excellent listeners and genuinely interested in our input. They both offered, pretty much demanded, to pay our bill and gave us a loaf of their delicious banana bread to go. It was a very pleasant conversation and was refreshing to hear both managers genuinely concerned about us having a great experience there and we will continue to make Egg Works one of our favorite ""go to"" breakfast spots.",uc5SI7_91nonDnujTB7tug,0,0,4,sFM2Ce3SXpNJ6Dp9e5kTug

We stopped here before going to hike Red Rock, and for a pre-hike breakfast, this was definitely more than enough. 

Food: I had the veggie skillet and another friend had the croissant breakfast sandwich. Both came with potatoes, which were a little dry. Veggie skillet is really big - could be breakfast enough for two people - and super filling, mostly because you get so many potatoes. The croissant bfast sandwich was also huge. But it's not a gourmet brunch by any means, and because the potatoes are dry, I'd say it's a little below typical diner breakfasts at a similar or a bit higher price point. My free banana nut muffin with check-in was so incredibly moist, it was amazing. Unlimited coffee refills!

 Sometimes I go with the breakfast tostada which is a giant flour tortilla baked into the shape of a bowl the filled with beans their signature potatoes scrambled eggs and taco meat topped with tons of cheese salsa and sour cream f**k that's delicious.

Who would have known that a Breakfast could be so Good!!!

First of all I had my doubts about this place.  It is on the Corner of Sunset and Eastern in a business complex that seems empty most of the time.  I don't even look in that direction when driving down sunset.  But when you walk up to the restaurant and see a sea of people waiting to be seated, you know that something must be going right.  Yet our wait at the back of 15 people only took about 15 - 20 minutes...crazy.  Once seated you can usually judge the entire visit by how fast you are asked for your drink order.  3 minutes (yes I usually time it) is all it took for a very friendly person to ask and another 3 minutes to have my coffee and orange juice delivered in front of me.  

I ended up ordering the Carnitas (which was recommended by our server) which was incredible.  Pricing wasn't cheap (I think the Carnitas was about $11 and coffee $2.50) but is definetely worth it for the portion and flavor.  

Honestly I have to give this place 5 stars which normally never happens.  I usually pick apart an establishment because I truly believe in Great Customer Service when dining out.  Food, though extremely important, comes second.
Egg Works was extremely busy with people buzzing in and out and our server never skipped a beat.  There was such a smooth flow to all the craziness that you don't see anywhere.  

If you are looking for somewhere great to eat, with great food, and awesome service....You have to stop by and Try this place.

And most breakfast plates come with the option if you don't want ordinary toast. Not hating on toast-- I love me some rye swirl so warm it melts butter! And a dab of raspberry jam if it's wheat.

Overwhelming newspaper menu similar to Black Bear Diner. Cute. So many options! I noticed a trend with some fillings, just a different type of food. I got ""the Works"" skillet breakfast which is ham, bacon, sausage, mushroom, onion, diced tomato, green bell peppers, cheddar, 2 eggs all over Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. You can order the Works for just about anything, including omelets, scramble, etc. Cheesy goodness! My over medium eggs looked great and burst at the yoke with a single poke, oozing all over the squared potatoes down below. I'll admit my dish was a tad bit saltier than my preference, but it's probably from the seasoning.

The friend (the birthday girl!) and her family ordered waffles, corn beef hash, veggie crepes that look like omelets upon first glance, omelets and banana nut muffins all around, with an order of toast. Large portions, lower prices! Apparently there's a Groupon deal right now and that's how my friend's dad discovered this place.

There's something for everyone! Pancakes, waffles, French toast, omelets, scrambles, crepes, hashes, etc. I also saw mimosas on the menu for the early drinkers. 

Sunday morning was busy but we snagged a 6 seater. Friendly, comfortable, homey environment! Staff is so nice! Troy took drink orders, poured coffee for everyone, and even asked if I'd like whipped cream on my hot chocolate or not. Maybe lots of folks would rather skip the calories? We're in Vegas!

Today happen to be Father's Day and my Dad decided to check this place out. We went and of course not only is it a Sunday morning but it's a Sunday Morning on Father's Day. The line was insane! I was worried because I only had 1.5 hours before I had to go into work. As soon as I saw the line my first though was ""This place better be worth it"" and "" I better be seated fast"". Once we reached the receptionist my name was at the bottom of the list to be called but they were constantly calling people to be seated and it only took max 10 minutes to be seated. I was highly impressed. I have never gotten faster service than I have at this place. We were seated at a booth that was a little snug for my family but it was still comfortable enough to eat in. I was surprised that the receptionist kept checking up on us to make sure that we were comfortable and even offered to give us a different table which was completely unnecessary. It was nice to have that sense that everyone in the restaurant wanted to make sure you were happy with not only your meal but the experience as well. 
I ordered the Ruben sandwich which might not be the best breakfast choice but I thought it was delicious.  My parents tried the tostadas and they were HUGE and could probably feed two. Their chocolate chip pancakes were also really tasty. I am not a real big fan of breakfast food in general but after trying this place I definitely will reconsider my lack of appreciation for breakfast food.

3732129,2013-09-23,0,PXShA3JZMXr2mEH3on5clw,"Stopped by while in Vegas since I had a groupon for this place. The boyfriend got a ""4 way"" Cincinnati Chili while I had a Hawaiian platter breakfast (2 eggs, sunny side up, Portuguese sausage, 2 scoops of rice, 2 slices of toast, and 1 slice of pineapple). We shared everything - and we also had some spam.

Service was a little slow, but this place seems to get packed rather quickly, so if you go before  9:30AM, it might be a little better. When we got there, there weren't a ton of people, but by the time we sat down and ordered, the crowd started to pour in.

They have a ""paging"" system much like that of Bubba Gump or other restaurants. Black side of the egg has a happy face on it, denoting that you're OK and do not need assistance. The yellow sad face catches the waiter/waitress' attention and they stop to help you with whatever you may need. Waitresses were very courteous, however, down to the point. Who can blame them though? It got rather busy quickly. No small talk or anything like that, just straight to the point. Not a bad thing, just an observation of what I noticed. 

Cincinnati chili, as my boyfriend described it, was ""not Skyline, but can pass as Cincinnati chili. More like Dixie chili."" Not as watery as Skyline, a bit more flavorful in my opinion (more spices in it). Not as cheesy as Skyline though.

The Hawaiian breakfast platter of course, was good. Well, to be fair, it really is hard to mess up on sunny side up eggs so I'll skip that. They tasted like eggs. The sour dough toast, well, it was sour dough toast - so I'll skip that as well. Not sure what else to write about since everything else on that plate tasted as it should have. I've never quite had an ""exceptional"" quality Hawaiian breakfast, so... The spam was just spam that was pan fried, no teriyaki sauce marinade. I guess the fact that it tastes like what it's supposed to and looks the way it is supposed to is a plus though. Food tasting like anything other than what it is sometimes odd and could be a bad thing. 

I did not get a chance to have their omelets or egg crepes, but I will definitely be back to try again another time. A nice little gem a bit off of the strip. They also have several locations in Vegas area as well.",EymOfA14fId9lm9IrbHgzg,0,0,4,5i50Ey_fey60NDsDu5PYBw

With some recommendations from a friend who is a local from the Las Vegas area, this place is very highly recommended. And for myself, I would recommend and will definitely return when I am back in the area.

We got here way early before the morning rush, about 7 am. Easily found park and got seated in no time. It is very homey inside, with dining tables and a breakfast bar with additional seating. Our servers were very attentive, making sure we had everything we needed.

For those who love coffee (like me), their coffee is unlimited!! Yes that's right, they even give you the entire mug of coffee pourer to have at your table. And if you like flavored coffee, they have small creamers available at the table too. 

For food, I got the veggie Benedict with their homemade potatoes. The veggies on top of the english muffin were avocados, tomatoes, and spinach. Everyone tasted too good! My favorite were probably their homemade potatoes. It had a cajun taste and it was not oily or soggy at all, unlike most homestyle potatoes.

The huge plate of biscuits and gravy was too huge and the pale gravy looked gross. How sorry would I have been if I didn't dig into those biscuits and gravy. That food was DELICIOUS! and I don't usually do gravy. Oh and I also had scrambled eggs. I've never not been able to eat an order of scrambled eggs before. But I couldn't eat what seemed to be a dozen scrambled eggs. They were perfectly scrambled and so beautifully textured -- not hard and dry but moist and solid. The Old Bay seasoned hash browns deliciously completed the trinity.

I'm a cheerful person and greeted this guy with a smile seriously happy with the service I had received in Henderson only to be disappointed by this Robert and his lack of courtesy. 
We were not greeted but rather given a blank stare and rudely asked ""do you know what you want to order"" not welcoming at all. These type of people really upset me I mean how hard is it to give someone a smile and extend the same courtesy that's been given to you. This was my second visit to an Egg Works and will stay away from this location. I'm one that doesn't complain to management but rather one that values my money and simply does not return. I hope this review is considered as a coaching opportunity for this guy. The service I received was horrible. His negative demeanor and the unpleasant look on his face was disappointing he simply did not want to be there. Food and service do not go hand in hand.

My lettuce was wilted, turning pink at the edges and had some brown spots. I asked them to take it back and the waitress kindly brought me more muffins on the house. 

Why would an establishment ever serve salads that obviously are closer to rotting than being fresh. 

Henderson, I give up on ordering salads from any of your restaurants. And Egg works, you're on my list of restaurants who rather plate any kind of food than plate quality ingredients and cross fingers that I'll just stuff my face without looking. 

5 stars for the muffins though. I'll come back for those and when I'm hungry for breakfast food.

They cooked everything with seasoning salt andthen doused everything with seasoning salt, including the potatoes and hollandaise sauce, once it's on the plates.  I thought it was just my food but I looked at other people's plates around me and they had the same thing going on. 
This place uses a ton of seasoning salt so I do not recommend you eat here if you have an intolerance for salt, or if you have already met your salt intake limit for the next 3 months.
Also, I ordered the blackened prime rib.  It is not a blackened slice of prime rib.  It is chopped up leftover meat that is completely saturated in... you guessed right! Seasoning salt.

There were definitely some good things and I give one star for each of them: the atmosphere was very upbeat and fun. The place is clean and the decorations are appealing.  The staff was super awesome, too. Very friendly, attentive and fast.

I hope the next time I'm in Vegas I will have time to give This place a second chance on the food. But next time around, I will be sure to ask for 'no salt'.",Y1pnMbZT_MbpAaQzpuygQQ,2,0,3,gQPEv8td42JLuEA7aRSdkw

How have we never been to Egg Works before now??

We literally live right down the street and we drive by this location almost every single day. I'm honestly ashamed of myself.

Now I have seen this place on a weekend and it is crazy packed! But, being a Tuesday mid morning we were seated right away and it had a decent flow of customers.

Maya (our wonderful server) came and greeted us right away. One of the things that stood out to me the most about our entire experience is that everyone working there seemed genuinely happy to be at work. Everyone was bubbly and all smiles and it definitely made for a great dining experience!

The hubby ordered the Chile Relleno Omelet and I had what I would describe as being their personal take on Biscuits and Gravy.

Everything was delicious! We especially loved their potatoes, they had a wonderful seasoning with a light kick!

What you get here is pretty much what you get at the Egg and I (their other breakfast joint), Cracked Egg, and if you're in SoCal, Broken Yolk.  Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and when it comes this meal, I tend to keep it simple...just an omelet and some carbs. On my most recent visit, I had brunch with a couple of friends.  And for my meal, I had a 6 egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms.  It was high carb day, so I had a bowl of oatmeal added to my meal.  The food is consistent and for egg whites, very tasty.  Oh yeah, I also had some turkey bacon that actually taste like real bacon.  

As for their service, I'd give them 4 stars.  Keep in mind that this is one crazy busy Egg Works on the weekends.  This visit was mid-day and mid-week.  In other words, we were seated right away, got our food right away, and was out of here fairly quick.  Overall, you can't go wrong for breakfast at Egg Works, especially if it's consistency that you're striving for.

""Egg Works"" sure why not everybody talks this place up so ill give it a whirl. I walked in asked the hostess if i could place a to go order, she said go back there and just kinda pointed toward the rear of the place, walking back there a tiny waitress made eye contact and i thought great somebody to help me when i asked about a to go order she ignored me and walk away, i got to the back counter where i was surrounded by 4 additional waitresses when i mentioned a to go order i again was ignored.... really? It wasnt till a few minutes later yet another waitress came by to take my order as i was lost till then... why couldnt somebody be just slightly friendly. 

I asked the waitress about the salads and just had her pick her favorite, ""The Cobb"" is what she came up with and served it with balsamic which i was fine with. Even came with the famed muffin on the side which was tasty as 5hit, and even still warm. My salad was to say the least HUGE, i felt like Adam from man versus food and food lost because i have to share the salad with a co worker to finish it. Chunks of turkey, ham, bacon, egg, avocado, etc, etc it was well put together and fresh. At $10 for the salad and muffin its not too bad as it really serves two people.

OK, so after the fiasco at the Egg & I in Webster, TX,  (see my review ""Egg & I in Webster, TX., Proves Disappointing"") we couldn't wait to get back to our usual Egg Works (part of the Egg & I chain in Vegas) in our hometown of Vegas.  We bee lined there yesterday (11/30/13), and here's what we found.

Usual fabulous service?  Check.   Usual tasty meals?  Check, check.  Usual fast, efficient and jovial staff?  Check.  Usual two-for-one coupon?  Check.

Manager Sherie and server Raul did a fine job, as is typical of all the staff at this location.  This place is The Gold Standard in the Egg & I franchise, and should be emulated by the entire franchise chain across the US.

NOTE:  The Egg & I in Webster, TX, is owned by a totally different franchisee, hence the vast difference in quality between the Houston locations and the Egg & I/Egg Works chain in Vegas.

This time I eschewed my usual Huevos Rancheros and chose the Taco Scramble, something I had never tried.  It was fabulous!  I ordered some warm flour tortillas on the side, slathered them with butter, and made a series of mini-burritos.  Yuuuummm!  I ended up bringing about half of the dish home (their portions are ample) for breakfast this morning.  Double Yuuummmm!

As we left the restaurant yesterday there was a line outside and we ended up chatting with a couple from out of town, on their first visit there.  We gave them one of our remaining two-for-one coupons to use, and wished them a fine day.

I knew they were in for a treat, and so will you be when you get there.

4085916,2016-05-19,2,PXShA3JZMXr2mEH3on5clw,"EAT HERE FOR THEIR POTATOES. Potatoes are good enough to keep you coming back. Service is kept in check with their happy egg / sad egg system. Need something? Flip your egg to sad and they'll quickly assist you.

The Menu? GIANT. I love how the menu is like a newspaper. Never did trying to figure out what to eat look so intellectual.

My preferred food: Most of the Mexican food is tasty. My favorite right now is the Mexican Omelette that includes green chilies / chorizo / jalepenos and served with seasoned potatoes. That was the bee's knees. Ol standby is Huevos Rancheros, which is also very good. Or just get a mound of potatoes. Yeah, they are pretty freaking good. Pork Carnitas Burrito has some decent heat, meat is a little too drippy though, but not a bad decision.

A few things to remember:

This is a breakfast place. A casual breakfast place. Stick to casual breakfast foods. The Mexican dishes are generally pretty good. The omelettes are the heavy hitters. Once you wander off the reservation, that's when you get disappointed. 

One example: The Crazy Chicken omelette is gross. The description states a julienned chicken breast but it was more like salty cubes of chicken. The other ingredients (mushrooms / guacamole / muenster cheese / sour cream) do NOT mesh together. You get a gloopy mess at the end. Anything that offers upscale meat (prime rib) you should be weary of. Stick to traditional breakfast foods.

And if the food you ordered isn't great, they still come with potatoes most of the time. It's always the positive.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,2,3,4,CUkM0WgXyFMIYWFgjRCc_Q

We were greeted and quickly seated right as we entered the doors. Unfortunately, I sat there for a good 10 minutes just for the waiter to come and take my orders for drinks. Alongside with this, it is not busy at all. I don't understand why it took them this long to come and take my order for some water. We flipped the egg to a sad face and finally, someone who was NOT the waiter at my area, came and got us water. Our waiter didn't come until 15 minutes later after being seated. I was very disappointed already. Afterwards, she took our orders(didn't introduce herself at all) and doesn't even come back with the food. Someone else came and brought us our food(which keep in mind, took forever). I ordered the NY steak again and this time, I thought it was going to be a lot better. I ordered medium rare so I was hoping the cook was right this time. However, we didn't get to eat until 6 minutes later. We both kept raising our hands and our waiter looked at us, then looked away. Is she purposely ignoring us or something? She went up to the table near us and brought them a bottle of ketchup and I called for her...still no response. Her name is Brandy by the way. The person who noticed us was Fernando and he was the table cleaner. He was the only one who helped and asked if we needed anything else. He also brought us the A1 sauce. Big shout out to Fernando, their table cleaner. I feel like they are not credited enough since they've done more than the waitress/waiters have had. We began eating and everything was good. My sunny side up eggs were delicious and the toast was the best. But then I got to the steak and was fairly disappointed AGAIN!!! The steak was SO DRY. I took a picture and you can see how there is no juice whatsoever. It's just oily and dry. Big disappointment and VERY upsetting. My boyfriend ordered the Steak benny this time. ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT!!! After he broke open the egg, it turns out they were undercooked. White liquid gushed out of the eggs. That means the whites of the eggs were not even cooked. It would be okay if they were cloudy but you can clearly see they were just clear. Now we question why this place is top rated when they can't even cook their eggs properly. We understand bennies need to be partially raw. But this was just really pure raw. I have pictures for proof. Just look at them...After the food, we complained to the waitress and she didn't really seem to caring. In fact, she was trying to back herself up saying things like how shes busy with the new chefs in training so she wasn't able to cater us much. Also said something like how she came back twice...but she only came back twice after I gave her the bitch face since i was sitting there for 20 minutes not being able to eat.  THERE WASN'T EVEN MANY PEOPLE THERE!!! It was like less than 7 tables being used!
We told her how we most likely won't be coming back and she says: ""Sounds good!"" 
Wow. I am astounded by the customer service here. I mean, at least this time the cashier wasn't a total bitch. I'm not coming back. It's just too disappointing since I actually enjoy eating at egg and I on Sahara and Eggworks on Fortapache.",cG7-mlCp_cV8gfRC_9LW-Q,2,0,1,dvYWIjKaKAaKQoevecbruQ

Being a homemade corn beef fan, I opted for this entree and when it arrived the size was overwhelming large like most of the entrees here. The corn beef was unfortunately overly salty and inedible so I only ate part of my scrambled eggs. When the waitress came by to check on us, I mentioned how bad my corn beef was and she asked if I wanted anything else which I declined. When our waitress returned she advised me she advised the chef and removed my entree from the bill which was a nice gesture. Everybody else in our party seemed to be happy with their food.

TV's are all around (but not overdone) which is great to wake up on a Saturday and start watching some sports - loved it.

The menu was cute and fun - not to mention a great selection

My wife had the jeuvos rancheros which were good.
I had the chili (which was OK - probably out of a can though) and onion rings.  Now the onion rings were obviously the frozen type - but just so tasteless and meaningless that you wonder why they even bother to put it on their menu.  All the other food looks so appetizing, then you have these crappy onion rings.  They would be better off to upgrade them or take them off the menu.
I wish that I would have stuck to egg-based menu items...

The service was excellent, and everyone was very nice.  

Oh yea, and the wifi (while free) did not work (strong signal, just wouldn't put you online after connecting).",8hJ949sOMuwc4rh3Q9MySQ,0,0,3,tFHUWgrsCq0ckttR30wqVw

We were seated at a two-top in the back next to the counter seating. We ordered quickly, and received our food quickly as well. We ordered the Bandito Scramble. This included chorizo, jalapenos, cilantro, cheddar, diced green chilies and a side of 'habla diablo original salsa', topped with sour cream. This also came with seasoned potatoes and we chose the banana muffin over the toast.

The scramble was pretty tasty. It was not spicy at all, and the combination of the salsa and sour cream made it even better. The salsa was nothing special. It was more like a picante sauce, very mild and not chunky. The seasoned potatoes were alright, but seasoned way too heavily. They were red from all of the seasoning. My guess is that it was Lawry's seasoned salt.  I would have preferred a lot less of this on the potatoes.

4186829,2018-04-14,18,PXShA3JZMXr2mEH3on5clw,"Alright.... alright.... alright!!!!!! Crazy to say but this is my first review of 2018. Yes, I've been slacking BUT...... I'm on the constant grind and sometimes Yelp has to take a backseat but I still got love for you. Now let's get into this review. 

Stopped in here on a Sunday morning in between sessions of a conference I was attending. Now.... it being Vegas... and breakfast time.... and Sunday... we knew it would be crowded but the wait wasn't that bad. It took about 20-25 minutes to be seated for two. I'm calling that a win in my book.

Now, the one smidge I would say is that it took maybe 7 minutes or so for initial contact but the manger came by to check on us so it was all good. (I chalk that up to being as crowded as I stated, but not so bad that we wanted to leave. My friend and I were talking and looking at the massive menu anyway). 

The place definitely has a down home feel to it with farm murals on the walls. Diner style seating and regular tables. 

Now I won't get into the depths of the menu but... think of pretty much any breakfast item and they have it... including crepes (yes crepes and yes the French ones lol. Don't get me started on that smh). But the menu is large and in charge. 

I personally went with ""The Works"" omelette with potatoes (legit) and wheat toast with a banana nut muffin (YELP CHECK IN ITEM). My friend went with steak and eggs. I partially wanted to strangle her because she ordered her steak well done.... but.... I remember where I was when I first started eating steak. I didn't grow up in a Household that ordered it any other way. So it took time to work my way to a medium rare. So I partially forgive but partially don't lol. She seemed to enjoy it. And we shared French toast which was divine... soft, fluffy, moist with hot syrup. Man... my mouth waters for that. Service was solid after initial wait. Overall we had a nice experience, even on a crowded Sunday.

This place is definitely on my list to visit again next time I'm in town... which will be October. #FrenchToastGang",wf4Vyv8gEbSWsKta_8g6cg,19,18,5,Dkr7_VZLefCuqQV_dZdcMg

Starving and ready for some pancakes, a good sign of a great restaurant is a: full parking lot and a timely wait. We experienced both, what makes out better is that we're waiting to be seated and droves of people are still coming in to get a place in line.

Unfortunately we waited 45mins, I almost gave then a 3star rating for that alone but they redeemed themselves by giving our entire party of 9 muffins (free charge) before the even handed us our menus.

Service fast, customer service (GOOD) especially RACE DAY.  Egg Works got hit w/ a double dose of racers that day (BadAss Dash @ Southpoint and the COLOR RUN in henderson) and yes we all got in our cars for good pancakes.

I don't like to go against the grain when dealing w/ pancake establishments, I go for old faithful: FlapJacks, sausage and egg...hashbrown if i'm super hungry.  Food came to the table steaming hot.  

BUTTERMILKE PANCAKES: nice and fluffy, kind of like an AIR fluffiness and BIG.  No sour after taste from the buttermilk, actually I could've ate the pancakes w/o the syrup.   Really though, who eats pancakes w/o syrup???? SHENANIGANS ok back to the air quality pancakes, the pancakes soak up the syrup UM YEA - DELICIOUS

EGGS and SAUSAGE: no big wow factor here, eggs NOT runny, good color, fluffy. (ok so i cannot stop using the word FLUFFY to describe this food) but the eggs WERE FLUFFY! ;-)  just a regular sausage pattie.

If I find myself on this side of town again around breakfast time, then I will definitely drop in for some PANCAKES.

4298135,2018-03-12,0,PXShA3JZMXr2mEH3on5clw,"I have waited until I've had three bad experiences at this location, and yesterday was it.
We went on Sunday for my partner's birthday, and waited 30 mins for a table outside, although there was only one other couple on the outdoor patio at the time (8 tables outside). 

When we were seated, another 10 mins before a waitress asked for our drink order. That took another 20 minutes for coffee to arrive (without cream/sugar). 

When we ordered our drinks, we shared our fabulous YELP checkin bonus of a free muffin. When the coffee and orange juices came out, there was no muffin. We reminded the waitress of the muffins, and she came back with one of the two muffins, and no butter, about 13 mins after we reminded her (yes, we'd started a clock at this point).  We reminded her we had two checkin muffins, so she went for the other muffin. 
17 minutes after that (now we're 1 hour, 17 minutes into our visit), she brings out the other muffin and wants to take our order.

We explained we just wanted the bill, and we'd go to a different Eggworks.  We waited 7 minutes for the bill to arrive and then deposited $5 on the table and left. The manager followed us out to the parking lot and offered us a coupon for ""Buy one, get half-off the second meal."" 

This particular location has been nose-diving since November of 2017; I doubt we'll ever return. This location went through a period last fall where the potatos were drowning in heavy spice and other condiments, to the explanation of ""Our owner likes it spicy, so he insists we deliver it that way."" odd that other locations weren't like that. The location on Eastern is much, much better, the staff is better, parking is harder, but we've never had ridiculous waits, never had bad service, and always very much enjoyed the experience there. 30 mins further from our home, but well worth the extra drive on a Sunday morning where relaxation is the goal.",C2b35VOxP2LhqEn90f1lyA,0,0,2,u9sdi31xxoMK4r_Qo1Y9Bg

The actual menu is huge. They have everything from unique scrambles to pancakes to benedicts. The muffins they bring before the meal are both delicious and moist.

I ended up getting the Country Style Eggs Benedict. It comes with 2 biscuits, sausage patty, smothered with country gravy, and topped with 2 eggs cooked to your liking and a side of Works potatoes, a slice of grapefruit and pineapple. 
- the country gravy was a little too salty for my taste, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. The potatoes were cooked perfectly, nice and crispy with a touch of paprika. 

I also got to try the Stuffed French Toast. This was AHH-MAYZING! Gooey cheese, egg, and sausage sandwiched between two pieces of French toast. Drizzle the maple syrup on top, and voila! Thee perfect breakfast! It also comes with a side of Works potatoes. I'll be back for this next time.

The only way I knew that it wasn't,  was because the pancakes were very tough to cut. My only assumption is that the batter is already pre made throughout the entire day and thus the gluten is already activated and hardened. I believe the goal to a good pancake is to NOT premake the batter and just make a fresh new batter for every pancakes order requested.",zLJP_lHYU8cXs5ktzAmJDw,0,0,4,9BJ2YiHfYhR9pHiV5qzIvg

Brad must be a big deal and the menu is huge so Brad, consider a ""Brad's with bacon"" it was out of this world.  We shared a warm, fresh, banana nut muffin that was on the house from the relationship with Yelp.  It was incredible too!  
Most important though.  The service.  The young people who greet you are exceptional.  Our server Chris awesome.  From the minute you walk in and they greet you at the foot snd seat you, to being seated, to being served it feels like family.  And is a great marketing engine for the good people of Las Vegas!  Great job guys!  
This is not a fancy place. It is practical.  If I didn't know you t was a chain I would have sworn it was a stand alone family restaurant which it must be yet they have preserved that personal touch as they have expanded.  I am from out of tow, great personal Vegas experience.  Wonderful way to start your day off strip or before catching a flight out early off strip.

The portions are generous and you get your money's worth. The fresh veggie omelette was good and was glad they offered egg white options as well. Along with this came seasoned potatoes and choice of bread (white, wheat, rye, etc...). The potatoes were magical; within a few bites I forgot I was supposed to limit my carb intake in the first place. The French toast is legit and I would be happy to order another plate. 

However, I can't say the same for the pancakes which caused some Aunt Jemima-preservative-box variety déjà vu: disappointingly dry, flavorless, and let me feeling like a bloated cow. Unfortunately, frugality overcame me and I tried to eat as much as I could and would later regret this decision. Décor is your standard diner than can be seen in New York to Pahrump. Oddly, giant stuffed animals have taken over part of the waiting area. I'm not sure if these dirty, dust filled monstrosities have a purpose other than to entertain inpatient children, but they need to go. Service throughout was great.

Egg Works is a chain of breakfast joints located throughout Vegas, off strip. 

This location is located by the airport. Open for breakfast and lunch only. 

Typical old school breakfast joint decor. Very crowded all the time. Service was friendly and fast. Portions are huge and filling. 

Yelp Check in gets you a free Banana Nut Muffin.

Spinach Benny - $10.99 - Eggs were poached well. Yolk was runny and gooey. Typical benny with spinach for freshness. I got the hollandaise on the side. Our server gave me both to try, traditional and chipotle. I liked the chipotle since it had a nice kick to it. Comes with home style potatoes, cooked and seasoned well. 

Breakfast Tostada - $11.50 - I got the chicken version with tomatillo salsa. The tostada is loaded with eggs, cheese, potatoes, and beans. Good for the first few bites but then the taste gets boring. Huge portion.
 
Banana Nut Muffin - $1.95 - Deep deep molasses flavor. Moist and tender muffin. Did not taste much banana flavor. And it did not have many pieces of nuts.",d8KR5c1ievS0C53h4fhEeQ,1,1,4,nPps7a6xbVFS81A6fykY2Q

Service wise we were always seated right away. Waiter was always attentive to us. The first time  we got there, our server noticed I was checking in on yelp and she got me the banana nut muffin with out me asking.

Food: They give a lot of food. Whatever I ordered I could never finish. I love that they have lighter options that you can sub out instead of potatoes. 
Most of their breakfast meal come with toast or the banana nut muffin. GET THE MUFFFIN. Seriously, it's good. They bring it out nice a warm and you can put like a slice of butter and it will melt at make it ok so yummy. In all honesty though it doesn't even need the extra butter because it nice a smooth.

The first day I got one of their skillet dishes. It had spinach and chicken with eggs (preparers the way you like it), all over the diablo potatoes. I liked how the potatoes were seasoned. It had a nice kick of spice to it. But if your looking for more spice you can add more of their diablo sauce. I couldn't finish it because I was too full halfway through the meal.
 
Second day, I was really craving smoothing lighter do I got the breakfast parfait and a small stack of banana pancakes. Again it came with the muffin. This time the muffin was a bit of and edge like it was left in the oven just a tad bit longer, I'm one of those people who fight the the edge piece in brownies-it gave it the little extra bit of texture that I love. I guess I didn't learn from the first time, they came with huge portions. The parfait had mandarin oranges, strawberries, blueberries, and bananas layer in between the granola and yogurt. Banana pancakes was loaded with bananas. It was sweet enough so no need for syrup.

By the third day I was craving some local Hawai'i food. And lo and behold they have some Hawai'i favorites. I saw the loco moco but I really wanted some country gravy. No problem they have a play on the loco moco called the Haole Moco. It was yummy. By far my favorite breakfast item. The country gravy really went well with the hamburger. The mushrooms  also added to the flavor. Makes me wish we have the haole moco back Home.

The main orders also came with a banana nut muffin that the BF really liked. His country fried steak was much better than mine, and I think that was partly because the salsa didn't taste fresh (I envisioned something along the lines of pico de gallo, I don't know why) while his gravy was sooo good. So that would be my recommendation. The chili was fantastic too. We ended up taking half of each skillet, plus almost 3/4 of the chili home. And I swear we were hungry to begin with!

Us girls were being obnoxious drunk bitches at 11am when we stepped into the restaurant, yet our lovely server treated us with much friendliness, even sitting herself at our table as we chit-chatted our way into placing our orders. 

With her recommendation, I tried the corned beef hash with two eggs over easy. According to my memory under the influence, that corned beef hash was the best that I have ever had. With ample home-cured corned beef and perfectly cooked taters and eggs, I soon was under the spell of food coma.

After picking up our pup from a doggy hotel near the airport, we considered driving way back to ""The Egg & I"" for breakfast one more time.  By PURE LUCK, we saw a sign for ""Egg Works"", stumbled in and discovered that it was the SAME COMPANY. 

Here's all you need to know:

1. No wait on a holiday Monday.
2. I am an eggs benedict officianado, and theirs was MAGNIFICENT.  The eggs benedict was probably the best I've ever had, and the ""ranch-style"" potatoes that accompanied it were fantastic as well.
3. The prices were very reasonable.

The owner reached out to me to ask who our server was to ""address the issue."" Quite frankly they should address the issue that is themselves. I did not appreciate that they would want to throw their own staff under the bus when I called them out on inflating their yelp reviews. 

AVOID. The owner has found a way to cleverly inflate their yelp reviews. They spend their advertising budget on their staff; by offering a Disneyland trip to the server with the most 5 star reviews. This is clearly a great way for the staff to solicit 5 star reviews based on service and not food. Sorry, but I'd rather have great food and shitty service than shitty food and awesome service. 

When the metric is based of names in 5 star yelp reviews, how do you expect your servers to not solicit reviews? Or even mention it? 
***

This place has falsely inflated yelp reviews. I got duped into checking this place out and the food was no different from any other typical American diner breakfast places. Why such a low review? Food was mediocre. Ordered the avocado and chicken egg white omelet and it wasn't very memorable. The potatoes are generously covered in what was very similar to Lawry's seasoning salt. Also had the country fried steak skillet. The sausage gravy was good; aside from that I was not impressed with the food. The over easy egg was sitting in a puddle of grease and the egg white portions were rubbery. 

Our server was patient and great and we got free banana muffins upon yelp check in. At the end of our visit, our server asked us for a 5 star review and asked for us to write her name in the review. Apparently the owner of this place will gift a trip to Disneyland to the server who convinces the most guests to write 5 star reviews. Hmmmmmmmmmmm.....

This totally works against what Yelp is for. A consolidation of reviews and ratings; this place does NOT have a 4.5 star rating for its food. I would consider it a 3 star place AT BEST. If it was correctly rated, I wouldn't have wasted stomach space and a meal at this restaurant. 

If you don't believe me, take the time and read through the various reviews; you'll notice that majority of them will reference a server name, some of them talk about Disney or Disneyland trips. Frankly a restaurant smack out in Las Vegas should not have any references to Disney or Disneyland trips unless they were serving up Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes. 

AVOID. (Unless you're a local and have plenty of opportunities to eat around Vegas and don't care for a wasted meal)",LPTq2-fZ9_TsG5o8lAWCGg,14,4,1,IxiCfoUQsA4-TAERNuKEuA

a. Location - Not bad, but kind of hidden away at the Park 2000 Strip Mall on the Northeast corner of Sunset and Eastern. Not quite visible from the street, but there are some signs.  Plenty of parking.

b.  Ambiance - I was pleasantly surprised by the feeling of the restaurant. I was thinking that it would be small and budget like.  It was rather large, well lit, and the feeling was just right. A bit homey, plenty of room and a feeling like, this is comfy!

c.  The menu - OK, I am generally not too confused and know what I like. However, this place has an amazing menu.  It is like a local newspaper with several pages.  From these amazing egg/bacon/ carb combos, to hawaiian breakfast, to omelets, salads, hamburgers, chili the cincy way.... everything sounded so good.  I opted for an omelette with sourdough toast, and I am saving myself for the hawaiian breakfast and for the chili over spaghetti.  That sounds so cool... You cannot go wrong at this place, the choices are quite amazing.

d.  The service - I would say, this is more than great. They check on you all the time, they are professional, very courteous and very friendly.  I think they have servers that believe in their company, in their product and proud.  It is such a great feeling.  

e.  The food - I described the menu, and the food is just as great.  Everything here works well. It just clicks. I have already come back since this lunch on Saturday to try out the meals on Sunday morning which is a busier time at their other location. Guess what, it was only a 15 minute wait.  Denny's Ihop,  WHO?  Never again.

She always gets a half size, which is a great amount for her.  The potatoes are squared, fried, then covered in a fantastic seasoning, basically a seasoning salt, but it doesn't appear as salty to me.  

The french toast stuffed with eggs, cheese, and your choice of meat is another dish we frequently order.  The scrambles are very good as well.  Clearly, we have eaten here a lot.

for all those missing Hawaii!
They have: loco moco, Portuguese sausage, spam, & Aloha Shoyu!! 

I like to mentioned why Donna is so great!! 
My order is a little complicated but she managed to get the request in & asked the cook if it was possible. 
My order: the country ham breakfast
My request: ham well done, eggs:  scrambled & over-easy starch: half rice & half potato
& YES!! exactly as requested. 

My other half got the omelette breakfast & he enjoyed it. 
We both enjoyed our breakfast & our experience @ Egg Work. 
We had an EGG-ceptional time!! 

Try the potato & of course the banana nut muffin.

It was my first time here and EW2 didn't disappoint. Even the 20min wait was worth it. Great, friendly service even during a packed house at noon on a Sunday. Accommodating our large group was not a big deal. 

Reading over the newspaper like menu, there were so many items to choose from even three hawaiian dishes! I went with The Works Skillet, even though the stuffed french sounded amazing. The works skillet is packed with flavor and textures. I really enjoyed the banana nut muffin as well. My sis got the Haole Moco and that looked very good as well. The other orders in our party all looked great. (drool)

Being in Vegas, I had to keep the vibe going, so i got the Greyhound (vodka and grapefruit) and it was darn good. 

Also, we had two birthday celebrants in our party and our server brought out decorated banana nut muffins with a candle. We all sang ""happy birthday"". That was fun!

would the ""bf"" agree on my four stars, maybe not but we are not asking him, are we?

So...visited the first day of the new year. 
Seated after a 30 minute wait at about 11am (ish).

Seated, and our coffee (crappy coffee -- we cannot even discuss here) taken by a coked-out server.
Prior to even being brought coffee, my bf observed (saw, with his own eyes!) our server putting his fingers in his mouth, not sure why. We caught a passing hostess, retold our ""issue"" (server/fingers/mouth = uncomfortable) and not but two minutes later...greeted by a different server --- thank you. THANK YOU! I really appreciate this attentive service and saving of our brunch/breakfast. 

The bf ordered the stuffed french toast with eggies, bacon and....some sort of potato. good. not what i would order...but....what can i say.

I had, egg white omelet, with spinach (extra spinach), mushrooms, and Swiss. Could not decide if i wanted to be totally ""bad"" or just a little bit bad, so the server suggested i have 1/2 tomatoes and 1/2 some sort of potato. Thank you...for recognizing. 

I did order a side of hallandise AND a side of sausage gravy --- i ordered egg whites didn't i? and i just wanted to taste... 2oz portion of each, enough to know for next time. 

everything was completely greasy spoon - type, and...really what we needed, just.... wanted and...was. 

this place is great. 

could i cajole my bf to another meal, um...i think so. (he doesn't even like eggs - so .. i can only say 'wtf') 

i was happy ...greasy spoon -- but plus plus plus...

My bf and I, were still thinking of what to order while dad and cousin already knew what to get. We decided to just share a plate that had fresh corned beef, option of getting that or the canned version (no thanks, fresh is always better), my dad got I believe the egg combo?? I could be wrong I forgot the name. He got a half serving because they have half servings there which is a plus because I don't eat much.

As we were waiting, we seen this egg shape happy face at the end of table, my cousin explained to us that there are two faces, one sad and one happy. If you need service you would just flip the happy to the sad face and a waitress will come over. As he was showing us, I kid you not like 2secs later a waitress came by and ask if everything was okay. I was impressed but we just simply told her that we were just curious of what that was. 

Our food came, it was delicious! I tried some of my dads food and it was really great. I liked mine more because my Filipino side loves corn beef canned or not ha ha. My cousins daughter had a fresh banana muffin and of course we stole a piece from her when she wasn't looking because she will not let that go, and that was really tasty. Of course being such ""tourist"" we decided to take a pic of the egg and flipped it once again and 5secs later the waitress came up and asked what was wrong. Still so amazed on how quick she came again!

The service is spot on. Friendly smiles and great attitudes. If you don't like something, you simply flip your egg over on your table (it's part of the menu holder) and they come fast as can be.

Egg works is in a really convenient location if you're flying in and the cost is significantly less than what you'd pay on or near the strip. 

It's got a typical diner feel. Newspaper style menus with about 50+ items to choose from in all. I got a skillet with bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, and cheese for days. The portions are huge and you will NOT go home hungry. My wife ordered some sort of open faced croissant sandwich that came with potatoes on the side. It was sooooo good. 

Honestly, the biggest surprise of the whole meal was the banana nut muffin that we got. When you think of a banana nut muffin, it doesn't exactly stir up the same excitement that you'd get for other breakfast food, but let me tell you...these muffins are to die for! They come out warm, so cut it in half and slather that baby in butter and you are in for a treat! 

The service was very good despite the restaurant being super packed. We were always getting refills quickly and our food came out right on time. They're really a well-run operation which is just as important to me as the food itself.

5373551,2011-05-05,0,PXShA3JZMXr2mEH3on5clw,"I am a glutton by nature and the way that Egg Works II does breakfast only fuels my sinful constitution. The week before my birthday, I tend to go on a strict diet in preparation for the voracious appetite to come. Out of the blue, the craving for Eggs Benedict manifested, so I succumbed. It was the first time in five years that I have even thought about ordering this dish, so I did my research to find a combination that would best suit my personality. 

Egg Works happens to have the veggie works benny with grilled tomatoes, spinach, avocado, and two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce. I almost got this, until I saw the blackened prime rib served on a grilled croissant with sauteed spinach, bell peppers, and eggs covered in the same decadently rich dressing. I could not resist and why should I? The  huge portion was served in a skillet with a a few slices of fresh fruit and home fries. The potatoes are well seasoned and crisp. I started by saying I would only eat half of them and soon the whole side was gone. The eggs benny was delicious, but not without some minor issues. The hollandaise is plentiful and salty, ask for it on the side. The prime rib was cooked to well done and on the tough side. What it has going for it outweighs my complaints. The soft, airy croissant gives a texture that is not often associated with this dish, and I appreciated that. The eggs were poached to perfection. With one swift slash of my fork, the center burst out with all the fatty goodness of the yolk. The paprika on top, cut through the dense creaminess of the sauce. 

With my craving subdued, I can go another five years without it and a day without eating. It will take a few hours in the gym to work off this meal, but there is no remorse or regret with this decision.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,0,4,96FCno9svXR3ADZ_P2yRRA

They sat us and quickly got our drink orders. We went over the menu before we decided to order, and I decided I just wanted the classic - eggs and hashbrowns (I believe it also comes with a banana nut muffin or toast.) I noticed that adding meat on was an extra $2, so I decided not to get any. But, I was surprised when the waitress then took my order, and asked what kind of meat I wanted. I figured the menu was outdated because I didn't think the waitress would offer me meat that was $2 extra without telling me. My fiance got the stuffed french toast and a coffee.

The food came out and it was amazing! I think the classic says that it comes with two eggs any style, but I felt like I got waaay more than just two eggs. The banana nut muffin was to die for. The bacon, unfortunately, was overcooked and hard to eat. I took one bite and decided not to eat any more of it....that is until we got the check. I noticed that she had charged me for the bacon, which made me upset for two reasons 1) she didn't mention that it was extra and 2) it was completely inedible. (But after I realized 3 pieces of bacon cost me $2, I tried to eat as much as possible...never again.)

I guess maybe it's my fault for not correcting her or assuming she'd mention that it was extra. It was not a big enough mistake to stop me from coming back, it just put a little damper on my day, especially since the bacon was rock hard. Next time I'll just make sure to mention I don't want any sort of meat. Overall, the rest of the food was good and the service was quick.",yTV3KHOm4-RQpClyYKGnkw,1,2,4,cUsWMBLV_dEj-i877D1HUw

We definitely felt rushed. Next, I ordered eggs benedict and when it was served the eggs were raw! As in when I cut in to them the whites oozed out like snot, which is disgusting.

What?! So I said that all I wanted was for them to be poached until the whites were actually cooked...2 more servers asked what the problem was, again alluding to having them cooked over medium or hard.

Kids breakfast meals are limiting.  There is only one pancake option.  It's a mouse pancake with a weird face on it.  No bacon or sausage.  This is a major issue with my ten year old.  He is too cool for the face and wants some meat.  He has ordered lunch or off the adult menu to avoid the mouse pancake.  I tried to talk him into asking the waitress to not make it a mouse and we could add a side of bacon.

I ordered a skillet and I really wish I hadn't. My skillet cane with potatoes, chilies, a hugeeeeee amount of cheese, and the over medium eggs on top. Sounds good right? Might have been good if it wasn't totally and completely smothered in their house salsa of which I wasn't a fan. This made the potatoes have no crunch, the cheese was overkill, the salsa was subpar and not spicy at all, and I basically only enjoyed the eggs.

Service was fine. We were able to order quickly and were checked up on. When we went to the register to pay we were ignored for a couple minutes while the two working at the register were chatting nonstop. 

I definitely would consider coming here again because maybe I just didn't get the right thing. This place definitely seems to be doing something right to draw such a crowd.",FMsG9vtq2tonIszrlc5yag,1,0,3,ICToZZ-87Jp0M8Ge4yqI9w

Imagine a creative twist on your standard eggs benedict, then turn it up a notch. What you get is the Blackened Prime Rib Benny.

Its 2, thin cut pork chops, cooked perfectly served with the home fries and 2 eggs, and toast, or, their muffin.  Knowing they have large portions, I opted for english muffin.

Stephen had the Cincinnati chili omelette and his mom had the Stuffed French Toast, which was stuffed with eggs and bacon.  HUGE.. where we took 1/2 of it home.

After reading my Yelp buddy Judy C.'s review of Egg Works........I quickly booked marked this place to give it a go when I was out here in Las Vegas.

Apparently Egg Works has 5 locations - 4 restaurants are in the Las Vegas area, and 1 restaurant is in the Henderson area.

This location on E. Sunset Road was not too far from our hotel...........I wanna say it was about an 8 mile drive to this place. 

When we got here in the late morning (10:30 AM or so) the restaurant was packed! We had a short 5 minute wait before be got seated outside. (They have indoor & outdoor seating). May I recommend if you're from Hawaii and not use to the winter cold.........you should sit inside, because when the wind is blowing, and you're not moving around.............it can get pretty nippy outside. Lol!

Upon scanning the menu, I decided to get the ""Sundance Special"", which is basically a Veggie Omelet which consisted of the following - Spinach, Sliced Mushrooms, and Artichoke Hearts folded with Swiss Cheese, with a special works artichoke cheese filling, topped with Feta Cheese, and fresh Tomatoes. I also added some blacken chicken with my veggie omelet, and with my meal, there was this square cut potatoes that came on the side.........

One of my friends had ordered the Country Fried Steak, and my other friend ordered a Spinach Benny.

With my breakfast, I got a Banana muffin, and I must say it was soft & warm. It went great with my pot of coffee!

Overall I loved my Sundance Special........the veggie omelet was awesome! What I didn't care for was the square cut potatoes, because the potatoes were rather salty & dry. I ate very little of that, and had to stop because it was just too salty for me.

The menu you here is pretty extensive.........and they are basically opened for breakfast & lunch. as the hours here go from 6 AM to 3 PM.",-9da1xk7zgnnfO1uTVYGkA,8,6,4,Qa_8CafwGP3V1SwobC_7Mw

I came here twice on my last trip and will be coming here every morning in the future. especially on the day you leave since it opens at 6 am and I like to leave on the early flight Monday rather than Sunday night.

It's an easy drive from the strip if you just head east away from the madness to S. Eastern Avenue, and then south to E. Sunset.

Mashed Potato Omelette: 5/5
My absolute favorite omelette, this is a perfect order for all the potato lovers out there. It's a huge omelette stuffed with garlic mashed potatoes and bacon topped with sour cream and melted cheese, and served with a huge side of the potatoes. I usually get a half order and it's the perfect size (plus it's a little bit cheaper!). I also order it vegetarian style aka without the bacon and I find it delicious!

Banana Nut Muffin: 5/5
A lot of the meals come with either toast or the banana nut muffin, but do yourself a favor, and get the muffin. It's served warm and it's heavenly with butter.

Stuffed Toast: 3/5
I wasn't a fan of the stuffed toast. It had too much cinnamon for my preference and not enough savory to counteract the sweet. To be fair, I ordered it without meat and it would probably be way better with sausage. 

Habla Diablo Potatoes: 5/5
These are one of my favorite breakfast potatoes. They're super well seasoned, crispy, and delicious. 

Overall: 5/5

We are greeted by tacky decor - it's a pseudo country-farm experience with the tables and newspaper menu - the theme is apparent, but the aesthetic and curb appeal just aren't all the way there yet.

A group of three, we get seated in a nice, comfy booth, which is terrific after a 10hour overnight drive. Named appropriately, they have the works when it comes to dishes with eggs. We peruse the extensive newspaper menu of everything from pancakes, waffles, french toast, omelets, eggs benedict, scrambles, skillets, crepes, salads, burgers, and even an egg substitute, if you don't like eggs but chose to eat at a restaurant called Egg Works...

Anyway, we make our decision. A skillet, and omelet, and country fried steak and eggs. We get all sorts of options for toast, and are greeted with bright and friendly service.
