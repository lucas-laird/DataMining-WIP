I was dining alone which some people can't muster but I keep great company with myself and tend to talk to strangers LOL!  

I made the earliest reservations possible but still had to wait 15 mins which was totally okay because while I was waiting I won $400 on some weird monkey slot machine nearby.  I told the Hostess what happened and handed her $20 as a celebratory tip which of course she reciprocated by seating me at a really nice table.

Besides referencing my fellow Yelper's feedback, I sometimes like to preview menus online before dining out so I have a couple of choices instead of randomly ordering.  Here are the choices I divulged in and all were REALLY delicious:

Lacquered Roast Pork   $12
Toro Fatty Tuna                $15 per piece
Squab Lettuce Wraps     $15

24633,2009-10-21,1,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"My first two-star review - and well-deserved, lol. 

Why do so many non-asians fall for the Asian-named, fakey Asian themed restaurants?

Could I open a retail establishment with an 'exotic' name like Shangri-La, Tao, or Buddha Bar and start raking in the bucks because Americans believe in exotica due to never traveling internationally?

Le Bistro??

Le Car????

This place is as overrated as they come. My bias is that I don't like Vegas in general, but this place reminds me of the worst fakey aspects of Vegas, Hollywood, and Beverly Bills. The real Buddha might have laughed his belly off at the vanity, superficiality, and ego-parfum of this place, or silently glided through the materialistic depravity.

I had a vegetarian bowl....about 3.00 worth of vegetables with a 400% markup, which was my fault. I read some online reviews that were all so glowing I lost my marbles and went. Lost some bucks, and more importantly I wasted another sliver of my life. Going to Vegas even for that 80 minutes, after being in Zion National Park , almost ruined the serenity I gained the during the whole trip.

The restaurant Tao has nothing to do with the real Way of the Tao, as far as I can see. It's just another trendy, forgettable, disposable waste of time and money, situated in a shopping mall!",DHWZP63IAk9nIjHOdnbfJQ,1,1,2,HxNDfdFR18JDd8jBru13IA

The amount of dudes standing around gawking at the women was ridiculous.  I don't know if the cheese dick bus stopped off but some of the people here were straight out of central casting for 'Night at the Roxbury'

35085,2010-03-02,0,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"I was in Las Vegas for a work event and two of my colleagues and I decided to try Tau out for dinner. 

We had reservations but still waited almost 20 minutes to be seated and were only seated at that time because my colleague went back up to the host stand. I understand that the restaurant was busy but expected that if the wait was that long (with a reservation) that the host would let us know. 

Once we were seated we decided to let the waiter (who had been there for 5 years) decide how we would attack the menu. His recommendations were spot on. We started with the spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice (which was tasty but had too much rice for me) and the lobster wontons with shitake ginger broth (wontons were light and the lobster and sauce were rich - delicious). 

He had us move onto sushi and had the Surf and Turf roll and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and Ponzu sauce. The yellowtail has a great balance of flavor and while the surf and turf roll was good, it had almost too many flavors going on. 

We moved onto heartier dishes like the wok-seared New York sirloin (which was good and WAY less expensive than the 12 oz Kobe ribeye our waiter suggested), the Chilean sea bass (he suggested two appetizer portions as opposed to one main which was the same price and we got more fish), and the Buddha's vegetables. All were delicious and the perfect amount of food for the group. 

We finished off with the oversized fortune cookie which came with a fortune for everyone and was fun to share. 

Overall it was a fun dining experience as long as your are ok with sharing plates (which i am).",zbyfmfTa0lpG3RDpOAiUZg,0,0,3,cdPoChulqhVR1THSxJv54w

44886,2013-11-23,0,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"This place is great! The food was awesome. If you come here and you don't get the lobster dumplings you are doing yourself a disservice. The server said their signature dish was the miso sea bass, definitely worth trying, and our server suggested the sausage fried rice with fried egg on top, also amazing. Service was great, drinks were tasty. 

So why only 4 stars?  A couple reasons. Number one, I don't like being sold something right away. When we sat down our server briefly went over the drink lists and immediately asked if we wanted something from the bar. Nice to ask, but how about giving us some time to look through the lists you just pointed out. Or even better, how about offering some water first.  And when I say offering, I mean offering all options. Not just bottled water. It just seems like a sneaky way to get just a little more money out of me. I don't want to feel like I'm at a car dealership when I'm eating at a restaurant. 

The second reason for the downgrade was the robotic repetitiveness in the restaurant. Explanation. We got our appetizers, ther server came by and asked us if we had everything we needed and we said we were fine. 5 minutes later a  manager came by and asked us if we have everything we need and we said we were great. Our entrees came out and our server asked if we had everything we needed, we were fine. A few minutes later a different manager came by and asked us...you guessed it, do we have everything we need. Not how is the food or how are we enjoying everything so far, just do we have everything we need. Now, you might say to yourself that's not so bad. But it was just me and my friend, and all the tables of two are literally right next to each other so we can hear the interactions of all the tables around us.  We had 3 tables within earshot of our own, and I must have heard ""do you have everything you need?"" 15 times between the servers and the managers. It's one of those things that once you notice you can't help but hear it. 

Normally I wouldn't even nitpick over something so trivial but i also heard the other servers in the area ask for drink orders immediately and only offer bottled water.  These are all clearly restaurant policies that take away from the restaurant. I don't want to feel like a step in a training manual. All those little annoyances aside this restaurant is awesome. It's not the quietest restaurant in the world but as long as you understand you are eating essentially at a nightclub I highly recommend this place.",JilARHtvTUzSrH1Zuv76Nw,0,0,4,Q3Qd9QPtUQpbJh6dQrPzrw

I already knew what to expect from the Tao experience, and it was a welcomed seductive relief from the Venetian's baroque architectural jitters that hit me between the massage and dinner. Feeling relaxed like Gumby and dressed in my favorite black D&G suit, I rolled into our private party at Tao with a few people on my staff...we were greeted by a friendly and attentive wait staff holding trays of coconut shrimp, ginger-chicken ravioli, and chicken ginger dumplings...I was stuffed before the main event.

Since we had a large party, we did Tao buffet style. Here is the beef & reef sampling that I picked up along the line:

- A piece of miso glazed Chilean sea bass (Delighted my taste buds. Superb.)
- A slice of wasabi-crusted filet mignon (Tender. Vibrant. Absolutely delicious.)
- Chicken in hoisin sauce (Just okay. I've had better at Saigon Grill here in Manhattan)
- Pad Thai noodles (Mildly nutty. Tender noodles. The sweet & spicy flavor wasn't balanced enough for me...hey, I'm a pad thai snob.)

The best part was the dessert. Nothing is sweeter than watching the ""WTF?"" looks on the faces of people waiting to get into the nightclub as 150 of us are given priority access.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is excellent, service was great, and the food was prepared quick. The day after we all went to the Bellagio Buffet which was more expensive than Tao and the food was nowhere near to Tao. Bellagio buffet was a waste of money.

I went for my birthday with my girlfriend, so we had reservations, so we didn't wait to be seated. The wait staff was very very attentive and truly catered to anything we needed.

The food didn't dissapoint as I had read a lot about TAO before going. We chose from a very extensive wine list, decided on our appetizers and meal and were pleased with every part of the meal.

The part of the dinner that was the most memorable was when they brought out a HUGE fortune cookie for my Birthday (I didn't realize my GF had planned for them to do that) By this point I was very stuffed, but it was such a great Idea for a Birthday dessert. I didn't feel rushed at all and was able to truly enjoy my meal.

The decor is lush velvets, waterfalls , many unique Buddha sculptures and a hand-carved 20-foot tall Buddha floating over a pond. 

The food was awesome. Kudos to Sam Hazen the executive chef who has created a menu that features specialties from China, Japan and Thailand. Not going to list everything ordered, as that would make for a very long blog. But the highlights were the Lobster Wontons, the addictive Edamame, Filet Mignon, a Sea Bass dish that was unlike anything that I have ever had, and of course all topped off with a hot sake.

The only downside to the visit - even though we had reservations -  we had to wait an hour for a table. 

But I will go back just for the dessert - Chocolate and Raspberry Wontons served with Tahitian Vanilla Bean Ice-Cream. (Next time - NO SHARING!!).",32KQ1pp4gHXFR5loCev7dw,0,0,5,-GjW_npcT5rpl0EBMNPvVA

Located inside the Venetian, which already smells great, the entrance and gift shop have the wonderful smell of sandalwood. The stone ""baths"" greet you as you walk to the hostess station...each time I've visited they have been filled with water, rose petals and candles. I've heard mention that there may be events where Buddha nymphs are soaking in the tubs...could be urban legend, could be wishful thinking by drunken pigs. Either way, I wish I was a Tao bath girl.... 

But I digress...back to the food. Whether dining alone at the sushi bar, partying with friends, or starting at a special someone this place accommodates the mood. Dark wood, candle light, ginormous statues of the Buddha, fresh flowers, small medium and large Buddha statues abound. I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing the club - but dining here has been enough satisfaction. 

The sushi is divine and overpriced...individual order are great but if you really want to be impressed, throw your credit card to the wind and go for the ""chef's special"". - otherwise known as sushi roulette in Vegas. You give them an amount to spend and then wait for monster plate. The sashimi of Kobe beef (think carpaccio) is glorious, buttery, melty goodness and even better with the smokey sauce that accompanies the avocado tempura (sin on a plate). 

Peking duck eggrolls, Sea Bass meal or satay small plate, scallops...you could spend forever savoring. The sake menu is amazing and must be sampled - probably the reason I have never gotten to desert. But then again, there are great places within the Venetian to venture to for liquid desert!

I've learned when you go to a trendy Asian-fusion place the food is going to be mix results. Sushi is usually good, but main dish can be a hit or miss. If you're looking at Tao then you heard about the nice decor. The vibe is Vegas/Hollywood glam, seen someone famous every time. If you dine here, you also get a line stamp for the club.

Reservations
Waited an hour to be seated with dinner reservations on a slow Tuesday night.  

Bar Area
Flagged down manager after 1/2 hour sitting in bar area with no drink service.  Manager got argumentative, said I was exaggerating and it hadn't been a 1/2 hour since we had been sitting there.  He was right it was 35 minutes.  Finally ordered drinks, got wrong drinks and took forever to close out especially when they don't give you a pen to sign check while walking away.    

Employees
If you like going to places where the employees have attitudes and treat you as if you're lucky to be there, this is the place.  Don't expect an apology, free app or any acknowledgement for being seated after waiting an hour after your reservation.

Food
The sushi dishes not good.  Go to some of the many other great sushi restaurants in Vegas if this is what you want.  Other dishes rival PF Chang's only at a higher cost with crappy service.  

There are so many restaurants with great ambiance and food in Vegas so don't waste it on a sub par, negative experience with a restaurant like Tao.",bK4HEFfd1Tg0V3482evE-Q,1,0,1,7KxJWxu1Gk6bxGAAe1uzsQ

My favorite dishes were the Lobster Wontons and the Sea Bass.  The seasoning was enough so that it's not too salty or spicy.  The sashimi was simple and had a hint of jalapeno (I didn't eat the jalapeno).  I had the Sake Flight which was not impressive.  I probably should have ordered a cocktail instead.  Overall the food was delicious but a bit pricey.  Our group of 4 people was perfect to share the different dishes.

Well anyways, if you're able to get past the obvious whoring out of different Asian cultures, you'll find that the menu is made up of day-to-day plain-jane dishes dressed up and sold for 10 times its usual price. And it's not like they're so well-executed either. I'm talking fried beef udon and wonton... uhh, they sell better udon on the streets in Japan, and for a tenth of Tao's price.

Btw, our salad came with a fruit fly crawling in it. A LIVE INSECT. Our server was plenty horrified when we pointed the fly out to her, but God forbid she actually offer to give us comps for our lousy meal. She simply whisked the salad away and acted as if nothing's happened.

We were staying at the Venetian, so it seemed appropriate that we went here for dinner, plus we heard you get free access to Lavo (the other club at the Palazzo) if you eat there.

We had 8:30 reservations and when we got to the place on a Tuesday night, we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The place did not seem that crowded, especially for a weeknight. Anyways, once we were seated, we told the waiter about the reason for our trip and he said we would be taken care of! After browsing the menu we settled on Filet Mignon Pepper Steak ($35) and Pad Thai Noodles with Chicken ($19) and we each had a specialty cocktail. The Filet Mignon pepper steak might have been the best thing I have ever eaten. It was fabulous. I know it was my husband's favorite meal of the entire trip. I mean, pepper steak from most chinese restaurants is pretty good, but then when you add filet mignon to the dish- it takes it to a whole new level! The pad thai was pretty good too, but the star of the meal was the pepper steak.

After our meal, our waiter brought us over 2 glasses of champagne and we weer able to choose a dessert for free. We selected the Yuzu Sugar Dusted Donuts with a trio of 3 dipping sauces. OMG these were amazing. They were warm and crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. The dipping sauces made this dessert extra special.

384620,2012-10-10,0,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"I had heard so much about this place & was so excited because I absolutely LOVE Asian food. But I'm so sad to say, I felt like it was over-hyped & over-priced.

First of all, Tao is probably one of the most sought-after, hot restaurant/clubs on the Vegas Strip. The architecture and decor of the place is absolutely incredible! The beautiful Buddhas, the tubs with rose petals, the scent of incense and the gorgeous Asian artwork is completely the opposite of the uber-modern, loud, well-decked, expensive perfume- & cologne-doused, busy crowd that it attracts, especially on a Saturday night.

Our meal had its high points. A group of 7 of us plus 1 child were there to celebrate my Mom's b-day. We tried to make a reservation earlier in the day, but were told the only one they had available was after 11 p.m. Rather, they said try coming in & waiting for a table, which we took a chance on.

We waited for about 45 minutes in the bar area for a table on a Saturday night, which isn't bad at all. We ordered some drinks & a few appetizers off what I thought was an app menu while we waited.

But once we were seated, we got the same exact menu, which is kind of limited. There were enough options & our group had a lot of vegetarians, so everyone was happy.

I wasn't super hungry -- a horrible thing that happens to me when I travel! -- so I wanted to go with something somewhat light. I ordered the Pad Thai w/chicken, which was pricier than most neighborhood Thai restaurants at almost $19, so I had high expectations. Though it came in a really cool dish that was sort-of elevated, it tasted about the same as if I had paid $9 for it at a local spot. And it was completely SMOTHERED with tasteless bean sprouts. I don't mind a few, but I don't want a mouthful with every bite.

I wanted to order the shrimp tempura appetizer, too, but the waiter said you get 2 pieces for $8 which I didn't think was worth it!

The service was good, tho, and my family enjoyed their meals. My husband said the orange chicken was really good and he would have loved some more. The giant fortune cookie dessert with Happy Birthday all over the plate for my mom was a real treat!!

All in all, I'm glad I got to experience Tao, but I feel like I was slightly let down. That being said, given the chance, I would go back again & try the sushi. It looked fantastic!!",2s1DXHo9Q-hCPZ8aLNFBjg,2,0,3,hdrqpJSggzmanzC_dGFPAA

My husband and I started with a few appetizers- he had the hot & sour soup with shrimp toast.  The shrimp toast was the best I've ever tasted.  I had the shrimp tempura which was made with large, meaty prawns.  We split the pork dumplings, which we both praised.
We shared the orange chicken as an entree.  We also ordered a side of rice, which was perfect because the entree also came with rice.  The chicken was excellent and served with that green Chinese vegetable I like and always forget to look for at the grocery store.  We both agreed that the dish was sweet- it would be perfect with another spicy dish to balance it.
Loved the 20 foot Buddha and the opium pipe wall.  Hated the meditating Buddha heads on the wall behind the host desk- it looked like body parts.  We also didn't quite get the large bathtub type objects filled with rose petals in the entrance.  I am guessing it's a nod to offerings to Buddha.

The off the menu selections were great, the filet, the strip steak, and the chicken were all great. The steaks were cooked perfectly and the chicken came out flavorful and juicy. 

The chefs selections came out in a bunch of small, family style portions, and featured everything from pad thai to fish skewers and edamame beans. Drinks were okay, the wines by the glass were good, and prices were more than fair for the offerings. Don't however, ask for anything off the menu. One person at the table ordered a grapefruit martini, and the waiter looked as though he had been hit in the head with a baseball bat, and ran off. What came to the table 20 minutes later was a glass of vodka with a splash of crappy grapefruit juice cocktail, it was horrid...Then showed up on the bill for $15+...

More things went awry when the bills were presented. The server dropped them off then disappeared for a half hour, with our table size he already got his built in gratuity so he seemed to not care anymore. We were billed 3 times for something we ordered once, and there were other things that got rang in more than once. The waiter conveniently attributed this to the ""chefs selections"" choice, and would do nothing to fix the bill. It ended up being $85+ per person for the chefs selections menu (those who ordered, requested to stay at the $50 price point, which the restaurant offered),

Overall, the food was good, the steaks were well worth the $35-$40, and the wines were worth the $10-$12 glass, other than that, it was a bit over done. I would go back for the steaks and wine, but would recommend against summoning yourself to the chefs menu, seems like a great way for the restaurant to pawn off whatever isn't selling on you while charging whatever they feel like.",L1_QaRgNIiRAHusjstBomg,3,0,3,Tje5wVtLXSB0rHisFyrgDQ

I can't tell you that the food itself or drinks were memorable but I did want to check out the Vegas location so I made a reservation.

Boy, did I make a mistake. My friends and I arrive right on time and are told that even w/ reservations, everyone waits 30 mins.  So we asked them how long we would have waited if we didn't have reservations.  Apparentlly, they didn't have our reservations although I had made the reservations w/ them directly that day.  Strike one from the host who was the rudest man on earth.  He must have taken too many ""cool pills"" since he had something up his ass!

Then, while we wait for our reservations they screwed up at the bar, my friends and I are given a cocktail menu that we ordered off of.  We ordered one round of drinks that clearly stated that it should have been about $30 + tip for drinks.  We get the bill and it says $60.  When I point the mistake out to the server (while clearly showing her the menu we were given), she is so dumb that she mentions that we also got a Diet Coke in addition to our 4 drinks!  So the Diet Coke accounts for the $30 difference?  What a moran!  When I asked her to bring out the manager as she clearly did not have one brain cell, the  server started giving me an attitude.  After a 10 min. wait for the ""manager"", I was told that they had given us the wrong menu w/ incorrect prices.  Apparently, the bill was supposed to be $60 although the menu THEY gave us said it was supposed to be $7 each.  We were not given an apology for the mistake or anything!  

Because I have worked at a restaurant and currently work in advertising, I know that good customer service would have included an apology for THEIR mistake and then an offer to honor the lower price.  No such thing was done so I demanded a talk w/ the manager.   

Only after I bitched out the manager did she apologize for the mistake and correct the bill for our 1 round of $30 drinks!  This after making us deal w/ this and completely ruin a fun night out!  After such horrible service, we were told our table was ready (as if we were LUCKY to be given our table 40 mins after our reservation time!).  We told them that we would not be dining there.  We didn't want to give this establishment any of our money!

We gave them a piece of our mind and walked out w/ the glasses in hand! 

This pompousness and outright HORRIBLE customer service ruined our evening.  We ended up eating at the casual Asian restaurant in the venetian as we were so hungry by this time that we couldn't wait to try to find another ""trendy place"".  It turned out to be a good decision as the food was good and we got great service!  The best part, we ended up spending probably 1/6th what we would have spent at Tao.  I would have paid for a great meal, great service at Tao but the point that they would not quickly resolve the issue from THEIR mistake made me furious!  

Tao, get your act together!  If you went to a store and they clearly had the wrong price marked on a sweater or in their ad, they should honor the lower price.  Same goes for the menu you gave us!  I will NEVER go to this location again!",apUNf0oFKKzlGbk1Jvg1PQ,6,1,1,kDUQWI-xTAuMaMIDFOUzzQ

We went to Tao tonight for drinks and dinner, sponsored by a trade association whose Board my husband sits on.  So dinner was not on our dime, I never looked at a menu with prices, so I can't comment on how pricey the place is.

I can say that the decor is the first thing that amazed me--loved it!  It takes a tremendously imaginative and talented person to create an atmosphere like this--which keeps you looking ahead to see what's around the corner and wondering what will astound you next

The next thing I noticed was the music being piped through the place--VERY hip!  Loud but in a good way.  A later trip to the ladie's room revealed that there's a talented DJ responsible for the tunes.  

The drinks kept coming and when it was time for dinner, we were presented with a lovely salad, followed by dinner served family style, including filet mignon, an UNBELEEEEVABLE Chilean sea bass with a gingery-garlicky yumminess to it, teensie weensie string beans, fried rice, and sauteed shiitake mushrooms.  Ummmm..HELLO!  After dieting for 2 weeks in anticipation of this trip, my taste buds were TRIPPIN'!!

Next up was an assortment of desserts, including a Fuji apple tart-y thing with ice cream, a bowl of fruity stuff like tangerines, lychees, blackberries, raspberries and ice cream, chocolate lava cake and ice cream...on and on....this meal was planned to show me some love...ice cream and I, why, we're lovers!!!

The service was absolutely and completely IM-PECC-ABLE.  There was a staff of 5 or 6 dedicated to our group of about 40.  My water glass was never empty (or even close to it) and when I asked for a glass of sharp, dry white wine and the server came back with ""all she had on hand"" which was a Chardonnay and I politely declined, she returned a couple of minutes later with an unbelievable Pinot Grigio that hit the spot.

This place is great. Fabulous.  Wonderful.  Not just the food, but also the service.  My girlfriends and I went to Vegas for Spring Break and decided to try out Tao.  There were 6 of us, and being poor college students, we did not want to splurge too much on the first day of vacay.  As such, we spent almost 20 minutes trying to decipher the menu and decide what to order -- I think our server came up to us at least 3 times in those 20 minutes.  Finally, we got over our shyness and asked him what he would recommend for us.  Our server was friendly, and directly asked our price range; we stated $30-$40 per person, at most.  He offered to put together a ""tasting menu"" JUST FOR US.  We were really grateful, and we immediately accepted the offer.  

DISHES:  Most famous for their sea bass; our waiter ordered 3 appetizers of sea bass (2 sticks per order, so we each got one stick), a ravioli thing (I think?), and some other noodle and dumpling dishes.  When the food arrived, our server explained that he had given us a mix of the most popular dishes of their restaurant, and the dumplings and noodle things were just to ""fill us up.""  Indeed, between the delicious food and omg-I-can't-get-over-the-sea-bass, we were extremely full by the end of dinner, and each person's bill averaged less than $30. 

We were so happy with the food and service that we decided to tip more (I think we tipped like 25% lol).

So for my rating: 

sea bass: 5/5; all other food: 4/5

service: 5/5",fMTBcNm4ifohzrR7rcfnkg,0,0,5,DIW3311iwvAGF1y11IZugA
672918,2013-06-13,0,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"We ate at Tao this past weekend for our groups official bachelor party dinner and it was a major success. I set up the dinner about a month in advance for our group of 14.  I did a lot of research at other spots for a nice set menu dinner, and we ended up choosing Tao based on what they offered for the given price, and their great location on the strip. We almost did a steakhouse dinner elsewhere, but it would have come with less courses, and about $100 more per person.  

Anyway, working with the Tao group was great. They provided us with a nice custom set menu, which really gives the dinner an 'official' feel, and always impresses the guest of honor. We all arrived and were greeted and escorted to the semi-private dining room which overlooks the restaurant. I was a bit shocked because I thought we needed 16 to get the room, but I guess based on our time slot and availability, we were able to be seated there.  This was awesome, and the whole group was way impressed already. 

We had a great spread of food, and they did a wonderful job with the portions and dividing it up well based on the seating. It wasn't tons of food, but it was still a good amount to leave everyone happy. The Peking duck spring rolls were a huge hit during the appetizer course. For our entrees, we went with orange chicken and the wasabi crusted filet mignon, and then a bunch of sides. Both were big hits, especially the orange chicken.  Then the dessert course came, which was ridiculous. The spread they brought out could have filled everyone up if that was the only thing we ate. Everything was amazing. 

Also the service was great throughout the event. No one seemed to be waiting for a drink which was awesome.  We were probably loud with speeches/toasts/etc, so having the semi-private area was perfect. 

All in all, everything went so smoothly from course to course, and we all left there in great spirits for the night ahead. Every one of the guys kept giving me props setting the dinner up and praises for how the food was just right in terms of what we got and how much we got of it.  It was an awesome feeling and confirmed that we definitely chose the right place for our bachelor parfy dinner, so I wanted to share some of the credit by writing this review.

Dinner was insanely perfect, am a big fan of Chinese fusion food and it was my night of gluttony. I would totally recommend the Thai crab cake with the Mango sauce, I know I devoured to the last speck. The next thing that I would not miss the next time am at Tao's is the Pork Dumplings, delicious!! But watch it, they can be really HOT!! Don't miss the Kung Pao Chicken here, I know it sounds gross, I too would save it for P.F Changs but it seriously was different and you will not regret it. Also try the shrimp in coconut sauce, but you should be a coconut friendly person. Overall great food and absolutely great service.

Try the Mochi tasting for dessert or the mango rice pudding with ginger icecream or even better to try the Tao's Chocolate Martini... you would be in heaven for the next few minutes.

try the tao-tini. so yummy.

for appetizers, we had the vegetarian spring rolls with chili sauce and the pork dumplings - both delicious.

as an entree, i had the salmon, though i'm not sure of it's exact title on the menu, it's the only salmon dish there. try it, i promise you will not be disappointed.

also, don't be mislead into thinking tao is too pricey for you. everything on the menu is moderately priced and well worth it.

Word to the wise: TAO = a place where the customer is always wrong.

Here's the skinny: we dined 11 deep Saturday evening while in town celebrating my 32nd birthday. It's Memorial Day weekend and expected to be a madhouse in Vegas, so I made every precaution to secure reservations, be on time for said reservations and ensure my entire party was on time with me. I may not be Kim Kardashian, but perhaps the manager failed to note that my reservation was made by someone who works directly with them and asked for my party to be taken care of. I'm also assuming they didn't know that I am a celebrity publicist in LA and have sent numerous clients to spend thousands of dollars at their establishment. Maybe if this was noted my party would have received better service. 

Food: my boyfriend and I split the chicken dumplings, the spicy yellowtail sushi roll and the chicken pad thai. More than enough food! The pad thai seemed to be in a never-ending bowl! It alone would have fed the 2 of us easily. The dumplings were the best choice out of our order. Fresh, steamed and flavorful. I only wish there were more in an order! The roll was good, but nothing special. My friend had the BBQ pork and it was phenomenal. I'd look into that if BBQ meats are your thing. The pad thai was pretty standard. It was also good but nothing to write home about. Nonetheless, I was pleased with the overall good experience. The crowning glory was the giant fortune cookie that was sent out for my birthday (it is filled with both vanilla and chocolate cream - oh hey ying yang!) - which was the only good move by the restaurant the entire meal.

The service: this is where things get rough. We sat down for our 8:30pm reservation around 8:45pm. We didn't mind the 15 minute wait. We're a large party and it's Saturday night - reservations can take some time. I get it. We sat down and didn't see a waitress for nearly 20 minutes. When she finally came by the table she took our drink order and bounced for another 20 minutes or so. My friend asked for an iced tea that 40 minutes later had never made it's way to the table. When we asked about it, the waitress took another 15 minutes to bring it claiming that they had to ""brew a new pot"". Ok. Then when we were an hour and a half into our dinner order waiting for more beverages the waitress was M.I.A. We finally called over the manager and asked if we could please get some drinks (one of which had already been ordered and never brought to the table). His response was ""what? Are you trying to get something free out of this?"". I'm sorry? No. We are trying to get our drinks and spend more money in your establishment. Wow. The next epic failure of this restaurant/nightclub comes from the security guard/staff. My boyfriend got up from the table to take a work related call. It was noisy inside so he stepped outside to take it. When he came back in a security guard grabbed him by his shirt and said ""where do you think you're going?! Get in line!"" To which my boyfriend responded - ""I've been sitting with a table of 11 for nearly 2 hours. I just stepped outside to take a call."" The guard then responded ""yeah right"" and grabbed him by his shirt collar. When he turned around to radio someone my boyfriend just yanked himself free and walked inside. The final straw was when the waitress asked if we'd like to divide the tab. We said yes and tried to be fair by making a few groups so as not to create 11 separate checks for her. Tik-tok - 1 hour later (literally) she plopped down the checks with a look of irritation and left. 

Total time in restaurant (due to slow service) - 3.5 hours!! It was nearly midnight when we finally left!

The club was hopping but we were not interested in that. We just wanted a nice dinner in what seemed to be only a mildly busy restaurant. A party of 11 would have left a much bigger tip had the service been respectable. I get that everyone wants to dine here, but that doesn't mean you have to stop creating a great customer experience for those choosing your restaurant.

That's all I can say about the restaurant as far as food goes. The setting and service definitely is smack on but I was there for Food and it was utter disappointment.

It's Asian Fusion made American. It's the pimped up fancy cousin of Panda Express.. I was really disappointed with the food since I heard so many good things about them, I'm not saying they taste awful. They were decent for sure but for such a highly rated(and expensive) establishment it's just plain disappointing. 

The Tempura was a shocker! The batter they use for the vegetables were inconsistent with the ones used on the Prawn which should be the star of the Tempura. It's just wrong on so many levels..I'm sure if one's never tried real tempura this would have gotten a pass but Com'on guys you have a rep to keep up.

All the Rolls were saucy as you might expect for American Cali rolls, so you'll never find these in Japan for sure.

All in all the Chinese dishes were Sauced heavily or sweet which is absolutely Americanized. 

The servers however were excellent and know the menu really well. The decor is a 5 star for sure, and that's the only reason I give Tao a 2 Star and not a 1.

This is the most wired Asian food I have ever had in the states. Price is expensive and food is bad. Dishes are big and things insider are small. 

The most amazing part is the decoration of the restaurant, though I don't understand why they put Buddhas in a Tao style restaurant (they are different religions). 

Anyway, it might be a successful nightclub, but definitely not a successful Chinese or Asian restaurant! Never go for this, if you want to try REAL Chinese food in LV.",T5kKuMjucxarwjR5ZT9biQ,0,0,1,ivAezk3Jjz5sp3uO3iQxmg

My husband and I aren't big eaters and don't like wasting food so we almost always split meals.  The prix fixe menu looked amazing so we ordered that to share after the waiter recommended sharing the dishes family style. We were told that the prix fixe menu couldn't be shared. My husband protested because you should be able to do what you want with the food you order and because the restaurant would be making more money than if we just split 1 dish, which would have been the alternative. Our waiter took it up with the manager who allowed us to share, which was a plus. However the quality of service we received from our waiter quickly deteriorated after that. We got more service from the waiter serving the table next to us.

The food wasn't spectacular either. Having had many experiences with Americanized Asian food, I can say that the PF Changs meals you buy frozen in a bag are better than Tao. The filet was drowned in a sticky, sweet sauce and didn't taste like filet. The chocolate egg roll had way too much chocolate.

I must have gotten lucky because everything I ordered to eat was delicious (see my pics).  I shared the wasabi-encrusted filet mignon, sea-bass, fried rice, and salmon with udon noodles.  The rice wasn't anything special but each of the other dishes was delicious.  The sea-bass was amazingly cooked and the filet mignon hit the spot.

We had a group of 15 and the service was ultra-efficient and super smooth.  I'm a huge fan of the decor of Tao nightclub, and can say the same holds true with the design of the restaurant (tho it is a bit dark.)  

The servers were super friendly to us and at the end of the night as a perk for eating there, we got VIP stamps to get into the club.  And I'm not talking about ""VIP"" status where you get into a ""VIP"" line and wait another f-ing hour.  At 10PM we left the restaurant and were in the club in under 10 minutes even though a line was building up outside.  Considering I spent about $40 on the food, and entry into the club would have been about $20 anyways...well that's what I think anyone would call a good deal.

If you're going to come and complain about the ""noise level"" take a pause and think about it.  What do you expect from a resaurant sitting below the club (with the same name, mind you).

Tao has GREAT food! its a far cry from Prime. Its hip and loud inside. Not ideal for a romantic setting but highly recommended for those dining with friends. We had dinner reservations at 10pm on a Thursday night but wasn't seated til 10:45 so we hung out at the bar and had a few drinks. The place is packed! Apparently its the cool place to be for a Thursday night according to the host. The men there are very aggressive. My fiance' had to be on me so that they would stay away.

After being seated, we had our food within minutes. They have great service other than the wait which is totally understandable. Everyone is very polite and eager to please. They are also attentive to your needs. Someone would go by our table every few minutes to refill drinks or to make sure everything was ok.

Food is AWESOME and cheap! I had Wok Seared NY Sirloin which was yummy til I tasted fiance's Chilean Sea Bass which made me cry. Im salivating as Im typing right now reminiscing of how good it was. We are both fish eaters because he sport fishes every weekend. Fish dont really impress me til I had this sea bass. I dont know how they cooked it but it tasted like fish flavored butter. Soooo goood!!!! We had the giant fortune cookie for desert and it was awesome! It had fruits around it one of them being lychee. A fruit I havent eaten since I left Manila. Fiance' has never tasted it but loved it! It brough great nostalgic memories of my childhood. =)

The restroom is confusing but theres a very polite guy who directs you where to go. Going to and fro the restroom: ladies beware. Men seem to pop out of nowhere and hit on you. Its annoying when you have to go pee really bad.

A Tao employee was going around giving free wrist stamps for people that ate inside the restaurant so they can go in the club upstairs. We decided to check it out since we're already there. The club was huge but packed! Im glad we didnt have to wait 2 hours in line and pay just so we can be pushed around inside. Great scene for single people looking for a vegas hook-up.

In a nutshell:
Great food and service
Not ideal for romantic dinner
Great for people in groups (pre-game dinner)
Eat at the restaurant if you want to go in the club so you can save money and not stand in  line
Club is great if youre single and looking for a hook up
If youre going there with a date its best to get bottle service so you can have a place to sit and relax",liru_MYVFbAwLl5VB0v1Dw,0,0,4,lCJOKM1uOgx_KnGqqny0JA

Reservation was for 6pm, right before their dinner rush during CES, a very busy time in Vegas.  We arrived exactly on time and the restaurant was almost empty, so there was no excuse for their placing us in the worst seat in the house, directly overseeing the commotion below from the second floor at a narrow aisle where everyone would have to pass by on the way to their tables - imagine an aisle seat on an airplane.  I looked down at the first floor and saw plenty of tables with booths we could have been given, so I was starting to get agitated.  I looked up at the third floor and saw empty tables where we also could have been placed.  Strike one.  We ordered our dinner, a pricey sea bass and an even pricier lobster dish - the most expensive item on the menu at fifty bucks.  My dish arrived and was basically a sloppy mix of smelly spoiled lobster (very obviously not served fresh) mixed with fried potatoes and popovers and a ton of cilantro on top to cover it the way a cat covers its poop when it is finished.  Hers was an overly sweet sea bass slathered in sugar.  I have had to crack open lobster dozens of times in the past but was given the tiniest shell cracker to de-shell with.  Strike two.

So, I thought, this must be amazing food! The food here was no better than your average Pei Wei/PF Changs. $13/a small bowl (less than 2 cups) of vegetable rice is outrageous. We ordered scallops, Sea Bass $39, Orange chicken $28, and coconut shrimp for 4 of us. My husband and I had green tea and the other couple had one drink each. The Sea Bass and the shrimp were the better of the four dishes, in my opinion. The scallops were large, there were 4. They were soaked in a curry sauce, which I did not care for. The service was just o k, although the server said one dish of rice would be plenty, but after each one of us had 2-3 tablespoons, another dish was ordered (another $13)f The bill was probably $230 including tip.

The worst of all was the noise level. There were bunches of girls in short dresses with 6 inch heels scampering upstairs to the nightclub at $60 a head. The noise, oh the noise!

Anyways, the hostess goes ""wait here"" and we're just standing in the middle of this cesspool of weirdo's that actually enjoy being in such close proximity of one another and screaming to talk, just standing there. Eventually she returns and sits us at a table so close to two other tables that we might as well have just sat on their laps.

Unfortunately, Tao's food is nothing to write home about.  Essentially P.F. Chang's with even more offensive interior decor, Tao's ""Asian"" food is basically designed for the lowest common denominator - the Midwestern palate.

Spring rolls were okay.  Potstickers were okay.  Crispy orange chicken came straight from the cauldrons of Panda Express.  Soy ginger salmon was okay - the udon was a bit unruly though.  Desserts were excessive.  What the hell were they thinking with a chocolate-filled egg roll?  A bite guarantees an oral blast of too-sweet chocolate, versus that same blast recreating a chocolate necklace on your clubwear.

But yes, we did get to skip the Tao line.  Maybe a solution would be to pre-eat elsewhere, then just drop the money for nightclub purposes and save yourself the culinary dishonor.",ZhK2xIa4f73JZfua7IP8vA,4,1,2,3NSgRPuT-B95y7EErOJamA

As others have written, it kills me also to write this review. Two stars for the food...

Atmosphere - four stars sitting near the big Buddha.
Service - four stars (possibly got lucky on the waiter)

ALL of the top items were sweet. Even the waiter admitted that was an issue. Squab with lettuce wraps, Spicy Tuna Tartare, Satay of Chilean Sea bass, Chinese five spice short ribs.... 

Us chefs know you can pander to a wider crowd by adding sugar and/or salt to your ""sauce"" and he did EXACTLY that and too much of it. Makes the sauces now ""superficial"" so to speak.

We ate at TAO last July ('07) and found it all a new sort of dining experience.

We had a reservation but still had to wait an hour for a table, the waiting area was overcrowded but still comfortable. The bar staff were very good in fetching drinks while you waited.

The rather 'slutty' waitresses were a little off putting.  Even my husband (who enjoys a good eyeful) said that the whoreishness of the waiting area servers was obnoxious and way over the top.

We got a table right next to the big statue and the candle wall and that was really nice. Our server (luckily not one of the whoreish ones) was really nice and spent a little time talking to us and just being hospitable.

We LOVED the food. A wide range and many different things to try. I think there is something for everyone, if they like the 'out of the ordinary' Asian food.

This (of course) being Vegas and in the Venetian is going to have that little extra price tag, but it was exorbitant and we though it was worth paying a little more for the experience of TAO.

Roasted Shishito Peppers with Yuzu - I loved that garlic sauce.

Alaskan Salmon, Crab, and Avocado Roll -  Perfect little bite.

Salmon Sashimi with Avocado, Crispy Onions, Sweet and Spicy Sesame Sauce - Heavenly.  One of my favorite dishes.

Chinese Five Spice Short Ribs - So tender and packed with salty flavor.

Lobster ravioli - I loved the texture of this velvety dumpling and the mushrooms.

Crispy Coconut Shrimp with Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce - My least favorite dish.

Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables - Another favorite dish.  The fish was so buttery and fatty and moist.

Mandarin Sizzled Fried Rice with Roast Pork - Really good!

Crispy Orange Chicken - I was impressed!  This was no Panda Express orange chicken!

Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon with Tempura of Onion Rings - Wow!  Such tender meat and that crust was like tempura.  

Yuzu Sugar Dusted Doughnuts - The caramel was my favorite dipping sauce.

Now to the food, we started with the Lobster Wontons, steamed and not fried and exquisite. The lobster was perfectly cooked, and the ginger broth was amazing, 5 wontons was a great starter, but left us wanting many more.
I ordered the Wok Seared New York strip, it was seared to  perfection with a nice crust on the outside, yet tender on the inside. The sauce is bursting with strong Asian flavors that are a perfect accompianment.
Tony ordered the Omakase, which is sushi and sashimi and is the Chef's choice. He was thrilled with everything served on the plate.

Food: We ordered a spicy tuna avocado roll and Singaporean noodle paired with tap water, of course. The spicy tuna avocado roll was good, but nothing spectacular for its $17 price tag. The Singaporean noodle ($26! oh shit! ka-ching!) was dry, cold, and boasted of flavors from the far-east...just kidding, more like flavors from the Costco frozen aisle. Since it was my bff's birthday, they gave us a delicious complimentary dessert, which was the best part of the meal...and i would come back here just for that. The dessert was creatively presented as a giant fortune cookie, decked with a lining of chocolate almonds atop a bed of vanilla and chocolate mouse and surrounded by fresh fruits. The ""fortune cookie"" is really a crunchy crepe, which was not too sweet and just the right price (free!). 

We were definitely disappointed with this meal overall, but still had an awesome time because the crowd and waiters were fun!

This was supposed to be an Asian fusion type restaurant but it really lacked in Asian authenticity in terms of flavor. It seemed like the chefs just used different types of sauces  to compensate for lack of flavor which resulted in chaos. 

Fried rice with sausage: Very SMALL portion. Weird ""sweet and sour"" sauce spread over the rice. I would not order again. 

Pad Thai: Lacking flavor. Some type of sweet taste that I knew after one bite, I would get sick of it after subsequent bites. Very unauthentic. I would not order this again either.",gaXdYfTY_u9lOkBju1EIbQ,3,0,1,MogAre5E1yLZs3u5MuzoFA

Very good, perhaps slightly overpriced, (but barely) Asian fusion food.  Gorgeous, sexy décor and lighting.  I had dumplings to start both nights, and veggie pad thai the second night followed by a veggie sampler the second.  The sake braised mushrooms we had as a side dish were very rich on the second night.

The only problem, and it's well-known to be one is regardless of reservations, you're going to wait and even be given a ""buzzer/pager"" -- we waited over 30 minutes past our reservations, though for transparency reasons if you have a reservation in Tao (Los Angles) you're looking at ~2hrs wait time, so while they never fulfill the reservation time it's at least less than LA's wait times.

Food overall very good, no real complaints on the food, I had the seared tuna, rolls, duck, wagyu, sake. Recommended for sure!

___________________________
To my surprise, 4 stars for the food, but an overall 2 stars for the ridiculous way we were charged for the food and how our complaint was handled.  I dined at Tao with a group of 9 for a bachelorette party the weekend of August 13, 2007. Although I was disappointed with Tao, I still had a great time with my fabulous girlfriends. 

I don't remember everything we had, but I enjoyed the Spare Ribs, Lobster Wontons, Chilean Sea Bass. Least favorite was the Pad Thai (one of the worst I've had) and chicken skewers. 

Reason for 2 stars:
After we were seated, our waitress didn't come by for what seemed like 10 minutes to introduce herself. When she came by, she was friendly but did not communicate clearly how she was taking our order. Since it was so loud and our waitress didn't have a very loud voice, 3 different members of our group asked her to clarify how much food she thought we should order. She specifically told us that we should order 3-4 starters and at least 5 main dishes. That took me by surprise b/c I thought this is small plates and how could that be enough food? So I repeated what she said to me just to clarify that 3-4 appetizers would enough food for 10 girls? We decided to just order as much as she recommended and we can order more if necessary. 

When the dishes arrived, we were all suprised at the large portions. What we found out when we got the receipt was that the waitress doubled and tripled each order (as she saw fit) so it would be enough for our table of 9. She NEVER once said she was going to do this and we were upset because we had so much leftover food and even ate more than we wanted so it wouldn't be wasted.

If we had known this is what she was going to do, we would have ordered different items. I can't remember if she tripled any main dishes but the end result was a very large bill and wasted food. 

When we brought this up to our waitress, she insisted she explained it and after she left, she never returned to our table. We then spoke to the manager who said he could only give us 2 drink tokens to compensate for the miscommunication. This is so lame and such a cheap gestere to rectify the situation. The least he could have done was get us into the nightclub for free afterwards. 

I have never, ever, gone to a restaurant where they took the liberty of doubling or tripling your order without telling you. I've always said, I want 1 order of this, 2 orders of this, etc.

I would not go back to this restaurant again. Food was good but not worth the price. 

The club is ok if you get in early but by 1pm it gets too crowded to walk around and check things out. We got free line passes but had to go out, get in smaller line, pay $20pp at the door + get a hand stamp, then headed upstairs to the night club. Seems like a classy place but I find it offensive that they have skanky girls taking baths and playing with each other surrounded by all these bhuddas.",trQfzXd8YMEe-Md-YxnkJw,0,0,2,12YOlyfEmOJRtjVYz0NgcQ
1398446,2018-02-08,1,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"To give one star review it takes a lot. Well, Tao made it. It was the biggest disappointment in my life. I am not a critic, and I don't complain a lot. But this place earned both of them. Giving you a long story will be boring so I am giving you the facts. We spend only 3 days in Vegas, so we tried to make our restaurant ""visiting plan"" and make a list which restaurant we want to visit. Tao was on the list. So, the time has come and we showed up at the restaurant. The waiting was about 20 minutes. After we been escorted to a tiny table, around us a huge crowd of people with big parties. I am talking about party of 20 or more. So we asked a bottle water while we look at the menu, which came. But later it was constantly ruing with the bus boy by refilling our glass with top water, on the top of our bottled water. 
We placed our order, drinks and food. The drinks came in about 10 minutes later, with some free appetizers. The table was so small we had to move al the things around and accidentally my wife's cocktail ended up on the floor.   
She didn't even touched the drink.  The drink never been replaced or we have never been asked if we like to order an other one.  So after we been waiting like 25-30minutes total, one of the dish came. I was like okay, we gonna wait until we gonna get the other dish. After an other 10-15 minutes with empty glasses we decided to share one dish. The dish was nothing special and the portion was small no to mention it was not even our food. Or it was the food what we ordered nut the menu description was different. Well, on the perfect time just right after we finished one share dish, the other on came. Guess what, the same mistake. It was not we ordered, but very very similar. So after total spend almost 2 hours including waiting time, and shortened with $150 for the wrong dishes, and zero positive experience , I am writing this review and hope it will help people to choice  an other  restaurant where they want to spend their money and time. 
I know it could be a lot of questioning elements, like why we did not tell the, busser or the  server what is happening, but like I said, there is more in the whole story, but I don't want to write a book.  I see there is a lot positive reviews about this place, and this is just my experience, but this review is honest, and not a ""payed customer.""",B1hRlx8HIeuArvBpAi1XLw,3,0,1,qMdR-WOnJm_6DOseDphidg
1403494,2015-06-09,0,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"Eh.

The best part of this place is the amazing decor and ambiance. Food is just fine, but expensive (vegas nightclub strip restaurant, go figure!). We wanted to try out tao because we were with a couple of dudes and knew we could get into the club without paying for a cover for the guys if we ate dinner there.

Just FYI, you must get an entree which does not include most of the sushi, soups, etc. if you want free access to the club. I kinda think the rule is crap because I wanted a miso soup and sushi roll and was planning on ordering multiple drinks but was told that it didn't qualify as an entree selection. SO I ended up getting something I didn't want as much and ordered less drinks. I really couldn't win here. My recommendation would be spending an amount per person or per table, but I am not an expert. 

We ordered edamame and tempura shrimp and sweet potato as appetizers. Edamame was SUPER spicy, but I am into that sorta thing so it was good. The tempura was average.For my entree I ordered some special sushi roll with tuna or salmon on top, don't remember. If you couldn't tell the sushi roll was very unmemorable to me. It was average sushi that comes with an AYCE joint. However, this suchi roll was $32! My husband got the lobster pad thai which was presented great, but taste was again average to me. 

The highlight of the night was the giant fortune cookie desert that they bring out for celebrations. It was very tasty and great to share. 

Bottom Line: Probably won't be back if it is my job to choose a place, but the food was edible, in a beautiful location, with friendly servers.",MHCerAmy_1TGc85p4Qr-5A,4,0,3,Gi2mpwhMWbY_-XDmspd5wQ

From the rose-pedal baths to the giant Buddha and wall of antique opium pipes, the whole place just feels like a place you'd want to be seen in.
As far as sushi goes, the rolls left a lot to be desired, especially at the prices they were fetching for them.  At 30 dollars for their most expensive roll, I would have expected a little more.  However, the nigiri was pretty good, and they had some of the best toro (fatty tuna) I think I've ever had.  Then again, I've never really met a piece of toro I didn't like.  
So, it would be a cool place to go, but not the best sushi I've ever had.  Definitely a place to see and be seen, so dress accordingly.",MHDc0L3GB8M-5rxXFpqImg,0,0,3,9zOO6leKKxSvWU53m19yTg

The cocktails were good but overpriced as well. 

The best thing I can say about Tao is the service they are very attentive which I'm sure isn't easy considering how dark and loud it is in there. What makes having dinner at Tao worth the money is you get your hand stamped and don't have to stand in the unbelievable line that is waiting to get in the hottest club in Vegas. Once we finished our dinner we went downstairs and out to get in the no-line, line we waited 5 minutes at the most. The club is insane and I'm glad we went to dinner so we could just walk right in.

If restaurants were all about the environment, then Tao would get 5 stars.  But alas, this is a review of a restaurant, so the actual food is important too.  Typical asian fusion stuff....a mix of a wide variety of asian dishes.  If you don't know what asian fusion is, think about it this way....you can order sashimi (Japanese), pad thai (thai), satay chicken for appetizers (thai), and then throw down some shrimp, sea bass, spicey tuna rolls, kung pao, etc.  Oh yeah, avoid the sashimi....we're talking 4 small leaflets worth for $60.  The food is decent, but nothing special.  The environment goes along way (great place to take your special someone or a bunch of friends)...but the food is nothing to rave about.  Remember, it's definitely on the pricey end.  If you're considering a few appetizers, some drinks, maybe a bottle of sake, an entree for you and your sweatie, and then some dessert to close the deal, we're talking $100 each, easily.

And please, please don't go here just to get a free line pass for Tao, the club.  It's not worth it.  Why pay $100 per person for a mediocre dinner just to get into the club?  And besides, if you're part of a sausage fest, you'll still have to pay cover and still wait a bit in line.  And if you cheap out on the dinner (where your main motivation was to get into the club and it's obvious), the server doesn't have to hook you up.

And once you're in, you're screwed because Tao is geared towards table service.....unless you enjoy being packed like sardines (well I suppose if there were two girls and you.....).  Anyways, think about it...$100 for dinner, $ for cover, and then a whole bunch of $ for drinks. ...and standing the whole time and being very uncomfortable.  Or spending $200-$250 each person for bottle/table service, depending on how many are in your group.  It's a no brainer.

Once my lungs adjusted and I stopped feeling like I was about to have an asthma attack (note: I don't have asthma.. thats how much smokey smelly craziness in the air), the rest of the dining experience was lovely.

I tried both the chilean sea bass with miso glaze and the peppered filet with udon noodles.  Both dishes were absolutely amazing.  When I think of Asian food and beef, I think tough and overcooked.  The filet was so tender and flavorful.  Right after I ordered it, I was regretting my decision thinking that it was going to be mundane and that I should have gone for something more adventurous, but the dish had wonderful complex flavors that took it way beyond what you would think a beef and noodle dish would be.  The sea bass was so flavorful.  I have tried chilean sea bass many times before, and I have always been put off by the flavor.  This was done right, the miso glaze was amazing.

Our drinks were great, our party of four all selected different cocktails so we could sample each others drinks.  All of them were delicious.  My favorite was the Tao Love Potion #9. 

For desert we shared the giant fortune cookie filled with white chocolate and dark chocolate mouse with fresh fruit.  Kind of cheesy, but it was really tasty and the fortunes were pretty funny.

Delicious! Wagyu beef, salmon, fried rice and so much more. We ordered the chefs choice and got to try a bit of everything. It is a LOT of food, so you could probably share it.

It's Vegas, so it'll be pricey. For the quality of the food and service, it's better than some Vegas restaurants, though still on the higher end.

Ambiance:
Really cool, club like. There are the tubs full of rose petals on your way in. There was a DJ spinning old school hip hop. We had to wait for a table because it was packed. The bar is good for this.

Service:

1515039,2007-03-27,4,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"Dined here with my wife over a long weekend and to quickly summarize the experience, we both loved it...everything from the decor, the service, and of course, the meal was top notch.

We booked an early reservation around 5:30pm after being sold on reviews of both the original Tao in New York and this one. 

TIP: Book reservations early since the choice times fill quickly on the weekends. 

My first impressions of Tao's decor looks like money well spent...especially in the details. Upon entry, we noticed tubs filled with water and rose petals...to which my wife replied, Can we get in? I told her, sure ;) It also created an intoxicating scent...or perhaps that was the drinks?

Our table was nicely situated on the second level which overlooked the giant Buddah and coy fish pond. This was a great location since it was above the group tables noise and was quiet enough to have a decent conversation of sweet-nothings and what-nots. My wife also pointed out from this vantage point, you can see down some girls tops...I resisted to look as I felt I was being tested.

Our server, Michael, was tremendously helpful with our dining experience. His fantastic recommendations with the sashimi, the vegetarian selections, and the strong, yet fine Tao cocktails were spot on.

I also liked how the other staff members went the extra mile in making the dining experience special. Our water glasses were always full, and empty dishes were promptly removed. They also gave us a line pass for the nightclub upstairs. This was great in avoiding the long lines even as they opened at 10pm.

Another helpful TIP is the Yin/Yang signage on the restroom doors. Here's a helpful primer...

Yin = Feminine forces
Yang = Masculine forces

Clever, huh?

This took my wife and I awhile to figure out, especially after a few drinks. They even included male and female statues...and the occasional male attendant peeping out from time to time...to help the confused or drunkards.

It is a bit on the expensive side but well worth it. Overall, we enjoyed Tao so much and found ourselves craving the food the next day. I'm sure we'll be back.",5c8J3QvBWg3VIoQ6Be5o-Q,5,3,5,dO892k0119WKBJPdlKCB5g

My interior photo had the flash on so it looks brighter than it actually is, but there were multiple tables using their phone flashlight to read the menu.

So overpriced that the good sushi and rice isn't enough to bring it up to 2 stars. If I hadn't come here with gift cards I'd have been super pissed. The food would be 2- or maybe 3-star material if it was 1/3 the price, because given the quality of the filet mignon in my main dish I promise you it wasn't worth the $40 they're asking. Serving sizes are also small at any price, but especially for the prices they charge.

The filet is actually 7 or 8 very small pieces of meat, maybe the size of a McDonalds chicken nugget. The whole dish is covered in an extremely artificial just-came-out-of-a-box tasting sauce, and the peppers lack flavor. The chicken that my fiancé ordered had potential and she was happy with the way it was cooked, but it was overall ""only okay"" as she says. I had a taste and hated it, but that was just the flavor. Not something I would have ordered. Also, I was probably jaded by my garbage steak already.

We ordered a side of pork fried rice also. This was a semi-bright spot on the night. The rice was very good, and there were a lot of vegetables which we liked. Big fans of veggies. But the pork in the rice was bad. It was small chunks and also tasted and felt like it had come right out of a box and popped into the microwave.

Now the sushi was amazing. I don't remember what it was called but it was their special for the day or week or something, and included salmon, real crab, avocado, caviar, ginger (I think), and a spicy-ish sauce. This roll was absolutely delicious, and I devoured it in like 5 minutes.

As a side note, the service was good. The waitress could have stopped by a little more frequently but it wasn't a big deal overall. She was very nice and our order was correct and our drinks were eventually filled.

I have money left on my gift card after paying $150 for some of the most mediocre, fast-food level, processed tasting, overall low quality steak I've had in a long time.

My friends & I had reservations for 10PM at Tao about two Fridays ago to celebrate a friends birthday. When we first walked in we had to make a line in order to have our IDs checked. It was extremely crowded & noisy as we made our way up the line. Once inside we were given a beeper that would alert us when our table was ready. During that time we were waiting around & people kept rushing/pushing past us to get upstairs to the club.

Let me get to the service & food. After we were seated we had a friendly waiter who suggested a couple of the restaurant's signature dishes. I discretely told him the fact that it was my friend's birthday in order for them to bring out a cake or special dessert for her (which they did - a mousse filled fortune cookie). He was great and started stating some random facts about the club after I whispered in his ear so she wouldn't catch on. So kudos to that. Service all around was AMAZING.

The food was decent. Honestly, what stood out to me was the miso glazed sea bass. I could have ate that & that alone all night long. Everything else was okay from the noodles to the several appetizers we did try out. I can't remember everything we ordered exactly.

If you're trying to go to the nightclub & are in the mood to eat something before hand then you should come check it out for yourself. With the purchase of an entree you don't have to pay the cover charge for the club.

Right in front of me was a guy who cut the line, and did that bribe in hand thing to get a table. I saw it with my very own eyes. The hosts played stupid and pretended that they were returning customers. Please. I know how it is. There was a bar in front and the restaurant was towards the back. Odd to me, to have clubbers and people eating at the same time. Our server was nice and was attentive with everything. The music from the club was pretty good. I didn't imagine myself actually eating a meal in a club type atmosphere, but it was upbeat and something different. The food was okay. Sushi was pretty good. The hot and sour soup was probably the best I've ever had. The lobster dumplings were also very good. The sauce it came in was perfect. The drinks were surprisingly tasty. Enough alcohol for you not to complain about it yet still had the flavors of the drink. Wasn't too expensive, which was good on my pocketbook. The décor was beautiful.

There is a difference between being hip and pretentious, and Tao errs on the wrong side of that fine line.  I can't quite figure out why, but it just doesn't have the same spirit as Buddha Bar in Paris, a restaurant with similar theme.

If you're the most fashionably trendy Asian restaurant on the Strip, shouldn't you have at least one dish that's memorable not for its presentation but its flavor? Nothing was over the top, even my carnivorous friends admitted as much.

Having dinner at Tao gets you easy entry into the club, which was perfect for us since we needed to eat and hate lining up. We showed up for our 9:15 reservation and instead of being seated were handed a buzzer to let us know when the table was ready. I realized this meant there would be a wait so we sat at the bar and ordered two Kirins (the bartender looked slightly disappointed that we didn't want cocktails but it's 2016 and I don't do lychee martinis anymore). The wait wasn't exactly short but not long enough for us to finish our beers. When we were finally seated, our attentive server Mike told us the specials and we were immediately sold on the pastrami fried rice. We also ordered lobster wontons with shiitake ginger broth and Chinese five spice short ribs. I honestly didn't have very high expectations but it was all pretty tasty and we were quite satisfied. We ended our dinner with key lime doughnuts, another yummy special.

Tao has never been high on my list to try in Las Vegas, but I've definitely heard a lot about it--especially since it is both a restaurant and, I believe, a nightclub after dinner ends.  Tao was also featured on the Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate where Duff Goldman selected their satay of Chilean sea bass as his favorite thing in Las Vegas.

Tao is located in The Venetian and it is a big spot with a dark decor (very loud as well).  Tao's huge menu is very modern Asian or Asian fusion with a wide variety of items including sushi, sashimi, edamame, satay, tuna tartare, hot and sour soup, dumplings, spring rolls, BBQ meats, tempura, wok-fried meat, poultry and seafood dishes, fried rice, and noodles.

Everything was kind of okay, but while a few dishes were noticeably better than what you would get at a PF Chang's, a lot of it wasn't (and Tao carries a much higher price tag though part of that is because Tao is in Las Vegas).  We did have a fixed party menu so maybe more freshly prepared dishes would have stood out more though the flavors were not exciting or memorable.

Service was fine.  The food came out at a good pace.

As mentioned, prices were high for a just okay Asian fusion restaurant.

Tao does offer many different dishes and it brings in a lot of customers to make for a lively atmosphere so if either of those two qualities appeal to you, Tao might be worth checking out.  But if you are looking for high quality food or good value, Tao might not be the best choice on The Strip.

Tao Restaurant is located inside Venetian and has such a decadent interior, with red and dark hues and Buddha statues everywhere. I find absolute culinary perfection at Tao Restaurant, and I will be more than happy to explain why.

My three girl friends and I decided to spend New Years Eve together. But what can we do when NYE is in less than 36 hours? Where we go that isn't too far from home, yet not so close? Where can we party til the sunrises? 

SIN CITY! 

*Ding, ding, ding, DING!*

Who would have known the four of us were locked, loaded, and ready to go within 12 hours after saying yes. After three and a half hours of driving, we finally arrived.  we made managed to sweep dinner reservations just a few hours beforehand. After we finished dolling up for the big night, we spent the next hour finding parking at the Venetian parking lot. The staff was kind enough to hold our reservations, even though we were 30 minutes late. 

When we got to the restarant, we were greeted by a female hostess, who seated us immediately. She was HAWT (full blown double dees and a badonkadonk). We were given warm towels to wipe our hands and given menus. We started off with a Satay of Chicken with Peanut Sauce ($10) as an appetizer.

Please do yourself a great favor and order these two items:

- Crispy Filet of Red Snapper with Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce ($29)
- Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ($34)

Both plates were cleaned completely. If I was home alone, I would have licked the plates off. 

Shame on you if you don't try these two dishes out!

In my 23  years of existence, I have never EVER ordered fish from a restaurant because I was born a lean, mean, meat-eating machine. However, after my wonderful experience at Tao, I've opened up my palete and ventured into fish entrees.

One of my friends ordered the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon with Tempura of Onion Rings ($36), which is just okay, but not nearly as delectable as the sea bass and red snapper. I'd have to delete one star for that because at that price, I would expect it to taste better. 

All of the cocktails are $12.5. Try the Blue Zen (Cruzan Citrus, Malibu Rum, Blue Curacao, Pineapple Juice).

The desserts range from $9-12. Our waiter highly recommended the Giant Fortune Cookie (filled with white and dark chocolate mousse). Four people can share this. 

Every bite of the red snapper, sea bass, and giant fortune cookie were sensually pleasing to the palette. The only words we can utter were ""mmms"" and ""ahhhs"" throughout the entire meal. 

I have yet to try the sushi the next time I come here again. Hopefully, it will be soon.",hdLToS_AFNyqUzzcZI7UXw,6,4,4,vuCoovvbcUONCDhEb98ePw

Made reservations on OT 11:45pm, showed up at 11:50pm, and was not seated till 12:30am.  No biggie I guess, we just dranks a few cocktails and people watched at the bar.  

The more attitude you give the people at the host's podium, the better they will treat you.  

The prices of the specialty cocktails were $10-12.  I think that's a bargain in a luxury resort on the strip.  Bartenders were great, they were honest about the flavors of the drinks and warned us not to order certain ones.  

Tried:
Tao-tini, Saketini, Love Potion #9, Lychee Martini, Tiger Lily, & Orange Dragon.  

Portions are pretty tiny here.  So be prepared to spend.

Onion Stuffed salmon sashimi-we ordered a SECOND round.  
Crispy lobster & shrimp dumplings, light & full of crustaceans!!!

Yellowtail sashimi w/jalapeno & ponzu, lacking in fresh flavor

This also happened with the food. But that's not even the worst part. The worst part was the actual food. Maybe I'm spoiled, living in the Bay Area. We have so much great Asian food. Tao just couldn't compare. Not even close. I understand it's Asian fusion, but it just did not taste good.

The appetizers were OK. We had lobster wontons, the tuna tartar, and the chicken dumplings. Of course these were fine, how can you screw up a dumpling. For dinner we had sushi and it was some of the fishiest we've ever had. Just awful. We also had the miso glazed Chilean Sea Bass and it was tasty but I think it was undercooked. About a half hour after eating it, I got really sick. We kicked down like $150+ for dinner and it was as if I hadn't even eaten it. It honestly could have been anything I ate there that made me sick, but I really think it was the sea bass.

So I had the 8oz wasabi encrusted filet mignon. BEST STEAK ever!!! I have eaten at most of the ""Fine"" steak houses in San Diego and one other steak house in Vegas but this one takes the cake. It was so tender and beautifully cooked (medium rare). My friends also had the special of the night (a 12oz Rib Eye) this was also very good and cooked perfectly. We also had the beef shabu shabu pot....it was good but I wish we could have tried the kobe beef...that would have been awesome. Either way I could have eaten the broth by itself.

*The halibut on a skewer. I don't even like cooked fish, but this was salty and so yummy!
*Kobe beef tempura roll. Exactly how it sounds. Pair it with some great wasabi and soy sauce, and you get a bit of a carpaccio feel.
*Pork potstickers. These potstickers melt in your MOUTH!!!

Also had their signature tapas dish -- sea bass with asparagus.  It was a bit salty; we needed to eat it with the roast duck fried rice we ordered to tone it down.  That was the only negative of the meal.

We did not order a main entree but what we did order was the perfect amount for the two of us.  Bill came out to be about $100 and we didn't order any cocktails, which seems about average for a restaurant like this.

Are they mostly Asian? If so, the food will be delicious at an appropriate dollar-per-dollar rate. If not, you are either probably getting crappy take out or are about to get food-fleeced.

Don't get me wrong: the cuisine my fellow Bachelor Party-Goers and I had here, from the admirable sea bass to the wasabi crusted filet mignon was incredibly well-executed and tasty. But while I still enjoyed actually eating the meal in a flawlessly decorated room with its truly hip atmosphere, the ever-present knowledge that I could have had everything we ordered for a fraction of the price at many places in the San Gabriel Valley still sunk the experience.

That's just me though. I think if you're keen on unloading a boatload of money and you also happen to want Asian food in a super-cool environment, Tao could fit the bill. If you want something that's just as special and more reasonably calibrated, price-wise, there are a ton of other places in LV you might want to visit instead.",r4n7y5bYr9BqnOEuresTRQ,0,1,2,k-kD1ccpmxYTsIU5A2KQ3Q

However, if you are focused on the finery of your food, you will probably be disappointed by the excessive use of salt in everything that drowns out flavors and creates one TAO taste.

The hubby & I went here after a show to share a small meal & enjoy the place.
Everything was great.
The only thing I can complain about is that the NY location has (or had .. I don't know anymore because I haven't been in a long time) a bigger cocktail menu which included a mojito menu.

One meat for $25? Not so much. To make matters worse, it's generally pretty bland for the sugared-up type of Chinese food that this tries to be.

2092953,2010-11-16,10,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"Some of you people are ridiculous.  Let me point out a couple of things-

I saw someone who gave this restaurant 2 stars say that, ""I've never eating here, but I'm reviewing their service.""  Then don't even bother posting your review- save us the time and save Yelp's bandwidth.

And to people complaining about the loud music.
Why, did you bring your family there to celebrate your granddaughter's baptism?  Nice, real nice.

Oh, and stop comparing Asian restaurants to Panda Express- it's getting old.

First off, you can obviously tell that I love this place.  Let me tell you why.

Even during the first time I ate at Tao, I didn't expect it to be a quaint and gentle dinner made by a world-renowned chef.  Tao's advertisements have a naked woman with ""Always a happy ending"" tatooed to her back in Chinese.  Seriously, what did you expect?  If you think that kind of lewd advertisement says, ""Bob and Daisy's Kosher Garden Cafe,"" I'll fly myself to your city to slap you.

I came there and got what I expected and a bit more.  Stunning interior design by a NY firm whose design philosophy is heavily based on catering to the audience.  From the dramatic lighting, the 2-story buddha, and the naked girls in the bathtubs at the tunnel entrance- if you think you can take your grandma on her tennis-ball walker to this restaurant, you deserve a second slap.

As far as the food goes, it was fine.  Yes, I could've gotten better food at an off-strip restaurant, but was I there mainly to have the ultimate epicurean experience?  Absolutely not, I was there to eat, enjoy the energy of the restaurant and most importantly, to have fun with my friends.

What, you're gonna give a restaurant who serves amazing food 5 stars even when the food is served on paper plates and they're located in a rat-infested hole in the wall with horrible servers?  Don't be ridiculous.

As far as the service goes, I'll admit- it's not flawless.  They do know a lot about the menu and about Japanese and pan-Asian cuisine, and they're quite attentive.  But the hostesses could be a bit more polite.  You know why they're ticked off by the end of the night?

Imagine yourself as a tall blonde girl with 32C's, getting drunk calls at all hours of the night, getting hit on and gropped by the occasional stranger.. and hassled by the idiot who decided to bring their 3 year old child and needs a baby seat.

Of course, this is no excuse for the management to hire more enduring hostesses, but they don't care.  The money is coming, and they still remain as one of the most highest earning on the strip in terms of annual revenue.

Anyways, you've heard it all.  I love this place because it's a place I can enjoy inexpensive food (seriously, $12 pad thai isn't that much on the Vegas strip), amazing interior, decent service, with people I know who can enjoy it with me.

You want amazing food, go to Joel Robuchon.  But be prepared- I don't think Joel himself will come out to thank your granddaughter for eating at his place on her baptism day since obviously, that's what you expect of Tao.",N1eblziJZ5N4OcO2HYWZFA,10,7,5,mph7c-eHd8ulKqy7m9FV4g

Being a local, I don't really get out much to the strip unless visitors come into town. When some girlfriends of mine came into town, we were very excited about trying Tao. 

Our reservations were for 10pm on a Friday night. We didn't get seated until 10:40pm. That wasn't so bad, since the wait staff was very attentive. Finally seated, the three of us ordered right away and then the wait began. During this time, three other tables around us, got seated, served and left, while we kept waiting. The gracious waitress kept coming by to apologize and the faithful water attendant never let our glasses get less than 3/4 full. We definitely got re hydrated, but were starving. 

Finally, we requested to speak to the manager. When he finally showed up, he didn't have much to say, and didn't seem at all apologetic. The saddest and most ridiculous part was that he blamed the 90 minute wait on The Wok!! Seriously?!! 

This huge establishment should have more than one wok. What kind of excuse it's that? He didn't offer us any appetizers for our trouble and we finally suggested maybe a dessert would be nice.  So, our food finally arrived and I ordered the Duck Fried Rice. I love duck and I'm a kind of a salt-aholic usually, but my dish was just meh, greasy and salty even beyond my ability to tolerate. My friend's dishes were also just ok, but NOT worth the hour and a half wait. 

What if we had tickets to a show or had to catch a flight? Anyway, we hoped the desert would be better, but 30 minutes after finishing our meal, dessert still hadn't arrived. A woman came by offering us stamps to get into the night club, which we wanted to try, so we still had hope. Another 15 minutes passed by, still no dessert, we finally decided it was time to leave.

Then it was time for the night club. What a let down! First of all, much like the restaurant, a lot of people weren't even dressed nice. Packed to the gills, as expected, but the dancers looked bored and were barely trying. Then there were these sad, mopey girls sitting in the cement bath tubs. Seriously? 

The dancers at Hard Rock are so much more entertaining. I was sad. Sad that my great expectations were crushed, sad that my girlfriends had this same lame experience on their first night in Vegas. 

Maybe you need to be blind drunk in order to look passed all these short comings and hoot at the top of your lungs. Maybe that was were we went wrong or maybe Tao jumped the shark.?",SmebMhNXiBW052kgGyIDIQ,2,1,1,Gp3by-4OMXgT7GeWB9hX9w

We dropped about $400 on dinner (we were celebrating and had a bottle of Veuve).  

After dinner was over, we said we had reservations for the nightclub, the entrance to the club was literally 20 feet from our table.

I would say majority of us ordered the sea bass and majority of us would say, it was damn good! We also ordered a family style dish of some fried rice and that was good too. I was amazed at how good the food was. Quality of the fish was excellent. My only gripe is the portion we all got. It's not a big portion.

I ate at Tao with a group of 8 people - family and friends, all a bunch of young adults in our twenties. We ordered family style (many plates in the center of the table to share), and in total, we destroyed 8 delicious dishes and a beautiful dessert smorgasbord. Every single thing we tried was delicious. I am spoiled in that my parents take me to nice places on occasion, and Tao is at the top 5 of my list of best meals I've ever eaten. One friend who ate with us said - and I quote, ""This is probably the best meal I will ever eat in my life."" I am going to New York this fall or winter and plan to eat at the Tao restaurant in New York with my boyfriend. You can expect to hear another review on that restaurant soon. 

My favorite dishes of the meal we had include: 
- The flavorful 28 days aged new york steak which melted in my mouth
- The miso glazed Chilean Sea Bass which tasted like it was injected with the best sauce ever created. Every bite gave you a gush of flavor, and it was cooked just right.
- The Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll with Edamame which came with a not-too-spicy wasabi dipping sauce.
- The delicious mixed sashimi platter which had a wide variety of sashimi including fatty tuna. 
- The gorgeous display of desserts (also ordered family style) which came with a hilarious and delicious giant fortune cookie and sweet dipping cream. The fortunes were Vegas-themed and made us laugh. 

The atmosphere was nice and our server, Jeffery, was amazing. He always came at the right time, promptly filled our glasses, and was extremely helpful with the ordering process. He was absolutely hilarious, and super friendly. His language is what puts him over the top. The way he described the food as we were ordering was something from a movie or commercial. He used 2-3 descriptive - and one would even say seductive - adjectives for each dish. It's hard not to order them when he describes them that way. My brother put it best when he asked Jeffery, ""Could you please describe the food to me like that as I'm eating it?""

-Sushi:  We shared a few rolls for appetizers and they were good, but definitely $$ for the portion.  We had a spicy, crunchy tuna roll and something else with yellowtail; like I said, good, but I've had better at Sushi Wabi in Chicago.  

-Drinks:  Sake martini, waaaaay too heavy on the vodka.  Left a stinging sensation in my mouth and not in a good way.  The other tini's were on the sweet side.  

-Dinner:  We had peking duck for two...MUST try.  It was tender, flavorful and a great portion size.  Friends had chicken curry, nice and spicy and chilean sea bass, also delicious.  I thought the entrees were all reasonably priced, especially for Vegas.  

-Atmosphere:  Lots of typical d-bags yelling ""Vegas Baby!!"" and lots of typical chippees in slutty outfits (us included).  But overall, no complaints.  We were seated on time, the service was efficient (our food came out really fast!) and $110 per person (dinner for six, split 5 ways for b-day girl) seemed like a pretty good deal for as much as we ate and drank.",mi9bNGzbfPD14WzWog6w5g,0,0,4,URPiTeaNEN5l3gxn4D60SQ

2162947,2018-04-23,0,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"Tao did not not disappoint. The atmosphere was wonderful, but more importantly- the food was phenomenal. We ordered a bunch of appetizers so that we could have a taste of everything. The most memorable food items consisted of: 
-The shishito peppers and mustard sauce. Amazing taste and not overly spicy. 
-The chicken satay and peanut sauce. They were so good that we ordered a second plate. 
-The veggie rolls. They were big and very filling. Definitely not a standard small egg roll that you find at a PF Chang's. 
-The molten cake and salted caramel. The caramel ice cream definitely made this desert worth it. 

The restaurant was also kind enough to bring out a huge fortune cookie dessert in honor of my birthday which was also amazing. It was filled with a chocolate and vanilla mousse.

In terms of the service, our server was extremely friendly and attentive. He helped us pick out our alcoholic beverages, which again were beyond our expectations. 

Everything was great except the following:  

1.) There was a man (possibly the manager or some wannabe security guard) who went around with a microphone/headpiece giving updates on table availability. He made us feel extremely uncomfortable and rushed. I understand that this restaurant is in high demand and busy. However, we felt like the experience wasn't enjoyable because we were being pushed out so another party could sit down. This gentleman AKA wannabe security guard approached our table and asked us how our food was, BUT he didn't do it in a way that made it sound like he actually cared about us or the food. He constantly kept hovering over our table and I found myself annoyed. Also, keep in mind that we were only at the restaurant for one hour. 

2.) The bus boys kept sweeping up food remnants off the floor every five minutes (when honestly there was nothing to even clean up). It was excessive and made sitting down unpleasant. No offense, but when I'm eating, I really don't want someone sweeping next to me or even underneath me. If you want to get technical, those dust particles are traveling in the air each time you sweep. Therefore, they could have quite possibly made it onto our plate. From a sanitary perspective, wait until people leave the table. 
On top of that, the bus boys kept clearing our table when we weren't even finished with our food.  At one point, we snapped at one of the guys as he was about to take our plate that we weren't finished with. 

A word to management, stop having your guys go around rushing people to finish their food. I really liked the food, but quite frankly- the constant hovering, sweeping and clearing of the table made me not want to revisit this location. It shouldn't be about how many people you can cram into your restaurant. If we wanted fast food, we would have gone to McDonald's.",-ypNrWX4v4wzBK6OB-OPlg,2,0,3,MgkeRCaruoH3spNS748ffg

I ordered the curry noodles and they were salty and the noodles are way too thin, not to mention it was extremely over priced (along with pretty much everything on the menu) I mean c'mon 26$ for a little bowl of curry noodles? 

Super dark and SUPER LOUD. It's pretty much like eating in a night club. You have to yell at the person across from you for conversation. 

I went with a large party maybe 15 or so people. When the check came out we simply asked for it to be split up. The waiter literally looked at us as if we were asking him to juggle chainsaws on fire while unicycling on a tight rope. 

He said it would take some time to split it up, pretty much trying to convince us not to. He took roughly 35-40 minutes to split the check. Seriously? C'mon. If the local Denny's can split a 15 person check with no issue why can't your hip modern upscale Asian restaurant do so too?

We had reservations for dinner here although we knew that despite having reservations there would be a bit of a wait. We sat in the nice lounge and looked over the drink menu until the hostess led us to our table.

We had a nice booth on the left hand side of the large Buddha that dominates the room. I definitely liked the décor (although it does take some getting used to the dim lighting).

DRINK RECOMMENDATION:  I love the Tiger Lilly...Ketel One Vodka, Chambord, and Pinapple Juice. The Tao Love Potion # 9 is also supposed to be a big hit.

To start, I ordered the Kobe Tartare Tempura, which was absolutely amazing. First, make sure to note that appetizer portions (at least where our meals were concerned) were huge, and I was pretty much full after it. The flavors were so bold and exciting and it was an amazing start to my dinner.

For my main course I had the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass. It seemed to be what most people recommended you order.  I do not like seafood in general, but when you go to places such as Tao, which are known for it, then you have to just trust that it will help with your misconceptions. And it really did. The sea bass was amazing...very light, flavorful, and not fishy at all. It was perfectly cooked on a bed of vegetables and had a very nice flavor profile.  Sadly, I couldn't even finish it!

For dessert...I believe it's an off the menu thing...but the Giant Fortune Cookie is a must. Depending on the number of your party, they'll put the appropriate amount of fortunes in it...most of them being sexual in nature and quite funny!

After dinner, we waited for the manager to arrive so that we could get our hand stamped in order to get into Tao Nightclub without waiting in line.  All in all a great meal with some amazing food and flavor profiles!

P.S. The bathroom is definitely interesting. While washing your hands, make note if you look at the gaps between the mirror and the sink, you can peer into the men's restroom and even see men standing by the urinals. It was so random yet funny at the same time. ;)",DD9y38PieYPDdhPwnVDfjg,0,0,5,I-Ia5Oexh7UPTrcpCzntFg

We were quite tired and hungry from all the walking, so all we wanted was a place to sit, relax, eat, and drink. Tao seemed like the pretty obvious choice since we were staying at The Venetian, but we were definitely wrong.

We walked into the dimly lit establishment and we were greeted by 3 individuals at the door. As if the doormen didn't scream ""pretentious"", we just had to walk in to find out more.

One of the hostesses walked us over to our table and said that the waiter would be over shortly. We waited, and waited, and waited and waited until my boyfriend looked at me with pity because I appeared to be very thirsty and no one had come to take our drink orders after 20 minutes! This is beyond ridiculous, IMO, especially when there were about 3 waiters circulating in our area. As he grabbed my hand to pull me out of there, a waitress came by (in the nick of time), to say ""oh, where are you going?"" when we proceeded to say ""we were just about to leave"" when her slew of apologies came flourishing out and we felt obliged to stay. At about 25 minutes into our stay, we finally received our glasses of water. 

That night, I decided to order the chicken pad thai while my bf had the crispy orange chicken. Our waitress put a rush order in for our food and we were served in less than 15 minutes.
Pad thai- flavorless and watery. It almost felt like a pad thai soup. I thought letting it sit for a bit would cool it down and let the sauce thicken, but that didn't help
Crispy orange chicken- it was good, but it wasn't amazing. 

Our waitress then decided to go on break and left us waitressless. We asked about 3 people for our bill because we had had enough, but it wasn't until 15 minutes later that we finally received our bill.

2235984,2014-09-18,8,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"I had a pretty good experience at Tao, and would recommend people check it out. I'd maybe give it 3.75 stars.  Here's a random collection of thoughts, along with a really cool story about what happened to me here!

Service: my waitress was cheerful and pretty cool. The people at the front, however, along with the reservations girl, were aloof in the ""too-cool-for-school"" kind of way. Also, this place doesn't give current wait time if you call and ask them, which is unnerving (is this a problem specific to Vegas?).

Atmosphere: 5/5. This is where Tao earns its stripes. It is a truly beautiful restaurant, with a big golden Buddha resting in the center of the restaurant, framed by lots of red booths and dark lighting. Think of it as a PF Chang's on steroids. Beautiful inside!

Food: Nothing to write home about, about on the level of PF Chang's, but still pretty good. I tried their Orange Chicken ($28), with white Jasmine rice ($5), and it was fairly tasty (though I wasn't blown away). I also had the vegetable egg rolls ($12), and those were pretty good as well, but again not mind-blowing. 

Story 1: I came here alone (I was in Vegas on business, and no not that kind of business), so I kinda felt like the guy in forgetting Sarah Marshall who comes to the restaurant, where Jonah Hill says ""aw dude, you came alone? Do you want a magazine or something?""

Story 2: Also, I ran into multi-billionaire, and Venetian owner, SHELDON ADELSON right by this place. I looked him right in the eye, he looked me in the eye! And then he looked away, and I felt poor.",i5Ssj6oUIQtq8-uEcpLvDw,2,0,4,m1-QSgvH_xlagD0uFNJS9g

We were trying to figure out where we could experience some fine dining, and we kept seeing signs for Tao at the Venetian. Right as we walked into the beautifully decorated walkway, I felt like I was stepping into a glamorous nightlife scene from a movie. There were floating rose petals on each side of the walkway lit by candles. 

Of course, there was a wait, but it was expected. However, instead of just standing around trying to pass the time, we sat down at their lounge area where we were waited on by a cocktail waitress. We ordered a few drinks before dining while snacking on their complimentary wasabi peas, and before we knew it, our table was ready.

Their decor deeper into the restaurant was even more impressive than the front of house. Behind me was an open sushi bar across from a wall displaying artistic pipes featured inside multi-colored backgrounds. In front of me was an enormous statue of Buddha surrounded by more candles.

Our service was EXCELLENT. Since it was our first time there, our server really wanted to give us the full experience. He was very suggestive without being pushy, so it made our ordering much less difficult. The only thing that kind of threw us off, was when a new server took over without our being informed. The service, however, remained top-notch. They were anticipating our every need.

The pad-thai was good, the Shiitake mushroom tempura was delicious! Best tempura I've ever had. The desserts were creative and aesthetically pleasing. Definitely stop by if you want to make your trip to Vegas a memorable one.",I0q3HXP_yGkR3fyNyL2U8g,0,0,5,_qOhi08xBTN5LjbKUbkLAQ

Also, one of the waiters spilled about a cup of soy sauce on my girlfriend. It wasn't hugely exciting when that happened.

However, the food is really good. Lots of great options for all sorts of tastes, the service was prompt once we were seated. You can't really go wrong with anything you order.

The pad thai wasn't anything extraordinary.  I personally like the pad thai that I've had at San Jose with many ingredients.  Tao totally skimped out on us..which brings me to the shrimp tempura. So, when we ordered the shrimp which was $8, we expected there to be at least enough shrimp for the eight of us. however, when the waiter brought out our order, it consisted of two shrimps on a tiny platter. They weren't even prawns, they were those small tiger shrimps that you can buy in bulk at your local asian store for $8 a pack! Ridiculous! We expected at least four pieces of good sized shrimp but for a tiny cocktail shrimp?? No, that was a waste of our 8 bucks.  Lastly, my favorite has to be the eggrolls.

He replied that pretty much everything on the menu is made with MSG, and gave me a few options that would work. This is really puzzling to me. MSG is typically a substitute for quality ingredients, and a cheap way to add flavor-what is it doing in $30 a plate Kung Pao Chicken? I wasn't overly thrilled with the selection offered to me, and ended up ordering sushi. $90 (for just me!!!) and a not very full stomach later I was wishing I had just ordered some white rice and grabbed some pizza or something on the strip. The sushi place up the street from my house is better (and better priced). None of my friends' meals looked spectacular either; I felt like I was at an overpriced PF Chang's.

-Spicy tuna on crispy rice
-Lobster wontons
-Sea bass skewers
-Toro sashimi
-Salmon sashimi
-Mini donuts for desert

The thing that amazed me about this place is that the food is worth eating.  The dining room is a scene AND it is enormous.  It is quite a feat that the kitchen is able to keep up with the dining room considering how large it is.

2. Thai Crab Cakes with Mango Chili Sauce
- best crab cakes I've ever had. Crunchy outside, such a wonderful crab flavor with a tangy & spicy mango chili sauce. 3 to an order on these. ($18)

3. Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth

Unaccustomed as I am to the wayward excess of wesson cooking oil, cryogenically frozen hamburgers -their flesh revived after 5 years of roaming the Mc pastures- and a forced-entry of Harsh Browns-shirts down my esophagus, for the everyday equivalent of a Nazi Spandau prison breakfast, my antibodies capitulated and allowed the stomachal aches to begin their bombing. I decided to tenderly call it ""the blitz""

This necessary intro will frame for you the picture of my everyday routine in Vegas; as I made my way for the Sands expo center at the Venetian, and with the imperative need to eat some breakfast and lunch. It was not until Friday, after a party at said hotel's poolside, that I finally had the opportunity to sit down at a real restaurant, where I would have at least, real food (the rest of the evenings, btw, dinner was served in a bottle with lime) Enter Tao:

Oh yes. Finally some tranquility, some posh, some xanax imbued zest! My muscles relaxed the moment I sat at the couch. My pancreas wept alongside my saliva centers as soon as I blinked through the menu options. I refuse to pejoratively call ""drooling"" what clearly was the act of tender weeping. The why? Crispy Spicy Tuna and the lusciously fresh Salmon in a sweet (but spicy) sesame sauce and incrusted with crispy onions. Naturally, I enjoyed every bite of these dishes with unabashed contempt to all cuisines under the tyranny of wesson oil, and with unabashed praise towards the butcher's dexterity of the sushi liberating chefs. Kudos.

As I made my way towards the bathroom, I noticed that Tao offers an expansive seating area to accommodate many refugees like myself, and when I also saw the stairs that led to the TAO nightclub chamber, I couldn't help but feel how the imposing pictures of the monks and innocent children that loomed in the walls in front of me, where in fact, severely bent on scattering my sinful wishes aroused, or perhaps to manipulate them by whispering in a nomadic tongue: ""Its all-ight, we approve!"" And so that you know that monks never lie, Tao offers to stamp a comp admission to the TAO nightclub above in your pumping wrist, only and if you have dined in the zen establishment. Watch the horror and astonishment of the serpent-like queue as you breeze by them and re-enter for the club scott-free (yes, they make you exit, and re-enter through the VIP line in order for you to undergo a quick ID inspection. Sorry toddlers!)

So I have no problem bowing to the wisdom of the Tao Te King, and acknowledging that ""Tao"" is indeed ""the way"". Do come to this amicable speck in the midst of the chaotic Vegas strip Taiji to replenish your Yin, and by all means, your Yang waiting for you upstairs.",-sZsovkOVzZVhke3fxrbtA,8,10,4,y2UNZzOqfwa_6SctPsK2Kg

#1 TIP: GET THE MISO GLAZED CHILEAN SEA BASS. Just do it. 

Here's what we always get:
- Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice
- Lobster Won Tons
- Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass (with wok vegetables)
- Grilled 12 oz Kobe Ribeye (with Yuzu Cilantro Butter)
- Wasabi Crusted Filet (with tempura of onion rings)
- Giant Fortune Cookie (with white & dark chocolate mousse)

This is the best sea bass I have ever had. We have come back to Tao time and time again because we love this dish so much. The fish melts in your mouth and falls apart beautifully. The Kobe Ribeye is amazing-- tender, perfectly cooked, seasoned exceptionally. I am very picky about how my steaks are cooked and they cooked this wonderfully-- rare and delicious. 

(If you don't want to pay $85 for the Kobe steak, the wasabi crusted filet is a wonderful option. They do a great job seasoning and cooking it.)

The restaurant has a dark, sexy vibe that we really enjoy. It's classy, upscale, and intimate. The whole atmosphere is impressive to say the least-- words really don't do it justice. The entrance to the restaurant has giant baths filled with rose petals, there's a 2 story tall Buddha... It's over the top and makes it a really memorable spot for dinner.

I also before the apps and drinks were ordered notified the server of the time constraint and she said we were going to be fine. 
 Our drink order was taken and within 15 min or so had the apps and sushi we asked for. It ALL went downhill from there. As we ordered apps we also ordered entrees. I timed and it took 45 to 50 mins to get med rare seared tuna and crispy orange chicken. These item normally shouldn't take that long to cook if there are no large parties. I've worked in food and beverage service ,so I know. Not once during this wait did our server walk by, apologize or offer excuses or even offer complementary items while we waited. I don't EVER expect a comp in a place this fancy...but money or not, they wasted my time.  Finally after the server came back by I grabbed her attention and demanded the manager. 
  With five minutes til show there was no way we would be able to scarf down, get the check and make it on time. The birthday dinner, and show were ruined. I ended up telling the mgr how this was a special event and that I had warned the server and hostess of our timeline and even asked if they could serve us in time or if we should come back. He offered a bottle of champagne and dessert. In tears I asked if I could just call him tomorrow if we ever decided to come back. He gave his card and apologized. 
  We made it to the show in the nick of time. Later the next day I called the mgr and asked if we could just have our same dinner again, to which he agreed. ***** edit, I paid the $150 tab from the night we ate there that night and still left a tip of 15%***although I DO not feel it was deserved, I will never stiff a server.  Turns out dinner was lovely, relaxed and delish. We did add the mandarin sizzle fried rice above the original order, but got the complementary bday fortune cookie to make up for the prior night. The Entire tab was comped. I tried asking the mgr to let me at least buy the rice so I could tip the new server but he declined and said he hoped in November we'd visit the Tao in NYC since we told him we were going.

 The Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass
*Located in the ""From The Sea"" section of the menu

Oh my gosh, the sea bass.... This would very likely be my last meal on Earth! The sea bass is usually prepared to the perfect melt-in-your mouth consistency with a subtle miso glaze that delicately balances the flavor of the fish. On a few occasions it came out slightly overdone and they happily sent out another one.

Salmon Sashimi with Avocado, Crispy Onions
*Located in the ""Special Dishes"" section of the menu

This is one of those genius dishes that seems so simple until you take that first magical bite. The combination of texture and flavor is mind-blowing. The salmon sashimi, avocado, and sweet and spicy sesame sauce flavors with just a hint of crispy onions brilliantly balance each other like like a symphony of flavors in your mouth! 

After you finish your incredible meal, Tao will send you off with a naughty little fortune cookie. And if you're lucky, maybe it will come true ;) Hey, it's Vegas!

So do yourself a favor and check it out. If you have a night of clubbing ahead, you can usually get escorted into the nightclub upstairs from your table.

Tip: If you're just a small party of 2-3 and they don't have any reservations available at the time you want, you can usually just head back to the sushi bar and get a seat right away.",ffLooZHI-2l8aEYcz4-vhw,1,1,5,DHecdCPGYbAf5HWTTF9UYA

My niece had the lo mein and she said it was the best lo mein she's ever had!  Overall it was very tasty, but have had asian food that's tastier in Houston... The scene was very cool and the customer service was just ok. everyone was nice, but for what the meal cost i expected better service and more attention.

Only two people had a coke, without being offered a refill.  We had some bottles of Corona on our tab.  Corona?  Do people even drink Corona after the age of 18???

Highly recommend for a group dinner, as it provides funky and hip ambiance and decor and excellent food and service. As previous reviewers note, it's on the expensive side, but Tao is not the place to go for a quick and cheap bite in Vegas.

I ordered the tuna tartare with peppercorn sauce - one of their signature dishes. It was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. Their wine/sake list provided lots of formidable pairings (I chose a Sauvignon Blanc). Several others in our party had the wasabi-encrusted filet mignon, but frankly it wasn't that impressive. It was served with tier of fried onion rings and lacked anything memorable in terms of taste, although it was cooked perfectly.

A significant bonus of dining at the Tao is that you get a line pass stamp for the nightclub, although the process of getting into the club was not quite as seamless as we expected. (Separate review for the nightclub).",FhtE0K-iqMoeQlm0OEcmQA,1,1,4,ai8Vk3PkiiKIGj06bJZ_wg

2535995,2011-01-16,0,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"Wow....This place is WAYYYYY overrated! This is coming from a Chinese San Franciscan who has had her fair share of real Chinese food and the attempted crappy Asian fusion foods.

So a few friends and I made reservations two days in advance and this is how it works; if reservations are made they call us the day of to make sure we are still coming. I thought, okay they wanna make sure so when we come by they have a table ready for us....how spiffy. Was I wrong! We all got there 5 minutes before our expected arrival hoping to get some food and then head to the club upstairs. To my surprised, we get a pager and we are told to wait until a table is ready in ten to fifteen minutes. WTF?!! We confirmed earlier that we will be there and we come early and we STILL had to wait?!?!? Mind you that we have not eaten and we are all starving so, we were pretty frustrated....and after fifteen minutes....no pager action so we head to the front and ask when we will be seated. The host looked flustered and told someone to lead us to the table. Wow such ""wonderful"" service and it doesn't end there.

When we finally got seated (also I was looking around when we were taken to our seats....there were plenty of open tables), I looked through the menu and decided what to order in like 5 minutes. I kept a timer near by me because I saw how much the waiter was passing us and it took them 20 minutes from handing out our menus to actually take our orders down. 

When we finally got our food, the only good thing about it was probably the plate it was on. I ordered the Thai roasted chicken. When I ate my first piece of it, I realized that the chicken was dry....not the way I like my chicken to be cooked. In addition, The chicken was coated with a ton of very sweet sauce. I tried using the sauce to moisten the chicken up but the sauce did not complement the chicken. I was very disappointed with that. I even a bite from my boyfriends food...Meh it was alright.

My overall review for this place, we came in at 9 and didn't leave until 11 due to waiting for service to come by. I think we spent probably a good 75% of the time just waiting. So what do i say about the service, that IT SUCKS! The food was not worth the taste or the price.

Good cocktail selection. Entrees were good, I have to deduct 1/2 star only because I felt my dish, the Hong Kong Shrimp, was lacking something to give it that wow factor. but that's a small, snobby detail.

(not instead, but TOO!). luckily, he always has a small appetite, so we got to share!  perfectly cooked salmon, too. not dry at all, or bland. from what my brother said, the shabu shabu was also really yummy, and the broth that it's cooked in is nicely flavored.

not only was the food great, the service was incredible. people kept asking us if we were enjoying ourselves, and our waitress and waiter were not rude one bit, which made my cousin's 30th birthday so special for her. they recommended the dessert sampler, $65 for a variety of desserts (a HUGE fortune cookie, chocolate mousses, molten lava cake) and they stuck a sparkler in there so we can sing happy birthday to her. she loved it! and it fed all 14 of us. the desserts are fabulous! our party spent $845 a good amount of food, a couple bottles of sake, and a bottle of wine. not bad at all, in my opinion. i will for sure be there the next time i'm in vegas!",HODTFattOBq84VBncNfUCg,0,0,5,Wy9wdUN2-IJfKftP1VpFXA

The large floating Buddha over the infinity pool and décor create a great ambiance that is inviting and appealing. We celebrated my husband's birthday and had a group of 9. The restaurant was busy as is expected on a Saturday night but once we were seated, the staff treated us as if we were the only client in the restaurant which made the night special. 

Daniel waited on our party and he was extremely kind and accommodating, especially with dietary needs/ allergies of one person in our party. Being our first time at Tao, I asked for suggestions and he was very knowledgeable on the menu. He made fantastic recommendations throughout the night. Amongst our favorites were the Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice which combines the soft tuna with the crispy rice which work very well together; lobster wontons which had a welcomed complexity in flavor; and the miso glazed sea bass which was light, flaky, moist and so flavorful. I should also point out that the plates are family style portions for sharing which allows for interaction and great conversation. We had several dishes throughout our meal, wait staff were constantly removing empty plates, so our table never felt crowded or tight, our glasses were never low and they were there when we were ready for the next course. 

Food was outstanding, presentation was memorable and the service, superb!  The GM, Matt was beyond attentive and came by several times to make sure everything was perfect.

We walked right in got a table pager and grabbed drinks at the bar. We sat at the cute little booth and chatted for less than 5 minutes when our pager started to buzz. 

We were seated next to the giant Buddha water fountain. Very nice decor! I ordered the Crispy Orange Chicken which was delish and my gal ordered the Black Pepper Filet Mignon with those yummy Udon Noodles add a side of rice and call me satisfied cause I liked it! 

We asked our waiter what time the party started and he said sorry ladies no party on Tuesdays. Boo! But he was nice enough to offer stamps to their sister club at the Palazzo Lavo (more on that later). 

After we ordered our server kinda disappeared and then we got a new guy who brought out our food and then the bill. We had to ask about the Lavo pass again. The manager came over and stamped our hands and that was it. This server weirdness is minus one star in my book.

It was already crowded with people at the lounge having drink while waiting for their own table?? There was 3 of us for dinner-2 guys and myself.  We were lead toward the back and seated at a table close to the sushi bar. Before you read any further this review is truly dedicated the service and to our waiter vs. the food.  In celebration of my birthday we ordered a bottle of the yellow label and Voss Sparkling water. After reviewing the menu, I asked the waiter what recommendations he had, and even though we ended up not getting anything that was mentioned, I thought it was great that he had extensive knowledge about the food.  We ordered:  Satay of chilean sea Bass with grilled asparas, Wasabe crusted filet mignon with tempura onion rings, Duck friend rice,Noodles and Short-ribs.  The food honestly was mediocre for the price that you are paying.  There are so much more comparable quality food here in SF  that don't cost and arm and a leg.  Needless to say I wasn't too disappointed as my expectations weren't that high, and I was paying to be part of the scene.  Now Kudos for the service, the waiter was extremely courteous, came at the right times to offer service,and always made sure that glasses were always filled.  I'm a lightweight and only drank a glass of champagne, I thought it was wonderful  that he was so observant and only filled up my companions glasses and only towards the end of dinner did he offer me more.  and lastly because there was a male to female Ratio at the clubs, even with a $300 dollar dinner I still wouldn't have been able to get in, he worked the magic and got all 3 of us line passes for the club because it was my birthday.

The waiter was an A-HOLE big time.  Before we ordered he YELLED AT US that he REFUSED TO DELIVER ANY FOOD UNTIL THE MENUS WERE ALL REMOVED FROM THE TABLE - basiclaly that means we can't get appetizers and order more later...Jerk?  Seriously?

Second of all, the food tastes like either Panda F**king Express (all noodle dishes) or it's completely covered in Sesame Oil.  Don't get me wrong - I LOVES me some sesame oil - but not when you can't taste what is is cooked with?

Finally, I think our bill was like $700, probably because we had 8 heavy drinkers there.  But it really felt like a rip - I paid $70 for drinks, one egg roll, and a bite of some Mall court noodles.

At least they serve late night dinners but the food and decor really didn't impress me.  

My BF actually found the big Buddha offensive, arguing that Americans would be appalled to walk into a American restaurant in China that had a huge Jesus towering over the dining room -- which totally makes sense [though I can't say I was bothered by the Buddha].

We ordered several things two of which the waitress recommended some sort of spicy chicken, which was not good -- how can you recommend this?! And the kobe beef appetizer -- which was one of the better items.  We ordered a couple more items to satisy our drunken appetites but I can't say all and all it was any good.

Really with all the hype around it, I expected something more, anything more than what we got and it wasn't cheap either.

Mainly because I was expecting it to come out on sand. The name is a bit of a deceptive creative concept for alluring the diner to a more upscale price point. What came out was a clay pot. Something I can get in Chinatown for a fraction of the charge. Ordering rice? Upcharge. You mean steam rice does not come with my food? I am not a tight spender by any means, but 5$ for a bowl of steam rice that customary accompanies an Asian dish? 

Since I was myself, I had to take a seat at the bar. That means if you, like myself, wanted the Wagyu or Filet Mignon Shabu Shabu...it will be an impossiblity. Understandable. 

Ordered a sake flight and it was probably the best thing there. 

Outside of the ambiance, I'm not sure what the appeal is to dine here. I mean, unless you like your dining environment so loud, you can hardly hear yourself think...feel free.

First of all, the decor is beautiful, albeit ridiculous. A restaurant called Tao, filled with numerous Buddha statues including the nearly twenty feet tall one in the main room, large photographs of sumo wrestlers in one dining area, and large color photographs of Buddhist priests of varying ages decorating the hallway to the restroom, and the overall opulent decor? Not to mention the crowd of tourists and revealingly dressed beautiful and less beautiful people. Not sure this is what Buddha intended but overall a very beautiful lounge and restaurant.

We had a reservation (thank goodness; the place was packed) but had to wait about a half and hour. We got a drink at the bar. Yes, well drinks were expensive but not surprising for Vegas. Once we were seated, we had a nice view of the gigantic Buddha. Our server was very friendly and informative. I felt in general the waitstaff was attentive, even though the restaurant was so busy.

As appetizers, we ordered the lobster dumplings in shitake mushroom broth, spicy ahi tuna on top of crispy white rice (basically like nigiri) and the toro toro roll. The dumplings and broth were excellent but the skin of the won tons were a little thick. The spicy ahi tuna was yuuummmy. The toro toro roll was the weakest dish. The fish was not very prominent, which was disappointing since I love toro. This roll was also topped with some sort of crunchy, sweet cracker-like topping that I did not love. 

We also had two entrees: the black pepper flank steak and udon noodles, and miso-glazed sea bass. The steak and udon noodles were okay; nothing special. The miso-glazed sea bass was delicious and perfectly cooked. The vegetables it came with were somewhat of an afterthought but the sea bass was so beautifully cooked that I didn't care too much.

Definitely a fun, vibrant, LOUD environment. Overall, I was impressed by the quality and flavor of the food and I enjoyed the atmosphere.",vSTi9G85c5c8RNPFIEMETQ,0,0,4,DDsLsw8VnayHLfOg7cprFg

Like many of the other reviewers I had made a dinner reservation (far in advance) for a Sat night dinner. The best time we could get was 10:15. After waiting in line for the ""reservation check-in"" we were told they would call us when our table was ready and they gave us a pager. Well wait we did. We didn't get seated until and hour later! What kind of restaurant operation takes reservations and then makes you wait an hour anyway? That is really poor front of the house operation. 

FOOD: The Shabu-Shabu Filet was terrible. It tasted like they had left the raw meat sitting out for hours. The green beans we all ordered tasted like they drenched them in fish sauce, and I could tell that they had not changed the oil in their fryer in quite some time as the spring rolls (both appetizer and dessert kind) tasted like rancid oil and were too hard to bite through! Not one person at our table commented on liking their food. 

The wait staff seemed to be attentive but that was only the first time our waiter came to the table. After that time we had to try and find our waiter to flag him down. When it came time to pay and we were obviously done for quite some time, he was nowhere to be found. Even worse, three of us paid to have sparkling water instead of just tap water and when we were about half way done with our glasses, someone actually came around and refilled them with with tap water! If you are going to hire people who can pay attention or at least ask the question, then maybe you should serve your waters in different glasses since there are three options.

After our mediocre and ridiculously overpriced meal we went to go to the club upstairs. They came around and gave us stamps at the table that would allow us access without waiting in the long line and without paying. When the first person got to the front of the smaller line he was charged entry for two to get in ($50!!). Immediately we said, ""wait we don't have to pay"" Instead of being able to credit him back for the charge or just giving him cash, the manager came over and gave him drink tickets instead. He acted like he was being soooo nice by giving him and the girl he paid for a ticket and then a second one each. What, 4 drinks for $50, not including tip?? Geee, thanks so much for the generosity. To top it all off, the club sucks. Cheesy, bad flow and really bad air flow. We decided to go up the Tao Beach instead to get outside and that was better as far as being able to move around and breath, but the cockroaches running around were a bit of a turnoff.

The entrance to TAO is a dark tunnel with pools with rose petals, so purdy! We sat on the main floor in front of the budda. 

I was pleased to see they have a couple of my favorites. The dragon tail spare ribs, and the sandpot! The waiter asked if we have ever been to TAO before, which I responded of course! I asked if he had any favorites, and he liked the coconut shrimp. Like a creature of habit I went for my favorites. The coconut shrimp is an entreé but we ordered it as an appetizer. It was so good! The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the coating was crispy. Next we got the dragon tail ribs! They were so good and meaty! They were so tender you can eat them with a fork! When we were received our sandpot I noticed something strange, no lobster?! I asked the waiter and they prepare it a little different then in NYC. They de-shell the lobster and let it sauté in the garlic sauce. Either way it was still delicious. It was also a plus not to have to work at my food LoL.  So in good TAO fashion, its dessert time! You can not go to TAO and NOT get the fortune cookie! So good! It's a giant fortune cookie filled with vanilla mousse on one side and vlchocolate mousse on the other, and served with fresh fruits.

The maître'd was perhaps the most obnoxious person I've ever experienced on this planet. Even with the reservations, we were told that we could expect to wait about a half hour. When our buzzer rang 20 minutes later that maître'd angrily told us that it had only been 20 minutes and that our signal had certainly not gone off or went off in error.

I hang with a pretty yuppie crowd back home and I'm typically prepared for dealing with the posh and pretentious crowd that frequents Tao and places like it. What I was not prepared for was dining in a night club with staff that was even more pretentious than its already pretentious clientele (and I fairly count myself amongst them).

Tone down the music and fire half the staff (our cocktail waitress was great), and I think Tao would be something special. As it stands, the maître'd spoiled my dinner long before it had arrived.",hcjoqMOx8h_HPshRmh8fcw,0,0,1,YTJT4xROEbCrsr3-hfCCOw

I wasn't too thrilled it was being celebrated here since I don't remember having an awesome experience before. Restaurant is a bit cramped, but they do cater to very large parties. I wasn't too bothered by the lighting being dark, but I could see how it would bother other people who actually want to see their food. As for the noise level, it's located in a club, so expect it to be above normal. None of this really bothered me, it's the actual food that gets to me.

If I'm going to dish out $$$ for food, it better be spectacular. And Tao did not deliver. I ordered the sizzling rice with Peking duck. For the price I paid, I could have just made that myself. I also got to sample the other dishes my friends ordered, and I was not impressed by any of them. The highlight of the night was the dessert platter which I thought was yummy.

The Chilean Sea Bass was a popular dish at our table (aka Patagonian Toothfish which is currently over fished and should be avoided by all chefs and consumers!)

My husband ordered the Wasabi Steak it was surprisingly mild, but good.  Additionally ordered was the Shabu-Shabu, the presentation was quite nice and after eating this multiple times recently in Japan I felt that it was translated nicely.

The short rib appetizer special melted in your mouth, and service was on point all night, explaining the specials and checking in on us frequently. I had their specialty sea bass in a miso reduction over braised vegetables. At first it didn't wow me, but the more I ate it, the better it got! Very good dish. 

Everything our table ordered was outstanding, and I would love to come back to try their sushi and specialty rolls.

I was disappointed. My friend got sushi, it was really good. My other friend got swordfish it was good. I got chicken and while it was good (you can't mess up chicken), it wasn't worth $25. For $25 I got a thigh and half a breast of chicken and... and what? That's it. Fine dining at it's best... I don't get a side of veggies or rice or tates, just chicken. 

Maybe I don't understand the whole realm of fine dining, but why would I pay $25 for a piece of chicken that I could definitely cook better at home and not get anything to compliment it? 

The decor was nice and all but honestly, it's a little too dim in their for me. Sure, it sets a mood blah blah blah, but I'm not going to be in any mood but seeing an optometrist after I have to strain my eyes looking at the menu in dusk-like light.

Located at the Venetian, which is like a LEGO-land comprised of the Gritti Palace and the Royal Danieli with St. Mark's and the Grand Canal thrown in for good measure, Tao is a Buddhist temple amid this garbled baroque mess.  

You will need reservations here and expect to have a drink at the bar, which isn't all too bad considering the loads of eye candy hanging around, as if they are apart of the scenery, so you will be sure to see something that you like.  Take the opportunity to order a Grey Goose and soda, sit on one of the couches, and look at all the hot Asian broads w/their raven tresses and wasp-thin waists, and the European bitches in their Milanese high heels and tossed-boob salad exploding out of their wrap-dresses.  Yes, yes, tres chic, I know. 

The dining room is dim, crowded, and there's a thousand conversations going on at one and the same time.  Not sure if I'd come here for a ""special occasion"" type of dinner, as in ask your girl to marry you or to tell your mistress you're married.  Our waiter was cool, reminded me of a SoCal dude, like he'd hang out in Venice Beach.  

For dinner we started off with the spicy tuna tartare and kobe beef shashimi - both were to die for (the tuna was crisp and crunchy, and the kobe beef was like eating Kobe Tai, go figure).  With our main course (we both got the miso glazed Chilean sea bass) we paired it up with the lobster and kimchi rice (again, an excellent choice). 

I'm a sake novice and was open to suggestion: we started off with the sake sampler, and with our dessert got the sake dessert sampler, I believe, and me and my bud both agreed that the cloudy Voices in the Mist was our least favorite - I walked out of here a bit rocked.  For dessert we opted for the giant fortune cookie.  

In the end, $244.00 for two before tip, which, in my opinion, isn't bad at all considering what we got.  Will definitely make it here again and do our best to revitalize the economy.",8eQ7LmOK6KeSRXq_o8KaAw,0,0,5,r5EU0wDD9t6OXP36dt2DSg

Granted, it is a Friday and reservations are not an exact science - but this restaurant was certainly well overbooked. It would appear they are more concerned about making sure the restaurant is at capacity than customer experience. 

We were seated around 9:35 PM. After complaining that this was unacceptable, the host picked up our first round of drinks. 

Once seated, the noise level in the restaurant makes talking next to impossible. I felt myself yelling to communicate, which I am sure perpetuates into an even louder restaurant. 

We had ordered a king crab roll. It was mediocre at best. I have had thicker crab meat at the buffet across the street. And for this price ($18 if I recall correctly), I am sure 50% of the price was paying for where I was eating. 

The highlight of the meal was the dessert. We had the yazu trio donuts. They were delicious.

Arrival was swift, I anticipated a wait based on prior Yelpers experience, and received the Olive Garden style beeper then shown to the well decorated and seductively lit lounge with quite a view of the gussied up Vegas party-goers.  

After about twenty minutes, my dining companion and I received our table with a round of drinks on the house due to the wait.  Way to go on the customer service Tao.  I had the Tao-tini--A+ my friend the Tao Cosmo.  Both smooth and easy.  

The food--ordered in portions and had wonderful dishes:
Spicy Lobster/Crab roll excellent
Steamed Veggie Dumplings--needs extra dunking sauce yum yum
Dragon Tail ribs--ok could have done without
Crispy Rice Tuna Tartar--OMG, could have 2 of these
Hot Edamame--fav.

Dessert was over the top:  
Giant Fortune Cookie exploding w/ chocolate mousse VERY rich, so be warned
Rice Pudding Creme Brule w/ extra scoop of ginger ice cream!  Just like mom used to make back south--right.

We went there to experience the hotel Asian cuisine a few weeks back, and I have to say that Tao was one of the best we've had in our lifetime.

After ordering tempura to start, we followed with a kobe steak, kung pao chicken, and lobster gyoza in a mushroom truffle miso sauce to die for. The tempura was light, flaky, and melted in my mouth. The winner appetizer, however, were the lobster gyozas. The sauce was incredible, the lobster was sweet and the dumpling part was so soft and perfectly chewy. The entire dish was well balanced to the point where I wanted to drink the broth! The steak was so soft that a knife was unncessary, and the chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked. Our server was quick to refill at every turn, and there was so much to eat, dessert was not an option.

Once you've finished dining, your waiter will usher you past all the line-losers to gain your rightful spot amongst the beautiful people.

It's there you'll wonder why, after six vodka and Red Bulls, your 'buzz' more resembles a Sunday afternoon on the couch than the dance party you'd hoped for.
Well duh, you just ate enough food for a small village in the Sudan.
On the bright side, you didn't have to wait in line.

Avoid the 'family' meal experience. The bill was a stack before the tip for 8 of us. 
Stick with the sake bombers instead. 
Tao has a unique device that cleverly drops six shots into six beers simultaneously. It's so fascinating, you'll want to try this at least a dozen or so times.
Don't forget to shout out some Asian babble as you salute the Emperor or else the bombers have very little effect.

What do you think of when you think of Tao, besides Winnie-the Pooh, maybe a pathway or a philosophy of the true nature of the world? Tao restaurant located in the Venetian has found their ""pathway"" through their food. 

Unbeknownst to me, Tao is one of the hottest places on the strip. Not only is it a restaurant but a lounge, banquet hall, a club, and celeb hot spot. I guess I know how to pick them! What I like is that the service treats everyone like royalty. The service here is insanely fast and they have more then enough staff on hand. We met one host and then got seated by another, then our server, a water guy, a guy that brings out food, and then a guy that takes it all away. The decor was insane too, dark rich colors, all kinds of fabrics, very bold and very detailed. Of course the 16 foot tall Buddha stands out just a little. 

The most impressive attribute about Tao is their food. Tao specializes in Hong Kong Chinese, Japanese, and Thai cuisines. I know it's a lot but this location is huge so they room for it all. The crispy Tuna roll was unbelievable and all it consisted of was fresh tuna in a roll with a crispy outer ring of something (they wouldn't tell me what is was). Vegetable dumplings and veg egg rolls were surprisingly filling and were perfectly cooked. Of course you have to get something tempura, I recommend the asparagus, it wasn't greasy at all, we loved them. So for dessert you have to get the Giant Fortune Cookie (it's almost the size of your head), yeah it's cheesy but it's filled with white and chocolate mousse and you won't be able to put your spoon down. 

Other then the drinks Tao is relatively cheap, at least compared to most of Vegas. But even if it wasn't Tao is worth the visit.",ETpvceVRtVLjhDEgugFieg,0,1,5,BpzrKzaoiCl22P8G6MEqNw

I made a reservation several weeks ago for 8 pm and they made us wait for 45 minutes.  Once we got seated, it took another 20 minutes for them to take our order then we waited another 20 mintues between appetizer and the main courses.  When my friend complained, the waitress responded by saying, ""I was trying to time it right,"" then proceeded to bring out the rest of the remaining dishes (all six of them) in one shot!  

Gratuity for a large group is automatically  added at 20%, so I got the impression that  they take no pride in taking care of their guests once you're seated.

My rankings are the following: 
Service: one star
Food: two 1/2 stars

The Chilean Sea Bass and the New York Strip steak were decent.  The potstickers were average.  The noodles and the XO string beans were over seasoned and soggy.  You can get better Chinese food elsewhere for 1/4 the price. We paid $57 per person.

Bottom line is you pay for the ambiance mostly at Tao, but the food is mediocre at best.  A dinner that should have taken 1 hour and 1/2, took 3 hours due to poor service and lack of attention.

The food: I ordered the wasabi crusted filet mignon with tempura onion rings.  To be honest, I could not taste the wasabi much and the onion rings were a bit too dough-y.  The filet mignon was not very flavorful so I don't know if I would order that again.  The other dishes my friends had were delicious, especially the chilean sea bass and the buddha chicken.  

The drinks: My friends ordered lychee martinis and they were quite good.  I'm not a fan of sweet drinks but it had the perfect amount of lychee in it. 

The dessert:  get the giant fortune cookie!!! 

The service: It seemed like the waiter only forgot my things.  He forgot my drink... then he forgot the limes for my drink... other than that he was alright.

The layout:  the tables are VERY close together so it was annoying to keep bumping into the backs of people's chairs or have the waiters/busboys bump into the chairs.

 * Spicy Tuna tartare on crispy rice: One of my favorite things I ate at TAO. If you're afraid of spicy food, this wasn't too spicy. I enjoyed the textures and flavors this dish provided.

*Squab lettuce wraps: delicious and easy to wrap.

*Lobster wonton: I thought the wonton was overcooked, which had that ""mushy"" texture. Pass.

*Miso glazed Chillian Sea Bass: Another favorite dish I enjoyed eating. I highly recommend this dish.

Our bill at the end of our meal came out to $45 for 13 of us. Although the food was enjoyable, I personally thought that it wasn't worth $45.

There seems to be differences in opinion in the Yelp reviews whether dining at Tao gets you a free pass to get into the Tao Club. My understanding is that if you order an entree then you (males and females) get into the dance club for free. People also seem to have experienced differences in whether they have to leave the restaurant and then stand in a line to get back in, or if they are allowed to go straight in. On the night we were there (Friday), we had to go outside the restaurant and then stand in a somewhat short line to get back in.

My date had the wasabi crusted filet mignon, which came with onion rings and a few greens. I tried a piece of his steak and it was a really tender, delicious filet. Our table was a group of 8 in total, and there was a special occasion to celebrate, so we asked what they could do -- they ended up bringing out a special sampler dessert for the table, replete with sparkler, and even wrote a message on the plate in chocolate sauce, as we'd requested.

Refer to Friend?: I would. However, one of the most important reasons of dining at TAO during MDW is the ability to enjoy the nightlife aspect of TAO right after dining (free and speedy access into the club section if each one of the party members orders an entrée from the dinner menu).

It is just as good as the reviews claim it to be. Buttery and tender sea bass that melts in your mouth with a delicious miso reduction.

I also loved the Spicy Tuna Tartar bites served atop Crispy Fried Rice. There were 6 of them on the plate and the spicy aoili-like sauce on the plate was fabulous. 

Looking for a good bang for your buck?!? Try the Squab Lettuce Wraps, which are delicious and plentiful. We comfortably fed a table for six with them as an appetizer and asked for more lettuce ""shells"" to stretch them even further. 

Ohhhh if you are trying to go big, ordered the Wasabi Encrusted Filet Mignon with Tempura Onion Rings. The beef is super tender and the wasabi seasoning on the outer edge is unique and incredible. The beef was also cooked to the perfect temperature.

I would skip out on the satay, the sushi, and the chicken dishes. They are just so-so and I feel like that is when people walk away feeling ripped off.",cOGbzvLV1MjtADrD7nkVHw,5,2,5,GgAq6Y8Xg4SRvHhSGVuQrg

the inside looks really nice. giant Buddha statue, waterfalls...and half-naked sumo wrestler posters. that certainly was appetizing

the chicken potstickers were good, but $10 for 5? I guess that's Vegas pricing for you...and for my main meal, I had fried rice with duck, there was not as much meat in the dish as I would hope a $14 bowl of fried rice, although it was fairly tasty.

they have a lot of sake on the list, as well as house specialty drinks. I'm more of a beer guy, so I was pleased to see Kirin and Asahi on the list.

call ahead of time for reservations.

I'd go back next time I go to Vegas, but maybe go for lunch and see if it was cheaper. I was still kind of hungry after the meal.

here's a nice touch - if you go for dinner, you get a stamp to get into the nightclub without (a) waiting on the normal uber-long line [instead you wait on the slightly shorter long line] and (b) paying [not being a nightclub person, this was good].

perhaps I'm just jaded from living in NYC and having large amounts of Asian food available for cheap all around me.",DHRupjFv4GyD0tEdj-QNjQ,0,1,3,MMnB6Wfxu1I26uPZ5TkAlQ

Currently: sat down at table. Server greeted us and explained the family style menu, walked away and said she was bringing menus. Why can't you bring the menus initially? Server tended to other tables bringing them checks, etc. Waited 15 minutes before we got menus. 

Food was mediocre. I was with a big party so I let everyone else run the show. I would never on my own order crispy rice and tuna.

PROS- I don't know why I'd think of a place I'd have to *find* something good to list - when I clearly would never return...but here goes: .... uh....nice decor.

CONS - the worst dining experience I've gotten in my life and I've been around the world, at every level and star of restaurant. I am also a very good tipper. I've been known to tip people exorbitantly when I thought service was good. But I left a $0 tip. Why?

- Can you say ATTITUDE? Waiter had zero eye contact, zero smile. He buried his face into his notepad and had his pen poised to take our orders. What would you ladies like? When we were too slow to answer (a few seconds, I'd say), he trots off with a huff ""I'll give you a few more minutes""...well thank you for doing US the favor. 

- I asked him to leave the drink menu behind, did he? No. He actually *snatched* it off the table. Good thing, too...the martinis were $13 and SUCKED. I could have made better in a plastic cup. I am glad I didn't order any more. 

- The food: $26 for a skimpy piece of salmon on a bed of Japanese udon noodles. It was tiny. Salty as hell. I tasted my companion's meal and it was so salty I couldn't eat it all, neither could she. It gave me diarrhea the next day. 

- We asked for separate checks but at the end of dinner, got one tab.  I asked another waiter about it and he turned his nose up at me and said ""we don't do separate tabs here""...sheesh, well EXCUSE ME. I told him I needed my tab for work, compliments ala United States Government and he changed his tune a bit, so we did get two separate tabs in the end, but not without attitude.

Other Cons: 

- loud as hell. Welcome to dining in the equivalent of someone's car with the stereo blasting.

- front desk staff = zombies'

We would have at least ordered drinks and  appetizers but there was no service in the waiting area. The waiting area was blaring with loud EDM music, not at all conducive for dinner or lounge talk and definitely scared us a bit thinking that the club would be the same. Meanwhile, troops of people with questionable attractiveness and boldly comfortable physiques would trapes in every few minutes heading over to the nightclub area. We were already on the guestlist for the party but having had good history with their sister company, Lavo, we wanted to try the food first,  but in these moments, both the dinner and club scene here were so off putting. The night started off quite weak. Once we were seated, after 12, finally the service came pouring in. At least 3 or 4 servers came to our table to excuse the slackness and eager to be of service. Nice view of the big Buddha statue in the center. Food was decent, we enjoyed the pan fried chicken gyoza, the lobster wontons and the rock shrimp lettuce cups were ok, we kind of got full off of just appetizers cause again, large portions. My cousins miso sea bass entree was good. Strong miso flavor, but if you're cool with that, its good. Big portion of chicken pad thai by someone else. I dont like pad thai or peanut tastes so i didnt taste it but she enjoyed. Looked big and fresh. I split the shrimp, lobster, scallop in bean sauce entree with someone else because it sounded big and also to cut costs and have more things on the table to taste. Was really looking forward to it, it has all of my favorite meaty chewy seafoods. It was shockingly bad, dont know if there was an error made in the sauce recipe, but I have had plenty of similar dishes in the past, never have any been half as bad, and it came highly recommended by the waiter and was amongst the most expensive so we were surprised that it was so bitter. The table tasted and agreed that the sauce had an unpleasant taste. The waiter took it off of our bill gracefully and we left a great tip in exchange. In this moment, the great service that we are accustomed to from Lavo, was thankfully shining through here at Tao as well. A nice chick came to our table to stamp us and set us up for the complimentary club access.

Let's say this first: every restaurant in Vegas over-salts their food, because it's part of the bigger plan to drink your face off.  Knowing this, I can't really complain about how salty the food was (which it was), because that's just sort of the foundation that Vegas sets for you.

My coworker and I shared steamed dumplings, a sushi roll, and an order of the pad thai chicken.

...it was all REALLY delicious.  I was honestly pretty shocked.  I come to Vegas about 4 times a year for work, and I've managed to eat at my fair share of restaurants on the Strip.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.

We also got an excellent table in the back of the room, but I think that's because a coworker called ahead to her contact at Tao for us, since she'd done a reception there recently.  Not sure if that affected our service, but the waiter was very friendly and chatty.",sE20ljFFImmOLuhNTYHDqA,1,0,4,7s8od5XFJYDLSxPmenZQ8g

My boyfriend and I failed to get into the nightclub the night we arrived, but he wanted to give their ""Spiritual Dining"" a chance, so we ate dinner here the night before we left.

Tao is huge. And I love their asian-themed decor. But it looks like it'd be impossible to get a seat without a reservation. They just get THAT much traffic, and we still had to wait about 10 minutes before getting our reserved table. Our server Darren was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu and specials. There were LOTS to mention. Just like Sushi Roku, we discovered that it's customary (at least in these fine dining places) to have two servers: one to take your order and check-in, and the other to bring you your food and drinks.

It took us forever to order, but because it took us 5 mins. to figure out we had to close our menu to order. Lesson learned! I started off my appetizers with an Orient Express cocktail ($13) with Kahlua and Vanilla Liqueur.  My bamboo steamed vegetable dumplings (which were green!) and crunchy cucumbers (Japanese style, bitter like ginger) for $10 satisfied my grumbling stomach quite well. 

My main was Buddha's Harmonized Vegetable Feast for the Minor Gods, which was an entree-sized udon in sesame & black peppercorn sauce with red pepper, onions, bok choy, asparagus, and brussel sprouts to top it off ($17). A vegetarian feast indeed. The dish came in a bowl which made it less messy than it probably would have been had it come on a plate, but I wasn't expecting the amount of spice. Still, a great veggie entree (maybe the only veggie entree!).

Tip: The restrooms say ""Yin"" and ""Yang."" Yin is for the women and Yang is for the men. 

Darren offered us a menu of ""temptation"" which was the right word for it. I could barely get any more food in my stomach so I wanted ice cream. And I got to choose 3 different scoops: White Chocolate & Yuzu, Cocunut, and Green Tea with almond cookies and even Pocky sticks ($8) - bonus. The thing is, I think the Yuzu (a Japanese fruit much like tangerine) was overpowering the white chocolate, or else they were two separate flavours and they brought me the wrong one. I couldn't finish the scoops anyway, because we also got two chocolate fortune cookies!

The Vegas magazines say this restaurant is only a $30 meal, but we spent about double that including drinks, appetizers and dessert.

Tao Restaurant is truly a religious dining experience as they say. You probably have to be the type to appreciate asian food, the 20-foot buddha fountain, and the ancient pipe display on the wall, but I'm glad I dined here on my trip - it's a restaurant like no other I've seen in any of my travels.",TgMG5riWMqGlZTspSDh_kA,0,0,5,mT44eG4-PsEMt1wNw7XzfQ

An enormous Buddha statue in the center of the restaurant and an almost converted warehouse feel in the back feel a little disjointed from what you see when you first walk in, though.

The weird warehouse section is where two of my friends and I sat for dinner tonight. We tried the bubbly blueberry sake which I have to admit was not my idea, because seriously, that sounds *^%*# gross. However, I was really surprised by how delicious it was. Sweet and effervescent with no real sake taste at all. I was pleasantly surprised.

For dinner, I ordered two sushi rolls. The mountain spring roll was good but I do wish I would have been told it was served on a wasabi sauce before ordering. I also ordered the spicy lobster roll, which I would just rate as ok. The sushi here was decent, and definitely better than most of what I can find in my landlocked home state of Kansas, but I have to be honest when I say I've had much better sushi not only on the coast, but in even in Vegas. 

For dessert one friend and I split the molten chocolate lava cake. The box you see in the picture is chocolate shell and when you break it away the molten cake inside is much smaller. The taste was good but nothing outstanding or memorable. The cake was served with a salted caramel ice cream which was super salty. I stopped after one bite but my friend finished the rest, so it might just be an acquired taste.

The wait staff was attentive and the water glasses were kept filled. My major complaint was that we were sat by the entrance to the kitchen and my chair was repeatedly bumped into and hit by servers walking by. This was really distracting and even caused my purse to fall off the chair and hit the floor twice, so I kept having to bend over and pick it up again. For this level of meal and this level of restaurant, I would expect to not have endured that distraction.

I've heard a lot about Tao so I'm really glad I tried it out, but with all of the other great options in Vegas to choose from, I'm unlikely to return.",-hYYjAXSAa657rY0ANtTGQ,0,1,3,vN-RWB7hEPuHRN4MEOWFUw

3266465,2017-06-25,0,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"Flat out, we were disappointed on our first dinner at Tao. First, the design of Tao is engaging on a Vegas-scale. Pretty over the top, but in a good way. But what was plain weird was the music. They actually had a DJ during dinner, and he was playing what felt like exactly the wrong kinds of music, like something that could work well in a Hard Rock restaurant. 

The food was not at all memorable, and mine was far too salty - and it was a noodle dish. It seems they put the most effort into not offending anyone with any of their food. It reminded me of PJ Changs, but a bit more expensive. They call it Fusion. I call it cop-out.

Their Tao hot tea blend was very good.

This one really got me. I asked for hot bean sauce, a staple at any real Chinese restaurant. They had nothing hot on the table, but was told all they had in the back was Sriracha. I love Sriracha, but in this setting, their own sauces should've lead the way. All we saw was a typical sweet sauce and mustard sauce for dipping; neither were better than average. 

The last thing I have to mention is the waitstaff. Everyone was nice, but maybe too nice. It started to feel a bit like Disneyland. Our primary waiter (I think there were four assigned to our table) sounded more like a used-car salesman than an informative waiter. And another waiter just started talking with us, picking up a conversation we were having privately at the table. They're trying far too hard.

We're not going back. These guys really need to start living up their own hype. It all feels so old-school.",8R2oDevdldMmafBogKYm4g,0,0,2,8SCBZ_jOIa99_h8GXUF7Dg

The dimmed lighting and red interiors make this place feel super lux. 

I called that same day to see if I could make reservations for 8:30 on a Saturday night and they were completely booked. However we were able to snag a seat at the sushi bar around that time. 

I hope went with the chicken gyoza and the Buddha's harmonized vegetable feast. I really would have preferred soup dumplings as I am not a big potsticker fan. They were good, but didn't blow me away. Now the Buddha's harmonized vegetables were my favorite. You get a pretty nice sized bowl of vegetables and udon noodles tossed in soy sauce.

What could be greatly improved are the service and the food. Service is painfully slow, and food is so far removed from Asian it's laughable.

The portions are also ginormous so you either let half your meal go to waste or leave completely gorged (take-away is impractical, for obvious reasons). One plus in the food department was presentation: the plating, like the decor, is faultless.

We already sent the check back once cause of an inconsistency, and we were rushing out the door to a concert, so I just looked to see if they included everything we ordered as opposed to how much they charged.

Did you ever play Roller Coaster Tycoon when you were younger? Well, if not- in the game there are custodial workers that you can pick up and move over to any mess you see so they can clean it up right away. This is pretty much what that guy was.

Our server was Lawrence who was an absolute delight from beginning to end. Great humor and a lot of fun. I recognized him from an unfortunate episode on the Kardashian's reality show. Lovely lovely guy. 
We started our meals with an array of delicious appetizers. The standout was the Lobster wontons with shitake ginger broth. My friend and I practically licked the bottom of the bowl. Unbelievable. 
Two of my friends ordered the steak which they both LOVED. The steaks came with three huge and gorgeous onion rings. Great presentation. My other friend ordered the sushi which was a hit as well. The entrees didn't hold as much interest to me as the appetizers so I ""settled"" on the coconut fried shrimp with spicy Thai peanut sauce. I asked if I could get it not fried but told I couldn't. I think it is because of the volume of guests they have each night. Disappointing as I would have been perfect if not fried. I was only able to eat two of them before it was just too much. I felt such a waste to leave all that food. The portions are very generous. 
We finished the evening by sharing an order of the sugar coated doughnuts that came with vanilla and dark chocolate sauces and a caramel one as well. My one friend would not stop talking about them so even though we were full we had to at least try them. Again we licked the bottom of the plate!! What a fabulous way to end the meal.
The food and the ambiance were both outstanding. To top it off though was the service. Everyone we interacted with was just so friendly and professional.

Guard: Excuse me Maam, you'll need to go all the way outside to get in line. You can't line jump.

I look out at the entrance which was only a few feet from me and there's still no one in line.

Me: Umm there's no one in line.

Guard: I know that but you can't line jump. My manager won't have it and I'll be the weak link.

So begrudgingly I go outside. There's another guard at the entrance. He proceeds to tell me that it's a $20 cover to get in.

Me: What? I was just in the restaurant and they told me to come out here to get a stamp. I have dinner reservations here and just want to drop something off in my room

Guard 2: Well if you have dinner reservations you'll have to get in the reservation line to get a stamp.

Me: I was in the reservation line to check in and they didn't give us a stamp.

Guard 2: Well that's where you'll need to go

I stand in the reservation line. A guy is yelling at the hostess letting her know that he's been waiting 50 minutes for a table, and they had reservations too. The hostess wasn't giving in and the guy got angry, threw the pager at her, and yelled some obscenities.

I proceed to tell my story to the hostess and she tells me that she has to get the stamp girl to come over to give me a stamp and I have to wait. My friend Kelly comes up to the desk because we've been waiting for a while for our table. Kelly talks to the hostess.

Hostess: Oh right, you had a table for 4

Kelly: No 8. You guys called this morning to confirm

Hostess: 8? Oh... well then you'll have to come back in 5 minutes and then I can tell you what's available.

Kelly: Why can't you tell me what's available now? We had 9:45 reservations and it's 10:20 now.

Hostess: Just come back in 5 minutes and I'll let you know what's available.

kelly and I are upset but because we had a group of girls for a bacheleorette and they all wanted to go clubbing, Tao was the best option because we get dinner and the club included so we decide to proceed with dinner.

I then proceed to ask the hostess again about the stamp. She says that I need to finish my dinner before I can get stamped. UGH!

We finally get seated and eat our meal. The food isn't that great. I've gotten better at normal $5 chinese restaurants. The waiter brings Kelly brown rice instead of white. She mentions it and he says, ""Don't worry I won't charge you for it."" 

At the end of dinner, lo and behold we were charged for the rice. Kelly mentions it and tells the guy that he said he wouldn't charge.

Waiter: I don't remember saying that. Since you ate it we have to charge you for it

Kelly: No i mentioned it to you and you said you wouldn't. That's the reason I ate it

When we arrived, I told our server that I have celiac disease. We were informed that several of the GF menu items actually do contain gluten (barley). If menu items are not fully gluten free, they should NOT be listed as such. It is false advertising.

Our server tried to tell us ""there is a difference between gluten free and celiac"" -- how ridiculous. If an item contains gluten, it should not be listed as gluten free. Period. I have eaten at countless high end sushi restaurants and have never encountered anything like this before. Highly unusual.

On top of that, the service was slow and unprofessional. We were brought chilled saki instead of hot as requested. Which wouldn't have been a big deal, but it took 10 mins to get the server's attention after the mistake. The server was defensive when we brought up our concerns and then argued with my partner as to why he brought the wrong drink, instead of just offering to replace it with the correct one.

We spoke to the manager and then went to a different sushi restaurant at Caesars, which was incredible and has tons of GF options. The Tao manager offered us free appetizers and drinks upon our return... but we won't be back since my only appetizer choice is edamame. No thanks. It's 2017 - it's unacceptable for a sushi restaurant of this caliber to not have allergy-friendly options.

Ok enough of my antics I will preface my review by saying this.

Dear Angela, you are a fantastic bartender/server! Thank you for making our experience at Tao Bistro amazing! 

Anywho onto my review of the food.

Chilean Sea Bass (small plate): 
Absolutely mouth watering. Full of bold flavour and can easily make you want more! This sea bass is so flaky and since its done right succulent as well. If you've never been into seafood this dish will definitely make you a believer that yes those swimmers in the deep blue are definitely worth snatching up and being prepared under Tao Bistros watchful eye.

Get It!

Chinese Sausage Fried Rice:

I was a little wary of this dish just because Chinese sausage has always kind of put me off. Why I guess it's always been a little funky but whatever I figured since it was so highly recommended we'd give it a shot. Topped off with a fried egg we mixed our little rice dish together and well it was simply delicious. The rice for me was a little overcooked but with the flavors that were put in place to make this little side dish so stunning I looked passed it easily. Once again Tao bistro serves up full blown flavour with this dish. 

Tao Bistro definitely stands by that go big or go home ideal with its choices in flavour s used in their dishes. A respectable trait in a restaurant.

If you're in Las Vegas make you're way over to Tao you definitely won't be disappointed.",LUlKtaM3nXd-E4N4uOk_fQ,0,0,5,YK9w2Dhq7SsUTq-m0XYfyQ

I enjoyed everything I ordered. From the sweet potatoes, to the onion rings, to the Pad Thai.  Everything was just amazing.  Our server was excellent.  He was friendly without being annoying.  I told the server that I was a Concierge and that I worked for an elite company (the name of which I can't say here because I'll get FIRED!!!)  and he brought out a complimentary fortune cookie.  I'm not talking about those little shits you get from the takeout place up the road.  This was a massive, probably 5 pound fortune cookie with one side filled with chocolate mousse and the other filled with white chocolate.  Covered in fresh, tropical fruit, it was absolutely stunning to look at and even better to devour.  Entering the bathroom, it's sort of hard to tell which one is for you as they are only labeled with ""Yin"" and ""Yang.""  Which one am I? Yin or Yang?  Omg omg omg.  A brief panic attack hit me as I feared entering the wrong gender bathroom in the hippest restaurant in Las Vegas.  Luckily, some slutty looking chicks went into one of the bathrooms (can't remember if it was yin or yang) and so I went into the opposite one.  Inside, a convenience store was waiting.  This is not a joke.  Every type of gum, breath mint/spray/strip, and designer cologne you could imagine was just sitting there.  Like 10 grand worth of Burberry just laying around.   Heaven! Except there wasn't an overly friendly Indian man working in there.  So, not a TRUE convenience store, but I'm confident that Tao will complete the theme sometime in the near future.  Anyway, Tao is even on opentable, so I really can't even find one, single flaw with the whole place.  If you're in Vegas, go there!

Here's the kicker: If you're hosting a large Bachelor party (10+ guys), and don't want to drop thousands of dollars on bottle service (face it, some people in your party don't mind spending, but others want to keep $$$ to a minimum), this is your place.  If everyone in your party orders an ""entree"" (which range from $30-$45), you get free admission into the club.  The best part is that you can bypass the ridiculous line altogether!  It's a win-win situation...considering the entrance fee would have been $40 for guys.  Keep in mind the club opens at 10pm, so schedule your dinner upwards of 8pm.  

Going back to the food, my expectations were pretty low.  I was expecting extremely sub-par PF chang's style food, but I actually came out decently impressed.  I ordered the Pepper beef filet Mignon and it had quite a bit of meat and decent flavor.  The beef was tender and cooked pretty well.  The Sea bass would probably be the star entree here.  I got to try some of it and it was actually pretty good (think Yardhouse Sea Bass).

Long story short, if you're looking into getting 10 guys into a club and don't want to wait in line, Tao Asian Bistro should definitely be at the top of your list.

We had made reservations that morning and was able to get a reservation with no problems.... we ended up showing up an hour earlier than our reserved time, dunno how that happened and why ... but i guess in vegas ALL people lose track of time... i guess we were too excited to just stay in the room...... any hoot, we show up and we were able to get seated 45 mins earlier than our reservation. We were totally surprised and delighted at the same time. This was my first time to the restaurant part... and honestly wasn't expecting much to begin with, based on all the negative things that i've heard about the food and the service. 

But honestly.... i had a great time.  The ambiance was nice, i could've gone for lowering the volume to hear my friend sitting across from me, but i didn't mind yelling. =P The food was absolutely delicious. We had all ordered fish ~~~ there was the Miso Glazed Chilean Bass, Soy-ginger glazed Salmon, and the Yellowfin Tuna. All were cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  I would definitely come back to try their other dishes.  

Service was decent for what it was worth. The place was crazy busy and we had plenty of libations at our table so we didn't really notice any lack of service... we were enjoying each others complany wayyyy too much. =)

Our flight was delayed and they were very amenable to delaying our reservation. The ambience is very loungy though the nightclub is upstairs which has a very different feel (you would never know though!). 

Our food was excellent. My husband got the coconut shrimp, I got Chilean sea bass and we shared shrimp fried rice they were all very good. But the start of the show surprisingly was the maki roll we ordered for our appetizer, crispy spicy tuna with avocado. We love sushi and this was one of the best sushi experiences we have ever had. We're considering going back for just sushi. It was so fresh and tasty. 

Lastly, if you eat at Tao restaurant, you get free admission into the nightclub which was a little intense for me but worth checking out! Overall great experience. Would definitely go back on my next visit to Vegas.",PxV6PAFLapDhbapgHKI-ZA,0,0,5,HnseBYaea5ZxOXBpk9klRw

My girls made reservations for us, they did so good.  We were a tad bit late, but the hostess was nice enough to seat us within a good 15 minutes.  That was really sweet of her, because the place was packed, and I'm sure that's nothing new.

Once we were seated, our waiter, I hate that I forgot his name, greeted all of the ladies with a smile, told us all about the specials, what's popular, all that good stuff to help us decide.  The restaurant was very dim, very dark, very sexy.  Honestly, it was a little too dark, made it very difficult to read the menu, but that was nothing big to complain about.  Because it was a group of girls, we all made the executive decision to order 3 or 4 appetizers, 3 or 4 dinner entrees, make it like family style.  Pass everything around the table, everyone gets to taste everything.  Now, I don't know if I got my hopes too high up for Tao, but the overall meal, it was...good. Not great, but good.  I wasn't disappointed, but I guess I was expecting out-of-this World cuisine.  

Honestly, the best things, were the Thai Crab Cakes and the Pork Potstickers.  Full of flavor, full of filling, the mango chili sauce on the crab cakes was really good, so was the chili sesame glaze on the potstickers.  That was my favorite.  Now, the entrees, it's not like they were bad, but I wasn't blown away.  If I had to pick one of my favorites, it would have to be the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon.  Cooked perfectly, tender, flavor was awesome and the tower of onion rings were a great match. A fun match.  I ordered the Miso Glazed Sea Bass, which melted in my mouth like butter, tender and flaky, but the seasoning was a little off.  It's like there wasn't enough.  But the quality was top notch.

It was so sweet that they did bring me this giant fortune cookie, with a giant fortune on the inside, filled with sweet, smooth, velvety vanilla and chocolate mouse.  I mean it was so good and the cookie was just the cutest and so delicious.  The fresh fruit with the chocolate, I mean it was literally a sweet ending.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Tao, it is definitely the place to be, always jumpin', always poppin' and it's really just a pretty cool place!",CDGLVO1KKTsiHPwPWDm6fw,3,2,4,0fe65ISTy6IjvHS0C0UORw

He was wearing a $79 JC Penny suit and he told me we couldn't get in b/c I wasn't wearing a collared shirt.  The problem was that he was a big a-hole about it.  Additionally, why is the restaurant staff telling me to go up to the club, just to block me at the door.  

If you want to spend a lot of money and then get shit on, go here.

In Chicago, their sushi wouldn't even break the top five.  This place is so shallow that all the 5-star reviews are probably from people that work here.  Notice all the 1-star reviews.

3459532,2010-06-17,3,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"Ok when I think about restaurants on the strip I generally don't think I'm going to have any sort of meal that is satisfying, tastes out of this world and is not pretentious. Tao has really taught me a lesson in that department. Don't judge until you've tried. 

I've come to Tao two times to eat and both times my socks have been blown off. Not really...cos both times I wore heels that were way too high and uncomfortable and ended the night walking around without shoes. Note to self: DO NOT wear ridiculous shoes when you intend to walk more than 3 steps. 

I digress...I digress...back to Tao. Contrary to popular belief, both times I was here (once with 8 people and once with 4), we were able to get tables (the first time we called the night before and the next time we just walked in) on Saturday nights. As you enter Tao, there are these flower-petal filled mini earthen bath tubs...haha...if I had a couple of their super strong lychee martinis I would go take plonk myself in one of these. They look that zen and inviting. 

This latest visit I made to Tao started with drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. Lychee Martinis...I made sure to ask for ""extra strong"" martinis and that was delivered. A great start to the night. The waiter we had was very knowledgeable about the food. He knew exactly what went in each dish. Tao is also very vegetarian friendly. They can substitute tofu in many dishes and there are many veggie options. Ok now to the dishes:

1. Shishito Peppers - Yum Yum...very nice and interesting. Never had these before. I probably wouldn't order these if I didn't have more than 4 people in my party. Rather large portion and the taste is interesting only the first couple of bites

2. Sake Infused Mushrooms - OK I am going to go insane right now. This was soooo good....i HATE sake and I'm salivating all over my laptop right now. I can't even describe this dish. You just need to get it. NEED TO I tell you

3. Steamed Veggie Dumplings - The dumplings itself were pretty normal. Nothing out of the regular dumpling world. Don't get me wrong, they were good...just nothing to write a paragraph about (although I guess I already have). Now, the dumplings came with this AMAZING crunchy cucumber side. Ok...seriously...cooked cucumbers. Sounds icky but Yum Yum Yum. Very very nice...

4. Fried Brown Rice with Veggies - Wow. Crispy lettuce, perfectly cooked tofu, simple flavors and you wouldn't even know you are eating brown rice (I don't like brown rice). Tastes sooo good. This is literally the best fried rice I've had outside of Asia. And I've eaten many a fried rice

5. Mango Tamarind Martini - This one tasted sooooo good. Masked the taste of alcohol (i can't stand the taste of alcohol) and tasted interesting with just a hint of tamarind. A perfect complement to the meal. The drink still packed a good punch even though you couldn't taste the ""punch.""

We ended the meal with the 4 of us sharing a chocolate cake of some sort. I'm not a fan of chocolate cakes in general so I can't really remember how it tasted. The girls seemed to like it though. 

We even got our hands stamped to get into Tao (the club area) after we ate. Totally worth the price!

If you are in Vegas and up for a nice dinner on the strip I would suggest Tao for sure. Great food, amazing drinks, good service and the ambiance is of course wonderful.",pngNlr9t4HObDgecGH_jaw,4,3,5,URdA5DmkchlwRuj_7PtEXw

-The bathtubs lining along the entrance are pretty cool. I'd totally have my dinner in there if they let me.

Didn't like so much:
-Umm....there's a bathroom lady/attendant. I always think it's unnecessary to have someone handing me a towel after washing my hands. I didn't bring my purse in there so I had no money to put in the tip jar, which made the whole thing quite uncomfortable.
-The decor was a little too ""fusion"", like they try to do everything Asian but don't do anything that well. I expected a bit more from such a fancy place.

The food was very good.. although it was way too expensive and the portion sizes were tiny! I guess this is to be expected in a place like this.. but  honestly, for asian fusion flavor you might as well go to P.F. Changs. The atmosphere is not nearly as good, but you get your moneys worth.

The drinks were even more outrageous than the food. I had a Grey Goose and Cranberry... $16. Seriously.. for one little drink with more ice than booze. 

Our server was a complete... a-hem. She was covertly and outwardly hostile the entire meal. We were pleasant, not demanding, ordered lots of food, drinks, etc... she should have been happy to have our table!

-When we were seated, I have to admit, I was a little disappointed with our table. It was one of those where you are right next to the neighboring table and share a booth with the stranger next to you. Not that big of a deal really.
-My husband had the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon w/ Onion Rings. He was pretty disappointed. I felt bad bc I had talked him into getting this dish due to all the great reviews.

The Pros:
-My dish alone is the reason I would go back to Tao and the reason I gave it 4 stars... the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass was outstanding! Best fish I've ever eaten. Just the perfect amount of sweetness and it melted in your mouth like butter. 


Somewhere in the Middle:
-For an app. we had the Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice- good, not great. I was hoping it would taste like a similar dish I had once at Katsuya in Hollywood and it just didn't stack up.

4 stars because the Gyoza, chicken and dessert were tasty and would go back for it. Plus, lots of potentially good looking dishes I saw (fried rice, pad Thai, chicken skewers and more)

The food (ps the highlight was the cauliflower omg)
- CHICKEN GYOZA (3.5 stars): choice of steamed or fried, wrongly opted for the steamed - mushy exterior but a tasty filling and soy dipping sauce. Served with pretty much raw bean sprouts.
- CRISPY TUNA ROLL (2 stars): fresh fish, but overly heavy handed on the wasabi and ginger. Tasted a little too oily for me as well. Served on a bed of ton of edamame with grated ginger
- CHILEAN SEABASS (3 stars): very flavorful, very fresh, served with veggies but a bit too buttery tasting for me.
- ROASTED THAI CHICKEN (4 stars): a bit dry, but otherwise good. 
- CAULIFLOWER (5 stars): imagine Kung pao chicken but cauliflower. Perfectly roasted, super firm yet cooked, doused in a delectable sweet and sour sauce. A bit sweet, but seriously could not stop eating this
- FORTUNE COOKIE & MOUSSE (5 stars): didn't really taste like a fortune cookie, so much as like a vanilla crisp or something, but the killer part about this was the little bit of dark chocolate it's dipped in and the delicious both chocolate and vanilla mousse that it's served with. Also, it comes with fruit / so it's healthy right?

TLDR: based on price, good for business dinners or if you're okay with spending. Lots of good potential dishes, you just have to know what to order.",qurv1eJZswxUZaZqN53Meg,0,1,4,oFb3DCTyQoXO6_M6_OTJOw

We ordered the $75 per person family style menu because everyone was so hungry and agitated we knew if we all ordered individually it would further throw the party into a black hole.  Some guests were just saying bring out food, anything will do. 

The line for the night club portion was piling up and packing the staircase which was horrible because it became a major task just to get to the restroom on the 2nd floor.  Security initially told the girls that was the only one while we were initially waiting to be seated so we did not know any better that there was a restroom on the main floor. 

A girl came around and stamped our wrists and told us this is to get into the club upstairs after we finish dinner which seemed like a cool option that the restaurant seemed to give patrons and we decided that we would stay for the club after dinner instead of hesding out to Ballagio.  This later became a ridiculous ordeal because as we went up the packed staircase with our entire party the bouncer at the top stated that the stamp now did not give us admission but got us past the line outside. He told us to all go to the front door. 

The look of disgust on the birthday girls face summed it up and trying to patronize the place further would just lead to further aggravation. 

The only reason I gave this place one star is because the food was really good but I can't be really sure because when you are starving anything tastes good and some of the girls last meal was around noon so we were pretty hungry.",-V0WlH17hBxGr-Xm0i7lZQ,5,1,1,4AUC2eRV9QxblrA8FJZVPQ
3553413,2008-09-03,4,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"Since we were staying at the Venetian, we chose Tao for our dinner destination the last night of our Vegas weekend... My dad made the reservation in advance and let them know we were celebrating a birthday.  There were six of us in the party, and we actually all arrived right on time!  The hostess said it would be a few minutes, so we sat at a table in the lounge area, ordered some drinks, and snacked on some of the wasabi peas.  The waitress that took our cocktail orders was sweet, and she made some great Taojitos for the group!  At 8:30, we were wondering why we had to wait so long and getting a bit ansy... we finally were taken to our table around 8:40.

Dinner was amazing once we were seated.  Chris was our server and took great care of us.  We enjoyed a round of appetizers including lobster dumplings, crispy tuna tataki, edamame, duck spring rolls, and eggplant tempura.  We also did dinner family style and shared wasabi steak, pad thai with shrimp, crispy snapper, seafood in black bean sauce, spicy eggplant, curry shrimp tempura maki, and pork fired rice.  It's two days later, and I am writing this all from memory - it was that good!  (Usually I would have to look back at the menu to remember what we ordered, but it all made a lasting impression in this case).  We literally cleaned all of the plates - everything was great, and quick too!

Luckily, even with all of that food, we saved room for dessert.  Chris brought out a beautiful birthday cake for the birthday girl and boy (my bro and sis are twins).  I'm talking really quality, beautiful gourmet cake (like AJ's in AZ).  It had ""Happy Birthday A & Z"" written on it in chocolate and it was a vanilla layer cake of sorts.  

I didn't pay the bill, and I'm sure it was expensive, but this was by far the best meal we had on the trip, and I'm sure it was worth it!  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wait we had upon arrival - other than that, Tao was amazing!

While the ambiance here is spacious with a cool decor, the food here is overpriced and not worth it.  Sure, you may see celebrities here, but really, who cares?  I care more about the taste of my food.

And when you ask for water, they ask you if you want plain tap water or bottled water.  They almost make you feel like a schmuck for drinking ordinary tap water.  They serve Voss water in a big bottle here.

But when you are in Vegas, it's often more about the atmosphere and the experience.  Want a celebrity sighting?  Want to visit a Vegas hotspot?  Tao is definitely a great choice at the moment in the fickle and ever-changing Vegas scene.

The food takes a number of dishes from Southeast Asia and moderates the taste for a Western palate.  Spices are generally mild, the ingredients are less exotic, and anyone who has eaten at a P.F. Chang's will feel very comfortable.  You really can't go wrong if you choose a number of small plates and share them family-style.

I'd also highly recommend the sake flights, which give you a sampling for some very fine wines.  Oddly enough, you can't tell which is which, but does it really matter?

This is a great location for those large groups, although getting a reservation can be difficult.  It's a good thing that they have late-night seating up to 10:30 or 11:00pm.

A note for those bachelor/ette parties - eating dinner at the restaurant does NOT get you into the club automatically, so plan accordingly.  It's still a good choice to eat downstairs and go clubbing upstairs afterwards (because you avoid an extra taxi ride in between dinner and partying), but you need to make reservations at both locations BEFORE coming out, otherwise you risk having to wait in line.",tvjL4BErlkBNsSyLjkEzFg,3,1,4,Z4G8MyjaxsQZFjmRUaryyw

That is the ONLY thing that my Tao Restaurant dining experience lacked and who knows, had I asked, maybe they would have had one on hand. We had reservations for Saturday night for 8:30pm to celebrate my 30th birthday. Friends were gathered from Chicago, NYC, and San Francisco. We had a 45 minute delay in being seated at our table but that came as no surprise given the busy night. We were seated in the first floor dining area near the majestic two-story tall Buddha statue. Our server was courteous, attentive, and knowledgeable on the menu items.

The standouts for me appetizer-wise were the vegetable dumplings and egg rolls (i'm pescatarian and do not eat meat). My carnivore friends seem to enjoy the dragon tail spare ribs and meat potstickers. Through it all, the wine kept pouring.

Our entrees came and I was dazzled by my Typhoon Lobster with Fingerling Potatoes and Spicy Stir Fry. This is when the bib would have come in handy because when I was done it looked like I had massacred an aquatic beast! Fine food, great conv, surrounded by top notch friends -  this was an evening to be remembered. 

I will mention that the pair who ordered the Peking Duck for 2 were indifferent to it. The description had sounded amazing but did NOT live up to their expectations. Everyone else enjoyed their food immensely though. Then came what would make for buzz that this meal was a contender for best meal ever - the dessert platter.

Over the off-key singing of 'happy birthday' came the mother of all dessert platters. It included a scoop of ice cream, sorbet, molton chocolate cake, fruit, and a giant fortune cookie filled with white and dark chocolate mousse and chocolate buddhas. Simply incredible and I am not generally a dessert person. 

From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave Tao you feel as though you are experiencing something unique, exotic, and daring. The decor is chic and sexy, the vibe hip and happening. Thank you Tao for making my birthday dinner one I will never forget.",wmDVtRuA_JgkEnPjYXhVbw,1,0,5,bTVp6dBIZt1Im4PkufaA7Q
3585663,2007-05-24,1,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"What a pretentious yet tasteful dungeon this was ! I got the feeling that the reason this place is so pricey besides the fact that it is in Vegas, and in the Venetian, is because they are still trying to profit and pay off whoever did their decor. It was unique, but I was not impressed because I see this stuff around all the time (hey, I AM from Los Angeles, the cultural enclave of the west coast).
The decor is the highlight of eating here, not the food or the service. It is definitely no bargain. The selection of food is not sufficient. There is no description of the special rolls, which confused my companions and made me have to explain the differences to them -__-. The sushi was not well wrapped, or proportioned well. I did like the idea of a seaweed salad sampler plate for a measly $10, but the dipping sauce was bland and watery, and they just didn't go well together or alone. I'd rather go to a white box with windows for good food rather than try and fill my stomach through looking at cool things, but that is just me.
I had a Love Potion #9 cocktail, and though it was good, it was a ripoff. Maybe I hit the bad bartender who gives too much ice and not enough of anything else, but it was a necessary gamble. 
The service was fine, no complaints here. I actually ended up waiting less time than I thought I would have to. I also got the feeling that you have to be less than a size 6 to work at this place, including the men. Abercrombie/Fitch style lawsuit, anyone? 
The music the DJ was spinning from ITUNES wasn't hip or amazing, it was just typical background music. I wouldn't dance to it, nope.

Just eat the food, drink the booze, and leave!  You'll have a better night for it.

Tao Restaurant is amazing.  I loved the decor, the service, the short wait, and of course the food.  This behemoth of a restaurant does Asian fusion right.  I had the Tao-tini (after my requisite dirty Grey Goose on the rocks).  Fruity, strong as all hell, and delicious.  My PIC and I started with the lobster wontons.  Best.  Dish.  Ever.  Next time I go back, that's all I'm ordering.  We also had the lobster dumplings to start.  Good.  But definitely not the lobster wontons.

We then ordered the Thai fish hot pot, which had a very strong sauce, overpowering on its own, but perfect with steamed rice.  We made the mistake of ordering veggie fried brown rice.  Why were we trying to be healthy? Anyway, what came was a plate of veggies + mush.  Ugh.  Panda Express makes a better fried rice than that!

Upon leaving the Venetian, my PIC and I decided that next time, we're just ordering 6 servings of the lobster wontons.  And then heading to Jet to shake it all off!

P.S.  One of my students told me that her group of friends was offered free dinner + drinks + Tao admission the same weekend.

Plenty of bouncers to ensure eating privacy. All seemed fairly crazy to me at a place we were to have dinner but It was well worth it.

The Tao restaurant had some of the most delicious salmon I've ever had. I ordered the soy ginger glazed salmon with udon noodles and spinach. The salmon cooked to perfection, beautifully medium in the middle, and the udon was amazing. Every morsel, every bite, and every scent was packed full of flavor. The seasoning enhanced the flavor of the salmon rather than masking it.

I eat a lot of Asian food, not because I'm Asian myself but because there is an abundant amount of Asian restaurants in my area. I wouldn't say the food at Tao is authentic but it is a warm welcome to to the culinary world with Asian influences.

Stationed overseas for 4 years I've had the luxury of experiencing and enjoying varieties of sushi and Japanese cuisine from Tokyo to Osaka. With high expectations and standards I expected nothing, but quality and taste for the appropriate price for the right food. (Especially being in the main spotlight of Vegas.) Sushi is expensive and in all Vegas is expensive, but charging 9 dollars for an instant miso soup deluged in hot water is beyond overpriced, but rather senseless. As for the main course I would compare it to Japan's dollar conveyor belt sushi resturaunts were they serve two large sushi for a dollar and the miso soup is actually miso soup! It's not Japan (I know) and no, the world is not running out of fish either. I say this not for my own health, but for next wallet waiting to be dipped in soy sauce.

tao's service was surprisingly great although we arrived 8-ish without reservation. we were seated promptly with courtesy. our server was super nice and informative, as he explained every single dishes we've ordered as they arrived at our table.

interior deco was as usual. check it out for yourself on their website.

small plate: thai stuffed shrimp with garlic, lime, and thai chili sauce 
small plate: satay of chilean sea bass with wok roasted asparagus
wasabi crusted filet mignon with tempura of onion rings
chef's roll
desert: chocolate zen parfait

the food was all excellent, but this place is really more about the vibe and the people-watching. tao is a popular destination for private parties among celebrities. the bill came out to be around $130, including a couple of drinks. not bad for a fun dinner in vegas.

And if that's not enough for you, inform your waiter that you plan on going to the club after dinner and they will give you a stamp that will get you in for free (both males & females) and let you skip the line. You can't beat that! 

We visited Tao (Restaurant) on 4/1/10. We made same day reservations and they were able to accommodate us. I had the ""Crispy coconut shrimp with Thai peanut sauce"" and my date had the ""Soy ginger glazed salmon with udon noodles and spinach."" Both dishes were great - Cooked perfectly, even to the toughest food critic's standards. However, I think the best part of the meal came at the end. Like any other Asian restaurant, they give you a free fortune cookie with your bill. But these are not your standard boring fortune cookies. The fortunes inside are a little more unique than most. Mine said ""You will receive a spanking in your near future"" and they bear the Tao logo on the corner. Definitely made us laugh at the end of a really great meal. 

On the down side, prices are a little high here, but that is expected from any nice restaurant in Las Vegas. Don't let this deter you - This place is worth the splurge!

When we called for reservations, the frist available time was at 11:15 pm. One of my male friends said that he and his friends had a difficult time getting in the last time they were in Vegas.   

We got there and we had to wait a few minutes at the lounge for our table.  People were already partying and they got us free drinks, yes!

This place is very trendy, very hip.  The decor and lighting was perfect and  there were at least 2 giant buddhas that I saw.  It was a very nice touch, added to the elegance of the place.

The one thing we did not like is that it's hard to talk to everyone at the table during the meal.  Loud music was busting from the night club.  If you are looking to get that intimate conversation going on, this is not a good place.  But then,  that gave us time to just enjoy our great meal.

Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice
Pork Spring Roll with Thai Chili Sauce
Black Pepper Sizzled Filet Mignon with Udon Noodles
Pad Thai

3815146,2014-07-24,4,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"They may say Tao is meant to be a spiritual dining experience, but after our terrible night there I was closer to wrathful sin than enlightenment. 

I made a reservation at Tao for the second anniversary of the first date I had with my girlfriend. We came all the way to Vegas from San Diego, and we were curious about Tao's because of the interesting decor etc. 

Quite literally the moment we arrived the atmosphere became oppressive. Our biggest concern and the truly unforgivable factor in this ordeal was that the very second we arrived, there was a security guard playing on his phone who for some reason or other determined we were criminals of some sort.. He was large, Caucasian, and messy haired (I only write this in the hopes that the management will read this review at some point and give him a stern talking to), this lummox of a man took one look at us and apparently instantly decided we were up to no good. I have no idea why, we were a young couple, well dressed, happily chatting etc. He didn't take his eyes off of us for the entire night, he followed us when we went to the host to claim our reservation (which just FYI took about ten minutes or so after our reservation time), he followed us to our seats, glowering the whole time. He checked in on us every now and again, just standing a bit away from us trying (and failing) not to be obvious about it. When we had eaten and we started to head out he was coming back to check on us again, the moment he saw us he turned back around and started speaking into what I assume was an earpiece. Not subtle at all... My girlfriend at this point was incredibly upset; she didn't know if he was sizing us up as criminals, drooling over her (she is very attractive), or if he thought her mid length skirt was a sign she was a hooker or something (no way...her outfit was very tasteful). Either way she walked straight out. I however walked up to our forboding shadow and asked if there was a problem and why he had been glowering at us all night. He responded with ""Oh its just... Nothing..."" and looked away. Very nice, Tao... Treat your patrons like criminals and then halfheartedly try to cover it up with lies... 

But that aside on to the restaurant itself. 

The atmosphere at Tao is admittedly very nice, trendy music playing constantly beats like the pounding heart of the restaurant. Clumsy Asian inspired art does its job in setting an oriental-fusion mood for the dining hall, watched over by a giant Buddha, overdone but altogether nicely set. 

Unfortunately the atmosphere is the best part of the restaurant. We had two people help us with our meal, a bus boy who was obviously better trained than any other member of their staff came, introduced himself, welcomed us to the restaurant and got us some water in a cordial yet amiable manner. I wish I had a better memory for names because if I could single him out for the managers I'd say he deserved a promotion.

Our actual waiter on the other hand never even bothered introducing himself, he was rushed and a bit curt if I'm being honest. but he did take our orders and get our food to us so there's that much... In his defense he did seem to have a full load in his section but it was still off-putting, that he didn't even say ""Hi"", just ""So what can I get for you folks tonight""... 

The food itself was well... okay... I mean it was nice, don't misunderstand, it was good food. Just not great, definitely not worth what they asked for. I had the Crispy Thai Pork which almost seemed like it came out of a frozen meal package, and my lady had Spicy Chicken which oddly enough was less spicy than my dish, in fact the chicken itself was rather bland. So the food was a bit of a let down too. 

They were also out of most of my favorite beers, Tiger, Sapporo etc. so I settled for a warm Kirin out of the bottle. Not much to say other than well, warm beer. 

All in all I sadly have to warm away anyone who actually wants to have a good time in Vegas. Tao is rife with ridiculously bad staff and disappointing food. Do not ruin your evenings as we did by frequenting this travesty of a restaurant.

3828327,2013-04-18,1,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"I went to Tao Asian Bistro on April 4, 2013 with my boyfriend for our romantic date in Vegas. I loved the atmosphere and decor. The music is loud and pumping through out the restaurant but it didn't bother me at all. It could bother some older people though but it set the tone for the ambiance of the place and I personally enjoyed it.  I suggest making a reservation to the place since it is pretty busy.  The wait for our table did not take too long. We were able to grab a drink at the bar right there located in the entrance and get our barrings and enjoy what this place had to offer. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The food..amazing. I had the chilean sea bass..OMG! So good..so worth it. Boyfriend had the kobe steak topped with onions, amazing as well! Dessert was terrific.  After dinner, if you wanted to go to the nightclub all you have to do is ask your waiter and a hostess will stamp your hand to get in to the club. You still have to go outside to check your i.d. but the wait in the line is minimal.  
So, why the 3 star?  Well everything was GREAT except at the end of our meal when the waiter brought BACK our check to sign the total. I wasn't sure what that was about but pointed to my boyfriend to have him sign it because he was paying for it. Now, we are seated very close to the other people and the waiter yells out, "" Well when you tip me less than 10% you have to initial that's what you want.""  People next to us were looking at us and my face just went flush! Then he walked away muttering something under his breath, I was trippin! My boyfriend had miscalculated the tip, not usually coming to a place like this and feeling a bit uncomfortable, he quickly signed the bill over and gave it to the waiter not realizing he miscalculated the tip.  Now, I understand..don't get me wrong. I was a bartender so tips are apart of your income and perhaps in a place like this, management may look at the waiters performance as a reason why his tip was so small, which clearly was not the case, he was great. But to embarrass us like that, really upset me and instead of going to the club later, we just decided to go home. So much for a romantic night. But you know, regardless of all that, I do know that Vegas thrives on money and on our way out I gave the waiter another tip because he was good, no doubt. IT was just a misunderstanding. 
Again, I understand where the waiter was coming from but jeeze, maybe speak softer and don't walk away muttering things under your breathe making us feel like we were unwelcomed and like we did not belong. Because of this, regardless of the awesome food, we will not go back nor advise others to do so either because I believe it could have been handled better with less embarrassment for customers who spent over $200 for dinner.",po444aLuFDCIDS67_RPqrQ,0,0,3,APwXEYj8_lj54ahyOho7Kg

The women ordered boldly Mary's which were not good our waiter was more then happy to replace the drinks. 

The service was great along with the manager checking if everything was ok. We had drinks and wine sushi and spring rolls. Be careful when ordering it turned out to be a lot of food! Total bill with out tip 425.00.

From the moment we entered the restaurant, to the time we left, service was attentive and friendly.  I started off the evening by ordering my favorite cocktail, the Tao-tini.  If you've never had a Tao-tini, I highly suggest you do so ASAP.  

We ordered multiple items off the menu for our dinner, including the Chilean Sea Bass Satay as an appetizer.  After watching the Vegas edition of ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"" on Food Network, we wanted to try this highly touted app.  I am so happy we did!

Upon entering I was very surprised to see that it was pretty empty. It's a rather dark restaurant with pretty good music and classic Asian decorations all around. I pretty cool atmosphere, really. My family was seated and our waitress came to us right away. We ordered drinks, appetizer, and sushi for dinner. Our food all took a bit long to come out. I would say the service was very average here.
We stared with the crab cake appetizer which was absolutely amazing! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and very well-seasoned. Yum! 
We were super excited for our sushi. We ordered a plate of sashimi as well as the crispy tuna roll, a yellowtail roll, and dragon (eel) roll. I'm so so sad to say that my family and I were not impressed by the meal at all. We were super hungry so we ate most of the sushi... but I personally found that it wasn't the quality that I was looking for. This is a place I've heard about for years and was soooooo excited to visit. I expected so much more! We told the waitress that we weren't satisfied and she brought out the manager who did not hesitate to take the 3 sushi rolls off our bill and bring us out another dish. We ordered the duck fried rice which was ALSO just super average...
I hate to write a review like this about such a reputable place but I can't lie about how truly disappointed my family and I were. Perhaps it's not as good as it has been in the past?
Gotta end on a positive note so I'm gonna praise the yummy chocolate fortune cookies with sexual fortunes/sayings in them. We all loved the fortune cookies, that's for sure!

3890470,2007-03-05,0,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"When planning my trip to Vegas, this was one place I had heard a lot about and thought I needed to try.  So, we booked reservations a week in advance through Open Table. 

I knew the place was trendy, and in my experience, trendy means pretentious and disappointing.  My first impression, by the automated response I received from Open Table was not great.  The message they send back asks that you please call the restaurant the day of the reservation to confirm.  Isn't that their job???  I was kind of offended.  

Anyway, I called to confirm and they were abrupt on the phone.  We got to the restaurant and had to wait in line to check in for our reservation.         Once at the stand, I was given a buzzer and told that I needed to wait.  So, we waited 10 minutes.  There's good people-watching, but I'd rather be seated right away then wait when I have a reservation.  

When the buzzer went off, we went back up to the desk and this time the man was overly kind, as many people in Vegas had been.  He thanked us profusely for waiting, told us that he really hoped we enjoyed our night, and the rest of our stay.  We were escorted to the perfect table on the second level over-looking the 3-story Asian figure sitting on a koi pond in front of a wall of candles.  It was gorgeous.  The waitress was really sweet and about 10 minutes in, we were seated with out menus closed and a manager came up and asked us if we were waiting on the waitress of if she was waiting on us.  We told him not to worry that we were relaxing.  He told us that if there was anything he could do to make our meal more enjoyable, we should let him know.  Again...so nice...totally unexpected. 

 In typical fashion, I over ordered.  We had edamame (cold with shaved ginger and sesame seed in maybe sesame oil?)...they were okay, not great.  We also had tempura avocado (I'd never seen that before, and I don't generally like the taste of warm avocado...it wasn't different this time) and zucchini.  And...because I'm a hog and needed 3 appetizers, we ordered the garlic and lime stuffed shrimp, which I was looking forward to most of all.  They were probably the biggest disappointment.  The shrimp tasted like they'd been frozen, and they stuffing was, more than anything, breadcrumbs.  Hell, they weren't even stuffed...more like patted on top of the shrimp. 

 For entrees we ordered the filet (B) and Thai seafood stew.  B thought his filet, was good...not as good as at Delmonico, but still good.  It was served with onion rings (one of the better things served).  The seafood stew had a generous portion of seafood:  crab claws, shrimps, clams, lobster, and squid.  The broth was okay, flavored with cilantro and thai basil.  It was a clear broth, though, which wasn't what I was expecting.  Due to the order ordering at the beginning of meal, there wasn't room for dessert.

Overall, 4 stars for great service, 3 for food.",AZRxphVG3RjljoJ7QD39zg,1,0,4,kGNGFsarBWeSOfLz26E7Fw

The best dining experience we ever had! 
We set our standards high but TAO always provides!

Pros:
- Decor is something else - The best I ever saw in a resturant! Schick, contemporary and fresh!
- Extremely clean
- Food is to die for! You cant go wrong!
- Service is attentive and usually very professional, personal and upscale!
- This place screams luxury! 

What else can you ask in a restaurant?! 
Just log into their website to see the style & design!
It is defiantly one of the reasons I like visiting Vegas.

Cons:
- Wait time to be seated can take a while
- Seating at the less private tables can be annoying (too close to other people)

Those are the only things I can think of.

Few Tips:
- As I mentioned, ask for a private table - you'll suffer at the small ones listening to strangers conversations 
- A reservation is a must! This place is booked weeks ahead - Order at list 10 days prior!
- If you did not make a reservation, act as if you did and it's their own fault for not updating the list, act mad, surprised and appealed. 
Also, if you look like one, act as you are somebody important, celebrity or a hip hop talent. You might need to wait but you will be seated!

Price is expansive but you get what you pay for, and TAO provides a lot In terms of food, service quality and dining experience!

It also got the TAO night club which is awesome, to the best of my knowledge you could enter for free if you were dining that night.
Club is open on weekends only.

Great for groups, dates, business & celebrations!

One of my favorite restaurants in the world!

Four stars because I didn't get to see the girls in the bathtubs.  Shoulda gone on a weekend night.

Food was great.   Korean BBQ pork chops, Peking duck, ribs, sushi, dumplings, egg rolls, sake, all done in a very upscale way.
One thing that I really liked was the Chef's Special option with the sushi.  This is where you tell the waiter how much you want to spend in sushi and the chef will come up with something to impress you.  I like the idea of challenging a chef to give his best rather than just fill an order.  I wish I could remember the two rolls that were exceptional, but will maybe update this review later.

The decor is amazing, decorated in classy asian theme with a giant buddha in the restauarant.  They could maybe get rid of the sumo wrestler photos.  The staff was attentive to our every need.  

This place is not for the cheap.  We spent about $500 for five people.

I think the key here is to get the tasting menu - basically, tell your server how much you'd like to pay per person, note any food preferences, and your server will put together a tasting menu which is perfect for groups who want to try a little bit of everything. 

First off all, we had incredible service. There were 5 us celebrating my friend's 30th birthday, and our server was energetic, passionate, and delivered a great experience. His manager was also phenomenal, and ended up comp'ing us with a second bottle of Perrier-Jouet champagne after he mispoured a glass. 

Our server (I can't remember his name) told us that $50 per person would be more than enough to get everything we wanted, and he was right about that. All in all, he brought out three courses - two rounds of appetizers and tasting plates, and one round of entrees. It felt like we tried everything on the menu, and were so stuffed by the third round. Highlights included:

- Satay of Chilean sea bass with asparagus - honestly, out of this world. Melt in your mouth, incredibly flavourful. 

- Spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice

- Crispy spicy tuna roll with avocado and soy paper - probably the best sushi I've ever tasted

- Lobster wontons with shiitake ginger broth - every bite was an explosion of delicious flavour

In addition to the wonderful food and service, Tao also has a great atmosphere - beautiful decor, good music, very trendy and sleek, filled with beautiful people. Bonus is that you get free entry to Tao nightclub after dinner, though we didn't find it that great (it was crowded and not fun).

*I'm more than just an option... Hey hey heeeeeey... Refused to be forgotten... Hey hey heeeeeey... *

When the waiter told me it's one of their more well-known dishes I was sold. Sure, they forgot about me and thought I was only eating a side of brown rice but when my sea bass came out oh boy did it find my lovin'. You can never go wrong with fattiest fish of the sea!

If I were to describe the party in my mouth it would be like P. Diddy's white party in the Hamptons with loads and loads of cocaine and orgies in every room. MY KIND of party. 

The individual bowls of rice can definitely feed more than one person so save yourself a whopping $4 and share one with a friend. Also, when you dine here and purchase an entree you can ask for a stamp to get into the club that helps you bypass a loooooong ass line.

The last time I went I had some sort of a Groupon or something, and tonight my friend had a gift card she was given as a gift.  I think that's the only way I would dine here.  I think the food is overpriced, and if you're going to spend this much on a meal, there's other places in town I'd rather go.  Maybe it's just me.

We started with two appetizers... the spicy tune tartare on crispy rice and the lobster wontons with shiitake ginger broth.  We had the tartare last time and really enjoyed it.  We enjoyed it again this time, but it wasn't as magical as it was last time.  The lobster wontons... well, they tasted like the best wontons I've ever eaten, but I could barely taste the lobster.  The flavor was drowned out from the broth, I thought.

For a main course, we split the most expensive omakase sushi menu, which was like $58.  Very underwhelming how little food we got: one roll, 7 pieces of nigiri, and 6 slices of sashimi.  Granted, one of the nigiri was toro, and the roll was a lobster roll of some sort, but for $58, I'd expect a little more.  Throw some salmon nigiri in there!

We also split the coconut crusted shrimp with peanut sauce, which was really delicious, though the breading on the shrimp was too thick.  That was made up for in quantity of shrimp, as I think there were like 8 or so large shrimp.  It also came with a side of rice, and some sort of salad in the middle of the plate.

Lastly, we tried the avocado tempura since we both love avocado.  Very tasty.

We stuck with water, and when our bill came, it was $140 after tax.  We did have a lot of food, but that seems like way too much to pay for a meal at a place like Tao.  The service was top notch, and the ambiance is typical loud music, dark vibe that you'd expect in Vegas.  So 4 stars for me.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,2,1,4,4K1JgIKvzqWFSo-uw6UWKA

A huge factor in my poor rating for this venue was the lackluster service. I called about 2 weeks in advanced to make a reservation for 7 and we STILL had to wait over 40 minutes for our table to be set. What's the point of making a reservation if we're stuck waiting in the lounge anyway? The hostesses were not very helpful or friendly either. ""Your table will be ready in a few minutes"" turned into a dreadful prolonged standstill in our evening. I have the slightest feeling they dragged it out intentionally just to entice us to order drinks in the lounge, but we did not cave.

Finally seated in the nippy upper level right in front of an overpowering AC system, us poor gals decked out in Vegas-appropriate dresses shivered as well browsed through the menu. The fish clay pot I had my eyes set on was taken off the menu, so I played it safe and ordered the black peppered filet mignon w/ udon once again. It took me a while to regain the sensation in my tongue from the blazing hot flavor, but the rest of my friends thought it was pretty tasty. The miso glazed Chilean seabass was one of the best dishes at the table. Who knew such a thick, buttery, succulent filet accompanied by a pile of spinach could be so worthy of drooling-status. 

I still think the prices are overpriced for what you're getting. $18 for fried rice is just flat out absurd. The only reason we decided to dine here was to get stamped for the nightclub so we could pass up the entire line with free cover. Smart idea if you plan on dancing the night away at Tao, but after this experience, I'd much rather scout for VIP passes on the strip or find a promoter for a hook up.

PS: Don't forget to bring floss if you order the black pepper filet mignon. I walked out front door with black specks all over my teeth. Hawtness.",Nn-hLgYTKNkJQ-G7LSXG3g,6,2,2,Zdx3g-fNj144AbEFazGFSg

Why it's great:

1. amazing buddha statue in the middle of the main floor
2. excellent, knowledgeable service (our guy knew all of the vegan friendly options)
3. great DJ, who played tunes which seemed to cater to the crowd (old school hip hop to 70's music)
4. great food, well prepared

Items to note:

1. it's pricey, but as expected
2. it's cold, bring a sweater or 2
3. might be worthwhile to eat / drink in the front lounge 
4. you will not be seated until your entire party is present

A friend joined me here for dinner last night before the Human Nature Show and we both ordered from the Restaurant Week menu.  For the first course, my friend ordered the Satay chicken with peanut sauce.  I got the ""crunchy spicy yellowtail roll with spicy mayonnaise."" We both enjoyed our dishes.  We didn't try each others dishes because Paula doesn't eat sushi and satay chicken is just satay chicken.  I did try the peanut sauce and it was good.

For course two, Paula got the roasted Thai Buddha chicken with choy sum, sweet chili, and lime.  I got the filet mignon pepper steak with shitake mushroom, bell pepper, and shishito peppers.  I did have some of the Buddha chicken and it was very tender and the sauce was excellent.  The pepper steak was very good.  The filet was sliced and barely stir fried with the vegetables.  The stand out was the sauce again!  It was rich and very flavorful.

For dessert, we again took different paths.  Paula got the crispy Fuji apple blossoms with Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream and I got the chocolate spring rolls
 with Kalamansi dipping sauce.  The rolls were good but they weren't stuffed with chocolate as I hoped they would be.  Rather, there was some melted chocolate on a leaf and the rolls were placed on the chocolate.  Regardless, they were good.  The dipping sauce was non-descript.  I really couldn't say it had much of a flavor.  It tasted more like mango than orange.  For Paula's apple blossoms, they were triangle puff pastries with apple filling.  They were good.

Service was very good.  My iced tea was refilled when it got halfway down.  The table was bussed quickly.  Our server was very pleasant and he was pleased to know there was at least one local having dinner at Tao.

The room is quite nice.  Dark and woody with a large Buddha in the center along one wall.  We got our cameras/phones out so we could get a photo of it.  It would be a good place to take a date if you wanted to impress.

I can only can fit in two places for this Restaurant Week, and I'm glad Tao was one of them!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,5,2,4,Kk09QhYtwxkHsrkB6BosCQ

Wow!  I'll be back, again and again and again and again!

It was the hubby's birthday so we celebrated.  The highlight was that Bono (U2) and Lebron James were here!  We didn't get to see any of these mega stars but I did see Lebron's birthday cake as it was being brought in, complete with basketball and crown!

I made these reservations weeks in advance and confirmed them several times. The restaurant is so intimidating which should be the opposite since it has such a Zen feeling as you walk in with the tubs at the entrance filled with orchids and candles.  The most surprising thing was seeing families for the early dinners.  I really thought this place was a couples romantic dinner place.  They also have a sushi bar.  We got there a little before 7 p.m. and someone had a baby and another family had some teenagers. It was a nice mixed crowd.

The very dark lounge is where we started and we were in the mood for Mai Tai's. Waitress took her time getting to us so we walked up to the bar.  We are big on birthdays.  Last year we went to Hawaii so the Mai Tai's seemed fitting since we stayed state side.  They were fabulous!  So if your a Mai Tai drinker, have one here. You get a nice slice of fresh pineapple too.

We got a booth and I have to say that I wasn't too happy since it wasn't facing the giant buddha.  But after our gorgeous waiter appeared, I mean our friendly waiter appeared all was forgotten (or was it the Saki bombers that did it?)

Every recommendation he made we took.  It was our first time here so we were happy to be guided through the menu.  

We shared everything so we started with the Lobster Potstickers, it was served in a hot pot with mushrooms and this incredible sauce OMG it was so mild yet the most delectable tasting dish I have had in a really really really long time. Next for the main course was the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass-wow!  Another melt in your mouth experience.  We also had some wasabi crusted steak...melts in your mouth, it was like buttah.  We had some scallops and brown rice, it was honestly the best meal I've had in Vegas...it's one of the top 10 dinners that I've had in my life! 

Our waiter Brad deserves his own review.   If Tommy Lee from Motley Crue had a handsome, classy, smart and sweet fabulous twin, this would be him.  Wow! 5-star service! He was super hospitable and friendly.   Very attentive and helpful. He's the best waiter in Vegas! Ask for Brad!

He also brought out a nice dessert for the hubby complete with candle and chocolate written HAPPY BIRTHDAY on the plate.  Brad was also nice enough to give all of us some VIP stamps to check out the nightclub for free! No waiting in line...woohoo!

The downer?  The restrooms say YIN and YANG or something along those lines. So if you've been hitting the sauce, you will just have to try a door. If you see a male bathroom attendant (like I did) you're in the wrong restroom (if you're a girl).  

Another downer? It's one of those restrooms where you can see under the mirrors.  So ladies, if you want to do any SPANX or bra adjustments, do them in the privacy of the water closet. Otherwise, the dudes will get a great show (no wonder I started seeing $1 bills popping under the mirror! WT...?)

My bf ordered Kung Pao chicken and I ordered Salmon sashimi special...When the waiter brought them over, we were like....THAT'S ALL??? Salmon Sashimi($16): It's literally four slices of Salmon with some guacamole underneath. Kung Pao Chicken ($29): it's a small bowl of rice, with some swee

Make sure you make reservations though, especially on the weekends, or you might not get the time you want or you'll have to wait awhile.
The decor is very trendy Vegas, with dim lighting, lit red walls to contrast the dimness , Buddha statues, bathtubs filled w/ rose petals, and japanese lanterns.  Ambiance is very chic, modern, and sophisticated.  
The food compliments the ambiance of the place, using traditional asian recipes and adding modern flair.  Here's what I had:
Appetizers: 
Spareribs- asian flavored spareribs were sweet, tasty, and the meat came right off the bone - there were 6 spareribs in one order
Peking duck springrolls- fried spingrolls with peking duck inside was delicious and not covered in oil like other springrolls
Entree:
Miso glazed Chilean Sea bass -  my favorite place to get Chilean sea bass never disappoints
American Kobe- my friend ordered this and he gave me a couple bites, and it was pretty good.  First time having Kobe beef so I wasn't too sure what to make of it.  Beware of $88 price tag.
Dessert:
Giant Fortune Cookie- Enough to feed 4 and served with fresh tropical fruit.  The fortune cookie was light and complemented well with the vanilla mouse inside the cookie.  I found the chocolate mousse to be a little too sweet.
Service was efficient and friendly, so no problems there.

We had to wait to be seated and I was told it would be fifteen minutes, but actually only waited eight. Good start to the night already. The restaurant is beautiful and the lighting is simply amazing. The great art that surrounds the restaurant feeds the ambiance and tranquility. The vibe is so uplifting here and the music playing is very popular and upbeat from artist such as the Eurythmics just to name some we heard. 

The food was incredible I ordered the vegetable egg rolls and the roasted shishisti peppers. The egg rolls were amazing there was hardly no grease which was so great. It was cut into fourths so was so easy to dip into the sweet and sour sauce. By the way the sweet and sour sauce has no after taste and is a perfect balance of the sweet and sour. The hot mustard was just that hot, so it was not for me! The veggies inside the egg rolls was so good, all were fresh too! I could actually see fresh mushrooms and can only rave about them. The peppers were hot and cooked to perfection. The dipping sauce that is accompanied with the peppers brings out the flavor of the peppers. While peppers are hot it was a half and half, some hot and some not. All were absolutely delicious.

The service was flawless, and if I could give more than five stars I would! The server was so observant to all my needs and questions as a guest. All of the encounters with the staff were perfect! I went to the bar and ordered my Rose wine and they had four bartenders working behind the counter and all were friendly and so professional.

My sushi was pretty good, but for almost $20 I was kinda hoping that I would still be talking about it. The pad tai noodles seemed really dry and were missing some major flavor. Didn't try the Lo Mein, but heard it was good although it didn't look very appetizing. Kinda hoped service would make up for the food, but that too, was just ok.

It was slightly warm, mushy, and the texture made my skin crawl. The signature sea bass is why I usually like coming to eat here and it's been always great in the past but the combination duck fried rice was hard and seemed like it had been sitting out. The fried whole fish was pretty good, I ate everything from the tail to the eyeball and was pretty pleased with it. The duck rolls were bland and our lobster rolls were tasteless and chewy which wasn't good at all. During this last dinner at Tao we ordered $240.00 worth of food between the 2 of us and was only happy with the snapper, miso soup and sea bass.

The best thing I ate here was the kobe beef sashimi, which was one of our appetizers. My friend claimed it was good. I don't think I will ever doubt his taste in food after tasting the sashimi. It is super flavorful and it felt like a party in my mouth (please, no dirty comments, haha).  The lobster and shrimp dumplings were tasty too. The lobster wontons could use improvement, so I wouldn't recommend it.

As for my main course, I had the tuna with peppercorn sauce (I don't think that's on their website menu), which I thought was pretty good until I had a taste of my friend's miso glazed sea bass. Soooooo delectable. It melted in my mouth. I really enjoyed my meal and the wait staff were really nice.

The sea bass was definitely in my top dishes in my life, and I consider myself to of had some pretty damn fine meals.

Just walking up, the zen almost washes over you as you wish that the tubs full of rose petals were actually there for you to soak in.  But then you remember it's Vegas, and that's nasty, and the pounding music hits you and you're not so zen.  Then you're just overwhelmed by the design of the place.  You walk into one of the most perfect lounge areas I've ever seen.  Tons of cuddly couches and areas to sit with friends, all bathed in a very sexy candlelit glow.  The better to enjoy your foofy, brightly colored cocktails in - maybe do a little canoodling.  Now THIS is a place I would definitely come to if I lived in the area.  I had something very blue - called the Blue Zin I think?  (That's what happens when you let bartenders make your drinks, but worth it, it was delish) And a BLUEBERRY cosmo which just might be the most beautiful tasting cocktail ever.  But yeah, they really should've used white cranberry juice instead of red.  I am totally stealing that drink as my own.
And seriously, I cannot rave about the staff enough.  From setting up the event, to the execution, we were treated with kid gloves and doted upon the entire evening.  Our crowd had a great time and I was swimming in compliments for an event well done, and I know it was thanks to Tao and their dreamy staff (cutie patooties galore!).
The apps were fab (and not just because I set the menu) - I especially liked the duck, the triangular pork spring rolls,and the shrimp (which were not rubbery or chewy at all, but soft and almost flaky).  The food at the buffet was only decent, and the desserts just okay, but absolutely adorable (hence the one missing star overall).
I would recommend this location for an event a million times over - they have plenty of nooks and crannies (or nightclubs or balconies overlooking the main dining room) to fit your group, and the know how to make sure your event goes off without a hitch.",2bHSZhM0huV8LRh3YHaOSQ,3,3,4,DINNaPuwiuN7BzFwryOEUw

It's a fancy place, so you won't get a huge amount of food per dish, but what you do get is quality stuff. The service was superb as well. Our waiter was very friendly and understood exactly what we needed, and knew what to ask and when.

On a side note, I found their restrooms a bit confusing. As some of the doors are left open, you cannot therefor see which is labeled men and women. And on top of that, they use 'Yin' and 'Yang' as labels for those instead. The first time I went I had to wait a second to see who was coming out of the bathrooms to tell which was the guys'!

The bowls were huge and on a pedestal and not your usual rice bowl.  Very difficult to eat noodles or rice.  They try to impress that they are using Chinese china in an interesting, splashy way but it doesn't make sense.  Why use a clay pot for long beans when there's hardly any beans in the dish?  You have to really look into the pot to grab the long beans!

I look forward to eating this dish every time I go to Vegas, simply accompanied by a side of white rice.  I also had some $14 appetizer of tuna tartare which was delicious but I could have done without.  Topped off with a nice bottle of Sake and we kicked off the night right.

I was a little apprehensive about eating here with my friends on a bachelor party trip.

Our server(s) - we had a few rotating in/out (maybe it was the switch over time?) - were pleasant but seemed rushed and stressed throughout the meal. 

The food was mediocre and arrived overly quickly... We definitely felt rushed. We each had something different - variety of fish, meat and chicken - but each dish was overly salty and oily. The portions were fine but lacking flare and flavor. I also didn't like how we ""had"" to order main dishes in order to be able to access the nightclub. I was much more interested in ordering two appetizers but my evening plans got in the way!

The cocktails were fun and the wine list impressive. The bar at the front of the restaurant has a great atmosphere - I'd come back for drinks anytime.  I'd probably also come back for dinner because, after all, it's Vegas and you're here to have some fun in loud and busy places!

I have eaten here many times at this point but this particular review is for dinner last Saturday. I was in town with friends for a birthday celebration. There were 5 of them and none of them had ever gone to Tao. So, I wanted to share the love and expose them to the joy of Tao cuisine.

Our reservation was for 6:30PM. We arrived 10 minutes early and were seated promptly. We quietly pulled the server aside and let him know that it was a birthday dinner and he promised to take care of it. 

During dinner, we ordered everything from the steak (amazing!) to the TAO Angry Dragon roll (highly recommended). Some items that I recommend, in no particular order:

TAO Angry Dragon Roll - Delicious
Satay of Chilean Sea Bass w/ Wok Roasted Asparagus - no trip to Tao is completely without this
Lobster Wontons - a good secondary choice - if you have room add this

One thing I should point out - if you're feeling like steak, don't shy away from TAO's offerings. They were FANTASTIC! And very uniquely seasoned. 

In fact I want one right now.

Last but not least - the restaurant delighted us by bringing us a huge fortune cookie for my friend's birthday, filled with chocolate mousse and white chocolate mousse.

FYI the chocolate mousse was the best that I've ever tasted!

They call it ""vibe dining"" because they certainly can't call it FINE dining. Not sure what ""vibe"" they were going for with the Asian heavy theme & weird choice 90's rock playing for the dinner service. 

Our story begins with a bubbly & gregarious hostess seating us and chatting about the menu. She informs us that the BEST way to dine is to do things ""tapas"" style and get lots of small plates. Well... we were here a couple days before for the New Years party and some of the small plate items were served. They were legit un edible. The salmon mousse was like salmon tooth paste! I forced myself to swallow it only because there was no place to spit it out. Any way.. seeing the same items on the menu I wasn't giving those things a second chance. At the time of the party I assumed it was because they went cheap for the New Years party & the actual food from the restaurant would be better. WRONG. 

Any way the friendly women in front of us asks for our drink selections and we both decide on the reasonably priced $18 sake flight. She lights up & says ""Since you are both ordering one I will be sure to mix it up so you have a chance to taste even more of our sake and a couple higher end ones"" This was a statement and not a question. We thought she was being genuinely nice. WRONG. She charged for what we thought was a complimentary up grade making those $18 flights about $64 each.

Now the food. I ordered the Singapore Mei Fun Noodles with no chicken extra shrimp. Did this piss off the kitchen or something? Cause my first complaint is that the shrimp were not all devained and even worst many of the ones that were had the ""vain"" sticking to the side of it instead. Really not appetizing. I couldn't get man buns attention so I kept cleaning them off and tried to just move past it. I should have kept them to show .... oh well. Then I bite into an onion and it is completely RAW all the red onions in my dish were raw. I like onions but this was terrible to do in a dish like this. It said it came with a sauce, the noodles had flavor but it they were dry ... there was no ""sauce"" that I could really tell. Basically I have had better Asian noodle dishes at the mall food court.

My boyfriend had the Duck fried rice. He said the duck was dry it might as well have been poorly cooked chicken. There was way to much hard rice to be considered reasonable even for fried rice and the flavor was only remotely enjoyable for a few bites before it just overwhelmed. 

We had been to the night club for New Years and one of the reasons we came back is I remembered them saying to show your ticket for 20% off of dinner so I ask about it and the waiter tells me has heard of no such thing but to his credit (the only credit he gets here) went to ask the manager. Turns out I was right but I missed the part about it being for New Years Day only. I felt it was completely reasonable to expect them to just honor it any way but they of course did not offer. 

When we get our bill & my BF realizes the BS over charge he also noticed that we haven't seen the girl who sat us for the rest of our meal. She brought out the drinks and left. He was annoyed at this point but the attitude of the wait staff and not being able to confront the girl he decide it isn't worth the fight. We were there on vacation relaxing & he didn't want to ruin it further by getting all worked up so he let it go. To be honest, if I had been the one paying the bill, I would have said something. I didn't know about this part till later & was pretty mad because the whole meal was a disappointment (even the ""upgraded sake taste was bad. I didn't want blueberry crap for dinner and literally only one was good) and I would have spoken up.. I turned the other cheek on things like the raw onion just to keep the evening pleasant. Also, I don't think they care. I really don't think they gave a f*ck if we had nice meal. It is Vegas. Plenty of  new suckers. They don't NEED repeat customers.

Come here for the night life... maybe... not sure cause I paid for the special event... if the event says ""heavily passed hors d'oeuvres"" and you think GREAT I'll eat there! Don't count on it being something you WANT to eat. It was all so gross the waitresses serving were literally BEGGING people to take it. Not joking. They looked embarrassed having to serve it.  You would see them with the same 10 bites on their tray for like a half hour at a time because people would try ONE and never go back for another. You weren't fooling them twice.

Their service was splendid and on point.  Our waiter was very detail oriented and also gave a great introduction and set the high expectation for the evening.

We ordered the strip teriyaki steak, rainbow sushi, Orange chicken, and chili sea bass.  I highly recommend the strip steak and sea bass.  Both were perfectly cooked and very tender.  The sea bass felt like it melted in your mouth.

By no means was the food bad, it very tasty, mostly what soured my view of the establishment was the overly loud music. I realize it converts to a club at night, however not being able to hear someone across the table unless they speak loudly and I lean in does not make for an enjoyable dining experience.

I was also a bit disappointed that I was steered away from ordering the orange chicken by my waitress. I don't consider myself someone who enjoys very spicy food, and when I ordered it our waitress asked if I liked my food spicy. I explained I do like some spice, but not large amounts of it. She then told me I might be better off ordering something else. Not wanting to ruin dinner with friends by not eating my meal I opted to order the filet mignon with udon noodles. While I enjoyed the flavor of the filet with udon I was disappointed in two regards. Firstly the amount of filet mignon with the noodles was pitiful, I had maybe 3 oz of meat total in my meal I think. Secondly, the sauce with udon noodles was tossed in was pretty average, I think I've had the same sauce in a meal at Noodles & Co.  To top it off, my friend ordered the orange chicken despite our waitress' warning and found that it wasn't nearly as spicy as the waitress made it out to be.

Despite hearing how great some of the desserts here were, we decided to skip it and go elsewhere so that we could actually hold a conversation without shouting.",ZJaOO-MRZKTg8gp_-C2PdQ,0,0,2,I6jcj-kSdXz7BQPRzbFQYA

I took the advice of our server and passed on the Ahi for the Chilean Sea Bass.  That saying, ""melts in your mouth"" was true in this case.  The spices complimented the fish, and it was cooked to perfection as well.  Each bite was ecstasy.  That's really the only way to describe it.  And as embarrassing at it is, there were moments where I literally closed my eyes to fully enjoy it (and so did the other girl that ordered it!).

I had a bite of someone's sushi roll as well, which was also incredible; so fresh, and uh, last time I checked, Las Vegas is pretty inland, so... wow. Someone else ordered the Miso-glazed Salmon, and raved about that as well.  Lobster wontons, probably not the best choice, opt for something different.

Given we were a large group, the menu was determined in advance and afforded us an opportunity to sample a large number of dishes. Large being the operative word as the dishes came out rapid fire. Overall, everything was delicious and cooked perfectly, a feat given the large size of the party.

Stand out appetizers included the Spicy tuna on crispy rice, Bamboo steamed vegetable dumplings, Chinese 5 spiced beef short ribs, Chicken Yakitori and the mini lettuce cups with Bang bang chicken. I wasn't asfond of the Peking duck Mushu wraps or the mini vegetable egg rolls.

I know what you're thinking: style over substance.  I was thinking that too when I first walked into this restaurant.  It is like eating in a nightclub or lounge.  Lots of well-dressed good looking people, and relatively loud music.  This place is a scene.  But you know what?  The substance was actually there for the meal that I had.

We shared a series of small dishes and main courses and were very impressed.  The substance was actually there in the food and the service was friendly and attentive.  A nice treat considering that I was expecting the worst.

For our starters we had the shrimp with peanut sauce, XO Chinese long beans, the crispy spicy tuna roll, and the spicy eggland dish.  All of the dishes were quite good, flavorful, and had a good portion size.  The dish that really stood out here was the crispy spicy tuna roll which ranks up there with one of the best rolls I've had -- it packed a nice kick and the fish was fresh.

For the main courses, we shared the chilean sea bass, the typhoon lobster, and the wasabi crusted filet mignon.  The main courses were all delicious.  The sea bass was fantastic as was the lobster.  It was all decadent and delicious.

I would come back here as the food lived up to the style of the restaurant.  Plus, you can a line pass if you eat here which allowed us to bypass the huge line into the Tao Nightclub and enter the club with no cover charge.  A nice bonus!",xRJyMR1_QPuZuUhUuVaooQ,1,0,4,N0w-QUa8nmHm4F2A-yBq1g

The sushi was kinda meh, but the postickers and shrimp lobster spring roll were tasty.

The process of getting the dinner organized with the Tao staff was a huge pain in the ass (my good friend hosted). Basically, they know the place will be packed so if you don't want to deal with their bitchiness, they know someone else will gladly take your place.

I f-ing hate that attitude.

That said, I had the BEST veggie potstickers on the planet here. The kung pao tofu was amazing - and I'm the one who doesn't like tofu. But it was fried (like Mo Mong's tofu luc lac) and soooooo tasty.

I ordered a cappucino and it was horrific. Do not waste your money. 

I will say that once we were seated (after getting the runaround upon our arrival), the wait staff was very good. I appreciated that, bc obviously they knew a fat tip was built into the check, but they were on top of things and I didn't sense any attitude.

4499326,2016-03-03,0,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"I don't really understand what all the hype is about. After hearing about this place almost every time I visited Vegas, I was quite excited about getting invited to a meal at Tao the last time I visited. Unfortunately, I was kind of let down. 

Don't get me wrong, the meal did have its high points and I saw a glimmer of what I had originally made this place out to be. They seated us relatively quickly for how absolutely packed the restaurant looked and a few of the dishes - particularly the albacore nigiri and green bean tempura - were pretty damn delicious. However, their jaunty service and sup-par special dishes left me wanting to come back for a do-over. 

Although the wait to be seated at the door wasn't bad, trying to catch a server (of which we had two who seemed to be quite distracted with their myriad other tables) took us quite a while for both our drink and dinner orders. Upon flagging one down, we placed our order (a few of her recommended favorites in the mix), and waited for our dishes.

The appetizer course - lobster wontons, green bean/avocado tempura, pork potstickers - was decent. The crispy green bean tempura and delicious sauce on the lobster wontons far outshined the heavy avocado tempura and chewy, thick pork postickers. Having ordered the miso glazed sea bass, crispy orange chicken , fatty tuna and chinese sausage fried rice as our mains, we eagerly waited the next course. While all the dishes were alright, none of them really stood out or made me want to come back and eat it again (but maybe that's not even the point with a gargatuan place like Tao?). The miso sea bass (a restaurant favorite) was cooked well, but a bit sweet. The crispy orange chicken was the biggest upset, as the promise of crunchy, tangy chicken was everything but. Neither crispy, nor flavorful. At 15 dollars an order, I was really counting on the fatty tuna to be the star, but was let down by it being a little warm for fresh nigiri and kind of floppy. The chinese sausage fried rice was good, but nothing worth almost $20. 

The saving grace came at the end of the meal in desert form. That was the one plate we cleaned entirely.The molten chocolate cake with coconut ice cream... get this if you come here. As someone who just questioned above if they'd ever return, it almost made me want to come back for more.",Xg37c2BsYUn2fMNpC2M1dw,0,0,3,HqOux1mga3Llmcy3VrmGdg

I'm not usually a fan of Asian fusion so my expectations were nonexistent but the menu was shockingly good:  The kimchi fried rice was perfectly balanced and the uni was pure creamy heaven.

Service was decent.  We had to fill our wines a few times, didn't try any of the cocktails.  The wine list is fairly extensive with many options from relatively cheap (Vegas standards) to high end stuff.  (wines by the glass, not so extensive)  I ordered the pepper steak w/ udon noodles.  It was nice, although I expected more pepper for a pepper steak.  The noodles were done well and the sauce was tasty.  Overall, it was a nice dish, the problem was it's not worth the $30 they charge.  I get that this is Vegas, but there are better restaurants for that price within the Venetian.

Ambience was cool, the buddha is big, the bathrooms say yin and yang, so I walked into the wrong bathroom not knowing yin means women in some kind of Asian language.  I like the electronica playing and it was never overly loud, although we were there early.

The fortune cookies are very wise as well.  Mine read like this, ""Sex is the most beautiful, natural, and wholesome thing that money can buy.""  I should give them four stars just for the fortune.

FOOD QUALITY: Don't expect anything grand here for what you pay for. It's basically over-priced Chinese, Thai, and Japanese cuisine food. It's like the equivalent of eating at Panda Express or at some other Asian cuisine food court restaurant, except you're paying at least 3x as much for it. But then again, this is a restaurant right on the Vegas strip in Palazzo, so this shouldn't come as a surprise. After trying a couple of dishes, the only item that was actually good and worth its price would be the ""Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables"" ($39.00). The fish's flavor and texture were excellent. 

SERVICE: I must say, our server Jeffrey was top-notch. He provided one of the best services I've ever had. Jeffrey was friendly, patient, and very easy to talk to.

On a busy Saturday night in Las Vegas without a reservation, we waited for our table for about 30 minutes.  Not bad, huh?  Well with the 40 bucks we tipped the hostess to get a table at all, I was expecting to be seated right away.  I want my 40 bucks back! Oh well, live and learn.  On to the food.  Between the two of us we split the chefs special roll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy yellowtail crunchy onion roll, lobster wontons, shishito peppers, vegetable brown fried rice, and edamame.  Sounds like a lot of food, but the portions are small.  This was definitely enough food for us though.  The sushi was really not impressive.  Yes, the fish is fresh, but unless you are ordering sashimi, it is still possible to get a bad roll.  Well, we got three.  The worst was the shrimp tempura roll.  So small! So bland! So boring! Come on, if you are going to list this a chefs speciality, it better be special.  The other two rolls were a little better, but both sitting on top of a heavy mayo sauce that did not taste good.  This is my pet peeve.  Leave off the heavy sauce people! Especially if it tastes like crap.  The lobster wontons were pretty decent, I could only eat one because they were rich, turn your stomach kind of rich- too saucy, too salty, too something.  I will say the vegetable brown fried rice was pretty good.  This ""healthier"" version of fried rice was packed with veggies and had a great flavor, the only downfall here is that it was served to us ice cold.  The best thing at this restaurant by far was the shishito peppers! I swear these should be on every asian restaurant menu.  I cant imagine it is too difficult to roast these bad boys up, but regardless, Tao did a good job here.  If you haven't tried these peppers before, please try them!

To start off, the service was amazing from start to finish. Our waiter gave us his recommendations for the food and checked up on us throughout our dinner enough for us to have everything we needed but not so much where we felt uncomfortable. Our water cups were constantly filled, if we had taken a sip they would come and fill it back up to the top. Everyone had a friendly smile on their face and seemed genuinely interested in making our dining experience great and it was! ... at least in the service aspect.
Now for the food, we ordered the sizzling fried size with roast pork, chinese 5 spices ribs, crispy pork bao buns, and a chicken pad Thai. The crispy pork and chinese 5 spices ribs were probably the best dishes of the four but they weren't great either. The sizzling fried rice was kind of dry and the pork looked like something I would find in a $3 breakfast burrito back in the middle school days. And the pad Thai, I couldn't even eat it. We took it for take out and I tried to eat it again as a drunchie and it still tasted horrible and it says a lot if food tastes bad when you're drunk.

After three glasses of wine I honestly can't remember what appetizers we had but they were the bomb-ass rap song. If you don't believe me, ask L.A. Lakers Robert Horry - he was at the table next to us saying hells yeah... or maybe, ""As usual, I'll take the check."" I wonder if he knew that the hot red head sitting next to him just came over to our table and advertised the strip club where she would be working later that night?

Our server Sereka was the cats meow. Not only could she handle 12 crazy men, but she helped us haze the groom. She hand picked a table of bachelorettes for us to send a comp bottle of champagne. Imagine the groom-to-be's surprise when 10 boa-clad bachelorettes came over and personally thanked him for the bubbly.

Oh, and definitely get the miso sea bass - delicious!

We were already pretty tipsy so we didn't have anymore drinks, we were just there for the music and, quite frankly, since we stayed at the Venetian it was the most convenient, and open place for us to go. I guess that it kind of won by default but we still liked it. 

They have cool buddist projections on the dimly lit walls, and the hallway to the restroom is lined in buddist monk art. They should have named this place Buddist because of all the bodacious Buddist decor at every corner.

Anyway, the only negative is that we tried to explore the upper level, but got denied because we didn't have a stamp on our hand. Not sure what that stamp was, or where to get it, but it was probably a buddah head. Oh well, we enjoyed ourselves anyway.

There were four of us in the party and we didn't have reservations--highly recommend you make reservations--so we had to wait for like an hour.

As with everything else in Vegas, it's pricey. But worth it. With dinner, you get a hand stamp to get into the club upstairs for free. That was pretty cool. Unfortunately I was with some people that didn't want to go to the club, so I just poked my head in and looked around but didn't stay.

The bathrooms were very cool too.

It was almost midnight when we settled the bill and left. The place was PACKED and the music was loud, but enjoyable. I'd definitely go back again and again!

XS, Marquee are probably the hottest night clubs right now in Vegas but don't count out Tao. Once midnight hits and the patio is open Tao is shoulder to shoulder busy with people all over the place partying.

We all took advantage of the popularity of Tao nightclub by eating at Tao which provides expedited access to their night club.

My initial impressions of Tao was a restaurant trying to cash in on the Asian theme. When you walk into Tao and see how it opens up however, you're quickly reminded that a lot of thought had gone into designing the space. Lights are dim to set the mood which plays off the color scheme quite well. A giant Buddha statue sits in the middle of an open hall that spans two floors. Asian art is hung everywhere with bamboo vegetation. At the same time, it wasn't hokey, I really appreciated what they were trying to do here.

Onto the food itself, our parties ordered a large number of appetizers which were delectable. I suggest the sashimi platter which had bite-sized party-in-your-mouth morsels of deliciousness.
My main meal was a deep sea dive scallops in basil curry. If you had a bowl of rice to this dish, it is such a full complete meal considering. The sauce was rich and the scallops itself were very large.

Food was tasty -- loved the squab lettuce wraps and yes, the chilean sea bass (although isn't it still on the do-not-eat list?) melts in your mouth.  Not sure if that one's worth the guilt.

Drinks- Tao-tini..  They were good.  Smooth and wound up putting back quite a few through the dinner.  Didn't really feel the effects so I'm thinking the ""smoothness"" was perhaps just a lack of alcohol.

There was a chef's tasting menu being offered this night for an unbelievable $55.  Super cheap.  Both the gf and I went with this option.  First course- spicy tuna tartare over crispy rice.  Yum.  She went with the thai stuffed shrimp.  Again yum.

Second course-  Fried vegetable rice.. eh ok.  She went with the roasted peppers.  Neither of us enjoyed as they were extremely bitter and wound up each only taking two bites.

Third course-  Wasabi crusted filet with tempura onion rings.  Two others at the table also ordered this and theirs was cooked perfect medium.  Unfortunately I ordered the same temperature and was brought a completely rare piece of meat.  After taking the piece back to the kitchen, it returned 5 minutes later completely charred on the outside yet still very much rare on the inside.  I'm not one to send a piece of steak back twice, so I just left it alone.  I finished the 1/2 of my gf's perfectly cooked filet.

Fourth course-  Chocolate spring rolls and a citrus dipping sauce.  Very good and very rich.  Juniper apple blossom with vanilla ice cream.  Nothing special, but good none the less.

If we didn't get such a great deal with the tasting menu, I know my review would be completely different based on my filet mignon not being cooked to order two times, and eventually just giving up on that course.  With that aside, I did enjoy myself and the majority of the meal was very good.... btw... if you order a coffee with Bailey's, it is brought out in a mug large enough to wash your hands.",kpDj7LxeFx0vt5ck1gDQGQ,0,0,4,4kUMPjPWHy0n12FXwc-oVw

The shrimp however was a big hit, i really enjoyed the size and the peanut curry glaze! I had about two of them and I was already full.

You have to remember that Las Vegas is far from any port so if you are visiting from a town where they choose their fish daily from the port side fish market and you like seafood, they have a bit of a challenge here.
We went with a group of 7. We enjoyed both the bar and the restaurant.  Another yelper complained about the glass wine list, I don't mind trying new wines so I actually thought it was a good list.  
This is not a place to go for group discussion, you can't hear across the table.  But so long as you have good dinner partners on either side of you, you'll have a great time.  Beautiful People watching gets an A+.  The vibe and the atmosphere is definitely fun.
Most of our party got the miso seabass which as someone mentioned miso fish (officially called ""saikyo"" preparation in Japanese) is always good.  I was very happy with my seafood hotpot that included nice sized scallops, shrimp and chunks of lobster.  
At the bar they serve complementary wasabi dried peas that are totally addictive.

Seriously the only reason why this restaurant still exists is because of tourists who eat here hoping to get a spot into the Tao club. Don't waste your money eating here. The decor is cool and over the top which is good for Vegas life but that's about it. 

I ordered filet mignon mixed with Chinese broccoli and green peppers. Terrible. Super super salty drenched in heavy oyster sauce. And filet mignon didn't even taste like high quality beef- tasted like cheap beef from a Chinese restaurant for $ in your local area; And yet they're charging $$$ here. Truly a joke. Everything we ordered was so bad I refused to order anymore. Flavors are just off- either too salty, too greasy, too sweet or a combination of everything. The only things that were decent were the drinks and the large fortune cookie for dessert. And it seems like all the waiters come by for is to check if you want to order more food meaning spend more money, but we know better than that. It's just all for show and the glitz and glamour. 

Bottom line is if you want better Asian cuisine, go eat at your local restaurants for $ or $$ and I'm certain it'll taste way better than this.

Unfortunately we had reservations for 10 and they put us at a table that in no way should have held more than 6 or 8.  I have never been so cramped in all my life at a dinner.  That is a minus for this review.

After trying about 10 different appetizers at our table, I was probably hovering around a 3-star review.  The food was average for Asian food at best.  What do you expect, right?  It's an restaurant with food from all different Asian cuisines, probably not doing any of them real justice.  Then I got my entree which was miso seabass.  OMFG.  I eat lots and lots and lots of fish and seafood.  When I go out to eat, that's pretty much all I ever eat.  The fillet was over 1"" thick and cooked to absolute perfection.  It friggin' fell apart with hardly any pressure of the fork.  The miso was perfect.  Just a light coating which really enhanced the flavor of the fish itself instead of drowning or masking the taste of the fish.  So the hero of the plate?  The fish.  Ding ding!!!  We have a winner.  So many times I get fish and the hero of the plate is the sauce on top.  If you have a very fresh fish cooked properly the sauce should be mild and minimal.  I was jumping for joy.  Seriously, I've had miso cod and miso seabass and this has to be the best I've ever had.

Luckily for me before ordering the entree, I told everybody I wasn't interested in sharing.  I had enough beef and other types of meat in the appetizer round that I had no interest in anymore.  Nobody else wanted to order fish or real seafood, so I didn't try any of the other entrees.  I'm so glad - the fish was put on my plate from heaven.

Others at the table that were sharing their entrees were saying the pepper beef was really good, too.  I had no interest in trying it.

If I went back, there's no way I'd even try another entree because quite honestly, I doubt it will be anywhere nearly as good.  The appetizers were average - 3 stars.

It was called Taoism. It was vodka, sparkling wine, cucumber melon puree and a bit of lime. That was pretty delicious. It was the only thing I enjoyed.

That night was the best night ever. For some reason Tao management decide to put us up to the Super VIP area and we enjoy great food and service. This review i would give Tao a 5 stars, because every was great and delicious especially the GIANTS FORTUNE COOKIE's DESERT. 

We decide to give it any try this time around (May 10, 2008) I know it will be bad... But i give it the benefit of doubt that they will proof me wrong. The service was ""OK"" not bad or great. The food was however, horribly salty. i can't even finish 4 bites, even the desert is ok not great as i remember. so don't eat here unless you want to impress your date or desperately craving for chinese food. 


Lounge: it's a good lounge and you should kick it here. I gave the lounge a 5stars.

Club: the only good thing about eating here is the fact that you get to cut in line when they open the club. However, its so crowded in here that you can't dance or walk. you get to see semi-nude dancer though. it's better if you come here with a VIP table so at least you get to sit when you get tire and the drink is within an arm reach. 


Overall: if you never try Tao Bistro I recommend you try, since I'm asian my expectation of what chinese food should be is kinda high. For me their food is not that great, you should try the Grand Wok @ the MGM they are alot better. 

Lounge: definitely need to go and kick with your buddy. there is a lot of girls that you can pick up and if you are a girl there is a lot of guyssss. If you want to still to your own gender, hey don't like me stop you....

The food is absolutely amazing with portion sizes that are moderate in size and not small.  The menu was diverse and offered something for everyone.  I wasn't so sure of this spot at first as I was pretty hungry, but I left highly satisfied.  

I ordered this fried coconut shrimp dish. It was an absolute delight and was more filling than I expected.   I did not expect so many shrimp and so I was both surprised and delighted at the portion size.  It was cooked well and good not have tasted better.  

The décor of the restaurant was very tasteful and trendy.  This is an Asian fusion restaurant and so it was a fusion of Asian styling with modern trendiness.

We had a 10:30 pm reservation and ended up after 3 trips to the hostess station getting seated at 11:15 at a table that wasn't set up yet. Then after speaking to a manager got seated at another table.

From a Food Beverage Director of a hotel casino to restauranteur and founder of the most successful night clubs in Miami. That said I'm not f@&)ing around here. 

The food was at the most a 6 from 1 to 10. The service though was pretty good and hospitable. But really pisses me off. When you sell your own filtered water that still tastes just like out if a fountain gun for $8. Specify on the menu that it's not bottled water.

The fish was cooked properly, tasted & looked great. We also ordered ""Omakase"" style sushi which means that the consumer trusts the chef to create a plate based on his skills & tastes. This is where i was very disappointed, we payed $58 for 6 or 7 pieces of basic, dull sushi. Nothing creative or original. If i may add i personally think that Whole Foods sushi is gourmet compared to TAO sushi. After a disappointing dinner i had conversed with our waiter for a few minutes about fine dinning & how TAO is not anywhere near that. Once he realized that i am a true connoisseur of fine cuisine he immediately started to blame the restaurant for catering to people who don't get to try Asian cuisine & wont expect a 5 star quality, and thats why i wouldn't be impressed by anything there.

Sad to say, they were right.  The original Tao opened in New York in 2000 to much applause and fanfare.  People streamed to the place like moths to a candle for the mundane pan-Asian menu, hip nightclub vibe, and that wild-ass 20-foot Buddha!

The geniuses came together again and said, ""Damn!  This worked so well!!  Let's do it again for the soul-less, culture-vapid city of Vegas!!""  Well, lightning struck twice, and in 2005, Tao Las Vegas opened its doors to brainless celebs like Britney Spears, Tara Reid, and of course, Paris Hilton.  With the ""icons"" of our generation flocking to this mega power club, the lemming touristas followed blindly.

The masses consumed the wholly uninspired and overpriced food without blinking an eye.  They drank their cutsey sake-tinis and munched on the half-assed sushi bar under the watchful eye of the 20-foot Buddha.  They shook their bodies to the thumpity-thump electronic muzak like Massachusetts Shakers on Sunday mornings.

My visits to Tao (a requirement of the job) have led to some realizations.  Perhaps I'm too old and out of touch with what's hip nowadays.  Maybe I've entered the second phase of my life and have become a ""fuddy-duddy"".  Or maybe, just maybe, I'm immune to the brain-washing of the 20-foot Buddha.

We had 8:30pm reservations. Waited 15-20 minutes just for someone to acknowledge us and take our drink order. Here's a tip, put some better lighting in your place since your servers obviously cannot tell who has or hasn't eaten, received drinks, etc.

After we (finally) received our drinks, we waited another 15-20 for the server to come back for the dinner order. We totally skipped appetizers because of this. I was disappointed because I really wanted to try a roll or three.

Call be biased or snobby, but I don't like to pay a lot for Asian food when I can get amazing food in Chinatown for half the price. 

But I went along with it anyway. 

We arrived a few minutes before our 7:45pm reservation. My friend (who knows more about the NBA than anyone I've ever met) caught sight of a small sign sitting outside the restaurant. The poster showed a just a pair of eyes and some small text. Of course, my friend recognized right away that these were no ordinary eyes. These were Lebron James's eyes. He read the sign with urgency. Turns out, Lebron was going to make an appearance at Tao Nightclub after eating at Tao Asian Bistro. My friend almost fell over with excitement. ""I don't care what it costs, that's where we are going afterwards."" I laughed and agreed that we would inquire. 

We walked through the hall of little basins filled with water and rose petals, and the hostess welcomed us immediately. 

She walked us through the restaurant, which is dimly lit and has a huge Buddha on the first floor. The ceiling is decorated with large canvases of calligraphy writing. Stunning displays of portraiture line the back wall and restroom hallway. The hostess seated us on the second floor. The ambiance was just the right combination of bustling, formal/casual, and you know, that Vegas ""je ne sais quoi"". 

Our waiter appeared promptly. He gave excellent cocktail and entree suggestions, and when asked, informed us that I (as a lady) would get in free to the Lebron party, and my friend would pay about $25. Which I'm sure was deeply discounted. Not only that, but we got stamps on our wrists to bypass the line. 

I ordered the blueberry/pomegranate martini and it was delicious. My friend loved the Orient Express (a coffee-based martini). The tuna tartare was amazing, and I ordered the special (which was a short rib udon). The food blew our expectations away. Sure, it's a VERY expensive meal, but it's Las Vegas. 

I thought they did an excellent job of offering a fusion selection that didn't over-complicate. They stayed true to Asian flavors and I liked that. 

The service was hands down the best we experienced in Las Vegas. The chocolate fortune cookies at the end of the meal gave us fortunes that were hilarious, full of sexual innuendo, and right on point. 

I would definitely recommend Tao. Our meal was pretty much flawless, outside of the $5 bowl of jasmine rice (really? five dollars? it was perfect rice, but come on, I can feed a family for a month with $5 worth of rice). More to come when I write up the review of the Lebron party at the Tao Nightclub.",IzvuBaQYl8vb-krpNJzAiA,4,5,4,ZRPy5W7X4C_ikYwImam80Q

It was Friday night and we had to meet friends back in our rooms at 9:30pm, so I made an early reservation at 7:30pm. We arrived at 7:30 to be told ""your table is almost ready, please have a seat in the lounge"". I ordered the Tao-tini, which was way too sweet. Not bad, just tasted like Kool-aid and not what I expected. In 15 minutes we were called for our table and then promptly forgotten about as we stood awkwardly adjacent to the host stand and three other tables were seated ahead of us. Another 10 minutes before we are shown to our table. It's now nearly 8pm so we quickly place another drink order and review the menu. (Great atmosphere and cool vibe coming from the restaurant, BTW.) So by at 8:15pm we flag down a waiter (not ours, he disappeared) to order. We promptly got our appetizer and then we waited. And waited more. We ordered sushi and Shabu Shabu. Items that you DO NOT NEED TO COOK. So please tell me why our food took 45 minutes to arrive? At this point it was 9pm and our remaining friends had arrived early to the hotel so one gal barely ate and left to go meet them with the room key while the remaining group ate in the most un-lady like fashion and scarfed our plates of food. Ridiculous. The manager came over at that point to offer us another round of drinks and dessert on the house!?!???? We were already late, and no we don't want to be delayed even further. He ended up comping our app and drinks instead. 

All in all the food was good, the drinks were mediocre and the service was terrible. I wanted to love Tao Las Vegas (I love the New York location) but I can't get over the horrible service. No one in our group will be back.",YyMhN9P_iQdrUpstzq2CIA,1,0,1,f7PzuMO3g54e8Z0AKgjngg

Dean guided me towards the sea bass on the small plate menu.
For five bites a bit costly (17), but worth every penny!
My only gripe with him would be that he didn't suggest the dinner portion knowing how good it was. One spicy tuna roll order later I was where I needed to be, but sad to know I would be leaving Vegas and not to eat this ""delish"" dish again.

The food was alright and for the value it wasn't worth it. As most places are in Venetian it was very expensive but the quality wasn't the best. If you want a nice restaurant with delicious reviews you should probably go outside the casino.

I got the shabu shabu filet mignon cooked in a ginger scallion broth with wasabi dipping sauce and the udon noodles with vegetable. The shabu shabu filet mignon was really good, though I don't prefer my meat rare done they recommended cooking it in the broth for 3 - 5 minutes which made it way to well done. So I was able to cook it 30 seconds and it was the perfect texture and juiciness. I mixed the wasabi sauce with real wasabi and that made the sauce for the filet mignon even better. I enjoyed my main dish a decent amount and would give that a 4.5 / 5

I didn't like the udon there was way too much salt and too much sauce, the sauce literally drenched the udon noodles and vegetables. The udon tasted very typical and nothing great, I'd rate the udon a 2 star.

Even though the ambience was really great our service wasn't the best, the waitress didn't seem to respect us (maybe because we were young) and not give us great attention nor was she the most polite.

Went with 11 people and most of the people didn't enjoy their food because it was super expensive and the food was just average. If you want high-class food you'll want to try somewhere else.",AsYMm_O4H-mwmWbmeACDHw,4,1,3,UPFy12hg5bdMJEZfJuIPVw

It remained very busy the entire time we were there, so I'd recommend reservations if possible.

We ordered the veggie kung pao, which was not AT ALL like kung pao. It was more like a mild sweet and sour sauce. Oddly, the kung pao didn't come with rice, so we ordered a side of it separately. We also ordered the vegetarian udon noodles, which were fine but somehow managed to miss the spot for me. Our third dish was a hamachi sashimi dish that was to die for! They put sliced jalapenos and a ponzu sauce on it. If I went back, I could just order 3 of those and be satisfied.

We were seated in a nice corner semi/booth table where we could see all the action.. Our smiling server greeted us and explained to us how the comped dinners worked.. It includes several dishes family style, 1 cocktail per lady & if you're lucky a round of shots! 

We had many different dishes but some that stood out were:
-Edamame: you're probably thinking edamame what??? But they give you 1 that is plain and 1 that is seasoned! yum!
-Tuna Tataki: Fresh & perfect balance of heat! I just wish they would give you enough pieces to feed everyone.. I ended up having to go halvsies on my piece LOL
-Dumplings: We got 1 green vegetarian option and 1 spicy pork option. The pork dumpling was definitely the winner!!! 
-BBQ Pork: was nice and flavorful and didn't have an overbearing pork taste.
-Shishito peppers: tossed with yuzu dressing = YUM
-Triangle shaped eggrolls- Jason recommended that we wrap them in the butter lettuce they are served on.. Great suggestion!!!!
-Fortune Cookie Cake: It wasn't exceptionally delicious but I love the cute fortunes that come with it!

4924311,2014-09-24,0,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"It kills me to write this review. This is maybe the most disappointing dining experience I've ever had in Las Vegas. I brought a group of 11 here last Thursday night. Our waiter's name was Bobby. He strongly suggested a pre-fixe menu due to the size of our party - it would come with appetizers, main dishes and dessert for $60 a person (pre-fixe means we have no choice in what gets brought to out table, FYI).

So after we agree to the dinner, the appetizers made it out in about 20 minutes; and honestly, they were great. Fried pork buns, spring rolls, short ribs, some kind of seafood dumplings and three rolls of sushi. Our table of 11 seemed satisfied with the amount of food we received for the first course. Also, I thought all of it was delicious. 

Unfortunately, this is where our fun ended. About an hour later, our waiter comes to our table for the FIRST time since our appetizers were dropped off and asked if we were ready for dessert. We said, ""Ummm, we'd like our dinner first!"". He acted shocked that we hadn't eaten yet. He left, came back a minute later and said that all of our food was delivered to another table accidentally and that he'd have a new round of food brought to us very quickly, maybe 10 minutes. Well, 20 minutes later, we started to get upset. I told Bobby that we had been waiting too long for our dinner. He tried to claim we had only been waiting 45 minutes, including the mistake. But I disagreed and he got a little upset with me. He told our table 3 minutes and our food would be out. So we waited. Again. Ten more minutes went by and I walked over to an assistant manager and asked him to please get our bill right away because we were leaving. I said we'd be happy to pay for our drinks and all the appetizers. He said that was fine. Moments later the food finally came out. But it was too late.Almost 90 minutes had passed and four people had left our party. 

Two minutes later, Bobby comes back to the table and announces that dessert is on the way - mind you, we didn't get any dinner. I told him to talk with his manager - we had already agreed to pay for what we consumed and we wanted to leave. He got more and more visibly upset with me and our group - he was also having words with the assistant manager after I demanded the bill.

We finally got the bill and it was $327 and change. For appetizers and about 13 drinks. We tipped %15 percent, even though our service was awful; and he never gave a true apology for screwing up our dinner. 

What stinks, is that I was the reason my group went to dinner here! I convinced them to go - and we all had an awful experience. Even worse, literally no one from the restaurant seemed to care in the least. Seriously, even the assistant manager admitted it was a long time to wait for dinner, yet after being there for a total of 2 hours, they didn't even comp the drinks. 

Needless to say, I will never go there again. And 10 other people will never go again either. Its a good thing Las Vegas has so many awesome places to dine. And for that reason, you should avoid this establishment!!!",5uZnFbUzdjIHm3kbVzqkyA,0,0,2,Fk9dcY4W4wA1ZDHlCBX9Ig

I had the filet mignon shabu-shabu, which I think was the first time I've had shabu-shabu, and it was delicious.  I sort of knew what to expect so I wasn't surprised when the waiter brought out a cast iron pot and sterno can, but the meat was really exceptional.  The appetizers I sampled were decent and the waiter made a good sake suggestion for the table.

The ambiance in this place is set when you walk in through a short, arched hallway lined on each side with 5 stone bathtubs, each half-full with water and covered in floating rose pedals with a single candle in the middle.  The main dining room, dimly lit, is laid out around a towering (i mean 20-30 ft) Buddha.  If you can imagine, *from there* it gets a little cheesy.  The photographs on the walls range from sumo wrestlers to tibetan monks to little old chinese ladies and beyond.

Chilean Seabass Skewers were amazing. Sea bass is always flaky and always good. Two skewers for $20. 

Minced Pork Rice- $18 this had Pork belly slices served over rice. Very tasty. The portion was tiny. Was it good? Yes! Was it worth it? No. 

Wasabi Crusted Steak $40- this was overdone. We wanted it rare and the server said medium but it came out well. The server never came back so we couldn't tell him. Ended up sending it back. 

Curry Scallops- these were ok. The curry sauce is your standard sauce. Scallops weren't too big. 

Just overall the price is not worth the food but it is worth the ambiance",7Sq9MNNDseNy9AobzAms3A,2,0,2,HJeBwGk2JZqR65JCC2yfpA
4941739,2014-05-02,2,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"Ok here we go.... Things to consider on this review:
This is a restaurant that claims to be one of the finest Asian Fusion bistro in the US so I should be rated accordingly since they are charging you accordingly.
Looks: the place is beautiful, ambiance is perfect, they get a 10 here
Service: started good, I was greeted and assigned a table right away, restaurant was near full, once I sat it took 15 min for my waiter just to show and every time I wanted a drink I had to wait much lore than usual just for him to get my order, once ordered the drink came fast, so it was my waiter the cause of the delay.
Food: I started with a Crispy tuna roll, it was ok, fresh good flavor but too simple, I've had much better tuna rolls in Fort Worth
Then no had the ginger salmon, first I expected wild salmon not farm raised, it was well cooked though it came in pieces, one large a a couple around, not like broken but as if I got the bottom of the pile, again I am rating this restaurant accordingly to what they claim to be.. And charge. Flavor was good, i love ginger, but it was too intense, not even half through i couldn't finish it, it was too much ginger and garlic.
Dessert was vanilla ice cream with apples, the apple part was old and hard to chew, the I cream was perfection.
Drinks: i ordered a beer, I was surprised they brought me the beer in a aluminum bottle and not even offered a chilled glass, made me feel like a red neck 
Would I return ?? NO specially with all the options in Vegas.
Hope this is useful !!",9Z9sBCS4nk7iYktFmUh7EA,0,0,3,usvCT9CeRjbxooFVwinC-g

I had originally asked for a private table after reading reviews on here about some tables being too close to one another.  We were seated on the third level over looking the main floor and the table couldn't have been more perfect.

There were two of us having dinner this evening, and Tao didn't disappoint (at this time slot) for a romantic evening.  The lighting, decor, and music were all absolutely perfect.

We started out with the lobster wontons and veggie dumplings.  He had a gin and tonic, I ordered a shirley temple  (unfortunately he brought me a roy rogers, but I wasn't going to whine about it and have him run down three flights of stairs for another soda for this pregnant chick).  Entrees were wasabi crusted filet mignon and orange chicken with pork fried rice.  PHEN-O-MENAL.  I have never had such good food enter my mouth.  I HATE steak, and my husbands cut of meat almost turned me into a convert.

Dessert was fruit and sorbet, making for a perfect food ending to the experience.

Our server was just ok, but the young man doing the clean up work was the one who deserved the kudos.  Just an over all pleasant guy.

It is a great place to go for date night if you want somewhere romantic. Or bring a group for a fancy night out with friends!

Drinks: Don't expect a cheap drink here! I had a small bottle of sake for $30 and most cocktails were very pricey. Wine is pricey as well and beer is available for a cost. 

Food: INDULGE. Just do it. I had the Duck Fried Rice which was sooo flavorful and was a giant bowl full. So many herbs and not as greasy as I had expected.

You must understand first that I have a serious problem when it comes to chocolate lava cake. All those kids down $1k at the poker tables got nothing on me and my lava cake. 6 months ago, I came to Tao for dinner and was the only one who wanted to get dessert (surprise, surprise). I ordered the lava cake for MYSELF because no one would split with me but I left for 15 min to pick up my friend from the hotel lobby and when I returned, the cake was GONE. Everything from the chocolate chopsticks to the ice cream and every drop of chocolate was G-O-N-E!!! My friends remind me as much as possible how delicious this cake was, and I've wondered about it ever since.

It's my last day in Vegas and I had yet to get my precious chocolate cake. After gorging myself on pounds of bacon wrapped fillet mignon and queso bread at a Brazilian Steakhouse, with just 20 min to make it to the Bellagio to see ""O,"" I called my order in and rushed over to Tao to pick up my precious lava cake. Gimme a break, it was my last chance!

I got dropped off at the lobby and ran in to pick up my order, but when I looked in the bag I noticed they didn't have plastic forks. What?! I guess I'm probably the only one who has ever ordered something to go, so I sat down at the bar to take just one bite. Yum... (No I did not use my hands). 

My friend went to the bathroom so I decided to continue eating while I waited. So I'm sitting at the bar by myself eating chocolate cake out of a plastic box, with chocolate on my face, and 10 bartenders gawking at me.

Me: (Gorging myself with chocolate cake)
Bartender: Would you like a...uh... glass of water?
Me: *om nom nom* no thanks *nom nom*

By the time my friend was back from the bathroom, the box was empty. Needless to say, after hearing me rave about getting this chocolate cake all weekend long, my friends who waited in the car, were shocked when I came back empty handed. 

I can't say I remember exactly how the cake tasted because I wolfed it down so fast, but I do remember the taste of victory, and it was glorious.",5gbkhlWANGVzQYi_0m3vOQ,3,3,4,bq_KRX__zL4WGJWQKEwE5g

Food--I got the coconut crusted shrimp which was actually pretty decent and id consider getting again (at a different restaurant). The $5 small side of brown rice seemed a bit unnecessary. Everyone else's food was well below average. Orange chicken would be better at Panda Express. Egg roll appetizers were dry and better frozen. 

Ambiance---incredibly culturally insensitive AND inaccurate. Not sure who's idea it was to put a giant Buddha in a CLUB. But it was a bad one. The restaurant is also scattered with other decor from random unassociated eastern religions.

4974384,2007-08-10,6,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"Friends were in town and they wanted to try the very popular Tao Restaurant.  (It's been reported that the Tao Restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in Vegas!)  Just as we were about to enter the hallway, this VERY large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  Talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!

We were seated upstairs on the balcony overlooking the huge Buddha.  As menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  As I perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, I didn't even know where to begin.  My fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. Grilled Kobe Sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.

The menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  I could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (I would not consider Tao to be romantic at all.)

In the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  And this is what we got:

Squab Lettuce Wraps ($14) - This came with five lettuce leaves.  A decent amount to fill all the leaves.  The squab mixture was a bit too moist and the BF found it too sweet.  I had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  There was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.

Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth ($16) - A clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  Very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  A very light and delicate dish.  

Sashimi of Kobe Beef with Fresh Wasabi Sauce ($28) - Beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  We couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  Lovely taste and clean.  However, I didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.

Pork Spring Roll with Thai Chili Sauce ($11) - This order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  The spring roll was decent, nothing particular special about it.  The Thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.

Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ($34) - Very good, but I guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece of Chilean sea bass?

Roasted Thai Buddha Chicken ($26) - We must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  It did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces of chicken in it, including the drumstick.  It was okay, nothing particularly special about it.

Jasmine White Rice ($4) - Of course we had to order some rice!  We got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.

Overall, the food was good.  Definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a certain kind of clientele.  You'll be amused to find things like Kung Pao Chicken ($26) and Grilled Prime Porterhouse with Wasabi Dipping Sauce ($88) on the same menu.  We decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended Giant Fortune Cookie ($10) or Fuji Apple Springroll ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (We actually drove over to Luv-It Frozen Custard instead!)

Service is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and Tao fails in this department.  I was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the BF to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (Uh, who does that?!)  As they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  I felt like I was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  I'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  The waitstaff should take a few lessons from Rosemary's Restaurant's waitstaff.  That's what I call service!

At the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  And it was...just okay.  They asked if we were going to the club afterward and I said yes and asked if they had any passes.  What they do have is a ""line pass,"" which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  However, you will still have to pay cover.  (I think this part is rather ridiculous.  They should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  With the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  Not the best pass I would say.
  
Tao Restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.    There are better places where service is valued higher.

My writing cannot possibly do the ambiance of this place justice. The vibe is dimly lit, serene, meditative, Buddhist style meets sexy, bold, modernism. The decor is absolutely incredible, and we loved overlooking the GIANT Buddha statue sitting on top of the coy fish pond. I could not get enough of how sexy and awe inspiring the decor was, hard to believe it is located within a resort. So, so, soooooo beautiful! Everything is trendy and Asian inspired.

The outstanding service goes beyond words. Every staff member from waiter, to hostess, to bus boy was beyond friendly, high energy, had big personality, helpful, and professional. Whoever trains the staff here needs to give lessons to every dining establishment in the country.Tao does it right. The ambiance and price makes you feel like you're somewhere exclusive, but the service lets you know without a doubt that your service is appreciated. Bravo, bravo, bravo. Cannot say enough. 

Now...the reason there's a collective pile of saliva under me....the food. We can never decide what to order at Tao, so we close our menus and make our waiter order for us, and they are always spot on. Ordered the lobster dumplings as an appetizer. SO flavorful, large dumplings with a delicious, full bodied sauce with mushrooms amazing. I couldn't even finish my share. For a meal we split the Peking duck for two. The closest I've ever had to an out of body experience. Holy _____. The crispiest, best, most tender, most juicy, most PERFECT DUCK I HAVE EVER HAD. We tried a new rice with Chinese sausage and a fried egg on top whipped together right at the table for you...amazing. Despite the full term food baby inside my stomach, and the hatred I had for myself for eating so much, I forged on and demanded that we try the fried bread pudding with vanilla ice cream, chocolate sticks, and bananas foster sauce...biggest smile ever. Servers gave us awesome suggestions on things to do after dinner, but guess what I did? NAP! :) 

I am so impressed with Tao and this location lived up to every expectation I had. My favorite restaurant ever!

I would definitely ask about the specials as well, we ordered items of the special menu and were very much impressed. The only thing to keep in mind is that most items on the menu are in basted in various sweet type sauces. There are not a lot of spicy, tangy or non-sweet options.

The wise and skilled waiter (Jake) sagely suggested that we set an approximate cost per person of around $70 or so (not including drinks) and he bring out multiple entrees and serve family style. We had a few vegetarians in the group.

This plan worked very very well. The vegetarian dishes (kung pao tofu, spring rolls, vegetable dumplings, sake-flavored mushrooms) were all quite good. The Sea Bass skewers were out of this world. Also quite good were the lobster dumplings. Service was excellent at all times, though this might have been influenced by a VIP in our group. B/c said VIP among other stuff we were treated to sushi, some apps and a dessert platter with a giant fortune cookie stuffed with yum, ice cream, apple dumplings, pocky, and stuff similar to cannolis. The dessert was good, but definitely not the best stuff that this place has. If you are looking to save money, skip dessert here.

My children had not been in a restaurant this high-class before, but they handled it pretty well.  We were seated and taken care of well.   One bright example of how well they took care of us was that I asked what the staff would recommend for a diabetic patron. She gave us some good choices.  We ended up going with the shrimp lettuce wraps with Asian stir fry vegetables, and it worked out very well.  

I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai, and I loved it.   There were various layers of flavor in the dish. It wasn't too spicy for me, but did have a lovely hint of something that made it unique.   I also ordered some tea, and a family member and I really enjoyed it.   I am really picky about my tea, and it was good quality tea with a great flavor. Just a hint of strong smoke-like flavors, but not too much to overpower it.   

I had had a celebration that day, and happened to mention it to the server.  She brought me a dessert: their signature dish.  The giant fortune cookie was loaded with white chocolate mousse, milk chocolate mousse, and different kinds of fruit, including cantaloupe, nice, tart raspberries, strawberries, and dragon fruit.

The Peking Duck Spring Rolls are a great appetizer here amongst other things.

We have an Asian server with a man bun who take care of us all night long and seems to be loving his job. We ordered three food items. Pineapple chicken and soy that's too sweet cos they probably throw too many soy sauce and pineapple juice in it. The pepper beef that has too many oyster sauce in it and the kimchi fried rice that has sufficient amount of lobster yet a little too little of a kimchi. Although we send the pineapple chicken back, the management way of handling the problem are top notch.

We ended up ordering another sushi roll instead that arrived pretty fast and tasty. When I tell the server that it is my wife's birthday today and that I would like to order that special dessert. He absolutely nail his job by proceeding with the most important thing he can do by wishing my wife a happy birthday.

Quick tips:

1.  Stick to small plates and starters.  Most creative.

2.  Skip the nigiri sushi.  Expensive and not spectacular.

3.  Lots of spicy, hot flavors from chili and wasabi.  This is drinking food.

If you must have sushi, top props to the spicy lobster roll with black tobiko, king crab California roll (made with real king crab), and the crispy soft shell crab roll served with a yuzu mayonnaise.  All are familiar just made with top quality ingredients and a good flavor twist that makes you long for a second bite.

Small plate standouts include an unexpectedly good grilled Chilean sea bass served with a satay sauce. Never thought what is essentially peanut butter would go so well with fish.  The Thai crab cakes with mango chili sauce while not purely crab meat just pairs so well with the sauce.  Well balanced.  The spicy tuna tartar on crispy rice crackers, a great twist on the classic.  Outstanding.  Bold flavor, cool tuna, crispy rice cracker.  So much contrast make for a delicious bite of food.  Finally the  kobe beef sashimi with fresh wasabi; yum.

Do not pass on the Peking duck spring roll with hoisin sauce or the lobster and shrimp spring roll with spicy pineapple sauce.  Big bold flavors.  Textual contrast at its best.

Finally, if you never had avocado tempura try it.  The warm avocado has the creamy texture of uni.  Very different.  Very good.

Note:  Dining at Tao should be social so bring a group of friends.  The food is meant to be shared.  

Special note:  For the guys, dining at Tao does not give you any special VIP privileges to enter the Tao nightclub later in the evening.  Ladies, work the magic.

Mandarin Sizzled Fried Rice with Peking Duck ($15). This was good! It had lots of flavor, and a slightly larger portion than I was expecting...but still a little spendy overall.

Lacquered Roast Pork ($13). This was a little chewy and the sauce was pretty thick. Can't touch the cheaper versions in Chinatown!  Pass

And to finish, the Dessert Platter. This thing was HUGE!! Enough food for the 10+ of us! We said our dinner here was for an anniversary, so this monster was gratis! There were some goodies there...nothing amazing, but all were good!

I made my reservations on Open Table each time.  No issues, and the restaurant called to confirm on the morning of...unusual for an Open Table reservation in my experience, but not out-of-line in my opinion.  We have never waited for our table...always when we have arrived we are immediately taken back.

Food, and drinks each visit have been exceptional.  My husband has had the Hot and Sour soup with Shrimp Toast, Jasmine Rice, and the Chilean Sea Bass.  He LOVED them all.  I have tried the Orange Chicken (before I was GF), the Jasmine Rice, the Pad Thai rice noodles with chicken, and the Satay of Chicken with Peanut Sauce.  If I could get this food from home, I would be eating here once a week...without a doubt!  

We have had great service on each trip with an offer of a stamp to enter the club as a VIP after it opened for the night (bypassing the line, and the cover).  The Club is a different review, but also a definite must-see at least once while in Vegas.

The decor is really cool in here I must admit that (hence the reason for the extra star).  What I don't like about this club (where should I begin is more like it):  They let in too many effin' people in this place.  I don't appreciate getting crushed like a sardine or getting dry humped by random strangers on the dance floor.  Just say no to STD's OK?  I'm pretty sure the amount of people on the dance floor violated fire codes.  I couldn't even move for a good ten minutes cuz I was either getting pushed by people trying to get on the dancefloor, people decided to walk by me cuz for some reason there was no other space for them to walk past, or people bumped into me cuz they were trying to dance.  Not my idea of a good time.  The only time I put up with that noise is when I'm seeing my favourite band in the entire world.

I'm sure if you're a girl, you can get in no matter what you're wearing.  Sucks if you're a guy though.  Also some friends we were trying to meet somehow got invited to get on the VIP list but then later they asked them how they got on the list.  We got attitude from a bouncer saying ""You can't bring in a shopping (plastic) bag to the club.""  OK, well we went shopping before going to your place.  Luckily, my friends had very large purses so they got creative and shoved the bag in that.  Shoot us.  There's no such thing as coat check here I guess.  They really oughta invest in one of those, it's good for business.  

I'm not a fan of hip hop clubs to begin with, but seriously 30 minutes of a SexyBack mash up filled in with clips of various other top 40 of course?  I like a little more variety.  Last time I checked this was Vegas...play something a little more hip.  I went to a club in my boring suburban town that played similar stuff...I guess DJ AM was at this club too perhaps?  I'm sure this place is tons of fun if you arrive early and leave early, but if you get here around midnight or later, forgetaboutit.  No room to dance.  No room to walk.  Get me to the bar for some water please.  Confusing ""EXIT"" signs too.  I had to ask five different staff members how to get out of this joint and I ended up back where I started.  Cover was also $20 which I guess is ""reasonable"" by Vegas standards.  I couldn't even enjoy the cool decor in here because I just wanted to get the eff out of there.  Not my idea of a good time.

Service just isn't the same as before, but he definitely gave us a preview of how it used to be.

The food was spectacular from the sushi, to fried rice, pot stickers and special sauce, the salad, and I forgot the other food we had.  

1.)  I was impressed with the sushi and could have had more if my tummy could hold it.  
2.)  The salad is not something I've had before and that's what stuck to my mind after everything.  The dressing had a sweet and sour taste to it.  The sweet ginger gave it the zing it had.  
3.)  Fried rice was good and had the right amount of sodium to it.  Most fried rice I've had have been very oily and can feel the oil reach my skin to create acne.  This wasn't like that.

Definitely make a reservation. Place gets busy fast. 

Our waitress was awesome. Down to earth. Funny. Pleasant. Relatable. And most importantly , accommodating.  

We started with the tuna on rice cakes. Awesome! Great portion size. Fresh. Not oily. Not overly spicy either. 

We then had the cauliflower. Granted it was a bit on the sweet side, we devoured it quickly. Yummers! 

Next up was the chicken pad Thai. Delicious! I was about to scarf that down as well. Unfortunately it was a bit too spicy for my wife (it was barely spicy lol) it had a nice kick to it. 

Our waitress replaced it quickly with a chicken fried rice. How good can chicken fried rice really be? Oh it was all that and a bag of chips! (Bag of chips not included) Not oily at all. Seasoned well. Delicious. 

Fortune cookie dessert! Holy momma Mia! It was HHHHHHYYYYUUUUUUUUGE (they're making fortune cookies great again ... Get it? ) filled with mouse. So good!

Well, we finally got to eat at the famous Tao restaurant in Vegas. Let me just say I left feeling pretty underwhelmed.

The best compliment I can give this restaurant is it has awesome décor and bumping music. Its rare to eat at an Asian food restaurant where they have Drake playing in the background.

They said plates here are meant to be shared but they were super small portions of food. We tried the pork potstickers and they were almost cute how small they were. Like a large wad of gum. The lobster and shrimp spring rolls were the best thing I tried here all night. Amazing.

As for everything else, we had the duck fried rice and a noodle plate. Those were more than enough to share between the 4 of us. They both lacked in flavor but heavy on salt.

The $50 sirloin and broccoli was not nearly as big as it looks in pictures. One small helping between 4 of us and it was gone. I could have probably finished it all myself. The Orange chicken was delicious but again, not a lot to go around between 4 people.

I guess they are more generous with their rice and noodle plates because they are cheap to make but skimpy on the meat dishes.

Also, be prepared to wait. Had a late 10pm reservation on a Friday night and wasn't seated until 10:45. We were heading to the nightclub upstairs afterward and the promoter requested we get there by midnight or risk losing our table so we felt a little rushed to get through dinner.

I don't regret coming here because I had wanted to try this place out for some time now but it was a bit of a let down",JLqFX-w2a4CyiP0wttt81A,1,0,2,Tcp40dR36vM-VgBGKZq59w

I was little bit skeptical about going to eat at this place.  First off, I'm from San Francisco - it's hard to top the taste of Bay Area Asian foods that sell for a cheaper rate than Tao, and 2nd - it was ridiculously loud because Tao night club is right above the restaurant.  We had a reservation and still had to wait about 30 minutes.  Fine... I got that it was busy.  But after not having dinner, and being a little loopy after the Elton John show - I wasn't a very happy camper and I wanted to bail.

But the dinner was for a birthday and I didn't want to disappoint by being a Crabby Patty.  So I dealt with it.

Since we were a large group of 10, we were seated in a nice little alcove in the very back of the restaurant.  It was nice and cozy and I felt at ease.  Thank heavens we weren't in the middle of the restaurant where it was crowded. I was crabby enough as it was to have to deal with the lack of space.  

We had a nice view of Mike Tyson as he sat at the table behind us with a lovely female friend.  We tried to be slick in taking pictures of him as each one of us placed our order.

When the food came out, I wasn't so impressed by the presentation but I figured I shouldn't judge by looks alone.  I ordered the Chicken Yellow Curry.  The smell was heavenly. I saw the little pieces of lemongrass in it. That was different for me. I've never had Chicken Yellow Curry with lemongrass. I poured some curry on my rice and took a spoonful... it was fantastic that I had to offer some over to everyone else for a taste.  The chicken potstickers on the table tasted fresh and succulent.  My sister had a beef dish that was just DIVINE.  But my favorite was the dish I ordered.  And today I still crave for that wonderful burst of flavor on my tongue.  As I always say...

Free Parking in Vegas baby! 

PLACE:
Asian theme located in Venetian Hotel at the entrance there is ladies naked and their nipple are covered with petals . Upon entrance if you made a booking through open table no one will greet you because the entrance to the night club is the same so as soon you get there you have to locate the person who's in charge of your dinner reservation and it's pretty dark . It's located on left side in the very dark unorganized corner .  
The Buddha is beautiful set in the middle . Plenty of seating available in a Friday night . Loud music is being played since the setting is more lounge bar and the Tao night club is located upstairs not a dinner set up style . 

SERVICE: 
They are pretty fast and the girl who served us pretty nice and quick but so cheers for her! And they do stamp you here to get free entrance in the nightclub if you order any food in their main entree . 

FOOD:
*Pricy for what it is, well it's Vegas so expect it! 
*Size of the service in sushi is pretty good 
*Thai noodle with pork serving good for 2 person   
Overall not worth it , better check other dining that deliver the best food rather than pretentious gimmicky place  . but if you wanna avoid paying for the ticket in the night club and eat here instead automatically they will give you free stamp ticket for you guys to get into the Tao night club 

*the upstairs of Tao Asia bistro is the Tao nightclub

Peking duck was the star of the show with its crispy skin and made for delicious wraps.  Phad thai was good but probably as good as any other phad thai you've had.  Sea bass was nice and flavorful.

I'm not one to look at the price but this place made me do it. I could go to any Asian restaurant for the same food but for less money and better taste.

We started the night with some tasty cocktails. I wanted to try Love Potion #9 (Grey Goose Cherry Noir, cranberry and lychee puree) but Angela H beat me to it so to be different,  I got a Dragon Slayer (Bacardi Dragonberry, Ginger liqeur, strawberry and togarashi spice) instead. Black Pearl ((Henessy Black, blackberries, yuzu and agave nectar). The drinks were pretty awesome!

Wasabi-Crusted Filet Mignon with Tempura Onion Rings:
This one was the best value for $38. Good and tender filet. However,  this one came with fat...and I'm not a fan of animal fat.  The wasabi crust was great and not overpowering/sinus-clearing. 3.5/5

Mandarin Sizzled Fried Rice with Peking Duck:
The duck was great and overall this was good fried rice. But for $15 and a serving for 1 person? Not so much. 3/5

Lacquered Roast Pork:
Chinese BBQ pork is what this is. You get about 7 slices of pork. I mean, it wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular either. Go to Chinatown instead. 2/5

Bottle service at the club was a total rip off, certainly not worth the 400 bucks.  We had to walk up 3 flights of what was probably the most gross filthy old staircase I've ever seen (in heels!, wtf?). We were seated outside by the bar on these crappy mat-bench things (which were dirty and dusty).  They looked like wrestling mats that you'd see in a high school gymnasium. Also, these gross old hags came over and sat on the bench next to us (they didnt buy a bottle or pay to sit there) and were smoking cigarettes. We had to track down security to ask them to leave. Anyway, the environment was so lame and I was so irritated that I drank waaaay to much (so I wouldn't be aware how badly everything sucked). I blacked out and woke up the next day in my room at the Encore. I was delighted to see that my wallet (and the 3 grand inside it) had been stolen. Being in Vegas with no ID, wonderful, let me tell ya. Needless to say, it was a very disappointing birthday. If you are looking for a special experience, this is not the place. I don't understand why it gets so much press, it's a real dump. Now I know why they have to pay celebs so much to go here.  If they weren't getting paid, they wouldnt be caught dead here.

It is very clear that this restaurant only welcomes those for whom money is of no consequence as they literally tried to take as much money from us as possible.

First of all, we were asked, ""Still or sparkling?"" Thinking these were our only choices and still must equal tap water, we asked for still. That was a $24 mistake. Although we ended up getting the manager to take it off our bill, it caused a huge hassle.

When ordering my $14 vegetarian meal, the waiter stopped me mid-sentence and told me I needed to try their Kung Pau tofu dish. Although mildly annoyed to be told my choice was wrong, I was excited to try this off-menu item.  It ended up being too spicy for my taste and I switched meals with someone else.  Fast -forward to when the check came and I found out the meal he had convinced me to order was almost twice the price of the meal I originally had picked out. Needless to say, I felt a little cheated.

The meal I did end up eating was good.... Vegan Pad Thai with Gluten free noodles.

In thinking about the best experience that I've had in a restaurant recently, I'd have to say Tao in Las Vegas.  The combination of the tasty foods, fun decor, and excellent service makes Tao Las Vegas deserving of my first 5-star rating!  Of course, the Vegas excitement adds to the total experience.

This isn't one of Yelpers' favorite joints to dine at in Vegas based on the ratings, so I'll share a couple of tips of what I've done and hopefully that'll be helpful to you folks out there:

- Making reservations here is a must!  Without reservations, this place is impossible to get into, unless you know people, or do the ol' slipping a bill into the handshake action.  (If you do, try $20 or higher)

- Come with friends that are ready to party, because this is a party joint!  Meet at the bar, so that if you have folks coming in from different hotels, you can enjoy the drinks while you wait.

- Once you're seated, order sharable appetizers, like the Edamame, Satay Chicken, or  Thai Stuffed Shrimps.

- If you like Sake, they have a pretty good selection of Sakes.  If you haven't tried the Nigori Sake (unfiltered), I'd suggest at least trying that.  The best way is to ask the server to give you the rundown.We had the Voice in the Mist bottle and it was yummy!

- For your entree, you MUST get Miso-Glazed Chilean Seabass!!  It's my favorite fish entree in the world!  Savory white flaky tender bits of tasty fish... oh my.  It definitely melts in your mouth yet creates a flavor explosion.  So good!  My friend likes the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon, but I think it's not nearly as good as the Seabass.

I've been to Tao now for 3 years.  I've had a great experience every single time.  I now cannot imagine going to Vegas without my Chilean Seabass experience at Tao.",N3CjnVNnIb1djqXPjhI4uw,2,1,5,qi8v6ui5z4mTCXhJJkdftA

Whatever marinade/cooking prep they're using makes it WAY too sweet and destroys the delicate meat to where it's unrecognizable as sea bass.  Sea bass is such a light fish it needs a light preparation with no or very little marinade.  A little salt, pepper, lemon juice and garlic are all you need! For that much money I can think of a LOT of other places I'd rather eat. The service was great and the only reason they got two stars. The ambience and decor are very cheesy 80s too.

If you give me a good service, I'll tip above and beyond the 20% you talk on automatically.

The food is Asian fusion, with strong Chinese influences, and a bit of Japanese and Thai thrown in.

Anyway, the food was okay - the prawns were over-cooked, but the beef was good, and the eggplant was delicious.  Edamame was good, but that's hard to screw up.  On the other hand, the prices were exorbitant for the quality and small portion sizes.

I actually ate here twice on this trip to Las Vegas and I was extremely disappointed both times. The first time we went we ordered a couple of appetizers and a few sushi rolls. The lobster wonton was good but the sushi rolls were not. They came out 2 minutes after ordering them meaning that they had been made well in advance and they were no where near as good as in the past. We also got several piecess of salmon, tuna and yellowtail sashimi. In the past they would have brought us one big tray with all of this sushi as well as lemon, cucumber and other extras that drastically change the flavor of the sushi in a good way. This time it was quickly thrown on a small plate and it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.

I ended going again because some other friends had just gotten in town and wanted to try it out. Once again I was disappointed. The sashimi was still way over priced. We go the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos and ponzu and it was good but not $20 good for 4 small (really small) pieces. The sea bass was good but not good enough to out weigh the negatives.

The atmosphere is still fun but it is slightly louder then I remember. You can tell that the place is going downhill in popularity as well since there were over 50% of the tables were empty on a Friday night at 9:00.",YoEQ1M5aUmiSstq9PA0tDA,0,0,2,E7l5tJ1tRauYbnbhXzspFA

5445059,2017-08-21,1,fQt4D34vcJNtEf8Q4zte3w,"TAO is a well-oiled machine. It was reportedly the highest-grossing independent restaurant in America last year and there're some good reasons for that. Giant space (with a giant buddha sitting in the middle), giant menu, conveniently located inside the Venetian on the Strip, with a nightclub upstairs offering constant celeb sighting. I enjoyed seeing how impressive this is as a business case as much as, if not more than, I enjoyed the food itself.

TAO is the epitome of vibe dining; the entrance is lined with stone tubs filled with water and rose petals, the interior dimly lit with black cobblestones, bamboo, Buddha statues, Sumo wrestler paintings. Front-of-house is extremely efficient - they literally walk super fast; thus don't expect overly warm chatty service, but our waitress managed to take our drink and food orders, check on us, get the check, all in proper times, and our water glasses were never empty. On hearing that we were staying at the Venetian for my birthday trip, she brought out a complementary dessert with bday festivities. It's hard to hit all the service marks in such a giant, fluid venue, but TAO managed to do so.

Enough for my restaurant-working nitpicks, onto the food itself. The sand pot with lobster, shrimp and scallops is a satisfying blend of flavors, although there's too much black bean sauce for my liking. The pad thai is fairly average thus would not recommend spending $$$ on it here. Nigiri and rolls are generally fine but no standouts - which could be a good thing because you should save room for desserts! The giant fortune cookie is amazing; I like how they didn't just make a standard fortune cookie 10 times bigger, but also hid inside white and dark chocolate mousse. The mousse is silky creamy and not overpowering; the white and dark chocolate also provides a nice contrast. My bf usually prefers milk chocolate while I prefer dark and we both found a happy middle ground. I'd come back for this dessert alone. I do really think their New York location should have this dish though; wouldn't ""black & white cookie"" be a nicer pun in NYC?",5iRZ2_9OL1CQehvGf6BNSw,1,1,4,Dx2Tw99EkBF8CQ5YCqj5yQ

Ok the food - we started with chicken lollipops (cooked to perfect tenderness yet the skin was crispy and covered in this amazing aromatic Chinese 5 spice sauce), pork bao buns (steamed then pan fried - honestly I could've done without the fry, it was too greasy for me - more steam!), and hot&sour soup (great flavor with all the fix'ns of mushrooms and bamboo shoots, but no egg and the broth was more glutinous than rich broth - too much cornstarch chef!), finally a sushi roll (I don't remember the name, but it wasn't WOW - the sushi roll menu wasn't impressive. If you want raw fish just order from the sashimi section skip the rolls; the fish was still high quality). 

Dinner consisted of Signapore Mei Fun noodles (perfect portion for sharing and bursting with flavor), chili chicken (a savory dish of plump bite size chicken breast breaded and sauced up! Not too hot but enough kick!), and grilled ahi tuna (as expected, rare, but I think the grill was too hot or it cooked too long because the edging seemed thicker and dried out instead of thin and flaky; still fresh and good flavors from the sauce n veggies).

The food was mediocre and the service was completely horrible. I would be more adamant in refusing to come back except I'm probably not going back to Vegas anytime soon anyway.

My friend made a reservation at Tao for a late dinner. Some members of our group were a little late, but still made it to the restaurant before our reservation was cancelled. For no particular reason, the waitstaff at Tao decided that the appropriate action was to make our group wait before seating us. During the 1+ hour wait, my friend kept going to the host to find out the table situation, as the rest of the group watched patrons finish their meals and the restaurant clear out. Partway through our wait there were numerous empty tables, yet it took another 15-30 minutes to be seated.

My friend complained to the manager of the restaurant, who apologized profusely and brought over our waiter, and made lavish promises to make up for the ordeal our group had been through. They promised free shots, a couple free appetizers, and ""special service"" from the chef. Well, we received the free shots and some edamame. I never figured out what the ""special service"" was... 

Overall, the experience flat-out sucked. Food was okay, but that's probably only because I was starving by the time it arrived at the table. The time we saved waiting in line was negated by the wait for a table. And if the manager makes an apology I expect him to HONOR it.",PG8co0G-wemzNwll9NJlaQ,2,0,1,faCKyB7WOzRHaBTQwKK4QA

We went off recommendations of other Yelpers for our dining choices.  I tried the Chilean sea bass, while the missus had the Wasabi encrusted steak.  The fish was very sweet, but pleasant and flavorful.  The meat was smoky and rich.

The preparation was excellent, but for the prices, I would have preferred larger portions.  It's very much a ""presentation"" meal, meaning that it's very pretty to look at, but that factor is likely factored in the overall meal cost.  The veggies were good as well, however.

The other factor of the restaurant is the restrooms.  ""What"", you say?  Hear me out.  They are not listed ""Men"" and ""Women"".  They are listed ""Yin"" and ""Yang"".  I stood there, having no idea what the Hell to do, until deductive logic forced me to go in the door next to the statue without breasts on it.

How do you get eight guys into one of Vegas' more popular and busier nightclubs during one of its busiest weekends without purchasing bottle service or bypassing the massive queue to get in without greasing any of the bouncers?

Answer:
Under almost all circumstances it's practically impossible.  Dining at Tao Asian Bistro, however, allowed us (eight guys) to get a ""line pass"" stamp so that after we had finished dinner we would bypass the main line to get into Tao Nightclub and Tao Beach and pay only half the cover charge allowing us access into both. 

With regards to the food, I ordered the diver sea scallops in red curry sauce which was actually quite good.

I think the crux of the issue here is that it's a restaurant AND a nightclub.  So, you get (what is in my opinion) some pretty decent Asian Fusion cuisine and attentive service in the restaurant marred by the typical nightclub attitude - ""self-important"" is the phrase that comes to mind.

First and foremost, be sure not to stand in the wrong place.  My group of four were informed not to stand where we were standing three separate times in the first 20 minutes at the venue.  The first was when we were in line to check in for our 9pm reservation behind some other folks that were taking an impossibly long time at the host stand to notify the host of their arrival.  A ""welcome to Tao"" would have been nice but instead it was more like ""be sure to stand to the left if you have a dining reservation.""  Gee, thanks.

After being informed at the host stand that they were running ""a little behind,"" we headed to the bar to grab some drinks.  The end of the bar was open so we headed over there, but very shortly after ordering our $50 round we were informed by another bouncer that we couldn't stand at that side of the bar.  I informed him rather indignantly that we wouldn't even be in the bar in the first place if they were able to seat us in a timely fashion for the reservation we'd made a month ago.  So I took my time signing the check and then we headed to another area of the bar where we were told yet again not to stand where we were standing.

Things got better once we were finally seated at our table - fortunately it was only a 15 minute delay which was marginally acceptable (in my opinion, any material delay when a reservation is involved should warrant some free drinks).  I do like the food here, even though several of the menu options are somewhat uninspiring (read: Kung Pao Chicken).  The sushi is good but overpriced and the shabu shabu is fun but easily recreated at home.  I think the small plates are probably where the best options lie, but you do need to order several of them to make a meal.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive - a nice contrast to the police state that was the bar area.

It was the food and ambience that brought me back a second time but I think I can find something comparable in Las Vegas on a future visit,  somewhere where they care a little more about friendly service and are not focused so much on cattle-herding the club kids.",0s8Kh0M4EEM41LEAaiZtYg,1,1,2,_NBU6XdSsi5z4GsICRP_1w

I was very excited for this restaurant, amidst all the hype and reviews.  The big buddha especially was appealing.  We considering just popping by for the club at first, but decided we may as well just eat here instead.  Boy do I regret that.

First, the service.  For a high-scale, populous, touristy area such as where Tao is located, I would except only the best of service.  This started on the wrong foot, when my party was running 15 minutes late, and called out of politeness to notify and apologize to the restaurant like we always do.  Here's a first:  when I asked if our reservation could be pushed back by 15 minutes due to a slight delay, the hostess replied, ""15 minutes should be okay.. any later, and it's up to the manager's discretion on your reservation.""  What?  What kind of BS rudeness is this.  I can understand that for a top-notch restaurant, space is limited and therefore any outrageously late reservations / no shows will be given to people who have been waiting for a seat.  But we were only 15 minutes late, and by the time we arrived, there was no one waiting in line.  That just added salt to the wound - if there had been an extremely long line with multiple aggravated parties waiting to be seated, sure.  But don't spout some BS to us over the phone and cause us to rush when it wasn't even needed with a passive aggressive threat to our reservation.  Also, during my reservation, we had requested a seat next to the large Buddha.  Granted, I understand requests are not always given, but it was for my girlfriend's graduation dinner, and the fact that there were empty seats around the Buddha when we passed by it made me wonder what exactly the manager does when training his employees on the ideals of service.  Nevertheless, we spoke up when they attempted to seat us in some dark corner, and waited while the hostess ""discussed"" with another our seating preferences, and reseated us after 2-3 minutes.  

Moving on, the decor.  They get an additional star for this, otherwise this would have been a one-star review.  As a tourist, we love seeing flashy, new things - my camera is always ready in my hand.  First, they had multiple beautiful rose petal water baths in the entrance (for visual pleasure of course).  The light was dimly set, but not dark enough where you can't see a thing due to the illuminations of all the other decor.  Aside from the various Asian inspired ornaments we saw, the Big Buddha was again the most appealing factor of this restaurant.  Definitely bring a camera if you're the type who wants to see things like this - it'll be one of your only high points of the night.

Third, food.  Meh.  PF Changs puts the same amount of flavor, for 1/3 of the price.  It's basically just heavy MSG foods with some fancy names, and more expensive types of food such as lobster.  I won't go too deep into what we had, but our party had a variety of different types ranging from sushi rolls to lobster to fish.  The fish was the best - it was flaky, with a great texture and the right amount of sauce.  Everything else fell far below my expectations.  

Fourth, price.  Ugh.  $35-$40 per entree.  And I feel as if I could get most of this from my local chinese take-out, minus some expensive stuff like lobster.  However, just because you offer a few expensive dishes doesn't mean you can charge premium price.  If the taste isn't there, it's not worth it.  If the service is subpar, it's not worth it.  I would have been fine with Tao, possibly giving it 3-4 stars, if these dishes are maximum $20.  But for what we got - a rehash of what we could get anywhere else, for up to $40+?  Hell no.

Summary:  Unless you really need to fill your tourist bucket list and see the Big Buddha, avoid this place.",R-de4En7awhk4srgofe8Ag,1,0,2,H6xB4yjpiVpg10u4SVL1rQ

The host made us wait and said ""I'll see what I can do"" when we said we didn't have a reservation, giving us the impression that they might be booked. Inside, there were enough tables to make my girlfriend and I roll our eyes. 

 The Good: The drinks were amazing. We had the Tiger Lilly and the Black Pearl. The desert was also amazing (molten chocolate cake with coconut ice cream).  My girlfriend really liked the spicy smoked salmon roll. We thought the jalapeño yellowtail was decent. The decor is really pretty. 

 The bad: The bus staff rushed around us and passed things over our head unsteadily. It makes it hard to relax when you worry that your girlfriend is going to get trampled because she's near a service entrance. The waiter was nice, but paced the meal poorly, so we spent a lot of time just waiting after we finished our jalapeño yellowtail. The music was also very loud and made it hard for us to hear each other or the waiter.

The ugly: The sushi wasn't fresh. The wild yellowtail, the white tuna and the hawaiian snapper were all virtually indistinguishable because they shared a common tinge of whatever coolers they were in. The soft shell crab roll was pretty tasteless and the sauce didn't add anything other than moisture to a dry roll. 

  My tiny girlfriend was hungry again after a couple of hours in the casino and we ended up going for another meal, so was that $130+tip we spent at Tao worth it?",zaC3L_qy28bMLIvnoMng8Q,1,0,2,-tIKWfDNUPPow-Pm-Kq5Cg

If there was a way to take home and/or replicate the decor of Tao, I would in an instant. (I'm a sucker for asian decor, but I digress.)

The service was phenomenal. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable on the menu, although he did try to sell us on the most expensive things available (go figure.) We had show reservations at NYNY and we were finished with more than enough time to spare.

My boyfriend had the hamachi (yellowtail) to start with. The fish was fresh and delicious, although the sushi rice left something to be desired. For an entree, he had the Hong Kong XO Shrimp with Long Beans and Jasmine Rice, which he loved.

Eating out for me has been pretty rough lately since I developed some weird food intolerances. There's very little in the way of flavorful food that I can have without giving me a terrible stomachache. 

Since I'm not a fan of seafood, I decided to go with the Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings with Crunchy Cucumbers and a side of jasmine rice. These were the best dumplings both my boyfriend and I had *ever* had (and probably will ever have.) If you like vegetables at all, you HAVE to get these. So full of flavor and healthy to boot!

They have a nice sized menu.  I would have given them 5 stars but there were a couple of things I found weird.  I am a vegetarian and told this to the waiter.  He helped me out by telling me what was safe to eat.  There was a side of broccoli and he told me it was made with chicken stock.  The food tasted freshly prepared (which for the price I would hope it is) so I don't really understand why the dish could not be made vegetarian as other restaurants do for me.  I ended up ordering vegetable fried rice and asked if they could add pineapple because I saw they used it in another dish.  The waiter told me he could ask but was not sure the chef would do it.  They did not as he tried to make a nice gesture and brought me some raw pineapple on the side when my rice came out.  Again, I think it is weird that the chef would be so rigid.

Other than that I have to say the food was delicious.  My rice was very good.  The vegetable dumplings were so good we got a second order. The vegetable sides I was able to order were tasty.  My husband had a pepper steak dish and said other than some peppers being overwhelming was good as well.  

During the reservation we were asked if we were celebrating anything so we let them know we came to Vegas to get married.  They did bring us a surprise dessert which was a great gesture.

Waiter = Davy

SERVICE - The WORSE part of Tao is their service.  It is very very obvious that their waiters want to squeeze as much money out of you as possible.  I understand that people need to make money & waiters want you to order more. Go ahead and make that money, But there has to be a balance that waiters don't cross or else it will be TOO obvious & the customer will give you a 10% tip of the slightly bigger check instead of the 20% they were planning to give if the guy acted like what he was suppose to be, a good waiter.  
When we sat down, we were offered 2 choices of water, both of which they charge for.  The option of bottled water is normal for ""high class"" restaurants everywhere, but it's the a-hole way of wording & tone that pisses you off.  My group of 6 didn't care for the bottled water because we were all ordering cocktails & beers anyways.  So we said ""Just normal tab water is fine"".  A BIG frown on Davy's face, and raises his voice in a mocking tone & says ""In Las Vegas, no one will give you tab water.""  HAHA, a big freakin joke or what?  Couple of us in the group comes to vegas about 5 times a yr for business with the company.  We've been to more than a few trendy restaurants in the 5 star properties.  We went to Shibuya at MGM just 2 nights before, we had a CHOICE of bottled or tab. 

DÉCOR - If you've been to trendy restaurants in LA or NY, there is nothing special about this place.  Don't get pulled in by the hype that the promoters try to put onto the place.  

FOOD - Onto the food selection, Davy tells us ""Its my job to explain the menu to you and I'll be HONEST with you, these are my favorites"" & proceeds to point out the 2 most expensive items on each section of the menu.  As he was doing that, we were just looking at each other like ... look at this clown.  We ordered what we wanted ourselves, again Davy's service starts getting worse.  All the food were very normal, nothing bad, nothing special.

CHECK - When we were done, Davy comes over & said ""You guys have to get desert, everybody's doing it"" What a pathetic half joke half pressure line.  We passed on it.  When he brings the check, we find that its more than what it was suppose to be.  On a closer look, he charged us for the price of entrees for 2 orders when we ordered appetizers.  Davy insisted that he gave us the entrees which we wouldn't know because the portions were all small.  Even if he did, it was his mistake when he took the order as we honestly all heard our friends order the appetizer.  Again, crooks.  

There are PLENTY of nice trendy restaurant/club in Vegas, try any of those.  Don't be sucker & go because of the ""hype"" like we did.",tXARHJGsm2UmXq0Bod9Gmw,1,0,1,yGAXJjwENf4_5FeJ4hlUGQ

I wanted to go to the freaking noodle bar at the hotel because I was kinda grumpy but she insisted. There was this long wait for the night club upstairs but we told the hostess that we were there to eat but we got this weird look as if we were cutting the club line which I tried to ignore.  The main dude- kinda heavy set with a flat top says ""Hi, you guys got reservations?""  That really pisses me off, calling my hot girlfriend a guy.  No...we didn't have reservations.  So...I take the little plastic buzzer and he says it will take 30-45 mins.  I decide to order some dranks as the bar.  When I go up for the second round at the bar for drinks, the chicka dees at the bar are all gawking at how cool my mustache is.  Two douchers walk up behind me, one has total respect for the stache and the other must have had too much to drink because he got in my bubble when I was trying to order my drinks.  The bar tender came by and he started talking and i grabbed that pencil neck and threw him over my shoulder behind me.  So....the wait for the table.  4 jack and cokes in....we get our table and I had to relieve myself.  I go to the bathroom and come to our table...very dark..very loud..trying to be patient because there is a night club upstairs.  So...I'm a little drunk and then our little too cool for school waiter comes up with the dumb a** blow out hair cut comes up and starts his spiel..saying what we ""Have to order""  to go to the night club menue...bro...broham...we don't want to go to the night club.  We just want to eat.  So....I say right off the bat..Could we please get two waters?  He points to our table and says  ""There's two waters right there.""  His tone, his attitude, etc. made me have a Viet Nam Flash back.  Like I said, the joint was dark and loud, I didn't see the two waters and plus I went to the bathroom.  Talk about wanting to chokeslam a doucher for attempting to embarrass me in front of my girlfriend.  This turd needed to be flushed down the drain.  I ordered a pretty extensive order and got up and left.  Bro....Broham...you're a waiter for a reason because you suck at life.  How ever if that's what you choose to do....have some common sense and learn how to take an order.  If I say two more waters, shut your stupid mouth and bring me two more waters.  You were lucky I was in a good mood.  

So we finally end up going to the the noodle bar at the and it was the shizzzzzznitttt.  The service was fantastic and the food was great.  I love you.  And bring me my two waters next time.",vBkBLjqq94fh-m05yEGe_Q,1,2,1,KrzzggribZFIBto8BBr8zQ

There are too many amazing restaurants in Vegas to waste your time here. Turn around and head out, do not pass Go and save your $200.  Seriously, if you have any sort of culinary expectations look for another option.  If you're looking for naked girls in bathtubs, this may be your place (although, no girls in the bathtubs the night we came). 

A group of co-workers were all here for a conference and decided to try this place out since we were staying at the Venetian.  We made a reservation for 8:30 and when we arrived were told we would be seated 'in a few moments' 40 minutes later (and a few times getting the run around by the guy in charge of seating), we finally got to a table.   

Tao highlights the modern Asian fusion movement on their menu.  Unfortunately they also have tried to mask their lack of flavor in dishes by making them overly salty or overly sweet.  This makes everything taste like it's a microwave dinner or some sort of bad Chinese takeout.  

We tried the Thai Crabcakes (WAY too much sauce that was overly sweet with very little spice element, kinda tasted like one you can buy out of a bottle), Hot and Sour Soup (decent, but the shrimp toast was the highlight), Crispy Pork Bao Buns (The pork was again WAY too sweet and the bun had too much dough to pork ratio, this was barely edible),  Crispy Orange chicken (another overly sweet dish that was deemed not even as good as Chinese takeout), Kobe Ribeye (NO way this is real Kobe, despite assurances from our server. It was tough and hard to cut, we had real Kobe at Gordon Ramsey's the next night and there was no comparison) and a few sushi/sashimi rolls (decent, but the rice wasn't well flavored. We had better sushi at the buffet). 

Our waiter was very nice and attentive, but there were certain elements of dishes that were left off (rice for the Orange Chicken, asked for sauce on the side for a couple dishes that wasn't done).

There were no peas or carrots and this made it very plain.  In NYC it was presented in an egg shell; scrambled egg shell filled with the rice inside which made for great presentation as well as ample egg added to the dish.

Vegetable egg rolls were bleh.  Two of us split this appetizer that has 4 pieces and I barely ate one.  Something funky about the taste that I can't pinpoint.

Lastly, Kung Pao Chicken.  This came with too many veggies.  There was some kind of whole green onion or shallot, not sure what it was, along with lots of peppers.  White rice DOES NOT come with the dish, you had to order rice al la carte.  The server also told us this was the special and said it was $28 and when we got the bill it was $31.

If it wasnt for that appitizer the whole meal would've been a bust.

I was surprised my server didn't introduce himself. He then went off for really long periods of time in between ordering drinks and the meal etc. When I did ask him his name he looked at me puzzled that I even asked. 

This places décor is nice, trendy even. 

I came here hoping to get my sushi fix but was left  disappointed. 

How is it possible that if I ordered an 8 piece sashimi plate it comes out after my husbands steak that needs to be cooked?

Save your money and go somewhere else! A group of our friends who made it in the club were split up since women were the only ones allowed upstairs. My fiancee and myself, on the otherhand, refused paying to go in since dinner was terrible and their word meant close to nothing.

I love the walkway inside with the floating rose petals and the super comfy couch to sit on while waiting for your table.  We had reservations but still had to wait about 10 minutes which isn't too bad considering how mobbed it was.

The ambiance is swanky Asian and kind of dark which is nice.  We promptly ordered drinks upon sitting down.  I had the Lychee martini made with Ketel One, Triple Sec, and Lychee puree.  It was fucking fantastic - tasted fruity but not overly sweet and there was a piece of lychee on a skewer in the drink for you to munch on.  I can't say I've ever had this before but I will definitely try any lychee drink from now on.

For food we were a bit random and ordered a few different things.  We had the chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce.  I freakin love Thai peanut sauce so I loved this little appetizer.  Then we had some sushi rolls - I think they were spicy tuna - and they were also pretty good.  For our entree though we had Peking duck since our waitress told us they were known for this dish.  For $34 per person it better be phenomenal and perhaps cure cancer.  It came out and it is basically almost an entire duck served with what amounted to Asian tortillas and hoisin sauce.  There were also some onions and cucumbers to put on your tortilla.  I tried it with the tortilla but it just reminded me of an Asian taco so I just ate the duck alone.  The skin was shiny and crispy and the duck was juicy and fatty.  I don't know if it was worth $34 but it was damn delicious!  Eating it with chopsticks was a bit of a challenge so by the time we got to the drumstick I just picked the meat off with my hands...no shame in my game!

We were a party of five (bachelor party).  Three of us had the steak, another had the sea bass and i had the sword fish.  We also had the dragon roll, two servings of rice, dessert but no drinks.  The total came out to around $52 a head (remember we didn't buy drinks) but here's the best part...

After dinner, they will stamp your left wrist that says ""Line Pass"".  Once you get this stamp, go outside of the restaurant and show it to the guy at the front door.  He will then give you a stamp on your right wrist (Chinese character) that will ""get you in and out of the nightclub as much as you want all night long, no waiting in line"".

So really, you can pay cover charge of $30 and wait in line for hours and hours (the line went outside the casino) or you can have a nice dinner and be able to get in and out all night long and not wait in line for an extra $22.  

And by the way, i was pleasantly surprised with their food!  It was actually very good.  At first they said it was a la carte, so i thought their entrees would be small but surpringly they were not.  Take our word coming from five grown men that by the end of dinner we were actually pretty full!

Our bartender was on top of everything the entire time (except for one thing that I'll get to at the end for emphasis) and our food came at a reasonable pace.

The reason i ate here was that one of my friends had their bachelor party dinner here.  i will have to give it props that, it was one of the cheaper venues to have a dinner party for 16 people.  other places i've called were roughly 150 a person, whereas TAO was going to charge us 95 bucks for a prefixed menu.

As for the prefixed menu, i believe we got:
lobster wonton
spicy thai dumpling soup
curry beef samosas
filet mignon pepper steak
red curry scallops
mixed vegetable tempura
pad thai noodles
chicken fried rice
symphony of sweets.

the best item on the prefixed menu was the spicy thai dumplings soup.  i don't know what made it so tasty, but it was very soothing to drink.  the symphony of sweets was also cool.  they brought out a lot of different types of dessert, so its sure to please everyone at the table.

Mediocre to acceptable food, high cost for small portions, slow service, and a poorly laid out restaurant design lacking anything visually appealing. Ok, the big Buddha was pretty cool, but that was about it. Between food, service, and atmosphere, would think they have got one of them right? All lacked substance.

It's usually fairly easy to get a last minute reservation via OpenTable and they easily accommodate big parties. I've found that a later reservation is the way to go - maybe 9:30 or 10:00PM. That way they'll come around and stamp you for the nightclub so you can walk right past the line after dinner and pay no cover. Definitely a perk for a Friday/Saturday. 

The food is good and has been consistent over the years. A sushi roll and appetizer is plenty for me before hitting the town. It's very easy to overeat here trying different items! The lobster dumplings are fantastic and so is the rock shrimp. Any sushi roll with mango and the sauce is a must try!

The first half of our group arrived and we were immediately seated in the lounge area until the second half arrived.  Upon their arrival we were immediately seated.  Our waitress was really sweet but she seemed new.  She took our drink orders...all adult beverages and water and then suggested we do the tasting menu...they like to offer that for larger parties.  I think primarily to make it easier on the kitchen...good luck with that with this group...let's just say #ADDisOurNativeLanguage we opted for individual entrees which was fine by me.  I was going to order the lobster kim chee fried rice but when I asked she said it wasn't her fav.  I asked which of the rice dishes was and she said the either of the duck fried rice dishes so I opted for the Thai duck fried rice and it was amazing!! #YummyYummyGetInMyTummy.

UPDATE: I found a stream-of-consciousness blog post I wrote about Tao, so I am pasting it here:

The food- oh, the food! We ate at Tao, the swanky upscale gorgeous GORGEOUS zen styled restaurant in the hotel, where our waiter looked like a cross between Bruce Lee and Richard Gere. Both Gene and I fell in love with him. We sat under a 30' high Buddha who perched on a koi pond, ate delectable food and exquisite drinks. I had a mango something martini, which accompanied the loverly 'Buddha's harmonized vegetables for the minor gods', among other sumptuous dishes. The place is so incredibly beautiful, in that insanely huge budget kind of way. The entry way is lined with bathtub looking pools, filled with rose petals and orchids, with floating candles in them. The walls are lined with Buddhist statues inset in thier own little cubbies, the rooms are divided by floor to 50' ceiling white sheers. Incredible. Not usually does the food match the decor, but in the name of all things holy, it was incredible. Each thing was more delicious than the next, and I don't know how they made the chocolate dessert thing we ate, but it was the most velvety, creamy incredible thing I might have ever eaten.",ljmj1Bt6gxM5aEOAwqq9UA,0,0,5,8FBGMTKqb45gI0df1BX1zA

The restaurant itself is beautiful and spacious. The entrance to the restaurant itself was very unique! Walking into the restaurant there were bath tubs full of naked women tastefully covered in flowers. No pictures were allowed but I tried unsuccessfully anyway. We sat in the bar area until out table was ready and had a drink. The bartenders were helpful and courteous but the bar was very full. 
Once we were seated for dinner we decided to share a meal of their lobster fried rice as well as the glazed salmon. Both dishes were absolutely delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly. However, we both thought the lobster fried rice was very salty and way too greasy. Their was literally a pool of grease in the bowl of rice which we were surprised they did not drain a little before serving it to us.
After having dinner in their restaurant we were informed that entrance into their club was complimentary for all diners. This was a big plus because it allowed us to avoid the $30.00 per person cover charge.
The club was very much like the restaurant - beautiful and full of both naked and costumed woman but this time they were all dancing instead of lounging like the ladies in the bathtubs at their restaurants entrance. Like at the restaurant bar the club bar served very good drinks. Snoop dogg was the entertainment for the night I was there. When the club let out the staff surprisingly handed out flip flops to all the women. But on the downside the flip flops were all the same size but this didn't stop any of the women from using the slippers LOL. My friend said they were a relief from her high heels. I simply took mine home as a souvenir. The take home slippers were definitely a unique touch.
The only negative that I could recall beside the one size fits all slippers was the greasy rice but the rest of my experience was wonderful. I'd definitely return when I'm in Vegas again.",u5cuZkrIqiZLUc6scFlrmA,0,0,4,ckV_3AL7ikcOVHIdASsIUQ

Asian Tao Nightclub is divided by two feature area, the Temple and The Emperor Ballroom.

As you all know, Las Vegas is a city never sleeps! 
You may say,  Vegas as a twin sister of NY City, in terms of their party hours time. 

In most clubs in this city, the 'happy time' is go on for twenty four seven! That's also reminds me of a city lifestyle, when I still live overseas, Asia. 

Asian Tao Bistro is located on the Grand Canal Shoppes level inside of the elegant Venetian hotel! 
Boasts an outside terrace with a strip views of Vegas!

I went and experience this 'hot spot' when I visit Las Vegas back in February 2006, that night, before and after I went to see and enjoy the Cirque du Soleil performance, Mystere!

We started with a few cocktails, which were good.  We ordered some starters, The Edamame sampler (was good and the garlic wasabe edamame was an interesting twist on a favorite), Hot and Sour Soup with Shrimp toast (my soup was pitch black, and the shrimp toast was burnt on the outside but mushy on the inside?), and Vegetable Dumplings (were overcooked, the skins were mushy).  

For entrees we ordered the Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken (which was basically like Sweet and Sour Chicken at most chinese fast food restaurants, but not fried), Eggplant, and Noodles.  After seeing the food I think the prices are absolutely ridiculous for what they provide.  The food is not flavorful in any way and I definently think that Tao needs to revamp their dishes (all of them were unimpressive)

At the end of our meal we did get a dessert which was a sampler of many of their desserts.  I have to say this was definently the highlight of a disappointing meal.  They had a sparkler on the dessert platter when they brought it out and the thing that caught my attention was the GIGANTIC fortune cookie (which has white chocolage mousse on one side and chocolate mouse on the other side).  They also had some sort of chocolate cake with a melted chocolate inside, and a fried dessert eggroll.

The four of us kept commenting on the Buddha floating over the koi pond, the wall of candles, and the giant portraits that were hanging near our tables.  Fortunately, our luck didn't just run out there.

We ordered two appetizers and four main course dishes and were pleasantly surprised with the quality and the quantity.  The scallops were amazingly tasty, and the peking duck rolls were beyond my expectations.  Our entrees were pad thai, a red curry chicken, a sea bass, and salmon over udon noodles.  All dishes were exceptionally prepared and the thai dishes were better than you'd find at most specialty thai restaurants.  Impressive.  Five stars would be awarded if our server had been more attentive and perhaps if the price were just a smidge lower.

One thing to keep in mind is that you should probably make reservations. We went here on a Monday night at 9:30 p.m. thinking we would get seated right away. Apparently not. The hostess looked at us like we were crazy when we said we didn't have reservations. The wait ended up being an hour but luckily we were staying at the Palazzo so we went back up to the room for some drinks to kill some time. 

We ordered the sea bass (amazing), the coconut shrimp and udon noodles. The shrimp was really crispy and the sauce on it was so good. The udon noodles were whatever. I don't really like udon noodles in general so i can't really give an honest opinion.

We tried their sake sampler but I realized that I'm not a sake fan. It's too strong. Their mixed drinks are pretty good though. 

Since we came here on a Monday, the club was closed. I'd imagine that when the club is open it could get pretty loud. There was music playing but I don't remember it being overbearing.

We made reservations for this? After I complained, we were then seated next to the DJ and across from noisy bar! It took all my willpower not to walk out because I've read some great reviews and was looking forward to our dining experience. Big mistake! 

The restaurant is huge with many levels of seating for dining and had a club atmosphere and not conducive to enjoying great Asian cuisine chatting with friends. This place definitely caters mostly to the nightclub set. And it was only 7:15pm and people at the bar were over the top! 

After waiting for about 40 minutes (unacceptable) we ordered our food. Since it was hard to have a normal conversation with my husband during dinner  we ate in silence and got out of there as soon as we could. This Foodie is not used to this kind of treatment! 

By the time the food arrived we were starving so we dug into the Peking Duck Spring Rolls with Hoison sauce which was very flavorful and we both enjoyed it. Thank goodness! However it was the only dish that was good out of the 3 dishes we ordered! The Crispy Coconut Shrimp with THAI Peanut Sauce ($33.00 for 6 medium shrimp) was pricey and I did like the flavor of the peanut sauce with the shrimp but my husband said to him they were just uninteresting. 

I did like the flavor of our 3rd dish Mandarin Fried Rice with roasted Pork however my husband said it reminded him of Panda Express at 5 times the cost!

That said, of COURSE it is obnoxious. This is Vegas baby, and this place is very popular.  So, you'll need a res for sure, and even then you will wait, and the waitron will treat you as though you are an enthused tourist who just can't wait for that exotic experience.

The octopus salad was a total miss with overly acidic dressing and almost no octopus.

Since they give us a variety of appetizers and sushi each time, I have some favorites.  The stuffed shrimp and the chicken skewers are delicious! We get those almost every time. The dumplings are also decent.  And the sushi is always fresh. I never had rubbery fish there. The unagi is also really good. My favorite dessert are the won tons and ice cream.  

Of course Tao is really trendy, loud and always crowded.  The restaurant is huge and most of the people are young and pretty.  Although most of the time you see a huge group of strippers.

We arrived on time for our 8:00 p.m. reservation and were seated relatively quickly. The ambiance is very chic and trendy and the noise level actually wasn't as loud as I was expecting. Since there were six of us, we decided to order a variety of items from the menu like the Kung Pao Chicken, Shrimp Tempura Rolls, Crunchy Spicy Yellowtail Roll, Coconut Shrimp, and Spicy Smoked Salmon Roll to name a few.

Once the food began to arrive, we all started indulging in the sushi dishes. As I took my first bite of the Shrimp Tempura Roll (which was delicious by the way), I felt something hot dripping down my back... it was the Coconut Shrimp!!! YES, THE COCONUT SHRIMP! One of the people bringing the food to our table (not our waiter) had accidentally spilled the dish on my brand new WHITE blazer. Now, I understand that accidents happen. What bothers me is that the only apology I heard, was from our waiter (Edmond?) who had NOTHING to do with the incident. Even the manager did not apologize right away. He said he'd be back to check in on me... he did NOT check in on me during the remainder of the meal. 

Once the six of us finished our meal, a complimentary platter filled with an assortment of desserts was delivered to our table (giant fortune cookie, ice cream, molten chocolate cake, chocolate Buddha)... as an apology I'd imagine since the only one I received by that point was from our waiter. Then (hallelujah!), the manager reappeared. He brought me a dry cleaning slip (which was useless considering I was leaving the next morning). He offered to reimburse me for the dry cleaning costs and if for some reason the dry cleaner could not remove the stains, they'd replace my white blazer for me. Then, once we received the bill, I FINALLY heard him apologize for the incident.

We were not comped for even a portion of the meal or offered a discount even though we asked. The waiter actually laughed when we asked which I felt was very unprofessional. We paid and left... never to return again! The food was pretty good but not worth the inconvenience and terribly unprofessional service from the management to the servers. Though Tao Asian Bistro had been recommended to us, we will not be recommending this place nor dining here in the future. I'll stick to Katsuya!

The sea bass was very fresh, tender, a bit fishy though so if you don't like the fish taste, I wouldn't recommend it. And last but not least, the filet mignon was nicely peppered, grilled, and complimented the udon noodles well. All the other stuff we ordered like pad thai, kung pao chicken, or the lobster wonton didn't excite my taste buds. The kung pao chicken had more vegetables then it did chicken. Boo. The pad thai was dry and not enough sauce, also I found it odd to serve a Thai dish at a Chinese fusion restaurant. The lobster wonton were mediocre.
