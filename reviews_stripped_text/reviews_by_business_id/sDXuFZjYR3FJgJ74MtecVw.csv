It could be the lack of good Taiwanese food in Chicago talking but the food here is great in my book!

Oyster patty,  stinky tofu, oyster and intestine noodles, and shaved ice...  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  

I know some of the items I listed may not sound too appetizing,  but if you know Taiwanese food, you know where I am coming from.

I'm about as Asian as a white guy can get.  I speak a little Korean, cook a lot of Thai foods, and used to teach Tae Kwon Do.

I love to experience new cultures, and I try not to close myself off to new experiences.  Stinky Tofu was on my list of new experiences.  

Ay-Chung is clean, inviting, and warm, much like the staff you'll meet here.  

I started with a Mint Milk Tea...Mmmm mmm!  This hit the spot.  I love milk teas, and mint this one was just perfect.  

I then moved on to the reason I stopped in:  The Stinky Tofu!!

As the dish was put down on my table, it became immediately obvious why they call it ""stinky.""  The smell was just as pungent and formidable as everyone says.  I won't describe it here, because I don't aim to insult anyone.  I will just say that when you let things ferment, many times the scent is the first thing you will notice. 

It looked much like agedashi, or flash fried tofu.  I took a deep breath, and summed up as much courage as I could.  I took a bite, and chewed it thoroughly as to experience all the flavors.  To my surprise, the flavor was a bit more mild than the smell, but I couldn't take another bite.  I had a really difficult time getting past the smell; perhaps as a westerner who never experienced this type of food, it was just too much.  

I will be back for more delicious milk tea, and to sample some other foods.

Do yourself a favor, get off the couch and out of your comfort zone.  One day you will be a drooling fool with 2 taste buds and even less teeth; its time to LIVE!!  Come live at Ay-Chung.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,0,1,3,uNMBwn6v77upQW9C3jcrOQ

A bowl there costs about $15 bucks. i read about Ay Chung so I decided to try it. i was not disappointed. the bowl was super huge. the noodles were delicious. it was full of yummy bok choy,and yummy good beef. not too much tendon either. some places dont put enough beef in their noodle soup. The price was very low too. so i am very happy i came to this place. too bad i live in Phoenix. Everytime i come to las vegas i will be sure to come here.

1149405,2010-02-16,0,sDXuFZjYR3FJgJ74MtecVw,"This is the 2nd Ay-Chung I've been to in the US, and of course nothing can compare to the original in Taipei.  There's also an Ay-Chung in LA, located in Focus Plaza in San Gabriel. I never liked it that much since once you've had Ay-Chung in Taiwan and you can't really compare them.  San Gabriel location's quality just isn't there so I was crossing my fingers when I came here.

We got a bowl of Ay-Chung noodles: It was surprisingly good!  Way much better than the location in San Gabriel. The broth/soup base is much more flavorful.

Also got the popcorn chicken :]  When a place fries the chicken with basil, you know it can't be bad.  We also got the oyster pankcake as a side.  It's not bad but they do use a lot of cornstarch.  A lot of places use a lot of cornstarch as a filler.  The pink/red sauce isn't bad though.  

Also got the Stinky tofu. Wow they actually have the big pieces here. Most place in the states serve these small bite size stinky tofu and they're just not as good. I was surprised when they had the bigger ones. It's just much more enjoyable than eating the tiny cubes of stinky tofu.

Of course you can't eat Taiwanese food without getting a milktea or some sort of drink.  The drinks here aren't bad at all.  I would come here any day rather than paying 4-6 bucks for a large down the street at Tea Station.

They got a lot of the typical Taiwanese fare you expect.  For the limited selections of  Taiwanese food around the area, Ay Chung is not a bad option if you are craving some Taiwanese food in Vegas!",LyrAjv8V6HWkceuTB4Xtkw,0,0,4,COI1BmB7iV70Bq8hkBZcIg

The only reason why I like to come here is for the Stinky Tofu, one of my most favorite things. Its stinky, but once you dip it in the garlic soy sauce thing, it is delicious! However, my mom made the choice to order the tiny cubed ones which were not as stinky. Therefore, to me it tasted like a plain fried tofu. Food was eh. The Crispy chicken was a tad salty for me which need rice to neutralize the flavor. The portions for the rice combo plates are very generous. Service was snappy. I wasn't a fan of their ""famous"" noodle, but more so of what they offered was what I liked.

Overall I give them a 3.5 out of 5. For offering Cho Tofu (stinky Tofu) and for being snappy and quick. Atmosphere, felt a tad cramped but otherwise it was decent. Come check it out if your a fan of stinky tofu, for me which is a hard to find delicacy in the Bay! jk.",i5IzRJLwLU9GfZYCFJEbTA,0,0,3,jpXWNWNCBCmbSp35I3nqgg

One downside to this is that they don't have many power outlets. I guess its a first come, first serve kind of deal. they do have free wireless internet at decent speeds for use. no password. 

First time i heard about this place was not this specific location, it was the original location in taipei, taiwan on my trip in 2006 at a night market. It specialized in their chittering thin noodle bowl. 

Aside from that, this place is good. Service is great. The employees are really nice. Prices are pretty average for a chinese, or should i say, taiwanese restaurant. They have various appetizers like fried chicken (not KFC kind... small battered boneless chicken pieces fried) to even stinky tofu (not exactly the same as ones some people may have tried in Taiwan or Hong Kong but its still love-hate relationship here. personally, i still dont like the smell of it but alot of people love to eat it. 

One of my favorite things to order is the beef noodle soup and the rice plates. Good amount of food for the price. Decently seasoned. 

they have a wide variety of drinks ranging from teas (milk teas, jasmine teas, etc) to milks (strawberry milk, papaya milk, etc)  to ices (green tea?, red bean? some chocolate one??) with the option of boba, pudding, etc... also have shaved ice that you can pick your own ingredients.

The restaurant is clean and spacious, has free wi fi, two flat screen tvs, and a comfortable vibe. The staff is very nice, doesn't rush you and push suggestions on you. If you're like me and needed to finish your taxes or work they give you all the space and time you need without making you feel like you've overstayed your welcome.

Of course, the food is good also. They're known for their stinky tofu, which I didn't order but smelled authentic. I ordered a milk tea with boba which was perfect. I also tried their Fu Chou fishball soup which was delicious and unique. To finish, two of us shared the shaved ice plate which was plenty for two.

I'd give this place 4.5 stars but since there's no such thing I'm rounding up.

My bf got the Crispy Pork Chop Rice, that was not good at all. It was overcooked, over fried, super hard and dry. The dish was not appetizing or good at all. Crispy is not break your teeth hard.

1546834,2008-10-11,0,sDXuFZjYR3FJgJ74MtecVw,"I sought this place out because I simply HAD to try stinky tofu.  It's the biologist in me.  Okay, and the foodie.  That, and I needed an Asian supermarket fix, and this place is in the same center as SF Market.  The waitress was kind of surprised that a very Anglo (red hair, blue eyes, anemic complexion) woman like me was brave enough to even try stinky tofu, but she humored me.  Maybe it was the goofy grin I get when I think I'm trying something new and unusual.  I was the only Anglo in the place.

I also ordered a cup of hot tea (it was chilly today in Vegas) and a bowl of fish stewed noodle soup.  The hot tea was served in a styrofoam cup, but it was lovely, fragrant tea, which made up for the non-presentation.  It took quite a while for my order to come, but maybe that was because I counted three other tables of 8 and half a dozen other tables with 2 to 4 guests each.  In any case, I wasn't in any hurry, and just watched the food and the people as well as the football game on the big screen TV overhead.

The stinky tofu wasn't all that stinky--I'd ordered it ""regular"" since I've never had it before.  I also thought that it was kind of bland.  There seemed to be a slight sharp Durian-like odor, but there wasn't much flavor of any sort.  The cabbage salad, with a very sharp vinegar dressing, was great.  Come to think of it, I don't know if I can really judge how stinky tofu tastes, because as usual, I spied a nice piece of pepper in the cabbage salad, underestimated the heat, and happily chewed away.  I didn't taste much of anything for a while.

The fish stewed noodle soup was excellent, with some kind of root vegetable (white, but it wasn't potato) and bean sprouts as well as noodles and fried fish.  It was filling and tasty.

I don't think I'd try the stinky tofu again, but there are lots of other really interesting offerings on the menu, and I plan to return to try them.  They also have a large selection of beverages, including boba, shave ice, fresh juices, jelly, milk tea, fruit teas and slushes.",V33eN85b4PvAsPIQRaaecg,1,0,4,Bt6aijIW1Bthw-oVHkHLMg

2196249,2007-12-13,3,sDXuFZjYR3FJgJ74MtecVw,"alright, so this place is one of the only taiwanese joints here in vegas.
i believe there's one other place.
i can safely say that we eat here more for that reason than any other.
being taiwanese, i need my fix every once and awhile, ya know what i'm sayin.
however, if it was really terrible, i think we'd pass it up no matter what.

that said, here's what i think about the place.
the beef noodle soup is quite good as far as i'm concerned.
the broth is fresh and just spicy enuf.
yum!
however the beef is a bit tough.
the noodles are very plentiful.
the pork noodle soup is delish.
the pork chops are good but better on certain days.
the popcorn chicken is alright, not crunchy enuf for me.
the sizzling steak or chicken served with noodles, an egg and your choice of sauce, black pepper or sweet tomato, is very tasty and well worth the whoppin $8.95.
but be sure to ask for the sauce on the side cuz otherwise you get soggy noodles.
the ba bao fan (i don't know how to say it in english) is pretty good.
the rice in bamboo something or other is also very good.
i think it's the sauce that does it for us.
the rest of it is just a vehicle to get the sauce into your mouth.
ha!
their drinks are typically taiwanese, not much fresh fruit, mostly powder and flavoring.
the boba is a bit overcooked.

as for the service, the girls are all very sincere and friendly.
they're not very prompt and don't have their attention on the dining floor as much as they should but the place is still fairly new, surely working out some kinks.
one thing that i'd love to suggest to them is that they need to divide their staff up a bit more evenly.
each time we go, there's always 3 girls behind the counter making drinks and only 1 girl taking orders and expediting food delivery.
there really only needs to be one drink maker.

all in all, we'll definitely continue to eat here.
the food is satisfying and the prices are decent.

so, that's my .02.

UPDATE:  we've eaten here a million times since i posted this review and it seems that i've made it my comfort food joint of choice.  we always get the beef soup with clear noodles now and the minced pork with rice.  both delicious!  i've had the stinky tofu but i'm not a fan of stinky tofu so....enh.  now they serve the popcorn chicken spicy so i'm liking that a lot more.  still, can't wait to eat at the one in taiwan.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,4,3,4,59jp-a0xn1HkcPD7Rv1Psw

I mean of course it cant be compared to the ones in Taiwan or Cali but that's as close as its gonna get in Vegas. I also order the fried squid, fried chicken or pork chop rice when I go there. Even though the price has gone up but still more reasonable compare to tea planet.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,0,0,3,4Fs57PFRdu2Z5nlYJQKycA

I like their beef noodle here. Nice strong beefy spicy broth. BF doesnt like this as the beef has a bit of ""connective"" stuff, but I love all that gelatinous mess. It's part of the appeal of beef noodle soups is the tendon-y pieces. Yum actually. 

Got some rice plates and they're pretty good but nothing too standout except the crispy pork chop though had a nice crunch and flavor.

Honey Kalbi ribs was alright with me, BF thought it was a little too chewy for him. Popcorn chicken with basil is yum.

Their milk teas are good and a lot cheaper than tea station. Almond and honeydew is usually what I order. Mmm. And they have shaved ice for the BF who loves it with all those beans and condensed milk. It's a big serving too...we cant finish it together even.

Been trying to brave stinky tofu. I've had it mild with some pickles on it and a spicy sauce and it was yum, but also had it where it's so pungent I gagged and I love stinky cheese/fermented flavors. I'll probably stop in just for this one of these days.

I've had better in LA, but this is not bad at all. Glad it is here and the prices are fair and usually a decent standard of food and service.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,1,1,4,GMi5l4UvWJ0RKJkPXa9CZA

It wasn't as stinky as I had hoped but you def got a lot of it for $4 or so.  We also ordered the beef noodle soup, squid stew with noodles and the shrimp pancake.  All were pretty decent.  The boba teas were pretty good too..tons of boba, not much ice.  I like that its open til 2:30am too.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,4,3,4,NYxY3IKIkdecfjy-6OZGlQ

I first stumbled upon this place after almost a year of living in the Las Vegas area, as I didn't know anything past the Ranch 99 plaza on Spring Mountain. I was seriously surprised that there were so many restaurants on that street that I never heard or saw before. I had to check it out with Theresa B.

So far I've only had their green milk tea, which tasted like good ol Taiwanese style milk tea that I love from San Bruno and was decently priced. 

Can't say I'm a fan yet, as I haven't had their food items....so I'm giving them 3 stars for now...",Tk_FWXueutKii3f9yJFsdw,1,0,3,uCG7eQblSzWfUd-eoOnqoA

I mostly get the slushes with boba. Red bean w/ coconut, coconut & mocha slush are the ones I tend to get. I tried just plain red bean slush recently, but don't think I'll get it again. I do like red bean overall though.

I've only tried the shaved ice once here, but I don't really remember much.  I like getting my shaved ice in California.

The food here is ehh.. I don't ever order food here (unless I'm really hungry and don't want to go anywhere else, assuming I was already here to get boba and then suddenly got hungry). I can't really eat the food here -- it just doesn't fit my tastes and its quality isn't that superb. The stinky tofu smell gets to me x___x.

A lot of my friends know the staff here so it's pretty cool. Aside from the food, I like the place.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,1,1,4,0Pa5ijSmk51ssrYhje18_w

5918674,2011-03-16,1,sDXuFZjYR3FJgJ74MtecVw,"Been to this Taiwanese restaurant that is famous in Taiwan for the Ay-Chung House Special Thin Noodle with Chittering (E1).  I don't think it is as good as the one I originally tried back in Taiwan, but it was pretty close.

But they also serve Taiwanese entrees like Pork Chop or Fried Chicken over Rice, Beef Noodle Soup, etc, which are all popular menu items in Taiwan.  I have to say that their Beef Noodle Soup has excellent flavor, and I prefer it being served with the wide noodles. The beef is pretty tender, but could be cooked longer so it will be more tender.

They also have a good selection of boba tea items.  I usually just order it without the boba (personal preference).

And for those looking for a free Wi-Fi hot spot, Ay-Chung definitely provides it.

Decor: 4/5 Modern look, relatively comfortable chairs.
Food: 4/5 I like it, and the service is fast.
Service: 4/5  They pretty much leave you alone after taking your order and bringing out your order.  So if you want to eat or surf the web in peace, this will be a good place to go.
Price: 4/5  Not really a bargain for what you get, but will not break any wallets either.

Overall, a solid 4/5.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,2,2,4,rkuyyZMfm0dGGFbPwmXQuQ

I happened to order the fried fish with rice dish which came with preserved vegetables, rice, fish, a hard boiled egg and napa cabbage. Simple dish but delicious!

I can say this is a pretty good spot for Taiwanese food and is pretty cheap.",CVlGVvlR436OH8Q1pHfz-Q,14,9,4,CxvtUSPMFC88oANOXfVSog
