Would have given 5 stars if the shop looked less ghetto.  I'm not sure if the shop looked any better, they would make pizzas better than what they already have.  

QUALITY
Joey's pizza tastes good. If you are used to having a pizza from one of those popular chains (Dominos, Pizza Hut) regularly, treat yourself with a good tasting pizza from here.

OPTIONS
I got a 14"" large pizza with 5 (yes five!!) toppings for just 14.99.  Went with all veggie toppings. Next time I will swap those jalapeno topping for extra olives or mushrooms.  But nevertheless Pizza still tasted good.

VALUE
What you get is definitely more than what you pay for. What was supposed to be a pizza dinner for two of us, easily made for left over breakfast for next day morning (having all veggie toppings helped for having it as breakfast).

Would definitely go back next time I crave Pizza.",S8NFZzgKBnjyrdWvvKHmmQ,2,0,4,GphZgpMqHAwJ7ZCJEAF7Vw

It is located on the Southeast side of the intersection of Nellis and Desert Inn. I never had the pizza I order delivered, just as carry out. Right now they have a good special going for carry out, 1 large 1 topping for $6.50+tax! 

I've been keeping it simple with deals and such from this place. All I had so far are 1 topping pizzas and Cajun flavored wings. What I like about the pizza best is the crust. It's crunchy, not too doughy, and has a very good taste to it. The toppings are also of good quality and they don't skimp you on the pizza. The wings were also done well. 

I'm not 100% sure, but I'm think all they do is carry out and delivery. I would recommend the place to anyone if you have a pizza craving!",f5gw3C3jHrytKt69RB9eDA,1,0,4,8iIOYKr2SDagbCrRDuqdgg

2548901,2014-06-24,0,A6rPIkIzxIeriuI4FFwxnw,"I hate to be a Negative Nancy but after all the positive reviews, I can't keep my opinion to myself.  I wouldn't even call this pizza ""good"".   I originally planned on using Domino's for my daughter's birthday party, but they've gone too far downhill.  We ordered from Joey's instead -- 4 pies and an order of garlic balls.

The crust was tough, not at all crispy, and somewhat hard to bite into.  I've had worse, but I do expect some kind of crispness.  On the good side, it didn't have that burnt flavor like so many of the other pizza shops in town.

Sauce had a good taste - somewhat sweet and not overloaded with spices.

The sausage was foul.  It was spoiled or freezerburnt or something along those lines.  All other toppings were tasty on their own, but there weren't a lot of them on the pizza.  Our bacon pizza had about 2 pieces of bacon per slice.  On the pizza with three different toppings, you couldn't get all three of those toppings in one bite.  It kinda defeats the purpose of getting a pizza with multiple toppings on it. 
 
Cheese was minimal.

We ordered the garlic balls thinking they would be similar to garlic knots.  They aren't anything like knots.  They tasted like pizza rolls but without the filling.  Not too bad, but they don't come with sauce, and they turned rubbery before the meal was over.  If there was a sauce, and if they didn't turn rubbery, they would've been a nice unique treat.  Kinda like fancy popcorn.  

I had my spouse order and pick up the food.  He was charged 20% more than the menu prices (afternoon, carryout).  Tax is only 8.x%.  He wasn't given an itemized receipt so I don't know why there was such a price difference.

I'm perfectly capable of making pizza or reheating one from the store.  The reason we order from a pizza place is to get pizza that tastes different (better) from the at-home options.  When the pizza doesn't taste better than at-home, it feels like a total waste.  All in all, I could've made a better pizza with a store brand Boboli crust.  Even the $1.25 frozen party pizzas would've tasted a lot better.

I should've known better than to try something new (for us) for a birthday party.",elektz6cHmiFgfXmid-xiA,4,1,2,QDcKSLIFelDDQrke5gotvg

This bad boy is bigger than my forearm. I highly recommend the Classic. Filled to exploding with pepperoni, ham, mozzarella AND cheddar...and sauce! If you love stromboli, this does not disappoint. If this were featured in ""The Godfather"" instead of canolli, there would have been a gunfight over this baby!",LsKp4SlhrVw3ZHs11c1deA,0,0,4,OjvV-2-n7Q7H4m3maO2Nhw

The taste was so fresh and had a homemade taste to it. I love joeys and would recommend it to all the pizza lovers in las vegas nv,T4M4C5y3NKrIOpDoVHPoFw,0,0,4,xWuuMjRpXllbLKsR1NfPDw
5190626,2018-05-27,0,A6rPIkIzxIeriuI4FFwxnw,"Apparently the folks at Joey's Pizza can not read the signs displayed around the Stallion Mountain community that clearly state that solicitation is not allowed.  Furthermore shoving your menu through our front door setting off our canine alarm system was very unappreciated (although it was good proof of its effectiveness).  

Your menu went immediately into the trash and now we will never patronize your establishment no matter how good your pizza appears to be.",L4pC7c5zWGMhk06uXY_75g,0,0,1,hLWC7Fo3esx8Py-Yj3F-Yw

I like the burgers better at Angelina's much better.  Actually I feel they have one of the best burgers on the East Side of town.  But, I digress as this is a review of Joey's.  The pizza here is still my favorite though.  And, they have a yelp check in deal which saves you 10% on your bill.  So, that is a bonus.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,1,0,4,EX5xMuDS30i0NWjlm9tqfQ

5549894,2010-06-26,0,A6rPIkIzxIeriuI4FFwxnw,"When I bought my mass amount of restaurant.com certificates when I first moved here, I didn't really pay attention to location.  So I sent my husband out to get pizza here for us and use a certificate, and he yelled at me later because it was so far.  

The pizza was pretty good.  I had a vegetarian with anchovies, thin crust.  It was good but nothing special, really.  What was better was my husband's thick crust pepperoni.  Very very good crust, but bad for me because I should be limiting my carbs.  We needed to make a $45 minimum so we got some hot wings too.  Flavor wise, they were good but lacked the crunchiness I love in a good hot wing. 

Husband said when he got to the restaurant there was literally one guy there doing everything (cooking, taking orders, etc) and he tipped him quite a bit.  With our certificate we only paid 20 bucks for our two large pizzas and an order of wings, which was a pretty good deal.

Would we go out of our way to go here?  Probably not.  But if I lived near here I'd definitely be ordering delivery.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,1,0,4,7M-dNMOq29yDXEvHrjRGVw

Figured I'd be safe with a white pizza but nope, oily as hell and the mozzarella sticks were barely  cooked the sauce was refrigerator cold. I will never attempt to eat here again and will steer everyone I  know away. If this is what vegas has to offer for pizza ill wait til my next city to order more!

Yesterday I called in a order and had the person(I believe it's the owners spouse) tried to over charge me by 6.00. when I complained she had the nerve to get angry with me and hung up the phone. I politely called back and let her know that I would never come in her establishment ever again.",kBORH5w8xo5o9OM9wl7ByQ,3,0,1,mUXa4Q6lxHWHGStGEBFc1w
