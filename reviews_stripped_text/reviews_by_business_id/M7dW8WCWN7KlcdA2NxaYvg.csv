404356,2016-01-12,0,M7dW8WCWN7KlcdA2NxaYvg,Seems like a few of these locations do not have the spinach bagel as they're sold out pretty quickly. I wonder why they don't make extra in those types of bagels? Maybe they're too understaffed to notice. It's tough to go to these stores to see just 2 workers trying to run the operations of the entire store. It's really hard on them and the customers have to get bad service because of it. I don't blame the workers but management need to pay attention to this. I really love the bagels here but the bad service is a lot to deal with.,otT4DB_lg7WdhkFVnxsbvg,0,0,3,wNI3Ez2TlMBC54cSQiwH1g
863667,2016-03-15,0,M7dW8WCWN7KlcdA2NxaYvg,"The restaurant closes at 4:00pm so I went in at 3:35 to get a hummus veg out. Apparently they close up before they close because all they had were bagels and cream cheese. No veggies, meat or cheese available because they already put it away. This was upsetting because if you're not closed then you're open for business unless advertised otherwise.",z92jqGbEEtmW5pTRauSzog,3,0,1,BuDkyID-whtnLE6szOAKEw
890158,2015-01-10,0,M7dW8WCWN7KlcdA2NxaYvg,"After sitting around the office contemplating something different for lunch, we decided to make a run for bagel dogs. Sounded good, you know not the average sandwich. So it was off to Einstein's for a confirmed 6 dogs, with a couple of maybes, so a total of 8. Since they advertise these products on the internet you would think they would stock them. You know kind of like going to a car dealership for a car. 

Upon arrival I was greeted by a grumpy server who loved to talk to you with their back turned to you. And then she just snapped that they didn't have any, like in none.Then wanted to wait on the next person in line not allowing me to get in any other request i may have or if they could possibly look in back. They need to fire everyone there and start all over again. I know that I will certainly be taking my money and business elsewhere.",ZzvTSO2mD07orsFS035hTA,1,0,1,ieNdkor8Zcy7gIJP-s5Naw
891084,2016-09-07,0,M7dW8WCWN7KlcdA2NxaYvg,"As a student on campus who is an avid fan of breakfast and coffee, this place is my go to. I love getting the turkey sausage and cheddar breakfast sandwich as its nice and hearty while being reasonably low in calories and fat. I enjoy this place even though the line can get busy at times it is still pretty quick do to the very speedy service of the team members. I would recommend this place for breakfast only as their lunch options are less than desirable and are very poor quality. The price is reasonable at best (especially if you invest in a coffee cup like me, or even a punch card), but $7 gets me a nice breakfast sandwich and a cup of medium coffee, not the worst price but defiantly could spend my money somewhere else. 

All in all; I would go here for breakfast, not anything else.

oh, they are also closed on weekends which suck",aVLQmMVoHtCLlX8Z9NoZkQ,0,0,3,JVMyjWwsLVkxl4kOHN6fMg
1397698,2017-11-14,0,M7dW8WCWN7KlcdA2NxaYvg,Just bought the worse cappuccino. The coffee was burnt.. So disappointing. I had to throw away the entire large cappuccino because it was inedible.,bFc9TIM5BCtLEbbUJ7ysmw,0,0,1,i8rWvvRF8cZ5hTDf9HrvJw
1408498,2016-06-19,0,M7dW8WCWN7KlcdA2NxaYvg,"I got the bagel with lox and a schmear which I thought was pretty good. It wasn't too spectacular given that it's a restaurant chain so I had no real qualms with it. Pretty light on the capers, and there wasn't the tomato as I've seen in NY deli's. 

Granted, it's a NY deli and not a Einstein Bagel franchise so there are going to be some drastic differences. Overall, it did the job.",wj_DODQ43_J8NPwQJ1qkVg,0,0,3,A42MUB8n03ehkPBa8KnrzA
3721063,2016-03-07,0,M7dW8WCWN7KlcdA2NxaYvg,"I have been here 3 times in the past few months, each time regretting it. The last time I went the service was slow and they messed up my order. The person making the bagels made a big deal about it, as if it was my fault. They said I would have do with out the veggie that came on the bagel because they used the last veggies they had on the bagel they messed up. Today when I went, I spent 30 minutes there and left with nothing. I asked if I could order the herbivore sub cream cheese for hummus (I've ordered this before). The cashier asked the lady making the sandwiches and she rudely replied ""What do you think?"". The cashier told me I couldn't do that. I asked how much it'd cost to buy a bagel with hummus add veggies. It would've cost be almost 2$ extra to add a tomato and cucumbers! I opted for a bagel with hummus and after waiting 15 minutes was told they didnt have hummus. I asked for a refund. They refused to give me a refund asking if i wanted cream cheese. I told them I was allergic to dairy and they offered me cream cheese again. I asked for  refund and the lady making the sandwiches said her manager wasn't there and she didnt have time to give me her information. I had to get back in line and ask the cashier for the manager's phone number. RIDICULOUS! I will make sure not to recommend this location to any of my students or colleagues.",bNTz0l445mP28x8vSe0O3w,0,1,1,f7kcThqTl8psItysys5QIw
4098755,2018-01-08,0,M7dW8WCWN7KlcdA2NxaYvg,I came into this coffee shop to grab an afternoon coffee. While I was waiting in line I asked Alexis who was working the register  for the restroom key and she ignored me. It also was not busy there was one indecisive customer in front of me and I could not wait for the restroom. When I asked again she said that the bathroom was for customers only. Assuming that I wasn't going to purchase anything. She then wouldn't give me the key and walked me over and I explained that I did not want to wait in line when I needed to use the restroom: she just didn't say anything. When I ordered my coffee she didn't say thank you nor was she polite.,2m-HvhfIqZSAkWnxjuimNw,0,0,1,AiVtUJRycatUrkTkVRa8NQ
4298403,2016-04-28,0,M7dW8WCWN7KlcdA2NxaYvg,At this location to them toasted actually means warmed up. Even if you ask them to toast it so it shows its toasted they won't do it. Just go to Starbucks or somewhere else where they know how to toast a bagel. It's kinda sad since that is all they do is bagels and they can't even do it right.,K2yyYmSjR4HX7txSoz8sPQ,3,2,1,NsNNZZM4LY9DOB2RAy3iIw
5143046,2015-04-21,0,M7dW8WCWN7KlcdA2NxaYvg,"When the guys are making the food, I'd give this place 4stars (If the garbage was consistently clean I'd give them 5)  When the heavier manager lady is making the food, I'd give it 1 star.   I usually order the same thing:  Veg Out in a wrap, add avocado.   The guy is great. The lady though,  too much cream cheese, no tomato, and more wrap than anything else. Lettuce is NOT that expensive, spare an extra leaf will you?  What's the point of paying $7/$8 for a healthy wrap when there are no vegetables in it?  I'll do the $5 super stuffed chicken wrap or the $6 salad WITH vegetables next time she's making the food.     I had a nova lux when she was here before too and she completely cheapest out on ingredients.  If I want Nova lux I drive to the Einstein's off Tropicana before coming to school now.",JQlzHruOqwMuueStY_9_DA,0,0,2,72ih5a_9T31x1GvAUdONVQ

5983692,2013-02-23,1,M7dW8WCWN7KlcdA2NxaYvg,"It's an Einstein's and it's at school.  The food is OK.  The coffee is OK.  I basically come here because it's on campus and it's convenient.  I usually end up with a bagel thin sandwich and a signature coffee, and my bill ends up around $10.  

The bagel sandwiches are hit or miss.  Sometimes they are well put-together and taste good.  Other times my sandwiches are sloppy and lack flavor.  The service could use some refinement.  But like I said, it's at school and it's convenient.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,1,0,3,OFEWQWlogVEHZ8HQ2VqYZA
