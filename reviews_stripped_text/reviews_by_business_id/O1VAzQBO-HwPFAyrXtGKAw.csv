Def would recommend checking this place out if you are in the area! We will be back next time we're in town!,8dY8Ehrvmd1S1vK3littAg,1,1,5,L9mmfFpe9P2uMSt8J3leKQ

Got ignored for 5 min and that's me giving them credit... they have no business ever and the woman who helped us dropped the coal on the floor and still put it back on the hookah we asked for... it was harsh and we left after 30 min because we just couldn't be there anymore... we even had to ask twice for water whenever she passed by and when we tried to pay ((which we should have just walked out)) we got ignored again... best thing there was the restroom and only because it was always available... smh... I don't review places ever but this place was the exception...,zznioU9fpJ9BEG6hXnmhIA,0,0,1,toGzOR8YbJWc3V_Nxv1WqA
