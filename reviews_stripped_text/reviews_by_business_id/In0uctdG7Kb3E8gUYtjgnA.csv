389426,2017-08-22,0,In0uctdG7Kb3E8gUYtjgnA,"Went to this location twice. Nice waitress,very friendly.  On the good side: The Fish & Chips and Fish Tacos were awesome! My omelet was good as was the bacon. The Baby Bear Breakfast - the pancakes were tough and the rest was really greasy. I ordered an omelet with a side of hash browns, bacon and toast. There was not one hint of toast on my toast and the hash browns were really greasy. I also saw that it is calling itself a Badger Bar and advertises special bloody marys. I ordered one and it was...anemic. If you want to be a Badger bar, you better up your game on the Bloody Mary's - us Wisconsinites are used to a higher standard than a watered down, funky tasting mary with just celery stalk and olives for garnish. Please, do some research on how it's done in Wisconsin. I can't wait to try another one at a later date.",2BkM5Qf60bbzLlSCiQ8Oqw,0,0,3,7G7vvx2DRwHZkeKiDCa-wA

Cons: Funky smell

2258828,2018-06-26,0,In0uctdG7Kb3E8gUYtjgnA,"First visit was today for lunch, and I will certainly be back! I ordered the beef dip, sans all the bonus ingredients (you don't become the ingredient minimalist by eating bonus ingredients like onions, cheese, or horseradish!)

I actually tried the horseradish on the side today at the urging of a coworker...wasn't my cup of tea, score another point for me against all the ""how do you know you don't like it if you haven't tried it?"" propaganda I've heard over the years. I just know, people, call it a 6th sense!

The beef dip came out perfectly plain, with the accompanying pickle and little cup of plants which I swiftly moved away from my to-be-consumed foods. The homemade kettle chips are deliciously authentic and fresh and potatoey, ie not hidden behind 9 lbs of salt. 

Personal tip: 50/50 au jus and tabasco makes for a perfectly heated dipping experience!

Mikaela was knowledgable and attentive, and she helped me figure out what my next order will be, and now that I know I can grab a quick workday lunch here and be back to the office inside of an hour, I am sure that return will come sooner than later...thank you Timbers!",5Lt--iKYG2kFH_WPs9PJMQ,0,0,5,Af2OsBbehJcDDziTOtJ8rg

3779723,2018-02-28,0,In0uctdG7Kb3E8gUYtjgnA,"Steer clear friends, especially if you're in to gaming. Newly remodeled bar that looked nice with friendly and efficient staff. Good tap selection and all the liquor that is readily available at all bars in Las Vegas. They hit the standard so nothing new or surprising that will blow your mind. I slipped in a $20 to play video black jack. Bet $1 per hand. Lost my $20 with very few hands and thought to myself ""huh, that was unusually quick."" Out of curiosity I slipped in another $20 (I have a money tree I plucked recently in my back yard FYI) in to the machine and experienced the same thing. Substantially worse than any other gaming bar I've visited. It seemed that my two options were to stand with a terrible hand or bust. Rarely did I win any of my money back on any hands. It seemed that if I was dealt 18 the dealer would end up with 19. If I drew 19 the dealer would end up with 20. If I got dealt 20, dealer ends up with 21. So I took pictures of a 10 card sequence. Unbelievably, 6 out of 10 draws the dealer was able to hit 21 either with black jack or draw. I get that the house has odds and winning 6 out of 10 happens from time to time. Winning 6 out of 10 hands with 21 is ridiculous. Later Timbers.",_aGsoMLa4BNf3PnAHANU-A,2,0,2,8h905-1JouK3Ge-v2XTCkg

I must say, the service has definitely improved my last few visits, before it was very hit and miss. Jason has been great and has given us a reason to make this our regular bar!

Our server was Dominique and she was very friendly, very polite and very professional. The food was excellent. Had the Bacon cheese burger and it was cooked the way i wanted it. The rest of my party that was eating had no complaints either. The Manager on Duty, Trevor came to the table several times checking on us. Over all its a great place to eat, have a drink and watch tv, visit with friends and family. 5 star all the way

4699946,2017-10-02,5,In0uctdG7Kb3E8gUYtjgnA,"This Timber's on Sunset is very accomadating and one of the better Timber's chain. I called earlier to see if they would play a certain NFL game and they said they could. Arrived, but barely missed it because the sign on the street on Sunset was a little sun worn. Jaime, the bartender, greeted us enthusiastically and have us some menus. Though she was not the girl I talked to on the phone, she was just as  friendly and turned to the football game we came for. 

Jaime explained the football drink specials and got a couple of beers on draft for a great deal. Ordered a dozen chicken wings, a cheeseburger with a side of fries, and the Bozeman Beef Dip with a side of fries as well. Food came out hot and at a good time. Not too fast and not too long. Chicken wings were juicy and well sauced. It had a good buffalo tang without the hard fried nubs that chicken wings tend to get when cooked too long. The burger was above average. It was well seasoned, juicy, and not overcooked. Would get again, but pretty safe in the flavor department. The Bozeman Beef Dip was definitely better than another location I've tried. This one had the creamy horseradish sauce we were both fond of. Spicy, creamy, and with that clear up those sinuses horseradish kick! The au jous that came on the side complimented the sandwich too. It was not too soy saucy making dipping the sandwich more enjoyable. Also, the bread was not the super crusty kind where crumbs fall over the place. It was softer and with a cornmeal dusting. The fries were a little salty though. May have to say no salt next time and add to my own preference. Not a deal breaker though.  Bartender checked on us a couple of times and kept our drinks filled. There is a separate dining area if you don't want to eat at the bar. It has big comfy chairs and is very clean. Yelp also had a great check in offer, so we got our meal at a good price! Score! Even if my team isn't! Lol. Jaime even informed me that Timbers has an app that would has perks for loyalty there. Good to know!

Overall, attentive service, good food, and an easy going atmosphere. Would come again even though it's not the closest Timbers next to me. Good service counts and I would drive past the one by my house just to come here.",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,9,7,4,lGRvgwi5lBhCovWlQQDnbQ
