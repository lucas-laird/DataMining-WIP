She offered us cold water as well as complimentary hot tea. There was complimentary soup for dinner, very nice touch on a cold February night. We ordered salt pepper chops, shrimp with salty yolk, seafood pan fried noodles and eggplant with garlic. They were all presented beautifully and all were very good. The pork chop was lean and tender and crispy with just the perfect amount of garlic and chilies. The shrimps were fresh and crispy. The rest of the food were delicious. The hostess and server kept checking on us if there's anything we need and recommended their specials like lobsters and other seafood which we would like to try when we go back. We finished the meal with my favorite warm red bean dessert (a plus that it's free after dinner). 
Price is very reasonable. A lot of food, about $45 for all of above. The service is prompt, personalized and attentive and staff is very friendly and efficient. And yes, this is an authentic Chinese place!

1006422,2016-04-18,1,3TRgD3KLVis61eGvMZrykA,"I rarely give Chinese restaurants five stars, because I have high expectations. To call this restaurant a pleasant surprise is a vast understatement of my family's experience here. We randomly happened across it on a Sunday night when our original dinner plans fell through. Judging from the other Yelp reviews, it just newly opened about half a year ago. Place is bright and clean, and the decor feels very appropriate and comfy. The tables were about half full and all the patrons were speaking either Mandarin or Cantonese, which is always a good indication of the authenticity. Service was excellent and they immediately brought out hot tea for us when we sat down.

Now onto the food: you get complimentary soup, which was a very earthy, rich duck broth with all sorts of lotus and root vegetables in it - very enjoyable. All of our dishes came out fresh, hot, and delicious! They even managed to meet my mother's exacting standards. Expect the menu to have a good variety of traditional Cantonese food, ranging from noodles to stir-fry, with a good array of vegetables and seafood to choose from. My favorite was the green beans, sauteed with pork and some peppers to give it a kick. Portions are very generous and refills on white rice and tea are constantly available. As an added bonus, at the end of the meal you are also automatically treated to a delicious taro sago (tapioca) dessert soup, which hit every single one of my ""childhood nostalgia"" buttons. ::happy sigh::

Who has an appetite after that. We tried to cancel the rest of the meal but the server said it's already cooked so we can't cancel the rest of it. When I said my mother left cause she wanted to throw up and he continued to yell at me if I wanted 911. An apology for starters would've of been nice, but instead I got yelled at. It's crazy how he handled that situation. Was it our fault it wasn't cooked properly, no. Also, don't get offended just because we declined something you suggest when ordering. We didn't want a free meal, only to pay the other dish we ate. He did take off the lamb, but was unwilling to cancel the other dish which didn't even come out yet.

In all honesty, we only ended up here after being put on a 45 minute wait at Boiling Crab & Hot n' Juicy. I typed in ""SEAFOOD"" into Yelp... and yet again, you have not disappointed me, Yelp Gods! This place definitely hit the [seafood] spot!

- HONEY WALNUT SHRIMP ($12.88): Large shrimp in a mayo based sauce with honey walnuts. 
- SHRIMP & EGG SATAY CHOW FUN: A stir fried dish of wide rice noodles, chinese broccoli, carrots and shrimp in a sweet-savory gravy like sauce. 
- SHRIMP WONTON NOODLE SOUP: Traditional shrimp wonton dumplings in a simple broth with thin, ramen-like noodles.

Food: Good
- We ordered quite a few dishes (fried fish, steam fish, green beans, salt and pepper pork chop, French style beef, and duck)
- Out of all the dishes we ordered my favorite was the salt and pepper pork chop. I liked how they were crunchy and cut into smaller pieces.
- The fried fish was delicious, like always. A combination of soft and crispy, the fried fish is always a big hit.
- The steam fish was also good, but expensive. It is approximately $40+ because the fish is live and cooked to order (talk about fresh)!
- The French style beef was also very tender and juicy.

Location/Parking: Good
- Pretty easy to find and parking was no problem at 6pm.
- We called in for a reservation earlier that morning for 9 people on Christmas day and they were able to accommodate with no problem

1352506,2017-01-20,0,3TRgD3KLVis61eGvMZrykA,"Came here for dinner for my grandmother's birthday on Mid Jan 2017 after who knows how many owner changes since original opening on SK Seafood. As my grandmother loves seafood, we were definitely ordering some seafood. After being sat at our table and entire party has arrived shortly, the waitress brought us the menus, hot tea, and gave us a few minutes to decide on what to order. 

Lobster was if i remember correctly, $25/lb. There was a recommendation on quail as well for $28/ea. We had ordered 1 of the quail to try as it was a recommendation and a lobster cooked with green onions and ginger, on top of a bed of E-mein. On the wall, there are a lot of specials listed (though all in chinese so I personally cant read it, but my family can). We had ordered sand ginger chicken, deep fried chicken knee (more on this later lol), cumin lamb, garlic snow pea leaves, spicy wine clams, and preserved veggie large (pig) intestine. 

We were told the table next to us had a lobster about 4.5 lbs. When she brought ours out, she said it was the next biggest at 3.5ish. Oh well. Still live at least xD 

Soup came out which was a house dried veggie soup with pork neck bone, etc. Temp was luke warm. Flavor was decent but seemed maybe a little watered down. 

First to come out was the Lobster and Quail (cut to 6 pieces, enough to share). Quail's skin was perfectly crispy with moist, juicy meat under. A side of salt to dip in for flavor. Lobster was cooked perfectly as well. Lots of meat to share. The lobster as said was on a bed of E-mein. This was more of the disappointing part of the dish. The noodles were overcooked and over soft. The width of the noodles seemed to be bigger than the E-mein we had expected. Aside from the noodles, the lobster was amazing ! 

Deep fried chicken knee... ok some history on this for me. My first time having this dish was in Vancouver in 2004 at a wonton noodle place. They had it as a special so we ordered it to try. Simply deep fried chicken knees (the cartilage part of like the drumstick). Seasoned with salt and pepper. Simple and good ! When i went to Vancouver in 2012, i had to have it again. When we saw it on the specials menu, we had to order it.... It was good overall but it was not entirely the same cartilage part. i noticed some cartilage was from the breast bone, etc etc... my grandma said the had chicken skin too... So... not too genuine on the ingredients they used but still tasted pretty good. Seasoned with salt n pepper and deep fried garlic. 

Garlic snow peas leaves is simple and fresh. Good amount. Nothing else needs to be said. 

Preserved veggie large intestine was flavored well too. Big pieces of large intestine cooked with bell pepper, preserved veggie. Almost like a sweet and sour pork ! except with bell pepper, preserved veggies, black beans, and large intestine... love large intestine. cooked well. had a good ""bite"" to it still. Large fatty pieces. YUM !

Spicy wine clams was pretty decent. Not too spicy. The glass noodles soaked up the soup pretty fast. After a while, they were super fat noodles ! The clams were pretty good. Good amount of clams as well. Had enough to need to pawn off to the ""larger eaters"" of the family (me... -__-"") by the end of the meal. 

The cumin lamb and the sand ginger chicken was the most disappointing dishes of the meal. The sand ginger chicken (tbh iunoe what it was called in the menu, this is directly translated) had a very mild sand ginger flavor and was not savory at all. We ended up using the side salt from the quail for this dish. The cumin lamb, when it originally arrived, we asked the waitress if this was the right order. It seemed to have a lot of leek, celery, etc cooked with sliced lamb. The ""cumin"" flavor was super mild even when we told the waitress we liked spicy and a lot of cumin flavor. She had brought it back to the kitchen to ask to have more cumin added but even after it returned, there was still not much flavor. 

Overall, this meal was pretty decent except the last 2 dishes. The dessert (mung bean soup) was very mildly sweet as well with minimal mung bean. So i guess the last 3 items.. Meal costed a little over $200 for 6 people, with the lobster being almost half the cost.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,0,3,QlIcKiT2NrMM1qUJQVyehQ

I personally dislike how ""market price"" is listed for nearly every dish in the category, but found a bunch of other tasty items to try. Dishes are made quick and served family-style.

HOUSE SOUP: Gratis with meal, on the plain side, mostly broth with hints of ginger. Much appreciated to warm us up on our 40-degree evening.
SCALLION PANCAKES: Four-piece order, delicate and light with a nicely crisp exterior. These complemented our heartier entrees nicely.
LAMB AND LEEK: So good! Plenty of leeks and green onion, generous and tender portion of lamb, definitely something I would get again! 
""EGGPLANT WITH GROUND PORK"": I assume there was a miscommunication because my dish had eggplant but no pork, but it was still good. Soft chunks of eggplant, a rich dark sauce, bits of ginger and red pepper everywhere. 
HOUSE DESSERT: Black sticky rice, date, and red bean soup, allegedly good for circulation, balanced flavor but not to my BF's liking. 

Service was shockingly good- I'm used to receiving the bare minimum at most places on Spring Mountain, but here we were checked up on regularly by several staff members.

The ambiance of this restaurant is your typical Cantonese restaurants in Chinatown. Nothing fancy, but quite clean and tidy. Pictures of food on the wall. Wait staff is very helpful. 

First lunch, we ordered:
1. Spicy beef slices -  $3.99. Beef is slightly tough, but otherwise an excellent dish. If the beef slices were soaked in the porridge, it is softened a lot. I will rate this dish a B+. 
2. Jelly fish - $3.99. Good tasty dish for appetizers. A solid A-.
3. Onion Pancake - $3.00 . Another solid B+.
4. Meat Ball  Porridge - an excellent bowl of porridge.  A solid A. 

Then for dinner, we ordered:
1, Scallion Crab - a super dish. One of the best crabs I have had. An A, no ifs or buts.
2. Broccoli in white wine sauce - another solid A.
3. Spicy beef slices - a repeat from this morning. 
4. Steam Bleeker Fish ?? - We made an error on this. This type of fish should be pan fried and not steamed. If it were steamed, the fish meat texture will be too mushy. Not an issue with the cook. Still it is not a great dish. 
5. Princess Chicken ( ??? ) --   too tough but when we were asked how the dishes were, we indicated to the waitress and this dish was not charged. This dish would have gotten a D+.

Both lunch and dinner were served with house soup -- Cantonese soup. Rice comes with the entrees. Tea is without question, part of the meal. 

A very enjoyable dinner place. If you like Cantonese seafood, you will like this place. 

I have a rough time to give any Chinese restaurant a 5 star, but this one comes close to it. But because of the ambiance, because of the fish dish, and also because of the chicken dish, I lowered it to a 4 star.

Ever since HK Star became another restaurant (and the quality went way down), we were looking for a suitable replacement in town. SK seafood fits the bill as the go-to casual Chinese place.

This restaurant is more of a traditional Cantonese style joint albeit with cleaner environment and surprisingly excellent service. (By excellent, I mean like no hassle for getting ice water and on the ball with refills....unheard of in a Chinese restaurant!) The wait staff is amazingly good and happy to make recommendations if you are stuck.

For now, they will always give you soup to start...even during lunchtime. Dinner includes a dessert as well.

We've tried multiple things on the menu (which is large!) and there are a few standouts and a couple of misses.

Things that great: pork neck meat with stir-fried assorted mushrooms(a great dish...a must try!), stir-fried eggplant, stir-fried pea shoots leaves with garlic (seasonal item: only good during Spring usually), green onion pancake, salt and pepper fish fillet (on the lunch menu, it is a good deal), braised tofu, salt and pepper tofu and fried tofu. The wonton noodles are also very solid (My mom is very particular about this dish and it got her seal of approval).

Their stir-fried dishes are not overly coated with large amounts of goopy sauce. A major plus in my book.

The misses were the salt and pepper pork chops and the sweet and sour pork. The reason is the pork is a little too fatty for me rather than an issue with execution.

Overall prices are very reasonable and on par with other Chinese establishments in town. Serving sizes are generous.

This restaurant is not too big and not too small, but very simple and clean too.  The food is served in big portions with original Chinese flavors.  Plus, they offered complimentary soup daily, and upon request, they will continue to refill your bowl for you!   The soup is very flavorable and nutritious, along with the dessert.  Traditional Cantonese style food.

And, we were still not done yet when the owner, with such a warm and genuine heart, knew that we caught a taxi over to the restaurant, she kindly offered us a free ride back to our hotel!

The chefs cooked really tasty food at a very fair price.  I would definitely eat at this restaurant every night.

I strongly recommend everyone to eat there!  You will be more than happy enjoying your meals and having a super, fantastic friendship with the owner!  She is someone very sweet, with a loving heart, that I guarantee you will keep going back for more!  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner!!!

Our order-

Their Signature Crispy Squab ($18.88)- it was more of a roasted than fried. It had crispy skin and tasted fresh.

Shredded Duck w/Braised Noodle ($9.88)- it wasn't dry but moist with plenty of shredded duck. 

Deep Fried Shrimp w/salt & pepper ($9.88)- it was breaded and did not disappoint. 

Tsing Tao Beer $4.

The fish was very fresh (right out of the tank) and probably the best dish. The clams were fresh as well, juicy, plump and served with generous mix of green and red bell peppers which I love. The reasons for not giving 5 stars were due to the kailan not being more leafy parts and the squab wasn't more flavorful. Both were cooked well though.

The complimentary soups are only for dinner.

He provided a great service which I hardly have experienced in Chinese restaurant. I enjoyed most of the stuff that we order as well.

The great thing about Cantonese restaurant is that you get free daily soup and dessert soup. I enjoyed both their daily soup and dessert soup a lot as well. Walnut shrimp, salt and pepper tofu, salt and pepper chicken wings, and jelly fish are some of my favorite from our dinner.

The soup was good. Sweet from the carrots. The dishes we ordered were wonderful and decently portioned. The garlic string beans were fried. The garlic sauce on it added savoriness. The Peking pork chops were sweet and saucy but some of the pieces were too fatty. The tofu seafood hotpot had a good portion of fish shrimp and squid. It was really good. I loved the soft texture of the tofu. The beef chow fun was also great. The meat is not too chewy. It was tender and delicious.

We already knew we wanted to eat steamed crab and saw that it was $30 for a crab, which seems comparable to all the other places. Also got an appetizer pig ear. 
Once we were done ordering, they brought out a big bowl of old fire soup, or house soup, which was comprised of bones and various vegetables. It tastes like it's been on the stove all day. The pig ear was served and big portions for $3.88. Watch out for the kick of the Szechuan peppercorns on that! 

Then the main event. Crab was steamed with garlic and the picture is worth 100 words. It was fresh and flavorful, made me eat more rice than normal because I was dousing it with the crab juice.

The waiters (which were all men and had a laid back attitude) gave us our menus and answered any questions we had. They brought out our food in a timely manner and fulfilled any request. During the first visit we fell in love with the food and service which made us want to come back. 

Today we came back for a second time and boyyyy I don't really know if I want to come back! This time the servers were all women and omg they were really CONTROLLING! Let's start with the first 5 mins of sitting...Can someone explain to me why they gave us 1 lunch menu for 3 people! Um wth how am I suppose to look at the menu?? So we ask for 2 more menus so we can all choose what we want. 

Second problem...Drinks. Where are they?? I asked for 3 waters and a soda. Simple enough right? Nope! Our dishes arrived before the drinks! & When the server did give our drinks she chose not to give us straws even though it was on the tray she was HOLDING! Like why you holding out?? 

Third problem...The bill. Do I look like I'm going to run away or something?? Food gets to the table and so does the bill. Ok, so I'll pay it after I eat right? NOPE! I thought wrong! The waitress informs me that I must pay NOW and I should be the FIRST to pay before the other two customers that are sitting at my table. Wtf?? So I get up and pay the bill. 

Fourth problem...The bill AGAIN! So now she tells me that she forgot to add the soda to my bill. REALLY?? So once again I have to take a pause from eating my meal to pay again! 

Fifth problem...I mean really there's a fifth problem? This can't be real smh. I ask for to go boxes. You know the regular sized to go boxes...well guess what apparently this paying customer cannot have one. I must settle for the TEENY TINY TO GO BOXES. Keep in mind that I had about 4 dishes that needed a box! The waitress insist that the food can fit, but guess what! The sauces of all the food spilled and I had a mess to clean up once I got home! 

Sixth problem..This is getting ridiculous isn't it?? So I order sweet and sour chicken to go and guess what!? IT'S FREAKIN PORK! They clearly speak english fine BUT these women don't care to listen to what the customer says or wants! These women want to do whatever it is that they want to do. 

I can see myself going back BUT I do not want to be served by these specific female waitresses. Don't get me wrong I am not against female servers. What I am against are women who are controlling what I order and when I have to pay!",fSFpjl-C0fXY7h7cG8Wxeg,1,1,3,TfAWwgrXPLbUmNtkjcWPRQ
