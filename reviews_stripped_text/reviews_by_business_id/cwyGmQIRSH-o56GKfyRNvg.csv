I just returned from vacationing in Kansas City,  where folks are real friendly and service is very good, so I wasn't expecting the tip top service I got from the drive through!  I didn't see the mushroom buttery jack on the menu, so I asked about it, and instead of brushing my request off (which usually happens) the nice kid asked the manager, and made the burger for me, just how I wanted it. He was friendly and helpful and a cutie, too! Give that kid Raul a raise!!",ll2JpHHayEwnCwbOvoNpug,0,0,4,n0NMd2iuuLoWAfpejaYHsA

They were so good I ate both when I got  home and put  the shake in the freezer for later.
Crystal if you don't want to run Jack in the Box think about a career in TV and or Radio

Went through the drive thru and ordered a meal with a coupon, pulled up to the window and the female in a maroon shirt (appeared to be a manager or supervisor) was too busy talking to an hispanic male in a grey shirt (possible manager) about nothing really. The window was open, so I could tell they were just talking. Finally she just turned to me, without saying a word and stuck her hand out. I waited, thinking she was a beggar on the street the way she just had her hand out (the receipt says her name was Jesica). I could not give her money because as I ordered she said that she would have my total at the window.  She finally asked for the coupon. I gave it to her, she told me how much it would cost for my meal. So she told me, I paid, all while she was still talking about her day with the guy in the gray shirt. She hands me change, and NO RECEIPT. I tried to ask her for the receipt because I'd like to know if I got the correct change, but she ignored me and kept talking. After a couple minutes she brought the food. I asked her if the receipt was in the bag, she didn't answer me. She only printed off a reciept and handed it to me. Just reallly poor customer service. What really irks me is that if they were just regular workers and a boss or manager came in, they would have stopped talking and started working. I guess when you are the supervisor, you can just not have any customer service skills at all. 
I would have given them a 1-star review but the meal was good. That is something they had nothing to do with. Jesica and the male hispanic manager or supervisor need to desperately work on their customer service skills.",dxCce2EdLOAy78Y3fAXCgw,0,0,2,eb0uzRI-8O8MZQRttyLTUA
1732038,2017-08-26,0,cwyGmQIRSH-o56GKfyRNvg,"What does Jack in the Box put in their meat ? Beef, salt, yeast extract, corn maltodextrin, onion powder, natural flavor, spice, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, garlic powder, sugar, modified corn starch, beef tallow, triacetin. That was the most nasty mystery meat I have ever tasted in my entire life! It ruined my whole meal. I was looking forward to a a nice hamburger and it was the worst experience I've ever had. I didn't say anything or ask for money back because it's not the employees fault that Jack in the Box uses such crap in their food.  I found out that it's only the quarter-pound patties that they put all this crap in so if you get a bigger Patty then a quarter pounder then it's just beef. Seriously why would you even mess with it?",TzSfSBL7hjjacEEb-YUN7w,0,0,2,3oMEzO7uM4thYGag21CFaA

2478868,2015-04-08,0,cwyGmQIRSH-o56GKfyRNvg,Not even 1 star let me start off by saying I loved Jack in the box but now I'm really grossed out by my experience there. I walked into the bathroom to wash my hands and it smelled really bad and it was very dirty! Then I went to order my food the cashier was really rude. As I looked around I noticed there was food on the floor all the tables were dirty and everything just looked gross. My food came out cold everything tasted like it was not even prepared. Through it all away idk how that place is open. Just want to say I'll never go back,wxjY7zgCR3McT1Z9M2JGfA,0,0,1,H1bSBITv2oUBUS7Dv2G6RA

Stopped by for breakfast for my 2 kids and I, i order for one kid and was told to go to the window for total, even though I said I had more to order, I was told my total and to go order the rest at the window, my other kid didn't get to order and was done by then so I didn't order either.

I ordered a Country Scrambler Breakfast. My food was cold. My eggs were raw, not fully cooked. I was given a sausage patty, instead of sausage link, and was not informed of the substitute. The potatoes were wet and mushy. I was very dissatisfied with my meal.",YuBsRCyxh3ZKXrhinj2kMg,1,0,2,4YRpARZMO3XZuj0cAuuH9A

I asked for a number one and was about to explain how I wanted my burger and then she cuts me of asking me small medium or large???? She then proceeded to stop talking and help the customers in front of me, I'm guessing since it was silent. She comes back and I think maybe she doesn't understand me: So I start speaking Spanish she starts speaking to me in Spanish so I'm like great maybe will get somewhere!! Nope She does the same crap as I start telling her how I want the burger she doesn't even listen!! Then she leaves without saying anything and didn't even say hold on or anything!!! She gets back to speaker and tells me have you decided what you wanted?? Like really I've know what I wanted since I drove up!! She then ask me to speak harder! I responded like you mean louder!!! I told her if she was ready to listen to me and if she is going to be allow me express what I want on my hamburger then I could go on with the size of drink and fries!!! Of course No response just horrible poor service!!! Attention manager train you drive thru night shift customer service is horrible and not good for business!!! I drove off!!

She parked us too. Even though like I said no one was behind us. 

She was so impatient and didn't smile once. 
Probably won't return as she always seems to be manager on duty",4zYXfexoVWSHGst4sojpHw,0,0,1,OXeRnlnuQjMWeDWtNkrapA
