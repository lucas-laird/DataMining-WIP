The food is... well the word horrible does it justice. As for the clientele, the only one in the place not wearing an ankle (monitoring) bracelet was me.

I drove out to visit this place based on the good reviews on Urban Spoon. I was harassed by 2 separate guys while getting out of my car - asking for money. I felt very unsafe here. It was 1pm on a Monday! I looked in and noticed that the actual drugstore had closed and the building was empty. Tiffany's was still open though. I went inside and found one customer sitting at the counter and another standing waiting for a take out order. There was a man cooking at the grill and a woman behind the counter. As I walked in, the woman behind the counter looked at me then turned around and faced the grill man. She stood there staring at him while he was cooking for over 3 minutes and completely ignored me as I was standing at the counter. I said, ""excuse me"" and was ignored still. After looking at the cleanliness of this place (which was quite disgusting) and after being rudely ignored purposely, I decided to leave and never come back! I was astonished at how rude the woman was. If they have good food, I will never know as the service is deplorable and not worth the time. What a shame.",GEzdyAxbJqR0_rQEKzwUvw,2,0,1,Ah6l5douzu9cR1xBFZDpqA

Closing by the end of the month. Usually I would be sad that another piece of my hometown's history is biting the dust, but since this is a place that really just doesn't care about that, I just feel really numb upon hearing this news. It's still sad though. Thankfully some free time is coming my way so I can pay this spot a visit.

The Final Verdict (since I didn't do it last time):

Pros:
Out of the ordinary.
An independent drugstore, something which is very, VERY rare these days. 
Sells a wide variety of items.
Vintage Vegas photos and posters adorn the walls.

Cons:
Grungy.
I don't think I could stomach the diner (and yet that's the part that's going to stay open. Well isn't that like rain on your wedding day?)

Suggestions: Make it a tourist attraction? On one hand it could keep the place open and provide a tourist attraction that isn't so, well, typical for Vegas. On the other hand, it would stop being a secret and therefore lose it's secret charm. 

Would I return? Absolutely, shame the place is closing.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,2,1,4,HWGhWmqThVP_qwKGiEtOag

One of my friends told me about this place a few months ago, and it had me wondering what inside of this so called drugstore and diner.   That's a business combination which is a dying breed everywhere in the United States, but I had to see it from myself.     Since a few of my friends we're staying in downtown on a short vacation from Hawaii, I decide to check this place out on my way home to Henderson, because I needed cough drops anyway :)

I walked into the place, and it wasn't a Walgreens, but had the inventory of drugstore from a small town.   A few nick knack here and there, and then I found my cough drops.    What caught my eye was the nostalgic pictures, and signs that line lined the walls of an older, simpler time.   This is old Las Vegas, and the owners of this place should marketing themselves as the last of a dying breed that shouldn't be dying.  

Even the diners has a feel of a original 1950's soda fountain, because it still the pretty much has the original equipment;  heck, if people only knew what inside of this place, it could be jumping!   I could see  Vince Vaughn character from the movie, Swingers on top of a table and dancing on it. ...yes, the diner is open 24 hours.    I have to admit, the Meatloaf looked pretty good.

It's last of old Las Vegas, appreciate it while we still have it.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,6,4,5,AI_OVKmZ4sVDLC0Ypl5oeg

It is a relic that serves Salisbury Steaks and Chocolate Malts, I still don't understand Malts.

4344939,2010-10-05,2,m7u5k3-_6WGOwLaVznCKKQ,"You gotta love this place after a hard night out!!

Being here reminds you of the soda fountains back in the day. I've been here a few times and somehow it always seems to be on my way back from someplace in Old Vegas (because it's easily on my way home) and it's rarely crowded, but even if it is that doesn't mean too much because there's only room for about 20 people tops. 

There's a counter that you sit at and the cook is also your waiter (Waffle House style, for you Southerners). They have a nice menu considering that it's pretty much gonna be a grease fest (aside from you soups and salads), but the whole experience is quite entertaining.
Because you're watching the food be prepared, it all eves that feeling of ""where's my food"" because you're watching the guy Hustling to get your food done, and I think of it as the floor show while you wait for your food.
Your food will always arrive hot because the distance from the grill to your  seat is never more than about 30 feet, and the minute the cook is done with your food he hands it right to you.
The cook is a guy who's probably been there so long he can tell you what salad dressing Judas had on his salad at  The Last Supper, but he is a lovely man with a charming disposition.
The food always hits the spot and it's also a great place to pick up that extra roll of toilet paper, bread or toothpaste you might need when you wake up in the morning.

Don't expect much, and you won't be disappointed, although you CAN depend on it being open at any time, your time there being a charming (even nostalgic) experience, and the food to hit that guilty pleasure spot.

I was on a work trip to Vegas in June 2014.  The deodorant stick I packed crumbled in my luggage and I was looking for an excuse to go here since I saw it on Yelp.

I probably should not have bothered, any CVS/Rite Aid/etc would have been better.

There are a lot of mentions of some kind of diner/restaurant in this place, which seems to have closed.  There was no restaurant.  There is a small drug store/general store area with basics (I bought deodorant, Oreos, chips, and gum), a deli counter, and a liquor store which takes up half of the floor space.

There were maybe 3 customers the whole time I was there.  The store seems to be in the middle of nowhere, on an intersection well off the strip with little to no foot traffic.
