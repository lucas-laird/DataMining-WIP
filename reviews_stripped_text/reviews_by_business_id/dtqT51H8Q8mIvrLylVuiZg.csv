I admit I was hesitant to stop here because of the location (Corner of Smoke Ranch and Rainbow, basically the edge of North LV) but it's convenient, literally right off the freeway and a fairly quiet place. It is inside a shopping center, right next door to Pepe's. 

We did the AYCE, and I was impressed. Everything was fresh and tasted great! The server was friendly and the owner was behind the bar making the sushi. 

A few rolls I ordered: 
*Pink Lady 
*Playboy (my favorite) 
*Something Wrong 69
*Donde PaPa 
*James Bond 

Definitely going back! It's a small location, so I will probably only go at lunch so I don't have to worry about a wait.",Bet1qVniQY7FX8UFuUCVMw,3,0,5,HpTDAJvcEEq977y-NI7iLA

I was passing by and found the place right next to the theater. Went along and sat at the bar. 
Did AYCE the price was decent. $2 cheaper than most places. Ordered salmon holic, something wrong 69, rainbow, and salmon nigiri. They were all good. The amount of rice was perfect, fish was fresh and well-cut. Food came out on perfect pace, and the sushi chef was very friendly. I am pretty sure saw him at other restraunt before though. The only reason for 4 stars is I never saw the server after i got drink. My drink was never refilled.

It's a big sushi bar with about 12 tables around the outside of it. I was excited to try this place because it's just around the corner. I usually drive all the way to spring mntn for sushi neko or umiya, that's like a 20 min drive for me. 
I thought this place was pretty great! The quality of sushi was good! The service was a little slow, but we watched 5 tables come in at the same time, while there were already 4 tables there. There were only two sushi chefs, and only one waitress. The waitress was very apologetic for the slow service, and the fact that we didn't get an item we had ordered. It was no big deal. As I said, it was very busy all at once. They have only been open for 3 weeks, I believe everything will be much better once there is more staff. Our server was very sweet and I would definitely come back here again. She told us about specials that we didn't see, and she recommended great appetizers for us, like the coconut shrimp tempura! The appetizers are great! The sushi is tasty, they do half rolls! For an ayce place, I think it's awesome and I'd definitely recommend it!",DxH-xZ-OwYG7nLOQIbTdXQ,2,0,4,Zgc58K_UIoNfqW1v5m95LA

The nigiris are chewy which means the fish isn't fresh... The eel is soggy and cold... Waste of money but at the same time at least we know never to come back here again... At least two other tables also sat around waiting for their food longer than they actually spent eating their food...

We were greeted happily seeing a family of six. When they realized my middle child was only 8 and just met their requirement of half price for kids the service changed. The waiter had the nerve to come over and ask my daughter to verify her age. Then we ordered. Our niargi first, in every other sushi place we've always been given that first. No, not here. They brought our rolls out first, in an effort to fill us. I decided to order my youngest some chicken teriyaki and my other daughter (who was AYCE) some tempura shrimp, we were questioned like we were criminals trying to sneak the teriyaki chicken I had ordered a la carte. They bring it out, over spiced with black pepper. The baby proceeds to throw it on the floor and then cry from the spicy. I call over the waitress and inform her she can't eat it and to take it. Thinking, this would be taken off the bill because she didn't eat a single bite. Still our niagri hasn't shown I ask the waiter where it is, and he dumbfounded states he thought everything came out. And then proceeded to rudely ask us what we ordered. The remaining food comes out. We proceed to order our dessert items. And of course get a vanilla mochi for the two non AYCE children at the table, being reminded it will be charged a la carte. At this point, I had a feeling that they didn't remove the chicken teriyaki. I ask for the bill. Sure enough it is on the bill. I ask why and I'm told ""With all due respect"" with the most condescending attitude possible, ""she ate some of it"".  I replied she couldn't eat it, and the it was over seasoned with black pepper. He then decided he should bring it up with his manager. They decide they aren't going to remove it even after I again stated that it was too spicy and she threw it on the floor, ""with all due respect we aren't removing it"". He even had the nerve to look on the floor. Which I had cleaned up because I don't think it's right to leave extra messes. I notified him that we will no longer be eating here due to the way we have been treated. Which is sad, because we've been here multiple times and referred friends here as well. So, if you like mediocre sushi and horrible service this is the place for you.

Upon arrival we weren't greeted at the door until about 5 mins later with the waiter standing directly in front of us. We were seated at the bar with dirty counters. The waitress then comes over and says oh it's dirty huh. 

Afterwards we ordered the all you can eat, and I began with a two piece nigiri roll ( knowing exactly what I ordered) I am then informed its raw and two pieces by the puzzled chef. I said yes sir I know. The atmospheric pressure of sitting in a non clean judgmental was unbearable.  

I then order sake (hot) and sborro beer.  We began to eat the sushi still waiting on condiment refills whilst every other customer is being cared for. The chef changes out and the next one is great! Remarkable conversation with a pleasant smile. So my companion says ""I guess the other chef just needed a little break."" The waiter then says snarly "" HE CAN IF HE WANTS, HES THE OWNER AND YOU CAN TAKE BREAKS WHEN YOU OWN STUFF."" 

In pure disbelief because we were conversing amongst ourselves my companion says objectively "" I understand being a business owner myself"" he rudely walks away.

The sushi was mediocre and the hospitality cold. Could be a great place if they leave their stereotypes at home and focus more on keeping the sushi cold.",9Qtv2_0pcR6GZEHctZ974A,5,1,2,h9A8rFt9xPCY7aDwZxkKWA

The waitress was nice, but kept asking us to order more before we had even gotten any food, or the last things we ordered. For a place that charges you if you don't finish, they should at least wait until you've eaten something before offering to let you order more.",dct-Z72jZnpcEFoj21NU-A,2,0,3,kaePFaQ17hSGZcswVME9tw

I read some iffy reviews about different things here, but I wanted to find out for myself. So here goes what I thought of the place....

Customer service: They were super nice. They came to our table often, granted it wasn't super busy when we got there. Always looking to refill our drinks and take our dirty plates. The place is small and doesn't hold a whole lot of people so I can see how it can be long wait times when they get busy. Place was clean. 

Food: This is all based on their $24.99 ayce menu. They have a good selection of rolls, appetizers and a few desserts. We tried as many things as we could, to see how good everything was. 
For the appetizers, we tried the coconut and regular tempura shrimp as well as the tempura calamari. They were all good. My boyfriend really enjoyed the taste of the coconut shrimp. We also tried the I believe the crazy jalapeno which was ok and by far my favorite, the bacon scallop skewers. I could've just eaten those all night. I'm glad there's not a limit on them. 
For the rolls, they have a variety of specials, a list of shrimp tempura rolls, baked rolls and deep fried rolls. We tried the 
NewYork NewYork
Sexy Lazy
Sexy Bomb
Hot & Juicy
Taste Like Girlfriend
They all were good. I liked the Sexy Bomb, the best. It was delicious. I was really happy to see that they had a whole section of shrimp tempura rolls because they're my favorite ones. 
For the desserts, I really wanted to try the yuzu sorbet, but they were out, so I got a mochi instead because you can never go wrong with mochi. They allow you to pick 2 desserts per person. Besides the mochi, we tried the choco banana and tempura ice cream and they were both amazing. The choco banana is 4 pieces of deep fried bananas and vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. I loved it! He got the tempura ice cream which I think was green tea. I didn't like it because I don't like green tea, but he absolutely loved it and ate the whole thing, after he said he was too full and was only going to take a bite to see if it was any good.",uT88e0NuTpxcqcv3cAyUKA,1,1,4,bTxOWfoqdIghkP5AzIjD6Q

The quality of the fish was superb. The service level provided by CJ the owner was impeccable! He was very meticulous with his craft and always addressed me by my name so I felt right at home immediately.

Definitely try their Saba (Mackerel) and make sure to have some of your fish ""torched"" as it adds another dimension of flavor ;-)

It just opened up recently and it has a lot of room to grow, but at the moment, they are very understaffed at the front and are still visibly trying to get their gears going as a new and upcoming sushi joint. 

The food was great, they don't overload the rolls with rice, and the food comes out relatively quickly once you order. 

The hard part is waiting for a server to finally attend to your table because they only had one or two running around the area. I believe that I waited around 10-15 minutes waiting for a server to attend to my table.

Getting seated is also awkward because they don't have a host stand; you just stand literally at the front door waiting for a server to notice you and give you A seat.

I would give this another chance though. Food was good enough to gain a returning customer",wWwQpbwEzeAuVanhbCqb7A,1,1,3,CWHWMkvx_cnFby7_A0-WiQ

I give my respect to this AYCE sushi in north rainbow. First thing first as soon as I was walked in I noticed how clean the restaurant was maintained. The other thing that was a plus for me was the staff were always smiling and friendly. Now let's get to the main part the dishes. Appetizers coconut shrimp, bacon scallop, garlic edamame, was excellent. Must try also was the stuffed tomato and tuna poke. I've tried other pokes at other joints but hands down this place makes it the best. The screaming orgasm gave me a heart attack almost. I ordered some nigiri sushi sake, saguro, hamachi, hotate, unagi, teach me how you do it, all of it was excellent. Also if you guys like chicken, the chicken of sushi is the collar of salmon and yellowtail must try! I will be back no doubt thank you to the head chef CJ & chef hesus.

My parents aren't big sushi people and are just getting into trying new rolls, and they were very impressed. Initially we thought we'd do AYCE, but our check ended up being less when we were charged for individual rolls so that's how our server rang us up. It was really courteous of her to do that, because she could have charged us for AYCE anyway and we probably wouldn't have noticed the difference.

ATMOSPHERE: 
When dining out, the vibe in a restaurant really can be a game changer. At OMG sushi the tables are not too big and the chairs are not the most comfortable, but who cares about that when they had an awesome music playlist blasting?! I mean you want to sit here and do AYCE sushi with friends/family just to enjoy the food and music. I really appreciated the nice music after a long day.

FOOD:
This is what you came for... 
We tried a variety of rolls, first off the fish at this place was fresh. No smell, nice texture, and no fishy aftertaste. I'm very picky about my sushi but one roll stood out above the others the ""911 roll"" this roll is one of the best in Vegas inside the roll you have spicy tuna and cucumber, and on top you have a heaping portion of avocado finished with sriacha dot on each roll, highly recommend if your trying to stick to a more healthy diet and avoid the rolls with heavy cream cheese and spicy mayo. Spicy Garlic edamame are also worth a mention, I know many places make it but OMG  does it a bit better than most. Last but certainly not least TEMPURA...yes I'm crazy about tempura, and I truly believe I'll be returning to OMG for their delicious tempura. The batter used for tempura at OMG is amazing, but best of all the shrimp and veggies are cooked to perfection not over battered and served piping hot. Even my friends (who normally don't care for tempura) were impressed. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
The staff at OMG sushi were very friendly and attentive, we never had to ask for any of the essentials, and when we did request something  (extra ginger) our waitress was on it! They were good at clearing our table as we had many rolls coming in and out. Also we didn't feel pressured to leave after we finished dinner and were just talking and having a good time. 

Overall I recommend OMG sushi if your in this area of Vegas, there's a roll for everyone and the fish used is solid, along with good customer service.",xX1wftld9-ndtISAAihqng,2,2,4,S_LcBKse2e5FP6ReL06cuA

They forgot our orders and took about 25 mins for each dish to come out. They looked extremely understaffed. But still not an excuse when your paying 30$ a person.

It's next to AMC rainbow too, so if you're craving great sushi after the movies or if you're simply around the area, this is a go-to sushi restaurant. The waiter and waitress that usually take my order when I visit are sweet and friendly, so I don't know what the other customers' comments were about poor customer service. Even the chefs are awesome especially TJ, the head chef. He makes sure you are happy and very much accommodated. He even made me and my boyfriend a customized roll. When they first opened, we even got free plum flavored sake. It just shows how friendly and welcoming they are. The food selection is really great. I'd say this is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in town, and I only have two favorite places for AYCE. I like how every sushi roll is fresh and tasty, and they have other options like seafood salad and oysters that other places don't have. They have mostly everything on their menu, so this place is not just for sushi but everything else that other restaurants fail to have.

4014353,2017-06-23,0,dtqT51H8Q8mIvrLylVuiZg,"OMG...I know why they call this place OMG Sushi!  So naughty!  Food isn't half bad either!

This is probably the closest place to my house that has decent AYCE sushi.  Tons of them in town for sure, but this one fits the bill nicely when the wifey & I wanna go out on date night but not too far from home.  Hello...OMG Sushi is literally in the same mall as the AMC theatre!  Literally steps away!  Dinner & a movie!  BOOM!!

So wifey & I did end up at OMG Sushi on a late Friday night for dinner.  We chose the AYCE option because really, for the price you do get a great selection to choose from.  Their $24.99 a person for dinner is a few dollars cheaper than other AYCE sushi around town.  You know me, I'm a saver!  Extra money for poker.  Or craps.  Or slots.  Or whatever you kids play these days.

As a note - AYCE has a 60 minute time limit, but if you order all your items before the 60 minutes is up they have no issue with you sticking around a little longer.  But then again I noticed folks were going past the 60 minute time limit anyway so you probably don't have to worry too much.  Good thing about OMG Sushi is that you get pretty much full run of the menu for dinner, appetizers included!  And you can bet your little sushi lovin' mind that I ate as much as I could AND chose the most expensive stuff on the menu!  LOL

It's easy to see after looking at the menu why they call it OMG Sushi.  Could it be because it's sooooo good?  More likely it's because of the crazy names they give their food!!  This goes way beyond a ""screaming orgasm""!  Some of the sushi rolls we ate at OMG, and mind you these are actual names on the menu:

-Something Wrong 69
-I Love My Ass
-Playboy
-Taste Like Girlfriend (this was actually really good LOL)
-Sexy Lazy
-Sexy Bomb
-Fat Ass

So creative with the naming!  It's even funnier when you're ordering them!  Our waitress kept a straight face & repeated the order back to us while I was chuckling saying each one.  Can you imagine?  Someone repeating back to you, ""I Love My Ass""?  I just couldn't stop giggling.  

But you know what?  Each of those rolls weren't half bad!  The fish was pretty fresh and the sauces weren't too salty either.  Best thing though was that they let us order half rolls of everything so we could try so many more different ones!  We ordered so many more different things too:

-Screaming O
-Japanese Nacho
-Agedashi Tofu
-Sesame Chicken
-Seafood Salad
-California hand roll
-Salmon Skin hand roll
-Kiss of Fire
-Japanese Lasagna
-Newyork Newyork

So much food for the 2 of us!  We really tried a bunch of stuff.  I'm not gonna say it was life changing sushi, but I totally appreciate their effort.  I like it here at OMG Sushi just for the fact we could do half orders of rolls - lots of places frown on that pretty hard.

But we weren't done there!  Don't forget dessert!  AYCE patrons get up to 2 desserts per person!  We ended up getting:

-Mochi Ice Cream (strawberry)
-Tempura Ice Cream (green tea)
-Choco Banana

Desserts were just OK.  Basically tempura batter around ice cream or around bananas.  But they tasted pretty good because the batter was light and crisp, not too heavy.  Not a bad way to end the meal though, great palette cleanser for all that rice & fish we just ate!

Overall it was a good experience.  The service was quick & friendly.  Our server was also pretty good at memorizing our order of rolls & appetizers - she didn't write any of it down!  I like the fact it's near home and easy for a quick meal with very little fuss.  

OMG...we'll be back just for the giggles!

I looked around at a few places online and decided on OMG Sushi. It was close, they have an AYCE for $25.00 that included everything on the menu (sashimi, apps, all the rolls and dessert)  and for the non-sushi fan I had with me they also had a separate menu where they were able to get a beef teriyaki bowl.
   We arrived pretty early so it was just us and one or two other people. I'm pretty sure this is a brand new place so we were excited to give it a try and it looked really clean. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The rolls were really good, I especially enjoyed the ""Taste Like Girlfriend"" roll and their fried calamari. The spicy garlic edamame we were not too crazy about. It was lacking flavor and there were just big pieces of pepper flakes that were not good. All our rolls, apps, soup, etc came out really quickly so that was nice.
   The only other thing I would comment on is the ambiance. The walls are bare so it leaves something to be desired there, but overall it was a great experience. By the time we were leaving around 7:45pm they were starting to get pretty busy so I'd come around 6:00pm to avoid any rush because they do have limited seating being a tiny place.

Good things (relative to the other place)
Price, service, friendliness, freshness.
Not-so-good things... 
Not as much variety as I'm used to, the rolls that are not spicy in the other place, we're spicy in this place. 
So, the rolls that were spicy in the other place, were too spicy in this place.
Larger than the other place, so for lunch, it wasnt too crowded. 
The chefs weren't as talkative as in the other place, but today, I didn't mind.
Speedy in-and-out, which is always a plus.
It's got ""AYCE appeal."" I should copyright that phrase.
Not as bright atmosphere as the other place, but that's okay. 
I would still classify it as child-friendly.
Bathrooms were clean.
Plenty of parking.

Call me a purist, non-adventurous, whatever. But I firmly believe that sushi doesn't need to be fried and covered in sauce to be good. In fact, that's my least favorite kind. Unfortunately, most every special roll offered was drowning in ponzu. It was good for the first one or two, but didn't leave a good feeling in my stomach after that. 

The fish it's self wasn't of good quality and that was apparent in the two pieces of nigiri we had- a tuna and salmon. Standard and easy enough to judge across the board. The tuna had a weird texture. It was off. You could tell it was frozen previously and it tasted like nothing. The rice was also lacking in terms of taste and texture. Salmon was the same story. 

By the time we were ready for our check, 3 or 4 other parties had come in. The waitress was notified but decided to take and run orders for 15+ minutes after the fact. We left cash instead of waiting for however much longer we would have had to and dipped. 

Was hoping for a better experience because of other YE reviews.",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,9,3,2,wJisTLmzMGwiazI1jqLHWw

I was very hungry and must have had 15-20 selections. I felt sort of guilty and a little like the late John Pinette at the all-you-can-eat buffet 'You go now!' 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw_pV7sMBCU  if you're interested)
But they were very, very accommodating. I suppose the rice/fish equation was more rice than some ultra-expensive place but it wasn't bad. The idea that I can look at this enormous menu and literally have anything I want was amazing. 
They've been there only 3 months. CJ was my sushi chef from S. Korea and he used to play shortstop till he broke his arm.  Now he makes sushi! And pretty damn well!

The salmon, tuna, and yellowtail nigiri were not fresh, the nigiri rice in general was poorly executed and detracted from all the selections of fish. The best items were the unagi, ikura and salmon skin hand roll but it might differ on another day depending on so many factors.

We haven't been here in a while because we just haven't had time to go; however, we love the different types of sushi rolls they have. My seven-year-old daughter is a big fan of nigiri (esp. salmon and eel). We love ordering their nigiri because you can tell the freshness of the fish as well as the fish-to-rice ratio is on par too. There isn't too much rice that will throw off the balance of the taste of the nigiri. 

I love ordering their spicy garlic edamame, baked green mussel, bacon scallop skewer, miso soup, Sexy Lazy, Lasagna roll, and Sexy Bomb roll. If you've ever been to Sushi Kaya and love their Sex Bomb roll, order their Sexy Bomb. They are very comparable to each other!

My only complaint is that sometimes the service can be a little slow. They don't bring your food out all at once like most sushi places. I'd rather get everything and then order more, so that the my ""food tempo appetite"" doesn't slow down.",O8BcJ8S4JwHHZWnx3Asd1A,1,1,4,Ihe_2QdzZOyIflJWLAv5AA

Donde Papa is also another recommended one, this one is not on the spicy side but a blend of nice flavors in one roll. My experience here is so amazing I come here to eat once or twice a week.

Bad vibes from staff, most of the sushi was excessively thick with extra rice, waited a long time for orders, had to reorder a few items i already ordered that they wrote down but they didn't put the order in and then when i asked about those orders they said its being made but after more waiting they still didn't put order in, it was far from busy, 3 tables to serve (thats including me) and the sushi chef wasn't busy with other orders. 
Some of the sushi rolls had huge chunks of rice & and seemed to be skimpy on the fill of some of the rolls.
Definitely appeared to be shorting customers to save a dime.  I knocked off some of rice because it was a bit ridiculous on some of the rolls and was surprised by the pettiness of the manager to say she was going to charge me for it, it was only about a tbsp of rice.

Now let's talk about the food.  Fresh tasting, fast service, creative rolls.  Not to mention some really funny names for them.  Overall great sushi.  Our chefs name is Ryan and he deserves a raise, he was that good and friendly.  

All day my day was a bad one and after this, with my belly full, I am happy.   Well worth the experience.

So I decided after reading some other reviews to go again tonight to see if it was a fluke or not on my experience last night.  Nope I had the same great service and quality of sushi.

The reviews seemed ok and I live close so I thought it would be worth trying even though I have several sushi places I usually am willing to drive to.  This meal was a complete waste of money.  I have had bad sushi before but never where it was spoiled and unable to eat it.  I sent my Amaebi back to the Chef and not only did the staff not find some fresh shrimp to replace it with they didn't even mention it again.  I didn't ask for it to be replaced as I was so turned off from it I don't think I could have eaten it if they did give it to me. Several other types of fish they served was smelly and fishy but just starting to spoil and still edible but not enjoyable.  The rice on the sushi was warm and the fish tasted like it had been unthawed.  I inquired about the rice being so hot and the lady told me the health department makes them do that.  I eat a lot of sushi and nowhere else have I found rice like this.  My daughter had chicken teriyaki and they gave her very little chicken and it was completely dried out and overcooked.  Waitresses seem nice when you sit down then tend ignore you when you want to order more but I could live with that if the food was ok.  Complete waste of time and worst restaurant experience I have had in Vegas in over 20 years of living here.  This place will be out of business soon.  If you can't even eat or slightly enjoy a meal it doesn't even deserve a 0.  My wife enjoyed her desert a lot and said the coconut tempura shrimp was pretty good but thought her sushi was no good.
