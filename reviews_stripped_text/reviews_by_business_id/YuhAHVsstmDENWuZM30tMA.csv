They never seem to disappoint with the food, whether I eat there, pick it up, or with delivery.. which I've done all. Delivery was so nice since I didn't want to drive in the wind, and showed up faster then expected. My personal favorite is the chicken pad Thai, with a medium spice..but be warned they don't play when it comes to spice, just like I like it. My boyfriend like the Mongolian beef, plus those potstickers are bomb dignity. We tried the wonton soup since we're not felling then best and it was pretty damn good.

Their delivery was as stated online, about 45 minutes, but it came straight to my hotel door and was quick and easy. I also really enjoy non-fried spring rolls and this is where I felt they could have done better. The rolls were huge but basically just stuffed with lettuce. There were 2 shrimp in each roll (but placed towards the ends) thus the middle section was just lettuce. I only had one bite that had any cilantro so it had little flavor. The mass curry was good, although loaded with onions and had an expected amount of pork (you can choose which protein you want them to use - which is cool). I ordered it medium spicy and I was pleasantly surprised that it actually had a kick to it. If you are not a fan of spice then I would definitely order mild.",0Q33rXq-1idZ68VNBJCHdA,0,0,3,DvYF-ody7jBffMHqwxeV2A

As soon as I walk in I was greeted by a woman and she seated me right away. I was the only customer in there but then I noticed two gentlemen across the room eating as well. The woman was very polite and got my drink and food order right in. I had ordered beef pad Thai level 6 spice. I had ordered a soda and I drank the first glass pretty fast because come on, it's 100 degrees outside now so I was pretty thirsty haha! The woman saw my glass becoming empty and she refilled it right away. 

My pad Thai was brought out in short time and it was delicious. Portion was decent and I really enjoyed my lunch. What really made me want to do a review was because my drink was half empty and one of the gentlemen I saw eating across the room, looked over at me, got up and walked over to me and asked how everything was and if he can get me another refill. I was stunned. This man was on his lunch break probably and decided to do this nice gesture. And really I didn't mind waiting for the woman to come back later or anything. 

Customer service was excellent, I was checked up on more than enough, and food is delicious. I will definitely go back.",jXAUlTxzp27pOPaINXlc8w,0,0,5,ZX3mBIcwpUed7dP3mtOwrQ

I thought instantly about looking at reviews. I love Thai food so when I came upon the reviews for Thai Kitchen, it looked so tempting.  I took an Uber (5 min from airport) and looked over the menu again.  I instantly gravitated to the fried red snapper with an apple slaw over it.  The waitress attempted to tell me everything was family style.  I let her know that I was hungry and it would be no problem.  The host and hostess was so cordial. Always paying attention to what I might want or need.  Well, when the fish came, it took less than 10 min to demolish that.  The outside of fish was crunchy yet the inside so moist.  The apple slaw with its sweet, yet savory back end complemented it so well.  Everything was gone (except the head) and I let them know that the chef did an awesome job on the fish.

I ordered the Pad Kee Mao (as I do at every Thai restaurant) with chicken, and I asked for very spicy. They knocked it out of the park. The spice level was high but not inedible.

Ordered : 

Papaya salad with sticky rice and BBQ chicken. Could have used more salad, but it's hard to find a place that gives hefty portions. Chicken was a bit stiff but the sauce on it was great ! Sticky rice was amazing ! Would def get more sticky rice. 

Green curry with pork. Ordered level 7 Spice. They have 1-10 spice. Very spicy ! Loved it. They warned us it's spicier here than other Thai food. Be careful what spice # you order. :)

1886020,2018-01-08,0,YuhAHVsstmDENWuZM30tMA,"I judge Thai restaurants by two things: Thom Kha soup and curry.  Both of these are coconut milk based, and can reveal a lot about a place.  It's easy to cut corners and water down recipes to save a few bucks (coconut milk is pricey, after all).  The good places will have rich, strong flavors in a thick and creamy coconut base.  On the other side of the spectrum, you'll find watery soup and bland curry.  You may have different criteria if you like seafood, or certain specialty dishes... but these two things have always been a very good barometer for me.

I'm very pleased to say that I Am Thai Cuisine exceeded my expectations!

The soup was delicious with large slices of intense ginger, chunks of lemongrass, and whole kaffir lime leaves.  Even more importantly, they didn't skimp on the protein (chicken, in this case).

I also like to see how they handle custom orders, so I requested the yellow curry lunch special without potatoes.  The server offered to substitute other veggies like broccoli and carrots... it was a nice touch, and showed their flexibility and desire to please their customers.  The curry was delicious and full of flavor, just how it should be.

Speaking of service, that's a key component of any good restaurant, and the staff here is great.  Fast, attentive, and very friendly.

I don't usually make a beeline from the airport to a restaurant, but in this case, it's well deserved.  This is definitely my regular Thai spot in LV!",OJdCXrmCW_sjJDF5iUql2w,3,1,5,AdzE3MLStgseTEgZC-cmYw

The servers never refilled my water or checked in on me except once--when they brought me the wrong food.  The salad was iceberg with a generic honey mustard. The lunch menu states that you get soup, egg roll, and a salad with your entree, but when I ordered, I was asked soup OR salad. I had ordered a yellow curry, but it was too sweet for me to finish.  
I do give one star for the atmosphere, though. It is spacious and clean as are the restrooms.  The music is not too loud and the lighting is perfect--brightly lit for the dark wood atmosphere.  The other star is for the lunch price. It was $7.95.

2073253,2017-07-27,0,YuhAHVsstmDENWuZM30tMA,"My husband and I have found our thai restaurant of choice when visiting Las Vegas. We dined at I Am Thai twice in two days and loved everything that we tried. 

It was my dad's birthday and I was in search of a restaurant that could accommodate 24 people with one day notice. After contacting various restaurants, Joey of I Am Thai was the most responsive and helpful. He allowed us to create our own customized menus and provided exceptional pricing. We interacted via telephone call and text to make sure we were on the same page. I truly appreciate the time and help that was provided...

I Am Thai has your typical thai menu items; however, the authenticity and flavor of their dishes sets them aside. I'm talking about a whole other level. A few favorites are their crab fried rice, pineapple fried rice and pad thai.

Crab Fried Rice: 
This was my favorite dish. Unlike other restaurants that use imitation crab, I Am Thai stuffs their fried rice with real crab chunks. They are not greedy with their crab either; there is a good amount inside the dish. The price is very reasonable considering the size of the dish and the real crab that they use. Delicious!!

Pineapple Fried Rice: 
The presentation of this dish is already a plus. There is fried rice served inside of a full size pineapple (the remaining fried rice that didn't fit inside is served on side of pineapple). This fried rice was flavorful and sweet. It's like the juices of the pineapple penetrate into the fried rice. It's more on the sweeter end, but was a hit. You can definitely taste the pineapple flavor

Pad Thai:
Perfectly cooked pad thai! We tried with chicken and another time with shrimp. I Am Thai is not greedy with their protein...they provide a very generous amount of meat (or tofu) of choice. We ordered a spice level of 3 and it was perfect for my taste buds. The spice was more than mild, but still manageable to eat for me (I can't handle too much spice without my nose running and lips burning). 

Everyone enjoyed their meals and continued raving about the goodness of the crab and pineapple fried rice dishes (half favored the crab better and the other half favored the pineapple). Along with the excellent food, the customer service at I Am Thai is top notch. A+ all around...every employee that we interacted with was very pleasant and helpful! 

We'll be back for sure!! Thank you again Joey and I Am Thai for a memorable bday luncheon for my dad!!",c_tmM9PQnMDKPhO0-p4kIQ,2,1,5,thitHz07IZ3UGw9CZjfRug

Both the greeter and waitress were awesome!  Explaining to the waitress about the allergies, she wrote everything down so as to relay to the chef.  She made sure we all had plenty of water, with cold icy carafes on the table.

Our group ordered Veggie Pad Thai, Chicken Pad Thai, Veggie Fried rice, Veggie Lo Mein, Seafood Lo Mein, BBQ Chicken and rice, Mongolian Beef and Tom Kha.  EVERTHING was delicious.  Cooked perfectly. 

I had the Tom Kha and have to say it was so yummy. The flavors were right on spot. 

Shared at the end was a beautiful presentation of Mango Sticky Rice. Again - just right on spot and a perfect way to end the meal. 

This will be a go back to for Thai.  I haven't had Thai this good in 6 years.

Something to consider - this restaurant doesn't use Thai chili powder or paste - they use fresh Thai pepper - it's HOT.  So when the waitress says their 5 is a 10 at other restaurants - believe her.  They will bring fresh Thai chili to the table if you need.  I had a 4 and it was plenty.",ks-THNW260klKVtl4-BQVQ,1,0,5,YqC6RyR6uc7pdUmDlxllCQ

Parking was available as it is located in a small shopping center. It also helped that we went an hour before closing.

THE SERVICE: 2.5 stars. Tara who appeared to be the greeter was kind and welcoming. We were a large group of 15 so I know it wasn't easy to take orders from four families, however when we called before hand, they said they could accommodate our large party. The waitress who took our offer was by far RUDE!!! Was in a rush to take everyone's order, skipped over guest who weren't which enough to order, and at some point she dropped her order slips and had the audacity to  literally SNATCH them out from a family member's hand who was courteous enough to help pick them up. Her attitude didn't change until I mentioned OUT LOUD that she was being RUDE.  

It's sad, but service makes for half the dining experience and this place did not meet up to the courteous customer service expectations that a paying patron hopes for.

All the pictures looked amazing, so I felt more confident going here other than some other yelp experiences. And let me tell you....THIS PLACE DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!!

Here is my original review posted shortly after the restaurant first opened:

We love Thai food and are always looking for new places.  Saw this one on Yelp and gave it a try.  The food was quite excellent.  I had vegetable soup and red curry.  Both were very tasty.  Be forewarned, ""medium"" really means ""spicy.""  But really quite delicious.  My wife had Pad See Ewe (sp?) which she liked very much as well.  The service was also very good and the staff is quite friendly.  The prices are also very reasonable.  So, why not 5 stars? The elevator music was driving us nuts. It is pretty annoying.  The restaurant has only been open a few months so my hope is they'll fix it up a bit and maybe find some better music to play.",WuvSmp8UhNrPUFnB5gm-kg,1,0,5,CcCuRjhamN2-jKsCahLQsw

There weren't many other people in the restaurant but I'm guessing it's because it was so close to the holidays. For appetizers, we got the egg rolls and fried tofu. Both were really good and the presentation looked fancy. For my entree, I got the Spicy Eggplant and I chose a spice level of 3 since they said that's like an American 5. However, I didn't find it very spicy at all. In my opinion, it was closer to mild than actually spicy. They do give some chili sauce at the table though so I was able to add that. Next time, I'll request a higher number. 

While the food was delicious (I ate the entire thing), the service was spotty. For some reason, we had two waitresses and when everyone got their food, my uncle was still waiting for his. We were already about a quarter of the way through our meal when he still hadn't gotten his order. One of the other waitresses (who hadn't brought us our food) came by to ask how everything was and we told her my uncle hadn't received his order. She looked confused like she had no idea that this had even happened. She went back to the kitchen and about 2 minutes later returned with his dish. I'm not sure if someone forgot about it or if the other girl forgot to bring it out but it wasn't the greatest experience for us since we had come for a family dinner and only one person was left without his meal through the majority of it. 

Despite that, if you're looking for delicious Thai food in the area, this is a great place to go. All of us really enjoyed our meal and I would come back here.

The beef and chicken were very well prepared and served in a beautiful serving platter with a bowl of rice.  The curry was very well done with a slight burn on the lips.

If you check in, you get a free coke! No refills on Thai tea or Thai coffee.

The calamari was great presentation. There weren't a lot for something that was $7. It seemed to be over fried. It was okay. I wouldn't get it as the appetizer though.

So if you get the lunch special, it comes with soup and egg roll. It says it comes with salad but we never got it.

We got the pad Thai. It was good. I really liked it. It was the right amount of flavors and wasn't overpowering like other pad thais I've had. It's good with chicken.

The papaya salad was okay. It seemed to be missing something. 

The Thai sweet and sour is something I would not recommend. It doesn't taste good. It's more sour than it is sweet. I don't know if it was the pork or something else but it tasted funky.

The red curry was amazing. I really enjoyed it! If you get it with a 4 spiciness, it is enough for someone that doesnt like too much spice but good enough for someone who loves spice. The ingredients worked well together and it was the right amount. 

We had spicy basil. It was good. It wasn't the best I have to admit but it was good. There wasn't a lot of basil flavor and I think that's what made it just good. 

I would definitely recommend this place.",9k2et25tG8kSj9Q3hqj9xA,2,0,5,OOZwx3_4u1px6io-8znb1w

I went here with a coworker. I was excited there was a lunch menu but bummed it was pretty limited. I was in the mood for seafood, so I ordered a squid salad off the regular menu. I asked for no spicy sauce and the waiter asked me if I wanted the dish spicy (didn't I just say no sauce?). When the entree came it was still covered in sauce (a tad spicy) and the squid was super tough. I could barely eat it but I didn't really feel like sending it back since I was short on time. I should have known better than to order it when it was the only squid entree on the menu.

Coworker got the chicken and broccoli and he described it as tasting like an ""expensive TV dinner"".  

Also they charge .50 for a credit card transaction and they require it be at least $15. Yikes.

We ordered the shrimp rolls, two lunch specials and a coconut mango sticky rice for dessert.

Each lunch special comes with a soup (egg drop) or salad, along with rice and egg roll. Each special was $7.95. $1 more for shrimp. You are asked how spicy you would like your dish, on a scale from 1 to 10. I got 3 and my boyfriend got 5. He was sweating while he ate his red curry.

The food was good. The shrimp rolls were not over cooked or chewy. They came with a sweet chili sauce. Both lunch specials were about the size you'd expect, not too much but just enough. A great deal for under $10.  I wish they had served a Thai soup instead of eggs drop.

A note.. I did not see their health score posted. Perhaps I didn't look hard enough.

If you're returning your rental car to LAS, this is the place to be. It's literally right across the street from the rental car center AND next to the gas station. So fill her up and them fill yourself up before heading out on your flight. 

You wouldn't expect this quality and authenticity in this location. It's just a pretty dead strip mall, but I Am Thai is clearly located in the corner of the lot. You're greeted by a huge set of double wooden doors. Once you walk in, it's huge inside and super spacious. I love that the tables aren't slammed right next to each other and there's enough person space between you and the next table. 

The staff was super friendly, especially on Christmas Eve! The menu was extensive and they had a good amount of pictures there too. You can tell that this place was legit and the staff spoke Thai as well. There are specials but we opted for the classic pineapple fried rice and pad see ew. 

Luckily for us, this fried rice didn't have raisins in it! It came packed into a pineapple with a great flavor and decent amount of shrimp, and the rice that didn't fit, it came on another plate. The pad see ew was super delicious! Noodles were soft and not hard, jump packed with flavor and a good portion of protein!  

Two entrees was a lot of food even to share, and I eat a lot! Oh, best part, when do you a Yelp checkin, you get a free Thai iced tea and that portion was huge for a free drink! In fact, they even tell you that your thai tea is free if you check in on Yelp!

So here I am, my scary movie selected from red box, my bottle of red wine, and my Thai food in its signature and ever so elegant stryofoam box... ready for my evening of selfishness and excess! 

They say they are spicier than most places and they are right! Normally I get a 7 and it isn't spicy enough but this time at I Am Thai it is perfect. I love when things work out and when employees are honest (with a white girl no less) about spice level. They didn't look at me and say ""7 is too spicy. Well give you a 4"" Which has happened to me SO many times. Here, they were honest AND they gave me what I wanted.

Right upon entry, the service was very welcoming and genuine. My friend & I opted for lunch combos. I got the red curry and she got paid thai. The lunch portions are pretty generous for the low cost! Great for a student on a budget like me lol.

My friend enjoyed her dish very much. Seemed like your typical pad thai dish. 
My red curry was tasty as well and had lots of veggies. However, I was kind of bummed because I tried to order a spice level 8 & the server would not let me. He said some people in the last week had sent back 4's and 5's for being too hot. I thought to myself ""wow, they must make their food really spicy here."" So I settled for a 6 as he suggested, and it was not spicy at all -__- I had to dump in several spoons of chili paste to get any sort of kick.

I chose this place because it had very good reviews and it certainly did not disappoint. Not only was the food very delicious, but what made it so great was the extremely friendly staff. It was a true pleasure to eat there because they were so nice. It was seven of us so we ordered a good amount of food. The waitress was very nice and honest when we asked if what we ordered was enough food. It wasn't an insane amount of food for seven but I thought it was just right. The portions are quite large so even though we did not order seven full entrees, it was enough. We ordered two small soups, tom yum shrimp and tom kha chicken. We also got papaya salad and thai dumplings as appetizers. For our main meal we got tofu pad thai (a choice of fried or steam tofu-I chose fried), chicken pad thai, pineapple fried rice (which is served in a pineapple!), and massaman curry with shrimp. For dessert we got fried banana with coconut ice cream. Everything was very very very delicious (see pictures for large portions and beautiful plating!)

Arrived 15 minutes after placing order. After checking in with the hostess/server, she said the food was almost ready and to have a seat. I was surprised that the food wasn't ready because I didn't order anything that typically takes a long time to prepare. Another 10 minutes of waiting and I received our food. There was only one table in the restaurant so I think they didn't start the order until I arrived. 

It was empty but the dining room looked clean and nice, I thought if the food is good, we'll come back and dine in. 

The food was very disappointing as well. 
I'm a larb connoisseur, I order it at every Thai place we try. Unfortunately this was one of the worst ones I've had. It was way too sweet and did not have enough lime or citrus to make it a little sour and tangy the way it's normally prepared. The cabbage pieces were cut so thinly that you can't use them as a lettuce wrap but the pieces were too big for one bite. Awkward size. The larb was also prepared warm and I prefer cold or room temp but that's just my personal preference. 

The steamed veggies were fine.

The basil fried rice with beef was also fine. The beef was tender and tasty. The green beans were crisp but the rice was over cooked and mushy. 

The pad kee mao was forgettable and the noodles were overcooked.

I've had the two noodle dishes at other places before and while I know that they're not supposed to be super saucy I do expect a light coating of sauce on the noodles. These were bone dry. When we got there to pick up our order was ready except for the panang curry so maybe while they waited for that the noodles got dry.

The ambiance was nice and the service was very good. The food was good, not excellent. We had Crispy Fish with Curry, that was good and curry very flavorful. Had the Tom Gak Coconut soup, a bit salty, however flavorful with fresh mushrooms. I had the drunken noodles, which they call Pad Kee Mou, very different from what I've had before but good.

5504354,2018-04-08,1,YuhAHVsstmDENWuZM30tMA,"To me, this place does not live up to its rating. I've been here twice, months apart and unfortunately it was the same experience,  nothing special.  The only reason we stopped by again? Because we were in the area, looking for Thai and I had bookmarked this place, but forgot we'd already been and remembered as soon as we pulled up, the prior experience. We were too hungry to go somewhere else so we tried it again.

Both times we came after a lunch rush, about 1p. And both times, the restaurant was clearing out, but we had to wait for a table to be cleaned. I can't imagine what it would be like during the actual lunch rush because ALL the tables still had dirty dishes on them for a good  while. And a table only got cleaned when new customers came in. Nobody was manning the front desk this time, so a couple actually walked out tired of waiting to be seated? There were 2 servers/waitresses and 1 cook who kept coming out of the kitchen. I made a comment to our server that they must've been busy, and she said they were short one because they called in sick. Hmm was that the same reason last time too? The tables did eventually get cleared  

Now for the food. I don't think this was authentic thai. The flavors of the lime, basil, fish sauce, palm sugar, Thai pepper, basil were not there at all. We've tried the Thai egg rolls, papaya salad, larb,  tofu basil , the basic dishes and I was not a fan, there are far better Thai restaurants around, sadly this isn't one of them.

Extra star for effort on our server who was very pleasant.",RlM6cIrCoRgi_nYXMBpa6Q,1,1,2,P-nRloTJ3NOK44ndvZJ1zg

Ultimate favorite is their glass noodle dish (sorry I don't know the Thai name) but it is fantastic!  Flavorful and fresh (though not sure if it's healthy- who cares?).  Their Panang beef is superb as well (another favorite).

I once ordered 6 dishes from here (phad Thai, assorted fried rice, basil chicken and I can't remember what else).  Everything was great.  Be careful though..mild spicy is actually medium to hot spicy...so don't be a hero!",JCtr9wtNRefrjyA3IQV3xA,0,0,5,KhrtgvuzQg2KKAXJBwP2lA

The interior seemed a lot bigger than the dining area, but it was a clean and well set up. My lady and I had the duck curry, a soup that I do not recall the name of and a pork noodle dish. The food was delicious. We had no problems with any of it. my first time with duck was a great one. We did run into the standard problem every Asian restaurant is that they never give you enough rice. And given how cheap and easy it is to make, you would think that  Asian restaurants would pass out rice like Mexican restaurants pass out tortilla chips.
So the food was good and the prices were good too. I think we each payed $15 between the two of us for the meal.

They aren't joking. At other Thai places I can eat a 7 or 8 no problem here I get like a 4 or 5. But the spice is great tasting and isn't just hot with no flavor. Eat here.

Papaya salad - delicious, pad thai - the right balance, not to sweet or saucy just right, pad see ew - simple great, spicy bail chicken is ridiculously good, tom yum fried rice is one of those special dishes that you have to really question if fried rice can really be so good..

Came here after a quick visit to the outlets. Looking for something to eat near by, my best friend and decided to come here after seeing the reviews. 

First off, it's located in a shady strip mall that looks abandon. Outside and inside interior needs a big makeover. Walked in, got seated and was legged waiting for over 15 minutes without anyone coming to check on us. Not even water. It wasn't even busy either. 

We were so hungry and after no one approaching us after a long wait we walked out... they didn't even see us leave since they were busy doing other things.

You could say the reason we got such great service was because we were the only patrons but I don't believe that to be true.   You could tell the servers were kind and caring.   They answered all questions with patience, they never once made us feel rushed and they made sure our drinks were full. 

On top of that I would say that this is one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to in a while when judging price to taste.   The food was fresh (I always judge the shrimp! ) and very flavorful.   And the value was spot on.   We spent less than $40 on 4 very filling dishes.

How can you ruin Thai food? I don't understand it. I can make it better.
The price was high too. My dish was almost $13.00. The same dish at another Thai place l love is $6.95 lunch, $8.95 dinner. My co-workers was $15.00 for herself.

And, seing as I worked in a Thai restaurant where everything was prepared authentically by a 70 year old Thai woman - it's pretty hard to impress me. 

The service was the first thing that stood out. All the waitresses were very attentive, had a great sense of humor, and never left a dirty dish nor empty glass on the table the entire time we dined. 

The food was amazing. We had the beef jerky and papaya salad for starters. Then we had entrees. I had shrimp red curry, my husband had Thai style BBQ, and my daughters had shrimp tempura, vegetarian red curry, and shrimp fried rice. We hadn't eaten all day, so this was the perfect amount of food for all of us with a little bit of leftovers. I was greatly imprssed overall, but I have to say that the red curry typically makes or breaks my love for a Thai restaurant, and it was nothing short of perfection here. Yay! 

Another bonus, the check was written in Thai. When we asked why, we were told it was so all the cooks could understand the orders (as they didn't read English). It's no wonder everything was amazing, it was authentically prepared. We look forward to coming back again very soon!!",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,6,1,5,WlH66sgam8Vmoak0l3Rn2Q
