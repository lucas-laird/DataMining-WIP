384656,2011-02-23,0,OJdufUU3hVabgviIBHksYw,"My Roomie Nicki G. was out & about for lunch on Valentines day, looking for a new Hawaiian BBQ place, since the one closest to us had changed their menu to all Chinese. 

Needless to say, I had looked to the Yelpeeps for some answers & started searching & reading countless reviews. So, I mentioned this place to her & showed her the menu. It all looked pretty good & some of the reviews seemed very promising. Unfortunately, that is as far as it went. She brought back a Kalbi combo for me, which included Chicken Katsu & Teri Chicken. 

I was super hungry & I was looking forward to digging in. However, I have to say I wasn't very impressed with the portions, especially the mac salad, which was in like really small cup. Not to mention the fact that is kind of had an odd taste to it, kind of like the way a Dentist's office smells. To me, this plate seemed like a mini plate & not like a regular. The 2 scoops of rice equaled about the size of 1 scoop you would find in a regular. 

As far as taste goes, it was mediocre at best. Not very flavorful as far as the marinade went. The Kalbi was a little on the small side, as well as the Katsu & Teri Chicken. I didn't end up eating all of the Katsu, it just didn't seem like it was prepared very well. I don't know, maybe got spoiled living in Hawaii & just have high expectations. 

Overall, based on this experience, I don't think I would return or even recommend this place. If anyone cares to compare, take a look at my L&L review & look at those pics of my plate lunch in comparison the pics I am posting for this review. 

Just a side note: To me, mac salad is kind of like salsa. It is a very simple thing to make & even make it taste pretty good. However, a lot of places find some way to mess it up. I have been to many a good Mexican restaurant, but somehow the salsa is always bad. I don't know though, what can do? :P",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,0,0,2,tPD4VZKVtrWWUMP7k2-gYw

There was a long line with two working registers, but only one person working both. It was pretty sketchy because one register was only excepting cash and the other one only credit cards. It caused such an inconvenience and their system was very inconsistent. They had one other person behind the counter expediting and running out the orders. I ordered the local plate and the ahi poke. My friend had the kalbi and lumpia. This is the culmination of my very disappointing lunch: carbs doused is sugar with a side of protein. Everything was just so sweet. I am all about the balance between sweet and salty but damn what a shame! It was all too sweet for my liking. AND the poke! FROZEN in the center! It was just big cubes of frozen fish. Tuna is a beautiful protein and should never be frozen, any seafood in that matter. When I told them about it, they sent it to the kitchen and when it got back to me the plate was warm. They popped fish that was meant to be served fresh in the microwave. WHAT A SHAME! My friend's kalbi was too sweet as well. Good char but too much sugar. The lumpia was mediocre. I didn't care much for it. Also, the place was very dirty. It looked so unorganized and dusty behind the counter.

After viewing the menu board I noticed SO MANY local favorites and didnt know where to start so I ordered the pork adobo plate with mac salad. I thought it was decent because my preference is to have it a little drier/crispier rather than a lot of sauce - though it was tasty. The BBQ plate my friend ordered looked pretty good too!

I would recommend this place because Im sure there are some delicious winners on the menu - I just didnt hit it on my first visit. Again, lots of local choices on the menu, very impressed!

The lady with her bun on too tight who is always behind the counter has always been very short with me. I look the other way because it's decent food, convenient to my home, and open late. But this time Ms. Tight Bun took it too far. She was rude about answering my friends' questions about the menu while we were ordering. Snapped at us twice and never did answer our question about what was in the soup. There were 4 people at the table and they brought 3 meals out. We waited. Then my friend said what he was eating was not what he ordered. He took the plate up to the counter and I asked him to ask about mine too because my food hadn't come. She told my friend he was eating my food and she would get his. The food he had that he had already started eating wasn't what I ordered either. So I took it back up to the counter. She argued with me about what I ordered, slammed the plate down, and said ""you'll just have to wait."" It was an average night. She wasn't especially busy but it took 30 minutes to get our food we were snapped at while we ordered and then it was wrong and got to deal with her attitude. I really like this place normally but tonight two out of four people left hungry and angry. I'm afraid I won't be able to go back without checking to see how tight her bun is on that day.

952341,2006-08-08,0,OJdufUU3hVabgviIBHksYw,"The Aloha Kitchen we went to was on South Decatur Boulevard. They have another location on South Maryland Parkway that caters to the locals and UNLV students alike and I hear they have another one on Lamb Boulevard. Rumor also has it that these three locations are somehow affiliated with the Aloha Specialties store that we all know and love, located in the Cal in downtown, but that has been unconfirmed. Decorated with an almost over-the-top, stereotypical Hawaiiana theme (grass roofing, bamboo poles, brightly painted seating), the restaurant at least gave a certain sense of warmth and Hawaii feel.

But nevah mine all of that. Let's get to the food! I wasn't all too hungry myself, since I had landed not more than a few hours prior, so I ended up just going for the burger and fries combo. I wasn't expecting much because I'm not much of a burger eater to begin with. Well, to my surprise, the cooks at Aloha Kitchen did good with this one. Really good. In fact, I would even go out on the limb and say that this was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life. And believe me, I'm getting up there... this life is not a short one anymore.  There was just something about this burger that made it ohhhh so tasty. The saltiness, the butteriness, the sesame-seed bunliness... YUM! If you go to Aloha Kitchen, you just gotta try this one.

Meanwhile, there's a fast-food beverage dispenser for your sodas, waters, and tea in the corner. The LCD displays for the menu is cool.

It's like, ""hey Anh, we like you and all but we're like a Roberto's that you get stuff yourself, but hey we'll deliver your food right to your table. Don't expect us to see you again to check on you."" It's funny to me. It's a clean fast food restaurant, but with a ""pick up your food and GTFO or here, please sit down in these nice chairs."" Think Teriyaki Madness but it's small-business owned.  

We ordered for two Loco mocos. What better way to cure a hangover by 3PM right? 
Loco moco missed the mark. Nothing to write home about. Like if I was in Vegas and you lived in San Diego as my facebook friend, I wouldn't be all, ""DUDE. You have to try out this loco moco."" Super plain. Not very well-seasoned. As soon as my knife sliced into it, the yolk was hard (barely runny at all). I want to see that over-easy egg's guts all over my rice. I felt cheated! Hamburger patty was too tough, which made it chewy than it should be. Not quite flavorful. 

I left feeling dissatisfied. Not hungry, just sad. Maybe I just wanted the rich heart-attack-inducing feel of a loco moco. The mac salad it came with was alright.

I like how clean this place is. Really nice tables and chairs. I like the separate water dispenser from the soda machine. A nice take-out place sort of feel. Prices were about right for what it was.

It was a little hard to find, but once we found the place, we were golden. We came around 11 am and there were only a few people in there. It was probably because everyone was still sleeping! Haha. 

The staff is friendly and the decor is perfect for a Hawaiian place. And the food, the food is BOMB. I ordered the adobo friend rice omelet and my friend ordered the spam and eggs. We all loved what we ordered! The adobo fried rice omelet was so so good. The rice was a little crunchy like fried rice is supposed to be and the adobo had a little crunch to it too. Just like my Lola makes it. Except it was wrapped in an omelet! Instead of the egg being in the rice like normal adobo fried rice, it was wrapped in it. Genius! Haha.

Anyway, I would definitely come back to this place and order the omelet again. It was that good!",-HudJfGj2P2y9SkuNxv-RQ,5,4,4,oWJmyLtpAPH8o5sQ-JQRaA

Opted for the Local's Plate (beef and chicken teriyaki, two musubi, sides of rice and mac salad) plus a lumpia app. I'm not the hugest fan of teriyaki and this was not one I would necessarily come back for, spam on musubi was thinner and less flavorful than what I've had at L&L, I preferred the lumpia I've had at actual Filipino places, and I'm generally not a fan of mac salad in the first place because of my aversion to mayo.
The dishes weren't bad, they were just a little lacking in flavor and not the punch of flavor I'd expected.

1928252,2008-10-31,3,OJdufUU3hVabgviIBHksYw,"So ""Aloha"" means both hello and goodbye -- now how can I work that into my review?

Here goes:

To begin with it, I've never seen a combination bar and Hawaiian fast food place.

Aloha (Hello) Kitchen reminds me of a typical Hawaiian fast food place: well lit with a lot of cheesy decor.
Besides having the basic plates, they also carried some unique stuff. I tried the Adobo Fried Rice and the wife tried the Saimin soup.  The food wasn't really anything to yelp about, but since it is a chain kinda place, you shouldn't expectation too much.
I'd be willing to go back just because they serve poke (one of the items I don't find at a fast food place) on Friday and Saturday.
So until then, Aloha (Goodbye) Kitchen.

Aloha (Hello) Bar is right next door to the Kitchen but is a 180 from the Kitchen: dark with a dive feel to it.  But it still gave off the laid back Island life vibe.
Bartender was cool and even spoke to me in dakine.  Thanks.
She stopped though when my face went blank and didn't respond.  Sorry.
The music had the kinda beats I could groove to for a couple hours, and the crowd was chill.
After a some drinks and a couple games of pool, I was saying Aloha (Goodbye) Bar.  Good thing since they just fired up the karaoke machine.

Overall, I'll be saying Aloha (Hello) sooner to the Bar than the Kitchen.

A special aloha to all the Vegas Yelpers from Hawaii.

Oxtail soup is always the right food for late night grindz! The taste is good, but I think it would be better if they had peanuts and Chinese parsley in the soup, like what I'm used to having in my oxtail soup. We had an order of lumpia shanghai too. That also was good.

I went to fill our cups and the beverage dispenser seemed to be broken...not out of something, but actually broken. It sprayed me with fruit punch which seemed to set the tone for our meal. 

When I got in the bathroom to wash my hands, the bleach smell was overpowering. It was so strong it made my eyes water, and even though I knew bleach had been used, it felt really grimy. Of course there were no paper towels. 

When our order finally came out, the lumpia were nice and hot and crispy. They were the high point of the meal. The beef bowl was smothered in sauce, it didn't taste like any teriyaki sauce I've ever had..almost like a burned gravy. It was disappointing because the beef itself had a good texture, no gristle or fatty globs. 

My husband's chicken was really unappetizing - it honestly looked like a slab of meat from a frozen dinner and he said it was rubbery. He described his beef as being ""well done and then some."" Not a fan.

Short Version:
The new decor is nice. The doorman and waitress were nice. The KJ and bartender are rude. KJ not aware of standard queue protocols and what songs are in the library. The bartender would rather argue about a drink and try to intimidate a customer than own his mistakes. The upside is that the staff should turn over in a few months (if their trend keeps up). Maybe we'll try again then. Toilet handle broken. Bathroom dirty. 

Long version:
This used to be a fun karaoke place. Their main host has changed, and they have struggled to find a replacement. Everyone in here was new the last time that we went, which isn't too surprising because it seemed every few months there was a different team there. 

The customer service is horrible. I asked for a Black Label with a splash of soda and was given Black Label and tonic. I walked to the bar and let the waitress know as she is swamped and has the entire room. She apologized and let the bartender know. He comes to me and says, ""I put soda in there."" Then he holds up the store brand bottle they got at a grocery store and shakes it in my face. I told him, ""If you're not convinced, taste the drink. It's tonic and not what I ordered."" He stares and me. I don't blink. He grabs the glass and throws it in the sink and says, ""Fine."" Then he gets a cup and brings the soda bottle and says, ""This says soda."" He pours it in a cup and asked me to taste it. I tell him that it is soda. He then says, ""Good. I don't want to waste this stuff (holding the Scotch bottle). It's not cheap."" He proceeds to make me a scotch and soda, which isn't what I ordered. I just didn't care anymore. 

I sit down in the booth. The host comes to me and says, ""We don't have this song."" I tell her, ""Yes, you do. I've sang it here before."" She comes back and tells me that she found it. When it's finally my fiancé's turn, she plays the wrong song. He tries to help her find the right one because he has sang it there before. Finally, he tells her that he'll give her a different song, so she bumps him to the bottom of the queue! How? This is your mistake, and he gets punished for your incompetence. After 7 songs, I get up to ask when he is going. She says, ""Soon enough."" I told her, ""I needed a specific number of turns because you put him at the bottom for your mistake."" She glared at me and said, ""Three."" I told her, ""Thank you.""

2557859,2012-09-05,2,OJdufUU3hVabgviIBHksYw,"Last week - I dropped by the Aloha Kitchen and Bar for lunch. Had high hopes that this would be a location that would come close to being like the food I love and miss when I'm back home on the islands. However - I've learned to live with disappointment in life and my visit here was just another added to that list. 

The dining area is nice - somewhat clean, open and modern(ish) compared to other ""local"" style restaurants I've been to. The names of the dishes were promising and the prices seemed in line with the portion sizes I had seen on people's tables as I waited to place my order. 

I was coming down with a cold so I wanted saimin - even with it being in the 90's and humid which they don't serve. A Hawaiian style restaurant that doesn't serve saimin - odd. Even fast food joints in Hawaii serve saimin.  At least they serve fried saimin. So, I settled for that. 

Too much vegetables which normally isn't a bad thing however, after a few bites, I started to separate the cabbage and celery. Sorted thru and picked out the minced meat and noodles and with the leftover vegetables, it looked like I hadn't made a dent in the plate. I also chose a side of macaroni salad. Ugh. 

All I'm going to say is that I have to wonder if the cooks have ever been to the islands. Either that or the cooks have started tayloring their dishes to the tastes of people who haven't been either. Or maybe, I didn't choose the right dishes that they specialize in ... whatever the case, I didn't like what I ordered and I doubt I'll be back any time soon.",I2qJvA0tbGdZJ3XrwzwfzA,3,2,2,8desV0SEu2Vd-31LQ3h1MQ

2591091,2013-11-20,1,OJdufUU3hVabgviIBHksYw,"My review will strictly be on what I ordered:

Kalbi - These were just ok.  The marinade was nothing special... pretty much what I expected which was overly sweet with not much of a complexity of flavoring agents.  The meat itself was probably the thinnest cut of short ribs I have ever seen.  Even L&L serves up a thicker slab.

Katsu - This was actually pretty good.  Tender and juicy interior with a super crispy and light exterior.  Unfortunately I was not diggin' the dipping sauce.. it just tasted like hoisin mixed with oyster sauce.

Chicken Teriyaki - The teriyaki sauce is horrible.  It was thickened with so much cornstarch that it didn't have much flavor.  

Adobo Omelette -  Don't know what everyone is raving about.  Imagine leftover adobo that mom made from the night before, which was fried with some leftover rice the next morning, then wrapped in a blanket of the flattest scrambled eggs I have ever sunken my teeth into.  I mean don't get me wrong, it definitely has that ""homemade"" and ""comfort food"" spot we all have, but please do not go out of your way just to make this purchase.

Mac Salad - Typical island mac.. peppery, sweet, & mayo-y.

Rice - Super sticky to the point where the rice balls on my plate were a congealed mass of mush.

Spam Musubi - Well, you can't mess up spam, but you can mess up the complimenting sauce and well, the sauce that was slathered between the spam and the rice did the spam musubi no justice.

OVERALL:  Not worth another penny from my wallet.  Maybe it would've been better if it were drunk food.  Also, the people that work here weren't very friendly.  Not one person had a smile on their face.

2595396,2014-06-19,2,OJdufUU3hVabgviIBHksYw,"Open until 3am, so it's a top choice for late night Hawaiian Filipino fusion. Just make sure to get there before 2:30am, that's when the kitchen closes. 

We ordered the Loco moco $6.29, which was classically prepared: hamburger patty topped with a thick gravy and a fried egg all over rice. The hamburger meat was dry and the gravy was lacking much flavor. My boyfriend loves loco moco, but he wasn't happy with this version. I've came to the conclusion that I'm just not a fan of loco moco in general. I suppose I've just never had one that blew my tastebuds away. It's typically pretty bland with no real explosion or layers of flavor. I also can't get past the weird cornstarch gravy consistency. 2/5

The chicken katsu plate $7.69, came with a generous portion of fried chicken with 2 scoops of rice, one scoop of macaroni salad and a side of katsu sauce. The chicken was super crispy and fried to a dark golden brown (no it didn't taste burned), it was actually pretty moist inside. I've had better katsu sauce, but it wasn't bad - it was simple and does the job. Other than that, I didn't have any real complaints with this dish. A great price for what you get. Just make sure you're prepared for the food coma afterwards, it settles like a brick in your stomach. 4/5

The mac salad was simple, (just tatsted like mayo) but I enjoyed it. It went perfectly with the katsu plate. I ended up ordering an additional side for $1.99. The perfect bite: dip chicken katsu into katsu sauce, take a bite with rice and some mac salad all together... Perfect! 4/5

The spam musubi $1.99, was about the length of a dollar bill and had a thin slice of spam (didn't even fill the length of the musubi), some sweet gravy-like-sauce, and a brick of rice held together by seaweed. There was a ton of rice, but I ate it carefully making sure that each bite actually got some spam and sauce in, and it was pretty good. 3/5",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,2,2,3,yhNI5aWrU71dwJO85ew7zA

I wasn't crazy about the Mac salad, which was disappointing because a good Mac salad is a great compliment to an excellent local plate.  There was some kind of funny after taste to it.  Perhaps it was a bad batch of mayo or something but hopefully next time I dine there, they can rectify that.  Also was disappointed that although they had Pepsi products, they did not carry Mountain Dew, my vice, lol.

They screwed up on delivery one day.
I called them on missing food item.
They promised me a credit for that particular item and will honor it the next time I order.
Well, when I ordered the next time for delivery, I mentioned the credit I have and wanted to use it towards my order.  They still insisted I need to order minimum of $10 for delivery.  What ever happened to my credit?
I guess I got screwed out of my money.
All you people out there ordering for delivery, make sure everything is in your bag before paying the money.  Don't use credit card for payment.  Because if they screw up of your order, it is too late.  They got your money and will end up like me.
And I hope you speak Pilipino, because the delivery person doesn't speak a word of English only Pilipino. Therefore, good luck communicating with delivery person if they screw up on your order.

Caution: the omelet is pretty overwhelming 3/4 of the way through. If you've never had it or seen it before, do not be fooled by the name of it if you were to assume it be the size of a standard size omelet. It's the size of a newborn wrapped in an egg.

As I walk past the motorcycles, they're big bikes but they're Yamahas and Hondas and not Harleys.  So I can calm down.  We get in and meet the rest of our party from HI.

So we're trying to figure out what we're going to do. So one of the girls texts her girlfriend and says Aloha Kitchen has Karaoke on Saturday night. This workout great as one of our party members was from Oregon and she wanted Hawaiian-style food anyway. 

Because we got to Aloha Kitchen a little late, all the booths for big parties were already taken. But the night of fun had already begun without us.

And I totally forgot that Aloha Kitchen's kitchen is open 24-hours. So we did it up HI style; ordered a couple of plates of fried noodles, manapuas, spam musubis, french fries, drinks and a couple of songs to sing.

I like mine with a little gravy outside and in and egg yolk inside with hot sauce. I've been hooked on the  cut short ribs I can only seem to find back in Oceanside, CA at Guahan Grill, but their Kalbi short ribs are good too. The white rice on all their plates is good and consistent. The service could be better, but not indicative of rating. The cashier can get bogged down and the napkins are small and they never give enough. I need to come here in the winter as they have oxtail soup which is hard to find. Here is what a lot of people don't think about or know is that there is no hard breakfast or time to eat breakfast in the islands or in Vegas so getting their food at 3 because you didn't get to sleep until 9 am from partying all night long is not a shame, but probably the norm.",864nL0po2ldN8TPgbSiwOQ,0,0,4,wsBXPqaS9h8ZVp2BY_fuYw

The macadamia nut sauce is truly the star though. They actually ran out of macadamia nuts so that was already missing from the dish, didn't make a fuss about it. But these are pancakes and you know when they are burnt so they tucked the burnt ones under the one that wasn't.

The guest I brought got their food and ate their food before I even got mine.  My friends adobo fried rice omelette was made spicy and never got sides.  I finally walked up to cashier and started pointing out that other parties got their food.  They still insisted mine was next.  Then I asked about the mac salad and spam musubis they still owed us.  How hard is it to scoop mac salad?  Funny thing is they had several mac salads on counter, none were mine.  Finally after 40+ minutes my food came, ox tail ramen and spam musubis... ramen noodles were hard, couldnt eat, had 4 pieces of ox tail only 1 had a good amount of meat.  Since I was last person to get my food, my guest were done eating... so I ate the ox tail, 1 musubi and didn't take the rest of ramen home.

I must say I truly enjoyed the happy hour at Aloha Kitchen & Bar.  First of all the drinks are nice and strong and cheap (even past happy hour).  The atmosphere is comfy cozy - just what I like.  At that nice early hour of the evening we had our pick of seating.  There are comfy couches as well.  You have to go and get your drink for the most part - but who cares?  The bar tender sometimes doubled as the karaoke technician - again who cares?  When I was ready for my Patron shot - he was there to pour it.  That's all that mattered.  Everyone here was very accommodating to our mildly-wild group.  There are plenty of karaoke books and selection - even rap if you wanna get jiggy with it - and the dance floor is spacious as well.  I like the outside smoking area that is gated in a bit but you still can sit there with your drink and your smoke and not miss a beat to the party.

Now the food!  Yum!!  That's right.  Yum!!! I had the Adobe Fried Rice Omelet, my daughter had the Teriyaki combo.  They were both phenomenal.  That Adobe Fried Rice is compact and delicious and full of goodness.  Check out the pics on Yelp!  It is the perfect meal after an evening of drinking!  Protein, carbs, meats - what's not to love?  I got it to go at the end of the evening and my intent was to save it for lunch at work the next day.  That poor yummy specimen barely made it to the next light!  

This is a nice chill place, very nice prices and fun atmosphere on both sides.  There is a door that separates the restaurant from the bar side.  And remember the bar is non-smoking so you have to go outside in the sitting area to do that.  You will have a good time!",g_cpzvSOFcJkDj4liJUyVw,1,0,4,JvbI4U7oHwFXaIzKKW-xgg

I walked up to the order station. A menu with price listing was on a board above the order & cashier station. I ordered ""Saimin Soup"" , ""Combination Bowl with Vegetables"" and ""Coconut Juice"". I paid and was given a number tile with the number ""15"", to be called out for me to pick up my food order when it is ready. I chose to sit on a table under a ""tiki"" canopy overlooking the restaurant's wall of windows which brings in the day's sun. Nice, feeling like in the South Seas with colorful painting on its wall to add to the feeling.

Food was served on my table. My number was not called out. Great service!! Hot, steamy, yummy ""Saimin Soup"" was just right for my taste. I ordered it because I like soup and it had noodles. As it is my birthday, the long noodles stands for ""long life"". Mmmm, goood. The ""Combination Bowl with Vegetables"" was not ordinary with a special brown sauce over steamy white rice in a bowl. My Mom liked that, it was tasty. Our thirst was quenched by Coconut Juice on ice. Healthy and goood drink! 

The atmosphere is ambient in this Hawaiian & Filipino Restaurant serving both Hawaiian & Filipino favorites such as Pork Adobo, Kalua Pig & Cabbage served with macaroni salad & rice, Loco Moco, Chicken Curry, Hula/Hawaiian Plate, Tapsilog, Bento Box (of beef, teriyaki chicken, spam with pickled plum & furikake fish flakes), Kalbi Ribs, Mahi-Mahi dish, Lumpia Shanghai (my favorite) to name a few. Appetizers, Soups, Salads, Side Orders, Combination Plates, Specials, Sandwiches, Beverages, Breakfast & a Kids Meals are on the menu. One thing missing on the menu is Dessert.

Service has always been excellent, coming from the many faces I see come and go behind that counter, with the employees pretty much knowing my order as soon as I walk in. They also would deliver promptly whenever I would order for delivery. I've tried nearly everything on the menu, but the dish I ALWAYS order is the Local Plate. Which could very well be their signature dish since it's one of the most common items ordered from the menu. 

Everything from the macaroni salad, to the spam musubi is top notch...whenever it's cooked properly. You see, Over the past 8 or so years I've been coming here, the food has mostly been superb. But it's not very consistent. There have been quiet a few times where the Rice is either soggy or hard. Or the beef is too dry. It's a shame since whenever they do it right, it's FANTASTIC. But the few times they get it wrong, it's downright horrid. I can understand that not every single meal can be cooked perfectly, but the slip ups happen a bit too often. 

They do a good job of keeping the place clean too. It's visually appealing as well. There hasn't been a time where I was disgusted with the interior or even exterior of the restaurant. They also have a karaoke bar connected to the dining area, which is separated by its own set of doors.

This place will always be one of my favorite restaurants. Especially since the service is always excellent and the place is clean and eye catching.

This review is all about one item which has become legendary amongst my circle of friends.  The Adobo Fried Rice Omelet.  It's a pretty simple concept: shredded chicken adobo and fried rice (that looks as if it was fired in the adobo sauce itself) are wrapped in a thin layer of scrambled egg.  The result is a burrito-sized omelet of adobo goodness!  The fried rice is always nice and moist and the chicken is just the same.  The flavors of the adobo sauce are immediately evident, the savory soy sauce, tangy vinegar and the garlic are present in every bite, with the egg adding an additional texture to contrast the rice and chicken.  Oh, and this thing is BIG.  I don't think I've ever eaten a whole omelet in one sitting.  I usually save half for later or share with a friend.  I imagine I could defeat the beast if I focused on it, but I'm usually too hungover or too concerned about the buffet that is to follow later in the day to ever attempt the feat.

If you like adobo, you need to try the adobo fried rice omelet!

For those unfamiliar with Filipino-style adobo:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobo#Filipino_adobo

I've also sampled the lumpia (think Filipino-style eggrolls) and the turon (dessert lumpia with banana and jackfruit) and liked them both, but our motto in Vegas has become ""eyes on the prize!""  All we get now is the omelet.",P27iHHaGQSKLynirZY_61Q,0,0,5,9LMphuwNbl0pjnnX49prdA

This place is a restaurant with a karaoke bar next door.  At the bar, the drinks are about $5 - $6, but I have to say they're pretty weak.  I got the feeling that you don't really go to the bar to drink, you go more to watch the karaoke singers.  I myself am too chicken to get up there and sing, but more power to the people who do!  One of the people I came with said, ""There are three types of karaoke singers: ones who are really good, ones who think they're good but are really bad, and ones who know they're bad and don't give an *ish* because they're having fun.""  I definitely saw all three types that night.  Oh, and a guy who looked like Michael Jackson and Prince combined...he sang ""Music of the Night""...both the Christine and Raul parts...it was amazing.

You can order food and they will bring it to you in the bar, too, which is pretty cool.

Although the prices are pretty good some of the dishes lacked the flavor I was hoping for. Now its very hard to replicate flavors of things you have had . Now don't get me wrong there food was decent but I've  been to Hawaii and I have had plenty of the same dishes this place serves up. I will definitely give them  credit for effort on certain dishes. Let me start by saying Banana Mac nut pancakes are pretty good. The Korean BBQ was good it had nice flavors and a pretty good serving . Now the Tapa wasn't all that great they use a thinly slice meat like you would use for cheesesteaks and flavor wise there wasn't any. The Spam musubi had way too much rice and also lacked that extra sauce on the rice to give it that extra punch.  The Macaroni salad was missing something I fell flat on flavor( maybe it was the Mayo). I would come back but maybe try something else.,lVhcz_c2BQZE-MpltB1a-g,2,0,3,toR-MVcOPuYB7ESWzquCYw

Whenever I'm in the area I try to stop in.

On my last visit I ordered the Kalbi Combo. Which comes with the kalbi short ribs, teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu, rice and macaroni salad.

Now I've tried their katsu several times and I don't really like it so I swap my katsu for teriyaki everytime.

The short ribs are a little pricey if you order an entire dinner of them, so I order this combo so I at least get a taste of them without breaking the bank, but it always leaves me desiring more.

The place: Medium-size restaurant. Had plenty of people during lunch time (at least when I was there). The place was clean for eating.

Parking: Restaurant located at a shopping mall so there's plenty of parking spots.

If it comes with 2 scoops calrose rice (not this Uncle Ben stuff), and 1 scoop mac salad I give it a go!  I haven't been here in a while so I'm gonna leave the prices out on this one.  Sorry Hawaiians!

Food at Aloha Kitchen is pretty good, think of it as Hawaiian fast food if you will.  Not the healthiest of menus, but in a crave this place definitely fills a need.  I hope you aren't cutting carbs on this day!  The menu is a mix of Hawaiian, Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Korean all rolled into one.  Just like the people of Hawaii!  Chop Suey kine!  Popular are the Chicken Katsu and the Kalua Pig plates, big buggah servings with lots of rice and mac salad!  I like the Teriyaki combo with teriyaki chicken, pork, and beef, and I like the Kalbi combo too with Kalbi ribs, chicken katsu, and teriyaki chicken.  So ono!  

The menu is pretty big, there's apps like manapua, egg rolls, shumai, chicken wings, and poke.  Of course there's saimin, and wonton soup, as well as cheeseburgers, teriyaki burgers, and a mahi mahi sandwich as well.  And we can't forget the locals' fav...Spam Musubi!  There's is very good, I usually order 2-one for me and one to share (sharing optional).  There's lots of daily favorites like their teriyaki bowls, fried saimin, Loco Moco (yum), curry, Lau Lau (more yum), tempura, beef stew, and garlic chicken w/gravy just to name a few!

My biggest vice here though?  The Adobo Fried Rice Omelette.  This thing rocks!  I get it everytime I go!  Pork adobo fried with rice and lots of garlic, and put into an omelette.  I would have this thing for breakfast if I didn't for lunch!  I love mine with ketchup and shoyu on top...with a Spam Musubi (or 2)...and a side of kim chee.  Brok' da mouth!  Comfort food for me at it's finest.

Now don't go here expecting gourmet anything, your food will not be served on fine China or be expertly presented.  What you got here is some good no frills eats!

Our group had the chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken and teri beef plates with the rice and mac salad.  I can't say any of the above was worth a repeat visit. 

The katsu - I make better katsu myself and with that being said, I think L&L's katsu is better and . . . that's still L&L, not Mom's.  This was very garlicy, small strips of thin chicken with more crunch than chicken.  The sauce was ok, not best ever, but ok. Honestly could not finish it, I threw 1/2 of it away and I never do that. It was THAT bad.  And for the record, I had the bubbly stomach (gas) effect all afternoon.  Gross.

I think I have a problem with their teriyaki sauce.  The chicken was average and teri beef was chewy.  Sauce was ok, but like a 2-star says . . . ""Meh. I've experienced better"".  

I was most disappointed with the hard, dry rice - it's not hard to cook rice!!  Even my 8 year old makes better rice - cmon now!!  And then came the mac salad which again, L&L does better.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either.  And it certainly wasn't Mom's.

I came here for the first time on Dec 16th while we were in town celebrating my son's birthday.
I always see relatives of mine check in here on FB and it made me curious after seeing the yelp reviews and photos and menu. I brought my parents along with me and my son of course. 
After my first visit, it's probably now my favorite place to eat when I come out now. My parents said the same thing. They said they are probably only going to come and eat there now when they come to Vegas. I got the adobo omelette which was so amazing and so ridiculously huge, my mom got longanisa, my dad got hashbrowns and eggs, and for my son, who is insanely picky, i got the kids teriyaki plate, which he surprisingly ate and I finished of course. I ate off of everyone's plate and everything I had was so good. I would post photos but my phone is not allowing me to right now for some reason. All of that food we ordered for about 30 something dollars. Totally worth it. My mouth waters thinking about eating here again.

The staff is friendly and always walking around to make sure the customers are doing well. 
If we come in the morning we get the topsilog (Filipino breakfast dish) with over medium eggs, loco moco which is a HI staple. Their saimin is always a good go to if you looking for something light but filling. Now they offer oxtail soup year round with 2 heaping scoops of rice its SOOOOOO ono. The combination plate is the way to go if your not sure on what you want to eat it has a little bit of everything you cant go wrong and it comes with mac salad.  
Defiantly try their adobo omelet you wont be disappointed their are a few restaurants in town that offer it on their menu but there's something about Aloha's that just does it better, my fam from SD always requests me to pick one up when they are in town, and if they drove themselves they take one to go its that good.

I ordered chicken curry and I thought the chicken curry was going to be like Indian or Thai style, but I was wrong.  It was Hawaiian style and I have never heard of Hawaiian chicken curry.

The large serving was worth eight dollars, but I did not finish it.  

The karaoke bar was cool and entertaining.  However, I must caution you the music is loud, but I guess that is to be expected.  You get use to the noise once you are inside for a couple of hours.  

There is a lot of karaoke music to choose from.  The binder is about four inches thick and the music ranges from Hawaiian, Tagalog, Spanish, rap, rock, country, pop, and r&b.  Basically, whatever song you choose, it might be in the binder.  The binder is alphabetized by song.  Vegas has a lot of hidden singers.  They are really talented.  They should try out for American Idol or America Has Talent.   In between songs, they play danceable music like line dancing (the Electric Slide) or hip-hop.   However, I must add sometimes the microphone does not work.

- Manapua: This appears to be the same brand from Hawaii that is frozen and you just microwave it. Not that it's not good, it is...
- Kalua pig with cabbage: Tasty, but a little too salty for me (and I LURVE salty stuff).

I'm gonna get right into it: this place has the best teriyaki chicken in town. I don't care what they say about L&L having good food (it's ok), THIS IS WHERE YOU GO FOR TERI. When you order the chicken teri plate, you get three pieces of chicken, two balls of rice, and a little bit of mac salad. The mac salad here is the best, and I routinely order an additional serving of mac salad because it's so good!

If you've never had kalbi ribs, you need to. I remember the first time I had kalbi ribs, I thought, ""man, these things don't look like what I was expecting..."" and then they blew my mind. I recommend you try the Kalbi Combo, too. It's just so delicious. 

Everything here is good. The problem is that since I love the Chicken Teri and Kalbi Combo so much, I usually wind up getting that and not expanding my horizons. I mean, I've had a bunch of other things (katsu!) but I just go back to my favs. 

The prices are affordable, too. I was just there and bought two meals, two drinks, and an extra mac salad for $22 even. It's a really good deal when you consider that you get a lot of food for that amount of money, and it's really delicious, too. 

The place isn't the most high-end establishment in town. So what? It doesn't pretend to be. Their thing is awesome food at a great price, and they really deliver on that front.

When I walked in, I was happy to discover that Oxtail Soup is a winter special. It was a no-brainer and I certainly enjoyed it. The oxtail was a little tough and fatty, but the broth had good flavor. Then again, I'm not that picky. Overall, I think the Oxtail Soup at Market Street and even Island Flavor is better, but this one satisfied just fine.

The styrofoam box it comes in is also ludicrously heavy that I can't help but giggle uncontrollably in hentai-schoolgirl bursts when I swear I can't take another bite, oh no the smell itself is making me nauseous, how the hell can someone eat this much in one sitting......then pop the fridge open after 2 hours and praise God that it's still there!

If you want to try a bit of everything I would recommend the Aloha plate ($8.49) which comes with Chicken Katsu, teriyaki beef and teriyaki chicken.

Although it is not listed on their menu they sometimes have an Oxtail Soup which Filipinos call Bulalo. It is really good here and I recommend you ordering it if they offer it.

The Portuguese sausage did not taste like Portuguese sausage.. it didn't have that chili pepper saltiness to it like a Portuguese sausage should have..call me picky but I know my sausages

My husband has a Bento box ...mushy rice the spam was thick and not all the way cooked and the teriyaki sauce that was on the meat kind of tastes like it was from a can...
The only thing that was actually good..was the  chicken skewers..but they were a little raw looking...

4973764,2007-02-06,0,OJdufUU3hVabgviIBHksYw,"Continuing on the search to find a fabulous serving of pork lau lau, I was brought to Aloha Kitchen on S. Decatur Blvd.  Pulling into the lot, I recall seeing this place on yelp and was anxious to get my turn at it.  It's pretty crowded for a late Friday night and people are starting to pile in.

We join the line and perused the menu above.  The BF convinces me to go for the Hawaiian Plate at $8.99.  It's Kalua Pig and Pork Lau Lau, so this way he gets to try some of the kalua pig too!  This comes with two scoops of rice and one scoop of mac salad.  The BF ops for the Kalbi Combo at $7.99.  This give us Kalbi, Katsu, and Chicken Teriyaki.  It also comes with the standard two scoops of white rice and one scoop of mac salad.  

I should mention, I've been to my share of Hawaiian joints, but my sister takes the cake.  She definitely makes it a point to try out any new ones that she comes across.  She also always substitutes the two scoops of rice and one scoop of mac salad for an additional scoop of mac and one less rice.  This is usually never a problem, and if anything, they might charge a bit more for the mac salad.  Well, I asked if I could do this.  The cashier had to ask another woman, and she in turn had to ask another guy (the manager/owner) I assume.  He flat out said no.  Wow.  They tried explaining something about not charging me for the rice, so they can't do that.  Anyway, I think I was just put off with the whole ""No."" answer.  They could have said yes and said they would charge me for the substitution, which I probably would have agreed to anyway.  

We got our number, helped ourselves to beverages and condiments and took a seat in a booth.  One of the servers soon headed our way with my order.  Just as she was about to place it on the table, all this liquid came spilling out onto the floor and table from the plate.  (Wtf?)  She apologized and went to retrieve a towel to clean up the mess.  I was fine with the spill and clean up, my concern was with where all the liquid came from?!  I guess my Pork Lau Lau must have come out a bath, because that was dripping wet.  I ended up  pouring all this additional liquid off my plate into another plate before my rice and mac salad got too soggy from all this 'juice' sitting on my dish.  I unraveled my lau lau in search of my pork and took my first bite.  For being soggy, the meat was rather tough and the whole dish had no taste.  I ended up pouring tons of shoyu all over the dish.  There was no fatty bits either to give it any flavor.  Very disappointing on the pork lau lau part.  The kalua pig faired a bit better, but not by much.  It started out well, but as I got deeper into it, there was a lot of tough pieces that I ended up spitting out.  Overall, my dish was pretty disappointing.  I wouldn't go back here for any pork lau lau at all.

I was about halfway through my order before the BF's order finally arrived.  (This is never a good thing.)  His was better, in his opinion.  He had a decent experience with his order at least.  The Chicken Teriyaki had a sweeter sauce than what I'm used to, but that's probably why this dish does well here. 

The mac salad was better than some of the other places I've been to, so that was a good thing.  

There's the Aloha Bar next door and there's karaoke on Friday nights.  You'll see the servers bringing orders in next door if you're dining in.  

They do offer delivery, it's a $10 minimum and if you get their flyer, you'll find a 15% coupon on there. I asked if they had any business cards, which they were out of.  When the cashier asked the manager/owner if he had any, he asked ""Why?""  (Uh, 'cuz I'm going to yelp this place, that's why!)

When it comes down to it, Aloha Kitchen will continue to do well.  They are open later than some of the other Hawaiian establishments around town (5 am on Fridays and Saturdays I believe!) and they have a surplus of young customers coming in to chow down.  They have two other locations, one on E. Charleston and the other on S. Maryland Parkway.  I just know that if I return, I won't be getting any pork lau lau, that's for sure.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,4,3,2,f3EDknHXFcyM6a_W9BOCcQ

I live in Old Henderson and this restaurant and bar location is on Sahara and Decatur.  No place is far though, when you're on a local food fix!

Last night I had one of those cravings, so I came by to visit everyone at Aloha Kitchen.  I've been to this location many times because of the karaoke bar next door.  Everyone is AH-MAZE-ING.  First off, you're greeted by their bouncer, Greg.  Then you have Shawn at the bar.  Probably the coolest guy you'll ever meet.  Jovane (sorry if I misspelled your name) was the cocktail server and super sweet and Izzy is the KJ.  Very entertaining.  In the restaurant, there's Cyndel who's been a part of Aloha Kitchen for over 10 years.  Everyone's just full of Aloha and treats you like family.

Tonight I got the chicken katsu, spam musubi and the Shanghai lumpia.  The katsu is super crispy and good.  What I really like though, is the katsu sauce. Best katsu sauce I've had.  It's more tangy and savory, rather than sweet.  To me, it compliments the katsu very well.  With the musubi, they add their teriyaki sauce to the spam so it flavors the rice.  Packed with a lot of flavor.  The lumpia is small and filled with pork.  Served with a sweet chili dipping sauce.  Super good with a beer next door.  

One thing that I could do without is the constant fighting this place has on late nights.  Lately though, there hasn't been any sketchy activities.

Unfortunately, they pour the sauce on top of the meats and put some in the musubi so it wasn't that great of a plate for me. If I knew then I would have asked it without and maybe it would be better. 

This was my 2nd time here. It's been a while since the last visit was less than stellar (they forgot some of the elements on my plate, added a meat we didnt order on another plate) and I remember thinking it was just okay tasting.

 I think it's alright for late night eats, but there are other better Hawaiian plate places for daytime.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,3,3,XYHSUBGNtIby5oma9hf9bw

The cook seemed like a Latino man talking under his breath. I noticed the cushions on the seating area torn and the tables a little dirty. 

I ordered a bento box and since I don't eat beef asked to substitute the meat for either chicken or more spam. The cashier seemed clueless, and went to the back and asked the cook, not a manager or owner, but the Latino cook. 

Reading some of the reviews while waiting for my meal leaves me wondering if this place should be called ""Aloha"" kitchen? Do the cashiers know what Aloha means? I felt a smile and a warm welcome greeting would have been a better touch than questioning me why I was asking if the food here was authentic.

Ok, so I get my meal, take a bite and am surprised. It tastes good. My friend liked his Katsu and the rice was perfect. 

Overall, the food is better than most but the service and attitude needs to go! I'm being fair, the food is a 4plus and service a 2.

5053008,2011-08-17,0,OJdufUU3hVabgviIBHksYw,"There are Hawaiian restaurants everywhere in Las Vegas, but this is one of the more ""ono"" spots in my opinion!

* Chicken Katsu - Can never go wrong with deep friend strips of chicken and rice, right?
* Adobo Omelet - Scrambled egg wrap around rice mixed with shredded pork adobo.  It's in the shape of a burrito and is pretty huge (although I can easily gulf down one myself!).  I know a lot of people hype this dish up, but to me, it lives up to the hype.  It tastes like home cookin!
* Loco Moco - Gotta love hamburger meat smothered in gravy with egg all over?  I've tried many a loco moco and Aloha Kitchen has one of the best I've tried in Vegas (best I'd ever had is in Hawaii).
* Oxtail Soup - Delicious and a must try if you can.  
* Saimin - A little too salty for me.
* Tapsilog - Tapa, egg, and garlic fried rice just like my dad's standard breakfast.

Prices are reasonable and the décor is cute (there's a location on Sunset that is aesthetically nicer) .  My one complaint is that the food can take long sometimes and the service is par.  There were a couple of times we got the wrong order/order never called when eating there and a couple of times we got a cashier who just seemed angry all the time.  This could have been due to the busyness of the place though since it does get pretty crowded late nights.   

We frequent the bar next door too.  They have a pretty great song selection, although it can be hard to get on the mic on busy Friday and Saturday nights.

My friend had the bbq combo(Katsu, teri chicken & kalbi). Both our katsu's were a bit overdone because the outside was pretty dark brown and tasted accordingly. The 2 scoops of rice looked more like 3. The mac salad was decent. I had a taste of my friend's teri chicken and I could tell it wasn't marinated bbq/teri chicken I'm used to having back in Hawaii growing up.

Spam musubi - typical verison. No furukake though.

Kalua pig & cabbage - pretty good for a fast food version of this dish. Savory, sweet pork mixed with the bitterness of the cabbage is a mix that I love. Meat is moist and tender. Something I'd probably order each time.

Adobo fried rice omlette - very flavorful dish. Mmm...good stuff. Everyone else has pretty much covered it, so I don't feel the need to say much.

5070876,2011-12-31,0,OJdufUU3hVabgviIBHksYw,"Oh boy oh boy.... Where do I begin..  I saw their advertisement for about 2 weeks for their xmas day buffet for $15.  The list of food sounded great and included many typical hawaiian items.  I arrived there around 7.  It was fairly quiet/empty and figured most people came there earlier. There were probably only 20 people in there when I arrived.  
1st off the service was great. The employees were very nice and I definitely expected that being in a hawiian restaurant.  The place was also very clean and that too was not an issue.  

The food is the main issue here.  When I walked upto the buffet, the sushi table had 3 basic rolls on there and was ok at best.  The lumpia was probably the most decent thing I ate.  I was in total shock when I saw the spam musubi.  They had it all nice looking, all cut in half in nice big pieces (this would've been perfect but NOOOO they screwed it up.) They had some sort of sauce on ALL of it. The problem is you CAN'T put sauce on a rice item like this that is sitting there.  I had one bite and it completely fell apart in my hand because the sauce had made the whole thing mushy.  

The katsu was overcooked and dried out.  The halfway decent stir fry veggies were sorta ok but they were sitting under a heat lamp and getting mushy and all in all lacked flavor.  The curry was very bland. I tried a little of a few other dishes and again everything was bland and blah.  I was completely disappointed in the macaroni salad. WOW it had nooooo flavor to it. It was just simply mayonaisse.  

The desserts were store bought donuts, some chocolate chip cookies, and some funky brownies.  and btw I saw other people sitting around me making faces too about the food. 

There's a few problems here. #1 let's compare apples to apples... Aloha kitchen vs L&L Hawaiian. This buffet gave me a really good idea of what their food is like if I ordered it off their regular menu (vs buffet style) I have been to L&L many many times and wow they are definitely a LOT better then Aloha.  I have tried several things on their menu and everything has been flavorful, yummy, not over cooked and their macaroni salad is great too.   1 out of 10.. Aloha you're a 1.  L&L a 10.
There was nothing good about the food at Aloha and I was VERY disappointed.  Now comparison #2.  Although now I'm comparing apples to oranges but still.  

Aloha vs buffet @ asia which is just minutes up the street.  Aloha, you can not charge $15 for what you put on that buffet with that kind of quality.  Buffet @ Asia is WAY better then you in quality and selection for the same price.  Just sushi alone puts you to shame (and they don't have any fantastic sushi either but it's way better then yours)  and with Sushi Mon being 10 min up the street as well, they blow both places out of the water.  

It's very tough to run a good restaurant, but if L&L can have almost all the same menu items and they do it right with quality, and taste and the same price, then so can you. Aloha kitchen.... You're a discrace to good hawaiian food.  

I will continue my business at L&L",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,1,0,1,l2kH05xRaRj2RRZbOiPMNg

Food is okay, you can get a lot of Filipino Hawaiian staples like Loco Moco, Spam Musubi, Kalbi, Lumpia.

There isn't an option to do garlic rice either which is vital for a Tapsilog in my opinion. They have plenty to offer on the menu so I'm sure you can find something that will appease your palate.

The 2 stars are for the kalua pork as it was delicious and plentiful. 

I noticed the mixed reviews but still thought it could be worth the stop.  I'll break it down. 

Ordered the hawaiian plate with an order of spam musubi. 

Musubi was like no musubi I've ever had. A thick chewy wrap of seaweed around a thin piece of spam and rice. Had some sort of sweet sauce in their as well.  Not a good spin on musubi. 

Mac salad...now this was almost good, but wasn't  ..really the Mac salad makes the meal in my opinion. 

Lau Lau ...where to begin..well I'm no expert, I don't believe a giant pile of leaves and green mush (see pic) over a tiny bit of the inside stuff is the way to do it. 

Perhaps they make something worth eating, this wasn't

Kind of expensive...$28 for 2 beers, and 3 well shots.  
Karaoke:  fun...but the KJ had a pretty sizable queue, and sang 2 songs himself within about 7 minutes of each other.  As a KJ at other venues myself...you don't do that.  You don't sing in the queue unless you have less than 8 people singing.  
Also, there is a sign on the KJ booth that says ""2 drink minimum.""

Staff:  awesome.  When they were closing down, my friend and I were waiting for our very drunken men to finish in the bathroom.

spacious eatery thats feels more like a filipino eatery in nevada than a Hawaiian themed restaurant in Vegas.  

bleh on the design, good color on the walls and all but they couldve gone to Aloha Swapmeet to buy some decor to really make this place 'pop'. 

nice menu choices, i guess   ...hawaii esque

they got a karaoki bar here too so thats gotta be fun at some point.

They didn't have Dr. Pepper on the bar side so I had to choose something else. I mean really I just bought this from you guys. Who cares where I consume it? My friend and I went there for karaoke on a Friday night. BIG MISTAKE! I will never go here again. They falsely advertise karaoke. We go there at 8p.,m and didn't sing until an hour later. Then we submitted another song and it was not called on until after 11:20p.m. I mean really there were not that many singers. Also other singers got to sing two times in a row, when I waited two hours to sing one other song. I had to drive my friend home and I was tired of waiting. I got home at midnight with one song sang. The DJ whatever you want to call him, talked too much, played too much dance music and had a dance off and a person celebrating their birthday come up and have a sick dance of three women around him. It understand it's his show but fix your website. Say it's karaoke, dancing and partying. My friend told the DJ we were leaving soon and he said he'd move our song up.

It's difficult to get Hawaiian Sun drinks on the East Coast especially my fave, passion orange flavor. When I'm in Vegas I get several cans from Aloha and put them in my hotel fridge! I also have to admit I've packed some and brought it back to FL once. I grew up drinking that stuff on the daily.

Living in Hawaii and visiting family in Vegas, what better place to eat and talk story like Aloha Kitchen. Market Street Cafe would be another place that the locals go and eat, but Aloha Kitchen & Bar is so ono!

They place closes pretty late so you can get your late night grinds on if your up past 12am.

What I got was Local plate which includes: Combination of Teriyaki Chicken, Beef and 2 Spam Musubi. It included more rice also. I think they can cut back on the rice that isn't in the Musubi and give an extra scoop of mac salad.

The teri beef and chicken was cooked awesome. It wasn't over cooked and tough. The chicken was easy to cut and so was the teriyaki beef. The teriyaki sauce catered to the masses and more of a mainland pallet but I thought it was very delish!

THe Musibi could have been wrapped a little tighter because it was falling apart when i took a bite out of it.

Pricing was on point too. nothing crazy like paying on the strip, but for the amount of food you get, and the price you pay, its a deal!

Not cause there's a bar but It's actually not that far from the strip. Still not a short a drive as the other one but it almost seems like there are more options at this location on Decatur.

My friends & I were starving for some local food one late Saturday night. We were coming from Bellagio and it was near closing time for the other location so we made a beeline for Decatur because it's open much later. This restaurant is located in an outdoor shopping plaza. There was plenty of parking.

I ordered the lau lau and a side of spam musubi. Having come back from visiting Hawai'i a few months ago, I was really craving some authentic local grindz. Craving fulfilled... The pork lau-lau was good. It had good flavor. I just wish there was more of it than the serving had. I guess I really was hungry cause I scarfed the musubi and lau-lau in no time. Haha. My friends all liked what they ordered... I usually go for a bento box or local plate. Next time for sure.

Service was friendly just like the other location. Pay and order at the counter. You get a number and they bring you your food, drinks and utensils. I look forward to going back to this location whenever I'm in town to not only check out the other menu items but to see the bar area... I know this is where Anuhea performed when she was in town.

Not grilled. I didn't want to argue simply because I was wary of having something done to my reorder, didn't want to waste food, and was already starving. On top of that, the mahi-mahi omelettes were extremely bland (along with the side of mac salad) that I needed to add a lot of Aloha soy sauce which was probably the only best thing about my meal.",al9QoD5olRTbn7Hu8IyMnA,0,0,2,BT3fbGPGhwxSd0XG_6RLig

The menu is now displayed on several flat screen TV'S.  The seating is nicely furnished and the staff is friendly and welcoming as always.

Not sure if they still hold karaoke events nightly here, but, it is definitely a popular spot for some plate lunch grinds.  

As you may or may not be aware of...there is a high amount of Islanders in Las Vegas.  This translates into a high amount of Hawaiian style eateries.  In my humble opinion, Aloha Kitchen does not ""wow"" me much with their menu.  They are mediocre at best with their staples.  However, where Aloha Kitchen makes up for this, is with menu items that can't be found everywhere.  

For instance, just the name of adobo friend rice instantly turns you into a rubber necker doing double takes.  It's difficult to choose anything else unless you tried it for the first time.  Not bad, but not special, although, no other place serves this to my knowledge.

I hope the avid Aloha kitchen heads don't take offense to my review, but simply put, I have had better.  Ross J's don't necessarily tickle my pickle and and L&L's doesn't quite float my boat in this respect either.

Hands down...I have to roll with Big Island Flavor with a close tie by Island Style, Rice Tracks & Ohana's.  If Hawaiian Hale still existed, they would be near the top indeed.

It's all about preference, and I tend to judge a lot on particular aspects such as mac salad and so forth.  You can bet if I get the itch for the homeland grinds, AK was still be considered.

The Adobo Friend Rice Omelet did NOT disappoint. I did wish the omelet was a bit thicker because I LOVE eggs, nonetheless the flavor was on great. I did feel that it was a little TOO salty, but the BF, my sister and cousin disagreed. 

Everyone talks about the pancakes and now I know why. The pancakes are fluffy and soft and you really can taste the subtle flavor of the banana and the macadamia nuts perfectly topped it off.

reason for just 3 stars: their lau lau (chicken, fish and/or pork wrapped in taro leaves and then banana leaves and steamed, you don't eat the banana leaves) is not the best it can be. i've tried that dish two or three times, and have to say that it's alright. not the best. my first time having it here, i was a little dissappointed, but decided to try it again b.c i just love the dish so much (when it's done right), i thought it deserved a second chance. the second time around, same thing. the meat inside was just a block of fat and a bit of meat. i need me some variety, fish, chicken and/or pork meat.

lesson learned, stick to what you know is good: the adobo omelette!!! rice, chicken adobo all wrapped up in an egg that cooked almost like a crepe. add some sriracha on top, and you're set. and it's huge, so you can share with another person or not, depending on your appetite. last time there, three of us shared an adobo omellete and the kalbi ribs plate, perfect amount! and their mac salad is pretty good too.

Home being here in Cali. So when my friends suggested to my girlfriend and our ""Vegas Travel Crew"" to stop by Aloha Kitchen and try the Adobo Omelet, we decided to come down and see what the buzz was all about. Sadly, I and my fellow associates were quite displeased with what we sank our teeth into. 

I don't know if it was the idea of an Adobo Omelet that excited us or the hype that our friends were making but all of us were really eager to try it but we ended up very disappointed with it. There was nothing really special about it. It was just rice inside an omelet. In fact, the rice itself was bland and dry. There was nothing about that dish that resembled Adobo other than the brown color of the rice, which I repeat, was bland and dry. To put it bluntly, that Omelet sucked balls. It was kind of hard to face our friends and give them a fake smile and say, ""Oh that shit was bomb! We're definitely going back to have another one when we come back again."" 

In all honesty, we would have been better off just ordering the Chicken Katsu or Loco Moco. But that would kind of defeat the purpose of going there in the first place because if I wanted L&L, I would have just gone there before we came to Vegas or waited until I got back. I can at least say I tried it so that has to count for something.

I'll give Aloha Kitchen a little mercy and say at least the hours are great and perfect for after clubbing dining. Unlike the people who I thought were my friends, I will look out for those of you who are planning on visiting Aloha Kitchen and recommend having anything other than the Adobo Omelet... unless you're high.

Wouldn't come back. I'll stick to ohana bbq.  Even the loco moco at Born and Raised (BAR) is 10000x better.  Maybe I just got weeks old left over I don't know.

After a long week of dancing in Vegas... all I wanted is HAWAIIAN food! mmm... gotta love comfort food. 

Came here yesterday... my 2 favorite local spots are closed on Sundays... and I wanted to take my friend who was visiting from San Diego to a cool Hawaiian spot... and Aloha Kitchen seems to be one of the few Hawaiian spots open on Sundays! (I'll give them a star just for being open on Sundays!)

I was kind of iffy on trying Aloha Kitchen due to the reviews... But one of my friends from Hawaii Richmond works the bar here and he mentioned that was food was great so I figure why not try it out for myself :))

I ordered the Hawaiian plate, with all rice (I substituted mac salad with rice), kalua pig and laulau. It was yummy! I had to get a can of Hawaiian sun :) My friend ordered the spam and eggs.

I wasn't disappointed with my Hawaiian plate. If I closed my eyes, I could picture myself eating Hawaiian food at my grandma's house on the Big Island.

Okay prices... Order came out pretty fast. Meal for 2... $20. Casual indoor seating.

If I'm craving Hawaiian food on Sundays... Aloha Kitchen will be my go to hot spot.

Mahalo Aloha Kitchen for my 15 minute vacation back home to Hawaii...! Now to work off the 1 pound I gained.

I'll be back, when I get my cravings :D

If you're in the area... stop by Aloha Kitchen! and if you're at the bar... and Richmond is working... tell him I sent you!

Aloha!

The girl who took my order had me spell my name out and took down my phone number. I placed my order with the intention of picking it up on my way in to work. She confirmed my order, told me the price, and confirmed that I was to pick it up at the Sahara/Decatur location. I got to the restaurant at 7:43. The guy at the register was busy taking another phone order, so I waited a few minutes. When he got off the phone I told him I was there to pick up my order that I had called in. He told me he didn't have any orders under my name. He even asked me if there was a different name that I might have used... What the hell!?!? I was now going to be late for work WITHOUT any food to eat for 10 hours. When I got to my car, I even called the same phone number I had called when I placed the order, and the guy at the register answered... pretty f*-d up.

The two best things about this location is the karaoke and the bar (I know, right?!) Their beers aren't expensive but not *too* cheap, reasonable enough to have a good time while you're sitting back watching people sing and dance to karaoke. The karaoke is a blast! Went with a group of my co-workers, one of the most festive nights we've had, and the regulars that are there are very sociable and willing to sing/dance along too!

We placed our order at the counter, our first time so my friend asked how did they do their macaroni salad. My friend is from Hawaii originally and has had macaroni salad many different ways. She was curious so asked as she did not want to regret a double order of a style of mac salad she may not like...you catch my drift.

The clerk replied that she had no clue, however she added she ""thinks"" it may have chopped cucumber in it? She also stated she had never tasted it before. Ok so being the type we are, we go for it, and wield the consequences later...so double order of the ""Mystery"" mac salad it is.

It was a bit bland, not made with best foods, most likely store brand mayo. Not sweet, not very flavorful, however if mixed in with every other item on your plate, it does the trick.

We ordered the the Pork Lau-lau, served with Rice and Macaroni Salad.
This dish was good, the lau-lau was a great presentation, very tender, juicy and tasty. It was a nice portion indeed. The sticky rice was good as well.

I also ordered a side of lumpia shanghai w/sweet chile sauce the way I like it. Mmmmmm yummy.

I make chicken lumpia at home, I will come here for my pork lumpia!

All in all was an ok meal, some goodness balanced with some blandness rates this review with a 3 Star.

I was in the area today and stopped by around 10:45 in the morning. There were 5 people ahead of my in line, but it wasn't crazy busy like the last time. I ordered the Local Plate to go. It came with teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef and 2 spam musubis. The chicken had a lot of fat on it, there was barely any meat at all. The beef was tender and flavorful. I also like how they are not stingy with their spam musubis. Thick slices of spam and they did not over do it with the rice. Other places will put a very thin slice of spam on a huge block of rice, which is always disappointing. The portions of chicken and beef were small, but the 2 spam musubis definitely made up for that!

The cashier wasn't too friendly, but she wasn't rude either. I thought for sure that I would have to wait a while for my food, but it actually came out pretty quickly.

If getting lunch there, I'd suggest placing a take out order unless you're gonna eat there because lunch is a crazy time. Food is way better than any L&L's I've eaten at and since I can't make it down to Henderson for Ross J's or into Spring Valley for Island Flavors than this will have to do. Uncle Russ at Island Style can do only so much since he shares half the menu with Korean dishes and that spot is always popping as well. So yes I keep coming back for the quick and decent Hawaiian food most hawaiian BBQ spots can't pull off. I've tried pretty much everything and haven't really found a fault in their menu. They even serve some Filipino deserts which are good lunch time treats for me. Prices are more than reasonable, nothing over 10. I would suggest they offer a delivery service.
