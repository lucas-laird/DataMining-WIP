When we called to complain they did not care we ended up just throwing our food away at the end of the night.  I don't recommend it for anybody to go there they were truly horrible. I'm just saying..then they promised us some teriyaki chicken the next day told us to come back and get it but the rest of the food sucked too so I couldn't to eat more of the nasty and I  go back and couldn't refund or anything couldn't be done so just very disappointed in this specific Panda express not speaking on all panda express but this one truly sucks....,gb102GSHOwxrr4wEKpjkIw,1,0,1,xYDCxmP1kkkCOx-Yb_3yZg

The beef had no sauce and was dripping in oil. The forks are so cheap they broke in our food. The customer service while ordering was good but it could not compensate for the bland food. If this was our first time eating Panda Express we would not choose to go there again.",-xPg37682OOYafOBKn6n4g,0,0,2,bIC61LvB94gHDbd3QNtsTQ

1869946,2017-12-20,0,1i4iRBkkNU_o_S2pY7W7kQ,Horrible Shift Lead for closing shift. Azalia (shift lead) and Anna were attending our order for a while. We received half of our order at first. Apparently Azalia had family come in at the same time. As we were waiting for the other half of our order Azalia was firing up a conversation with her family after already giving them their food and ringing them up. Completely ignoring the fact that we were still waiting for our food. My mother had to ask her twice before actually receiving the rest of her order 10 min later. I simply asked Azalia for her name and as I walked away she started speaking to her family in spanish(assuming I wouldn't understand her) saying its her last day there and she didnt care if we left a bad review etc etc. Completely unconsiderit of the fact that we had already waited a good amount of time to even receive our order due to the fact that she was sidetracked by her family. As she was wiping down tables Azalia kept giving me dirty looks which made me extremely uncomfortable as I was eating. My mother made her aware that we were unsatisfied with the way they serve and treat their customers. Instead of bettering the situation she started raising her voice claiming that I had given her an attitude when I asked for her name and that she didnt care about our opinion. Ive never had such a hard time buying fast food.,oj0utks2q4YDz37I7KlUsg,0,0,1,nKsJPG9JbY8kMB7PEBj9KQ

I guess I made the mistake of getting there right when they opened, mixed veggies were not done yet, so I waited.. Took a bite of broccoli and noticed a strange flavor.. Didn't think much about it then took a huge bite of mixed veggies that where all stuck 
together with this waxy white substance. (that I didn't notice) .... Gross it coated my mouth and tasted horrible...showed it to the clerk she asked me if I wanted something else... Haha  not from here.. I'm currently feeling sort of sick.  Be careful this is not the norm for panda in Vegas. so gamble on this location if you want.

This location gets high volume of customers but the line moves quite quickly. The good thing about this location constantly being busy is that the food is always fresh!
