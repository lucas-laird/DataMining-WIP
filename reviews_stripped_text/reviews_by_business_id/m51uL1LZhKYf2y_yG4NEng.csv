16995,2013-03-31,0,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,"This place is moderate, but there are better places to eat pho and oxtail soup.

The waitress, or owner, was nice and made a few jokes. She checked up on us often, but, like other reviewers said, there was barely any business going on. She was friendly and didn't radiate a bad atmosphere. She had an ego about the restaurant's food, but it could have been better.

The prices are not worth the amount of food you receive. I ordered rice noodle with the oxtail for $10. The food was good, but they gave you a small bowl for the price you paid. The noodles were thick, the broth was good, and the oxtail was soft and tasty. There are many pho places that charge $7 for a large bowl, but Pho 87's $10 bowl would be considered a small order in those other pho restaurants.

I wouldn't recommend Pho 87 to other people, but it's not horrible as other reviewers have said.",BGMmFg6relFh0-sJEwAvbA,0,0,3,zDMhI4jSiEWTfd-taPxUPw

It's the worst Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to and I have gone to a lot of Vietnamese restaurants! We thought because the place aired in The Food Network that it would be good! We were so wrong and such a big disappointment! 

Upon arrival, we should have left because the atmosphere was not welcoming at all. The place hardly had anyone there and there were toys laid out by the entrance as if it's a mini daycare. We thought let's try it out as we've came so far and since they were on The Food Network that their food should be good. Right??

Wrong! We ordered two bowls of pho and a lobster fried rice. The waitress made sure we understand the price of the lobster fried rice is $28 just in case we didn't see the price. She said some customers need to be reminded of that as if we couldn't afford the dish. She tried to persuade us to order the shrimp fried rice instead. We insisted on getting the lobster fried rice, which took about 15 minutes to make and upon arrival the dish looked very plain and tasted salty with no flavor whatsoever. 

As for the bowls of pho, they looked so unappetizing! There were so much suds in the soup bowl which was overpowering. The waitress said the suds are from the raw beef and that next time to ask for them to soak the beef in water before placing them into the soup. She said the suds actually make the soup taste better. Ugh!!! There won't be a NEXT TIME!  I tried tasting the soup and I almost threw up!  It was the worst pho I've ever had! It tasted so plain and no pho flavor at all!! No kidding!! We didn't touch the other bowl of pho at all because they looked so disgusting! Soaked in suds and the fat noodles made the pho all wrong!

To top off the worst experience ever, there were postings of sayings throughout the restaurant that were so inappropriate, as it undermines you that you can't afford their pho! Their prices are unreasonably high for a bowl of pho! Average amount for a bowl of pho is $7-8. Imagine paying for a bowl of pho for $17 filled with suds and disgust! If you ask me, they went out of their heads thinking they are all good because they aired on The Food Network!!  Total bill was $90 and we sure felt stooped coming out of the place!

The next time I go to a restaurant that had been in The Food Network, I would definitely think twice!",By5Mc2VE8zkZAQvziYcryw,2,0,1,1G-huum-GduaAPV3qzFEVQ
41053,2010-08-27,2,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,"Overall, this place has delightful pho at reasonable prices.  The broth has fantastic, rich flavor.  I ordered the medium size, and it came with so much meat, I couldn't finish it all.  Ample veggies and herbs on the side.

Their spring rolls leave a little to be desired.  I don't eat pork, so I always order them with shrimp only.  For some reason, the shrimp always tastes a little brackish and overly fishy.  Peanut sauce drowns that out.  I've never gotten sick from eating them, but it's unnerving, none the less.  

My friends and I were originally lured into Pho 87 by the large banner out front proclaiming ""LOBSTER FRIED RICE.""  We got an order for the three of us, to the tune of $19.99.  It was worth every penny.  It was delicious, lightly fried rice, with at LEAST 3 whole lobster tails in it.  I'm talking big, meaty hunks of lobster throughout the dish.  It's a nice splurge.

They make their own in-house chili oil.  If you're a fan of spicy things, you simply must try it.  It's fabulous in the soup and on anything else you choose.

Every time my friends and I have visited, there's hardly anyone in the dining room.  I have absolutely no idea why.  The dining room is pleasantly decorated, and the food is quite good.

My favorite thing about the place, though, is the main hostess/waitress who works there.  I suspect she partially owns the place.  Her English is nearly flawless, and she has a biting, sarcastic wit that had our table in stitches.  Not only that, but when one of my table-mates asked to see the big fish (front tank) eat one of the small goldfish (tank in rear of dining room), she consented to sacrifice a small fish, provided he pay for the ""prey"" ($3).  Obviously, this isn't a regular request over there, but she was willing to accommodate us.  Now THAT'S service!",Of9UCq61gd2ehoN337taKQ,4,2,4,d_MQmkyjIoWNadX1VfeBJw

No other place has filet mignon pho either.  Yum!  Egg rolls are freshly made on sight, not bought at a store then simply fried at the restaurant.  You can taste the difference!  After visiting Vietnam I fell in love with the authentic food there. I've been to so many pho places in Las Vegas, most are mediocre, a few are better than the rest, but this one is the only place I've tried that stands out.  It is tied for number one pho I ever had which wasn't even Pho Huang on Pastuer Street in HCMC.  A street vendor in Vietnam made spectacular pho, I couldn't believe it.  I slurped it up with joy while seated on a bucket with another bucket as my table. Pho 87 is the only place the duplicates that awesome taste but with much nicer seating.  Ignore the negative reviews and get real pho here.  Skip the veggie, unless you must, and the chicken, and go straight for the filet mignon pho.",tdygTnmH033ny65XOsRudQ,0,0,5,wJ6MLS7pBJX_UmEqwRiXBQ

Saw a billboard on the strip advertising this restaurant and decided to take the 10-minute drive off the strip to have lunch there- big mistake.
Walked into the restaurant and was greeted by a hoard of dirty children toys behind the cash register- bad first impression.
Next, sat down and only one other customer was in there having lunch- now I understand why...
Looked at the menu and was annoyed that there were three different prices for a basic pho item: small, medium, and large- I prefer when restaurants just keep it simple with one price. 
Meanwhile, my boyfriend who is from Mexico says to me that he does not want to eat there because of all the Trump signs posted all over the restaurant.  I look up from reading the menu and the walls are indeed covered with Vote for Trump posters. Asians for Trump! He never complains about anything, so I knew he was very bothered by the signage.
Waitress comes to take our order and I politely tell her that we are going to leave because my boyfriend feels uncomfortable because of the Trump signs. She immediately gets defensive and says, ""You're here to eat right, not for politics?"" Then she grabs our menus. We start walking towards the door and she says to us, ""Don't worry, only smart people eat here anyways."" We both say nothing. We walk out the door, she follows us, then yells something at us in Vietnamese.
I have never experienced this kind of uncomfortable interaction at a restaurant. We were on vacation, so I tried not to let it bother me too much. I'm just not sure why this woman has to display all of those Trump signs inside her restaurant- perhaps she should try to understand that his hateful comments toward the Mexican community are very offensive and she should not bring that kind of negative energy into her restaurant.
We drove down Spring Mountain Road and had a very nice lunch at Magal BBQ instead- I highly recommend this place! It's brand new, they have a $7.99 lunch special menu, and were very friendly. : )",aeVSmufW6AJqum_vFDH35Q,6,1,1,_R2dZZOnpWLutyxrh5P76w

This is perhaps the best pho I've ever eaten since I came to the U.S. 6 years ago. From the noodle, the meat, the mint, to the broth, everything was so perfect. The pho at Pho87 reminded me of the ones in Southern Vietnam. Not only the pho was good, but the owner was also super friendly.

After reading the reviews, we were excited to give Pho 87 a try.  Unfortunately, we had no idea how much in contrast to what we read our experience would be.

We arrived in great spirits after a long hike.  Upon walking in, we were put off by the large piles of restaurant supplies stacked all over the restaurant.  The waitress was seated, eating and with a full mouth, she swatted us over to our table.  

She stood over us while we looked at the menu and asked if we were going to take more time. We finally asked her give us a minute please and she seemed put off to have to walk away. 

My husband questioned about the size
of the XL soup, and the waitress then proceeded to rant about how customers come in so distracted and never notice the bowls in the lobby.  She waved him over to ""check it himself"".

Going from bad to worse, this is also what took place:
* rushed me over as I was walking from the bathroom to order (we were the only ones in the entire restaurant).
* told my family to be careful with the hot soup because they don't have insurance.
* when my husband told her that she was being extremely rude, she said she thought we had been there before and knew (we have no idea what this meant and had no desire to investigate).  She also said that she talked to us like our mother would and my husband said ""no, my mother is nice to me"".
* she continued to complain that customers come in like zombies and don't pay attention to anything.

I don't know if this is a one time experience given what others have posted.  I can tell you that this is by far the worst and strangest restaurant experience we have ever had.  If the food tasted good, I don't know. I refused to order anything and my husband and 2 kids who love Pho said their appetites were ruined and couldn't report how it tasted.

Don't knit pick the other stuff or you'll always be disappointed wherever you go...or most places you go....

My best to Pho87. A for effort.

Something different about the shrimp and meat they used in it.  had well done brisket w/ noodles and have to admit it was the best Pho I've had (from LA and have had it all over SoCal).  Again the reason try get the 5 star rating is because of the quality of their stuff... Meat was fatty but not only fat- mint was fresh and clean- their bean sprouts also were clean and no discoloration.

In lieu of flying to Vietnam and eating there this is about the best you'll find stateside. Second point; the owner has a sense of humor and is a playful sort. She is also assured of her skill (rightfully so) and won't hesitate to tell you to not mess up her amazing broth by adding a bunch of unnecessary junk to it. My mama always taught me it's polite to taste before adding seasonings anyway, so I think madam Pho is correct to chastise anyone who destroys her beautifully made broth with a bunch of condiments before giving it a taste. 
I had a lovely time here and the owner and I had a wonderful chat about my travels in Vietnam. She even scared up some fruit I haven't had since leaving SE Asia as a special treat.

There was nothing special about the soup and there was not much beef in my bowl. The pho was served with thick noodles which we didn't like because it was hard to pick up with chopsticks and it soaked up the broth. After checking out Yelp reviews later, I read that the soup comes in 3 sizes. We didn't see the bowl size options on the menu nor were we asked by the waitress. That was misleading because I don't know which size bowls our soup came in, but we were charged a total of $20.60. That's the most we've ever paid for two bowls of pho.

Maybe 30 years ago when there was no competition, because this doesn't even compare to edible.  It was extremely distasteful.  Unfortunately I live in Orange County and if your not good the competition will take your business away.  So maybe to the average joe who doesn't know what a real good bowl of pho tastes like, then this is your place.  
Second, the prices are outrageous.

Food: 
We came to this resto in the afternoon. Mom wanted to try their ox tail soup, which according to her, tasted good. It had decent amount of ox tail. On the other hand, I ordered rice noodle pho soup. It  tasted just like other pho soup, nothing extraordinary. My bf, on the other hand, wasn't so lucky with his piece of chicken (I believe it was broiled chicken or barbequed chicken...I can't quite remember the name)... it looked soggy, tasted bland, and was cold...like it had been seating in the kitchen forever.

Ambiance:
Traditional Chinese restaurant style. At the time we came, however, the air conditioner was turned off. They opted to just open the door to let air in.

Customer Service:
This was were it went downhill. The hostess who took us to our seating area was extremely rude!!! She kept staring at us eating. Seriously. Who does something that rude. Afterward, my mom asked for extra rice for her ox tail because she felt like eating rice and the hostess (who was also acting as our waitress) said, ""You already have noodles. Why order rice?"" *followed by an irritating stare at us* As customers, it was our choice to ask for anything we want in the menu... Why was she questioning our choice. Then, she even asked us if we were going to eat the vegetables which accompanied our order or she'll take them back to the kitchen. Who does that? To top it of, she didn't even ask politely. She asked in a rude way. In addition, our order also took such a long time... despite not having anyone in the restaurant but us. 

Verdict:
I'll never return to this restaurant again. There are far better restaurants, with better tasting food, that also have good customer service.",rFC_OKTwFB5f5QnD0_nedQ,2,1,2,XcqdXQe1XTgOeNrueJ-Ang

Yes the environment is rather eclectic with a buffet area that looks like a garage sale. But can't complain about the pho.

When we went through the doors we found the place completely empty, but it really didn't matter. On the counter you can see the different sizes they serve: small, medium, large.. GORILLA. That bowl is bigger than my head, apparently it consist of 2lbs of meat, with the addition of the noodles and broth, I applaud whoever can devour that, you'll probably have a satisfied if not full tummy. 

I ordered the Oxtail Pho and I have to say it was very very tender. The meat easily slipped off the bone; the broth was delicious too, and the cilantro added in made it very refreshing. I was really full after just having a small bowl. My cousin and I decided to get a drink with boba and it was pretty good, the tapioca balls were soft which is always delightful when you're having bubble tea. 

The lady that greeted has quite an interesting sense of humor, and when one of my relative's order came really late she gave us spring rolls to make up for it.

1381003,2012-09-11,5,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,"Let me start by saying...my hubby and I were regulars...I'm talking we used to go here three times a week.

I always ordered Oxtail Pho, hubby ""The White Boy Special"" (it says that on the menu) chicken Pho. Two waters (she puts limes or lemons in it). Sometimes I would get a Thai tea, which was very good nondairy. Sometimes we would drink hot red tea. Spring rolls sometimes but they always came out with shrimp in them even though we said just vegetables. The food was nothing special, I just did not want to cook. I always put tons of saracha sp? In my soup.

Let me next state...the owner was ALWAYS nice to us. Period. She has never been rude at all, ever.

Ok now I start my review. The first few times we came in no one was ever in there. We ignored it. But now I definitely know why....

The first time I got sick (when I continue to mention the word ""sick"" I mean the Double Dragon lol or basically food poisoning) was far too long ago to know the date. I thought I was just sick. 

But about every other week either hubby or I was sick after we ate there. We stopped ordering tea and extras. We only drank water. We thought it was all in our heads.

We always ignored her political rants, her talking about certain views, values, customers, races etc.

Then I guess the more time we spent in there, we realized just how honestly dirty, filthy dirty, the place is. The communal toothpick holders sitting on the top corners of the booths...I would just stare at them from my seat. They have black dirt on them.

Everything is dirty.

The bathroom................go look for yourself, too afraid to take a pic or potty.

We bought my in-laws there once and she used the restroom...I'm embarrassed now...because that was prior to having seen it. 

She says that people complain about the swamp coolers, they need to just deal with it, people keep places too cold anyway.

She always complained about YELP, how everyone is rude, everyone says she makes them mad and that they don't come back because her political rants, etc.

She will know EXACTLY who I am when I post this, but honestly from the reviews here, she has said similar things to other people. That and we used to go several times a week. We never plan to go back, so whatever. 

THEN two times we ate there she spoke about how everyone was complaining about how dirty the place was! She said that all those people have germ issues and their houses and everywhere in the world is dirty. We always had something to talk about on the way home geeze...

The final straw was when we go to order and she tells my hubby that he has to eat Oxtail because she has no chicken. No chicken? Really? He really liked the chicken so I forced him, he had tried mine before, let's play nicey/nicey etc. etc.

Sick. We both got sick.

Why in the hell did we continue to eat there?

The basil, bean sprouts, lime and jalapeno were nice and fresh. Not always the case it seems when going to a pho restaurant. They use a wider rice noodle here than I have gotten anyplace else.

1409440,2010-11-06,1,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,"I've been to quite a few Vietnamese noodle restaurants (not only in the area of Las Vegas, but including places around So. Cal in Westminister, Nor. Cal, as well as some places around the world, like in Hong Kong, etc.) 

This is currently one of my favorite pho restaurants. There isn't many popular pho places around town other than the long-standing Pho So 1, Pho Kim Long, and Pho Saigon 8. This, according to the owner, has been open for approx. 1 year. There wasn't many people who were eating during the time of my visit (around 2pm on a Friday afternoon). We were greeted by the owner who introduced us to their different bowl sizes (S, M, and L) and their special challenge (XL? i guess it should be called?) which is finish in under 87 minutes and you get challenge paid for and $87 (you only get to challenge once, if u finish). 

Upon sight of the menu, it was not a large menu. 3 specialties of beef noodle soup (Pho), vermicelli noodles (Bun) and rice plate (Com). Prices were seemed decent for the bowl sizes. 

Both my friend and I ordered their #10 which was their special noodle soup with combination of beef. I had ordered a Large and he had ordered a medium. When the other owner came out with the orders, i was AMAZED ! Take note, the price difference for the #10 was $7 for small, $8 for medium, $9 for large (and a normal ""large"" bowl at pho so 1 was approx. $6.95?). This large, was AT LEAST double the amount of the larges everywhere else. The amount of meat they give you was maybe 1/2 a pound if not almost a pound. They also use a slightly wider flat rice noodle too.

Like most critics, for a noodle soup, the first thing to try, is the soup. First taste, wow. You can tell no MSG was used. It was a clean tasting smooth broth that wasn't overwhelming but it had its fill of flavor. As what a Cantonese person would call it, its a ""ching tong"" .. directly translated to be a clear soup. The male owner has been in the pho restaurant business for 23 years (since 1987). They have a restaurant near Chinatown in Downtown Los Angeles as well. 

Being a guy who doesn't eat a small amount compared to a lot of my friends, a large, was definitely a challenge for me to finish. At first i was hoping to finish the noodle and meat and drink at least 1/2 the soup, but by the time i finished the noodles and meat, i had no way of drinking the soup. It was very filling. 

On the side note, according to the female owner, ""the water is filtered and is free !"" also the water has a slight lemon flavor too, so probably has a container of ice water with slices of lemon ready to be served. 

For the price, its definitely worth its value. The owners were very friendly. The male owner/chef talked to us for quite a long time telling us stories of his younger years (he said he was 50 but looked mid 30s) ! man Asians look young. Maybe you'll get lucky and get to hear his stories ! quite amusing. Will recommend to friends and family.

What I couldn't get over though was how expensive everything was. I mean back at my favorite spot in San Diego I'm able to get 6 egg rolls and 2 medium bowls for the same price as my small bowl and 4 egg rolls.

We walked in at lunchtime on a Friday afternoon and saw only 3-tables occupied which should have been the first sign.  My son wanted a sandwich so we asked what I believe was the owner if she had any on the menu.  She replied ""we only sell pho, best in the world.""  OK, so my wife and I order the combination pho, meat outside.  One size bowl for $9, which in my eyes is highway robbery.  She wanted to charge $2 per person extra for the meat outside!  My son ended up eating chicken fried rice.

Food comes and no meat outside and none of the standard meatballs inside.  The fried rice was tasteless.  As for the pho?  Hardly the best in the world!  The rice noodles were the wide thai variety noodles and not the standard thin noodles.  The noodles were not cooked through.  The broth was just ""OK.""  Very little vegetables to add to the pho.  Even the water tasted funny.

The bill comes and we get charged for the meat outside even though they didn't bring it out to us.  Very pricey for sub-standard food.  To claim she has the best pho in the world is very gutsy when it is not.  She should take a vacation to Hawaii and eat at Hong Cafe in Chinatown to taste what real pho is all about.

My boyfriend took me and a few friends here after a long weekend of partying before flying out back to the Bay Area. It is located off strip in china town. It is about a $20 cab ride from center strip. We all ordered the oxtail pho which is suppose to be one of their specialties. The pho is pretty pricey. It costs twice as much as it would back home. However, it was packed with LOTS of meat and they certainly did not skimp out there. The broth was very flavorful and was even better with the hoisin and sriracha sauces. However, I didn't need to put as much as I would at other places to make it good. Our server was the owner and she was pretty comedic and provided great service. 

Yes, this place is overpriced just like any place on a strip, except this is located off strip. But the difference is, this place is actually good compared to any where on the strip.

It seems like the owners sleep in the restaurant, as there were some baby toys in the lefthand corner when you walk in, and in another corner with no chairs or tables set up, there was an older man laid out on some chairs, sleeping.  There was also what looked to be a shut down bar that was all taped up in the back of the restaurant.  So.  This is not really your super nice place to take the in-laws, fyi.

That being said, the food here is decent.  I would have only given it 3 stars but for the fact that I am a summer roll addict (the kind with both shrimp AND pork), and this place has some pretty tasty summer rolls.  The peanut sauce that comes with them is not cloyingly sweet like most other peanut sauces, and even though I usually eat my summer rolls with sriracha (another addiction of mine), I actually liked their peanut sauce so much I ate it.   Also, the pork inside of the summer rolls is nicely grilled and seasoned, which I prefer much to the dry-ish pork that a lot of other places used (not the patty kind that has the texture of bologna - I like that one!).  One last thing- (and yes I realize I just spent a paragraph talking about summer rolls), the price is a bit steeper than other places, but that's because they give you 3 (albeit pretty small) rolls, instead of the standard 2.  

As for the pho, it was pretty good.  I noticed that in vegas, most of the pho places (and I've tried many of them) don't have that oily soup that you see in a lot of places in la (you know, where you can see the oil circles floating at the top of the soup), but pho 87's broth is like that - richer and oilier.  And the flavor is pretty nice too, it definitely didn't taste like your average joe schmo beef stock.  So if you like that style of broth, then this is probably the place for you.  Also, if you're the kind of person who cares about this stuff, they give you real chopsticks and not disposable ones, and heavily lime their waters (take that as you will).  

Overall, I'd say you should try this place if the greasy big-stinky-burp-after-meal pho broth is what floast your boat.",7VhXchEryix_jrWv3ziRZg,1,0,3,eky8HxdMKecSRnfKOJrk0g

We had a group of 7 people and on a Friday night around 8pm, were one of only 2 or 3 parties in the restaurant. 

The service was attentive, and entertaining. I guess we had the pleasure of having the owner as our server. She was quick to get our orders taken, recommend appetizers and even tell us how to eat them. I was thoroughly amused when she informed us they didn't have any Asian beer because ""we support America!"" Disappointing, because a few of the people in our group were looking forward to a few Vietnamese beers they liked, but the humor the situation provided was worth it.

We ordered Egg Rolls for the table, they were absolutely delicious. They serve them with lettuce rolls, mint, basil and hot sauce and you can prepare them to your liking. They were flavorful, not too greasy for being fried, and the hot sauce was the perfect addition.

For meals, everyone ordered a variety of Pho. I had the #4 which seemed like the most basic and a good option for a first timer. Other than ordering too much (ordered the medium, but the small would have been plenty) everything was perfect. The broth had tons of flavor and mixed really well with the hot sauce. The meat was tender and the bean sprouts were so crispy and fresh!

With the 100F+ weather and hungry guys at our table, they don't want to find another place. So my other thought was, this better be good and worth it. Well, its not anywhere that you can find an oxtail pho as most have the traditional way, I do have to say this was some darn good soup! My husband loves soup and usually drink most of it, but rarely does he finish out the bowl. He sure did here. The lady who served us (i think she is the owner) was very proud of her soup and even said, ""glad you like our soup!"" He responded, I always drink the soup because I love soup. She was confidence to respond, ""Well I think its just here that you finish all the soup otherwise there is something wrong with your taste buds because we have the best soup."" The noodles are the thicker/wider ones than the traditional thin ones as well but not too big of a deal.

I ordered a vermicelli noodle (aka Bun) with egg rolls and grilled beef. This I can say, it was meh. Not bad but not the greatest. This I wouldn't pay again for as again its costly. (minus 1-star)

At first I have to say, the lady seemed very rude and rushy which I didn't like. Give and take I do have to say she was the only one working at that time. Attitude of the typical Asian but not like she was mad because throughout the meal, she talked more and had a good sense of humor, i guess. Again, knowing my husbands motto who believes in quality/flavor vs quantity with lower prices, he said he will come back just for the oxtail pho soup. 

Overall, if we were to come back, just go for their soup or shall I say oxtail soup which is different here and not anywhere else I know of has it. So for this, it may be worth it. Everything else, too expensive and you can get anywhere else.",qpActPt-ts9RRiZvn0n2KA,1,0,3,WdVtYIjocBwaZIA5uHEYJg

I love pho and regularly try out different places but Pho 87 is definitely the best. 

Firstly, the soup is always perfect. It's the right amount of flavorful and savory and not oily unlike other places I've been. You can taste the quality time after time. Even their noodles, flat rice noodles instead of regular thin rice noodles, are a unique addition to the taste. The small is enough to fill anybody's stomach perfectly, but people with bigger appetites can go for the medium or large which are ENORMOUS but will always be more than enough to satisfy the worst pho cravings no matter what size you choose. There are never a lot of people in there so you never have to wait long which is great, but with the quality of the pho here it deserves to be packed 24/7. 
I've taken tons of my family and friends here over the years and everyone has only had good things to say about this place. Even the owner, who my family has gotten to know from frequenting the place so much, is always on the floor getting to know the customers and talking to everyone.

She was very rude to my wife, and gave her the same nagging about people putting hoisan sauce on their pho, and basically called me a liar about the order not being complete.

When you go inside you will notice pink sheets of paper with signs stating, ""Only order water if you are going to drink it.""  and ""If our service isn't up to your standards, you should lower them.""  Sarcasm at it's best.  So I ordered Pho Ga one time and the owner brought out Pho Tai.  She told me she thought I said, ""Pho Tai.""

The pho bowls are big.  The broth is okay...  the noodles are not the typical noodles that you will find at other pho restaurants.  

I decided to give this place another shot.  I forgot how hot it was in there.  The restaurant is big with a weak air conditioner.  There are fans on top of tables to keep you cool, but to make sure your pho stays hot.

I took my friend here and she harrassed him too.  Questioned the way he ate his Pho and told him that he shouldn't put Chinese Ketchup (Hoison) because it ruins the broth.  She also asked him where he usually goes, and she mentioned that her restaurant was better. She didn't stop to comment once either. She came back every couple of minutes to see what he thought about the pho. After leaving, I apologized to my friend and said I don't plan on coming back. 

If you like big portions...  they definitely have big portions.  If you don't care about the kind of noodles, this place is ok.  If you want to lower your standards in Las Vegas or wherever you are from, you can come here and take pictures of the signs and post them on your wall.

pho is our [me, booboo, stan, ed, and benson`s] go-to hangover remedy after a night of hard partying in Vegas.  initially we were trying for Hash House A Go Go, but there was an 1.5 hour wait, so we decided to go elsewhere.  i hopped on my trusty Yelp app and searched for a restaurant close by.  Pho 87 popped up, and with a 4-star rating we figured, why not?  Yelp, for once you have failed me.

i ordered the medium pho bo, with the rare steak on the side.  the noodles were tough and plasticky, an indication of cheap quality noodles.  the broth was bland and oily.  i had to resort to pouring fish sauce in it; i NEVER pour anything in my soup.  even that couldn`t salvage it.  after about 6 bites, i stopped eating.  .

 
we all ordered the pho bo, with the exception of ed, who ordered the pho dac biet [combination pho].  booboo had also ordered his pho bo the same way i did, with the rare steak on the side.  the woman we ordered from screwed up and forgot.  the guy ended up bringing his pho out with the steak inside.  we were all starving, but not one of us were even remotely close finished our food; that was how bad it was.

BTW I'm from garden grove where pho bowls are 3.50 and 24/7

Something was wrong when the food runner couldnt speak Vietnamese. Man Where am I suppose to use my broken Vietnamese.

Let's start with the most obvious thing about this place, price

Bowls start at 10+ for a small which is already a decent size, but if you yelp nearby areas there are pho places with Vietnamese prices. I paid 16 for oxtail pho and I believe it was a medium size bowl? Maybe large I was full but I think i'd be fuller with 3 regular size bowls at other places. The quality wasn't bad, decent amount of meat, ALOT Of bones. Very fatty, yummy. But the point of going off strip is to get cheaper prices. 

Off the bat, there's a sign telling you to lower your standards, and you have to if you want to enjoy swallowing the price tag. 

Last time I paid 20 bucks for a bowl of pho is when I tried the Bowl Challenge in Ocean Beach San Diego. 

They have this pho challenge bowl for like 50 bucks if you don't finish it. I havent see any pictures of anything finishing it so i think its impossible. Kind of dumb that you're not allowed to split it with people. I just want to get that bowl and split it with people, waste of food if you're not allowed to split it... especially if you can't finish it. 

The owner lady is a little rude. 

They also have Kobe Beef Pho for 87.87 (wtf? more expensive than the pho challenge) as much as I am tempted to try that I rather just pay 30 for AYCE Kobe Korean BBQ. 

I think the only reason they're still i business because they have been featured on the food network. Once you're on that shit your restaurant is GOLDEN.

This is the only place I've had oxtail pho (I dunno...maybe I've just never noticed it on the menu at other pho joints haha) and I love it! The average person should definitely stick with the medium. If you're REALLY REALLY hungry, then get the large ($19), but it really is a LOT of food.

This past trip, I had one of the other pho choices on the menu (medium steak and flank I think) and it was your typical bowl of pho for $11.

The downsides here is the service and the interior decor. Despite that the restaurant is usually empty, you might find yourself twiddling your thumbs a bit before anyone comes out to check on you, take your order, and give you the bill. The woman is talkative and likes to chat you up if you're open to it haha. As for the decor...it's outdated and there's a stockpile of stuff in the corner (children's toys, bags of stuff). When you walk to the bathroom, there's a display case (like in a cafe) with food items in it...I wonder if anyone actually orders anything from that section...

Egg rolls were really good.  You can tell they were made fresh.  Spring rolls (summer rolls) were also made fresh and the peanut sauce that paired with it was pretty good/unique.

It's hard to ignore the rough interior and very run down appearance of the restaurant.  But when you get passed that and start to chow down, you know it was worth the price and wait.

Tip: for a normal person, a small size bowl of pho is more than enough.  I had some pretty good eaters with me and the large portion was way too much.",IOjwt-cRHwdenA63T_rt5w,0,1,4,XGcTsRFF79pjShcSWmgiyg

I've got a good sweat on after eating a hot bowl of Pho.  Those of you who are experts at Pho will know what I mean. 

I had an order of the deep fried spring rolls too.  The owner came by and told me i had to drink all the broth to even have a shot at the Godzilla bowl.  Done.  Broth is sloshing around inside my belly now.  The Godzilla bowl is 2.5 times what I just ate.  It will be close, but I think I might be able to pull it off with some prep work.  The killer part is the volume of the broth.  The noodles and beef will go down for sure.
The broth is super tasty so that might help me do it.  We will see.

So you need come check this place out.  Easy to get to from the strip. Straight up Flamingo towards the Rio.  Then right on Jones.  Easy-Peasy, Lemon Squeezy.

We ordered several combinations of Pho. I had the Ox Tail (medium) one. The broth was flavorful and the ingredients (ie. meat) were plentiful. Vegetables were fresh. With the Medium bowl already making us full, we were left to wonder who could possibly finish their Pho 87 challenge (that bowl equals 3 Large ones.)

The eggrolls and spring rolls were delicious.

I tried this place out months ago and I didnt think it deserved a review. The only reason why im doing this now is because I had a what I thought was a weird dream until I woke up and realized it was a nightmare!

Bare with me. So here's my my Nightmare on Pho Street. 

Me and my wife just happen to be driving down Jones Blvd wondering what to eat for dinner. We see the sign that they were on the food network. Can't go wrong with that right? So we mosy on in and see that it is a nice sized restaurant. I see plenty of tables but only see one person eating soup by herself. Weird because it was around 6:30 dinner time. Out of nowhere this old crazy lookin lady sits us down. 

I look at the menu and wonder if the prices were in Vietnamese knowing that the US dollar has slipped a little bit. So im thinkin a small bowl of pho and a small bowl of oxtail soup wasnt gonna max out my credit card. All the while the old asian lady was throwing out suggestions like an announcer at a horse track only with a heavy asian accent. ""You want try eggrolls?"" No thanks. ""How bout spring rolls?"" No thanks. ""You want order drink?"" No thanks just water. ""You wanna no soda?"" Just water.

So off she went to go submit our order. I don't know if she was mad or if it was normal because it sounded like she was having some sort of argument with what I assume was the cook. 

After about 8 minutes she brought out our food. My wife was in the bathroom at the time so I decided to to take the opportunity to photograph our food. All of a sudden the asian lady comes out of nowhere and says ""What you doing? You should eat the soup right away. It's good hot!"" I explained to her that I was about to take a picture and that I was waiting for my wife to come back. She just gave a ""I don't understand confused look."" 

The two stars are for the pho and oxtail soup. I thought it was tasty BUT that's the only positive thing. Since we both ordered small bowls, we weren't hungry any more but at the same time we could have eaten more. Kinda pricey for small bowls too. That and the ""Hurry up and buy!"" attitude of the old asian lady did not help either. Im not makin fun of her. All that I described was what actually happened.

So I guess you can say she was Freddy Krueger and we were the hapless sleeping victims. I don't think I will be coming back. If you want good Pho place at decent prices and better service, I recommend Pho So 1. That's my go to Pho place.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,15,2,2,z4C9Ksv1dibqql5hhy-3ag

I did couple pho places when I moved from OC to Vegas and PHO 87 is MY PHO place. They are closed on wednesday's.
We usually order the OX tail pho or the meat balls pho. The broth is so so good and flavorful. Mia always generously bring some sprouts, some basil
and lime so you can add it to your soup.
the OX tail is very tender and come out of the bones. The pho noodle is not the cheap one they usually serve you elsewhere, Mia's pho noodle is little larger and very soft just Yummy.
The price is little high compare to average. $14 for a small meatballs pho. $16/$17 for the small oxtail pho.
It's Worth it truly.
Once you finish your soup Mia usually offer you some sesame Mochi. Very fresh and crunchy!
For the BIG EATER she does a challenge PHOZILLA. You get a Super Large Pho bowl you must eat in 30mns (I believe) if you finish it, the pho is on her, if you don't ... too bad... you have to pay 
I saw a guy doing the challenge, he was filming himself. He didn't finish his bowl and was pissed he had to pay! Well it was the challenge! he knew!!!
TIPS... if you don't eat the noodle fast, the pho noodle are getting ducking the broth and grow in your bowl! so eat the noodle first and then drink the broth to Win the challenge! good luck!

She walked up to customers and started grabbing the food. She began telling them how to roll up the eggrolls and handed it to them to eat. I don't like people touching my food and trying to feed me.

2846819,2016-01-11,2,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,"This place is great! The people leaving bad reviews because they don't get the owner's humor need to realize one unwritten rule of Asian restaurants: the worse the customer service, the better the food tastes! Places with bad customer service, that have been in business for a while, only survive because their food is addicting and unmatched as far as quality. So it makes logical sense! 

Anyways, the claim that they have the best broth ever is definitely true. I grew up in Garden Grove, CA, the birthplace of pho restaurants, so I have tried them all and I can tell you that Pho 87 has them all beat. Their broth achieves a robust pot-roasty kind of taste without using any MSG--this is super rare and hard to do. We were treated to a free order of spring rolls while we waited, I've NEVER had spring rolls this fresh and satisfying! Keep in mind, the prices reflect the ultra-high quality and huge portion size!

If you just want a quick/cheap bowl of pho to kill your craving for the day, this place isn't for you. If you really want to indulge and have the best pho of your life, this is definitely the place to go. Your guests will be impressed!

When I saw the menu I was surprised at their high prices: $17 for small ox tail Pho and $24 for large. I ordered small and have to admit that there were quite a few ox tail pieces. Server also brought us a plenty of basil and lemon ( I would have preferred lime) and chopped hot peppers. I have to say the broth was tasty. So my friend warned me about the the owner/server. I wasn't sure what she meant but I soon found out what she meant. Maybe it's her sense of humor but she came across quite abrasive and opinionated and she talked non stop.

Owner/Server said, ""early dinner"" as I looked around and at my watch, I kindly nodded sure. Upon opening the door i found the décor a bit OVERWHELMING it was kinda like grocery store/temple/knick-knack store. Once we were seated it felt like a normal restaurant. Looking at the menu we found it to be a lil expensive than other Viet. restaurants.  We ordered a bowl of Pho and Banh mi grilled pork sandwich. For being the only 2 people in the place the food took longer than I expected.  Pho came out first and then approx. 9 mins later the sandwich arrived.  I mentioned the time bc I received this long explanation about why the sandwich came later than the soup. Story goes the lady making my sandwich abruptly left the restaurant and left the bread in the oven longer, so the bread became hard. So rather than make me a new sandwich they gave me the ROCK HARD sandwich but she did give me the option to for a new sandwich. I was just wondering why didn't she just make me a new one and give me the explanation why it took so long. 

Now the food... 
Pho broth was good, alil tastier than some places but may have been the MSG that other reviews have mentioned. A plus was the protein in the soup they really put a lot of beef. The sandwich was ehhh at best.  I took the rock hard sandwich bc I did not want to wait another 20 mins for the new one to be made.  Hue Thai and Mr. Lee's makes better ones.

What made me laugh was the random items in the restaurant ... I felt like I was at a garage sale with all the items just laying there.  There were a couple of big wheels, trampoline and a lot of broken items.  

Over-all, for a restaurant that was ""Featured on Food Network"" I was not impressed.  I'm not sure if it was this place that was featured or mockup restaurant with the same name.

The good: The pho came out quickly and tasted great. They did a great job keeping our water glasses filled. 

The bad: My 4-person party was black, parents-from-African-countries black, and unfortunately, this detail is relevant because 
1) one of the people serving us kept suggesting that the younger half of our table should get big and strong off of their pho so they could make lots of money playing professional basketball. Say it once and I can shrug it off, but he kept repeating it as if it landed the first time. This isn't how you make friends with people. Nothing about us suggested we even cared about basketball. In fact, one of us was wearing a European football club jersey. You wanna talk sports, we can talk sports, but repeatedly suggesting that we should get rich playing basketball when none of us have demonstrated any interest in even playing the sport is, at the very least, bad business. 
2) somewhere between the second and third offering of career advice, he talked about how American black people are dumber than black people from African countries as if we would agree with him. I want to follow this sentence up with something clever, but I'm just bummed out thinking about the experience.

The server/manager is a piece of work and when you ask questions about the items, she is extremely matter of fact and may come off as being rude.

You can definitely taste the ox tail they use to make the broth.  Most places don't use ox tail so the pho is not as flavorful.  

I was thinking about trying the Godzilla bowl, which if finished completely in 87 minutes, a jackpot of $600 is given.  FYI, the Godzilla bowl is 3x the size of the large bowl and I was stuffed after finishing the large bowl.  

My sister had vermicelli grilled beef (bun thit nuong) and she didn't think it was that great but that's her fault for going to a pho place and not ordering pho :)

The waitress at first seemed very brash and rude but I think she was just very busy when we first got there.  She was later very hospitable to our party and that was nice.

Service was friendly during my visit, though I was forgotten about after being seated for at least a good ten minutes (the owner/server apologized profusely after). 

I will echo what a lot of the other Yelpers have said. Prices are VERY high for the menu offerings, though it is a little better now since they offer a small portion priced around $10 (still pricey for pho). The owner lady has a crude sense of humor and does not hesitate to speak her mind, which is consistent with her political leanings (see other Yelp reviews). 

Yes, I was slightly put off by the comments I overheard, as well as a few signs that advertised books/pamphlets with topics like, ""Is your doctor slowly killing you?"" As a liberal, minority, pediatrics resident, there were multiple reasons for me to feel uncomfortable dining here. Fortunately for me, I was left pretty much alone and did not experience a negative dining experience.

So why the four stars? The oxtail pho was very tasty. The broth was piping hot and rich/flavorful, and there was a generous amount of oxtail meat even in the small pho portion that I ordered. The spring rolls were tasty (I agree that $9 is very overpriced, though you do get three large rolls), but came with a slightly different sauce and some basil flowers got included in the filling (should just be basil leaves). Overall, the quality and taste of the food justifies a four in my book.

Wow. Just left this restaurant after one of the most shaking restaurant experiences I've ever had. I'm still terrified because the disturbing experience I've just had was one in a million and not a good million either. Of all the restaurants I have visited in my lifetime, none has ever reached this level of repulsion. 
 
The general look of the place will have you questioning your choice immediately. There are posters, one in particular being very offensive (first attached below), and they all give the dining place a shady and unwelcoming feel. There are tons of natural medicine and anti-doctor propaganda and the aforementioned poster invites saving money for prostitution. Not to mention the Trump support shoved in your face as well.

Of course, you go to a restaurant for the food, not just the scenery. My family sat down and we ordered some Thai tea to-go and the owner refused our request because getting more plastic cups was ""too inconvenient"" for her. After almost an hour of waiting, our food finally arrived and it was unsurprisingly bad. The noodles tasted like slimy, chewy rubber bands and the fish sauce was overly spicy. The salad consisted of half a plate of rice and had half a strawberry in it??? It was definitely not worth the wait. One of my cousins ordered a bowl of pho and had a bad reaction to it due to his sensitivity to MSGs, a chemical that tastes good but is harmful to your body. My brother-in-law tried to order com tam, a common Vietnamese cuisine, but the owner rudely protested this idea. She began saying that the dish was only for poor people and that quote, ""This store is not for poor people.""

She apologized for the wait, but only because she had a single server active and that we, the large majority of her few customers, were ""too many people"" and that we should have ""come in small groups"". Um hello, we're a FAMILY. 
The owner also locked the front door and refused to let anyone else in for a while with no reasonable explanation. And let me tell you, eating in an enclosed room filled with dusty antiques and empty tables definitely feels creepy. I believe that she had done this because she could not afford any more customers since the service was so slow. After this, the owner desperately tries to compensate for the bad service with only one extra pitcher of water.

TLDR; Okay so this restaurant may not have been the best experience and I admit that it was my fault for staying longer than I should have but please, of all the delicious and extravagant meals in Vegas, please do not come here. You'll be greeted with natural medicine propaganda posters, empty tables, and an overly arrogant restaurant owner.

  The lady talks a lot to convince you to like her food. Plus everything according to her is ""amazing!"" hah! She's a business owner, though, that's her job. The pho is expensive but tasty. The broth was veeery tasty. I really liked the broth. Another review on here said the broth was clear, but that was absolutely not the case this trip. I was actually going to joke that I don't want to start rumors, but it may be part of the same broth from when they opened, but apparently that's not the case. I did not really care for the noodles though. They were thicker than what I'm used to. Call me a purist, I do like the thinner noodles. The side veggie plate was good quality. They add a TON of stuff to the bowl. That's how she justifies the price. I understand the line of thinking, but I simply can't eat that much, so it's kind of a waste for me to go there knowing I'm going to spend $11 on a bowl that I may not eat all of, and pho doesn't keep well enough to take home, plus I don't totally like it. 
 The Pho-Zilla, which the food network went there for is three pounds of the noodles and soup. (meat too? I don't remember.) 
  I went back to try the Vietnamese sandwiches. Eh.. They are not on crispy French bread. It's on some type of roll. It wasn't bad. It was...eh. The quality of the veggies was good, but I know I won't get banh mi there again. 
   As far as the ambiance, when you walk in, there's stuff that she sells. She doesn't really push these things though, which is nice. However, at the table we were sitting at, there was a strange print out pushing the book that she carries. Something about ""your doctor is trying to kill you""... haha.. again, she's quirky. And she did mention during our meal that our soup was going to help us to not catch a cold. We don't need medicine. 
 There were toothpick dispensers  every two posts, so that's weird. I would think one on the way out would be fine. Plus when you look in the light, you can see all the fingerprints on them, and I know there weren't that many people there that day. so, ew. There was also a corner with kids toys... and.. again, ew. I think if a public place has kid toys, they should be plastic based with a tub of disinfectant wipes nearby. But that's me. 
  Plus there are these HUGE signs hanging in the back touting the 3 for 1 banh mi and 3 for 1 desserts. It just seems weird.

This doesn't necessarily seem like a positive review, but, again, I really liked the lady.  I want her to do well, but I think she should take down the signs and flyers, wipe it down, make her prices a little more competitive, and maybe it will be a bit more appealing.

3663476,2015-08-24,0,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,"On a beautiful (if you're from the Desert Southwest, as I am) mid-Saturday afternoon on the way home from Fashion Show, I noticed a large billboard near the Spring Mountain Rd/I-15 interchange for Pho 87.  Being (ravenously) hungry, and knowing the wife and daughter can't ever turn down some good Pho, I cut off some tourists and got out of the on-ramp lane and headed over to Spring Mountain Rd and Jones to Pho 87.  Quick tip:  It's not like a lot of places in Vegas or LA, with a big sign, it's actually a separate building in a very small strip center about 100 yards south of Spring Mountain Rd on Jones (on the E side of Jones.  I actually overshot the place and had to turn back around.

To the details...

Atmosphere:  This is complicated...  So we were the only customers at around 2:30 PM on a Saturday.  I guess not a lot of folks want hot, steaming, star-anise scented beef broth when it's 108 degrees outside, but I did.  We were greeted by the owner and she's quite the character, but not in a bad way.  It helps to understand that some of the directness and word choices are part of having English as a second language and not some personal attack.Anyway, there are a lot of knickknacks around but we were led to a nice table - which doesn't always happen when you're the only guests - and given three menus in English.  The chairs were fine, table was clean, there were bottles of Hoisin and Sriracha sauce as well as spoons, chopsticks, and napkins at the table.

Service:  I loved it.  There was give-and-take banter with the owner about my expectations as a ""foreigner"" (she didn't use the word...didn't have to), and it was obvious she was extremely proud of the fact that her Pho broth had been featured on both the Food Network and the Travel Channel.  On top of that, service was prompt and not overbearing.  In fact, one of the kitchen staff (I saw 3 people while there, a cook, a guy of indeterminate position, but looking like kitchen staff, and the owner who was acting as hostess/wait staff) noticed my drink was low and asked if I needed a refill and got it quickly and professionally.  When I ordered the Ox Tail Pho, the owner quipped, ""Have you been here before or been to Vietnam?""  When I said no, she said, ""Oh, that's strange, we don't get many white guys ordering that on their own without asking about it.""  I told her I had lived 10 years in Korea where Ox Tail Soup is a delicacy and she nodded and responded with, ""It had to be something, I knew it, it's not a white person dish.""  I thought that was hilarious.

Food:  I ordered, as I said, the Ox Tail Pho.  I've not ever seen Ox Tail Pho on a menu, and, for the Pho connoisseur, the menu might be a disappointment.  They don't have 20 kinds of meat combinations, just the standard beef, beef tripe, meatball, chicken, and ox tail.  (There may have been 1 more, but I don't remember it.)  However, the owner, in describing her Pho broth bragged about having a 24-hour broth reduction going and she went on about how much care she put into both the smell and the taste of the Pho stock.  She was right.The taste...well...I've had Pho all over the world (but never in Vietnam, unfortunately) and this was the best I've ever had.  You could really taste 24 hours of bones, cartilage, and whatever else goodness they had in the stock pots in the back.  It was, hands down, the best damn soup broth I've had.  Period.  I added some of the veggies (basil, bean sprouts, quick hit of fresh lime) but didn't have to add any of the sauces.  The Pho came with noodles, thinly sliced onions, and ox tail.  Tons and tons of ox tail.  I was shocked with the amount of meat in the bowl.  Normally, that's where you get the skimping at.  Not here.  There were 5-6 sections in my soup, even though I ordered a small.  The amount of meat explains the price...the prices are EXTREMELY reasonable given the amount of beef you get (at least with ox tail).

Facilities:  Here's the rub, I didn't have an issue with anything, but my wife had to use the restroom and noted that they didn't smell clean, didn't look clean, and there were way too many objets d'art all over the place which led her to question if anything ever got cleaned or thrown out.  She was so disappointed by this she said she personally would not eat there in the future because it made her wonder what the kitchen was like.  And she's Korean.  So I've knocked it down a star because any future visit will either involve an argument with the wife or going solo.

Overall:  When I want Pho, this is the place I will go to...or wait to come back to.  You can't get broth like this anywhere except maybe L.A. where the owner's father's original restaurant is/was (unclear from discussion).",4YsCuWxw7E9uZ6XCSzF2sg,0,0,4,13RY0cu1r0TJiO1UjTzYmg

3710108,2012-04-06,2,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,"After driving past Pho 87 for many months, I decided to read the yelp reviews of this establishment.  I was a bit skeptical about the reviews, relating to how great everyone felt the food was.  After all it's just Pho.  

I have to admit I completely underestimated the food, as well as the atmosphere.  I was expecting a tiny dingy restaurant.  What I found was a very nice, clean restaurant, with attentive staff and outstanding dishes.  

The menu is fairly limited to Pho and noodle style dishes, but the depth of flavors in the food made me wonder why it had taken me so long to walk in these doors.  

I had eaten a late lunch and was not really hungry, but decided to accompany my family to Pho 87 to ""have a drink and watch them eat"".  When we arrived I decided to order a noodle dish with egg roll and pork in it, and thought I'd enjoy leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  The meal was $9.00 which was on the high end of the menu prices.

Once I started eating, I couldn't put my chop sticks down until I was at the bottom of a very large bowl of veggies, spices, fish sauce, pork, egg roll (I also added a bit of hot sauce to the equation).  If the bowl was larger (which I am glad it was not), I would have continued to eat more even though I was not hungry walking in the door.

The other three people I was with each ordered differing Pho dishes (The medium bowl is a very large portion).  I saw the bottom of all of their bowls, as well as the smiles on their teeth.

If you are a fan of Viet Nam food (or is it Phood), you should add this to your list of ""lets give this a try"" places.",HEtJsyLYSkxOQiH0GUOuTQ,1,1,5,kQG4rb5PHzBfDot77qUt-g

We had the pho and the noodles and broth had a wrong texture or mix.  The noodles need to be al dente but it was overcooked.  I thought the meat was tender but the broth lacked something.

3795974,2013-08-30,1,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,"Best Pho broth I've ever tasted.. well done!
The menu here isn't as wide as other Vietnamese restaurants.. it seems like they want to concentrate mostly on their Pho selections. I don't blame them, it's some amazing soup. A little overpriced for Pho, but well worth it. They use fat rice noodles for their soup which filled you up pretty fast. I had a medium-sized bowl and could barely finish it. I definitely prefer the regular sized ones instead. 
My girlfriend ordered the oxtail Pho.. delicious! The meat was so tender and came off the bone with ease. 

If you're thinking about doing the challenge, be aware! It's seems pretty impossible if you're not a professional eater. Don't let the pictures fool you, the bowl is gigantic. My friend tried it just for the experience and failed miserably. The noodles continued to soak up the broth making them fatter and fatter over time. By the time he gave up, it looked like he barely started the challenge. The owner will continue to warn and discourage you about this challenge.. I'd take her advice and just enjoy the soup in a regular-sized bowl.

The restaurant itself is kind of gross. There's all these random products scattered around tables that the owner is trying to sell. The back area headed towards the bathroom is filthy and disgusting. There's crap everywhere and the bathroom area smelled like straight sewage. It kind of makes me nervous about what I'm eating. I'm afraid to know what the kitchen area looks like.

My order came out quickly as expected.  

The noodles did not stick together when I stirred and mixed the contents of the bowl.  There was a surprising amount of meat. Although I am no pho expert, I thought the broth tasted fine: not too salty, hints of sweetness and tartness.  I quickly finished my order of pho while chatting with the owner.  

The owner was super friendly and nice, the broth tasted fine, and I appreciate the fact they offer different sizes of pho.  I would definitely come back again if I am in the mood for pho.

Now for the results of the scouting mission:  the size of the pho challenge bowl is BIG, the contents of 2-3 large bowls could easily fit into it.  It consissts of 1.5 pounds of noodles, 1.5 pounds of meat and the rest is broth.  They require you to finish all the noodles and meat, but are a little flexible on finishing all the broth.

The noodles weren't cooked, they gave me raw meat, the broth didn't have any green onions or white onions and there was no condiments. I didn't know I had to ask for limes, mint, jalapeños & hoisin sauce and sriracha at a Vietnamese restaurant. If I wanted to make pho myself, then I'd go to the store. I really expected everything to be done for me as to be expected from any take out. When I called them back to ask why this is all raw. She said it conserves the nutrients. Its pho. Its meat noodles and broth because apparently this place doesn't believe in vegetables. In my case, just meat and noodles.

After seeing the Pho 87 challenge on the Food Network,  my brother-in-law and I went to Las Vegas specifically to go to Pho 87, so he could try the challenge.  Trust me, my brother-in-law can eat.  A few days before the challenge, he went to a local Pho restaurant in Southern California to practice and was able to complete 2 lb of beef, 2 lb of noodles and 2 big bowls of broth in around half an hour. One thing the restaurant asks, is that if you're going to participate in the challenge, that you call about 1 hr ahead.
That was a mistake.  Here are the details:
We arrive at the restaurant and my brother-in-law decides on the Pho with flank steak and brisket.  I decided to have the lobster fried rice.

First to the lobster fried rice. In short, bland, poor presentation, and not a lot of lobster. Not worth the $20. I make better fried rice!  There's a small great Thai restaurant that near my work makes pineapple fried rice with chicken and shrimp, that blows this Pho 87 lobster dish away.

Now for the Pho challenge. When brought to the table, looked like tons of noodles and meat, with very little broth. My brother-in-law dug right in. He said it was very bland and tasteless. No basil, bean sprouts, or limes, and the noodles were thick and gummy, but initially tolerable, however, there was no broth!  He was a trooper, but 5 minutes later, the noodles were now mushy and like library paste.  Apparently, they have you call ahead so they can soak the noodles and it expands them, so there goes all the broth. Basically, the restaurant cheats.  A couple of diners at the next table had bowls of Pho and the noodles appeared to ""wiggle"" as noodles should.

I could go on and on, but to sum it up, my brother-in-law gave up, as he just couldn't swallow it anymore!. He also stated that the Pho at this restaurant (at least the one they serve for the challenge) is the most tasteless, disgusting meal he ever had in his life. We would not recommend doing the challenge unless you are a masochist. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at all.  Food was not good and the service was terrible.",ExSallQDn7f8Oc2VfpC1Bg,2,0,1,_CB33oX-PImV8qRfYRgxwQ

We asked for ice water even before we sat down, but didn't get it until we asked for it again.  The waitress brought us the menus and came back within a minute to take our order; she stood there waiting for us as we perused the menu.  We asked her to come back and she did so twice.  She was very impatient!  It was so expensive that I wanted to walk out, but my husband would not do so.  The menu items were so limited and the price was so expensive.  So we ordered.  We finished our water so quickly, but never got a refill.  After taking our order, she pretty much ignored us until we got her attention when we were ready to pay.  She was mostly reading her newspaper and watching TV.

We saw that she and her young daughter, probably around 8sh, were preparing our ice water.  The daughter helped to bring it over to our table.  About 10 minutes later, our food came out.  The veggies dish for pho was so small compared to other places we've been at.  The bowl of pho was so small that my young son ate the whole bowl by himself.  The pork fried rice didn't look that good, just rice, some pork, and green onion; it was the worst fried rice I've had.

When we're ready to pay, we tried to make contact with the owner/waitress, but she didn't bother looking up, but kept reading her newspaper.  My husband walked up to the counter and finally got her attention 5 minutes later.  He left her some tip.  I said no tip, but he persisted and she got her tip.

I was shocked that on the menu, they stated, ""If you don't like the service, lower your standards.""  Really!?  The service definitely has much to be desired.

I found out about this place because of Food Network...as it was the only PHO PLACE to ever be featured on the food network. In addition, it was one the FEW pho places to have a PHO CHALLENGE. I was a big FOODIE/MAN vs. Food wanna-be, so I was huge on FOOD CHALLENGES or LARGE PORTIONS OF FOOD.

The restaurant and location was very easy to spot, it had the freakin FOOD NETWORK advertisement on it too!

Upon arrival, the first couple of things that you would see were the different sizes of the bowls they had owned and the huge grand prized check for winning the pho challenge. 

Let me tell you...THE PHO CHALLENGE BOWL IS HUGE...and to knowledge...there has ONLY been ONE PERSON to EVER finish the CHALLENGE...which I find is slightly incorrect. IF THE INCREDIBLE HULK WERE TO ORDER A BOWL OF PHO...it would be that! The thing that surprised me the most was that the person who finished the challenge was a normal sized, non-obese, asian female. WEIRD RIGHT? Either this female had some amazing swallowing attributes or that the people in VEGAS just arent into food challenges.

Going onto the food, this place isnt your ordinary PHO place...it is quite pricey...but pricey for a GUUD reason. Ok, I understand that paying $15 for an XL large is insane, but hey....the food was guud, very enjoyable, more bang for your buck aka LARGE portions...and plus...everything (or most things) in VEGAS are expensive

They also had FILET MIGNON pho...i think it was priced near a$100?? and the WHITE BOY SPECIAL (chicken pho) which gave me a chuckle when I read the label.

The noodles at this location were different. The noodles were still rice noodles, but THICKER! Never had them this thick before, but they still tasted awesome. Its always nice to have something new. 

The soup....THE BEST THAT IVE EVER HAD! Something about this place just made the soup very enjoyable and made my stomach extremely happy. The taste, the flavor, the color were all indescribable...indescribable in a guud way!

OVERALL...I REALLY love this place and I WILL ALWAYS VISIT THIS PLACE ONCE WHILE IM IN LAS VEGAS. This is my go to spot and it is my HANGOVER CURE after a crazy weekend.

Having tried many pho here in Vegas, I have to say this is near the top of my list. Come here, you won't be disappointed. Its one of the best Pho places in town. It still no comparison for the stuff in Westminister however. 

The large bowl is really large, making other pho places large look like a small. The broth is good, but its a different kind of good. The broth is a cleaner lighter tasting broth, than the more rich and heavy tasting broth many are use to. The owners swear by it.

The noodles aren't really anything special the times I ate here. Very little to no flavor like most of the other places in town.

They're desert menu is bigger than most of the smaller restaurant, but still pales in comparison. The coconut desert was satisfactory.

This is one of the few places where the owners aren't afraid to talk to their customers. One of the owners is very bold and not afraid to dish out the insults. Like one time, our co-workers was taking a long time to order. So she comes over and say, what's taking so long to make a decision? You're only out $8 if you make a bad choice. If a girl asks you to jump into bed, you don't have a second thought about it. You could have a baby or get a STD. But you take so long to make a $8 decision. Yup, she seriously told us that. Holy crap! We quickly ordered thereafter. It was a memorable moment indeed!

They also have the Pho Challenge. The bowl is literally the size of a Kitchen Aid stand mixer bowl. You have to finish 2 lbs of rice noodle, 2 lbs of beef, 1lb of beef balls, and the broth in 30 minutes! Absolutely ridiculous. I try to convince the owners to make it at least feasible, but having to finish all the broth is just insane. This makes the Pho Garden challenge look like childs play. I will attempt it by the end of the year, determined to!

Good pho broth, but disappointing subpar noodles. The staff makes this a great place to come and eat. The Pho Challenge will be my ultimate food challenge that I must conquer!",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,3,2,3,NW0ENnxmDgFWX7ZPohP16A
4674124,2016-05-24,4,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,"TL:DR - Best Pho in LV (JUST THE PHO), super weird vibe, off humor boss lady, expensive prices.


If you're purely looking for the best Pho in Las Vegas, this is your shop. The rest of the items are not that good, but their Pho is would be a grade above all the other houses in town. They use a different noodle that provides a very chewy consistency, and the sliced meats are pretty good as well. The oxtail is a poached oxtail and it is highly beefy, you can definitely tell that there was effort in this bowl of Pho. But, I would say that the shining star would be the broth, as the broth doesn't leave you all dehydrated after (indication of no/minimal MSG). At the end of the meal they provide a free mini dessert, a freshly fried sesame ball! (Picture included) It definitely beats out any fortune cookie or small candy that the other places give.

Now onto the weird stuff. This place has a very unique vibe that wouldn't appeal to many. It's basically an empty Chinese buffet that left behind all it's decor. There are also a lot of weird products and propaganda in this restaurant. You will find health books, natural supplements, and even Asian trinkets for sale in this place. The signs made of paper on the wall have some weird sayings, as if it was a bad attempt to be funny. One good thing though, is that this place is always empty, so its a nice place to really talk and eat with someone. (if they're not weirded out about the vibe)

The owner of the place has a different sense of humor, but she is very friendly once you get acquainted with her. Beware, one of her pet peeves is if you add the traditional Vietnamese Hoisin/Siracha into her broth before you actually try it. It does make sense though, as her broth is indeed well crafted. BTW she is also a Trump supporter so if you're sensitive to that stuff, just skip this place.

As for the pricing of this place, it is very expensive. Very Very Expensive. A bowl of Pho and a drink can easily cost you $25 after tax/tip. The restaurant did try to update their menu with a more appropriately portioned sizes for less money, which is a good sign, however their Small @ 11-15 dollar range is smaller than you would expect. The shrimp/pork spring rolls are ridiculous at $9 an order, and the fried rice is just not worth its money. My recommendations here would just be Pho and ice water. Maybe a $4 Thai Iced Tea, as their Thai Tea is pretty good here. (Not watered down, quality dairy)",3gX0SnispHbO2QRdGipt0g,4,1,4,pdJlY3I6qKOxI0NX-M8pKg

The coconut juice is double priced though when a can of juice can be bought at an asian store for less than $2, but you're charged DOUBLE here with NO REFILLS. Boo to that part. There are signs in the restaurant that may offend some people so you have to have a little bit of a sense of humor and come in with an open mind. You'll see what I mean if you give this place a try. Mia the owner speaks her mind when it comes to food they offer. She is not shy about replying to criticism about anything regarding her business. The first time my husband and I came to eat here i told him I never wanted to come here again because I thought she was rude, but the soup was so good I gave it another try and we've been coming back since. You either love her or you hate her. And I've decided to like her because the food is delish and she's accommodating to my kids.

The other interesting thing at Pho 87 is the hostess.  She has the kind of humor where she'll insult you to your face throughout the night without so much as cracking a smile...it may work for some, others not so much.  For myself I wasn't particularly in the mood for the peanut gallery that night (much less from our server), but I can see myself getting a kick out of it on a different day.

Food pricing seemed kind of steep; pho comes in four sizes: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng?select=MLarFzHf2ilmdTVc5_ek7w.  For the most part it was along the lines of $7.00 for small, $8.00 for medium, $9.00 for large & $30 for the challenge.  Pho is just okay, broth was nothing special.  Noodles were good but nothing to make me crave Pho 87.  We also tried some spring rolls, of the pork (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng?select=S1gDi5mmQgkydd-blLzV2Q) and shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng?select=l8tBxk3n206Gl4MufktExQ) varieties.  Pork seemed tasty, but you only get a tiny sliver of meat in each roll.  Shrimp wasn't anything special, but again, very little shrimp inside.

The following sign is posted near the entrance: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng?select=6lcr69pu34x-rRZqSRWRNg.  For me, it's not so much about standards as it is about mood.

$9 for 6 egg rolls. $7 the small sized bowl of pho. Am I at a Vietnamese place? 

The owner had a wry sense of humor, as evidenced by the signs on the wall. I appreciate her trying to joke around with us. That didn't make the pho taste any better. I couldn't smell any of the spices in the pho. It tasted like canned beef broth with meat and noodles. It wasn't mediocre pho; it was outright bland, tasteless pho. 

We were also overcharged by $10. The owner said she made a mistake and made some joke about being the only Asian to ever fail math. It seemed a little suspicious to me that she was able to write the correct sum of our charges, but when she added the $4 tax, it somehow became a $14 tax.

Enjoyed the service. Mia was funny and checked on us often.

The environment was big, but barely anyone was in it. I didn't care because the food was good. My fiance liked it too.

I was looking for something different for dinner, guess I found it.
The place is not much to look at, there are piles of toys and stuff all over.
The various signs taped up everywhere were a cute diversion since I was alone.
I was concerned after walking in since it was 5:30ish and the restaurant was empty, but hey I was here and looking forward to trying their Pho.

The lady was nice, maybe because I was the only one there, she was happy that I had found the place on my own and not told to come.
I wanted to try their spring rolls and ordered a medium vegetable Pho and the spring rolls.
She said it was probably too much and a small would be good, so I went with that.

First I made a look when she brought out the spring rolls. I have never had a spring roll fried. Anyways the face I made prompted her to show me the proper way to eat them, lettuce, couple basil leaves and then the spring roll wrapped in it, dip in the sauce (hold up so you don't spill on yourself, she reminded me frequently)

Very filling and probably shouldn't have been bought for just myself.

The Pho came out hot and with a large helping of add-ins.
I always try the broth straight, shouldn't ruin anything by seasoning without tasting.
Very thick with flavor so I just added in the basil, sprouts, and peppers and thoroughly mixed it up.

Beautiful broth and delicious soup, which it should be for the cost.

Pricey and tacky, maybe it would have been different if packed and the children were entertaining themselves with the various piles of stuff instead of being annoying,

Will I come back? Maybe, but I will have to save up so I can afford the oxtail pho.

Signs throughout are funny. Waitress was personable, too. Abrupt, business-like, but still able to joke with us.

Food: great. Yes, the service was glacial, but sometimes good things are worth waiting for. I ordered a small seafood pho soup, and had enough left over for another entire meal to take home for later (and it was just as good later). Jim finished his, but was pretty slow towards the end.

4974482,2010-10-03,11,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,"Another review from an UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) where we had 4 participants who accepted the Pho Challenge that day (Jen S., Bobby Y., James A., and Robert R.) out of our party of 20+ diners.

We gathered at the two tables to the right, at the front of the restaurant near the fish tank with the lone gigantic fish (who I think has been eating too much pho during its lifetime).  

It's a pretty simple menu, with pho prices ranging from $7-8 for a small, $8-9 for a medium, $9-10 for a large.  And of course, we can't ignore the gigantic bowl for $30 (if you can't finish it in the allocated time).  At a first glance, I would say it's a bit pricier here for standard pho.  The better value is to go for the large pho portions, and then it's not as expensive.  (I think it's probably a better value for two people to share a large, but the waitress strongly discourages sharing pho since it changes the temperature of the soup, etc. etc.)

The Husband went for the $10 large bowl of oxtail soup pho.  It's a pretty big bowl with lots of oxtail meat present, so I think he definitely got his bang for his buck.  Whereas I went for one of the regular pho bowls, size small for $7, and it was just okay.  The meat portions are on the smaller end. I'm used to seeing larger cuts of rare beef, but that wasn't the case here.  Also, my soup was just warm and the Husband concurred the same about his broth.

I also got to try two variations of their spring rolls - the shrimp and pork ones.  I liked the shrimp ones better since they grilled the shrimp prior to putting it in the wrapper.  The pork ones were just okay.

The waitress was a bit anxious with trying to figure out how many people were going to compete, and it was pretty early on when we told her it was going to be four.  She said the cook needed to know how much meat to cut up.  Everyone wanted rare beef only in their pho, and she checked with the kitchen to make sure they could do this and they said yes.  I did ask her if she could serve the competitors first since they had 87 minutes to eat, and the rest of us could get our food last.  In the end, everyone else got their food and finished it long before the four competitors even saw their bowl of pho.  This was definitely not an efficient use of time at all and I think it also affected those who were competing. 

When the challenge bowls of pho did arrive, it definitely looked like it was more noodles than beef.  It's supposed to be 1.5 pounds of beef, 1.5 pounds of noodles, and broth.  The broth isn't such a high priority to finish since she said that by the end, there's usually not that much broth left anyway.  It was super hot when it arrived too.  (Guess that's where all the hot broth went!)  James A. came really close to finishing and he even brought his leftovers home (and finished them).  Word is that him and Robert R. might go for round two!   

Pho 87 is a pretty large restaurant from the other Vietnamese restaurants in town, and a bit fancier.  There's a whole set up in the back that makes you wonder if they offer some kind of lunch buffet since they have those self service hot stations.

Service definitely makes for an 'interesting' and 'entertaining' experience.  The waitress assigned to us definitely has comments coming from left field that probably are not the most politically correct.  She spent a lot of time discouraging us from participating in the challenge in the beginning, then she encouraged the females in our group to 'give a show' to encourage our male friends who were competing...comments about flashing and fake boobs were included.

If you do complete the Pho 87 Challenge, your bowl of pho is free, as well as the bowl.  And she said they'll put your face on a billboard!  She said no one in Las Vegas has completed their challenge yet, but a few from Los Angeles has at their other location.  (Apparently she really wants a "" white boy"" on the billboard!)

It's hard opening yet another pho restaurant in Las Vegas.  Props to them for creating a hook that will bring the customers in.  Not sure if it's enough to make it a regular joint though.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,11,11,3,Q4oZzLgv9peWa7hDtZoboA

However, for the price, ($22 for a large oxtail pho, $18 for a large pho tai), I would not return here.  The pho was good but not mind blowing or life changing.  

Also, the restaurant literally looked closed and I was actually quite worried that we would have to go somewhere else as our cab approached the building.

Most rice plates that say its like pork plate but normally comes with shredded pork tripe, egg loaf, etc. I couldn't actually tell if my pork was pork. It tasted like beef almost. It's jasmine rice, not Viet broken rice. 

I tried Elninos chicken pho which had a clean gingery broth which reminds me of Filipino chicken tinola soup. Pretty decent. I ordered the wrong thing .My drink, a fresh cut coconut was yum- fresh and cold.

Our server was pretty sassy and funny saying things like if you have fake boobs flash them while they eat pho! LOL and a WTF moment. I wouldn't flash my boobs, but does this mean big naturals aren't good then?! Haha.

Started off with the Oxtail Pho. This was around $12 if I remember correctly...but DELICIOUS! Easily the best Oxtail Pho I've had before.  The meat was super tender and soaked up lots of flavor. Complimented well by all the oil in the soup!

Speaking of oil...the Pho Tai is LOADED with it. There is a TON of oil in the broth...so it did have flavor, but it was also super oily.  I don't think I have ever seen that much before in Pho (attached a pic for reference)!  It was about $10 and the portion size is a bit small considering the price.  

Since the prices are high, portions are small, and the pho tai didn't impress...I doubt I will be back.  Unless I was ordering the Oxtail pho of course!

The broth is top notch, likely top 5 in my book. I don't get down to Westminster that much, but I put this place near the pinnacle that Golden Deli in SGV holds for me. Obviously, they take a lot of time making the broth from scratch. It has just the right amount of fat and star anise. As always, I ordered the Pho Dac Biet, and the meat and offal were of very high quality. The noodles had an excellent bite.

We also ordered the Chiao Ga and the Goi Coun. Both were excellent. The shrimp and the pork in the Goi Coun were actually charred on the grill. I though that was an excellent touch. The veggies in the Goi  Coun were obviously extremely fresh. I prefer egg rolls with the rice paper that crackles when it's fried, but not going to complain about these. They were great. 

Come for the the Pho. You will be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable bowl of Pho. It comes in 4 sizes (small, med, large and stupid). If you want to find the Adam Richman in you, go for the challenge, and maybe you'll win some dough. The pot was up $600 when were there last week.

5199253,2010-07-14,7,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,"Black sheep alert! I have a peculiar standard for judging my pho places--what comes in the veggie pho. Yes, I understand that it is oxtail soup and perhaps having the veggie variety defeats the purpose, but for me, there is nothing finer than a pho full of green delights. Make the broth with oxtail or other meaty parts, but bring it to me with leaves and things. Pho 87 was a disappointment.

Their veggie pho comes with onions, and maybe I am a greedy green monster, but I want bok choy and celery and carrots and broccoli and... The plate of side veggies was fresh, but small. Plus, for the little portion of tofu they added to the bowl, they charged $2. With the tofu surcharge, the pho was a relatively expensive offering. Nothing is quite as saddening as expensive pho, except perhaps expensive Thai. 

As for the broth, it was definitely clean, which for me means plain. It wasn't complex or flavorful. Perhaps, I have been swayed by MSG in other pho or perhaps it was a bad night, but I don't know for certain. For me, it was missing some sweetness. The predominant flavor profile was a sourness.

The service was quirky in a fun? way. When we arrived, the proprietor was chowing down on an ear of corn, and she joked, ""This is not on the menu,"" as she led us to the table with menus in one hand and cob in the other. They did have an interesting sign that said something along the lines of: ""If our food or service doesn't meet your standards, lower your standards.""

My standards will lead me elsewhere for my veggie pho fix. 2.5 stars for the possibility that if you're a meat eater you might find a tastier treat.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,6,2,UPh90LM8UMnVFQP6NGktrA

I've been there a total of three times now. The lady watiress/owner, from the first time she TALKED, I already knew she was a rude one. However, it's an Asian place so it's expected. So I ignored her attitude, ignored her snide/not-so-funny comments, and just ate my food because that's what I went for. Plus I always go with a group of 6 or more people so I always have my friends to chat with and make jokes with. That way, her little signs of lowering my standards won't be so annoying. 


But our recent trip was, by far, the worst. THE WORST. I don't think I've ever been treated this poorly in any Asian restaurant. And trust me, I've been to plenty. 


I wasn't really feeling all that well and that's why my friends were willing to go to pho instead of the originally planned ramen shop. Bad idea. I think my stomach would've preferred the thick ramen soup. 


The wait for water/soda: 40+ minutes
The wait for pho: 1 hour and then some


The wait for the food was so long that my stomach had begun hurting before the food got here. And even when the food DID get here, the food did not help cause the damage was already done. So instead of sitting back and relaxing in contentment of a full stomach, I was busy cringing in pain. Who the shit serves pho an hour after the order? 

So my boyfriend brought me a bottle of vitamin c tablets for me to take prior to everything. It was a new bottle, so all the plastic wrapping and cotton inside was put on the table cause where else are we going to put it? So what did the owner say when she took our orders?

""CLEAN UP YOUR MESS PLEASE.""


THE FUCK, LADY? You think YOU won't have to clean up the mess AFTER we eat? Or what? We eat and WE CLEAN the TABLE FOR YOU BEFORE WE GO? The shit?


Needless to say, we didn't tip much and got a sarcastic comment from her because of it. ""THANKS FOR THE HUGE TIP!! You're so GENEROUS!"" Then she repeated it as we were walking out the door. Why do I have to tip you if you're going to take an hour to bring out pho? ONE HOUR. ONE HOUR. ONE HOUR. LET ME REPEAT. ONE HOUR. I normally can get in and out of a restaurant in one hour, not wait for water and food for an hour. 


Oh, the food wasn't anything that special either.


But yeah, I suppose you can blame us for not leaving asap but I was trying to not to be rude to people and in front of my friends. Normally I don't have a problem with waiting cause we're in a big group and we always have a lot to talk about but this was a little bit too much. It was one of those:


Hey, it's a lil long but maybe it'll be here soon. .. to

Typically I'll notice a small language barrier but the lady who im assuming is the owner was fluent in English and constantly came back to fulfill any requests we had, and as a picky pho eater I had a loooot of requests. She kept us entertained with some well timed jokes and made sure we always had our beverages full. 

The orders we got as a group were an oxtail pho, a pho tai, a combination pho, pork chops with rice, and an order of egg rolls. 

The serving sizes of the bowls are on a much larger scale than usual. You can safely downgrade one level from the listed bowl size and receive what you're probably used to. ie) their medium is really like a large, and their small is like a medium, and their large...is like a pho challenge at most restaurants.

The first thing I generally notice when eating pho is the broth, and their broth is for sure on point. The noodles they used are the fat noodles, different texture but pretty typical. The pho tai was nothing to rave about but again the broth is what makes the bowl. 

The oxtail pho, I had a small taste of and wow it makes sense that this is what they're known for. Meat was clearly cooked in the broth correctly as the meat just slid off the bone with a single touch and melted in my mouth with a blast of flavor. Will most definitely be ordering this pho next time. 

The other dish that was quite delicious was their pork chop and rice dish. Pork was cooked to a nice tender texture and had tons of flavor. 

All in all this place is 5 stars due to their excellent service and the great few dishes i mentioned above, especially their oxtail pho!

We found this restaurant from a billboard that claimed it had once been featured on the Food Network. If that's true, it must have been a long time ago...if you don't want to read all this, save yourself some time and don't even bother with this place.

The restaurant was in total disarray. It looked like they were prepping for a yard sale and there was heaping amounts of random stuff taking up 90% of the dining space. 

There were printed signs all over the dining space that were incredibly rude and racist. These signs were clearly made in frustration over patrons not pushing in their chairs, complaining about the price of the food, or not tipping. One sign, right by my head, specifically called out the ""homies"" who would rather spend their money on strippers to make their ""little homies"" happy (I can't make this up...). Just from the signs alone, how is this place in business?

The owner was our server and her attitude was absolutely abhorrent. She was incredibly racist and justified her racism because she is Vietnamese and we're white. Her and her racist attitude assumed we didn't know how to eat spring rolls or ph properly. She actually touched our spring rolls, without asking, to show us how to eat them (needless to say, I didn't eat that one). Then she wanted to take my bowl of ph and show me how to properly put it together and eat it. The fact that I have frequented SEVERAL Vietnamese restaurants and consider ph to be one of my all time favorite meals is not the point--she didn't know that about me, but the point still stands is that she could have ASKED me if I knew how to eat spring rolls or ph rather than assume I didn't know anything about the food I ordered. I stopped her from touching my bowl after she sat it down in front of me; she was clearly annoyed but shrugged, claiming I'm not going to enjoy it as much unless I put it together correctly.

We couldn't enjoy our meal in peace. Instead, she sat down nearby and offered her commentary on everything we said. I made the mistake of talking to my friend about the Vietnamese restaurant back home, and she immediately jumped in and told me that their ph is not as good as theirs because they don't cook it properly. I then asked her when she had been to that restaurant and she said she hadn't (obviously), but she knew it wasn't good because hers is the best.

The food here was good, and I would love to talk more about how good the food was here, but the atmosphere and staff of this restaurant totally ruined my experience.

    My wife ordered #24 and I ordered the oxtail soup. They were about average in taste but not worth the $11 and $14 price tags. And for that much I expected a bigger serving. Compared to the closer Pho places, Pho 87 really fell short. 
    Um yeah I lowered my expectations and shook my head at the same time. When were they on the food network?  Did they raise their prices after their appearance?

My 10 year old son loves this place and can finish a regular Pho by himself. The lady/owner knows us by now every time we drop by. It wasn't like that in the beginning and we got the soup Nazi treatment like the Seinfeld episodes. They serve the Pho pip in hot with the thick noodles. Below is what you can expect.

Pros:
* Pip in hot broth.
* Very tasty and seasoned well.
* Thick noodles.
* You can order regular, large or baby bowl if you got kids.

Cons:
* Place is a hole in wall, aesthetically, your eyes will not be pleased with the place.
* No sharing is allowed. Be forewarned, we learned this the hard way in the beginning. You can ask to get a baby bowl and regular or larger bowl. This will bypass the no sharing policy.
* Ask for water only if you intend on drinking. Usually I am good with drinking the broth.
* If you don't like thick noodles, then this place is not for you. I love the thick noodles.
* If you get on the owners bad side, get ready for an entertaining soup Nazi treatment. You will know when this happens when everything you ask is a no. Been there, done that. But I like the lady and we overcame the initial soup Nazi tango.
* Did I mention this is a hole in the wall? So don't expect a Michelin star restaurant here folks. If you've been to Asia and ate in hole in the wall places, well this is what you are going to get.

In summary, this is best Pho in Vegas. I have tried other Pho's around the Vegas area, but I end up coming back to this place. I have been to many pretentious French and Italian cuisine, steak houses and expensive buffet (Caesar, Wynn, Bellagio, Wicked Spoon etc.). I always make sure I drop by here when I am in Vegas. The Pho might be a few dollars more, but you are in Vegas and everything is more. Compared to the expensive restaurants around Vegas, the Pho here is a bargain. If you can't afford to pay a few bucks more for the Pho here, what the heck are you doing in Vegas? The lady is entertaining when she does the soup Nazi No routines and customers are flabbergasted when they can't share... haha! Chill out and order the baby bowl folks. If you can drop a few hundred bucks on slots, black jack poker etc., what's a few extra bucks for Pho! Nuff said!",UKQZcc4FizqjDgiJWENiCg,4,3,5,rHQ_L7yUpNS66V2hwTXfaQ

Decided to leave before we ordered and the lady took a cheap shot of saying, ""food too expensive?""  Stated that we just didn't want to dine in a business that supported Trump and she wanted to argue with us.  Funny thing, first thing I notice on the menu was ""White Boy Pho"", and thought it was pretty racist to have a dish named that.  I should have known something was wrong when the restaurant was empty.",i14mUWMtKH8kuCRgghrsIw,0,0,1,oiZI39CmwmLLjqOIyNQl0Q
5734987,2011-05-02,0,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,"I've been here twice. My friend first took me to this restaurant about 2 weeks ago and I got Pho Tai like usual. Pho So 1's pho tai's meat changed on me. Therefore, I was pleased to know that the meat tasted like how I like it here. I never drink the soup so I've nothing to say about that. They are proud of their broth though. Next time, I'll drink some of it. I get full easily so after eating all the noodles + the meat, I don't want to touch the broth.

The second time that I went, I took a party of 12 with me (after watching Fast Five). The owner's wife is really cool. She'll tease you and stuff, but she's pretty chill.  Feel free to joke around with her and all that. It's a very personal and informal experience, I guess you could say. It's unique, I suppose. Some owners don't even interact with you. She also recommended us #12 with the brisket and I actually really liked it. Think I'll be changing my future orders to #12 instead of #11. ^^v

We stayed past their closing time (10pm) but didn't get kicked out. A few of my friends were very acquainted with her. As long as Pho 87 is open, I will be going there for my pho now. At least I know the service will be better than the other ones that I've been to.

Also, their sizes come in S, M, and L. The prices are good. They also have the pho challenge and the Food Network also came recently. TRY IT OUT IF YOU HAVEN'T!",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,3,2,4,q6QbVaSFiQJZ863zm7dF8g

5801755,2014-12-23,0,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of their prices. It costs about $11-15 for a small bowl where just across the street or all along spring mountain you can find the same size for about $7-8. Wanted to see what all the hype was about and I do have to say that the food was good. So if you don't care to pay double then try it out.,qNf9mbGECHVN15ecyNLokA,0,0,4,apE775AdZiHR4QAxRu97BQ

My family and I use to come here years back. I stopped coming after I orders a rice plate and I got really sick from it.  Couple years later (which is now), I wanted to take my boyfriend because he's been wanting to try this place. We walk in the restaurant and the lady just tells us to come over to her. Doesn't say hi or welcome. All she said was ""Come here!"" We sat down and I look at the menu. First of all, they don't have a lot of selection. Secondly, they are very pricey. Regardless of how ""good"" their soup is. I don't remember them being THAT pricey. It was $21 for a medium bowl!The lady was very rude and rushing us. My boyfriend asked a few questions and she just answered it carelessly. 

We then decided to leave because of the bad vibe. We told the lady we'll try it out some other time. She snatches the menus away and says ""Well, come back when you have money and eat our good food!"" Then, as we walked out, she then turned to the only people there and said ""Can you believe that these customers walked out because of our price"". I think that's very unprofessional. 

So, this review doesn't even deserve a star. No customer service at all. All you get is a lady that has some bad attitude. There are other pho places that will treat you better and they're still good. I think this place just blew their heads a little bigger just because they were ""featured in the food network"". And, I've actually seen that episode and they had 5 minutes of fame, which is nothing. I wouldn't want anyone to get treated the way we got treated. Never coming here and I will tell people not to come here.",kF_Wl3sAEo-mTQ9Z5zohLw,12,2,1,JJi7RAHziKerDOc8MfbbuA

After seeing this place on the food network I was really excited to try it out but to my dissapointment it was nothing like it was on the show. The broth was just ok and not much noodles in my soup. On top of that this place is filthy. Dust and junk everywhere. In the back corner next to the restrooms it looks like an episode of hoarders. When I checked out I was trying to be nice and said lunch was good, but all I got back Is ""We know that why we here for 30 years""  To be honest if it wasn't for the food network I don't think they would not have lasted that long. I do not recommend this place to others.",HoC-eVZIqT_2ituhtCKKSQ,2,1,1,x1VaNWLM1xAl2tDTNZzgzQ
5918680,2010-09-22,1,m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng,"Pho 87 is just okay for me.  Ate here before after reading Nelson Q's review, but still thought their pho is just okay.  Came back again for the Pho 87 big ass bowl of pho in 87 minutes challenge UYE for moral support, and eventually tried their Chicken Pho which I thought was good.  The dessert menu is basically just the boba tea menu with a good selection of flavors to select from. I tried the Almond Smoothie with Boba, and I think that it would be better as just a regular Almond Boba Tea since the ice ws not blended fine enough.  Could it be that they are not using a Vita-Mix for the job?

Other items I have tried here: Pork and Shrimp Spring Rolls.  It was decent, but you don't get much in terms of the featured protein.

Someone else ordered a rice entree for $7, and it is enough to fill you up, but again lacking in the proteins department.Personally I prefer restaurant that serves a plate of food they way they would like to see it if they were doing the ordering, and price it accordingly instead of cutting back on the portions.

The waitress is funny with her comments, which can be considered rude, but she did say that she is the Pho Nazi.  And since I took so long to decide what to order, she promptly skipped me and said ""No pho for you"".  :p

Their Pho 87 challenge is formidable.  The bowl is really big!  Supposedly 2.5x their regular large size pho and costs $30 to order. However if you finish it in the allotted 87 minutes with no outside help, the pho is free plus you keep the bowl, $87 prize and fame, bragging rights, billboard coverage and VIP treatment to the hottest Vegas night club scenes.  I saw 4 people attempt this challenge, but the noodles was just too much.

What else?  The restaurant is decorated pretty nicely.  I think it was the decoration from a previous Asian or Japanese buffet restaurant, but it is part of the decor of Pho 87 now.  And diners, please refrain from you or your kids playing with the restaurants lime green chopsticks, it is for eating and not as a drumstick.  If you break it, they may not charge for it, but they are definitely thinking about it.

Pho 87 is not the best and not the worst pho experience I have had here in Las Vegas. Price is on the high side for the portion you get relative to other local pho restaurants, but they claim to make everything fresh from quality ingredients.

Overall - 3 stars.

P.S. Their herbs and lime wedges are very fresh!",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,4,3,6CLVjgnidsGLIipIkBY6zQ

The service was awful - I stood at the door and was completely ignored. When I finally stormed over to the server who was watching tv, I got a water that tasted like it had been scooped out of the toliet. I got a small bowl of pho with brisket. It came out very fast but the meat tasted....odd, the noodles weren't cooked through and the broth was mediocre. Go to Pho Kim Long II - it's cheaper and way better.",8sainCVmwefyH_rbxBXP2w,1,0,2,gdqZgYAeg30VUTwrj5f3cg
