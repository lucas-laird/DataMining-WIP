I walked in and ordered my food at the counter. (I got a Ruben with their house-made chips) The cashier told me I could take a seat wherever and that my food would be out soon. After around 5-7 minutes they brought out my sandwich. 

The sandwich wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowing either. Honestly, I just felt like a regular sandwich, which is fine in my book. Their homemade chips are pretty decent too. 

All in all, the restaurant really isn't bad, but it's nothing to write home about either. If you're out and just want a quick bite to eat that's close by, this place is a viable option.",SxCe6smCv_rnyTWRpXZApA,0,0,3,ev6Nw1-VvT6lEgI1zPdGpA

64179,2015-03-02,5,Dnn7JsdmvJ0_spWu9wo2kg,"Ok so I decided to give this new spot a try on a rainy Sunday afternoon due to the great yelp reviews. I ordered the steak sandwich with fries and the cubano with homemade chips, to go. Took about 10 mins to get the order but that was ok since I knew everything would be fresh. Was excited to eat but when I got home the cubano had NO CHIPS! C'mon man the place was pretty empty. There was one lady there and two people came in after me. It's pretty bad if you can't remember to put the side order in the box when the place is slow. Did you not notice how lonely the sandwich was and how much extra space was in the box dude? Damn bruh get it together!

Ok now about the food. It was delicious!! The steak sandwich was really tasty, savory and had flavorful marinara sauce, piles of steak, grilled peppers, gooey melty cheese all stuffed in a nice chewy roll. The fries were still warm, crunchy and were seasoned very well. The cubano had that signature crunch and a nice portion of porky goodness! I just wish I could have tried those homemade chips! I'll have to give them another shot someday and hopefully the service will match the quality of the food. Overall great!",WptCfZ_h6pdnkBJx4ha8Aw,4,1,4,YsRYQmLVqPp7ARMlxgkKTA

507353,2015-03-25,0,Dnn7JsdmvJ0_spWu9wo2kg,"Excited to hear a sandwich place opened so close to my house! I have an unusual obsession with Goodwich, and was hoping this place would be similar. 

Stopped by for a late lunch over the weekend. Interior is a little awkward, huge kitchen area, small-ish dining area. No blinds so had to switch seats since the sun was in my eye. No music, and since there was only us plus 1 other table, I felt like I had to whisper...  otherwise everyone would hear what I was saying.  The guys working did their jobs, but not hospitable in any way. No hello or goodbye. No suggestions or explanations on the menu (I know it's pretty self explanatory, but you know... it was my first time and all, I wanted to know what this place is all about). I saw a couple big containers of chips, but they didn't look very fresh/appetizing. 

Since my 6th sense was nagging at me a little, we decided to split one sandwich to see if we'd be back or not. 
Reuben on rye with fries: 
Innards = pretty generic, not sure if they make ingredients in house or not, didn't taste like they do
Rye = same kind you can buy at grocery store
Fries = pretty darn good, crispy on outside, fluffy on inside, not too thick or thin, seasoned with S+P

I could've made this same sandwich at home, not sure if the other items would be different. On the upside, portions are pretty large and prices pretty reasonable. I guess this would be the perfect place to go if you didn't feel like making your own sandwich at home. 

Too bad, so sad, I'll have to continue my trek to Goodwich.",dcSLz5d9xiSFb8zsqn2zKQ,3,1,3,KJDwyNhLbyv_UV7vW0QKDw

Had a burger and a grilled cheese sandwich. Both of which were delicious.

It was on like a super crunch-crusty-soft bread with cheddar and gruyere cheese.

They have healthy and vegan options, but also don't shy away from gourmet spins on comfort food. I have reason to believe that the owner is a retired chef, as all the items on the menu seem to have a signature spin. They are always professionally dressed and I enjoy watching them prepare the food in a manner that you'd see in the kitchen of a reputable restaurant. 

One time I came in after I got off of work sometime during their last hour of operation. I ordered a burger, and they let me have as many toppings as I wanted at no charge.

My only problem is that they don't have fountain drinks, which would be cheaper than the pre-bottled stuff in their fridges. However, I ultimately think that works to their benefit, as it gives the patrons a different variety of options that sets them apart.

Service was friendly, got greeted by multiple employees in and out. Took maybe 20 minutes to prepare, which is great; I'd be more skeptical about walking into a low occ restaurant with food already prepared.

1. Turn on some music or a freaking tv. Way tooooo quiet.  Makes it very uncomfortable. 

2. They have sides but they are not listed ANYWHERE.  
3. Facebook, Twitter or instagram.... get some exposure fast.

4. Post your hours and website on your door.

5. More signage, banners, something more to attract drivers off of jones.

6. ENERGY ENERGY ENERGY.  THIS PLACE NEEDS ENERGY.

-food was amazing

Great selection of hot and cold options, with the option to add-on a side of fries, house-made chips, or coleslaw for just a buck! Good value, large portions for the low prices.

REUBEN: A surprise hit! Very tasty, thick bread, tasty Russian dressing and not too much slaw. A well-executed classic.
SAUSAGE & PEPPERS: Giant portion, a hoagie roll overflowing with peppers and onions, and two whole split sausages. Could not even come close to finishing this! I appreciated that it wasn't too saucy either, the bread didn't get soggy even when I had to take the other half to go.

Interior is clean but kind of plain. Location also has a drive-thru option. Service was quick but oddly quiet- no greeting when we entered, small talk when we ordered, or goodbye/thanks when e left and we were the only customers. Sandwiches were made fresh.

I love me some good rye bread and this one does not disappoint.  It is soft and yet firm enough that it stands up to the corned beef,  sauerkraut and cheese.  Perfectly grilled. Delicious!  Makes me almost feel like I'm in NYC. :)

When the man in charge, possibly he was an owner, finally went to take our order I let him know in a positive and friendly manner that this was our first time here & that we heard great things on Yelp so we decided to drive over and check it out.  His response was emotionless and you could tell he simply wanted us to place our order instead of engage in a friendly exchange.  He wasn't rude, just not really friendly.

2). I ordered a spicy chicken panini that had prosciutto because he said it was one of his top three sandwiches.  The prosciutto ended up being fatty, chewy and difficult to bite through without risking pulling all of it out of the sandwich in a single bite.

3). I don't like their way overpriced drink coolers with no other options like fountain drinks or refillable ice teas.  It's price gauging.

I can think of a dozen different places in town with superior sandwiches that would be a better use of one's time & money.

I think this 3-star review is the best I can give at this time.",XRhw3LhUvbDDaofXTVYrcA,5,1,3,x0yEEiIJxfdrcC1N6M3ijg

Think fast food: quick service, affordable prices, casual setting. The only difference is the food is high quality and full of fresh flavor.

I went in expecting to be adventurous, but I could tell by how clean and awesome the kitchen looked that this was a great place to have a gourmet style burger so that's what I got. It was priced surprisingly reasonable at $8.50, including premium toppings like crisp bacon and guacamole. I loved it!

My boyfriend had already been here and although he wasn't that impressed; he wanted to give them another try cuz he's big on sandwiches. 
Plus, I hadn't been here and he wanted me to sample the food. 

Came here one Wednesday around dinner time. I was pretty impressed with the space and lighting. Not hard to find at all.

Walked in. No music. No tv. No energy. Just noise of cooking. Mmmkay! Whatever. 

Decided to split the pastrami and roast beef. I was excited to try the pastrami as I'm really big on that sammie and I loooove sauerkraut. Roast beef just to try a cold sandwich -- the guy said the meat was going to be rare which I don't mind at all. 
Also got the side salad for a dollar!!!!!

Large selection of drinks. Like LARGE -- almost like a gas station lol -- but, I just got the largest bottle of water. 

Anyways, we get our food and first bite into the pastrami was pretty darn good. All the melted cheese and grilled bread with just the right about of sauce impressed me a lot. Reminded me of the pastrami sammie that The M Resort had at one of their cafes. 

I knew I wasn't going to finish both halves so, I figured on saving the warm pastrami for later. 

Went onto the roast beef and first thought(s) were, "" I could've made this myself."" The bread was bread. Tomato. Lettuce. Some mustard. And very rare roast beef. Absolutely nothing special :( and I paid $9 for it :(:( double sad face***

Salad was overly garlicy. Fresh garlic nonetheless but, SUPER SUPER SUPER garlicy dressing. It was difficult for me to finish my salad & I loooove salads. Especially salads with this kind of dressing. 

Overall experience was sad. Nothing unique or something I'd come back for.

3872828,2015-08-19,5,Dnn7JsdmvJ0_spWu9wo2kg,"A friend and I tried Great American Food for lunch today and it was A-OK.  There was only one other party of two in the small dining area during our visit today which may be due to the location of this restaurant. 

We were greeted immediately upon entering by the young gentleman who took our order at the counter.  He was very helpful with our menu questions.  We decided on a couple of sandwiches, grabbed a couple of beverages from the case, and passed on sides (which were an upcharge).  It was a little odd that they had an ice machine and cups/lids/straws, but no soda fountain or brewed iced tea, just overpriced (IMO) bottled beverages.

We took a seat and our sandwiches came out a few minutes later.  They were pretty large, so we definitely didn't miss having a side order.  We actually wound up taking half of our sandwiches to go.

I got the French Dip- $8.50, which was very good. The roll was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the beef was lean and seasoned nicely, and the au jus was flavorful without being salty.

My friend ordered the Steak Sandwich- $8.50, she said it was good, but that there was something sweet on the sandwich that threw the flavor profile off.  Not sure if it was the marinara sauce or if the peppers were sweet peppers.

When we were almost finished, an older gentlemen, who I assume was the proprietor, stopped by to make sure we were being taken care of, which was a nice touch.  If I am in the area during lunchtime, I would definitely stop in again to try the Cobb Salad and a few other sammies.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,8,5,3,7pqdymiGhsqYfGyp8oeLaQ

Next trip I got the baby kale salad which was delicious. The pistachios are a great addition. Their eggplant parm sandwich is also great- not too greasy or heavy with the breeding, and the marinara sauce is fresh and light.

This past trip I got the grilled cheese which is also amazing- comes with crispy bacon (which is perfectly crispy) and their homemade guac which is great. 

Their homemade chips are also a great choice. I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw, but they give so many options to accompany your sandwich (fries, salad, chips or coleslaw) I know to get one of the others.",7OJimEkNPTXgLAj5hKRMlQ,3,1,5,hVBIn6YZKpHF_i37J5u6Vg

4502383,2015-03-07,1,Dnn7JsdmvJ0_spWu9wo2kg,"Let's  get to the point of this review, Yelpers!
THE DELICOUS FOOD I ORDERED:
     I ordered the 1/2 pound burger here with a side of french fries. It was actually made quite simple: toasted ciabatta bread, medium well grilled beef patty. It had shredded ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, and grilled  onions with a sort of thousand island dressing. Pretty simple, right? However, you have a choice to add 2 additional things to your  burger. You can add guacamole, bacon, or pico de gallo. Let me mention that the guacamole does have pico de gallo in it for those who do not like that type of guacamole. 

     The burger was DELICIOUS. The beef was exquisitely tasty; it was really well cooked, and the cook added a well-balanced amount of spices. The thousand island dressing gave it a surprisingly tasty flavor. I do want to mention this,  I believe the key to a damn good burger is the quality of beef and the spices and Great American Food delivered. Each bite of the burger assured me a juicy, consistent taste.
     The french fries I ordered were battered into a delicious well-fried crisp. I do not know what type of batter it was but it was delicious lol. Dunk some fries in their delicious ranch and your mouth with be in shock of flavor.
THE AMBIENCE:
         The place is a bit small. When you come in, theres a large  refrigerator to your left, that contains the drinks. There are no fountain drinks but they do have canned sodas, water bottles, and Vitamin Water. Restrooms are to the right and in the center  are the tables that you dine on. I will mention that the tables are really small so a group  of four people eating at the same table might be tough unless you can Tetris your plates to fit everything lol.

    The staff was wonderful and courteous, repeated the order for us just in case we didn't miss anything.
One thing I'd like to mention is that the cook noticed i was out  of ranch and gave me another side. I thought that was pretty cool of him notice.

The cashier didn't offer to replace it with anything. So I just bought a sandwich for 10. Total waste of money. 

The sandwich was mediocre at best. My best friend thought the same about his. The best part of my sandwich was the pickles I asked for on the side. During our lunch we kept talking about all of the much better and more reasonable priced sandwich places in town. What a hit of a place. So disappointing. 

I wouldn't come back here nor would I recommend it.",NYqp6yjtWnwh_VDANzNU2w,3,0,2,mYZ-SKSRDQMaRq27MLJ0QA

I ordered the Super Turkey with the cranberry relish on the side.  First off, the sandwich is huge and not stingy on any ingredients.  The sandwich had more of a gourmet feel than just some run of the mill sandwich.  

Not really much to say.  Really great quality ingredients and lots of it!

I can't wait to go back and try some other things.",qmYullp32aXFUr8WMVFrOA,0,0,4,Zgivn8bLhmdQzwUsSxWKmw

4808695,2015-03-24,1,Dnn7JsdmvJ0_spWu9wo2kg,"My family owns a local business, so for us it's important to shop and eat local and keep the money circulating! 

I came here first by myself and ordered to go. I must say, it's very had to mess up a burger for me, but there's also very few places that can cook a burger like this! The bun is of good quality, as well as the meat, but the toppings are what really make this burger outstanding! The bacon is crispy, and the guacamole is a great alternative to getting just plain avocado! You get your choice of cheese, and it's only 1$ extra for fries, chips or coleslaw. Their fries are crispy and they even have what I think is homemade ranch to dip them in. Yum! 

I have since brought my parents back twice and they enjoyed their burgers as well. Although I have seen and saw others enjoy their other menu items, I'm stuck on this burger! 

The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean. I left off one star because I do feel they need some kind of music playing, it is a tad too quite in there for me.",KfcNzMdmeWN4G3WEi81hbA,3,0,4,HAHY8Mq4euWIvHciOeyMUQ

4970330,2015-02-13,4,Dnn7JsdmvJ0_spWu9wo2kg,"A Strange Mix of Good Food, Terrible Service and the Bizarre.

My wife, Kid and I walked into Great American Food at 11:15 on Friday.  We were the only ones in there at the time.  Four employees behind the counter.  Not one greeted us or said anything to us at all.  You would think with a new restaurant some one would say hi or offer to explain the menu or anything.  It's like we weren't there.  

We approached the counter to order.  I had the Pastrami, wife the grilled cheese,  kid the meatball.  After we ordered, we were told the sandwiches come with choice of chips, fries, slaw or salad....nice, but not explained anywhere on the menu.  Also, no kids menu anywhere to be found.  Not necessary but would have been nice.  We ordered two chips and one order of fries.

We also ordered three sodas.  Cans of soda are in the fridge against the north wall.  Cups for your soda are along the south wall and ice for said cups is against the east wall by the register.  Very strange layout.  

The food was prepared and we were called up to the counter.  We were never given a number but since we were the only ones in the restaurant, it was obvious the food was ours.  I don't know how the would let you know if it was busy.  Maybe they have a number or name system but didn't use it because they were slow.

All three sandwiches were great!  The bread was grilled and crunchy.  The meats and cheeses were warm and melty and everything was delicious.  The chips were ok but not bad but the fries were some of the best fries I've had.  Crunchy, piping hot and seasoned perfectly.

Here's the bizarre again.  You would think with 80% of the menu being sandwiches they would have a quality mustard and ketchup available.  Nope.  Little packets of the cheapest ketchup and cheapest yellow mustard were all they had.  So while the pastrami was amazing, it was heavily reduced by not having a nice Dijon or spicy mustard available, just little mustard packs.

One more Bizarre thing, they have an open sign in the window and it's plugged into the ceiling.  Instead if neatly taping or gluing the wire to the ceiling, its just a tangled mess hanging down from there.  It would take less then five minutes to get a ladder and make it look nice and clean like the rest of the restaurnat but like it is, it's very noticeable and distraction.

We finished and left.  One other person had come into order in the whole time we were there.  No one acknowledged us when we entered and no one acknowledged us when we left.  

PROS - Great Sandwiches, Great Fries

CONS - Bizarre customer service, bizarre wires hanging from the ceiling and the cheapest condiments for what would otherwise be a very nice lunch.

2 stars for the food alone.",fIM5z8nnpLWWBdGPQ4FNfA,14,1,2,PAuSgL91pk9WoJcxPe-e3w

I had the Cuban Sandwich and while I would not describe it as 'Great American Food', it was awesome!  The mustard ailoli was delicious.  The bread was well seasoned and crunchy. It piled high with meat, swiss cheese and pickles.  Classic!
