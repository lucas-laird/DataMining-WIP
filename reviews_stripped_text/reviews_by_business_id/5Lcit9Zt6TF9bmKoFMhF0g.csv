They got their food before us, the place is dirty. We waited at our table for over 10 minutes before ever being acknowledged (I'm pretty sure it would have been longer if we didn't go up to the cashier trying to order), the table we had to run and claim ourselves. The yelp location of the place is completely wrong so a couple of u turns had to happen. Waited forever for the food after waiting a lifetime to even put our order in. While waiting watching more people who arrived after us get their food.  The food is not worth going through all the crap.

Right off the plane (red eye flight), grougy, tired, and hungry, we had to kill time before picked up Aunty and Uncle and check into our hotel.  So we bought our buns from Diamond and waited till this place opened at 10am.  

So we had the following:

Stewed Beef Soup Noodle - The beef noodle hit the spot!  Wow!  The taste is just so warm and satisfing.  The noodles are cooked just right - a little chewy and not over done.  Soup has flavor like I remember from Taiwan.  Also, has a little sour cabbage for  some BANG!

Beef Wrap - Almost like Peking Duck, but wrapped in a tortilla and uses beef instead.  It has the tortilla wrap, hoi sin sauce, egg, thin slices of beef, green onions, and chinese parsley.  We ordered this on the recommendations of yelpers.  Thought it was not bad, but nothing special.

Spicy Shrimp Won Tons - This was ok.  Imagine the shrimp won tons you get in won ton mein. Take out the noodles and the broth.  Put it on a bed of vegtables (bak choy) with oyster sauce and chilli sauce.  That's basically it.  Since I make won tons at home, this dish didn't raise my eyebrows.

Later in the trip, we came here again Aunty and Uncle.  We had to share our latest find, since last time in Vegas I took them to eat Taiwanese food, I failed.  If I failed this time, I would have to treat Uncle to our next trip to Vegas.  This time we ordered the following:

Stewed Beef Soup Noodle - A little spicier than last time, but since I can handle spicy, it was still really good!

Beef Wrap - Aunty and Uncle liked our leftovers when we picked them up after the first day, so we ordered it again.

Steamed Dumplings with Nappa Cabbage - I love dumplings!  Really good size, filling is really good!  Texture is not mushy, so yummy!  Put their homemade chilli sauce on the table, and tastes even better!

Steamed Shrimp Dumplings - I love more dumplings!  Inside has shrimp and chives, and other things that make it tase delicous!  Cooked to perfection.  Did I say I love dumplings?

So how did I do with Aunty and Uncle?  Let's say, that Uncle should pay for my trip back to Vegas!  Too bad I didn't make that bet with him!  I think they'll be back!",4oyoX5GrkeQolfCMsJ7Osg,0,0,4,0ETtj86h4O1E7xiEWiiBuw

I was not happy with the service.  We were waiting to have our order taken but the waiter sat another party that had just walked in and he returned to take their order before us.

first time was pretty okay, it's something that i would come back for if i dont know what to eat around vegas area. 

second time, the beef noodle was very bad, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the most delicious. I give it a 4. 

the soup base was way too spicy, and noodle was very mushy. 

I kindly told the store owner/ server that last time i came, the noodle didn't taste like this and was wondering what happened, I was just expecting a simple sorry, and we will make it better, or something like i can try to make it taste better right now. but no, he was like OH you came in at a very busy time, and we remake the soup and it's SUPPOSED TO TASTE A LITTLE DIFFERENT! 

i swear the soup was too spicy for sake. i didn't even eat 1/5 of it. and Ima big time eat and I LOVE beef stew noodle, and it was that bad that I couldnt eat it. 

the rest of the food were okay, but just the beef noodle was gross.

I'd like to just inform people that don't go in if they look busy, because the soup will just be too spicy, and it's supposed to be like that! 

service was okay, a little slow during busy hours, but they're pretty nice, except for the part when they tried to make excuses for that noodle.",xYt2RGRhx3jKuwre7Ymsyw,0,0,3,WOzlyltyIkVgFJY_Vxob1Q

I ordered the #2 with beef and tendon.  The broth is ultra savory and flavorful, and the quantity of meat is very generous.  There's just the right amount of spiciness too.  The beef is super tendor and absorbs all the flavor of the broth, and the tendon is soft and tasty as well.  There's also plenty of bits of vegetables that lend just a bit of texture and crunch to the overall dish.  This is about as good as any beef noodle soup can be.

The beef roll is just okay.  It's got an egg wrap and cucumber inside which is a bit different, but overall it's fine, just not really great or anything.

Spicy wonton: 4 stars- chili sauce wonton with pork inside. Very good dish and not too spicy. Great flavors.

Minced pork noodle soup: 2 stars- let me explain the 2 stars. I was set on eating this dish which had tasty soup broth from the minced meat but for me it's all about the noodles. I had been to the other location in Henderson and the thick wide cut chewy noodles is what made the dish. Unfortunately they didn't have the wide chewy noodles so the dish was just not the same.

Also, there were only two waitresses taking orders, serving food, and working the register... That was clearly not enough. I had to wait 5 minutes for a take out box!

1404187,2014-01-07,19,5Lcit9Zt6TF9bmKoFMhF0g,"Many Las Vegans have declared that pursuing authentic Taiwanese food in this town is like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. My ever-growing curiosity in this uniquely ethnic cuisine, as well as guidance from people who are knowledgeable about this food has led me to Noodle Pot. I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that this establishment has superseded  my expectations!

Following a brief stop at the Shavery, I ran into Will (a.k.a. the artist formerly known as SnowFlake), along with a couple of Yelper's, and we decided to go to Noodle Pot. I have driven past this joint many times without thinking twice to stop in. It was a startling revelation to learn that, according to Will, Noodle Pot has some truly legitimate  Taiwanese grub in Vegas. Most notably, I wanted to try the national dish of Taiwan, spicy beef noodle soup.

I admire extraordinary mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall resto's, and Noodle Pot fits the bill to a tee. The comfortable yet lively vibe keeps the interaction going. After the server sat us down, we ordered some appetizers along with the spicy beef noodle soup.

Cold Vegetable Appetizer Plate - The first time I ordered this it came with pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, and wheat gluten. The cucumbers were marvelous, with the correct amount of saltiness to harmonize with the sweetness used in the sauce. The wheat gluten was another smash hit. It tasted incredibly akin to a concoction of beef and chicken. 

(Note: Coming here on a separate visit, and ordering this dish again, they had replaced the wheat gluten with soy sauce hard-boiled eggs. I notably did not enjoy them, and I was not too confident to which tree the egg grows on, but that's just me ((hehe)).

Pork and Chive Dumplings - Another sublime feature! The dumpling wrappers tasted hand made, and the filling inside was outstanding with perfectly tender pork matching the bright flavor of the chives. The vinegary soy sauce dip was the icing on the cake.

Beef Roll - My least favorite item, but pretty splendid nonetheless. Slices of beef and cilantro wrapped around a thin crepe. I actually prefer other Chinese versions that use a thicker, flakier scallion pancake in which the inside is coated with hoisin sauce. But, it was delish.

Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - the ""Pièce de résistance"" to our meal. We opted for the wide noodles instead of the regular noodles (think of it as thicker version of pappardelle). The noodles were perceived as if they were hand made and hand pulled, even though they probably came from a special noodle factory. The broth was nuts! It was packed with beef flavor, but exceptionally delicate. Hints of tomato added depth. Large portions of tender beef dotted the soup. Also, if the server has not brought out the chopped pickled cilantro, ask for it. That combined with the baby bok choy in the soup will give the dish a marvelous variation!

Many have mentioned this before, but I will proclaim it again. CASH ONLY!!! Save the plastic for the surgeon's table! :D

(Another side note: I took my brother here when he visited and at the time they had run out of beef so we opted for the Spicy Beef Tendon Soup. Even though I was fine, my brother returned home and had the hershey squirts for the next few days. The soup comes with a tremendous amount of tendons, so if you are not used to eating lots of offal or weird animal bits, I would be cautious when ordering this version).",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,29,22,5,vHlUdoOO3ccVDoA7Qhfc_g

But before I rate and compare their foods to other similar restaurants, I like to point out one thing that is VERY UNPLEASANT. IF YOU ARE NOT A MANDARIN SPEAKING CHINESE, YOU ARE GOING TO GET SECOND RATE SERVICE. AND, THE SERVICE OVERALL IS BELOW AVERAGE FOR RESTAURANTS LIKE THIS TO START WITH. Sad to see this. We spoke English to the waitress and was seated. At least 4 groups came in after us. They ALL spoke Mandarin and were handed manus and served tea quickly. We waited and waved at the waitress to get attention. She brought us the menu and then the tea. The waitress then proceeded to take orders and served the foods to the 4 groups came in after us. Again, I waved for the waitress and she came and took my orders. CAME IN FIRST AND SERVED 5TH, NOT RIGHT !

The foods are pretty standard Taiwanese food and can be compared to other similar restaurants easily, like China Mama, Taiwan Deli, or the now closed Taiwan Kitchen, just to name a few.

I've only been here once while I was on my way to a performance, and I was a little skeptical.  The restaurants in Chinatown aren't the best, and there have been about three restaurants before this one in the same location.  But, Noodle Pot proved me wrong.

I only tried their beef noodle soup since it was recommended to me; it's a decent bowl of soup.  The portion is large for a really cheap price.  The beef is super tender.  They pretty much fall apart when you bite into it.  Also, the noodles are hand made.  Hand made noodles in Vegas?  I've never had hand made noodles, so I don't know what the standard is, but these noodles are wide and flat.  The edges are sort of splayed, so it looks like it was just pulled or something like that.  The edges are soft and when you bite, the experience is like eating al dente pasta.  It's a little crunchy in the middle.  

The soup is standard beef noodle soup.  I like Champion's more because the base has a little more taste (salt) but the hand made noodles is probably the thing that's going to bring me back.

Make sure when you come here that you speak Mandarin/Taiwanese.  The place is owned by a couple that doesn't understand English, and the waitresses (who are their daughters, I think) speak a sort of broken English.  I definitely think it would've been easier for me to order if I spoke Mandarin, but the whole finger pointing works too.",w2glC5U-MFr3Uk90lRbGIw,0,0,4,Xr7dctaO6AOi9WvyAPbNXg

My friend Christi and I came in for a catchup sesh and immediately placed our orders for lunch - she had the Beef & Tendon Noodle Soup while I opted for the Zha Jiang Mien (dry noodles with sliced cucumbers, bean sprouts, and spicy pork that you mix together). They offered hot tea, which is nice for a fast food place (I always thought hot tea was mandatory at Chinese places, but I've discovered more and more places are trying to get away with charging for it..pfft). We also ordered the chive dumplings.

Food came out quickly, and it was flavorful, tasty, and not overdone with salt. 

Only reason why I'm knocking off a star is the service. It seemed rather mixed - there was an older lady who was brusque while a younger server's kindness offset that attitude.

Remembering that the chicken rice dishes here are trash I went with a beef tendon noodle soup, Mike went with beef noodle soup, and we shared an order of wontons in chili oil. Judging by the items ordered, I can say that this place is authentic, as their noodle soups are served simiarly to what you would find in Taiwan.

The beef tendon noodle soup ($8.99) was tasty, with a generous amount of tendon which is the best part! The broth itself was flavorful even though I asked them to make it less spicy for me. They have a spicy and non-spicy version of this dish by the way, so you can also get it mild. The noodles and tendon were soft, very tender and perfectly cooked. I would come back just for this soup alone.

The wontons in chili oil ($6.50) was also an impressive dish, and it too was served the traditional way. The chili oil gave the wontons a nice oily flavor but wasn't too overpowering or spicy by any means. The wontons were thin with a decent amount of pork wrapped inside.

The service here was a lot better than the last time around and our order was correct with no issues whatsoever. It was interesting that we were the only ones here at noon and then all of a sudden the place exploded and a huge rush of several different parties came in at the same time. This place is pretty solid for their authentic noodle soups, but that's all I would recommend here as an entree.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,3,1,4,0EYeen4R3a68IRyRJWn-qg

I was NOT at all disappointed. I did get the spicy beef and tendon noodle soup. I enjoy spicy food! I know we all have our own levels of heat but felt spicy was just right not over the top but still feel the kick. The amount of beef and tendon took me surprise with generous portions. I am fan of Pho. I get tendon in my Pho never get enough one piece or two if lucky. Here at Noodle Pot get bang for your buck. The broth was so heavenly no need add nothing else plus had small bok choy pieces in too. The noodles was great! I thinking be more like Pho much thicker noodle close too udon but thiner. I felt made the soup even more hearty with the bigger noodles. Yummy. I also ordered beef roll just cause first trip wanted try as much as I can. Another great dish on the menu. It heavy for starter just so you know. It something that never had before maybe because of the whole restaurant style. It looks more like crepe roll up with thinly sliced of tongue (I think) and lot of other good stuff lot of herbs/greens. You get two nice big rolls pre order. I would take beef roll over any spring roll. 

The service say can be hit or miss depending on busy. I happen too during the lunch rush so kind of happy found spot. They only have one server/cashier and she does everything. Although too be honest the cook brought out my noodle soup since it was busy. It came too getting the bill if busy best bet just go right up too the cashier. If had anything pick at was since busy waited long time for bill. Two other tables that they just went right up too pay since taking little bit. Overall service was still very good. 

The restaurant is pretty small so timing is everything. I do believe they do take out orders. Parking more then ample being located in Chinatown. If fan of noodles Noodle Pot is some place that need too check out. I know will be back. =))",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,5,3,4,QnvFDs18F6lmI1LZR0e9og

The restaurant is family owned so it is small but they have enough space to sit comfortably. They only have one size and it is large enough to feed two semi hungry people and fulfilling for one starving person. The max we waited for our food to come after we ordered was about 10-15 minutes so it is pretty fast.

Always a good sign when I walk into a Chinese restaurant and they assume I'm a native speaker right off the bat so I'm happy to play the role of the fobby young immigrant looking for an oasis of good eats in the desert reminding him of the motherland (or mother island, depending on your politics).  

My two times here I've gotten the spicy beef noodle soup and the pork feet noodle soup, both leaving me satisfied with warm soup belly and no residual sense of being parched from excessive MSG/salt.    The noodles offered come in two varieties: thin (nice Q-Q quality with an udon like consistency) and the thick hand-cut variety that are like nice al-dente dumpling strips).  The broth for the beef noodle soup has good balance in spice from the star anise/peppercorns with a lingering sweet finish and the beef is braised fork-tender (chopstick tender?) with plenty of marbled fatty goodness and accompanying tendon pieces that have been cooked down to the perfect chewy consistency.  If you're feeling a bit more adventurous and need to save a few extra bucks, the pork feet noodle soup is a bargain considering it is 2 dollars cheaper than the beef noodle soup and is loaded with large cartilaginous hunks of the soup's namesake that are braised so that everything falls off the bones with minimal effort.  The broth has a nice mild sweetness and the accompanying bok choy provides a nice contrast in crunch/color.  Probably not the best soup to order if you're on a date or if an attractive customer is sitting in front of you since this is one of those dishes you just need to go to town gnawing away and discarding the small bones aside every few bites, so just be comfortable in your own world of pork-liciousness.

Ahhh the beef noodle stew is exquisite. The amount of spices and herbs they use make this extremely tasty. Get the spicy variety as you will not regret it. Huge, bold flavor packed into one bowl, if you are craving beef noodle stew this is the place to go.

Staff was exceptionally nice both times I ate here, but also keep in mind that Taiwan-style (and other Asian countries) is to let them know when you need something, not for them to come check on you. 

Get the beef noodle soup with half tendon and half meat, just a little bit spicy. (I think it's #2.) Done well and finished with bok choy, cilantro, and a small bit of pickled vegetable. Only ""problem"" is that noodles come out exactly cooked and thereby end up slightly overdone by the time you reach the bottom of your bowl, but not sure how that's avoidable.

The meat of the duck soup composed of the neck bone of the duck, and I couldn't enjoy eating it because I constantly had to spit them out and on top of that it was more bone/cartridge than meat. 

  But thats not my biggest concern is that those small neck bone pieces if not careful are a shocking hazard. I ignorantly shared half of the soup with my elderly mother and by some act of God none of those small neck bones feel into the soup when she was slurping it down. She could of shocked. To give you an image of how small and thick they were imagine it half the size of a small pebble stone. Or a piece of rice crispy cereal.

Basically it's good home cooking that won't break the bank -   Dumplings, soup dumplings, noodle soups, cold dishes, etc. 

I'll warn u - if you have an MSG intolerance then stay away.  But MSG and cheap Chinese food are like peas and carrots.  Live a little wrong and get multiple refills of H20.

The dumplings were very good - not dry on the inside and had a nice moistness.  The soup dumpling aren't like China Mama or the ""Xiao Long Bao"" as you all know.  It's basically 8 big dumplings in a bowl of soup which definitely had the most MSG kick to it. 

Last, the service was great.  We were asked how our food was multiple times.

Though the tiny obscure sign helps disguise the restaurant quite well hehe. Look for the small ""Noodle Pot"" oval next to a looming sign in Chinese. 

This restaurant tastes like...home. I always thought my mother didn't cook any specialty dishes (sorry for hating in the past, mom) but now I realize that everything she made for us was traditional Taiwanese style dishes! Which is exactly what this restaurant sells. You MUST go with the spicy beef noodle soup! The soup is hearty and rich in beef flavor. It is also heavier on the tomato side which some beef noodle soup enthusiasts might not be accustomed to, though it's exactly how my grandma makes it. The noodles they use are perfectly chewy, slightly wavy and neither too thin or thick and the beef chunks are tender and savory. It comes with plenty of baby bok choy and pickled mustard and cilantro. 

For the side dishes I would recommend anything marinated! The cucumbers are garlicky, crunchy and refreshing while the cabbage is deliciously sour and spicy. My mouth is starting to water right now. Another must order is the beef wrap which is a thin green onion egg pancake wrapped around marinated beef slices, cilantro, and what seems like oyster sauce.  BUT THAT'S NOT ALL! You definitely need to order the chili oil wontons too. And all their dumplings are made in house. And finally the green bean (sweet mung bean, not the string variety) drink to top it all off!

Then, we found out you could order more portions of noodles to put into your bowl for just $1 more. So good and so filling! My sister and I ate three portions and nearly had to be rolled out of the place. What a steal.

No doubt, he was spot on. I was a little bit skeptical at first, seeing that their mascot is some weird-looking pig, who is standing on his hind legs and holding a chicken drumstick in his hand. WEIRD. I giggled incessantly, but still decided to give it a chance.

Man, when the flavor of the soup broth hits you... Wow. It looks watery, but as soon as you sip a little bit (yes, just a teeny-tiny bit, because the soup is served the same temperature as the surface of the sun), it ""whams"" you in the mouth with a meaty punch. 

I usually get the beef stew soup, but the man always gets either Beef and Tendon, or just the Tendon. I have been about four or five times now, and the consistency is always the same. Lots of tendon/beef, lots of flavor.

I, on the other hand, was intrigued with the big freezer that located inside the dining area, packed with frozen meat and trays of handmade wontons.

-Beef and Tendon Noodle Soup:  We asked for extra bowls so we can share this.  This is a huge bowl of spicy flavorful broth with super tender chunks of beef and tendons.  There were also baby bok choy and pickled veggie in this bowl of goodness.  

-Beef roll: tender slices of beef, egg and tons and tons of cilantro, with hoisin sauce, rolled up with a mu shu like wrapper.  There were two rolls, sliced in three sections, that came in an order.

It's the best I've ever had, though I am no ""expert"" on authentic taste. However, my friends who are much more in tune with the traditional flavor say that it is *very* good. This is primarily the dish I stick with, as it is their primary specialty, I believe.

Their beef, as compared to most places I've had in California, is tender, quality meat. A&J, a semi-chain, has these comparatively cheap pieces of beef with fat layered into it. I know which I prefer. The soup is very good, as are the noodles, and at 8 dollars a dish, you really can't go wrong as the meal is also very filling.

I've also enjoyed the beef rolls here - essentially sliced beef with some hoisin style sauce and a lot of cilantro-type herbs and egg wrapped into a thin pancake. They're really tasty as well.

Additionally, I do find that the owners and workers here are better than most hole-in-the-wall Taiwanese restaurants. Sometimes I could simply not stand the way I was treated at places like A&J.

Shame on this restaurant.

As a Chinese customer myself, I was recommended by my friends to dine here. 

That was a year ago. Things did not turn out pleasant. Let's say they do not take any credit cards or debit cards. It was OK, I promised my bud,it was my treat.I paid in cash. The total check was $35.  I left $45 on the tray ,which was 2 x 20 and. 1 x 5. (Leave her a $10 tip)

That shameless waitress took the tray,and she came back ,claiming that by saying that asuzing me only left 1 x 20 and 1 x 5 on the tray. 

So instead of I tip her 10 bucks,I was short of her 10 dollars from the total check. I know how much money that I left on the tray(I am a BANK OF AMERICA CASH REWARDS CREDIT CARD FAN and I only carried $45 in total in my wallet on that day), she was rude and mistaken by mixing my money with other tables' change. I was even going to call 911 on the spot bcz she even refused to check her camera footage which there's a camera above the cashier register. 

 That night was the last night my dear bud in Vegas,thanks to that low intelligence waitress, he did not leave Vegas with a pleasant experience. He could testify me that I paid in full and left a generous tip in cash that night.

What really caught my eye was the fact they have shaved ice, Taiwanese-style. The selection of additions is limited. They have all the usuals though: grass jelly, lemon jelly, red bean, green bean, taro, boba, pineapple, peach, and two or three others. Of course they have simple syrup and sweetened condensed milk. They advertise a special ""black sugar"" shaved ice, but that was not available both times I was there. There is only one size of shaved ice available and the price was under $6 for a large serving.

The other menu item that caught my eye was the beef noodle soup! You can get it with thin or wide noodles. On their menu, the option for ""hand-pulled"" noodles is listed, but after asking, the chef that does that was not there that day. Unfortunately, the dish itself was only average. The soup was not too salty, had good beef and star anise flavor, but it was also very, very oily. We ordered half meat, half tendon, it came to us more like quarter beef and three-quarter tendon. The meat was not braised long enough and was still a little tough. As for the tendon, they only had thinly sliced tendon, no big chunks, so it was very tender. 

I also ordered their plum drink. It was not the style I liked, it was not brewed. Instead, they took the dried, salted plums and threw it into a pot of hot water along with some sugar, there were no other herbs or flavor to the drink.

Service was quick and friendly, they always kept my ice water full, so no complaints there. Overall, I would definitely come back for there shaved ice, especially on those hot summer days.

I hit the spot today. Went into the Chinatown Mall in Las Vegas today since it's a must visit place when your Chinese (well, this applies to any city). We were craving for some good Taiwanese food (something a little better than Tea Planet). This place hit the spot as we walked in. 

It was very similar to Taiwan's family owned shops. You walk in and the menu is on the wall on top of the cashier. Order first, then choose the empty table that you want to sit at. As stated before, the place is a family owned restaurant. The lady behind the cashier seems to be a relative of the cooks in the kitchen. 

Anyways, as we are waiting for the food... I observed the family owned business. They were super nice to all the customers. But one thing that strucked us was the Taiwanese spoken by the girl behind the counter. She had some funny mandarin mixed with broken Taiwanese. We were speaking to her in Taiwanese and correcting her as she goes. She wasn't mad at us or anything, but it made the wait time seem short. 

Food on the other hand was excellent. I love the beef noodle soup! It was very close to what you can get in Taiwan. Broth was definitely tasty and the meat was juicy and tender. Noodles were thick and flat! Oh, and unlimited supply of preserved veges for the beef noodle soup! One more thing, try their dumplings and their cold dishes. Those hit the spot too.

4146791,2014-03-19,0,5Lcit9Zt6TF9bmKoFMhF0g,"I've lived in and traveled around China long enough to have developed a deep craving for beef noodle soup, and this place hits the spot. Amazingly delicious food can be found in the skeeziest looking shops over there. Most places, families live in the same run down shack as their ""restaurant""; so you'll often find the owners' socks and undies drying in the bathroom. You'll be faced with a few basic tables with creaky little stools, a menu board on the wall, and not much else. It takes some getting used to, but I've now come to associate the dumpiest looking shacks with the promise of the most soulfoul food. Noodle Pot is not terribly dumpy, but it does have that basic noodle hut vibe. It's tiny and simple. The menu offerings are narrow. And the soup is hearty and plentiful. Eight bucks will get you a very substantial bowl of tender beef and noodles with the ubiquitous bok choy. Make sure to doctor it up with plenty of whatever is in the jars and bottles on the table (most likely dark vinegar, soy sauce, and chili paste). Then say so long, tuck in and disappear. The flavors are deep and satisfying, right on the money. One senses that many hours have gone into the rich broth and meltingly tender beef. The noodles don't appear to be hand made, as they lack the characteristic tenderness and touthsomeness. These are fine, but they don't make the dish which is all about the beef and the broth. Rather disappointing was the cold cucumber dish I ordered. In China the crushed cucumber dish is about as standard a way to begin a meal as the bread basket is in the west. Over there you will get fresh chunks of crunchy cukes dressed lightly with rice vinegar, and often accompanied by peanuts. Cold, crunchy, salty, a bit of sour--it's a freakishly addictive way to begin a meal. The one I received at Noodle Pot was a sad, pale version of the standard. The cucumbers were soft and wilted, with almost no crunch or flavor. They had clearly sat too long and should not have been served. 

Service is a non-issue in a joint like this. The gals take your order, bring your food and largely ignore you unless you flag them down. This is the norm in China, where you have to shout at the servers to get their attention. It isn't considered rude for them to ignore you, or for you to holler across the room at them. It's all business here; you come in, sit down, order your dishes, and start slurping. The evening I came in plenty of folks were crowded around the tables, hunched over, slurping away. It's exactly how it should be in place like this, and its why I'll be back.",8D4jmSsMutGwnphZ1BktOg,2,0,3,Yga27Zn1VYm1cQq_V51bPg

My gripe isn't the food but the service and management. So I ordered Beef Noodle Soup, which only a few minutes soon after, I grabbed the waitress's attention and requested my order to be substituted with wide noodles. Keep in mind, the food did not hit my table yet. The waitress said that it's already made (as in the kitchen) so my request had to be declined. 

I'm never the one to feel entitled, I'm super understanding, and try to find a middle ground. Rather, she chose to shove this deal breaker to me. As this bowl of soup and noodles is skated onto my table, I'm just looking at my order as if it was forced upon me. I wasn't pleased as a customer, it wasn't the exact order which I had asked for, but yet, I'm expected to not only pay, but also eat it in misery. Out of all places, I chose Noodle Pot. And yet, this is how they chose to treat a regular. If they were smart about their business, with just a small accommodation, they could of made money on the ROI. As I continuously kept returning, especially with friends and family.

Long story short, I told the waitress/cashier lady that I don't think it's right to charge me for something I didn't eat. I initially was going to pay for my order but I pulled my card out because it didn't sit right with me. I said I didn't eat it because it is not what I requested as an order. She blamed me for not requesting wide noodles from the get go. She said she would modify my order and ring me up a new order as long as I paid for the first order. So essentially, she wanted me to pay for two orders. These bowls are $13 each. And I know they're also expecting a tip. She said she was the supervisor and I asked to speak to someone above her. 

I was handed the phone with the manager to come to a resolution. As I'm explaining to the manager over the phone, he tells me that the waitress said that I've already ate the food. The phone was passed back and forth as they're speaking in Chinese and I'm explaining over the phone to the manager in English. Furious and frustrated, I told him that I'm not paying, and with that said, that I won't return back. The manager said and I quote, ""yeah don't comeback, we don't want people like you, but you still have to pay"". I wasn't going to leave cheated and hungry. And I didn't really want to simply walk out because it is not right. But I did coz i don't hand over my money to bad servicing cheaters.",DlssIuh_ZSYg2Dsfxo3YdQ,1,0,1,gStJxEwLvAlpHrdfc63jXQ

Noodle Pot is a little shop in the main Chinatown Plaza. Parking is free and never an issue and there is plenty of boba/dessert/bars to go to nearby. 
The restaurant has less than 10 tables and no one seems to speak English. I'm glad my partner spoke Mandarin, because they seemed to become more welcoming once they knew we knew what we were doing. Whew. 

The food is good and according to my Taiwanese friend, as authentic as you can get in Vegas. We ordered the noodles, beef roll and dumplings. The dumplings were good, but a little disappointing when I saw them pull out a giant bag of frozen dumplings from the freezer next to me. Do that where I can't see, guys.

It looked busy, I Yelped it and saw that it had gotten a decent reviews, so why not. Ordered a bowl of their signature beef noodle soup (in English on the menu overhead it all says ""beef noodle soup"" but they come with different things, like tendon, beef, etc.). We were seated right away as there was a table available, but while we were waiting for our food, a woman asked if someone was sitting there. We said no, and she plopped herself down while her hubby ordered food. We thought she just needed to get off her feet, but nope she was settling down and her husband sat right next to her. Okay, then.

Our beef noodle soup was okay, but they made it spicy at first and then said it only comes that way. I told her that the waitress said that they could make it non-spicy so then it took a while to come out. There are only about 10 tables in there, so don't expect to get seated right away if they're busy. We ordered the pork chop rice and when it came, I was like, ""Where's the batter?"" That's the first time in my life that I've ordered pork chop rice and it came like it was broiled. Weird. It tasted okay, but it's like going to KFC and ordering fried chicken and you come home and open the bucket and it's grilled chicken. Sucks.

It was about $8 each and you get plenty of food, but the noodles weren't the homemade kind I like and they weren't QQ enough. You know what I mean. Probably won't go back next time I'm in Vegas.

I learned from my Taiwanese/Chinese friend that no one makes beef stew noodle the same, so I always keep an open mind to the different recipes and flavors. However, I was not as impressed with the food here. The broth was a lot thicker and oilier than other restaurants that I have tried. The food came out extremely fast, and it tasted as though they had kept the same broth warm all day (it was salty). Also, the broth already comes spicy (I usually have to ask to add spice elsewhere). I wanted to try their thick/wide noodles, but they had ran out that day.

This rating is solely on food, even though I feel like the restaurant could improve a little bit on their service. There were no spoons at our table, so I had to look around and grab some myself from their counter. I'm not a big stickler for those kinds of things, but I know some might find it to be bad service.

i was born and grew up in taiwan, so you can trust my review that this is probably one of the most authentic taiwanese restaurant in chinatown.

i ordered the beef noodle soup with no beef (i'm not a vegetarian, just wasn't craving meat) and they happily accommodated to my order. it was good and normally i would prefer my noodles to be a little thicker but i can definitely taste the taiwanese! 

i also tried the pork chop and it was delicious as well, they cook it as stew so it's not your ordinary pork chop!

The beef roll was interesting, it's very sweet... like dessert sweet. The beef is tender and the fresh herbs and egg inside give it a light fluffy texture which I loved, but the sauce was too sweet or there was just too much of it for my taste.

We were reading some of the Yelpers reviews and gave it a shot! We wanted some beef noodles.

1.  The noodles - What the heck?  They did not buy this stuff from the store did they?  I found that the noodles here were white noodles , but slightly larger than the norm. The texture was awesome and the taste was literally a leap year from the regular noodles I have tried.

2.  Tenderloin Beef Noodle Soup - So delicate, tasty beef. Just the write cut of beef with a bit of tender fat and melt in your mouth beef.  The soup was very nice, subtle hints of the green onion and parsley gave it a very distinct flavor. This is what the wife ordered, but I kept on stealing a bit to give it a taste.

3.  Beef Stew Noodle Soup.  I love chinese style beef stew and this meat was the perfect balance of spice, taste, texture and delicacy. Would the word buttery be best to use?  This soup is slightly spicy, with a darker more salty flavor.  This is the first time I have drank the entire bowl of soup after the noodles and meat were finished off.  That is how good this soup was.

They have other items I haven't tried. The menu is a slip of paper with the items on it and you mark it off just similar to a sushi order sheet.  You kinda have to know what the noodles are and the other dishes are, or look at the pictures in the window.

I am coming back with the kids to try many more things, the dumplings, the fried noodles and etc.

I've had the beef noodle soup a few times and its pretty consistent.  The broth, although dark, is not very salty (the times that I've had it anyway) and had a good flavor.  The beef is very tender and melts in your mouth.   I've also tried their wonton soup, which is good, but pales in comparison to the beef noodle soup.  I wish they had siracha there - it would make my soup complete (but that's just my personal taste).
 
If you're in the mood for rice, don't hesitate to try to the pork chop over rice.  A breaded pork chop and it comes with some minced pork over the rice.  Very good!  I like to take the extra beef from my soup and eat it with the rice.
 
The place itself is pretty modest.  Nice service and normally quick, although last time we were here they forgot to give me my side of rice until the end of my meal when it was already pointless.  But I like the food so that's what keeps me coming back!

The noodles are usually cooked soft with just a bit of bite. If it were up to me, I would prefer them a little more chewy. But the broth has a light to medium body and is packed full of flavor and I can honestly say that the broth alone makes up for a limp noodle. On top of it all, the braised beef and tendon are always tender and delicious. And it's all served with a healthy serving of fresh and pickled vegetables. After trying a few other noodle dishes here, I came to the conclusion I don't like any of it. But if I'm feeling frisky, I'll mix in a Beef Roll with my noodle soup. Noodle Pot's beef roll is a popular Taiwanese finger food. Scallion, cilantro, sweet/savory hoisin sauce, and tender chunks of beef shank are rolled in a slightly chewy pancake. At first glance, I would compare it to a crepe-like burrito. I suggest digging in with your hands and dipping in a bit of black vinegar. Delicious!

Decor is your typical no-frills, family-owned, Asian hole-in-the-wall. Nothing fancy, but always clean. Their English isn't the best either so if you don't know your basic Chinese just point at the number you want. All in all, service is friendly enough to make this a quick stop for a bite to eat.

Noodle Pot is located in Chinatown of Las Vegas, in a small shopping center, and is always busy with customers when I go. It seats about 40 people on the inside, so if you are going with a pretty big party (6+) at a peak time, I would say be prepared to wait a bit, but the food is definitely worth the wait.

Even when it is busy and I order the ????? (No. 1) on the menu and other people in my party order other dishes, the food never takes more than 10 or 15 minutes to come out. The store sells other Taiwanese side and main dishes that taste delicious as well, but none as good as the beef noodle soup.

The store has free wifi, and for all you Pokemon Go fans, is located close to three Pokestops as well. But don't just come for the free wifi, definitely try some soup as well!",ont98hwBj4o5pBkyP-qxvg,2,0,4,HehY6PE2WsxtC3NjTuGREw

They recently started accepting credit/debit cards (over $20), which should allow them to increase their business. I usually order the traditional Spicy Beef Noodle Soup aka: #1 on the menu. The noodles are freshly made and very soft and tender. The soup broth has so much flavor with herbs and a good portion of meat. The only thing is sometimes they put too much soup (which I don't mind), or they don't put enough; so if you like to have a very tasty soup and they don't put enough soup broth in it; just ask and they will add more soup broth. 

My wife always orders the Minced Pork Noodles which is a dry soup with a creamy pork creation poured over the dry noodles (again - made freshly in house). Then we the won-ton in chili soy sauce which will compliment any entree you order if you like a little kick to the meal.

We ordered:
1) Beef Stew Soup Noodle (lamian)- wide noodles. Its a hearty, rich soup. Noodles are perfectly cooked, light and chewy goodness! Remember good korean & chinese noodles should have a bite, not soggy or too soft!

2) Pork Chop Rice- the pork was not greasy at all, the ran out of rice so they gave up a bowl of vegetable broth with bok choy and regular noodles. The broth was very very light & had a slight hint of an onion taste!

3) Zha Jian (lamian)- wide noodles. Its the orginal version of a korean chachang myeun. Sooo refreshing with the cucumbers lbean sprouts! This was my fav!

4) Boiled Dumpling (chives)- mmmm tastes like my mom's homemade dumpling. Chives & shrimp chunks. 

5) Meat cold dish combination- marinated tripe, pork, tendon. The sauce they used has a nice, slight spiciness to compliment the meats.

Overall, my bf, friends and I would definitely come back here. We can't believe this place opened up last november. Also, you know they use real ingredients & not msg when you walk out without being thirsty :)

I've never had it here until my husband took me here when we were still dating. And then my parents would often bring take out back from their Henderson location. 

One thing for certain is that they give you a nice hearty portion when you order their beef noodle soup. The bowl is giant, even when you order the take out version. A lot of the times, I can't finish an order myself. They give you a lot of noodles, which are cooked perfect -- it has a nice chewy, firm texture to it. They also give you plenty of beef but not all the beef is tender -- some are a bit tough but the flavor is great either way. The soup base is really good, probably filled with MSG but that's probably better than it being bland. The only thing is that I wish it was a bit spicier .. it wasn't very spicy. I typically have to add more chili paste/oil to it when I eat it. 

What's great is that this place is usually opened until midnight. If you got some late night cravings, you can always come here. And by late night, I mean Cinderella late. The server that we had was really nice and quick. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to come.

I'd like to try their beef rolls some other time and maybe some other soup. For now, it's decent enough. Good enough. It's perfect coming at night (opens till 2am on Fri-Sat, and 12am the rest of the week) or when it starts to get cold again.

I also wanted to get away from the strip for a little bit so ventured over to the ""china town"" all along Spring Mountain. This place got great reviews for their nul ro mein and dumplings so I picked this place. 

It's a smaller but cozy mom and pop with friendly servers. Although the hot tea was served in plastic water cups, it was pretty tasty and went perfectly with the meal. Unfortunately, they ran out of the wide noodles for the nul ro mein so I just went for the regular beef noodle soup sinced I didn't want the spice. The broth was light and slightly tangy from the pickled cucumbers. Even though I didn't have the thick noodles, the thin noodles were pretty good. They definitely tasted home made and a slight chew to them which I love. The beef was thinly sliced and somewhat rubbery/chewy - I was definitely not a fan.

Overall, I've had better bowls of noodle soup elsewhere and left slightly disappointed. Then again, I didn't have the spicy beef noodle soup or have the wide noodle either.",vhDL0RHifIgEdWytB1yrSg,0,0,3,QjX0NgQt52KNclpL-IleJg

My mother is from Taiwan and I visit yearly to see family.  I grew up eating authentic Taiwanese cuisine which is the best Chinese cuisine in the world.  Sorry Hong Kong.  The spicy beef noodle soup is outstanding almost as good as the version in Taiwan which is quite famous. This place reminds me of my mother's home cooking with very traditional dishes.  The beef noodle soup is hearty and rich in beef flavor with succulent beef chunks including tendon, baby bok choy, pickled mustard, cilantro and just perfect noodles.  My favorite appetizer is the beef wrap with thin green onion egg pancake encased around marinated beef slices, cilantro with hoisin sauce.  And you must order the wontons with spicy chili sauce!

Thanks to yelp, we found one in LV's Chinatown that's highly rated. 

Service was very good. Specially accommodating a big group (w/ kids in tow)
Food came out fast and the soups come out pipping hot. 

Here's some of the rundown. 
Beef and Tendon Stew Soup w/ Noodles (Spicy) - the soup was very flavorful, the noodles were perfect, the beef was super tender and delicious. The tendons on the other hand were very very tough. It's a shame, a 5 star soup became very disappointing. 

Beef and Tendon Soup w/ noodles (not spicy) my wife's order was the same as my soup. Everything was good except the tendons. My sister in law had the same soup & she had tender tendons. (She got the first bowl) we got ours about 5 minutes after she got hers. I think the tendons were not yet ready. Like my wife said, 10 more minutes of cooking those tendons might have helped, I agree. 

Crispy Chicken Leg Rice. Delicious. The chicken had a five spice rub concoction on it and it was fried perfectly. The rice had some mince pork & sauce on it. Yummy. It also came with half a hard boiled egg and a couple of vegi side dish, both very good as well. This dish was for my son, but me and my wife ended up eating the whole thing, sans the chicken skin which my boy scarfed down. I highly recommend this dish. 

Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal. The kids specially liked the dumplings. 

The hot soup certainly warmed us up at least enough to brave the cold LV night and back to our warm hotel.

We were pleasantly surprised by how good this Taiwanese place was and very comparable to the Bay Area. The beef and tendon noodle soup was my favorite dish here. It had so many noodles and it was quite chewy and long. The broth was extremely flavorful albeit a bit salty. The cold vegetables were indeed very cold. Tofu, pickled cucumber, and seaweed tasted like it had just been defrosted. Grilled bok choy had plenty of garlic on it  and is a solid vegetable dish.

Here is what we got:

1. Spicy Beef Noodle Soup with stew beef - it had good flavor but nothing special. our bowl came with some tendons though which was hard to chew.

2. Plain Beef Noodle Soup with flank - very plain taste with random vegetables (almost looked like a bowl of Pho)

3. Sauteed season veggies with garlic - overcooked boy choy, very soggy.

4. Beef Roll - this I will give them credit for, it was pretty tasty, I like the addition of peanuts and egg in here, not your average beef roll. But it was pretty greasy.

The service was friendly and not too busy on a Friday night. But would I come here again? Probably not. You can find better beef noodle somewhere else in my opinion.",tOY3WLorYiO1zBOsl6QYLQ,2,1,2,ucf07OtsECZWYF7401loCQ

I finally came here with another Yelper for dinner and to give their food a try. The restaurant was not busy at all (I was the only in there while I waited for my friend), so service was quick when we placed our order.

I ordered the Beef Noodle with wide noodles $7.99.  The flavor was good,the noodles were chewy the way I like it, but the beef could have been braised longer.  I think China Mama and even Ay-Chung Noodle has better Beef Noodle Soup, so I will likely try something else here in the future.

My friend tried the Babo Mian, which he said was good.  $6.99

We also ordered an appetizer that was on one of the papers taped to the wall. The chicken was good, just a little pricey for the portion.

Overall, I thought the restaurant was decent.  The food was adequate. Price was alright.   WiFi is free, but there is no place to plug in your laptop.

Decor: 3/5  Nothing special.  Just a fast food restaurant kind of furniture and decorations.
Food: 3/5  Okay, but definitely room for improvement.
Service: 4/5  Efficient.
Location:  4/5  In China Town.  Close enough for the tourists staying on the Strip, and locals wanting to eat at a restaurant on Spring Mtn.

Cash only, which my friend said was the reason why he didn't dine here sooner, as he didn't have cash when he initially came here.

I had been here once before and really like it so I added it to the list of places to take them.  Well, I am proud to say that my taste buds were on point because they were big fans of Noodle Pot.  

Most of the noodle restaurants in Chinatown are Cantonese style, but Noodle Pot is  traditional Taiwanese style. On both occasions, my husband and I shared the big bowl of the Beef and tendon stew noodle soup.  It is supposed to be spicy, but we also have to add more to appease our spice needs.  The noodles are made from scratch and hand pulled every morning. The beef and tendons are oh so tender, and the broth is bursting with flavor.  

I highly recommend ordering the Beef Roll to accompany the noodle soup. The flavor combinations of the egg wrap, the cilantro, thin sliced beef, and hoisin sauce is perfection.  There are also cold dishes (pig ear, marinated cucumbers, seaweed, eggs, peanuts, etc) at the counter to accompany your noodles if you prefer.  In addition, they serve an assortment of dumplings which I have yet to try. 

I am also a big fan of the rice dishes.  I ordered a crispy chicken plate for the kids and they loved it.  The steamed rice comes with some minced beef on top and some pickled vegetables on the side. But, the crispy chicken is the true star. 

The restaurant is a true hole in the wall. (Our table was next to the freezer).  It may be difficult to find if you can't read Chinese. The Chinese Characters dominate the store front sign but be on the lookout for the tiny square of english words ""Noodle Pot"" in the corner.  The service is quick and friendly, and the flat screen TV is on a Chinese channel.
