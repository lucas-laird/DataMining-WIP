322831,2016-07-31,0,R1AVTniig8uZfPy_2ObRQg,The most subpar pizza shop in Vegas. It's not awful by it isn't good either it is just there. It is over priced and ali who made our pizza didn't listen to our order and had it ready 20 min before our scheduled pick up. I guess he was just trying to get out of work early because our scheduled pick up was 20 min before close. Needless to say the pizza was cold when we arrived. I'll stick to my regular pizza place because this was just a fail.,gLbvSSNEnBm6t0IPYHgAxg,0,0,2,dgL-dstX0SChFt8XGcXgmg

1634342,2015-12-27,14,R1AVTniig8uZfPy_2ObRQg,"Decent pizza place located in the downstairs back left corner or Pawn Plaza. I brought yelpers Rohlin and Laina here and we were supposed to go to Secret Pizza as well Inna Gadda di Pizza however we decided on just this place instead. Turns out that the people who opened Inna Gadda di Pizza are also the creators of Secret Pizza at the Cosmo. I will tell you one thing the lines here are much smaller than at SP! For now anyway.....

I guess there was some sort of mess up with our pizza while cooking. A worker told us that it didn't cook right so they brought us a free sausage calzone while they made another pizza. Nice touch and much appreciate the honestly. The sausage calzone was very good and something I'd order on another visit. It was liked by others at my table as well and I think we all wanted a bit more. Next time! They do have Boylan cane soda and refills are free. I liked my soda but found nothing that special about it and prefer Coke with real sugar. Just my own preference really.

My wife ordered a White Slice that she requested be double cut so we could split with each other just to see what theirs tasted like here and it was like a delicious garlicky cheese bread. We had a pizza called All Meat Pizza that had meatballs, sausage, and pepperoni on it. The crust was thin and cooked nicely. I like that it didn't seem overly saucy. My wife and I usually don't agree on pizza but we both enjoyed everything we ate here and Rohlin and Laina said they liked it and were impressed too. They also gave us a free cannoli with yelp check in and I gave mine away so I don't know what it tasted like but it's worth mentioning that they have a check in offer. My suggestion is to come down and try this place while it's still low-key before everyone else finds out about it and before they start charging Secret Pizza prices.",eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,17,17,4,abXm6_OZ5BNDkTamG135Kw

3519781,2016-01-07,50,R1AVTniig8uZfPy_2ObRQg,"Inna Gadda di Pizza is located downstairs in Pawn Plaza. Hubby and I first came here for lunch with Cali yelpers Rohlin and Laina A. and we all really liked our pizza and stromboli. There is a yelp check in offer for a free cannoli and all four of us had no problem redeeming it. We enjoyed our first visit enough to bring New Jersey yelper, Tony J. and he's originally from Brooklyn, so he wasn't against a few tasty slices for dinner. There isn't any seating or tables inside. You place your order inside for pizza by the slice or you can order a whole specialty pie from the menu or choose your own toppings. They also offer salad, stromboli, calzones and have a few dessert items on the menu. The prices are very fair for Downtown and I really hope they stay the way they are. Slices range from $3 - $3.50 and a cheese pizza is $18 which can easily feed 4 people. I'd recommend having a fresh pie made and eating it when it comes out of the oven instead of taking it home to have the best experience. The couple slices I had leftover later on when I got home were good, but I enjoyed it fresh from the oven much better. Besides, pizza is better when it's shared around a table with good company! They have heat lamps above most of the tables at Pawn Plaza that put off a decent amount of heat which is nice during the cooler months.

They have bottled water an Boylan products at the (free refills) fountain. The Boylan products are made with cane sugar and if you are a fan of Birch Beer, they have that. I tried the black cherry during both visits and wasn't that crazy about it. I found it personally to be lacking in flavor and fizz and would have preferred an ice cold coca cola.

White Slice ($3.50) - mozzarella, garlic cream, house-smoked tomatoes, dollops of ricotta and a pesto drizzle. This was a last minute add-on. Laina and I were both looking at the white slices they had displayed for sale and just kind of looked at each other and said ""I want to try that"" so with no hesitation we were both hollering at my hubby who was at the register to add a slice of the white to try. I asked if they would mind double-cutting the slice since we'd be sharing it to sample and it wasn't an issue. We ended up sharing the slice with our husbands and we all really liked it. I'd have no problem coming back and ordering a whole one!

Sausage Stromboli ($6) - This was brought to our table complimentary by one of the guys working because he said there was a problem with the way our pizza cooked and he wanted to make a fresh one so we had a pizza that was the way it should be. Wow that was nice! The stromboli was 4 pieces and I'm usually not a sausage fan, but really liked this! It would make a nice meal on its own or is perfect as an appetizer.  

All Meat Pizza ($23.25) - This pizza has pepperoni, sausage and meatball on it. The pizza was a good size as were the slices. I liked the thin crust, taste of the sauce and the amount of cheese. The toppings could have been put on a little more even, but they didn't skimp on the amount used. We were all full and satisfied,  

Pepperoni Pizza ($19.75) - There was a good amount of pepperoni and cheese. A good thin crust and big slices. The pizza here is ""fold and eat"" all the way for me, but they do have utensils inside if you prefer to eat your pizza that way. They also have cheese, crushed red peppers and napkins that you can bring to your table, just be courteous and return what you take back inside when your are done. 

Cannoli ($3) - On my first, us four yelpers got ours free with the yelp check-in offer. I found the shell to be a bit hard and the filling had a nice citrus flavor, but was also a stiff and not creamy. The next visit when the yelper I was with redeemed his check-in offer the guy working asked about hubby and I, so I mentioned that we had already used ours on a previous visit. He said to give them to us anyway, very nice! This time the shell was the right crispness and the filling was creamy and had just the right amount of citrus flavor. 

The employees working on both visits were really friendly and helpful. They came outside and checked on our table making sure we enjoyed our food and to see if we needed anything. I don't make a point to go Downtown too often anymore, but will make the effort to stop by here again in the future for date nights with hubby and when I have friends or family in town.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,62,62,4,93h8QKI2wR75nf4fGF42rQ

There is no seating inside the pizza place, When I checked in on Yelp I received a coupon for a single complimentary cannoli. The manager/chef knew we were all yelpers so he decided to give us three complimentary cannoli's for my one coupon. That was very nice of him. He mentioned his owner was also from N.Y. I was really surprised how tasty the pizza was as well as the cannoli. Marc rated the place 4 stars. I agree with Marc in rating the place at least 4 stars or possibly 4.x, but, not 5 stars.

I look forward to returning again in April to enjoy another pizza with Christie L. and Marc S.",ncvgNeEsAIAuMWYFN2blhg,26,26,4,q5305hRoep4kPI1_6UVC2A

4227197,2016-01-27,10,R1AVTniig8uZfPy_2ObRQg,"I'm a HUGE fan of NYC style pizza.  When I saw Rohlin A.'s review that this place was the sister location to Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan without the markup, I had to try when I was in town.  So I dragged my poor boyfriend to Inna Gadda di Pizza early in the morning.  We arrived before they opened so we went to the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn shop a la Pawn Stars fame next door to kill some time.  

Once we walked back to the pizza place, we were the first customers and ordered a slice of pepperoni ($3.50), a slice of white pizza ($3.50) and 2 Boylan natural cane sugar sodas ($2.50 ea.) from the fountain.  With Yelp check-in, we received free cannoli which are filled to order.  We grabbed our sodas at the fountain, then sat down at the bar stools inside to wait for them to heat the slices in the oven.  The pizzas were ready quickly and we dug in.  It was perfectly crisp on the bottom with oozy cheese.  I eat my giant slices folded so that I get crispy bites from the top and bottom without burning my mouth with the molten cheese.  The white pizza slice was as good as I remembered with that hit of garlic.  It was so good, we ordered two more slices: a pepperoni for me and an all meat slice ($4.50) for him.  

The lemon zest cannoli was the perfect size too.  It was crispy on the outside and paired well with the soft, creamy filling.  It reminded me of the cannoli I had in Rome.  I had the cherry cola soda which was really good too.  Service was excellent.  Both of the guys behind the counter were really friendly and asked we were locals or from out of town.  I wish I didn't live so far away!  If you're looking for a cheap but delicious and satisfying lunch, Inna Gadda di Pizza should be on your radar.",_pBzBgtCTN9PNUPfgPDI8A,16,16,5,jJMvds7iq7GV-dobE2cxYA

(I've tried other combinations here with mixed results, but they nail the one above every time. Note: The extra cheese request is VERY important because they are light on the cheese as a rule.)

I almost overlooked this spot since pizza seemed like a possible waste of food crawl space, but then figured why not. I am so glad that we stopped here. We split a slice of Pepperoni Pizza and a Pepperoni Stromboli. The pizza was thin and crispy with great flavor. The Pepperoni Stromboli was amazing. The bread had a great flavor and literally the perfect amount of crisp I can imagine. There was a slight crisp on the outside and then the bread was flaky and delicious inside. The inside was loaded with pepperoni and mozzarella. Absolutely up there with the best Stromboli I've ever had from a pizza spot.

4871943,2016-01-06,140,R1AVTniig8uZfPy_2ObRQg,"This was our last meal in Las Vegas and we were introduced to this pizza joint by local Yelpers extraordinaire Christie L. and Marc S. and they graciously picked up the bill as well (greatly appreciated)!  The original plan was to do a pizza crawl from Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan and ending at Inna Gadda.  After discovering the same people had opened both places, we opted to skip Secret Pizza (the more expensive location) and grab a good-bye Vegas lunch at Inna Gadda.

The claim to fame for this area is the proximity to World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop which is the focal point of the History Channel's Pawn Stars.  There was literally a line of people wrapping around the building just to get in and meet the workers.  Inna Gadda is located ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inna-gadda-di-pizza-las-vegas-2?select=MDEN4DqdbIvsQlXfSFgFHQ ) next door in Pawn Plaza on the lower level at the end furthest from the street.

We arrived pretty early in the day, but there were already plenty of pies available if you wanted to order by the slice:

( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inna-gadda-di-pizza-las-vegas-2?select=4cdPvdVDfrIAUY2klXNTYA )

The menu ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inna-gadda-di-pizza-las-vegas-2?select=NYWmEUP4HuiA18efZcfzEA ) is pretty simple with one size of pie, pizza by the slice, a decent amount of toppings, four specialty pizzas, calzone, stromboli, two types of salad, pure cane soda fountain ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inna-gadda-di-pizza-las-vegas-2?select=w-YFLcCIhjzZq4avEHbh0w ) and desserts.  There is an offer for a free cannoli ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inna-gadda-di-pizza-las-vegas-2?select=PCnr9afYUdZUywv5b9mVgA ) with your Yelp check in.

In addition to the cannolis, we ordered an All Meat Pizza ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inna-gadda-di-pizza-las-vegas-2?select=QLAyt6o0rmPEu6o5Lq82xA ) and a slice of White Pizza ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inna-gadda-di-pizza-las-vegas-2?select=YEjP8Y9GbfiNCGdemTyDsg ) to split between the four of us.  A few of us also sampled the Boylan Pure Sugar Sodas and I believe the consensus was these sodas were okay, however I thoroughly enjoyed the black cherry version.

Seating is very limited with just a couple of tables outside in the plaza area and I don't recall any seating inside the restaurant.  This leads me to believe most of the orders are of the to-go variety.

While we were waiting for our pizza, the manager came out with a free sausage stromboli ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inna-gadda-di-pizza-las-vegas-2?select=gXakCJSeCo_jOeK28HoVyg ) because our initial pizza didn't cook right (the oven was on strike) and the pizza had to be re-fired.  

Rohlinism:  If your oven is killing the business, try killing the customers with kindness!

The manager also threw in an extra cannoli with our free ones with check in.  The re-fire didn't take that long and we had the stromboli and slice of white pizza to keep us company while we waited.

The sauce and crust were very good and my only real complaint would be the toppings were a little uneven on the pizza.  The price is a little on the higher side, but the quality of pepperoni, meatballs and sausage was very good.  The better half is a ""cheese fiend"" and I heard no complaints about a lack of cheese on the pizza.  There doesn't seem to be any savings ordering a specialty pizza as opposed to ordering a cheese pizza and adding toppings.  The white pizza had a very good flavor and was particularly pronounced in the garlic department (love that garlic breath!) and the stromboli was a hit with the group as well.  The cannolis were decent and there was a lemon zest added to the mascarpone, but the pastry dough was a little over fried for my taste.  Not something I would order if I was paying $3.00 a pop, but they make a really good check in offer!

The staff and manager were very friendly and attentive during our visit.  The manager and one of the workers came out a few times to make sure we were enjoying our pizza and stromboli.

This location is more downtown and off the strip, but it is worth seeking out and they have some interesting artwork in the center too, sorry about the lack of photographic evidence to support my assertion!",ax7SnXOTIpatbsmqHLqVow,151,146,4,b1HqNC6Q0aia_uhtxFybRw

Located in the increasingly busy Pawn Plaza, but still more of a 'secret' than the unnamed space owned by the same group at The Cosmopolitan, Inna Godda di Pizza occupies the downstairs corner pocket furthest from The Strip and featuring similar pies to those that have impressed both critics as well as the late night Marquee crowd ever since opening a visit to the month old space was every bit as good as the original, even an early morning oven malfunction not preventing a pair of freshly made pies from shining.

Not remotely a New Yorker, nor one to romanticize late nights slurping a soggy ""99cent slice,"" it was with the same standards and biases as always that I entered Inna Gadda di Pizza, and although Foghat played in place of expected Iron Butterfly while the owner explained that an overnight oven shutdown had delayed the day's preparations it was with a little patience and conversation that minutes passed, each dough rolled out and hand stretched before careful topping, the $3 Red and $3.50 White by-the-slice options quickly sold to a steady stream of traffic, the vast majority visiting from out of town.

Proudly touting the use of ingredients that justify paying a few cents more per bite, suffice it to say that compared to ""Secret Pizza"" the prices trend a bit lower at the new location, and with a nice char imparted to the crust by ""about ten minutes at five-fifty"" both the bright and zingy red sauce beneath melted Mozz and garlic cream with dollops of ricotta plus house-smoked tomatoes were on par with the best in the genre, the fifty-cent toppings and absolute steal for a handful of marinated artichoke hearts while pepperoni was a touch oily and less well-spiced than expected.

Surprisingly offering three desserts, all made n house and ranging $2-$4 each, anyone filling cannoli to-order deserves support and taking the time to match crisp shells to sweet cheese tinged in citrus the two-bite pastries were delightfully light yet extremely flavorful, a spot less less praise offered for a small bowl of tiramisu that seemed a bit too soggy at its base despite generous coffee notes while the seemingly out-of-place Black & White was smaller than most, yet moist and fluffy enough that you may want two.

****About as good as it gets for a ""slice shop"" particularly on Las Vegas Boulevard for less than $4, Inna Gadda di Pizza is only likely to get better with time and seasoning of the ovens, a few small tweaks potentially capable of making this the first ""must-visit"" spot at Pawn Plaza for locals as well as tourists.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,18,12,4,eNoAMjyMA9xB1hL5DroGZA
