You're lucky I'm not your manager there because I'd fire your ass quicker than you could imagine is possible. Horrid customer service with whoever the rude arrogant chick bartender is at night there. I'll go elsewhere, thanks.",Qn_M0DGu6DJoSiPDCN2vMw,1,0,1,9dgXVhxJTTujvH_lrSPEuQ

She messed up our check twice and charged our cards way more then what was suppose to be charged, if she was willing to listen to the directions given to charge out the bill she would have gotten a better tip",fiRmXs7MmY0_Jsv9_Xq24w,2,0,2,0FwU1iX1EEGsoWMcC6wmhg

813860,2015-04-24,0,b5uCtk5iUcdeSWBNAx40Ug,"I recently been calling this location ""my spot"" because my friends and I have been going there frequently as of late. Food is pretty good and thanks to my fave bartender Derek, he has introduced  me to my new favorite beer, 'Blue Moon Peach.'  He even had it ready for me without even asking. Score! So delicious ice cold and on draft. I suggest every try it. I also enjoy the fresh potato chips and bucket fries. Great place to go anytime, but esp after a hard days work. It's not a loud place, so it's easy to talk to your buds and chill. Thanks Derek and the rest of the staff for the great customer service, beer, food, and occasional small talk.",6-0rX6Pl4uAKX96x-9-dkw,0,0,5,wdKxJBdXmZt-YortnNkv3w

 Only problem I had was I am a ex-smoker. And had to take a shower when I got back to the hotel because of all the cig smoke! But it's Vegas and that's to be expected I guess. anyway I wont go back simply because of the smoke but the food and service was great.",DnR7_8I8IkVMWC6GnlUSPw,1,0,3,LDEJfXJZ0Gwe9VOeVQJVJw
1317368,2012-03-08,0,b5uCtk5iUcdeSWBNAx40Ug,"This is the only PT's that I like. Derek is the most amazing bartender ever!  I've been going here for 6 years and I drive out of my way now to go there.

Let me put it this way.  Once you've been in a time or two, you will be greeted the next occasion at your favored sitting place with the drink that you ordered. For instance, my ginormous Miller Lite is sitting at my favorite place and bartender greets me with a bump before my butt hits the seat.  ...and greeted by name.

It doesn't get any better than that!",bxSVDML7aZZvHAzlgLcfAA,0,0,5,WIShe9hOgtMHoSi8BFzKzg
1412714,2016-02-04,0,b5uCtk5iUcdeSWBNAx40Ug,Enjoyed the nachos! Service was quick. Place was cozy. Sports on the TVs. They do need a better lunch menu. It appears to be the same menu for all times.,iduHSg0u2uFjvtUe-m52sg,0,0,4,n6v8g6SWPrHIQd7KVKx8uw
1721217,2012-05-01,0,b5uCtk5iUcdeSWBNAx40Ug,I really love most PT's but in this one I always feel uncomfortable. The two bartenders who are usually there seem like they go out of their way to be rude.  I can see that maybe they are joking but to me it's unnecessary.  Just give me a tall glass of beer with a smile it's not that difficult.,5eST1WVCNXRJYsWTwTRfSA,2,0,2,hIspV-h84kV_1FT7HAx0mw

2260238,2011-10-21,0,b5uCtk5iUcdeSWBNAx40Ug,"Great place.  Went after work at 2am and although I was one of five people, it still felt fun and welcoming.  The bartender was friendly, the drinks were delicious and even the lovely cook who had 15 minutes left of work insisted on making me some food I could have, since I'm gluten free.  My co-worker and I stayed till 4, shared her pizza with other patrons and gambled a little on the machines.  I will definitely return, as I have become a point earning card member!  LOL.  I do hope more people come out!  It's clean and has pool tables too!",t7oIAwdWbrZCHeaQNqvNIg,1,1,4,Vnimqn0IU-5ArWqguk4Sug

Machines didn't hit at all, either. 

2 stars for being a close hole-in-the-wall with decent bartenders.",KDNXgwGM_qEyIj-5NQr-mw,1,0,2,ARXQ8dAUd49lj8Pz4Jv3Ow

They were playing Justin Bieber as soon as I walked in so it was an overall great experience. Ummmmm....that's really all I have to say. I'll definitely be making this place a regular spot to get drunk.",45yTmR3CI85hfIHQKa0Yqg,1,0,5,NEEN0NZfrFf-T1lzf_CJtg
4326978,2015-07-18,0,b5uCtk5iUcdeSWBNAx40Ug,"We only come here for 2 reasons 
1. Wings  
2. Its close to the house.  

I only have two requirements for me to enjoy eating a whole bucket of wings with no shame. They need to be EXTRA CRISPY and don't bring me disgusting ranch dressing. What is wrong with people, BLUE CHEESE is the only thing that pairs well with wings. Its like a good Cab with a steak, there is no other way to eat wings!

PT's shockingly delivers on all of my wings needs. I only have one problem and thats with the bartenders who take the order. Sometimes we get lucky and we get a bartender who will see the desperation in our eyes and the seriousness in our voices and and will make sure our order is extra crispy with blue cheese. But unfortunately this is NOT the norm, bartenders here seem to hate when you have any request that requires any extra work on their part. We have sent our wings back on a number of occasions.

Although I lament over my dissatisfaction with the service I STILL come here for my wing fix.",IGBilULpgNHfKitLfrs7Hw,1,1,3,-zw6ckt-MvEp0fOdhwOI5A

Diane was the bartender and she's great. Definitely recommend stopping in while she's there. Very friendly and great service... I'll be stopping in again when in the area.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,1,1,4,fM_xcPaBn1uloHPgAjJAJA
5337046,2017-06-01,0,b5uCtk5iUcdeSWBNAx40Ug,"My friends and I have been to this PT's location for happy hour after midnight a couple of times due to its central location for all of us to meet and I have been pleasantly surprised every single time. This location is tucked away on Warm Springs behind the gas station; however, there's always plenty of parking available.

The first time we went, the kitchen was closed already; however, it wasn't a big deal. The bartender here (I forgot his name) is always super friendly and interactive. He even tried to replicate a hand grenade drink that we had during a trip to New Orleans because we told him about how we missed that drink! 

It's usually relatively ""lit"" and we have met random friends here. I prefer this location because it's never too packed or completely empty.

5/5 if you ever want a simple night with friends off of the Las Vegas strip.",52FeOAXrqwKuwZXmH5q_fw,0,0,5,YI14nKJEJMQ-Satccuso5w
5673462,2010-09-11,0,b5uCtk5iUcdeSWBNAx40Ug,"I have no idea why it insists that this location is closed... I'm a regular here and I can assure you, it is most definitely open for business!

Midnight to 4AM all drinks are half off. They have pool, darts and it's never over crowded. You'll never want to go to another scenester bar again.

The only down side is if you're looking for food after 1AM, make sure you grab it before you hit the door. Their cook leaves around then and no food will be served.",l-TGsgKkBa5KMpG9Qc78eA,2,2,5,XpnZMg_oVRW8lQ28CV-1aQ
