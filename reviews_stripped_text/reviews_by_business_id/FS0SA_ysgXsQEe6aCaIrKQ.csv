Came upon this hidden gem while searching for place to eat for lunch after an afternoon of shopping! The place is very nicely decorated and a great place to bring a date or just relax without feeling rushed to eat and leave. The chicken shawarma was perfectly seasoned, the Ojax chicken lemon soup was savory and the Mediterranean salad was fully balanced with the right amount of olives, tomatoes, chunks of feta cheese, cucumber and dressing. The staff was great and tentative. Best part of the whole meal was the affordable pricing! We thought there was a mistake when we got the check,:) This meal very easily would have been triple the price where we live in California! We'll make sure to tell all of our friends and family to stop here before heading back to California. Definitely coming back here again!
Thanks again Ojax!",xTPOgPO1mcQ-bgqhNYkRdA,1,1,5,qiwd4nyecTA9ybliYF8gOQ

We ordered the Mezze Platter. Everything on it was amazing. I had the Mediterranean Caesar Salad and the Ojax Signature Salad. Both were delicious with tons of flavor.

1333326,2018-05-15,0,FS0SA_ysgXsQEe6aCaIrKQ,"Beautiful, beautiful restaurant. The decor was stunning, very well done. The food was outstanding, got the chicken shawarma, fried octopus and hummus. I would give them 5 stars but the few things that my partner and I noticed is why I'm giving two. Our waitress expected us to order as soon as we sat down without going over the menu (telling us the specials if there were any) and didn't ask us if we wanted anything other than water to drink which she didn't refill for us but one time and that was because we flagged her to ask for water. We ordered, as stated above in addition to the fish platter and fries. About 10 mins later we got the fried octopus then shortly after the chicken shawarma. 5 mins later she comes out to tell us that they ran out of fries, which we found odd that she didn't tell us after placing our order, but we just got rice instead. About 20 mins pass and we are waiting for the fish platter and when the other waitress who wasn't ours came over to give us the rice, we asked how long till the fish platter comes out. She said she would ask for us and shortly after our waitress came and started arguing with us saying we didn't order the fish platter, which was the first thing we asked about. After that we didn't see our waitress again other than seeing her focused on servicing the owner's table. We also noticed that she was on her phone, touching her face as she was handling food and at one point was eating from the kitchen. We had to walk up to the front to pay for our food because we were never checked on during our entire dinner, she only came over because we flagged her down for water and to argue with us about what we ordered. As we were paying we were helped by the waitress that wasn't ours and our waitress didn't say bye, or acknowledged us as she was walking by us to leave. It's a shame that such a gorgeous restaurant and great food was tainted by poor service. The staff needs to learn how to service more than one table and it wasn't even busy for her to not give exceptional service (there were literally 3 tables including ours and she had only us and the owner's table) which we still left gratuity even though we believe she didn't deserve it. I most likely will not be returning and cannot say I will recommend.",74H9m--gl2ZPsIuNSsyyRg,0,0,2,3eLiivHp-3l9ahUrjwfv3A

The Greek salad was great and steak Kebab was huge and tasty.  My favorite part was the dessert. It was some Armenian dessert that I can't get out of my head to this day. Will go back just for that. The decor was fancy and romantic, perfect for date night. I took one star away for the service.  The waitress left us hanging for long periods of time without water refills or clearing out our table.

1476063,2018-04-17,12,FS0SA_ysgXsQEe6aCaIrKQ,"Mediterranean food is among my top preferred cuisines, so when Ojax opened near me, I made dinner plans with a friend to check it out. We arrived to a packed house on a Friday night, with a large party taking up much of the dining room. Tables and bar space were still available for walk-in, and staff were gracious and attentive despite the event.

Menu is large, with plenty of mezze and grilled entrees. We shared the baba ghanoush ($7), grilled octopus ($20), grilled shrimp ($13), and the smoked fish platter ($20)- everything was super fresh and well-prepared. The grilled shrimp was my favorite, served sizzling in a skillet with tomato and feta, and amply portioned for the price (~10 pieces). The octopus was spectacularly prepared with a great smoky flavor, similar to other versions around town, but slightly better portioned than elsewhere. The baba ghanoush and fish platter weren't as successful- the eggplant in the dip seemed shredded instead of pureed, which lent an oddly stringy texture to it and it went unfinished. I did like the unusual addition of pomegranate seeds for color and extra flavor, though. The fish platter had great presentation, but some fish were better than others and one in particular was striated and tough and went unfinished. The owner generously treated us to a dessert plate of house-made baklava and kataifi, both of which were among the better versions I've had in town. My only suggestion would be to make the pita bread in house or at least heat it prior to serving, as it was cold and tore easily rather than being the soft, pliable pillow that really highlights a great mediterranean meal. 

The space is beautifully decorated and has patio seating available, and combined with the food and service a notable improvement for this plaza. Looking forward to returning for some of their meatier dishes like the grilled kabobs and lamb chops.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,18,4,WszwBsiZMTtyfk-CJlPW4w

I asked the waitress if they had music every night, figuring we could come back, but she said ""every night"". So I might try to check it out at lunch, and I hope there's no live band. In my opinion, they should allow some time for family and conversations, the live music is very distracting and loud.

Their ""Ojax Signature Salad 10"" was a mixture of arugula, goat cheese, beets and much more mixed in a light red wine vinaigrette. This is the type of salad that will actually make you want to eat healthy.

We also ordered some amazing home-made falafel and steak kabobs. Both garnished with extra yummy items. 

And, as a forever fan of outdoor seating, the patio was comfortably tucked away from the strip-mall parking lot.

Upon entering this restaurant you would not expect the gorgeous decor. I was blown away, I loved the decor and set up. The bar had this beautiful feel to it and it lit up with beauty. I could totally see a girls or moms night out at that bar! 
Now this Mediterranean place is ideal for dinner, lunch and brunch. Especially if your looking for something different than your average burger and pasta.
The food is delicious and grilled, it definitely has a more healthier version compared to a lot of restaurants. Our party did end up ordering there a platter, where we could try 5 styles of meat.
My favorite out of the five was the chicken Swanson and beef grilled kabob 
It paired well with the pita bread and hummus we ordered. We did order a lot, but did we regret it? Nope, I did enjoy our meal immensely as look forward to bring a bigger party to partake on that awesome platter deal!  Plus who doesn't like a good Tahiti sauce, or hummus. My absolute favorite is that baba Ganoush, and there was delicious, if my tummy would permit it, I would eat it all day long lol.
So next time your thinking of a place to do date night, moms night out or special occasions this is your place.
Did I mention the bar has some yummy drinks and a pretty cool bartender who can make some bomb drinks and even show you some bar tricks!",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,6,5,5,NMxBW7I7RhnVo92aSg6mGA

4693331,2018-05-19,0,FS0SA_ysgXsQEe6aCaIrKQ,"This restaurant is not easy to locate being without signage and set in the back of a shopping center, but well worth the effort.  It is immense, beautiful and largely unoccupied on the Monday evening of our visit.  We were warmly greeted at the door, seated at white tablecloth table and soon served a basket containing 5 different types of bread and rolls along with olive oil and butter.  

We shared an order of baba gangush that was served with pita bread plus their eponymous salad which included fresh greens, arugula, radicchio, toasted almonds, baby greens and goat cheese tossed with red wine vinaigrette.  For entrees my wife chose the chicken kabob while I went with beef lute.  The chicken was very moist, the beef lute less so, but both were well seasoned and delicious.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,2,1,4,YR7M8GA963uOOvudo8YxWA

4706125,2018-04-04,0,FS0SA_ysgXsQEe6aCaIrKQ,"We just had dinner there and ended very disappointed. I will start with the good things: food was good-both appetizers and entrees. Typical Mediterranean cuisine. Decoration is exceptional-very high end, whoever did it is a professional. Owner/manager was very nice, but needs to be stricter with his staff. We were there for half an hour until we called so we can order. Food started coming before the drinks! It took 30 min for our drinks to come, and still some of them were missing, so we had to ""remind"" the waiters. I cannot even imagine what would happen if they had more tables (there were only 3). All the food came before I got my cocktail. Very disorganized waiters and the lady that was in the reception was giving us mean faces all night because we had kids with us. Very rude! If you have kids don't go there for dinner or lunch because you will end up with a bad experience. And you have to call them to take plates of your table otherwise nobody cares. Hopefully they will change/teach the waiters and hostess to do their job, because it will be a waste for a restaurant with such amazing decoration and good cuisine to close. At this point they are loosing clients instead of gaining.",sL6gU-0HZTb99YW0lG5J0w,0,1,1,AdW1AoAT6dpJ9hsV81aSKA

The dining room is beautiful. The decor was high-end, the Greek music playing was an awesome touch and the service put a cherry on top of everything! 

We came here as a party of three earlier today for lunch. Started off with the Baba Ganush appetizer which was fantastic. They brought out a whole basket full with different variations of bread (wheat, laffa, pita, and white breads). I ordered the Steak Kebab and I was really upset when they brought it out because it didn't come with a steak knife?? I figured I'd try it before I complain and guess what....YOU DONT NEED ONE! The steak was so soft and buttery that a regular butter knife was sufficient enough. 

My cousin ordered the Chicken Shawarma and it was huge! The flavor was great, I loved that it wasn't too oily and the chicken was soft as well. My best friend had ordered the Calamari and that had the perfect crunch on the outside and softness on the inside. 

Overall, we will totally be back. Hopefully in the evenings because every Friday evening they have live Greek music and who doesn't love that?!?!",y3BRV9BnG7OZTJ7mRcMP_A,3,2,5,zqiF6Fr29su327Td_VW_Gw
5255449,2018-04-25,1,FS0SA_ysgXsQEe6aCaIrKQ,"My husband and stopped a second time since our first visit was so good. We chose it over a place we normally go after our regular weekly outing. This time we ate inside. The decor is stunning- modern, elegant, tasteful, well done and what one expects from our high end, hospitality oriented town. It's hands down the loveliest place I've eaten outside of a strip casino. The food didn't disappoint. I tried the lemon chicken soup. It was beautifully seasoned- bright, fresh lemony with subtle spices that didn't overwhelm it. My husband and I shared the chicken shawarma. We love it, and my son snapped up the left overs again. The service was again excellent. The value is also very good. This restaurant has become our top of the list Las Vegas near off Strip go-to.",5XcehMT4Fq-MrybNqXr82w,0,0,5,70jTM1BH96gMPKIkUXdmnA

The food was delicious. My favorite was the baba ganoush. The shawarma was worth ordering again, but I still have a favorite place to go for shawarma. The portions are larger than the server led me to believe. We ended up with left overs, but no complaints about eating their food more than once. I would return, but it's in such an odd location. I guess it will be an option if I'm in the area.",N8bPJNrqCGuUAazxqO9vHA,0,0,4,evfdi6P7gfUItp18UBC9FQ

Found this place on yelp of course and after seeing some pictures and their menu... i just had to try it!

Walking up to the restaurant it gets a little confusing on where to enter this place.. there were a few gentlemen sitting at the outside patio area smoking and eating (either the manager or owner) and instructed us to walk towards that door..  ( i really dont know if that place is a designated smoking area.. thats why i guessed it was either a manager or the owner)..

walking in.. WOW.. this place truly looks and feels like a fine dining restaurant.. to the right there is a mini bar area where people can drink and hangout and could possibly wait for a table.. with a few tables where people can also eat.. theres a host table as you walk in.. and behind that there is a wall of jarred olives.. interesting!

to the left there are plenty of seats and tables that's prepped with plates and glass and utensils ready for people to sit and a long bench style seating towards the wall.. 

the lighting was just awesome !! great for those selfies of yourself or pictures of the food.. intricate designs with different color patterns on the lights.. 

there was also a spot where i can guess where live entertainment (a stage) is set to play.. since we came in during lunch there was no one there playing.. shucks.. 

ordered the chicken shwarma and my wife got a steak kabob.. and both were ridiculously amazing. the food quality was really good.. also ordered the babaganoush.. and that itself was great.. just give me more of their bread (which was also awesome) and that's it and ill be good !

staff was nice and friendly.. although i had to call for them every time i needed something because they were either cleaning something or talking to the chefs in the back.. 

all in all. this place was really great and i recommend those who love Mediterranean food to give this place a try.. not packed at all when we went during lunch so i cant speak about dinner times..

well be back for sure!!

enjoy!",A0Sy2srGc-AhXEuFoErDkw,0,0,5,tOh6g4Amz7K9cpGejYXx5g

5926059,2018-05-17,0,FS0SA_ysgXsQEe6aCaIrKQ,"I am always on the lookout for healthy and clean  restaurants with a good ambience  very difficult to find  this combination and and this location has been vacant for so long I did not pay any attention to it and the heck just happened to see the  sign  and what a surprise ! I have stopped frequenting the restaurants on the Strip since they came up with that parking fee. 

The location is one of the busiest corners in Las Vegas, namely Sahara and Decatur. It's kind of hidden away in the complex  and it's not visible from neither Decatur or Sahara, but this is quite gem of a place and the owners seems to have spent incredible amount of money and effort in turning this place into a classy restaurant and in the style of Cafe Nicole West, that used to be here long time ago, before the recession, which took  the shine away from this strip mall.

This is one of the few restaurants which has a patio dining, which is not just few chairs but it seats close to hundred people in the patio alone inside it's well lit Greek and Mediterranean ambience. There is overhead music which seems to be a Greek music. I can't make out any the lyrics but it seems to be an affection directed towards the opposite sex.

The location has changed few hands and the new owners looks like are here to stay for good.  The food is Mediterranean, which is becoming a vogue and trend for health-conscious millennials and also baby boomers. My favorite here is chicken kabob, hummus and tabbouleh with a glass of red wine.

 The menu is the mainstay in any Mediterranean cuisine. The wine list is adequate and reasonably priced, service is good. I think I have found a place where I can feel happy about spending my money since I know I'm getting healthy food at decent prices and the parking is a breeze not to mention there is no fee to park !!",QsznkLEL_ljuk6UUMd1ukg,0,0,5,xqDP8qZLBoEJ5GTEi_ErVw
