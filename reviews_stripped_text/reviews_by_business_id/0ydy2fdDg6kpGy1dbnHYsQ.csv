Anthony, a nice young gentleman helped me figure out the best way to utilize my gift cert. I tried the stuffed jalapeños which were awesome, the guac which was so flavorful, the chicken fajitas which were classically delicious, the chicken chimichanga which somehow was lightly crispy on top of being a normal chimi. I was very impressed with that. I also had a crunchy taco which was almost what I would consider cantina style because of how light and crispy the shell was. I definitely recommend the tacos. When I was finished he even gave me a cup to go of my soft drink. I would definitely go back to this place again.

For dinner, I ordered the chicken enchiladas. It comes with three and you can choose green or red sauce. I'm horrible at making decisions so I had to get both and am glad I did because they were equally delicious. I almost ate my entire plate and wasn't even that hungry.

First time was okay when they first opened and so we decided to give it another try tonight. We walked in about 7:15 pm to a nearly empty dining room and was not ""seated"" by anyone. We just sat anywhere we wanted.
It took about 5 minutes to be acknowledged by a server with menus, then another few minutes to get the usual chips and salsa. They advertised large margaritas for $7 so we decided to split one. Medeocre at best....mostly sweet & sour mix. ***Applebee's serves a killer Cadillac Margarita for the same price and amount....just comparing. ;-)  We ordered the special which was a 2 taco plate with rice & beans, guacamole, sour cream & pico de gallo and a soft @ $8.99.   I had the chicken and it was pretty good.  My husband ordered the beef, which I did not care for,  because I'm not fond of hamburger tacos.
After finishing our meal, we waited for our check....waited and waited and waited as we were passed by so many times. Finally, after nearly 15 minutes we were able to leave. 
As convenient as this place is to the timeshare we stay at, I'd rather risk losing a good parking spot and drive elsewhere. It's a shame...it has the potential to be great as location & prices are good.  Just needs some help in management & staff training.

We made a reservation on Yelp for a party of 6, and upon arrival they had our table ready and waiting.  Our party was running late so I took the liberty of having a few cocktails in the Loung Area which is just off to the side of the restaurant.  They have a few gaming machines to keep you occupied.  Very clasy looking bar with a friendly bartender. 

After being seated the service was prompt and attentive, drinks and the food came out quickly.  We tried the guacamole that's made table side, success!  Taste was right on. 

I had a steak dish with some sweet potato fries, the steak was a little dry for my liking so I asked for some cilantro butter and that pairing was delicious.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food.

We had Caramel Flan, and a few other things for desert. The Caramel Flan was AMAZING. So perfect, didn't leave that nasty bitter after taste you usually get. 
The manager and owner greeted our table with warm smiles and a sincere thanks for being among the first customers.  The bill was reasonable for a party of 6.

When she finally noticed me , I asked for a menu , and she gave me a bar menu , I asked for a full dinner menu , and ordered the chicken quesadilla (a couple bucks cheaper) from bar menu and carnitas tacos from reg menu at this point , I was ready to order a drink but she disappeared ( not even water ) when she came back I had to repeat my order and said ""quesidilla first "" she then repeated my order back to me wrong !! So I had to correct Her again ! She then went off again and still no drink ! I got chips and salsa , with 2 salsas , then she finally came back and asked if I wanted anything to drink , I ordered a drink that I had ordered previously , the cosmorita but she said they don't have the ingredients to make it. ??? Wtf ??? So I ordered a reg margarita , eh!! That came out about the same time as my food, which appetizer and entree were together !! And with no silverware !! The food runner noticed and luckily brought me some ! At this point a skinney Hispanic guy and stocky women came into bar , and I'm assuming they were managers , but neither noticed or bothered to ask how things were , and they were in the seat next to me!! The quesidillas had bones in it !! Luckily on last bite ! And by the time I got to tacos they were cold and flavorless , about 50% salsa the rest tortilla and then meat in that order !! I gave up on eating and moved everything off to the side ! At this point still no one came to ask how anything was !! Another guy walked in bar and sat next to me , after about 5 to 10 mins the skinney Hispanic man , asked him if he had been helped and he politely said no and ordered a drink , he was served by the Hispanic man , and about 5 min later the bartender asked if he needed anything !! She then noticed that my plates were stacked and asked if she could take them ! There was no "" was everything ok ?"" Nothing ! Not even an offer for another drink which was sitting empty !! Eventually the Hispanic man came back and asked if I needed anything else , I just asked for check and he yelled out to bartender to get it for me! Which took another few minutes because she didn't have a pen , they had to ask the guy next to me for the pen back !! Finally got the check and paid & got my change from a 100$ bill plus 65 cents in nickels !! Btw some people at bar got 2 salsas others 3 ?? All in all I would never be back !! If I wanted bad margaritas , overpriced so-so food ( which I was charged full price for quesidilla and not the bar price ) there are many other choices to be had !! And as I quote one of the servers who was one of the 6 at bar when asked by another patron who was sitting at a bar table if this was his restaurant "" he said heck no , if I open a restaurant , it's going to be an Italian one !!

4353364,2014-08-17,0,0ydy2fdDg6kpGy1dbnHYsQ,"We stopped here because it was literally the first place we came across after leaving the airport. I'm so glad we did. 

The food, drinks, and service were so good we ended up celebrating our engagement there. 

My fiancée had the carne asada. He's an incredibly picky eater and he loved it. The steak was perfect. Tender and tasty. I had a veggie combo. They were all excellent and had really great veggies cooked perfectly. Still crisp and flavorful. No pile of over cooked zucchini to be seen. I adored my food. We got the guacamole and it was super tasty, fresh, with good chips. I had an El Tambien drink and thoroughly enjoyed each sip. 

Every person there was so friendly! The guy who made our guacamole took pride in his work and had us taste it and make sure it was perfectly to our liking. Our server was friendly without being intrusive and chatted with us about our engagement. He apologized to us for the noisiness of a neighboring party. I was so impressed with the staff. I will absolutely go there again!",luDAuiJXhNRzPtTUxqMImg,3,0,5,aOdvxQWmpx3zZTrlYvTd5g
4624985,2016-10-09,0,0ydy2fdDg6kpGy1dbnHYsQ,"Food was okay but it was just tacos.  You can't mess that up too bad. But, service was not good at all.  I ordered from the combo platos. Not plate mind you. You had your choice of two or three items. I said two tacos and held up the obligatory two fingers. She questioned my order. I again said two.  Then she then says ""dos tacos?"". Baffled I agreed, I wanted ""dos"" tacos. My husband ordered three tacos.  She didn't understand him at first because he said ""three"" and not ""tres"". Keep in mind, this entire conversation is in English by a very American bred waitress. And the sign outside says ""American-Mexican cuisine"".  Then I ordered a water that was filled zero times after I drank down the initial offering. Once we were done with our food we sat about 10 minutes before she came to ask if she could get us anything. The wait wasn't because she was busy, we were one of three customers in the dining area with three (tres) other wait staff working. So all we wanted was the check at that point.  As we walked out to leave we did see all the wait staff sitting on the patio chatting.",z1EBFPmzpyQ4LLvKcEG4iw,0,0,1,Vns_PTBiuOjUwC76WcdgIA

Left some employees without paychecks. Check with the labor board 

I don't know why my first review was placed in the ""not recommended"" section because it was a very honest review. I have lived in Las Vegas for 14 yrs.  I loved this place when it first opened. We ate there 1-3 times per week until the great chef left. Then we took a break and then went back when we thought they might have gotten their act together. They never did recover.  My reviews will ALWAYS be true to my own personal experience and opinion. 

If you are a Yelp employee, I just watched the PBS special and I am not being paid for reviews. This place DID deserve a 5 star.  Two months before closing, they didn't even deserve 1 star the food sucked that bad.",LJks-DkJdPH-lA0oTtyRuQ,3,0,1,IEQPCdPlYnUOq0fVgnjPsg
4788780,2014-09-08,0,0ydy2fdDg6kpGy1dbnHYsQ,"This place is definitely not your typical authentic Mexican food place. However keep in mind that they are only open on Sunday's for brunch and I assume open on the other days for lunch and dinner. This place is super far from the strip and super close by the airport. The environment looked like industrial inside so that was cool but I didn't feel the Mexican vibe. I used a groupon and my deal didn't mention anything about not using it on Sunday so I couldn't use it on dinner so the manager or owner was generous enough to give us a deal anyway, hence the 3 stars. The reason why I rate this place low is bcuz I found a hair in my sausage breakfast sandwich, which by the way their breakfast is over priced. Its something anyone could make at home especially since they give you this small sandwich bread. The waiter was extremely nice to us as well. She also makes up for the 3 stars.",s-6wUDwD_wygGd0ksGQAmg,4,0,3,3eKSbEC1hkMbw61sJlScjQ

5423601,2016-09-20,1,0ydy2fdDg6kpGy1dbnHYsQ,The menu is misleading and I'm not too confident that management understands why. The parts of the menu that say entree sides are included doesn't actually apply to all items under it nor does it indicate which don't include entree sides of your choice. I inquired about this when I was charged for sides that I thought were included and was given a long explanation about why a refund would be too inconvenient. Luckily the chips that replaced my refund were tasty. Still I won't be returning. Too much hassle.,wNwiIBJfv2l9tpfyR1wzkQ,0,0,2,KFzYmkk8Fh1DhwFLkRcLMg

Prices are far too high for what you get (up to 50% higher than traditional Mexican restaurants), food had NO taste and lacked seasoning ... It's sad when you have to add the free salsa, that comes with the chips, to the food to add flavor.  It was a complete waste of $40+.",0yKLjjti5gHD2ZHSmxrEIQ,0,0,2,icS3RAnInpDyw-LaWM6F3g

The waitress told us they buy all organic ingredients and everything is made to order. They have different food prep area for gluten free and vegetarian as well. I got chicken fajitas and hubby got Mexican pasta. We went home very happy and with leftovers.
