205079,2017-01-29,0,dZq0qLyk67fZkBiedjjMMw,"Ordered carne asada nachos with NO beans. When I got home, there were beans throughout the whole plate. This is a big problem because it made the dish inedible for me. They don't use shredded cheddar but a cheese sauce which can make the chips very soggy, especially when you're ordering to go and have to wait until you get home to eat. Worse still, the cheese sauce had absolutely NO flavor. The chips are the thick kind and not very tasty (my favorite chips are from Chili's - thin, crispy, and salty). The meat was pretty good. It was in thin pieces and not real fatty which is a big turn-off to me. There was no sour cream or guacamole which is pretty standard for nachos. Very unsatisfying. This is a fairly new restaurant and maybe they need to work out the kinks. However, it'll be a long time, if ever, that I try this place again.",wcNNu8b8czwHzaKvkswO5w,0,0,1,FF67x97YkthCV_457PDEYQ

Great tasting menudo. There is nothing better than ""home made"" food!!!",Lf38flB2sV1d0qyO6MDPog,0,0,5,i1fJWcEkOw004mnFacJ7DA
1977921,2018-03-13,0,dZq0qLyk67fZkBiedjjMMw,Giving a one star because honestly it was beyond weird for us. The sauce was strange...texture and taste. The chicken was definitely NOT fresh and didn't even look like chicken. It actually looked more like microwaveable pork chunks but can't even say it tasted like chicken OR pork which freaks me out even more! Even the rice fell short on texture and taste. The food was bland and just odd. We threw more than half the food away in the trash because the more we got into it the more we feared getting sick. Thankfully we did not get sick or have any bad reaction to the food. We won't chance it again though. Sorry to say but this meal was a fail. Very disappointing after reading other reviews.,oydv_ap7Bh-RZq9leO1wPQ,0,1,1,vZtsNgZgnmx-ZbIAcI2tJg
2285816,2017-10-28,1,dZq0qLyk67fZkBiedjjMMw,"I got the birria combination plate and was very pleased with the flavor and the salsa that was brought over to my table. The salsa was nice and spicy. I just wish there was a little bit of cheese on the beans but it was still delicious. The establishment replaced the old Chicago Dogs and they've done a great job making it a new place to enjoy some good, authentic Mexican food. I'll be coming back.",35SDIznfSy6wW6V071NlUg,1,1,4,oJevgBWqQ1s_hkEKAwG-gw

Beans and rice were average but I did really like the salsa and horchetta!! I always believe in second chances but this is strike one for sure.",YHGCV5G1-5xkx0iIUI2amQ,0,0,2,HlXZi-1VL8tnfetk0emADA
2685247,2017-03-20,0,dZq0qLyk67fZkBiedjjMMw,Went here to duck traffic ended up being better than I thought. I got a carne asada & al pastor tacos 2.25/each. Meat was seasoned perfectly didn't even need extras on it. They serve it with homemade salsa. Waaay better than tacos el Gordo tacos & bigger! It's a small business so they took like 15 minutes to serve me. Will be coming back.,NAFa3AqdreZ1B4zA-UdnmA,1,0,4,iTxJRchQMl1xElbehIK-EA

2906137,2018-06-21,0,dZq0qLyk67fZkBiedjjMMw,I ordered the birria combination and the birria in soup also ordered a alpastor combination by far the best birria I have tried in a while both the combination and the soup style were amazing and with handmade tortillas YESS! will be going back for it. On the other hand the alpastor combination hmm some work to be done. I didn't like it because It had no flavor and the meat was kind of hard. But I for sure come back for the birria. Then I'll go next door for a vanilla raspado. Dinner and dessert all in one place.,SWLa0UDZUlqGYKgf86Gc6w,0,0,5,4zzZistaO6Yz6kbIO3QsuA

4501229,2017-02-09,0,dZq0qLyk67fZkBiedjjMMw,"I got the carne asada burrito $6.99. The meat, with beans, rice, and onions had good taste. They don't have a salsa bar and the salsa they serve with your order is pretty bland.  My friend got a plate breakfast and they  served fresh homemade tortillas,  which looked real good. Hopefully they offer a lunch combo or a daily special, because the prices are a little high for me.  I would go back to try their breakfast plates, since those look pretty good.",YtzISeM9MrYanLR1oBiITg,1,0,3,TNCxBVofPt495g4jq5nyzg
