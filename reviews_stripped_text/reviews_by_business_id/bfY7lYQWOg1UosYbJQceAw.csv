The cashier didn't even check his receipt and checked mine which is when the order screws up. Clearly I was given a number and was staring at it almost all the time. The cashier was wrong but instead of making amends, just frowns and push that wrong order to me. Didn't even look me in the eye when I ask if it is a big carl. That really pisses me off. I had to google to confirm that I got the wrong burger and oh yeah, I was right. Don't wanna make a scene, so I just swallow my pride as I swallow the burger. The only reason why this is not one star is because the burger tastes decent. Just come here for the food, don't expect anything from customer service and fingers crossed for a smooth order.",Z9APxrp4WOc3TkAHEOFLwg,0,0,2,XSDPj9fnELgvHGJErz4R9A

I was so confused until I noticed they gave me a more expensive burger. We ate them anyway because we were starving. 
The chili cheese had absolutely no cheese. And they burger was meh and mostly lettuce. No refils. 
SO expensive. Stupid airport making everything so expensive.",HLxTwrrNrEfLNNsw2liSuA,1,0,1,vAcWgh1s_X_ZselH0qwKhg

For the Chicken charbroiled club burger, the meat was good but the burger had too many sauces, so over saturated. Right now, I'm still recounting the good taste of the breakfast burger. I crushed these two burgers in minutes!",08eIe8ZbLEtZcAw8MSgnfg,1,1,4,KNHqGGOjY1ZPIjDsEi4eIA

There aren't any Carls restaurants in the eastern part of the US, so this was going to be my one chance. I had a Famous Star burger with cheese and small crisscut fries. The burger was nothing special, but the fries were pretty good.",Zgdl_zDXb6eBtl2wXPNSuw,0,0,3,rakcpQSOQzC2DVUvIRgGqg

No specialties added to it or anything. When someone 6 people behind you orders something you know has to be made because they don't have any ready and they get their food first, you know they skipped your number. Sure enough, I walked over to see if my number was still on the screen and it wasn't. This location was very unorganized. One person should not have to do everything herself.",D4Gel-Fz6eyzdhLWM4TaVg,0,0,1,nUw1p-ybVceCZXMnELTmug

Sie bietet nicht das volle Angebot anderer Filialen - dafür höhere Preise.

2932040,2017-12-21,0,bfY7lYQWOg1UosYbJQceAw,"Horrible!

Ordered a sausage & egg biscuit without cheese since i have a cheese allergy. Ordered a second plain biscuit for jelly after inquiring if they had jelly.  

3 people behind me got their orders.  Mine finally arrived and i sat down.  

No jelly.

Returned to counter and had to force them to provide jelly.

Sat down again and opened up the sausage egg biscuit.  Covered in nasty, greasy cheese.  

Anothet trip to get them to replace it.  

Very sloppy operation.",lRp10IaBc6g0SmA2h2Wx0g,1,0,1,dNDlmlk792gTLZFyPNl6EQ
3125133,2015-06-24,4,bfY7lYQWOg1UosYbJQceAw,"Oh my god............... I think I had a heart attack and a obesity health threat within a bite. My first Carl's Jr and I think definitely my last. I can't bring myself to like food like this, because it's definitely NOT food. Processed everything, greasy buns, no fresh veggies? Something is definitely wrong! I got my boyfriend to go order some food while waiting for our flight and I wanted anything that wouldn't give me health concerns. I ended up getting the diablo, which was ok but too heavy on the obesity. The good thing about it is that the cheese is thick and fresh and the jalapeño spice is a nice change from other burgers. A combo is not too expensive- $11-13ish, but the burgers are the size of my face. I got the smallest burger and it's been over three hours and I'm still having trouble finishing. The beef patty is also hella big compared to other fast food burgers. 

The lines are on and off; they can be suuuuuper long, depending if everyone is having same flights at the same time. Anyway, it was indeed a.. interesting last meal before I head back to Canada! Thanks for showing me the true american way of food, Carl's jr! Hopefully I'll never risk getting heart burn this quick again though.",JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,5,5,2,cBgalMRmFs5j32kd7v_NUA
3758593,2014-06-07,2,bfY7lYQWOg1UosYbJQceAw,"I understand that being inside an airport, prices are inflated for the convenience, but you should at least get food with similar quality you'd get from the other locations.  The Famous Star burger I received from these guys was a joke!  It's like they just nuked the whole burger including the veggies. So what I unwrapped was this dry overcooked patty dripping with warm mayo and ketchup with soggy wet veggies.  C'mon, now!  For the record, I have been here before and ordered a Breakfast Burger and that one turned out okay.  Apparently they don't know how properly stack veggies in their burgers here, so if you do decide to come here, stick to ordering any sandwich that doesn't have veggies, and you''ll be okay.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,6,2,2,WAQWM6PryEJr0nZkam7uNw
3935722,2015-09-09,0,bfY7lYQWOg1UosYbJQceAw,"You are at the airport. You have not eaten in a while and will probably starve to death or have a peanut allergy reaction on the plane otherwise. You decide to eat here to avoid those problems.

After waiting in line for twenty minutes, you get to the counter and order one of twenty of so varieties of the same meat patty topped with something different. You settle on jalapeños or avocado or whatever. You wait ten more minutes for the food, for which they have blessedly provided a pager.

The burger is a total gut bomb covered in a glob of cheese. Even though it is more expensive here than the average location, it still comes out to less than a penny per calorie.

In fairness, the onion rings are decent and they do have refills on fountain drinks. Skip the burger.",8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,0,0,2,4g0EBDR4f3FiJiUagAwdYw

I ordered the American and my gf ordered El Diablo. These burgers were huge like HUGE and I ordered the 1/3 size when there was a 1/2 size. Mine had the beef patty, sausage cut in two, hard chips, lettuce, bacon, tomatoes,  cheese and jalapeño mayo oh my god. It was definitely something else. The taste however was a so so. Nothing that great about it just lot of ingredients put together. However for airport food it's not bad. My gf could feel the arteries clogging as she ate hers ahaha. Not a bad place though for being in an airport. 

Can take awhile depending what you get. They give you buzzers, which I think is good considering it's a fast food place in an airport. Also let you know that they didn't forget your order.",AuSPHqadM9RCrZnk1i-3mg,0,0,3,VNiZnYrxpXoxI5d1gK31hQ
4563401,2017-10-14,0,bfY7lYQWOg1UosYbJQceAw,Worst meal I experienced during my stay in Las Vegas by far! Also one if the worst meals I've had out altogether in a very long time. I would give it zero stars if it were an option. It took 45 mins and the staff were fighting because they clearly did not have there sh*t together. All the tables were filthy and our food was disgusting. Oh ya and we almost missed our flight because of it. Thanks for leaving a bad taste in our months.

I had been on the lookout so I could try the new baby back rib burger.  I was happy to find one in the airport!  It is full service, so you don't have to worry about anything missing.  You can get your specialty burger and your fried zucchini.

There was a longer line, but the orders were handled pretty quickly.  Everything else was pretty much as you'd expect.  If you need to leave to go to the remote terminal though, be advised that you can't come back unless you go all the way back around through security.",rkZYr1Rf6aASwDYNjrXIiA,2,1,5,NLk-DXmKXJfP_N_n0B1Z9w
