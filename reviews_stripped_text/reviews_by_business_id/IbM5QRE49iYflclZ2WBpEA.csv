However, the food was a bit expensive compared to California.",nRLSV6ZD6sVMCFeZtuPXOQ,0,0,4,78nSSxQaYHvcI7A1EHnIqA

2431267,2016-08-14,0,IbM5QRE49iYflclZ2WBpEA,I order a spicy chicken sandwich which wasn't cook well at all. The chicken was old and had been dozen for to long that lost all the flavor. It was so bad I couldn't even eat it. When I went to complain all what they say was it look that way because of the seasoning in the chicken. Which wasn't even had flavor of spicy or any flavor. Your better off having something else.,t5QDgB1cglgiXwS3JdVS-w,0,0,1,_0S9oFZLwa6UCiIG-P2pjA

4168195,2011-08-25,2,IbM5QRE49iYflclZ2WBpEA,"Burger was good. 
Fries were good.
Soda was good.
FROSTY was AMAZING.

for a cheeseburger combo it is $5.95. To upgrade to large it's a dollar. 
Frosty's are $3 for a small. 
They don't charge you extra for BBQ sauce. 
This place saved my stomach (strangely enough) I was hungover and the burger and fries literally kept me from dry heaving. Thank you wendy's.",Jb2F3GuqF8Doa0TK7yXnGw,1,1,5,edTuuTVTops5RAX0iSDc8w

I thought that I would get a Dave's Double at this location since I missed eating their juicy burgers. I asked for it fresh since, ya know.. Vegas strip is busy as heck and they probably have a lot of old food that is on standby for a rush. The burger that I received and consumed was very comparable to trash. The patty was dry as hell and very disappointing. 

Only thing that could save this location is how friendly their staff.",OtHLldo1oGIGD5sqFMxb8Q,0,0,2,ZxnERK38b4kWsaj483t8kg
