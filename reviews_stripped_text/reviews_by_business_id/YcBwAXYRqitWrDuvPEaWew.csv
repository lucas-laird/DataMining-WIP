590649,2015-01-04,0,YcBwAXYRqitWrDuvPEaWew,I'm sorry for being so blunt but this place is subpar. There's nothing especial about this food and it lacks taste and everything else.

This place opened 20+ years ago, I have been going since I was a little girl. Sometimes traveling all the way across town.

2493075,2017-03-22,0,YcBwAXYRqitWrDuvPEaWew,"Stopped by for lunch, my first time at this restaurant. I love my ma and pa shops they are the best. For eighteen bucks and change I got two combos of orange chicken and Kong Pao Chicken with red peppers plus chow mein and 4 egg rolls.  

Delicious smell the whole drive home. Both orange and kong pao was salty salty no spice what so ever. It didn't stop me I kept eating right away it I felt how heavy it was. It gave me a food coma. My brother had his share once he got home. He ate every last bite. 

I don't want to give a bad review and feel I should give this restaurant a second chance.",8tcDXg5HwAVW9ctnCIr3ew,1,0,4,HCh20ANLyOfEFNxB6LPpkw
2594046,2012-09-19,0,YcBwAXYRqitWrDuvPEaWew,"Peking Express has been a place near my work that I'e known about for years but never patronized.  Today was the day that changed.  This small Chinese restaurant is located in a lower income neighborhood in a strip mall that doesn't have a lot of traffic.  

The inside decor featured several articles and awards that aren't from sources that I am familiar with, and otherwise had a somewhat cafeteria feel to it.  Although the lunch specials were in the $5-6 range, I had the Country Pork ($7.50 with rice), and the Crab Rangoon ($4.99).  The Country Pork had it's own little picture taken on the counter so I thought that maybe the chef was proud of this particular dish. 

The Country Pork wasn't bad. It was a stir fried dish with onions and bell peppers.  The pork was a tad tough and gristly, but not offensively so.  The herbs used were the same that you get in some authentic Mexican restaurants, along with some spicy Chinese flavor.  It was fairly unique and really not bad at all!  The portion was huge and could easily be shared with two people.  

The Crab Rangoon wasn't bad.  They came with a generic store bought sweet and sour sauce.  Nothing to write home about.

Overall this place isn't bad for the neighborhood if you are looking for Chinese.  However, I probably won't be ditching the little Thai restaurant across the street for this place. ;)",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,2,2,3,tDL3sOAynx7Iq6QQ2IPqOg

Everything pretty much average Chinese. If you want cheap good Chinese, this is your spot. Staff was friendly. For two people we spent $16.

3368373,2015-08-11,0,YcBwAXYRqitWrDuvPEaWew,"Since I was in the area I decided to give this place a try. I was not impressed. Let's start with the sign on the door, regular white sheet of paper that someone used a Sharpie to write with announcing they're looking for a ""Balingual Cashier."" When I asked the girl behind the counter if she knew the sign was misspelled, she recognized that it was but said something along the lines of not wanting to take it down. Oh, okay. 

I looked over the menu board and picked out an order of Crab Rangoon and Spicy Almond Chicken. After paying $14.58 I proceeded to wait. That's when I noticed all the chairs were already on top of the tables. According to the sign on the door the place closes at 9 p.m. and it was 7:30. Why make it seem that they're closing shop so early and not give patrons a seat or even a seat for them to wait for their food?? I got a chair off the table and waited for my food. The place is pretty grimy. 

Anyhow, got my food and came to the office to eat. Rangoon were cold and not good. I looked inside the little pockets to see if there was anything other than cream cheese and I just saw a speck here and there of something green and red which I maybe could assume was chive and imitation crab, but it sure didn't taste like it. 

Now the Spicy Almond Chicken was very bland and no flavor to it. Definitely no spice was used, and I had to dump a packet of soy sauce to even make it taste like something.

I will not be back.",Uq-dsHwWt2IB72_eGTMhEQ,1,0,2,5MNTkHaLGbUcOju_l3LpAQ

4276869,2015-07-14,0,YcBwAXYRqitWrDuvPEaWew,"Please don't eat here. This place is always EMPTY. The one time my fiance and I decide to finally try it I left feeling like I needed to throw up and all we had was their ""Boba"". We didn't even get through half our drinks before we threw them away and walked out to go to Asian Garden (which is a 5 minute drive away on Stewart & Nellis) to have REAL Boba. It takes a lot for me to write a bad review for anything but I just couldn't let this go. Their strawberry watermelon slush tasted like old play-doh with WAY too much sugar and their milk thai tea tasted cheap and watered down. When the girl gave us our drinks the boba on the bottom of the cups were so hot you couldn't touch the cup on the bottom half and we spent like 5 minutes just trying to cool the entire drink down so it was drinkable. I've never had anything like that happen before, when you order a cold drink it should be cold when you get it! If we wouldn't have touched that area on the cups ahead of time we would have burned our mouths with the first sip. SERIOUSLY?!?!? This place is a joke. If you want real, quality Chinese food and Boba take the extra 5 minutes and go to Asian Garden right down the street and you will not be disappointed. We've been there more times then we can keep track of and have never had one problem (They often give us free appetizers when we order because we usually get so much food!)",SUxMV1DpLvEIVQY5ecnD_Q,1,0,1,oa4HUjjkkCWoooDKZU1mlQ
4371846,2018-04-26,0,YcBwAXYRqitWrDuvPEaWew,"I have a 20+ yr history with this restaurant. I use to live in the area years ago and my mom and I came here often because the food was good, large portions and cheap. 
Today was the first time I've been back in over 10yrs and still a good spot! Their prices are a bit more expensive but the portions are still large and food still yummy. 
They also have a food hot line set up like panda express where you can pick and choose what you want in combo deals, which is nice and way more affordable than ordering off the regular menu but I wanted what I always ordered back in the day (which wasn't on the hot line) 
The service was ok the guy was training a new girl and he seems a bit overwhelmed trying to train her when I walked in and a party of 3 guys walked in behind me. The seemed to be handling her business but the guy kept trying to take over. Lol 

Combination fried rice $9.95 (no bean sprouts, no beef and extra portion of bbq pork) 4/5 stars. 
The old school taste is still there but only 4 stars because they got way stingy with the shrimp only 3 in that entire thing but lots of pork and chicken. 

Sesame chicken $9.95 4/5 stars
