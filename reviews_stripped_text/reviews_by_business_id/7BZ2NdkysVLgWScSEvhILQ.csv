38589,2016-02-22,0,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"So my friend and I ventured downtown for a new food experience. It took me a little time to find it but let's hope more comes to that area of downtown. CHOW is located across from the record store  

Atmosphere was great I loved the feel of the place and the music was awesome 

We ordered:

Veggie egg rolls these didn't taste much like egg rolls to me but was just okay. I wouldn't order again. But be ware the hit mustard served with this is sinus clearing 

Southern friend chicken and I must say this was my favorite of the dishes that we ordered. It had a nice crisp batter but could have had a little more flavor but hot sauce cured that. 

Sriracha mac and cheese this was definitely different and I like the concept but it I felt like it was cheese sauce with sriracha. It didn't give me Southern or Asian 

Southern collard greens were a little to vinegary for my taste. I felt that they needed a smoked meat to give it more levels of flavor (being southern all collards are cooked with meat) 

Over all this place was okay not bad but not great. The atmosphere was perfect. I LOVE Eat and was hoping for the same foodie experience here.",WRUBmTtsF0d4DVA9UMcHLw,1,1,3,YFw__P7_qMGO-HiOl8fR4g
44177,2015-10-28,1,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,Not great - not horrible - but not great.  Still struggle with some the hospitality issues that continue from EAT - and feel no real need to go back.,az2qTDBK2hFPunbkMXGaDw,3,0,2,JxV9wIc3YIkeAbPxJR8sRw
83341,2015-11-26,0,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"Where to start? Mind you, I grew up in a Chinese restaurant here in Vegas. My Father was one of the pioneers of Vegas Chinese food. 

Let's start with the vibe. Walking in, I felt as though the restaurant was in the soft opening stages. Staff was a bit preoccupied with other issues than their customers (didn't help that Chef Natalie was there.).  Very cold and uninviting. In fact, it didn't appear she was all that happy. She made no effort in greeting her customers or anything. There were only 4 occupied tables. Not exactly what a small business proprietor should do.

Next let's talk about the menu and what we ordered.
Crab ragoon dip.
Pork fried rice 
General Chow Chicken
Hot sweet tea.
My friend ordered the hot tea. It was served in a stainless steel tea cup. The cup was blistering hot to the point you couldn't hold on to it long enough to sip the tea.

Crab ragoon dip. News bulletin: that ain't Chinese. That ain't Southern. Befuddles me as to how Americans believe that the crab ragoon came from China. It didn't. Some Non Chinese entrepreneur in, I'm sure, Midwest America thought it'd be a great idea to wrap a block of cream cheese in a won ton skin and call it Chinese. Traditional Chinese cuisine does not use milk, let alone cheese, in the food. Just yuck.

Pork Fried Rice. Wow. $13 for approximately 12-14 ounce serving of pork fried rice. Are you kidding me?!  There was more vegetables than rice. Who puts chopped bok choy in fried rice?  In the picture attached, you can see there was more oil than the Exxon Valdez. At the bottom of the bowl was a pool of cooking grease.  Yuck. Also, back in the day, my dad would charge only $5. for a 32oz box of PkFrRice. Hipster pricing I guess.

 General Chow Chicken. The sweet chili sauce, literally just poured over the top fried chicken chunks, was way too spicy and overpowering. The Gai Lan(Chinese Broccoli) was undercooked and hard as a rock.  

Bottom line, I don't see this place lasting more than a few months more.",FEOvD7rB4lNTgkOXzxvHSg,3,0,1,NpE7t5ISJr_akvAAwvj-EA

However, egg rolls were not so much.  Tasted like they had some kind of floury filler.  We had the 3 pc. fried chicken, which was great, mini corn muffins not quite corny enough for me and a little dry, but the General Chow's chicken, also very good.  Rice pudding for dessert was a disappointment - crunchy and dry, didn't eat more than one bite.  Loved the music - modern, but not so loud as to overwhelm conversation.  I would go back to try some other things, because I absolutely love EAT, the sister restaurant of CHOW, so want to give Chow another chance to wow me.",-8bfKCvDClxD3iKX9o7J5w,0,0,3,OT11D2vvZE-KoUTNPQARzg

Another Portlandia type restaurant in Vegas. It's crazy! Can hipster really take over the over-the-top Las Vegas? Maybe.

I ordered the Loco Moco with fried rice. I ate during the lunch hour. Luckily, I had leftovers to enjoy later. I don't want to over-review this place because I think they're still growing in to their niche and figuring things out. I'd like to go back in three months. I enjoyed my food greatly.

776649,2015-12-26,0,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"I was really excited about coming here. I love Asian food and my partner does not, so I was thrilled that he could order the ""southern"" stuff and I could get the Chinese. 

We started with the egg rolls, and I was having a tough time deciding what to order for my main. The egg rolls were not good. So I decided to move away from the Chinese side of the menu. I specifically asked what the fried chicken pieces were, because I do not like drumsticks. The waitress said it was a mix of thighs and drumsticks. Perfect. We got the 8 piece to share and each got the Sriracha Mac and cheese. It took FOREVER to come out. And then the Mac and cheese came, and it was cold. Not even warm - just cold. Since five minutes later we still didn't have chicken, I asked for warmer Mac and cheese. That came with the chicken, which was all drumsticks (after I had specifically asked and received confirmation that it was thighs). I asked if we could please get some of the thighs and was told that it was chef's choice on the pieces. Okay... So why didn't you say that before? The person running food then offered to only charge us for a four piece and get me something else, but we had somewhere to be and I couldn't wait. We said we would take the four piece charge and dessert (which we confirmed was premade) and be on our way. 

The check came and they charged us for the 8 piece. So we asked what happened there, and they said they would fix it. The check came back with a four piece price that had $2 more tacked on. Had the service been good (she was sweet but not good) or the chicken been better or our water refilled just once without having to ask, I probably wouldn't have minded. But those things were not the case. So I mind. And I won't be back.",egcZm5Ir6Qr-95STDg3Rxg,1,0,1,PjYNVZ1mqRR9r0-8JUHMig
855955,2016-12-20,0,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"The wifey was in the mood for fried chicken, so we decided to check this spot out for the unusual pairing of southern and Chinese food.

First thing I noticed upon entering was the neat, warm decor with a giant red dragon traversing the ceiling. The second thing I noticed was how empty it was for a Saturday night...a shame.

We were immediately greeted and were sat near the open kitchen. We ordered the pork belly bao, shrimp dumplings, and half a fried chicken.

The pork belly bun nicely blended heat and sweet, but the pork itself was smaller and drier than I prefer my pork belly. I gravitate toward larger cuts and more unctuous preparations, but the flavor was great. The shrimp dumplings came served in a pool of soy and vinegar. The dumplings were tender and the sauce it was swimming in was nicely balanced.

Now to the chicken. It came out piping hot with a cornbread muffin, sweet pickles, a pickled jalapeño, and a couple pieces of bread as a base. The chicken itself was the star for me. The perfectly crisp seasoned coating cracked and gave way to some of the most moist, tender, and flavorful chicken I've had. Dark meat is reliably moist and flavorful, but the breast pieces were just as juicy...high marks.

This hidden gem will become a regular stop anytime we are in Las Vegas. The quality of food coming out of that kitchen makes it a great value. Keep up the good work, this place deserves more attention.",OfB1o8-uJmYZeDhyXIld5g,1,0,4,f7GzdkAaO7VRBwgHLEd04g
921270,2016-06-03,0,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"This is one of the cutest places I have been to, with very fast and friendly staff!  The prices are also reasonable.  But, the food is another story... We ordered the mini sweet corn muffins, they were OK but what made them suck is the powder they sprinkled on top - I believe it was corn soup seasoning powder.  The crab dip and the fried rice were very good - the only 2 things that were good, which is sad considering we ordered quite a few items.  Next came the dark meat chicken, which was very hard on the outside and had hardly any seasoning inside - it tasted like bare chicken with nothing on it.  Last was the desert called ""Dirt"".  It is layers of vanilla pudding, chocolate syrup, and topped with Oreo crushings.  The waitress, who was very nice, made this desert sound like it was worth dying for.  We were obviously very excited... Until we took our first bite out of a half-full mason jar... I kid you not, it tasted like wax, which was funny because it looked like a candle.  So we apologized to the waitress and she took it back.  Overall, it was a pretty bad experience food-wise.  Again, adorable and great service, though!",k7ylTRB2oEV-YLYW5SH-Ow,0,0,2,5UfRlERxJD5qsQFQIEF1Hw
1207464,2016-05-01,0,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"Very tempted to give Chef Natalie five stars for this one. Just a couple of dings here and there. We ordered ribs, wontons and egg rolls as appetizers but didn't get the egg rolls. We weren't charged for them, either so maybe the waitress didn't hear us. No harm, no foul. 

I ordered the chicken salad and I could eat a whole plate of just those little crispy bits of chicken love. Seriously, they were that good. As for the salad itself, the greens were fresh and delicious. Overall, it could easily have used half the amount of dressing I received. There was still a pool of it in the bottom of the dish when I was done eating. Did I mention the chicken? I need more of that in my life. Oh, the dressing was also a little heavy handed with the sesame oil, too. A little goes a LONG way. 

The mac and cheese was okay. I thought it was a little dry but not terrible. 

Husband ordered the General Chow's chicken and also loved the chicken in it. The veggies were a little bland. Our friends ordered the fried chicken dishes and they loved them. 

When we go back (and we will) I'll simply order dressing on the side. And I want to try the corn muffins next time, too.",xDGHlxXxXg7GZI048lmo0Q,0,0,4,EUazGU_1_YeX9Da3m93ieg

Wonderful service - not rushed at all. I had the new addition to their menu - street cart noodles and my man ordered the classic General Chow in honor of the recently departed man who pioneered General Tsao. My meal was amazing (pictured below) the broth and thick noddles were flavorful and the meatballs, seared mushrooms and braised slithers of pork belly was a delightful contrast to the clean taste of the dish. Subtly garnished with green onions and bok choy. Deliciousness!! It was a decent size meal but I wanted another one so bad. His dish was also great - delicately battered chicken in their own zesty tangy version of G. Tsao sauce. It was moderately spicy to me but the best thing about it was the chicken was not overly coated and doused in sauce. Beautiful dish ...very cheeky and balanced.

Love the concept of chinese & southern comfort fusion!

The space is fun and very nice, no complaints there. Love all the rock n roll touches! The service was pleasant and quick as well.

We came here for lunch and I was surprised to see such high prices during the earlier period of the day. 4 small pork dumplings for $8? Had a hard piece in one of them and almost chipped my tooth. 

My pork belly slider wasn't great either and I tried my friends fried chicken sandwiches and fried chicken plate. Those items were better but still nothing memorable. The crab Rangoon dip was very rich, chunky and heavy. Lunch time should also offer some lunch specials which aren't over $10.

Staff: 5 Stars. Welcoming Staff, they were professional and sat us immediately.  The staff was exceptionally attentive and checked on us frequently. Very friendly whomever we had. It seemed they had kind of a waiter/busser by committee.

Decor: 4 Stars. Very clean, neat presentation everywhere. It's a fun atmosphere.

Food: 1 Star.  It just wasn't great, and i can't put my finger on it.  For example crab rangoon w/ wonton chips.  After every bite, i felt as if there was a film of oil.  The Fried Chicken, was kind of rubbery and didn't quite smell right. The Crispy Chicken Thigh was not crispy and felt, again oily.   The Bok Choy was unimaginative.  Corn muffins were dry.  It was almost as if everything was using a re-used or cheap oil and it kind of stuck to whatever we had.  I will note that the fried rice was very good, and i did enjoy their liberal use of fresh herbs.

I ordered the 2pc dark meat which came with a thigh and a drum stick. The chicken was perfect, with the salty, spicy and slightly-sweet breading crispy and flakey! I also ordered a side salad with Asian dressing and wonton crisps (was big for a side salad, prob could share that between two people) and some Sriracha Mac 'n Cheese. The food was superb!

The place is super cute and cozy, with fun Chinese decorations including a giant new year dragon hanging from the ceiling. I love the theme of southern/Louisiana with Chinese fusion. They were playing some fun New Orleans Jazz music which was pleasant. The waitress was very kind and polite, and the food came out quickly.

2010568,2015-10-30,8,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"It's kitschy. I dig it. Diner-style setup with Asian décor touches like a dragon on the ceiling and matching lions at either side of the door, a menu that boasts both Southern staples and Chinese dishes, and friendly service. Somehow, it works.

CRAB RANGOON DIP: A tasty deconstructed version of the dish. Not much crab in the dip itself, but the flavors worked and the fried eggroll skins as chips was fun.
KINDA CHINESE RIBLETS: Super tender, drowning in a hoisin barbecue sauce. Mixed feelings on this. BF and I didn't enjoy these as much as we were expecting to.
CRISPY SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN: Moist meat, crispy skin, dusted with what seemed to be ranch dressing powder? Odd but tasty, it added saltiness that the dish needed. Cornbread muffins were painfully dry, and I don't understand why the chicken is served on sliced white bread? I really appreciated that the batter on the chicken wasn't very thick. Ultimately this dish was just okay.
SRIRACHA MAC AND CHEESE: Elbow noodles, cheese, a hint of spicy sauce, and everything nicely offset by a green onion garnish. I liked this more than I expected to, having mostly ordered it because of the low $3 price tag. 

Service was fast and friendly. The southern portion of the menu (save for the cornbread) seems to be executed better than the Chinese. I'm sure the menu will change a bit as they settle in and see what works and what doesn't. Hopefully the trio of wings (unavailable during my lunchtime visit) will make the cut for my next visit.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,10,3,1C7-6GJVe9th1-RLyW24Bw

We ordered a couple appetizers the Shrimp Dumplings (cooked perfectly) and the Shishito Peppers that had a great consistency melted in your mouth. I fought the urge of Fried Chicken and settled on the Loco Moco dreaming of hawaii and was blown away. It had paradise in every bite as you could feel the waves of the island mixed with what I consider southern sass. I also tried the General Tsos chicken which brought a different but mouth watering take to this standard dish.

The chef, who is often spotted in the vicinage, is always humble and approachable and really typifies creativity, community, and the comforts of home in her digs; Chow is her second win with characteristic representation.

The food is glorious! Hearty options with fried chicken abound and fairs with vegan and vegetarian options are not only available- they are slammin! For appetizers I strongly the pork buns and egg rolls- a fine example of orient-meets-south fusion of flavors. For the main course the STREET NOODLES are AMAZING!

I also had their 2 piece fried chicken, w/ a side of ""siracha mac n cheese and greens"". Chicken was super crispy and delicious.
Mac was really good and the greens were a little bitter but still very delicious.

I loved the ""Kinda Chinese riblets"" -- four small, tender, fall-off-the-bone ribs covered in a sweet, tangy sauce. If you order the crispy southern fried chicken (which I did) they'll tell you it takes at least 15 minutes, but it's worth it. Straight out of the fryer, it was crazy hot. After letting it cool down I was left with some tasty chicken, although under seasoned. It could have benefited from both salt and pepper. The breading was light and crunchy. Not a bad version at all.

The space is beautiful and well decorated with a Chinese motif. The wooden planks lining the walls and the dragon hanging from the ceiling, in particular, were nice touches. This isn't a fusion restaurant. There are Chinese dishes and southern dishes with little crossover.

5 star factor.... besides the incredible menu. The ambience. Who ever decorated this spot gets an A+.

I came out here pretty much because I was in the mood for some good fried chicken and Chow's fried chicken looked amazing from their yelp pics.  I also found their menu pretty interesting since it was a mix of soul food and Asian favorites.

Because of the unique menu selections, I went with their fried chicken and then ordered their shrimp dumplings and Chinese Broccoli to mix things up.

2 piece Dark Fried Chicken -- http://bit.ly/2vLKqxp
w/ mini sweet corn muffins, house made sweet and spicy pickles
As expected this was some really tasty chicken!  I liked the crispy skin and and the chicken was juicy and had a lot of flavor.  The corn muffins that came with it were great as well.

Shrimp Dumplings -- http://bit.ly/2vLe9Xr
pork belly bits, garlic soy
The Shrimp Dumplings were pretty tasty.  A little bit on the salty side from the sauce, but you can definitely taste the pork belly bits in the dumplings.

Side of Chinese Broccoli -- http://bit.ly/2vLVWc0

4108296,2015-10-30,10,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"Although I still haven't chowed down at Eat, I decided to eat at Chow.

I accepted an invitation from a friend to try a new downtown Las Vegas restaurant by chef Natalie Young, the culinary mind behind one of the hotter restaurants in DTLV. This welcoming space, located on Fremont St a few blocks from Container Park, is a foray into combining Southern and Chinese food. The adjoining lot seemed full or possibly off-limits, but I found some free-after-6 street parking around the corner on 10th Street (a plus for choosing dinner rather than lunch).

The meal unexpectedly began with wings three ways ($12.00 normally) due to a kitchen error. They had prepared a dish without a destination, so they offered it for free to the new table, us. We accepted it, and I was grateful since I'd actually wanted to order it. The wings were large and looked impressive. The first bite, a chili garlic wing, was actually unimpressive. The meat was either underseasoned or freezer burnt. It could well be the former because the flavor of the meat wasn't that impressive in the Asian-style bbq wings (served with fried onions) or the southern fried wings, but the glaze and crust respectively were yummy. Like the restaurant did for the price, I'm just gonna write this whole dish off for rating purposes.

Our actual orders came out at roughly the same time. The shishito peppers ($5.00) were quite good. The sear was good and the charred lime gave it a balanced extra dimension when squeezed carefully. The kinda Chinese riblets ($10.00) were fine on their own. They were tender enough but not falling off the bone. The hoisin bbq sauce was good, but the pork itself wasn't bursting with flavor or juice. Fortunately, the charred lime was available again and really elevated the dish. They really should just add the lime to the standard glaze and be done with it. Because of the lime, it's a must-try-if-you-come-here dish.

We also revisited the crispy southern fried chicken ($10.00 for 3 pc). This time, the chicken came in the form of large drumsticks. The seasoned crust was as good as it was on the wings, and the meat seemed a little juicier and more flavorful to me. The sweet pickled jalapeños were a welcome burst of flavors and must be eaten even if you're heat-averse. However, the corn muffins were disappointing. They barely had a corn flavor, the crunchy top didn't have a substantial feel, and the interior wasn't as fluffy as I would've liked. Also, what's up with the toasted white bread under the drumsticks? Do something to it. Like they say on Chopped, transform it. Maybe even a thin layer of butter would've made it interesting. I ended up soaking up riblet sauce with it later on, so it did work out, but it has no place in this dish.

Finally, I did try a small amount of the barley vegetable stir fry ($12.00) because a vegetarian tablemate offered to share it. I suppose it's pretty good as far as vegetable stir fry dishes go, but it seemed pricey for being a dish free from protein. I wouldn't necessarily go for it again either in veggie mode or with a +$5 add-on of chicken, shrimp, or pork.

Chow's menu concepts are somewhat boring and limited in scope, but I would have given the dishes four stars if they'd been executed better. As it is, I can't say ""Yay! I'm a fan."" Plus, other little things like the inability to split checks (split payment is OK though) and the lack of hefty chopsticks (disposable bamboo/wooden just reads cheap to me) could also be improved.

For now, I'm content with planning to eat at Eat and saying ciao to Chow.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,15,11,3,g81uogedGonCz8kRxUBseg

I had dined at ""Eat"" which is a breakfast joint owned and operated by the same owner as ""Chow"". I'll admit I was a bit pensive at first dining here. Only because I've been to a restaurant before that had a dual cuisine and it was a disaster. My experience here was the complete opposite. 

Started off with the ""Kinda spicy Chinese riblets"" and the shrimp dumplings with pork belly. Then a 4 piece chicken (4 piece bird). 

Getting down into the food and taste. The ribs were tender and savory. The sauce wasn't generic or gimmicky. It tasted as if it was made and almost sensed a reduction quality to it. I encountered only one small piece of gristle that was smaller than a tic tac. The meat quality was excellent. 

The salad. I didn't have it, but my boyfriend did and he loved it. Big portion too. I had a couple bites and enjoyed how fresh the vegetables in it were. I could tell from the taste it was tossed with dressing and not poured on top. 

Then. I had the siracha mac n cheese. Wow. Spicy and cheesy. It tasted freshly made. It was served in a small bowl with a pot topper for aesthetic. 

Then we move onto the half chicken, four piece bird. Wow. So much flavor and juicy flavor. Words can't describe it. 

The ambience of the restaurant is very calm. We came here around 5pm and it was empty and I loved it. I was able to eat ribs in public ha. I also loved the fact of how many napkins are stacked on the table. They know their food and audience. The funny part is our waitress was the same we had our first time at ""Eat""!

Looking more vigorous than ever since losing nearly eighty pounds following gastric sleeve surgery, though still recognized by many to be one of Downtown's first true pioneers, Natalie Young has achieved a lot in her career launched at eat, so much perhaps that it was with too high of expectations that I sat down with two 'industry' friends at chow, the recently launched ""Fried Chicken and Chinese"" joint.

Truly a Chef cooking from her heart, the legions of fans still waiting out-front of 707 East Carson each weekend a testament to the longevity of a menu that has never really needed to change, chow sees Young expanding Fremont East towards the sketchy borders approaching PublicUS and with The Bunkhouse soon to reopen plus another intriguing proposition across the street it would seem that she is again ahead of the curve, the repurposed space borrowing from Momofuku as well as Mission Chinese in its décor while still retaining a feel both homey and unique.

Channeling music from Led Zeppelin to Prince with some 80's power-ballads tossed into the mix, chow's menu speaks likewise of a cross-cultural mash-up of small plates alongside more sizable mains, the names as well as the concepts at times straight from take-out Chinese menus while other dishes riff on tradition in a tongue-in-cheek hipster sort of way.

Told at the door by a local 'critic' that the Pho was not to be missed, it was alongside three additional appetizers that our 6pm meal commenced and with servers thrice mistaking one diner's Sprite for water while another woman's sole duty seemed to be walking around stating - not inquiring - how good everything was suffice it to say that the tofu cubes in broth was at the very best forgettable, entirely bland and lifeless on its own and all the moreso when compared to the savory shrimp dumplings and sticky-sweet riblets, the cream cheese dip cleverly presented though decidedly light in crab.

Pleasantly paced with good conversation filling the space in between bites as tunes were thankfully not played overly loud from above, it was next in three entrees and two 'highly recommended' sides that palates were entrusted, the Southern Fried Chicken well seasoned straight through to the flesh alongside cornbread so dry that it was virtually inedible while both the oiled up noodles and spicy offering from the General were pronounced 'perfect drunk food,' the sobriety questionable of anyone fancying limp macaroni that banks on Sriracha to make its sales pitch beneath a top that is cooked to a leathery tan.

Going old-school Southern with desserts, all three from the menu ordered with Banana Pudding doubled up, those reminiscing of childhood stuff straight from the box are likely to enjoy the thickness offered by 'Nilla wafers and roughly chopped fruit while the ""rice pudding"" ate like a more toothsome Jewish Kugel, the 'dirt' is a jar mostly just Hershey syrup and crushed up Oreos no better that what can be bought in cafeterias or at the grocery store.

** Only half-successful in execution, though admittedly early in ts run, chow will no doubt garner praise from locals if only for the city's infatuation with Fremont East and its charismatic chef while the food still has a long way to go - place chow in any other clinical context without the involvement of Downtown Project and you have the mediocrity of M&M Soulfood meets the lesser offerings of Spring Mountain Road.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,5,2,WKAG0T9IYUGFOpcSJmDfdQ

5315735,2016-08-19,0,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"After dining here, I had only one question, what for? Why is this restaurant in existence? As soon as you walk in, you can tell that it is a poor attempt at a Chinese restaurant. The Feng Shui is bad, very bad. Every menu item misses the mark, as almost authentic, but not quite. Why does Tony Hsieh and Chef Nat feel the need for this ""missing the mark"" cafe? I had the shishito peppers. Burnt, beyond being edible. No flavor, except char. I had the Chinese broccoli, overcooked and tasteless. This is not collard greens! Chinese food is quickly sauteed, allowing the natural flavors of the food to be the star. A little garlic and salt is all that's needed. The fried rice is too greasy! Some of the ingredients don't exactly go together well.  The employees are very nice, very attentive. Hire a Chinese chef and be done with it. The flavors and sauces are not right. Hire a Feng Shui expert for a consultant and find out what busy really means. PF Chang's is a Jewish Guy's attempt (Paul Fried) attempt at Chinese food. It is much more successful than Chef Nat's attempt. Fusion is fine when it works. Here it is only Con-fusion! And Confucious says ""Stay Away!, Save Your Money!"". Lots better Chinese restaurants in this Town.",Nx4R_BdL5nspyQOgG3VwUQ,0,0,1,vHQCZrQycPCRAoCAY_KCLw
5464117,2016-01-07,0,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,This was an unexpected restaurant highlight of our trip. Completely worth the trip out to downtown.

5519432,2016-07-30,0,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"This is definitely one of my favorite places downtown. A few of my go-to dishes are the shrimp dumplings, sweet corn mini muffins, sriracha mac n cheese, and of course..the crispy southern fried chicken. The shrimp dumplings are a must-get for appetizer. They're very soft and tender and the sauce is full of flavor. I like the mini muffins because they aren't too sweet, and the size is perfect as an appetizer. The sriracha mac n cheese is exactly what its name suggests, but better. It's a bit on the heavier side because of the cheese, but who would've thought sriracha can go so well with it, adding to it a spicy kick. Last but not least, their fried chicken is possibly some of the best chicken I've had in town. Super juicy with such good flavor. I would definitely just come in for their fried chicken. 
The interior is very clean and modern, and the service is great. There's also parking on the side of the building. Although a couple spots say only for 15-minutes parking, the staff in the restaurant has confirmed that any customers can park there, so that's a plus. 
Love this place!",Sl8weP49PZG2VeWqU2yf-g,4,2,5,YNgxS1kv07hVVagpW1kd1A

5689711,2015-10-12,0,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"Date night (for me and the wife)  and birthday celebration for a friend started here. What a great start to a night out. We were sat immidiatly,  and the staff was on it. I don't think my wife ever got more than half way thru her water before it was filled up again.  That's a huge no no for her. She absolutely hates to constantly ask for water.  

We got a mix of a few things. A spicy fried chicken thing, I think it was called General Chows Chicken. .....I loved it.  We also got the Sriracha Mac and cheese. This was also really good. I was surprised I loved the Collared Greens. I'm generally not a fan, but my wife got them and I had some. I might even order them myself in the future. :)

My wife got a bitter melon, barley dish. Be forwarned....Chinese Bitter melon is an acquired taste. We pulled then melon pieces to the side and took them sparingly with the rest of the dish to work us into it. That being said....the dish was great.

We love this place and will definitely be adding this to the date night rotation, you should too.",uPpEyJRHUSQ-AtBMZVW3jQ,1,1,5,H7n_WMfCc6M3AZuxffU9tw
5721451,2016-05-29,0,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"My husband and I ate here last night after the Las Vegas International Carnaval that paraded down Fremont in front of the restaurant. We were drawn in just walking past by the whimsical hipster-yet-homey vibe of the place, very comfortable. Everything looked delicious and interesting on the menu so my husband ordered assorted appetizers and entrees; fried chicken, kale salad, a cauliflower, ribs, etc. Everything was very delicious with interesting flavors. 

Our only critique is the timing of the food coming out. To be fair, they were overwhelmed by a party of twelve and my husband gets ""hangry"" when he doesn't get at least an appetizers right away. Yet, that being said they were very gracious when he complained (even offered to give us dinner free though we did not accept) and we will definitely eat there again. I would personally like to work my way through the menu. The kale salad was so tasty I wanted to shovel it into my mouth! Kale!

I would love to see this place thrive. It's so nice to have an interesting place that is experimental with flavors and not another corporate chain restaurant with pre-fab food. 

Delicious food. Worth the trip. Worth the wait.",MnwincjHuaa__yjqSUs3EA,0,0,5,xcuPdOiZ9T3VABhNgTcyLQ

5747542,2015-11-11,3,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"Absolutely terrible experience and food.

My friend called early in the day to ensure they could accommodate our group of 10. They were confident it wouldn't be a problem. When we arrived, a table had been set up to fit all of us. The ONE good thing to happen all night. 

We placed all of our entree orders at the same time. 4 of our dishes came out in 15 minutes, 4 more a few minutes later. Two people waited for their dishes for 45 minutes while we watched several other patrons who had arrived after us receive the same dish they ordered. This entire time, no one stopped by or even near our table to check on us or give us a chance to ask when the last two dishes would arrive. Finally, we stopped the waitress and could see her dialogue with the chef - they had lost the tickets. Another 5-10 minute wait for them to get their meal. The rest of us had finished our meals before they even got their dishes. 

As for the food. I ordered CRISPY chicken thighs, described as CRISPY in the menu (crispy in the title AND description!) The skin was soft and soggy, the flavor was nothing but soy sauce, the rice was so soft that it was the texture of mashed potatoes. I love rice and soy sauce BASED sauces, but I could not finish eating this dish. I also clearly asked to substitute the bok choy in my dish with Chinese broccoli. I received bok choy in my dish, and a side of Chinese broccoli. The waitress was unapologetic and said ""For future reference, we DON'T allow substitutions."" Okay thanks, I totally knew that when I framed my side dish order in the form of a substitution request. 

The two who received their fried chicken late each received a bloody/pink piece. Clearly a rushed job, and apparently not even cooked to food safety standards.

Another friend ordered the chicken fried rice. Again, absolutely no flavor beyond soy sauce. We can soak mushy rice in soy sauce at home! And not pay $13 for it! 

And an automatic 20% gratuity for our group size to top it off. :) :) :) :) :)",-lEaTSpvijdhR7NkVQB5xQ,10,2,1,L39uGPY-kvL0-KOpfIiBmw

Fried rice. Fried chicken. Crab Rangoon. Siracha Mac-N-Cheese. Chicken and rice soup.

Find the bright red door next to Writers Block, across from 11th street records and transport yourself to Chef Natalie's kitchen. If you've tried EAT, it's the same owners. Sara was an excellent server, as was all the friendly staff that helped make our dining experience enjoyable.

We were wowed when our dishes came out. Lovely presentation, a perfect amount of food per dish. 

Vegetables were vibrant and still had a bite to them. Soggy overcooked vegetables are the worst, these were wonderful. 

The Crispy chicken on both our dishes was perfect. Great crunch, flavor and chicken. 

We shared dishes since we enjoyed both. He LOVED his General Tsos chicken. It was a little too spicy for me, but I loved pieces that had a little less kick. 

Service was great. Decor is fun. Quiet. Great date or group of friends place. We will be back.",rx0HxEsHYyaLovoXn9NXNQ,0,1,5,lTFb3EOgXCPKP5ZckA6H5g
5859584,2015-10-05,0,7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ,"Chow is the only Asian fusion I've seen in Vegas. Everything about this place screams fusion. The name, the tagline, in fact, everything except the food itself. Alabama crispy chicken. Rangoon dip. Dirt. Shumai. Potstickers. I didn't see as much fusion as: Asian-OR-American varieties of food. 
 
I ordered the four piece crispy chicken, the Rangoon crab dip, and the dirt. 

The Rangoon crab dip was nothing short of delicious. It put the other crab dips in my life to shame when I tried this perfect pairing. The sauce (aka salty dark sauce) on the side also adds a very nice Asian zing. The chips (wontons) on the side are very flavorless. It's an empty crunch. However, its lack of flavor somehow pairs perfectly with the super flavorful dip. Exceeded expectations!

The crispy chicken was also good. It has an additional flavor I've never tasted in other fried chicken. Garlic? The rangoon was the real headliner in my tummy though. 

Now, the dirt. The huge plus is that it looks ridiculously nice in presentation. Unfortunately, I can't vouch for this dessert. The Vanilla pudding flavor strongly overtakes the entire cup. It basically rends the other elements in the cup obsolete. The chocolate syrup just digresses into the flavor of its own byproducts. The Oreos tastes like processed crumbs when eaten with the super sweet pudding. It just tastes like a concoction of pudding and textures, with a faint tinge of chocolate. I would not order this again (The pictures are nice though!).

Besides the dirt, I loved this place. Having fried chicken and shumai in the same restaurant is a step in the right direction! And the rangoon and chicken were phenomenal. Can't wait to see what Chow brings to the table in the future.",wc7FwvCb3H8L8l3DugbZ7w,10,2,4,5YFJfc54Fs_Dj5JktjTang

The egg rolls were great, really loved the gravy sauce that went with it. We all ordered the fried rice (chicken, pork, and vegetable) and I have to say, I've never had such a favorable fried rice. Everything in it tasted perfect. The veggies were delicious. We all loved it. 

We ordered one of each dessert and I really enjoyed the banana pudding and dirt. They tasted homemade which was nice. 

Service was great, our lady was awesome and very personable. 

The decor was cute and there was a nice vibe. Unfortunately, I didn't care for the music being played but what can you do.
