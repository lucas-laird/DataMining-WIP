Here is my story: I ordered my pizza on a Sunday morning at 1:00 AM. After putting in my order they said that the kitchen was a little backed up with orders and that my pizza would be there within 45 minutes to an hour. Thinking that we had some time to kill before the pizza got there, I decided to set an alarm for 45 minutes and got some shut eye. 45 minutes later my alarm went off, but no pizza had yet arrived. I then waited another 20 minutes to give them some leeway. No pizza as of 2:00 AM. I called and they answered. I asked about my pizza and they clearly told me ""It's just out of the oven and on its way out. It will be there in 10 minutes.""

30 minutes pass and no pizza. At that time I was understandably upset and decided to call to cancel my order. I called and the line just kept ringing. I began to call again for the next 10 minutes and I never got an answer, not even a machine.

Being so tired that I was no longer hungry, I decided to go to sleep so I could catch my flight in the daytime. That was at 3:00 AM.

Next thing I know there's a loud banging on my door. I look at my clock at the time is 4:00 AM!!! And alas, my pizza had finally arrived along with the rest of my friends from the club. Funny thing is first thing my friends said was ""The delivery guy just tried to sell us your pizza while in the elevator for $20."" By now, every single person would be pissed off out of their mind. I talk with the delivery guy and calmly say ""The pizza is over 2 hours late. 3 hours from since I had ordered it. I do not want it, and I do not want to pay for it."" He gives me a blank stare and all he says is ""Are you serious?"" as if I am not in my right mind to be doing this to him. He goes on to say that it is not his fault, but obviously someone screwed up. I tell him that I am not paying for it and for him to refund me back my money. He leaves, but not without cursing at me.

Three days later a charge of $37 goes through onto my account from Pizza Di Roma for a pizza that was 3 hours late and I didn't even get. I DID NOT SIGN THE RECEIPT! So the only excuse is that they forged my signature, and added a $2 tip. AS I WARNED ABOVE. DO NOT EAT HERE!",vcjG61Dl-YLBzJj9FC7H5g,1,1,1,7LbQIC35VBSZmJnJHTuSVg
124843,2011-09-14,0,APkr8bzYE0xiePqmAqPzYg,"So I've eaten pizza off the strip except I had not remembered such horrible delivery service. Anyway, I woke up earlier than everyone on a Saturday and I decided to order pizza because the prices looked decent and they had a wide variety of things on their menu. So to get to the point, I order a family meal which consists of 2 medium pizzas, fingers (chicken strips), buffalo wings, pasta, salad and fries. The guy told me 20 minutes, and he took my card payment over the phone. Time passes by, to be exact 50 minutes which I didn't bother to call sooner as friends had just woken up and needed to get ready so I felt I could wait. Minutes later, I finally call to ask about the status, the man tells me that it is running late instead of 20 minutes it'll be an hour and 20 minutes since the kitchen became awfully busy. I asked him nicely if I could cancel the order as we were all starving and could not wait any longer. I mean no one stays in their hotel room for hours in a day. He says fine and hangs up. SO RUDE! Being the fact that I'm away from a computer, and could not view my transactions, I called back to ask if he had already charged me. He told me yes. I asked him ""Aren't you going to void the transaction?"" He told me no because the cancellation was not a reasonable one and no one will ever makes pizzas in 20 minutes so if I didn't pay he'd have to come out of pocket. UNBELIEVABLE! I had to give in to ask if he was able to deliver how much longer would it take, he said about 45 minutes. What? Alright so at this point I'm just pissed that my 50 bucks was going to be a waste and I didn't care if I received the order anymore. Thank god I bank conveniently enough to file a dispute. Next time I'll be sure to keep orders soley to businesses on the strip, after all I was in Vegas. This experience totally messed up my Saturday morning, I mean c'mon Vegas is already expensive. Let's just hope that I'm able to keep my money.",zRmfbwMXJ_CPbc3uOc9eng,7,0,1,nSIwUx3kU16xu6nSsBZb0Q

1872029,2011-09-04,0,APkr8bzYE0xiePqmAqPzYg,"First, we were quoted 30 minutes for our delivery from this place which is less than 5 miles from our home.  1.5 hours and countless ""where is our food"" calls later our food arrived... only half of it was missing.  We called again and *surprise!* our other meal was still sitting on top of the oven.  SERIOUSLY?!?!  All three that times we called to find out why every time estimate had passed and we still didn't have our food they didn't realize it was sill at the restaurant?!  We tried to tell them that we didn't want it and the driver could come pick up our food and give us back our money, but they refused and said they would send the driver back.  Great.  Now I can wait another 2 hours for my Calzone?!  The only possible plus is that now we have 80 napkins with our meal... that should last a while, right?  Skip this place and choose Napoli Pizzaria instead.",IoC2t71vaXBMUIe7pI98jQ,0,0,1,FCdlbITsXmCnH3jFwMgXlw
2759627,2011-10-27,0,APkr8bzYE0xiePqmAqPzYg,"The pizza here is decent, good value for the money. The salad, tasted funny and made us sick. It ruined our night. Delivery was as they quoted, 45 min to an hour. Took an hour. When the food arrived, they did not bring plates, forks, or napkins. Which I expected since we were staying in a hotel. They could have at least brought forks, since we ordered a salad. Luckily, since we were staying in a hotel, I called room service, and they brought forks.",j2nUrtAsjYtU5F90SbrBbg,2,0,2,4I8GbMExMci-hMT66WxrAg
3853751,2014-06-11,1,APkr8bzYE0xiePqmAqPzYg,Called twice and still have been waiting two hours for my pizza. When I called they were unapologetic and rude. They told me they they will just cancel my order and I had no objection to it.  I looked at the other reviews and realized that they are just a bad business with very minimal positive reviews. I will never attempt to eat here again.,qChFWpuS14TTgHp-v0Ep7g,0,0,1,Ra_NMP0qvt4BVuc8csxnRQ
4573308,2011-12-04,0,APkr8bzYE0xiePqmAqPzYg,"After reading the horror stories on yelp, it took me a little longer to try ordering from this place.  But the low prices, and easy delivery ordering website lured me in.  The lunch specials are only $5.95 and include a drink.  The delivery charge is $2 and the minimum order is $12.  Getting my order in Summerlin, about 5 miles from the restaurant took one hour, which I find to be reasonable.

The food was pretty good.  Good pizza and a perfectly cooked calzone.  The pizza sauce is not great, but it does the job.  You really cannot complain about a $5.95 lunch.

I am wondering if I ordered at a less busy time, or maybe they have recently gotten a new staff.  I will be ordering from this place again.",6B9ICWLdY9C7gGPkRX93ZQ,0,0,4,AQtA5nRjcUbRrBCx4xofuQ
5167493,2011-02-21,1,APkr8bzYE0xiePqmAqPzYg,"Reviewing as: Italian Delivery.
Pro: Delivers to your room; offers 24-hour delivery; cheap prices; decent portions.
Con: Uneven quality; disparity between quoted wait time and actual wait time.
Review: We found a menu for this place shoved under our hotel room door. We arrived late in the day, so we wanted to order in (as our hotel/resort did not have room service or a restaurant). We conducted an internet search and found that few Vegas establishments deliver. Of the establishments that deliver, many of them require high minimum orders. We ended up ordering from this establishment, twice. Please note that Pizza di Roma has a large menu (including pizzas, calzones, pasta, burgers, philly steaks, desserts, and subs) of which we sampled few items. 
1. Wait: ***: Both times, we were quoted 45 minutes. The first time, we ended up waiting 1 1/2 hours. The second time, we ended up waiting an hour.
2. Food quality: ****: The wings (*****) in the ""Bucket of Wings"" are small, but the portion size is fair. They taste delicious! We ordered them plain, but they also come mild, medium, hot, and barbecue style. The fries (****) are good, but they need a little salt. The fries' taste is somewhat dampened by their soggy and limp texture. The meatballs (****) were juicy and, I am guessing, homemade. However, the sauce (**) they sat in was salty and tasted store-bought. The baby back ribs (***) were good but a bit bland. The mashed potatoes (**) were thick and not particularly appealing.   
3. Other: according to the their flyer (received around the time of this review), they offer 24-hour delivery; they require a $10 minimum order; there is a $1.95 delivery charge (limited area) and a $1.00 surcharge for credit card purchases.
Overall: Certain items on the menu (wings!), in conjunction with the fact that they deliver, make this place a good option for in-room dining.",4WlX7JTtOVGjlLxg2PwNXQ,4,0,4,4WJahkF43b6st5Y9IlE2Ow
