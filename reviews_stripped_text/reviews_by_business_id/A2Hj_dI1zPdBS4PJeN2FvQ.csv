I can't comment on the pho as my favorite dish is the dried vermicelli salad.  I also ordered their 3-bean dessert.  It was a good first experience which deemed for a second trip.

My second visit was not as good.  Because It was a work day, I decided to use the drive through, however when I got to the drive through there was a sign that said ""come inside to see the menu"" or something in that effect.  I ordered take out once again, and this time I wanted something quick and easy like the beef chow fun.  First, as I am ordering, people were leaving and decided to have a conversation with the lady taking my order.  They continue to have a conversation like I wasn't even there.  I place my order then wait, and wait, and wait, and wait...20 minutes later, I ask the girl at the counter playing on her laptop, playing music, and watching music videos ""how long does it take to make chow fun.""  I don't think she understood English cause she looked confused.  I also asked the lady that took my order when the chow fun was going to be done.  All they can tell me was, ""it's coming, it's coming.""  When the cook finally started cooking my chow fun, it took them 5 minutes to cook and pack my order.  And by the way, I was the only customer at the time and the chow fun was just okay, nothing to rave about.  This experience is enough for me to not return to Rainbow Pho Express.  The service is terrible!",7Xr0m77k9W8DBF0LiTz48Q,0,0,1,pZTQf6OlNSnktTDqBiR56A

The dishes are a little more expensive then most typical vietnamese restaurant prices, but  they are well crafted (artistic, you can tell the chef takes his job seriously) and quality is above your typical vietnamese restaurants. I would definitely recommend this place over the closest competitor Jenni Pho.",IegXTpaLReHvm2PSH7sGZw,4,2,5,h4DiBDLX7HgbPaDcMqBtHw
324871,2012-03-23,1,A2Hj_dI1zPdBS4PJeN2FvQ,"I am from Los Angeles and visiting friends in Las Vegas, and they brought me to this Vietnamese restaurant that's way outside of the typical Chinatown.  Rainbow Pho Express is located in the corner of a strip center that even has a drive-thru.  The restaurant looks fairly new, appropriately decorated, and the staffs were quite friendly.  However, the gem was hidden in that bowl of Pho.  In order to give a good contrast to this review, one has to understand that there are plenty of good Pho places in LA, so Rainbow Pho Express landing number one on my favorite Vietnamese restaurant is a serious matter.  Now back to the actual review, I ordered the Pho Special, the bowl landed in front of me, and the fragant smell of that broth must required hours of simmering.  The noodle was cooked to al-dente, which won't be all soggy and soft by the time you finish the entire bowl.  The meat was fresh as the taste of the beef still lingers. I also had a cup of their coffee, and this is the kind of coffee to ensure you will be awake on the drive back to LA kind of caffine dose. My friend ordered the prawns which was served in a mini clay pot, it's not for the light palates, because the sauce is heavily flavored, but of course that's why they bring you a place of rice!   

Watch out, Vegas, finally healthier options are available at the drive-thru replacing the typical ""2000 calorie burger""!!!

Anyways we just happened to try this place on a whim as we were about to step into Cheeburger, Cheeburger and glad we tried it. Walked in and we were quickly seated as it was a slow night. 

We started off our dining experience with the pot stickers which were decent but the sauce was bland. Then we each ordered our bowls of Pho - I ordered the rare beef & brisket and WOW these bowls were huge! The broth was darker than you see at most places so you expect it to be packed with flavor. This certainly did not disappoint. Great fusion of flavor with all the ingredients. The meat was tender and actually tasted like real meat. As others mentioned, the noodles were cooked perfectly and were not mushy. Their iced Thai tea was good but a little pricey ($3.50) for the small glass they give you.

Overall the dining experience was great. The staff was quick and always checked on us. The pros compared to Jenni Pho is that they take debit cards. So if you don't want to make the trek to Chinatown and live in the SW, try this place. Another thing is that they have a separate menu for the drive-thru so they do give you options.",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,0,0,4,3vhrhpIkLOhZ3rW1_Nl7Kg

They are very generous with their portions. $8-$10 for their rice dishes and you seriously get a huge square plate with loads of food. You can even share between 2 people and you both will be full. Place is very new and clean and it even has a drive thru. The service is actually good here as compared to other Asian places. 

The only downside I think is their drink prices. It was $3.50 for most of the specialty drinks, but the sizes are kind of small. But I guess they have to make money somewhere since they make their food portions so big.",sVR6XQh9MZc2cpiZmK_lpg,1,0,5,0ek3dENRrd6OSS3TwZtqrw

It's really a simple Vietnamese dish but they made it super good..............it's because of the delicious flavored BBQ pork.   

Overall was a great experience, had a good starter on some good egg rolls as other recommended. And end with a fresh coconut jello as the waitress recommended.

Service here is excellent. We were greeted, asked how the food was, and thanked when we left.  The service here has already exceeded what employees would do and Jenni.  The food here is made fresh, you won't have to worry about your food being microwaved.  How did I know that? I heard the chef cooking. Unlike Bamboo bistro, I had microwaved chicken one time.  I like place because it's new and more importantly the place is clean.  This place is another restaurant that is worth the supports from locals.

we walk in and they were friendly.  
small as it was, the waitress took awhile to even give us water.  [i guess im just used to someone giving us water right when we come in at other joints.]

so I turn around to try and wave one of the two waitresses down to let them know we're ready after about 10 minutes... and she comes to our table to let us know that it will only be a few more minutes.  she apologizes.  

1st timers so we're forgiving.. 

we finally order & the food came out quickly.  but!  they forgot my husbands soup.  so again, another 10 minutes go by & my husband finally gets a hold of the waitress & she apologizes again & grabs his soup. 

my order: seafood noodle: MORE seafood please!  a little skimp with the fillers but there is plenty of broth & noodles.  the broth is really good though!  but it needs more shrimp, squid... maybe some fish?
 
kids: shrimp, bbq, & shredded pork plate & beef noodle soup... both of which the kids said were very good.

the food is really good.. service on the other hand... is questionable.  we only got 1 serving of water & when we asked for our check she finally realizes that we didn't have water... another apology.

maybe another waitress? idk... but all in all the food is very good!",Nw6Jza_cb0aqd4PT769Vzw,4,1,3,ORonA45L5NcSl0JM0ginLw
2151491,2012-06-21,1,A2Hj_dI1zPdBS4PJeN2FvQ,"I can't say that I loved this place. 

This pho place is located in a small strip mall off the strip someplace on Rainbow. My group all was craving pho especially me because I was hungover. There is plenty of parking in the lot. The place was pretty busy when my group of 6 went in. The owners quickly pushed a few tables together to seat our ""large"" group. After a little while we all knew what we wanted to order. I have to say for pho, this place was slightly expensive but maybe that's comparing it to westminster or garden grove prices? I ordered the Pho Tai, pho with rare beef slices because I do not eat intestines or tendon whatever the usual Pho is.

One of the few drawbacks of this place is the slow service. I have to say it TOOK FOREVER for our PHO to come out. None of this was helpful especially since I was HUNGOVER. When our food finally came out, it was pretty good. It was a little disappointing because 2 of my friends ordered theirs without any cilantro in it. But low and behold, both their pho soups had TONS of cilantro in it. 

Another thing that confused me was their confusion over the check. I wanted to pay for 2 phos and some eggrolls and it took the cashier 10 minutes to calculate that off the entire check. Other than that it was pretty decent. Not the best Pho...but not the worst. Would I come here again?

2318834,2012-10-05,1,A2Hj_dI1zPdBS4PJeN2FvQ,"This place is literally a block from my house and my girlfriend, who has never had Pho before, was picking up a slight cold so I thought we'd try it out instead of driving all the way to Chinatown. 

BAD DECISION. And I feel terrible for allowing her first pho experience to be from this miserable establishment. 

The service was TERRIBLE. And terrible from a pho-restaurant-with-usual-slow-service standpoint. There were maybe four other tables seated when we got inside. The table directly behind us had about 6 people and they were interacting with the waiters as if they knew one another or were friends. They definitely spoke the same language and our female waiter LITERALLY went to their table at least 5-6 SEPARATE times to speak with them, laugh with them, clear their plates, etc. She finally came to our table, threw two menus down and walked away without saying a word. The male waiter then came over and brought us two waters. He was at least friendly and smiling. She was like Jekyll and Hyde in the way she treated us versus other guests in the restaurant. 

When she came back, about another 10 minutes later, I ordered pot stickers, rare beef steak pho and chicken pho. Again, she did not say one word - just stared at me, wrote down the order, and then grabbed the menus and walked away. 

Our food came out fast - I'll give them one star for that. I'll give another star for the taste, even though it wasn't amazing. The broth was delicious, but my meat was not tender. It was tough, not rare, and cut into awkwardly big pieces. 

My girlfriend enjoyed her pho but didn't eat any of the chicken because of how tough it was. 

We asked the male waiter to bring our check, and he did, within a few seconds. Then, of course, it took the female waitress another 10 minutes to take my debit card. And another 5 minutes to bring it back to me. Meanwhile, she's laughing and sitting with the table directly behind us. 

There is NOTHING I hate more than being treated like my order/my money/my table doesn't matter. Terrible customer service will get you nothing but TERRIBLE reviews and eventually, no business at all.",1pqyIOcWh-EEHOR9AHUkWA,4,2,2,tev37vlH8nAx1zjgiySjCg

The biggest downside was the wait but we came in when they were slammed (which is a good sign).  The service was good and the food made up for the wait.

I really enjoyed the pho broth.  Many of the other broth's on Spring Mtn aren't memorable or taste extremely watered down but this broth was rich in flavor and had a sweetness to it.  If you find the broth a little sweet, balance it with the siracha or red chili paste.

In addition to the pho, we got the standard shrimp spring roll.  They were made fresh and the presentation was probably the best i've ever seen, cut up diagonal and standing up with garnish.

The Ca Kho To (Clay pot Fish) had damm good bold flavor.  Portion wise it was smaller than what I'm used to but taste was spot on and ate it all up with the rice.  For those who haven't tried it, there's alot of bones, which is standard for the dish.  Just be careful. I thought it was really good.

3698995,2012-07-09,1,A2Hj_dI1zPdBS4PJeN2FvQ,"The food here is absolutely amazing. The service, however, is DREADFUL if you're non-Vietnamese speaking.

My boyfriend and I live in the complex of houses right behind this place, so we go here often. Every time we've gone, the service has been terribly slow. There is a male waiter there who barely speaks any English, and we can tell he is hesitant to talk to us because he can't understand 75% of what we're saying. He will often sit at one of the tables watching TV without bothering to help us.

They frequently mess up our orders, as well. We usually order the spring rolls and ask for NO MINT. I'd say we've probably ordered this appetizer roughly 7 times, and they've only remembered to take the mint out twice. The aforementioned male waiter there didn't understand us at all when we tried to explain we didn't want any mint leaves in our spring rolls. I also asked him where the bathrooms were once. He had no idea what I was saying. You'd think he'd at least learn the word ""bathroom"", it's a pretty important word.

When they take our drink orders, we usually just ask for water. They've never actually gotten the water for us on the first try, we  have to wait for someone to walk by and ask, ""Can we have our water now?"" before they bother getting it for us.

Ordering for pickup has been an unpleasant experience, as well. We often order the lemon-grass chicken dinner and it's supposed to come with rice and a small soup. Twice we ordered this for pickup and when we got home, there was no soup. Finally the third time we ordered this meal for pickup, I checked the take-out bag in advance. Sure enough, there was no soup. I said, ""Excuse me, but doesn't this meal come with soup?"" and the girl working there asked, ""You want soup?"" as if I was making a special request. It's like...yeah, I want the soup, it's supposed to COME with my meal.

Of course, I've noticed Vietnamese families walk in and they get great service. The wait staff will stand there for several minutes talking and laughing with them. I understand it's natural to seek kinship with people who speak your native tongue, but this establishment isn't located in a predominantly Vietnamese-speaking area. In fact I'd say most people in this area are white or Hispanic. It's just downright rude to show natural favoritism towards one group or another. It's especially annoying because I've been coming here at least twice a week since they opened and they still act like I'm a complete stranger every time I come in. Come on Rainbow Pho, do all white people really all look the same to you?

The only reason we tolerate the crap service is because the food is just so good. Their lemon grass chicken and peppered beef dinners are to die for. Their pho is so-so, but with enough added chili sauce it's also extremely good. Their chicken curry soup is also amazing. I'm deeply saddened that their food is so mind numbingly great but their service is so terribly bad. I almost wish the food was sub-par so I had an excuse to stop coming here.",wGI0HA85_RDLAhcF12_KJQ,0,0,3,hzBB5nfx_vgmGSVcwA7Fbw

Rainbow Pho Express is pretty authentic!  Reminds me of the Pho places I love back in San Jose, CA where you know Pho is authentic because of the number of Vietnamese residents that reside there.

My go to items to order are of course the Special Combination Pho soup, fried egg rolls that come w/ lettuce to wrap and dip in the fish sauce, and my ultimate favorite is their vermicelli bowl equipped with grilled shrimp and fried egg rolls.  Their rice plates with pork chop is real good too.  Everything is flavorful here and I love their Pho broth; there is no need to add sauces to it, just some lime and jalapeno for a little kick!  They have an abundance of veggies in their vermicelli bowl which is why its my favorite!

I knocked off a star because they don't have very many chicken dishes, or none at all on their menu which I find weird.

Rainbow Pho Express passes with high marks in these departments. So why only 4 stars? The portions are off and I know my fellow Viets will be disappointed with the meat ration here. One skewer of meat for Bun Thit Nuong?? That's a tease for any carnivore. As for the egg rolls, the filling is as close to being authentic as Vegas gets but I wish they used a thinner crispier rice paper vs the chinese-egg roll rice paper.

The combination (or ""special"") pho is a good deal. I'm not talking monetarily. It has a generous amount of rare steak, tripe, and tendon. (It also has other meat, but those are my favorites). I like the lower and wider bowl that they use. It really lets me get to every last morsel. And the broth is so good that I slurped it all up yesterday. I was completely full, but they gave me a free mung bean dessert that was delicious and really hit the spot.

I've also tried their bun bo hue and the clay pot fish dish. Their BBH doesn't compare to Bosa 1, but I think my short-lived BBH phase has passed anyway. The clay pot fish was yummy, though a tad salty. I also love how they serve their spring rolls with a vertical presentation--you don't see that at other places.

It's hard to say that RPE is as good as it gets, but I'm most definitely a fan. Oh and they have a drive-thru, which I have not tried. I'd rather dine in.

1 star for their awesome drive thru. 1 star for their awesome service. And that's where the stars stop. 

I hated my pho. Wait, I'm sorry, hate is a strong word, I disliked my pho. A lot. It had a sweet broth and was just all wrong. Sure they give you a big portion for about $7, but as we all over use this phrase, quality over quantity! I got the rare steak and brisket pho and my brisket was so fatty. It was more like flank than brisket. I tried to spice my broth with basil, sriracha, lime juice, anything that would alter the broth a little, but it just didn't work. Sheer disappointment. I had bites from my girlfriend's vermicelli and crispy noodles and nothing sparked. My girlfriend's crispy noodle with gravy was so salty. I couldn't even go in for a second bite. Why this place is rated so high? Beats me. They were so highly praised at the nail salon we were getting our nails done at earlier that day, so we thought, these Asians have to know what's up!

It's tucked away next to a burger joint, Cheeburger Cheebruger.  Anyhow, when we got inside it was clean and very nice looking.....but, was the food going to add up to our Chinatown staple, Pho Kim Long? 

We started out with coconut juice which was a nice treat.  After slurping down the juice you can eat the coconut meat inside.  My wife and I split the Pho Tai w/ rare steak and it was a pretty par price of $6.99.  It was delicious!  Nikki's uncle got the No. 38 Com Dia which was $9.99.  For the price it was a really good deal.  Kind of a combination plate with 1 marinated beef bbq stick, grilled shrimp stick, egg roll, fried rice, noodles, salad, and a mini pho soup.  I think I'm going to have to get that next time.  I tried a couple pieces of the marinated beef and it was sooooo good.  

However, the service needed some work.  Are server was attentive and was really pleasant.  However, at the end of our meal Nikki's uncle notice on the check that they did not charge us for the coconut juice.  Being the good samaritan he is, he told them.  They ended up charging us $15 total for all 3!  We asked them why.  Because on the menu it said they were $2.50 each ($7.50 for 3).  They said that there were two different kinds: juice in the can $2.50 and juice in the coconut $3.50.  But, even if we paid the $3.50 they were over charging us.  Anyhow, they felt bad and explained there were discrepancies in the menu.  I think they have discrepancies in their math.  

I would give Rainbow Pho Express a 5 for their food!  It was so good that I wanted to go back the next day.  But, their service brought it down a couple notches.  I would say that from my first visit I would rate this place a 3.

JeniPHO is our normal southwest Pho spot, but because they only accept cash when we only had debit, we hit up Rainbow.  We step in the restaurant and to my surprise, it looks a hellofalot smaller than how it looks from the outside.. somewhat of a hallway with two rows of booths and tables... but that was not the problem.  We walk in with no one to greet myself and my party.  We stand around for about 10 minutes wondering if we were supposed to seat ourselves or wait to be seated.  Finally a waitress steps out of the kitchen to take orders from already seated customers.  I try to make eye contact with her and wave her down but then she rushes back inside the kitchen.  Another 10 minutes or so have passed and just about the time we were ready to walk out, the same waitress rushes back from the kitchen, makes eye contact with me and without a smile, a hello or a welcome, she points us to our table.. mind you she was across the hallway.  We walk to our table and find that it had not been reset from the prior customers.  A gentleman busts through the kitchen door and clears the table.  The waitress then approaches us and throws us our menus without again eye contact,  a smile, a ""hello"" or even a ""Welcome to Rainbow Pho"".  Where's the decency?!!  We end up ordering Eggrolls for the appetizer, the traditional Steak Pho, Curry Noodle Soup and a Thai Iced Coffee.  30 minutes pass by and our food has yet to be served.. i mean.. how long does it take to stew up some beef broth and raw meat?  Let alone fry up four eggrolls?  The waiter comes out with two large cokes wherein I inform him that it was not part of our order.  He apologizes and says he is giving us free cokes because he realizes our order is taking so long.  First of all, we don't drink much coke, second, they were large cokes and third.. i still haven't received my iced coffee!  Another 10 minutes ensue with stomachs ready and waiting.  Our first order comes out and suprise!! ..its Pho!! ..but wait.. no appetizer?  Isn't the appetizers main purpose is to appetize before the main course?  The rolls finally come out and the Curry Soup slowly follows it.. still no iced coffee.  The Pho and the eggrolls were tastey, the Curry Soup however was very bland.  I had to throw in about 5 lime wedges, jalapenos and hoison sauce in the mix for me to actually enjoy the soup.  Oh yeah, the iced coffee finally arrived to its destination and it was probably the best item I've ordered.  I think they should've at least comp'd the coffee. Other than that, I wasted about an hour of my life on waiting and poor customer service.  I would've rather sold that hour of my life to the devil in exchange for some Cheeburger.

The soup always comes out piping hot and the flavor is a perfect balance - not too cilantro-y (which i prefer), mild, but still very flavorful.  They also give you a nice amount for just 6.99.  I've had their pho dine in and take out and its consistently good.

Their rice plates are good too.  I always get this one with pork bbq and it come's with an eggroll, shrimp skewer, soup, and rice (I don't know the real names of the dishes, lol).  Their bbq sticks are REAL good.  Their shrimp sticks are real bad (really needs seasoning or something!).  Its not really a deal breaker or anything since all their other food is pretty solid.

I also love getting their fresh coconut juice.  I've gotten is 3 times already.  Twice the coconut was hard, so I couldn't get to enjoy scraping the meat off... but once, it was perfect and had a helluva time eating the coconut meat.

Service is pretty OK.  It's sort of different every time I've been.  Really great to just whatever.  Got the check wrong once, but it was quickly fixed.

5100312,2012-03-16,1,A2Hj_dI1zPdBS4PJeN2FvQ,"Pho in the SW worthy of Spring Mountain.

As a long time eater of Vietnamese food. I'm a self-proclaimed pho expert. I like to eat it and I like to make it. You can't hide bad pho. But good pho speaks for itself. Who would expect some of the best pho in Vegas to be located next to a Cheeburger Cheeburger AND have a drive-thru?

BROTH: Pho places that serve watered down broth should be ashamed of themselves. The broth is the vessel that brings together all the ingredients. The noodles, meats, and veggies unite in harmony to form the perfect Vietnamese comfort food. Rainbow broth is served piping hot and the flavor is on the stronger side. The balance of spices is perfect. 

NOODLES: Nothing kills a bowl like a bed of mushy noodles. My noodles were served with just the perfect amount of bite. Not undercooked and not over.

MEAT: Exceptional! Equal to the slices and cuts of meats that I get at Pho So 1. This is a factor that too many places skimp on. The tai is served rare, you think we're not gonna know if the meat is funky and you're using odd cuts of beef? 

VARIETY: There are the usual rice and noodle dishes. And I saw a couple chinese-inspired plates as well. As an app, I went with the Vietnamese egg rolls. They were amazing! I like them big and long.... (get your mind out of the gutter) If you've ever received a plate of skinny egg rolls, you know what I mean. 

SERVICE: There were a few employees. They were all eating at one of the tables. Although this is unorthodox, its a privately-owned joint by Asian people. They never do things by the book. They were attentive, made good suggestions, and were overall pretty nice! Its probably a good thing to see them actually eat the food they serve up.

Although prices are $1-$2 higher than what you would find on Spring Mountain, what I lose in my wallet I gain in convenience. Rainbow is just down the street from mi casa and I will continue to return! Plus, unlike Jenni Pho, Rainbow has quality and takes cards.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,8,4,4,ftnZsa5kChJEDGHcgKnbZA

This place gives you a good hearty chunk of tendon, unlike some other places located on Spring Mountain Road, their tendon is soft and edible. In terms of the broth, at first, I didn't love it. It was not the exact flavor I was used to, but it was still delicious. The KEY thing I love about this place is that everything seems fresh. No matter what time of day I go, the sprouts and leaves are always fresh, but that's not the case at most places. There have been a couple times on SMR where I asked for fresh sprouts because the ones they brought out weren't crisp. Don't get me wrong, they were still ""fresh"" in the sense they weren't wilting, but I love my freshness to my vegetables. And the food always come out steaming hot (of course, they all do at all places).

In terms of spring rolls, I got it there once. I don't think I've ever enjoyed a spring roll from any restaurant. They're always on the dry side and not much to it than rice noodles, skimpy shrimp, a few shreds of vegetable.

I've eaten at the other place a few times, and both times I never completely enjoyed my Pho.  Broth there was never flavorful, and for me the broth is a big deal.  Customer service is decent, like any small asian restaurant.  In all honesty, you're not going to get the best service ever from these kinds of places.  I've worked in big chain restaurants before, so I'm not expecting anymore from a Pho place than just good food.  

I've eaten at many other Pho places before, so to help Rainbow Express out I've gotten my menus just brought to me on my table with no eye contact or so from other places; but each time I've come here they've always greeted me.  They take debit/credit which makes sense in this day and age.  I could never understand restaurants that take ONLY CASH.  Restaurant itself isn't very big.  Like another reviewer said it's just one row of booths, and a row of tables.  Restaurant is clean, and so are the bathrooms.  Service can be slow sometimes.  Last time I visited it took a while for them to bring my check; but they were nice enough to pack up my remaining food.

Pho itself is good for my tasting.  My other favorite place to go is Pho Saigon 8 on Eastern, and to me Rainbow's Pho is just as flavorful.  Bowl is large, the side veggies they give are fresh.  Egg rolls are yummy, but I have yet to try their rice dishes.  To each their own, but  I'm glad I tried out Rainbow Express because I was never diggin' Jenni Pho.

I wasn't in the mood for pho, so I opted for the grilled pork and eggroll bun. My fella ordered the same, minus the eggroll. Our dining companions started with the eggroll appetizer and tried the chicken pho and a fried noodle dish. Our food came out very quickly and we were all pleasantly surprised by the enormous portions. The flavors were great and I really enjoyed everything about my bowl. Great flavors, large quantity of noodles, protein, eggrolls and veggies. Definitely worth of the prices listed. Everyone was incredibly happy with their meals and we discussed in length how happy we all were with our meal. Our drinks were never left empty for long, even though we stayed at our table for quite some time.They didn't bring most of us chopsticks, but I'll definitely have to make sure to ask for some next time I'm there.
