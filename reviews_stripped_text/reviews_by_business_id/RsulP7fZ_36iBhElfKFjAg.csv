212728,2016-04-25,0,RsulP7fZ_36iBhElfKFjAg,"Ordered their wings again, this time they did not disappoint. They were as good as I remember them and I was reminded of why dominos is the only place I ever ordered wings from. Tender meat covered in buffalo sauce. In comparison to the last time I ordered, it was a complete turn around; the pieces were not small or with little meat and they were not dry or bland in taste. This is why dominos has always been my favorite place for wings. 


Their wings are not as good as I remembered them, they lacked buffalo sauce and the wings themselves had too much fat on them. This used to be my favorite place for wings, but I doubt I will be getting them again. Also when I picked up my order, the cashier couldn't figure out out much to give me back and he was short on the change... But I let that go. Just saying, if you're a cashier, you should be able to give the right change back.

1461736,2016-01-30,0,RsulP7fZ_36iBhElfKFjAg,"Dominos pizza is good/ok but not great in my opinion. Many of my friends vote it as their favorite pizza but I have to disagree and I don't think they have tried many pizza besides this, little caesars, and pizza hut. It's very ordinary, and it certainly gets the job done when you are in the mood for pizza though. I like the bread but the crust leaves a lot to be desired. Their cinnamon sticks are good especially when you get the dipping cream. 

I am yet to try the wings. I was once going to order them but my standards are so high on wings I decided to try it another day. The breadsticks aren't as good as other places. For instance, papa johns has the greatest breadsticks, so fluffy and chewy! Dominos are straight, same shape, nothing extraordinary and are just ok. 

Dominos certainly has come along way and they have a lot to choose from whether it be sandwiches, pasta, and chicken, but I haven't tried any of this and honestly because it doesn't look attractive. The desserts are decent and the lava cake is nice and sweet. Also the price is good with dominos so that is something it has going for it.",BGZcv3B3mlofVJYG_TTsMw,0,0,3,bE1xUmT1OwkJz9dZ-iQFXw
1467274,2015-10-18,2,RsulP7fZ_36iBhElfKFjAg,"We always order Pizza Hut so we decided to try something different. I downloaded the Dominos Pizza app and reviewed their menu and specials. We decided to go with the following special: 2 medium pizzas with 2 toppings for $5.99 each. Sounds like a real deal, right? Not really. You see what they fail to tell you is that if you want pan crust, it will cost extra. Since we were trying to be cheap this night, I went with the regular ole hand tossed crust. Folks if you want to know what cardboard tastes like, just order dominos hand tossed pizza. It's absolutely nauseating. Now to be clear, I've never actually eaten cardboard, but if I did, I think this is what it would taste like. In general the pizza lacked flavor and was overall unsatisfying.  

To be fair, I will say the delivery time was quick and their app is a tad more tech savvy than Pizza Hut.

If you're going to order off the app don't make the same mistake I did. If you select all of the items you want on your pizza and go back and change the crust type be sure that the toppings you selected are still there. Mine weren't. I was very disappointed when one of my pizzas was just cheese. :( 

Due to the fact that the crust reminded me of cardboard , I'll probably never eat there again.",IEQjRwcXUJQ4J-x4H6Nfsg,1,0,2,br9Nscz07wG9mNdxqkT86g

She should not be a manager she has poor customer service skills. One of the employees took my order over the phone and ran my card twice. I called back to see how the charges would be reversed to my card and spoke with Sarah the manager. First she didn't apologize or acknowledge her employee dropped the ball and charged me. She blamed my bank, like are you stupid or retarded my bank has nothing to do with your employee authorizing a charge that should have not went through. I contacted Wells Fargo to submit a claim after speaking with her she was so rude. When the delivery guy came my order was messed up. I specifically told the employee I want the same two large pizzas with three toppings like I had the night before with no garlic brush on the pizza crust. My husband calls back and the same girl that took my order over the phone answers and swears I didn't tell her no garlic brush but we always order that it's on the system. Can't believe she lied like that. My husband asked for the manager he was put on hold she gets back on the phone says the manager is busy. My husband told her no put her on the phone. Sarah the manager gets on the phone and asks what the problem is we had to explain the order was wrong once again she says it's our fault and says all she can do is give us free pizza but still argues it was my fault . We had to pursuance her to throw in some brownies for the inconvenience. We asked for frosting she said that would be extra 0.50 she would have to charge my card. Are you serious ???? I will not order from this location ever again this is the last time I'm going through this with Dominos. I can't believe this is how they treat long time customers. I am taking my money some where else. Do yourself a favor and take my word for it Dominos sucks

Part 2 just got our delivery and no brownies is this manager seriously doing shit on purpose. We ended up sending the pizzas back. It already took 45 minutes for another fuck up. I'm hungry frustrated and have not eaten. Corporate needs to contact me right away this is unacceptable.  The delivery driver was rude also and laughed when my husband asked where the brownies were. She cussed at him and used a racial slur. As his witness I heard her say Nigga I'm going to get you. That's a threatening thing to say and just down right disgusting.

3203631,2010-05-24,20,RsulP7fZ_36iBhElfKFjAg,"We have all done things we aren't proud of...even Rex Marvin. Sure, I threw a blind old lady down a flight of stairs for touching my foot with her cane. I have gone into hospitals and eaten people's food while they are asleep, took the flowers and used their toilet and not flushed. I have chased little kids off my lawn with a hacksaw and a freshly cut pigs head. I have thrown snowballs that I have soaked in waters and put in my freezer until they were harder than rocks at Girl Scouts just so they would drop their boxes of cookies. I have dreamed of Kenny G naked.  I have done ALL of these things AND some things that I am not proud of. 

I will share one shameful secret with you now. For years, when the tin can collection business was bad, and when the Cabbage Patch sex doll modification industry bottomed out...I was forced...to eat Domino's pizza.  I know! I know. I am a monster. I hate myself. I really do. It is like the time I slept with Melissa Rivers, there is no excuse. There is no water that can clean my body, no booze that can erase my memories, no religion that can fix my broken soul.  Melissa and Dominos...two of the most horrible things anyone can put in their mouth. 

For months I have seen the commercials that Dominos have changed. Apparently the old chef's formula of tire rubber, used diapers, cheese made in the Ukraine and some kind of red liquid type substance was no longer suitable to the American palate.  News flash...it never was! It was cheap. It was easy to get and 9 out of 10 times conveniently placed near a hospital, insane asylum, refugee camp, old man bar or a factory whose chemicals were so strong that it removes 2 or more senses from its long term employees.  The weak, the drunk, the drug addled, the infirmed, the crazy, the stupid and the people who didn't know any better were the Domino's typical crowd. The lobby of a Domino's rivaled the DMV for the scariest place on earth.

Well...dear readers...I know you love me. I know you worship me. I know that I am your God. You know I hate you all, but you don't care. That makes me hate you more. Well, your love of me after this admission will complete the process from abject hatred to indifference.  I tried it again. I did. The commercials got me. I had to know this hot crap could be any better?  Well, you know what...it is. It is MUCH better.  I want to preference this part of my review by saying that all chain pizza places suck and they should not be considered to be real pizza by anyone who doesn't live in Idaho, because they are rubes who know no better. So my stars are based only on chain pizza places and not real food.

So, I tried the new and improved red sauce pizza and it is good for what it is...a step above frozen pizza, and 10 steps below real pizza.  I didn't think it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, I didn't think it was as good as good plain bread. It was a pretty decent chain pizza.  Well, after that...and this accounts for one star...I had a revelation...they serve white sauce and BBQ sauce.  The BBQ sauce was okay, take it or leave it...but the white pizza was so damn good it made my knees shake.  This was actually a good pizza.  Here is why. The white sauce was good, I added chicken and bacon for my toppings...immediately I am giving Dominos every chance to be good. How can you screw this up...well they didn't and they did something wonderful. The butter cheese spread they put on the crust that really is a decent addition with the red sauce, and useless with the BBQ, was now a true delight. This pizza was rich, buttery, cheesy, and delicious.  It cost me 6 bucks, and for 6 bucks I will get it again...and not just when I am high as a kite off of dust cleaner fumes...oh no...it is good enough to eat sober...and lets face it...whoever thought they would say that about Dominos?

Will order again from this location. Thanks Lesley!",GagmAVaCu_kvQJUFP8SXrg,0,0,5,LIWbpWkvYwatpLs85tCXZQ

I called the manager.  She said there were problems with the online ordering.  This was 20 minutes ago.

When we get it delivered, the drivers are always nice and the pizza hot.

4856429,2018-01-02,1,RsulP7fZ_36iBhElfKFjAg,"I haven't eaten dominoes in a long time. And tonight is a reminder of why. They have it down to a science on how to skimp while paying poor attention to execution. My pizza was over cooked burned edges. The pepperoni is micro thin. And the whole thing was like flavored cardboard. In recent years I have been getting pizzas from Costco. The quality,taste,execution and over all consistency are many times better. My domino days are done..I won't tolerate this mediocrity, thank God I picked it up I would have been even more disappointed if I had to pay delivery charge and tip. On a side note I noticed one of the delivery guys cars it appeared that his door was about to fall off of his car...way to go dominos on exploiting the poor to deliver your garbage.",O5VAQ-dbR2Bk0OZLL1L0Ig,2,1,1,32UBE4rh5R2Fhm-D5XtPRw

Called the store around 50 minute mark and they said there was nothing they could do but just cancel the order.  Offered no apologies and extremely unfriendly.  Absolutely ridiculous.

5241029,2012-09-07,1,RsulP7fZ_36iBhElfKFjAg,"Seriously, I am a huge fan of Dominos and their breadbowls!
In every other place, I order pasta with alfredo sauce, chicken, bacon, and mushrooms. I ask for EXTRA on everything.
Wanna know what I get? 5-6 pieces of chicken. Very little bacon. And dry pasta.
In other dominos, I get what I ask for. and it is AMAZING.
Not here.
Now my next favorite thing HOT WINGS.
They're so dam stingy here! My hot wings were regular wings with almost imaginary sauce. Wth! No sauce whatsoever.
Where I used to live, their stuff was always great.
I hate that this dominos doesn't deliver what I ask for.
Makes me MAD.
I have to drive elsewhere for my hot wings and pasta.
Not cool, dominos. Not cool.",tGuMHXSvqcLTA7rifH_3_w,0,0,1,VmujhV_mpJh1TW3CxP1vvQ

We were in need of food but of course, most restaurants off the strip were closed. Luckily, this specific Domino's was open and delivered to her apartment!

Our pizza and breadsticks were delivered in less than 25 minutes from the time we ordered, which was great and the pizza was scalding hot. I always liked Domino's and I dig their new recipe as well. For $16 we got out cheap. My only complaint is that their dipping sauce has way too much basil in it. 

I'd say this is a solid option for late night on the west side.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,2,3,ZlwM20GyOIc8ake3hpbBNg
