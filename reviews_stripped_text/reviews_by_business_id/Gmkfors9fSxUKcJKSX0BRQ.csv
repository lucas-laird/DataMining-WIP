619971,2015-06-27,0,Gmkfors9fSxUKcJKSX0BRQ,Nope not even one star. The stupid worker gave me a sandwich with old and it  be very hard then she lied and said that the bread wasn't hard. ALL SHE HAD TO DO WAS CHANGED THE DAMN BREAD,7eSP8AkQa0krWl60n3TN4Q,1,0,1,qvEeq3_Lk80-i3tETfIWrg
1148136,2012-04-26,0,Gmkfors9fSxUKcJKSX0BRQ,"Subway is...okay.  I'm giving it 3 stars not because the food is bad (well some of it is, using the microwave to make a sammich? Marone!) but because it's just not knock your socks off good. If I'm going to spend my lazily earned money on food, I want something that I can't make at home, and besides,  there are so many better options out there (Jimmy Johns, Jason's).  

I have to say when I'm on the UNLV campus and I walk by the outdoor Subway (not the one in the Student Union) and smell that bread, it makes me want to walk in.  But I can make a turkey sammich at home for free. Plus I'm not eatin anywhere that uses a speedo clad man as a spokesperson. 

But in a pinch, Subway delivers a consistent, good, middle of the road sammich.",_8nmm7M1uEXquSUFAqm0fw,0,0,3,GLDBZonATMyIcV0cl4W9pA

2674034,2013-11-20,0,Gmkfors9fSxUKcJKSX0BRQ,I give this location 5 stars for their superior customer service!  The food quality is great as well.  What a nice visit - the Tuscan chicken sanwich is awesome!,BqbmLC9CgThBKGc-aNaeqA,0,0,5,ib6IoJCXlotq-scLjZ7EDg
3096695,2014-07-20,0,Gmkfors9fSxUKcJKSX0BRQ,Ah who doesn't love subway? It's fresh and convenient as always the veggie patty foot long never let's me down. Love their honey oat bread toasted with pepper jack cheese. Here's a photo. I put all my veggies with the exception of pickles :) make it more healthier by not adding any mayo just olive oil for your digestive system and sprinkle a little salt and pepper and whoala!,GvIr0XyO-s48GoRzndpw4w,0,0,5,rBuw-ILw4jbWTE--_dlkng

4031343,2017-03-27,0,Gmkfors9fSxUKcJKSX0BRQ,"Wow this was one of the friendliest subway locations I have ever been to! I walked in right @ 11 AM, and was serviced quickly. I appreciated how sweet the woman was who was taking my order. Subway has a big amount of different types of sandwiches. If you don't like the choices, you can make your own. They have many bread types, many meats, cheeses, vegetables.",fj-cFMD2qheCcv3FNvMcEg,0,1,5,Mjm0u6mDj0v5d53SBl3vgA
4452006,2012-07-15,0,Gmkfors9fSxUKcJKSX0BRQ,"This is a very nice Subway. I stopped in here after work one night and was in desperate need of sandwiches for me and my fiance. I happened to have one of those buy-one-get-one coupons I received in the mail and the worker here was very happy to honor the coupon. He didn't even really look at it.

The sandwiches were made very well and the young man behind the counter was very jovial and nice to me. I was afraid it was maybe a bit too late and they were closing, but he ensured me all was good and they were actually open for another hour.

Honestly I've been to a lot of Subways, but this one in particular is being run by very good management because it shows in the decorum of their employees AND the fresh/well put together sandwiches.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,5,86hfzFZiJ0py3keMNO1OVg
4543092,2015-04-30,0,Gmkfors9fSxUKcJKSX0BRQ,This is the best subway I have ever been to. The guy working there was awesome and super polite. Place was clean and the food was fresh and great. So cool to live within walking distance.  Highly recommend.,Qhs5nJ5efW3HpXTGFahXlA,0,0,5,7sBozXUc8uLi69Hsn067Zw

The chick was by herself at first with customers ahead of us, but didn't get overwhelmed.
She greeted us when we first walked in & was quick & efficient but nice also.  
The food seemed fresh!
A decent 'fast food' experience is always one I'm grateful for.
Thanks Subway on Trop & Eastern!",P7Qt34VblZupUifRJ_5hbA,0,0,5,O_Dw1Yx8t7z1yD1W4rwBlg

4966635,2008-12-30,0,Gmkfors9fSxUKcJKSX0BRQ,place is maintained clean. The quality of subs are really good. It has all the spanish staff so we had some confusion in our order but in the end it was all good. :). subway is always the life saviour with $5 subs.,t5dfwPEdTd64lyKf-ivw-g,0,0,4,8udDTkUWG6bbSAImZOAbKA

The two young ladies working there, mother and daughter, were amazing, I just don't think people appreciate how hard it is to make a 2 minute sandwich to the customers preferences while making another customers 2 minute sandwich. Truly great and I will definitely be back to this subway before going to any other.",1pcHzjlKYXo2-jWWRH0XwQ,0,0,5,2KSWTFkTnjlWhIMJlyBbBw
5036305,2012-01-26,0,Gmkfors9fSxUKcJKSX0BRQ,"This review isn't for Subway in general but this location specifically. I have closer Subways to me but this location surpasses them on service. They know me by name now, remember what sandwich I like, and that I am a student at UNLV. All meaningless things, sure, but the fact they took time to remember deserves my business. The employees are always in a good mood and the owner and her family, mainly her daughter, are so friendly. They truly make you feel like part of their extended family. 

As for the food, its made neatly yet it tastes the same as the others. The presentation is definitely better and the restaurant is clean and organized.",Ddl3e0igk2aI_VD4e0gL4g,1,0,5,cT2rs_lMLBQN3L7Jp_Ryzw
5743397,2016-03-29,0,Gmkfors9fSxUKcJKSX0BRQ,This is my favorite Subway. There are others closer but this one is always clean and friendly and always remember me and my sister. You can't see it in the pics- but they have two nice sitting areas so you can eat and chat and not feel rushed.
