I don't know what people are talking about the staff was great I have no issues with them.

The jump itself is awesome standing at the edge of the platform is an amazing feeling. I do agree with some of the people here it's no free fall like sky diving. But if your considering sky diving and don't know if you have the guts try this first you will soon be jumping out of a plane trust me.",WCXUhMH914LjTOI_lUwefQ,2,0,5,t86Ewj0Z2pwYaDq2IyJa3A
57584,2015-04-15,0,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"I would consider myself a bit of an adrenaline junkie. Growing up, I always loved roller coasters and anything to do with  heights. My husband, however, not so much. Okay not at all. When I heard about the Skyjump at the Stratosphere, I knew I had to do it. My husband said maybe, but I figured that was a no. I called in advance and made a reservation for both of us.  We got there about an hour early to check it out before jumping. They have a gated off area outside where you can watch the other jumpers. We watched a few then went to check in  they said we didn't have to wait the hour until our appointment and could go right away. Great! We got geared up, and the employees were very nice and answered all of my husbands ridiculous questions. No- nobody ever died. No- nobody ever got smacked in the face by a bird. I really thought my husband was going to back out. We got to the top and I jumped first. Whoooo what a rush! It's definitely scary jumping out the window of the 108th floor but it was a thrill and over before you know it. It's very controlled. They stop you before you get to the bottom. Theres no flying around back and forth like bungy jumping but rather you are connected to cables on both sides and they slow/stop you. My husband was next and he surprisingly jumped. After it was over he said he had a great time and was glad I talked him into it. 

The jump is a bit pricey but it's worth it. I would recommend.",lVFTHojtpTMYic5XsFTfQw,2,1,5,tYSNO-vIeFLEJXb0tp13ng
68806,2011-06-15,2,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"I recently went skydiving and so after that I was on this adrenaline rush. I immediately thought what else could I do to fulfill my need for excitement and thrill? Then my sister told me about Skyjump, she had recently done it and said it was fun. So I decided to give it a try. You must call and make reservations ahead of time. The lady on the phone was very nice and informative. The price is $99.99 just for the jump, but if you are a local, it's only $80. $80 is definitely not that bad. So I booked my skyjump and on the day of my appointment, I was pretty excited but after skydiving, I thought it'd be a piece of cake. Boy, was I wrong. It's probably just me, because everyone laughs at me when I tell them that I was more scared of doing this than skydiving.

I waited about 15 minutes after my reserved time, but I was ok with it. They harness you up and they weigh you. Then you take a walk to the elevators, they take you up 855 feet up. At this moment, I was still ok, especially because my pride takes over me and I must not act like I'm scared, ever. You wait in line to go into a small glass room... that's where you jump from. You can also see the cable line inside of the room. There were 3 people in front of me and I didn't watch the first person jump but I decided to watch the second person jump. That may have been a bad idea. From down below, it looks like the jump is quite slow, but from watching it right in front of you, it's pretty fast. I was still OK. Then, I decided to walk to the glass and look down. BAD IDEA. The 3 people went and it was my turn. I went into the room and they double checked my harness, took a few pictures and then they escorted me out to the ledge. Oh, it was also quite windy that day so that didn't help my fear. The guy told me to grab onto the rails on both sides and walk to the edge and put my toes off the edge. I looked down, AGAIN, BIG MISTAKE. But, there's no turning back at that point. The guy holds onto a strap on your back and counts you down. He lets go and you kind of just lean forward. The initial drop was terrifying but after that split second, it was fun. It is a pretty fast drop and you get to the bottom in a blink of an eye. My hand was shaking uncontrollably when I got to the bottom but I also had a huge smile on my face at the same time. The view up there is great and the wind blowing, the air, everything was like nothing you'll ever feel. The thrill is fast but I definitely thought it was worth it. I had a great time and if it was cheaper for second timers, I'd definitely do it again.

I recommend this for both tourists and locals looking for a thrill in Vegas.",0vDhTzPuthUI_34EUH6v_Q,4,2,5,njigIUj2-6zgNZ1xOPjL0Q

They walked me through all of my questions patiently and did nothing to incite anything but excitement, which was wonderful. The hardest part is the decision to jump.

179850,2011-10-01,0,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"I decided to do this on my first day in Las Vegas so I didn't have all week to chicken out.  I walked in at 11am on a Monday and was told the next available jump was at 1:15pm.  Not too bad of a wait for a walk in. 

When I returned for my jump, I signed my life away (I shit you not - the waiver releases them from their own negligence and gross negligence), paid, and made friends with the guy in line behind me for moral support.  My husband wanted NOTHING to do with this!!!  

I've read a lot of complaints about the people working here, and it is a bit of a cattle call.  However, Joseph was the one responsible for getting me ready to go and I have nothing but good things to say about him.  He was friendly and chatty, keeping my mind off what I was about to do.  Once he got me into my harness, I was double and triple-checked by other employees.  This is the rule.  Nothing goes unchecked.   

Once up top in the glass room attached to the jumping platform, a safety line was attached.  Then the super friendly people working topside double checked everything again before I was led to the platform.  They turned on the camera that was attached to my wrist, hooked up the main line, gave me a countdown, and I jumped.  Full disclosure.....I had to close my eyes to jump.  There is no way I could have done it after looking down from that platform!  Once I jumped, I opened my eyes and couldn't believe how great it was.  It felt like about five seconds before it was all over, but it was really 17 or 18 seconds to the bottom.  By the time I landed, I wanted to go back up and do it again with my eyes wide open the whole time!

The other complaint I've been reading is about the static video camera with no sound.  I paid for the wristcam DVD which is a few bucks more.  It's strapped to your wrist when you suit up, they turn it on for a quick greeting, and then it's activated again at the top shortly before you jump.  It has full sound and you can direct it wherever you want before you jump and as you fall.  Definitely worth it to prove what you did.  I've made everybody watch mine since I got home!!  Total for the jump and wristcam was about $125.

All in all, I loved it just to prove to myself that I could do it.  Now I feel like I can do anything.  Skydiving is next.",dGoFfJ72EOqJxLzMTWBobA,3,0,4,kdoELE0uOxMJVygy0iDsuA

207315,2011-06-05,1,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"the only other time i will say this to anyone is at their wedding before they say 'I do"": DONT DO IT!

i was expecting this jump to have the same excitement/experience as base jumping.  unfortunately, i had more fun watching the fountain show at bellagio.  this jump is very similar to those rides you see at fairs & other amusement parks; where they hoist you to the top, release you & you swing back & forth for awhile.

this is at the stratosphere hotel in las vegas, so there's always a surplus of adventure-goers who want to experience this ride.  definitely call early to make an appointment (good luck showing up & getting a spot).  once you get there, you put on your suit & watch jumpers ahead of you on a tv screen.  then you are taken upstairs to the actual jump site.  this was the only point in time when i got real nervous; only because when you get out of the elevator, there are hundreds of tourists & spectators watching the jumps & muttering phrases like, ""you gotta pay me to do that"" or ""can we jump drunk?""  jumpers are then led into a tiny room, one by one, where they're given last minute instructions, then led to the 5-foot ledge (or plank) before they take the plunge!

the actually ""fall"" itself lasts what seems like 10seconds; its very quick & controlled.  when you initially jump, you feel like youre going pretty fast, but the cables eventually slow you down as you approach the landing zone.

if you're afraid of heights, but too scared to go skydiving, this is probably good for you.  on the other hand, if you've experienced real freefall out of an airplane, you'll yawn all the way down.  $100+ for the jump/dvd/photos just isn't worth it.

252292,2010-06-24,3,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"If you're an adrenaline junkie, the SkyJump at the Stratosphere Casino and Hotel is one of the great attractions of Las Vegas. Where else can you jump off a building to the ground 855 feet below?

It's not a true freefall like a bungee jump or skydiving, but it's plenty fast, and it's amazing to stand with your toes over the edge of the platform like a pirate about to walk the plank. The circular target far below looks really small, and remains looking small until you're almost at the bottom. 

At the SkyJump store near the bottom of the building, you're asked to use a locker to store any loose items in your pocket or elsewhere (even including a wristwatch). You put on a jumpsuit and are then fitted into a very snug harness. A worker leads you to the elevator and accompanies you to the top, where you wait in a small ""holding pen"" for the jump. When your turn comes, two ""jumpmasters"" check your harness, hook you up to the cable, ask you to step to the edge of the platform, and do a quick countdown to the jump. I was impressed by the conscientiousness of the jumpmasters. After you jump, the feet-first descent is over all too soon, and you end up at a padded landing site just outside the SkyJump store.  Most jumpers remain standing, while a few (including me) fall to their knees on the pad.

Technically, the jump is called a controlled descent or decelerator descent. The jumpmasters attach you to the end of a very long cable, most of which is wound about a large spool. The spool is cleverly constructed with a variable radius -- mostly large, but dwindling to a small radius at one end. As you approach the bottom, the last part of the cable to unwind is on this small section, and that's what slows you down at the last moment. Also, the spool is attached to a fan-like mechanism; the air resistance of this fan limits your top speed to about 40 mph.

The web site refers to a short ""safety lesson"", but I never received that. Fortunately, it didn't seem to matter.

The brightly colored jumpsuit seems unnecessary, but it makes you a mini-celebrity from the time you leave the store to the time you make the jump. There is usually a crowd of onlookers around the SkyJump area on the 108th floor Observation Deck, and they often ask questions as you're waiting your turn. It's also fun to eavesdrop on the comments from onlookers.  (""These people are crazy."" ""My Lord, I'd never do that."")

My only complaint is that $100 is a little steep for such a brief experience. (If you want a DVD or various other souvenirs, the price is somewhat higher.) Of course, the excitement is not just in the jump itself, but the anticipation of the jump as you get ready and as your turn approaches.

Most people jump promptly at the end of the countdown.  Occasionally, a jumper freezes and takes a bit of time before making the plunge.  About one person a day ""chickens out"" altogether. 

There is a weight limit of 275 pounds.  Because this includes your street clothing and the jumpsuit and harness, your body weight shouldn't exceed about 265.  If you're close to the limit, don't indulge in too many all-you-can-eat Vegas buffets before jumping.

The Stratosphere is the tallest building in Las Vegas, and easily visible from most places in the city.  After doing the SkyJump, you'll think about it every time you see the Stratosphere in the distance.  As the plane was taking off this morning, I was looking out at the Stratosphere and thinking, ""Cool -- I jumped off that building last night.""",VSawRuZLeBAKeyIYXBY5xQ,13,5,5,ruyr6b3u3irXrKwFqj3EOg
330224,2011-05-03,1,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"There are already some good descriptions of the experience such as by Lucy Y and Meg B.  As such, I will try not to duplicate a lot of that information. 

Back in the day, I did a bungee jump from a height of 140 feet off a bridge.  Despite the height difference, I would say that I felt more secure here due to the apparatus you are in which seems similar to parachute equipment.  For the bungee jump, I was just tied in by my ankles.  Also, the team here put you through a series of activities and questions before telling you to jump on the count of 3.  It was a natural progression to the end of the ledge and to jumping.   On the bungee experience, the people who strapped me in just talked between themselves and when they were done just told me to go to the edge and jump.  As such, it allowed me too much time to think about the pending fall.  Finally, there is a much longer ride here allowing you to shout that you are King of the World, do some Superman poses, etc. on the way down.

Don't get me wrong.  You are way up there (855 feet) on a ledge with the wind blowing and going against your protective instincts. Just focus on something like a building in the the distance (don't look down) and jump when they tell you to.  Enjoy the ride!",vwUankfKzAwk8sLM_QTEyQ,2,2,4,uyotmhSi4LlOCRZ08y6Fjg

379422,2010-08-21,0,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"I was the only one in my group to even attempt this crazy adventure.  Located very, very north on The Strip, it is somewhat of a pain to get to, though riding any of the buses will get you there.  Though reservations were not necessary, as I just walked up to do it, it is somewhat recommended in order to accommodate certain times.  Luckily for me, there was slot an hour from when I purchased my jump so I walked around The Strat playing the floor while I waited.  Some might not be so lucky.   

One of the very nice things about the process is that the staff allows any fence-sitters to view on the tv, behind the counter, the current jumpers and even allows them to head outside to the landing pad to watch the whole ordeal.  

As I made my way to the jump, the staff checked and double-checked my straps for the jump suit and to ensure I am in the appropriate weight limit.  

The staff went step-by-step the procedure of the jump and eventually leads you out to a platform overlooking The Strat.  Then they let you jump/walk off.  Though many nay sayer would complain of the ""control"" of the jump, it was actually very fun.  The strap and connectors only regulated the landing and allowed free fall for a majority of the way down.  

My only real complaint, and initial point of hesitation, was the price of the jump, but it all turned out to be worth it.  It's definitely something different on The Strip.",rIaFYAT3-lV7f0OSQPRVhw,2,0,4,VxV4kxX2AVxDPLt-PATNsQ

As soon as we walked into the room, the vibes were ugly and none of the employees smiled or greeted us- instead they wore frowns on their faces and seemed too exhausted to work. We were told that it was closed even though people were being checked in and being changed into the suit for the jump. We left and went back a few minutes later, asked a different employee for service and received awful customer service. We paid over 600 dollars and was kept on the side line waiting for our jump. Other customers AFTER us were being taken for the jump before us. After waiting a ridiculous amount of time, we asked for a refund. All the employees rolled their eyes and rudely told us we were unable to get a refund. After discussing how we waited way too long, had others taken for the jump who paid after us and how we were unhappy with their customer service. We ended up being reimbursed for the jump and I am glad we did not go. I feel that the workers would have not secured us safely because they were unhappy with their life at Sky Jump.

I was going here with some of my buddies and ready to kick of my bachelor party weekend by throwing ourselves off of the stratosphere, good idea right? So...we did not make a reservation due to the fact the staff advised us one day prior that it should not be a big deal and they would not be busy...wrong. So after coming back 2 hours later we were ready to go. Got all suited up with jump suit and harness..woooohh!! They then took us to the top floor, platform area. We had watched a couple people jump and were getting amped up! Then...the jump operator came out behind the enclosed area and said ""so it is too windy and we have to close the ride, you guys can wait if you want but we don't know if we will reopen"". So after getting all amped up we were given this bad news. Got taken back down, took off all the gear and got a full refund. Spent a total of 3 hours of our day trying to do the jump and got shot down...

I know weather is not anything they can control, but you might want to check the wind/weather report before going.

I paid the full price at $150 and got the video, picture, free subsequent ride up to the tower observation deck, and option to jump again in the next 24 hours for $60.

I simply stepped off of the platform and felt as though I were free falling the first several seconds.  A friend of mine jumped off and I wish I had thought to do that.  The cables catch you to slow your descent to 35mph and you get to enjoy the view a little before you  land.  The staff teach you ahead of time how to adjust the wrist camera so that you get the view you want of yourself, surrounding Las Vegas, the bull's eye rushing up at you as you land or any combination of those that you have the presence of mind to make happen as you are falling.

The staff warn you ahead of time to catch yourself at the landing by bending your knees.  Unless you have jumped enough to have practiced landing at this speed that  may be a little tough.  My landing was not graceful, but it was all good since I have never jumped from this distance before.  I have been able to bungee jump once at a local place in DFW and found this to be much smoother (although I loved the bungee jump, too!).

I had seen reviews that warned of long wait times between check in and jumping, but that wasn't a problem for me at all.

1194745,2016-08-20,0,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"I booked online a couple days in advance for a 9 pm Friday reservation for around $150 for video. My Uber got to the Stratosphere just after 8:30 pm. I went to the thrill rides check in with my reservation and got my tickets along with directions to go upstairs to the Skyjump store for check in. I checked in around 8:45 pm, you have to find you name on an electronic screen, sign waivers, etc... There were three groups ahead of me so I had to wait about an hour for my jump. Luckily, there's a Pokestop and gym there.

I paid for the video package. They give you a locker key, you empty out your pockets, and put it in the locker and put the key around your neck. They ask you to get into jump suits, ask your shoe size because you take off your shoes and wear jump shoes. They'll do a check and after you have everything on, they'll ask you to get on a scale to weigh you since there's weight restrictions.

Then they strap on the harness and GoPro to your hand. The harness might've been the worst part since it gets cinched so tight. It may affect fertility. If you paid for video, they'll ask if you want to do an intro video. After that, a staff member will lead you and another person or your group outside the shop, down the walkway, and to the right to the elevators for the jump. It's like a walk of shame because you're waddling a little because the harness is so tight and you're wearing a brightly colored jumpsuit. The elevator will take you up and you'll be let into a roped off area at the top with a beautiful view of the city. The guys working the jump are in a soundproof, glass room with the giant device that runs the cables. You'll be outside the door waiting. Beautiful view at night and people will be standing there observing and taking their own pictures.

When you're called in, they'll check your harness and shoes again. They tell you that when you're about to land you tuck in your legs. You'll take photos if you paid for it. They'll give you instructions, strap on the cables. There's one in back, a backup in front. If you paid for photos you'll take another one. 

You stand at the edge with your toes hanging off, holding onto the bars on each side, the guy will count down 3, 2, 1 and you can fall forward or jump. I leapt and about 17 seconds later it was over. The GoPro only captures you from the side angle since it's on your hand so hold your arms out. The view of the city is cool, but while you're falling, you spend most of your time looking at the target on the ground. I didn't know the woman at the bottom was there to tell me to keep my legs in front of me so I tucked them in a little early since I saw I was close to the ground. People will be sitting outside on the ground floor cheering. The person on the ground will unhook you, ask you if there's anything else you want to say to the camera, and turn it off. Then you walk up the short stairs back through the door to where you suited up, take off the suit and shoes, put on your shoes, get your stuff out of the locker, then wait for your video or pictures to be transferred to a USB drive. They also give you a certificate for successful jumps. I heard people who chicken out get a voucher for someone else to jump or something. 

Go early, but evening is better. The night backdrop of the city looks awesome. When I finished my jump there was a huge line out the door. I guess people had drinks before deciding to jump or something. 

The hardest part, and longest, was the wait. The staff was super cool though. Must be tough dealing with so many people, especially when people get cold feet and hold things up. It was an experience. Expensive for the length of time, but I'm glad I paid the extra $30 for the video package so I have the memories and could share it with people. Much easier and safer than skydiving. Probably safer than Bungee jumping, which is also on my list. If you ever wondered what it's like to jump off a building without dying, it's good. I probably wouldn't do it again without a good discount or express line unless supporting a friend.",eZ-ZFsWs-5Nrl69XYS2ksQ,7,1,3,Fci7x4N5aOiqWBJSUlkMdw

1250884,2012-03-14,13,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"My name's Yee Gan and despite a fear of heights, I'm an adrenaline junkie. I love roller coasters and have even done a tandem skydive

So, when I saw that the Stratosphere Tower in Las Vegas had a new extreme experience - the SkyJump, I couldn't resist. It's not cheap at $109 per jump with filming costing extra

They're smart in allowing you to watch from the landing zone on the roof of the main building - you can see the jumpers falling from the 108th floor with their descent being slowed down by 2 zip wires on either side of the jumper. You can also watch their entire descent on a TV monitor inside the shop where you sign in for your jump and buy merchandise.

Although I love my thrills, the thought of jumping from the 108th floor was terrifying and it took me quite a while of watching and finally almost forcing myself to sign up.

After a safety briefing and ride up the tower, you're ready to enter the jump room with the opening to the outside and a jump into oblivion! A few people have got up here and have then been unable to enter the room. I must say that this was the most scary part of the experience as you look down a very long way at what appear to be toy cars.

Then, all too soon, you on the edge of the platform, ready to jump. It definitely takes a lot of bottle to actually step off the platform - that's the hardest bit but the descent was a little disappointing. The wires arrest your descent almost immediately and you don't come anywhere near terminal velocity like on a skydive. The big painted target on the landing area comes up quite quickly though and you're soon on terra firma.

It is a unique experience and adrenaline rush to step off the 108th floor of a building but the descent doesn't quite deliver the same rush and it's the same price as a good show in Vegas, so you have to decide whether it's worth it but it's certainly a unique experience",OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,24,20,4,yJT08PQArs9Ior0h3W-UUQ

1375210,2014-09-09,20,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,""" It's a Bird ... It's a Plane ... It's Superwomen "" Just kidding. It's just me getting ready to drop 108 floors from the Stratosphere tower. 

The Sky Jump had been on my Bucketlist ever since I went Sky diving 21,000 ft. last year. Since this jump was only 855ft. and a controlled descent like Bungee jumping, I thought piece of cake, right? NO, I was so wrong.

There are 3 different packages to chose from:
- $119.00 for the Jump
- $129.00 for the Jump and photos
- $149.00 for the Jump, photos and wristband. All photos uploaded on a USB.

There is a separate admission fee to the tower which is $20.00. The good thing is If your a guest of the hotel, admission fee is waived and they give you a discount for the Jump.

I chose the more expensive package. When Im old and grey, I want to be able to look at videos and photos and remember in my youth that I WAS A BADASS.

After I paid for my package and signed my deathwish, I got suited up. The suit was a cute blue jumper. My friends were too scared to even go up the Stratosphere, so they stayed downstairs in the "" waiting zone "" which is also where you land.

There were three other people doing the jump so we all walked into the elevator together. At this point I wish I had taken a shot or two. Why had I choosen to eat a buffet instead? The ride up the elevator seemed like an eternity. The doors finally opened at the 108th floor. I followed the employee to the jump area. 

Before you walk on the ledge, your taken to a room where your straps are attached to your 
Blue suit. Its all glass so all guest visiting at the Observation deck can see this being done. Guest were taking photos of me probably because only insane people do stuff like sky jump off tall buildings.

I finally walked on the ledge and another employee double checked my straps. He had me turn around and take a photo and then  explained how my wrist camera worked. Once he said the spill, he told me to jump when I was ready.

It was 8pm on Saturday night and here I was standing on a ledge from one of the tallest buiding ever built. I looked down to the Strip and see Trump Towers. From way above Trump Towers looks only a few feet high. When I did my first sky dive, I wasnt too scared but since I had to go off the ledge at my free will, the thought scared me. I put my big girl pants on and .....

Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!
Like the Movie Toy Story said "" Its not falling, its flying with Grace "" 

Before I could take it all in, it was over. I landed on the ground and immediately looked up. The jump was so high which I didnt realize until afterwards. One of the best experiences in my life. Words cant describe it. I loved the thrill. 

Once is good enough for me. Its a must do for all thrill seekers.",rKDLq635fyrmVzg4Gxkafg,38,31,5,ZGrCV5UYDreTmrpkbFR1Uw

VIVIAN WAS SO RUDE. Very unwarranted.

We asked for a simple request to be able to record our friend while she jumped, and she for some reason wasn't able to grasp this concept. She made it seem as though we were being impossible. Why? Beyond me. The woman at the front desk was reasonably understanding.

They dress you in a full light body suit over your clothes. Includes sleeves and covers legs. Then they put on you an extremely tight harness. I think the want it tight so there is no slippage during flight.

Highly recommend going with the package that includes the GoPro video. The camera is attached to your right wrist and is pointed directly at your upper body (face, upper chest).

Experience

Located in the Stratosphere hotel this is a controlled descent from the top of the stratosphere tower (108th floor). Yes, you will be terrified. We did ok until we were standing on the edge with our feet halfway off and they count down 3, 2, 1 jump!   Advice: when they say JUMP just do it. If we hesitated I don't know if we ever would have done it. Just keep telling yourself it's safe and you're attached to tons of cables (which you are). The staff check your harness and cables and then another staff double checks their work. So, it did feel very safe. The first few seconds after you jump is terrifying. It really takes your breath away. After those seconds, though, and you realize all is well you can actually enjoy the ride and the view for the rest of the way down. We did it during the day. The view at night must be awesome. Your decent slows significantly just before landing so you can land gracefully on your feet. 

Cost
The price is $100-$140 depending on whether you do just the jump or if you add a photo or a GoPro video of your jump. If you're a local or have a Stratosphere player's card you save $20 on your package.  You do apparently need (or are recommended to have) a reservation which can be made online or in person at the counter. Tip: we had one local and three visitors but were able to get everyone the local price since the local paid for all the tickets. 

Service
The experience definitely lost points here. Viviana at the check in counter was extremely.. curt to put it mildly.  No smile.  No thank you. Nothing. The other staff on the lower level that suit you up were similar. Not friendly. They seemed to have canned jokes like ""don't worry nobody has died today.""  They write your weight on your wrist before you go up. The staff member told me ""this is just an ID number to identify your body if something goes wrong.""  I guess I appreciate the attempt at humor, but it could go very badly with someone much more nervous than I was. The guy and girl at the top seemed generally nicer, more easy going, and tried hard to put people at ease. Everyone did seem very thorough, though, checking and double checking the harness, lines, safety procedures, etc which is a good thing. 

Mojo
Overall a fun and terrifying experience. We are by no means daredevils, but we managed and felt proud for having done it. That moment standing on the edge before you jump is the scariest, but just keep telling yourself everything is fine and jump when they say jump. It's expensive, but it's the only game in town for this kind of thing. They really need to work on customer service and friendliness, however.",TGSi0e7-ovol_PBIQgodOg,4,1,3,TJPU9rNvDmy0bJoWc-3w3A

2229588,2010-09-20,6,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"Are you willing to jump off of a building 855 feet off the ground? I did. 

And it was fun! I did at night, so the view was spectacular. The ocean of neon spread out below, the wind in your face, the brief feeling of weightlessness- all quite fun and well worth doing. As others have said, the hardest part is actually pushing yourself forward over the edge. Once you begin ""free-fall"", you're really zip-lining almost vertically along the base of the tower. The speed is slightly less than I had imagined, so I was a little disappointed. Still, it's quite an experience. It feels a bit safer than skydiving and it's FUN! The deceleration was a bit rough. 

I do think that at $100 it's a bit expensive- for about $115 you get a photo booklet and a dvd of your jump. It's worth the extra $15, because it's so entertaining to watch yourself falling. It's not a face-shot, but you see your entire body and the city behind you as you fall, so it's still pretty cool. I prefer it this way, actually, because I don't have to see what kind of horrid faces I was making the entire way.

Then one of my friends complained that they missed out on the SkyJump while in Vegas. Cue the little voice - What's the SkyJump? We're going to Vegas soon. Is it fun? Let's do it!

After looking up the SkyJump, I decided I'm crazy and want to do this and convinced my brother to join me. We arrived at The Stratosphere only to see everything but the observation deck was closed due to lightening. A storm was passing close by but would be clear soon so we waited it out. Within about 20 minutes everything was back open.

Since we're jumping off a perfectly good building, we ponied up the $150 to have video evidence that we did the jump. Waiting your turn in the store, you see the live video feed of people jumping. It did nothing to quell my fear.  Then it was our turn.  After adorning a sexy jumpsuit and shoes, the workers tried their best to cut off the circulation to my torso by tightening the harness to the point where it was hard to breathe. 

After being checked, it was time for the elevator ride up. And there we waited while people on the observation deck watched all of us idiots prepare to jump off a building. The girl ahead of me jumped and seeing/hearing the massive safety line spool whir like crazy as she jumped was almost enough to do me in. It was my turn and I knew if I hesitated it wouldn't happen so at the end of the countdown I stepped off. Fear went away pretty much immediately and I loved every moment of the 17 second fall.

The staff were all really awesome. They had a great sense of humor and participated in some joking/heckling of jumpers. They also check the harness twice downstairs and twice upstairs to make sure everything is done properly before the jump.  When I finally watched my video (worth the extra money) I decided it could be a drinking game. If I take a sip every time I said ""terrified"" and a shot each time I said ""Oh my God!""

SKYJUMP LAS VEGAS @ THE STRATOSPHERE
2000 Las Vegas Boulevard South Las Vegas, NV 89104

After a short lesson in safety (not that you care anymore), your loved one is strapped in a harness 108 stories above The Strip and standing on the edge of the tallest building West of someplace I'm not interested in.

A quick kiss.

The words, ""I'm thinking we should see other people"".

A quick shove.

Voila!

You are free!

Best part? The elevators at The Stratosphere are so fast that you can probably wave goodbye from the street below just about the time your freshly ex is hovering over the pavement safely in that harness.

2340035,2012-04-18,0,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"This ride has a descent that feels (and is, of course) too slow to me virtually the whole way down that it is much more relaxing than it is thrilling. It is pretty much a vertical zip line, except personally, I find the horizontal ziplines to feel more thrilling. Do it if you're trying to nudge yourself into bigger, faster thrills and are pretty new to the thrill world.
OR do it if you are an experienced thrill-seeker (who doesn't fool themselves but know that they are actually an EXPERIENCED THRILL-seeker)  who has expectations that this may be much slower than their liking or too tamed but still want to do it for other reasons than a thrill. For me,  I don't think it would be worth even a quarter of what they charged ($109.99) to do a second time... maybe like 15-20 bucks tops. 

I didn't even purchase a wrist camera or photos because I had a huge feeling from experience with other thrill rides that this was going to be more about anticipation, huge reliance on the world-record breaking height for a SkyJump, and hype than actual thrill.  Needless to say, I was right. I don't need to pay the extra money to commemorate something that's not really anything to write home about with high marks. My SO said that I looked like a ragdoll coming down because I was so limp, and there was a reason for that. It was a relaxing experience though and something like a spa treatment for your mind, I guess.

I did the jump several minutes past midnight in late March, so the view was filled with bright orange lights and you could still make out things really well. I enjoyed the cool breeze and being in the cool, mild darkness above lights the most about the ride. 

The staff were great in terms of their service to me; one of the male staff at the top kept striking friendly conversation with me while being thoroughly professional and the girl who suited me up was very attentive to everything. However, I found the Asian male staffer who kept making stupid racist jokes in a rowdy manner among his co-workers and other customers to be so obnoxious that he detracted from the atmosphere. I'm not taking any stars off because of this though.

Oh, and to anyone who reads the review of RIC A., who says that this is ""very similar to those rides you see at fairs & other amusement parks; where they hoise you to the top, release you & you swing back and forth,"" THAT IS A FALSE STATEMENT. He describes some of the major differences already, so I don't why he says it's ""very similiar.""  What he is describing is a skycoaster by the way. 
HERE's THE TRUTH: the SkyJump is a controlled descent that decelerates to a stop, with an ascent that takes place on a fast elevator of the building, and it stops at the end of the vertical controlled fall. A skycoaster is complete free fall (like that of a bungee jump) with large swings back and forth to a stop, and the ascent is when they hoist you [slowly] to the top. As an extra bit, you then have to pull on a rip cord attached to your harness to release yourself into that free fall as opposed to jumping off. They're very, very different rides. 
In fact there's more similarity between base jumping and the SkyJump (which are still quite different) than there is between a skycoaster and the SkyJump.

They could have some better signage inside the store. The ""Jumper Check-In"" sign made us think that was those for returns/reservations and we went to the next register over and the lady said oh no you need to be in that line and by that time 3 people behind us got in line. Oh well - didn't take that long.

I would certainly recommend that if you're going to do this to get the Stratosphere's loyalty card before heading here. With this card - you'll save $20 off your jump. The employees were very friendly and helpful. The employee who helped me get suited up was funny and made some jokes to get you nervous.

When I got out on the platform all you have is to look out and down. I'm a very nervous person and I had no issues - I don't know why! It was such a thrill. They gave me the countdown and just went. Getting unhooked and back inside the building they provided us our thumb drive and certificate. Which I thought was pretty cool too.

We did sky dive in Monterey for her birthday back in 2009, and this year for her birthday she mentioned something called the Stratosphere. She's the kind of friend who likes to do random things, see this, go there, and makes all these plans. Thinking Stratosphere was some kind of ride or possibly some acrobatic event, like a good friend, I said, ""Sure, why not?"" See what happens when you don't have all the facts?

Two months later, I find out it is not the kind of ride I was thinking.
$99.99 and another $15 for a dvd (very grainy) and photograph of you with and the ""instructor"" prior to the jump. Gotta document this event, so why not?

Don't wear any loose clothing, shoes that won't fly out, or dangly jewelry. They will provide a locked to you at no extra cost.

Not really too keen on the employees downstairs. We came at around 11pm for our scheduled 12am jump. We had pushed our time an hour later, and I guess they don't update their records, and didn't even know this. The thin brunette girl behind the register did not seem like she wanted to be there at all because I would either see her grudgingly do something or stare into space. Luckily the blonde Caucasian girl who was suiting me up was super friendly and KNEW (or at least seemed to) what she was doing. I was observing the two other male employees with Dragon Ball Z or ""guido"" hair, and they were slightly better than the other girl staring into space, but just doing the bare minimum. Seems like everyone hates their jobs here. This lack of enthusiasm or even good customer service, worried us.

After we were suited up, we were brought upstairs, by another employee with more exuberance (thank goodness). They offer a package with a shot before the jump, which you take at the bar facing the pit. By the way, not only do you have an audience of people downstairs, you have some at the bar as well.

We felt much better seeing how the instructors upstairs work. You can tell that they take a lot of precautions (two employees mimimum in the pit, and the doors are immediately shut once you enter, as well as you both are always anchored to something) They don't explain much outside of that so there isn't any ""training"" or video you have to watch prior. All you have to do is not chicken out. I wanted to so bad, but my friends wrath is worse than dying. The Hawaiian guy (and his Hawaiian music) did much to reassure me that it would be okay. Make a request to face inwards (rather than the regular outwards), and it will make it a little less scary. Don't worry, you'll still get turned around facing the view as you go down.

A few friends and I decided we were going to do the SkyJump since it was our last night in Vegas. When we walked in, there were three young employees working. Before we could even say anything, they said they were closed because of ""lightning"". 
My friends and I thought this was an honest joke, because the Vegas sky was absolutely beautiful that night. 
My girlfriend was a little bummed out, and asked them what lightning, because the sky was clear. They then rudely answered ""We can't. We are closed.""
We figured it was because we came the last hour and the employees wanted to play around instead of doing what they are paid to do. 
As we were walking out we spotted an information desk and asked if there was anything else we could do close by. Five minutes later the young girl from SkyJump came up to my girlfriend and slammed a dirty used cigarette on the information desk and said ""This is yours."" And rudely walked away.

Thanks to SkyJump Las Vegas mission accomplished. I was hunting the web for things to do in Vegas when I came across this thrilling option. Yep, I'm In! I mean what's the big deal right???

This adventure ride takes place at the Stratosphere Hotel which is all the way on down the strip. It's worth the trip. You can even take the Deuce (the Vegas Strip bus) to get there. Don't even think you are going to walk it's way too far. 

The price to jump is $119 but there is an admission fee to enter the tower and that fee is $20 per adult and $14 for children. There are also unlimited passes or multi ride passes available. These passes don't include SkyJump but they will get you in the tower. 

There is also a discount for guests of the Stratosphere. Free tower admission and only $99 to jump. I opted to stay the remainder of my trip in Vegas at the Stratosphere so I could partake in the joy rides. There is also a photo package available for $129 as well as a Video package which includes a wrist cam. This package, the one I opted for, is $149. I'm not sure if they gave me a discount or not for that.

The ride itself is similar to bungee jumping but without the bounce back. It's more like a free fall or free float all the down. You truly get the ""look at me I'm flying"" experience. The scariest part the whole thing was looking down from the edge of the tower.

It was at that moment I really believed if this were ever going to happen I was going to have to be pushed. In fact I was expecting something of the sort. I thought they would tell me to get ready instead I just heard ""ok GO!"" I was startled to say the least.

You actually have to find your own courage to get this ride started. After a mantra of ""oh, shit. oh, shit."" and some serious stall tactics I finally bit the bullet and took the plunge. From there it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.

You need to remove all jewelry and loose dangly bits and place them in a locker they provide you with. Then irony of all irony they give you the locker key on a chain to hang around your neck. And for whatever reason they tell you to remove your hairpins as well. I didn't but pretended I did. I just put on the replacement hair band they gave and acted as if all was well. The hairpins luckily did not cause my demise. 

The one thing I didn't like about this ride was it was over so quickly. Too quickly. But yep I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Next time though I'd do it night. I'd love to see the night skyline and lights on the way down.",hL7P5o46JKPbDm9O6hw9Ng,14,15,5,GgjFqoosz4FMBUBKlsloUQ

My only complaint is the price.  They push the $150 package that includes still photos and a video from a GoPro strapped to your wrist.  The video is pretty cool, but the still photos are only those taken right before you jump. All this is then delivered to you on a flash drive. For that price, i think they should give you the option of going through the video and finding some stills that could be saved as pictures.

Just remember you are risking your life or an injury that could mess up your back, pelvis, and who knows what else. Unfortunately, it happened to me. I always try and warn anyone that I know is planning on doing it or wants to. Whoever was in control of my cord (""free fall"") was not paying attention or didn't calculate the fall because I had a hard landing and landed on one leg. Your fall is supposed to be light and graceful-like. 

I was running marathons and had to quit running for over three years because my back and pelvis were so out of whack. I had to deal with numbness and tingling in my hands and feet for over 8 months not knowing what the heck was going on or if I was going to get better. The worst part of course was being in pain no matter how I would sit or standed. 

It's a good thing I wasn't working at the time because I was on paid meds daily (that just made me sick and loopy). So, when you go there to sign their contract, you are basically signing your life away. Their contract basically says you can't sue for any reason and even death is not their fault. 

Again, if you want to risk your life/body, go for it. I use to be an adrenaline junky, but after this incident, I basically play it safe with everything. It's no fun being in pain for a few yearss and wasting most of your time and money on an injury that could have been prevented.

I was lucky enough to experience this at night.... I would recommend the same for you, too. 

I do need to stress that when I arrived with the friends who were going to do it, I thought it was more of a bungee jump. It is absolutely a controlled fall. I don't want to discredit the experience, though.. because you are still STEPPING OFF THE EDGE  AT 108 STORYS IN THE AIR...for all the people that are poo-pooing the experience.. if you would have read any reviews, watched someone do it ahead of you, gone to the website, watched a youtube video, etc... you would have seen that it is a controlled fall.

Everything else was awesome. Standing on the edge of that platform right before jumping is exhilarating and then you jump or step off or throw yourself off and you fly!

I opted in for the photo and video package, which ran me around $150 including the jump. The staff at both the ""base"" and the top of the tower were great. I felt secure with my harness, as they checked it three times at the bottom and twice again at the top. Their extra precaution put me at ease when I was about to go jump off the side of the building. 

The jump was great, amazing views, and so thrilling. I've been sky diving before so I wasn't that scared, more nervous about having to make the jump off, as they will not push you off like with sky diving. No kinks whatsoever and was done in less than an hour by the time I paid, got suited up, was brought up to the top of the tower and had two others jump before me. I would definitely do that junk again.

After I jumped I waited around 15 minutes for my video on my flash drive and headed back to the hotel. Unfortunately no one on my trip brought a laptop with them so I was unable to access my videos or photos until I returned home a week later. Only to find my pictures were not on the flash drive, they were of some random woman. The pictures were at night when I clearly jumped in the middle of the afternoon, I'm not sure if the staff even looked at them before placing them on my drive.

I called on 11/1 when I returned home and gave all my information and was told that someone would send them to me the next day. Never received them. Called again and was told a manager has to look them up and she'll be in later on that day. Never received them. Called 5 days later and spoke with Carla who promised as soon as her manager was in at 5pm she would make sure she would look them up and send them out. Never got them. Today I finally spoke with a manager and she said that ""It takes a while to look them up since we already backed up the drives. You know we have to plug them in and it takes time"" ??????!!!! What. I've given them almost the exact time that I jumped. It shouldn't be that hard to pull up a file and look at the time stamps. Especially now that it's been FIVE days since I originally called.

Manager claims I'll have them tomorrow. I really doubt it. If you lost my pictures, just tell me rather than keep giving me the run around. It might just be pure laziness that no one wants to plug in a damn hard drive and look for some pictures.

Before leaving our hotel we had called skyjump to ask about clothing and shoes because I was trying to juggle the 110 degree weather, formal dining and adrenaline sports into a single but awesome outfit.  The nice lady was very helpful and ended the phone call with ""see you soon!"" and we joyfully skip off to the Stratosphere for what should be an epic evening of awesome food and falling.  (BTW you get a jump suit and can be given booties if you wear something unpractical like flip flops so really... dress formal and for the heat and then cover in a jump suit)

Rumor has it,   when skyjump first opened, jumpers were scaring the bajesus out of Top of the World dinners... resulting in stained shirts, broken dishes and some angry folks.   So TOTW started to explain to dinners what was happening in the elevator up.  Unfortunately on the way up the elevator guy tells us skyjump is closed due to weather and we won't get to see the jumpers.  I'm disappointed but assume it must be recent and maybe it would open up again later - we just talked to a skyjump lady after all.   30 ... 40 minutes pass and we still haven't got our cancellation call from skyjump. 

Eventually we go down there to figure out what's going on... it's been closed all day and they ""haven't gotten around to calling people in our time block yet"" ... our time block was 30 minutes away by this point!    First off,  do they not understand we had come from quite far down the strip to make it there for this?  There is almost NOTHING else to do out there - so people are going to be upset for the wasted taxi we'd sure have already sat down in to make it there if we weren't already there for dinner.   Why didn't the girl I talked to tell me ""we've had high winds and have been closed - I'm not sure your jump will go ahead"" when I talked to her shortly before?   

I find it really interesting that we NEVER got a cancellation call from them even though we never gave them our names as we walked up and got a bit upset with them.   Benefit of the doubt they assumed who we were and left us off the list of calls but maybe they just didn't call ANYONE and were making everyone come up there for nothing.   

Lesson to anyone who wants to take the leap....  1. Make reservations in advance and 2. call them before you make the trek out there to see if they are running (it's really far away from most of the strip).",5dBKAgQE7F7CF-N6qRDkEQ,10,0,2,K0DGLDJvUPY54zgJ-8liHw

I made my appointment for 9:30 PM, so I would have an amazing view while plummeting rapidly to the earth. I got to the stratosphere around 9, and had plenty of time to get checked in and put on my jumpsuit. I was BEYOND nervous.

Although, the staff was very lighthearted and told me that I'd be fine. They were TOTALLY patient with me and really helped my nerves. 

I ended up finally mustering up the strength to jump, and just went for it! And WOW am I glad that I did! The experience was unlike anything else I've ever done! That feeling of total weightlessness and just falling was SO COOL. Plus, the view alone made it all worth it. I could see hundreds, if not thousands, of miles of lights and scenery. It was beautiful to put it lightly. The brakes kick in RIGHT at the end, which is a bit scary.

The first thing I can say for Skyjump is it certainly felt safe. My harness was adjusted by attentive employees at least three times. These guys are serious about how they do this and it really shows. So if you're worried about actually falling to your death, allow me to comfort you on this aspect.

The view and the jump experience certainly is motivating. For the first few seconds it definitely feels like freefall. Even once the ropes start to slow you it's still pretty damn exciting: however, the least exciting part of it is how much the harness pulls you by the groin. Not pleasant, and could have been avoided with a different harness, but it's not awful.

Recommended for thrill seekers with a decent amount of money to blow, $110 bucks for a 10 minute experience and a 1 minute jump is not a great value.  You will also have something to talk about if you ever run into Ronnie from the Jersey Shore, because apparently he did this too (they have pictures) but when is that going to happen.

I called to make a reservation weeks ahead and paid the $99.99 necessary to keep your spot.  They told me I could get a package including a dvd and photo for only $30 extra.  I didn't want to pay for it ahead of time but they said it was fine to decide when I got there.

In the weeks before our jump, I watched a couple of YouTube videos of people's jumps, shot by friends watching from the ground, and thought eh - it looks like such a slow fall...and seriously considered canceling.  

It just didn't look scary enough!

Joining in with my friends won out though, and when we arrived a half hour before our appointment times, I was glad I hadn't canceled.  But I still wasn't super excited about the jump itself.

They checked us in and told us we could watch our dvds and see our pictures after our jump and decide whether we wanted to buy them then.  Which we thought was super cool!

They had us put our stuff in a locker then suited and harnessed us up and took us up the elevator to the top of the tower.  

When we got off the elevator, this huge view of Vegas from panoramic-view windows 855 feet off the ground (108 floors up), started to get me excited...because it finally DID feel scary!

We waited our turns from right inside a door that was next to the jumping platform.  Watching from that close looked even SCARIER - and now my legs felt a little wobbly and I got giddy!

I went first - they checked my harness, took a couple of pics, pointed out the camera, and had me stand at the edge for a count of 3.

And then I jumped!!!!!

It was faster falling than I thought, windy, my hair was blowing all over the place, and the whole city leaped up at me!!  

Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

I landed softly on my feet about 10-15 seconds later, and got out of my suit and harness fast enough to be ready to take pics of my friends coming down.  

Woooohoooo!!!  The rush lasted a while for me, and I talked and joked with the people watching around the landing platform.  It was a super fun place to be - and there were even lounge chaises for people to lie on and watch the jumpers.

Yaaaaay!!!!  Fuuuuuuun!!!!!!

We were checking out and watching our videos when we had a little damper on the funzies.  They told us that the dvd would be $27.03 and the pics would be $21.61.

What happened to the package deal? - we asked.  They said ""oh, you can't upgrade *after* you jump"".

We had never been told that, so there was some grumbling about it.  Even though we were about to pay the higher fee, Kim was nice enough to let us upgrade to the $30 dvd+photo package.  And then she even corrected the spelling of my friend's name on her jump certificate without her asking - which we thought was super nice.

You have to walk around a bit of the Stratosphere mall on the second floor to find the SkyJump office. Just follow any other tourists that look confused at the top of the escalators.

Once there, you'll pay, sign waivers and get geared up in fashionable jump suits, booties and if you wear glasses, a stylin' strap to keep them on your head should they slip off mid-fall.

After the elevator ride to the observatory, you'll be lead one at a time to the jump area where you'll get two re-assuring safety checks on your equipment, strapped in, and take your leap off faith.

Being someone who is not a fan of heights, that first step off the edge was mildly terrifying, but after a second you feel pretty secure and you're just falling straight down. Close to the ground, the breaking system kicks in and you land with ease on your feet. I highly suggest spending the extra cash to get the video package so that you can record your reaction and the quickly approaching ground. Or bring your own GoPro I guess.

It was okay--just not worth the $125+ that I paid to do it, although the extra cost was because I opted to carry a hand-held camcorder on my jump. (I don't recommend it, it was kind of distracting to hold it.) 

The jump suit was a little snug in an awkward area, but other than that, it was fine. You are attached to your wire in a glassed room where you can see the other people cheering you on, then you step out onto the platform. The wind is a little nuts at the top of the Tower, so be careful as you step out (don't want to fall haha!) 

Normally, I try to do a wacky jump doing bungee and the like, but the camcorder made that difficult. I stepped off the platform and whizzed down. The best part is always the initial sensation of jumping into nothingness! 

The wire slows you down and you get to land upright on your feet. So feel free to do some air-ballet on your final few feet of descent. Your friends waiting in the spectator section at the bottom will appreciate it.

1.  It is extremely expensive.  Regular price is $125.    For a few dollars more you can skydive in Jean or Boulder City and have more fun.  They do have a local rate of $99, but you have to ask for it before you pay.  The good part of the locals rate was that my out of town friends were able to get the local rate with my ID since we all jumped together.

2. If you have ever skydived or bungeed, which I have on several occasions, this will be a huge let down.  The guidelines you are attached to really slow down your decent and it feels like you are falling down through molasses.  If you have never jumped out of a plane or bungeed, you would probably enjoy it more.

3. We jumped during the day and the view is seriously lacking.  I wish we would have done it at night when the lights were on.  Day time jumps are boring.

So if you have never jumped from a high spot before, go try it out.  If you have jumped before, be warned.

They don't pressure you to do anything you don't really want to do.  And when the time comes, they count you down and you jump.  It was a thrilling experience.  I was shaking for several minutes afterwards from the adrenaline.  I loved almost all of it.  All but the landing.  Like an idiot I locked my legs instead of absorbing the impact by bending my knees.  This sent a painful shock up my back.  I ached for about an hour.  If you go, bend your knees.  That is my biggest advice to you.  Oh, and opt for the HD DVD.  It is worth it to hear the experience time and time again.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,5,3,4,atF7iZOGBMk28iXRlUwzQw

My friend suggested this adventure, said it would help her face her fear of heights?
in any case, as I said, there is no depth to the levels of stupidity a guy will follow just for the approval of a beautiful woman :-) wish I had a pic of her in the jumpsuit we bought for the occasion....would have any guy jumping off a building for her!

we booked a session at midnight, and it was surprisingly busy at that time
I think the views with the city lit up are best, so would recommend a night jump vs day jump
even though we had an appointment, the wait kind of s_cked, not a whole lot to do there other than watch some of the other yayhoos attempt the jump!....plus our cell phones were just about dead so we couldn't even take pre-jump pics.....boo

in any case, when we were called, they prepped us in their harness jumpsuits and shoes, put us on scale to weigh for body bag later...haha
quite a number of safety checks on ground and then the long elevator ride up....

they have a separate jump preparation area that they do another couple sets of safety checks in....better safe than sorry right?....and then you are tethered to a control and safety line

once that is done, you take walk of death out to platform to take a header off the building!
It was actually pretty nice up there and knowing you were tethered took a lot of the fear out of the adventure. I will never tire of the vegas strip at night....simply beautiful.  they give you the ok, and then you are left to take the plunge on your own....no pushing!

not really a lot you can do once you've left the relative safety of the platform other than to enjoy the view on the way down. I don't think it takes you more than 15-20 seconds at most to reach bottom, so try to enjoy the short ride down!

In any case, we opted for the camera package which allows you to film yourself and the view with a wrist cam on the way down.  Got a 20% locals discount too....nice!

pretty fun experience, I really enjoyed it, wish it would last a bit longer, but then again then the drop would be too controlled to get thrill from right?

 855ft fall. 
Definitely been waiting to cross that off the bucket list! Scariest part is the 2nd half of the first step when your center of gravity is over the edge commiting yourself and your still not sure what to expect.

This drop is biggest if it's kind in the world and is custom. It is really over the top and out of this world. When I was younger I remember I was scared to be on it. A lot of people won't go near the glass inside still! I've always been amazed with it.
Now imagine looking over the edge (don't fall yet, they are still connecting everything!) to the ground and trying to make out people walking. Its massive. Cars look like rice, and the column of the tower viewed from the top instead of below, looks gigantic. It looks as if you might hit it since it curves out a bit, but those cars are directly under you too. You know you have to physically jump off in just a moment rather than just imagining it. 
 It's like wow! I've actually dreamed and wondered what it'd be like to jump off it every time I've been there, ever since I was a teen. I was completely amazed I can now do it! The decision to jump off and actually experience it was made the first time I went up there as a teen. Just give me a chance!
It's fast, but slower than terminal velocity, inwhich wouldn't allow you too fully take it in the experience or shift your weight much or comprehend the feeling that you could imagine if you jumped off it. It was really a treat, and I hope will always have dreams of the Las Vegas night lights getting bigger and bigger as you not quite fly through the warm air in slowed motion with a rush of Wow running through your body.

Since I tend to get bored on roller coasters, this is one way to get a thrill. Just awesome. When you're up there, your like WTF was I thinking. Hearing stories of people freezing up doesn't help either. You also sign your life away with a waiver!

This is actually a controlled descent with a cable guiding you down, not a true bungee jumping or skydiving experience, but should give you a taste of it.

Price is $100 per jump, $50 for  re-jump. $115 for Jump + DVD. $130 for Jump + DVD + Photo. $131 for Jump + DVD + T-Shirt. The photo is shot at the bottom and top, not while you're falling. Disappointing. You need to make reservations because they appear to always be booked. The DVD includes a video of you being strapped on the top all the way to the bottom as you fall. Worth it just for memories. Just don't expect great quality on the video.

Its one of those things you do in life that you just do it for the sake of doing. Do it while your stupid and young! Worth $100? Maybe.

I did the sky jump back in May when I was out in Vegas for the first time. I'm on this kick to do crazy things before I turn 30 next year. I made the reservation ( which I reccomend you do ahead of time) for our first day there so I could get it out of the way and not let the drinking I planned on doing affect my jump!  

For me, it was worth the $115 hands down. The worst part of the entire experience is waiting to jump. After they strap you into your jumpsuit downstairs, you take the elevator up and wait in line to go.  The guys who strapped you in before you jumped were amazing- they calmed my nerves and were supper friendly ( and I must say, not bad to look at either:)).  Holding onto the rails before I jumped was the most terifying experience of my life!  Once they told me to go, it was unbelievble. The rush of the air hitting your face, I felt like I was flying. I didn't want it to end. Unfortunately, all that and in 15 seconds you're at the bottom. All of my girlfriends were enjoying their happy hour drinks and cheering me on, it was a great feeling.   Now I'm ready for the next step- Sky diving!

A few quick thoughts:

Don't forget to bend your legs landing- I was so excited to see my friends, I wasn't paying attention and crashed into the ground- nothing I couldn't handle but I did end up with a shiner on my knee and some joint pain. Probably didn't help wearing heels the entire trip either.

The video isn't really anything spectacular, it doesn't have sound- still worth it to see yourself jumping an to show all of your friends, I wish they would take pictures of you in the air instead of just before the jump.

Make a reservation beforehand- otherwise you'll only be relying on someone to chicken out.

I was able to sign up for a same-day jump on a Tuesday morning for a jump in early afternoon.  I showed up, signed my life away, paid for my package (definitely get the wristcam video!), and was quickly suited, harnessed, and weighed prior to my elevator ride to the top.  Once above, I was weighed again, attached to the various cables by a staff of two people that checked and double-checked everything.  They gave me some very basic instructions about putting my feet halfway off the edge of the platform, where to put my hands, and then ""3...2...1...here comes Sara...""

I jumped right away, but they told me they allow people to take as long as they need.  The descent is not a true free-fall, but more of a rapid glide, and I would estimate ~7 seconds to get to the landing area.  They slow you close to the bottom, and the landing was pretty smooth.  I was unclipped, unsuited and walked away as the bad-ass envy of my less bold traveling companions.

If you are in Vegas and at all curious about this experience, go for it!  I think the most ringing endorsement I can give is that I went back that night and jumped again (only $50 for the second jump on the same day).

The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that, for the price you pay them, the staff could be a little more engaging with the customers.

I think that they're trained to make conversation with you to get your mind off the jump! I was checked several times by different employees. I am soooooo relieved that ""safety was first"" with this crew!
You can store your belongings in a locker. Make sure you wear tennis shoes and take off all loose jewelry, watches, etc. They send you to use the restroom before you get suited-up. At the store, there are big screens where you can watch the other jumpers in front of you, on a live-feed. There was even a tiny 14 year old girl who went before me. Its also pretty cool because they announce your name as you jump!
The scariest part was standing on the blue ledge and looking down. The staff gave me all of these instructions, but I got into my own ""hypnotized zone"" that its hard to hear or focus on what they were telling me! They count 1-2-3 and then you can jump off. I went right away, with no hesitation, because I was scared I would change my mind! The first step off the ledge was definitely the hardest to do! Then you free-fall for a couple seconds...I think that's when I held my breath and froze! But afterwards, the wires catch you and you are on a ""controlled-fall"". At this point, you can enjoy the scenery and smile/scream at the ""wrist-cam""! Keep your legs down and ready to land. The landing is actually pretty slow and not bad at all! There's a bulls-eye target at the bottom that is soft and cushiony. 
People can sit on chaise lounges at the bottom and watch the jumpers. Its a pretty great feeling to accomplish the jump and get to the bottom! It was such an adrenaline rush, that I don't even remember walking back up to the store! It takes about 15 minutes for them to get your DVD/photos ready.
I purchased the package #2 for $124, which included the jump and the ""wrist-cam"" dvd. My husband purchased package #4 for $140, which included the jump, the dvd, and a t-shirt.
The other reviewers are correct in comparing it to just a ""vertical zipline"". It was very fun and not as scary as it looks! But it felt very cool to get to do it!",GdBv_-KkdTtgLL3BC0wLBw,1,0,4,jHBuaJTphqqlKkOL1gR5Bg

I gotta be really honest and say it is gonna be REALLY HARD to beat this trip and jump.  This is a ZIP LINE guys not a bungee...it is a controlled stop and you land ON YOUR FEET...unless of course you have noodle knees from the endorphins!!  The only thing that would have made this better is if they were playing LOUD music and you had a soundtrack!!!  SO WORTH THE MONEY and WORTH DOING TWICE!!!!  I recommend a night jump only because Las Vegas is so breathtaking at night and honestly a day jump is a LOT scarier!  You can see a whole lot more and it makes it a little more difficult to walk the plank!!!!  DO IT DO IT DO ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!  You won't regret it!!!  Last thing I'll say...they've done over 106k jumps with no accidents and a sister company in another country has done this for over 25 years with no problems....IT IS REALLY SAFE!  They do at least 6 safety checks and are a class act.  You are probably risking your life at a much higher rate just driving down the strip!",kdiaj_3wCZnourVz3b27Jg,4,1,5,xGMZs82JoMOeE7aEQkE-_Q

The staff in the office on the ground were very distracted by each other and did not look like they wanted to work there AT ALL. I got suited up and taken up to the 108th floor where the happier staff are. Two people on that floor did multiple checks and I was out on the ledge ready to jump. 

I got the video+photo package - the video is shot with a gopro hero 3+ so it's perfect but the photos are practically useless. 

4 stars only because of the staff and the 'photos' you pay for (they're really just you BEFORE the jump). I enjoyed it and would recommend that you do it when in Vegas. 

I didn't get any sort of adrenaline rush but it was still a lot of fun. I won't remember what it felt like but i'll remember that I jumped 855 ft at 42 mph.",kAhwHTrJit84tOZM0pFT6g,0,0,4,1wvqo3bcAEkTEA2pvYYGpA

5438183,2014-03-03,1,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"I just did the Sky Jump over the weekend for my birthday and it was everything I expected it to be!  Due to bad weather the previous day resulting in closure of the Sky Jump, there were a lot of walk-ins and re-scheduled appointments, so be smart and make an appointment in advance. Since I had big birthday plans that night, I had very limited time. After speaking with several employees (multiple times), I finally pushed my way into a 6pm time slot vs. two other options, 7:45pm and midnight. I thought it was cool of them to find a way to squeeze me in and more importantly, make me feel safe. I'm extremely afraid of heights but this is something I really wanted to conquer in hopes of building my way up to sky diving. They checked the harness 3 times and did numerous checks after hooking me up to the cable. In addition, almost all of the employees have done the jump many times and talk to you about it, which is a big relief too. If you're scared to do something like this but want to, I would highly recommend starting with the Sky Jump! In my case, there were other nervous people at the top waiting in line that I could relate with before leaping off the platform! It's a tad bit expensive, but an experience I'll never forget. 

Recommendation: My friends and family said it would be nice to have heat lamps outside for people watching the jumpers. I guess they were pretty cold while they were waiting for me!",qlsKM-OkBjJG7CTMC7-g9g,3,2,5,bqtSNwoq02Gtz_z_ePIM7g

I watched 4 people in front of me move to the edge of the highest building west of the Mississippi. 1149 feet I believe and around 860 from our level. Anyway, so there they were jumping one by one and then my name came up. They opened the door with the wind rushing against my face. The anticipation had me shaking as they were hooking up my harness.

5711196,2014-06-18,3,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"For months I contemplated doing this jump and more often than not I would back out.  In my mind I would commit, then I would chicken out, then I would commit, then chicken out again.  It was absurd!  It got to the point where I was having nightmares about it.  Getting on the ledge and freezing.  Falling off the ledge.  Peeing my pants on the way down.  The nightmares became more and more frequent.  The remedy?  Face my fears.

I made an appointment for the jump (highly recommend); however, my appointment was cancelled due to high winds.  Did I want to come back the next day?  Should I walk away acknowledging that this was a supreme being telling me not to do it?  What to do?!  

I ended up going back the following day and don't regret it at all!  I opted for the jump with pictures and video for a total of $149.99.  The cost is $129.99 for the jump and pictures and $119.99 for just the jump.

The worst part?  Ground level.  Thinking about doing it.  Committing to it.  Waiting to go up.  Second worst part?  Riding up in the elevator to marker 855ft; it's a really long way up, giving you lots of time to reflect on your life.  The third worst part?  Gawkers on the observation deck calling you crazy.   The best part?  Getting to the ledge, no fear, no hesitation, no anxiety, enjoying the view, and letting go.

This is something you MUST do while in Vegas.  I have to admit that the actual falling is not scary, it's not like bungee jumping at all.   You are attached to a deceleration cable and max speed is 40 mph.  I didn't get that heart in the pit of my stomach feeling, which is a bummer.",FvxgtHlYOS4Q_22omnk0OQ,7,4,4,BYFUzctIk-E9dh1PSyKdlA
5733390,2014-08-27,1,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"I had a truly terrible, painful, and humiliating experience at SkyJump Las Vegas on 08/23/2014 (1:45pm-2pm). One exceptionally rude ""jumpmaster"" absolutely ruined my whole day of vacation. Never ever coming back.
I TRULY HOPE MANAGEMENT NOTICES THIS REVIEW AND TAKES ACTION TO PREVENT ANY SUCH CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IN THE FUTURE.
------
I arrived in my very best vacation mood! One of the friendlier front desk guys puts a harness on me, making sure it's super tight (for safety). He quite overtightens my shoulders, but readily readjusts the harness at my request.

I get to the jumping room, there are 2 ""jumpmasters"". The first ""jumpmaster"" cheerfully welcomes me (2nd one remains cold), then pulls all harness straps very hard (as if they aren't tight enough already!), till it almost hurts (for safety, yes, I get it, but I can barely take it at this point).

The 2nd ""jumpmaster"" (spanish-looking skinny young dude, wears a baseball hat, stands behind @Veronica S. in her picture) takes over to double-check everything, and - you guessed it - starts yanking all the harness straps very hard. When he's done, I feel pain in my crotch and my legs, and can't move, so I tell him it's extremely uncomfortable ""down there"", politely asking him if he could please relax it there just a bit. He gives me a really cold stare and says ""NO"". Well, it really hurts, so I patiently explain this to him, and ask him again to readjust it, poking the side buckles with 1 finger each, which makes them move a tiny bit, and my balls finally stop hurting.

This guy snaps and starts yelling: ""Stop touching the harness!""
  ""All right, all right, sorry, I'm not going to touch the harness"" - I raise my hands in the air, giving up.
""I told you not to touch the harness, and you still touched it! I can cancel you right now!"" - he keeps on yelling.
  ""Nooo, wait a second, you told me not to touch the harness only AFTER I touched it, not BEFORE I touched it. So I didn't know... Please re-inspect and confirm it's safe.""  I look in the direction of the friendlier guy for help, but, sadly, not getting any. 

Long silence.

""DO YOU WANT TO JUMP OR NOT?!?!""
I turn back and see a tilted red face of an angry bully staring right at me, a couple of inches away. I actually feel danger for the first time (forget the jump, it's not that scary). I surrender with ""Sure, I want to jump"".

Long pause of silence.

""Turn around, NOW!"" - finally says the bully.
I turn around. Next thing I know is the bully takes the harness off me! ""That's it, you're DONE! It's a liability and safety violation"". When I start mumbling that it's actually unsafe when my balls hurt, and ""please put my harness back on"", he angrily says ""Nothing you say right now will change anything. You're DONE!""  

We stand there in painful silence forever, till a girl from the front desk comes over to escort me back.

This guy completely misses the point why he's there - he's actually there to =HELP= people like me have =FUN= safely (I got no help and no fun, and it hurt so it wasn't safe). The harness must be very snug, but if it hurts someone's testicles while standing, it's definitely a safety violation. Could he act politely and professionally? Was there another, customer-friendly solution to this situation?..

When I get downstairs, everyone giggles and looks at me weird. It was actually publicly announced via speakers that I ""chickened out"", adding insult to injury. I've done 2 parachute jumps in my life, so my wife was the only one who knew something else was going on.

I was offered to reschedule - but who would want to return after such wonderful experience. I decided I couldn't waste any more of our valuable vacation time on this place, and skipped the idea of talking to management.

My mood was ruined, my vacation was ruined, all because of 1 SkyJump representative. ""The chain is as strong as its weakest link""...

PS. I watched the ""jump"" - they immediately slow you down, then give you some speed, but it's a semi-interesting controlled descend. Good for inexperienced thrill seekers, but I'm super glad I'll be taking my money to a skydiving facility instead this weekend.",fCld44YQ32ZOC80rYjmH9w,5,0,1,RIFQ2tPuru91-bQXuDxy8g

Thought about it.

Did it. 

Loved it.

I laughed at myself on the video time and time again.

I showed said video to friends -- they laughed. They still think i'm crazy.

Truth be told, this is some of the best customer service i've had in awhile. Any hesitations I had were quickly set aside with the humor and kindness the staff showed. We even had a small glitch with pricing as I was initially charged the wrong amount. It was quickly taken care of and everyone was all smiles the entire time.

I scheduled a time in person at the main counter. You aren't charged to hold the reservation - just when you check in to to jump. I waited around for a bit for some friends to arrive and chatted with Alexa (sp?). She was adorable and her demeanor and candid personality set me at ease. I was lucky that she was the one who took me up to jump. Everyone I encountered from checking in to paying to getting harnessed into the world most unflattering jumpsuit to the jump itself were amazing.

I think I would have been more scared to jump had the personalities and customer service of the staff been sub par. They set me at ease and made me feel safe.

It was a great experience and I would go back and do it again on my next visit. I'm defiantly glad I did it at night though because I cannot imagine how hot it would have been in that suit and in the little cage/room area at the top level where you jump. 

Avoid the heat and do it at night. Besides, the lights make the jump a whole lot easier to stomach!",_ntA5HPDzqBgwg7S3s7w7Q,3,1,5,xK5tCUQcAA_Qlu74jEwtEg
5890691,2011-07-25,7,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"Ended up staying at the Stratosphere, and at first glance these jumpers looked quite insane. When you're on the ground, the jump platform looks like a tiny rectangle ridiculously high up in the air. The people are barely visible when they first jump. 

After watching them both outside and on the TV all weekend, I figured what the hell, what's a 855 foot jump off the 108th floor, right? So I went and paid my fee and suited up. Everyone was very professional through the whole process and my harness was checked several times by multiple different people. Really the scariest part of the whole thing I think is waiting up at the top, in line to enter the glass fishbowl room that is connected to the jump platform. A number of the people at the bar are asking if you're scared while others are just kind of shaking their heads as if to say ""yikes"".

Like the other reviews already said, they walk you to the edge and make you put your toes over the ledge and grab the rails after they hook you up. You really notice the hot wind blowing around standing there (for what feels like an eternity). I was then asked to lean forward a bit which was easy because the line you are connected to has some tension on it pulling you out (the staff will help hold you in place). This is followed by a super-fast 321 countdown and they let go, and then you let go.

A split second after you release, there is a ""oh sh*t, what did I just do"" moment. Not that it matters because you're pretty much committed at that point. After that initial moment, its smooth sailing all the way down, and over way too fast. The touchdown pad is very soft and springy.

I did a 1am jump, and the skyline with the hot summer breeze was really nice. Next time I may try it during the day. I would say overall I am not terrified of heights but Im not really excited about them either. It's much easier if you don't look down when you are on the platform, just look at the strip and when they count down don't think, just do.

If you're from out of town think of it this way - when the hell are you ever going to have a chance to do something like this again? You get a really nice adrenaline rush and its very exciting, especially if you have never done something like this before. 

Would I recommend this to others: absolutely!
Would I do this ride again: You bet!
Will I buy any extras besides the jump next time: naw",69O9xevE9z43GG_uGCjH8w,13,8,5,JbcaPbEsXyd04AdtxwBeuA
5920607,2010-08-03,0,4khsN1eXcWR0YYmROlLEzw,"Some people go to Vegas for the sin, others go for the food, and for my first visit out there I opted for straight up adrenaline!!

I've pretty much been all over the country on the best rollercoasters and attractions.  The rides on top of the Stratosphere tower have always had a bit of mystery and allure to them because of the height and view .     When I stumbled across this new addition to the tower I knew I had to at least give it serious consideration.   I am after all the guy who wont walk up and talk to a cute girl I don't know but  I can somehow muster up the courage to step off a 3 ft. ledge nearly 900 feet high in the sky!!  

Almost 85 percent of the $100 dollars you pay for this thrill happens completely in your mind.    From the moment you arrive at the Stratosphere the attraction is viewable in front of the tower and all the way down the South view of the strip.    The ultra high tower taunts you as you squint up barely making out the confetti sized blue deck you step off from almost 900 feet high in the sky.    If you wait around long enough you can watch other jumpers make the descent a few times and talk yourself in and out of doing the attraction.

Earlier in the day I took the ride up the Paris Hotel Eiffel tower to its observation deck which is a mere 500 feet high.    Knowing I was heading toward the Sky Jump freaked me out when I realized that was nearly 400 feet higher.   Damn at 500 feet those cars look like giant army ants.  What's the view going to be like when my toes are hanging over the edge and the only way to the ground is down?

Whats an extra 300-400 feet?    :  )

Eventually my scheduled time for mental torture came and it was time to suit up.   The suit up space is located just inside of where actual jumpers finish their descent and land/  While you are psyching yourself up for the jump you are at least slightly relieved to see that everyone comes back alive and with a big grin on their face.    I had my friend who was a photographer document the whole experience and I was as pale as a ghost.   I was just wondering if I would freak out when placed on that ledge nearly 900 feet off the ground.

Once you take the ride up you can still give up but your not getting your money back so it's time to man up and just do it.     You actually get to watch the riders have their harnesses checked and rechecked and rechecked again.  They are led out to the launch deck, strapped to the harness and then once the wires rewind given a chance to enjoy the view for a quick minute and are instructed at the countdown to step off or lean forward.  From inside the viewing deck you can see them fall off and then disappear out of side rapidly.    

At this point i was just like whatever, no time to back out now.  I happily volunteered among the three flight buddies I rode up with to go first.      I was ready to fly baby!!    The view from that ledge is freaking spectacular.   My jump was just as the sun was disappearing behind the horizon so I got a a completely unobstructed view of Las-Vegas no photo can match in place of the experience.   The operators basically make you place half your feet off the ledge and lean forward while holding on to the railing at the sides behind you.  It is a very awkward feeling.    3, 2, 1 and I leaned forward and let go and I was off... the wind in my face and the ground way down below I had won the mental battle.   Due to the way the harness holds you I recommend once jumping to try  to pitch yourself forward while falling so you fall more flat until you start to slow down.   This simulates the feel of an actual base jump a little bit more closely.    

As others have pointed out its not an actual freefall but somewhere in between a base jump and a controlled stunt jump.  The real ride happens in your head all the way just right up to the point of stepping off the ledge.  I would do it again for free and would definitely pay if they allowed you to freefall  along the wire a bit like the skycoaster experience.

If your looking to do something unique and catch a view of Vegas not very many people get to experience definitely consider the Sky Jump attraction.      I purchased the dvd but skipped the photos... which are a major ripoff.   The dvd could also have sound if they really wanted to make it worth what you pay for the attraction.  As it is it is just silent video while the camera follows you off the ledge and down on the adjacent wires...  

I am definitely happy I did this and did not back down.  I would have regretted coming back to Miami not having conquered my mental fear of that tiny ledge you step away from toward your blissful descent.  A top notch and unique experience all the way around!!  Highly Recommended!!!

Upon arrival we asked where the sky jump was so we could buy tickets and we were directed to the lounge to get a free trip to the top. At the top we were directed back to the bottom to buy tickets. After being told that it was reservation only, we made a reservation for an hour later. We went to the bar to kill some time. As the reservation neared we went back to the sky jump offices  and waited and waited and waited. 40 minutes after our reservation time we asked a staff member named Ocean what the holdup was, how can you be running 40 minutes behind when we made the reservation less than 2 hours previous! She looked us in the eye and told us there was nothing she could do and that she didn't care about us because she was quitting right away. Not really the attitude we want from staff that we are trusting our lives with. 
I spoke to a lady who identified herself as a manager and asked for a refund after explaining that her staff were disrespectful, rude and downright dangerous for that environment. We got our refund and left. I will never go back and would caution anyone who considers riding the sky jump whether they are comfortable putting their life in the hands of kids who really don't care.",zxuxd6Hz2tKcpgZ71dYEcw,9,3,1,gikDkPbdd1ECka_UZA4Wow

Once in a lifetime experience 
Surreal to go through it, worth it all
It's a leap of faith, when you are standing at the edge thinking to yourself, you are doing this for yourself and being the bravest, you can be.

Many people like to compare it to zip lining and that is extremely inaccurate! Getting to the yellow ling on top right by the edge and having that momentum to jump off, you realize this is nothing that can be compare. When you first jump off you instantly feel shocked that you did it, so surreal and life changing!  If you had to compare it would be much close to bungee jumping or skydiving out of an airplane. 

**Would be awesome to have a shirt included in all packages or the one with the go pro, since it is the most expensive and would be a great accessory!

Cons:
1. Not allowed to take photos with others in your group at the top of the tower before you jump off

2. Feel rushed out when you land, not enough time in between to take photos and take everything all in",oUSGlhqEOP7UDKAhyBSBhA,3,0,5,W6J9Q5SQOB35KEELZwS0HA
