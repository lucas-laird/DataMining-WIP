358016,2015-10-29,0,JpssdgvmNjfBpjIhZMgICA,Came here to buy a sandwich for lunch and it was delicious. As a matter of fact it was my first time trying it out. Sounds crazy but yeah I really didn't know what was great until I ask for their opinion and they were kind of enough to go over with me of what I like in my sandwich. I appreciate there customer service thanks subway!,y4I9oUIRqeozumcIuXYXAg,0,0,5,4o4IiqvyOSMmqei_MI9GTg

In fact even the patrons were friendly, one gentleman yielded some seats for us ladies. Also, I noticed that they regularly mopped and cleaned. So both the floors and the tables were immaculate.",uLthrQwJFUYvfNzsB45iHA,0,0,3,Db4sFgCNXk3G9ydbcVDHAA

It wasn't bad, Subway is close to my office and I like the green bell peppers and onions that they add with it. Okay for $2.60",Oz8Bp1NY-Szz4lvSbVsV4Q,3,1,3,evGBbx31NvwybXE8GuITzg

Also unlike a few subways that have a no coupon policy this one actually does. Upon my last visit I was able to snag a 6"" for $3. The staff I have encountered so far have been very pleasant and service was quite prompt. Keep up the good work and I will keep stopping by.",UgMW8bLE0QMJDCkQ1Ax5Mg,2,1,4,A_Ax2ghVhAhvFVjaFJTfUQ

Our group of 6 rolled up around 6:30am on a Monday to stock up on subs for the Mount Zion hike we had planned for later that day. The server was so patient with us even though we each had complicated orders, including asking for sauces on the side. She was super friendly and helpful the entire time.

I ordered a 12-inch spicy Italian sub ($5.75), which is two layers of salami and two layers of pepperoni. You can add any of a variety of toppings including cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, green peppers, olives, banana peppers, and jalape√±os. They also have a choice of sauces including sweet onion, honey mustard, southwest, chipotle, and creamy sriracha. I love how customizable their sandwiches are, although when they are busy it does lead to some waiting time since making each sandwich takes a couple minutes. 

In addition, Subway has this amazing deal throughout the month of May - buy any sub before 9am and get a free six-inch breakfast flatbread!",ZPN98PI53a9P7ZWM8V0qnw,0,0,5,jZfDQRlXJ14w8eUvcfMAZg
