2022690,2014-04-22,0,h0MNaniQdLa3ZGmXh9DDeQ,"This review is for the EAST FLAMINGO AND PECOS location. First and foremost, the food, while ice cold on arrival, was very tasty. But let's go into more detail. 

I had to call the Craig location to help me reach the Flamingo location. They weren't properly answering the phone. Once I got them on the phone, they were very helpful and friendly. 

The food took FOREVER. We live a mere 2 miles. The food took 75 minutes. 

Packaging was a nightmare. There was no lid on my tartar sauce, and it was packed with my rolls, so on arrival, my rolls were coated in tartar sauce.  The hot fish, hot yams and cold potato salad were all packaged together in one container, with nothing to separate them. On arrival, my fish was covered in the juice of the yams and the melted potato salad. I ate it anyway, because I had waited 75 minutes and spent $39. The other order was brisket which was really good, a hot link which my son loved, and a burger and chili cheese fries, which were very cold, but tasty.

They NEED to stop packing hot and cold food together. They need to be separated! Also, who thought tartar sauce open in the rolls container was a good idea? 

We would never ever order delivery again, but I would walk in and get it hot and fresh. The food was probably awesome when it first left the restaurant.

2773103,2015-06-23,0,h0MNaniQdLa3ZGmXh9DDeQ,"Went for a late lunch / early dinner today .
Party of 4.

Not the cleanest or most attractive establishment in the world - especially with the neon marker written on the windows to advertise the  99cent menu.

Service of staff was pleasant and quick .
Seating felt like we were in someone's home or backyard with a plastic food up table and chairs in the middle of the room.

Orders:

Whiting dinner plate with Mac & cheese and rice . Rice was disgusting-
Totally inedible and dry . Spit it out immediately. 
Mac and cheese appeared baked - we got excited !- but we surmised that it was actually only broiled (or at least just under baked) because the top of it had a lovely crust but the underneath was loose and not bound together as in traditionally bAked macaroni. Seasoned very well-
3.5 out of 5 for taste, maybe even four !! 

Whiting fish - I cannot believe I tried to test the waters with seafood away from the coast. Being from New England , I cherish good seafood . This was HORRIBLE! not cleaned properly, clearly frozen filets,
Gross stuff . How could anyone eat this stuff ! Biggest mistake ! 

My companions had #1 -brisket dinner with Mac & cheese and collard
Greens. Good greens - fresh and tasty with hot sauce . Mac and cheese as described above . Good!  Brisket was ""smoked with the right wood, next time get the right seasoning"" says my Texas friend.

#2 ribs and sides - they said things were ok/ decent for them.

We then ordered ""strawberry cake"" and received a hefty slice of pound cake with a strawberry glaze on top. Not exactly what we expected ... It was moist and densely packed but nothing to write home about and certainly not the strawberry cake we were hoping for !
Would go back to try the chicken or eat more Mac & cheese .",yEvpIPtbEeVJJe2CW09AEA,0,0,3,ndmQYMFc7uQakLZUxvdUag

There was so many high and low points with dealing with the inside of the store and the employees. A couple of positive points were how I was given a sample plate of all the side dishes, and I was given my drink for free. The low points were how it took close to 30 mins to get my order while watching multiple people order and leave with their food,  and while they had sweet tea, they didn't have non-sweet tea. The reason why I got a free drink.

Some of the worst tasting ribs I have tatsed. They were very chewy with a tatse as if the grill they were cooked on hadn't been cleaned in ages. Not having a lot of flavor on their own, I had to dip them in the bbq sauce that came with the order so I can finish them.

The mac and cheese and cole slaw that I ordered was decent. The mac and cheese tasted as if it was made with real cheddar,  and the cole slaw wasnr overly sweet and had a nice tatse of pepper.
