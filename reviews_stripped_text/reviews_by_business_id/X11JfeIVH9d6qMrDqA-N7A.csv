I am a life long Washingtonian and Sea Hawks fan. 5 of us were in Vegas for a combination birthday trip and after a quick Google search we decided that Scooters would be the place to go watch the Hawks VRS.Falcons game. What a show! The Las Vegas Seahawkers club was top notch and VERY welcoming. Under the advice of a bartender that I spoke with a few days before the game we made sure to arrive a few hours early and we had the privilege of sitting by some of the club officers. What a GREAT group of people! If you are a Hawks fan and want the same type of high energy hawk madness you will find in Seattle this is the place to go.

Also $9 pitchers of beer and HUGE meals for under $10!!!! Beautiful servers who do incredibly well for the amount of people they have to tend to. The $25 dollar cab ride from Harrah's was well worth it.

Just one more testament to the type of people in the bar one brave soul came in wearing red pants and an Atlanta Falcons jersey. He was hazed but treated well and after the game and a big snafu with the cab service he offered and took the 5 of us to our hotel. Talk about  SPORTSMANSHIP!!!!

Great people, great food, great prices, just a great time!!!!

Great staff with gorgeous bartenders.  The beer selection was great. They have pool, darts, shuffle board and some arcade games. The 46"" hdtv's at the bar are great. They have a beer club, if you drink all 69 beers in 6 months time, you get a free draft every time you come in for the remainder of the 6  months and you get a picture taken as well as a 69 T-shirt, so the faster u drink all 69, the longer u have for free beer.  Fun place, beers and cocktails are better priced than PT's when it's not happy hour. Had the angus sliders with a side of fries and was happy. The food is good and average priced. I will definitely come back here. I have 60 beers left to go. Also they show the UFC fights and there is no cover. Awesome place!!",8pwjRoNVEFp3eYTkuyr5aQ,4,0,5,39Obv6tKEembSnTiwuVJcA

They also have arcade games in the bar area which was kind of nostalgic, especially seeing Street Fighter 2 and Mortal Kombat.  They have some great specials when the Phillies are playing but I didn't ask why the Phillies, maybe the owner is from Philly?

I would have given Scooters 4 stars but we came here on karaoke night and the talent was mediocre at best.  See, the reason I don't do karaoke is because I know I can't carry a tune and would prefer not to torture the other patrons in the place.

Halfway through the second period the bartender ""Amanda"" changed the channel to UFC while we were the only ones watching that particular TV in the corner.  We asked her to change it back, and without apology she changed it back...along with an extremely rude comment. She then went back to the other end of the bar complaining to her other patrons how much she ""hated hockey fans.""  Classy!

There are tons of other bars in Vegas that will serve you a cold beer without attitude...I suggest you skip this one. Unless you enjoy rude service (similar to ""Dick's Last Resort). Despite what they claim...Scooters is NOT a hockey bar!!  The bartenders at Hooters down the street were very nice and we were able to enjoy the 3rd period of our game...thanks Hooters!

As others have said there's a $10 cover and you need to get there early to snag a table. The fight is shown on two big screens with accompanying audio.  Unfortunately it's everywhere else that Scooters falls short.  

The food in a word is bad.  I'm not sure how you screw up wings, burgers and pizza but Scooters did. The wings and burger were bland and over cooked.  The pizza ranks with one of the worst I've ever had.  I ordered sausage as a topping (expecting Italian sausage) and what came on the pizza was slices smoked sausage (think Eckrich smoked sausage). 

Lastly the service was lacking.  I know it was a big event, but Scooters shows fights all the time, they should be staffing appropriately for the crowd.  Getting drink and food orders took forever and the few staff present seemed frazzled.

What we did eat off the happy hour menu (nachos and potato skins) were ok. Most of the nachos had been burned, quite dark brown with not much for toppings. The potato skins were fresh but bland - both items were loaded with scallions, perhaps a bit much.

There were a buch of Wranglers fans there, wearing jerseys, watching the game. Man, Wranglers fans are pretty passionate about their team. That was cool to watch.

As said before, NOT management's fault for allowing such idiots into this pub. I'm always sitting around a bunch of morons who are only there to ignite their belligerence and wait for a highlight-reel knockout. But that doesn't happen every fight and because of that dread, these idiots insult and disrespect the event so publicly that it makes me want to make them the victim of their own desires. I'm so disgusted with that brawl till you fall attitude. And intoxication is never an excuse.

Met up with some friends here the other night.  They have a ton of beers, and you can join a beer club (FREE!) and if you drink all the beers on there in like a 3 month period, you get draft beers for free for the next 6 months?  Or something like that.  It gets you out of your comfort zone of normal beers (Bud light anyone?) and gets you to try stuff you probably wouldn't.

Food is better than normal bars.  I had the nachos.  Good and there was a massive amount!  My husband had the pulled pork sandwich with onion rings, which he said was fine and our friends loved the mac & cheese.

The bartenders are great and very attentive.  I put in $20 into a machine (which I usually don't do) and of course all of my 3 beers were free.

Seriously this bar serves way better food and has a way better environment than the Niners bar down the road.

Order the Pastrami Burger you won't regret it. It's a burger with pastrami piled on top in a bun. It's not small.  Sorry I didn't take a good pic so didn't. It was delicious on a its own but I dumped some of your typical condiments (A1, ketchup, hot sauce) on it which also doubled as what I dipped my curly fries in. I'm sure if there was an option to throw an egg on it I'd do it next time. This was already done but now will they throw on some bacon!? haha I don't like to usually change things especially when they're already good but why not. The curly fries came seasoned.

They have a decent Happy Hour that go Monday-Friday 3pm-7pm and 12am-3am. $5 on various apps like wings, fingers, a mini nacho, I've had the potato skins and mozzarella sticks. 50% off domestic drafts. 

They have a separate dining area from the bar area but really why would you not sit at the bar. I didn't notice a smoke smell. The bar is decorating in a lot of sports memorabilia including a Joe Montana Niners jersey. They have various bar activities like darts, billiards, and shuffle board. A number of TVs. And from what I heard free showing of UFC events which it gets packed for. 

Their beer selection are ok, not a lot of craft beers, but the service, the pastrami burger, and the environment are all they needed to makes me a fan.

I used to go and watch the UFC fights here all the time.  Standing room only, and you get to get there early.  The bar as well as dining room get jam packed.  

There are several old school video games here, most notably a Street Fighter II Champion Edition game!!!  This machine alone is enough for my friends and I to drop by.  They also have dart boards, a pool table, and a shuffle board table.  

As far as the bar goes, its your typical setup.  Not much different from a PTs or Putters.  Where I feel Scooter's excels at is their food.  I can recall the first time I went in.  My friend and I were in the neighborhood looking for a quick bite.  At that time, Scooter's was new.  I don't recall what we ordered, but I remember the both of us thinking, WOW this food is good!!  And I have never been disappointed since.  The appetizer sampler platter is HUGE and only $16.  You get wings, fingers, potato skins, and mozzarella sticks.  The nacho's are also enormous, best part is at the end, you're not left with a pile of chips.  They put a ton of toppings on these bad boys.  If you get their wings, I HIGHLY recommend the spicy garlic.  Another favorite of mine is the pastrami burger + fried egg.  I believe it is a 1/2lb patty with a heaping helping of pastrami, lettuce, tomato, onion, and mozzarella cheese.  This burger was so big, I couldn't even bite it.  I had to take out the veggies and eat it as a side salad!!  

If you're looking for a chill bar to grab a cold one, crazy fun atmosphere for the UFC, or feeling nostalgic for some Street Fighter II, this is a great alternative to the big boy chain.

Ok .... done with my rant! lol   Outside of the mac n cheese disaster, scooters is still one of my favorite places to go for a drink! and all the other dishes I have tried have been top notch!",AFidNHs_PGfH5rX6iNRzmQ,0,1,2,969KMDnZZL1YDBVnVnpRig

Also called and talked to Rich to make sure kitchen would be open and that we would have a cocktail waitress on staff this night. 

Little disappointed that our waitress took an EO and left around 9pm but it's not her fault. Just made me look like I didn't do my due diligence to some of my friends who suggested to go elsewhere. But Big E the bartender that took over was awesome and we had a great time.

Every time I go there, the staff is always top notch and one of the bartenders even remembered me after months of not being there.

- The fan club passes out raffle tickets to anyone in Seahawks attire, so be sure to get your hawk on! 
- If you're not already a member, join the fan club for $15/person or $25/family of four for the year. You'll get access to a special raffle for jersey's at the end of every game.
- Make sure you try a special shot called ""The Hawk Bomb."" You won't be sorry!
- There's a special dining room that's great for accommodating families with kids or people who need table/booth rather than bar seating. 

Outside of game days it's also a good place to host parties/get togethers or stop by for late night noms. The staff are friendly, the food is great bar food. I highly recommend the Spicy Green Beans and Chicken Parmesan Sliders.",c-O-3FMW0j9C6W-qKRUR6g,5,0,5,5piOi_uad3rQpDjwlMrLJA

What a bunch of unsociable fans of my home town team. If your not in their little club then you really aren't made to feel welcome at all.  

As a Seattle guy that is very involved with Seahawk charities I was surprised by the way the Hawk fans there treat others. The worst of the group had to be the Club Secretary, a power tripping person that told my wife and I that you have to wear Seahawk gear to be welcome.  I would suggest staying clear of this place on game day.

Their burger is tasty, as is there chicken avocado sandwich, though they could both use considerably more avocado (I ordered avocado for my burger). I had a potato salad and my friend had curly fries. Nothing was special, but everything was good. We also had some wings which were drenched in spicy garlic sauce (a good thing).

Host UFC Fights yet they are never prepared for the crowds. Understaffed is an understatement. Takes 10-15 minutes to get a drink. Food took close to 30 minutes on both occasions. Untrained staff operating sound system. Continuously turning sound off and turning music on.

3620675,2013-10-25,8,X11JfeIVH9d6qMrDqA-N7A,"Being a long time Seahawk fan born and raised in Seattle, in general it's pretty tough to locate an establishment that can replicate the type of atmosphere typically found during games at Centurylink during game day. After finally discovering Scooters, I was pleasantly surprised/relieved/overjoyed to know that I had found home again, as many Seahawks Fans know, being a fan away from home can make you feel like a ""Castaway""..screaming for WILSON!!! Russell Wilson, that is!

The place is great! It's split up in 3 sections, the restaurant (found right when you walk in), with plenty of booth seating and TV's to watch the game, is extremely family friendly. The bar next to it houses an island bar with TV monitors allowing you to watch the game from every angle, which also includes a ""Hawks Nest"" on one end (a nod to the Hawks Nest found at Centurylink). Finally, next to the bar is the gaming room with a pool table, arcade games, several flatscreen monitors, with, most importantly, a huge wall projection screen spanning almost the entire area of the main wall! It's thoughtfully designed for all types of fans and viewers.

I've been watching Seahawks games here for going on 2 years now. It is truly something special for die hard Seahawk fans, as it's by far the largest congregation of fans in Las Vegas every Sunday and is also home to the Las Vegas Seahawkers, which is officially sanctioned by the Seattle Seahawks. There are anywhere from 200-400 fans on game days.

The people that run it (Las Vegas Seahawkers) are amazing! You immediately feel welcome the moment you walk in, and are greeted with roars, screams and high fives when the excitement kicks in during game time. The organizers of the Las Vegas Seahawkers do a tremendous job of MC'ing/organizing/facilitating excitement during each game with chants, the ceremonial flag waving during touchdowns, raising the 12th man flag before kickoff, and also hold a raffle for prize giveaways. They do everything possible to make you feel at home and welcome and make it a point to make sure that your time there is unforgettable. They even bring in Seahawks players and local Seattle celebrities to join in on the fun!  The last game I saw there the Las Vegas Review Journal (LV's major newspaper publication) was present capturing the excitement and giving away prizes of their own! It's really like one big family in this place and is a must for any Seahawk fan looking to share game day excitement with their fellow 12th man on game day. Truly something special. 

To the gentleman (Ric B.) who provided the less than favorable review. In the nicest way I know how, I would like to say please pull your head out of your A$$! Perhaps you may have misunderstood what the rules were for the prize giveaways, but, in order to qualify, fans need to wear Seahawks gear to receive a raffle ticket for the drawing (Seriously, who doesn't proudly support their team on game day by wearing Seahawks gear, especially when going somewhere public to watch the game?!) For those who for whatever reason forget their gear, I have personally witnessed the club Secretary provide raffle tickets to those with no gear on that claim they are from Seattle. She is one of the sweetest most down to earth people there! Finally, unless you're hiding in a corner the entire time or are anti-social, you are going to receive high fives until your hands hurt and hugs til your ribs hurt during the game, so not sure what you mean by ""unsociable""? I've met countless strangers that come in for a weekend, usually in town on tourist detail, and have bonded over the Seahawks with every single one of the them! Every single visitor I've met that comes in for their first visit is always in awe of what takes place here. All I hear is: ""This place is incredible! I can't believe how awesome this is!, I will be back next time i'm in town!"" Frankly, it's very difficult NOT to feel the love from your fellow 12th man/woman here! So please, Ric B., get off of your pretentious high horse and get over yourself!

In regards to the food and service, both are excellent! They have game time happy hour specials for food and drink - killer chicken nachos, garlic fries and wings! The waitresses are super attentive,  fast, all smiles and are pretty damn cute! Especially Vanessa - She's the sweetest/cutest there! :) She ALWAYS takes good care us! It's pretty impressive considering there are hundreds of people at these events and she, along with the rest of the staff, pull off phenomenal service and hot food, always attentive to our needs! 

BOTTOM LINE (if it's not already clear), Scooters is THE place to be for ALL SEAHAWKS FANS in Las Vegas on gameday. You will be warmly welcomed, greeted with the ""Northwest Nice"" that we fans are known for, and will find that just by being a fan in this environment automatically makes you family. :)

Our meal began with several appetizers.  The roasted artichokes are beyond delicious!  My kids raved repeatedly about both the spicy green beans and the jalapeno strips.  They were delightfully flavorful with just a hint of spice.

Our main courses included the bacon pizza, a philly steak sandwich, cajun penne and the spicy BBQ burger.I tasted all but the burger.  The food was creative, unique and interesting.  The onion rings were fried perfectly and the fries were crisp.

In the third period, they decided to have dessert.  Fried Oreos and Chocolate Brownie.  The Oreos were not impressive, but that is not my style of eating.  The brownie, however, was spot on!

The staff was pleasant, helpful, prompt and courteous.  Like I said, I came to nosh while watching a hockey game, but left telling everyone I know if they want a great little place to eat really quality food (and watch sporting events at the same time), Scooter is a MUST-DO!!!",aO4bZzNy26mJFULn2ZWN1A,1,0,4,nqGI7fgCfFc0oZ5Kuj1FZA

Once you enter the pub you will notice the main dinning room and to the left is the entry way to the bar that was spacious and made to accomadate large groups. The third room that was adjacent to the bar was a game room with bar stools and tables plus a Pool table, Shuffleboard & various Arcade games along the walls. 

The food was great and the service was on point given that they had a few servers at the time since it was a Sunday. Some of the items that we had that were notable was the Chicken Fingers, they came in two large pieces that look like fish fillet but the breading was light and crispy with a good amount of chicken with curly fries but you have the option of getting plain fries or tater tots. Other items that our group enjoyed were the Southwest Eggrolls and the Homemade Chips and Fresh Salsa that came with 3 sauces (Mild,Spicy,Guacamole).  Portion size are great for sharing especially the small size Chicken Nachos that my friend ordered was delicious. 

Great place to catch a game since they approximately have about 22 Flat Screens throughout the bar, game room and main dinning room.

I've been a big influence, since I'm a hybrid from Vegas & Seattle and have worked as a bartender for the Seattle Seahawks for many years too. 

But when I went to Scooters last month, I was gambling and had put $40 in the video poker machines and unfortunately, I lost, but that's normal and not the problem. The problem was that I had to pay for all my drinks. The bartender failed to communicate anything with me, as I've been a local Las Vegan for years and I'm used to the drinks being comped when you're playing. 

I'll never recommend anyone to this place or ever step foot in there ever again after wasting an extra $35 on that evening's drinks. This is unfortunate, but I'll now have to say bad things about that place too! 

I've also been an organizer for the UW Alumni sports group and would not even consider ever taking the group to Scooter's after this either. Customer service is everything in this city!

Otherwise, the location is far from my house, but that's fair for a one-location business in our giant city.

The food is good, but service can be slow if the place is really busy. The servers do a good job of trying to check on you, though. One of my friends swears by the potato skins. I've never had a bad meal there.

Part of the bar has a big screen projector, which is a nice touch for games. You can also play shuffleboard in the same room, so you feel like an athlete as well.",xoM1PfPwdY5HC0bfwM8cOQ,0,0,3,E8U214f1mB2aV4BIF2LVQg

We entered a big room that was completely empty: no gamblers, no diners.  We didn't think it was going to bode well, but the very friendly waiter/bartender said that in his four years there he had never seen anything like it.  We believed him.

There was a lot to choose from on the menu.  I ordered the sirloin sandwich, with a side of slaw, and my husband chose the Chicken BLTA salad which had grilled chicken with bacon, tomatoes, avocado, and shredded cheese.  It was huge, and he had half of it for lunch the next day.  I thought the chicken on his salad looked dry, but when I tasted it, it was surprisingly moist and not oversalted.  

My steak sandwich was another story.  The steak was tough, gristly, and tasted as if it had been marinated in a salt bath.  It was inedible.  The waiter offered to bring me something else, but I wasn't very hungry to start with, so I filled up on the cole slaw and nursed my Apple Orchard cider.  The cole slaw was very different.  It was creamy without being mayonnaise-y, and I deduced that it was made with Greek yogurt.  But after congratulating myself on ordering a healthier alternative to fries, the waiter put me in my place when he told me it was made with bleu cheese dressing.  So much for healthy!

Since my steak sandwich was a fiasco, I was going to give Scooter's three stars.  I liked the place, despite the woeful sandwich experience.  The waiter deducted it from the bill, so of course we weren't going to use the certificate.  But because the service was so excellent, and hubby's salad was so terrific, I've bumped it up to four.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,1,4,TDV6njkZCMJTp_FcRgkMrw

Super friendly service. Bartender is very attentive.

We usually come here after work, late night, early morning. Crowds already gone. Front door is locked for safety. Must ring bell for entrance!

My favorite items from menu:
Grilled chicken and avocado sandwich with fries.
Chicken is tender, cheese is perfectly melted. Tomato slices, red onions and avocado are greatly enhancing the sandwich.
Steak and eggs with hash brown and a choice of toast. The breakfast steak is 6 oz., and it can be a hit or miss. I never had any problems, but last weekend my BF didn't like the steak at all. It had a very sour taste ... I guess to vinegary ... I don't know ... 
Anyway, bartender immediately apologized for not liking the meat, and offered something else from the menu. Also took it off from the bill. No arguments, no ifs and no buts ... very easy transaction. His attitude made the whole experience absolutely great!

The food is definitely better than the average bar with the sliders being some of the best I've ever had.  How are they THAT juicy?

The house garlic fries had just the right amount of salt and garlic. 

The sriracha burger was delicious but a total mess to eat. 

I wasn't thrilled with the decor - Formica tables and TVs everywhere. But the food and service makes up for the decor.",OznrIguWJMFfpQNlaNwYjg,8,5,5,Htpwgp04cza8ESo79QDl2w

We got here about an hour early and barely got a seat at the bar.  The entire place was packed with Seahawks fans, and it's a big place.  It has 3 parts- restaurant part, bar part and a event room sorta place.  They are all connected.  Food here was decent- I had a chicken philly and fries.  It was above average.  Service was good too.  They even have good prices- $7.50 pitchers or Miller Lite when we were here.  If I'm ever in Vegas again during a Seahawks game I will probably watch here.  The only problem was there were a few scuzzy people here, and I thought I was about to witness a fight.  That and having to get here early to get a good seat.",ffPY_bHX8vLebHu8LBEqfg,1,0,4,7ITu-VT79gVFTRqzRgYrEQ

While the food was ok and the service was generally ok, the whole experience was tainted by one moment.  My brother in law was playing the machines and in several hundred dollars.  After hitting something not too big (about $400), he cashed out.  Whenever he hit something about that size, he cashes out then starts over, eventually feeding it all back in and then some.  One of the bartenders paid out the cash out and walked away.  He gave the other bartender $20  and went back to playing.  This was the third time that night that this had occurred.  To my dismay, the first bartender went to the other and asked how much he had tipped.  He didn't indicate whether he thought this was enough or not, but either way, that is not the point.  Of course they are primarily working for tips, but to ask this in front of us is rude and unacceptable.  This bartender may have thought he was being discrete, but it was loud enough for me to hear.  By the end of the night, the bartenders were tipped $140, but my brother in law was down $700.  

This may be the only Seahawks bar in town, but I'd rather watch at home than be insulted like that.",cFubXywYZHvmwwKb5spgQQ,0,0,1,eub5bJwcM8d5lV0cbijnqA

Spicy Nachos were excellent, along with very good potatoey Potato Skins.  Spicy Chicken Noodle Soup was very good with well-cooked noodles and carrots.  And a Caesar Salad with Chicken and Candied Pecans included big chunks of browned chicken with mostly Romaine leaves covered by tasty Bleu Cheese Vinaigrette Dressing.

Garlic Bread was creamy.  Service was very good, and portions were large.  But Diane did not like her haddock Fish & Chips at all!

Good prices, friendly staff, and I love the shuffleboard, pool and arcade games! Whenever I come to town, this is where a group of me and my friends meet up. Great location for the West side and right of the 215. 

Rumor was said there was karaoke- I say a big THUMBS DOWN! Super lame, that would deter me and a bunch of my friends from going there.",fIzDHCyrlXgiD1r0SLUDFA,1,0,5,WdCYwylT5JkUGDM0a3jTBA

 We stopped in here on a random daytime outing (they have great Yelp reviews) for some food and beer; there was only 1 employee (Bartender) to cover the entire place and she was absolutely incredible. Even though the place was fairly packed the Bartender did a great job taking care of all of us with a huge smile.  The only reason I can't give 5 stars is the smokey environment, I am not sure if the ventilation system was not working or maybe its just always THAT smoke filled?  Not recommended if you don't like the after taste (and smell) of cigarettes.",GaPgrjpb6qCcDT7cD7CI9g,1,1,4,-ip_8T8B95b5n0YKbMUucA

It's very open roomy yet without the disconnected feeling most places this size has. The service is always amazing and good food. I come for the staff and gaming. Crystal is absolutely fantastic and my favorite! If you haven't been I would say come in. Just know it does get super busy for Seahawk games as its THE Seahawk bar of Vegas.,Kf7ZAfVIx0B4PLeVxV5Ysw,1,1,5,62UFYqN-Wmn_T8snTPFS4g

I had their double cheeseburger, good burger! $3 miller lite for NFL games is pocket friendly. Only thing I would say would have made it a better experience would be if the server would check in on my drink or food rather than having me ask but then again this is a $3 beer bar so no hard feelings on that. I will come here again when I'm in the area.",MQspyjYtgbzpjAwBZTmqdQ,1,0,3,ZqWMBS96_zDyd2chaQX8iA
