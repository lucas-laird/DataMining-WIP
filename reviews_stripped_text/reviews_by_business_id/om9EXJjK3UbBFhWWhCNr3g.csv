Every single one of the staff were courteous, kind, and helpful from the meal prep, to the cash register, to the bussing staff who seemed very pleased to see me bussing my own table...I mean, doesn't everyone? Either way, even he was very friendly and service oriented. The Victorian/Edwardian themed style reminiscent of old Market Deli's was a nice plus too. It's always good to see when Vegas remembers that extra spending on theming does not mean it is always appropriate to make everything look like a tawdry night-club or the set of a Hollywood game show.

It looked like a little cafeteria.

We ordered the salmon sushi, miso ramen and pork fried rice.

To my surprise, everything was delicious! The salmon sushi just had salmon and cream cheese, but they were big slices of salmon and it didn't have to much rice. The miso ramen was good for a café, although I expected different kind of noodles, and the egg to be more yolky (if you know what I mean) in the middle.

Things take a turn for the worse when you venture into the exotic world of Tex/Mex food like tacos and quesadillas. My beef quesadilla was basically a few scoops of stew meat on a flour tortilla with melted cheddar cheese. Imagine a slimy soft taco your mother made you when you were a kid and you've got the exact description. I ended up adding lettuce, pico, and sour cream and then eating the meat out of the middle.

The deli sandwiches that my aunt and uncle got looked a lot better (and apparently had an authentic vibe that was lacking from my quesadilla).",NZba-Q-Fp10iF77CTQt24Q,1,1,3,L0-3eblnE0FgI5aYwL8KBQ

BIZZBURGER: very interesting item that I had to try. It's a cheese burger with carmelized onions between pepperoni pizza. Crazy huh? But it actually was good. So the pizza (top and bottom) is round about 6in in diameter, giving the effect of a burger with the pepperoni and cheese inside facing the burger. I could taste the pizza with a the flavor of a burger with every bite. No ketchup or mustard was needed. The pizza sauce was enough to make it very flavorful. The only negative was that the pepperoni made it very oily. Maybe if it was a veggie or sausage pizza, it would've been less oily. 

Cost: $12.  With fries and drink $19

- applewood bacon  dipped in pancake batter so the bacon is embedded in the pancake mix.  Yum! And these aren't your flimsy pieces of bacon, there are thick cut pieces. What I didn't care too much for was the bourbon syrup that tasted a little too much bourbon and not enough maple.

Coffee counter offers Lavazza and subpar baked goods, sandwiches and pizza slices can be assembled or heated to order, froyo flavors are predictable, asian station is slightly above your usual food court vendors (healthier option with fresh veggies!), and the aforementioned sushi counter does offer a prepacked sashimi plate. If you're only a little bit hungry, or with a group, this area is probably an economical option to satisfy all cravings.

This trip I had Mac N Cheese. Baked crust breaks open to a creamy cheese macaroni. Excellent comfort food after a long night drinking and gambling. 

This morning I gave into temptation and had a cheesecake.  It is worth the calories!  The dense creamy texture is perfect. The graham crust has a nice ratio. The LavAzza dark roasted coffee is wonderful!   I added a little half & half and enjoyed the deep bronze color it turned into. A little bit of happiness in each cup.

Pizza- Open late night so you can come here and grab and slice or a whole pie. Order at the counter, then go to the cashier and pay, and then go back to pick up the food. The ordering process is not very streamlined, but I guess it works for them. Pretty standard pizza but they heat it up again in the oven so it's hot and has crispy edges if they do it right. 

Salad- awesome salad bar. They make it for you, so you don't have to worry about other people contaminating the bar. You can choose your type of lettuce, and add toppings (extra charge for some, so be sure to ask)

Sushi/Noodles- located on the other side. I haven't had the sushi before, so I can't really say how fresh that is. I always go to the noodle bar which has reserved table service, and my favorites are the pad Thai and XO udon noodles. The fried rice is also pretty good too.

Pastry/coffee- your typical hotel pastry box and coffee bar. I had the breakfast burrito and it was alright. 

Other foods I haven't tried: taco bar, soups, sandwiches

On the weekend, they close half of the hall and serve a cafe style breakfast. There's usually a line on Saturday and Sunday mornings, so plan your day accordingly. We ordered takeout breakfast and ate it in the room, which was perfectly fine with us.

All the places inside belong to Harrah's and each of them serves a different type of edible. Everything I have tried has tasted much better than the average cafeteria or even food court options. 

I tried the coffee counter for breakfast one day and was pleasantly surprised. I got a flattened burrito - I don't think that is what they call it but that is what it looks like. It had egg, potato, bacon, sausage and more! I added some hot sauce and got a coffee and was good to roll for the rest of my morning. Also - I was super full! It was pretty cheap too. 

I went back today and sat at the sushi bar. I wanted to stick to something common - I didn't wanna waste money on something fancy that I may not enjoy. Therefore, I got yellowtail nigiri and a rainbow roll. It was far better than I thought to be. It wasn't the best sushi I have ever tried but in comparison to my expectations it blew me away.

I was looking at the menu at the counter and a nice lady asked me if I wanted to eat in or to go.  I told here I was eating in and she asked me to take a seat and relax and she would bring me tea and a menu.  What service!  I ended up getting a big bowl of Duck Soup.  It was the best Duck Soup I have ever had.  I love the Duck soup at the hotel that starts with a V but this was even better!  Crispy skin cooked to perfection with a flavorful duck broth.  The lady said the duck was cooked fresh daily.  Duck Soup with noodles and tea was maybe $13.

Sure, now I pay $7 for four hours of parking in that garage, but that's still not bad AND it is better than the roundtrip price to ride that shuttle to/from Westgate.

I've walked through Harrah's for years now and have seen the many upgrades to the main casino floor area. 

Fulton Street Food Hall was one of them and always caught my eye, so I finally decided to stop and actually check it out.

I like the classic black/white clean look, all the different areas and the good variety available.

Yelp Elite Stefany V seems to have the right idea when she said it has all the look of a casino buffet, but you can just buy anything a la Carte at each counter based on what you want.

That and there's a very nice bar as part of the offerings in this area.

It always seems incredibly clean to me too.

While you cannot get everything when it comes to food options, it is perfect if you're hungry and not exactly sure what you want. Or if you just want something to hold you over before a bigger meal a few hours later at any of the various other options nearby.

Sure, many items are priced in line with buying food on the Las Vegas Strip. However, there's value to be found at the bakery counter as I enjoyed what they called a ""Mini Ice Cream Sandwich"" for just $3.

Look at the picture for yourself. There's nothing mini about it. I had my choice of four different flavors in cookies, two different gelatos and the finished product was more than enough to hold me over until dinner much later in the night. 

The employee working that counter was incredibly nice and obviously made sure I got plenty of gelato. Just delicious.

Your mileage may vary on other items in the Food Hall, but I just like having options and this part of Harrah's gives me about as many in one spot as I'm going to find anywhere on Center Strip without paying for an entire buffet that I can't eat.",MmEYowrsA4j3K4gc9Th53g,6,5,3,LiVAZMoGFAMTKpakg4zcVw

Here we were at the Fulton Street Food Hall again. In a place that seemed to have everything, we would head straight to the Noodle Bar every single time. This place has been an inviting spot where my hubby indulged in his favorite, the Roast Duck Noodle Soup.

Without even looking at the menu, hubby ordered the Roast Duck Noodle Soup once more. It was served in a big bowl full of firm noodles topped with aromatic roast duck and Chinese baby bok choy. Couldn't guess what the duck marinade was; it was simply fragrant. In addition, the rich broth was seasoned just right. Everything was fresh and delicious. Hubby thought this was as good as the ones from San Francisco's Chinatown. Yes, it was a little pricey, but why fuss about it? We were on The Strip after all.

Tip #1: The medium-sized roast duck pieces were perfectly cleaver-chopped. However, these might be difficult to manage if you're not used to chopsticks. It'll be helpful to ask for an extra plate, a fork, and a knife to start.

My choice was the Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodles this time. What have I tried before? Vegetarian Buddha's Delight, Ma Po Tofu, Beef Chow Fun, and Chicken Fried Rice. I liked them all, especially the fried rice.

The noodle dish looked and smelled so good but I was a tad disappointed that it came to our table already cool to the touch. Regardless, it was delicious. I love that the noodles were crisp yet soft on the parts covered with sauce. Chicken breast pieces were tender and perfectly flavored. And the baby bok choy? Richly verdant. Fresh and crunchy, the way we cook it at home. It was also priced a little high, but after a happy meal like this, who cares?

Tip #2: The Noodle Bar cuts its baby bok choy the usual Chinese way. That is, cut it lengthwise into 2 (or more) pieces. If using the chopsticks proves unwieldy, ask for an extra plate, a fork, and a knife.

Overall, this was a 5-Star dining experience for us. Attentive service, adequate portions, tasty food, and clean dining area. There was much to impress us. It's remarkable that The Noodle Bar managed to be consistently good in this fast-paced food hall setting. And, if you're into sports, just look up at the screens in front of you. No sound, but plenty of action.

Now the salad is going to set you back approximately $11, but for that you get good quality ingredients and a sizable portion.  You communicate with the culinary salad staff your lettuce preference and then you pick six toppings, from red beans, to peas, to carrots, to beets, to tofu, to cheese to proteins (there are probably 25 options to pick from with your six)...over six items and there is an additional charge.  You select your dressing and toppings like nuts, dried fruits or croutons (no extra charge) and the staff tosses all together for you.

When I arrived, several of the spots were closed, but the location that has coffee, pastries, sandwiches, and Mexican food was open.  They had a triple berry smoothie for $6, you can add fresh fruit for $2.  But, the only fresh fruit they had was a banana, so I added that.

The smoothies are premade and frozen, so when you order they pull a frozen bag of pureed fruit out of the freezer and blend it up with some water.  The woman was not sure what else goes into the smoothie, but there was definitely some sort of dairy based product in there.  For $6 it was not cheap considering the ingredients but it was way better than the other smoothie options I found nearby, which were basically non-existent.  I will definitely give it another try.

Located just off the gaming floor at Harrah's and occupying a sizable footprint beneath Ice Pan with the Buffet not too far away The Fulton Street Food Hall at first looks like any other Casino Food Court, yet a closer look indicates something a bit more thoughtful, a 24/7 spot that morphs throughout the day with options abound.

Using a well stocked gaming bar as one anchor while fanciful pastries glow behind glass at a coffee bar near the other end towards escalators to the garage the Food Hall cannot be fully appreciated in a single visit, but over the course of twelve-hours the full breadth of the spread offers everything from Noodle Soups and Sushi to Breakfast Plates and Pizza, the Soft-serve station another popular option while Salads, Sandwiches, and ""Comfort Foods"" each offer options for diners on the go.

Admittedly only taking looks at 3 of 8 stations, my predilection to sweets obvious in the ordering, a stop by the pastry counter may prove daunting to the uninitiated, but taking into account that all items are made ""once or twice"" daily according to servers the best bet is either arriving early morning or choosing items with less time sensitivity, the miniature donuts far too dry when sampled late evening Friday while a Frisbee-sized Jumbo the morning after was pillowy soft, sweet, and the slightest bit yeasty, albeit expensive at $7.

Not particularly taken by the cookies, all three more sugary than necessary which led to the flavors trending mostly 'same-same,' both the dense chocolate Ding-Dong knockoff and rich peanut butter brownie were a step in the right direction, the latter almost too rich for one person though an accompanying cup of coffee will certainly aid the cause.

Expecting it a mistake even before ordering the $5 Almond Croissant it took only two bites to confirm the combination of poor proofing and sticky Frangipane as a disaster and casting the rest into the nearest receptacle before sitting down to proper breakfast it was with good fortune that not a bite more stomach space had been wasted since both the Chef's Special Pancakes and Fruit and Nut studded French Toast were amongst the Strip's more impressive examples, each offered the beneft of completely unanticipated pure Maple Syrup.

Brought up on Soft-serve, but generally not going out of my way for the stuff, it was mostly the uniqueness of flavors that led me to order a $6 cup late in the evening and although samples of flavors including Island Candy Bar, Birthday Cake, and Moose Tracks were all quite pleasant the blend of Southern Pecan and Peanut Butter Cup entitled Butter Cup was absolutely exquisite, a flavor something like salted French Butter that mixed well with banana chips and crunchy housemade honey granola.

***A touch more spendy than it should be, but trying far harder than need be, Fulton Street Food Hall goes to show that the Casinos are at least thinking about the quality of their food as part of the overall 'experience in 2015, a trend that both tourists and locals can only hope will continue to grow.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,13,10,3,2kHMjzzdAxyHzQPNzt4QWg

For a quick bite that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, this is a great spot to stop and eat. We found it as we got off the monorail station located in this hotel. What impressed me the most was the healthy options here. They had a noodle bar, a sushi bar, pizza place, dessert/wraps place, froyo, and a build your own salad spot. We enjoyed the build your own salad spot, which included 6 toppings, and choice of greens for $10. Meat is extra. The ingredients were fresh and they had some interesting toppings, like fig. My salad was huge and I couldn't even finish it all, I was so full! They also offered baked potatoes which we tried on another visit as well. Since our hotel's food court only offered fast food like McDonald's, hot dogs, pizza and no late night eateries, we found ourselves hopping on the monorail for a quick, healthy and affordable meal.

Another plus? This place is open 24/7!",9LgnOncogsW2g3Ko0M8DhA,6,4,4,LG3fUxa0cdmgvL2z6ks21Q

It's easy, it's fast, it is soooo convenient. Most of all, it's good! It can be a bit pricey, but it's Vegas, everything is pricey here. 

On the 1st day I had the Tokyo ramen.
It was good!

2nd day we had breakfast. A breakfast crepe with bacon, cheddar cheese, scrambled eggs then drizzled with maple syrup and powdered sugar. My fiancé has never liked a sweet and savory combination, but he absolutely loved this. It was very good! The guys who were working were very nice. 

Later that day we had their pizza. It was thin but still doughy. Just the right amount of both. We loved it! The guys who worked here were very nice too!

We also had a breakfast wrap with egg and cheddar wrapped in a flour tortilla. It honestly looked like a homemade AM Crunchwrap from Taco Bell the way it was put together. And it was soooo good. The perfect drunk munchy.",45Ps0pMVnKGyScSKZL7bFA,0,1,5,3WlgT96ic9wwEAOyecuu5w

I always keep ALL receipts for anything and always write down on my receipt what I tip and the total. When I was doing expenses at end of month I saw that I was charged $15.00 for this transaction. Not sure how this could have been a mistake with these numbers but in any event it happened. I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else and whoever had to do with this has been caught and dealt with appropriately.

5644812,2015-07-27,0,om9EXJjK3UbBFhWWhCNr3g,We were looking for a place to have breakfast that didn't have an hour wait. Found this one near the monorail stop in Harrah's. Reason it was not crowded was because the food is bland and overpriced. We were seated immediately but the server did not come to take our order for 20 minutes. On the table next to us were 2 half eaten meals which were not cleared away until we were halfway through eating. The waitress finally came to take our order just as we were about to leave. She was very rude and abrupt with us and acted annoyed when we asked for clarification on the daily specials. I ended up ordering the specialty french toast with pecans which took another 15-20 minutes to arrive and was slightly warm and tasteless. The hot chocolate tasted like it came from a package. When we were done with our food I had to flag down another employee to ask for containers for our leftover and the check.I took another 15 minutes for the waitress to return with the bill.  We ended up at the restaurant for almost 1 1/2 hours. The service is terrible and the food mediocre. Never coming back here.,HH_DDiUA4iWD2VM1D6fcMg,0,0,1,2NUXkpGtr1jq_CKWafio_w

They have a serious operational issue if they take this long during non rush hours.  Oh and bonus tip - the same people cleaning up the dirty dishes also serve food/coffee.  On the upside you can get free ketchup preloaded from someone else's left over when you get your food.

I am hooked on their black and white cake cookies. They are a white moist vanilla cake covered in white and milk chocolate in the shape of a jumbo cookie and they are ridiculous moist and good. I have made many of trips here just to pick up one of them as they are that good!

*** Review for the Sushi & Japanese Ramen joint ***

Service was a bit slow. The sushi guy behind the counter was mean. Customer has to remind/ask for EVERYTHING.

I don't want to give this place a bad review but goodness you are in Vegas! We had 7 girls and was hungry (for lunch). We each ordered our entree and yes! the fried rice here is good but dang it WHY SO SALTY on the Ramen?!?! I literally had to drink water rest of the day!

On a note, we were suppose to get ""spicy hot sauce"" NOT sriracha (the waiter totally forgot about our sauce)

Also, the rolls were cold (even the tempora rolls) and tasted stale. Maybe it was opened from the packaged prep and just placed on out plates??",Z8H2jOfwmeDOuU111hcUOQ,39,29,2,aGeNrUQSS8rcR1TbvASNyw

They let you choose the type of lettuce, about 8 different toppings, and a protein and all the fixings. Salad was huge and was like $12 which was totally worth it. So much so that I came and got it again two more times during my week stay in Vegas.
