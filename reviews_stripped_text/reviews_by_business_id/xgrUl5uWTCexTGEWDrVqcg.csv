203072,2015-01-30,0,xgrUl5uWTCexTGEWDrVqcg,"I ordered the beef skewers ( with a side of Israeli salad) and the crunchy salmon roll. 

The crunchy salmon roll was bland, although the fish tasted fresh. I would have liked more flavor in the roll, considering it was one of the more expensive rolls from the menu. 

The beef skewers were not well marinated and slightly overcooked; the pieces were lacking that delicious ""juiciness"" I usually expect from beef skewers.  Perhaps I should have told the waiter too keep it "" medium rare"" on the grill. My biggest discontent with the beef skewers was the presence of many fat pieces accompanying the meat within the beef. My jaw couldn't handle the back and forth of such pieces, and I was forced to discard them : (

The interior designing seems inviting, although I didn't understand the wall paper selection. The seating on the periphery of the dining hall was set up with booth seating. The center of the hall had used tables and chair pieces as seating options. This sitting combination was confusing.

The service was 4/5. I was slightly confused when we had several waiters approach us at different times to ask us what we would like to order. I, like most customers, would appreciate a more seamless ( and non-redudant) service.

Overall, I wish I had tried their Chinese menu selections. Perhaps they cook their Chinese dishes better.

One thing I did really enjoy: Their huge advertising sign in the parking lot. You could see it at least half a mile ahead of you if you are on the street.

1781301,2015-01-26,8,xgrUl5uWTCexTGEWDrVqcg,"Holy overpriced mediocrity, Batman! This place is horrendously overpriced- just like Panini Cafe, this restaurant tries to take advantage of the lack of Kosher restaurants in town by jacking up the prices and putting out mediocrity. 

$8 Matzo ball soup is the size most places call a CUP of soup, except it's also twice the price here. Bagel Cafe's version is easily three times the size, more flavor, better quality. Portion was bland broth, matzo, two pieces of carrots and a bite of overcooked noodles. BF enjoys the light flavors of Kosher food, but even he can't justify the outrageous pricing- this should be half the price that it is.
$11 house shwarma wrap was also okay, but the meat was underseasoned- wrap on pita contained a bland smear of hummus, a few pieces of cucumber and tomato, and a generous amount of the chicken. Too bad only the bottom half of the wrap had any flavor, where the ingredients all mixed together. 

If you aren't required to keep Kosher, I can think of no reason you'd come here. Entrees sound halfway decent, but they are nearly all a flat $25 with some going as high as $38. I'm aware that Kosher restaurants are limited, but when you're considered overpriced in a city FULL of overpriced restaurants, you at least need to have the quality to back it up.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,4,2,6wqXfqR1lAQcaFu31RT4Gw

There's no need to compromise standards just because you are Kosher. It's the only place in Vegas with Kosher Chinese food and if you are vegetarian just let them know and they will make you a dish that's not even on the menu yet. There is a party room available for your own private gatherings which is perfect size for a sheva brachot for example. There's a small children's menus and nice clean high chairs for the little ones. Some of the booths are arranged in round circles just nice for a family. Very convenient for guests staying near the strip but also for the locals as well.

Pros:

They had kibbeh - It's already hard to find this on most menus but this was a must order for me when I saw it on the menu.

The sides were great - We had our whole table ranting and raving about how good the sides were and it got us really excited for the meal ahead of us.

Service - It was great and the staff were really attentive.

Cons

Heat Issues - Some of our food came out cold (this was the case for some of the aforementioned kibbeh) and I heard ssimilar comments from other tables while we were there. I'm going to go ahead and suspecct that a lot of our meals were reheated.

Butchering - They either butcher in house or they have a terrible butcher (for chicken at least). I had pieces of cartilage on my skewer of chicken which I found annoying to eat.

Pricing - I found the pricing a bit higher than what I'm accustomed to, even for a kosher restaurant.

Hamburgers misplaced? - This is more me nitpicking on the menu. But I found it a little surprising that the Hamburger was put under ""Mediterranean Classic"". I would have assumed that it would have bee under sandwiches.

Chinese/Israeli? - It's not even fusion. It's just 2 different food offerings that I'm not 100% certain why there are 2 different cuisines available. But if it works, who am I to judge?

The food is good here. but the heating concerns alone are a larger enough to be wary of this place. I'll definitely give it another try because the food did taste good and the staff were so friendly and accommodating. I just can't give it a higher one until a few things are changed.",vCbYnQ0DdpHb-vGRZVMkxg,0,0,2,kkwsbPnTsWAf6jIGG22uIA

5093391,2015-02-28,3,xgrUl5uWTCexTGEWDrVqcg,"I ate at this place last night.
When I was trying to figure out why I go out to restaurants, I decided that the service alone can sometimes be the difference between a good and bad review. 
I mean, if the type of food, quality of food, potion size, and prices are roughly the same between two restaurants, then you're left with atmosphere and service.
Well, the service in this place was very poor. 
Conservatively, I would say that it took 7 requests (to multiple waiters), before we could place our order.
And the hostess ended up taking it.
The place was virtually empty (customers at 4 tables out of 25.)
The ratio of servers to tables was basically 1:1.
At one point the servers were playing with the lights, clicking them on and off, oblivious to how annoying that was.
The only reason I gave 2 stars was because of the hostess and the food (which was fine but not great.)
If this place looks at their Yelp reviews, I want them to know that this review is not personal, it's objective.
I know that they are a new restaurant (and one block away from a serious competitor).
I am merely suggesting what they should consider changing in order for them to be more successful.",TP84hS-tDZGv0vEDSowrxQ,7,1,2,Yc9gNsnG-V2WVbpQLlt0Eg

When we arrived, we were the only ones in the restaurant, we ordered the number of things were not available even though they were on the menu. We ordered the Moroccan soup which was great, but the mains which were primarily Chinese food and hummus platters were so salty they were nearly inedible. Upon getting our bill we realized that every price was different than it was on the menu, when asking for clarification the owner explained that he up charged for all of the things which are listed on the menu but have no prices. The result was a bill nearly 30% above sticker price without a single caveat or price listed anywhere on their menu or from the server.
My wife grabbed a menu to compare prices at which point the owner got combative and forced her to give back the menus. The owner at that point took away our bill not allowing us to pay while screaming across the restaurant in front of the few tables which had come in at this point.
We remembered the inflated belt price and simply pay that in cash just to get out of there, but in many years of eating at kosher restaurants this was by far the most inappropriate, uncomfortable and ridiculously negative experience I have ever seen.

But lets start from the top, we were a party of 3 in the afternoon, the place is nearly empty, other then us there are only 2 other occupied tables, we were seated and the waitress came over to take our order, skimming thru the menu was followed by a sticker shock, holy moly...just about %40 more then any other ""equivalent"". joint around town.
Ow well, lets order, we ordered one Humus plate, assorted salad plate and a ""schnitzel"", came with pita bread., we also ordered water.
First problem: the food arrived before the drinks, fail #1 
The Humus was ok, the salads were mainly ok, (the eggplant salad had a weird taste and was  left in the plate, the schnitzel was liked ($20)
As we were done with our food we set....(fail #2).and set until I got up and asked the greeter where the waitress was/is, we discovered that she left but there is a waiter (haven't seen him so far), any way, the greeter brought us the check, we paid and took off.
Conclusion:
1. Nice place and the fanciest Kosher joint in Vegas
2. The food is OK, I tasted nothing out of the ordinary (other then the eggplant)
3  service needs improvement, pronto. What is the norm in Tel Aviv does not work in the western world folks! get with the program.
4. The prices are out of sight.

But of coerce.....and with my experience with different Kosher joints around the nation, non of my revue matters, nothing will be changes and the norm will remain, with captured audience you don't need excellence, you can afford to be mediocre and expensive, its not like they have anywhere else to go in a 5 mile radius.

PS, The booths are extremely tight, if you are over size 32(pants) ask for a table of suffer.",KCwfAJkgpi3-J1Es1qlLyg,2,0,3,wts8_U6ymQGgFjHXRYHeSQ

We were asking for 4 schnitzel (milanesa) baguettes ,one of the schnitzel baguette we ask without spicy in it , and one of the other schnitzel baguette we ask to remove the vegetables that supposed to come with it and serve it separate in a plastic container or something .

We wore asking for 2 chicken thigh baguettes , 
And chicken nuggets for the kids..

We were asking for ketchup mayonnaise and mustard and also to add some side salads and we will pay for it occurs .

The representative on the line  Took all the  orders and said that the delivery would cost $20.

We agreed  and double confirm the order when the delivery guy arrive to the MGM Hotel he gave us the bags with the food inside and left..
I took the order upstairs to the room and was surprised to find out that there is no ketchup no mayonnaise no mustard no salads no vegetables that was supposed to be separated from the schnitzel  baguette.
We called again in order to receive the rest of the order but instead of getting it we were surprised to find out that one of the owners I believe was talking to us in a very rude way saying: 
""if you want the ketchup mayonnaise and mustard you need to pay another $20 for the delivery that they forgot to put in, and regarding the baguette with the vegetables that supposed to be separated he said that there is no vegetables (salad) supposed to be added to it...""

It's so nervous that you're trying to keep kosher and the options are limited and you finding that people like them taking advantage on those people...

I know for sure that Genesis is out of the question of where we going to eat at....
The food was average
The fries was wet, nothing was hot actually not even warm.. One of the begets that we asked not to have spicy came with spicy...

Strongly not recommended!!!!!

P.s
One of the workers said that the owner doesn't really care about the yelp page.",wvKnpT3JVbKR6ExQohyMng,2,0,1,fMwk6S7XA7hPYIN4F6VV5w
