1208494,2018-06-17,0,RSPEJeFTKs1BsiVgjHp1WQ,"Spago has transformed the former Olives into a beautiful bright modern space. The view to the outside is more visible and the patio is completely covered. No more boiling in the hot sun!

Decided to sit at the bar & order from the bar menu. We had the Spicy Tuna Tartare &  the Vegas Golden Knights Pizza.. Both were excellent. The tuna was tucked into sesame miso cones that just melted in your mouth. The pizza was topped with spicy shrimp, roasted tomato, jalapeños, pesto & cheese. I did not find it spicy but I like things pretty hot so not sure if I'm a good judge of normal spicy. However, it was delicious. 

Spago is a great new addition to Bellagio & we definitely will be retuning.",8Ox2EA8A7FVSzVEM3TRn7Q,2,1,5,wOHHuizk3NYn5W1mkDqzhw

2274334,2018-07-01,1,RSPEJeFTKs1BsiVgjHp1WQ,"Oh my goodness. I mean, like damn. Our meal and drinks were so good. I technically could end this right here, but I'll say a little more just for GP (general purpose).  

We got to Vegas in the early afternoon, but wanted to get checked in at the room and conference before we started to relax.  At the Bellagio, there are so many options, but Spago had just opened and boyfriend said he had a great experience some years ago in Palo Alto. 

We got there at 445, when they were preparing for dinner, but still serve customers with a reduced menu (e.g. bar menu). Even on a reduced menu, they had a selection of seafood: west or east coast oysters, poached prawns, main lobster rolls, as well as bar favs: wings and prime rib burger, and sweet twists on pizza: lamb sausage and brocolini and one with shrimp. We got four different items and it was all da bomb! 

I'm not a big drinker. I can literally nurse 1 drink for the night. This night, I had two. I know! A margarita and one called, Out on the Tiles. Now, my margi was good, but that specialty drink was delicious. 

We were sitting across from the bar. So we had a great view, and video, if I might say,  of the fountains. It's going to look spectacular at night. The ambiance is also cool, Nuevo, and. Chic, but welcoming. 

I can't end this without talking about the absolute outstanding service we received from Dominique, Our server, and Jenny, who made sure we were never parched. Good food is worth your dollars. Great service is worth your time. I would certainly spend the time, again and again to return to Spago. Thank you for a great experience.",uSITaAr_V4kJtZA-pj83aw,0,0,5,iARPNYBkRiquFLCnrz5csQ

I've been there three times now, and the food is fantastic, the service is exceptional, and the brightness of the new space is wonderful. Definitely try the Tuna Tartare and the Sweet Corn Agnolotti! And the Kaiserschmarren dessert is heavenly. Still my favorite restaurant in Vegas!",TKSz4Fe0w_Iv75mRvSOQ6Q,1,1,5,g8VusLDd1O_qO3bj2uJgHg

A special shout out to Carla who made our experience even more amazing by sitting us at the best table with the most incredible view of the Bellagio fountains. Everything from the hostess to wait staff, the food, and the drinks; made it such a great experience and we will definitely be coming back again!!",XpsuMlfva0YIVyRgwiA5pA,2,1,5,EUwq_UzcUfeLNLUs6Pv00A
3515238,2018-06-19,1,RSPEJeFTKs1BsiVgjHp1WQ,Made reservations over 1 month ago.  Placed request for patio close to edge to see fountain show.  Checked in with hostess kiersten 30 minutes early and stated we had reservations and showed up early so that they can fulfill request.  She abruptly said she will do best that can be done but to return half an hour later.  Returned waited another 30 minutes and they finally sat us down in patio but furthest away from fountain and no view of show .  Asked for manager and Leo shows up in a snooty tone and extremely rude.  Stating this is best we have when they were 2 empty tables with nobody sitting there close to fountain show.  Nobody is helpful here and extremely rude.  Will never return.  Stay away unless you like to be spoken to rudely.,lqCBBLDyau2ASvcVewKHmA,1,0,1,oIWxwW5rHvCwUxoekApX4g
3596827,2018-06-16,0,RSPEJeFTKs1BsiVgjHp1WQ,"Well done.

Competing with memories of both Spago (Caesar's) and Olives, this is a nice marriage of the two.

We popped in for a quick lunch, and enjoyed both the food and the views.  For Olives fans, the outdoor space has been covered, so it's a bit more comfortable in the June noon heat, and the interior views are more expansive.  For Spago fans,  the menu is evolving, but you can see the threads from prior visits.

Nice wine selection, service was spot on, lunch menu had lots of options. 

Well worth another visit.",jHHRH62tCYNZnh85uMzkJg,1,0,5,olSjBPlAbYxjTorsrQPMXA

The bar is well stocked and all of the servers were attentive.

4352916,2018-06-08,4,RSPEJeFTKs1BsiVgjHp1WQ,"Went here the day it opened and I was so excited to try it out, based on it's reputation. I had the salmon pizza and it is one of the worst things I have ever tasted in my life. The little salmon eggs were super salty and I just couldn't stomach the extreme heaviness of the dill spread on the pizza. No thank you! When I looked at the rest of the menu, nothing else looked appealing. I only tried that one item, so who knows about the rest of the food, but for me personally, I won't bother going back.",Tr-dCb5zhOEPJ1LGYFTXIw,0,0,1,dRT2aJTqy06gdqi9VauI0w
5026645,2018-06-09,1,RSPEJeFTKs1BsiVgjHp1WQ,"So disappointed.  We've been loyal Spago customers for years, and we were so excited for the new location.  When we approached the hostess stand we were informed that they no longer offer a full menu all day, and that they won't seat outside at certain hours.  We looked at the bleak bar menu and opted to go back to Ceaser's.  We miss the old Spago's and have no desire to return.  Bummer.",W_quPWC1gsCsdibwcstB7g,2,0,1,za21EVF-n8gfBDy45FgMuw
5094805,2018-07-01,8,RSPEJeFTKs1BsiVgjHp1WQ,"The most affordable eatery with a front row seat to the Fountains of Bellagio.

A comfortable, contemporary dining space where every table offers views of the fountains.  The outdoor patio, is shaded.  Use of mature greenery creates a great ambiance.

The food; corporate restaurateur, prettied up Puck.   Solid food, dramatic presentation.  Nothing too out there. Good quality, seasonal, fresh ingredients combined in familiar ways.

The best example and the standout, sweet corn agnolotti.  Toothsome pasta filled with a sweet, creamy corn purée dressed with sage butter more kernels of sweet corn and shavings of pecorino Romano to add salinity. A perfect expression of summer.

The spicy tuna tartare served in a sesame miso cracker cone, good.  Wasabi and pickle ginger are mixed with the ahi.  Tobiko (flying fish roe), daikon strings. and radish sprouts make for great garnish that adds texture and peppery notes.  Difficult to eat as the cone crumbles, but all around tasty.

Pizza, a Spago mainstay, is agreeable if you're into Cali style.  The crust, well seasoned,  very glutinous, chewy, thick, well blistered.  Zero complaints on the cold smoked salmon pizza with dill cream and sweet and onions.  The addition of ikura (salmon roe) on each slice adds a burst of salinity and oceanic goodness.   Refreshing.  In sharp contrast, the Las Vegas golden knights pizza delivers spicy, bold flavors.   herbaceous pesto, oven roasted tomatoes and spicy kick and pronounced chili flavor of jalapeños contrasting with sweet and surprisingly not over cooked shrimp.

Interesting craft cocktail program. Typical Vegas resort Mark up.

Friendly service with some hiccups. It's a new restaurant, that is to be expected.

Sometimes you want a lobster with drawn butter, not butter poached with cat spit essence of the sea foam and caviar.  Come for a solid dining experience and to be entertained by the fountains of Bellagio and you won't be disappointed.  Food snob?  Pass.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,12,12,4,BjNKPZIaiz3OZfnQ97QIKA

If you prefer air conditioning, the floor to ceiling windows will not disappoint either. It's like Spago was always meant to be at Bellagio.",See00dpRtW9-Ah2a22SEWQ,5,3,5,yaVqs_FqTacZrGPABRmYQQ

5969537,2018-06-12,0,RSPEJeFTKs1BsiVgjHp1WQ,"We're on the quiet upscale side of the Bellagio Hotel away from the swarm of people and activity near the casino.  Our goal was to find a quiet, satisfying lunch in the heart of pandemonium. We heard that Spago at Bellagio had opened just about a week ago and had to give the place a test drive.  After a courteous introduction with their front staff, we were seated in their bar area. Brand new dark brown leather seats and solid tables gave off a feeling of cool, modernity and luxury that got our appetite going. 

We order the chicken wings (just 6 pieces) which were incredible. Following our first dish, we moved on to the burger and lobster roll black squid ink brioche. The burger was just amazing.  A burger this good has to be called something other than ""burger"" to do it justice. How about ""Le Holy Cow.""  Stay with me. The lobster roll was an infusion of wonderful lobster accentuated with a subtle squid base presenting a perfect combination.  

Glenn, our server, was professional, exceptionally knowledgeable and attentive in ensuring that we had a fabulous dining experience.  A wonderful dining adventure awaits you here at Spago.  Pass it on.",OsLT2fY6ss81jOVUbSyWhQ,4,2,5,64unBksKuveTPVj_cxo7Og
