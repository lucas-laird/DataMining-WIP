Janice is the bartender then and she gives the best service like everyone is VIP. Lot's of different games and machines to choose. I like the variety because I get bored playing the same game and like to jump around different games.,8X9U8hkh_OcVoHzCLeoT7g,0,1,5,MRNliD8WKqnUPfNOIrz-fQ

I got my ass handed to me on some music history by said bartender and some of the other patrons. They weren't dicks about it, and I appreciate anyone who can learn me some. I also met some notable musicians who have had some admirable influence in rock history. Overall a good and unexpected night.

Worth going back.",ixg9slI38gXsxT3CCfhU_A,2,2,5,mbTWifjxrmA9RBvC9YlOfQ

Totally disappointed at the changes that happen between August and now.  They used to have great hookah, that was well priced and great staff...",2OWK7zdoP_gdXBp9hmpqmA,0,0,1,8a6R0Fp9O2bclJWFfHrl2Q

This place was pretty clean and nice, not too rundown.  The bartender was very sympathetic and unaware of the windstorm conditions outside so I pointed it out to him and he got the idea!  

As always, a very tempting video poker machine was right in front of me where I sat and although I have to admit that it was tempting to play, I knew I wasn't going to stay long so I finished my beer and headed out.

I guess it was fate that I never planned to come in here if it weren't for those Nevada swirling wind conditions!",V5Th21KjUiYLJQyV-vGtpg,2,1,3,jbCeS2z1fTavqk57jbOZkg

Prohibition is a recently remodeled bar thats trying to go for the prohibition era/speakeasy style which is popping up a lot around Vegas. Some friends and I decided to stop by to check out their hookah menu and grab a few drinks.

When we came in the place was dead, maybe one or two other people in there. The inside looks like a typical sports bar with some leather accents and 1920s-esque posters on the wall. The bartender was nice and recommended a few drinks. None were that impressive and at $5 for a beer I'd rather go elsewhere. The hookah was nothing more than a overpriced disappointment. $20 for a poorly made flavorless bowl which quickly tasted like ash. Not really worth coming back to.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,4,2,2,aU1Tsz-ZHO-aKEXn2eThyg
3359937,2014-07-13,0,ojQJWz5U_UHZV3h4oGc0XQ,This place is awesome! Great location minutes away from the strip. Drinks are always cold and the staff tend to every need and are vary social. I Love the fact that they have TVs and comfortable booths. Drink prices make me wanna drink again and really affordable. I really really like the fact that they have Hookah 24 hours no place on the strip with this environment has hookah. The art work and design gives me a feel of comfort and makes you think of the prohibition times. They definitely put allot of hard work in bringing the culture into Las Vegas which this city needs. Every one that goes says this place just sucks you in you never wanna leave great environment gave this place 5 stars because that's truly what it deserves awesome awesome awesome awesome go for happy hour thank me later :) see ya there!!!!,5HjPIukiMmh3rZf1iqI1cQ,3,1,5,LGhisDL1bx45mdJs391Skg

Found out the guy who makes the hookah used to work at Olive so he knows what he's doing . Hooked up a cool mix for me to try out . Good craft beer selection too! My bartender's name was Krista and she was amazing ! Great personality and great bartender. I will def be back.,EzjLARgz3Jmb4L1t3lBy1A,0,0,4,nF5zM8__K_7g0H8pADSklw
