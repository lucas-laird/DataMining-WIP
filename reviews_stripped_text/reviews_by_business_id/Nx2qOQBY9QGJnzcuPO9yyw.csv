We go there specifically for the grilled cheese and cheeseburger, which are some of the best we've found in town!  My husband and I were both born and raised here, so we've tried it all and Decatur Drug Diner is a great place for lunch and dinner.  We haven't tried breakfast yet, but have heard it is good.  Great for pick up too and they do except credit cards even though the website says they don't.",pBFuc1UlRozPQHyzOpuR5Q,1,2,5,aIKT9GtQgi95Km1Aqs7Qnw

Don't expect a quick lunch because Grandma is your server and doesn't enjoy the hustle and bustle.",lbJd5Rg7_7DXar9FEIg-Nw,1,2,3,Q8PrVLL3vrqmqlXEhIbMIA

Like Tiffany's http://www.yelp.com/biz/tiffanys-las-vegas but without cirque like acrobatics behind the counter and the quick wit of Alice's Flo or urgency of time. If you're below the age of a social security check recipient, don't expect to be known. But the place has a Cheer's like atmosphere where everybody knows everyone else's name.
It's a cash only place that serves comfort food and is definitely a regulars hang out. The people a crazy nice and the food is well, comforting. Attached is one of my favorite bars Decatur Liquor and you can't beat the price. It's not 24 hrs but is good stop when you are near.",ixg9slI38gXsxT3CCfhU_A,0,0,3,GohpmDjHvJ3BZd9ZD6yzCw
2529523,2014-10-15,2,Nx2qOQBY9QGJnzcuPO9yyw,Came here for breakfast waiting to get my haircut at the barber close by. The guy who cooked my food just touched a bunch of money and didn't bother to wash his hands. The bacon looked over a week old and the potatoes looked a few days old as well.,6DLbgqTCRDRhizvzJ0TWvg,0,0,1,GFIlcVqw3L3vwLbrbkIx2g
