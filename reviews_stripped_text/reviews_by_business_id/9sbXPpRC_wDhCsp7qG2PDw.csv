After a few visits from different trips, their flavors were always a little subpar their neighbors in the area. The cuisine was mainly Cantonese style.  Seafood seems fresh, but the seasoning was a bit off.  The nighttime discount menu items were about the same in prices compared to other restaurants in the area that does similar promotion.  Most of their dishes were on the bland side.  The benchmark dish, beef chow fun was on the oily side. 

HK Seafood Garden can be a good place to visit if your option late at night were limited.  The restaurant also caters to tour buses, which is a sign of mediocre.

Most restaurants off the strip are closed, but my brother looks on yelp and finds HK Seafood Garden. Looks like they are open til 6am and have midnight snack. They also serve the regular dinner menu. 

We arrive at the parking lot to see the darkened doors and are confused to if they are closed or opened. We then see a few patrons exit from the restaurant and there is ""LIGHT""! So we exit our van and enter. We are sat down at a table and notice our surroundings. There is minimal Chinese decorations from a wide art painting and then some hanging decorations. We order 3 dishes to start; Dry Beef Chow Fun, Wonton Noodle Soup, and Clay Pot Rice with Chinese Sausages. The first two were good. The show case which was the Clay Pot Rice was the best. It's definitely hard to find clay pot rice at a Chinese restaurant, but when you do.. it's definitely worth it. It took 45 mins to cook and wow!! The flavours and texture is just beyond words. I recommend ordering the clay pot rice here. Towards the end of our meal, a small party walks in and orders some congee with oysters. My mom was interested and ordered the same congee. When it came to our table; we could smell the oysters and ginger from the congee. This will be great! And to our judgment; it was spectacular!

I met a friend for a business lunch there last week.  When I arrived at the restaurant, I was the second customer in the whole place.  My friend joined me about 15 minutes later.  We place our order and we waited forever for our food to arrive.  I asked the waiter several times about our order.  Many other customers came in, ordered, ate and left before we got our food.  

I had ordered Buddah's delight and asked them to just throw some shrimp in it for me so there would be no carbs.  My friend ordered Kung Pao Chicken.  What they brought me was some kind of seafood delight with noodles in it saturated in sauce.  I was trying to avoid the carbs.  It was good and I ate it anyway because there was no way we had time to send it back.

Every other time I have eaten here the food was amazing and the service was good also.

There were also dirty wares stored as clean including colanders, knives, bowls, and a raw fish scaler.

Inspectors noted repeat non-compliance with the rules.

Inspectors saw a food handler spread contamination by rinsing dirty hands over defrosting food in the prep sink. They were using plastic t-shirt bags, including one from Phantom Fireworks, for holding open meat.

The white folks I know seem to be pretty divided on whether it's a good thing or a bad thing when the vast majority of the patrons of a restaurant order food in a language other than English.  One camp argues that the food is more authentic in these establishments.  The other group is downright scared.  With that in mind, some of my friends would be terrified...but don't worry... HK Seafood Garden has a welcoming staff, they serve several American friendly dishes such as Sweet and Sour Chicken, and they'll even offer you a fork if you seem out of place.

I recently came in with a group that ordered entirely in Chinese....The best part was that one of individuals from our table took it upon themselves to walk back to the kitchen, check the cleanliness, and later returned after we ordered to let the chef know not to mess up our order.  

If you ask for it, they will bring out house soup for your table.  HK has one of the better versions of this soup that I've tried.

I've enjoyed most of what I've shared here a great deal.  Some of my favorites include:
Scallops with string beans in spicy xo sauce!
Ong Choy w/ Bean Curd
House Special Stir Fried Thick Noodle
ChaoZhou Shrimp
Whole Fried Fish
Dried Scallop & Mushroom w/ Snow Pea Leaf


The group agreed that this is one of the best places in Vegas for HK style Chinese food.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,11,9,4,wn6iiYcr2FKrIGbTzx1tyQ

However that was the only thing that occurred quickly when we were there.  They had two waitresses and a busboy working.  We grabbed the menus ourselves.  We also noticed other customers getting their menus, utensils, plates and tea because the waitresses were so busy.   It took us over 30 minutes to get our orders in and another 30 minutes to get our first dishes.  The dishes came intermittently and at the end we had to inquire about our three other dishes.   Apparently the chef (I think there was only one) forgot to cook them.  Fortunately we were not in any rush to go elsewhere that afternoon otherwise we would have been really late.   I believe we were there for over two and a half hours.  The food was good on par with the other Cantonese restaurants in the Spring Mountain Road area.

Being able to order from the lunch menu after 10 pm is a clear selling point for me. $7.50 or less for each dish, plus they give generous sharing sized portions is unheard of and an extreme bargain!

Ok, so maybe we ordered a little too much for the both of us. But, we honestly didn't expect the portions to be so generous! Next time, one item and possibly an appetizer or soup would be more than enough. 

Here's what we ordered:
General Chow's chicken $7.50 (flavor rating 4/5)
Hong Kong style crispy noodles $7.50 (flavor rating 3/5)
Eggplant with garlic sauce pot $7.50 (flavor rating 3/5)
Veggie egg rolls $5.50 (flavor rating 2/5)

Out of everything we ordered, the General Chow's chicken was the most flavorful. The rest of the dishes we're sort of lacking seasoning and flavor. They were not excellent and they were not disgusting, I would say they were average. The value and the amount of food they give you is the reason to keep coming back!

To start off, we were only given one menu... with a party of 4. I know we're in an economic crisis right now, but really, one menu? Anyways, we proceeded to catch a waiter/waitress so we could order our dishes (waiters/waitresses were just wandering around the restaurant as if they were clueless), we ordered Half a chicken, Garlic Baby Bok Choy, Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, and a Tofu dish (We asked the server what kind of ingredients were in this tofu dish, and he stated ""tofu"", GEE thanks! I would've never guessed!) Once our order was taken, if your bill exceeds I think 40 dollars, you get a free side, obviously our bill exceeded 40 dollars, but nope, this stingy ""restaurant"" didn't even mention a free side, and we always got a free side every time we went.

When we got our Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, Half a chicken and Garlic Baby Bok Choy, we knew something was missing. They forgot the complementary soup! Every Asian Restaurant comes with a bowl of complementary soup! Every table got soup but us! (Note that this place wasn't even busy, service was just lazy).

Onto the dishes, the half chicken came first. It was very rough and chewy. The chicken had obviously been sitting around for a couple hours if not days.

Our next dish was the Garlic Baby Bok Choy. We've ordered this dish many times from various places, and it's a rather simple, yet satisfying vegetable dish. When the Bok Choy came... it was just horrific. As I was eating, one of my family members found bits and pieces of shrimp lurking within the center of the dish. If I remember correctly we ordered garlic baby bok choy, not bok choy with a special surprise in the center.

Moving on, our Salt & Pepper Pork Chops arrived. It was extremely greasy, very chewy, and some pieces were mostly just fried pieces of fat.

Now you're probably questioning why I didn't review the tofu dish, simply the fact is that we canceled that order as it came to us. My family and I are always up to try something different on a menu, but when we asked the waiter what ingredients are in this tofu dish and all he stated was ""tofu"", it's a bit shady. I'm actually glad we canceled the dish because when it came out, it was all soup and one or two colossal chunks of tofu drifting in the center.

To top it all off, I was excited to get my dessert! Oh wait, the waiters and waitresses forgot, just like how they forgot our free side and soup. 

My family and I have been to this restaurant numerous times, and we can understand the occasional accidents, we're only human. When stuff like this happens, it's sure to piss a family like us off, especially when we tip around 20%.

At first I was seated at a table on one side of the restaurant but then one of the servers came and told me the table was too close to one of the large round tables and moved me to a similar table right next to another large round table that had a large number of people there.

It was after 6 PM but I was also given a lunch menu along with the regular menu.  They didn't have iced tea so I just asked for water.  After being moved, I was brought a pot of tea with my water and I ended up having two servers.  I ordered the scallops that were under the House Specialties section.  My server didn't understand what I wanted so I told her the number.  That didn't work either and she took the menu from me and started looking through the pages.  I gently got the menu back and showed her the correct item.  I also asked about a cup of soup but she indicated their soup was only large bowls.  I guess maybe if I had ordered a lunch special, I could have gotten a smaller portion.

A different server then took over and he spoke English.  He brought my dinner and asked if there was anything else I needed.  The scallops were on a bed of crispy seaweed that made a great counterpoint to the flavor of the soy based sauce in which the scallops were wok fried.  They bring you a large bowl of rice.  The menu showed a red pepper next to the dish indicating it was spicy.  It wasn't.  Maybe I got the non-Asian version because the server also brought me a fork before my dinner came.

I did like my dinner but if I come back here, I'll snag one of my Asian friends to order for me and make sure the dish is spicy.  This would be a four star if the ordering had been easier and if the dish was spicier than it was.

On a side note--this was a Saturday night and while I was there, a mini-bus pulled up and 5 of the large round tables were filled with tourists who are taken from the Strip to Chinatown for their dinners.  The place filled quickly and became quite noisy.

The menu is quite extensive and there are other dishes I'd like to try.  It'd be a great place to get a group together and share dishes.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,7,8,3,b2DMhKtrHF51q9bcMBeilw

As we sat down, I started to recall that the name had come up as a decent choice for late night eats in particular. The presence of the ""lunch special"" menus on our plates jogged my memory - this was a place where you could get cheap eats even late at night.

After perusing the extensive lunch specials menu and failing to locate the one ""premium"" dish that I would have wanted, I settled on the cheap $5.50 beef chow fun, and I chose gravy vs. dry when asked. The dish looked promising, but the most impressive part ended up being the combination of the huge portion with the low price. Everything in it - beef, broad flat noodles, and bok choy - was massively underseasoned, as if it were pad see ew but without the flavor. Sure, you could add soy sauce, but it wasn't already present at the table, and I declined to ask because the lone server was stretched and because I was planning to take the bulk of it to-go.

Speaking of which, the service was understandably slow because the one guy (who can speak Vietnamese, which is a plus for this neighborhood) was working up to six tables when we were there. This may not be the late night restaurant of your dreams for that reason. However, if you have nowhere else to be, then it's not all that bad.

I did end up sprucing up my leftovers to an edible extent, but even though the portion was great, I won't be in a hurry to come back to HF Seafood Garden. The Vietnamese restaurant next door is way better, and I'm not usually around here late at night anyway.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,4,3,3,KHlDV3GOVKuWZBqJqRfF0A

The veggies are good, and there was one more dish that blew my mind away. Check out my photos, and you'll see the comments on what it was. 
I'd come back here for sure if I'm craving a sit-down, better flavor version of Panda Express. Eh, maybe that's insulting to the business, but, you get my drift.

Late night Special Review: 
For you late night diners like me, you appreciate places that open late. Here's a tip, After 10pm ask for the Lunch Menu. Its a special they have after 10pm you can order anything off the lunch menu, which is exactly like the dinner menu except for half the price. Dinner entree's range from $12-15 but off the lunch menu after 10pm everything's about $7.50.

Food:
So if your eating Chinese its always accustom to share, My friend Yuhi & I after an intense work out decided to ruin it by eating greasy Chinese food (Why not LOL). 

Egg Plant and Tofu: 
Super hearty, the fried tofu was crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside. The eqq plant was juicy and soft. Glad the skin of the eqq plant didn't feel like plastic. It practically melted in your mouth.

Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs:
I'm a die heart fan of Chinese pork ribs, not just any old sweet and sour pork. I special ordered it as pork ribs. The cooked pork with the in bone ribs adds a smokey flavor the the sweet and sour and just brings the flavors together in a sticky sweet and sour sauce. They garnish the place with big chunks of green pepper. onions and with a twist pineapples.

The food was all good. Or maybe we were all just uber hungry from our four-hour alternative fitness session.

Hong Kong style pan-fried noodle. Pork spare ribs. Salty fish hot pot. Salt and pepper fried shrimp. Hot and sour soup. Beef chow fun. All that fed the five of us for a measly $40 with tax.

4669607,2010-07-12,2,9sbXPpRC_wDhCsp7qG2PDw,"A place with a really similar menu to the venerable HK Star. They fail to execute the dishes as eloquently and inexpensively as HK Star. Located across the street from Ichiza and right next to (Pho) Kinh Do! 

I came here with a tougher critic than me believe it or not, my Mom on a Sunday evening. No one else was in here, not a good sign.

@ Soup - Included in the meal. Was good, on par with the stuff at HK Star.

@ Shrimp Tofu - The tofu was good. I saw the shrimp, but couldn't really taste the shrimp at all since it was overpowered by the tofu. Just get the regular tofu next time.

@ Sizzling Beef - This came out sizzling on a plate. While this was a good item, it was sauced fairly heavy and a little more on the salty side. Food Express got this dish right.

@ Bi Fung Tong Seabass - My favorite dish at HK Star. Even though HK Star uses frozen seabass in their dish, this place doesn't taste as fresh as them. It just lacks the spicy kick that HK Star offers. Not a bad dish overall, but could be a lot better.

@ Roast Duck - This duck was so bad, I recommend going to Sam Woo to get your ducks, and I recommend against going to Sam Woo entirely in the past! In all fairness, HK Star has fairly bad reviews on their duck as well. It lacked the nice crispy skin and firm meat that makes duck so unhealthy to eat, but oh so good.

@ Thai Ice Tea - It was whatever. I've tasted much better stuff before. 

@ Carrot Desert - It was a carrot dessert soup. I was full, so I opted out of it. It is included in the meal. 

Lobster is $10 a pound, $1.12 more than HK Star. Across the board, everything is about the same or a couple of bucks more than HK Star, but nothing too terribly expensive. They also have a $5 and $6 lunch special menu like HK Star. 

This place seems to have a wide selection of ChaoZhou dishes. Upon further research, this type of cuisine tends to have healthier seafood and veggie dishes than other Chinese cuisine. They tend to go less on flavoring, letting the ingredients speak for themselves. A similar philosophy to Japanese food. Whether this place actually follows this philosophy, I can't confirm.

This place is fairly new, having been here for 5 months. This place is NOT related to HK Star in anyway, despite the similar menu and name. The inside feels cheap with all the fans in there. But the best chinese restaurants are notorious for not looking nice inside!

Service is really iffy. In terms of getting food out, they're not as fast as HK Star. Since its only a couple of mintues slower, its still reasonable for the dishes. The waitress there speaks mainly Chinese and very little English, so there may be language barriers to those who only speak English. 

They have 2 promotions where  if you spend $38+ you get a free vermicilli dish and if you spend $55+ you get a free ~1.5lb crab. This was cool and all, but the waitress could have just answered my question of how much I needed to spend to get to $38. She was asking me if I wanted soda or thai ice tea, implying it was free. I got charged for it. When I asked her about, she says oh, its to get you to $38 to get a free item. Just tell me that I need like $3 more to get there and I'll pick my own item. Uncool to do it in a sneaky way like that. I was able to get a duck instead of the vermicilli dish with a little social engineering.  

I only came here because I'm a food whore and I like to check out my other options, despite HK Star being very good to me. I guess I'll be put my head in shame as I walk back into HK Star to ask forgiveness.

You would only come here if you factor out HK Star or wanted ChaoZhou dishes. HK Star is better than this place in every way, price, taste, and service. The only thing this has over HK Star is its more tourist/ East-side friendly since its closer to the strip and open till 3am for our late night eaters.

You don't have veggie egg rolls? You can't make veggie egg rolls?

You can't conjure some fried wonton shells?

You don't offer fried rice without egg?

Crispy noodles with seafood - the noodles and veggies were good, but I found the calamari a bit fishy.

General Chicken - this was actually really tasty. It was prepared in a way that reminds me more of sweet and pungent than most places Tso's and has a nice light crisp to it. 
Salt and Pepper Shrimp - these were cooked to a crisp to where you can eat the shell and all. I can eat a lot of these.

We also ordered a hot & sour soup, eggplant w/ tofu pot (my favorite!), and HK-style seafood chow mein. *yum*",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,10,7,4,mc48h7JgYslywQ9L4yvWgg

Portions are big and they give out free soup and dessert as well!!!


Definitely get the razor clams!!!!!

5139359,2013-09-17,0,9sbXPpRC_wDhCsp7qG2PDw,"Just like everyone else is saying, this is a great place to eat late!

You get to order off the lunch menu after 10pm!  You HAVE to ask for the ""late night specials"" though, and they will hand you a lunch menu instead.  Most of the prices are under $7.50 for great food and portions :)

First up, the Salt and Pepper Shrimp ($7.50 HH). Great S&P Shrimp! Maybe a tiny bit overcooked, since the shells were a little difficult, but very tasty and good portion for the price.  Hit the spot :P

Also tried the Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce ($7.50 HH). Great garlic flavor with tender pieces of lean pork! I meant to save half of this to take home, but I seriously couldn't stop eating it!! It's been a while since I couldn't hold back lol

Great food, great portions, and great prices.  Easy 4 star review!  I am sure I will be back, and if anything blows my mind, I might just bump up the review!

Everything was prepared with traditional Chinese tastes, which means very good and authentic tastes.  I am Chinese, born overseas, so I have a reasonable perspective for this.  You even get the complimentary starter soup, big pot of rice and dessert at the end of the meal.  Feels like the good old Chinese restaurants of NYC.  

If you are looking for true Chinese food, come here and enjoy!  Service can be a bit chaotic because they can be super busy during dinner times.",whbIcnEBq8JBg03sEyCOpg,0,0,5,6C8maAm8YCCFgnOYuA1VkQ
5262963,2015-07-09,1,9sbXPpRC_wDhCsp7qG2PDw,"This has got to be the worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. Me and my family came here after we saw a show because it was one of the few restaurants open late. Our server messed up one of our orders and it took them over 15 minutes to bring out the correct dish although we were one of the three tables there. When we tried to get his attention and ask for some rice, he shouted ""what?!"" at us in a rude manner. After, our waiter ignored us the whole night and was more focused on his friends at the other table and was drinking beer with them. It felt as if we weren't worth his time. It was like we were waiting for him rather than him waiting on us. He kept walking in and out of the kitchen passing us but never making eye contact or checking up on us. We finally got anther waiter to give us our check. The whole time me and my sister would speak English to him, he scoffed at us in a manner as if we were dumb for not speaking Chinese. The food was good, however, it was not good enough to make me want to go back.

I definitely will not recommend this place to friends, family, or others. Never going back.",xP8rgNHxcbF_lN0jb3hPxw,3,0,2,vnwNMbz1F1EGEre2ZejfVA

They have daily lunch specials that range from $5.50-$7.50. I believe it's from 11am-3pm. Yay!

Everything is cooked to order and well seasoned. The restaurant itself is not fancy, but if I can get good food, I'm there. Parking can be a nightmare during peak hours.

The bad: for those of you who play Cards Against Humanity it's time to play the fiery poops card.  Seriously, bad stuff and I'll leave it at that.  But, if the stomach discomfort wasn't bad enough the ladies bathroom is 1) disgusting with a barely functional toilet and 2) like something out of a horror flick with burned out light bulbs and inadequate light to see without using my cell phone flash light.  

Since their public customer areas are not kept in good condition, I'm certain their kitchen is probably maintained about the same.  In retrospect, it is no surprise we were treated to a double dose of germs and contaminants.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,2,0,1,LyX6Bd1b060DX0kT9_mfbQ

However, the Mongolian beef was a big disappointment.  I think there was max of 6 pieces of tiny beef mixed with tons of onions and peppers.  I would have rather paid full price for the dish for more beef.
