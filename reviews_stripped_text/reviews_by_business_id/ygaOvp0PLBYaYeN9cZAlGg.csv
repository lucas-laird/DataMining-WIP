I knocked a star off because I called prior to coming and the lady on the phone told me there was no wait so I was at the restaurant within 10 minutes. When we arrived at the restaurant, it was packed and we had to wait about 10 minutes. I understand that's not long but when I asked the guy who seemed like he was in charge, he brushed me off saying ""he doesn't know if people lie about that"". Usually that puts me off a restaurant but it was New Year's Day and I already tried 2 prior restaurants and they were both closed.

I'm glad I gave it a chance. The food was very good! The restaurant was clean. Service was quick. I deviated from my usual pho and got a vermicelli bowl with grilled chicken and egg roll and the boyfriend got the pho with rib eye. The broth was delicious and all the pickled vegetables with the charred chicken were wonderful!

430344,2017-08-05,0,ygaOvp0PLBYaYeN9cZAlGg,"While on vacation, my family and I ate here last night. We all had various pho bowls, along with spring rolls (Shrimp no pork) and Fried Shrimp rolls. Normally when we eat at Vietnamese restaurants, we would have to add hoisin sauce, along with the hot sauce. That wasn't the case with this restaurant though, because the broth was outstanding. The shrimp spring rolls, along with the shrimp eggroll was some of the best I've ever eaten as well, three different dipping sauces for both were included (Fish sauce, Peanut sauce, along with sweet & spicy). I wish we had a restaurant back in Maryland that had OX TAIL PHO! This particular Pho was so good, that I was tempted to order a second bowl had I not been so satiated! I'm tempted to go back tonight with my family again for the barbecue; we shall see! 

p.s. I've read some of the ""So-So"" reviews of this place, and I can tell you, they are far reaching to say the least. My wife has a slight Gluten intolerance, and because the 1st waiter was a ""Little Light"" on his English, he quickly got another server to help decipher what she could and couldn't eat on the menu. Afterwards, every waiter that passed our table, was assisting with mostly every need we MAY HAVE HAD (Because we didn't have any.), and OUR water glasses were never empty. Nor did we have to ""set them on the end of the tables"", as another person here said she normally would do.

I'll finish with, ""IF VACATIONING IN VEGAS? GET THE HELL OFF THE STRIP! Your journey will open your eyes to an array of awesome restaurants! PLACES WHO ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO CATER TO YOU LIKE YOU TRULY MEAN SOMETHING!"" 

Besides, SOME, of the tourists I've come across while being a tourist,,,,,where just rude as H**L. They have absolutely NO HOME TRAINING/RESPECT for others.",ztZhApjBZFuDfSOwb2dYyQ,3,0,5,vb1PNMgFKbKt8IbNVv7b7g

The BF and I decided to share a large bowl of beef flank pho and after our waitress figured out we were sharing, she suggested that we can also add in the rare beef into the same pho. It was super nice that she gave us that suggestion, she could have totally just gone on her way after taking our order. The food came super fast, I felt like she walked away and then came back with our spring roll order! The pho came not too long after that. 

About the pho, it was delicious! Our pho experience has mainly been in Chicago's Argyle Street (not sure how much it speaks to authenticity), I feel like the broth I've had in Chicago is a little bit lighter. Regardless, Viet Noodle Bar's pho is good! 
The beef spring rolls were good as well. I was expecting the typical peanut sauce that I love but it was a light, watery sauce that was good as well. 

Something unique about this Vietnamese restaurant is there's a bar-like vibe, I think I spotted the alcohol across the room and college basketball was playing on the TVs. The place was also playing American songs (none of the current trendy stuff, but slightly older music), which the BF enjoyed :)",oRg41nCrU_fCL4MmrTAnKg,1,0,5,L332ZqYDo7b2mJwRhVmrFA

I scooped out so much of bad brisket meat out of my combo soup, but one piece of rare beef, one small piece of tendon and tripe.  The broth tasted like someone put a flour.  I thought it was just me and my husband said ""do u taste flour?"".   The egg rolls were rolled in thin wrappings of not the rice wrapper so it didn't taste authentic vietnamese egg rolls.

Place seemed clean...except when I took a quick peek under the table before I slid into the booth seat, it looked like several days worth of food bits and crumbs were under there. But oh well, it's not like you're eating off of the floor.

Service was friendly, but not overly attentive. Our server didn't bring our check, or was able to be flagged down to ask for it, so had to pay at the register.

Felt a bit like being in the twilight zone. Why? Because there was one melodramatic song that was being looped over and over again the entire time we dined. Surprised none of the employees get sick of that song. All that while ESPN was being broadcast on the TVs.

Like the early and late hours...great for when you're craving Vietnamese for breakfast or for a late dinner.

Will try the oxtail pho next time and see if it's reason enough to keep coming back. But this first visit, nothing that really stood out to warrant coming back here soon.",XYSMRBNxdOOvJCkWyCZUfw,0,0,4,bhU8KQbxeAc0eR7gudAKvA

I hardly used any sauce (hoisin + Sriracha) because it was just so good on its own.

Also tried the ""hot pot"" aka DIY spring rolls with the beef. They bring out all the ingredients, a grill, and the meat and you grill the meat and assemble your own spring rolls. Everything was great and there was plenty of meat in that one order and they can refill the veggies or wraps if you run out for free. The only thing I felt like I was missing was the perfect spring roll sauce-wasn't too crazy about the ones they brought out with it.

It was about $10 but it didn't really have lots of noodles or meat. Looks more like a medium than a large bowl. I might go back again if they actually fill the bowl with more noodles than broth.

1404235,2017-01-19,11,ygaOvp0PLBYaYeN9cZAlGg,"I first heard about VNB after hearing the news that the brother of one of my fave restaurants, District One, was going to open a straight-up Vietnamese restaurant. Had to check it out. I remember when this place used to be Pho Hung, and that was a HUGE disappointment. Luckily as I found out, location has nothing to do with a restaurant's success, it's all about the people, and man, they found a good ones at VNB.

My first mark on trying a Vietnamese restaurant is always the Pho. I don't know why that is. Maybe it's my perception that when a restaurant nails something that is basic to their theme, then everything else must be great. I have been burned by this theory before, but that's my story, and I'll stick to it. And their Pho btw is really good, probably the best one in Las Vegas. It's fragrant and beefy, while staying relatively clear. The meat is fresh and of good quality. I've had appetizers like the spring rolls and banh xeo (think of a giant, seafood stuffed crepe), as well as many others, and they too, were the best I've had in Vegas.

But, if you want to take a walk on the wild side, I would recommend coming with a compadre, and ordering the Bo Tom Nuong Vi. It's the only one of it's kind in Vegas, and apparently, the closest other location is in Southern Cal. Basically, it's Korean BBQ or Shabu Shabu (depending upon which version you choose to order), and make-your-own spring rolls, combined into one dish. It's fun, and exciting, and I enjoyed it very much.

I've heard some stories about the service, but all of my experiences have been great, including when this place is super busy. Is VNB the best Vietnamese restaurant I've ever had? No, but it's in my Top 3, and all three are worthy of 5 stars. Best Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas, and I don't think anything comes close.

The brisket and rare steak was fresh and tender as were the veggies.

Service: My waiter was super nice and apologized many times about the wait times since it was a full house during New Years. 

Pho Dac Biet: The broth, the most important component for pho was delicious and it hit the spot since Las Vegas during NYE week was cold AF.   

Mi Hai Vi: The dry egg noodles with seafood was delicious. I was happy that they had a sauce for their egg noodles versus just leaving it plain which I've experienced at other restaurants; however, the sauce was more on sweeter side. I also personally love their version of the thin egg noodles. 

Prices: All the entrees are reasonably priced and the portions were good.

1536968,2017-04-19,6,ygaOvp0PLBYaYeN9cZAlGg,"I hit the jackpot in Vegas and it wasn't at a Casino. It was at Viet Noodle Bar. They are the real MVP.

BUN BO HUE. This is the real deal mother load. I've been on a BBH kick for months now, I can't get enough of it cooking at home, traveling, eating out in my city etc. There's a right way, and a ""cheating"" way to assemble a bowl in my humble opinion. Americanized places often go lighter and the true Asian places come in heavy. This is THE BEST place to get Bun Bo Bue- a spicy Vietnamese noodle dish served with different noodles and meats than it's more popular cousin, pho. In order for the bowl to be MOST authentic, it's got to have all the right ingredients, which means tendon, congealed blood, a pork hock, and other slices of beef like brisket and flank. The veggie accompaniments include bean sprouts, cabbage, lime, cilantro, basil, and shio leaf. This is an authentic version and not a watered down wimpy version to apease American taste buds.

This bun bo hue is a solid 5. When there is a dish that you eat on the weekly, you have to find your spot, and I've found mine in Vegas.

And who would have thought the Las Vegas version of Chinatown would have such a wonderful restaurant.  Hell, who would have though Vegas would have a Chinatown?  

Very large restaurant in one of the many strip malls lining Spring Mt. Rd.  Mostly community seating with a few booths in the back.  And packed for a Wednesday night.  Two very good spring rolls with char-broiled beef - not too crispy no too dry and nice flavors.  Then on to the main course - The Phan Banh Hoi - huge plate with vermicelli, sliced shrimp with a bean curd crust and enough salad for a large family of rabbits.  Wonderfully thing rice paper sheets to roll your own wraps.  Great flavors from all the ingredients and a great way to roll the wraps for any individual taste (me - not a big fan of cucumber).  A wonderful alternative to the Pho.

And a few special mentions - very nice, friendly and efficient staff.  Especially when explaining how to put everything together (did I mention this was my first time eating this type of dish).  There I am sitting with really good stuff in front of me and absolutely no clue why there is a giant salad and big bowl of hot water.  Two waiters were extremely patient in curing me of my ignorance.  Almost a pro now.

My husband and I ventured into this establishment after attending a three day conference in Vegas. However, I was concerned when we walked in as the restaurant was rather empty. 

Thankfully my concerns were put to rest when my husband's food arrived. I had a young coconut which was brought out on a small plate with a straw and spoon. It was ice cold so I let it warm up to cool before drinking it. I saved the inside to eat as my dessert :)
My pho was very good. The veggies were PERFECT for my taste. They were probably put into the bowl raw and the super hot broth just barely cooked them. The broth itself had very good flavor. It's not the best I've ever had, but I could say it was probably second place :)

My husband's bun was outstanding!  I would give it a try the next time we are in Vegas. The flavors of the stir-fried toppings were fantastic!! 

They also have a great selection of desserts. Maybe next time I will be hungry enough for one ;)

Overall, I highly recommend Viet Noodle Bar. The server was very friendly and patient as we looked over the large menu. The prices, quality and portions are VERY reasonable.",J1KUMJflFKE37ee1NC1z6A,2,1,5,N3Sb-FK8Ixx89Cbwm0dQdw

For those who like the exotic, they have Oxtail Pho on the menu.  It is an acquired taste, with a prime rib type of flavor and they use the larger, fatty pieces.  Surprisingly, the people I was with REALLY liked the dish , after they got over the origin location of the meat.  I prefer the leaner smaller pieces, but those are far and few in the dish.

Pho is one of my favorite dishes, so I'm a pain in the ass critic. Viet Noodle Bar did not disappoint at all! I ordered the #10 Pho dish, where you have a choice of 4 meats---but I only got it with 3, which were: flank, brisket and tendon. The broth was super flavorful, so hearty and full of spice. 

I came here with my love and a friend and our friend mentioned this thing called 'pho oil.' He ordered a bowl of pho oil for the table, and OMFG... two spoonfuls of this pho oil enhanced the flavor of the pho by 100000 notches, it was unbelievable. *gasp face emoji* So be sure to order it when you go to this place. Try the broth out normally first and then put a spoonful of pho oil and taste the amazing difference.

I also got a Thai iced tea, and normally I always get disappointed when I order it at restaurants because it taste watered down, but this particular Thai iced tea was DAAAAAAANK. Definitely paired well with bowl of pho.

A few things I do admire about this place is each person gets their own saucer of bean sprouts, basil, limes and jalapeños and the attentive service that the waiters provided.

I digress, though. 

When you first walk into the restaurant, you're greeted with a charming atmosphere and very friendly staff, who always seem to handle things beautifully whether they're completely empty (rarely, in my experience) or absolutely packed. The menu has a great variety, and everything I've tried has been top notch, from the classic pho thai or pho tom (Pho with flank steak / shrimp) to the vermicelli bowls (Protein of your choice atop a bed of rice noodles atop a crisp, fresh salad), to the udon (Simple udon soup done right). There's more yet to try, like their porridge but that'll be for another day. Great portion sizes, too. I've never left there hungry.

The part I love most about this restaurant would have to be how delicious and filling the meal can be without feeling overmuch. The menu uses so many fresh ingredients and clean options that I always just *feel* good after visiting. Good stuff overall.

If you know me, you know how much i love Pho. And how I'm a pretty big Pho snob (I've tried it all). That being said, this place is pretty amazing. Robust broth, tender meat, the noodles have perfect texture and fresh-fragrant ingredients. It's the best thing on a gloomy day or any day of the week imo. 

I usually order the same thing every time:
#1 Cha Gio (crispy egg rolls) served with big leafy greens not the sad wilted lettuce you'll find at other restaurants. 
#9 Pho Tai large (rare steak) usually the difference between large and small at most places isn't very noticeable but it is here. If you don't want to leave on an empty stomach, opt for the large bowl. 
And Hot tea - it's good for the soul and cold water is served automatically. 

The Charbroiled Pork Spring Rolls, Ox-tail pho and Bun Bo Hue are all solid choices. Another notable mention is the service. Unlike most Vietnamese restaurants where you order your food, you receive your food, then never see your waiter again; Viet Noodle Bar really stands out for their service.

We were greeted and seated immediately, water was served immediately and the server was ready to take our order. 

My dad wanted to try the broken rice (com tam) but they serve the dish with normal rice instead of the broken rice... which is really strange! Com tam is not com tam without com tam :) - I am not picky but I just cannot eat Com Tam with regular rice, it is just not the same. 

My dad and brother both got Com Bo Luc Lac with fried rice (you can choose from: white rice, red rice (white rice and tomato sauce), or fried rice. They really liked it! Said the rice smelled and tasted really good, the beef is also nicely marinated and tasted good. We have been eating Com Bo Luc Lac at Pho Saigon 8 for years, we really like theirs but they put too much sauce on their beef which wets the rice and can be too salty. This place has a nice amount of sauce and even more beef too! Probably a new place we will go to for CBLL!

I got the Pho Ap Chao Combination! I really like the pho, it is very crispy, they cut it into pieces so it is very easy to eat. The combination has: beef, shredded chicken, shrimp, squid, broccoli, onions, celery, carrots and a few other veggies. I really like that they have lots of broccoli and shredded chicken! However, I find the gravy/sauce to be a little too sweet for my taste, too much sugar in the sauce, I would have liked it more if it was more savory than sweet.

They also have Chao Ga (Vietnamese porridge) which is one of my favorite dishes. The Vietnamese restaurants in our old hometown don't offer this on their menus; therefore I was so happy to see this on their menu and I now order this regularly. The porridge is seasoned well; and it has just the right amount of ginger, garlic, rice, and meat. I've also tried their pork vermicelli and pork rice plates. The pork is charbroiled; tender; and very flavorful. The prices are reasonable and their portions are generous. The dining area is very spacious; we never have to wait to be seated.

Bo Nuong Vi- healthy and flavorful BBQ mixture with rice wrapper, veggies, and lemongrass marinated meat (shrimp, beef, and/or squid). these meat selections are little/ no fat compared to KBBQ, and cheaper considering the shareable portions. 

Hu Tieu- dry, clear noodles with chashu pork  (or other protein) with sauce inside, additional soup on the side. 

Their service is A1.

Last time we were here, we came around 11pm and stumbled here since Pho Kim Long was waaay too packed. Thanks Yelpers! Anywho, we loved it so much, that we decided to come back. I had been telling my sis about how yummy my hubby's rib eye pho and my oxtail pho were. This evening, my sis and I both ordered small bowls of tendon pho and added sides of ribeye. The small portion was perfect for me. My sis ended up taking some of hers to go. My husband got an order of ribeye pho and I want to say that was a large bowl? I'm not too sure, but the bowl was larger than the tendon ones. Broth is key to success with pho. Crappy broth= crappy pho. The flavor of the broth was on point, yet again. No need to pour heaping amounts of Hoisin sauce to make up for lack of flavor. The tendon was tender (say that 10 times over) and ribeye was yuuuum! My next visit, though, I'm gonna ask them to toss the ribeye slices in and not as a side. It was slightly a little more rare than I thought, even after it sat in the broth for a while. My hubby loved his, of course. We also ordered charbroiled pork spring rolls which came with a side of dipping sauce that was fish sauce based. It was a twist on the usual pork and shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce. I think we might pass on that next time, though. Nothing too special about it. Great service, even with how busy they were.

Also it is super crowded there, even worse than college union cafe. There are lots of long table in the middle and lots of guests shard the tables. 

We ordered two classic pho, you can choose any topping you want. I would recommend the rare beef. They also did something wrong with the order, they put beef tripe in the soup which we didn't order. I ordered the spicy special vermicelli ? I am not sure what it called. I thought it will be like normal spicy vermicelli in other pho restaurant but not. There are lots of weird beef organs in the soup and I don't like it at all. 

But I have to admit their soup base is super super good. Fresh, tasteful and flavorful. Strong and clear taste made me forgive all the errors. Also the portion and beef amount is surprisingly big.

I ordered the Oxtail Pho, while my partner had the Beef Stew Egg Noodle Soup. The Oxtail Pho was excellent. The meat was very tender and the broth was tasty, without being greasy/oily. The Beef Stew Noodle was also tasty, but the meat was not all that tender so my partner wasn't too thrilled with it. I think if they kept the meat cooking for a bit longer, then the beef would be more tender - but other than that, it would have been a real winner. 
Instead of being turned off by the not too tender meat of this order though, Paul managed to still have us leave happy. He automatically offered to take it off our tab and also asked if there was something he could replace it with. Not feeling hungry at this point, he asked if we wanted something to go instead. We opted for the spring rolls to take home with us. When he came back with our to go order, he also brought us a complimentary dessert. 
While I know some people complain just so they could get something for free, we gave our feedback so they could make improvements (specially since this is newly opened). They turned this negative into a positive. We will definitely be back.",40uA-Z0AZVsnbWJ-lUVoqQ,0,0,4,9O_ghZ6IqjIX3atqbGyE0A

I normally get regular spring rolls with the shrimp but felt like trying something different besides this was my first visit. So figure why not. I was totally psyched I did!!! Because the beef spring rolls were amazing. It looks just like any basic spring roll. You add the charred beef talk about game changer. The dipping sauce not your heavy peanut sauce but lighter sauce. Not sure the sauce was but all know accented the springs roll on point. I know should went with all the rave the oxtail soup. I feeling more wanted lots of the different meats or the combination pho. I got the large bowl. Talk about awesome pho action. The broth for me always the winnah or loser in any pho battle. I feel the broth Viet Noodle Bar was really good. It had nice depth and truth I could have gone with the siracha and hoisin sauce always add. It tradition and adds even more depth to the broth. The large talk about nice portion of not only the noodles but the meats all the good stuff. I have had Pho at lot of places and not given get large nice equal portion of both. I did see few oxtail Pho coming out and no doubt need come back soon try that one next.

The restaurant is lot bigger then it lots from the outside. I enjoy the look with the booths and tables. One wall nice artwork think cow or something sorry forgot. Make sure put it in updated review. LOL. The same area bar stools so if restaurant packed it just you got place get your grub on. Few nice widescreen televisions around if watch sports game. It very much modern feel too it.

After this, she decided upon a grilled pork dish with rice, and I chose the combination pho. After ordering, a large table came in and sat next to us. I mention this because, this large table ended up getting their food before us. 

My wife got her food quickly, but I literally waited for 20 mins for my pho(if you know anything about pho, it usually takes no longer than three to five minutes to get out to you). Turns out that the rude man(typical, and usually a good sign for a pho joint) somehow totally forgot to order my pho(even though he wasn't even the one taking care of the large party). So after this large tablet got their food, I ended up getting mine a few minutes afterwards with out any apology. 

The pho here wasn't even good, mixed in with the below average pho service(yeah below average for even a pho joint), I would not recommend this place to anyone. STAY CLEAR AWAY FROM HERE!",Am7jXUBKoBy_RvcNuvAffw,3,3,2,r8U1w69Ih59sOLYA8_DgJQ

Viet Noodle Bar is an all-around good choice for Vietnamese food in Vegas, but there are dishes here that I absolutely love! 

The Bánh Xèo (Vietnamese Crêpe) was the first dish to catch my attention at VNB. The dish isn't overly complicated, but super tasty. The crêpe is cooked with onions, shrimp, and pork and folded over in half. There is a jungle of veg accompanying the crepe that includes a stuffing of bean sprouts, a side of pickled carrot & radish, some lettuce leafs, Tía Tô (Perilla), Lá Qu (Thai Basil), and fresh sliced cucumber. You decide how much herbs and veggies to wrap-up with some of the crêpe in a leaf of lettuce, then dip it into the sweet fish sauce and enjoy.

I've enjoyed all the Phos and soups that I've had at VNB, but I return to the Chicken Pho more than others. I like to limit the amount of red meat I eat so I'm not usually opting for traditional Pho, but it is excellent here as well, as is the Ox Tail Pho. Chicken is typically more hit and miss at Vietnamese spots though--often an afterthought lacking flavor or loaded with msg. While certainly not eliminating the msg, VNB does a great job of not relying on it for the main source of flavoring and are still able to develop a substantially flavorful broth in their Chicken Pho.

One of my least favorite things about Viet Noodle Bar is the popularity of the on-table BBQ grills. It seems to be a good value for the amount of meat you are supplied with...probably why they are popular...but the result is a restaurant that often reeks of grilled meat. This is not always the smell you want to be wearing for the remainder of your day...so dine with caution. I haven't even ordered any of the grilled entrees, but swear that at least half the time I've carried this smell with me until freed by a shower. 

I shared an order of the Bò lúc lc (Shaken Beef) with a large group one time and found it be quite good...but again, not something that I partake in all that often.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,12,8,4,iU-2Ak1sA2rQQ2cPruc_4A

Our waiter brought waters and took our orders quickly. Only complaint was our food took quite some time to come out. There was about 10 of us and 2 of us got food at a time. If you weren't the one to wait, everyone ate a different times. Restaurants tend to time their food so that everyone got it together. 

Pho Ap Chao - This was what I got and it was pretty good. There was a lot of veggies and meat on top of the noodles. Noodles were incredibly crispy which I liked. 

Banh Xeo - My husband got this and it was not bad. The flavor of the batter was solid. It was a bit soggy though and we prefer if these were crisp and fresh off the pan. 

I would say this is a decent Vietnamese restaurant but nothing ever beats a home cooked Vietnamese meal from mom's. If we were in the area and nothing else was open, we could come back. Otherwise, not the first place we would seek out.",0gvetX-CZwk85wvHU_gJ5A,8,0,3,YvpinHSeYog4QHOPSMRPJw

Sadly, I was not impressed at all.

First, let me tell you about this dish. 

Bun Bo Hue is a popular Vietnamese soup that is made with rice vermicelli noodles (Bun) and beef (Bo) and Hue is for the city in central Vietnam. The dish is greatly admired for its balance of SPICY, SOUR, SALTY and SWEET flavors and the predominant flavor of LEMON GRASS.

For me, the broth was not spicy, sour, salty or sweet at all. It was just salty. Huge letdown. 

Second, there were NO BLOOD CUBES in my dish - which was what I was looking forward to the most. 

Third, I wanted to see some PORK KNUCKLES. NONE! I just want the real deal. Not the washed down version.

It comes with spring roll wrap and water, and a huge plate of veggies and some sauces. I usually eat spring rolls with a peanut sauce. These were a little different but both tasted good. This was definitely a cool experience and it was delicious! You grill your own meat and make your own spring rolls. Don't make them too big like me or you won't be able to wrap them :D We ordered the crispy egg noodles stir fried with seafood. I was impatient and started eating it before the noodles could soak up the sauce on the plate. There was not much flavor, but when I tried it later it was good but not my fave. We also ordered calamari which was good. We got the woven vermicelli and some type of fried tofu as well. By the time we were done with all that food, we were pretty stuffed, but after reading some of the reviews about the bun bo hue, I wanted to try it so we ordered that too. The broth was so flavorful. The noodles were a little harder than what I prefer. My friends agreed with me.

The restaurant is a little hidden inside of a strip mall but is rather spacious inside and rather clean/modern inside compared to many other Vietnamese restaurants in town. The bathrooms were also well kept. We walked in and chose a booth by the window. 

The only real complaint was that service was a little slow. While both the manager/owner and server were very friendly, it took quite a while to get our check and place our order once we were seated. The restaurant was pretty empty, so that isn't really acceptable to me, but the food and demeanor of the staff definitely made up for it. 

We ordered the spring rolls and egg rolls, both of which were pretty solid (though in my opinion it is rather hard to mess up either of these things). The pho was VERY good. I think this place puts more meat in the bowl than any other restaurant in Vegas, so that's always a perk, and the broth pretty incredible.

We ordered plenty of food and the original waiter complained saying you should have asked for a bigger table if you wanted to order a lot of food...what?? Of course we want a lot of food, there is 6 of us eat and share. Service began as a 2-3 but ended with a 3-4. 

We were seated within about 5 minutes though it was a very busy during Sunday lunch. After dealing with the aforementioned waiter (oh and not receiving two dishes we ordered), the new guy brought everything we asked for. We ordered waters and a couple Viet-coffee's, these were tasty iced coffees that the family shared.

We started with some spring rolls which came served with fish sauce and a second type of sauce, darker and had a distinct smell. The spring rolls were fresh and delicious 5/5. Next we ordered a couple marinated beef platters with shrimp. They brought out the grills and we cooked to our liking. The meat had good flavor and didn't have any fat, the shrimp was also marinated and was fresh 5/5. They brought out the veggie platter / fixings for our hand rolls and two trays of crisp wraps with warm water. It was interesting building your own wrap, including bean sprouts, noodles, lettuce, herbs and sauce. We also ordered some woven noodle which I wrapped around the fresh cooked meat and dipped in the fish sauce 5/5. Lastly we ordered a couple small ramen beef bowls (after the rolls was big enough to share) typical broth flavoring but the beef was good 4/5. Spiced it up a little with some Sriracha and hoi sen sauce. 

Overall the meal was very good and the family had a good time. Only reason they received 4/5 is because of the original service. Will be back again, and now we know who not to ask for. Enjoy the pics",WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w,6,7,4,_Q3QHyU-U5xg_ZlOrhlFOA

Haven't tried the BBQ grill on the table yet although it looks and smells wonderful - but have tried their egg noodles dry version, BBQ beef and pork rice dishes, lemon grass vermicelli, shrimp paste and pork patties vermicelli, pho and Bun Bo Hue noodle soup. The egg noodles dry version is pretty legit. It's not overlooked and has the perfect texture what a good bowl of egg noodles should be. The soup that comes on the side is on the salty side and doesn't have much flavor of a pork broth. The vermicelli and rice plates are good too. The pho is so-so, I only ordered it for my kids since they love pho. The Bun Bo Hue was a disappointment. Noodles were way over cooked, soup doesn't have much lemon grass flavor and it has too much meat going on in there from tendons to pigs skins to pieces of slices of beef shanks and meat patties like. The pork blood wasn't fresh - has a stinky smell to it and there weren't enough Vietnamese herbs and vegetables that should come with this noodle dish on the side.

That was the case when we were searching for a lunch place in Vegas, I've decided that we needed to find a Vietnamese place so that the BF can fulfill his Pho craving. I came across this place after a brief search on Yelp, and I am so glad that my fellow Yelpers have once again steered me to the right direction!  

Here are the dishes we tried (ranked by favorites):
Tom Hoa Tien (Shrimp Egg Rolls) - the dish is simply shrimps wrapped with spring roll skin and deep fried, but it was oh sooo good! The crunchiness of the spring roll skin coupled with the juicy flavorful shrimps were a match made in heaven. I could eat a whole tub of this!

Banh Xeo (Vietnamese Crepe) - this was the first time I've ever tried Vietnamese crepe and I don't know why it took me so long to try this dish. I wish I took a better picture that truly reflect how big this dish was. The crepe was practically the size of head and filled with shrimp, ground pork and bean sprouts. You are suppose to eat it with lettuce, basil and pickled vegetables, as well as the dipping sauce (Nuoc Cham).  It is actually a pretty involved process to just eat this dish, but it's oh so worth it!  Ever since then, I have always look for this dish whenever I am in a Vietnamese restaurant, but no one has done it as well as this restaurant 

Pho Duoi Bo (Oxtail Pho) with a side of Tripe - I love oxtail and have rarely seen them featured in Pho. I really liked the way the oxtail was cooked here. I also ordered a side of tripe with the pho, it came in a soup, which was kind of weird, but it tasted good and that was all it mattered. 

Pho Bo - just your standard pho, not much to report on this dish.

Decided to try this place out last week. After looking at a few places I decided to go with the ratings and reviews that I had seen previously. People had it spot on.

My vegetarian friend went ahead and started off with the spring rolls. Pretty tasty. Very fresh. Everything came together really well. We gave them a five out of five. You can always find vegetarian dishes at Thai places but the freshness and the care that went into putting these together definitely reflected in the taste. 5/5

I went with the shrimp eggrolls. Nothing over-the-top fancy about these but simple is elegant. Whole shrimp wrapped in an eggroll wrapper deep fried and served up with a traditional sweet-and-sour sauce. Add a little soy sauce to the sauce and it hit perfectly. Also 5/5.

Now for the fun stuff. Once again my vegetarian friend went ahead and decided to get the vegetarian option for the pho. The noodles were amazing. They have the amount of vegetables topped off the plate, with a side of Thai basil and sprouts. The broth had a great flavor as well. Also a 5/5.

I went ahead with the chicken wonton variation. I'm a huge fan of wontons and soup dumplings and these were pretty good. Pho restaurants aren't typically known for their wontons and these weren't the best ever but still pretty good. The chicken stock or broth was very flavorful and the portions were pretty big. We had gone with the regular sizes instead of the large sizes and we were glad we did. I also gave us a five out of five.

We've tried so many different Vietnamese restaurants looking for the best coffee but everywhere else fell short. At a lot of places it was made too sweet, or they barely filled our cup, some places had a hazelnut flavor to them, some tasted more like water, some places were too busy and took forever, a couple places were inconsistent w/ having good coffee but this place is PERFECT. The coffee is strong and does it's job to keep me awake until 4 or 5 AM. 

We also have eaten here a few times, too. Their menu is very large. I've seen hot pot and raw meats with grills here and so many different plates of amazing looking food. I've only tried the beef stew noodle soup, shrimp udon noodle soup, charbroiled spring rolls, regular spring rolls, and their vermicelli noodle salads.

The beef stew noodle soup and shrimp udon noodle soup were so amazing. They were both packed with so much flavor. The beef stew noodle soup was once ordered by me and ordered again by my boyfriend on a different occasion. That's how good it is! I'd also order the shrimp udon noodle soup again. It didn't need anything else added in it except of course, crispy & fresh bean sprouts! 

I also tried their lemongrass beef vermicelli noodle salad once which I've never seen on a menu before so I HAD to try it and I don't know if I'll EVER eat vermicelli noodle salad topped w/ anything else again. I can't even describe how good it was!! All of the flavors could be tasted in each bite, the beef was tender, and I was given a generous amount of it. Mmmm. 

We also had their charbroiled chicken spring rolls, which was another item I've never seen on a menu before. I LOVED them. I loved that I could have Chicken in my spring rolls instead of pork! They served it w/ a delicious sweet fish sauce but I think it would have been good w/ the peanut sauce as well!

There's nothing quite like a bowl of pho when you're feeling a little down, and the large bowl at Viet Noodle Bar is more than enough to satisfy most appetites. 

Oxtail pho doesn't have a ""size,"" but it's got a LOT of meat - 3 pieces of oxtail - that it easily outweighs the large. I didn't know that, though, and I had already ordered a side of spring rolls. No regrets on taste, but maybe a little regret on ordering too much food.

My favorite dish is their Mi Xa Xiu Kho. The xa xiu they use is so tender and flavorful! I also really love their Thai tea because you get a lot for a good price. It's also super creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. 

Service is spotty because they'll be quick to seat and take your order but once your meal comes, nobody really comes back to check on you until your almost done with your food. However, if you need something, just call them right over and they'll help you right away. 

They get super busy at night compared to the day, especially with the grills they have so if you wanna avoid all the smell of smoke and BBQ then just come during the day.

It is VERY hard to get good service in Vietnamese restaurants, first off. Our server was attentive and answered my questions with a smile on her face. 

The menu was probably my favorite part. You can get an XL pho or banh xeo or banh hoi... etc.! 

My boyfriend loves pho but at other restaurants I am always left with just two choices - bun or com. But this place put the excitement back into Vietnamese cuisine for me. So many options! We are actually going back again today! 

Just a note - my boyfriend judges good pho by the way the restaurant cuts their lime. They cut it perfectly and in the right direction, maximizing the lime juice.

It was pretty busy when we went, but tables were available.  We were seated as soon as someone was available to attend to us.  The menu is pretty big and offers a lot of different choices.

I really wanted to have the banh hoi as that's what I was looking for, and yelped this restaurant, and looked up reviews and saw that they served it!  You only get to pick one type of meat (i'm used to being able to select 3 meats), but that was fine.  
The platter came and it was huge!  3-4 pieces of lettuce, 10-12 pieces of woven vermicelli, a pile of cucumbers and pickled radish/carrots, a pile of mint, and stack of about 15-16 pieces of rice paper and hot water to create our masterpiece.

Their fish sauce is SOOOOOOO good!! dipping the vermicelli in the fish sauce, then topping with some veggies and meat.  A squeeze of hoisin sauce, mint and lime juice.  Made for some good bites!!  Salivating just thinking about it!
Definitely was good to feed 2 with the amount of food that was given.

My family also got the tomato paste crab noodle soup. I had some of the soup base, and it was so yummy!! full of crab flavour, and the crab meatballs were huge and plentiful.

But the food. Yeah. I can get down with the food here. 

Pho here is perfect for any occasion; late night snack, hangover, allergies, cold, what-ever! The soup isn't too salty, nor is it seasoned so richly that it would be undesirable on a day that your tummy is doing flip flops. 

I'm traditionally a Pho Dac Biet connoisseur, but their $11.95 oxtail pho was delicious. We each received 3 pieces of oxtail, 2 big bones, 1 small.

Egg rolls here were mo' betta to write home about than Pho Bosa. They make them the usual way here- served screaming hot with a meat and vermicelli filling. Served with the fish sauce that actually has shredded carrot in it. Go nuts and add the extra side of carrots and cucumbers if you want to add a little nutrition to your fried goodness.

Of course... add a dang coconut. Sure it's 4.75, but treat yo'self. Scrape the sides off and slurp up in a straw. Convince yourself it's a great source of hydration and healthy fats.

Friendly service, even from the grandparent types.

My food stayed hot all the way home, even after my detour to Lees. I'm glad they wrapped the soup container in a bag because my container top had a small cut so a little bit of soup spilled out. No big deal.

5/5 for the bun bo hue! Not as good as the ones in Orange County, but I'm pretty sure it's one of the best ones in vegas!  broth was flavorful with a ton of meat. I think the only downside is that they didn't give enough noodles.

3/5 for the bun rieu. The broth wasn't as good because it was definitely lacking some tomatoes. The meat that they used was ground up pork and crab or something. I wasnt a huge fan of it.

This place is surprisingly clean and nice, while also serving up authentic Vietnamese food. There's a lot of options on the menu, although we mainly focused on pho. 

Oxtail Pho - The oxtail was super tender and delicious. It's a massive portion size though, with 3 large oxtails in the soup. 

Pho Bo - Get it with tendon! Super soft and delicious. The tripe was unimpressive, I'd probably skip that. Other meats were okay, but not quite as good as the oxtail and tendon. These soups are also massive so a small was enough to fill me up. Some in my party did note that the soup flavor was a bit lacking, a bit too bland.

Bun Bo Hue - It's quite different from pho, with a different soup base. It tastes more seafood-y and balances the spicy and tangy flavors quite well. Personally I prefer the taste of normal beef soup, but some in my party loved the soup base. The contents of the soup were interesting, although nothing particularly stood out. The pig blood was quite lackluster in the soup. 

Spring roll with charbroiled beef - I liked that they cut this up for us into halves to make it easier for us to share. The beef wasn't quite and tender as I'd like, but it paired quite well with the fresh veggies. 

Spring roll with shrimp and pork - This was refreshing although it wasn't my favorite rendition. The peanut sauce was interesting, there was some coconut flavors (milk?) mixed into the peanut dipping sauce.

What I really wish was that we had tried the BBQ beef dish to wrap into spring rolls, but unfortunately my group was feeling pho more than BBQ meat.

Shrimp egg rolls are my favorite, and so are their egg rolls. Super crunchy and full of flavor.
Chicken wings are a must to try, make sure to order them crispy.
Oxtail pho, my boyfriend loved it. He said the meat fell right off the bone and was not chewy at all.

For the price you pay and amount of food you get this place is good! They're noodles on their pho noodle soup is  perfectly cooked! 

The broth is good, not too salty and not oily at all. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star  is due to lack of flavors. I ate the oxtail and it was super bland. Even the meatballs and brisket. It was sad because I expected too much from this place. Not sure why the meat flavor is missing to be honest.

I noticed that they had put another guest's order on my receipt and I had paid for it. I called and they immediately found the extra order in their system, apologized and said that I could either take it as a credit for my next visit or come in immediately to get a cash refund as they weren't able to refund my credit card for one specific item. I told them that I was about to leave Vegas and couldn't do either, so they offered to take down my address and mail me a check. Sure enough, the check arrived just a few days after I got home and I live all the way on the West Coast.

My Viet friend recommended Viet Noodle Bar as one of the better Vietnamese restaurants in Las Vegas, so I decided to check it out. I am currently transitioning to nights in preparation for a month of night shifts, so I went for my meal at 4PM, when the restaurant was fairly empty. The restaurant itself is quite large and spacious, and is also very clean with dark-colored decor.

Service was prompt and fairly attentive, with multiple water refills. The menu is of a decent size, though I found it amusing that there was a full page of just advertisements. Viet Noodle Bar offers some hotpot/grill items that are more unique in addition to pho, vermicelli, and broken rice dishes.

I opted for oxtail pho on this visit. Even though I love oxtail and have it regularly, this was actually my first time ever having oxtail pho! I took a sip of the broth before adding in the condiments, and it was phenomenal! Lots of flavor, piping hot (just how I like it), and not too oily. You get a decent amount of meat too (three bones in my bowl this time). The bowl itself is fairly large; there is only one size option for oxtail pho. While I missed having cuts like tendon and tripe found in traditional beef pho, the oxtail pho was a very satisfying dish overall. I was expecting the meat to just fall off the bone, but I guess it wasn't cooked quite that long since it took some effort to get all the meat off. I was given a plate, fork, knife, and special sauce to deal with the oxtail. Oxtail pho at $11.95 is several dollars more expensive than normal pho on the menu, but oxtail is usually expensive in the grocery stores too so it's not unreasonable.

Overall, a great dining experience and I'd love to come back and try vermicelli or rice dishes next time!",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,3,2,4,YkBii-ZFLKrt1lqrslvi9A

Viet Noodle Bar serves the customers of all ages to taste their finest and authentic Vietnamese cuisines every day and night from Bun Bo Hue to the popular favorite: Pho as well as rice plates and Vermicelli bowls! The atmosphere is very active and on-going as I welcomed there. The concept is much similar to your local Vietnamese restaurants in the U.S., and as for the Viet Noodle Bar, it's much modern and night-life feel just like Pho Saigon Bay in Sacramento, CA.

The employees here from servers and cookers are doing a great job for making the customers like me a remarkable service. No cons.

Now onto the food! I ordered my favorite Vietnamese cuisines: the Pho Tai (aka. Pho Beef in rare steak strips). As I ate it, that Pho tasted sensational and fantastical! The beef broth is purely made and naturally authentic filled with gorgeous spices and herbs. The rare steak strips cooked and boiled perfectly after the soup gets hotter! The noodles plus garnishes both worked spell-bounded! Not a bad late night grub for me!

There's plenty of parking spaces available, so you can park anywhere you want.

All in all, Viet Noodle Bar is the most incredible local Vietnamese restaurant that I've ever discovered to find an affordable foods in Las Vegas! Perfect for friends, family co-workers and students gathering day and night! A well received! My rating: 4 solid stars.",3HSmHE-FQZ7b2kyfa1e64A,19,20,4,_7CvxKaxUKIOAEsgxTh0nQ

Lets start with the first visit.  It was around 1-2 am on a Sunday night, my family just finished adventuring on the strip and I went to go pick up four bowls of pho to go so my parents can eat at home and sleep before they had to travel back to California. The service was super solid, everyone was super nice working there.  It took them a bit longer for my food but I was chilled to sit back and relax.  They gave my a cup of water and after I got my items I went home.  The pho was very flavorful and the bowls were huge.  I give my first visit 5 stars overall everything was great.  The second time around though not so much.  My sister and I went on a Wednesday a little after 1 pm.  It was not too busy and we sat down after they old us what table.  The service was not as good as the first visit and it was a bit slow.  we ordered the rice platter, the cold noodle bowl, and the banh xeo which is a Vietnamese crepe.  The crepe was mostly filler where it was 85 % bean sprouts and my sister and I were super surprised to see button mushrooms in them.  It didn't really bring any flavor to the dish.  rice dish was super disappointing.  The pork was bland, the fish sauce was bland as well.  My sister did not like the noodle bowl either.  Overall it was pretty disappointing.  I grew up in a pretty old school Vietnamese household and these dishes were staples to my life growing up.  Maybe it was just a bad day, I hope to return in the future to see if there is any change.  Or I should just get pho here instead.",R38mW_Uyp46JHToxobXQXg,1,1,4,qmLyI5wStKlZjpacCfwlmA

I ordered pho with beef tendon and it was very good. The veggies and tendon were right for my taste. They were probably put into the bowl raw and the super hot broth just barely cooked them. The broth itself had very nice flavor. It's not the best I've ever had, but I was so hungry I almost finished it. 

My boyfriend had the Vermicelli stir fried beef and he liked it. He asked for the bun with pork belly that was on the menu online but they didn't have it.

Believe it or not, they make a solid Chicken Pho here for those of you who aren't fond of Oxtail, tendon, and other mystery meats in your pho. We also got to try each of their grilled spring rolls which were okay, we also tried a mix grill assortment which was fun, but could be a little awkward from where you're situated and even dangerous with hot splattering oil when excess liquid from raw meat or seafood comes in contact with the oil. BE CAREFUL!!!

The Lotus Salad and the Banh Xeo(Vietnamese Crepe) were other very delicious options we got to try. Service was spotty on our first visit, but we had a much better waiter on our second visit(Tallest Asian waiter, glasses, and speaks perfect English) On another visit, I ordered the Bo Luc Lac(Shaking Beef) with Red Rice and that was pretty good and a generous portion as well. On the menu, the dessert selections look slim, but our waiter was nice to point out other dessert items up front by the cash register. The Vietnamese Coffee Float(I call it Vietnamese Affogato ;0) is a great way to end your meal, and be on the lookout for the expansion of their dessert items in the future! ALOHA!!!

DO IT!!!:
Chicken Pho
Bo Luc Lac
Lotus Salad
Banh Xeo

I can't blame him. ) You know when you have pho and you know there are spices in it, but your not exactly sure what they are, because they just didn't put enough in?
Well forget about that at this place. You will taste the spices,you'll probably wonder how much they put in and why other places don't do the same, but believe me when I say this: The pho is amazing.",GIbxefKhaTybhv6bYsl9ZA,1,1,5,s7aoA1azfUhbN5abYMf94w
3617594,2015-12-15,4,ygaOvp0PLBYaYeN9cZAlGg,"At one point I thought I was gonna be like so many of my friends ""all pho taste the same"", ugh. It was becoming true with the lackluster bowls of noodles at most joints. Then District One came along, a spot that adds some love with each bowl, a smile on my face and a satisfied belly, but the service was pretty terrible so it became hard to go back often. Fast forward a year and Viet Noodle Bar opens up from the same family that runs District One. Focused on more traditional styles of Vietnamese cuisine, but with the same amount of love as D1.

Like ramen, pho is made from bones, so if your lips aren't glistening with deconstructed bone marrow, then you might be slurping on soup blocks. Using soup blocks makes it pretty easy for some places to offer that $5.95 price point. Although its a bit pricey at VNB, they're not shorting you with portion size, especially if you're a meat lover, they load the bowl up (maybe too much)! Bun thit nuong is a great alternative when you're not feeling soup, pretty much a Vietnamese pasta salad with grilled pork and the best fish sauce. 

VNB definitely isn't messing around with its food, or the SNHD, it wins the cleanest Vietnamese restaurant award. Can't give the same award for service though, lunch service is fairly disconnected from its dinner service.

I used to go to Pho Saigon 8 with my parents every time we were in Vegas, but luckily yelp led me to this place today and I couldn't be happier. As a pho-fessional, I take my pho seriously bc I used to eat it for breakfast everyday when my parents cooked it.!

I got the pho rib eye, and the meat was so tender. I love how you can actually taste the diff spices in the pho (anise, coriander, cinnamon) bc I normally never get much of that flavor/scent @ other pho places. The broth definitely had MSG in it but not enough to make you feel super thirsty. My only complaint would be that a lot of the meat was stuck together, but that might also be the reason why the meat stays so tender  the broth had the perfect amount of depth... ask for their vinegar onions if y'all like it bc it's not too vinegary & just right. The pho is more on the pricier side but I've always believed that there's no such thing as amazing pho that's less than $10 @ a restaurant bc it requires so much bone broth and time; you do get what you pay for.

My friend and I was looking for a place to get her pho fix as our usual spot Pho So 1, was closed. We decided to try this place out. 

The wait time was short and we were seated promptly. The menu was easy to read and we found what we wanted quite easily. We both noticed that they have more than one type of egg roll(vegetable, pork, shrimp) which was nice as other restaurants have the selection of just egg or spring roll. Their pho no matter the type comes in Small or Large and that was new to us as well as other restaurants just offer one size. 


I opted for a large combination pho and my friend had the same in a size small and we also ordered pork egg rolls. I loved that they brought out our own separate plate full of the toppings; bean sprouts, mint and jalapeños. Not that it's a problem to share but it's nice having our own to take from. The flavor in the egg rolls and pho were very delicious. I actually should've gotten a small as the large was too much for just myself but my friend ate all hers.

My mom, dad and I got the mi xa xiu and the meat wasn't even the legit xa xiu, not the pink stuff. Also the meat was extremely salty, to the point where my mom just took the meat out and just ate the noodles.   She has high blood pressure so extremely salty things are bad for her. I also had a side of wontons and it wasn't good.

However, both my sisters got the pho and it was decent. I guess stick to that if you go here.",NxJmCHEY9-au9Tpek74RtA,2,0,2,aapO7W2F0I7waB2ZkSWVVQ

But my boyfriend's friend recommended this spot. Needless to say it's one of the best I ever had!! Went that night and came back again the next morning! 

First night I had Seafood Banh Canh and he had Bun Bo Hue. Two big bowls came out and we ate it all! The next morning we came back and he had the Rice dish with Pork Chops, Charbroiled Chicken and Rib-eye --- meanwhile, I had Banh Xeo. Once again, up to par to my standards. There are so much more on the menu I still want to try so I'm definitely coming back at least once more before going back up to the East Coast. 

Service was excellent. Place was very clean. I'm sure on weekends it gets pretty busy. Absolutely no complaints. Hopefully one day they can expand up to the East Coast, count me in as a regular if that ever happens!

The pho itself is extremely affordable, unlike the pho in NYC. The portion size was reasonable for the $8 bucks or so that we spent. Let's just say we all left happily satisfied with our meal. The pho broth was phenomenal. It really reminds me of my parent's homemade pho (that's saying a lot because I've eaten plenty of pho and not many can be compared to my parents' home cooking).

Food- 
The food here is much better than pho so 1.  It's almost like they know that pho so 1 is not very good so they decided to make it better with this place.   The pho broth is rich and meaty. I just wish that the was a bit more cinnamon to give it a bit of a herbal taste.  They are very generous with their meat portions also.   Although the brisket and flank are a bit tough.   Their grilled pork is pretty good,  But I would still have to say the best grilled pork in Las Vegas is the Da Lat.  Also had their grilled beef which you wrap with fresh vegetables and noodles with rice paper. unlike the salon and other places there grilled beef was so flavorful and tender. That was quite a surprise. and they give you woven noodles.  Definitely try this with both the fish sauce and then the anchovy sauce. The anchovy sauce smells like dead shrimp and dead anchovies were buried together in 1912 and found in the desert in July of 2015. But somehow it's still delicious.  This is a great option if you want low-carb.

Service: friendly staffs, I think he was the manager or owner that made sure we had everything, awesomeness

Ordered: thai tea, beef and shrimp that you wrap, seafood udon and shrimp fried eggrolls

Specialty: pho

Quality of food:  all dishes were good

Revisit: yes
Parking:  Free

     Finding space: easy 

Cleanliness: clean in the restaurant but bathrooms need a little work

Overall:
Thai tea- was yummy, I have tried many thai teas and this is one of my faves. 

Beef and shrimp grill with wrap- 
you grill and wrap it yourself  which is  some work but so worth it bc of the sauce.  The brown sauce was awesomeness but the quality of meat was not so great and if it was marinated a little more I would have found the perfect place. Darn! The brown sauce has a pungent smell but tastes great, add the red chili sauce which tastes so much better. Yum.. 

Seafood udon - had clear udon noodles which had good flavor. The flavor wasn't too much or too little. 

Shrimp fried eggrolls- it was nice and crispy

To my surprise the interior is very modern, they have a couple TVs and play music pop/hip hop music. None of which take away from the chill zen-ish vibe. Our waiter was great but he was also the only one to interact with us the whole time. Understandable since there didn't seem to be too much staff at this time. To my surprise tho he didn't mind at all that we decided on eating there instead of taking togo. All we had were the spring rolls which we decided on before coming in with the plan on taking togo. I really enjoyed them. Some people say fresh spring rolls are fresh spring rolls, but If you eat a lot of Vietnamese food you know that isn't true. Here they have a larger lettuce over noodle ratio and I sort of forgot my spring rolls had pork because It was sliced so thinly, but flavor was all there. Especially with the sauce !

I'm always on the hunt for a good Pho place and luckily one of my best girlfriends is also a Pho addict, so we try to hit new spots all the time. We were in this area and I saw this place on Yelp! so off we went. It was midday on a Sunday and it was crowded AF. There was an actual wait list and a guy running back and forth, calling out names, clearing tables. I was like ""Yeah! This is going to be good."" Also, we were literally the only non Asians in the joint, so I knew we had found a good spot(I love you, Asians and all your delicious foods!)

After we were seated, the waitress took our drink order super quickly and came back with our beverages in a flash. I usually order water but that day I had a coke as well. I will say that the Coke here sucked. It was like totally the Coke that is running out of syrup and is more watered down. Not impressed,  but I'll give them a pass.

I ordered chicken Pho and my friend ordered vegetable Pho. We split the shrimp egg rolls. Shrimp egg rolls were good but they didn't clean the shrimp, so...shrimp poop. I can also look beyond that because the Pho was damn good. The broth was nice and light, plenty of noodles and chicken. They top it with the standard green onions and cilantro. All in all, quite enjoyable. Would definitely come back again.

I do have a funny note to add from when we paid our check(we usually split it). I finished signing and the waiter brought over my friend's check and he looked at me and said very sternly ""Give her the pen!"" I was like ""whoa!"" I have a pretty good sense of humor, so as soon as he was out of sight we busted up laughing. No sugarcoating, no pen stealing.

I ordered a Combo Pho and a Vietnamese Coffee, and my friend ordered the Beef Pho. I was initially worried that a regular wouldn't be enough for me, but I was actually blown away by the generosity of the portion sizes. The previous reviews weren't kidding when they mentioned that they were generous with their toppings and meats. The flavor of the broth was also on point. I would rate the Pho 6/5 stars. The Vietnamese coffee, on the other hand, was a little lacking. It was very sweet and I couldn't really taste the coffee, so next time I think I would try out one of their Thai Teas instead. 

Overall, I had a great experience! I'll definitely be back.",yN7zjo2FlkPYcBfVMxoxkg,1,1,4,T8cyMa6XOh5SufQTlsEF2Q
4046912,2018-05-31,0,ygaOvp0PLBYaYeN9cZAlGg,"Let me start by saying I've been coming since they opened and this has been one of my go to spots for Vietnamese food. I think things started off better when I first started coming and lately it has been slightly declining, but it's still very good. It used to be a 4-4.5 experience for me and this last visit was maybe a 3.5.

My wife and I came last weekend with a friend from Cali and he loved the food. 

We started off with 2 plates of spring rolls, one with charbroiled pork and one with charbroiled chicken. Both were pretty good.

Our friend ordered the Bun Bo Xao Xa (31) which is the Vermicelli bowl with lemon grass stir-fried beef. He devoured it and said it was right on par with the best places in Cali, and a huge portion. 

My wife ordered the beef stew with egg noodles. This is usually one of my go to dishes because I love the flavor of the broth and the texture of the egg noodles is slightly firm and bouncy and the beef is usually fairly tender. Unfortunately, the noodles were really soggy this time and the flavor was pretty good, but it just wasn't the same as times before. She left a little unsatisfied because she was craving the noodles specifically and they just weren't up to par. 

When I order pho here, I usually get the combination or some combination of flank, brisket and rare steak. This time I decided to splurge and I got the ribeye pho. I have no idea why I didn't order this sooner because it's worth the extra $2 for such better quality beef and it was extremely tender. The broth was pretty decent, but I seem to remember it being more flavorful in the past. 

We also ordered a side of charbroiled beef for $3.99. We usually order a side of charbroiled pork. First few times we ordered it, back when it used to only be $2.99, it was more flavorful and tender. The flavor was decent but it just wasn't the same. 

Needless to say, I'm not as happy as I used to be when dining here. But I'll definitely be back, in hopes that things get back to how they used to be.",4UsK-DNdFlw-TEzcdkVcgA,2,0,4,iqs8N6M66HW3nIy0kSastQ

4107094,2016-03-24,4,ygaOvp0PLBYaYeN9cZAlGg,"Las Vegas is certainly not the first city that comes to mind when you think of Vietnamese food. However, new restaurants like this one might start to change that mindset.

Well, relatively new anyway. Viet Noodle Bar has been open for several months now, but I've neglected to visit it until now despite hearing warm reviews. When my mom inexplicably expressed interest in Vietnamese food after flying in from San Jose (a true Viet food mecca), this place was at the top of my list. Thus, I navigated down Spring Mountain Road and into this narrow plaza between Decatur and Lindell.

We were seated promptly after we waved hello at an employee. It looks clean and inviting, down to the easy-to-read menus with both Vietnamese and English food names. The television sets were all on ESPN, which was broadcasting a game involving the NBA-leading Warriors. Service and food prep time were reasonable.

#44 Com Bo Luc Lac ($12.95): stir-fried filet mignon (more commonly known as ""shaking beef"") with rice. They dared to serve this without any sauce included, which meant a lot. The beef was tender and well-seasoned, and they were sufficiently complemented by delicious grilled onions, pickled carrot and daikon, and fresh lettuce and cucumber. The rice wasn't especially flavorful, but it did the job.

#59 Banh Xeo ($10.95): simply referred to as ""Vietnamese Crepe,"" this is a savory, entree-sized dish of crispy rice flour and turmeric folded and filled with bean sprouts, small shrimp, and pork. Pickled carrot and daikon, cucumber feature here too, as well as two fragrant herbs. It's intended to be eaten wrapped in lettuce, but I ended up lazily eating the lettuce on the side later on. The array of veggies represents Vietnamese cuisine well, but the ""crepe"" batter, as it were, is a little bit on the sweet side, and the protein portion is a little lacking.

#24 Mi Hai VI Kho ($9.95): egg noodle with seafood, served ""dry."" I didn't taste much of this, but I got to try the broth on the side with fish. Lovely seasoned broth, moist and flaky fish. My mom did enjoy it overall.

I'll probably come back to Viet Noodle Bar soon to try other dishes. With a wide array of traditional Vietnamese dishes to sample on the menu - not just noodles, but pho, rice dishes, grilled meats, and even dessert - this restaurant has a lot of promise.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,12,10,4,sgxeSYwcnH4JZKXnjYbaPQ

4126137,2016-09-06,18,ygaOvp0PLBYaYeN9cZAlGg,"Viet Noodle Bar is my family's go to place for Vietnamese food.  Both of my parents are 100% Vietnamese and they are extremely particular on where they go out to eat for Vietnamese food so I think it is saying a lot when my parents and I come here regularly.  The service is always consistent, friendly, and efficient here.  The place is a lot nicer than some of your typical Chinatown restaurants here in town and it is very clean too...always a plus. 

Our go to dishes:
-Pho (Small Bowl - $7.95/Large Bowl - $8.95) - The small bowls are quite large so keep that in mind, usually I get the Pho Tai (rare steak) and it is delicious.  The Pho Dac Biet is another good option if you want everything in your pho.  Be sure to use the fixings they give you in your pho too!  I like to use some sriracha, hoisin sauce, bean sprouts, and lime in mine. 
-Com/Rice Dishes ($8.95 for one choice of meat/$10.95 for two choices of meat) - This dish you get a generous helping of rice, side of cucumbers, and side of pickled carrots/radishes.  For the meats I usually like getting the pork chops or the short rib options, super tasty and super flavorful.  Be sure to use the fish sauce (nuoc mam) to dip the meats in...sounds weird dipping meat into a fish sauce but trust me just do it! 
-Bun (noodle dish)($8.95 for one choice of meat/$10.95 for two choices of meat) - Comes with noodles, lettuce, cucumbers, peanuts, and your choice of meats.  I usually get the egg rolls (cha gio) and the charbroiled pork (thit nuong), again it is imperative you drizzle the fish sauce on top of this dish too!
-Bo Tom Muc Nuong Vi/Nhung Dam ($29.95 enough to feed 2-3 people) - This dish you basically make your own spring roll and they bring out a small grill for your table to cook up your own meats.  Comes with beef, shrimp, and squid.  Definitely for the more adventurous!

Prices are reasonable, service is good, and the food is always delicious here.  If you are looking for a solid Vietnamese restaurant, go here!",hgfqysg2htnJI5bvtIIUjg,35,30,5,_ypiISG05WjNwt7dCK_iRw

Eileen L.'s REFVIEW for Viet Noodle Bar

RELEVANT INFO
* Trendy, new restaurant on the outskirts of Vegas
* Large flat screen TV broadcasting sports
* Beer (and wine?) served here!

EXPECTATIONS GOING IN
* Any Vietnamese restaurant that suffixes the restaurant name with ""Bar"" rather than an obscure number means pricey ethnic food

FOOD
* Though I waited much too long for a meatball pho, the broth stayed hot most of the way through.. just the way I like it!
* The pho broth was relatively rich but not as beefy as I prefer

VALUE
* $7-$10 ish, so average $10-$15 pp

IMPRESSION OVERALL
* While the service of the male server really deterred us from returning here (he spilled broth on my friend without acknowledging/apologizing, Exhibit B: my meatball pho took over 45 minutes... as in, I was watching a Sunday football game at the start of the 2nd half and watched the last few minutes when by soup came), the generous and sweet owner redeemed his restaurant by picking up his staff's slack near the latter half of our meal. It helped that he comped my pho (without my knowledge until the bill arrived) to compensate for the inconvenience of my hangry arse watching my friends eat for an hour
* Considering how loudly obnoxious we were and occupying our table for over two hours, we were surprisingly not kicked out or even scolded

ENVIRONMENT / AMBIANCE
* Clean, partially dim setting with large flat screen TVs with a partial liquor license -- a bit too bright to be a true bar, but I now understand the Owner's logic in naming the restaurant
* Platformed booths hugging 3 walls of the large dining room
* This place is much classier than our usual haunt, Pho Kinh Do, where hungover partygoers may swig on their fifth of hard liquor of choice freely while eating

WOW FACTOR
* The Owner -- in addition to the anecdotes I had already recalled aforementioned, this story rounds out our visit here nicely: one of our friends packed up her leftovers and left it in the restaurant. Luckily we were being good Asians and loitering outside the restaurant, so we witnessed the cute Owner running out of the restaurant to reunite my friend with her leftovers.

When we arrive, the restaurant was half empty. I wrote my name on the list & stood at the door waiting to be seated. It took a while to get seated & orders in. We had to flag down 2-3 people to finally get our orders in.

Now, growing up in a Vietnamese household & LA/OC, I'm familiar with the dishes we ordered, below. I'm also use to eating delicious food & receiving bad service (freaking asians!!), but I return for the tasty meals. 

The dishes were below mediocre. If I had tried it the first time here, I would never order it again. Not only that, the service is horrible. My brothers dish came out after everyone else finish our meal, that's after we had to flag down 3 people to remind & ask them for it.

Goi Cuon- it was ok.

Bo Nhung Cuon- the lemon grass seasoning for the beef was really good in the spring roll. 

Bun Rieu- this is one of my favorite noodle dishes but it was a disappointment. 

Bo Luc Lac- the beef was bland, dry. We had to hassle the server 2-3 times for salt/pepper/lime, which should of been brought out with the dish by default.

Bun Bo Hue- it was ok, nothing spectacular about it. We had to hassle a couple people for chili oil to make the broth ""Bun Bo Hue"" spicy!

Mi Xa Xiu- the dish they forgot to bring out. There was nothing BBQ about it. The meat looked like boiled pork. When we brought up the issue, they said that's how Xa Xiu is... what a lie! 

Vermicelli Noodles- my parents got this. They were not impressed but ill leave it at that.

Overall, I will not go back to this restaurant. I do not recommend it to anyone that wants good Vietnamese food. Their food was disappointing & service is below satisfaction. I would rather give another restaurant a shot.",Vm6aED6NRat_ZI8am6_moA,6,0,1,ueeiA8Oe1jK0ZQhOjtU81A

I'm not usually a meat person, but the grilled chicken and shrimp in my bún were out of this world!

My friend had beef pho and hot tea, and the total bill was $27!! And they were BIG portions! Plus, the atmo was modern and chic, and VERY clean (restrooms too).

A bit of nostalgia. I did not have any Pho here, but I had the charbroiled beef lettuce and rice noodle/paper wraps and added a side of nem nuong (pork meatballs). This dish was very good, the beef was marinated perfectly with garlic and scallions, the pork meatballs were perfectly seasoned. I could not get over how great they served the rice paper with the hot water so that you are able to make your own rolls. Usually the rice paper cracks or is not pliable enough, but they were able to serve it in a little holder with hot water to dip it in, and the paper turned out perfectly!

4265827,2015-11-17,2,ygaOvp0PLBYaYeN9cZAlGg,"I've decided the best pho broth in Vegas goes to viet noodle bar. I've been here a few times, and the combination pho bowl has gone from large to a smaller size for their ""regular"" bowl. I'm kind of bummed about that, but their increasing popularity may be to blame. 

The meat melted in my mouth the first time, and the quality has gone down a bit, but the broth has been consistently good, so I can live with it. 

They have a variety of choices for the spring rolls, and my fave so far has been the Charboiled pork versus the shrimp. The shocker was the fried calamari. It's most likely the frozen kind, but they serve it with a spicy mayo that was pretty dang good-- definitely unexpected for a pho place. 

I hope they keep their pho broth consistent since that's the main appeal for me. 

The only disappointment here were the egg rolls. I say they're slightly below average. 

I'll definitely be back to try other dishes.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,6,7,5,mFHNs7QUMU0EpFIGOR490A

This item requires self cooking like KBBQ and can be a fun way to learn or show off your spring roll wrapping skills.  This comes with a plate filled with thin slices of raw beef marinated in garlic, a set of small spring roll wrappers, and a plate filled with various veggies including mints, basil, fermented radish/carrots, cucumbers, and bean sprouts. Two types of dipping sauce is provided: fish sauce, and some type of shrimp paste. The paste is a bit too thick and strong in flavor for me. I prefer to use fish sauce and add a heavy scoop of chili into it. 

The Thai ice tea is pretty good, but can be on the sweet side. 

The service was awesome. Servers were friendly and quick to help. We came on a Thursday night and the place was filled but did not have a wait. 

The restaurant is located at the entrance of a plaza, and I never seem to have trouble parking. However there aren't many spots because it is shared with other businesses.

I was excited to see what all the hype was about. So we decided to try it out instead of our usual spot. When we got there it was a little busy which is no big deal, we don't mind a wait for really good food. So we waited about 5 minutes, and then the server told us there was a booth thats available. We started walking there and all of the sudden another server popped up right as we got there and said ""No! This is for someone else"" it was very loud and I mean i don't care about a booth anyways but do you need to be so loud about it? 
Anyways we got seated at an awkward table meant for 4. Thats fine, we just wanted our pho! We got the calamari for an appetizer because I love calamari. I neveeeer pass it up. I also ordered the beef flank pho, and my boyfriend got the brisket pho. 
The Calamari was OK, nothing special about it. Nice flavor, and I liked the dipping sauce. 
Now, for the pho. We didnt get any toppings to add to the pho which kind of surprised us, we're used to bean sprouts, basil, lime, jalapeno....etc. But okay, we can live without it! The brisket pho my boyfriend got was great, he loved it. MY pho however....was a different story. It started off great, but I soon noticed all I had was FAT. Literally. All fat, no meat. I didnt order their fatty flank. I ordered FLANK. So it's very very disappointing to find a legit pile of fat in my pho. I included a picture of the fat i picked out for proof, and that wasn't all the fat. There was more in the bowl but it was so gross I couldn't finish the dish. The sad part too was that their portions are incredibly small! We're used to huge portions from other pho places. Honestly I was just sooo sad. On top of that it seems like our server forgot about us. We were left alone not being checked on, or asked of we were ready for a check for what seemed like FOREVER. There was a table behind us with a group of people that got there after us, ate their food, and ended up leaving BEFORE us. We were so annoyed we eventually tracked down another server who kindly helped us out and grabbed our check for us. 
If the service was great and outstanding, we would have come back to give this place another shot. But the combo of disappointing food and bad service left us wanting to never come back here again.",wD5cNaaNSyVorLtn0Dx_GA,3,0,2,M0vDQ2tO9PmUokEwKoPAMA

I had the Oxtail Pho. It came with three GIANT nuggets of oxtail, soaked in a broth rich with clove and anise. With the addition of a couple sprigs of basil and just a touch of lime (and I always kick up the heat)...this is one of the best, heartiest, most succulent bowls of pho I've ever had!!

I ordered the large pho with flank, and it was delicious as always! There's nothing like having hot steam fill your glasses while you go in for a bite. The soup was hot, which is always a plus!

For our appetizer, we ordered egg rolls and spring rolls. First off, the spring roll was okay. It wasn't the best and didn't have that freshness I like from the vegetables. The egg rolls were great though. They were so hot you could see the steam coming out when I took a bite. 

Tip: Wrap your egg roll in the lettuce and other vegetables and dip it in the fish sauce! Yummy!

I also ordered a to go order of a small pho with raw steak and the portion was about 1/3 of my order when I ate there. So if you plan on ordering to go, forget about it.

Before I drop the bomb on this place I will be nice today and give them a three stars.  The food deserves that much credit.  First of, we were here for a surprise party of 25.  The waiters were all cool looking with their tattoos and man-buns (like me!) But that's as good as I am going to be.

Ok, I am about to go in.  First of, parking lot SUCKS.  No spots and there are multiple restaurants here and you can only fit 20 cars? Second, the place is TIGHT! You are back to back with people unless you are one of the cool young hip kids who gets a booth.  Third, slowest service ever.  A lot of the people in the party ordered Pho and they took 20 or so minutes to bring one bowl.  I know they have other customers but see I am now Yelping my ass off and I am keeping it real.  This place has the worst customer service.  And lastly and worst thing about this place, the waiters do not pay attention who ordered what.  He was even  getting overwhelmed when he asked ""is the check going to be split?"" People were giving him multiple answer and I can see him sweat.  His man bun was starting to get irritated it started moving.  I mean if you are getting a huge party HAVE A GAME PLAN to split it up with another waiter.  This one dude was overwhelmed and tried to play it cool.  When our party asked him questions he was impatient with his answers and even short with some people.  Don't be rude! People are paying for your salary so don't act like it's too much trouble to answer whats the difference between crispy noodle or soft noodle.  Anyway, again I
am not going to be bias by this first experience.  But I will update my review once I visit again.  If you are coming here for a relaxing time - DON'T!.  If you are coming here for food and don't give two flying pigs if you get treated badly or not or wait for food for 3hrs then come.  The food is good.  But not worth the headache on a WEDNESDAY NIGHT! Are you serious guys!! hahaha I ordered lemongrass beef.  Everyone was ordering it on Yelp! It was good but they put a lot of ""lettuce"" on the bottom to make the dish fuller than what it is.  It was still good but I wanted Pho on this windy Vegas night.  The only thing that was warm on me was my face because I kept eating the Jalapeno and I kept putting hot sauce on my food.

Served with the usuals: romaine lettuce, various fresh herbs, pickled daikon and carrots, and cucumbers. This dish also came with rice paper to make your own rolls. Plus, their fish and anchovy sauces. Amazingly delicious and a great interactive dish. You dip the rice paper in a bowl of hot water for just a bit to get it pliable and build whatever you want. I loved putting every component in it with a touch of Sriracha; perfection. The ground beef patty in betel leaf was so flavorful. I loved everything!

#59 Banh Xeo ($10.95): Vietnamese Crepe filled with shrimp, meats, and lots of vegetables including bean sprouts. I've had crepes very similar to this in Thailand, so definitely already a fan. It also comes with romaine lettuce, various fresh herbs, pickled daikon and carrots, and cucumbers. The crepe is more egg-like and very thin and crispy. I don't really care for the uncooked bean sprouts, but otherwise, great dish and low-carb!

#37 Com (Rice) comes with 1 item ($8.95), 2 items ($10.95), or 3 items ($12.95). We opted for three items: Suon Nuong (Pork Chop), Bo Nuong (Charbroiled Beef), and Tom Nuong (Charbroiled Shrimp). I absolutely love rice. Especially Jasmine rice. I'll eat it as much as I can get it. The meats were all very packed with flavor and so delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and would eat it every day. The second time I ordered this dish, I got the Charbroiled Short Rib instead of the Beef (it tastes very similar to Korean Kalbi).

#62 Goi Ngo Sen Tom Thit (Sm, $7.95): Lotus Root Salad with shrimp and pork; dressed with fish sauce. The salad has a nice balance of textures with the same great vegetables and herbs available on most dishes.

Chicken porridge: 5/5 I would highly recommend this if you wanted something that soothes a sickness or cures a hangover. Or if you just wanted something warm. Be sure to mix it up well so the juices from the chicken mixes with the rice and gives it more flavor. The garnishes on top also went well with the porridge. 

Crispy egg noodle with beef and vegetable stir fry: 4/5 the noodles were light and crispy, but it felt very fattening to eat since the noodles were deep fried and not just pan fried til it was crispy.

[Environment] This place was alright, the parking was a pain, which took several drive arounds until someone left. Inside is pretty spacious and you are welcomed by a wall of polaroids which I thought was pretty cool. However the polaroids looked over-exposed and washed out. The decor on the walls were pretty nice and entertaining to look at.

[Service] I honestly didn't have good service. I felt like it took a really long time until someone came by just to ask us for drinks. I also noticed 2 other groups who came after us got their drinks ordered before us and it was by the same waitress/waiter too! Not sure why we were neglected...We had several wrong orders and confusion that occurred and the vibe I was feeling from them felt like they really didn't want to be there nor serve us Refills took forever to come and I felt like we had to flag someone down just to get additional service.

[Food] The food wasn't too bad. I ordered the Bun Bo Hue, which didn't seem to be to flavorful, it was a little water'd down and which resulted in lack of flavor. The lemon grass pork lettuce wrap also felt like it was overly cooked and lacked flavor. Even the shrimp paste sauce didn't have a rich flavor to it. Normally it does too! We asked to order beer and I felt like out of the 5 choices of imported beer to choose from, only 1 was available. 

Overall, I don't think I will return to this location. I'm not sure if it was because it was prime time or not enough workers, but we felt like we were not wanted there. Hope the best for their future business.

I first came here a long time ago for the ox tail pho. I really enjoyed it,  they give a lot of ox tail and the portion is probably enough for two.  
I've also ordered the bun bo hue here,  it honestly wasn't my favorite.  The broth was strangely sweet and didn't taste authentic.  This was a long time ago so maybe it's changed since then?

Yesterday I got a small pho with rare steak,  tendon and the beef balls for an extra $1.50. Omg the best part was the beef balls!  They're big with pieces of tendon and really flavorful.  I tried the beef balls at pho Kim long the other day and they were disgusting and flavorless compared to the ones here.  :) also try the fatty flank!  It adds a really good flavor.

I read a lot of reviews saying customer service was lacking but I had the complete opposite experience. Well, we came when it just opened and there was only one other party dining at the time so that may be why? But the workers were very attentive and kept checking up on us to make sure we were doing alright. 

The decor of the place is really nice, there's a bar area in the back and their wall designs are cute. Their little teapot set is also super cute. So overall, good first experience.

The reason i am not giving this place a 4 star is because..

1st. We wrote our names on the list and there was 3 parties ahead of us and the waiting room was so tiny people had to wait outside which is no big deal. We waited 15 mins and notice why haven't we got called yet even though i knew it was busy that day but those 3 parties ahead of us were like 2 people -__- so we went inside checked the list and they crossed out our names. Wth they never bothered to go outside and call the names.Were they too lazy to check outside? Which btw i was by the door and when i said something he didn't bother to apologize and said oh we have a table waiting which is good because i would of left if i had to wait again

2nd. We ordered our food. 20 mins pass giving them the benefit of the doubt that its just so busy they'll come. 15 mins after i was losing my cool and told the staff why hasn't our food came out yet we've been waiting for over 20 mins now and people that were sitting next to us came after us and finished their food already. He apologized which is good because sometimes they don't say sorry and our waiter never bothered to check up on us. LORD i was just so fed up how the way they treat customers that isn't a big party.

I usually order the Bun Bo Hue (Hue Style Noodle Soup), although the Little Guy always get my portion of the pig's blood cubes (sadly).  The Little Guy and Little Gal always get a side order of egg noodles in chicken broth.  Sometimes, they want a little more which is fine with us.  The Husband usually gets the Pho Dac Biet (Combination Pho) or maybe the Pork Chop with rice. Sometimes we add the Cha Gio (Egg Rolls with Pork and Vegetables) too.

One of my favorite things to order from here is the Bo Nuong Vi (Beef BBQ) or Nhung Dam (Vinegar Hotpot). It's a bit time-consuming, which doesn't always work out when we have the kids with us.  But when it's just the two of us, we like to take over the table and cook our own food and wrap it up in yummy goodness.  I just love eating this, as do many others since you'll see many customers cooking up their protein and wrapping it up.

If you're in the mood for soup, I'd recommend the bun bo hue. It's a spicy beef noodle soup with just the right amount of sweet, salty, sour, and spicy to tickle your taste buds. Not feeling beefy? Get the bun rieu, a tomato broth soup that's topped with pillowy chunks of minced crab paste. So satisfying! 

My favorite is the table top BBQ (bo nuong vi). You basically cook your meat on a grill, then wrap it in rice paper with noodles and veggies. It's filling yet refreshing at the same time. I get that it can be kind of intimidating if you're ordering it for the first time, but don't be shy and just ask for assistance. I'm sure the staff would be happy to teach you how to enjoy this dish. The Vietnamese crepe is also good but a bit skimpy on the filling. I'd request extra meat.

Their menu is extensive where you can choose a variety of options. I ordered the pho with the meat on the side. They give you a decent amount of meat in proportion to the noodle. I thought the small bowl of pho was large enough but if you are really hungry, I recommend upgrading to the large.

Including pho Kim long, Nem nuong bistro, pho so 1, pho bosa, pho kinh do, pho Saigon 8 and other viet places I don't remember, this is by far my favorite one!!

I love their pho!  The broth has the richest, best flavor. It's not just salty... You can taste the sweetness from the beef bones too. They are also super generous wth their portions. I think this is the only pho place where I can't really finish an entire bowl. Their meat is tender and juicy as well.

The service is typical for a pho restaurant: attentive until they think you've been there too long, LOL.  But if you go there just to eat, and not to socialize after for too long, the service is very good.

Most Asian eateries will do it Asia style, I.e. puts down menus, but takes orders before you can even open the menu (let's be honest, Asian people know what they want when they eat out. No need for a menu) drops off food, never returns again...unless you raise your hand to let them know you need something. I understand this, and while also being an American born Asian, I've accepted the cultural difference! Not here. They're really good and also very sweet and prompt about checking back with you to make sure you're enjoying your food. I had to ask for a million different things last night and even I was annoyed with myself. Everyone there was more than happy to get me whatever I needed. Never once made me feel like I was asking for too much!!


As you can read, I'm already ecstatic! More importantly, dang the food was bomb!! I came for pho many times before. I finally decided to tap into my past and retry other Vietnamese cuisine that I have otherwise forgotten about. I tried, for the first time as an adult, Bo/tom nuong vi. My belly was giving me the hour long middle finger for not trying this sooner. For those of you reading this, it's a grill in front of you, self cooking of meat and shrimp, and then rolling yourself up some spring rolls! It's an experience and it's tasty! A lot of multitasking involved so bring someone who can do more than 1 thing at a time. I made this mistake and forcefully ended up with most of the responsibility. HAHA! We also tried the bun bo hue, a spicy noodle dish that I remember disliking as a child. I haven't had it in 19 years. They tossed meat in there like it was about to go out of style! Sooo much meat. I ain't mad about it! Twas tasty. I will say though, My heart still belongs to pho. That's the only Vietnamese noodle soup in my heart. Would I come back here?!

""Because this place makes the best oxtail pho and their blood cake is the best"" my matter of fact reply.

""Blood cake? WTF!"" his exasperated reply.

Sadistic teasing of my bud aside, thanks to a large workforce of first generation Asian Americans, Vegas  boast some of the best Vietnamese food in the country.  That said, from the creator of District One comes Viet Noodle Bar.

The extensive menu is very diverse with classic, authentic Vietnamese dishes along side more ""Americanized"" creations.  There's something for everyone.  Oh and the food is good.

Top props to the oxtail pho.  Matching that of District One, deep, beefy flavor, tons of gelatin that coats the lips.  Fall off the bone tender oxtail.  What's not to like.  

Their standard pho, uses the same beefy broth and is good.  Steaming hot, loads of fresh veg, generous quantity of good quality protein (the tendon is very clean and soft).  Offered in two sizes.  Additional meat available for a modest up charge if your carnivore cravings are in full effect.

Good selection of soups, rice plates and vegetarian dishes.  Have not tried those.  However, do not pass on one of their BBQ (think KBBQ with veggies to wrap the proteins) or in a vinegar hotpot (think shabu shabu with wrapping the proteins then dipping in sauces).  Beef, shrimp, and/or squid, lightly seasoned and drizzled with sesame.  Wrap with classic ""pickled veg"", vermicelli, mint, basil, cucumbers and dip in a chili or fish sauce.  BBQ is more approachable, the vinegar hotpot, imparts a somewhat tart flavor and clear aroma that pairs well with the fish sauce.  In the end, fun and just good eats.

Prices are very fair and in line with other off Strip Vietnamese places.  

Very clean dining room.  Good, friendly, off Strip service.

The egg rolls are amazing, it's about $7 and it has about 4 egg rolls for it. It tasted so good, not over cooked and not too soft, tasted perfect. The inside of the egg roll tasted so good, and the sauce makes it taste sweet. It's a nice balance of flavor and right amount of crunchiness to the outside. 

The pho is amazing, the price is about $7-9 either for a small or large. The small is BIG, and the big is even bigger. I can't believe that they even have a size difference since they're both way too big for me to finish. The meat is really good, taste fresh and has a lot of flavor so you know it's not frozen at least. The noodle is really good, and I AM SO GLAD THEY DID NOT GIVE TOO MUCH NOODLE IN MY PHO. The soup is really good, it's sweet but really savory, I enjoy it so much and it's better than all the other pho places I've been in Las Vegas. 

The meat with rice tasted amazing even though I didn't get it. This costed about $9 and the plate is so big with many different options. They give so much meat compared to other pho places and they're so generous with all the proportion. The meat Is Sweet and has a lot of flavor, it is so soft when you bite into it. The rice is good, not too much water is added in making the rice and we added an egg to it for $2 extra. The egg is amazing, well worth the price and has a lot of flavor. 

However, there are some improvements they need to it. First of all, they need to check your tables a little for frequently since when we are trying to pay the bill, it took about 5 minutes to come to us. Second, the seats at the booths are so uncomfortable, and so sensitive to the person behind you that you see sitting so it kept on wobbling.",huWj8RQlRMB-teVguLMGnw,0,0,5,T5FndhIDtJH8sg-jsNMx6g

Mi Xa Xiu - The BBQ pork that came with the noodles were not the red, sweet deli Cha Siu as the name implies. Instead were fatty pieces of boiled sliced pork and some type of minced meat.

Rice plate - The pork chop portion was tiny, especially after we trimmed the long piece of fat from the outer edge. The beef was cold and tasted as if it hadn't recently been cooked. 

Thit nuong goi cuon - Delicious! They have an entire section of the menu dedicated to spring rolls. Pretty cool.

Pho broth - No flavor. Tasted like a bowl of boiled pho herbs garnished with green onions.

Not once did a staff member come by to see if everything was okay, even after mentioning it to the waiter. 

Further, we placed an order for one type of BBQ (beef/shrimp), and received (and were charged) with the beef, shrimp and squid due to an apparent language barrier between us and our waiter.

Viet Noodle Bar totally resets my expectation for what the culinary heaven in the Sin City is capable of. As  true Yelper, I listened to the past Yelp gurus who found this place and took a group of my fellow foodies there on our culinary pilgrimage in search of the food world beyond the strip. And I'm so glad we did. For appetizer, we ordered #56--a spring roll making kit with charbroiled pork (can't recall or pronounce the name, sorry)--as well as some spring rolls with beef on the side. And let me tell you. When they say charbroiled, they mean it. I loved every single bite of that charbroiled pork since it was flavored perfectly and carried such an awesome aroma of smoked goodness. The vegetables were also very fresh and good for fooling me into thinking my waistline won't be popping out after my trip. As for the main orders, I got a large bowl of pho with rib eye and my friends got the pho dac biet and pho with ox-tail. The meat portion that I got for my pho was really generous. In fact, it might've been the most meat I've ever gotten at a Vietnamese place overall. Since I always get my raw meat on the side to flash cook it right before I eat, it was pretty satisfying to see the pile of meat of that size. The broth didn't carry as much flavor as I had hoped, but I liked the bite that it came with. And let's not forget about the Vietnamese coffee. After a night with 4 hours of sleep, that cup of yumminess was the liquid fuel that helped to keep me awake. I loved thick blend of the sweet and bitter flavors that accompanied with each sip.

Also, no pork blood...but I generally opt out of that anyways.  The broth was mildly spicy with a strong flavor of lemongrass.

I don't know if this is a true Vietnamese place or not (i.e., where it's owned and cooked by a Vietnamese person), but the food was NASTY.  First of all, let me comment on the service.  I don't mind having my order taken by a non-Vietnamese dude, but at least the latter should know the menu.  I would say, I'd like #62 - Goi Ngo Sen Tom Thit, and he'd be like what?  I would have to physically point to that item on the menu.  I ask questions about the menu, he's clueless.  So now to the piece de resistance, the food.  First of all, I hate MSG (b/c of the potential health implications), I think it's a cop out and a cheap way to make ""savory"" food.  A true Viet would actually take the time to make the broth the old fashion way instead of sprinkling some magic powder.  The waiter's answer:  all Vietnamese food has MSG.  As a Vietnamese whose mama cooks everything from scratch, I took offense to it.  I lost my appetite with such stupid answer.  So I order the Goi, which was too sugary and gave me a stomach ache.  The first clue that this place is a crap hole is the fact that there aren't any Vietnamese in there.  Take the hint:  this place SUCKS!!!!",QdJXggRX9CbAqpLmHczMGA,2,0,1,hmO9o4QHvEEKcLteBqzpwA

They have a lot of speciality pho here (rib eye and oxtail). The rib eye is good, but I always go with the classic rare pho tai. 

MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR PHO OIL. They bring out a special blend of pho oil with green onion. If you put a spoonful or two in your pho, it boosts the umami flavor of the pho an extra notch. This is one of the main reasons I love this place. 

Also, their Vietnamese crepe is DELICIOUS. The portion for the crepe is huge. My husband and I share this, but we've also shared it with a group of 4 and it's sufficient.",V3V-7NBRxk5qOfpOw5mTHg,1,0,5,R2zvCrAG-D3tQ530seMyNg

The restaurant is large so there was still plenty of seating available. The menu is really diverse, they have all the main Viet dishes you may be looking for - Pho, Bun Bo Hue, Bun Rieu, Com Tam, Banh Xeo, etc. 

I asked the waiter what the specialty dishes of the restaurant are- he mentioned Bun Bo Hue, Banh Xeo, and Pho Ap Chao. It was really windy and cold out so I opted for Bun Bo Hue. The broth was pretty good, noodles standard, it was served with huyet (pig blood), some kind of pork cha, beef shank, and oxtail. They don't serve BBH with the pork knuckle/pork leg here (which is fine with me because I usually opt out of it anyway). 

Overall the BBH was okay, decent broth but I felt like it was missing the complexity of other BBH's I've had. I have high standards for BBH since half of my fam is from Hue and my auntie makes some bombbb homemade BBH.

For soupy noodles, from pho to bun bo hue, they are spot on.  Try the bun bo hue, the broth is nice and flavorful, satay flavor mixed with scents of lemongrass.  Many places in town are too delicate with this broth of bun bo hue.  It is a test to legitimate a noodle place.  There are restaurants in southern california that only serves this noodle as its main dish.  The pho is consistently good, hot and soothing.  Don't underestimate the temperature of the pho.  Many places in town serves lukewarm broth and by the time you add in basil, culantro and bean sprouts, you might as well be eating gazpacho.

The grilled dishes are really good, same price points as many other places in town.  However, for the side dishes you get with the main, you will need help from 1-2 other friends to finish them all.

I found it a little strange that they do not oil the grill, since the meat kept sticking and burning to it. The sauce was not to my liking as well, but I improvised with some sriracha and hoisin. 

Service was surprisingly friendly for Vietnamese place. The interior is wide open with high ceilings and intimidating fans, which did not do much in terms of getting rid of odor. We stank of meat to high heaven afterwards!

So after our tour of the Neon Museum, we made our way to this non descript strip mall.  Lucky for us, Stephen's mom has a disabled plaque, and we grabbed the last parking spot in the lot.  

The restaurant is the first one nearest the street, and it's a fairly large place.  We still had to put our name down and wait inside the very cramped lobby.  The wait took about 10 minutes and like any other Vietnamese noodle place, the waiter comes by almost immediately to take your order.  We ordered 2 oxtail pho, and since Stephen's mom doesn't eat much I got her a tiny side bowl of the pho and I was going to give her 1/2 of my oxtail.

I guess I am spoiled by living in Orange County, the 2nd largest population of Vietnamese outside Saigon.  The oxtail pho here was good, but not great.  The oxtail was chewy and did not fall off the bone.  I actually gnawed on it like a little puppy.  Not pretty.  The flavor was ok, but what offset that was the super generous portion of noodles they gave.

I also ordered the chicken wings which had a nice kick to it and went great with the pho.  Overall its a good place if you want a bowl of pho, and a place that's stays open until 6 am... yes, 6 am (they open at 9 am).

I was here Tuesday (7/25). As soon as I got in we got seated right away. We were sitting at our table for a good 15min and no one came to take our order yet. It was only 3/4pm. So it was after lunch and a little too early for dinner. They weren't busy at all. As far as I remember, there was only 5 other tables that were full. When they finally took our order, it didn't take too long for our food to come to us (+1 star) the food is great here actually. I got the combination pho, charbroiled pork rice plate & egg rolls. Everything was delicious! While I eat I tend to drink a lot of water. My cup was already empty. What I usually like to do is l leave my cup at the end of the table so they could see that I needed a refill of water. My boyfriends cup & mines were at the end of the table. An employee walked passed us looked at our table and didn't bother to refill it. No one once checked up on us the whole time we were there. We waited probably a good 20min. My boyfriend was upset so he went to the front & asked if we could some water. This wouldn't have been a problem in the first place if someone actually came to check up on us. This experience wasn't the best out of all the times I've came. But we had bad service the time before this as well.

Well I'm writing this after 3-4 bad incidents. Forget about being served even water if the place is busy with larger parties. The two or three servers there become so concentrated on that one large party that two top tables are completely ignored. This has happened to me at least 3 times. I've had to waive the servers down for water and to take our order, which of course never came out until I had to walk to the counter and ask where our food is (minimum 45 min later). I work in the food and industry myself and I completely understand what it's like to get swamped.

First, it closes pretty late at 2AM. Second, it's not as crazy and disorganized as other pho places. Third, the broth is so much better and so delicious! Lastly, SERVICE was seriously on point. Upon entering, you can see the lovely design of the restaurant and how spacious/open it is. You're immediately greeted by staff and they are very patient with you when you're completely indecisive like me! Haha. Plus they check up on you frequently and they are open to questions as well. 

What we ordered?
The buttery garlic wings! Contains six pieces and it was super crunchy and cooked to perfection. Good amount of butter and garlic. The taste of the garlic wasn't too strong at all. 

The famous oxtail pho everyone is talking about is another dish we ordered and let me tell you, the bowls were freaking huge! You seriously can share with someone. The broth was to die for and the oxtail, super tender and very easy to eat. There was so much oxtail! If I could describe the portion of the oxtail, put your two fists together. 

Bún bò huê was the dish I ordered. Oh my god. I've never been so excited to talk about this dish until now. The broth was super delicious especially with lime squeezed all over it with chili. The tendons, the pork belly, the beef, and the meatballs made me so much better. So much meat in one bowl. Our server saw my face and he told me the guy at the other table had the same reaction lol. 

Pork chop with rice was ordered by my friend. Pork chop was huge and very savory and soft to eat. Definitely cooked to perfection. The rice and egg made it better along with the fish sauce provided. 

The lemon grass beef on the side was super good as well. Full of flavor. We ordered it as a side and it's such a deal because they give you so much. 

Keep in mind also that when you order rice dishes, you can add three meats for a reasonable price even with soups which makes me happy. I hate sticking to just one choice of meat.

Will I be back?
Hell yes! This place is definitely a five star for me. I love how the restaurant set up is, it's not disorganized, and the service is outstanding compared to other pho restaurants. The food was phenomenal as well. I completely loved every bite of it. Reason why I give it a 5 is because I've never had such great food and service at a pho restaurant in Las Vegas before.

This time it took me to Viet Noodle Bar. Large, spacious and clean looking restaurant nestled in Chinatown of Vegas. 

Liked the pho rib-eye and spring rolls. 
Didn't really like the thai iced tea nor the vietnamese coffee w/ condensed milk, both of which were too sweet. 

++PROS++
+ Clean, lighter color broth that is tasty and not too salty or packed with MSG
+ Rib-eye meat is very tender
+ Huge portions

--CONS--
- Pricey. $11.95 for rib-eye pho
- Noodles are a bit too soft and clumped together
- RIb-eye meat is also SUPER clumped together, had a rather annoying time unclumping my meal

Until just recently, I discovered that areas outside The Strip actually have better food, that are cheaper and tastier. A couple months ago I had a week of business conference in Vegas and I tried so many different excellent restaurants outside of The Strip and one of them was Viet Noodle Bar.

So, when I visited Vegas again with my bf's family, I took them to Viet Noodle Bar for some hearty Asian soups and they all loved the food here.

We ordered 3 bowls of pho with brisket, 1 egg noodle with BBQ pork, and 1 order of the BBQ beef and shrimp (their specialty). Their pho bowls were amazing, really warmed our hearts and souls. I did5 get to try the egg noodle, but it looked really tasty. I was so busy cooking the beef and shrimp on the griller to make our own spring rolls. It was a fun experience to craft your own spring rolls, putting as many pickles as I wanted. 

I really recommend ordering the BBQ beef and shrimp, grilled by yourself. And also some pho bowls to wash away the sinfulness of Vegas.",C2vKwWgOF-vUQ43WUEoqwg,1,0,4,f82Q-QuiWjn6f6FTKvvhsg

The dish was a touch salty, but otherwise, quite good.  Noodles were AL dent and wontons were flavorful.  7.5/10.  Husband got a MI xao with seafood.

5918681,2015-11-03,6,ygaOvp0PLBYaYeN9cZAlGg,"First impression of Viet Noodle Bar.  Definitely a very clean Vietnamese restaurant, with a lot of TVs showing sports game (at least at the time of my visit).  It felt like a pho restaurant and sports bar hybrid, without the annoying cigarette smoke and greasy spoons that are allegedly washed.  It is very roomy too, unlike many mom and pop type restaurants that error on the side of cramming more tables and chairs than the premise can comfortably accommodate.

Based on reading the tips and glancing over some reviews, I knew I had to give their Oxtail Pho a try on my first visit.  Plus the outside temperature is cool, a bit breezy, almost fall-like weather, so a bowl of steamy hot bowl of noodles is perfect.

The waiter that took my order was courteous, not too pushy, and gave me plenty of time to explore and take pictures of their menu.  I also didn't have to wait too long when asking for my bill or the credit card to be processed.  

The Oxtail Pho also came out of the kitchen fairly quickly, but that is typical of any well run pho restaurant (it is not like they start cooking your from scratch the moment they receive the customer's order).  The portion is good, and there were several large oxtails in the bowl.  The flavor of the broth is good, and the oxtail was cooked fairly well (tender but not to the point that it will easily yield its tasty morsel with a bit of pressure).  I didn't feel that they skimped on the noodles either, which is great (since I always get that feeling at the most popular pho restaurant in Vegas frequented by tourists that's shall not be named). 

Next time I visit I will likely try one of their vermicelli noodle or rice plates (sadly i did not see any Broken Rice aka Cm tm dishes in their menu).",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,9,9,4,Lsn48nHqu6J80F04iGiMSA

I also ordered the fish porridge too.. quite tasty! for dessert I always order the FLAN !!! omg its the best flan ever! it has a nice coffee taste to it. I order it every time if they don't sell out. I normally don't order much of the drinks cause for some reason its overly sweet most of the time! just order water... lol 

Overall i love this place. its open late! food is delicious! service isn't bad. Atmosphere is cool.. you can have a booth so its pretty private too when you sit at a booth.",xIjw368KoWqmAZ7JUrwf3A,0,0,4,OUH5gYxoiZbbuHHYpLIbrw

As times goes on, maybe I'll update the review in the event their food quality and taste become more memorable.

Located off the strip, the restaurant sits near Chinatown in Las Vegas and just recently opened. 

I ordered the Dry Noodle Soup the first time I went and wasn't too impressed. It didn't really have much flavor and oh my god... It had a pretty crappy portion size. The waiter came back to ask for feedback and I gladly told them the same thing. Usually for my dry noodle pho, the portion sizes should be identical, if not the same as the soup version. The serving size was at best 1/2-2/3 my expectations.

I tried the egg rolls and they weren't too bad.

I decided to check out this place again and went the next day ordering Combination Pho (with soup this time). The portions were better, but the soup was bland. My friends  ordered the Oxtail Pho and it was really good and tender. I highly recommend ordering that one. 

TL;DR: Very clean pho restaurant (which is a PLUS) with a good amount of options. I wouldn't mind going back! The servers left a great impression too.",VFr6lODPXmakSm4BFebKww,4,5,4,7v0dzaRsoKqAl-UDWCvEFw

This is one of the rare places that serve oxtail pho which opens up the flavor of the broth even more!  Portions are quite generous and the place is very clean compared to most places. If you're craving pho late night, they close at 2am which is wonderful. Other pho spots that are 24 hours or late night doesn't compare to the quality of food here. I've been to many pho places in both California (southern and northern) and Las Vegas and this is by far one of the best I've had the pleasure of eating at.

It was  strong but not bitter and they put enough condensed milk and ice cubes to perfect. Service was average. Our waiter gave my husband wrong order. He ordered number 35 and they brought him number 34.  He gave it a try anyway. The fish sauce was too sweet to our taste. Charbroiled meat was good but to improve the taste ,they could add some green onion and crushed peanut and adjust the fish sauce.

I arrived here for dinner with my friend and the restaurant is large and very clean. Service was attentive without being smothering. My friend and I took a little bit of time catching up so it took us a while to decide what to order.

We finally ordered and our food arrived quickly. The server kept the refills coming without interrupting our conversation. My vermicelli bowl was good, nothing mind-blowing but the meat was well-cooked, moist and flavorful.

The meal was great and I'm interested in trying out the rest of their menu.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,12,4,IYOqxtzU6_yZW3CSSDLNZw

Noodles cooked perfectly and if you want something a little extra like Jalapenos or Onions they don't nickel and dime you.  I like their vegetable Pho but my favorite is the Pho with Rare Steak, Flank, and Brisket.  I am not a huge fan of the super fatty meats so I ignore the tendon, tripe and fatty flank options.  Their pork chops are cooked in a sauce that is to die for.  They can be a little dry but taste fantastic.  They offer typical sauces on the table but it is the chili sauce not on the table which is more of a paste that you want to ask for.  Excellent!",Rw1QE99aazERB_z3S8D8nA,0,0,5,zJi8rOpz8Jsv9Ft--TjJbQ

This place is amazing.....everything from the clean modern granite table decor, friendly waiter and customer service outstanding. 

My bun rieu satisfied my every craving. Wasn't too sweet due to tomato or salty. The flavor was crabby and it was the perfect bowl! Only bad thing.....was a little pricey ($12.95) than what I'm use to in CA. - Better than my mama's. I asked for extra mint and jalapeno and they brought me HUGE plate of it at no extra charge. They also provided extra napkins in a cute little basket. 

They have a full bar menu. Liquor, wine and beer. And.....its nice and air conditioned since it's 95° at 10:30am in Vegas.  And it's packed at 11am now. Will definitely be back.",sV3e8tD-ThT_PogmJdYMkA,1,0,5,ee7KnxbVKu2_THTnsOFeAg

The oxtail meat was perfection. So tender and fatty (honestly, my favorite part), it definitely hit the spot and my sore throat is nearly gone!

So the morning after while all my friends were dead..... asleep HAHA couple of my friends and I decided to go eat some delicious pho while the other enjoy their rest in the dungeon... (what it looked like in our hotel rooms) 

I really wanted oxtail pho, this place and pho 87 were the top two choices but decided to give this place a try. 

The place was very spacious and it wasn't too crowded and it looked as though a lot of locals were dining there. SCORE! haha
 
I immediately ordered a young coconut to cure my hangover.... you have to scoop the meat and eat the meat with the coconut water and it'll work wonders trust me. 

We ordered the beef spring roll. How do they make their beef so soft? SO DELICIOUS

The shrimp eggroll DO NOT PASS order it...take a dying friend if you have to you must get it! 

I ordered my favorite ox tail pho and it was BOMB. But .... it's really hard to eat an it's hot... so just watch your fingers haha 

My friend ordered the bun bo hue .... WOW!! The soup is a bit thicker than the usual bunbo I get but they sure know how to make their bun bo! I said can she get a ""BUN BO HUE"" and he gave a look and smirked and said ""you mean beuon bo hueeee..."" yes, sorry I'm sorry jeez. -___- haha

The place is really clean and the air condition is on point HAHAHAH if you want to explore a bit out of the strip come for the pho here .... if you're REALLY hungover but really want pho just go to treasure island... their pho is decent too and they have room service pho AHHAA",5PpB7xXgf9oAAQoEVWfL6g,7,8,4,Wv2V9mWmte9cg4PZ1YyDnw

Their pho is one of the best I ever had, spring roll and egg roll are super good! If you come here order the combination pho with meat balls meat on the side ask for extra white onion, the green onion inside the fat soup is super good and try their Thai tea.

The shrimp tasted old and smelled fishy.  We started with a calamari appetizer that was awful as well.  Tasted like it came out of a frozen bag.  I expected Thai style calamari.
