I went to pick up my pizza when it was supposed to be ready and had to wait another 10 minutes because there was ONE person working (cooking, taking phone calls, running the cash register, etc.). The guy working did a great job, was apologetic, and really is a rock star.

Now I completely understand that this is the McDonalds of Pizza. And once in a while, I'm ok with that. Why not? Everyday can't be gourmet. If it were, then gourmet would lose it's luster.

So if you want a cheap and fun take-home meal that, at least for me, will satisfy a very particular craving, then look no further than PJ's.

I get the two large 3 topping special for 12 bucks. Mine gets mushroom, pepperoni, and spicy Italian sausage. Always free extra sauce, always crispy bake, always original crust, always square cut, always extra Garlic sauce cups. The other is usually a black olive, mushroom and sausage pie, same instructions.

Prior to today, I have never tried Papa Johns pizza. We've been ordering from Pizza Hut for years, but decided to go with Papa Johns today after hearing about their $11 promo for any large pizza, up to 7 toppings or any specialty. We thought the Pizza Hut $10 large 1 topping was a deal, so our minds practically exploded when we started making our $11 pizza on the Papa Johns website. 

We ended up getting the Spinach Alfredo specialty pizza, but also added chicken, bacon, and mushrooms on top. The order came out to $14.59 because of the tax and delivery fee and was delivered with 2 minutes to spare!

We opened up the box and took in the mouth watering aroma of mushrooms, bacon, cheese, and chicken. Then we practically ripped it apart like savages (after I took pics of course). The cheese was just perfect, as Roxi V. described below ""slightly browned and melted."" The toppings were spread out evenly and, surprisingly, they even gave us a small container of garlic dip. Many other pizza joints will charge you for any dipping sauces. 

As for the taste, it was almost like having spinach artichoke dip on a pizza. I was pretty amazed at how they were able to make every single topping stand out in its own way; nothing stood out more than another.The crust was perfectly soft on the inside and browned on the outside.

I've had Papa John's before.  Our pie was ""The Meats.""  It should have been better.
