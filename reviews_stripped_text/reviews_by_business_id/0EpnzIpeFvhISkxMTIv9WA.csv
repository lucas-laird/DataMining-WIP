Great food! I got Brown Stew Chicken meal and it was excellent. Huge plate of meat plus rice and beans, veg, and a plaintain. Yummy. Meat was falling off the bone.

1208890,2017-04-19,0,0EpnzIpeFvhISkxMTIv9WA,"Once upon a time, we took a 9 day vacation to Jamaica in 2015... and it was the best thing ever. He was obsessed with jerk chicken, I was obsessed with beef patties. We missed it so... but then we found this place and were absolutely ecstatic! We were able to get our fix and, oh my, was it reminiscent of our time there! 

THE FOOD: 5 STARS!
- The food here is definitely authentic and gives you a real taste of the flavors they have in Jamaica. We ordered the JERK CHICKEN ($14.00) which comes with 3 sides (although we were not asked what sides we wanted... which I will discuss later on in the service rating) and we were given rice with red beans, steamed vegetables, and boiled bananas. Very filling and definitely had that jerk spice kick! 
- I personally came for the BEEF PATTIES ($3.00), which is their version of an empanada meat-filled type pastry -- which hit the spot! I also tried their CHICKEN PATTIES ($3.00), which to my surprise, was more of a curry medley. I enjoyed it, but that's only because I like curry.

THE PRICE: 3 STARS.
- I think we were surprised when we saw the prices of the food and definitely feel that the pricing of the food here was very high. The entrees range from $12-25, with side orders being $4-8. 

THE SERVICE: 1 STAR. 
- Be warned that the service here is deathly slow. Whether it was to order, or asking for a water refill, or asking for the check... we ended up spending a good 2+ hours here. Granted there were a few other tables filled at the same time, not sure why there was only ONE person working the whole restaurant on a weekend. We requested an extra plate, 5 minutes passed -- nothing. I went up to the counter to ask for it again, I was told it would be brought to me... which took another 5 minutes. FOR A PLATE! Getting water refills took forever, not to mention everything else. Oh, and they didn't have any patties available -- they said it would take 30 minutes to bake... 45 minutes passed, none were brought to us, but I notice they put then under the heat lamps at the front! It's just the little things, you know?

Would we come back? To get our Jamaica nostalgia taste fix, yes... but maybe only once or twice a year, when we have hours to spare. :P If anything I will just call ahead and pre-order beef patties to pick up.",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,9,2,3,BxTwQx6TbVxq7jlbA8zS7A

I only went inside because it took me nearly 30 minutes to get there at the advice of someone else that the food was good here. I can honestly and sadly tell you he was unequivocally wrong. I ordered the brown stew chicken dinner plate and it was so salty that I could not eat it. I am a salt lover so when food is too salty for someone used to salty food then it's TOO SALTY. In addition the vegetables and cabbage were cooked to death. The carrots were cooked so long they were mush and brown in color. I'm so disappointed as I am from the east coast (BOSTON) and we have some of the best Jamaican restaurants there.

The beef patty was great and I highly recommend it as an app- it's nicely spicy and the crispy, flaky pocket isn't too thick. The oxtails were a good portion, and meaty, but the sauce was minimal and the robust island flavors I was hoping for were toned down. I was excited about the rice and peas, but found that bland and lackluster. Service was polite but location is pretty bare and quiet, needs some sort of decor.

1826981,2017-04-26,0,0EpnzIpeFvhISkxMTIv9WA,"I properly enjoy Jamaican food. I grew up with it on the island & appreciate restaurants in the US that try to, but can't really give you that authentic flavor. Paradise is close to what you would get to the flavors and style on the East coast. It's not the closest to the authentic flavors but close enough to tide you over until you hear back East or back to ""Yaad.""

Often when I call for a pick up order they are out of something on the menu. It's a Jamaican restaurant so you just deal with it. Wait times are longer. Often quoted 20 minutes even when you are dining in. Once I was quoted with 10 minutes and thought they were going above and beyond. Service is slow. Music can be inappropriate for a general audience if you know what the lyrics mean. Clean dining room but passing by the kitchen and seeing a curtain in place of a door is disturbing. But overall the place is clean and seems sanitary. 

The portions are large and I can get 3 servings from the dinner plates. This is not a positive with me as I don't like leftovers hanging around. Not very keen on the price but much better price point per meal than the other places around town. 

The parties are overpriced at $3 and not really worth it unless you are in desperate needs. Crust is doughy; filling is mostly spice and filler. 

Curry goat is well seasoned and they get the mutton tender. Alas, it's not really goat. It's mutton. But it's what most restaurants provide in the states and the texture and taste is close enough. 
The callaloo is from a tin so is the ackee. I long for the day when Americans catch on to the delish taste of Amranath leaves or Callaloo. The Ackee and salt fish is on point. I don't know where they get the yam from but it's pretty tasty. 
Rice and peas would taste better if it was made without processed coconut milk. 
The soup was overpriced for what you got and getting it served in those big cups wasn't easy to navigate cutting dumplings and such. Red Peas soup was different from what you typically see on the island but sticks to the version seen in the States. They put noodle soup mix in it. Whereas in the island, it's made from fresh coconut milk, dried red beans, some salted or corned meat and ground provision. Oxtail was good. 

I was surprised they had callaloo, tripe and beans, cow foot and ackee. But glad. I wish the service was faster but appreciate the wait if it since my food was always straight from the pot hot. I hope they fine tune the menu and have menu items available or at least limit items for certain days. 

Overall, not terrible Jamaican food for the city. It's not memorable. It is certainly better priced than others. The food is passable but I wish there were other better options.

The goat curry was basically a lot of small, chopped up pieces with bones and just as salty. All that extra salt flavor did help boost the blandness of the steamed veggies though. Heaping amount of rice too, but for what these entrees cost, I expected a higher quantity of meat to carb ratio. Check the menu prices before ordering! 1 star for the tasty fried plantains, but then you can't really mess cooking those up unless you burn them. Disappointed and sad because I'm pretty sure real Jamaican food should be better than what I tried. Next time I spend over $40 for lunch, I'll just go for French cuisine where even though the portion size is smaller, at least the quality will be worth the expense.

Unfortunately but not unexpectedly, this place fell short. We walked in and there was a lady at the counter. No smile, no greeting, no direction as to whether we were supposed to seat ourselves or order at the counter. After standing there for a few awkward moments, she finally motioned for us to take a menu off the counter and to sit where we want. Menu was pretty simple so we didn't take that long to decide what we wanted. Yet, the lady took a good 10 minutes before she came over to get our order. There were only a couple other tables that were occupied but it's not like she was serving them so a bit odd. We ordered a few Jamaican beef patties, we were a bit disappointed that we couldn't add cheese to it but I suppose we can't expect everything to be the same as New York establishments. We also ordered an ox tail lunch special and jerk chicken lunch special. 
The food didn't take too long to come out. The beef patties were good enough but not as meaty as we expected. Jerk chicken was very flavorful but could do with a longer marinating time. The ox tail was delicious and we wished it came with a bit more sauce. It also could have been cooked a tad longer. The side dishes were pretty good but then it's hard to mess up beans and rice, vegetables, and fried plantains. 
Food was ok and because of the lack of establishments here in Vegas, we wouldn't really have any other choice but to visit again when we have a craving for some Jamaican food. But honestly, the lady soured our experience quite a bit and if she had been a bit more welcoming, this would have been a 4/5.",JddUKeXfP0lhsxrEkoCBPQ,4,1,3,42okg_NQi1TFmHhW8MoQzw

I took the first bite and It felt like a warm hug to me for some reason... very comforting. I typically get Oxtail soup at a Hawaiian restaurant but sometimes I want it in a non soup form so I'm glad I found this at Paradise.,48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,6,3,5,qlJ2QP51zhbsp-3Ea9mshQ

We took a trip to Jamaica this last summer and when we got home we went on a hunt to find some of the same food we fell in love with while on vacation.
Paradise Place checked most all of the boxes!
The flavors are exactly what we remembered experiencing while on the island. 
Some absolute musts for us are the Goat Curry, Oxtails, and of course the Meat Patties! The Jerk Chicken and the Short Ribs are good too. The portions are really big and all the entrees come with rice, or rice and peas (beans) and side of veggies and plantain.

But the rice was worse. Literally inedible imo. Dry, tasteless, and a weird consistency. The legumes with it were dry and hard. Also tasteless. 

The fried bananas were ok though they came out cool. Nice caramelization on them. Ate those all. 

Otherwise I left my plate almost completely full and left. Just not good food. Too bad. I was excited at seeing a Jamaican place in our area but someone has to take pride in their cooking.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,4,4,2,_w4LptrAhdoMKTc2o1EOFg

I was told 40 mins later, nearly 7pm that they no longer had jerk chicken but they still had one platter of oxtail, which is the OPPOSITE of what I was told over the phone. One woman ordered the same two meals as I and was told the same thing over the phone, that they only have one ox tail platter left, however that was not true. So not only did I have to wait 45 minutes in the restaurant for my meal AFTER having ordered over the phone. Then, I was only given half my order. The woman at the register kept making excuses that it was Sunday so they typically run out of food at this time.

Hubby and I go to Jamaica every other year, so our expectations for authentic Jamaican food was in the, ""I hope it's at least close to what we're used to."" range. Wow, they blew us away. I had the Oxtails entree, and hubby the jerk pork . Both were amazing. All entrees arrived piping hot and the portions were huge. The food had the perfect amount of flavor and spice, plenty of gravy, and I didn't need my knife because the oxtails were like butter. We also had rum cake (yum!), and took home an order of jerk chicken for later. We're both kinda of coffee snobs, and the Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee was delicious.

Side note: I had their homemade lemonade and I haven't had better lemonade since I was a kid when I used to visit my great aunt in Birmingham, AL.

P.S. Don't know why it's listed in the three dollar sign range. They are definitely in the two dollar sign range, which is another reason for my 5 start review.",WPRYx9xqE4Kp7P1NPP-7tg,3,2,5,3AfcepqMoN4tT704gMGVWA
