Devoured it and considered ordering a second whole pizza; for 2 people. Sooooo good. Do yourself a favor and order one to go.,A5p0ZwPFbQiWeVtko75T9A,0,0,5,oTrH5vZ8AxM7aWd8IhnG3Q

We don't need no water 'cause the truck is making pizza!

Okay, so my version of Flo Rida's hit single isn't likely to make the airwaves, but you have to admit: a custom made food truck trailer with a wood burning pizza oven INSIDE OF IT is pretty freakin' bomb, right? 

Mama Napoli has good pizza- not good pizza ""for a truck"", good pizza in general, even comparing to sit-down restaurants. That wood-burning oven is key, and smells amazing. Opted for the Bella Napoli ($17), with tomato sauce, olive oil, oregano, garlic, onion, fresh mozz, and ricotta, topped with a forest of arugula. It's cheesy, crispy, and chewy, and perfect after having a few brews at Tenaya Creek- which is where they're currently stationed on Friday nights. 

Staff at the truck are friendly, orders come out fast, toppings are plentiful, and size is more than enough for sharing- 14"" serves 2 to 3, depending on appetite. Get your camera phone ready, because they do toss the dough in the viewing window area and follow them on IG to keep track of where they'll be next.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,12,9,4,qU3aDM3qTa6alUiKo_UM8Q

Mama Napoli Pizza is a food truck (more accurately, trailer) that seems to post up only outside Tenaya Creek Brewery once a week, judging from the former's Facebook posts. Last night, they'd set up shop in the reserved parking spot just outside the door, and my friends were pretty hungry for some wood-fired pizza, so I had to have a bite too.

They chose the Napoli Verde ($17), a vegetarian-friendly pizza with olive oil, garlic, mozzarella, ricotta, parmigiano reggiano, arugula, and a balsamic glaze. The ingredients were fresh and generously portioned, so of course the flavors were pretty awesome. The crust was chewy and crispy enough, although it wasn't as impressive as the best brick-and-mortar offerings. It's a 14-inch pie, so the pricing isn't all that bad for a food truck.

I would definitely consider grabbing another pie if I see Mama Napoli Pizza again, whether it's visiting Tenaya Creek with a friend or somehow finding them elsewhere. They serve some yummy stuff.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,7,4,_EG_eIx03ExvStfpS1OSSA

This place has INCREDIBLE pizza! 

We go to Tenaya Creek to drink, and this place is normally parked out front on Friday's. Party time on Friday, is what I'm getting at.

We've had a variety of pizzas. But our favorites are the New York Cheese and the Rustic pepperoni.
Oh my friggin god. The cheese is the best cheese pizza I've had in my entire life. And I've had cheese pizza all over the place. Like other states. Countries. Really, you can't beat it.
They also have a habanero sauce you can top it with for extra spicy ass the next day. Worth it? For me, yes.

Keep on making insanely delicious pizzas, guys. You're doing things really right. And I appreciate you.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,16,16,5,3YqK4FWeq2hPRFIIuDkv4w

So we went to Tenaya Creek Brewery last night to celebrate a friend's bday. We noticed that they have different food trucks on occasion but don't have a kitchen on site. We did the prep work by researching what food truck we would get to try  while we were there and saw it was Mama Napoli. 

OMG. so good. First of all, they have a wood fire oven on the truck - I just knew it would be legit. Ingredients are fresh and prices are about 11-15 for a pizza with about 8 slices? The girl that delivered the pizza to us at the bar had the biggest and warmest most sincere smile on her face. I was so excited to try it. And It was so delicious. Like beyond. The  flavors and the cheese and crust oh my god. I can honestly say this was the best pizza I have had in Vegas. My picture does not do it justice because everyone wanted to put their hands all over and grab a slice before it was gone- not realizing my Yelp photography always comes first!!

Anyway, Tenaya Creek has an awesome vibe but even better that you can order the most delicious pizza ever to accompany your beer and chill at the bar.",xrvyW1ruKS0uz9RtFewC0Q,6,4,5,iILrUuR6SOYzl50ovJpLFw
