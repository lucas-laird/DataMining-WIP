After a few minutes, War Beard approached my table and said ""the pizza is taking a little longer than expected. Would you like a complimentary drink while you wait?"" 

To be honest it wasn't that long a wait (it's never a dull moment when you have a Smartphone!) but I said ""sure, what would you recommend?"" He said ""How about a Wellness drink?"" And I said, ""go for it!"" 

Their Wellness drink is more of a juice than a smoothie and it's pretty darn good. Later I looked at the menu to see how much this complimentary drink normally costs - $7.50. That's not the cheapest drink around and yeah, lucky me, I got it comped, just because War Beard cares about his customers. 

I guess the point I want to make is that War Beard - whether he's the manager or owner - really knows the meaning of Customer Satisfaction. I don't normally write reviews on Yelp, but the service at this Eastern/215 Greens and Proteins convinced me to spend a little time writing this review.",FuArqQKuT-JkmtiiKUD8Kg,0,0,5,Q8VjDNXIL6Hsu-Snetaaiw

I had the build your own plate with basmati rice, ""marinated"" tofu, broccoli, and to my dismay, lemon vinegrette.
I began to order it with teriyaki sauce in mind, but when I inquired about the peanut sauce just to see, I was informed that the only two vegan sauces were lemon vinegrette or a balsamic reduction. Caught off guard I went for lemon, which turned out to be straight up lemon juice and olive oil. The tofu was far from marinated, and I smothered my food in hot sauce to make it a little more edible. The broccoli was just fine, but even a decent steamed vegetable doesn't have the power to save bland tofu and dry rice.

The tofu ""French fries"" were the only thing I tasted that I would even consider paying money for... But that won't happen since I won't be giving this place a second chance.

241555,2014-02-16,0,p5rpYtxS5xPQjt3MXYVEwA,"Awful experience here today.  I work in the Las Vegas service industry so I am fully aware of service standards. When I walked in at 4:30pm there was no one in line.  I knew what I wanted to order so I went straight to the register to place my order (1 Apple Pie Smoothie).  The two female employees prepping ingredients continued to chit chat with themselves, not acknowledging my presence for a full minute of standing at the register.  Finally one came over and took my order, my name, and payment.  The other employee started working on my smoothie.  I watched her pour in almond milk and then dump at least a CUP of nutmeg in my smoothie and gasp 'Oh my God' to the other employee.  (A little sprinkle of nutmeg goes a long way).  The two of them decided it best her her to  scoop the nutmeg out with her gloved hands.  Unsuccessfully, she decided to start my smoothie over (thankfully, as I watched her like a hawk, regretting having just paid $8 for a smoothie).  Meanwhile the other employee helped the two customers behind me as I watched employee 1 take her sweet a$$ time re-making my smoothie.  The other employee managed to make FOUR other smoothies (for customers behind me) in the time it took employee 1 to make one smoothie.  This all took about approx 10 minutes.  Then, employee 1 tried to give my smoothie away to another customer behind me.  I finally walked up and said, ""that's for (my name), right?"" ""Oh oops, here you go!"" was her response to me.  No 'sorry about the 10 minute wait'.  Sorry Greens & Proteins, no matter how hungry I am and how hard it is to get a healthy snack when I'm all the way across town, I will faithfully use my own Blendtec at home and make better, cheaper smoothies.

Lettuce (romaine I think) was very tough and hard, simply wrapped around a bunch of tofu (looked like the tofu fries before being breaded and cooked).  Not wrapped at all so all the filling fell out as soon as I picked it up.  The tofu was supposed to be marianated, but it certainly wasn't.   When I marinate tofu in teriyaki sauce, it absorbs the marinade and turns brown.  G&P's tofu was still white and flavorless.  Supposed to include cukes and something else.  Nothing but a lettuce leaf, flavorless tofu and sauce (which dripped all over the plate).   When I went back to the counter to talk to the manager, I was told they weren't in!

This is my first time here even though I often go next door and hit up Starbucks.  The menu is rather large and it will take you minute to read everything over.  They are gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, and low-carb friendly place that offers a nice selection of soups, salads, burgers, 9"" pizzas, smoothies, sandwiches/wraps and a choice to even create your own meal.  After pondering what to eat I decided on a burger.  What is more classic than a burger and if they could make it right then I would be encouraged to try more off the menu. 

I ordered the buffalo burger done to a medium (they also have ostrich which I have never had) and tofu fries.  There is also an option for the jicama fries.  I was told the jicama fries are fry-shaped pieces of jicama tossed in a dressing.  I shied away from the jicama because I have not had it before personally but I did hear they are good.  The tofu fries are firm tofu tossed in rice flow and fried.  They are delicious!  The burger can come on a wheat or gluten-free bun or as a wrap. I chose the wheat bun and got Swiss cheese on my burger.  The burger itself is massive stacked with a thick patty, lettuce, tomato and onion!  I can barely fit it in my mouth!  The bread to meat ratio for the burger is perfect.  I took a bite and the burger is done exactly right (medium), juicy and tender.  

For my buffalo burger, tofu fries, pickle and a soda cost me a little over $14 including tax.  A good price for a nice buffalo burger.  Also their soda machine dispenses small ice pellets.  This is an important point to make for my fellow ice munchers! 

The place is WiFi ready but you will have to ask for the passkey to access the network. When I asked the staff about power access they did not know but I was able to speak to Jeff, one of the owners, and he was able to show me where to plug in.  For those needing a place to work there are a TON of plugs (long power strips) under the bench along the back wall of the restaurant. Just a little looking and you will see them.       

If you are looking for a nice place to grab a healthy bite to eat (even with your GF, Vegan or Uber-health conscious friends)  then look no further than the Greens and Proteins!",fVK62lNSxqP6QtZPm6SreA,2,0,5,xb5a3UN7LV1yOIm4dujfwg

I don't know who decided to call this thing a salad but it's definitely not what most people would consider to be a salad. The lump of canned tuna and lettuce bed was horribly tasteless and the lettuce was wilted and soggy. It makes me so sad that I didn't find what I was so hopeful to find in greens and protein.

I guess if you stick a healthy label on a restaurant you would always expect to pay high prices. 

What I do like are the juices and smoothies as their made from real fresh ingredients. The last time we were here we ordered the ""Green Shake""; ""Green Ginger Limeade"" and the ""Albacore Tuna Salad""

The ""Green Shake"" comes with Banana, almonds, mango, orange, apple, avocado, spinach, collard greens, kale, vanilla, agave nectar. Sounds like they put the kitchen sink in this shake but you can taste hints of every ingredient. You get a dose of fruits and vegetables and an added extra protein burst with the almonds. You can substitute this for a meal as it's very filling. 

The ""Green Ginger Limeade"" comes with Green grapes, spinach, ginger, lime, agave nectar. Its a very refreshing drink and its not filled with a bunch of sugars. One of the things I love about this drink is the ginger. It does not overpower the drink as it adds a unique sweetness. 

The ""Albacore Tuna Salad"" comes with Tomatoes, celery, cucumbers and bibb lettuce, Dijon dressing. Now this was such a big disappointment. My thoughts ordering this was I was going to get seared tuna on top of greens but to my surprise it was canned tuna and the large size was priced at 9.99. I felt like I just got ripped off. The dressing was also a little too strong with the Dijon but at least it killed the taste of the canned tuna. 

I would definitely come back for the Juices and Smoothies but would hesitate to order another salad. There are other selections available on the menu like pizzas and burgers that I might try next time.",2wyP8DL1isAG-6ApKbvDSw,0,0,3,T1Dv4Wq4DaNlaiVa8Q1LUQ

As we waited we noticed the manager or owner take a person out of line and personally take and expedite her order. At first, I thought he was trying to speed service. The woman in front of us commented, ""if I were in tight spandex maybe I'd skip to the front of the line too."" Sure enough, the helpful employee did not take anyone else out of line to take their order and stayed chatting with the young woman until her smoothie came.

Meanwhile, my associate noted prices were higher than she really wanted to pay for a smoothie or lunch. Since we were already waiting and the lunch hour was winding away, I reminded her I was treating.

Adventurous, I ordered the ostrich burger with tofu fries. My companion ordered a smoothie and a make your own meal with salmon and rice. By the time we paid, the helpful manager had long since seen his prey leave with her smoothie and was sitting alone at her table on his phone texting or maybe yelping. 

We waited to take our food to go. As we waited, we both cringed hearing the cook at the grill sneezing. This is incidental as I'm sure he was sanitary about the sneeze, but it's still not something you want to hear as your food's being prepared, and it bolstered a so far unsatisfactory experience.

We eventually received our order and rushed back to our office to eat.

My coworker's first comment in the car? ""This smoothie is terrible. I can get a better one a Whole Foods for half the price."" 

We waited till the office to start in on the rest. My ostrich burger wasn't bad. This was my second ostrich burger ever and it ranked top two. The tofu fries were actually pretty tasty. 

Unfortunately, my coworker's meal wasn't as tasty. Already unhappy with the smoothie she asked me to taste her rice. The rice was still uncooked. The fish on the other hand was overcooked. For the rest of the day all I heard her say was, ""that smoothie was not worth nine dollars"" and ""how hard is it to cook rice?""",BYnnHEwIPRMnjpNVH7fEPA,1,0,1,M4-BPyMvofOy3yX25RQ0TA

We believe in moderation in all things. A little self control is required!  I promise, you will eat again so keep the splurging to a meal or two a week. Luckily in Vegas there are lots of healthy places to stop and eat and not feel guilty. I mean I can think of 4 or 5 just on Eastern!  Greens and Proteins can fill your stomach with some high quality fuel and make your taste buds jump for joy all while making sure you look good for the pool party season. 

The salads are awesome and you can add really good salmon for a protein boost. The lettuce wraps are always a light healthy meal. Their juices are good but for me I ask them to leave some of the fruit out as I don't want as much sugar.  The staff is helpful and efficient.  You can get in and out quickly for breakfast, lunch or dinner or you can also choose to sit and enjoy a great meal and conversation. I love sitting outside and feeling the wonderful Vegas warmth in the evenings. Enjoy a glass of the complimentary cucumber water that is ice cold and plentiful. 

We all love to eat but we all also want to be healthy and look great. We all like convenience and most of us don't have time or desires to cook three meals a day.  This place can help you live the life you want while eating healthy and enjoying your food. 

Eat to live, but live to experience life.

1057525,2013-07-26,1,p5rpYtxS5xPQjt3MXYVEwA,"I selected Greens and Proteins (G&P) because I wanted a tasty, wholesome breakfast with no animal protein.  In short, I was not impressed with this establishment and its offerings. It seems to me that they are offering a watered down version of ""healthy"" food.

EXPERIENCE: I struggled with their juice menu first. I juice and drink fresh juices from other establishments on a regular basis so I felt comfortable picking out a quick juice to start my meal. Unfortunately, agave nectar and honey were featured in all but one drink.   I can get added sugar anywhere in town, I was surprised that a place that calls itself a ""healthy kitchen and juice bar"" offered no pure juices. And that what they were presenting as juice was laden with a sweetener more processed than high fructose syrup (agave). 

Needless to say, I chose the V9 juice since it offered some vegetable and contained no added sugar.  I asked for more greens (spinach and kale) in the juice with regular tomatoes rather than the sun dried tomatoes usually in the drink. The addition of vegetable stock to the juice was confusing for me. I saw them add a processed vegetable broth, not a stock, but that didn't bother me too much. I have never seen a juice offering with vegetable ""stock"", but I was willing to try it.  The ""juice"" was more of a blended concoction.  It was cold and thickish.  Especially as I got the end. What is was not, was tasty.  There was no bite from the lime or garlic and the ""stock"" watered down the taste of the vegetables. The texture and flavor were off putting, but I'd spent the $6.99 for 24 oz. (8oz of that are the vegetable broth) so I drank it. Most of it.

My mother ordered the Greek scramble with a side of the homemade turkey bacon. I ordered the ""Real Deal Oatmeal"" with some of the additions (raisins, bananas, and ""sucant"", which is sugar) on the side. The menu lists ""sucant"" as an ingredient in the oatmeal, but I believe G & P has misspelled the word Sucanat on their menu. Sucanat is a whole, unrefined cane sugar made by ""crushing sugar cane, extracting the juice, heating it, and dehydrating it into granules."" It's still sugar, but many people consider it a healthier option because it contains less sucrose and ""retains the natural molasses and trace nutrients like iron, calcium, potassium, and B vitamins.""

I've ordered oatmeal at dozens of establishments in this town--most not presenting the image of a health conscious establishment---and I've never heard what I heard from G&P.  After ordering, the cashier had to come over and find me to tell me that they could not put the sugar (Sucanat) on the side.  ""Why"" I asked. She explained that the sugar is mixed in with the oatmeal. What??? I clarified in case I had misheard her.  I asked incredulously, ""The sugar is already mixed in with the oatmeal? So I can't get oatmeal without sugar?"" Correct.  She informed me that they pre-mix the sugar in the oatmeal.  To put this issue in context, a person can order rolled oats oatmeal at McDonald's without sugar.  How do they know how much sugar (Sucanat) I want in my oatmeal?   I imagine they err on the side of ""a lot."" 

All of the other breakfast options included animal protein or sugar except for the Berry Parfait. I ordered it without the strawberry yogurt since I assumed that it had more sugar than I would like. I asked for plain yogurt in the parfait. The chef happened to be out on the floor and the cashier (misunderstanding my request?) asked the chef what was in the strawberry yogurt. He stated that it was plain yogurt with strawberries and sweeteners added.  I don't eat pre-sweetened yogurt and figured the strawberries and sweetened granola would add enough sugar to the meal. He said they had plain yogurt in the back and that they could accommodate me. 

The parfait was fine--lots of large strawberries and sweet crunchy granola.  I tasted one of Mom's tofu fries and it was crunchy and well seasoned. She enjoyed her egg white scramble and turkey sausage side.

I understand everyone visiting G & P will not share my expectations. If people are looking for a place with some vegetables and some healthier options, this place is solid.  I love that they have a raw section on their menu. I also appreciate the lean meats on their menu that are not easy to find elsewhere: bison and ostrich. 

SERVICE: Great service. They did a fantastic job of accommodating me.

SUMMARY: Greens and Proteins seems a decent option for those on a plant-based diet looking for restaurant options, those seeking non-certified gluten free options,  or those looking for more generally healthy food options. 

It was not a good place for me. When I patronize a ""healthy"" establishment, I am seeking whole foods, less refined sugars and grains, great taste, few if any processed foods, and greater raw (and cooked) vegetable options. I do not think I will return to Greens and Proteins.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,6,1,3,lIBAFT298TcqHNZVzFDVuA

Greens and Proteins is just waiting to explode into locations all over the place.  It is as marketable as a snow day when you're ten, and healthier than a visit to the gym (with less no-neck tools grunting too)

The interior is serene and beautiful, with waterfalls on the walls, grass-green accents around the room, and a few big screens; Greens and Proteins is a smoothie made of Whitman's Leaves of Grass poetry, modern chic, and conscious eating.  

Trying to stay on your diet plan for that summer body?  The items on the menu have their calorie count posted, so you can tell just how many miles it would take to burn off lunch.  If you don't care about that sort of thing, the food is still quite delicious.

I enjoyed the teriyaki chicken wrap w/ jicama ""fries,""  and a smoothie that had pretty much everything in the garden in it.  I can't recall the name, but it was green and wonderful.  


I live pretty far from here, but luckily the nice woman at the register told me that a new location could be opening in Summerlin sometime soon.

Maybe we have high standards because we are from California where we know what good, clean Vegan food actually is. When we walked in the manager/server (?) jumped up and said ""Hello, Welcome"", then went back to leaning over the front counter with his phone in his face. Everything seemed okay while ordering at the counter. The realization that I was in a gross place started when I went to pour water. Tap water from the Coke machine. What ""health"" oriented  business has anything to do with the Coca-Cola company (FYI: corrupt evil corporation). Any truly healthful food restaurant knows what clean/pure water is. Not this place.

When my Veggie Burger arrived the GF bun was SO DRY and starchy it was like eating stale duck feed. And it's not just my bun, my husband had a standard wheat bun with his veggie burger. I went to the sidebar to check out the condiments like ketchup and mustard: SYSCO. If the basic condiments are SYSCO with high fructose corn syrup, just imagine the rest of the ingredients in the kitchen, and their source. Some of the reviews here say ""I'm glad they use high-quality ingredients"", that is not possible if their main supplier is SYSCO. We asked for another ketchup or condiment option that did not have High Fructose Corn Syrup from the server/mangaer. He said that was all they had. Lame.
The Veggie patty was bland beans. The Tofu ""fries"" were so fried there was no tofu left in the middle, shriveled and soaking in oil. Gross.
The Thai ginger soup I got was like a think gloppy pudding. I tried putting it on my burger like a condiment to make it more edible. Didn't help.

Now, I would say not to come here if you are ravenous because the portions are just right to be filling, but definitely aren't huge. The menu is a mixture of smoothies, juices, burgers, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and custom plates. I got a custom plate with tofu, asparagus, spaghetti squash, and peanut sauce.

This is one of the worst customer service experiences I have EVER encountered before. 

I called Greens and Proteins about a month ago, to see if they could take a reservation for a large party of about 15-20 people. My team was planning an outing in the area, so I thought it would be a great idea for a healthy lunch. The girl I spoke with checked with her manager, who said it wouldn't be a problem, and to call back closer to the date.

A fellow team mate of mine called and spoke with the manager a few days in advance, who confirmed the date, time, and number of people. 

I called the morning of the event, and spoke with Elizabeth. She was totally unprofessional in both her tone and handling of the situation. She put me on hold to check with a manager, and came back to tell me there would be no guarantee that they could accommodate us. The time we would be visiting was a busy time, and she stated that they could not promise to reserve tables for us. So I asked if we could be seated at separate tables, to which she repeated her original statement: she could not promise us that we could be accommodated. This was extremely frustrating, as we were told in advance that we could make reservations, and it would NOT be an issue, and now I had a team of 18 people with out a place to eat.

My fellow team mate that originally made the reservations called, and spoke with a different girl this time - and she had no record of the reservation made under her name, days before. The girl assured us that she would have the manager call us back, but we never received a phone call. This resulted in us having to find a different place to go to, an hour before our event was supposed to occur. 

Why would management originally say YES, you can take a reservation for a large party, only to go back on your word, and put myself and my team in a difficult situation. We were told that our reservations were set, and when the day came, no one had any idea of what we were talking about. WHY would you make promises that you cannot keep? That is a huge customer service no-no.

As for Elizabeth, she was had NO empathy, did not offer ANY solutions for me, and was so unprofessional. Customer service is the most important aspect of a business. For this reason alone, I will not be back again.",pCpWHjAiEf6ptK_W6Qb2jw,0,0,1,VpqhaCeYbiH55KOeMSM97w

That being said, I really wanted to love Greens and Proteins, but after ordering from them twice I'm feeling pretty lukewarm about them. Heres why.

The roasted vegetable wrap: Ok, good assortment of veggies in here but VERY VERY greasy. So greasy that it was inedible the next day. Even though it has some pesto in there it REALLY lacks flavor. I think they need to pair it with some kind of creamy dipping sauce, put some seasoning on those veggies, and for the love of god: tone down the oil! Then it would be perfect.

Hummus platter: Very unimpressive and tastes unusual? The hummus was very gritty and dry and has a flavor unlike any hummus I've had before (and I've had a lot of hummus!). A decent hummus is extremely easy to make so I'm really not sure what happened here *shrug*

Fries: Their options are tofu fries, jicama fries, and sweet potato fries for extra $. I'm sorry, but the only sensible option here seems to be the sweet potato fries. I could be wrong but the other two options just sounded bizarre. So I ordered the sweet potato fries twice. The first time I just tossed them out because they were so bland and under cooked. However, the second time somebody in the kitchen wisened up and crisped those guys up and added a bit of salt. Ate the whole thing! Yum.

Ahi Tuna Salad: I got without the hard boiled egg. Probably the best thing I ordered. Pretty straightforward. Kudos.

Wellness Juice: Excellent. I love the large size, flavor, and it was definitely fresh!

So yeah, being that I have a lot of dietary restrictions I was pretty much limited to only a few items + plus the juices/smoothies. Which is fine, as long as they are delicious and prepared correctly. Clearly there need to be some improvements!

The place is located in a very high traffic plaza and it can get pretty packed during lunch. Inside of the restaurant is very well done. The interior has a very sleek, modern and clean look. The menu is fairly simple, and the calories are added next to each item on the menu (major bonus). The staff was fairly friendly albeit a bit rushed even though it was not very busy on that particular day. 

I opted for the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken wrap with a side of Jicama fries. Everything was very delicious.  The less calories conscious boyfriend opted for Turkey BLT wrap with tofu fries. The wrap was just ok. It needed some sort of a light sauce or marinade  to infuse the exceedingly dry turkey. This would be a forgivable,  if this wrap was not $10.99. He ended up finishing my wrap of which he was a huge fan. I absolutely LOVED the tofu fries. SO good!

I ordered the bison wrap and tortilla soup. The wrap was amazing. Not sure if the soup was even what I ordered. Just seemed like a cream of something, no chunks of anything in it. The taste was fine, but I don't think it was what I ordered. The complimentary ""cucumber lemon"" water was way too cucumber-y and there was absolutely zero lemon in it. False advertising. If the soup was right and the water was more to what I expected this would have made five stars. I will go back again to try other wraps and their burgers.

Perfect for breakfast, lunch or and early dinner. The juices and smoothies are fantastic as well. Made from scratch right in front of you from whole fruits and veggies.

Veggie Flatbread: Really tasty. They use unconventional veggies that normal wouldn't be on a veggie pizza. Artichoke hearts, Greek and black olives, spinach, orange bell peppers and classic red onions.  

Buffalo Chicken Flatbread: Right up my man's alley. Although there isn't a ton of buffalo sauce flavor, it's more of a BBQ chicken pizza, it's still scrumptious. Make sure you ask for ranch. It's a Greek yogurt ranch but it's so good. And guilt-free. 

Ginger Limeade Juice: I get this every time I go there. It's so light and refreshing. And a green drink so who can complain?

However today I went to dine in since I had extra time on my hands. I get there around 1:00-1:30 pm and it seems as they just cooled down from lunch hour. Anyways so I order a chicken teriyaki sandwich with cheese and grilled onions added. I usually pay around 13$ for this. This time they charged me almost 15$ I was shocked but I rolled with it and requested the receipt. Later when I looked at the receipt I saw they charged me $2.00 for some grilled onions rather than the usually $0.50. So I'm sure it was a mistake so I take it up to the cashier and she fixes the issue for me and refunds me the difference. So here I am now waiting on my food for almost twenty minutes which also wasn't a big deal because I wasn't in a rush. However once I receive my food it's just disappointment. I got a cold chicken sandwich with no cheese and no grilled onions. (What I paid extra for) and to top it off my sweet potato fries were cold and barely edible.

The layout is not bad and it has a clean feel. They have a good selection on the menu. Customer service was not bad but not that great either. The girl at the counter wasn't too friendly but wasn't rude either. 

I decided to have the breakfast burrito and my girlfriend ordered the Acai bowl. 

The burrito was pretty good. Not too big but enough to be filling. I was not a fan of the  tofu potatoes that came on the side. But that's not a deal breaker.

Here is the part that knocks off a couple stars. The acai bowl was almost completely frozen still. It had possibly the worst texture and consistency I've seen in an acai bowl. It was topped with granola and fruit which is nice but no honey or agave which left a lot of flavor to be desired. If I'm going to pay 8$ for a bowl, at least make sure to take the time to finish blending the acai instead of sending the bowl out half frozen. 

So this place isn't terrible but could use some friendlier customer service, and I recommend shying away from the acai bowl.",yTYtV1d_rkSS2wcPY-LXdw,1,0,3,rczhfp8SmNpt1oTWjgruEw

The Tofu Fries were a fun and tasty alternative to french fried potatoes. Again, really generous portion. Every juice and smoothie I've had has been really good - I would suggest asking the juice-maker on staff which one she/he recommends based on your likes and dislikes. They will suggest one and dial it in for you. 

The food may be a dollar or two more than a comparable cafe-style restaurant, but you truly get it back in terms of portion size and quality. It takes one visit to realize this.

And, the staff actually looks healthy here. That says a lot!

Wish I lived closer. Will definitely eat here next time I'm at Eastern/215 for the Cars & Coffee car meetup on Saturdays.

FYI, there seem to be 'green' health cafe imitators popping up around the Valley. Try Greens and Proteins first - this place is the real deal. Greens and Proteins reminds me of R Thomas in Atlanta (a 24hr health food cafe) and that is a compliment.

I ordered a small caesar salad. It was huge. I couldn't finish it. It was standard taste. Also had a green ginger limeade. It was a whopping $5.99. It was dense, flavorful, refreshing and pleasant.

Sadly, when we got there, I learned they didn't have ostrich on the menu anymore (I was looking at an old menu on yelp), and their bison is no grass-finished so I mixed that option and went for my staple, salmon. As for sides, I got asparagus, sweet potatoes and added on avocado! 

Our food arrived maybe 12 minutes later, and looks amazing.... Granted I thought my Salmon portion looked a little small (but I didn't say anything). My brother and his fiancé got bison burgers and my husband got the Cali Chicken Wrap. No one had any problems with their Food. I was initially a bit concerned for my husband because he pretty much hates everything he eats unless it's chick fil a but he did not complain at all and ACTUALLY ADMITTED to the wrap being good! He also got a peanut butter shake (that he was initially very skeptical of because when it arrived to him it looked slightly green), and sucked that baby dry!

They offer fresh juices and smoothies with everything from kale, to watermelon, pineapple and wheat grass. They also have elk and ostrich burgers and bison cheesesteaks.

There are breakfast lunch and dinner options available, and they come with sides like jicama or tofu fries. This place has made eating healthy so much easier.

I have only been here a handful of times, but this by far is my favorite health food hangout now and will be checking in many times. You will see many campers with computers because it offers free wi/fi. I might start bring my laptop. 

What I love about this place; I can build my own meal for 10 bucks. I order either chicken breast or the Filet. The chicken breast is so juicy and seasoned nicely for about 8 bucks. Filet is cooked to order and is amazingly good for 15 bucks. Now each build your own meal comes with a generous portion of a veggie and a gain. I do the broccoli and brown rice. No sauce for me. But sauce is available.

Don't let me review fool you into thinking it is just builder your own meal. They have one of the best tasting health pizzas in town (i order the gluten free crust).  Honestly if someone can show me better I am up for the challenge.  

And of course the have the traditional health juices and wraps.

Can't believe how fluffy they were in consideration), Southwest Tofu & Chorizo Burrito, Real Deal Oatmeal (this was really nice too!), and lastly, but not least, the Margherita Pizza (this tasted really good, got the thin crust, tasted really fresh). 

I would just like to say that we did not have this all at one time. This was with three people on multiple trips!

I ordered take out for lunch for my husband and I. I asked the girl at the register what she recommended and/or the most popular dish, she didn't have much to say except asking me what I was hungry for..  I wanted to know what there top seller was, no answer. At that point another woman interjected and took over my order. 

For my husband, I ordered the Turkey Club as a wrap. For myself, I ordered the Grilled Vegetable wrap. I mentioned I eat a lot of grilled vegetable sandwiches, which she replied but you haven't had ours .... I did have it today, and will not be ordering it again. The wrap was soggy.. not much flavor to the vegetables that were not crunchy but overcooked. The beans were tasty along with the cilantro pesto, however there was only a dab or two put on it. 

For the sides, with a choice between tofu fries or jicama, I went with something different, tofu fries... different indeed.. I love tofu, but these were shaped like fish sticks and had the seasoning and taste of fish sticks you had as a child (not pleasant)
Next time, I'll go for the jicama. The woman that took my order, did say the sauce that you dip them in is good, and yes it was... I ended up putting it on my bland grilled veg. wrap. 

I also ordered the Thai Ginger soup, which I was told was made from scratch. 
It was flavorful, but could have used some salt to bring out the flavor more.. A little thick for a hot afternoon. 

I tasted my husbands Turkey Club and it was tasty. Maybe I'll order that the next time. 

The service was nice and friendly.. I will go back and give it another try...

I like that both locations are located in the same plaza as the gym I belong to, it's convinient to grab a bite to eat afterwards. So why not 5 stars? Here's my beef with G&P:

1. The listed calories next to the item doesn't count the entire entree, i.e;
      *Turkey Burger w/ alfafla, L,T,O and low fat cheese (served on a bun and tofu fries) that is everything included in the entree, so my thought would be the calorie count should include everything, right? Nope, it doesn't include the bun or the tofu fries or the cheese. 

2. Food should be organic for the price. Especially the vegetables/fruits going into the juices & smoothies. Average price is $7.50.

3. Employees should be more knowledgable about their product. When I asked two employees about the calorie count, both gave me a different answer. Also, when I had lunch with my vegan friend, she asked if the sauce that came with the tofu fries was vegan, the girl had no idea, she had to go in the back to ask. Turns out, it's not.

Its sweet, so you don't get the overpowering vegetable taste. Just remember to keep stirring it so you don't get a thick sludge at the end. It's an awesome meal replacement or a post workout drink. 

Their food is just as healthy as their drinks. Nothing is processed and everything is made to order. I like their tofu fries (light on the seasoning) and their margherita pizza as well. They have burgers and wraps, with the options of whole wheat buns or spinach tortillas as substitutions. They also offer unique items like bison or ostrich patties for your burgers.

They have a sort of build your own meal. You pick a protein, grain, veggie and a sauce. That was probably my favorite meal here.
I also have tried the Gluten free pizza and it was pretty tasty.

The bad-
I ordered a burger with a gluten free bun. The gluten free bun was stale and hard.  I was really disappointed.
I know people seem to love the tofu fried but I did not like them. They were just rubbery and tasteless.


The service for me has always been pretty good. Once, they messed up me and my husband's order and they were quick to make it right, giving us an extra order of tofu fries. Though once my husband went in to pick up our order and a kid at the front desk called him ""boss"" which really annoyed him. He found it a bit condescending.

It's a lentil black bean, brown rice, mushroom, celery, carrot, onion, cilantro, basil, garlic and cashew patty that's 10.99. It makes me forget about bacon. Although I'm not a fan of lentils, it's not ""lentily""--we'll pretend that's a word. I ordered it with their tofu fries. The bun was flaky, fresh & soft, the burger was very flavorful & moist (ew I hate the word moist lol) and the fries were different but cool! 

I love that they offer so many options for specialty diets. It makes it easier to order out for my kiddo. He got the Angus Burger on their gluten free bun with dairy free cheese. He loved it.

I'll try more things, maybe some wraps will rock my world, but the bland and soy-ness of the veggie patty was enough to discourage me for a while.",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,4,2,3,Wf7NrNUdaxJIn_tqWLL2tQ

Great smoothies and a solid option for that mid-afternoon snack attack. 

I've only ever had the smoothies and let me tell ya... they're tasty. I usually get one after the gym or when I'm fighting back that burrito craving. Greens and Proteins offers multiple smoothies options: Green Shake, Chocolate Peanut Butter and Banana shake and something called the Apple Pie... the list goes on, but you get it, right? 

I'VE TRIED BOTH:  The Green Shake & its Chocolate mutant counterpart. 

The Green Shake is delicious. Filled with banana, almonds, mango, orange, apple, avocado, spinach, collard greens, kale, vanilla, agave nectar. This beast will definitely curb hunger cravings, but won't leave you feeling overstuffed and gross. Great smoothie for the Green and Protein curious but isn't sure about all this weird healthy food business. Not only is this drink tasty, but the super silky texture is a great way to smooth out a rough day. Ha! 

The Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Shake is for the person who needs to be tricked into eating ""healthy"". This drink, with over 700 calories, comes fully equipped with cacao powder, dark chocolate chips, banana, roasted peanut, avocado, kale, spinach, zucchini, flax seed, chia seeds, honey, vanilla, agave nectar. This is definitely a meal substitute and should be treated as such. This one is actually my favorite (duh) because I drink this instead of eating a heavy lunch, but it also does what it's supposed to do, fill you up. 

I'm a big dude, so if these smoothies can tide me over until my next feeding, than I'm sure the twiggy masses will be set for days. Keep it smoothie!",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,14,11,4,HXgUDARuOQYkuMuQs_NLxQ
2975648,2014-06-22,1,p5rpYtxS5xPQjt3MXYVEwA,"Pricey healthy food. But good! I love their smoothies/juices, lots of different options. My favorites are the Wellness drink, Green Leaf Berry Blast and Apple Pie Smoothie. They list all of the ingredients and calories on the menu so that's great.
As for food, they offer a great variety as well. Soups, salads, BURGERS, PIZZA lol, raw and smaller items. I must say, for being super healthy, the tofu fries are actually pretty good. I also like their Bison Burger and BBQ Chicken Pizza. Where else can you eat a whole pizza for around 350 calories?? Score!
If you're an avid greens & proteins person, they have an app where you can place orders. It's pretty busy most of the time so that's helpful. Workers are friendly and there's a bit more wait time so give them an extra 5 minutes.
I was thinking to give them 3 stars because it's a little pricey and because nothing is like omg melt in your mouth i'm craving for it good but then I had to smack myself and remind myself what type of business they are. Let's get real, it's not meant to taste like cheesecake factory with 1500 calories per dish lol for the type of food they offer, they do amazing.

My favorite meal to order here is the bison cheesesteak.  The Bison is wrapped in a spinach wrap with melted cheese, peppers, and some type of chipotle sauce mixed in. 

The bison burger is also delicious.  It is much leaner than beef burgers so it's not as juicy, but they do well at making it very flavorful.",K46q0_b75J_-oJ-wHZ13lQ,3,1,5,N-KnA0Xltr1PPHgtOVZP5A

The staff was obviously very happy and interested in their food, our satisfaction, etc. It didn't feel forced, they actually seemed happy to be there and like they cared what we thought. And this might sound lame, but we didn't order drinks, and they proactively offered water cups to us, and then we saw that the water was nor just a fountain-style plain water but rather a cucumber/lemon water concoction that tasted great.

The only reason this is a 4 instead of a 5 is that it IS a bit pricey. Our two meals, without drinks, came to $20. And the second time I went I got a medium-ish sized smoothie for more than $8. But I feel like that's worth it for what we got: indisputably fresh, healthy meals.

Low-carb Heads- Yes, I'm one. For us, they can make any sandwich into a wrap. 

For everyone and their moms- They have a design your own meal option.

The combination choices are endless!

Decided to stop by after hitting the gym and was not disappointed at the quality of the wood. G&P puts a healthy spin on a lot of popular dishes: burgers (available in beef, ostrich, turkey or veggie), pizzas, sandwiches, salads and a huge assortment of smoothies and health drinks. The food is delicious, the BBQ chicken or Greek pizzas are a sizable portion yet unbelievably low in calories. G&P is one of the few places nearby to get fresh squeezed juices, and their parfaits are awesome.

The downside is that Greens is a bit overpriced. During my last trip I opted to get a chicken Teriyaki wrap and at $11 I thought it was very overpriced.

Herbivore Review
Herby ordered a build-your-own plate with marinated tofu, quinoa and edamame. As a vegan, Herby asked about vegan sauces, the employee at the register didn't seem super confident but perfectly friendly. Tofu was a bit mushy and had no marinated flavor. Quinoa was really watery like it hadn't been properly strained. Edamame was good. The portion size looked small on the plate, but was actually filling. Cost was $10, wouldn't order again.

Carnivore Review
Carno ordered the bison cheesesteak in a cabbage wrap with tofu fries with water cup. The meat was really tasty and well flavored. Everything was really fresh and clean-tasting. At a lot of restaurants like this, there are issues with portion size, but this place has great portion size (3 handfuls worth of food) and macro cost. Definitely recommend a fork since it will fall apart as you eat (like all leaf wraps do). Cost was $11-12, would order again.

Overall
Food was ready in less than 10 minutes and total cost was about $25 with tax. The number of vegan options is above 5, so high enough for Herby to return. Carno enjoyed the food, it's definitely a good place to go if you want to feel full without killing your ratios for the day.",-k5a57oo1xeA1ynCU4l7YA,1,0,3,Kxh0ezr-4VZyLUMOzw-rlw

The quality of the ingredients really speaks for itself and the healthiness, which may be a major selling point for some, was really just a bonus for me. 

I opted to try the bison cheese steak on a wheat bun, which seems to be a popular option. It came with a side of ""fries"" and I chose the Jica, having never heard of them before. The girl at the register was friendly and willing to explain the various menu items. Much of the menu is vegan or vegetarian but not all of it-- it offers plenty of options for the carnivores so don't let that deter you from visiting.

The food was pretty impressive. The bun was hearty and filling, and the the actual bison meat was just as tasty as any beef I've ever had in a philly cheese steak. The sandwich itself is filling enough but does come with the fries. I probably will try the tofu fries next time because the jica ""fries"" were really just raw sliced vegetables that provided the optical illusion of fries but tasted nothing like them.

The above concept is really all that was exciting for me at Greens and Protein. Unfortunately, the food was rather bland. 

I ordered the plate with tofu (protein), asparagus (green) and quinoa. The quinoa tasted literally like quinoa. No seasoning, nothing. Likewise, the asparagus failed to incite even a slight quiver in my taste buds. The tofu was passable - but I'll eat tofu made any way. 

My husband ordered the raw mock chicken lettuce cups. I actually found this dish offensive and puny in serving size. But my husband liked it. 

One of my friends ordered the bison burger which he relished and the other one, a similar plate like mine but with a grilled portobello mushroom instead of quinoa. The mushroom was actually very good. 

We shared the tofu fries - quite good but I really wish they weren't fried. What's the point of a healthy meal?

Very hipster scenery with people grabbing smoothies/coffee while sitting and doing work, having a meeting, etc. People bring their dogs and just relax outside for hours.

My friend and I shared a meal. The lady taking our order seemed the least interested in her job. I was shocked on how someone in just a bland mood could work at such an inspiring lifestyle restaurant. I even asked her for an extra cup, so I could split our smoothie, and gave off an attitude I was asking too much. But her mood was not going to put a damper on my experience. She handed us our # and we proceeded to sit outside to enjoy the day.

My friend and I got a wellness smoothie which was very green but a hint of sweet. This was perfect because I hate sweet. You could taste all the fresh veggies in it.  We also got the veggie burger with the fried tofu fries. The veggie burger was on a wheat bun with onions, tomato, and lettuce (not gross iceberg lettuce). You can do cheddar or swiss cheese or make it vegan and get no cheese. If you got here, YOU MUST try the tofu fries. They are like a steak fry thickness, deep fried with a cajun seasoning. They bring a spicy mayo our but I prefer ketchup.

We sat outside enjoying the beautiful natural sunlight and cool breeze. Our waiter was very polite and brought out food out. He was quick to clean up when we were done.

The customer service gal didn't do anything to help. She said she would call the restaurant. ""What are they going to do?!"" I asked. ""The food has been ready for an hour-they fulfilled their part of the order process.""

The portions are generous, so I don't leave hungry.

When I'm not on a strict diet, I divulge in other menu items, the whole menu is delicious to me!

I ordered the veggie sandwich as I looooooooooove grilled veggies. It came with a pickle and I ordered the tofu fries as it's side. I like tofu but, after trying it this way and with a spicy aiole, I LOVE TOFU FRIES!

My roomie had the Greek pizza. I love feta but, the kalamata olives were toooo over powering. My roomie had to take them outta his pizza; and he loves olives.

Checking into Yelp gave me a 50 cent off voucher on their shakes or juices so, we decided to get one. I forget which one but, it was delicious. Peanut buttery but, not toooo thick. More like an icee texture.

Greens and Proteins uses the real estate that LVAC fills with frozen yogurt and replaces it with fresh kale, grapes, almond milk, avocado, chia seeds, flax seed, agave nectar and collard greens. Can you imagine what these ingredients do for your bowels, Yelpers? They do magic. That's what they do. Magic.

The cucumber and lemon infused water washes away any bad feelings I could have had about the price. Other salves related to pricing: $1 check in offer on Yelp; buy 10 smoothies, get one free; the opportunity to earn the Carrot Top badge.

The flavor of the Green Ginger Limeade juice competes (and almost surpasses) the flavor of the smoothies, yet carries only 129 calories. Again, magic.

Here's the thing for this glorious temple of health: we really need detailed nutritional information. Myself and the other regular clients are extremely dietarily concerned. We have Macros and Calorie totals that are a delicate balance, and the nutritional information we get, when we get it, will just be a calorie number. That number is clearly not accurate as often it is attached to an item that can be served seven different ways. They also don't elaborate on side items. We really need detailed counts of carbs, protein and fat and a way to account for how changes in order (extra cheese, different wrap type, etc...) account for changes in nutritional information.

Inside, mini waterfalls are against the wall with lime green chairs and white tables. It looks pretty clean and well-maintained, except for the dusty fake plants by the booths (yuck!). The young woman at the cash register was a bit unfriendly, but one of the guys behind the counter talked to us while we waited, which made the experience a little better. 

Anyway, our group ordered: the lean angus beef burger, a teriyaki grilled chicken (wheat) wrap and the bison cheese steak (spinach) wrap.

The teriyaki grilled chicken wrap was filled with lean chicken, and definitely had more of a garden-y taste because of the fresh veggies in it. There wasn't a strong teriyaki taste, but it was still pretty good nonetheless. The jicama fries that I ordered with it weren't really that appealing. It was tasteless and watery, so it didn't really make me want to finish them off. I guess I should've just ordered the tofu fries instead. 

The bison cheese steak was the better of the two wraps (or maybe that's just my inner fat kid talking)... but I didn't see how it was healthy because it was dripping with oil. I'm not that disappointed with it because it was still pretty flavorful!

Got my food to go and I was stoked. The cheesesteak wrap looked just like the picture, and was pretty huge. But, alas not everything is what you expect it to be. It felt kind of dry. The wrap was definitely lacking. I was a bit disappointed I bothered to take the drive and took the time to get lost -_-
The tofu fries, another let down. I know tofu isn't very flavorful, but these fries looked like they should have tasted better than they did. It had a bunch of red powder, but I guess that was just decoration.

I'll give this place a 4 star review because  the food was really delicious being that it's a lot healthier than I'm used to and the young waiter who brought out our food made up for the cashiers lack of customer service.

Protip!:  A Yelp check in on your smart phone gives you $1 off towards a smoothie!  Every bit helps since the prices are high, but if you're a health nut then you'll know eating healthy is costly regardless.

For my protien I wanted the Ostrich but they were out of it this time so I settled for the Bison Burger without cheese.

My wife and eye kept seeing excellent reviews for this place, and the place being advertised all over the place.  Two weeks ago my wife and I were looking for a new place to try, and  she brought up this place.  I thought I would give it a shot, event though I expected it to be a tofu and salad type place.  When we walked into the restaurant I was met with surprise...

This place is not that just a vegetarian place.  They have a rather large menu with a mix of meat, fruits and vegetables.  They have everything from your staple foods such as chicken and beef, to exotic foods like bison and ostrich.  My wife had the bison lettuce burger which was very flavorful. My favorite aspect of this restaurant is the custom meal which allows you to pick from a number of meats ranging from poultry to fish to beef.  The meal also allows you to pick a vegetable, which there are several to choose from, a grain (also several choices), and a sauce of your choice.  I got the chicken with mixed greens, quinoa, and balsamic dressing.  Everything about the meal was excellent.  It was so good that my wife and I have eaten there 4 more times in the past two weeks.  It has become one of our favorite places to eat now.  We have also tried their smoothies with are very good as well.

The decor in this place is very cool, and their are a lot of outlets for electronic devices, which makes this place a great place to study or just go to get work done.  I have also found this a good place for many who go to LVAC to go an hang out and get a good, healthy meal.

The salads are okay, but I always think ""I could have made this at home.""  Nothing special there.

The veggie burger is just blah.  Little flavor, strange texture (as others have mentioned), and unpleasantly sticky.  Even with cheese, I didn't find it to have a good taste -- I ended up slathering the veggie burger with mustard.

Auditions are coming in close, so Ive been training and eating at home to further reach my goal.  But once a week I'll have a cheat meal and that's where Greens and Proteins comes in to play. 

I've only been here twice, and i have yet steered away from the Ginger Limeade Juice: Green Grapes, Spinach, Ginger, Lime, Agave Nectar, and blended with ice.  Sounds iffy, but trust me it is amazing.  

I tried the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken Wrap and the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap on two separate visit and they're both freakin' amazing. I love how the Teriyaki Sauce on their Wrap was not overly too sweet nor thick.  Perfect to my liking without the feeling of going over the edge since I'm sensitive to sugary taste.

The Bison Cheese Steak is probably my favorite Cheese Steak, ever!  The meat was juicy and loaded with big flavor.  Tossed with onions, red peppers, and low fat mozzarella cheese.  This one truly hit the spot and reset all my cravings for the week.

You choose Wheat or Spinach for the wrap, and also Tofu Fries or Spicy Jicama Slices for the sides.  The spice level of the Jicama is just enough to tickle your taste buds.  Great fillers.  Tofu Fries are lightly bread, baked, and served with their Russian Sauce (Low Fat Mayo, Ketchup, and Relish).

Only small gripe is that i wish the portion was just a tad bit smaller.  I have no self control when food is placed in front of me and usually end up finishing it all.   #firstworldproblems.

4051433,2013-01-25,8,p5rpYtxS5xPQjt3MXYVEwA,"Extra! Extra! Read All About It!

You're a wise man or woman, if you read some of the reviews of Greens and Proteins before trying them out.  You'll find a mix of ""I've experienced better"", ""A-Ok"", and ""As good as it gets"".  The most common issue...the sticker shock.  Yup, Greens and Proteins is on the Richie Rich side for what you get in quantity.  Smoothies over $10 (not lying), sandwiches over $12 (no five-dollar foot long here), and even their burgers are pricey starting around $10 (Where's the beef?).  I read the reviews and was armed with knowledge before I step foot in here. So, why the 5 Stars from me?   It comes to down to what I think Greens and Proteins was trying to accomplish, eating on the healthier side.  One thing about eating healthier, it sure cost more and I knew that coming in.  5 Stars because I expected less and got more.  

I came here for their Proteins, not the Greens, and decided on the ""Build Your Own Custom Meal"".  This is a 4 Step process, but I only chose Step 1, which was protein only.   You have a choice of Filet Mignon ($17), Bison ($13), Chicken ($10), Turkey ($9), Salmon ($13), and even my favorite lean meat Ostrich ($17).  I got the salmon and they knocked a few bucks off the price because I didn't get anything else with it.  The salmon is about 6 oz and to be honest, it was a little bland.  I solved this by adding a little Teriyaki sauce to it.  Voila! Problem solved. 

As for the restaurant and ambiance, it's just okay.  You get a mix of your Average Joes, Fitness Freaks, and New Year Resolutioners.  My favorite is the guy wearing a tank top, beanie, and sunglasses.  Guess this guy is just confused whether it's hot ,cold, or sunny inside.  Or, he's just too cool for the rest of us.  The wait is little longer than expected and since the restaurant is also small, it gets a little loud and crowded.

Overall, I am a fan and think Greens and Protein is as good as it gets.  If you're looking for something quick, cheap, and tasty, then Greens and Proteins may not be for you.  If you're looking for something clean, healthier, and don't mind spending a little more, then Greens and Proteins is perfect.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,13,8,5,391lAOf8AaCoIWEUMc-PSA

However, the quality of their food is absolutely amazing. I can live off the Antioxidant Chiller -- stuff is made of gold. Definitely refreshing after a good work out if you're not into the Wellness Drink, which tastes like grass but I'm sure it's ridiculously good for you. 

And after that hard work out and you want to find some good food under the guise of low calories, get the BBQ Chicken Pizza. I can also eat that stuff for days and maybe they're lying to me and it's not as healthy as it should be, but I can die in happy ignorance.

Antioxidant Chiller = ~$6
Wellness Drink = ~8 (use the Yelp check-in for $1 off)

First the food: I've never really eaten in this restaurant but my HCG diet told me about their amazing prepared meals they have Which are 10$ and weigh out the 4 ounces of meat with 2 cups of acceptable veggies. So good!!! 

ROID RAGE guy... So there was a crazy roid rage maniac who interrupted me as I was paying for my 4 meals to go... He said, ""ummm.. Scuse me miss.. I'm in a hurry and trying to pay and get out of here. So if you don't mind.."" Then he proceeds to try and cut me...by stepping in front of me... You can tell he worked out but was super Aggro. Angry and very rude. Then he was rude to Savannah... The sweet lady checking us out. He did this AS I was paying... The amazing cashier Savannah stepped in and quickly put him in his place. Then....

HE TRIED to start a FIGHT!:: Then he started to try and start a fight with me and my BF as he was leaving. Saying, ""fuck you"" and motioning for us to go outside to 'fight' him... Let me repeat this interaction above was ALL that happened. It was so bizarre. I said why is he so angry?? Then I asked the cashier and all of the employees said he's rude every day... 

It got me to thinking. Although my BF and I ended up paying close to 70$ before we left.. Maybe more.. (because we ordered food for lunch and dinner tomorrow)... And I will probably eat the majority of my next months meals here... Even if this guy is a customer EVERY day.. He should NOT be allowed to be in here and wreck our experience. His rudeness was all my BF and I spoke about all dinner. I hope the owners read this and although my food and experience with the workers here has been great.. They should rectify this situation by banning this guy because I really am dreading have to run into him again... It's giving me anxiety about coming in.. And if every employee knows him I'm sure if they read this they will know exactly who I am talking about. 

Other than that guy... My experience here is amazing. I've lived in LA forever and they really GET this whole healthy living lifestyle thing.

That being said, Greens and Proteins, while expensive, is worth it. I'm not saying I'd be dropping money here every week, but it is a splurge for a quick bite (or just a smoothie). Thus far I have had two of their smoothies, my favorite of the two being the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Shake: Cacao powder, dark chocolate chips, banana, roasted peanut, avocado, kale, spinach, zucchini, flax seed, chia seeds, honey, vanilla, agave nectar. This produces a smooth, yet thick smoothie I really enjoy.

I've also had the Green Leaf Berry Blast: Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapple, lemon, carrots, cabbage, spinach, kale, vanilla, agave nectar. Not as good as the Peanut Butter Banana taste-wise, and the texture is much more watery. However, all those berries, and vegetables - you know you are getting a powerful boost of nutrition.

Lastly, food-wise I have had their BBQ chicken pizza. It comes out on a thin crust with low-fat mozzarella, chicken, and red onions. It was recommended to me by the staff and I have to agree with them - it was delicious, crisp, not at all greasy, and delightful to be eating a pizza that isn't AS BAD for me as other pizzas.

Overall, I have no complaints about service or quality of food. The only thing is the big bite it takes out of your pocket book. Be prepared to spend upwards of $15-$20 if you want a meal and drink. For smoothies, the pricing is $7.50. It's not the cheapest, but when you are thinking of you health, isn't it priceless? Ha!",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,6,4,4,MMniL8yaRJTSJ5fCLtc2bQ

The manager ""couldn't get to the phone"" so I went to the store and spoke to him in person.

4520407,2013-07-23,2,p5rpYtxS5xPQjt3MXYVEwA,"A few weeks ago I went here on a Sunday evening because the Starbucks next door was packed. My friend and I were just looking for a nice quite place to chat and this place seemed like a good fit... The atmosphere was really casual; it was really calm and inviting, definitely had a trendy coffee shop feel to it. That night it was filled with a lot of young girls in yoga pants and gym shorts... I figured it must be the post-workout spot for the ladies from the LVAC across the lot.

Anyhow... as we came in my friend had ordered a wheat grass drink and we took to a table along the back wall. The seating area was nice, all of the tables were cleared and they had a grape green hue to match the healthy theme of the entire place. What was also nice was the waterfall that ran across the entirety of the back wall. Definitely gave it a calming feel with a modern nature theme... if you can try to picture that.

As we were seated I couldn't help but notice the quality of service the server/cashier was providing. While taking every order he would try to acknowledge the guest by their first name. It definitely gave it a personalized feel. It was nice to see, and I could notice a lot of the guests were regulars... if only they did a better job at greeting us as we entered the place. 

While we were seated I also ended up ordered the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken Wrap. The price was a little unreasonable for what I got, I understand it's a healthy choice but for $10.99 I expect to get a little more for the buck. I guess all that extra money went into the plating and presentation, which brings me to the next point. For as good as it looked the flavor was very disappointing. The wrap had no taste at all; the only thing that helped me distinguish the ingredients was their texture. 

Overall for what we came for I would say it definitely met our expectations and didn't disappoint, however the food wasn't so great. The ambiance was 5/5, Service was 4/5, and the Food Quality was 3/5; presentation was great, ingredients seemed fresh and health, but the taste was not there at all. Maybe it was just what I had ordered.

I will most likely not eat here again but if I needed a nice casual meeting spot I would definitely keep this place in mind. Although my experience with the food was not pleasant the intent of the visit was for a casual meeting spot and it definitely delivered on that.",WHpHghXp9EkIHyljDgjNeA,3,3,4,a8qJNIAe_aPYEuvUw9XHEw
4535764,2015-09-08,2,p5rpYtxS5xPQjt3MXYVEwA,"My friend and I came here yesterday after our workout. It was kind of pricey and honestly I didn't like anything that much. I really was just eating because I was hungry as fuck and also I spent a stupid amount of money on a juice so I felt obligated to finish it. I did have a $1 off juice/smoothie coupon for checking in when I got there but $7.50 for a juice is a little insane.
My friend got a veggie tofu wrap thing with tofu fries and we shared that and the smoothie. My other friend got a broccoli cheddar soup. 
The wrap was kind of weird. A lot of veggies (duh) but super bland for me. I had to put some ketchup on it. The fries were alright, super strange but the dipping sauce was delicious. My friend claimed to really enjoy the wrap and faux fries. I was pretty meh about them. 
My Most Expensive Juice Ever was ok. It tasted kind of weird and looked downright nasty. My friend thought it was ok too. But for that much money I was expecting a strawfull of heaven or top shelf scotch at least, not just an ""ok"" drink.
My other friend got one whole piece of broccoli in his soup, that lucky man. He ate really slow and when we left he still had like half a bowl sitting there. He and I were both still hungry as fuck when we left. So that was a bummer.
Also- some guy in line next to me described the menu perfectly: ""can you not decide what you want because everything looks so good, or because nothing stands out to you? I'm the latter."" That sums it up.",kuqjomfx-Pc0RtrMsX5Rag,4,1,3,kTepi_x_ZLq102o614ENoA

To have trust and faith in a place, it really needs to start with the person taking the order to hit the right keys and input your order correctly.  It's not rocket science and no one is being rushed, so to get your order wrong is just a sign of incompetence.  

We have been here 3 times now and have had bad experiences.  The first bad experience was the wrong smoothies being made.  The second time, the smoothies were not made properly.  We got close to what we ordered, but the people just seem to be too inexperienced.  

Now the third time, they advertise to be HCG and Vegan friendly, however, the chef and owner are not Vegans, and have not read a Vegan cook book.  Hint, hint, maybe will help becoming more familiar with what you are advertising.  This place is still kind of new, but you should have a clue before you make a claim and advertise that you are friendly to people's needs.

Again, the order was put in wrong at the register which cause the entire experience to go nowhere but down, which is sad.  This place has a LOT OF POTENTIAL, as I said in the beginning and I would love to see this place succeed if the owners and chef have the ability to tighten up their ship and get things right.  With all the holes in their staff, which leads to bad experiences by customers, ships full of holes only go in be direction, down.....as of now, I cannot give this place any more then 2 stars.  We will probably give hem one last chance before we write them off completely, I just hope they stay in business long enough for this to happen.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,8,2,2,ImYp-BYC6WEbvC830-97WQ

I couldn't imagine a cheese steak wrap, let alone a bison, but once I took a bite...mmmmm was all that I hummed.  I have to say, as a wrap I couldn't even eat everything.  As a matter if fact I saved the other half for dinner.  I could not decide between the tofu fries or the jicama fries so I was able to go half half.  They both were good, but I did favor the tofu fries.  I think I might order that as a side by itself too.

This seems to be a pretty bust place, the whole time we were there, there was always a line. But it moves quick.  The servers, if you dine in, are quick and pleasant when serving and taking away your plates.

I am not a fan of their jicama fries, I ended up tossing them in the trash.

Add in service that was painfully slow along with a not very friendly attitude and I don't see myself gracing their doors again for a long time.

Turkey Club ($9.99): Sliced turkey, turkey bacon, lettuce, and tomato, and Russian dressing on a whole wheat hoagie. Added sweet potato fries for $1.50. Decent sandwich, however, not a lot of flavor. I added some S+P and condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise) and it improved significantly. Sweet potato fries were good.

Bison Burger ($10.99): Grilled Bison burger, vegan cheese, and LTO on a whole wheat bun. Side of tofu fries. I believe they use Daiya vegan cheese, which I loooove! Plus, it's available at no extra charge! Again, very little flavor as you need to add your own condiments and seasoning, but you can do it to your liking. This was delicious! The patty was tender and cooked just the way I wanted (medium rare). Plus, the tofu fries are awesome! 

Extra Lean Certified Angus Beef Burger ($9.99): This is also grilled and accompanied by LTO. I added avocado and chose lettuce bibb for a low-carb option. Another great burger!

The best part of their menu are all the choices and options. I was delighted that they have a vegan cheese option for burgers at no additional cost.

*****Update:
My neighbor in Lake Las Vegas is a world renowned Chef and restauranteur with two 3 Star Michelin Awards. Very well known with cookbooks and his products are sold in Williams Sonoma.

I took him here for a quick wellness shake, he enjoyed it. 
Recently, I brought him in for a quick bite, and the restaurant was about 5% full. 

He ordered a pizza or flatbread, and I asked him to try my multigrain pancakes. 
He said no. 
I urged him repeatedly. 
He finally tried it and said ""my God ... Are you kidding me??? Agave nectar instead of syrup?""
 
It exceeded his expectations. And looked around the place, he said ""this is a good thing going on in here""

One bite turned into half my plate.  
He asked who the owner of the restaurant was, but I didn't see him. He likes to introduce himself when we are out and he is impressed. 

Those pancakes made a great impression on a French Gourmet chef. 
I urge a side of the if you come in the morning...

I haven't had anything I didn't like. 
But also haven't tried the whole menu, being a creature of habit. 

Spa water is available for free, they even carry the quest bars, and sometimes the Man Bake peanut butter cookies. 

I have to diet or I will look like a meat ball. 
But when I eat here, it's not bland diet food. So I actually enjoy it, and I love meeting other people who like this place too.

Every bite I had to pull and strands from the ribs of the Cabbage would get stuck in my teeth as well as not being able to be bitten off cleanly.

I got to try out their vegan pizza and some of their smoothies at a yelp event, and loved them all!  The peanut butter chocolate smoothie is crazy rich and sweet and would make a great dessert -- but it's still full of fruits and veggies! How do they do it?  I totally dug the vegan pizza - lavash crust with plenty of Daiya plus roasted peppers, kalamata olives and basil. 

I returned for a wellness shake (green veggies magically blended with ginger and other delicious items) that felt healthy but  tasted like a treat.

For lunch today, I tried the vegan burger with tofu fries.  I love these tofu fries!! They are actually more like vegan chikin fingers? nice-sized slabs of 'fu coated in a light batter, deep-fried and sprinkled w/ paprika.  I added a bit of salt and hot sauce, then they were perfect!  The burger comes on a whole wheat bun, but has no condiments.  They need some Vegenaise up in there, stat.  The burger was quite tasty and I left full and happy for ~$10 including tax and tip.

The juices are a bit pricy (~$7), but not so bad if you use them as a meal replacement.  Also you can check in on the Yelp app for iPhone and get $1 off juices and smoothies!

As a bonus for dine-in guests, they have DELICIOUS water. I'm not crazy! They make a sort of agua fresca with cucumbers and lemons, and it is damn good and so refreshing! Perfect for washing down your healthy items.",C-DfyTJjLP6PDP4P__TsBw,10,4,4,xaNIxi6L3qnPOGTq8_s0lQ

My regular cities where I dining are NYC and LA so by comparison it may have led to me be harsh with only two stars because for vegas this place might be a three or four star but for overall healthy food restaurants coast to coast it is a solid 2 star. My preferred combo of gluten free and vegan was too much for this place. That's normal. So, Conscious eaters need not apply. I was drawn in by the name because it sounded like something on Abbot Kinney - the hippest spot in Venice, CA. It's not truly a healthy food restaurant if you're actually into ACTUAL health food. If you're in transition from Chili's, Subway, TGIF's etc then this is a great stepping stone to Whole Foods or the vegan menu at the Wynn. The young guy behind the counter was not interested in my questions to determine what I could eat that had no eggs and no gluten. The answer ""Not sure"" when I ask if something has eggs or gluten is a bit of a lame response. The answer to what I could eat there was nothing so it didn't really matter anyways after all. My friend ordered a BBQ chicken pizza for takeout and devoured it, but since he regularly eats at Jack in the Box and McDonald's taking his word for quality food feedback is hardly realistic. In fact, his diet was so foul we had to cut way back on the hanging out. TMI. Still, people who go here seem to be enjoying it and the smoothie though not organic, that I took one tiny sip of, was pretty good.

She then tells me to contact GrubHub for a refund (though the order was placed correctly and had nothing to do with the driver or Grub Hub ordering service).


I called GrubHub only then to have the rep tell me that they are telling him a different story and that they aren't going to remake my food. The rep offers me a $10 credit which I never asked for. I JUST WANTED THE CORRECT FOOD.

1st dish:  Tofu and Soy Chorizo burrito...oh man, this was awesome.  The burrito was perfectly spiced and tasty.  I'm sure that any non-vegan would have never guessed that this was a vegan dish... it was that good.  The chorizo was da bomb!  The dish even came with tofu nuggets, which was amazing too.  They really need to add tofu nuggets as an appetizer.  I could eat that all day... just pop it in my mouth.

2nd dish: Granola toasted french toast... ok i must admit, that it wasn't  vegan because of the type of whole wheat bread that they used.. but it was all good with me cuz they didn't use egg to coat the granola to the bread.... so i just decided to try it.  It was delish!!!  The granola was mixed in with nuts, and raisins...mmm, mmm, mmm.  I felt like my breakfast turned into a dessert, but at the same time, it just tasted healthy. :) 

this place is like halfway between a fast food joint and a sit down restaurant... but to my surprise the dishes were visual appearing.  They took time to make it look pretty and presentable.   I was so hungry and the food looked so good, that I didn't take any pictures of my food.   I also think that the dishes are reasonably priced.  We paid less than $20 for both dishes....I love paying $20 or less for 2 people when I go out to eat.  Hey, when the food is good and the price is right, then that's an awesome deal. 

 I will go back for sure and order more off the vegan menu and try to take pics of it before I feed my face.  I recommend you try this place out and your taste buds will say thank you.",Fr1AHwaEhj1zryGBR49Z5Q,3,4,5,bm9bLBlqC4HOvQbXmDGX7w

On my first visit I ate their Crab and Avocado lettuce cups. It was very tasty and healthy. The lettuce cups came loaded with real crab! Definitely worth the $9.99 price tag. I also had their Wellness Drink! Let me tell you I am totally in love with their Wellness Drink (minus the pineapple cause i'm allergic). It only has 286 calories and  tastes amazing. I love the green grapes and the fact that they use agave nectar is perfect for my diabetes!!! 

On my next couple visits I ordered the Wellness Drink of course, but I brought my husband so I could try his drinks too! He tried the Apple Pie Smoothie. It totally tasted like apple pie! The one he got the other day though is almost as good as the Wellness drink ,but it's called the Tofu Banana Split! YUMMY! You can't taste the squash or any veggies that are in it. I recommend this one for your pickie eaters!

Greens and Proteins has a nice friendly staff and they are pretty knowledgeable about the food. They are a bit pricey, but the quality of the ingredients makes it worth it to me.

The last few visits have been a nightmare.  My fiance and I used to visit several times a week to get pizzas.  The last two times, the pizzas have been inedibly burned on the bottom.  One time, it took so long that we were given a complimentary drink.  The last time we visited, my fiance and I ordered the exact same thing but I got my pizza literally TWENTY MINUTES before he got his.  I really think they forgot to make it, because when I asked the person who brought me my food about it, he scrambled into the kitchen and the workers suddenly hopped-to.  There was nothing resembling an apology either.  Also, the last time I got a Wellness Drink (my favorite), it was still chunky and wouldn't fit through the straw.  Eww.  I didn't notice until I left or I would have sent it back.  The Wellness Drink is SOOOO expensive, but I don't really mind... that is, if the quality matches the price.

A note to the owners of this place (because I've talked to you and I KNOW you read this):  Just because you get busy doesn't mean you can let the quality become inconsistent.  It's great to have an increased sales volume, but customer loyalty is important too.

This time I opted for a meal since I just finished my lifting workout. I got the build your own HCG meal which comes with a choice of protein and vegetables. I got the grilled chicken breast, which was grilled perfectly. Tender and juicy on the inside. And steamed asparagus, which was cooked well. It also comes with a lemon slice and side sauce, tasted like a dijon mustard. Meal pricing is based on what meat you choose, chicken breast was $10. Packed in a reusable container. The portion size and price were just right. 

*** LOVES: 
- fast and friendly service! Cashier was nice and helpful with answering my questions and the guy cleaning up tables and serving orders was also friendly and helpful. He offered to check on my order so I didn't have to wait long. I really wasn't waiting long. ;-) 

- Loved the way it's designed. Clean, open, modern interior. Loved the green trim.
** complimentary cucumber lemon water. My choice of drink is always water, no matter where I go. Have to stay hydrated! 

Other likes: 
- tvs available to watch the game 
- not crowded or busy when we went (Thursday, 8pm) 
- a lot of healthy options, looking forward to trying them 
- new locations popping up all over the valley

Loved this place, will be back again and recommending to others! 

TIP: don't forget if you haven't used it, they still have the check-in offer,  $1 OFF smoothie!",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,7,7,5,pgeRRVcBdNNFrhSQaUaQOA

Even when we re-placed our order (two orders of Thai ginger soup and a hot tea), it took at least 15 minutes to come out to us. Their whole setup looked chaotic. The soup was... weird. I get using ground cashews to make something 'creamy' with no dairy, but the texture ended up pasty and odd. It was also under seasoned. To be fair, other food orders I saw coming out looked tasty. Final gripe: the single choice for hot tea was chamomile. No other herbal or green selections (not to mention black), and I wasn't informed until after I'd ordered and paid. Really people?

It's a cute place with nice, fresh decorations! The cashiers were really nice and easy to talk to - they explained thoroughly any foods and drinks I had questions about. Though it is pricey, the quality of the food does show.

I got the summer berry salad, which consists of berries, spinach, goat cheese, and raspberry vinaigrette. The ingredients were really fresh! Some of the berries are REALLY sweet by themselves, but the taste can be easily toned down if you eat the spinach and goat cheese with it in one bite. The contents of the salad worked harmoniously with themselves!

I also got the white chocolate veggiechino, which is their healthier version of the frappucino. I don't remember what exactly they put in there, but they put a lot of greens that it made my head spin from reading the description. I was expecting it to taste like a veggie smoothie, but no! It was pleasantly sweet, even with all the greens they put in there. It didn't taste anything like Starbucks frappucinos at all, which was very nice.

Plus, the environment is modern and clean with TV viewing options to boot. Alas, the only sadness is that it is located on the opposite end of town, which means my visits are limited. 

At the time of this review, you still get $1 off a smoothie when you check in on Yelp, so put your app to work! They have a wonderful ginger concoction, but on our last visit we went with the Wellness Drink, and it was a mean green delicious machine. It is worth stopping in just for a quality beverage. 

As for the eats, one of my favorite treats here are the tofu fries. I realize they may sound like a disgrace to the original almighty french fry, but as a french fry lover, I am here to say if you like tofu, you will love these. They are perfectly proportioned and lightly seasoned. Do they taste like a french fry, no? But, they do taste like you want to eat another and another and another... 

My husband has ordered the bison wrap twice, and on my last visit, I went with a ""Build Your Own Meal"" combo. You get a choice of a protein, a vegetable, a grain and a sauce. I had turkey breast, mixed green salad, and cous cous with a balsamic reduction. I ate every last bite and didn't feel guilty. I love that you can get a complete meal that is healthy and affordable without all of the pomp and circumstance that goes along with a full service restaurant.

When looking at the menu on Groupon it showed 2 vegan breakfast wrap options. When we arrived to place our order they only had one. Oh well...we decided to go with the Tofu Soyrizo Spinach wrap. We still had money left over and was going to get the Tortilla soup but it was considered a lunch item and not part of the groupon deal. 

We asked the cashier what else on the breakfast menu is vegan? He said the oatmeal, parfait and our wrap. We just had oatmeal that morning so we weren't in the mood. We double checked with him if the parfait is vegan because it said ""yogurt"" on the menu. He said yes, so we assumed it was a soy or coconut base...Oh HELL NO!! We later found out after taking several bites, me running to the restroom all night and calling them back that it had dairy. Not a happy girl. 

This point I would give them a hater review but the wrap was actually good. Maybe it was a training error on the managers part. 

I would recommend the Tofu Soyrizo wrap. It was very flavorful. Right amount of ""sauce"", preventing it from being dry. The added side  of tofu fries compliments the wrap. 

Vegan-avoid the parfait and Everyone else-definitely order the parfait. Although we were ""snaked"" the granola and the large amount of yogurt and fruit can make this a fulfilling meal.",zjtQJ8eYWVedJpWB2sFB2g,10,8,3,YALK2LouKmTXJg3Lm17DJA

I came into this restaurant on my Birthday because I recieved a gift card. After placing a very large order, the cashier (who was the supervisor on site) tells me there are no funds on my gift card. I sat and waited with my boyfriend so he could call his manager.  He spoke to his manager and informed me there was nothing they could do. They ran the card twice. He said I would need to contact the other location to resolve this matter.

The reason I give 3 stars is because of the lack of customer service. I am in customer service myself, and try to go above and beyond for each customer. He did not provide contact information for the other location, nor did he offer to contact them for me. He also failed to wish me a happy birthday. 

I ended up paying for my order out of pocket because we were hungry and on a time crunch. After grabbing a table, I realized we did not get a number for our order. I had to go up to the supervisor/cashier and ask for our table number.

G&P offers healthy/raw/healthy versions of classic foods: burgers (beef, ostrich, turkey, veggie, etc.), pizza, salads, wraps. They're vegan, Paleo, Gluten-Free, Raw, vegetarian, HCG, and carnivore friendly. Anything good made there, I can make at home for way less, and have several servings.

I'm really mixed up about this. It very much has its pros and it's cons. Vegas doesn't have a lot of guilt-free dining options, so it's refreshing, service is great, it's always clean, and the staff is super friendly and knowledgable.

The watermelon and strawberry juice was outstanding, deliciously refreshing with just a touch of agave nectar to enhance the delicious natural flavors! Yum!

Greens and proteins is THE place if ou want to eat delicious and healthy, freshly made to order meals at a very friendly price.

It would make sense that this health conscience business would be located in front of the LVAC. The  feel of the establishment is open and chill. The waterfall fountain and plants mounted to the wall gives the place some life.

Now, on to the food. I heard about this healthy pizza notion through a past Yelp event. Curious whether a good pizza could be delicious and low calorie, I stopped in for lunch. Although nothing struck my fancy at first, I ordered the Greek Pizza ($8.99) and sat down to wait for my food. I asked for a cup for water since I saw they had infused water for guests. A faint taste of cucumbers and lemon was refreshing after sweating it out in a hotbed. When my food came out, I was doubting my decision. The crust looked cracker like. After a bite, it was not a disappointment. The thin slices of cucumbers contrasted well with the tomatoes. While the feta and kalamata olives gave bold flavors to an otherwise mellow pie. My pizza was less than 400 calories and satisfying. Instead of leaving here stuffed, it was a nice change of pace. For those lighter days, I would suggest G&P.

Its happened, finally. I went twice last week for lunch. It's ubber healthy and has things on the menu I would never eat and a couple of things I would try.

I got the buffalo cheese steak sandwich with tofu fries [yes tofu]. Super good!  Went back and ordered their combo which consists of pick your: protein, grain, veggie, sauce.  I got shrimp, brown rice, asparagus, and pesto sauce.  Has calories displayed everywhere so you know exactly what's going in. Also, got a spinach and almond milk shake [sounds gross but it was amazing!!!!!]

Priced around $10 shake was like $4 but HEY you are eating healthy.  Decor is awesome with running water on the walls and bright green chairs.  

My only suggestion: salad bar or make your own salad. Pick your lettuce, pick your protein, pick your toppings, pick from an array of low fat house based dressings?????

First, they were so polite from the first time I called several weeks ago to inquire about their catering. I mean they really sounded excited to help me, even though at that point, I was just feeling out the local businesses to see who we'd go with. Then I had made a few changes to the menu this last week, at which time they still sounded excited to do our large order. Then, the day before our event, I got a call from the chef and we talked over all our menu selections and I modified a couple items. My wife can't eat onions, so not only did they comply with removing onions from one of the items, but he made suggestions to add something else to compensate...above and beyond, love it!

Their catering menu online is easy to pick from and does a nice job describing the items. I do recommend the .pdf version as it's easier to read. We had a party for about 20 people, and while we bought way too much food, people were all raving about it and I think every single person asked me where we got it. I was so happy with all the selection. 

We had quite a list:
-Chicken quinoa cups (fantastic)
-Mini ahi tostadas (didn't last long, omg they were good!)
-Thai peanut chicken satay (awesome chicken strips on a stick!)
-Grilled buffalo chicken skewers
-Sweet potato goat cheese skewers (I wish we'd gotten 5 orders of these instead of 1, they are heavenly)
-Tenderloin beef tip skewers (gone by the time I got food :-) a sign of how good they were )
-Angus sliders (didn't get one, but people were raving! This is where I didn't get the onions and   the substitution was made...people loved them)
-Caprese sliders (so good and tasted so fresh!)
-1 each of grilled asparagus salad and the pear and goat cheese salad (both were so fresh and both fantastic) the salads are pretty big. 

My pickup was at 5:30 and these guys were finishing it up on time to the minute. As the guys were carrying some of the items to my car, the chef and his crew were finishing up some of the last minute hot items. It was really busy in the restaurant and I truly appreciate that as I left, not only did the chef take a minute to go over everything with me, but one of the other guys took time to stand and look me in the eye, wish me luck with the party and said he really wanted feedback on how everything tasted.

Absolutely fantastic customer service and food for this catering event that was very important to me and my family! Thank you to the team at Greens and Proteins for making it wonderful!",bNTeAyHCJzbHwPWBeGC23w,0,0,5,0xNSUxktVgdmsHbG-46OIw

This place is smart with their marketing and ambience.  I'm just going to give a quick positive/negative feedback:

Positives:

               Space- It's clean and has modern, simple  decor. Easy to sit and chat for a while.
               Turkey- It's real, sliced turkey; not processed deli meat.

Negatives: 

                 Food quality- I'm annoyed how they come across to everyone. They want you to think this is amazing healthy food.  Not one item on their menu is organic.  They also don't have a lot of alternative ingredients to choose from. They seem to have limited knowledge of gluten-free and vegan foods. This leads me to the next negative.

                 Price- It is pretty expensive.  At least 7 dollars for a smoothie and at least 10 dollars for a sandwich.  It would be understandable if they used organic, high quality ingredients, but no.  Their ingredients do not cost much at all, therefore they are taking advantage of people.  

               Environmentally friendly? - First of all, they don't use real plates. (They care about health but not environment.) So they use paper plates.  Okay, at least they quickly biodegrade.  But wait! The utensils are crappy plastic ones.  What the heck? Be consistent. 

Overall, I seriously feel that whoever opened this place does not care about any of the things they market.  I think they know that being healthy is in, and are trying to bank on it.  They should be serving organic fruits, veggies and meats.  They should have a vast working knowledge of other types of foods for substitutions. They should be using real plates and silverware, or using all biodegradable/compostable things.

And they should not be insulting our intelligence. Needless to say, I'm not going back.  I'd rather spend my money on a place that gives quality food for a normal price.",4EKW1EdJpoB-RMcuhbxqQA,11,1,2,KGDxMI17RJwSrtYoplvobQ

The line was really long. Almost out the door. I had to kind of stand off to the side because it was so busy. The staff was extremely nice. Their menu items are listed as well as the calorie count so that is much appreciated. I decided to try the acai berry smoothie (acai, green grapes, blueberries, blackberries, pineapple, coconut, beet powder, spinach, kale, honey, banana, and peaches). Yum! 

The smoothie took awhile to make but it was delicious and very filling for me. I also decided on the low carb Caesar salad.  I actually really disliked this salad. Not recommended. Maybe it was the Parmesan crisps on the top or the EVOO caesar dressing but I didn't like the way it tasted at all. However the decor is very beautiful, vibrant green chairs and they have real plants, along with 2 waterfalls against the back walls. Beautiful and relaxing! 

Pros: beautiful decor, friendly staff, free wifi, nice outside patio seating as an option, complimentary cucumber water, tv's along the wall

I'd already looked it up online prior to arriving and I just cannot believe their smoothies and wellness drinks cost so much!  You need a healthy wallet to drink healthy there!

My friend had the vegan pizza and she loved hers, but she also is a regular customer and has a much healthier wallet than I do.

When I asked the girls behind the counter  about the base, they said they didn't know anything about it and just held up the jar for me to see. Flavor bases, pork, chicken, beef and vegetable bases are chock full of partially hydrogenated soybean oil (transfat) and hydrolyzed soy protein (MSG). No bueno. The vegetable base had a Top Ramen flavor packet flavor in the drink.

I was disappointed that the drink was so pricey and I don't have the guts to walk out of a place after I'm there, especially after the staff was friendly. I took a drink of the V9, and was even more disappointed - the flavor and the temperature was not a good combination. Ice cold salty ramen flavor mixed with wheat grass and dried tomato seeds was what I first noticed. I couldn't drink any more of it but thought if I took it home and heated it up, it might make a nice soup. I ended up giving it to my dad, who juices vegetables 3x a day, and he told me not to buy that drink again. He said the cabbage was giving the drink a strange flavor.

As a dietetics student at UNLV, I would love to see this place get rid of the agave syrup (it has more fructose than high fructose corn syrup, so it's even MORE unhealthy!) As well, I'd love to see them scrap the unfermented soy bean products - that stuff is so toxic and causes so many adverse health problems, specifically in the thyroid and reproductive organs, that it has no business in an establishment that prides itself on being ""healthy."" (If these things were gone, I would raise my star rating.)

I'd love to see their raw offerings on the menu (it was a line I noticed after I ordered) and to see their drink prices decrease by 2 dollars. Even though they may be a better alternative to Jamba Juice, it really says something when Jamba Juice is considered the affordable alternative. I was sad when I checked in, AFTER to paying, that there was a dollar off coupon for drinks. Agh! frustrating. 

The place is pretty and the staff is nice, but the restaurant was empty. As long as the prices are as high as they are, I can't see this being any place other than a splurge treat. I may try this place out again, but I wouldn't reorder the V9.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,19,6,2,xhAzJRywq8CTJkqpezQvoA

The place was packed, looked like there was plenty of seating (Inside & out)  I loved the earthy vibe with bright green chairs. I took a better look at the menu and noticed they also cater to those crazy RAW and HCG dieters which was pretty cool. 

As I waited for my summer berry salad and antioxidant smoothie, I was so pissed I didn't order the ostrich burger I was originally thinking about. (Damn it, I always tell myself to go with my gut, or first pick) It looked so good. From what i could see they cook just about everything in their brick oven. 

The manager or owner noticed me being nosy, and made a joke, I told him it was my first time, and couldn't help it!  He was really nice, asked my name and told me my order was coming shortly. When my salad was ready he told me that put my chicken in a separate container so it wouldn't wilt my spinach.  Crazy nice!

Everything you need is here if you're trying to slim down, following Paleo, like eating healthy, or are in to getting more than just the typical bland smoothie. The setup is clean, the service is nothing short of excellent and I will definitely be going back. The only reason I couldn't give it five stars is because the portion sizes are always inconsistent. One visit I'll get a perfectly sized chicken breast or bison meat, the next time the meat is barely enough to qualify as a snack for a five year old at recess. Some type of uniformity here so I know whether to order extra meat or not would help.

Regardless, the shakes are good and the food is delicious.  And the place is really a 4.5 it's just that this place has to be scored on a scale. When I eat at some places I think wow this food is amazing because A) the process to make was long and complex so I needed someone else to just make it B) it would be hard to find those ingredients to make it or C) it's something new that I have no idea how to make. This place doesn't apply to either of those criteria, its basic and you can make it yourself if you have the time and its going to taste exactly how you think its going to taste. (Chicken, asparagus and couscous - there's no surprise here you know what it's going to taste like but hey its good and if you want to stray away from basic the wraps and hamburger will do the trick). BUT this is not a knock on the place because I will be here every week attempting to counter the fried cheese bacon dough thingamajig I will probably have every weekend. And their juices and smoothies are actually different from what you'll find around town and actually have me feeling better after I down one so even if you hate eating healthy, their juice and smoothies are still worth the trip.",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,7,2,4,MehooeCNbdEv7YId0M7Ukg

The menu is good, and the food can be good if there's no hair or moldy berries,  but the people who work there need to be re-trained with health code standards. Also, I notice they get  to go orders wrong (which is obviously annoying) and charge a few bucks higher for the same order than the west location, and when I inquire as to why, sometimes they correct the value and sometimes they don't.

My friend had the Bison wrap and loved it. I hesitated to update my review because I still wasn't impressed by the food, but didn't want to post a negative review when I knowingly ordered something I didn't like the first time around and my friend loved his wrap. But seriously, if you're healthy food joint and can't make a good grilled chicken wrap... what can I say?  I tried it again one more time and had the turkey burger, which while it needed some salt - was much better than the chicken wrap. The tomatoes were a way overripe ... but it wasn't bad as a whole. I still love the idea of the jicama fries, but they could really do something to make them tastier, like a citrus dressing option or something.. anything. LOL.

5734024,2013-01-18,0,p5rpYtxS5xPQjt3MXYVEwA,"Best smoothies in Las Vegas, - whether you are vegan or not, these are unvelivable and very healthy, and not loaded with disguised names for sugars like turbinado, cane sugar,  etc. Although they do have honey and /or agave in them so you can ask for that to be omitted, you wont miss it. I love their green shake and their chocolate peanut butter banana shake personally.
They sneak in things like zucchini, and kale, and other very healthy foods and i swear you do not taste them! 
Although i have gone there many times for the smoothies i will admit I have eaten there only twice, neither was memorable for the price, i give them credit for making a difference to give people healthy options, but for example ...the tofu fries are not healthy, they are just deep fried tofu sticks The daiya cheese based vegetarian pizza is good compared to some places versions of it, but the only way to make it truly vegan(unless you want it served on a raw cracker) is to get it on the gluten free crust, after you substitute the crust you are getting charged 14.99 , otherwise if you dont mind the raw crust its 11.99 -in my opinion it is rather small and can be inhaled in just a few bites, i say its 8 inches at most and very thin. Not a great value -If you do the ""build your own custom meal"" they let you pick 1 protein, 1 vegetable, and 1 grains, not a great value, the plate is very very small.. although healthy tasting and not oily to try to make it taste better. but by the time you lunch and the smoothie you are looking at 20.00 minimum and you wont be full after.
Another issue i find is it can be very busy at lunch time, and they only ever have 1 person working the cash register, the line up can go out the door and the seats are all taken during these rushes. , combine that with people asking questions about the menu and being indecisive (me included)I think they should get at least 1 more register to get things running more smooth.",4Z269_3Hvkj36UmijbWeUA,2,0,4,ZEWFBfKxtpbU0ofpl1o-8Q

Service is alright. Nothing going beyond the means of customer service & nothing that's bad either.

If you are anyone who is a raw foodie, don't expect this place to state it uses USDA Organic certified items just because it's named 'Greens and Proteins' (that's a question I'm going to ask the next time I'm in!)

The pricing was what got me, since I could get a green smoothie at Whole Foods for about .50 cents less than here (one that is a lot less sweeter). 

I purchased the vegetable wrap & the green smoothie, all of which came out to $20 (definitely not cheap, as most health-alternative restaurants aren't). I was pleasantly surprised how delicious the green smoothie turned out! While $7.50 is a little much, at the same time it was in a cup that was generous in size for its price. It was very sweet (from the agave nectar & stevia), nothing like the green smoothies from Whole Foods which are a little more on the less sweeter end. I was even more impressed by the vegetable wrap, for it was a filling size (had to take the other portion to-go) & it came with these tofu-like fries with seasoning & a dip sauce on the side that was amazing! 

Walking in, I was a little questionable about this place, even more so by the price, but after tasting it for myself, it's actually quite good here.

Service is always friendly, but can be hit or miss because the likelihood they will mess up your order is almost 50%....haha. But they are very nice about remaking food if they got something wrong.

I love breakfast foods so my fave go-to is the tomato mozzarella frittata (which comes with this amazing watermelon salad!!!)

Be wary of all the gym rats that frequent this place....G&P's are very conveniently located next to a LVAC gym, and you can definitely tell they attract that clientele ;) This particular location is is probably my fave (been to the one on Flamingo which isn't as warm or bright) and while neon green isn't my favorite color, the restaurant is overall very clean and modern.",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,1,2,4,_Moa-0Vt3yO6LKCccETdJQ

I always get my usual and there is a difference in consistency between the two. Both places are good overall but the one thing that stands out between them is the customer service.

 I love their turkey chili but every bite has a 1:10 ratio of turkey and beans. I felt like the beans was the main course. Please change your recipe to add more turkey! I know it sounds a bit silly to make such a request but who would want to eat a spoon full of beans when the name is called turkey chili. 

The batch they make is already pre-made. Everytime I've asked for light on the beans at the Rainbow location they made the effort to make me a batch of where they hand scoop out the extra beans for me for no extra charge. I tipped well as a thank you. It was amazing and I was very happy. It still looked and tasted like their original. (This location is next to my corporate office. I'm assuming they have better customer service to please the business professionals.)

This Eastern location, the chef didn't even care to try. They said they would have to charge me for an extra turkey patty. I basically had to pay $7.00 for a chopped up hamburger patty that's thrown on top of my chili. Not even mixed in for me. *image attached* It looked lazy. I had to bring it back and let them know I paid basically $14.50 for half a cup of chili with a patty thrown on top. I had to ask for a second cup of at least a bit of extra chili since I did paid in full for it.

Little situations like these are the details that makes a business good to great.",xedHsPfMpBr-WUKEwlb8rA,3,4,3,1HmkjUb5Jyc5WdXlouslgQ

Great decor and look. The owner was dressed nice and served our food and was very welcoming. Def. going back to this spot in vegas!",gvKlBHFA6VXb9AksWcPMjw,1,1,5,w1Vm4KXF3yyJw_8-173_9A
5930633,2018-04-17,0,p5rpYtxS5xPQjt3MXYVEwA,"So this restaurant is very close to my house so it makes it convenient to come here. The service is alright i suppose.. not like they go out of their way to make you happy or anything. Although they do bring it out to you pretty fast. 

So the last time I was there I ordered the salad with berries in it.. along with some grilled shrimp on top. it was very tasty!! would definitely order again! 
I also ordered the grilled chicken tacos.. presentation wise it was pretty and was quite tasty as well. 
The other times Ive been there Ive ordered a lot of their juices and smoothies and they are all so good!! 

overall i would recommend this place to others that want a healthy place to go to.. its delicious and fast!",xIjw368KoWqmAZ7JUrwf3A,2,0,4,bpTcejHpJGAiplQc_yX_-g

It was sooo much better than I expected and was very filling. I tried the stubborn soda (acai and lemon flavor) and was NOT satisfied. It was literally just sparkling water. However, I did try the vanilla cream and it was much better!! The guy who handed me my food also went across the place to get me a fork which was really nice.

So we ordered a wellness juice which is pretty good, he ordered a angus burger and I order a grilled veggie wrap ( because I'm vegetarian) and they gave me a grilled chicken wrap?? What? Chicken doesn't sound like veggie... And the jicama ""fries"" are raw and taste like dirt. Additionally the cashier was kinda snotty to us. Seeing as it's our first time and we got some crappy service and a wrong order they get 3 stars.",gdDTmvbfKLDYLUnjRrCcaA,1,0,3,Z-Kte6R1xwNfO4UW4sIASA
5959257,2014-08-23,4,p5rpYtxS5xPQjt3MXYVEwA,"My friend had been wanting to check out Greens and Protein, so I decided to join in for dinner. 

The place is cute and very modern with a green and fresh-looking atmosphere. I opted for the bison burger with tofu fries. The food arrived quickly and it didn't do much for me visually. The burger was cooked decently, but the flavors were lacking. Everything was a little bland. I love tofu, but the fries were rubbery and the jicama fries I tried from my friend's plate were ok. I usually like jicama a lot, but these were overly vinegary and not what I was hoping for when I bit in. Most others seemed to agree since most people were dumping a majority of their fries in the trash that I saw. 

The burger was solid, but nothing else really hit home for me. I appreciate the ""healthy"" food they seem to pride themselves in here, but I'd have to try more to see if there's anything that really hits the spot for me.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,7,8,3,jnniPGmpbVySvYhUwiJcBA

I always forget greens and proteins is just down the road. Healthy food with flavor!!! Thank you!,lxQpXbwYm7nok_dDlJd_Ug,0,0,5,nIKbmK2TTnuBT4YRAUH_pA

They make it easy to maintain a healthy diet for a person who's constantly on the go. Plus they are more then happy to adjust your order to your specific diet needs. I'm a ovo vegetarian and asking for a substitute of eggs in a wrap or burger instead of the meat is never an issue.",GAfXmdJj-xh8Z6N1Qs1A3A,1,0,5,-7_88aDmu9-71sXXPMAPgQ

The atmosphere is fun and comfy...regardless of how busy it gets, the vibe is always amazing! My go-to item on the menu is the veggie pizza, with vegan cheese and gluten free crust. It never disappoints and is far better tasting than a lot of greasy, fatty pizzas I've tried. Healthy and tasty, I'd say that's a win win! I will continue to return every time I get the urge to indulge in pizza, simply because I won't have to suffer the guilt, or bloat. Not to mention, everything else on the menu is awesome...salads, smoothies, juice, and so forth. Whatever it is, you really can't go wrong!",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,3,2,4,97Pw9Ndd0dRiV0VDKjWIyg
