I gave him my order and then he went to make it and I looked at my receipt and it didn't say what I had said which was unsweetened so I asked him to make sure and in a barely audible voice he said yea.

However, the service is terrible and the front counter/cook staff are terrible. 
Me and the wife came to meet for a quick lunch, there was only a single person in here when we arrived. We were greeted by walking in to the manager telling an employee ""you need to follow the recipe, you can't just make this up as you go."" -lol
Now when it comes to ordering, and they're asking for specifics about your order and sides, you would assume he's ringing it up right? Nope. 
50% of the order was incorrect and some was just simply not rang up. 
So the wife's had to be ordered again, so we didn't eat together after all.

This is my second time experiencing bad customer service here. I walked in with a friend and there was one lady in front of us. She looked like she had been waiting for a while. I only saw one employee in the store. He was working in the back preparing smoothies. He then came up to the counter, handed out the two smoothies to the other two people who had been waiting and without even glancing at the woman in front of me, he began cleaning and working on other things by the blenders. We waiting for another good 10 minutes before the lady in front of me expressed she was going to Jack in the Box instead and left. We stepped to the front of the line and continued waiting since I was really in the mood for a smoothie. Another 10 - 15 minutes went by and nothing. The employee refused to make eye contact or acknowledge me in any way. I finally grew impatient and began calling out ""Excuse me?"" to try and get his attention and he refused to even look at me, although I can't be sure he heard me from how far back he was. My friend and I ended up leaving after spending half our lunch hour just waiting at the cash register for our order to be taken and ended  up getting smoothies Jamba Juice.  I've worked in customer service all my life and cannot believe that there was so little service at this restaurant. To not even acknowledge a customer standing at the register for that amount of time is just ridiculous. This is the second bad experience I've had at this location and I am very hesitant to give Tropical Smoothie my continued business when this is how customer's are being treated. I tried to look around for the name or phone number of a store manager and did not see anything posted in the store nor on their website. I really hope this message finds it's way to someone in charge of that store because this was just  unacceptable. 

The first time I had a bad experience I had walked in and ordered food promptly (there were more employees present that time) and then proceeded to wait over 30 minutes for a caesar wrap. I had an important work meeting and had already planned to spend a certain amount of time getting food, eating and then leaving on time but because the wait for the food was 30 - 45 minutes, I ended up being late for my meeting. I went up to the register several times to inquire how much longer and each time I was told it would just be "" a few more minutes"".

Finally I had to make noise and then this girl with no personality came out and asked how long I had been waiting, I told her and she was like ok I need to figure out what is wrong with the door because it has a sensor that should let me know when someone opens the door.   I really don't care about the technical difficulties you are having when I didn't even get an apology.  That may have made a difference.  But really, what is she doing here by herself anyway. 

My sandwich on this occasion was still good but the smoothie was soupy.

They advertised a ""Buy two get one free"" special, but somehow they forgot about this and charged me for all 15 drinks. It was such a fiasco getting the difference refunded as well. After some long debate, the manager (who wasn't even onsite) finally approved a refund.
And after the long wait, (and to make a long, ridiculous story short), we ended up getting only 14 drinks.

Drinking an ice slushy that tasted like water with a splash of kale wasn't my intention or idea. Hey, I get it, they are trying to be ""au natural"" and healthy by using turbinado as sweetener or whatever. But man, should the smoothies also not have any flavor? 

I ordered the newly advertised ""Island Green - Spinach, Kale, Mango, Pineapple & Banana."" I also added vitamins: energizer, B12, Vitamin C, Multivitamin - it racks up fast at 99 cents each. I said the hell with it, since I was feeling under the weather.

The drink was very disappointing. I definitely expected more substance and flavor from all of the vegetables and fruit it advertised. No mango, no pineapple, no banana flavor? It wasn't even naturally sweet from those fruits and vegetables. It was a light green color and all I could taste was a light hint of kale, mostly watered down. 

It had waaaay too much ice compared to the fruit/vegetable/sweetener ratio they put into it. It was not worth the $9 and change. 

Other annoyances:
1. We could barely read the menu on the wall due to blinding glare from the lighting in the place. (The girl just looked at me like I was crazy that I couldn't read it.)
2. The girl behind the counter seemed annoyed we didn't know the menu since it was our first time there.

The smoothies are always great here, their super grain bowls are delicious and filling, and the rest of the food is decent for healthy ""fast"" food. They also run great promos and offer coupons, though it's too bad they got rid of the customer loyalty cards.

   Last week I was in a hurry on my way to work and ordered a chicken pesto wrap with their substitute chicken to go. When I got to work and bit into my sandwich I realized it was actual chicken and it made me sick. I couldn't return it as I was already at work. 
  I never get as much as a smile from the employees, they're rude and always act as if I'm troubling them with my business. 
  I was ordering there quite often before and using their rewards card. (You get it stamped so many times and they give you a free smoothie). I misplaced one and was told that I could start a new one and if I found the old one I could combine the stamps and still get my smoothie.  Well, I found the old one and took them both in to redeem my smoothie since I had the required number of stamps. The girl behind the counter rolled her eyes and said ""I don't even know if we can take it like this."" Another girl came over with the same attitude and said ""it's fine.. Just take it"". 
  While I received my free smoothie I also received the worst possible service. 
   I will not be going back there ever again. I'll just take my business elsewhere.",H1g0Ij2cBqSdC-AK1yZhbA,1,0,1,n_il0oPY7r2jBdem14gU7w

I drive by this place fairly often and have never gone in. 

The promotion was for a good cause (I forget the charity), but it's a tax write off for the company and a smart way to attract new customers like me. 

My pita was pretty good and only $4.50. The free strawberry something smoothie wasn't bad either. It wasn't as flavorful as jambalaya juice, bit I don't normally have strawberry smoothies so I can't compare it to anything.

The smoothies we ordered were fine. But the dishonesty and service were epically bad. 

A month ago I purchased two smoothies. I was charged 7 different times over the next two weeks:

Called repeatedly and phone only answered days later. When someone did answer several days later they said there was no manager . 

Finally I went in and brought my receipt and bank statement. The store was empty and I was asked to wait after the cashier told me it wasn't possible . A woman who appeared to be the manager went outside and sat a patio table without acknowledging me. I asked what was going on to the same cashier who told me I'd have to wait an hour because she was going to be doing an interview soon? What?!!!!!!!
I went outside and called the nearest tropical smoothie franchise and spoke to a polite and professional manager at the red rock location. She called over to ft Apache and Sahara and told me if they didn't get their act together to come her location. I did return and met a very pissed off manager who explained my card was never charged. I showed her my receipt and the bank statement . She finally conceded there was a problem and told me there was a problem with the register.
