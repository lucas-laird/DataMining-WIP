If you are looking for a lovely Japanese dinner, this is the place.  They serve more than sushi here.  In fact, we didn't even order the sushi, we ordered other items off of the regular menu.

My favorite dish was the shrimp with egg.  If you are familiar with country Japanese foods, you will appreciate this dish.  The egg was cooked perfectly (and I am a real stickler for soft scrambled eggs), with large shrimp bursting out of the yellow yummy and the seasonings were spot on.  Both times we ate here, we ordered this dish.

The half duck was delectable.  By far the meatiest duck I have ever eaten.  Moist and juicy!  We also ordered the Garlic Basil Eggplant, probably the best dish on the menu.  Our entire party raved about .  We also ordered this one twice.  

The restaurant does not have their liquor license yet, but it is in the works.  It is located in a strip mall, way back in the corner where other restaurants have been overlooked and therefore failed (one of our favorite breakfast places used to occupy this space).  I really hope this place catches on, I want to visit it every time I go to Vegas - Yeah Baby! and try many more items on there very extensive menu.",2qG875EzMfFMDcqaDvIjkw,0,0,4,PyWV9LbLLf3ej_WELkAyUQ

The lobster chef favorites steam with fresh garlic serves with pasta taste great! My kid love the shrimp tempura! The price is fair.",dlhvw9ehJ6K2amlPf48zxA,1,0,5,_P8KRyBjMau_Socj8_B5ZA
1808602,2015-01-29,3,xWeUlwx1eiZjyME5p93x_A,"I'm a little baffled- a place named for seafood has fairly lackluster reviews for their sushi and seafood items. Others have complained about pricing but most rolls average $12 or less, didn't feel like anything was inappropriate. 

 I wholeheartedly agree with Reggie that the GARLIC BASIL EGGPLANT dish is to die for! Awesome takeout option for Meatless Monday or just when you're craving something lighter- contains several cloves of garlic, crispy for texture and high on flavor. $10 gets you a portion with rice that is easily two meals.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,2,3,OpWwfgmEuz3vspj310zlYQ

Felt it was just alright, nothing terrible but I wouldn't want to order it again. service was great though.",epI9WPa8sp_LXqe2-TtTIA,1,0,2,vNOeAbUm5sgsLaTnTHpvbA
2118909,2015-03-06,1,xWeUlwx1eiZjyME5p93x_A,Last week there was no sushi because there was no sushi chef. Today Hoso was closed with no closed sign posted. Strange way to run a new restaurant. Will they reopen or not?,xAuESpLFFHCgcNb9NQ4M1Q,1,1,1,pj-dKrrDIjM2IKZ_j4uqaw

The tempura was very good as well, nice and crunchy, not oily. We also had slices of raw snapper with jalape√±o and lobster sushi roll, they were both unimpressive. Overall we really like the restaurant and the atmosphere and will definitely be back to try other dishes.",-HCTj_9U0iMDPbnLxDTRiA,0,0,3,2FIHg52oPDGmQoGhOW3unA
3079145,2014-12-05,1,xWeUlwx1eiZjyME5p93x_A,"For a quick simple sushi lunch, this is a good place to go in this area. They have a lunch menu that includes katsus, teriyaki, tempuras, and simple standard rolls such as spicy tuna. All lunch dishes come with a side salad with ginger dressing and miso soup. Their regular menu has a variety of nigiris, sashimis, special rolls, and some Chinese and Korean influenced dishes such as honey walnut shrimp and kimchi noodle soup. They also have different types of soups and curries. The lunch menu is reasonably priced, 1 dish around $8-9 average. The service was good and it's clean and spacious. Going in I didn't expect much, but overall it was a good visit. I especially enjoyed my salmon skin handroll. The sushi rice is seasoned well and they are portioned well as in they don't over do it on the rice to save the goods. They give a generous portion of fish. The freshness was ok, good enough to eat. One thing I dislike is that they serve tap water... boo. Overall I am happy this place opened. Now I have my go to Sushi place near work when I don't know what to eat for lunch.  Oh, they also have bobas!",hsJLv8er94o9S_6Z9w-nHw,5,2,4,Lx4D8c-q3E97dTNGnjlWmA

The fish was fresh and well prepared.  Staff was attentive and helpful.  Its not a fancy place, but its also not as expensive as some of the other sushi joints on the westside.  I think there a lot of value on the menu, and we will be back.",awB0KEeF9mq_eb-l6tvEKw,5,2,4,gkfPXPUh7-JzEwh-hcyY4Q

4690729,2014-12-24,0,xWeUlwx1eiZjyME5p93x_A,"Came here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised. First off, the location is pretty nice (right in the heart of Summerlin). The inside was big and spacious, well lit and decorated nicely. We were seated right away at a booth. The lunch special menu was very reasonably priced. I got the two-roll special which came with miso soup and salad. A full salmon roll and teriyaki chicken roll for only $8.50? Yes please! In all we ordered the fried eggplant, duck, crispy chicken, honey glazed wings, and Singapore noodles, all of which were quick to come out, but also very delicious. I especially loved the fried eggplant because it was seasoned perfectly and just slightly crispy on the outside and cut into manageable wedges. They tasted like french fries but better because it's healthier! What was also great about this place was our waitress was very courteous and attentive to our needs, she even took all the dishes we wanted to-go to the back and packaged them up for us. I had no complaints, so really the only reason I held back from giving five stars was that my tastebuds weren't completely blown away, and to be honest there aren't many places that have done that for me. Don't get me wrong though, this was still a very satisfying meal and I'd gladly come back to try some more sushi!",BM6Hsh_kXQ5wE0HCSEi4vA,2,0,4,WAxURXLHx-iQZVKBhwY15g
5969837,2014-12-19,0,xWeUlwx1eiZjyME5p93x_A,"Went for the lunch special. We had one beef special and one chicken special. Each came with miso soup and a lettuce salad. The beef came with a California roll.  The service was friendly and attentive. The food tasty but not outstanding .  We enjoyed the California roll and hot tea.  
It is a large restaurant with a small menu. They may have a tough time with several AYCE sushi spots within a 5-10 min drive.  Change to AyCE sushi and that would tempt me to return.",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,2,0,3,qJ_pLUFCtlc3uiTplrKwIA
