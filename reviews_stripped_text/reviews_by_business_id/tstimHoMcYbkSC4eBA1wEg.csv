We had the enchilada verde special on the chalk board: about $9 for three enchiladas in green sauce with beans and rice. Meal came with fried tortillas to break into chips, and some fresh red salsa. Everything tastes authentic without melting our gringo tastebuds.

Water was clean, server was nice, music was pleasant. Food reminded me of a place that I grew up with back in SoCal and pined for when I moved out to the valley a decade ago. It took a long time to find this, and I am sad to spend like $5 in gas just to make a trip out here, but it's worth it.",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,0,0,5,2eX2Xi_1g8V1gaPHhBH9FQ

The only complaint I really have is the chips are not really chips, but tostadas.  The salsa was good, not heavy on the tomatoes and they don't give you a bean dip.  Other than that, I really enjoyed the food.  Really, it prevents you from going heavy on the tostadas and spoiling your appetite.

I had the chicken enchiladas and they serve three nicely sized enchiladas for a reasonable price; they were ""money!""  In other words, they tasted really good and I'm picky when it comes to Mexican food.  I dined with some of my co-workers and they all enjoyed their food.  For the people that order the Burrito, it is huge!!!

The only draw-back is the side of town it is on, but the strip mall where it's located didn't seem shady.  The restaurant is next door to a Mexican bakery. 

I really don't think you can go wrong with this place.",FEJhYnXdFHhBqPwhAxsGmQ,0,0,5,9K5vPmx2ZfWhkMEXW44QRA

591008,2015-04-25,1,tstimHoMcYbkSC4eBA1wEg,"We took the 14 . 7 mile drive from the south end of the strip to this restaurant because of the good yelp reviews, we were a little surprised to find it is actually a small 8-9 table restaurant attached to a Panadaria (bakery ), but it looked nice enough and so we went on in, there were only a couple other patrons, and our waitress quickly cleaned off a table for us and we sat down, she soon returned with chips and salsa. The basket of chips was actually 5 whole deep fried corn tortillas and the salsa was very tasty, medium to spicy with fresh cilantro. Within a short 5-7 minute wait our plates arrived. I had the chicken burrito enchilada style with verde sauce. It was garnished with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. The burro was good sized, the chicken was large pieces of white meat and fairly flavorful, the burro also had refried beans and overall was decent, but kinda dry. My meal was certainly not bad, and the chili verde sauce was homemade and above average. But the entire plate came to the table only warm, not hot like many times is the custom with Mexican food dishes, where the server has to use a hot pad to bring it, within a couple minutes it seemed cold. I inquired about the quality of the other meal and the report was about the same as mine, the food was barely warm, the sauce above average but the  shredded beef was the canned variety and while acceptable certainly not like slow roasted, simmered in spices and cooked to perfection! Overall we rate this place 4  stars. The service was good, our server appeared to be working the dining room alone and was efficient and attentive. The salsa fresh and flavorful. The sauces above average. Probably a very nice neighborhood restaurant, driving here from the strip, we probably passed by quite a few better Mexican food options and probably won't be back, but we will make a stop at Luv-It frozen custard and cleanse our palates with a delicious frozen treat!

870000,2014-07-24,0,tstimHoMcYbkSC4eBA1wEg,"In search of a new good Mexican restaurant, we decided to drive across town after reading the good reviews here on Yelp. I have to say that the neighborhood was a bit suspect, and as we walked up to the door there was a vagrant right next to it. The first thing we noticed when we walked inside was a strange smell, followed by uncomfortable heat. We sat down at a booth, the waitress came over and asked what we wanted to drink, and then we asked her if the air conditioner was on. She proceeded to tell us that it was broken (by the way, the temperature outside was 108). Inside it had to be 100 degrees without exaggeration. She brought back the drinks and the chips and we considered at that point that we might just leave. Even the other guests were mentioning how stifling the heat was.

HOWEVER- after trying the chips and the salsa, we knew the food would be worth staying for. We ordered a cheese quesadilla and a steak chimichanga, and needless to say, it was FANTASTIC! I'm not a huge fan of Mexican, but the chimichanga was absolutely delicious: the steak was tender and the tortilla was fried perfectly! We ended up eating for under $20 without tip. 

The service was mediocre, but the food was fantastic. Even though there were flaws in our experience, great food will always bring us back! If the air conditioner was working, we probably would've given it 5 stars.",fSzqflrl-OTxJ6E095YknQ,1,0,4,Amx2fRXsLFnv5Sr3o5SGGw

UPDATE: Wewent again and this time our experience was very pony being seated, they put us in a booth with one side broke. It took seemingly ages to get chips and salsa, with two other tables that came in after us getting chips ahead of us. The food was ok, but nowhere near the quality of our last visits.

974203,2014-06-25,2,tstimHoMcYbkSC4eBA1wEg,"My first time here with my girl and I've gotta say, I have not been truly satisfied with a Mexican restaurant since I've been introduced to real authentic Mexican food at my friends places as I was growing up. This place most definitely brought back memories! 

To start off, anybody who's been here will know how amazing their salsa is. It's not extremely spicy and some people will judge by that but what I look for in a good salsa are the undertones and richness in flavor. IT'S GOOD. Normally when you come to a restaurant like this, you get chips with your salsa. I love that they bring out these warm, flaky, crispy, lightly salted and fried tortillas. Just a tasty little treat before we even ordered. 

The Horchata tastes great! As I've said, it's hard to please me when it comes to restaurants because people like to take shortcuts and make close to real Horchata. It is a very simple drink but you have to get it right. Here it just has the right amount of sweetness, (making up words now) cinnamony and milky taste.

Already impressed with the pre game they have going on here so I was ready to order. We started off with the Fiesta Plate appetizer and it was awesome. It had quesadillas, nachos, chicken taquitos and chicken strips. Ok so the fried chicken strips are a little out there in authenticity but they tastes good. Everything on this platter was good but I really enjoyed the taquitos! So bomb with the lettuce, beans, sour cream and guac that came with it. My girl and I shared this plate and were already pretty full so it's a good sized plate. I'd say it's great for couples or groups of 3-4. 

So if you really know, burritos are not an authentic Mexican dish. Just throwin that out there! But the way this Enchilada style / wet burrito came out tasted just the way my friends mothers would make them. The plate came garnished with sour cream, guacamole and lettuce. The burrito sat there in a glorious pool of red sauce and melted cheese. Long story short, it was perfecto. Once you undress this little beauty you find this moist rice, beans and well seasoned asada steak. 

Leaving this place stuffed for a great price. Plus the service was awesome. Hittin this spot with 5 stars. I'm widdit.",uWyOicNdRTpUf5q_xWKGUg,7,2,5,xujMB8VxOd0RbofT43WVbA

Situated in a small strip mall with an adjoining bakery is some of the yummiest mexican chow in town. There are a million little witty cliches you could use to describe what me and my buddy affectionately call, ""Mamma's.""

The dining area is small and adds to the intimacy of the meal be it lunch or dinner.  The booths are very comfortable and no matter how hot it gets outside it's always cool inside.  The staff is always friendly.  If we are sitting in within eye shot of the chief, we are sure to acknowledge him with a polite head nod and ""How are you?""

In the past I have attempted to search out items on the menu with each visit making it something new......That was until I told to forget everything and order a plate of ""Polo A La Diabla.""  Bites of chicken in a molle sauce/enchilada sauce, or so we think.  They tell us the actually recipe is a secret. The meal comes with rice, beans and tortillas.  If I may make a suggestion, order a plain quesadilla to dip or swipe the remaining sauce.

Everything is simple with that old mexican restaurant kind of feel you experienced as a kid before the Zabbas and the other commercialized mexican food restaurants came around.  I feel a true sense of sadness when the meal is over.

The Menudo was so so, I certainly have had better but it was big enough to share but no fresh tortillas.  Their chips and salsa were also uniquely different and so delicious.  The salsa had no spice (yay) but plenty of flavor and the chips were whole round tostadas freshly fried to a thin hot crisp. 3

The place is small and a little corny with their décor but the food and service make up for it!",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,3,3,4,o7yxN7yrsUYclpFlNPD4IQ

It seems to be one cook and one waitress. Same lady every time. I appreciate the hard working people. Since they are understaffed during busy times they get behind and cause a long wait. And busy could mean about 5 parties. It's a small place. Overall it's a good little Mexican place to eat at.

I always get the shrimp cocktail and my gf always gets a burrito or chimichanga and both are good.

I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a nice little Mexican restaurant. Just don't expect extra great service. The lady is a little quiet and I've had moments where she gets bothered. But I wouldn't say bad service. She's polite",oRUl_BX-l72N-3X4gNzFTA,0,0,4,soJx9P-gvra6-I95ZydvjQ

Service was slow and disjointed.  Very small place so this probably is the main reason for this.  Grabbed my own menu and sat down.

After the waitress stopped by I was served good home made salsas and chips, as well as guacamole.  Salsa had a little kick but was what I'd define as mild overall,  still very good.  Asked for some hot stuff, it never showed up.  

Ordered fajitas for my meal.  Overall not bad, spiced up with peppers, lacked any significant flavor otherwise,  plenty of vegetables.  Not overly greasy.

The tab....very small.  This place is cheap.

Overall, a small family restaurant that's not bad but nothing I'd seek out.  If I'm driving through I'd stop by again.",n1x_bwzf_eidPP5k3UkoNA,0,0,3,3brZGQSGa68K8jU7Iuehbw

It is just THAT good. I have ordered plenty of things and I will just list some of the food that I can remember.

Sizzling fajitas- I usually get the shrimp and chicken combo. It comes with the sides such as the guacamole, rice, beans, and pico de gallo with some sour cream on the plate and tortillas-- your choice of flour or corn! Then, you are served with a sizzling plate that will catch another persons eyes! It makes them want to order one, too!

Shrimp in Butter Garlic- I love shrimp and these shrimps are huge and covered in butter garlic sauce with rice on the side. All I can say is.... damn. SO DELICIOUS!

Appetizer Combo- This combo comes with chicken flautas, chicken fingers, guacamole, cheese quesadilla and plenty more all for less than $10! It will fill you up and plenty for people to share.

Burritos- Man... their burritos are HUGE! Get any style burrito.. you won't regret it! It is something you have to see AND taste for yourself.

Pretty standard, but somehow tasted better on my go-to shrimp taco plate. Flour tortillas, please! Succulent, buttery shrimp, with the cheese perfectly melted on the tortilla. No one does it this way. Pico, lettuce, add guacamole... Simple? Absolutely. And yet, nowhere makes it taste like this!

Translation: Beautiful and beloved Mexico, if I die far from you, let my last meal be here.

Seriously, that's how I felt when I had lunch here a few days ago.  And I *know* authentic, good Mexican food; I grew up in West Texas minutes from the border with Mexico, my mother is full-blooded Mexican, and I was actually born in Mexico.  

I drove across the city (literally across the city, this place is on Lake Mead and Mt Hood and I drove from Sahara and 215) just to try this place out.  Full disclosure: I went to college with the current owner (the parents are the ones that opened this place up years ago).

I'd been looking for a place that served good menudo, and I'd asked friends of mine and I was directed here.  Hmm ok, regardless if I know you or not, I am going to let you know my honest opinion on it, and if it sucks, it sucks, friendship be damned.  

It doesn't suck at all.  The menudo is so good!  It's not greasy or oily in the least, the chile is just the right level of caliente, the hominy is tender, and the tripe is clean and not-chewy.  And it's served with dried oregano, lime, chopped onions, chile flakes, and cilantro, so you can garnish at your preference.  A little oregano, a few onions, and some lime juice and my menudo was ready to go.  So, so good!  And probably would have cured any hangover.  

But I get ahead of myself.  This place is very much a hole-in-the-wall, cozy like your abuela's kitchen type place.  Maybe not your abuela but like mine for sure.  There's no pretentiousness at all, and my friend and I were welcomed to take a seat where we liked.  After being seated, drink orders were taken (just water thanks!), and then homemade chips (really they're fried tortillas that you break) and homemade red salsa (happy medium between chunky and smooth).  

So my friend is more reserved and orders the chicken taquitos as an appetizer (while I had my super-tasty menudo) which she enjoyed.  I had one with some guacomole and the guacamole was fresh.  She then ordered a chicken taco plate, which she thoroughly enjoyed, though I can't judge because I was preoccupied with my meal.

I ordered chile verde.  Super tender pork simmering in a green sauce (tomatillo base) for hours, served with a side of yellow rice and refried beans.  The sauce... so, so good.  Now the chips and salsa and the menudo had me pretty full and I was sure that I would only be able to take a few bites of the chile verde and the rest would have to go in a take-home container.  No, no, the chile verde sauce said no, you will enjoy every last tasty morsel here... and it was right. 

The server was very attentive and my water glass was never empty.  The music in the background was mariachi and norteno, so yes, it supported the authenticity.  Price-wise, unbelievably reasonable for the meal my friend and I had here.  

Now, I traveled across the city already for some tasty, authentic Mexican food, and I was not leaving without some tasty, authentic Mexican pastries.  To the panadería next door!

There is a wide assortent of pan dulce here, and I also saw Flan, Cheesecake, Tres Leches, Eclairs, and assorted cookies. There aren't any prices listed, but we decided to try a Bavarian Cream filled Empanada, Peanut Butter Polvoron, and a Puercito which all came out to $2.

They were not the best I've had, but they were okay. The selections you may find at Mariana's or Cardena's may cost a little more, but the quality is better.

The burritos are decent. I've had the giant burrito. It is indeed... giant. They serve their burritos enchilada style, meaning smothered in sauce.

I had the carnitas(~$8, on special). They were perfectly portioned and the pork portion was authentic: chunks of roasted meat/ no gross puddles of fat--Neither dry-shredded nor blank. I'm now craving a second helping of carnitas, although I have dinner plans at a certain posh strip joint. 

My friend had one of their sizzling steak dishes--she commented literally 10 times how tender it was. Service was great.

We had the green enchiladas and the mole enchiladas. Both were delicious. I've been kinda into mole for a couple months, and I thought Mama Maria's sauce stood up there with some of the best I've had. Of course it is rich, so if you like something a little fresher tasting, the green sauce was really excellent. We both commented on the quality of the meat - tender, juicy, not blobby. The enchiladas are served 3 to a plate, with sour cream, pico de gallo, rice and beans. I loved the beans - made me think about the runny beans I used to have from my friends' nana's growing up. The rice is blander and not my favorite, but then rice is never my favorite.
The chips were a pleasant surprise - whole tortilla size, like at the old Supermex (Cantina Jalisco). Light and crunchy with a flavorful salsa.
Prices were good: $13 for an iced tea and the huge enchilada plate, which could easily be split. I might like to see them add a couple lunch specials to the menu (or maybe I just missed them...).
It's kinda in the hood, but that's half the allure of Mama Maria's.
It's close to work, so I'll definitely be back for lunch, and hopefully I can drag the family up here sometime for dinner, too.

I had a lunch date with my parents today and my dad has been craving Mexican food so I thought this was the perfect opportunity to give it a try. So in my semi conscious food coma I am going to write this review the best I can. Ha! 

Its a tiny restaurant that packs a huge punch with flavors. I think I counted eight tables so if you plan to come with a larger party call in advance to make sure there is space. When I walked in the first thing  I noticed was the delicious combinations of smells. On top of the yummy Mexican spices it is also attached to a bakery so definitely stop in there afterwards. 

We were greeting by a friendly waitress who took our drink orders immediately and then promptly brought out hot crispy tortillas and salsa. The salsa was sooooo yummy. I actually took an extra order to go. 

My dad had the chile verde with corn tortillas, my mom ordered the chile relleno, and I had a cup of albondigas soup along with the enchiladas verdes.  Everything was amazing! Both my parents cleaned the plate! I have honestly never seen them do that before haha! The sauce on my enchiladas was so tasty and it was packed with moist perfectly spiced chicken. I took multiple bites of my parents food and it was just as good. We all liked it so much we plan to come back here very soon. 

Not only was it delicious but it's easy on the wallet. Our bill was only $42 and that included beer and soft drinks. That's pretty good for 3 people.

It was flavorful without having to be spicy.  You could tell it was fresh because the diced up onions were still crisp and the cilantro was nice and green.  

We ordered the Tampiquena, which was recommended by our server, and the Spicy Devil Chicken.  The Tampiquena was great!  A perfectly marinated flap steak with enchilada, beans, rice, salsa, and guacamole.  The Spicy Devil Chicken was alright.  It was a little too salty for my taste, but I asked for a side of crema and that was able to fix it.

Inside this small restaurant sits about 40 people. Seating is open to your preference. Booths are comfy, but limited leg space (tall people problems). The noise level is always calm since it's never packed. Sit on the left side if you want to watch some Tele'Mundo Lol.
Decorations consist of paintings on walls and some hanging Latin streamers.

As far as the 4 page menu goes, everything is under $15, there's a wide variety to choose from, and all are very filling. The Fajitas with your choice of any meat always comes out packed with a ton of flavor. I get the shrimp and they never fail to impress this picky gut. Enchilada Style Burritos and Chimichangas are huge! The weird part is, they are the cheapest entrees on the menu too. They do not charge extra if you substitute for steak, only on the shrimp.
Food doesn't take but 10 minutes to come out, but while you wait, freshly made delicious tortilla chips and salsa are brought out to keep you happy. To tell you the truth, its the biggest reason I keep coming back. :D
After dining in, make sure to stop by next door to their linked bakery for some fresh pastries to take home. So worth your money.

4484291,2010-04-15,0,tstimHoMcYbkSC4eBA1wEg,"If you are willing to drive distances to try out a great hole in the wall, then put Mama Maria's on your list of places to try. Someone told me about this place a few weeks ago and have been wanting to go since. We finally made the trip way out to the Northeast and were rewarded with fantastic food, reasonable prices, and friendly service. 

After debating between several items, we decided to order the chile verde, enchiladas verdes, and a chile relleno a la carte. The chile verde ($8.50) consisted of tender pieces of slow cooked pork bathed in a tangy tomatillo sauce, and was served with a side of fluffy rice and refried beans that tasted identical to those we had at a little lobster village in Mexico. The pork was fork tender and I loved the large meaty chunks, but I would have preferred it to have a few more hot chiles. The chile relleno ($5.50 a la carte) was also worth the trip and we even thought it was better than that of Vega's cafe, which previously held our number one spot for this dish. Rather than a white sauce, this was served with a perfectly executed red tomato-based sauce. The batter was thicker and had a good amount of egg, and there wasn't a superfluous amount of cheese in the center. The combination of these two factors pleased me because it resulted in more protein, less fat, and a more interesting flavor combination. It just felt like a more balanced dish than the other chile rellenos I've had. The enchiladas verdes ($8.99) were the least impressive dish, but still better than enchiladas at most other restaurants. I appreciated how the green sauce for these was different than the chile verde sauce used for the pork, because it showed me that each dish is thought of independently. My husband commented on the skill used to prepare the sauces here as they weren't broken (culinary term meaning the fat and acids haven't separated from one another), and I agreed. Even though the food here could be equated with awesome home cooking, the skill level necessary to prepare each of these is probably underrated in the eyes of the consumer. I really wanted the tres leches cake since that is on my top five list of favorite desserts (the best I've had is at Cuba Cuba in Richmond, VA), but sadly they were out so we settled for the flan ($2.50). This turned out not to be sad at all, because despite the weird presentation with plastic covered toothpicks, the flan itself was creamy and the caramelized sugar syrup was toasty and rich. Plus, it was the perfect size. If you don't want to try the desserts here, however, you can go to the shop next door to get homemade ice creams and popsicles, which are also inexpensive.

Though I've only been once, it seems like the food here would be fairly consistent since it's run by a couple from Guadalajara who manage the restaurant and do all the cooking, just like at Vega's cafe. Adding to the charm is the old fashioned diner wheel system for reading restaurant tickets, a refreshing sight in a country whose restaurants are filled with P.O.S (point of sale) systems. Plus, it's always great to support a Mom and Pop kind of place!",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,4,5,4,ubViMQvYfNAKsaAX-Hh-Mg

I picked up some tacos to take out on the other side of the business.  I was less excited about those.  The tortillas were odd, and the tacos as a whole were pretty bland.  Dry meat with a few toppings.

I wouldn't quite call Maria's a ""hole in the wall"", but it is a very small Mexican restaurant with some of the best authentic food in town. The attached bakers is also extremely good with low prices.

I came here the first time a few years ago after a friend told me that his daughter, who had moved out of Las Vegas, comes here every time she returns to Vegas to visit. I was hooked from the very first meal. I grew up eating Mexican food in Southern California, and though there are a lot of good restaurants in Las Vegas, Maria's stands above most of them.

I don't know where to start on the food, as we've never had anything bad here. Everyone we have ever taken here or brought with us loves the food here. The surf and turf burrito (carne asada and shrimp) is just phenomenal. The steak is fantastic, the shrimp is seasoned perfectly, the burrito is huge, and it's served wet with a perfect enchilada sauce and melted cheese. I honestly don't think there is anyway for this burrito to get better.

The combo meals are very good to. Choose from enchiladas, tacos, mini-burritos, chili rellenos, etc... You honestly cant go wrong no matter what you order. They have a combo meal that comes with carne asada, an enchilada, a chimichanga and a chili relleno for $18. It's a massive meal and enough for two people to share, and everything is high quality.

The restaurant is very small, with only about a dozen tables and only one server working. Despite how good this place is, it never seems to be packed, so we always get very good service.

The Bakery is right next door to the dining area. The Mexican pastries are very good, and they are dirt cheap. I love their pineapple pastries and macaroons in particular, though most of the other items are good to. The only thing I really don't care for is their cookies, which are very large but crumbly and dry. If you like dryer cookies (and some people do, my wife always gets a peanut butter cookie every time we are here) then you will probably love these. Nothing wrong with their flavor, but I'll take moist and chewy cookies over crumbly and dry any day.

In my opinion, this place is a hidden gem that is well worth trying. If you are a fan of Mexican food, then I would try to make it here some day.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,2,2,5,nd6_6FmPDBNyu-Z7DrtMSA

Great service over the phone, but it felt odd when I went in to pick it up, like people don't normally do that or something.

I was impressed with the size and the ingredients. I also loved how they packaged everything up so well.  I feel the food was inviting, and I would order to go again, and also stop in to eat if I was in the area.

First of all, the complimentary fried tortillas and homemade salsa they bring out before your food comes are delicious. The tortillas are warm & crisp to perfection. I really like chunks of tomato & chopped vegetables & herbs. 

The fiesta plate was a yummy foreshadow to how great the rest of the food was going to be. I was pretty much full after it (although it was only split between my guy & me).

The beans and rice here are fab.  I got the tampiquena.  The steak was tender and well-seasoned.  I was impressed with the cheese enchilada - I normally find enchiladas (especially cheese ones) really boring, but this one wasn't.  It was flavorful and gooey.

Two orders of chili verde, one tampequena, one enchiladas verde and last but not least, wings and fries for T. Oh, and a large order of guac to share. The tostadas and salsa were good, I liked that they were thin like tortilla chips. The guac was ok. I like mine to be a bit on the chunky side. This one was more smooth but still had good flavor. We usually finish the bowl but didn't here. Our food arrived shortly after and it looked great. I asked for no sour cream or cheese and corn tortillas with my chili verde and it arrived with cheese and zero tortillas. The other order of chili verde didn't receive the flour tortillas either. I made due and ate around the cheese- the beans and rice were delicious, as was the chili verde. It had awesome flavor and spice. The fries and wings were sub-par but it's not really a place known for that, so I let it slide a bit. The enchiladas verde and tampequena got great reviews from the others.

Located near North Las Vegas out near Nellis Air Force Base since the late 2000s, a family run place that has recently rebranded from ""Mama Maria's Mexican Restaurant and Panaderia"" to ""Maria's Mexican Restaurant, Bakery and Catering,"" though signage facing East Lake Mead Boulevard still bears the old name, it was prior to a Graduation Party that our group of three stopped in for what was hoped to be some well-made Southwestern cuisine at a good price, the subsequent hour and forty-five minutes instead spent mostly sitting in wait as two servers meandered around the room somewhat aimlessly.

Known best of all for their Giant Burritos and Nachos, neither particularly rare amongst local Mexican eateries but here said to be bigger and better than most, it was just past 5:00 that two adults and one child entered the combined Restaurant/Carry-Out and Bakery tucked into a small Shopping complex, an invitation to seat ourselves suggested from a woman in back as only two other families were present, a family of four soon to settle the bill and thus leaving only five patrons present for the duration of the visit.

Eventually electing a rounded booth set against a pony-wall diving restaurant from store, the kitchen window in full view along with a few murals of Mexico as Latin music chimed above, it was with menus in hand that two pages of Food plus one of Drinks was quickly navigated as a plate of sizzling Fajitas was brought to a middle-age Caucasian couple across the way, the server not even making eye contact as she walked, nor as she returned to the register where she proceeded to clean the cash register CPU with a disposable cloth.

Eventually offered water by the 'hostess,' a bowl of warm Corn Tortillas and Chunky Salsa without much heat soon to follow, it was with phrasing something along the lines of ""the waitress will be back to take your order"" that this woman disappeared to the back, the 'server' continuing to pay no mind to anything but her task at hand and not once acknowledging the dining room until twenty minute later, when she walked by to check on the other table and was alerted by a rather loud clearing of the throat.

Having twice now debated getting up to leave, or at least to visit the Bakery for some snacks on the way out, it was again with a delay that diners awaited the young woman's return with a pen to jot down an order consisting of two plates and one drink to be shared, the $4 Frozen Margarita with quite a bit of booze admittedly a great deal in a portion that would typically cost guests closer to $15 on The Strip.

Not really needing much guidance on such a straightforward menu, the kitchen moving slower than one would guess given the low volume but clearly visible making all but the pre-breaded Tenders from scratch, it was perhaps twenty more minutes before two large plates of food would arrive including the Sample Platter highlighted by tightly rolled Chicken Taquitos plus Nachos, Quesadillas and Chicken Fingers that even the most novice college student could make at home, the Burrito bigger and thicker than a 9-year old's arm a far better choice at just $10.95, the enormous Flour Tortilla stuffed with fragrant Rice, Refried Beans, roast Pork and Pico de Gallo beneath melted shreds of Cheese and a peppery Red Sauce.

Impressed by the moist Meat in the Burrito, though others might opt for Carne Asada, Chicken, Roast Peppers or ground Beef, it was with both plates mostly cleared and a sample of thin, spicy 'Mole' tasted that the check was requested not once or twice but three times, the decision at this point made to visit the Bakery next door where a variety of perhaps two-dozen items were offered from an on-site kitchen, the Guava Besos soft and fluffy with sweetness mellowed by Coconut while the Butter Cookies and Turnovers were both fair-to-middling, a far better option available in a Sprinkled Cake wedge that at first looked a little dry but proved to be both soft and not too sugary, the whole to-go Box costing just $3.85.

** No doubt an affordable dining option with Food that is middle-of-the-road Mexican save for the Giant Burrito, Maria's Mexican Restaurant, Bakery and Catering would be difficult to recommend for anyone save for those who live in the area and have a lot of time to waste, though the pickings are admittedly slim in this part of Las Vegas.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,6,2,KP71ESBK9MEm_DbBJmDpEw

5661229,2014-03-08,2,tstimHoMcYbkSC4eBA1wEg,"Mama Maria's Mexican restaurant was a fun place for me to try because it's decently close to where I live. My family and I ordered for takeout, which was very convenient. One thing to note is that we participate in the season of Lent, so we had to avoid beef and poultry. Seafood and eggs are fine for us to have eaten.

I commend this restaurant on really good service. They had a busy restaurant, but were able to have our takeout order ready on time and neatly packed, which was much appreciated.

We ordered guacamole, Chilles Relleno, garlic butter shrimp, shrimp fajitas, and crispy shrimp tacos.

Our order came with chips and salsa! Like everybody has pointed out, the chips come in the form of freshly fried tortillas that you break into tinier pieces. The salsa was delicious! The tomato sauce in it interestingly had a ""pasta sauce"" flavor, which for me, set it apart from any other Mexican salsa I've ever tried. They sent us home with a bunch too, so I was very happy!

We also ate the chips with the guacamole we ordered. It was good and fresh guac, but it seemed plain for my taste.

We didn't care for the shrimp fajitas or the butter garlic shrimp too much, not very special. The crispy shrimp tacos were a big bust in my opinion because I expected deep fried, breaded shrimp and I thought that was what the menu meant when they said ""crispy"", but apparently that description was only referring to the taco shell, which I cancelled out when I asked to have my tacos wrapped in a flour tortilla instead. Furthermore, nothing had sour cream or crema, which was odd to me. I guess I just didn't realize I had to order it separately.

The Chilles Relleno was SUPERB. My dad and I were so impressed by how tasty this dish came out! If you ever visit this restaurant, that is certainly the dish to try. It was spongy from the egg, but also satisfyingly saucy at the same time. There was a lot of good flavor to it, too. The portion size was another thing I was happy with also.

Overall, I wouldn't look forward to ordering anything but the Chilles Relleno. That's the thing to try, hands down.",zI0cogkqx4WQArqzTHXd-Q,3,2,3,ghCsz7dQudLp0p9irnkKUQ

Mins. Food was good but when I walked to use the restroom in the back, I saw the cook spit into what I hope was the sink? Pretty gross habit especially while you are cooking for others .",Hz23low3fSkDXXDY5yCBdw,0,0,3,WgxOOYHs054xTFvc2EhTSw

There was only one server taking care of the entire restaurant. Ordered water but it never came. Girlfriend ordered a chili relleno and it was excellent.  I had the shrimp tacos. The plate was just covered with lettuce and tomatoes but once I got my bearings this too was delicious. Rice and beans were ok but the guacamole was delicious too and a very generous portion I might add. When the check finally came we found we were overcharged. There was a discrepancy in the price presented on the menu and the price that was on our ticket for the plate we ordered. I don't think that is ever happened to me ever at a restaurant before but since it was a small discrepancy we paid and left. If this establishment would step it up on the service and honor prices on their menu it is well worth the trip. One last thing before I go, we looked at the menu online and the menu in the restaurant did not have the same items, little weird.",es2AvEZhQmiaLb29_vzccA,0,0,3,AyBfogMNFH9UNnE2I3mk6Q

I received very bad service from her before but because the food here is decent I figured I would give her another chance and thought that she just had a bad day. Upon walking in, I sit down and she takes my order and does not even ask me if I want anything to drink (let alone even offer the option for chips and salsa). She immediately sits down and gets on her phone and starts chatting and laughing and I asked her if I can get some water along with having the free salsa and chips that is normally offered. She told me that they charged for the second round of chips and salsa and the first one is free if you eat in the restaurant. She assumed that I was going to take the food to go which puzzled me as to why she never even asked in the first place whether or not I was going to take the food and immediately took it upon herself to charge me. Already feeling irritated with her service, I asked for her manager and she gave me the name of her manager along with the days that he worked. She also stated her name to me in a very rude way and then turned around to complete what she was doing in the kitchen along with canceling my order.

The reason why I come to this place is because the food is good and they're close to my area of residence yet because of that, it still does not give anyone a reason to treat their customers with a lack of service. I've spoken to the manager before and he seems like a very nice guy who would rectify the situation but I'm just hoping that in the future management would be more aware of how  their waitresses treat their customers. 

Being in Las Vegas there are SO many Mexican restaurants in the city I believe it would behoove any Mexican restaurant owner or business to make sure that they are a cut above the rest due to the high competition. 

The only reason why I gave them two stars is because the food is decent, although the last time when she brought the chips out they were oily and cold. I asked Ms Gloria to reheat them and this is where the attitude started with me. I've been eating there in the past two years and never have I had any issues with the service. 

In this case, Ms. Gloria you really left a bad taste in my mouth and I don't think I'll be coming back to this restaurant anytime soon!",nY9FUScv1oLEo-XNjOcr4g,5,1,2,-b1DH6V-whCHOzbQP2dIRA

We ordered the tampaqino because of the reviews. Very moist and tender. Steak fajitas were also tender and come piled high with a lot of left overs. Delicious!! Everyone should try it out.",xS_lRWl0akQKG_POARa3Jw,1,0,5,H82O2SqXH_I_WR0qFmy5_w
