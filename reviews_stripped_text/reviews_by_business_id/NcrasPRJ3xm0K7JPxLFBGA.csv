I have tried going at different times and it always takes a minimum of 20 minutes to get my order. If I pull up and there is more than one car in line I leave. Tonight I ordered a King Caesar wrap with no tomatoes and when I got back to work to eat it was filled with tomatoes.  I didn't have time to take it back because it took 40 minutes the first trip. I have given them several chances hoping things have improved when I've gone back but after today I won't be going back.",5zwQTruKGAQS56hbL2RFKA,1,0,1,0vRY6eGXjXfDvMvEa2D8DQ

465679,2015-02-11,0,NcrasPRJ3xm0K7JPxLFBGA,This location is absolutely awful. I love tropical smoothie and this is the only one close to where I work. We have ordered lunch for our staff a few times and called the order in half and hour in advance each time. However each time we went to pick it up the orders were not complete and not correct. The same two girls were working each time and were not even a little apologetic about the orders. It took them another 20 minutes to get us the correct food and drinks and by then half the smoothies were melted. In addition..they make the absolute worst smoothie j have ever had. I ordered my usual blue lagoon and there was so much ice you couldn't even taste any of the fruit and it wasn't even blended all the way I had to chew the damn thing. Disgusting.

I was glad something opened up on the east side that is somewhat on my way to work (catching the 95). But the drivethru window is painfully slow. Even when ordering just a smoothie and I'm the only one there, its so sloooow. 

I usually only go to TSC when I get text alert about a special discount or free smoothie. Any time I come to this location they are almost always caught off guard by the promotion. There have been times when I've ordered food off the menu and the person taking my order wasn't even aware it was on the menu.

Today I got one of the new ""savory island club"" with kale and apple slaw, sounds awesome right? It was toasted to rock hard status. I couldn't even finish it, I was afraid I'd shred by gums.

Reason for lowering the review a couple stars: I stood at the counter for about five minutes without even being acknowledged. The lady looked at me and quickly away. No ""hi,"" no ""I'll be right with you."" Nothing! That was a little frustrating. Then, as I was standing there waiting, some guy in the back yells at the top of his lungs, ""What the h*## is wrong with you?"" to the lady that was making smoothies.

I understand the lunch hour rush gets busy, but I was the first one to put my order in and quite literally the last one to get my full meal. After seeing a bunch of people that came in after I did get their entire meal and leave, I asked the lady in the front to check on my smoothie - to which she confidently replied ""it should be right out"".  When she rushed into the back, I thought maybe she's gone to check on it.  Nope.  She comes back out to the register to help a bunch of other people order.  THEY get their food too!  Finally I go up to ask her again on the status and she says ""I'll take care of it"" and finally starts making my smoothie.

4355721,2016-03-06,4,NcrasPRJ3xm0K7JPxLFBGA,Annoying!  I have considered all day why it takes 30 minutes to make a smoothie?   I am annoyed. I just think if they added one more person it would improve the customer experience.  Whoever owns this location should have someone they know go to the location. You could actually double or triple income if it were managed well.  Two smoothies an hour would pay wages for one extra person but create opportunities to make way more revenue.  I am probably spending too much time on this but it pisses me off. Why would waste the money keeping the place open if you are not going to run it well.  It's the only smoothie place in the area and right across the street from several county and state offices.  It's on a busy street and next two other fast food places.  Get it together. Seriously bring in people from other stores.  Just one extra body at less than $60 a day would absolutely improve the situation.  Now that I think about it how many other corners are being cut.  When one out of several locations is rated so badly you would think they would fix it. Ask the other locations what they are doing to perform. If you cannot get quality people then pay more. 30 minutes for two smoothies!!!!   Come on!!! I am officially angry and it's been 11 hours.

I went on April 25, and I think it had just opened the day before or something like that.  It was crowded (see the aforementioned excitement at this place opening near family court) but well staffed.  I think they were still working out some bugs as everyone ordered PRETTY MUCH the same thing yet the prices were ALL OVER THE BOARD, but I do think they will get this worked out.  The food was good, the smoothies were great, and I am hopeful the service will follow!!",m96igVtonhN98jfF63lr8Q,0,1,4,EvK7KAGox8_xUIzl7Yv7Nw

4607180,2017-08-26,0,NcrasPRJ3xm0K7JPxLFBGA,"So I decide to get a smoothie through the drive-thru, I seen a car at the window and one that just placed an order with 4 passengers. So I thought to myself ""this place kinda takes their sweet time with the smoothies as it is, now they're really going to be long"" so I decided to park and walk in. Inside there was a couple waiting for their food, a gentleman at the counter and another couple waiting for their food with their child. The customer infront of me seemed to be waiting to order for about 5 min, none of the employees seemed to have acknowledged him. Then an employee who seemed to come out the restroom walked past us not saying a word or anything like ""one moment, someone will be with you, I apologize for the wait"" nothing she seemed to clock out and leave. I continued to wait more then 5 min so the customer infront of me has been there way longer than me, at thus point we had both become irritated with the wait. We finally get helped no apologies for the shift leader or the lady left in charge. While we waited the the couple without the kid received their food, they ended up return it due to it being wrong. A small family or 3 walk in and place a food & smoothie order, at this point I've been waiting for my smoothie for about 10min. Then some how the family of 3 end up getting their food before me and the customer before me, I then asked the gentleman how long has it been since he had ordered his 1 smoothie and he said ""about 20min."" So i decided to try and cancel my order as it was taking TOO LONG, I tried to get someone's attention but got distracted with the family of 3 who came back in due to their fruit being rotten & they forgot to give them their smoothies. The shift leader ended up giving them chips only because the young lady customer asked her to give her something. Before I could cancel my order the shift leader had brought my 1 SMOOTHIE that took longer than 20 min to make, she didn't even say sorry it took so long here's some chips or hey 5% discount on a future smoothie nothing, so I asked for the manager and she said they had left for the day. I then asked the shift leader for her corporate office number and she said I had to go online and find it, I had no choice but to take my already made smoothie and leave. I dont know what needs to be done to this establishment in regards to customer service but they need to fix it, because it's not running well at all.",trNCiElDl9BaAFaXbJ8Jhg,0,0,1,RrKSwYofiey7Bl0vWilmJQ

4615393,2015-02-12,0,NcrasPRJ3xm0K7JPxLFBGA,Tropical smoothie is my favorite quick healthy spot. Sad to say this is the worst location in Las Vegas. Customer service is not up to par. Seems like the employees can care less about the quality of the food. Been served a smoothie only 80% full and a already opened bag of chips. They've mixed up my order a few times. Seems like a managing issue. I would love to see this place improve.,VHi9u6V9jYAsk4GH_gP_ew,0,0,1,N50b0MU8v2AqWNAeYeKKEg

I seriously repeated my order 6-7 times to her and when I got to the window I asked for a large ice water because it's 116 degrees and she gave me a small cup, HALF WAY FILLED WITH NO ICE!

The times I've been here I go to the drive-thru. It's literally a 10 min wait or sometimes more. The team needs better management and training on working faster.

Idon't care if the service is bad as long as my food is EDIBLE and taste the way it should. I was happy when this one open on this side of town because the food was good but now they are falling off they need to teach they're employees to cook it right and good all the time.
This place food is inconsistent and a waste of money and time. 

I called about an order of mine that i wasn't happy about. (this is the second time in a row) But it was the team leader that made my thai tacos  and it was the worst thai taco I've ever had. If your team leaders aren't making them right  WTH !! She did say i can come back and get a refund. 

HIRE NEW WORKERS AND TEACH THEM TO MAKE CONSISTENT GREAT FOOD THAT WE'RE USED TOO, IF IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD TO EAT THEN THROW IT OUT ! DONT GIVE IT TO CUSTOMERS.  

P.S. I have never wrote about a bad experience, but i just hate wasting money on food with inconsistency. 

please fix this problem and micro manage these people.",hr9a1Jml2q1bYI068b77ig,2,0,1,A-pJDk83ZtCC3ZanyqhyKw

I have used the drive-thru twice and both times I have had to wait 15+ minutes. The first time I went, the person taking orders was having trouble hearing what I was saying through the speaker and apparently was having trouble recording orders because my order seemed to be too confusing to be served correctly. The second time, there was only one person managing the drive-thru and the front - ONE person.

I'm the only one in there. She takes my order and cash then leaves the register open and goes to the back. I guess to keep messing with the oven. She comes back hands me my drink and receipt and never my change. I tell her can I have my change she said I already gave it to you. I said no sorry but you didn't you just handed me my receipt. She argued backs and forth...I walked out told her to keep the change to fix her broken oven.
