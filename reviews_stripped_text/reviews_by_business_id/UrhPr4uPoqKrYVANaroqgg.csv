When I got home there was a small cup of pico de gallo not chili.  Additionally the black beans were nothing but paste.  Furthermore, they never answer the phone number provided by google search.

172726,2017-05-05,0,UrhPr4uPoqKrYVANaroqgg,I had the best customer service today by a girl named Taylor. She was so pleasant and cheerful. I went through the drive thru and ordered. When I drove up she handed me my order and said have a great day and please come back and see us. I've been coming here for years and never got acknowledged like that before. She was great.,iBbIogP9iAp8oepLEnRfwA,0,0,5,i6xcz6X0ZK0US1uNgw0W4Q

1711775,2016-01-30,0,UrhPr4uPoqKrYVANaroqgg,"I can't tell you how many times I've donated unintentionally to this place from them over charging me on the side of potatoes, by charging me an extra $1 for fiesta potatoes. A side of potatoes is 50 cents, and fiesta potatoes with sour cream and cheese is $1.49. These people continue to over charge by registering it as fiesta potatoes and then removing the sour cream and cheese, but I am still getting charged $1.49 instead of 50 cents. My husband likes their potatoes so I end up donating them a dollar from their stupidity about 10 times a month! I'm not even exaggerating either, we frequent this location quite often. Today took the cake when it comes to common sense. They charged me once again for fiesta potatoes without removing sour cream and cheese, I said that is fine leave it and add a side of potatoes. So I end up paying $2 for one 50 cent side of potatoes! Where is the fiesta potatoes you also charged me for? I said leave it, not as in leave it out of my bag but charge me for it.",aiSMCaIQzyLgJu7xXHfuoA,1,0,2,nh6kbwixWRGkKcOYVCAljg

Just wanted to write something about the cashier Dylan who helped us. He was super friendly and had the biggest smile on his face. We dined in tonight and we heard him greet everyone who walked in with a friendly demeanor. Unfortunately, This is not my typical experience at a fast food establishment. 

I've been here one other time and he happen to be the one who helped us. He stood out then too. He's definitely a model employee. 

Nice job Dylan! You'll go far!",DBfgUKhAzSri9GKPZkcBtw,2,1,5,r1K9Sl67cnqPveZJuZc4pA
2399286,2017-12-07,0,UrhPr4uPoqKrYVANaroqgg,"Just wentto drive thru and bought $28.81 worth of food.  Got home and found my Nachos Bel Grande was not in the ONE BAG they stuffed everything into.  I tried to call and complain but the phone was not answered.  I tried 3 times. So I drove back and gave the guy my receipt and told him what was missing. He said ""Let me get that for you"" a few minutes later he came back and handed me a bag.  Now everone makes mistakes.. sure I was the only customer there and it shouldn't be that hard to look at an order, make it and bag it... especially if tahts what you do all day.. but the problem for me was that I had spent my time ans gas while my food got cold at home and he never even said ""sorry"".. no offer of anything to make up for it.. nothing other than giving me the food that I paid for and shouldn't have had to come back for.  So I told him that it was bullshit that he didn't even say sorry and he sai ""I did"" I told him no you said let me get that for you and told him taht I wasted tie and gas ti come back.. he said ""oh well you can call and tel my general manager!"" Really?  Oh I will and I just finished the Tell The Bell Survey.. I worked fast food before.. I did 23 years behind a deli counter at a grocery store.. I know how a customer should be treated.. this was the opposite of that...  so I go home and start to eat my cold food and it is horrible. not from being cold but from how they made it.. the bean and cheese burrito was timy, smashed and had almost no cheese.  The mexican pizza my wife got was thrown together, ingredients everwhere except where they should be. The pintos and cheese were the worst.. The beans were so dry they crunched.  Probably the worst food I heve ever had from a taco bell.. maybe from any fast food place ever!  So now tomorrow I will be calling to complain to whoever will listen at the store and at the corporate office.  I highly reccomend avoiding this location.",VCCvYbQ1-mkUSTRGuG2xSQ,0,0,1,9DSbx-NjdrW5IIpIZmiv5w

I ordered a Mexican Pizza....havent head for over a year...again, without refried beans and sour cream. I was asked ""no sour cream or beans"" and I agreed. The menu was correct.

This Taco Bell has great customer service. The employees work really hard to get your food out to you in a timely manner. I get out of here so quick via drive-thru that I don't even remember paying sometimes.

I always order off of their value menu. The Frutista Freeze slushies taste really, really good.

The girls love the cheese rolls and the chicken burrito and I second that, so we can literally eat for four for like eight bucks, really?? I know it can not be good for us but well worth it on occasion.  

Most importantly, what we always notice is how great the employees are.  Always happy and ready to help you out! That is awesome! 

Has anyone else noticed how small Taco Bells little sauce packets have gotten though? I always have to ask for extras because they just do not have the coverage they use to. Again thank you to the employees for always giving me a large hand full of extra packets! You guys rock!",JaM9f-6k15f82tGGS05LOw,0,0,5,NmbcO5WYhkezT7pvpkIhmA

This location always has fresh ingredients and always has quick, accurate service.  It's nestled between Sun City Summerlin (which is a retirement community) and the original Summerlin, which is a little over 20 yrs old.....so there's rarely a long line or wait here.

Hands me my Pepsi, with the lid not on all the way, Pepsi leaking down the side. I got home, instead of my chalupa meal for my husband, I got some kind of burrito that is now dog food. I think it's a joke that people were protesting that fast food workers should get $15/hr. Do you think that person deserves that kind of pay?

4043116,2017-07-11,0,UrhPr4uPoqKrYVANaroqgg,The food was great.  The young man that served us was great also.   I was in there two days ago.   My complaint is with the manager that was on duty that day.  Her name was Maria or Latina.  Anyways there was a very stuck up rude customer that was upset that she was told the senior age was 60 and she was only 55.  This was over a senior drink.   She was being pure evil to the young man at the counter and would not stop.   He was being very polite back.   After about 5 minutes of her just bullying the employee the manager Maria or Tina or Latina whatever her name was came out and listened to the lady.  At first I thought she would calm her down and say I know I am sorry you feel that way I will handle it.  Here's a free drink or something.  But no instead she brought the young man out and insisted that he apologize to this ignorant lady.  The lady was making fun of how he was acting and everything. The manager actually was agreeing with her which was so wrong.  I finally stood up because it was so humiliating for this young man and the manager was handling it horrible.  She was belittling her own employee who did nothing wrong.   The restaurant was full of people.  So my complaint is that manager should be addressed with her treatment of her employee.  No human should of ever been treated that way in front of a customer.  I finally walked up and said something and the stupid mean lady finally left and told the manager she was horrible for embarrassing the employee she walked off of course.  I felt so bad for the employ.   He was bullied by the manager and the employee.,AbKFny-FljWVewd9fmcPvQ,0,0,1,tQxy44wB_-nZTdw7Z3Thig

The people behind the counter have always been polite and helpful and the food has always  been hot and tasty. One time the Dr. Pepper tasted like water, but when I mentioned it, the server re-filled the machine, then brought me a super-large cup filled with soda. That was really nice of her. We love this Taco Bell! One suggestion: This store really needs a remodel, as it really feels dated, faded and old... but the quality of food and service, still outweighs that issue.",yhjwkclgQoWMqxISoVQy_Q,0,0,5,xpF2GNt9aXc9N4fjtKfX2w

We live closer to another location, but have chosen to drive a bit further to this location because they always used to get our food right and have great customer service. Unfortunately, the last 4 visits have been bad. At least two items missing, food made wrong etc. As an avid Taco Bell eater, I know you have to check the bag before you drive away. But sometimes the bag is so full you think you counted correctly. It's really frustrating when you get home and are missing food you paid for. We usually don't go back and just take the loss. But it's getting ridiculous. Tonight, I ordered a chicken soft taco. They basically forgot the chicken. See the pic. What kind of business allows this? It's not hard to make tacos, y'all. I've worked fast food as a teenager and it's not rocket science. Anyway, based on the other bad reviews, I'm clearly not the only unhappy customer.

When we didn't pull up to the window as fast as he wanted us to, he leaned out of the window, shook his arms at us and shut the window (we were driving a normal speed through the drive-thru).  When we got to the window, he screwed up the order and shut the window on us. So my husband went inside to speak to a manager, and the kid at the drive-thru literally ran away and hid.
