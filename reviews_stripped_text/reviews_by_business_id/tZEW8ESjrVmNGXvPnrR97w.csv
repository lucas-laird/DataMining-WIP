I find this uniqueness refreshing especially with all the different crawfish joints in town it really helps them stand out. Prices here are also very comparable to competitors around town. 

My only criticism to this place is this the service is a little lack luster. They are friendly and helpful when asked. But they are not very tentative, even though the last couple times ive been there we were the only table present. If they were a little more proactive as opposed to reactive it would make this place excellent.",C6WmxsEbY3E-U3U93FDGVg,2,1,4,yoY2P5-w6OqblkGckKkeVQ
381865,2014-04-28,0,tZEW8ESjrVmNGXvPnrR97w,Its a new restaurant right off the strip located in the heart of chinatown. The place does seafood but instead of a cajun twist its different in that it has a unique chinese fusion. The lamb or beef skewers are very good and the rinse meat hot pot sticks are definitely worth trying. Best thing is theyre open until 2am for those late night cravings.

Did not care for the sate sticks much but decided we liked the place enough to come back.  Got another Groupon offer and tried it out (more sober this time) and ordered the same shrimp, chicken wings and an order of king crab.  They brought us a regular crab order which looked liked the remains of someone else's order after they were done with it.  We told them this was not king crab and they regretfully apologized and said they had a new cook.  They returned with our king crab but it was not any better.  Had only a few pieces and not anything like the king crab order at Hot and Juicy Crawfish that served decent pieces of legs and claw.  The shrimp was not fresh and had a hard time peeling it which to me is a sign that it was not fresh.  

All this and we had to watch a video of Chinese propaganda played over and over again.",3vzWZZ9cMEnO9kUSdgWZvQ,0,0,2,S8XvCZJvsDs1rG28CZ2f0w

It has really authentic skewers which really remind me of BBQ in China. My favorite are the lamb skewers, but I liked the chicken and beef too. We got some mild and some spicy. The spicy ones were pretty spicy for me, but my husband said they were perfect! We also had the pot of shrimp and corn - YUM! You even get gloves to so there is no messy clean up after the peel-yourself shrimp. 

On our second visit we got the combination ""rinse meat string."" We had tofu, mushrooms, fish balls and some other kind of fish. They are amazing! I couldn't stop eating it. I would definitely get these again! I also love the plum juice which is tart and cold...perfect to cool the spice! We also had kids with us who loved the sweet potato fries! We got the VIP card and used it to save a bunch on our second visit. 

Overall, I will be back because:

1380623,2014-03-10,1,tZEW8ESjrVmNGXvPnrR97w,"Came here for the first time for ""dinner"" (finally...) Been wanting to try it since i first heard about it. 

SUPER easy to spot at night. If you are coming in from Spring Mountain, its the huge brightly lit Shrimp at the end of the plaza. XD 

Decor - very interesting, unique design. they have particular tastes, that may be quite different from others XD 

After hearing about their hot pot combo AND their skewers... THATS GOTTA BE what we will try ! 

Lamb Sticks - $5.95 for 8 skewers - We tried the spicy and the medium. Spicy was first. Meat was kind of small. Flavor wise, DELICIOUS ! Spicy and flavorful. Cumin, pepper, and i believe lemon grass as well? Yummy ! Priced good too ! Medium level was actually a bit disappointing. It was quite the huge gap in spice level between medium and spicy. You can call the spicy, on a scale of 1-10, maybe an 8. Medium, 3-4. It wasn't spicy. It was actually sweet to me. Doriee had called it teriyaki lamb. XD 

Beef Sticks - $4.95 for 8 skewers - Spicy level as well. Same seasoning as the lamb skewers. Was a little awkward because usually the cumin spice is used for lamb. Was still good. Spicy like the spicy lamb too. Meat amount was more than then lamb. 

Hot Pot Combo - $11.95 for 20 sticks with up to 4 different items - We had ordered shrimp, fried tofu, king oyster mushroom, and beef tendon balls. 

Shrimp - Cooked perfectly. Kind of flavorless. Some people had called this place the sichuan hot n juicy. No where near it. None of the sauce stuck. Even peeling the shell and dipping back into sauce didnt help. The Hot Pot ""soup"" is too thin for that application. 

King Oyster Mushroom - Good texture as this mushroom known to be. Slides OFF the skewer very easily... so you'll have to go caveman spear pokin for it later or just use two skewers and go chopsticks style. 

Beef Tendon Balls - Cut into maybe 1/8 slivers ? Holds the soup flavor pretty well. Seemed to have nicely absorbed into the slivers. 

Fried Tofu - Lol. I had called this ""the item to screw thy self with""... Fried tofu tends to be VERY porous and is KNOWN to soak up ANYTHING you put it in thats liquid. Spicy hot pot soup and a sponge of a tofu? Yep... XD Holds a LOT of soup in each piece. Tends to dribble down your chin too so be CAREFUL to not get it on yourself and be VERY careful cuz it will ""explode"" when you bite into it :P 

Overall, the lamb skewers were delicious. Beef was ok. Hot pot combo, im pretty sure the soup base is the same one i use for hot pot at home ... Lol flavor was VERY VERY similar... XD Not bad overall. would come back for the lamb skewers alone.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,5,1,4,BLXv83A63rzM1upj6Ema9Q
1503546,2014-05-11,1,tZEW8ESjrVmNGXvPnrR97w,"Underwhelming. Came for a UYE with my guy, met up with a bunch of fellow Yelpers. Service was decently attentive and polite, but product was dismal despite the discounted rate we were offered.

Leos was telling us all about the company background- they have the same concept restaurant in China, where they do very well. DÃ©cor, particularly the lighting, is clearly very expensive and upscale. White and red minimalist style with wood tables and creative drawings on the wall make this an attractive place, and the giant shrimp on their exterior signage is eye-catching.

But this particular plaza is not highly trafficked and the signage is mostly missed by street traffic- not sure where they're advertising but to be as empty as they were on a Friday night, it is clearly not enough.

The crawfish we had only came in two flavors: their house Hot Feel sauce and garlic, available in mild, medium, and hot. Flavors were not very pronounced and were rather one-note with a lack of depth but they were not bad. 

I notice a lot of other reviews complimenting their garlic shrimp, and would consider returning to try them- but if they're in the same sauce I don't think I would be impressed. Price point is the same as Hot N Juicy, but quality of product and flavor of sauces is not on par with the competition.

Also tried the lamb skewers at Leos' recommendation, and while they weren't bad it didn't do anything for me. They are better skewers than what I recently had from Fat Dumpling down the street recently though.

2290432,2014-03-26,2,tZEW8ESjrVmNGXvPnrR97w,"Somewhere nomenclaturely tucked in-between the Killers' album (Hot Fuss) and MGMT's single (Electric Feel) is this new spot, Hot Feel. Frankly, there was 25+ minute wait at the Boiling Crab, so we hit the Yelp app, saw some decent reviews on this place, and went to try it for ourselves.

Started with the lamb and chicken skewers. A few of the lamb skewers were served medium-rare, just in case you care about meat temps. Chicken was white meat, good quality and perfectly grilled. But, both the lamb and chicken were over-sprinkled with their signature orange seasoning salt. My first impression was, ""Salty!"" Got the grilled corn-on-the-cob and it also had the exact same seasoning salt on it, and too much of it for my taste. If I could order these things again, I would order them with 'less salt' as they really were doused with the stuff. For $5, you do get a generous number of skewers (8 per order I believe) so that is kind of cool.

Got the pot of cajun-inspired peel-n-eat, head-on shrimp. Garlic style, extra spicy. The 'extra spicy' spice level was a solid *hot*. But, the chili pepper flakes were the crushed, and not ground variety, which made the texture of the pot sauce not very fun to eat. Strangely gritty, actually. Like chewing on small, tough bits of bay leaves. This affected the in-pot corn cobs as well. I did love the chopped bits of garlic in the sauce, and I wish there were even more garlic in it as I ran out of garlic bits by the 10th or 11th shrimp.

The head-on shrimps themselves were large, and the *exact* shrimp count was 16 in my one pound order. Pretty standard. (Boiling Crab sometimes gives you 17 or 18 by accident; Hot & Juicy 16-17 but 5 of them are usually headless or total runts; District One only gives you 14.) Four of the Hot Feel shrimp were on the borderline mushy side - a pet peeve of mine when it comes to this dish. Hot & Juicy is the worst when it comes to this. I always end up enacting the cajun shrimp exchange program at Hot & Juicy when I show them the mushy ones.

Anyways - I did have a very slight allergic reaction to the Hot Feel shrimp about 30 minutes after dinner. Not a biggie, but worth noting. That does not happen when I eat the shrimp from the aforementioned competitors (even the sketchy Hot & Juicy).

Super nice staff, and pleasant environment. They've got TVs with 4 different sports channels which is cool. Potential - yes. Would I go back? Maybe. A *huge* difference between this place and say, Boiling Crab, is the good variety of things to eat aside from the pot-o-cajun seafood. Hot Feel and District One have this in common.",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,4,4,3,Eps01tZ1M6dGwsqKOrRPnQ

I don't know most places I've been to if you really don't like something you don't have to pay for it and to top it off it was waaaaay to spicy I had to eat the fried rice that I would say was more like steamed rice just to cool my mouth down and the service was outright horrible and the restaurant itself was freezing. I honestly don't know how this place could stay open. I'm from alaska where we get fresh good seafood and it seems as though their seafood is definitely outdated or going bad. We didn't get a refill on our drinks until it was time for us to go and we were served with cheap paper plates that you get from Walmart and no silverware instead of silverware they gave us a set of cheap huge plastic gloves.

There's always something new popping up in Chinatown, and Hot Feel is part of the newest crop, located in the same strip mall as Kinh Do, waaaay in the back, surrounded by foot spas and massage parlors. Similar to Hot & Juicy/Boiling Crab format, they offer assorted seafood by the piece or pound, with sauces of different heat levels according to the amount of heat you can handle served in heavy duty pots instead of plastic bags as well as various appetizers, fried items, skewers, and hot pots.

Prior to demolition time, you are given two pieces of paper as your placemats with a pair of annoying gloves that don't even ""fit like a glove"" and be sure to ask for wet naps which are up at the register(found that out after our meal) cause its gonna get messy.

Our party of four decided to share the Lamb Skewers, Shrimp Skewers, Chicken Wings, Rock Crab, and Garlic Shrimp. The Rock Crab was sweet with a nice lemony accent, the Shrimp Skewers(head on, shell on) were okay, and while the wings were  hot, crisp, and juicy, I would've liked to see a Hot Feel twist to it, rather than just a cup of ranch, especially in an Asian restaurant. The standouts were the Garlic Shrimp(head on, shell on) which was packed with tons of flavor with the right amount of heat(we asked for mild). The Lamb Skewers were also soft and flavorful. If you come here, this is one of the items to try.

Right now, they are running a VIP Card special for $20(no expiration date) which allows you 10% off your dining bill with future visits, and BOGO specials(This night, it was BOGO Crab, and if you post any food pic on Facebook(NOT Yelp or Instagram)
you can win a drawing for jewelry up front as well as gift certificates towards future visits. Come in for a taste and see how it stacks up to the other favorites in town.  ALOHA!!!

After hearing about the buzz for a while and positive feed backs, my friends and I decided to check it out. 

The location of Hot Feel could make someone having a double take where they are going. Hot Feel is sandwiched between a gun shooting range and the Asian massage parlors. One could not help but to wonder - ""Okay, where am I heading to.... "" 

But once I walked inside, there is no doubt it is a restaurant. The tables are sectioned off with specially designed walls, so the diners seem to have more privacy within their parties. 

Our party has about 16 people (half adults and half kids), so we sat in the open, and left the kids in their sectioned off quarter while keeping an eye on them by going back and forth.

I have one of the Hot Feel VIP card that a friend gave me, so I told the waiter at the onset of the ordering. We received a complimentary appetizer (Green Mussels), and 10% discounts on our tab. 

We ordered a variety of items from the menu and did a Chinese family sharing style. We tried their popular items such as the skewers (lamb, beef, and chicken), Hot Feel shrimps, crawfish, and the hot pot combo. The flavor are very much to our taste - it got some real authentic Chinese taste to it (in my opinion, although I have never been to China). Except for the skewer and the hot pot combo, the dishes are served in the small cooking pots. So I figured that the foods are probably served directly from kitchen to the table. 

Notably, the broth in the hot pot is an enjoyment by itself. My sister and friend ordered the side noodles/ramen poured some of the hot pot combo broth in it. Although my friend is not too keen on spicy food, she was able to enjoy the instant transformed spicy noodle.",Dxrg83u8Qgep2YRjYJSg5w,1,0,5,XFMjaCGd7oUhtblNzL96NQ

Service was great and price was so reasonable.

They bait you to purchase this card for $20 which supposedly will entitle you to buy one get one free on daily specials, get a free item with your purchase each visit and a 10% discount on a total bill.
Later you find out on subsequent visits that they find reasons to deny you what they contracted for. What was the final straw for me was my waiter informing me after I placed my order that I would not be able to use my V.I.P. card because I was dining alone !!! This was not something that was mentioned when they accepted the $20 V.I.P. card charge.
The food is good and the service is good but they left ""a bitter taste in my mouth"" with such ""business ethics"". May be this is something one can expect on one's travels in China but in the U.S.A. we do not expect to be treated this way.

Grilled chicken heart, yummy. Grilled lamp kabob, yum yum. Grill lamp kidney... ohh baby!!! Now if you are grossed out by now, you need to stop reading this or move down to the next paragraph LOL. Anyway, this place serves some unique Chinese food, but they also specialize in crawfish and shrimp.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Garlic shrimp and/or garlic crawfish, they are the BOMB! As for the hot feel sauce, it was too sweet and salty for me, I recommend staying away for that sauce. As for the hotpot, the soup was soooooo salty, I couldn't even eat the soup soaked tofu, let alone the soup.

The layout of the restaurant is so weird. They have some big screen TVs along the wall, but the cubicle shaped booths in the center of the restaurant have very high wall, so basically you can't even enjoy the TVs if you happen to sit in one of those cubicles. They need to remove these spacing hogging booths and just put normal tables, the restaurant will look bigger.

There were two waitresses when we were there and they seemed a little overwhelmed. The girl named Katie was super nice and attentive and apologized for the wait, so she made the dining experience much better. I will revisit this place again but I will stay away from the hotpot and hot feel sauce. Happy eating!",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,0,0,3,zP75TVMJequQPEaxegewaw

5349070,2014-03-12,1,tZEW8ESjrVmNGXvPnrR97w,"I've been dying to try this place and one night, I finally got to try it! Andrew C, my boyfriend, and I decided to come here for dinner. And let me tell you, this place is confusing. Finding it wasn't so hard cause there was a giant shrimp on the building but once I walked in, I was wondering if this is supposed to be American/Creole or Asian. The establishment was very spacious and the decorations are VERY modern. You know that feeling when you walk into a restaurant that's supposed to be Asian but doesn't look Asian, you get a little skeptical ....

But what the heck, they had lamb skewers, or ""lamb sticks"" as they called it. I've been trying to find a good place that had lamb skewers for ages!

So, as a group, we ordered the hot pot stick in spicy, lamb skewers in med and spicy, and beef skewers in spicy. 

For the hot pot sticks, it came in a pitcher of hot pot soup with skewers. You got to choose 4 from the menu and we chose shrimp, beef tendon balls, fried tofu, and king oyster mushroom. The hot pot soup base was pretty much mala broth. It wasn't spicy, per say, it was just hot ... as in temperature hot. In the end, this dish was average. It wasn't anything special. Can I just order the king oyster mushrooms on its own?! 

The lamb skewers were very good but the flavor difference between medium spicy and spicy is huge. The medium spicy lamb skewers tasted sweet while the spicy ones were spicy. The medium spicy ones are a no go. I LOVED the spicy ones. They were DELICIOUS. They were exactly the type of lamb skewers I look for. Wonderfully seasoned with cumin and spicy flavor. The only thing was ... the pieces of meat were quite small. It would probably be better if the pieces were bigger and less well done. Oh and eat them while they're still hot because once it gets cold, it doesn't taste as good anymore.

The beef skewers on the other hand are a no go. I don't think beef and cumin are a good combination. Then again, maybe I'm just biased? I just like lamb better than beef when it comes to cumin and spicy seasoning. 

Overall. Lamb skewers are a go go go go. I will definitely come back for them and maybe try some of their seafood :)",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,2,4,CqmGXpe6vF6Q5ElYL9NCfw

Anyways, he kept talking about how awesome this place Hot Feel was. Let me be honest for a second, getting invited to a restaurant called Hot Feel by another guy can come off as a little odd, but he then mentioned that this place has got it going on and you use your hands and get down and dirty. Okay so maybe that is not the best way to invite someone either... Once past the jokes and puns that I'm sure I through at him I replied with a simple answer of Hell Yes ill go to Hot Feel with you. I had seen pictures he had posted on his facebook of the interior and the food and I was down to try it out.

I rolled in to the parking lot to be greeted by a HUGE shrimp on the front of the building which really stands out in the parking lot that they happen to be in and once you walk in it is pretty surprising, the way the booth/tables are set up is pretty cool, It is private yet not too private.... I only say that because me being 6'5 I am much taller than the average customer was that night and I could basically sit in my chair and perch over to see what everyone around us was doing, But the interior was cool none the less. 

Now onto the nitty gritty, the menu came to the table and we were off to the races, Sooner than you could rip the head off a shrimp we had king crab, and hot pots with what looked like an endless supply of sticks hanging out of it on our table as well as spicy beef skewers. I say spicy loosely because I love extreme hot food and according to my trusty taste buds with who I trust with my stomach would have to call out that the ""HOT"" on the menu was not hot enough for me, but to some at our table you would have thought someones long lost grandma just passed with all the tears being shed. Anyways, the quality of the food was great, the food was fresh, hot (temperature hot not scoville units hot) and the customer service and wait staff was great. I would definitely come back and see if they could up the anty for me in the spicy department.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,1,3,5,bZLybabVlWh7xZCVPL7iUQ
5734912,2014-03-06,1,tZEW8ESjrVmNGXvPnrR97w,"So far so good (and spicy) so I'll definitely be back. It's a spacious restaurant. Staff is uber friendly. I didn't catch his name but he was a pretty cool server.

First off, we got the hotpot combo. You get 4 items at 5 pieces each and it soaks in the hotpot broth. There's no mild for this so we got the second option in terms of spice levels (3 total). He says it doesn't soak up the spice much in a short time span, but the tofu SOAKS it up well. So, beware, if you can't take much spice like me.

Aside from that we only got the lamb skewers. I'll be back for other stuff. Now, for the lamb skewers, we got mild, because frankly, I don't want to die burning.

So, guess what? I died burning. It was soooooooooooooooo spicy!!!!!!! WHY?! Because they were trying a new spice or new manufacturer (or something of the like) and it was WAY too spicy. It wasn't just us. I believe the staff tried it as well as the table next to us. Yeah, it was death by the burning of my tongue and I was wishing for milk (of course, they didn't have it). BURN BURN BURN.

Anyway, they gave us a new stock of lamb skewers. No spice ;).

Owner came over and apologized and explained the situation. No biggie. He's a pretty nice guy. Explained their VIP cards, too. Right now it's $20 until the end of April. So, if you think you'll be coming often, grab one before the prices go up. It's pretty much where they offer different deals per day and each day offers a different item.

For example, you could get a BOGO (for example, BOGO crab) one day. You could get 10% off the whole bill. And so forth. I don't remember every one that he listed but feel free to ask any of the servers. :)

While the experience wasn't excellent for my first time, it was handled well. And I will definitely be back. ^^V",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,4,0,4,e26f4ZPKql8nyRJaXzDbNA
