My toddler sonny boy can recognize the corner where Rocco's is located and whenever we pass by, 'Hey Dada, can I has some pizza?'

Sure!

I've ordered their pizza a bunch of times and I would describe it as a great NY style pizza - thin crust, good sauce, good cheese.  One way I measure a good pizza is how it tastes the next day - Roccos pizza tastes great!

I've also had their corned beef sandwich - it was piled a mile high with quality meat and I had to save half for later.  Great deal.

What more can I say?  Its good.  Try it!",2hlgQi8j6XOtVEP5SNW3vQ,0,1,4,P97db98Cix_JWFWsp3VeiA
165810,2012-03-16,1,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"I purchased a Yelp deal $15 for $20 and was excited to try this place because of the solid reviews. Unfortunately, it was a huge let down, not just in terms of food, but also service. We ordered two of their house specialties: pastrami and corned beef sandwich $10.95 (no side included) and chicken marsala $15.95. When I presented the Yelp deal voucher, the guy manning the counter stared at it for a awhile and was like ""Wot's this? So you get $20 off?"" and acting as if it was some bogus creation that I was trying to scam them with. I patiently explained to him that it was a legit online deal that I had already paid $15 for this $20 voucher. In the meantime, some inconsiderate parents are letting their two young kids, who presumably just came from tap dancing lessons, clickety-clack all throughout the restaurant. Talk about obnoxious! At checkout, he wanted to charge me $16 something. I told him that total doesn't seem right. He tells me that he is only taking $5 off the bill so I had to reexplain how the Yelp deal is supposed to work. He begrudgingly recalculates the balance as $6.92 and says I can't use my credit card and have to pay cash. I'm thinking to myself that this guy is really trying my patience and can't do simple arithmetic either. Whatever, let's just get the heck out of here. Once we got home and sampled the food, we liked the sandwich filling although I had asked for rye bread and they gave us some mediocre kaiser roll. Unfortunately, the chicken marsala was subpar. The marsala sauce was very subtle and it was more like a buttered pasta. When you take into account the relatively small portion size, it is an even poorer value. For a couple bucks more you could have Cheesecake Factory's much tastier version with a portion size of almost double. In the end, mediocre food + crappy service + poor value = 1.5 to 2 stars. In the future, we'll stick with Rocco's NY Pizzeria (different owner) for our NY Italian fix.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,2,1,2,TtGIG02pZp17VTvUSwZVaw
182622,2007-10-31,0,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"I was a frequent Rocco's customer for the two months I lived in Vegas and was in love at first bite. My usual favorites included the eggplant supreme, cannoli's, chicken parm, and spinach pie. If you can't find something from pasta, salads, pizza, and sandwich's that do not strike your fancy, there is something terribly wrong with you. The food is nothing crazy or different, just straight up good old fashioned Italian. 

Do not leave without buying a pint of Gelato from the freezer case. They have it shipped in, but it is to die for. I highly recommend the vanilla cinnamon flavor. 

They also carry non-perishable grocery items imported from Italy.

203337,2017-03-22,0,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"Let me say this first and foremost: I love love LOVE the sandwiches! Classic turkey is my fave and always is piled high with fresh made chips on the side. My husband is a big fan of the Hot Italian beef sandwich with au jus. Neither had those chips we like so much. We always order from Eat24 and have never been disappointed with the food or service itself. I will say though, no place is perfect and not getting salad dressing or marinara sauce here or there is bound to happen eventually. 

Today was our first bust- I tried the turkey pineapple habanero sandwich. Stale bread, hard edges on Swiss cheese, SUPER sweet. I was expecting heat from the habanero but maybe my mistake? Either way, not my fave, not their fault. The stale bread and cheese however is. I didn't finish it and not because of taste. Husband ordered a roast beef sandwich by accident when he wanted a hot Italian beef sandwich. He didn't mind it although he normally doesn't eat that, however it also had stale bread so he didn't make it past a few bites. I'm honestly surprised they let that bread leave the restaurant, I was under the impression they had better standards. 

We opted not to call the restaurant and say anything. We've had far too many good experiences to write off one not-so-great experience. We will definitely keep ordering!",gxTIOq4i9WsKfE0DGiNhjw,1,0,4,LdpJ-HBE3rvYZ3iEt_tEVg

I was now, crazy hungry and the anticipation  was killing me. I drive home with the smell of fresh bread in my truck, making my mouth water! I get into my house and savagely unwrap the sandwich like a kid on Christmas. At first glance, I thought ""this is nothing like my beloved Bay Cities"" I finally take a bite and my initial thought was confirmed, ""THIS IS NOTHING LIKE MY BELOVED BAY CITIES!!!""  The bread is not hearty  enough to stand up to the sauce on an eggplant parm. The eggplant it self appears to be prebreaded then reheated. The entire sandwich culminated in a soggy warm mess.

959661,2013-05-29,0,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"Rocco's is strictly ok - borderline meh. I lived on Long Island, and know a good pizza place. That said, for Vegas my expectations are not set too high. Still, Rocco's LOOKS like a real NY deli. Of course, the uniforms on employees immediately reminds us we're not in New York anymore, though they are still a nice presentation. 

As for the food:
The 'garlic knots' are more butter/cheese knots than anything. I don't remember tasting a hint of garlic in them. 

The wings:
Ordered medium. Approximately 80% butter and  the rest what tasted like Frank's buttery wing sauce. All very buttery so far. 

The spaghetti and meatballs: The marinara is quite good. The pasta was ever-so-slightly past al dente, but okay. The meatballs were heavy in basil, and tasted better broken in pieces and twirled in the pasta than by themselves. The meatballs also had large pieces of breadcrumbs inside them - which didn't affect the flavor experience, but was not the most aesthetically pleasing.

I was given the dinner portion and did not find out they had a lunch special until I paid my bill. 

For a displaced New Yorker, there a couple of places in town that truly offer the tastes of home and Rocco's is not one of them - though they come close with few items.  

Yet, the food is convincing enough that the Summerlin crowd will not know the difference, hence my giving the place 3 stars.",9Jw0YHumH6OvTU2On5nSHA,3,0,3,qHiC5C_3uGUC8ndTPccCew

1345625,2013-01-11,4,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"I'd like to start by making a confession.  I'm not a big fan of Italian food overall, nor do I think NY style pizza is the best pizza.

Phew...not that that's off my chest, I can get to my 5 star review!

My first trip to Rocco's was after a night out with my brother and quite a few libations.  Let me just say that the pastrami & corned beef combo sandwich does wonders for the late night cravings!  I think I got through about 1/2 of it before giving up...which may likely still equate to about 2 lbs of sandwich.

About a week later, my son was craving pizza, which is not unusual to be the case almost daily for a growing 8 year old boy.  I, on the other hand, was not craving pizza.  I recalled seeing some pizza by the slice options at Rocco's, so off we went!  My son was thrilled as the guy behind the counter cut him ""a slice"" of pizza.  If you weren't aware, apparently in New York, a slice equates to 1/4 of a full sized pizza.  What kid wouldn't love that?

I saw the major league baseball sized rice balls and opted for one of those.  Then I spotted a delicious looking beef dish in marinara sauce and had to learn more.  Once the ""bragiole"" was described to me, I decided I had to have that as well!  

My son and I sat at a little table and enjoyed what I think was maybe the best Italian dinner I've ever had!  I couldn't ask for better company, a better environment, and better food.  The whole experience easily earned a 5 star rating from me.  This may become a regular tradition for us.",6x3aIb8SLZcOFcHEcWBLog,5,5,5,wnVBhWXwihaq_mhijqLXwQ

Tonight, my husband and I googled best places for pizza and Rocco's NY Italian Deli came up. Upon entering, we were greeted with the cheeriest hello. Alicia was her name. She asked if we had any questions, and told us where the drinks were. 
As I sat at the table, I heard her happily conversing with each and every person, asking how their day had been. She talked to every one of us like we were personal friends. We ordered an Everything pizza.

But I heard a lot of good things about this place. After eating here, I came to a conclusion that the pizza, is effing amazing. I recommend  a plain cheese slice. For 1.99$ a slice, you can't go wrong, cuz  thats actually cheaper and better than the garbage they serve at places like Sbarro.You can definitely taste the quality. my personal favorite as far as sandwiches go, is the hot pastrami and corned beef. it comes piled high with swiss cheese, creamy coleslaw and homemade russian dressing. The chicken champagne is also fantastic. The ingredients are fresh, you can taste it in the food, which is what definitely sets them apart from your average local pizza/deli/italian joints.",3EKm38imhyCk3xcVVQbdZg,3,2,5,PgsF4-1ftC6jgx8uSKf4sQ

I ordered the calamari, some of the calamari was over cooked & some were delicious. I also ordered a large cheese pizza, and a 12 pieces of garlic knots. I'm from New York, The cheese pizza crust was very soggy ( nothing to be bragging about their cheese pizzas) They could have cooked the cheese pizza a little bit longer to make the crust crispy. The garlic knots were delicious as usual. At the end I pay my bill with an American Express credit card.  I noticed that they charged me $.75 for using my credit card! This practice of charging customers for using their credit card is not cool at all!! So I still have mixed feelings about coming back to Rocco's.

I had the Pastrami Sandwich which was generous with meat for the price but it didn't live up to other pastrami sandwiches i have had around town taste wise. My wife ordered a large pizza and I ended up eating a couple slices and damn it was good. I am picky about pizza and will admit the ""thin NY"" type isn't usually my cup of tea but this one actually had flavor and hardly any grease. My wife ended up coming back for lunch a couple days later and had one of their White Pizzas. She could only eat half so I ended up eating the rest for dinner later and it was pretty good. They have a check in offer on yelp for a free mini cannoli but I'm not so much a fan of those like my wife is so I just shared hers instead of redeeming mine. 

They make bread fresh on site and sell it along with meats, cheeses, desserts, etc. The glass cases are clean but not too much pricing was posted for what was in them. Staff here is friendly and when you see them sitting down eating the food it is usually a good sign.

1588309,2014-03-13,3,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"The cocky and condescending guys who work here actually put out some damn good sandwiches. They know it, and have the awards to prove it, too. I can't tell if they're moody and rude as part of a gimmick to be more ""authentic"" with the NY 'hood style, or if they're just jerks. Zero sense of humor, always seem vaguely annoyed to have customers. 

Pastrami sandwich here is pretty much a work of art. It's a contender for BF's last meal requests- delicious bread piled thick with pastrami. Just the thought of it makes him drool uncontrollably. It's his go-to sandwich at any deli, and he easily puts it in his top three bests.

We shared a featured special sandwich today: garlic bread loaded high with shredded beef, grilled peppers and onions, and marinara sauce and pecorino cheese. We opted for the ""large' since we were planning to share, and received what looked like an entire loaf of garlic bread that was perhaps close to 2 feet long. Luckily, we got it to go, but the damn thing was like eating a chunk of Italy- it was essentially an italian take on a cheesesteak, and I was quite surprised with the results.  Bread was delicious, just enough sauce to make it saucy without making it soggy, and heaps of toppings. I managed less than a third of this monstrosity, but staked my claim on the leftovers early- already looking forward to tomorrow's leftovers.

The pizza here also gets raves, and I plan on trying that... along with the Bronx Bomber, or the Anthony Special sandwiches... and their chicken piccata entree with mozarella sounds amazing too. Oh hell, I overlook the employee attitude problems because they make damn good food. Just let it be known that their score would be higher if they weren't rude.

We bought all the Tastycakes they had in the fridge, haven't had them in years!  Anyway, I would totally reccommend this place and wish I lived closer so I could go there more often.

1861179,2013-11-22,0,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"I've been getting tired of eating at the same old places and we got a menu in the mail for this place. The menu had nice pictures of some of the food and great advertising for the way they cook with fresh ingredients and lots of homemade stuff. We splurge about once a month and eat out. Most times our home cooking is better then the places we go.

We ordered about 80 bucks worth of food: 
 1. Chicken fingers (medium spice): not at all spicy but a great flavor. Nice clean cuts of chicken breasts. I'm the worlds pickiest eater and I usually don't like eatting chicken out because it never seems like it's cleaned/trimmed well.

2. Homemade Mozzarella Stix: These were pretty good, but make sure you have enough people and a big appetite as these do not reheat well.

3. Chicken Franchese: Nice full flavors without being overpowering at all. The chicken was very moist. There was just the right amount sauce to pasta. The portions were HUGE. I think I had 5 meals out of this one dish. The pasta dishes all come with garlic knots. The garlic knots were a little heavy on the garlic, but they were great =)

4. Veal Marsala: This was the hubby's dish and he's still talking about how good it was almost 2 weeks later ;)

5. A large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and extra cheese. Again I'm a picky eater and I use to be a big Pizza Hut fan (I prefer  deep dish pizzas). I started making my own pizza that blew Pizza Hut out of the water and this pizza is on par with my homemade one. This isn't a deep dish pizza, it's not a thin crust either. This pizza was one of the best I've ever eaten anywhere.

6. A couple of Homemade Cannolis.  These weren't really my cup of tea, they tasted ok. The hubby assured me for Cannoli's these were excellent examples of a cannoli. The the cream wasn't over sweet and you could definitely taste the cinnamon used.

So in summary, this place was just awesome. It's about two weeks later and we're still talking about how great everything was and placed another order tonight to try out some more stuff. We didn't go as crazy ordering stuff this time. And last time we had enough food to feed our family of 3 for 3 days of snacking and eating leftovers.

2137232,2012-02-28,0,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"Second visit to Rocco's today  to sample more goodies for lunch!  Wow Again!

I tend to be ""wordy"" but it gets my thoughts across - I am NOT  Italian, but have had the joy of eating Italian foods created with love by real Italian people!

Starting with my Dad's youngest brother's very Italian wife Gloria - grew ALL her own garden veggies - special-ordered meats from a local Italian farmer who had a smoke-house and Deli, and baked her own breads all from scratch.  

Visits to Uncle Frank and Aunt Gloria's always meant AMAZING meals- she cooked all day and the whole neighborhood smelled heavenly when our car turned the corner onto their street!

Years ago, I dated a handsome Italian guy with a gracious Italian mom and the same amazing, unmistakably Italian aromas and flavors layered into delicious food I enjoyed at their home!

Sadly, I broke up with the handsome Italian guy long ago and sadly, Aunt Gloria passed away.  It's important for anyone reading this to know that I didn't ever get any of those family recipes, so WHENEVER I COOK ""ITALIAN""  - it involves Frozen Pizza, grated cheese from a plastic shaker bottle, and cans of ready-made sauce.  Oh - and a bottle of wine.

So through the years I have sought out smaller, family-run Italian restaurants because  I love REAL Italian food!   

My recent move to Las Vegas, NV shook up my restaurant routines and until the other day I hadn't even tried to find a local Italian deli - well it turns out there is Rocco's around the corner from my new job!

Found it almost by accident - my first lunch order was NY Pizza Slice  - I couldn't tell NY Pizza from Chicago Pizza but it was very tasty  - the slice was HUGE and I ended up saving 1/2 for lunch the next day!  It even microwaved well as a left-over!

So I went there at lunch again today - when you first walk in the place smells like the wonderful Italian home-cooking I adore!  Everything looks inviting - they have hot and cold display cases and a freezer full of goodies, beautiful cookies and other baked goods, not to mention a dry-goods section!

Today I splurged - got Eggplant Parmesan, Marinara on the side and freshly grated Parmesan - a small container of Antipasto and GIANT SLICE of Tiramisu!

All of this was delicious and again I have leftovers for lunch at the office tomorrow!  Well - except for the Tiramisu - I simply could NOT stop myself from finishing it!

This food had  home-made quality - the folks working there seem really to care when you ask questions about ingredients or how long ago something was made - For the sizes of the servings, prices are fine!  

They do have a $10.00 minimum to use Visa etc., but that's ok.  I will go back again and work my way through their menu - not a ""fancy"" dinner house to be sure, but one does not need a ""fancy"" dinner to enjoy a delicious dinner.....",x2UH6FDHf0Cpz4StD-GNZQ,1,0,4,Mmup9wq-K_aNINqHxCnBRg

2151080,2011-02-22,3,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"OMG! This place is great! First off, I will HIGHLY recommend the pastrami/cornbeef combo sandwich. Not sure what the shop name is for it, but hands down it is the BEST sandwich I have ever had in my life, in the world, for all times!!!
I get that sandwich almost everytime I am down there, and then on top of it, usually order a pizza (white or stuffed) to go with the sandwich. Consistency with all of thier food, never dissapointing, always delicious, and simply great food, great price and great feeling in your stomach when it's all said and done.
Now if you want some pizza, go no further than the stuffed pizza. The thing is a monster, and while it is on the pricy side, it is worth every penny. One slice (ONE!!!) is enough for anybody. I challenge you to finish 2 slices of this pie! It's a monster stuffed with so much good stuff, my mouth is actually watering thinking about it.
I gotta stop, I'm getting a hankering for some meats and pizza right now...
All said, great place. And I am not joking-I would swear it on the bible that the Pastrami/Corned Beed is the best sandwich in the world that I have ever had, and I would like to extend my gratitude to Rocco's for granting me the privelage of stuffing my face with it.",g47QBt5tZXEcjTLKJGgF0w,3,2,5,ulGInQZnpvqPaWvqdiKaRg

I was obviously flattered by conversation, but I also decided to check out some pastas at Rocco's.

All their pastas come with a nice Italian House Salad and a couple Garlic Knots.  I went with the Rigatoni Zingaro - Sausage, Hot Cherry Peppers, Fresh Mushrooms and a slightly spicy pink sauce.  I love pink sauce!...and they did it wonderfully!  Also ordered the Chicken & Broccoli Alfredo.  Both were very nice portion sizes...easy to save some for lunch the next day.

2445491,2017-10-09,8,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"Come here... leave the strip... 

Let me set the scene. 
Enter.... couple from Hawaii.
NY-style deli located in a tiny strip mall.
No waiter/waitress. Sit anywhere if dining in. 
Greeted immediately by a smiling man with glasses (Anthony) and a petite lady in a ball cap. 

Friendly. Warm. Reggae music piped in... Playing my jam... ""Island girl"" by Tribal Seeds
Yknow that gut feeling you get when you enter a place and you JUST know that you have just found a new ""family tradition""?... well - that's what this experience was for us.

It was our first visit. 
Anthony offered us menus to peruse. But didn't. 
Engaged in conversation with him instead. 
They offered items in the deli case to sample (antipasto is ON POINT!, get it... thank me later!! - mortadella, capicola, sweet red peppers, green peppers... AND.SO.MUCH.MORE, perfectly marinaded)!

Here's what we ended up ordering:
Freshly made garlic knots (order of 6 with red sauce) - free with a yelp! review)
Antipasto - get it!!
Fresh mozzarella (marinaded with garlic)
Lobster stromboli (takes 15 minutes) served with butter wine sauce on the side (I drank it!)
Chicken marsala - huge portion covered with heaping pile of mushrooms. Sweet marsala wine sauce (I added parm).
Garlic bread - crispy and soft. 
Canoli 
Diet Espresso Coffee Soda ""Manhattan Special"" - it was good!! Not too sweet.
Cookies to bring home as omiyage (gifts for family and friends). 

I cannot say enough about how I love supporting local small businesses, learning about them, and loving the food. 
Anthony is a Las Vegas local and has 5 keiki. 

While dining in... steady stream of people (all their regulars).  They got slices of pizza, wedges of cheese from the deli (cut to their weight specifications), cookies, etc.

The walls are covered in NY/NJ license plates, photos, and a blue line American flag. This past week was a difficult one in Las Vegas. Thank you to the men and women in blue for responding so amazingly to protect so many during the tragedy. Thank you Rocco's for supporting our law enforcement! 

Service is something that often gets overlooked. I've noticed in Vegas people will want to eat at the places by celebrity chefs or the quick spots convenient to dine in on the Strip. But...
There was something about this place that was so home-y and inviting.
A place I want to bring all my family and friends. I hope you get a chance to get off the strip and come here. Talk with Anthony. 

Thank you Rocco's for the welcoming experience.  The conversation and laughs. Best service I've had during my time in Las Vegas.",m4yg8dyYg0WyqhYlDpzhew,14,12,5,INUm-pqDcK1BxWdVGs8AvQ

The place has changed hands several times since then, but I always return for excellent white pie; Ronzoni products I've not found elsewhere; Cavatelli (I make my own white clam sauce)  and to have 'zas, sandwich trays, cannoli, Rainbow, and Italian cookies made for meetings or ""thank you's"" 

For imported and fresh moz, I prefer another spot, but for ok and giant orancini - most don't know better anyway - they work fine. (rice balls for L'Americans with cheese and either meat or red sauce and peas) Also prefer plain slices elsewhere, but that white pie, well done,  kicks ass. 

I've never had their other meals/cooked pasta so I can't speak to them. But I do drive 20+ minutes out of my way for that white pie. My folks enjoy the plain cheese, so if sharing we will do half and half. 

Really do miss the Daily News on the counter, and Nelson is correct: whether getting your ""free"" check in mini cannoli or others, ask for the filling on the side. Nobody likes a soggy cannoli. Their printed menu is pretty straightforward and the workers are all sweet. Eddie the chef told me this is the only Rocco's in town which bakes their own bread: I believe him -- and my favorite!

I placed an order at 6:10 for one slice, one calzone, and one antipasti. I was told 45-1 hour. at 7:35 (almost 1 hour and a half later) I called inquiring about where the order was and was told it would be there any minute. Fifteen minutes later (7:50) we called back and asked for the manager and was directed to Anthony. He told my boyfriend he would immediately call his driver. At 8:10, we still hadn't received anything. I called back and was told ""it will be there any minute"". Basically we kept getting excuse after excuse that the driver ""was supposed to come to us first but didn't"". Um, not my problem. The driver called me five minutes later and asked what our address was... what??? When I told her she said ""that's why I'm lost, it's the wrong number"", but not the wrong street name, and our street is small. She then told us that the managers had NOT called her to find out where she was multiple times like they told us they did. Then she asked for payment, even though we paid over the phone. Of course when we opened our food, it was cold. We called back ONCE more, honestly merely looking for an apology or maybe an offer to bring more hot food right away. May, who we had spoken to several times, told us there was ""nothing they could do about it now because it's the driver that messed up and was supposed to come here first"".

We have ordered these previously (except the fried ravioli) and know what they taste like. 

The Penne Vodka was pale orange, had no flavor and barely any sauce. Worse off the fettuccini and chicken Alfredo the sauce tasted like spoiled milk. The meatballs (which I LOVED before) like bad meat, the sauce was cool to touch, not even warm and they VERY heavily coated the top in parsley. The fried ravioli was the only edible thing we ordered. The order arrived 30 minutes early but all of it was luke warm? The restaurant isn't even that far from me! The food was literally uneaten, we had to contact eat24 to figure out what was going on since the restaurant had closed.  We understand that sometimes shit happens, but how the restaurant responded is exactly why they are losing a good review and customers!

Eat24 told us they are refusing to refund or replace the order and stating they always send out ""made to order, fresh food"" BUT OURS WAS improperly prepared and LUKE WARM on arrival  (previous orders food was always piping hot).

I'm a sucker for almost anything with these over-priced crustaceans, so it was a no-brainer to try it. Their version of a lobster roll ($12.99) was a large hoagie roll stuffed with 1/2 lb of meat. 

They give you the option of adding mayo into the mix, but I passed. Instead, I opted for the more straightforward preparation, which was drizzled with butter and herbs. The first few bites were amazing -- lots of meaty lobster and bold flavors, but it was evident that they did more than drizzle butter on it... more like drowned it in butter. The bread did a good job of soaking up a lot of it, but it was just butter overload. Even Paula Dean would have thought it too much.

There's no doubt it was one of the better lobster rolls I've found in town, but the butter made it tough to finish. Towards the end, I just ditched the bread and finished up the lobster. If they ease up on the butter they'd have a real winner on their hands.

3516998,2014-01-11,23,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"They sell pizza by the slice, so originally that was the plan. On the way in though I noticed a pizza special on the window for a $9.99 large (pick-up/carryout). I thought that was a great price to try out their pizza and this way it would be a freshly made pizza. Walking in it looked like a typical deli. There were tables inside and the usual pasta, tomato sauce, etc. for sale. The olives, meats and sweets they offer look very good, but they have no prices on anything. There are plenty of signs along the glass case promoting catering and their win on ""Sandwich Wars"" yet nothing saying how much per pound or per slice anything was. Maybe they were changing out prices and I came at an off time, but if I have to ask how much something is... I'm more than likely to just pass all together. 

The guy who took the order was nice and when I showed him my yelp check-in deal for a free ""Mini Cannoli"" he made sure I marked it *used* and said it would be with my order. He also said it would be about 10-ish minutes for the pizza to be made and that was cool by me. When the food was ready I checked my bag and there was no Cannoli. I had to ask for it and the girl who handed me the food acted like she had no idea about it and had to ask around. Finally, the guy who took the order came out and said ""yeah yeah they get a free mini"" so she went and packaged one up for me. 

The pizza deal wont be going on forever. The guy told me that they would be stopping it soon. Don't fret! If you get down here before it ends you will get a card that gets you the large cheese pizza for $9.99 every time. Score! 

Wow! The pizza was pretty darn good! I love when something as simple as a cheese pizza tastes so good. It seems lately I have been experiencing bland pizza, but not here. The sauce has a good flavor and I like the crust. I had some left over for lunch the next day and it was just as good cold! The Cannoli made for a nice dessert. I enjoyed it.

The first time we had deli sandwiches which were very good with a canolli, which I thought was one of the best I had in town.  Unfortunately, yesterday, not so good.  I had ordered linguini with clam sauce and better half had spaghetti and meatballs.  My linguini came to the table ( which was unstable with cardboard under the legs) with no utensils, no garlic knots and a cup of water which was at least 85 degrees in temp with no ice.  The linguini had a very yellow sauce, which to me tasted like chicken base with lots of lemon and an abundance of oregano.  Not much garic and absolutely no taste of wine.  Furthermore, when they brought the garlic knots out, originally the helper in the kitchen was going to slap them on our plate the from stainless steel bowl he tossed them in until the owner told him to plate them.  They had very little garlic flavor, but alot of greasyness to them.  My husbands spaghetti and meatballs arrived again without utensils.  Spaghetti was overcooked and the meatballs were hard, dry and really did not taste very good.  The plate came with two meatballs, yet the picture on their menu clearly shows 3 meatballs.  A little deceiving.  The facility appeared to need some attention, with the shelf items, like lady fingers, pasta and some tomato goods had dust on them and appeared neglected.  As we live as far south in vegas as you can get, I can say I don't think we willl go back there again.  Sorry.

4492029,2012-07-02,0,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"First of all, I need to say that I love sandwiches...like really good sandwiches. You would think that a sandwich is something so simple that you could get a great sandwich just about anywhere, but nothing could be further from the truth.

So today was a sandwich kind of day. And, I came to yelp for recommendations. 2 stood out. Heidi's on Charleston & Rocco's on Buffalo.

For whatever reason we chose Heidi's, but when we got there they were closed on Sundays. I have a bit of a pet peeve about this. First of all, this is not 1950's suburbia this is Las Vegas in 2012. WHO is freakin' closed on Sundays?!?!? Second of all, it's a stupid business move especially for a restaurant...people eat on Sundays, Heidi!

So, we crossed our fingers and headed to Rocco's hoping they weren't as backward as Heidi's. And, they were open!

I don't know if it's an East Coast thing or a North East thing, but I like when I am greeted when I come in, but not pressured to decide what I want, and yet you are still there in the background to answer any questions I may have. Like, I want you friendly & courteous, but not too friendly & courteous. It's a delicate balance that few ever achieve, and yet Rocco's did!!

You order at the counter and then they bring it to your table. My only complaint is that I had to look at Yankees pennants while I ate, and I am from Boston (read Red Sox fan).

They had an all you can eat special that included pasta, salad, garlic bread, pizza, soda, etc for around $11, but we came for sandwiches!! I got the pastrami/corned beef and my husband got the Philly cheese steak. He said his was good. I can tell you mine was fabulous. Seriously, the best sandwich I have had in ages and definitely the best pastrami I have had EVER (great bread, lean meat, cheese was melted, slightly warmed). We also, got a cannoli & a brownie to go. Everything came to $27 for 2 of us, but I will get at least 3 meals out of my giant sandwich!!

Heidi's loss is definitely Rocco's gain. We took a to go menu and are already planning what we want to try next time. Pizza and chicken parm are high on the list, but it is going to be hard to not order the pastrami sandwich again.

Rocco's may not look like much, but the food is authentic and amazing! And, truly worth a try...",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,0,0,5,z_xIJiAlSKP7tPWDrLoLQw

The MOST grease I've ever seen on a pizza. Covered the inside of the box and even on the bottom of the box. I don't even know how it's possible. But yes, I became very sick later that night after eating it. I couldn't even eat the cannolis, which is my fav dessert. When I did get to eat a few bites, I was even discouraged with them too. Not the same as it used to be. Changed big time within a couple years I guess. There was not anyone I recognized as an employee there so I assume that they don't care about this location anymore. I gave 2 stars because nobody should pay and even tip to get sick for a day. I doubt I'll go back after that.

4835397,2014-11-19,0,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"I have been eating at this Rocco's for 10+ years. It has gone through a number of owners and seems to have focused more on their sandwiches in the past couple of years, but during a recent visit here, I found that they can still make a pretty good pizza.

I have recently been following them on Facebook. They seem to post a lot of their daily specials there. I saw they were running a special for a $10 large cheese pizza and special priced chicken wings, fingers, and garlic knots.

I ordered the cheese and got a dozen chicken fingers for a $1 a piece.

I was afraid they would skimp on the cheese and I almost asked for extra cheese and would just pay the difference. I ended up not, and good thing I didn't. The pizza had a good amount of cheese and wasn't dry at all. The cheese was spread out to the crust, and the crust wasn't too thick. It was overall a really good pizza.

The fingers were the frozen already breaded variety. I bought them knowing this, so I won't knock it down for that reason. They were cooked all the way through and I ordered them hot. They had a good amount of sauce.

I called in my order and I was quoted for a 20 min. pick up. I arrived a little early and everything was ready to go and my order was correct. I even checked into Yelp and got some free cake pops. At the last second I also ordered some marinara sauce to dip my crust in. It had good flavor and wasn't overly sweet like some marinara can be. Just the right amount you would expect from cooking tomatoes. It also had nice chunks and bits of tomatoes.

It is always good to continually go to a preferred place to eat, and always get the same great food and service. I have brought plenty of friends, family, and co-workers here over the years, and they have always been satisfied.

I ordered the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich; they told me I could pay when I was done eating, which is a little unusual for a place that is not a traditional dine-in restaurant. It took quite some time before I finally got my sandwich, but when I finally did, it was quite large, and perhaps more importantly, delicious. I had enough left over that I had lunch for the next day too.

The pizza is fantastic by Vegas standards and even damn good by (my) picky, NY standards. I'm interested in trying the white pizza soon, since a lot of places can't pull it off (even back home!).

The rainbow cookies (for which we are fanatical) are different than what I'm used to, but having had them twice now, I'm a fan. They are a little sweeter than usual and have five layers (two are almond paste!)... Try a few! I'm getting a cannoli next time for sure, they look so good.

Rocco's has an excellent sauce, in my opinion. This is important; a mediocre sauce can ruin any pizza, sandwich or pasta. I feel safe ordering anything from their menu, and probably will order EVERYTHING, over time.

It's right by me, and for whatever reason, I finally thought I'd give it a shot. Rocco's looked like it was gonna be a legit Ny pizzeria/deli. They have a bunch of great looking pastries, and Italian dry pasta for sale amongst other things. There were lady fingers, gnocchi, pasta, olive oils, packaged pizzelles (I make that shit from scratch, FTW!), and other nice Italian items. That was the best part of Rocco's. Not many prices listed so it could be good or ridiculous, I have no clue. There was also CJ's Italian ices in their freezer. 

I was disappointed by the Garlic Knots. They didn't seem fresh by any stretch of the imagination. The white pizza was just ok. Nothing great. The cheese pie was above average for Vegas pizza. The crust was nice and fluffy but they didn't cook it much on the bottom. It needed to be rotated in the oven or cooked a little longer to get that nice golden brown on the bottom. It was more white on bottom than anything. If you order a regular pie well done here, it would probably be better. It should be golden brown on the bottom regardless when they're using a brick oven. So pro tip, get it a little well. 

The pricing wasn't outrageous and it wasn't a great deal either. I got a large half white, half cheese pie and half a dozen garlic knots and it came out to just under $20. Not terrible, not great when I didn't love the product. 

In fact the highlight of the meal was free with their check-in offer. The cannoli was the best part. It was somewhat close to an authentic New York cannoli. The cream was a little dry and the shell seemed a little stale, but in Vegas we take what we can get. Parma has better cannoli, but not many places have cannoli here, let alone have better cannoli. I'd go back and try their penne all vodka, and maybe a pizza well done. If the pasta holds up, I might bump up to 4.

Everything was so delicious! They make all of their own mozzarella in house everyday - yummmm.

Also, bonus points for having Dr. Brown's Diet Cream soda ($1.99) - Why does the rest of the world not agree with me that diet Cream Soda is the best drink ever invented? A 0 calorie dessert in a glass? UM YES. So pleased to find my favorite drink in a freaking restaurant !

We tried the garlic parmesan fries, the garlic parmesan wings and the eggplant parm pizza with sausage.  Garlic parmesan fries were ok, just nothing to get excited about.  The flavors of the garlic and parmesan just did not come through.  It was like fries topped with some garlic and a meager shake of grated cheese.  The pizza....well, I think they might want to rethink it a little.  Crust was ok, but the tomato sauce drowning it made it really soggy.  The tomato sauce was simply way too watery.  It was more like tomato puree than sauce, with no real flavor to it.  The eggplant pieces, not slices, just kinda dissolved into the oozy morass of sauce.   Rocco's uses the kind of ""sausage"" that comes out in greyish slices, not the crumbly sweet Italian sausage that I personally prefer. Not enough ricotta either.  It looked like a cheese pizza with a little bit of extra stuff strewn across. 

So, that leaves only the garlic parmesan wings....These were awesome, just all by themselves.  Unfortunately, it is apparent that Rocco's uses commercial bulk ranch dressing - you know, the overly sweet cloying type that leaves a residue on your palate.  Skip the dressing.

Now, when it comes to ""real"" pizza places (I personally put chains like Little Caesars, Pizza Hut and Sbarro in a different category altogether), I tend to be on the weary sides. There's so many places I hear about which allegedly make great pizza in town that I've been to in the past only to leave sorely disappointed. So yeah, I'm kinda afraid of trying new pizza places here. But seeing that it was free, it's not like I had anything to lose. 

I walked in and pretty much automatically fell in love with the place. It really reminded me of the Italian Delis I've seen in my travels to Chicago, NYC and San Francisco! The service was some of the friendliest I've ever encountered, and they offered you free chips (which they make in store I should add) while you wait. 

They told me it would be 15 minutes for the pizza but barely even 10 minutes had passed before I was served. Or maybe it was 15 minutes but I was too busy browsing the store and looking at the menu to notice. They had so many different types of pasta, cheese and seasonings on the shelves. In addition to the fact that they make their own bread, cookies and, as stated earlier, potato chips. If there was a produce section you could go grocery shopping here.

As for the pizza itself? Delicioso! Thin, but firm slices with a minimal grease factor, a robust sauce and a generous helping of cheese. If the cheese pizza was that good, I can only imagine what it would taste like with toppings. 

The Final Verdict

Pros: 
Authentic Italian American-style market
Contender for best pie in Vegas
Community-oriented business
Prompt and fantastic service

Cons:
Hmmm, I've got nothing

Return Factor: 10/10. Next time I'm definitely getting me a bag of those chips, a pack of those cookies and a batch of those garlic knots everyone is raving about.",h-nw7NECMw5qo1LEmpXxeQ,1,1,4,3p4PtXZG7_X9XWuJJxiqgQ

The last time I decided to go and bring a bunch of us from the office since it was my Bday...shhhhh, I didn't tell them or else I would have went bananas ordering everything in sight...uh yeah that sign and register, go ahead and throw that in the trunk, that butcher saw for sale?? 

This go around I went with the Innwood Triple Decker sandwich.  Like most NY Deli sandwiches it was packed with meat including corned beef, turkey and roast beef.  But aside from places like Bagel Cafe, where you get eye popping meat but hardly anything else besides bread.  The Innwood was served with cole slaw and Russian dressing, making it a hit.  

Portions are large and made to order fresh.  The place includes tons of ingredients and other goods that look authentic to the motherland or the East-coast.  Ever heard of Birch Beer?? This was the first place I seen it.

The staff is friendly and provide that NY feel.  The place looks like someone could get wacked at any time.  Definitely a favorite for those from the region.  So either hot or cold sandwiches, entrees, pastas, etc. are just some of many offerings.  

The deli serves fresh meats and sides as well.  Mad peeps would come in just to pick up a pound of potato salad or prosciutto.  The salads looked pretty good and what is a NY Deli without pizza?  Pizza comes out fresh made to order as well.  The only thing I suggest, get the Stromboli or pizza pre ordered, otherwise that bad boy takes a minute to get out.

I have yet to go back to try other dishes that I couldn't bang on the first couple times, let me know how they are if you tried them already.  Oh yeah, check in order gets you a free cannoli...yum.

5620415,2013-05-28,3,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"After winning a $20 gift card here via a raffle at Jaime W's Sweet Tomatoes UYE, I used the card for dinner for my son and I.  I called in an order for two regular meatball parmigiana sandwiches and an order of garlic knots and was told the order would be ready in 20 minutes, and it was.  Just driving the four miles from the shop back to my house, I could smell the sandwiches and knew that we were in for a treat.  Once I got home, my son and I were both kind of amazed at the size of our sandwiches--if these are regular size, the large size must be ginormous!  Made with Italian bread, the sandwich's meatballs were huge and covered with sauce and cheese; we dug in and, let me tell you, it was a nice, delicious mess.  There's no dainty way to eat one of these sandwiches, but why should you?  The $3.99 order of garlic knots yielded 6 knots with a side of marinara and between those and the sandwich, I could only eat half of the sandwich. Even the teen couldn't finish his; that's saying something about the size of the sub.  Not bad because now we both can experience the other halves for lunch tomorrow.
  
2 regular meatball subs + 1 order of garlic knots = $20.72, including tax.  I'm a fan, for sure.

By the way, I walked around a little before I left the deli and they have some tempting desserts on display--I'll definitely return to try the famed white pizza and some sugar.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,4,4,4,6TUm_A-Pl9NrhwhQneDK_w

5837404,2016-01-27,6,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"I was craving a Pastrami or Corned Beef Sandwich, so looked to Yelp to find me a good new purveyor of one off the Strip and where a person could dine inside.  So, after looking at some glowing reviews, off I went by myself for a heavy lunch at Rocco's.  

It took me 10 minutes to figure out how to open the cap on the Nestle Pure Life water bottle I bought here, but that was about the only snag during my visit.  I had the best of both worlds by ordering a Regular 8-inch Pastrami & Corned Beef Sandwich with Homemade Potato Chips.  Although it took awhile to get a sandwich, it was well worth waiting for.  My Regular contained about a pound of meat, and I was told that a Large yields about double that amount  What I was ultimately presented with was a nice, very soft bun filled with warm, well-mixed meats, melted Swiss Cheese, and refreshing cool Coleslaw covered by a tasty Russian Dressing.  There was no grease and both pastrami and corned beef were very lean but still moist.  The sandwich was truly excellent, and I devoured every morsel!  It really didn't need any mustard after all.  The Potato Chips were good, but next time I will order the French Fries, which looked even better.  

There is no waitstaff here but one receives very good friendly and personal service from the lads behind the counter, including a knife and Spicy Mustard furnished quickly upon request.  Most staffers did not know the price of this Italian deli's products well, which were not marked.  So the prices had to be looked up on the cash register.  Most packaged and canned food items on display (e.g., sardines, pastina, and canneloni beans) that I inquired about turned out to be priced at $3.99, which is rather steep.  But no one twisted my arm to buy anything, and there is something to be said for the convenience of picking up some original made in Italy treats.  So, I purchased a box of pastina.  

A yelp check in here can yield some complimentary dressed up Doughnut Holes, which I think is a generous gesture by the business.  But just before I left, I saw one of the employees behind the counter lick his finger after sampling a pastry treat.  Then he opened the register with the same hand.  So there is room for some improvement in hygiene here.  But the pastrami and corned beef are ample cause to lure me back, and I highly recommend this place to all pastrami and corned beef aficianados.  Fetching-looking fresh baked goods beckon for those with a sweet tooth as well!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,8,7,4,OPMMg7sOj2Qe24dvLkiqiA
5850617,2015-04-24,0,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"My friends and I ate at Rocco's NY Italian Deli last night at my suggestion. The results would best be described as mixed. The cheese pizza looked really good to me (I've been pleased with it before) and my friend enjoyed it. The meat Stromboli was a hit but the veal parmesan sandwich received so-so reviews, mostly for the soft crust bread. I decided to try the Rigatoni Zingaro which had favorable on line reviews but was very disappointed. The sauce was fine, the cherry peppers and mushrooms flavorful but the sausage was fair at best and the rigatoni was way overcooked. The pasta was so soft it tore apart as I tried to lift it with my fork; not the way pasta should be served. Based on a sample size of one I would not recommend a pasta dish but the sandwiches and pizza have been consistently good over the years. The service was friendly and fine.",SAdmlwTOxA9p-1GLamEssw,1,0,3,eP_D9x2tFBCNXlo0fKz-yQ

The meatball sandwich was good but eating in a dirty surrounding takes the joy out of it.  The cashier didn't know what she was doing, the floors, bathroom, and tables were dirty and while you sat there you looked at dirty refrigerator doors.
YUCH!  Its an example of poor management.  They used to be a good thing but when they expand to 3 locations they try to live off of an old reputation that just doesn't exist any longer.",7l1Wy8Lh5wKVhIT3G4mPVQ,0,0,2,IEUNIy90uzEgvX413tEh2Q
5911090,2017-11-15,0,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"10/10 Italian place!!! It may look small and more like a deli than a restaurant but the food is top notch. I got the rigatoni zingara, it has a little kick which I love and was just plain delicious. I would have no qualms about stating that it was the best pasta dish I've ever had. I did a carry out order and they jam packed my dish with pasta, didn't skimp out on the sausage or mushrooms and the sauce was perfectly spiced, noodles cooked perfectly. It came with 3 delicious garlic knots - all for $14. I ordered a side salad for an extra $2 and treated myself to a cannoli which is believably homemade. Definitely the best cannoli I've eaten with the perfect amount of sweet, smooth cream inside a perfectly thick and crunchy shell. Just the entree itself was enough to easily split into two and fill up each person. With the salad and cannoli, I had to break the meal up into three different sittings because it was so much. I will surely be coming back to this place and recommend it to everyone. Since it is a deli you can even buy cannolis right as you walk in or any other pastry as well as other random authentic imported Italian goodies like loaves of bread, tomatoes, and olive oil. Can't wait to come back and try out something new!!!!",sKJPDdCvmiCqkMnIqQEhGQ,0,0,5,3WG9oPh1Dhgl2irhHetDjg
5918530,2012-02-11,0,OUP9dy2eu_-2Mga3DpSFfQ,"This is an Italian deli that serves Italian food.  I read a few fellow Yelpers reviews and spotted the occasional check-ins which stoked my curiosity to eventually try it for myself.  If you are expecting a nice, polished eatery, this is not it.  But they do have a good selection of cured sausages, prepared sides, and serve a menu of traditional Italian fare.  Including a very mean Lobster Roll.

That was what I ended up ordering based on the reviews I read, and it was very satisfying.  The bread roll that it was served in was nothing special, but the lobster filling was hot and delicious.  I also ordered the Rice Ball to go, as it was close to their closing time.  That was just okay.

Anyway, I know I have to go back and try their White Pizza.

Ambiance:  3/5  It is what it is. A deli with a few tables and chairs.

Food:  4/5  Lobster Roll is delicious, not so much a fan of the Rice Ball.

Parking:  4.5/5  In a strip mall with a lot of businesses, plenty of spaces.

Service:  3.5/5  Took the order correctly, served the food when it was done.  What else do you want from deli?",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,2,4,1gJbJ_01JuzTJhdS1pMB4A

We started with the pizza that was really good (they have unique offerings for toppings), and delivered timely and hot. They are our go to for pizza (delivery and pick-up). 

Most recently was one of those nights where everyone wanted something different. Rocco's has a full menu to choose from. We ordered a gnocchi dish, pasta with sausage, a cold deli sandwich (they make their own bread), and a great salad with a beautiful homemade ranch dressing. We have also had their tirimasu...loved it!

We have not ordered something we wouldn't order again. Everything has been surprisingly good, and we feel lucky to have them so conveniently located and reasonably priced. You can't go wrong with Rocco's.",zXgALbTLFri-bUFkOLkPKw,0,0,5,8wRQKmDkSLkJsqQ1rEGwcw
