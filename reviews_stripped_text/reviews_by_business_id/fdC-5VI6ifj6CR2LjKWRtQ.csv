248966,2017-05-05,0,fdC-5VI6ifj6CR2LjKWRtQ,Very disappointed this morning. We had breakfast here beside the Pool and I must say it was not a good experience. Very poot customer Service and not customer oriented. Then coffee came and they only give sweetened milk- no creamer avail. Not worth the wait.,T7WhXuMFry6aIHNxx1wv1A,0,0,1,zc3U68aWBNzp85O7shsVWg
1620312,2011-10-25,0,fdC-5VI6ifj6CR2LjKWRtQ,"AWESOME! We had a lot of fun up here.  My group stayed at the Stratosphere recently and we obviously had to go check out the pool area.  It was so nice up there; the sun was perfect it was like they strategically placed us there and time stood still.  

We actually came twice but this didn't exist so I had to add it to the directory to check in here.  I was shocked it wasn't already listed!  I searched but found nothing but that's okay.  Here now.

The bar area is small, maybe about 10-15 chairs but the service is good there.  I got a garden California salad with the chicken it was delicious.  De-lish! Whoa!  And I had our kind bartender whip me up a special frozen long island, yum.. it went away too quick. Prices were about right for what I was getting the salad was $10 and the drink was $9 and then taxes.

They also had a server walking around for people; we chose to go to the bar though.  Even though it wasn't terribly busy with people, she was busy with the people she had, which was fine for us.

The entrance is either through the hallway down floor 8 or from the casino on the left there at the entrance.  You can get a towel up there and the pool is pretty large, the hot tub is oddly shaped though.  I took a bunch of photos but I felt like a weirdo trying to take a picture of the pool as you could imagine why.  

Tons of chairs available, some private tents and you can see the top of the Stratosphere where the jumper people are and the view is pretty neat.  I didn't have to use the restrooms but I'm sure they were alright, there were a lot of cleaners around with laundry bins and such. 

I definitely recommend this spot to soak up some sun in the afternoon and recoup after a night of drinking!",fxqvyXlml4400BglsxRG_w,5,0,5,rcelV5RAAPNZdZLo1nzFZQ

He has a great personality and was so helpful. He gave us tips on where to eat and where to hang out while we stayed here!",a312tRouWyFDdkO_KZ0DqQ,1,0,5,6u8gImIV_f7Jpip2XYbQBQ
2524937,2018-05-17,0,fdC-5VI6ifj6CR2LjKWRtQ,Nice setting and employees  although the pool was so cold you could hardly get in it. We wanted to float but nearly unbearable. Bathrooms weren't working for half the day. Good thing our room was close. Overall not the best for the money we spent on the cabana.,gngcRyGJsYztSLVDhDzNcw,0,0,2,g63vMvQ5getFI-Ai_dQkZQ
2663609,2018-05-19,1,fdC-5VI6ifj6CR2LjKWRtQ,"This place is located on the eighth floor and it is open from 9 AM to 7 PM. When they say 7 PM you better be up at 6:50 they're already telling to get out. Don't be like me and come at 6:30 thinking that you can really stay a long time, I learned this lesson. Lovely views! :) Makes a great Instagram post.",iY41hl-J7Nw32spi0BalUg,2,4,5,k6ABKiQg5xMLhd6SWMngrA

The customer service is exceptional as well as the food and drinks!! I come to this bar mainly because of Matt, the bartender. He is wonderful and has the best personality. He makes our visits so much fun and always remembers us!! I wish all bartenders were as awesome as he is!!!!!",RlBUB2_WrUGFZiWGx9T-uQ,2,0,5,YP4guqWUlfIriLLY62npyw

Love our private cabana! 

My daughter got to relax and watch tv in between swimming and soaking up the summer sun  

The pool was big with a volleyball net in the middle.

There was a bar that had decent prices. 

I'll be going back again soon, I really enjoyed my tome here!",zdV9SNsPQ7E7vC1nWfx_lg,8,7,5,dW352SRexTj2FXY4uH9euw
3875900,2014-06-07,0,fdC-5VI6ifj6CR2LjKWRtQ,This place is awesome!! So much fun! I've been here 3 times and each time is better than the last! I celebrated my bachelorette party there and it was definitely a trip to remember! Drinks are delicious and the bartenders are what really make this place so fun. Matt is the best!! Go see him when you're in Vegas! Can't wait to come back!!,FW1ahzw503cBT5FUFd-Whw,3,0,5,jMekwiwZjf_vIFKB_Q9CZw
4264141,2014-03-09,0,fdC-5VI6ifj6CR2LjKWRtQ,The pool isn't heated so it's not enjoyable to swim in this time of the year. The prices are kinda high & there are kids running around all crazy splashing everyone. The view is AMAZING! Wish the pool was heated would have given in 4 stars then.,hFy3pG3uBnWbzYk79nntVQ,0,0,3,eYw1xk5hyx9Uz4UlM27vAg
4418783,2014-08-06,2,fdC-5VI6ifj6CR2LjKWRtQ,"Level 8 heißt deshalb so, weil es sich um den 8. Stock des Stratosphere Hotels handelt. 
Und dort befindet sich der Pool des Stratospheres. Wir waren im August 2014 Gäste des Hotels und haben den Pool mehrmals besucht. Auf den Fotos der Internetseiten sieht dieser allerdings schlechter aus, als er in Wirklichkeit ist. 
Der gesamte Bereich ist recht groß und man konnte immer ein ruhiges Plätzchen finden. Liegen sind ausreichend vorhanden und Handtücher gibt es ""unbegrenzt"". Der Pool selbst ist schön groß, so dass man sich auch in den Spitzenzeiten noch wohlfühlen kann. Man blickt direkt auf den Stratosphere Tower und kann denjenigen, die sich trauen, beim Skyjump aus über 300m. Höhe zusehen. Der einzige Nachteil ist, dass es, bedingt durch die Lage im 8.Stock, keine schattenspendenden Bäume gibt. 
Allerdings hat man viele Sonnenschirme aufgestellt, die zumindest die direkte Sonneneinstrahlung etwas verringern.",kEbMsY0LNbu4VaoEAMc9tg,4,2,4,EKsZWTNvpNw0c9XImBrTvw
5370100,2014-06-07,0,fdC-5VI6ifj6CR2LjKWRtQ,Amazing! This bar has the best staff in Vegas! They remembered our group of girls from 3 years ago and we had to come stay at the stratosphere again because of the pool bar staff! Matt is the most friendly and literally makes a drink like a champ!  The pool is really enjoyable and large and not over crowded which is nice. We will be back in another 2 or 3 years to see him again!,XXUKIHYBThR0aVOmceFvGw,2,0,5,dKrWeM_tb-3LROwiEK8OWw
5408208,2016-07-04,5,fdC-5VI6ifj6CR2LjKWRtQ,"Great spot for a party. The most amazing view of the strip. And because the location isn't blocked by other large casinos we actually had a nice breeze despite the 100 plus temperature. 

We were there for an early Fourth of July celebration. Yellow Brick Road played while we enjoyed buckets of cold beer. About 9:00 was the amazing firework display. There is something to be said about not fighting the crowds and being able to just chill reclining on a lawn chair while watching the choreographed inferno above. Totally awesome!",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,7,7,5,WtsXs4Nq5cPS-C5helZRgw
5732921,2018-05-26,0,fdC-5VI6ifj6CR2LjKWRtQ,"During my 4 day vacation I experienced okay customer service from the Elation pool staff initially. During my last day (Saturday)the staff seemed a bit careless. My group sat the entire time without being approached by a waiter despite being completely visible. Thus, I approached the bar for a glass of water. I waited about 7 minutes, as there was only 1 bartender. Once he was able to serve me he approached and asked what he could get me, in which I responded ""just two cups of water"", he then went on to ask if I am 21, in which case I told him ""yes, 24."" He responded by asking for an ID. Since my ID had been at my chair, I proceeded to leave the bar. I return with my ID and a friend who also requested a glass of water. The waiter again suggested that he needed to see ID in which  I asked ""for water?"" as I handed him my ID. He then says ""what does it matter? You're at my bar don't question me"".  

The poor attitude, the snarky comments, the nonchalant attitude to paying customers should not be tolerated. I hope that Ivo has better days during his employment at Fire bar--stratosphere. However, I will no longer visit this bar. 

I suppose one apple does spoil the bunch.",ot9866rTVoCXf0-00uQcDQ,0,0,2,nWxpUE0cdmM7ux-zViDBoQ
