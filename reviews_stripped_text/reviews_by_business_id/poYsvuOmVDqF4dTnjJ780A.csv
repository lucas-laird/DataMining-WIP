You're greeted with a smile and upon looking at the menu excitement builds as you can tell that this is no ordinary coffee shop. It becomes obvious that the proprietors Tiffany and Mae put a lot of effort into creating menu choices that are not only healthy, but delectable and unique. The coffee is wonderful and flavorful especially if one's tired of the over roasted bitterness of Starbucks and many others coffee. As far as the food goes I have trouble ordering anything other than either the hashtag breakfast sandwich or the mixed berry salad. My favorite smoothie would definitely have to be the kale champ as it is not too sweet and tastes incredible.  frequent this establishment as I feel others should as well. Oh yeah and if you're having a bad day you should pop in for an ice cream waffle. It makes everything better.",g6pm-eeVSCEFDLV_-6EUcA,0,1,5,hJkrgnendapqinu5vK9M7A

The staff is always friendly and before they expanded, it was the owners Tiffany and Mae working everyday and they would try to know everyone personally. The drinks and food are great but it's even better knowing you're supporting genuine people. 

If you're into coffee, they have some quality beans and drinks for you. If not there are smoothies and teas. Lots of veggie options for food, which is nice but they pretty much cater to any preference. They are from Guam, and I've found that islanders have a pallet that leans more towards sweet flavors, so expect that when ordering food lol. It's not a bad thing, you can definitely taste that a lot of their inspiration comes from their home. Food is made fresh and to order.

The two sandwiches I tried was flat out BLAND, the waffle in itself was uninspired with no actual flavor. The break-the-fast was overwhelmed by the bacon, I could not taste the cheese or egg. And the other was completely forgettable, left a ""why"" in my mouth. Why did they add two together, it tasted gross. 

Maybe I'll come back and try to test out other products they sell, see if standalone items like waffles or coffee would be a reason to comeback. But don't let the hype fool you, it's a 2 Star at BEST. And that's because of how the atmosphere felt.",jsjo7sfzB0OKMh1GGA-52Q,0,0,2,_njxcxkjRUE3fYh4VcBiEg

Tiabi gives you the option of the classic waffle (thin, round waffle) or a Belgian waffle (thick, square waffle) for the sandwiches. The classic waffle reminded me of the one at Bruxie, but the quality and service were lacking. 

I ordered the West Coast sandwich and it was decent, but I felt like it was lacking flavor and thrown together a bit sloppily. I also got the red velvet wafflenut and it was super sweet, doughy, and just seemed like it wasn't fully cooked. There were only two people working, so it took us about ten minutes to order and another 20 minutes to get our food. For the amount of customers that were there, they definitely would benefit from having another employee.

There were only two employees working there, and we understood how difficult it must be preparing for two medium sized tables, but the thirty minute wait for our food was just too long, and that ultimately contributed to my three-star review. :( 

On the other hand, I'd give the food a four. I split a West Coast and South American. I'd highly recommend the classic waffle with sandwiches instead of the Belgian! They ran out of ham for the South American, but they compensated it with bacon and chicken; it basically became another West Coast though.

So I go over from the Strip and plan to order and leave then come right back; then I was going to come back again before leaving town. Well I get there and they tell me I can't leave and come right back because it has to be on a different day or at least a few hours later. I tell them that is not ideal because it's a $40 taxi ride roundtrip from the Strip, plus that is not what the fine print says. They tell me it's up to them to determine what qualifies as a visit. I tell them that needed to be included in the fine print since they want to stick to the fine print. They said it's their decision and I can't leave and come back within a certain time period. ((So if I order something and decided it was really good and want another one, I have to wait a few hours before I can come get another one with my Groupon.

Swapping bread out with Tiabi's waffles didn't really change the overall taste of my breakfast sandwich, which contained eggs, sausage, and cheese. Their waffles aren't very flavorsome alone. I doused my order with srircha. 

Despite my table's seemingly simple wafflewich orders, we were left waiting for our food for an unreasonably long time period. There were only two people working in the shop, sharing the responsibilities of taking orders, preparing and carrying out the food, and attending to guests. Needless to say, the service was definitely lacking. One of the owners actually asked my friend and I to wait before ordering, but she completely left us hanging. There was a moderate amount of people in the shop, but it wasn't terribly busy. 

By the end, I don't think anybody in my party was super impressed with their wafflewich nor their wafflnuts, which tasted super doughy and undercooked. However, all of our meals were savory. Tiabi's sweeter breakfast choices might be a better option when ordering.",wAYR3oO-JM8yVVTMw23QgQ,0,0,2,FCIJ1FPbogQfRhiwrXgFPQ

I tried the waffle with bacon inside. When the server was getting it ready, she asked me if I wanted butter and I said no, which was okay. 
At any rate, waffle was good, bacon was crisp and I switched out the sugar free syrup for real stuff. The downside was that sadly, I was still sort of hungry but decided not to order another one :) Price is reasonable.

It had just the right about the sweetness, and the texture was a perfect balance of soft and crispy. The chicken was also moist, and I really enjoyed the whole thing. The chips are also pretty good too, which was unexpected as, again, they are just chips. 

Finally, for dessert I had the cinnamon sugar covered waffle with ice cream. It was really good. I surprisingly enjoyed my sandwich more, though, because the sandwich was more so something that I would not be able to replicate at home.

They have a Waffledilla, Guru Burger, Savory Thai Basil, and if you prefer to stick to the Classic way of having your waffle, they do offer Bananatella, Strawberry Kisses, just to name a few.

I ordered the West Coast Wafflewich ($6.75). This comes with tender chicken, Tiabi sauce, avocado, tomato, cheese, and I omitted bacon. The waffle is served crispy, the tender chicken taste like its seasoned and grilled, and I really like the flavor of the Tiabi sauce. As a side note, I can't even tell these waffles are vegan. All I can taste is how savory and delicious my wafflewich is and when I dip it with a side of syrup, it makes the meal even worth ordering for another one. 

Now one of the most popular Signature Drink is Tiff's Waffle Macchiato ($4.55), which is a blend of cinnamon, vanilla, and macchiato topped with whipped cream and a churro waffle. I ordered this as a regular size hot drink with almond milk ($0.75) and requested a light whipped cream. This drink taste incredibly good!

They also offer a V ice cream alternative). 

(4/5) I got a small pistachio latte because of my love for pistachio ice cream. It did not disappoint in terms of flavor. What brought me here, though, were the pictures of the fun drinks with waffles on them. Visual appeal simply makes everything taste better. My latte got defaulted into a to-go cup  even though I was never asked for here or to-go. I'd even set up my spot to study and my drink came after 3 others drinks so there was time to simply glance over and see I was staying (not populated at all, regardless of the three previous orders). So if you come and want a foam design, verbalize that it's for here. 

(2/5) I also got the kale chocolate chip cookie- the green cookie. I'm all about the healthy way of life but this did not make me want to stay on track. Yes, you could taste the kale. The cookie was fluffy (I'm thinking lots of flour), and had I not had my coffee I wouldn't have finished it. It wasn't sweet like a cookie, but it did remind me of a scone without the shape. I probably would have liked it if I was thinking I was getting into a scone, actually. Subbing out for larger chocolate chips would have also added to the texture in a positive way. 

I asked a lot of questions, some were answered with ""I don't know"" with no intention on finding the answer (such as when I inquired about the different types of cookies) and others were answered by the guy making the drinks. I sort of felt like an inconvenience and like I should just go and sit back down because they wouldn't elaborate much without me 'pressing.' But the cashier could be new. I don't know. 

I loved the menu. It looks really interesting and I love places that have originality. 

The restaurant didn't have a warm, cozy feel but it was nice, nonetheless. Fun, far chalk wall mural. Actually, chalk was the main art theme. I liked it. 

The music was reggae. I dig. Perhaps a little loud. Startling at times. 

Definitely give this place a try, though.",pbdjFv3bZv7J8oX5JWsIUQ,0,0,4,6NutSwXIrRyssOxRt5OZDQ

1402644,2015-02-15,0,poYsvuOmVDqF4dTnjJ780A,"SMOOTHIE IS THE BEST THING HERE......not coffee....or waffles

For a place that is specifically a coffee and waffle place... Both the coffee and waffles are not that great. The coffee is mainly milk and barely any coffee. We tried a skinny latte, iced coffee, tiffs coffee with a waffle on top. The coffee flavor is not strong at all but mainly milky ... Maybe next time we should just order black coffee. 
The waffles on the other hand are kinda soggy. They are topped with so much whipped cream and sauces that is what probably took out the good crunch in the waffle. 
The best thing at this place was their smoothies surprisingly. I would give their smoothies a 5! The Green Nut is absolutely the best smoothie ever! And it is healthy with almond and kale it is so refreshing!! I would highly recommend it to anyone. I would come here again but ONLY to get another smoothie not for anything else. 

Also there is a good groupon for this place my friend and I tried it out we each bought $24 worth at this place. But interestingly enough the Groupons  come in three separate Groupons worth $8 each. I am ok with that because we can come multiple times, but when I came with my friend he had his groupon and I had mine and they had the audacity to question us and tell us that we cannot use it when coming within ""one visit"" well he bought his separate and I bought mine. It is a different transaction who cares it is also separate visit because it is his visit, then my visit. 
Also,what if I wanted to use my second groupon would it be considered a ""different visit"" if I walked out the door then came back in? They are sticklers about this rule so if you bought a groupon then watch out they are going to grill you about it!",LwvOw1HzaksABlrypcO3-w,0,0,2,iN9HMPDBEj6nB87KqoR8NQ

1432113,2014-09-23,7,poYsvuOmVDqF4dTnjJ780A,"Bought the groupon so I had the opportunity to check out this spot 3 times. Suffice to say, after all 3 visits, I thought that it was OK.

I guess that this place focuses mainly on waffles used in a traditional sense, with sweet toppings, as well as savory preparations, such as using a pair of waffles as a bun for a sandwich.

First off, I would say that using the groupon was pretty difficult here. I had 3 of them, good for $8 to spend. The waffles ranged from 5-6 dollars, and the coffee drinks ranged from 4-5. You do the math. I think it would have been better to offer 2 $5 for $10, instead of the 3 $4 for $8.

The good news first. The fillings and toppings they use are great! For the hashtag breakfast sandwich, the egg and turkey sausage was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. For the Tokyo sandwich, the chicken was moist and tender, and the veggies were very fresh. The sauces they use are well balanced, the sweet ones aren't too sweet, and the savory sauces are packed with flava!

The bad news. I hated the waffle. I've tried both the thin waffle they use for sandwiches, and the thicker Belgium style one. My conclusion is that I frankly don't like their waffle recipe. They both had a strong metallic taste that resonated the more I ate it. This happens when I eat biscuits or other quick breads that use too much leavening, such as baking powder. This may be the culprit. The interior of the waffle is pretty doughy as well. 

Also, it took a little longer that I though it would to receive my order. On my last visit, I ordered a waffle sandwich, lolly waffle, and small hot coffee, and I timed them at 16 minutes. It would be better than to rather than to stack 3 separate customer orders at the same time, it's better to do one order at a time, because the 2 other people received their orders 1 minute after mine was ready :/

The coffee is ok but pricy for the portion size. The employees are nice and friendly, but also they seem to be easily distracted.

Wasn't the worst waffle, but not the best. Slightly middle of the pack is where I would put them. If you are in the mood for a savory waffle sandwich, this place would be the place to go because no one else in town is doing it (RIP Bread and Butter). Liked everything 'cept for the waffle itself.

Customer service was awesome. After greeting us, the cashier noticed that we were probably new to the place, so he told us a little about the ordering process and menu (regular items, faves, and seasonal specials). Pretty chill and nice guy. 
The sister ordered the Halloween-themed menu for a waffle and a cold latte. Mom ordered a Halloween-themed hot latte with a West Coast Wafflewich.

A very pleasant and nice staff with reasonably priced items.  

The Bad
The food and the wait. My wife ordered the banana Nutella waffle which came out first and the waffle was overcooked and very dry. The Nutella was flavorless and limited as it was drizzled on. My only other experience to compare this type of waffle with was at Disneyworld and there waffle was moist, soft and warm with the Nutella adding a great accent. 
I ordered the hashtag waffle and a banana Nutella for me. The hashtag was again an overcooked, dry and burnt in some areas waffle with turkey sausage that tasted like they came out of the frozen foods section at Von's supermarket.  Completely flavorless. The egg that came with it I cannot not even explain what it looked like.  My banana Nutella waffle did not even look like my wife's as by the time I got it I was told they were having issues with there waffle maker. It reminded me of one my 12 year old made me for Father's Day. 

The Ugly
Due to technical problems everything took twice as long as long as it should.  I even saw A gentleman get up who had been waiting there before us asking why was it taking so long for his food.  For my inconvenience of waiting so long they offered me a cookie. At that moment they should've offered to discount my food at least. 

One of the things I hate having to do on a yelp review is do a negative review. Hopefully, for others they will not receive this type of food or delay.

Hashtag waffles - I have to assume they were excellent.  The kid devoured both of them in addition to the fruit toppings they came with.  This was the first time ever she finished an adult sized meal by herself!

Hashtag breakfast sandwich - This was good - the standard eggs and sausage.  If it was a runny sunnyside egg, that would have been much better.   I'd probably pass on this one to get a...

West Coast Wafflewich - now this  was a good combination of flavor and texture.  Put bacon and avocado on anything and you have a winner.

I guess their exterior signage is still being developed, because right now there's just a tarp printed with ""Coffee & Waffles"".

Went in and there seemed to be some sort of lounge affect going on. I made my way around a group of women clustered near the entrance talking, perused the posted menu, then stood behind a guy chatting at the front counter for a good five minutes before the woman he was speaking to realized I was a paying customer, and said she'd help me. 
I find it a little tacky that the employee (who seemed to be one of the co-owners) was not more attentive to the fact that I was waiting in line to place an order.
As it is, she excused herself in such a way that I felt I was inconveniencing her. 

Regardless, I ordered a skinny vanilla latte- originally planned on getting a sandwich, but it seemed this would have really been a problem to her, so I just stuck to the drink. It was tasty, even if the foam was overflowing along the lip of the lid.

Found a table of samples toward the back as I waited for my drink- the cinnamon sugar waffle and the bacon-cheddar waffle were both really flavorful, though the former was nice and crisp while the latter was more on the limp and soggy side. 

Location seems like it'll be good for students, and they seem to have a lock on the niche market- doubt bistro waffles are offered anywhere else nearby. Hope they succeed, maybe I'll be back when they work out the kinks- namely waiting for the novelty of business ownership to wear off enough for them to prioritize customer service.

Tiabi Coffee and Waffle is a rather unique counter-serve waffle place in Las Vegas. Located at 3961 South Maryland Parkway, it is at the Mission Center just north of the main UNLV campus. This place has some appealing waffle options that are different from what you'd expect elsewhere.

This spot focuses heavily on unique waffle creations. These include traditional waffles as well as some sandwiches that use waffles.

A Different Approach

Tiabi Coffee and Waffle is a contemporary dining spot that offers various types of waffles. It has many vegan food options and plenty of different coffee choices. It was established in 2013 and continues to be an entertaining place for waffles.

This spot has a rather modern look that isn't too unique or different. Still, it is an intriguing place to visit. It has a friendly look to it that stands out as an inviting spot for all members of the family.

What Does It Take To Get Waffles?

The food here at Tiabi is excellent but it can take a while to get. We waited about twenty minutes to get our food. However, we assume that this is because the food is so intricate and designed with an immense approach to detail.

The people here are friendly and do well with getting orders down. They always ensure that the food is made precisely as desired. The fact that these people can work with vegan requests if desired is an attractive point too. It ensures that people can get a great waffle even if they have particular limits on what they will eat.

Great Foods All Around

The foods here start with plenty of great signature beverages. Tiff's Waffle Macchiato has cinnamon vanilla macchiato with a churro waffle and whipped cream. This has a brilliant design that is creamy and detailed.

The Stiles Java Jolt has a vanilla breve misto and vanilla with a bit of extra espresso. This adds an extra amount of caffeine to create a good taste. Various frappes and teas are all around the place too.

The creative nature of this place is particularly highlighted in the waffle sandwiches it offers. The Waffledilla features chicken, Tiabi sauce and melted cheese and an optional avocado. This is carefully made with waffle patties to establish a great flavor all around.

The classic options here are interesting to see as well. The Strawberry Kisses waffle mixes sliced strawberries with a chocolate drizzle. The Viva Las Elvis waffle has bananas and peanut butter plus chopped bacon. A bit of honey is added to create a stronger flavor too.",UvOcfMJOlwu-nE6IEspA-Q,2,3,5,GhiInc3ExZkzpqSxfA9kdg

Even worse was watching the cook literally man handle every waffle that came out. Hopefully his gloves aren't latex because he would send anyone with a latex allergy to the hospital with his pulling waffles hot from the iron off with his fingers and then flipping the waffle between both hands then shoving them back on to the iron if he decided it wasn't dark enough. Despite the constant fiddling my waffle still managed to come to me cold.  It couldn't even melt the butter on it.

Flavor wise its not worth anything. My mocha was so over chocolated that the only flavour from the coffee was a bitter under note.  As for the waffle it was so nothing I might as well have had an eggo or poured bisquick shake and pour into my waffle iron 

Oh, and they no longer offer Belgian waffles.

1. Do you like food? If not, this isn't the right place for you. Actually, you should probably go to the hospital (please see my Yelp! reviews on my favorite hospitals)
2. Do you like food that tastes delicious?
3. Do you like breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner? Do you like smoothies? Do you like coffee?
4. Are you a vegan? If not, are you an omnivore?

If you answered yes to all of those questions, then you will probably love TIABI. Waffles are cooked to a perfect texture that's not so chewy/thick that you want to die halfway through. All of the smoothies are delicious (my personal favorite are the Health Nut and the Avocado, but you do you). Breakfast, lunch, and casual dinner options. Additionally, very extensive vegan menu.

Out of all the kale drinks I have tasted and tried theirs was by far the best and I literally had it every other day. Today though, years later, my bf went to pick one up for me. 

When I first saw it my initial reaction was that it looked more green than usual. And then when I tried it, it was definitely NOT the kale champ I knew and loved.

Waffle breakfasts, waffle sandwiches, waffle coffees. We went here in the afternoon when it was slow; no lines and plenty of staff running around. My party ordered three food items and three drinks. The first two waffles came out in about 10 minutes. The third took 30 MORE MINUTES. The first two were done with their meals (and then drinks) before the last waffle came out. There were three staff members basically standing around looking at the waffle makers. No one looked like they were in a hurry to get our food out. There was no apologies or anything as to why the food took 40 minutes after ordering to be prepared. 

The food and drink were good once they were out, but I expect a business, whose sole food item is waffles, to be able to put out items in a reasonable amount of time. I suggest they order an extra waffle maker (or dozen) so this isn't a hamper on their business anymore.

I would always go to the target in the same plaza and Sakana sushi right next to it, so I always saw Tiabi's sign... I just never actually went in until a few weeks ago! Since then I've been addicted and wish I walked in to try it sooner! 
So far I've tried the Break Your Fast, Hashtag Breakfast Sandwich, Tokyo Sandwich, Guru Burger, and the churro waffle as well as the Honey Cream Latter, Lavender Latte, and my favorite yet - the Pistachio latte!! I am seriously addicted. 

Needless to say, customer service is amazing. The staff are all so welcoming and kind. 

As for the food.. The way they make their waffles is so different than I'm used to. They're thinner than typical fluffy waffles, which give their sandwiches the perfect crunch and texture! I assumed the waffle sandwiches would be soggy, but they weren't at all. Also, for the dessert waffles, the waffles have the perfect texture. While the outside is crispy, the inside is still quite fluffy despite how thin it is! Specifically for the churro waffle, the cinnamon sugar was not at all too strong, it was perfect.. Not too sweet and not at all lacking flavor. Also don't be shy about trying out any of their waffle sandwiches, at first I was skeptical because I've never tried a waffle sandwich, but each one I've tried have been really good. Tiabi puts flavors and items that really compliment each other. I don't even know what their Tiabi sauce consists of, but it's a great flavor in many of their items. 
Okay now for the drinks... If I had to single out my ultimate favorite Tiabi menu item I would have to say 100% the PISTACHIO LATTE. Hahaha. The staff must think I'm crazy because I've been coming back so many times for that drink. I get it hot with soy and ahhh it's literally heaven. It's so good that I make any of my friends around me to try it and each one of them were in love too. It's so silky with that perfect flavor of pistachio - seriously spot on pistachio! I have also tried the Lavender Latte and the Honey Cream Latte, which are good as well, but no where near the pistachio latte! Hahah

So by my review I think it's only obvious that I'm in love with this little whole in the wall and would recommend anyone to stop by. Aside from their food and drinks options, the little cafe itself is so adorable!! The decorations are cute and it's so cozy to do homework/study or even hang out with friends. Even though it's a bit small, they actually have plenty of tables/seats and even a cozy couch! Plus each table has a deck of cards and they also offer of board games for people to play as well.

Pros
From a very quirky minimalist design that makes the very industrial space feel like a cozy coffee shop. 
The Coffee is very good, one of the 5 best coffee shops I've tried in Vegas and I try a new coffee shop almost every Saturday.
The Waffle based food is delicious and unique
The Staff is super friendly
Meeting people in the social collision area of the shop makes meeting new people super easy!

Cons
It's location is kind of hard to find.
It doesn't have enough space to accommodate it's rush
There is no bicycle parking

Overall, everything that Tiabi can control is really really well executed, the things beyond their control they've done a great job of mitigating.",8JbYhxaGLVdFe8fwBOKGhg,0,1,5,XcKCAmDTWggkdzmvu_eXJQ

I'll start by saying I liked the snickers thing. But then I have to move into the bad part. 
They seem to use the same waffle mix for their sweet and savory waffles. What does this mean? It means my breakfast was too savory and my lunch was too sweet. And I was very bummed. I swear, I wanted to like it. I might even try it again some day, in hope of a good wafflewich. But it fell short.

Although there is a chalkboard menu on the wall grab a menu to get the full details of the items. Order your food at the counter. Ordering was slow when I went, but hopefully will get better with time. Then find your own seat. I would recommend ordering 2 wafflewiches since they do not come with sides (besides chips) or adding items to your sandwich to make it bigger. They are petit. Here's what we ordered:

Break the Fast Wafflewich- The actual waffle is delicious. I like that it's a little sweet. It's also a harmonious texture combo- sturdy and moist. Inside were scrambled eggs, thin bacon, and cheese. The items inside were sparse and the bacon was the thin kind. The price is right (about $5), but I would gladly pay more for a fuller sandwich. I think next time I will ask for extra eggs and maybe avocado on the side.

B.A.T Wafflewich- Same great waffle housing bacon, arugula, tomato, and a delicious sauce. We also wished this sandwich was fuller. The tomatoes were great. I bet this one would be great with avocado.

Regular Coffee- I drink mine black. This coffee was a-ok and came in a to go cup.

Iced Americano- Also a-ok and definitely caffeinated.

I'll definitely be back now that I have a better idea of what to order. Businesses in this area need our support so give Tiabi a try.",mxwMqra7TEZ6K4ML3DgPmA,5,5,3,_ZvC9AxElLvHtI4CUCeA0w

2548907,2016-09-26,0,poYsvuOmVDqF4dTnjJ780A,"OK, this is a lengthy review.  here's a summary:  The wait is FOREVER.  If you're disabled or in a hurry, skip it.  If you're fully-abled with plenty of time on your hands, Tiabi is probably worth the wait.

Now for the actual review:

This place is very popular - there wasn't an empty seat in the house.  This is a problem for me as I'm disabled.  I was feeling halfway decent today and decided to take my daughter out for a (long overdue) mommy/daughter date, since I don't get to do that very often.

We went inside and stared at the menu for a few minutes.  It's big and on the wall near the front of the store, which is convenient.  After deciding what we wanted, I walked around to find the area for placing an order.  There are 3 sections where the counter is open, so they all appear to be there for communicating with the people behind the counter.  After examining the other items at the counter (there's stuff everywhere), however, it wasn't obvious where to stand to place an order.  One of the staff members saw the lost look on my face and directed me to the right place.  Once there I noticed an ipad on the counter which I assume they use to take orders.

We moved to the appropriate counter spot (which is at the front of the store, by the menu), and then waited to be helped.  I was able to wait for 10 minutes, but that's when my back issues kicked in.  In that time, we were given an apology, but no other eye contact or acknowledgement.  I got the impression that they were overwhelmed and didn't WANT to take anymore orders.  I've worked in retail and food service, so I know how that that is.  It was probably a blessing that they didn't take my order, as I wouldn't have been capable of standing around much longer to wait for the food.

In their defense, all 3 employees were shuffling around and working very hard.  The place was just seriously understaffed.  They could've used AT LEAST 2 more people today.  Since my back issues don't allow me to stand for extended periods of time, I hate to say that I won't be able to return to this establishment.  For anyone in the same boat - having limited physical abilities - I'd suggest ordering Tiabi for delivery if you live close enough, or just try a different waffle bar.  The one at Tivoli has plenty of seating and wasn't busy when I went.

I was very disappointed.  My young daughter was VERY excited to try some new and desserty waffles.  It kills me to get that far into the process, only to break her heart and go somewhere else.  It also sucks because I'm usually in too much pain (or too medicated) to even leave the house.  So when I do leave the house, every minute counts and is very special to me.  Don't take your good health for granted!!!!!!!!

Not entirely related, but worth noting:  Across the street from Tiabi, the wash runs between Toys R Us and Seafood City.  This part of the wash spawns a lot of water pokemon, which are hard to find elsewhere in the desert.

I kinda wish I could leave a review without giving a star rating.  Although I couldn't try the food, it's obviously good.  They wouldn't have been that busy if they weren't doing something right.  I just REALLY REALLY REALLY wish the owners would staff it better, or maybe expand or something.  We aren't all fully-abled college students with the ability to wait around all day.  I also want to mention that I'm NOT the type of person who expects everyone to cater to ME and my specific needs.  My belief - no matter what side of the counter I'm on - is that if your customers are important to you, you don't make them wait more than 2 minutes to be rung up.",elektz6cHmiFgfXmid-xiA,1,0,2,toKtrO2pMGzsrjKlOwEdhQ

It's a small order at the counter type of place, but everything is reasonably priced (use a Yelp! check-in to get 15% off, or UNLV students get a discount as well!)  The special here is waffles done in all sorts of ways (with toppings, or as a sandwich in some cases).  

I went with a waffle with almonds, bananas and Nutella on it for about $6.  The taste of it was OK, presented and cooked well, but nothing too special about the batter.  The disadvantage was it took what seemed like forever to get it (maybe just because I was hungry?).  I also got a hot chocolate which was just so-so.

I decided I needed a pick-me-up and Tiabi popped up on my coffee radar (the yelp app) and I headed that way. As I parked my car and walked towards the door, I became skeptical about this place considering this neighbor can be non-friendly at times. I walked in and did the classic Hanna-Barbera/ Scooby Doo surprised look. This place was clean, inviting, and I was greeted with a giant smile and brief intro on the place. Great way to start my waffle fueled experience.  

I ordered the, ""West Coast Waffle Wafflewich"" and the ""Stiles Java Jolt"". The ""West Coast"", I was told is the fan favorite and if you read what I wrote above, that's easy to believe. This sammie is big, about half the size of an average dinner plate. The tasty ingredients are added to the savory waffle, then folded over to immediately give you this pocket-like snack item. As I ate, I was afraid of two things; all of the food falling out of the opposite biting side, and a weird sweet waffle paired with cheese. My fears waffled away as the crunch of the bacon filled my ears, the tender & juicy chicken, cheese, and veggies came together in the warm waffle. This sandwich was fantastic, and turned out to be one of those food items you realize you haven't put down since the first bite. This Wafflicious sammie was paired with seasoned homemade waffle chips. Fantastic mutated breakfast/ lunch combo.

The Stiles Java Jolt was delicious. Espresso, coffee, and just a tad of vanilla flavoring. I went half on the flavoring, because I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but Normally it comes with four pumps of vanilla. I could have drank two more of these delicious caffeinated bullets, but then I might turn into Spider-Man and climb the walls.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,11,10,5,OKRSsbgZrd6PNzEgY8Yauw

Located in the shopping center on the corner of Maryland Pkwy & Flamingo with the Target, next to Sakana. Clean and spacious on the inside and I like that they had playing cards on the tables, feels like a place you could spend an hour or two catching up with friends.

I was pretty surprised at how large their drink and food menus were! They have coffee based drinks, frappes, smoothies, teas, and other non-coffee drinks. Cool selections like Red Velvet, Chocolate Coconut, Honey Cream Latte, Java Jolt, Kale Smoothie & Raspberry Lemonade! Tons of different options! My boyfriend and I settled on the Chocolate Coconut Latte and non blended White Chocolate Tuxedo. The Coconut one had some coffee but I'm pretty sure the White Chocolate one didn't. Great flavors but I was expecting them to be more coffee based. The White Chocolate Tuxedo tasted Iike a World Class Chocolate ice cream shake from Baskin Robbins! Both super tasty and an amazing price at $3.75 & $4. Score!

Now the food items! Waffles, waffle sandwiches, salads and desserts! I was also pretty suprised at the amount of vegan items they had! I think I counted about 9 options for food, Awesome! We settled on the West Coast waffle sandwich. Oh and all waffle sandwiches can be substituted with ciabatta bread. It came with chicken, tiabi sauce (vegan aioli), avocado, bacon, cheese and tomato. I was expecting some tiny thing but it was kind of around the size of a 6 in' sub. And for $5.99! Perfect! The waffle was nice and fluffy, had great flavors, and filling!

Our bill for the three items was $17.84 (including tax & 20% tip)! I will definitely be back especially since it's near UNLV. Thank goodness as I was getting tired of all the Chipotle-styled bowl & burrito places. Yummo!",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,9,5,4,M93y1BlXgBCOeJ8ycqQX7A

She attempted to make me get the Halloween waffle, but I did not want that. I requested the same style of the Belgian pumpkin order in a regular waffle style since they could not accommodate what was on the menu. She began to harp on charging me for glazed pecans because that  was how the original came. I told her why would she charge me considering they could not provide what was on the menu? She began discussing that the pecans cost $, and had an attitude the entire time. Also, we almost choked on smoke inhalation.

I guess if you view it as a coffee shop first and a waffle shop second it's not so bad but I think most people that want breakfast want more options than just waffles. I tried the pistachio latte and build your own red velvet waffle with Thrifty ice cream and fruit. My boyfriend had an iced Americano and the bacon waffle sandwich. 

I was surprised to see that the coffee came in to-go cups even for a dine in order and I heard the couple behind me remark about the same thing. I guess if their menu shows pictures of fancy lattes with designs in a mug, that's what I expect to get. Regardless of presentation the coffee was quite good. I asked for skim milk and assuming they still used skim milk I found the latte to be very creamy with a nutty pistachio flavor that wasn't fake or overpowering. 

As for the waffles... they're just waffles ya know? My boyfriend's breakfast sandwich was pretty bland. If he hadn't added bacon to it it would have just consisted of scrambled eggs and shredded cheese. Adding the bacon added a bit of flavor but without drenching it in syrup it didn't taste like much of anything. Plus think about the texture of a waffle and scrambled eggs.. bacon is pretty much necessary for a crunch factor. My waffle was a little better, it had a bit of crunch on the edges and the red velvet was rich and gooey in the center. My favorite part was definitely the Thrifty ice cream though. I had a choice of strawberries and/or bananas for the fruit and I just got the strawberries. Overall it was a bit of a sugar overload and I can't see myself eating here very often if at all. Prices are definitely a little steep for what it really is. Not understanding the hype of this place at all.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,0,1,3,jdrVQdhzIbmLm9Hbb4M92A

No matter how many people are here, be prepared to wait a looooooong time to get any food or drink. The restaurant itself reeks of old oil or some sort of thick grease smell that stays in your hair and clothes for hours after you leave.

Took 25 minutes to finally get my Tiff's Waffle Macchiato with a kind of cold, moderately crispy churro waffle. The drink itself was sweet and tasty, and the whipped cream is quite thick. But 25 minutes for a drink?? Way too long. 

10 minutes later, got the Red Velvet waffle w/ whipped cream, strawberries, and bananas. Boyfriend ordered the Waffledilla w/ avocado. Although good, it looked and tasted like something I could easily make at home in half the time.

People who came in after we ordered would order food to go and get it in 10 minutes or less. Some would then sit and eat inside. Maybe the key here is to order your food to go regardless of eating there or actually taking your food to go?

3099048,2015-11-09,0,poYsvuOmVDqF4dTnjJ780A,"Used to love this place. The food tastes delicious and they have wifi, so I can study here. I introduced many of my family and friends to this place.

That being said, the service is below average. Not only is the wait time long (they only had 2 or 3 waffle makers, understandable bc they're a small mom and pop shop which I loved), but the owner/worker takes customer requests and suggestions personally. I asked for strawberries and Nutella on my waffle, as I always ordered it. When I received it, there were no strawberries. I hate to complain about food bc they have the power to spit in it when you're not looking, but I thought they'd be ok with me asking since I'd been there several times previously. When I asked, they took a few minutes and handed over a small bowl of sliced strawberries. I thought they were going to add it to my plate, so I brought it up to the counter. When she saw I did this, she grudgingly said,""Oh, you wanted ME to put those on there?"" I replied that I could do it, a little embarrassed. 

The reason this was a red flag for me is because one of my earlier stops there, I heard the staff talking about a recent Yelp review. The review spoke of the bad service the customer received. The girl in question defended herself and stated she did nothing wrong. I didn't think anything of this the first time. A subsequent time I was there, a foreign couple (Italian accent?) was asking why their 2 waffles were not similar and if they could remake one because they enjoyed the crispier one. The same owner/worker who didn't take criticism well kept insisting that it was made the same and they just had to let it sit longer to get the crispy consistency. 

At that point, I hadn't been crossed by one of her moods yet, so I continued visiting to get my delicious coffee, waffles and to study. Then, that day hit as it inevitably would. I haven't returned since and don't intend to. Customer service is key, any business owner should know this. 

Since I know you (the owners) read the Yelp reviews, I'd like to offer up some constructive criticism: you should cater to your customers. If you take these comments personally and become defensive, your customers will only continue to be dissatisfied with your service.",UHjQYBu8OpydRFCyXkR9KQ,0,0,2,gFjk2LPQsb25cnSPrD2oGQ

Third: The service was extremely slow. A party of four ordered before us, and they received 2 of their orders in approx 10 minutes, and the other 2 orders approx 10 minutes later. The employee explained that they can only make a couple of orders at a time, and offered some cookies as consolation.
Fourth: We got our order 30 minutes after we ordered it. I had the egg, sausage, cheese waffle sandwich. The egg and sausage were heated in the microwave and tasted like rubber.
The only good things: The gentleman that made our coffees did an excellent , and the strawberries on my husband's waffles were fresh.
I spoke to the manager, explained why we were there, our experience, and that we will not be back.

It's a small cozy cafe with seating for around 30-40 people? It's super close to UNLV which makes it a prime place to go to for a coffee break and possibly to study. They do have free WiFi! And the owners are pretty cool and really nice.

I ended up getting waffles and tea, more specifically I got the vegan version of Viva Las Elvis with vegan ice cream. It's a waffle with peanut butter, honey (agave if vegan version), and coconut bacon with a scoop of ice cream on top. It was pretty good, nothing too spectacular. The peanut butter melted into the waffle which was pretty awesome, because I mean melted peanut butter on anything is delicious! And the ice cream was well vegan vanilla ice cream and wasn't too special to me. 

I'll probably not get tea again, only because it was $2 for a bag and one cup of hot water. I'm not sure if they'll give you more hot water, but one bag and one cup of water doesn't seem like it's worth it. 

My biggest gripe was that it was DIRTY. I mean the tables, I went through two tables and they were both dirty. There was dried syrup on them and stains from the last customers. I looked down to see if there were any other tables, but most of them seemed like they were dirty to me. I tried cleaning some of it off, but most of it didn't come off with a napkin and some water. That to me is disgusting especially since it seems most people leave their dishes and the owners clean it off. That's just how it looked to me, when other customers ate and then left. When I got there the whole cafe was empty but as I sat there there were people that came and go. So they didn't really have an excuse to be dirty. 

I do however want to try some other menu items the next time I go. I just hope it's cleaner this time. I like the owners, they're pretty nice to talk to. I like the atmosphere. I like the location. I like some of their food so far. But I don't like dirty tables where I'm going to eat especially at cafe/restaurants/etc.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,3,2,3,sqojD0TuwoY6MJy32jGjEQ

Add the incentive of a groupon, and I'm on it...but unfortunately, I have to say that I was slightly disappointed both times I went.

I had gone to eat here when they had opened a few months ago. I didn't particularly have an optimal experience - my boyfriend's hashtag waffles were served a little cold, and though we were the only customers there, I remember we had to wait a good amount of time for our food to arrive. I understand that this place was just starting out and just getting into the groove of things, so I chalked it up to that factor and refrained from writing a negative review. Additionally, the location is kind of sketchy, but they have no control over that really. 

Flash forward. I decided to give it another shot a few months later. I ordered a dirty mocha chai and a West Coast waffle sandwich (bacon, chicken strips, avocado, tomato and cheese), which was the same exact order I had the first time around. The sandwich is what I'm giving the extra star for. It's worth a try, pretty good. It was better this time too as far as the amount of toppings go. Very filling. 

The bad news: Service time is still pretty lousy. I even added the pre-tip in hopes of speeding up our food, but it was in vain. The employees are friendly, but I was expecting a smoother and more efficient delivery. They should train the people in charge of preparing the food a lot better. It shouldn't take long to make a waffle and add the trimmings. Especially if the trimmings don't require much maintenance and cooking at all. I'm all about trying small businesses and was really rooting for their success, but it was just disappointing to see that this place hasn't fully quite worked out its kinks yet.",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,3,1,2,TdpHrr8zRhuGQsgwDU5JJQ

On the other hand, the Break-The-Fast wafflewich ($4.95) was a complete disaster. The whole thing looked sad. The sausage was barely warm, the cheese looked like it was straight out the fridge having had no contact with any heat to melt it, and the scrambled eggs looked like prepackaged/pre-cooked eggs found at McDonald's.

Somewhere in between in quality were the two waffle dishes I tried. Ordered as a Belgian waffle, the maple bacon waffle ($5.99) was thick and soft, as expected, with large chunks of bacon in the batter. The savory and saltiness of it in combination with the sweetness of the batter and syrup made it a solid choice all around. The red velvet waffle ($5.50), ordered as a classic thin waffle, lacked any crispness around the exterior. The flavor was well balanced with a moderate amount of chocolate chips and whipped cream giving it enough sweetness without making it too overindulgent.

With classic, Belgian, and vegan waffles, specialty coffee drinks and frozen drinks, there's plenty of promise here. Unfortunately, some of the execution on my visit was lackluster. And, don't expect fast service. Even with three employees hustling in the back we waited a while for our orders despite being the first ones through the door in the morning.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,2,3,qVxf3qlyiqjeZ7ri9okRSw

3561296,2016-04-01,0,poYsvuOmVDqF4dTnjJ780A,"I found this place randomly about a year ago when I was craving some breakfast food on the way to UNLV. Just a quick search for ""waffles nearby"" and I came across this lovely gem, and boy, I am glad I did!
I've come here often enough for the staff to recognize me and have tried a number of things off their menu (and there's still plenty more to try!). I've recommended this place to people and have brought friends and family here, each trip ending up in a generally positive reaction the the food, atmosphere, and service.
The waffles and drinks offered here are numerous and delicious. From savory wafflewiches to sweet treats, theres something for just about anyone. The most popular item amongst the people I've brought here is probably the West Coast wafflewich or the Bananatella waffles. But if you can't find anything tempting on the menu or can't decide, you're welcome to create your own. And that can be anything--drinks, waffles, sandwiches, salads--if you can think it, they'll make it for you. Just to prove it, my boyfriend decided one day that adding chicken to their Bananatella would be a great idea (he's an interesting one). And while our server found it an odd request, they fulfilled it anyways. (Surprisingly, it didn't turn out that bad!) For the less daring, my personal favorite is a customization as well: the Strawberry Kisses waffle with bananas, paired with the Snickers iced coffee.
As for the place itself, the atmosphere is chill and welcoming. They have a nice rotation of music playing and a deck of cards on every table. The furnishings are quirky; tables with mismatched chairs, antique-style lights, and plenty of photographs and waffle-and-pop culture inspired paintings on the walls. It's a perfect place to eat and chat with friends or to catch up on some studying while sipping on some coffee. The servers are nice and friendly, always up to explain the menu and the new, seasonal items they're promoting at the counter (ex. Egg Nog Latte at Christmas-time or the Pumpkin Spice Waffle during the fall). The downside is that it gets pretty busy in the small space during peak lunch hours, and service can begin to get slow. The place isn't usually meant for a take-out and run, it's definitely better suited for people willing to sit, eat, and chill.
I definitely recommend this place to the Leslie Knopes of the world. In other words, it's the perfect place for a waffle-lover with time to chat.",eVe5jrj9bNIgqkgMRQsr0Q,0,0,5,KPF0bNb1eZmEc9NymxXBjw

3585601,2015-01-26,0,poYsvuOmVDqF4dTnjJ780A,"I've gone here twice now after buying a Groupon worth $8 each for three visits. My first visit was early in the morning on my way to work and I decided to try one of their lattes and salads out. I ordered the green tea latte to drink there and the kale salad to eat for lunch later on. The green tea latte was very good. The size was reasonable and the price is what's expected even without the Groupon discount. The kale salad was also very good, decently proportioned and reasonably priced. The lady that was working there was very kind and helpful. It's good to say that my first experience there was rather pleasant and I was excited to drop by again to try the waffles.

I came in the second time with my boyfriend so that we could both try the waffles. I was looking forward to purchase the red velvet waffle since red velvet is one of my all time favorite flavors lol. After ordering, I sat down and waited for our waffles to be done. I noticed an uncleaned table the table over us. This table was not cleaned the entire time we were there. Now, I used to work at a food establishment and I can be very understanding in certain situations. One, the place wasn't busy. There were probably 4 people eating including us with a few customers coming in to order. Two, there were three people in the back because I counted 2 guys and 1 lady. One of the three could have easily cleared out the table the entire time I was there. It's just professional to keep your establishment clean. The workers seemed rather distracted and too busy talking to each other rather than checking the dining area for mess.

We finally got our waffles after 15 minutes or so. I feel like that's rather a long wait for just two small orders of waffles. I ordered the red velvet one (of course) whereas my boyfriend ordered the regular golden waffles. We both agreed they were good after finishing them. They only gave us two waffles per order and you'd have to pay an extra $2 for another one. But for the price, you get what you paid for so it was fine. However, on the website's menu, it says that you get more with the waffles like bacon and eggs. This is very misleading because I did not. It doesn't say on the menu at the store so I wasn't so surprised when I got my food. I just think that the website menu should be updated so that future customers are not mislead.

Overall, the waffles were good, the coffee was good and the salad was good. The customer service may need a little work however.",DqxxBd46zc3dhvAREi7kbQ,0,0,4,RYDyG8lga75xE2Zql1nXLw

The establishment is clean, and they have a few  yummy looking things for vegans on their menu. The staff is passionate and friendly, and I loved the small business vibe that it had.

I didn't personally have a great overall experience there, but I realize from other's reviews that my experience was definitely not the norm.

When my fiancé and I ordered our food, I didn't think it would take much more than 20 minutes to get it on the table, but the guy working there did warn me that it might take a couple extra minutes. No big deal. After waiting about 45 minutes, I needed to leave for work but we had already paid for our food- which I found out hadn't even been started yet. There was only one other couple in the restaurant, so I went to find out what was going on. It turns out, the one person working there was filling a 30 sandwich catering order before making our 2 sandwiches. The owner/manager person came out to see what was wrong, and ended up basically yelling at her employee for not offering us a free upgrade to Belgian waffles so that he could use the other iron and get our sandwiches out quickly.

Now, yes, that would have been a smart thing to do, but what about the possibility of putting the only two waffles ordered in the last hour in front of the 30 catered waffles? Or the possibility of not charging for the meal we had to take to go and I still ended up late for work? Or at the very least not chewing out your employee for a unfortunately handled circumstance that could not have possibly been covered during training? 

Also the manager/owner lady was worried that I would give her a bad review on yelp, and kept bringing it up and asking that the employee's mistake wouldn't cost her a good review. I don't go on yelp just to give people bad reviews, but it's not often that I have an experience this bad either.

The sandwiches and coffee themselves were absolutely fabulous, and since the service was definitely situational, I would not be opposed to going back sometime to give it another shot. Even more than being late for work and not getting any sort of complimentary item as an apology, I just really don't appreciate the lack of professionalism that the management showed the day I went in. I've been in situations where my boss embarrassed me in front of customers before, and it's really the worst thing.

But like I said, it was just a poorly handled situation, and the food was so dang good that I would not be opposed to giving them a second chance- I'm just not chomping at the bit to walk through those doors again.",zWrwjEw9PErqU3BGDzE-OA,4,1,2,RHDZuYJgLENnB98jge50BA

The waffles here are the bomb but what really surprised me that I loved was the coffee.

This is a small feat considering how high my tolerance is for caffeine. I love it. 

The atmosphere is great for having a conversation, grabbing some lunch, or lounging about and I love the Guam seal incorporated in the back drawing! Also, Tiffany the owner is often working along with the other baristas and is great to have a conversation with, always remembers me, and the other baristas are friendly as well.

But in 2014,I found myself pregnant and working in Alaska. I happened upon a waffle house and ate there with my co-workers. They had the best pancakes I have ever had, with a ham and egg waffle that was divine. 
Since then I've been on the hunt for a waffle that could compare. I thought maybe those waffles tasted good because I was pregnant, like how many foods taste better when under the influence of certain substances.

-Vegan Tiabi Waffle- no difference in taste/texture so also tasty
-West Coast Wafflewich- bland and not filling 
-Tokyo wafflewich (i think that's what it was called. pretty much chicken, lettuce, and special dressing)- bland and not filling

First of all they're basically a self-service breakfast restaurant.

For instance, my order required 3 plates, how was I supposed to carry that, they didn't provide a tray. 
The floors were dirty, my table was dirty and the tables all around me were also dirty. It's hard to enjoy a meal when there's so much uncleanliness around. Please clean your floors more often and take the time to clean tables once customers leave. Small details like this say quality.
My waffle was also crunchy and cold...

We were lured here by a Groupon offer. I hope this critique is viewed by the owners and taken into consideration with this in mind. I love the concept of a waffles and coffee shop. Our coffees and waffles were very tasty and we did enjoy the food (maple bacon and red velvet).

Heck there are even waffle irons that make waffles shaped like the state of Texas...that would be a fun addition. Invest in more waffle irons! When ordering coffee to drink in the restaurant it is much, much better served in a glass coffee cup/mug. The paper plates and very cheap plastic utensils did not provide the best presentation. At the very least try to budget for a better quality of eating utensils. Again- the coffee (an iced snickers coffee, a latte and a cupcake coffee) were all very good, so maybe glass mugs can be added to make them perfect. The atmosphere is okay but I would encourage the addition of some cozier seating and décor...I would have ordered another coffee and stayed longer. I liked the chalkboard wall.

I always opt for the gluten free options and I tried their Hashtag Waffle with turkey sausage & eggs- it was delicious!!! My friend had the West Coast Waffle that had bacon, chicken, avocado with their TIABI sauce & she was speechless! The waffles had the right amount of crunchiness & sweetness at the same time- & the portions are huge! We had the Kale Champ (kale, bananas, orange, almond milk) & Tif's Waffle Macchiato that came with a cute tiny churro waffle with the drink (like an umbrella in cocktail drinks but you can eat the waffle & dip it in your coffee- yum!). Kale Champ was a champ! No bitterness & just a tad sweetness. The macchiato- Wow! Smooth, aromatic with a hint of cinnamon. The price is very reasonable- where can you have gourmet coffee or shakes with an out of this world waffle entree for just a little over $10 bucks?!  The place is simple with a local vibe touch to the interior- chalk board with cute drawings, a locker that has graffiti signatures from customers, and couches to relax or study. It's right next to Target near UNLV.

We came here after our Spartan race yesterday because we were craving for some good waffles. We heard about this place from the locals & drove there from the race site as fast as we could without getting a speeding ticket :-) We were still wearing our medals.

Tiff's Waffle Macchiato- 4/5

Bananutella Waffle- 4/5

Came out perfect with just enough crunch on the outside and soft fluffy waffle goodness on the inside. Covered in Nutella drizzle, bananas, and sliced Almonds. It was very, very rich. I ate 1/3rd of it I had to take the rest to go. I feel like this would of been better for dessert, too heavy for breakfast for me at least.",oG9VFtr_ye8v2tDnS3NOYw,8,6,4,p12bGYQiYeobJFp6v6KNGg

Since their opening, I've tried plenty of their menu items. With my go to being the West Coast. It's savory and refreshing (thanks to the avocado). Other notable favorites include Kisses and the Red Velvet Waffle for those with a sweet tooth.

The only thing about this place is that you never know what to expect with service. There are times when it would be swift, friendly, and efficient. You are going to be welcomed with a bright smile from the cashier and get your order in a reasonable time. But there are times when you are greeted with a blank, cold stare as if you've obviously interrupted them with their cleaning and get your order after a longer than usual wait.

I went with the Viva las Elvis cause peanut butter, bacon, and honey are a match made in heaven. My only complaint (and I feel like I'm disappointing so many people saying this) was that there was too much peanut butter. It completely overwhelmed the bacon. I also had visions about adding some chocolate to this dish so I stole a chocolate chip off my brother's waffle and yes, it was 100% worth it. Also, paired it with a honey cream latte - yum!

Brother went with the red velvet waffle. He said it was pretty simple, but it was still very good. Mom and dad shared their choices a wafflezilla and west coast waffle with a fruit cup. Both enjoyed the savory/sandwich twist for their breakfast and they were also impressed with the fruit cup which featured fresh chopped fruits. Mom had the pistachio latte, which is definitely more on the sweet, not really coffee side. The only caveat was that food prep was a tad slow. Each person's meal came out one by one. Hard to have a holistic breakfast this way....but it's a small operation.

4107188,2016-10-30,7,poYsvuOmVDqF4dTnjJ780A,"This place really took a beating on Yelp from some of my friends. Did they have a bad day or what? Maybe they've just improved overall? I love this place so far.

TIABI has been over on Maryland near Flamingo for a quite a while now. Maybe it's just out of sight, out of mind for me (since I haven't been to neighboring restaurants like Sakana that often), but it's certainly not too far from one of my workplaces. I was able to stop by for lunch to try their menu at long last.

They seem to be having some issues with music skipping (streaming lag perhaps), but it's a pretty quiet place either way with plenty of seating for studying or just enjoying food and drink. Baristas have all been friendly so far, and it was easy to use the Groupons that I'd recently purchased.

The iced Snickers coffee ($3.35 for 20 oz large size) is appealing, even mildly addictive. Although it doesn't perfectly capture the peanut-y essence of the candy bar, its chocolate and hazelnut combo are a reasonably sweet flavor fusion that provide both fuel and happiness. Plus, it's quite reasonably priced compared to other places.

The West Coast waffle sandwich ($6.59) is an obvious choice for a savory lunch. I was pleased first and foremost by the lightly crispy and spongy, fluffy waffle that's creased so that you can just pick it up. The chicken and bacon satisfied my carnivorous sensibilities. The delicious, fresh veggies (avocado, tomato) brightened the dish up. Finally, although the sauce wasn't that distinctive alone, it served as a perfect complement. Nothing was limp about any of this.

I went for the Pumpkin Truffle Latte ($4.65 for a large) on my second visit, opting for hot rather than iced. What a treat. It's a perfectly sweet, creamy drink with a moderate spice accent, and I wish it wasn't just a seasonal item. Maybe if I just ask nicely and bat my eyes, it won't be just seasonal? It's the drink that has finally sold me on that whole annual fad.

I also had the seasonal Zombie Waffle ($6.50). This red velvet waffle has bacon cooked on the inside. I had to ask because they're not immediately visible, but using a knife (obtainable at a station near the counter) to cut and even cross-section the waffle, I saw the thin fatty strips. This dough otherwise had the same texture as my wafflewich, which means it rocked. Flavor-wise, it's actually mostly savory, with the chocolate syrup drizzle serving more to accentuate the red velvet batter than to tilt the balance toward sweetness. This also needs to be a year-round treat.

TIABI has impressed me so much on my two visits that I wish I hadn't been so apathetic before. It's a great spot for caffeine and fuel to carry you through the day, and I'll be back even after I use the last of my Groupon 3-pack.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,13,12,5,vkYsvYR6yK6RN-YAr7nk3Q

The shop is in the same plaza as the Target on Maryland Pkwy. It is to the right of Target if you're looking at it straight on. The shop itself is cute with some couches and drawings on the walls. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I have to say. 

The girl at the counter did not know how to use the Living Social deal we had. After calling 2 other workers over and charging us the wrong price she had to refund the entire order and start over. Also she never scanned the app so if I were not the good person that  I am, I could re-use the deal and get $12 of free food haha. You should probably teach your workers what to do with it!

After our food was made they placed the food on the counter and called our names, however we didn't hear them and the food ended up sitting on the counter for a couple of minutes. There were four workers in the store all standing around behind the counter talking. Take the time to bring the order out guys! It was obvious we didn't hear you and it wasn't like you were busy- it was the only new order you had.

The waffle had no crispiness or flavor at all. Super bland. This is my second time having Tiabi, the first was probably about a year ago and as i remember it was underwhelming as well.

When I arrived I was kind of nervous because we were the only people there on a Saturday around 4pm. I took the lack of business as a bad sign, but I was wrong!! Maybe not enough people know about it?? I'm not sure, but if you aren't going to Tiabi, you are totally missing out.

As I said, this was a recon mission, so I had to order a little of everything, right?? We ordered 3 of the Wafflenuts - the white chocolate macadamia, the red velvet, and a vanilla one that wasn't listed on the menu. For waffles we got the Strawberry Kiss, but instead of strawberries we subbed bananas (on a Belgian waffle) and customized a classic waffle with blueberries and white chocolate. Everything was fantastic!! Everything was cooked to order perfectly. Hot, melty, sweet and so delicious!! I almost always get a to go box, and this is one of the few times ever that it was so good...I couldn't stop. No to go box needed.

The have lots more on the menu I would like to try...including their coffees. I am excited to go back. I, also, heard there might be ice cream coming in the near future. Fingers crossed!!

You should definitely check them out. They are worth a drive even if you don't live down that way. They are pretty affordable...$20 for everything I ordered plus a bottle of water. Portions are perfect...not too big or too small. The establishment is clean and relaxed. They have games and decks of cards on the table should the mood strike. Staff is super friendly and helpful.

I was warmly greeted upon entering the door. The somewhat nondescript, simple interior had the menu on the wall.  The lady gave me a run down of the 5 Wafflewiches, point out her favorite as well as the most popular West Coast Wafflewich. 

I ordered the #Breakfastsandwich and was somewhat underwhelmed. The waffle was soft but the flavor was very distinct and there was no sauce to liven it up.  I ask for a side of the Tiabi sauce, a basil based sauce that was ok, but not a compliment for the entree but probably pretty good on another entree that had Chicken. 

I guess my biggest disappointment came from the limited menu selections and the fact that there was only one ""breakfast-like"" sandwich.   A lunchtime meal might be perceived differently. 

To their credit they had quick and friendly service, but I would have to try something else to ""wow"" me.

Tried this place out for the first time today. First impression as you walk in sort of an island feel. Good amount of tables/seating. Friendly customer service. We ordered a ""bananatella waffle"", which was basically a decent sized waffle with bananas, whipped cream, and a drizzle of nutella. Satisfying, however, seemed to have skimped on the nutella a bit. For my coffee, i ordered a small size drink (two shots of espresso blended with almond milk and ice) It was made perfectly to order. 
Two stars missing are for the price, my small coffee beverage cost over $5 and i was just a little disappointed by the meager amount of nutella on my ""bananatella"" waffle. 
Overall, would probably not return due to the price of the coffee, even though i did enjoy it. :/",8FpOYsX0xvWRlKkl6sKnBA,0,1,3,FYA3FCGuiqvYeyt_8kwBEQ

Had a great early dinner here consisting of the recommended West Coast Wafflewich with housemade chips and a Just Peachy iced tea (with less sweetener).  The Wafflewich was good (wasn't the biggest fan of the tomatoes, as I felt it was too much of a soft component, I took them out and replaced them with some chips and added the crunch I was looking for) and the peach tea was great. (next time, I'll get all the sweetener--who am I kidding). 

Later, I additionally had an Almond Milk Green Tea Latte and it's possibly my favorite Green Tea Latte I've ever had.  It was refreshingly nutty and not overly sweet.

Our banana berry came out within a few minutes of ordering ($5.25). The smoothie wasn't icy at all and you could actually taste all the ingredients they put into the drink, unlike most places. IMO, $5.25 is a lot for a smoothie, but I would say it was well worth it's price.

I also ordered the west coast ($5.99). I was torn between the steak and egg waffle (a new addition to the menu) vs the west coast. I went with the west coast since the person at the register suggested it and I'm glad I did.

The west coast was the perfect balance of sweet and salty. The avocado didn't over power the sandwich which I feel most sandwiches do. It was definitely enough to make me full since I also ordered a side of house chips. The house chips tasted like kettle cooked mesquite bbq chips, but they season it themselves kinda like potato corner. Would recommend.

4642459,2014-10-06,0,poYsvuOmVDqF4dTnjJ780A,"It's been a while since I wrote a review, but I wanted to write one about my favorite cafe - TIABI.

TIABI - ""To Inspire And Be Inspired"". I discovered this little place through a student organization at UNLV. They are super close to campus and an excellent place to ""be inspired,"" in my case this is the only place where I know I can sit down and focus on writing and studying. I've been here several times already and have accomplished so much (yelping reviews is the bottom of my list up until now). 

First, the only downside I can mention is that there is only one wall outlet (that I know) where I can plug in. That little area has become my personal spot. Other than that, I thoroughly love this venue.

Location/Open times: TIABI is down the street from UNLV. It is in a secluded area of the Target shopping plaza right next to a great sushi place. As a potential schoolteacher, the 7am open time is right when I have to get to class but it is open until 8pm on most days making it a good place to have breakfast on my off days, lunch, or chillax after class/work.

Aesthetics: Local art, waffle ""hashtags"" everywhere, a couple of couches and sturdy tables and seating. The wired art light fixtures  add a nice rustic look (though they tend to accumulate dust quickly). Nothing is too distracting, and I can zone into my work or a conversation easily. Their playlists are provided by Pandora and varies by the people working, but I have enjoyed the musical tastes of the staff thus far, ranging from islander to indie.

Food: In the words of a lego dude, ""EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!"" There are plenty of options, especially health and allergy conscious, handcrafted on the spot. I have always enjoyed that ""fresh"" taste and have never suffered a regretful feeling leaving (as is sometimes the case with Chipotle or even Starbucks). As I am writing this review, I am having their red velvet waffle (so sweet and delectable) paired with a new beverage, the Frankenstein frappe, a cool and refreshing drink lightly sweetened with agave but not so much as to overpower the taste of the coffee. I am enjoying myself and am getting my morning kick (which is why I can write). 

Service: The owners, Tiff and Mae, are both super awesome and have taken care of me on numerous occasions. Their staff are just as kind and sociable, and I haven't had a problem striking up a conversation as I am often here alone. I feel as welcome as sitting at a desk in my own living room. I'm surprised that not as many people come to just hang out, but I'm certain that will change as more people come to know about TIABI.

I like small hole-in-the-wall local places, and I feel especially at home at this one. Hope this review was inspiring!",thCcBj33p7vLa9eSNKuupQ,0,3,5,lvDjwZWCyXSGYwpomJMASA

There are people working on their laptops or hanging out with friends. Their specialty is their vegan waffle. Either sweet or savory they have options for both.

There is a a big board on the left when you walk in for the menu. The customer service at the ordering  counter has been consistently friendly. I've had the West Coast waffle sandwich and that has chicken, avocado, bacon, and their signature aioli sauce. I really like it, but sometimes I get it without the bacon. Their chicken waffledilla is a quesadilla made out of waffle instead of tortilla. Very cheesy and hits the spot when you're in need of comfort food. The only drawback is that sometimes the food takes a while to come out. I've tried calling ahead for pick up, but was put on hold for a while and ended up driving there instead. However, I'm never disappointed when I get my food though. 

I do want to differentiate that this particular shop has a more soft and fluffy texture than a super crispy outside kind of waffle. I personally like the softer version, but for some people the waffle texture was too one noted. I have yet to try their dessert versions, but the strawberry and whipped cream seems to be very popular when I've dined in. The prices are very affordable too. Lunch with a drink will be around under ten bucks. All in all, it's a cool and casual spot worth giving at least a try.

Always looking for a good coffee place. Came across Tiabi on Groupon and decided to try them out.  I must say, it was delicious. 

Quality: 5/5
We had the snicker ""iced coffee"" and  the honey ""I'm home waffle"".  They were both equally good.  The coffee had the perfect sweetness and so was the waffle. However, if I must rate between the two, I enjoyed the waffle  slightly better. 

Quantity: 4/5
For the price, I think it's good, but not great. Although the large coffee was plenty, I usually see that as a medium size. So fyi, in case you are considering a small. It's really good, so I recommend the large.

Customer Service: 4/5
Nothing spectacular, although there was only two parties in there including us, we were not acknowledged when we walked in like most places do with incredible customer experience.  However, they were good once we were assisted.

Atmosphere: 5/5
It was kind of cold in there, there were us and one other couple that was in the shop. Mainly because we went about 4:30 p.m. Coffee shops are not known to be busy during that hour.  The music volume was however perfect tone. Not too loud or too soft.
 
Cleanliness: 4/5
The place appeared a little older, but was clean and organize.

Price: 5/5
The price was good, however, we got Groupon promotions, so it made their pricing exceptional :)

Tips:
You can get three $8 groupons for $14.25.  So we have two left to utilize. Will definitely be back to try out their other items.  Keep an eye out,  It's located in a plaza, so it's not a stand alone coffee shop. We almost missed it. Enjoy! You won't be disappointed.",a69W0w2h-1Q_YpEebzwt7g,4,4,5,Xuk5V60XJbn7v3-IIN-daA

I was greeted by the friendly cashier who was open to answering all of my first time client questions. I ordered two regular caramel macchiatos and also received a macadamia/caramel Lolly waffle for checking in. The macchiatos barely had a caramel taste, but did showcase the fresh coffee it was made with. Definitely better quality and more refreshing than any chain coffee shop. The Lolly waffle was satisfying but had an awful amaretto after taste and was undercooked in the center. If they gave their waffle maker a good scrubbin' and ditched the almond tang, I think the lolly waffle could have a chance to be great. Overall, the customer service was friendly and coffee was tasty, but the lolly waffle and cleanliness of the establishment need improvement.",9Ut7j4OozzqOLgHPCEsU8g,0,0,3,v12bcmGMvKC8XJwTq6dvUg

I got the Guru Burger and thought it was quite good- this is definitely a compliment from me because, honestly, I'm not usually a huge fan of waffle sandwichs! My previous waffle sandwich experiences have always left me feeling like I could have made the sandwich at home with two Eggo waffles (and it, honestly, would have probably been easier to eat than the folded, taco-ish style they all go for!). This waffle sandwich blew my Eggo creations to the wayside- their waffles are really flavorful and fluffy, better than I've had in ages. I also had one of their seasonal lattes- the Fa La La Latte, because I'm a sucker for anything mint!- and a bit of the lavender latte on accident... which, leads me to my only complaint about this place. I came with a friend who has a very similar sounding name to mine and when the barista called out her name, we both thought it was mine because I had ordered a few minutes before her... well, we were definitely wrong! I thought the latte didn't have much mint to it (but it was damn good, either way!) but didn't think anything of it until the barista called out my name followed by the name of my latte about 5 minutes later. That could have been avoided so easily just by writing the name on the cup. Having to remake a drink sucks way more than taking the 5 seconds to write a name on the cup! Either way, great coffee and great waffles- would recommend! :)",-JepRBl1Xi_co7kFalVe6A,0,0,4,rrgNy_b4dJ9btf8XkAyswQ

I was pretty impressed with the waffles here. I ordered a sugary cinnamon one, and my boyfriend had one of their waffle sandwiches. I think the only thing slightly disappointing was the coffee. I got a pumpkin spice drink, and the espresso/coffee they made it with tasted burnt and old.

As soon as I walked in I was engulfed by the smell of butter, sugar, and the smell hot irons. I thought I walking through heaven, this is intense.  

These guys have a great list of waffles ranging from sweet to savory.
My favorite sweet waffle is the Vivas Las Elvis
Bananas, peanut butter, chopped bacon and honey on a Belgian waffle. Vegan version-sub bacon and honey for almonds and agave.

I believe the place stands out for the Wafflewiches.  
The West Coast wafflewich is chicken, tomato, avocado and bacon in between a toasted waffle.
The lightly crunch with the saltiness of the chicken and bacon combination is over the top.
Definitely something you must try!

On top of that they make fabulous coffee too, complements the food.
They carry all types of coffee you would expect with few specialties the one I'm eager to try is Tiff's Waffle Machiato; Cinnamon vanilla latte, whipped cream and caramel sauce and served with a churronimo waffle on top. 

The customer service there outstanding!!

Tiabi opens early, around 6:30 am on weekdays. Which is good because I arrived around 7:45, parched and hungry. Strawberry banana smoothie took the edge off for a few hours, then the West Coast waffle sando took care of the rest.

I wanted to make sure I left the restaurant before Him so that I could get to my car. While He was talking to the cashier I quickly grabbed my purse and went to the door to leave, the homeless man was right behind me. Luckily He went the opposite way from where I was going. I was a little scared by this. I went to my car and locked my door. I noticed the homeless man that I saw inside was near the shop yelling and cursing at an invisible person.

""To Inspire and Be Inspired.""  My visit yesterday was definitely inspirational.

I came out here last month for the Yelp Coffee Cruise event, and have been trying to make it back since.  Yesterday, I was in the area for a birthday party a little early, so I popped in for coffee and a waffle.  

Tiabi is an adorable little coffee shop, hidden away in the strip mall near Target on Flamingo and Maryland Parkway.  Before the Coffee Cruise, I had no idea it existed, even though I frequent that area all the time. 

Yesterday, when I stopped in,  I took a look at their drink and waffle menu, and decided on the Twilight Lavender Latte, and the Golden Waffle. 

Service was super friendly.  The cashier was polite, and the girl who made my waffle had an infectious smile.  Tiffany, the owner, remembered me from the Cruise, and said hello after I had been seated.  We chatted for a minute, and then my waffle was ready.

So...the coffee.  
Light.  Flavorful.  Aromatic.   Delicious.  I may have done myself a disservice in ordering the Twilight Lavender Latte on my first time back, because I may not ever want to order another drink as long as this is available.  It is SO good...I shared a sip with a friend when I arrived at the birthday party, and her whole face lit up, it is THAT delicious.  Home Run, Tiabi.  Home Run. 

The waffle.  Oh, the waffle. 
The Golden Waffle is simple.  Its a light, crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, golden, perfect waffle.  Its dusted with powdered sugar, and served with butter on the side.  There was syrup on the table, but I didn't need any, and I normally drown my waffles in syrup.  

Sweet.  Delicate.  Awesome.  

Tiabi, I'm so glad I had the time to pop by yesterday.  You've excelled at making me feel welcome, and the quality of your offerings is truly inspiring.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,8,5,5,XRkAUVPtfBR1VfCam69cng

Entirely eschewing savories in favor of items far more sweet it was after perhaps a twenty minute wait that our proper order arrived and beginning first with a doughy Belgian topped with fresh berries beneath artificial tasting chocolate I quickly turned my attention to the alternatives, the Elvis faring a bit better by balancing sweet and savory over a slightly more study base while the ""Honey I'm Home"" proved the best of bunch in its sugar-crisp coating overlying a somewhat dense crumb - its ""veganism"" thoroughly compromised by honey and ice cream but the result all the better for it.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,1,2,VonWs6HJW4ZmSJNwQzOnUQ

Iced Caramel Macchiato - The coffee taste here is suuuper heavy - not too much of my thing, will skip this for the future.

Tropical Siena and Just Peachy Tea - they are separate teas and I've tried them both. The taste for both were a bit subtle, can live without it in the future.

Red Velvet Frappe - holy crap is it good here or what. Per me since I don't like too much chocolate, I've asked them to lessen the Cocoa and oh my, it is delish. Per bun it's probably the best we've found out here so far.

Came across this great spot on the Yelp app - on the hunt for something sweet. We skipped the coffee, but sure got our sweet tooth craving fulfilled with one of their delicious waffles.

They have various waffles to choose from with toppings such as nutella, banana, strawberries, chocolate and other sweets. Then they also have savory waffle sandwiches with bacon, turkey - and even egg and cheese!

We stuck with the Banana Tella which has banana, nutella drizzle, almonds and whipped cream. You can make any waffle a ""dessert"" by adding a scoop of ice cream. YES PLEASE! The waffle was incredible. I would of liked more of a ""home made"" whip cream - this one was possibly from the can - but it was still great.

We got the chance to chat up the owner and she was so nice! We asked her about the concept and apparently it started as a coffee shop - then they wanted to add some desserts and decided waffles would be a good fit - then decided to hit the lunch crowd so they added the savory waffles. Genius!

The service is friendly. The atmosphere for the restaurant is nice. It's laid-back and relaxed. Clean bathrooms are a plus. But perhaps the laid-backness is what caused the slow food. 

We got the Green Nut (?) the super green smoothie, the breakfast sandwich plus sausage and bacon, and the western sandwich. The green smoothie tasted like what you'd expect of a green smoothie, I wouldn't really want to get it again cuz it wasn't much of a wow. The breakfast sandwich was tasty.

With a big group entering the shop, we were sort of aware that maybe we would have to split up our group to sit down and eat. 
It was self serve, so we each ordered our meal, standing around at first trying to find a spot to sit. Eventually we found a table big enough for us if we all squished together. 
The food sort of took a little while to get to our table, but we did get our drinks first. 
I ordered the Serena tea (or something like that I don't remember), but it was super refreshing. Especially against that Las Vegas heat. Some of our friends had also ordered several other drinks, and they loved theirs as well. 
When our food finally came, we got the sandwiches first. Most of my friends had ordered the west coast sandwich, and they were super pleased with it. Another one of my friend ordered the Thai chicken and he was really glad with that one as well.

My bf & I came in on a Friday at about 8:30am and we were the only ones in the restaurant at this time so we were served right away. It's cafe type ordering so you just order and pay at the register and seat yourself. 

Since it was our first time, I asked the girl which items were vegan and she told me the only one was ""Viva Las Elvis"" which had coconut bacon, peanut butter and agave syrup on top. I'm not a huge fan of PB but decided to give it a try since she said it was the only vegan option. Little did I know, after I ordered I saw on yelp reviews that they do offer vegan butter to top your waffles which sort of bothered me as to why she didn't give me the heads up on that since I could've technically ordered another ""non vegan"" waffle and just customized it to be vegan. I mean I did like my waffle but it wasn't the greatest and wished I had opted for the butter pecan waffles instead but maybe next time. 

My bf absolutely loved the Guru Burger and couldn't be more satisfied! We liked the fact that the patty isn't made of soy and is made of superfood ingredients that make the burger so much more enjoyable. We also got a free ""snickers"" iced coffee with check in which was also pretty good.

Anyway, this place was not exactly what I expected when I read the Yelp reviews... I was picturing a cute little café with table service. What I got was essentially a coffee shop that happened to have waffles in a strip mall. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it just was completely unexpected. I was planning on getting a waffle and egg sandwich, until I found out that they use those weird egg patty things (they don't, you know, cook an egg), so that was out. Ended up getting the Elvis, waffle with peanut butter, bacon, and banana.... of course this was good, how could that be bad?!?!

Why three stars? Well, it's a great idea for a business using waffles on every single plate but unfortunately their waffles are not unique.

We ordered:
- Kisses Waffle
- Golden Waffle
- Waffledilla 
- South West Sandwich
- Breakfast Sandwich 
- Americano
- Chai Latte
- tuxedo frap
- waffle caramel ice coffee

While the whole menu idea is creative, some of the waffles were burnt and crunchy. The kisses waffle, golden waffle and Waffledilla were so toasted that it would hurt to eat them.

All others were soft and done the right way. Flavor was ok but nothing to wow anybody. I just feel that they are missing something that makes their waffles in general stand out.

Their drinks were amazing. I would definitely come back for drinks. Tasty and several options available.

The Good:
- Great cafe in a random strip mall

My husband and I both got waffle sandwiches and the waffle itself was thin which is perfect and tasty but I had one with chicken and the chicken tasted like that pre-packed stuff. Got the coffee with the cinnamon waffle on top and the waffle was awesome on that so I would go back just for sweet waffles and coffee.,ylphk4-uCvkRsxkHITjQpw,0,0,3,8CKphbusoF71cuUGen0B3Q

The food, drinks & service are AMAZE BALLS! lol.
Saw that there was a Groupon but we wanted to try it out first.
We ended up buying the Groupon because we knew we would be back for the remainder of our stay :)

You walk in & the menu is to the left. 
I love how it's set up, cafe & you can see them making the food.
They take your order & ask for your name (they will call you name when your order is ready)

The FOODS:
- Lemonade: So yummy! Sweet, just how I like it!
- Tiff's Waffle Macchiato: THE BEST DRINK EVERRRR! lol. It comes with a waffle that is dusted with cinnamon sugar, it's messy but worth the mess. So yummers!
- Pac-Man Waffle: Exactly what it sounds like. Pac-Man shaped waffle with blueberries & raspberries as the thing that Pac-Man eats. Lol. Super cute!
- Vegan Wafflewich: Tomato, spring mix, avocado & Tiabi sauce toasted. Pretty much like a salad in a waffle, sandwich styled. Sooooo good! I ordered this with the Macchiato every time I went here.

The employees are AMAZING! They remembered us & they're super friendly.

I totally recommend this place, RECOMMEND, RECOMMEND! You will not be disappointed!",y975lu1oBjpW47TT1QdFHQ,3,3,5,UAc7f-8ySlRtwZ_6yZnhqA

We ordered the breakfast wafflewich, the Thai basil wafflewich and the bananatella on our first visit here. We came here twice in 3 days. Luckily it wasn't hard to convince my husband to come back since he thought these were delicious too! Yessss! Waffles FTW!!! :)

On our 2nd visit we got another Thai basil wafflewich (obviously our favorite!!!), the west coast wafflewich, the maple bacon, and the Elvis (with bacon, honey, AND peanut butter! All were delicious, can't say a bad thing about any of these waffles.

It's one of those home town places where you want to bring your friends. You can hangout and have brunch or stop by for a late snack and dessert. They have all different types of waffles that will satisfy your craving. I personally love the waffledilla. It's the cheapest waffle sandwhich and will melt in your mouth! It's chicken, cheese, special sauce (that is sooooo yummy) in between a waffle folded in half and is super scrumptious. You can add a fruit bowl (variety so I'd ask what kind they have that day in case you are allergic or don't like a certain type of food) or homemade chips just for $1! Sweet deal! And it's pretty much a meal. They have a water pitcher towards the back. But they also have teas and smoothies. I haven't tried the smoothies but I want to! I like the ""Just Peachy"" tea. It's not too sweet but has a good taste. I always suggest this place because it's very central, it's cheap, they have dessert waffles too (try the red velvet) and they're friendly. It's located inside the Target plaza so there's a lot of traffic goin on around the place. But definitely a place to try if you haven't!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,2,2,4,pbdo8MK5IvjbrELgvRAStA

We sat and perused the menu for a while and I was a little disappointed that no one really checked on us or even asked if we wanted waters or more menus than just the one for our group of three. We finally figured out what we wanted and went up to the counter to order.

The lady behind he counter kept interrupting my dining companion as he started to order by yelling behind to another person who worked there. I thought that was a little rude, so that definitely put me off.

Our food took a while to come, but it looked really pretty. 

What we ordered:
-red velvet wafflenut 
-Nutella and almond wafflenut 
-The Fat Elvis waffle
-Strawberry and chocolate waffle
-Vegas churro waffle with honey, cinnamon, sugar and vanilla ice cream

Everything was solid. The consensus was that the churro waffle was the favorite and I personally enjoyed the strawberry waffle, minus the chocolate sauce.
