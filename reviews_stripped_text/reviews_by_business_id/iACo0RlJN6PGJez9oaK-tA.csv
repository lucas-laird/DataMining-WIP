Yes, we know there a bunch of 49ers in there but the game did not come on until 1:15, if people are in there watching games you should respect that. DO NOT turn all the TVs to one game when people are obviously watching several different games especially during playoffs and the game is down to the last minute. HOW DO YOU DO THAT??? at least put the game on in the back or tell the bar..... something. 

 When we went to voice a complaint Gary Bogel THE MANAGER said to us its a 49er bar and turned his back on us what an a$$.  And no Gary it's Timbers Bar & Grill it does not say anywhere 49er's Bar and Grill, if I knew that I would have gone somewhere else.  

Food was OK, but the stringy black-haired  bartender was horrible.  She should know that crack kills, especially when sporting a muffin top. They can bet we won't be back to that place.",_rffjoFLZ5zmGI8FoSJQTw,4,1,1,e64NGUiIAqfSlvOFe4CAXA

However, it does get really crowded with so if you want a good seat you have to arrive an hour before the game. The beer is only $3.50. Also when the Niners score you get a free jello shot.

Not great, not bad, just ok.  When I walked in, I was worried it would be a dive.  It was close, but not too bad.  Good enough to hang out for a couple drinks.

The waitress was very attentive and really helpful with the food order, checking to see if the oil was peanut free (it wasn't).

The drinks were good enough, but I'm not sure why a Sunrise Margarita would be brownish in color.  I ordered another, so it tasted good enough.  While the drink looked the same, it tasted different, so I don't know what it was or if the person mixing drinks knew what they were doing.

Not bad, but again not great.  Good enough.

However, I went in and gambled 75.00 dollars and drank 15.00 worth of beer and found out I was going to have to start a tab. I was upset but I said I would pay. The bartender grab my beer and threw it down the drain along with my water and later ask me to leave.

That said, we don't make it out too often, because we live across town, but this is by far my favorite Timbers. The bartenders know how to have fun, the crowd is always local, drinks are free if you're playing machines at the bar, they have lots of TV's and big wing back chairs, and the menu is good. 

If you dig fish-n-chips, these guys have pretty much nailed it. They've finally jumped on the sweet potato fries bandwagon, and you can sub them for regular fries if you feel the need. You can get breakfast 24 hours a day, which is a huge plus, and the grilled cheese here is EPIC. They call it (something like) the Ultimate Grilled Cheese, although I'm not completely sure - my neurons only fire for the taste of the thing. If I recall, they don't always have it on the menu, but maybe that will change. They put a couple different cheeses inside the most delicious bread, add bacon (mmmmmmmm...... bacon.....) and big slices of tomato, which stay cold in spite of the piping hot sandwich. Then they smash the whole thing into the skillet with loads of butter and shredded Parmesan cheese, which makes a droolworthy crust. 

All food aside, you will leave this place smelling of smoke, especially if you go during peak hours. Is it worth it? Oh, yeah!",fZR7spauUm_S8tZQrgFYiA,0,1,4,lGm5NNTc1tXoXzCcb6SYQg

First, my husband and I got the 2 for 1 drink special-he got beer and I got the margarita because they were out of cider. They brought both drinks out at once which I thought was weird so we were chugging to try not to let the other one get warm.
Second, the margarita was nasty. Had the weirdest taste.
Third, my husband got the chili with texas toast. The chili was  fine, but the toast was SO SALTY. It was inedible. Nearly everything we had was so salty we could hardly eat it. I got the buffalo chicken wrap which was decent, but the fries were over salted also.

I asked if they had hot sauce for my nachos, and she rudely says that I was already given salsa. I also asked for a fork a minute later and she laughed at me. I started getting concerned about my visit here and why bartender Amanda was acting out poor customer service skills. I later asked if they had 3 different types of alcohols, in which they did not. Instead of Amanda saying ""No"" or ""Sorry"", she replied with ""We're only Timbers"" which gave me the impression that she, herself, considers her work under par.  Another patron accidentally called her a different name, and then apologized when she corrected him on her real name. She still snapped back and stated ""How would you like it if I called you Peter?"" Finally, I found a scotch and asked for it. She poured it into a shot glass, and Isaid ""Oh sorry, can I get it on the rocks?"" And she yelled at me for not telling her sooner (One dirty shot glass shouldn't be a big deal).  I finally got my bill. I received 2 drinks on my bill which I did not order. Amanda refused to take them off and said that she already helped me enough and that she isn't breaking the rules. I didn't know what to do other than pay and not leave a tip. This was a horrible first Vegas experience. I will NOT reccommend this place to anyone. This girl needs to be fired, however, I'm sure that won't happen.

I ordered the classic cheeseburger medium with fries. Upon delivery the burger came out to a perfect medium as requested.   The patty was a thick 1/2 pounder hand formed with some tools I'm sure.   Very juicy but lacked seasoning.  No problem I can just add my own.  Topped wirh lettuce tomato and onion, my Burger was delivered quickly and with a large portion of fries, a pound at least.  I could see that my hunger pains would subside after this meal because I never let anything go to waste.  

My one issue with this burger was the bun.  It was so squishy and soft it could not hold up to this big old burger.   Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it.  This is just area I would improve on.  The pickle and Italian peppers on the side were a nice addition and both were crispy and fresh.

But the staff. I seriously can't get over how awful the staff was. Even with two bartenders, both of them stopped to talk to the same group of people for 20+ minutes. 

We go to this location because it's close to home if we need to walk home. Guess we will be bringing cab money and finding a new bar to frequent on date night.",wxkXoO2zlb2C2mYEwgL5cg,4,0,1,pvfaONyfd_FkXIoUgiRKcw

Timbers on Durango serves good bar grub and drinks to quench your thirst. This location receives a fair share of two and one  star ratings from Yelpers. In my opinion, the Onion Rings rate FIVE stars. Overall for food, service and atmosphere (think beer, pool & darts joint), this Timbers location warrants a solid THREE star rating - A-OK. 

***THE AWESOME ONION RINGS***
You get a full basket of thick succulent rings that are perfectly breaded & seasoned. Their ORs are truly a bite of sweet onion goodness. Add a little hot sauce (Cholula for me) or your favorite dip. Crunchy, delicious and satisfying. The basket will easily subdue two very hungry appetites for starters.  
 
The food is good bar grub. Nothing fancy! Expect real bar food without the frills & obnoxious presentation. I had the grilled fish tilapia tacos. Fresh tasting filet and Pico de Gallo. I go light on the white Baja sauce so not to overpower the other flavors. 

No rants regarding service here. My servers have always been pleasant, even when tables and barstools are full. 

Whenever I'm thirsty for a cold beer and long for my favorite Onion Rings, I'll most likely be at Timbers.",eyyq2aQQ8OuaAP-jljQi0w,1,1,3,_BxM4xcfM4nr01W9IUVeUw

Winning is never guaranteed, and often unlikely, but the machines give you back and forth play and allow you to enjoy yourself for more than a minute or two. Great music through a decent sound system, and the presence of Billiards and Golden Tee give this establishment the opportunity to be a little bit more fun then some run-of-the-mill video poker bars. I feel like darts would be a good addition but I understand why they don't have it. Jeffrey the late night bartender is a joy, he took the time to offer me a food menu and was personable and polite. I would highly recommend this place to anyone just looking to take a few minutes play a few dollars and enjoy a beer and some great music. That said I've had their food before, primarily breakfast, and it has always been at least par or above.

The reason I don't like it when it's crowded is that it's then difficult to get away from smokers -- but then this is typical in any Las Vegas bar, unfortunately. My favorite place to eat is is one of the easy chairs in front of the fireplace. 

The bar tends to be crowded, so I rarely gamble here. Too many smokers who just light right up and hold their cigarettes next to you. I know smoking is allowed in bars, but wonder why so many smokers have no manners. Sometimes a kind smoker with great manners will sit next to me and will actually ask if cigarettes bother me and I'll thank them for asking and ask them to just keep the smoke on their other side (side not next to me).

3144305,2016-06-04,3,iACo0RlJN6PGJez9oaK-tA,"My roommate and I were so heated  over how much this bar just sucked ass that I got on my phone and opened my Yelp account for the first time in a long time to write this review. 

My roommate and I both stopped in here to get a bite to eat. We arrived around 2:45am and sat at the bar. The bartender Richard was busy pouring beers for a group (assuming a birthday was going on cause I kept hearing ""OMG happy birthday!"" Countless times over at the group) so he didn't greet us for 5-10 mins until he was at his POS machine and looked up saying ""I'll be right with you guys"". Meanwhile my roommate decided to go ahead and play some blackjack. He's a pretty big gambler so I knew it was gonna be a lot. 

2 mins later he walked up asked us what we would like to drink and my roommate just wanted a water and a classic burger that was $4.50 and I got a Monster energy that was probably $3.50-4 and a beef Philly that was $9.50. Food arrived about 15-20 mins later and my Philly was extremely dry not even the mayo I asked for in it could help it. The fries were good and my roommate said his burger was good. After we were done eating our food my roommate was gambling to whole time and already put in $250+ in the machine needless to say he was also getting upset because the machine was just not busting. The bartender came up and gave us our bill to our surprise and on it was my philly and my roommates $4.50 burger. 

My roommate got heated. In all of our years going to bars we have never had a bartender give us a ticket for a $5 item after we gambled hundreds of dollars.
Most places don't charge us a cent because of the amount he gambles or whenever I gamble as well.
You just don't do that it's insulting to the guest especially when he lost his ass off. 

My roommate then asked the bartender if they didn't comp food and the bartender then took the ticket back and changed it real quick to just my philly on it. I was okay paying for that because I didn't gamble at all but the ONLY reason why I tipped him was because he took my monster off. 
Maybe it's because we didn't order alcohol and he assumed we wouldn't know any better and just thought that we thought only drinks could be comped when you gamble. 
Well that was a BAD move on his part because what he didn't know was both my roommate and I are seasoned gambling bartenders with years of experience and if he would of just comped our whole bill he would of had an easy $20 tip headed his way instead of the $3 I gave him. Even better we would of came back. 

But now because of this horrible service we won't be coming back. We will take our money elsewhere. Better to use some Comps and explain to a manager then to explain to a guest and lose that guest. Especially gamblers! 

The only reason why I would consider coming back and giving this place 2 stars instead of the 1 star it does deserve because of our night was because I happened to stop in here the other morning with my other roommate for some breakfast and a beer and the morning bartender Jamie was awesome! Fun to talk to, comped my beer and food and made sure we were happy the entire time. If I do come back it will be when she works.",4ZC0yy4D37YM7G3A9RnMIg,3,2,2,XPsdcNNN6SzfuRKK4aH1Rg

I am not one to be bias or give praise and acknowledgement when it's not due. But over these past ten years every time I have gone into that establishment they have always taken care of me very well. The food is great the service is great too. I have read many reviews on Yelp today and it makes me sad because apparently some people think that if a bartender is not all over you 24/7 giving you everything you want, that's bad service. I don't go every day like many of the VIPS do, but they still treat me great. I don't even have to gamble much to get great service. I'm also not one to not put $10 in the machine and expect to get 5 drinks free. They've always been completely fair with me and honest with me and I appreciate that. I've watched customers go in there and expect the bartender to give them everything in the world and because they don't they think that's bad service. It's just business $10 does not get you a bunch of drinks free. I've also watch customers go in there expect free food and drink for playing $20 but sitting there for 4 hours playing one quarter every 10 minutes and drinking their buns off. Good grief, people always expecting something for nothing. And then they don't even tip. Timbers is always been a great place to go and hang out and have a nice time. I still enjoy going there after 10 years. And I will continue to go there when I have the opportunity because Jason, Heather, Robert and all of the other servers have been great.

First, my boyfriend and I sat in the dining area around 7:30pm, the bar was not full and only a couple tables were occupied in the rest of the dining room. I instantly noticed the two bartenders, either eating or on their phones. After not being approached by a server for fifteen minutes I got up and ordered drinks at the bar. It took a good five minutes to be noticed as the bartenders were obviously preoccupied. Finally the female bartender came over and poured the drinks. I handed her my card and she took about ten minutes to run the card because she stopped to chat with another customer. I went back to the table and at this point my boyfriend informed me that a server had been to the table next to us twice, to drop off menus and then to drop off drinks. Not once did she ask us if we needed help or even make eye contact. I was in the service industry for years thus I am an extremely understanding person when it comes to service. We ended up sitting there for 45 minutes waiting to order food. Once again I got up and went to the bar, I asked the bartender if it was possible to order food with him as not one server had come our way. He looked around for the server (instead of providing the customer service and taking my order to her) and said ""Yes, I will have her come over but you will have to wait a few minutes... I don't want to tick her off""...... I thought I was being Punk'd. YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT PISSING YOUR SERVER OFF IF YOU ASK FOR HER ASSISTANCE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR IT FOR ABOUT AN HOUR NOW?!

3965614,2017-02-03,4,iACo0RlJN6PGJez9oaK-tA,"I came up with a new term to define this cuisine. I feel this term accurately captures both the style of food this establishment purveys as well as the level of commitment it demonstrates to quality and service.

That term is ""crud-ordinary""

Websters dictionary defines normal as ""having no no special or distinctive features; normal"". 

The term crud is defined as ""nonsense"" or ""a substance that is disgusting or unpleasant"". The latter sense of the word, however, is more pertinent for this review.

I can confidently assert that Timbers will NOT disappoint if what you seek is a meal that is an interesting mix of something entirely recognizable and familiar, yet which could very well be your worst imaginable version of that cuisine. 

Take the meat sandwich I ordered this evening. It was absolutely a meat sandwich. There was bread and there was meat. It therefore unequivocally delivered on its promise of being a sandwich. However, its flavor was that of watery gravy drenched in cardboard. The dipping sauce looked brown and zesty and yet despite that promise, still tasted like your grandma's grimy dishwater - or at least, if I can be so bold, how I imagine her grimy dishwater might taste. 

This exotic fusion of the comfortably recognizable and the deeply, viscerally disappointing is the very hallmark of the cuisine I dub ""crud-ordinary"". 

Let us turn now to the quality of service lavished upon us and accompanying this desultory, disappointing excuse for a meal. The service, also, was deeply crud-ordinary. It was familiar, insofar as the food did arrive. However, it also demonstrated exemplary levels of suckage given that it was  an hour later than the anticipated delivery time. 

That is sixty whole minutes of added anticipation and expectation. Sixty whole minutes of extra annoyance and disappointment as we cracked open the styrofoam to reveal our exquisitely crud-ordinary dishes. 

Don't order your food from here. Just don't. You are a more worthy and deserving human being than should eat here. I don't care if you walk poor old grannies across the road and leave them stranded on the median strip. You're STILL worthy of better cuisine than this. It's horrible.

We ate toast and yogurt instead of finishing these meals. Toast and freaking yogurt! This is how deeply, impossibly and absolutely crud-ordinary this place is. 

Do yourself a favor and do what I should have done. Move on. Eat something else. Just ... don't.",N3o6XuUFWFcp1IE3j6QtYQ,1,1,1,6mWbSbYzS30LWVO899Gm8Q

Wait staff is always really nice here and all the bartenders are really attentive to you whether you are playing video poker or not. I will reccomened the farm burger with fries it's a decent sized burger and the portion of fries you get is just right another plus is that they actually cook it to order not just pretend to by asking how you would like it cooked as some other restaurants do. There are two pool table here and most of the time they are open also some casual seating in the front for a more relaxed stay than at the bar or bar tables.,k5XFyzSbP1yW2nXkrh6ZCw,0,0,3,FYP-dSuzJGPffjftzQo15Q

I've had the bacon cheeseburger with Swiss and fries. It's always good. The Bozeman beef was really good, except not a complaint but more of a suggestion, the Au Jus is really strong flavored, not salty, just really bold and rich. They could actually cut food costs by diluting it 1/2 oz of water to 4 oz of au jus. I put a little water in mine and it was bomb. My order is always ready within 20 minutes. They don't charge me extra for ranch for my fries (but I only get one little container). REMEMBER... it is a bar with bar food. I'll only accept the comments about bad customer service cuz that's the people. It's not fine dining on the strip. It's not a Michelin star restaurant. It's a bar with bar food. Quick, greasy, and delicious. I've never had a bad experience at this place. I've been here many times in the past to sit down and have breakfast. Lately I've been doing takeout.

I have lived in vegas for 28 years,I've been a cocktail waitress in some major casinos and was a bartender for 4 years in some local joints so I know when you have a playing customer you serve them drinks on the house. This bartender wanted to charge me and when I asked why he was charging me when I am playing fully load video poker he went ape shit on me!! So I cashed out and he was still yelling at me,told me to get the F out. I said I'm trying to just give me my money. He then threw the money at me. When I called the next day to report him the manager defended the bartender ,saying we can charge for drinks. I never was charged for drink during the day by the female bartenders.  I think it's a scam in there. Graveyard bartenders don't make money so they charge for drinks,pockets that money and the tip money. No wonder why he went crazy on me.

5050049,2011-08-25,4,iACo0RlJN6PGJez9oaK-tA,"The bar food was good so we tolerated getting to-go items. Even then it sometimes was spotty service and it was always from the same server. Black hair, really bubbly and friendly which makes her scattered with no priorities except to chat and have fun. 

She's the reason why we always check sauces as it normally isn't always there. I've gotten salad without a dressing or fries without ranch sauce. If we deal with someone else, there's usually not as much issue. 

After last night, screw this place. 

Called in the order and it usually takes 10-15 minutes. The BF gets there soon after to pick it up and lets that server know he's here for a pick up. She goes to the back and says it's a few minutes. He tries to get her several times. It took forever to get the food and when the BF pays and she brings him the food, he asks for sauces that wasn't given. The girl goes off then to drop off a drink, but then goes to chat with some people, and off elsewhere, gets people their checks, etc. before going to just grab the BF some ranch, malt vinegar and tartar sauce. At this point the BF has already been waiting 30minutes plus on a order that was called in 50 minutes ago so he was quite miffed that this lady has no concept of priorities. When a customer is needing to leave, then don't hold them hostage! He sat for a few minutes too many for some sauce.

58 minutes for food. When we open the food- it was cold and soggy. I didn't get tartar sauce for my fish and chips. I live two blocks from this place so it didn't get cold on a travel home. It's the reason why we pick up here- the proximity should get us hot food. 

The food was done probably the timeframe they said, but that lady didn't go get the food and wandered around chatting up people.
