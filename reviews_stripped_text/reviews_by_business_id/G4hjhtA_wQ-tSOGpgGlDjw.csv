I order 2 camaron enchilados and I even specify spiciest possible well it wasn't spicy at all. NOTHING!!! The taste was meh I was looking for salt they didnt put on my order and 1 taco look poor with only 3 small shrimps. The pulpo taco was really good in taste but still was missing the spicy salsa. Personally I didnt like the marlin and gobernador taco I wont comment on those since I havent found any marlin tacos that I like here in the US. Cinnamon taste on the horchata was too much. I think they can improve on the flavors and salsas since they have a fresh ""salsa"" that is only tomato, cilantro and onion they should add serrano. I will be going to taste the food over there not delivered. Overall I was really excited since I was hungover I thought it was going to be awesome for that but since nothing was spicy the food didn't help and was a huge disappointing.

We both had a specialty drink, a shrimp tostada as well as two tacos each and we split the last one. For under I believe 30? Which is steal for the quality of food and detail they put out of that kitchen! Considering they are on LV blvd you should not complain about the prices. especially with how BIG the tacos are and the generous amount of fish given.

Manny is I believe the owner/general manager, but he was also our server! He was pleasant and always had a smile, and welcoming guests everytime they walked in. A couple who would be considered a ""regular"" who has visited the past couple of days while on vacation... walked in and he greeted them and seem to know what they were gonna order before they order it! How sweet! Manny and my boyfriend got to talking about various things, and how they started and where they are from. He is just an overall wonderful person to talk with. He even walked food over to there rival super burrito... EVEN THEY liked his food! :) 

Boyfriend loved the authenticity of the horchata, the sauces, the fish batter, and the tostada. I loved it all. :)

I will be def coming back, and I will continue to tell people about this spot. They have only been open 4 months, and I hope they are there for the next forty years.

Also the tacos gobernador had too much veggies, and it kind of over powered the shrimp. I also do not like my ceviche sweet. It seemed like their ceviche had ketchup or something so I did not enjoy the shrimp ceviche .

It's so tender and juicy and it reminds me of the skin and fat of buffalo wings (none of that pesky chicken meat) but octopus is actually very low in fat! How do they cook it like that?

My friend invited to for lunch, and she got two pulpo tacos and one fish. I got one pulpo, one fish, and one shrimp. I should have just gotten all three pulpo. The fish and shrimp was good, but not mind blowingly better than other places I've had. But the octopus! Not only have I not seen it on menus as a hot dish or taco, but it was also prepared so well, with a crispy, yet not hard shell tortilla, and fresh cabbage/tomato/chipotle cream. Everything about it was perfect.

The chef/owner? was extremely nice and remembered my friend. She spilled some sauce on her white pants and asked for some soda water to try to clean it up. He didn't have any, so he went to the Super Burrito place across the lot and got some for her there. What service!

The only thing is it's a little pricey, but it is in the normal part of downtown and not the ghetto. It's across from Viva Las Arepas. Parking is easy, and more parking in the back as well.

Well.... 

It's 5 stars. It's 5 stars of delicious awesomeness.

We arrived at 5 pm on a Friday based on Yelp reviews. There were only two other people eating and I wondered if Yelp had failed us. 

Manny, the owner, has a knack for creating tasty masterpieces and excellent customer service. 

I asked for a recommendation and quickly ordered his first suggestion, the pulpo taco and a horchata. My friend, who is less familiar with seafood tacos, decided on  the fish. As we hesitated with our second choices, Manny suggested he put in the order and then order more if we want. 

He was very accommodating, even when my friend ambiguously declared she didn't like ""something"" on her first taco. He made her next taco with no crema, but then obligingly gave her two sides of it to try. She then fell in love with the chipotle crema and he won her over.

Overall, a great experience. I'd love to  try the rest of the menu. A few recipes may need some tweaking, but they clearly know what they're doing when it comes to cooking the seafood. Since I'm just passing through town, I'd love to see their clientele grow so it's here when I return!


THE FOOD

Lucas Taco (shrimp and california chile)
Absolute favorite for both of us! Think Chile Rellano with perfectly flavored shrimp. My biggest disappointment was that it fell apart and I was forced to eat it with a fork. 

Pulpo (octopus)
The meat was tender and not tough. I've rarely had such well-cooked octopus in the US. Delicious, but be warned - the tortilla is lightly grilled in a LOT of oil / butter. It was dripping.

Gobernador Taco (shrimp and cheese)
More of the perfect shrimp! With cheese!

Bajamar Fish Taco 
Sadly, this was the least favorite for both of us. The batter on the fish was a bit soggy, but I suspect that wasn't the norm. Even assuming it's usually better, it would still be just above mediocre. 

Horchata
This might have been an amazing 5-star horchata, but I was so busy with my tacos I hardly paid attention. Overall, a very solid, classic recipe - well balanced sweet, cinnamon, and creamy.",8-ViiORgQDbqxYmiXBXRFA,0,0,5,5lqMaO3RgTltIUxsASvKig

2393270,2018-04-24,0,G4hjhtA_wQ-tSOGpgGlDjw,"FISH TACOS. Must I say more. I came in on a Tuesday. Or what the cold kids call it taco Tuesday. The fish tacos were $2.50 a dollar cheaper than on any other day. I walk in and the set up is a little strange the door is by the bar where the kitchen is and then there are tables off to the side but if you sit at the tables the waiter cannot see you so I opted for the bar. They don't sell any form of alcohol but I believe they are going to change that soon.

The menu is one sided but has a good amount of stuff mostly seafood. I got 3 fish tacos ($2.50)and 1 octopus taco ($4)and a side of rice and beans ($2 each) the food came out fast and it tasted very fresh. The fish itself was crisp and very light. The slaw was also crisp and cooling against the chipotle crema. The octopus taco was the bomb tho. It had crispy cheese and spicy octopus with the same vibrant slaw from the fish taco. Just delicious. The rice and beans were a perfect companion for the tacos. The rice was nicely seasoned and the beans were hearty and covered in cheese.

Overall a pleasant place to spend an evening and if you have a craving for seafood tacos this is the place to go.",d1wFl03KjXkJFaLEq_XqZQ,0,0,5,3jVF4-_WoyBKpADCeHe5eQ
2440368,2018-06-20,14,G4hjhtA_wQ-tSOGpgGlDjw,"Dare I say it...the best fish tacos in Vegas! Yes, I know, Vegas isn't exactly a fish taco destination, but still! These tacos are on point!

My love and I first came in needing a quick bite to eat in the area. Bajamar had been referred to me by a couple different people at this point, and I knew there were a few items I wanted to try. Needless to say, they did not disappoint. You know it's good when on your first visit, you're already thinking of coming back and bringing other people that will enjoy the experience as well.

After two visits now, we've had the opportunity to try the Raw Shrimp Ceviche Tostada, Mixed Seafood Soup, as well as ALL of the fish and seafood tacos, which include:
Pulpo Enchilado Taco
Marlin Taco a Las Brasas
Bajamar Fish Taco
Camaron Enchilado Taco
Gobernador Taco
Carne Asada Taco
Lucas Taco

The seafood soup was certainly good, but I think I'd stick to tacos as my main meal. What did stand out was the Pulpo Enchilado Taco, where wonderfully tender octopus finds a rightful home. The tacos tend to be dressed in a few similar fashions. A closer look reveals that there are 4 shrimp options, one octopus, one battered fish, and one grilled fish option. They are all really good, and there isn't one I'd shy away from ordering. I'm interested in trying some of the appetizers as well next time to see how far the excellence extends. If a cool lager is not your idea of a perfect taco pairing then you could explore one of the Aqua Frescas they offer: Hibiscus Lemonade and Horchata.

It's as if the whole building was plucked up from Baja California and transplanted right here in Vegas, with bright colors and aesthetics that take you ocean-side right away. Inside you'll find a bar with a few beers on tap. Sitting here allows you to engage with Manny, a proud and friendly owner. There are also a handful of tables and a few high-tops in the long, skinny space. A code to get in the bathroom reminds you of your actual setting in Vegas, but also ensures a much cleaner facility to use while at Bajamar.

Return visits will certainly happen for us...we even have some more friends in mind that need to experience Bajamar Seafood & Tacos.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,21,19,5,5smUadN1XEGloSTDQcnfCA

This place came as a strong recommendation from an old friend so I knew I had to try it. 

Cuisine: My Top 3 tacos are the Spicy shrimp, Octopus and Chile Relleno tacos. The spicy shrimp and Octopus being the top two. They each have a nice creamy sauce topped to them which I love. I've had the fish taco while it was good I wasn't crazy about it since the fish was deep fried but maybe that's for you. Now as far as a drink you MUST have the Hibiscus lemonade, the dark one. It is wonderfully tart and a nice addition to the tacos. I can't get enough of this drink and I guarantee you'll love it. 
Customer service: It seems the same man is always working there every time I go and I certainly have nothing to complain about as he is attentive and friendly as well as his knowledge of the menu he can recommend anything to you that you may be in the mood for. 
Location: Located in a very small parking lot which probably holds about five or six cars facing Las Vegas Blvd near Lovett's custard. 
Ambiance: I really can't complain, they keep the place clean and have good music. Also plenty of paper towels at your disposal at the table!",2CPznDdy5cnOb5jm2RDqbg,0,0,5,Cofj-BGjk0Ai71ZD_8kLCA

We had the Shrimp Ceviche Tostada, Sauteed Shrimp Taco, Sauteed Octopus Taco and one off the menu Sauteed Marlin Taco. At first I thought I liked the Octopus taco the most but the truth is everything was done really well. From perfectly crisped tortillas on the flattop to the fish and even the limes were super juicy (Nothing I hate more then someone give me a three day old dried up lime with my taco or tequila).

I was greeted right away by very friendly staff I'm going to assume he might of been the owner 

It was Tuesday so they do 2.50$ shrimp tacos grilled or fried :) who doesn't like a deal?????

My food was made and I was about my way All for under 15$ heyyyyyy 

I got home quickly sat down and took a bite of each one each one were so delicious with there own flavors and spices :)

When you walk in, you are greeted by the welcoming smile of Manny, the owner. You can sit at the bar or at one of the tables and begin to peruse the delicious menu. The menu is straight forward, one side is in English, and the other in Spanish. On it you will find several Baja-style seafood options, including some amazing seafood tacos!

When my love first brought me here, we knew right away we would be coming back. All-in-all, we have ordered:

- Pulpo Enchilado Taco
- Shrimp (raw) Tostada
- Marlin Taco a Las Brasas
- Seafood Soup
- Bajamar Fish Taco
- Camaron Enchilado Taco
- Gobernador Taco
- Carne Asada Taco

My favorite was the Pulpo Enchilado Taco but everything was made fresh and tasty. Chef makes a ""Chipotle Mayo Sauce"" that is spread on top of several of the tacos. If your friend is not in the mood for seafood?...not a problem. Chef can make Carne Asada Tacos as well. They are not on the menu, but Bajamar Seafood & Tacos will accommodate the request. 

Their Tacos are not small, street tacos. They are big enough to just have two for lunch, but you'll probably want to have a third, just because it's that good. They have a few beers on tap, and offer a couple of Mexican drinks, like Hibiscus Lemonade Aqua Frescas, to quench your thirst...so refreshing!  

Make a point to try Bajamar...who knows...we might even see you there.

My boys and I were visiting from CA this past weekend and we ran across this place and decided to try.  We asked Manny what was the best menu item and he recommended the Pulpo or Octopus.  We didn't go for it and ordered everything from shrimp to carne asada.  We also ordered a few appetizers and were pleasantly surprised.  When the rest of our tacos came we quickly devoured them and they were fresh, crisp and delicious.  We then knew if the rest of the tacos were that good, we should try the octopus.  4 of us ordered the octopus and they were so good.  The octopus was tender and the accompanying sauce and trimmings just melt in your mouth.  These are the best seafood tacos in Vegas.

4106997,2018-04-11,6,G4hjhtA_wQ-tSOGpgGlDjw,"If tacos are a game, then we have a winner. The winner.

Bajamar Seafood & Tacos is one of the newest establishments to grace the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming. This intersection has surprisingly been a destination hosting many foodstuffs over the year. It was the birthplace of the Goodwich, the first home of Desyree's gelato, and a brief incubator for Chef Justin Kingsley Hall (now of the Kitchen at Atomic). It's still home to the institution known as Luv-It Frozen Custard, although I may have started to visit it beyond those years.

And now we have Bajamar, the pinnacle of Mexican seafood tacos as far as I've witnessed. Maybe I haven't been to Mexico, but I've had a few delightful tacos in San Diego (as recently as eight days ago), both of which are the previous stops of the gentlemen who are running this place. Compared to those experiences they're doing everything better (aside from one killer smoked fish taco).

I happened to show up on Tuesday. This and Monday are when they offer the namesake Bajamar fish tacos ($3.50) for a dollar discount (down to $2.50, making them a steal). These are the best fish tacos I've had, with white fish battered and fried to crispy and tender perfection. These golden-brown morsels are layered along with salsa, red cabbage, and a delicious chipotle cream sauce inside an oiled and heated corn tortilla (the same single tortilla prep as in all of the other tacos which I enjoyed). A squeeze of lime is nice but not necessary. There isn't really any heat unless you wanna use the bottled hot sauces which the server provides you even if you don't ask.

You can get by on the fish tacos alone, but then you'd be missing out on other taco treats. The Pulpo Enchilado ($4) comes with chile de arbol, packing some heat but not that much (even for relatively heat-sensitive palates like mine), some Monterey cheese, and more of that salsa fresca and red cabbage. Amazingly tender octopus, which you might almost forget is present unless you get the pieces with the suction cups. I think it was in one of those food shows on TV where I heard that leaving those on adds texture, and now I see what they meant.

Last up for lunch was the Lucas taco ($5). I wanted to try their sauteed shrimp, and it was cooked to the right texture. Although it has the standard orange-ish and white appearance if you clean it off - suggesting that it's not that special on its own - you'll get so much flavor from the gooey Monterey cheese, the chipotle cream sauce, and the intact longitudinally cut (aka sliced lengthwise) half of a California pepper (aka Anaheim pepper). No regrets with trying this one either.

(UPDATE 4/16/18: The $4 Marlin taco a las Bresas is also quite something. It's the kinda fish flesh that cooks up to resemble terrestrial meat in all the best ways. But it's still pescatarian-friendly. The $4 Gobernador is another great shrimp taco.)

I'd also read that the horchata ($1.50) is a steal of a deal, and CM Taylor was right. This mason-jar version is rich but never seems too sweet. Get these if you like the cinnamon-y, creamy Mexican drink. 

Bajamar left me with only one question in the end: do I clean only my fingers of the heavenly mess, or do I lick the plate too? Since there were other people around, I avoided the latter. Maybe next time I won't. And by next time, I mean next week.

Drive, don't run, to experience some of the best seafood tacos by far in town or anywhere else.

(P.S. Shout-out to beer buddy Justin, if you're reading this. You put this restaurant on my list.)

Bajamar is a colorful family oriented restaurant located north strip closest to DTLV. The restaurant is extremely clean, staff very hospitable and the bar is massive.

The place is small, but clean, open, and airy. The turnover is quick so there's not a wait even when they're busy. Our server/host/busboy was quick, efficient, friendly, and responsive.

We had the Bajamar shrimp tacos, the pulpo enchilado, and the Lucas taco. The shrimp taco had perfectly battered talapia, red cabbage, salsa fresca, and a wonderful cream salsa which all combined to make a tortilla envelope of goodness. The pulpo enchilado consists of sautéed octopus in a chili de arbol sauce, Monterrey cheese, salsa fresca, and a tasty and smooth chipotle cream sauce. The taco was incredible but the octopus kind of gets lost in everything, so I might have to sample this taco many many times to make up my mind. The Lucas taco is the specialty here and once you sample one you'll see why. Sautéed shrimp combined with grilled bell pepper, Monterrey cheese, and chipotle cream sauce make a scrumptious titanic taco. These are not huge tacos, pictures don't do them justice, but they are dense and tightly packed with amazing flavor and are highly satisfying.",TxYvDePA67VeFBwnh-wr8A,1,0,5,nsifaWBAx3t1nrFWZgbqSQ

Bajamar occupies the old Chinese spot by OG's and Viva las Arepas. I had always wondered who or what was going to take up residency here and I'm glad it's this place! 

We came in on a random afternoon during lunch time. There's not a ton of table, but there is a very long, shiny wood bar to sit at too. The place is beautifully redone. We opted for the bar and were immediately greeted by the owner and were given menus and some ice waters. I ordered the shrimp tostada and the tostada mixta, which has shrimp, octopus and fish. My forever partner in crime ordered the fish taco special. We made small talk and found out that the owner is originally from the SD area and that there's only 3 people running the show there. 

Our food arrived shortly after and I actually had the restraint to stop and take a few photos beforehand, which is a miracle because I wanted to dive right in. The tostadas were crisp underneath the giant piles of shrimp, octopus and fish. The seafood was incredibly fresh, light and super chunky! Perfect. There's hot sauce available on the table caddy, along with a paper towel roll, s & p. I didn't try the fish tacos, but they looked fantastic and were reported to be delicious as well. Nicely sized pieces of golden fried fish atop corn tortillas and a fresh slaw to finish it off. 

We left super satisfied and are looking forward to our next visit in!",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,2,2,5,Li4WiSsrs1iagt7-jkXhXA

When walking in, the restaurant is modern and clean. ZERO fish smell which is incredible given the entire menu is seafood. We were greeted immediately, and food and drinks came out very quickly. 

I had a shrimp taco and pulpo taco and shared a shrimp cocktail as well. When I ordered it I had no idea pulpo was octopus but let me tell you it was the most tender octopus I've ever had and was a flavor explosion! The tortillas were cooked perfectly so they actually held up against the yummy sauces on the tacos and were soft and crispy at the same time.

It has 6 or 7 different Mexican and local Las Vegas beers on tap. The food, is no doubt the star. Ingredients are fresh and tasty. I chowed down the tacos, savoring the bright and powerful flavors.

There is a small parking lot right in front of Bajamar off Las Vegas Blvd. It can be a bit tight, and a few transients have been sighted, but it makes for a great show when you're having lunch or dinner. I was greeted immediately when I walked in and sat at the bar. I thought about getting food to-go, but a few regulars (yes, they already have them) enticed me to stay and dine. I'm so very glad I did.

I was walked through the menu, which is in English on one side - Spanish on the other, and wanted to try everything. The service was top-notch. Very attentive and I could tell that he sincerely wanted me to have a great experience. I went with the Bajamar Fish Taco and Lucas Taco. Pause here as I take a moment of silence for these tacos.

The Bajamar taco was fresh, battered just enough, and packed with flavor. The Lucas Taco blew my mind. The gentleman sitting next to me recommended it because he has ordered it everyday since they opened. That's commitment!! It did not disappoint. I want to make a baby with that chipotle sauce. They make their own horchata and it was amazing. I'm not an expert, but it was creamy, not too sweet. I loved it. 

I took a chance and ordered the cheesecake to go. This was more of a 3-star cheesecake and wasn't decorated with fruit or any type of sauce like I was expecting based on other photos. I had one bite at home, tossed the rest. I might give it one more chance during my next trip, but only because I love cheesecake so much. It will be better for my belly if I don't like it anyway.
