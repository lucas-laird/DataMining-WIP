Hubby and I are in love with their pizza! Customer service is excellent, they're always so friendly ... and we did the survey to get the coupon for free desert. Large steak fajita pizza and smores desert pizza only $10 You can't beat that right?
Desert pizza was to die for. seriously. Lol we will definitely be going back!",_UsVXsG9FfmH0VTTkUJTHQ,0,0,5,903quFuRQK3dvEDCc5qIPA

The last time I was in, we were talking about sauces and they told me they could make a pink sauce which is the red and white sauce mixed and suggested I try it.  From now on, I will always order my pizza with pink sauce!!!",CKZd3r-dUFeSYxqSQv67EA,0,0,5,NSbaLJap3KbILhgPQ6nhOw
1606574,2014-03-01,6,5MlgZwfmaegOL7_FJ3b7lA,"Picked up a heart shaped pizza and it was decent. It was like $7 or something and you bake the pizzas at home yourself. It comes with instructions and clean up is a snap. The pizza isn't award winning but it's good enough for a ""take & bake"" place. They have cookie dough for sale and garlic bread too. The lobby inside is huge and seems like wasted space. Call ahead your order if you know what you want or walk in and have them make it in front of you. Either way it's up to you to bake it.",eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,10,10,3,yLYUGWl07gh_hb8hLrNXTQ
1636585,2016-07-02,0,5MlgZwfmaegOL7_FJ3b7lA,"Passed by this place for the first time today and they had a table set out with samples. My bf noticed the samples and pointed to them. The young girl outside noticed him and literally ran over to our car to give us samples. Great customer service and we weren't even customers. Give her a raise! And the pizza was GOOD!

We didn't have time to get a pizza today but I will definitely be back to get one. I would have never tried this pizza place otherwise.",2kMMpWAhwLxTsP9-AKKp8A,0,0,5,65_Ami3aZ0b-UYum72W5gg

2077519,2016-10-10,1,5MlgZwfmaegOL7_FJ3b7lA,"Turns out, I actually like this place. The only thing that sucks about this particular location is that they are slowwww. For a take and bake spot we waited almost as long as it would have been to cook the pie, which kinda defeats the purpose. On Tuesdays any large pizza is $10 and a family size is $12. You can get a specialty pizza or create your own up to 5 toppings. Even the premium toppings are included in the total price so it's a good deal. I've recently fallen in love with their white creamy garlic sauce, it makes a great base for a yummy pizza. If you are on the fence, you can get half white sauce and half red sauce on your pie and see what one you like best. 

Besides pizza they have breadsticks, cheesesticks, salads, and even cookie dough. They just added a new dessert, a cinnamon wheel that comes with a delicious cream cheese frosting. It's like eating pieces of a cinnamon roll. So good! I'm glad I gave this place another try. Check your mailbox because they send coupons frequently in the money mailer envelopes.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,2,2,4,oy5ssoMg24ueuMvwnqP-7g

3517944,2014-03-04,16,5MlgZwfmaegOL7_FJ3b7lA,"I usually only eat Papa Murphy's once or twice a year, but when I do, I enjoy it. I already knew what I wanted when I walked in. In the past, when they have a special promotion going on they have some already made in their cooler to keep the long lines down. This time though my pizza was made fresh right in front of me. I asked for a ""Heart Shaped Pizza"" priced at $7 and included 1 topping (additional toppings extra). For an additional $6, I added ""Cheesy Bread"" and ""Cookie Dough"" to complete the meal. 

Different types of pizza here take different times to cook. I had the original crust so it needed to be baked at 425 for about 12 minutes. The pizza came out nice and tasted good. I baked the cheesy bread at 400 for about 10 minutes and it was pretty good for what it was. If you are going to buy frozen pizza at the store, you might as well come here and get something you can customize for about the same price and it tastes better. The pizza and cheesy bread are baked on the trays they come on, but they do offer instructions if you would prefer the pizza to be baked on your pizza stone or grill. The cookie dough comes in a tub and you bake in on your own sheet. I baked the cookies at 375 for about 10 minutes.

They also offer stuffed pizzas and at home pizza kits for kids.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,25,20,3,76a_uG0S46GhKfatORV3Kw

4467033,2017-04-21,0,5MlgZwfmaegOL7_FJ3b7lA,MOST of the time I get the best service at this location. Today I has someone different helping me named Nastasha. She threw the thin crust pizza pie down on the counter and grabbed another one after I told her I didn't want thin crust. She was so rude and I'm the nicest person ever. I don't deserve that type of treatment at any establishment! I had to rate 5 star because my hubby and I love the pizza so much. I drive 15 minutes to get there and had to deal with her.  There is another guy that works there that usually makes my pizza and he's so sweet every single time! I just feel that the company should know how their associates are engaging with the customers.,sx55EGzpAVnNybn8Ri0LCQ,0,0,5,MGejajuzlePl464T3VynqA

4722716,2015-12-30,0,5MlgZwfmaegOL7_FJ3b7lA,"Went there recently to get a pizza and was pleasantly surprised.  The store is very clean, modern, and orderly.  The staff was extremely kind and helpful.  I really felt the warmth about the place.  Some business have staff which can be rude, condescending and they use sarcasms.  Tearing at the flesh.  But not at this particular place of business.  I was so warmly greeted by such a kind staff who was more than helpful when answering my questions.  It's been many years since my last pizza at papa Murphy's.  The nearest store is very far from my house.  Like 30 min drive.  But I will continue frequenting this place because of the friendly staff and most of all a quality product.  No other pizza chain sells better pizza then papa Murphy's.  I feel the reason why they can afford better quality ingredients is because the business saves a ton of money not having to pay for the repair, maintenance, and upkeep of a pizza oven!  Pizza ovens are on all day to keep them preheated.  That's a lot of overhead costs in natural gas bill!  Not only that but the electric bill will still be sky high.  Because if you have several gas pizza ovens running all day you must keep the air conditioner running constantly too cool off the kitchen.  Whoever came up with the concept of take and bake papa Murphy's was a genius.  They pass the savings down to the customer.  I hope their prices will stay competitive.",Dpp0gEmuNTnvyPAdrDu2Bw,0,0,5,n6v7PhSrdoU-i4V3Mx6GYg

He came out and very rudely advised that the coupon isn't combineable with other offers.  Apparently ordering anything else off the regular menu nullifies their coupons.
