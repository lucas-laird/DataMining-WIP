STAY AWAY due to people in the kitchen using bare hands to pick salad and raw chicken and then coming back to the front to handle money when sanitizer are not to be found and place dirty that should be mentioned in the dirty dinning on channel 13!
STAY AWAY due to no one barely speak English and no manager in charge!
STAY AWAY due to these violations are repeated when I came back to return the food that was dry yes even the rice!
STAY AWAY if you don't want dry chicken with minimal teriyaki sauce that was disgusting.

Would highly recommend crab rangoons and any kind of chow mein because how can you mess that order up? I love me some noodles. Their combination fried rice isn't bad, either. I used the gravy sauce from egg foo young and mixed it in with the fried rice and it was a great concoction.

I have gone to the location over on Valle Verde for years and have loved this place. It's a great VERY FAST Chinese Food restaurant that serves very good food. Plus they deliver! And now they have one by my new home on the west side! Woo-hoo!

There is a large menu with lots of combinations but I've found that you can pretty much MAKE UP WHATEVER YOU WANT. For example, instead of the CHICKEN AND EGGPLANT or TOFU AND EGGPLANT I just get CHINESE VEGETABLES AND EGGPLANT. It is by far my favorite dish of theirs. 

Just today I had the chicken and eggplant and it was very good. My girlfriend had the tofu and eggplant and it was so hot that I almost got done eating before hers was cool enough to eat. This would be great for a delivery dish, as it would hold it's heat for a long time. Oh, and I think the lady who brought us our meals winked at me!

Well, the lady working the counter lied to me as I still have a headache from eating lunch there yesterday. It's so bad that I feel compelled to write this review as I cannot sleep with this headache.  I only get headaches after consuming large quantities of the garbage, which is rare since I take precautions to avoid it the best I can and haven't experienced anyone else lying about it.  Hell...even a Vietnamese restaurant admitted to "" just a little bit...just a little bit"" recently which I appreciated, yet avoided.

Rather than being honest and not making a sale, China A GoGo decided to be deceptive and in return will get my honest review about the cleanliness of their restaurant and quality of their food.

So against my better judgement, I ordered the Mongolian Beef lunch with Hot & Sour Soup...not to go.  The table I sit at is sticky prior to my food arriving.  The soy sauce and Sriracha on the table have crusty residue on the tops of them.  Even though I chose to dine in, my food arrives in a styrofoam to go box...the soup in a styrofoam cup.  The lady plops it down in front of me and I see noodles hanging out of the box laying on the sticky tabletop.  I pull the noodles that have contacted the table out putting them on my napkin.  I'm given only 1 napkin, a plastic fork...no chopsticks.

The Mongolian beef wasn't at all spicy or seasoned for that matter.  Not a lot of meat, but a ton or green bell pepper and onion.  A more fitting name would've been Bell Peppers in MSG sauce.  It came with fried rice and some bland brown noodles.  I was expecting it to come with white rice and would've preferred it to.  The fried rice was meatless and flavorless.  The noodles were just as bland, actually more so.  Maybe I should've eaten the noodles hanging off the box that touched the table?  They may have had more flavor after soaking up the table top bacteria.

The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour.  Tons of tofu, no meat whatsoever and close to no bamboo shoots.  A slippery, slimey tofu soup without any crunch is what I got.

Even without the MSG fiasco, I would've rated it 2 stars.  Since I was deceived in the name of a few dollars and am still suffering at 5am the next day, they get 1.  China a NoGo makes Panda Yuckxpress seem like a 5 star dining establishment.",0E2Q9mJsMdQ0hRkKTVWuag,6,0,1,5Iq46XSngo4RoUAedDxK5g

They knew they made a mistake and still wouldn't budge. When we went in we showed them the food that they had served us and still would not admit they were clearly in the wrong. We had him taste a piece of the overcooked chicken they had given to us and even he didn't want to eat it.

I've been back quite often for the noodles because I love carbs. If you are looking for authentic Chinese food this isn't the place to go.

4234419,2012-11-16,0,QKCu3cKjMAOOZI7tEfv0zg,"Second time ordering from this place and I've got to say, they're pretty consistent.

I've only ordered for delivery and the girl who has taken my order both times is easy to understand, even if her accent is heavy. She's always very polite and patient with me who always has a change of heart when ordering delivery mid-order (I know, I'm a terrible person) . They've also been very accommodating to my requests for items not on the menu (green beans in black bean sauce) and any modifications I have to an order (um, instead of the carrots, could I just get more cabbage?).. honestly.. I don't even know how these people put up with me.

Delivery is fast and everything comes ridiculously hot! I know the corn starched sauces help with that, but seriously.. it's like magic to me. This is not the most authentic Chinese you will ever have, but sometimes, I just crave that Americanized Chinese food that's almost like.. well.. fast food. I mean, at least half of the menu items are fried, and all are smothered in sauce. Delicious in an oh-so-comforting way.

So far I have tried:
-The hot and sour soup and as a previous reviewer stated.. it's not so hot. It was sort of bland and the texture was so viscous-y I stopped after a couple bites. On the plus side, it does have some seafood in there, including a chunk of imitation crab.. never seen that before.
-The sweet and sour shrimp arrived still crispy (no, really, how do they do it?!) with the sweet and sour sauce conveniently on the side. They have an interesting technique of preparing the shrimp in such a way that they turn into little rings when fried. Like a shrimp onion ring. Sort of difficult to eat, but the great thing about it is that since it's split in half, it's definitely clean and I appreciate that!
-The eggplant with fried tofu is a total win if you like fried tofu. I'm more of a silken tofu person myself, but the sauce on this was fantastic!
-The vegetable fried rice was so-so.
-Various fried goodies: crab rangoons (I couldn't stop eating them) were free with our order, egg rolls which are vegetarian and the boyfriend loved. They looked pretty standard, more like a spring roll. They also gave us a baggie of fried wonton strips. These were happily consumed by my boyfriend who judiciously declared them as his own. He put them to good use with the rest of the sweet and sour sauce from the shrimp.

A couple of nights ago we ordered again. Pretty much the same food but also got sesame beef. The food was okay. The meat is definitely not high quality, but overall the flavor is what you'd expect from a traditional Chinese restaurant. I'd give the food a 3. When we went to pick up the food my husband used the restroom and said it was filthy. No soap, no paper towels, dirty toilet, etc. I certainly hope the kitchen has soap & they're washing their hands before cooking. I'd give them a 1 for cleanliness.",_0sr_IIJ6kMDAYwQBCtIgA,1,0,2,G8r28kwhdm1Gdv0PEMmMzw

Big portions however, it may seem small in the box, but it's a lot of food in there. Overall good place",t-iWNck4f56zcFBL9mJ5xA,0,0,4,kuBCTfvo31U5tdjOz1_-AQ

It's way better than Panda Express and they have great lunch specials too! My family loves the Orange Chicken here because it isn't dry and over done like at Panda. I am a fan of the fried rice and veggies myself. Of course you can never go wrong with the chips that they give you here while you are waiting, they are super addicting and they are great to dip in anything! 
They are always super friendly here too, which is always a plus because you can't just have yummy food if you don't have nice friendly people to go with it :-)",vp93T_AshEE9blhTGtJWLg,2,1,4,QfvhZQR_w9EZL1LUA9b8ZQ

I walked in and there were a few people already waiting for their order, they had several large phone orders and a few people were coming in after me.  

I ordered the pad thai and it was very very good.  I went back a few days later and ordered the lunch combination kung pao with fried rice.  and again there were a few people in front of me waiting for orders and a few people came in after me. 

I think this place just APPEARS to be quiet and empty but it really isn't.  The food is good, I will definitely go back and continue to try other things.

Jaycen got the appetizer delight. He wasn't super impressed .. His fried shrimp was cold & the BBQ rib ""slices"" were weird tasting he said and seemed old. He said the rest was okay though. 

All in all it wasn't the best Chinese. Still looking for a good Chinese place in Vegas...

On a plus side, the iced Thai tea was really delicious - I would come back just for that lol! But the guy taking our order couldn't even tell us if there was caffeine in it or not.. Uh ok? lol",73kL216R4mnIrLbAbBWD3g,1,1,3,tlC2D0DqKGnwwYPINalSJA

But I did and I went in and ordered a half order of sesame chicken and wow did it come out fast. Sure am glad I only ordered a half order because I think it was enough to split especially with the plate of rice that they gave me with it. Too bad I didn't have a friend to share it with. Next time I'll know for sure. The menu seems extensive and they do have quite a bit to go trade where people are coming in to pick it up constantly while I was sitting there eating. The flavor was nice these portions were huge and I think a lot of people in this neighborhood are enjoying some real nice Chinese food.. I think there are a lot of people around here must be repeat customers. It would help if you could order in Chinese because I think they're English is a bit weak. But hey don't worry even if you get something you didn't order it'll taste good and in my case I didn't get something I did order but I still had enough so I was happy so go get them give it a try see what happens,3XzhO2aJdvVtYhKOCJsPrg,4,4,4,7fUtgp6qHnjZzcOv0yiCKg
