23239,2017-07-08,1,v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg,"Landed in Vegas in the morning and was looking for a place to get brunch that was off the strip. 

Overall a 4/5. 

The food was 4/5. Their bennys here are different  Tried the Cajun prime rib benny which was good. Eggs were scrambled and done well. Beef was cooked with mushrooms they were not too dry, and sitting on bread (grilled with butter, the best part).

The fiesta benny was second best. They were ok. Came with bagels so it was a little heavier.

I couldn't resist ordering the sunrise snow caps, which were decadent. It was a big order so definitely too much for one person. Best shared among 3 people, unless you love carbs and sugar. Kids would love them!

Coffee was a 2/5. Very light here. And the server initially filled regular coffee, then refilled with flavored hazelnut coffee (like the ones you get at panera?). 

The service was a 5/5. Sat at the bar. Servers were very friendly and attentive. 

The atmosphere was great too!",6i5DkOQ6dJppImsCUrqmhg,2,2,4,0T1gnWW4tvuZIhbIX_OoaA

32441,2008-11-26,2,v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg,"When Hash House is just too far away,  too much money and too much food.  This is your healthy alternative.  Whereas Hash House is that cute girl you spend too much money on,  this place is like the loyal girl next door thats always there for you,  but easy to take for granted.
Luckily Ive realized my folly and always make a stop when I am back in town.  
A very diverse menu,  but you can make your own breakfast and its not a problem-UNLIKE other places where a custom order brings that underhanded chain of sighs from the server to the first line cook all the way down until it ends back up on your table.  Now it feels like your custom order is weighed down with a little extra guilt or sarcasm. 
Back to the lecture at hand,  I highly recommend this place when you want a break from the usual breakfast joints,  the buffets and want something REAL.   Come with friends,  the coffee is always topped off and you'll walk away wondering why you didn't come any sooner.",KU7i4ZlrXu7AkneJ2pU8nw,2,1,4,1GautN-ZOEQmqbgyqWC77w

I usually get the veggie Benedict. Just the right amount of sauce without drowning. Choice of different bagels. My daughter loves the French toast.

177899,2010-09-04,0,v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg,"The boyfriend and I decided to visit here after trying to decide where to eat for a late breakfast, early lunch. I've heard of Sunrise Cafe from a few people and we thought we'd pay them a visit. 

It was quite busy and people were waiting for tables outside. We wanted take-out so went straight to the cashier to order our food. I got the Garden of Eden omelette. It was an egg white omelette with mushrooms, black olives, red and green bellpeppers, and had avocado, alfalfa sprouts and pepper jack cheese to top it off. I thought it was very delicious. Never had black olives in an omelette before and it was good! I'm pretty olive crazy.. so I'd eat it with anything to be honest. It also came with potatoes, and wheat toast. My boyfriend got some roast beef dip sandwich with coleslaw. He initially said it looked small, which it did, but was actually pretty packed with meat. I didn't try it but it didn't look that great. 

Workers were friendly. The lady asked if we wanted water while we waited. We didn't really wait too long. Less than 10 mins and we were on our way.

It sucks that breakfast is soooo expensive when you eat out. Sunrise Cafe & The Griddle are all like $9 for breakfast.. I sometimes don't even eat lunch for that price. OH well. Overall, the food and service is good. I will definitely return, but probably won't be returning back too often. I'll come back next time I have family or friends in and looking for a good place to eat some grub in the early AM.",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,1,0,4,FCHtBqXcjPUZTUOKc0VXaQ

Outside seating is nice and cozy for a nice spring day brunch!  They give you the option of bagel or toast and a side of sliced bananas.  Their orange juice is also really yummy and fresh.  They also have turkey sausage which is great for people like myself, who don't eat pork or beef.  The turkey sausage was delicious!

We both ordered the Jacobs platter: two eggs, bacon, Canadian bacon, sausage, potatoes, silver dollar pancakes, and toast for $8.99.  The server asked if I would like bananas instead of potatoes, which is perfect for me because I don't like potatoes with my breakfast. 

The only downside of the meal was the wait time for our food. We were both starving, and it took 20-25 minutes until the food arrived. However, it was worth the wait!  Everything was delicious. We finished everything in our plates, and left full and satisfied.

They were very busy but still managed to get out food out  quickly and be attentive to our needs throughout the meal. The menu selections are pretty standard for breakfast with some spins on classic items like their ""Bueno"" and ""Brooklyn"" eggs benedict. I ordered the ""Garden of Eden"" omelet, and thought it was decent, it needed some love...or maybe just salt. I really liked the potatoes. They were shredded, but in a wider form than I've seen before, and yummy. My partner in crime got the corn beef hash and ate the whole thing. So, I say give it a try and you probably will not be disappointed; but, I think I'll save the gas next time I want breakfast and go somewhere closer to home.",fAfRl64eN2amF9Hr1i75-A,2,0,3,28cKpx-x5sQJXpfv4SCWXg

Again thanks to Yelp, I was rescued from eating at iHop or Denny's. Well it must have been ~9:30am, and there was already a line. As much as I despise waiting in lines, I knew that usually a line means ""it must be good and worth the wait"". 
AND fortuntely this was true for this case.

Their breakfast-lunch menu was impressive. I have to agree with a previous review, I wished they served french fries... skinny fries.  But their home fries was a pretty tasty alternative.  From eyeing the neighboring tables, the omelettes were big or decent size.  I was hungry but didn't want to overeat, since I knew the primary plan for Christmas-Holiday wkends are to eat... so I wanted to pace myself.  So I shared the Greek omelette with my nephew.  I wanted to add more protein but gave him the choice between grilled chicken and steak.  We had the steak and it was delicious... totally hit the spot.  It was also super cool that they didn't charge to split our entrees.

737213,2014-03-21,0,v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg,"Sunrise Cafe is our favorite place for breakfast in Las Vegas. We come here probably twice a month, despite the 20+ minute drive from our house. 

Service: The service is typically excellent. After our first meal at Sunrise, we told our server that it was our first time and everything was delicious and we would definitely be back. Shortly after, the owner came over to welcome us and to say thank you. She's a really friendly, genuine person. Whenever there's a wait, she'll go around with a treat, like banana bread, to give to the waiting customers. There usually is a wait, especially on weekend mornings, but the service is so efficient that I've never waited more than 15 minutes. The last time we were there, one of the hostesses was unfortunately pretty snippy with us. It was such a shame because we usually are met with nothing but genuine friendliness. Perhaps she was having a bad morning. 

Food: The food is consistently fresh and tasty. I usually get the Jacob's Slammin' Platter, which is two eggs, bacon, canadian bacon, sausage, silver dollar pancakes, potatoes, and toast or bagel. It's like a breakfast sampler. The potatoes are some of the best I've ever had. My boyfriend gets the Bueno Beni, which is eggs benedict over a bagel with jalapeno hollandaise and cheese. It's a delicious, spicy indulgence. The kitchen is also really good about modifying if you have any dietary restrictions, so don't be afraid to ask if you want to make any changes. The orange juice is really sweet, so I tend to get a small size rather than the very big large. Price-wise, it's so affordable, especially considering the quality and portion-sizes. 

Atmosphere: Great, bustling atmosphere. It's lively and fun and fast-paced, but I've never felt rushed. Sunrise is like a diner in that it is quick, as well as welcoming and casual. You can see straight into the kitchen to watch your food being prepared, especially if you sit at the counter.",H7f5JJM4FFXyqm4_jtfC_w,1,0,4,K803nZFZ540wSapA3bVzuQ

This place differs from the rest in a few ways: the eggs benedict are served on your choice of bagel or toast, as opposed to the traditional english muffin. It's interesting how they also offer bagels in place of toast.

Finally, we were seated. Our order was quickly taken, but the wait for our food was lengthy. It gave us time to notice the booth beside us had some misbehaved children that were bouncing all over. The boy bounced about so much that he heaved up breakfast. They left the mess and what appeared to be a very small tip. The table sat empty waiting to be cleaned, they got a bus boy over with a stomach that could handle it. He cleaned the table like it was any other mess. And the next couple was immediately seated. I really expected the area to be disinfected with care. I cringed when the unknowing couple sat down. I'm sure this sort of thing happens all the time, but it's the first I've witnessed it. So that was a turn off.

We were starved and sweaty by the time our breakfast arrived. The garden of eden for me and a build your own for him. We prefer omelets with the cheese on the inside, a personal preference, I know so I try not to let it sway my judgement. However, these were underseasoned. Just very bland. They might be eggwhites, but that doesn't mean that shouldn't be flavorful. Breakfast came to $30 plus tip. We failed to find the value.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,6,0,2,7CkL9x9_qrjnDne6itxiCA

Huge selection so get to reading when you sit and with breakfast choices as good as the lunch choices, you'll have to deal with a battle within yourself regarding which meal to show some love. I absolutely love the Glenn Wrap, mainly because I have a severe Frank's Red Hot addiction that governs my ordering patterns just about everywhere I go. I love their hash browns too, not greasy or too seasoned, just right. For lunch I've made sweet food love to the Reuben and was not disappointed. 

The staff is super friendly and you can chill at the counter seating or choose from a table or booth. You can even sit outside if the weather is to your liking. Bring Fido or Rover along, they provide dog treats and water for their canine customers. If you're hitting this place up on a weekend be prepared for a little wait. Check out the shelves as you walk in, they've got some pretty cool old school candy. Who doesn't need some Big League Chew in their life?

I consider myself a vegetable freak and this is one of the rare breakfast places where you can find genuinely good veggies in a lot of the main entrees. 

The omelettes are praise worthy and although the Garden of Eden could be tempting for you health enthusiasts I would recommend the Davezilla. The veg-overload in the Garden of Eden is hardcore for even me but the Davezilla is still healthy with some spice to offset the bland. 

I have never been disappointed with the create your own salad and whenever anyone at my table gets the signature muffin I hear about it for the rest of the meal. They look delicious and always come out piping hot! If one of my friends was writing this they would rave for hours.... Maybe I should just try one?!

Since my last review, the service continues to excel, the food is above average and overall, we enjoy the experience.  Slight ding - seems like the hash brown servings ( and they make very good hash browns ) are shrinking.

I continue to order Jacobs  Slammin' Platter ( two eggs, slice of Canadian ham, bacon, sausage, 4-5 dollar pancakes, hash browns and bread with no charge option of a bagel ) three out of four visits.  The gf orders her egg white veggie omelet EVERY TIME.  Her dings - occasionally they put onions in the omelet even though she orders without.

He was super appreciative, helped us move with our drinks to a waiting area, put our names on the waiting list again and then got us refills. While we waited another lady came by and offered us blueberry muffin samples. When our family arrived, the hostess immediately came over to let us know the next table would be ours. Our new waiter was just as friendly. In fact, it should be noted EVERYONE in this place was nice and accommodating, even the bus boys. Very rare and such a refreshing change in this town. Lots of food choices. Our group had Brooklyn eggs Benedict, an omelette, a burger and a lox bagel sandwich thing. The food was all amazing...tasty, hot and prompt. I really really wanted one of their fabulous French toast creations but made a more reasonable choice...maybe next time lol anyway, we will definitely be back next time we are in town..I can't say enough great things about this place!!!",XQoWfrfxNAodDFYlBRY7XQ,0,0,5,A18kTXDC_IMZ7Q1jRTHA-Q

1274970,2015-10-19,0,v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg,"Let's face it - breakfast is a magical meal.  Whether you're eating it at 7 AM , 7PM , or 1 AM ... there's just something about the first (or last) meal of the day.  

I'm relegated to eating oatmeal every weekday morning (don't ask ... ), but on the weekends I like to splurge a little.  And the Sunrise Cafe is one of my favorite places to welcome the day.

The vibe is hip, for a breakfast joint.  Lots of fit people migrate over from the nearby LVAC (Las Vegas Athletic Club for the recently transplanted).  Think beautiful people dressed to work out - though whether they really did work out is a mystery. 

The menu is about what you'd expect from a breakfast eatery.  Eggs, french toast, pancakes, omelettes about any way you can imagine, bagels and lox, wraps, and some specialty dishes like the Peter Brady (you guessed it - pork chops and applesauce).  Prices are reasonable to high for breakfast.  

I eat here about once a month or so.  Right off the 215 and Eastern, it's a convenient, fun, place to eat.  And with the number of people they serve in a given day, you know that the food is always fresh.  I have yet to show up when there wasn't a wait.  Not too long mind you - occasionally it can be 30 minutes, but usually the wait is only 5-10 minutes.

Most recently I had the Power Wrap; grilled chicken, egg whites, salsa, swiss cheese on a sun dried tomato tortilla with hash browns (crispy).  Very tasty, and pretty healthy, if you don't count the 1/2 pound of cheese and hash browns.  No matter, I'll work it off at the LVAC. 

So to sum it up, if you're looking for a good place to eat, with a wide selection of ""healthy"" choices, friendly wait staff, and plenty of eye candy ... Sunrise Cafe is the place to go.",A63h_7zL1phcQvrRuwEpvw,0,0,4,9pl8qLJO5kQEGmAE8Q2y2w

We ordered the same entree to split, since they do not offer half portions and everythingthis very large.  I asked Tara for the 'Classic Breakfast' w/ turkey sausage & patties.  They offered to split the two meats when we ordered it last time.  She says the Turkey & Eggs?  I say no the classic just split the meat so she charges us still for the Turkey & Eggs?  
I don't think I've ever been here on a Thursday so maybe that's why service sucks.  The Caramel coffee was the ONLY awesome thing this time.  
After our meal was served, Jeff C.'s toast looked like someone took a bite of it & was super soggy.  Mine looked good & from a totally different bag.  We sat w/ no place set-up, silverware or hot sauce... the server who brings our breakfast brings it...two full bottles of Franks Red Hot like somehow I was going to finish a whole bottle.  He asks anything else?  Yes silverware. 
When we did get it Jeff's was sticky like jelly.
Usually they fill up the coffee. Mine sat empty for awhile.  
Itll be awhile until I come back.  Disappointed.

We originally went to Cracker Barrel, but still the wait is an hour on a Tuesday so we headed not far to the OSC.  Immediately, we were greeted & seated.  Love the original staff some of which are still here too. Forewarning, expect a wait on the weekends, usually no more than 15 minutes & packed, but worth it!

They not only have awesome breakfast, lunch and a bar counter to sit at, if you're in a rush or alone, but they sell local art pieces displayed on the wall, old fashioned candy & sodas so it gives you that down home comfy feeling.  Also I am a coffee freak so always look forward to their specialty coffees such as the Cinnamon-Hazelnut coffee.  Mmm!

It's a fairly big restaurant for a breakfast joint, with patio seating (for those rare but treasured COOL days in vegas).

I ordered the traditional french toast ($7.69) and made it a platter (+$3.50) by adding two eggs over-medium and bacon.  It was all delicious and cooked really well. The bacon was amazing.  

My boyfriend ordered the ranchero wrap with the chipotle tortilla and hashbrowns.  He liked the wrap, but the hashbrowns definitely stole the show here. 

His mom had the short stack pancake platter ($7.69 + $3.50) and grandma had the Garden of Eden omelette ($9.25).  They both loved the meals.

The service was a little slow.  It felt like forever before our waiter finally came to take our order.  At least he was friendly.  The man who actually brought out our food was great, making sure we had everything we needed.

The prices here are very reasonable.  The $3.50 it cost me to make my french toast a platter included two eggs and four pieces of bacon, which is more than what you usually get at other breakfast spots.",FWYjGKHmbjxrkXROctTGYA,3,2,4,5XyIospsvZwWYLYf5Qibcg

My server Tiffany tried to tell me that it was a strong coffee. Cuban coffee is strong coffee, this was weak and burnt in effigy.  When it came time to order I asked for the corn beef hash and eggs over medium with a side bagel with cream cheese. The only thing edible of that meal was the bagel and I suspect that was because the cook missed it with his flamethrower.  The corn beef was non existent and resembled the smattering of the crumbled bacon they couldn't find anything else to do with and heavily burnt potatoes, the eggs were just as bad as they were over cooked rubbery disks. 

On a positive note they did offer to take it off my check or replace it with food cooked by the owner but by that point my appetite was gone and my party had finished their meal with much the same disdain.

1536457,2016-01-18,0,v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg,"This is my favorite breakfast place in Henderson! It's in my top two for the valley. If you come during ""normal"" breakfast hours, it will most likely be busy. I usually want breakfast in the afternoon, so by 1pm or so, it's not as crazy.

Everything I've had here is delicious. My favorite item is the plain bagel with cream cheese. Simple, right? It is amazing!! It gets super crispy and is my favorite all time bagel. The french toast, eggs and bacon are also yummy.

When a place serves breakfast and lunch, I'm always torn. I go here for breakfast but sometime lunch looks so good. One time I ordered the Travis Pastrami. Oh My Gosh! Talk about delicious! I loved it! It is kinda messy, so I prefer to order it to go. 
 
I think the prices are reasonable here. They have a monster option to upgrade the size of your food for around $3 but I think the portions are big enough. This is my go to breakfast spot in Henderson!

FYI, this is random but they sell a lot of old school candy by the register. Kinda weird for a breakfast place but if you're into hard to find candy, you would probably like it!",UL5K2rnSYIPD1LcqPgbmDQ,2,1,5,FvIAYWlWQjcOYNYiWt-uNQ

The only thing that wasn't perfect (for me anyway) stems from the fact that the place is on Eastern, facing the rising sun, hence the name I guess. We got there when they opened at 7am (after work) and every booth and table I saw was completely bathed in blinding sunlight, and there are no curtains or blinds to be found on the windows. It's kind of a trivial thing to complain about, but it's hard to pay attention to your food or your breakfast companion when you're squinting from the blazing sunlight.

Arrived around 10-ish on a Sunday, so expected a crowd and was not let down. Parking in front was full, however, there was plenty of parking around the side of the building. Hostess was kind and attentive-took our names and estimated a 25-minute wait for first available (outside, bar, or table), which I thought was pretty fast given the crowd waiting outside. We grabbed a cup of coffee next door and found a couple of shaded seats while we waited. Our Hostess nailed the wait time - we were happy and surprised and gladly accepted two seats at the bar. The full crowd inside made for a very loud diner, and sitting at the bar exposed us to the hustle of staff serving, cleaning, answering phones, and closing out checks. A quieter mid-morning Sunday breakfast/brunch experience is most likely outside, but we had no issues at all with the noise level or energy while at the bar. Matthew was our server, and was fantastic. Even though the place was packed, there was no rush at all. We ordered 2 waters (already had drinks ordered during the wait), and 2 Jacob's Slammin' Platters. Order to service took about 10 minutes, and orders were correctly served. Food was good. The Platter comes with 2 eggs, sausage, bacon, Canadian bacon, hash browns, 4 silver dollar pancakes, and toast. A healthy serving of food for under $10. The meal tasted good, eggs were cooked to order, and the meats, toast and pancakes were all very good. Personally, I thought the pancake batter was delicious. We finished our plates, Matthew topped off our drinks several times, and explained there was no rush to pay when he dropped off the check (keep in mind, mid-morning breakfast rush on Sunday, with a healthy que waiting for tables). From check-in to payment we spent about an hour to an hour and 15 min at OSC. Needless to say, we had a good experience and recommend anyone in the area to give OSC a shot, we did, and were not disappointed.",nFluMKWtOasmjXheW4Wo5g,0,0,4,aHtmaIy0GZkO4t_EmcG81Q

After much deliberating we chose this great little spot. Our waitress was so attentive and quick. When I asked how their OJ was they brought me a sample, both my husband and I ended up ordering 2 larges. Delicious! When we asked our servers favorite, she gave us tops choices in a few sections with just the right amount of insider tips. Half way through the meal I realized we got 3 of the 4 things she recommended. The Bueno Beni on a toasted Kaiser roll (super tasty eggs Benedict with a kick), ranchero wrap (with bacon added at her suggestion), and the crunch berry French toast. Everything was spot on and we basically licked each plate. Probably way more food than you typically need for 2 people, but after the long hot hike it was AMAZING!

Came with a Yelper friend and split the Brooklyn Benedict and the Ultimate French Toast, and enjoyed both! Kitchen didn't mind splitting the dishes for us. I like how their Benedicts use bagels as the base, which makes them a little heartier. A half portion is really enough, and the hash browns were nicely crunchy. The toast had pecans and hints of toffee in the batter. I don't like sweet treats for breakfast and appreciated that the flavor wasn't overwhelming.

Before I entered I had heard good things about this place so was a bit put off but not unreasonably so. We were greeted and seated within a reasonable amount of time (it was like 11:00 am so I would hope so) and handed menus and placed a drink order that was filled immediately. So far so good.

Like my quest for good Q, I have a thing for great pastrami. There are a few places in LV that do pastrami ok, but here was a cafe with one of the most unlikely sandwiches I could think of on the menu. They call it ""The 215"", (probably because the 215 freeway is a couple hundred yards away) and it is a pastrami, turkey, and slaw stack sandwich. Any of you Deli Heads recognize this recipe? It is the #11 at most deli's or what is known as ""The Sky High"". This is a good sandwich and from a pretty discriminating deli fan that is saying a lot. OK, it's not Canters Deli in LA, but it kinda reminds me of it. The only strange thing is they put it on a soft roll, not a Kaiser Roll, but then again, I have a feeling these people do not have a clue what real deli food is, they just got lucky. Look, they had crosses for sale and I am betting the place is owned by good Christians. Hey, no problem, just I am not seeing a lot of deli understanding, just good copying.

My wife ordered a Feta Burger. Feta, spinach, a sauce and a burger on the same soft bun and my wife enjoyed it. Side were acceptable. Beverages (Iced Tea and Iced Coffee) were fresh and tasty. Service was attentive to the point of maybe being too attentive. (There is something to be said for not being asked if everything is ok every 4 minutes.)

I would come back here again, but honestly I do not see what the rave is all about. If doing a respectable job and having respectable food is now a 4 and 5 star dining experience I think people need to learn to be a little tougher in their reviews. This is a solid 3 star place and places it on the ""diners I would visit again"" list. Heck i would even take friends there. 5 stars, no. 4 stars, not likely, but a solid 3 stars with confidence.

---

My wife and I had an interesting conversation about why things are served in a deli. Whether the owners of deli's know it or not there is a reason for what is on the table and what is served as sides. It all has to do with how they make the meal taste. Why are there pickles on the table at a deli? Simple, to cleanse your palette and open your taste buds to the spices to come. Why are all the side on a deli plate kind of creamy? Also simple, to knock out any strong spices in your mouth. It is almost the same idea when you eat Q actually. So, a bite of pickle, a bite of the sandwich and then a bite of the slaw (repeat) creates a great way of maintaining a great tasting meal instead of having the strong pepper (piper nigrum) of a good pastrami sandwich blow out your taste buds. These are Food 101 concepts, but it is surprising how few people understand them and apply them. It is easier to copy a menu than to grok it.",h2Ph6OQiFTY1J6CtRWJzLg,1,1,3,qxENcem2UkDDvXl-JpR-NQ

If you do happen to go on a Saturday or Sunday (Especially Sunday) morning, be prepared to wait ~15-20 minutes. The time goes by fast and you normally do not wait long, but there are around 30 tables & bar area (not alcoholic).

2084413,2015-06-19,1,v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg,"I enjoyed my breakfast here this past Sunday, suggested by the lovely Allison S. We got there around 10ish and it was busy, but there was no wait for 2 seats at the counter which we happily took. Our server was nice, he took our drink order then let us browse the menu. They have a big 2 sided menu with breakfast and lunch options. The menu was not too big, not too small, but justttt right. I hate when a menu is a bazillion pages long. One thing that I found odd was there was no side items on the menu for either lunch or dinner. I knew I wanted an egg breakfast, but I thought I might have also wanted pancakes and it would have been nice if there were a side option. 

Anyway we both ordered breakfast. My dining companion went with the bagel and lox platter which is essentially just a bagel with cream cheese, lox, and a few toppings. I was in the mood for eggs benedict and Sunrise had 6 different options for me to choose from. I was torn between the veggie benedict and the fiesta benedict, which I ultimately chose. It had jalapeno bacon, pepper jack cheese and eggs, smothered in a fiesta hollandaise on top of an everything bagel. Both meals came with potatoes that were okay, but I had to douse in ketchup and Frank's chili lime sauce for flavor.

So I've never had eggs benedict served on a bagel before, which you can choose your flavor by the way, and while it was good, it was hard to cut because the bagel was toasted. Sure I could have just shoved the whole thing in my mouth, but I was with company and didn't want to embarrass myself =P. I got to try Allison's bagel and lox, which was loaded up with capers, tomatoes and onions. It was good but something I eat often, and can make at home.

I though the dish was flavorable and had a kick, which was what I was looking for. I poured a little of the Hollandaise over it but nothing near what it could have been.

Boy am I glad I did. The best breakfast I've had in Las Vegas without a doubt. The signature 'snow caps' were amazing. Basically bites of bagel, deep fried, served with cinnamon and sugar, a side of blueberry sauce and cream cheese icing. They're nothing short of phenomenal.

I also went with the banana fosters pancakes I believe. They were SO good. 

My mom went with one of the Benedict's and said it was absolutely one of the best she's ever had. 

We went on a Saturday around 1130 and waited 15 minutes or so for a table for 4. 

One of the biggest things I took away from OSC was the GREAT service. We had interaction with not only our waiter but 3 other employees who visited the table and ALL were beyond friendly. I'm big on customer service so this was huge for me.

Of course, I expected a wait on a Sunday at 11:30am. No problem, the weather was beautiful and the servers brought around samples of chocolate banana nut bread, which was yummy. The wait time was about 30 minutes. 
 
However, once were seated, that's where things went a bit downhill.  We were seated at a tiny table in a corner RIGHT by the bathroom. Really? A table shouldn't have even been there in the first place. Not only were we subjected to people walking right up against our food while they were going to and from the restroom, there were a number of flies circling throughout our meal. Since the restaurant was packed, there was nowhere else to move.

Okay.. let's just try to focus on the food and service. The service was great- very attentive, and they must have asked us if they could top off our coffee about 10 times. Toward the end of the meal, we started feeling rushed. I know they were trying to turn the table, but I hate feeling like they are ready for us to get the heck out!

The food was good, and a good value. The omelettes were nicely sized, and came with potatoes and toast for $8.99. My friend opted to get sliced bananas instead of potatoes (I know-weird), but they came with a hair attached. Yuck.  

I'm not going out of my way to return, but I am not opposed to giving them another shot. Just one more, though.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,2,1,3,J1h_vaza6PtgIrewE4DvPQ

The food I tried was awesome!! The ""Sunrise Snowcaps""  were addictive!!

The lox was good quality but not in large quantity; the capers added a nice brininess, and red onion complimented the dish. The least appealing aspect was the tomatoes which were slightly mushy and not super flavorful.  The dish came with a side of skillet grilled potatoes which were good even though under-seasoned.  The others in my party had the classic breakfast with bacon, eggs, toast, and potatoes and their only complaint was that their eggs weren't cooked as ordered, but good nonetheless.

After reading the many favorable reviews for The Original Sunrise Cafe we were looking forward to checking this place out. The comparison to the Hash House A Go-Go, one of our favorite breakfast joints in town, really had our juices flowing. The Garden of Eden omelet sounded enticing to my girlfriend and the Pretzel Sunrise Burger is one of those interesting menu items that I just can't keep from ordering.

I'm sad to report that The Original Sunrise Cafe did not live up to the expectation. We arrived just before 9 am on a Saturday and there were still a few tables open, so we didn't have to wait. The hostess was very pleasant and put us in a decent table. The menu was varied and as original as a breakfast menu can get. Our food was prepared very quickly and brought to us without delay. That's the good part.

To begin with, our waiter didn't seem like he wanted to be there. He was not rude to us, but it seemed that whatever he was doing the night before was interrupted by this work-thing that he had to get up for. 

The Garden of Eden omelet was mediocre. The eggs were fully cooked but the veggies weren't drained very well and this resulted in a watery substance that oozed onto the whole plate. This made the texture of the omelet less than desirable. While my GF was happy that she had the option of fruit instead of a starch, it certainly didn't seem to be freshly prepared. It more seemed that they picked up a fruit bowl at Smiths or Vons and used that. Her bagel was fine, but it was a plain sesame bagel and there wasn't much of a choice. The bagels at The Cracked Egg are better, of a more firm texture, not the lighter bready kind.

My Sunrise Pretzel Burger was a disappointment. I LOVE soft pretzels and really love sandwiches made on them. This was more of a bread that resembled a pretzel than actually being a big soft pretzel. The worst part, however, was the burger. Not only did it seem to be a prepared burger (where the restaurant receives it cooked and they basically reheat it), but it didn't seem to be all meat/beef. It was that fine texture indicitive of filler. I ate half and took half home, but I honestly don't know if I'll eat it as leftovers (I LOVE leftovers as much as I love pretzels!)

There is no comparison to the Hash House A Go-Go and if you are willing or able to drive over to that part of the town it is well worth the effort. For a better alternative closer to this place, I'd recommend the Cracked Egg on Green Valley just north of the 215.",_fFpucW8mSKvFJ46zSJCrg,1,0,2,WkPlvjgG22Goci2jQw1h-A

2228511,2013-01-01,1,v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg,"This place is packed, but I was really impressed by their friendly hostess and wait staff, and their quick quick service! There were a lot of people waiting in front of us, and I thought we were in for a long wait, but the hostess asked us if we were ok with counter seating, and we were, so we literally glanced at the menu and our name was called.  Counter seating is a bit tight if you're a bigger person, just FYI.

We had a craving for eggs Benedict, but noticed this place does it on bagels, not English muffins. This was almost a deal breaker,but I'm glad we didn't leave and just stuck around and ate here. We ended up getting the LEO sandwich on a kaiser roll. LEO is lox,egg, onion. The lox is lightly cooked, so it doesn't have the regular raw texture to it like I'm used to. But this was good. It was perfectly cooked so it was soft still, the eggs fluffy, and the onions translucent but not caramelized. IMO perfect. The kaiser roll was topped with poppy seeds and very soft as well, and the cream cheese was generous. The potatoes it came with were better than the Doritos flavored ones from Egg and I. These were more like hash browns, and were really good with the lime and chili Franks Redhot sauce they have there.

We also got the prime rib eggs beni. It's on a roll also, with thinly cut prime rib, with grilled onions, cheese, and scrambled egg topped with hollandaise sauce. It's like a Philly cheese steak with egg.  Very good! The beef was very tender, and I didn't see any traces of fat. This also came with potatoes, but you can also opt for fruit, I think bananas.

Service like I said was so fast it shocked me. From the time we entered till we got our food was probably no more than 15 mins. Coffee was refilled quickly too. People do tend to camp out here even after they are done eating, but the staff still refill their coffee and don't rush people out. Personally I hate when people do that, ESP if there are a lot of people waiting, i think its rude. But we scarfed down our food and were happily on our way.

The only reason this place didn't get five stars from me is its a bit on the pricey side for breakfast. Hopefully I can come back sometime soon and try lunch. Btw they are only open until 3pm.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,1,1,4,o5DQVP8E1KzfaCN5nGSrsw

2318503,2017-09-28,0,v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg,"Excellent. Most impressed. First time here and I'm sure glad I picked this place for breakfast. 

The place has a little of an East coast feel with the seating but then there's an outside sitting area which blends the West coast style. 

But, the menu, the service, the food, and the prices were everyone's style. 

Cool menu! I was having a hard time deciding what to get because literally every item sounded good. They have mostly breakfast but there's also lunch. We ordered breakfast. 

Specifically came here for the eggs Benedict. I actually typed in eggs Benedict into my search engine and this was the first place to pop up. So, I figured I would give it a try. I was not disappointed. 

I ordered the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict and requested to get the eggs over medium instead of how the menu suggests, with scrambled. The fresh smell of cayenne and possibly paprika filled my nose with an excitement when the dish arrived. The sight of the fresh, hand-made, hash browns was sending my taste buds into overdrive and I'm quite sure I drooled a little before I could even pick up my silver ware. It was De Lish Us. So perfectly prepared, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly portioned. 

She ordered the egg white omelette. It was vibrant in color from the fresh veggies that were still bursting with freshness. Cooked just right to keep their firmness but not so much to lose their color. 

The server was very respectful and timely, always asking for a coffee refill just when I needed it, not just when she passed like often times other severs do. She checked before asking, very simple tactic which is a great indication that the server is paying attention but so many fail to do. Her friendliness, even in the middle of being loaded with several tables at once, was also impressive. This is what happens when I restaurant works good together. If the food is good then it makes the servers job more smooth and then the server is able to handle what they normally should be able to do, but if the food is bad then it makes the servers job much harder with complaining, unhappy guests. The server has plenty to do already but having to explain item problems shouldn't be one. 

I will definitely recommend this great breakfast place to everyone I know.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,1,0,5,k4M_r--o6OM1FHYdxboZEw

That's no biggie, as we've waited longer for tables before. The issue we had was when ""friends"" entered the establishment. Those people waited maybe 10 minutes for a table. We kept getting bumped. That did not bode well, and we sure hoped the food was worth the wait. Meh...it really wasn't. We ended up waiting close to 40 minutes for a table, and after being seated, there was confusion about exactly where we were to sit. So, we shuffled between two tables until someone made a decision and put us at a table. Brendan (Brandon?) our server was the highlight. He was very kind. We ordered the ultimate french toast, which was okay, but we've had better. The pb/jam french toast is pretty unique, and my child loved it. I had an omelet, which came with hash browns, and it was okay. I've had just as good elsewhere. We also ordered corned beef hash, and it tasted salty, according to my spouse, and I thought it tasted like the canned stuff we prepare at home. 

Overall, we expected a wait, as it was the weekend. However, the constant bumping of us down the seating priority (we counted probably 4-5 times we were bumped) was really the deal breaker. 

If you want a super good breakfast, go to the Beach Cafe, which is off Jones, in Las Vegas. Egg Works are good. Rise and Shine is good. Bite in Summerlin is good.

The restaurant is pretty unique. There's a standard open seating area, a bar area and in various places you can find nostalgic items for sale. We were seated right away. The menu features a variety of breakfast and lunch specialities - I opted for breakfast and chose Jacob's platter. It didn't take very long for our food to come out. Everything was hot and good, especially the potatoes. I would be completely content with a plate of cheese potatoes. I did taste their homemade turkey sausage, which is pretty awesome. They were pretty successful in making turkey taste just as good as pork - actually better.

Let me start with the pancakes:  They were a good size about the size of a medium dinner plate.  One of the pancake seemed a little over cooked as the outside was a bit darker then the other two and a little tougher.  The give a small amount of syrup but you can always ask for more.

Eggs benedict:  The hollandaise was just so so meaning it was light but too buttery and needed a little kick (maybe a hint of fresh lemon juice).  There was nothing special about the sausage just your typical sausage patty.  The touch of jalapenos was good; however it was drenched in jalapenos so it over powered everything else.  The eggs were perfectly poached and everything was served on top of an original bagel.  I've had eggs benedict on a traditional english muffin, croissant, and even hawaiian bread and I have to admit having it on a bagel is not something I particularly care for.  It is just too much.  

As for the potatoes: they're hash brown style cut a little thicker then your traditional hash browns.  Their grilled to a crisp on the outside and soft to the bite.  Made with lotsa butter though that's why it tasted so good.

At the end of our meal they gave my 4 year old a pick at their treasure chest and that made him happy.  I would come back and maybe try something different.  So, just A-ok for now...maybe will get a better  rating next time.",75COHfu_drTAx1G9rtZnAA,2,1,3,qNOA9HdkNexwzQAoscPlGA

My meal came, it was two sunny side eggs on top of spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes and an everything bagel. The bagel was soft and chewy and loaded with butter. Didn't taste much like other everything bagels that I have had, but it was good.

I don't even know where to start with this review! 

First & foremost, everybody who works here is so kind and sweet. They all matched each other's level of friendliness. They're service was fast, efficient, and very welcoming. Troy was our server, he was very attentive without being too suffocating. He made great suggestions. They have a great menu. 

It was our first time here. YELP BROUGHT US HERE :) 

We ordered the Turkey Links & Eggs as well as the Crunchberry French Toast. The Turkey links were perfectly cooked. They weren't greasy or overcooked & dried out. The flavor was great. The potatoes had a nice, crisp finish to them. And the Crunchberry French Toast.... OH. MY. GOD. Seriously to die for. They serve it with a blueberry cream cheese frosting & powdered sugar. They also brought around a blueberry jam/syrup. It's made in house, btw! The flavors just really blended perfectly. 

We will be back very soon!

The Original Sunrise Cafe was packed! However, with good luck on our side we were seated in about five minutes.  The cafe had a nice vibe and was filled with people.  Fresh coffee was....well....Vegas cafe coffee; nuff said.  After a few glances around the menu we both noted how they covered several breakfast categories but only offered a small selection for each. 

We both decided on omelets and OSC offers egg white versions of every omelet.  I have to say that my omelet the Eggzilla (Egg whites, spinach, roasted peppers and salsa topped with sunrise garlic sauce and jack cheese) was pretty good.  Although, Ashley D's omelet was nothing to write home about; sadly.  Overall, for $8.99 they come with a bagel/toast on the side making it a decent deal.

So I ordered last week the same thing and this time I go to pay and my total was different so I looked at the receipt and saw that they charged me for the full Benedict with turkey and a side of 1 piece of sausage for $4!!!!!!! So I asked the lady at the counter who is always nice what happened so she went and got another lady. I asked her why I was being charged differently from 2 weeks ago when I had got the same thing and she told me ""the person who rang you up last time did it wrong"". So someone has been ringing me up wrong for a year because that's how long i have been ordering this.

By far the best selection of Eggs Benedict dishes (5), and only ~$10ea. I ate the Fiest Benedict - which had a toasted bagel, basted egg (perfectly cooked), Jalapeno Bacon, and pepper jack cheese. It was coated with a spicy hollandaise sauce, that was simply devine. The best Eggs Benedict I've ever eaten. Very unique. I loved it. Even the potatoes had great flavor and crispness. 

My friend had the coolest Banana Cream Pie Pancakes... banana syrup, bananas on top, and dulce de leche whipped butter!!! YUMMMM. Comes with 3 cakes. The coolest thing by far was the Jalapeno Bacon! Excellent flavor, worth the money to have a taste of this. Several pieces to a side, so it's a good value.

This place is your classic diner spot located in a strip mall. Sadly this is the norm in Vegas, but it doesn't take away from the fact that this place is actually a great option for breakfast and brunch.

I highly recommend the snowcaps. Bagels cut into small pieces, pan fried in butter and topped with powdered sugar. These little sugar bombs will definitely shattered any diet plan you had going for you, so I would share these with your brunching buddy. Trust me, they give you plenty. 

The omelets and benedict's here are very good and satisfying, no small portions at the Sunrise, but my favorite is the Fiesta Benedict. An open-faced bagel with jalapeno bacon, pepper jack cheese, two eggs and a spicy hollandaise sauce, this meal is amazing and really has a great kick of heat. The hollandaise sauce is rich and creamy and the eggs are cooked to that perfect point of soft/medium yolk. 

I would avoid Sunday mornings and come right around 12:30pm, right as the crowds start to disband and there's no wait for a seat.

All in all I think I've been here about 6 or 7 times in the last 4 years and they hit a home run every single time I've dined. Always had breakfast items and never lunch so my experiences are a bit one-sided.

It's always very busy on weekends during the breakfast-brunch hours and usually there is a wait to get a table. It was me and a couple buddies and ones fiance after a night of drinking a few brews. Comfort food was in need. We walked up at about 10:30 saturday and they said it would be 10-15 mins for a table, but we could sit at the bartop right away if we wanted it. We chose the bartop and immediately got waters, menus, and silverware. The waters are big which is very nice after a night of drinking and becoming dehydrated.

We all quickly scanned the menus and ordered. I got the Jacob's Slammin Platter and it was large and fantastic and was about all I could put down. The eggs (scrambled) were perfect, the country potatoes were awesome and crispy.  The 1 sausage patty, 2 strips of bacon, 1 Canadian bacon slice, and the 4 mini pancakes were all perfectly cooked for me as well. It also came with 4 half slices of toast, two were a little bitty bit burned for me, but I was full anyway so I just nibbled on the toast at the end of the meal. 

Everybody in my party was extremely pleased with the food, service and speed, price, and location. We all crashed at my buddies house which is near GVR so it was just 3 or so miles down the road. We all went back to the house happy and fat, and didn't take a hug chunk out of our wallets. You can see on the yelp business page for OSC snap-shots of the menu, prices are all in the $6-10 dollar range for most meals, and there's plenty of food in each of the ones I've had.",aQpbee0jhvIgiMN8HZJPRA,0,0,5,0eyk-RQcIfPshTZ4RT8ZzQ

-Friendly waitress. I had a good banter with her and she kept the conversation flowing. Also very quick to refill coffee and water.

-I went with the Fiesta Benedict on everything bagel as my meal. Not too bad. You at least get a good portion. Wasn't a huge fan of the fiesta Hollandaise sauce, but it's at least creative.

 -There's also seats near the bathroom if there's a line, and an odd amount of religious crosses on wall. I'm not sure if this is a big Christian establishment or not, but either way, good food on your way into Sin City.",i2KocsDcufoW5PNi_1LJnQ,3,1,4,9zyMsiG3KeHqOCIdzxi5jg

There's lots of ample seating, and the service was fast and friendly. There's an older crowd that comes in (kinda like early-morning grandparents that like to go out for breakfast and coffee), but that doesn't really take away from the experience.

I got to taste the Brooklyn Benedict. It looks just as good as it does in the first picture. It comes in two giant pieces dripping in hollondaise sauce. It's got some turkey bits inside, which was different, but it went well with it. The whole piece was topped on top of an everything bagel, which I guess is where the Brooklyn name comes from, and it tastes very good with it! I didn't expect that at all. Only thing is that the bagel (like any other bagel) is very hearty, moreso than the normal bread you would get. So it's extremely filling. But it tasted great in combination.

Also got to try the Crunchberry Toast. It's french toast with what seems to be small bits of colorful cereal meshed into egg/batter that surrounds the bread. It's very good, but very sweet. So I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a sweet tooth (as if the maple syrup wasn't sweet enough), but I was able to manage through a few bites. I probably wouldn't be able to finish a whole plate by myself though, because I'm not a big sweets guy myself. But otherwise it was still really good.

If you're looking for coffee. It's horrible. Don't even bother. Get juice or something. Coffee we had was extremely watery. I tried to mask it with cream and sugar (I usually drink my coffee black), but I still couldn't handle it and didn't take more than 4 sips from my mug.",Zukq_iyq6bItd9NBiur13g,0,0,4,E7xUehLpJZykd6_gXWloZg

I was waiting for my boyfriend to get out of surgery and was basically strong armed into eating here since it was the only place open at 7AM that wasn't a bar or a chain restaurant. 

Typical breakfast menu omelettes, the sweet stuff, the skillets, the eggs benedicts, the works. 

They serve their eggs benedicts on bagels (my super palate can detect the get their bagels from Great Buns Bakery) and have a variety of toppings. I didn't see any with turkey bacon or turkey sausage on any of the menu items, so I asked, and the waitress said yes, but for an additional charge. I 100% understand the need to charge more for something that is more expensive, but when I'm just swapping something it's annoying to be charged for trying to go for the healthier option. 


The food itself was standard. I was a little turned off by the turkey bacon since it looked a little gray. I picked it off and just ate the rest. I feel like all breakfast places are pretty similar when it comes to eggs, hash browns, & the rest of the goods. The hollandaise was okay I wish there was more.

The star of the meal was the banana pancake infused with banana, topped with fresh banana slices and generously smothered with walnuts. Perfect balance was achieved by adding syrup and the dulce de leche butter, which was unique and just delicious!

I see a lot of so-so experiences and I can see why...it can get quite busy especially in the morning on weekends. I'm not making an excuse for them and maybe they need to improve staffing on the weekends, but I believe you as customer should also speak up, instead of sitting there pissed off. Let yourself be heard, those guys running around are there for you...flag them down-you're allowed that. As a business i'm sure they are open to constructive criticism. 

You can't miss the place. They are on Eastern across from Moon Nursery. They are in the same lot as Yogurtland,  LVAC, Pho Saigon, and Starbucks. Plus you will see their bright orange SUNRISE on the building.

The inside is big and clean. They have inside and outside seatings. If you have a large party, just call ahead and they will accommodate you. There is also have a breakfast bar towards the back of the restaurant if you don't want to sit at a table.

We wished that they would open earlier but their hours are 7am to 3pm everyday. We come here so much that we don't look at the menu. We get seated and just order...it makes it easier for our server. We order the Traditional Sunrise with eggs & canadian bacon. Its a Sourdough french toast with banana's, maple syrup, & granola- It's ONO! They also have good fluffy blueberry pancakes. The banana cream pie pancakes are disgustingly good...it's a big order, enough to share with someone. The kids go for the ham and cheese omelette- it is what it is and the kids love it. If it wasn't good, trust me, they would say so. I've had the Dave-zilla- egg whites, spinach, sausage, & cheese. It's enough to fill you up without weighing you down. And when Im watching my girlish figure (usually before the winter holiday parties) I order it w/out cheese. We've also tried the Power Wrap-grilled chix, egg whites, & salsa, and the steak and egg wrap, both are very good. They also have salads (you can create your own), all kinds of wraps (breakfast, lunch, and healthy), burgers, and specialty sandwiches. They serve Shangri La iced T which is always a plus for us...the common lipton iced tea is nasty. You can also buy the Tea from them, as well as other stuff like, candy, protein shakes, and other drinks that they sell in their drinks display.

We haven't gone their for anything but breakfast but you could order lunch items anytime. We'll have to try something from their lunch menu, but its tough because I love breakfast food!",jR00ESlM7Rmg9tFYwMbh4A,3,2,4,_tJd4EmAlOJfnUlri_BokQ

Firstly... the food: The Bueno Beni was great. The eggs were perfectly done and the spiciness added with the salsa and fresh jalepenos was a great twist on your normal eggs beni. would certainly get this again. The wife got some sort of healthy omelette which seemed good, but she's a breakfast rookie and hence doesn't understand that the meal is all about maximizing grease, butter and hollandaise. But you can do that if it's your thing. Looked good. 

Second... service: What you'd hope for for breakfast. Quick. Not in your face... more just to facilitate you getting in and out and keep your coffee and water full. We sat at the counter, which was a little cramped, but was the quickest way to get a seat.  Overheard a couple next to us which sent back a meal for a reason that was completely not the fault of the server/restaurant, and he dealt with it very professionally... it reminded me of why i'm not cut out for food service.

Third.... price: very reasonable. You're far away enough from the strip that you dont have to deal with the whole 3,000% markup thing.

They have an outdoor eating area, and this place does get fairly busy on the weekends. it is a cafe which revolves around a pet friendly, family environment. I think what I love about the place is that although they serve items that you can usually get from other cafe's, some of their items are different from other places.

I have ordered the STEAK AND EGG WRAP for $8.29 and its huge! It comes with potatos on the side so you don't feel like you've spent so much on just the wrap. You also have the option of the TYPE of wrap you'd like. You can do wheat, chipotle, or sundried tomatoe. I usually get the Sundried. If you're a meat lover and all protien. Definitely get the Steak and Egg wrap. It's deliscious and does contain big chunks of steak slices so you feel satisfied.

I've also tried the STEVIE T'S WRAP  which is also deliscious but expect it to be REALLY filling and sweet thanks to the pancake and maple syrup. It was a good wrap, but the sweetness and thickness of the wrap honestly doesn't satisfy my appetite. It just makes you feel like the wrap itself is filling up my stomach for the sake of it. BUT! Don't be discouraged. If you're into sweetness and pancakes definitely go for the wrap. It'll be worth while.

The service is great, but because they are always busy they don't conversate so much with you. They do get the job done though, and someone is always asking if you need helped or if you have been served.",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,1,0,4,SX-TaszLE-D-kQ6avljKdA

I usually get the same things, but looking at the other pictures, I need to branch out a bit! I get either the traditional French toast, the Plainview Diner or the Californian.

The Californian has turkey, the usual veggies of mushrooms, onions, spinach and topped with - and here's the CA part - avocados, tomatoes and jack cheese. The French toast is pretty standard.

what i ate:
- cajun prime rib beni: garlic toast topped with thinly sliced prime rib, topped with savory sauteed mushrooms, thin tender scrambled egg, and smothered with an amazing hollandaise sauce. uh, why can i have this every morning? this was so amazing. the only problem i had with it was that i couldnt really taste the ""cajun"" part of the cajun prime rib. but seriously, who the heck cares, this was so tasty! came with a side of hash browns that was very tasty, but the beni took center stage

pros:
- food: the beni was amazing. the potatoes were also amazing. the coffee was delicious
- huge portions! i could barely finish the beni and i barely had much of my potatoes. 
- service: just right for this type of brunch place. our coffee cups were always full
- no wait! though, we came in during the week. they were bustling and busy, but there were empty tables. and the turnaround was fairly quick.  
- clean bathroom
- a few tables were on the patio area for people and their dogs. though, i guess it's a very locals thing; i could barely stand being outside in the heat, even if it was in the shade

cons:
- location: definitely a locals spot. this was a bit far from the strip, so i doubt id be back for breakfast.

3763141,2015-11-03,0,v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg,"As much as it pains me to write a POOR review, I truly feel this one is very well deserved. I met with friends here for breakfast expecting to have a relaxing morning filled with great food and company, instead what our group received was quite the opposite. Upon reviewing the menu I was a bit stumped as to why most all of the omelettes were $13. bucks a piece. Since I had never been here before I figured these were going to be big, fluffy and loaded omelettes like the one's at Original Pancake...I couldn't wait! After we ordered from an absolutely no personality waiter, we quite literally NEVER saw him again for the entire meal. In fact the entire experience from that point became without service and quite SELF SERVICE! 

Now on to the food...The pastrami omelette was essentially and empty, flat, two egg piece of misery filled with absolutely nothing but nasty grilled onions. Pastrami? What pastrami? The Caesar salad was small, contained too much dressing, very little LOW QUALITY lettuce and had NO love put into it's preparation. Back to the service, they took my bagel away to put cream cheese on it as I had ordered it and never came back. No waiter to tell, no drink refills once ever during the meal. I actually had to get up and go over to the front counter to ask for my bagel, some ketchup, drink refills and to let them know of the disappearance of our waiter. They acted with very little concern, but did finally bring the things I had asked for. Bagel arrived 3/4's of the way through my crappy omelette. My other guests food was prepared with Slop Shop style and the chefs (I mean guys off the street) were obviously preparing food as if they were making food for their dorm buddies. 

Overpriced crappy food (BTW - Menu pics on here are 30% less than current prices).  Absolutely non-caring service staff (Might have been better off in an old folks home cafeteria). Chefs that aren't actually chefs, rather Slop Shop egg flingers. And finally, NO SERVICE, and I mean √ëONE once waiter took the order.

I truly cannot believe the Overrated Hype and reviews this place has received! Is it that so many people have just come to expect mediocre at best service, food and high prices due to their food inexperience? Could it be that the patrons of this establishment no nothing of good food, good service and value? Or has everyone just come to expect third-world quality in this day and age here in Vegas? I'm sooooo conflicted about these questions. I wish people were more accurate when describing their experiences through this format. If so, I would have NEVER wasted my time here.

If you want real breakfast in Vegas, go to Weiss Deli, Original Pancake, or even any casino coffee shop. This terrible food is a direct reflection of customers willingly allowing such an establishment to continue to succeed. Folks...Please complain on the spot about crappy food, bad service and overpriced garbage. I have no issues paying dearly for excellent quality food, but honestly an Egg McMuffin would have much better satisfied my breakfast desires than this place!

So the manager comes to the table and from the start approached the situation with a mild attitude "" I talked to the chef and he said there was and is NO WAY that could have got in your food"" insinuating as if I were lying. Then she proceeded to tell me ""Well I'm sorry about that but there is nothing I can do"" after a few seconds of standing there awkwardly shrugging like she didn't know what to tell us, she took the rock and walked away. We were all stunned. Not sure what kind of experience she has as a manager but that is an inexcusable way for you treat any customer that just broke a tooth (which is now constantly sensitive) on a rock that was in their food in their establishment.

The Hollandaise was utterly tasteless, which kinda negates the whole point of the dish.

Every once in a while I'll branch out & try something different, today I had banana cream pie pancakes...WOW! The bananas are sliced & cooked Into the batter, then topped with slices & pecans. They were so moist & delish I didn't bother with syrup! They come with whipped maple butter, it's so yummy you can simply eat it! Not that I did, just saying it's an option! The eggs are always cooked exactly as ordered. It's not rocket science but it does seem to be a lot to ask in many restaurants to get your eggs as ordered, but that's not the case here. On the weekends they serve homemade oatmeal, it's a big draw so go early because once it's gone, it's gone. My hubby loves the stuff.

The place was very busy when I got here about 10 AM on a Tuesday morning.  The hostess asked me if I wanted a table and I asked if they had a counter.  They do and she took me there immediately.  The counter area was relatively empty.  From where I sat, it  looked like the place was once a pizza joint because of the oven along the wall there.

Regardless, I was given a menu and brought a mug of coffee very quickly.  I then checked out the pancake/waffle section but they all seemed like they'd be larger breakfasts that I wanted to get.

I settled on the Brooklyn Benedict which consists of two basted eggs on an open faced bagel with turkey cubes, spinach, and melted Swiss cheese all topped with Hollandaise.  It was excellent!  You are given a choice of bagel and I opted for the sesame bagel.  The combination of flavors--the turkey, Swiss cheese, and spinach--was wonderful!  The bene also came with potatoes.  I could have had fruit but why spoil a good breakfast?

Coffee was refilled often and I was asked if I wanted a cup to go at no charge.  The staff was very accommodating and service was top notch.

I wouldn't hesitate to return for breakfast here.  It is very good and they have a large variety of breakfast dishes.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,13,4,4,aogwCeomXK47rzNQXS-rmQ

Sunrise cafe at least once a week. The food comes out really quick even when they are busy which is always awesome, and there are tons of menu options to choose from whether you like traditional breakfast or are feeling adventurous. My personal thing to order is the Crunchberry French Toast. It is absolutely delicious, and the portions are good sized. If you are looking for a Benedict they have tons of options here too, whether you want to go with a traditional benny or go for the short rib benny you really can't go wrong. The other really cool thing about this is the craft soda pop offerings. Sunrise has a huge selection of craft soda pop more than I actually have seen in most grocery stores, and there craft sodas are constantly changing so always keep checking back for more. But if you are more into your regular soda pops like sprite, coke, etc they have those too as well One of the favorite ones I've tried was the coffee cola, but they also have root beer, honey lemonade, etc. The atmosphere is a bit louder more like a diner so if you are looking for an intimate setting this is not it.

4051479,2010-12-04,2,v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg,"Came here after the 5k Santa Run with my fellow runners today and got sat immediately even though It was pretty pack.  It's a cutesy spot that serves breakfast, wraps, sammiches, smoothie bar, and stuff.  

We all ordered their iced tea since my friends insist they have really good Tropical Iced Tea, and sure enough they were right.  I'm not a big fan of iced tea, so its remarkable that i was able to take another sip or in this case a refill.

For my meal I built an egg white omelet (99cent to sub egg white) with turkey, ham, and cheddar. It cames with hash brown and with choice of bread, but i skipped the bread because i knew i was going to order the Blueberry Pancake once it popped up as i skimmed through the menu. Sadly, the Blueberry Pancake was huge disappointment since my recent discovery http://www.yelp.com/biz/m-and-m-donuts-anaheim#hrid:cm5Iy1u9yABwimWy3pM5SQ. I was expecting that the berries would at least be infused in the with the pancake batter but they were just a regular pancakes made with blueberries toss in it.  Weak!  Oh, and my turkey in my omelet were big cube chunks of turkey similar to deli meat.  

Their stripped hash browns however were amazing. I'm a sucker for any stripped hash and OSC does their well. Each strips were cooked just right with a subtle yet hint of a distinctive flavor. I mean i could be the only one but the nip was so minute that i think they cook it in a meat flavor oil or something.  It was delish!


Overall I left the place and felt pretty good and not have over the top disgusting brekkie feeling. 3.5

4054686,2017-01-12,5,v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg,"Breakfast for lunch?  Yes, of course.  I love breakfast food!  I've been a fan of Sunrise Caf√© since this first time I step foot in here.  And guess what?  They specialize in just breakfast.  You can pretty much find all types of breakfast items at Sunrise Caf√©.  Their menu consist of eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, French toast, sandwiches, wraps, Benedicts, oatmeal, and even burgers.  My go-to meal is the Jacob's Slammin' Platter for $8.99 (eggs, silver dollar pancakes, bacon, Canadian bacon, sausage, potatoes, and choice of bread).  You really can't go wrong with that order.  Lately, I've been keeping it simple with a BYO Omelet for $8.99 or just 8 eggs with bacon.  ""The Lighter Side of Guilt"" is also on their menu, which is their healthier portions and lower calorie meals.  But who has time for that.  I have no complaints with the food.  The prices are great and the service has always been excellent. 

 

TIP #1:  $2 upcharge for egg whites.

TIP #2:  MAKE IT A MONSTER for an additional $3.25. They'll hook up the omelets.

TIP #3:  2 stars for the parking.

TIP #4:  This place can get really busy during the weekend mornings.  But it's perfect during lunch in the middle of the week.

TIP #5:  Country Potatoes Extra Crispy!!

TIP #6:  Try the Snow Caps (buttered fried bagel bites covered with cinnamon sugar). YOLO!

The waiter did not crack a single smile. I'm sorry, did my presence offend you? I tried to be nice and smile, but he wouldn't even make eye contact with us. He would walk by, ask a surly question, and stalk off. 

Now, look. I know, it was 7am. I'm not always a morning person, either. I get it. But if I'm working with the public you'd better believe I put on a morning person act. Especially since I, too, work for tips. I feel your pain, buddy... I do. But you're still a douche for treating nice customers like that. I brought a friend here because I'd had okay experiences before. I bet he will never trust my judgment again.

Our plates were brought out by a lady who had just walked in the door. Not sure if those mitts were washed before she touched them. That's neither here nor there. At least she was nearly friendly?

The hollandaise sauce was good, not spectacular, but pretty tasty. The bacon was sort of underwhelming. It was sort of thin and not really crispy. The breakfast potatoes were pretty good though. They were rather thickly shredded, and were fairly crispy.

It comes with fabulous sides of bananas, granola, raisins,blueberries and brown sugar.  The only bad dish I have had so far is the Banana Cream Pie pancakes-they cook the bananas in the batter, which makes the pancake taste like it is undercooked and gives a bad taste.

I had the Cajun Prime Rib Beni. This was a delicious combination of Texas Toast, prime rib, onions, mushrooms, and hollandaise sauce. Yum. The meat was delicious and sliced thin which was the perfect consistency for a dish like this. There was also Cajun seasoning on top that really added to the dish without overwhelming it. I also loved the hashbrowns served on the side and found that ketchup was unnecessary. 

My husband had the Steak & Egg Wrap. It was tasty, but definitely not the most exciting thing on the menu. My husband loved it.

I'm impressed this place was so busy considering the stiff competition of dining on Eastern, Henderson. This is a solid 4 Star breakfast/lunch joint that offers a diverse portfolio of eggs, sandwiches, meats and potatoes. This place is very unique in that egg whites seemed to be the preferred favorites. Right away I feel like this is a health conscious diner. 

I ordered the Jacob's platter and I must say that you definitely get the best bang for your buck with this item. I'm a man of variety so I do love the option of getting everything I want on a dish without the pesky additional charges. Poached eggs, home potatoes hash, jalepeno bacon, Canadian bacon, sausage patty, silver dollar pancakes, and a cinnamon bagel and cream cheese on the side for $8.99! Throw in a fantastic staff that works well together and you have yourself a fantastic breakfast.

Of course most importantly THE FOOD!  I just had a patty melt that restored my faith in humanity. The go to classic breakfast with sausage patties is the normal go to, but the banana pancakes are a sweet treat for sure. 

I could go on and on, but I won't. If you haven't been it's a must visit. And if you come once in awhile, come more often. It's only a few bucks more than a combo meal at a decent fast food place.",dpPffiVpyLqkV3aeoZqd6Q,1,0,5,ckfpb2ERhh_fHvnEXa2Ldg

Where do I start? The placed was not packed at all, the food was slow, the service was very fake, and the actual taste of the food itself was very lacking. When we walked in, the placed actually only had a handful of patrons, we then had to stand around and wait for a few minutes to be seated when there were clearly available waiters/waitresses. After being greeted by our waitress, it seemed she was not having a good day so we wanted to give the benefit of the doubt, but as time went on, she really was just plain unhappy to bring us our food and check on us. So after ordering our food and waiting 15-20 minutes for two of their basic sandwiches, we were excited to get something to eat. The sandwiches themselves were literally things we could have made at home in 10 minutes.

4605907,2017-01-31,0,v1AE1LLWDOqe8ubOzqKADg,"I have said it before and I will say it again, it is hard to make a breakfast place stand out as creative.   Eggs, Potatoes, Bacon... it's what people eat and simply cooked you might as well just go to Denny's.     

I love going to a place away from home, go to my Yelp and find somewhere that really does go the extra mile to deliver those same ingredients with an edge, a difference.  Sunrise Caf√© does exactly that and they do it with style!  No, when you walk in the door you aren't blown over with fancy d√©cor or a beautiful view.   It is in a little neighborhood strip mall at least 6 miles from the swarms of tourists on the Strip.  They blow you away with kindness!!  

I focused my attention on the Eggs Benedicts and the Omelets.  You can build your own or you can chose one of their creations.  I had the King's Highway Pastrami Omelet with Pastrami, Grilled onions Swiss Cheese and spiced mustard.  I should have had the Rye bread with it as it was recommended but opted for a bagel and cream cheese instead.   They have a Buffalo Omelet as well with chicken and Buffalo sauce or a LEO which is Lox, Eggs and Onions.  Most breakfasts come with some their own version of very wonderful hash browns.   

On my second visit the next day (yes--I enjoyed it that much) I had the Cajun Prime ribbed Benedict which was absolutely delicious.   Other tempting Benedicts were the Bueno Beni with sausage, onion, pepper jack and jalapeno peppers topped with salsa verde hollandaise and the Fiesta which offered jalapeno bacon.

They have other breakfasts as well and the French Toast selections look equally as amazing!!  Next time I go I think I might get the Peter Brady, a mound of potatoes topped with marinated seasoned pork chops topped with eggs, citrus chili sauce and no-sugar-added apple sauce.  

Everyone on the staff was amazing and you absolutely can tell that they love working there and a big happy family.   You will feel like family too when you eat there!",Uk3X2AypU8AqvcYEVf7s6Q,1,1,5,DImyuXK6qFLLBIQxCz3zdQ

We were pleasantly surprised that they were offering both a breakfast and lunch menu. We took advantage of it by each of us ordering a breakfast and a lunch entr√©e. 

I got the kicking' chicken, which was diced chicken on a hoagie roll topped with lettuce and tomatoes, completed with a tangy bbq sauce that made the sandwich all the more exquisite. It was my first time trying out their lunch menu and it impressed me enough that I would happily try another lunch entree again. 

My boyfriend had his usual bueno beni which consists of a bagel, sausage patty, basted egg, fresh jalape√±os, and a sauce of verde hollandaise that is out of this world!

If you're ever in the SE, this is a must try. Prices are fair and service is solid. There is a morning rush so be prepared to maybe wait 5-10 minutes especially on weekends. Place has a good casual, laid-back atmosphere.

One of the first few things I noticed in the restaurant were the baseball bobble heads in a case to the left when you walk in and then lots of positive quotes throughout the walls. Not everything matched and some of the baseball players were not that good, but it added character to the place. The menu was pretty big. Lots of variety in the breakfast area. I opted for the Leo, which was a salmon, egg scramble on a poppyseed Kaiser roll with cream cheese. Came with potato hash too. Big portions and prompt service. The cook even came out to check on a substitution, which was nice. A lot of the waiters seem to remember the names of regulars so I'm taking that as a good thing. The hash had a yellow seasoning in it, but I couldn't make out what it was, maybe turmeric or mustard powder? It was ok, but I could do without the seasoning.

It's located inside the same plaza as the Starbucks and Yogurtland and LVAC. On Sunday mornings, parking can be VERY tedious, but if you're lucky enough to find some close to the restaurant, generally you wait around 10 minutes (if you're lucky) on a Sunday morning to get some eggs! However, I can honestly say that I've waited 20 minutes before but they usually surpass the time they give and deliver even earlier.

This place knows how to make a good eggs Benedict. I love my eggs Benny's, and Sunrise Cafe does a great job of satisfying my craving whenever I want one. 

The service is really friendly and you can see how they all walk with a pep in their step! Great to see the staff work hard and it definitely shows.",HffJGgXdf82JYMfh0glhUA,0,0,4,2fHFt0M91dnjkyOxwOlq7Q

The host at the front was friendly. After being sat though, the server was informal, decent, and eh. I understand that during a breakfast rush, servers want to get you in and out, but she was the definition of average. Was she rude? No. Friendly? No. She was ok.

We ordered those powdered bagel bites. My significant other got the eggs benedict. I got the omelet with bacon, avocado, and pepper jack. Banana and bagel on the side.

She said the eggs benedict was ""ok."" The bagel bites were ok. As far as my food, was it bad? No. Was it out of this world? No. It was ok. A cut up banana on the side... fresh, but nothing done to it is... you guessed it... AVERAGE. Same with a toasted bagel and cream cheese on the side. BASIC.

As I ingested the average plate of food placed in front of me, I glanced at a message written on a small whiteboard across the room. It read...

""My grace is sufficient for you... for my strength is made perfect in weakness"" 2 corinthians 12:9

Not arguing with you there Sunrise! If God wanted you to be average, he's more than happy with you.

Also, Sunrise, don't shoot me a message saying ""We're sorry for the bad experience... blah blah blah..."" 

Did I have a bad experience? No. A great breakfast experience that exceeded expectations? No. I had a cookie cutter, run of the mill, ho hum breakfast. Average. Nothing special. 

This place is not bad or good. It's just decent enough to keep its doors open and making money. And a decade from now, they'll still have their doors open to provide the Vegas eater with the same food, same service, and same AVERAGE experience.",ULJ3IFsyHEPC9GLTxfKofA,1,0,3,aqINdCh6ifABDVWrhYL1wA

Food: ordered the bread pudding pancakes and ""to Brie or not to Brie"".  Many other items looked so tasty on the menu and it was hard to decide.

Bread pudding pancake did not meet the hype, I love bread pudding and this was just pancakes and raisins, but they were redeemed with the amazing Brie, raspberry and orange marmalade dish served warm out of the oven on a split bagel.

Food - Love egg whites for those considering cholesterol!  They offer cottage cheese for those that love lean protein without the fat.  They have all sorts of normal food. You don't have to be on a diet, they just have a lot of health stuff.  Go for any of the breakfasts and not the other stuff.

Service - The service is freakin awesome. I really like them all and they are all consistently top notch.

Price - Very reasonable. Never, ever will I eat at IHOP, or Denny's again. This place is just the right place at the right price.

Location - A bit busy at the 215 and Eastern near the LVAC.

Feeling - Very nice place to eat, very comfortable, outdoor dining. Have dogs?  Bring them!

For a place with many healthy options, this is a behemoth of a breakfast:  eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, canadian bacon, silver dollar pancakes, and a bread (I always choose the everything bagel toasted).  80% of the time I order this, the other 20% I get the crispy creamy wrap, an egg/bacon/cream cheese wrap.  Again served with their potatoes, which are fantastic when ordered extra crispy.  My wife typically gets Chester's Way, their corned beef hash dish.  This is another huge meal, we always take some home even with me helping...

I would arrive earlier in the day if possible, the wait can get long at high peak times on the weekend due to its popularity.  Also, they do run out of bread choices, which we found out the hard way a few times.  During nice weather, sitting outside on the patio can be fun, but it's RIGHT by the parking lot.  So, car noise/exhaust can be an issue. Dogs are welcome on the patio.

Our server was very attentive and offered many refills to Jamie on her coffee. The food came out very quickly. Jamie and I shared our meal. My Lox Platter came with a sesame bagel. It had cream cheese, lots of Lox, tomatoes, onions, and capers. Plus, home style hash browns had onions mixed in, but they lacked seasoning.

Yes, the Sunrise may be a candidate for a one-sentence review, but I will elaborate a little. I have dined here twice. The first time was under serious time constraints, and all I had was a turkey wrap. All I can say is that it was indeed a turkey wrap.

The second time I had a bit more time to peruse the menu and make an informed decision. What surprises me is that it is the type of place where you expect to order whole grain pancakes, but there is a small problem, they don't have whole-wheat pancakes. This is not a darling, hippie, organic, super creative, knockin' my socks off caf√© where you can get a mixed green salad with your sundried tomato pesto egg white omelet and glass of carrot ginger juice. They serve breakfast, sandwiches, wraps and salads, and it is all simply getting the job done for me.

On the repeat visit, I went with the Veggie Benedict with the Hollandaise on the side on top of an everything bagel with a side of potatoes. The veggies included sliced tomatoes, spinach and mushrooms. The Benedict sans sauce definitely tasted good for you. The bagel could have used a little more everything, but it was soft and easy to eat. The potatoes were tasty--definitely not the best for you, as I am pretty sure the tastiness was a result of butter. I would eat it again if I were in the area and needed a breakfasty bite, but I would not drive there just to eat it.

Visited here today for breakfast and I decided to try something new.  I voted for the Potato Chip Nachos but I wished I hadn't.  Everything on top was really good, but the chips themselves were Ruffles (exact brand unknown), but you know what kind of chips they are right?  I thought they would be some house-made chips capable of carrying the toppings, but I only found 3 viable chips, all the rest were sogged out and had to be forked.  Big disappointment, but my bagel was great and so was my coffee.  No change in stars as it's the only thing I haven't thoroughly enjoyed in my 3 visits.

Original Post:

Our local friends highly recommended this place and it did not disappoint.  Slight wait at 11:30 on a Saturday which was surprisingly shorter than we expected.  Great patio area where many had their dogs with them.  We were seated at the counter which we never prefer but we're starving and so we took it (they did ask us when we put our name in if the counter was ok).  It was a bit noisy at the counter but not terrible. I mention this only if you are going to have a catch-up conversation with an old friend vs just catching a bite.  The entire staff seemed to be having a blast at work and were great.  My hubby got the philly and was in love from the first bite.  I had the corned beef hash and it was very good and huge.

In less than 10 monitors our meal was served!  WOW! That's fast!

So so good!  I think I would come back and order a plate of potatoes and that's is, they are that good!  I did order the build your own omelet and it was just ok. Nothing special but nothing wrong with it either.  I liked that you could have avocado at no extra cost but I didn't like that they were not very generous with the serving.  Personal opinion maybe.  Cesar Q isn't a breakfast guy so he tried their lunch and said he liked it.

First,  Michael is a great server.   Filed with wonderful suggestions and really attentive in a busy restaurant.   

I'm cheap so the prices were a little high at first.   But the portion sizes, flavor, and atmosphere really make up for it.   

We had the LEO sandwich,  a banana pancakes,  a bagel and the snow caps for breakfast.   Everything was delicious! 

For lunch we had the kids pizza,  Cajun Benedict,  hamtastic sandwich,  the French dip with prime rib, and the pumpkin cream cheese cake.   Again a home run.   We prefer the mac salad to the potato salad but both are yummy.   The French dip is a little salty with the aus jus but most and flavorful without.  The pesto on the ham sandwich took it over the top yummy!   And the kids scarfs down the dessert.

I ordered the crunch berry French toast and he confirmed that it was an awesome choice. That only added to my excitement. I also ordered a side of sausage and a coffee. 

First off the serving of French toast was huge. Not obscene like some places but very large. The crunch berries were pulverized into an almost dust like coating that the slices had been dipped into. Giving it delicious flavor but not adding a whole lot of  crunchy texture like I was expecting. However, it worked really well and had tons of berry flavor. There was also berry syrup and cream cheese icing drizzled on top. It was sweet but enjoyably so. I loved it. 

My side of sausage was two large very thin patties that I could not finish. They were huge ! Overall my grand total with the coffee was $16.

You'll be sure to be searching for a parking spot and be waiting to be seated if you come later in the morning as this place is family friendly, beefcake friendly from LVAC next door, and dog friendly.

Their menu has been exactly the same as far as I can remember but is consistently executed well. They have a create your own omelette section to accompany your standard breakfast options. There are some creative French toast selections and benedicts served on bagels. If you're leaning toward something on the sweet side, I would recommend one of the French toasts. On our most recent visit, I went with the Crunchberry French toast which definitely brought back some childhood memories, with actual crushed Crunchberries. My wife created her own omelette which included her choice of three items which were spinach, bacon, and mushrooms served with potatoes

The hosts are efficient at seating the tables and the servers handle the volume quite well, but are sure to have occasional absences because of the number of tables they are covering. We've never had an issue with the kitchen as they handle the number of orders well also.

OK so I have to preface my review with the fact that during my visit, I was pretty much KO'ed on the table.. Despite this, the server was super friendly and didn't seem to mind one bit - talk about #nojudgy.  Oh and I would also like to add that I didn't end up eating most of my food until after leaving the restaurant, after I had re-established my livelihood, but this doesn't really make all that much of a difference.

The prices are pretty standard for breakfast foods, about $7-10 per plate.  However, the coffee price was kind of steep at $2.45.  Not the biggest deal in the world except for the fact that I could only get down like half my cup, but I guess that was my fault, not theirs.  It was strange, though, that they only sell bottled juices, which are standard breakfast fare; you'd think they would at least have a juice machine of some sort.

The food was super fresh and they're actually one of the only places ever that has made my eggs perfect over medium, my favorite.  I did find the sausage pretty salty, not to mention they come patty style versus in links, which I prefer.  I like that they give you the option between a banana and hash browns as a side, but we actually ordered both.

Eggs Benedicts are served on a bagel. I did Not like this at all. The bagel was cooked/toasted too much and it was so hard to cut into and chew. I think I was given a steak knife with my breakfast and I definitely needed it to saw my way through that bagel. One of my favorite parts about eggs Benedict is how the yolk just oozes into the English muffin underneath and soaks it through (#yolkporn) - this did not happen with the bagel eggs Benedict. 

Anyways, nothing stood out to me. Our service was fine, nothing spectacular either. waiter was super busy with all his other tables, so he was rushed whenever he came by our table.

We arrived with a party of 5 on a Sunday morning around 10 am. There was about a 10-15 minutes wait but we got in fast. They offer us some sample of their blueberry muffin, which was super moist, while we waited. 

On the menu:
They have morning creations, french toast, and pancakes, wraps, sunrise benedicts, create your own omelet, regular omelets, salads, create your own salad, sunrise burgers, sunrise specialty sandwiches and sunrise lunch wraps. Pretty good selection for everyone. 

I have been eyeing all the pictures for a long time and I knew what I wanted before I even got here. I wanted the sunrise benedicts. These benedicts are served not with an English muffin, these babies were served with a bagel. YUM. I love bagels. I ended up getting the bueno beni. The bueno beni is an open-faced bagel with jalapenos, onions, sausage patties, cheese, perfectly cooked eggs with the yolk running with salsa verde hollandaise sauce. This was soo good. My friend got the fiesta benedict and the sauce was delish. You are able to choose what type of bagel you wanted and of course, I went with an everything bagel. MMMMM..soo good! 

Service was top notch. Everything was super nice and everyone was really welcoming.

The restaurant is a decent size too, with outdoor seating as well.  My friends decided to wait for me to order, and my heart sunk.

I was wrong!  Our waiter was so attentive, came over as soon as I arrived, and we were eating about 12-15 minutes later.  I ordered an omelette on the recommendation of my friend who had been there before, but was very weary, as I usually hate egg white omelettes due to lack of flavor.  Again, I was wrong!

My husband and I generally split the Jacob's slammin platter which is an array of pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, breakfast potatoes, and a bagel. More than enough food for the two of us. This place is a bit pricey, but again not so bad if you are splitting. I have also tried the banana cream pancakes and I could eat a vat of the delicious dulce de leche butter. I am also a huge fan of the chicken chipotle wrap, the homemade chipotle ranch is awesome! Their sandwiches are just as good as their breakfast, but there is nothing special about the macaroni or potato salad. I am addicted to french fries and I am always a little disappointed when restaurants don't have a fryer. I wish that they would offer their breakfast potatoes as a side, which they do for an additional fee.

Sometimes  certain things are little high priced, but the restaurant is great. I love the inside and the wall of soda pop, very original stuff I don't see often.

One of my favorite things there is the Brooklyn Benedict, Its soooo good!
Also I like the breakfast Krispy cream wrap. Very delicious, it has grilled onions and cream cheese in it. The Fiesta Benedict is REALLY good! Jalape√±o bacon is the bomb!

One time I got crunch berry toast, wasn't too impressed. Also I feel that the regular french toast and sides of pancakes are a little on the higher price sides. Wish they had a smaller order.
 
They have a great cheese burger salad. I know that sounds nuts but you MUST try it!

This lovely gem is everything you're looking for in a restaurant that caters to the early risers who are looking for a great breakfast.

Everyone that works here from the bus boy to the owner genuinely cares that you have a great breakfast/lunch. I've actually never been here for lunch, but I wouldn't doubt it's just as good as their breakfast. 

Their extensive menu offers everything from the classic eggs and bacon breakfast to breakfast wraps and omelettes. All orders also come with your choice of toast or a bagel.

Cajun Prime Rib Bene...WOW!  The hearty, spicy and savory meat is brilliantly contrasted with a thick and rich house version of hollandaise on a soft steak sandwich roll.  Wow, a fabulous breakfast entree!  

On the sweeter side there is a good variety of pancakes, french toast concoctions, etc.  Sweet breakfast foods are not my preference; however, the other guests in my party were delighted with their confectionery breakfast entrees.  

Reminds me slightly of a New York Diner but has a California breakfast atmosphere...if that makes any sense at all.

The next day we joined another couple at another cafe, which also had good food, but not as good or priced as good. We'll gladly go back here.",UxFbZMZNied2Zy-Mx9yK2A,0,0,5,VKwtnkydpGlivQJS2AOJpg

It is quite busy all the time, so be prepared to wait at least 5 minutes for a table and up to 15 during peak times (most of the time during weekends). However, once you're seated you won't regret it as the servers are always attentive, your drinks will always be full and the fresh squeezed orange juice is one of the most delicious things on the menu! In addition, the omelettes (my favorite) are always made with the freshest ingredients and cooked to perfection. 

All in all, In the many years we've been coming here everything has always been good and consistent, which is why we continue to choose Sunrise regardless of what trendy spot opens. If you want healthy options, friendly smiles and a homey atmosphere regardless of how crowded it is, this is the place to be.",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,2,1,4,iawZX7C9m8Yyb47gDSlFLA

Too bad it was because people were waiting so long to get their meal. Our waiter was so rude and unprofessional...that began a bad experience, but I brushed it off since I was excited about the food. I ordered the Ultimate French toast, which is dipped in toffee batter and also ordered the banana cream pancakes. After waiting an entire hour and 2 1/2 cups of coffee later, we finally got our meal. The looks of it made me think it was a mistake.. But our waiter confirmed those were what we ordered. Excited to try the toffee French toast was shear disappointment. It tasted like any other French toast. The banana creme pancakes were much better tasting than the French toast but still there was nothing banana cream about them. Just regular pancakes with some bananas cooked into them...not worth the 35 bucks I paid.

Because our waiter was rude, the wait was forever and the food was nothing special (sounds so tasty on the menu) I will not be returning here again :(",r1wMOeZDrBz2kn6Ij1MAow,1,1,2,wGx0xUFjYzWXhQV3-nA_DA
