Too much flour and was chewy. A colleague mentioned that he had a burger which costs $20 of which he took a bite and left everything behind coz it was overly dry. Another colleague had a $25 salad which was similarly disappointing as well. 
I'm sorry, my apple danish was enough to leave me with little or no desire to return to try anything else and since many others described their disappointment of lunch and dinner items!",Ud6j2HN40qEhycq2PuwcBA,0,0,1,h4EuaOWtO3fU0MMr0lANtA

French Toast - OK, nothing special. 6 slices per serving. Way too much for me, but there's not really a lot of tasty option for someone who prefers a smaller portion breakfast.

They must've pre-made their oatmeal or something, because they can't accommodate a request for oatmeal that isn't cooked with milk. So BF had to settle for the 'Bagel with Cream Cheese' sans cheese. Bagel came, and waiter handed us cream cheese. Brilliant. We told him he can't have dairy, and waiter gave him cheese, so we had to specifically ask for jam. At least the cheese wasn't already spread on the bagel. 

Hot chocolate - way too watery. It's a big mug, but what good is a big mug of bad hot choco?

Waiter was never to be seen again until we were ready for the check.

Honestly, I can have better food and more attentive service at a cheapo chain diner (IHOP, Denny's take your pick) for half the price (or less). So yeah, this place is not worth going for, at least if you're looking for breakfast.",6A-ZTcSEe6Zh005zWs38Zg,0,0,1,9v8g2oUPNeOKfRhcGjPx4w

The food server ended up not charging me for the meal but that was after I made it VERY clear that 1) I didn't blame her for the crap food and 2) a friend made a comment that it was still on the bill!

Nice, clean place.  We were seated quickly by a very friendly hostess.  Our server was helpful, quick and accurate.  One thing I really loved was the butcher-paper type tablecloth that was replaced between diners.  I'm a little freaky about germs, so this helped me relax.  

There was a lot of variety on the menu and prices were quite reasonable.  I had a lovely croissant breakfast sandwich which was delicious and presented beautifully with fresh berries.  Big Jeff, in his endless quest for every city's perfect Reuben, of course went with that.  To my surprise, he claimed this was the best LV has to offer in the Reuben department.    This after YEARS of eating Reubens from one end of Las Vegas to the other.  Weird.  But you other Reuben-o-philes can do with that information whatever you like!

The waitress sat us promptly, and had our first drinks back to us in fairly short order. That is the last good part of the review. After taking our orders, she seemed to forget we were there, not checking on us after our food was delivered, would walk the other way when we made it clear we wanted assistance or refills. It wasn't until my boyfriend placed his empty glass over our heads on the partition next to us before refills were brought. Funnily enough, she managed to deliver the check on the spot wordlessly when we asked for it though. The chicken salad sandwich was bland, piled high with so many toppings I could barely fit it in my mouth. After adding salt and pepper, it still remained awful, especially when I started biting into small chunks of raw garlic and onion. I could have gone to the nearest 7-Eleven and had a chicken salad sandwich that had been sitting there all day that was better than this one. My boyfriend had a Chicken Caesar Salad-something that's pretty hard to mess up, as it is a staple on most menues. The chicken was almost completely flavorless, and rather dry, the salad was mixed crispy and crunchy greens and yesterday's limpy greens, and the dressing tasted like pure mayonnaise. The most flavor in that dish was the oversized croutons, so I'm guessing they didn't bake the bread themselves, because that actually had flavor. Casino prices are normally higher that anywhere else, but these were absurd. Avoid this place if you can.

We settled for this place since it looked decent and guess what it tasted okay too.  I got the spaghetti and meatballs for the kids, the fettuccine for myself, chicken for my parents and my honey got the steak plate.

Wow, it was $18 for the spaghetti plate, they give you 3 huge meatballs, but it was not even tasty.  It was bland and I can make better spaghetti then that out of bought can from Safeway or something.

My fettuccine plate was okay too, I was hoping that the sauce would be a kick butt sauce, again I was disappointed.  The only memorable part of my dish was the huge shrimp that comes with it.

I didn't get a chance to try my parent's chicken, so I couldn't really say how it tasted.

I'd have to say, my honey's steak was pretty good.  But shit, you can't really screw up on steak if you ask for it medium rare!

Price wise, it's way too expensive for the non-tasty American food.  If you can venture out farther, you're better off eating somewhere else.

This place also has a bakery, you can get juice, pastries & Krispy Kreme donuts here too for a quick continental breakfast on the go.  The pastries are pretty tasty.  The croissants are so soft and flaky, it just crumbles and melts in your mouth when you bite into it.

I haven't tried the cakes, but next time when I'm there in Vegas again & have a sweet tooth, i'll definitely have to try one of their tasty looking desserts ;p

It took us more than 10 minutes and multiple requests to the hostess, bussers and other service to get the waitress to come by.  We asked for the switch and were told she had to see how far along the meal was.  Ridiculous.  It's pretty easy to switch macaroni salad to onion rings at any stage of preparation.  The food took a little while to arrive and when it did, they had not switched the side.  This took another 10 minutes or so to accomplish, causing the food to get cold.  Meanwhile, I asked for a side of ranch dressing and mustard, which also took multiple requests and about 15 minutes, so my food got cold too.  My water glass became empty as I ate and was not refilled until long after I was finished, even though I specifically asked a server for more water.

1174329,2009-12-22,3,W-YhRJOSezqESSas-oLArw,"We stayed at theHotel this time around in Vegas.  Even though we had ordered room service for a late-night dinner using our $100 room credit, we still found ourselves hungry when it was time to check out.  Most of the eateries in Mandalay Bay were still closed, so we weren't very picky.  Seeing that Red, White, and Blue was open - it was our final destination for food before heading out.  

There was four of us, and they seated us at a very comfortable spacious booth that I dare say was probably the best seat in the place.  Thumbs up! Our party of four soon became a party of six and then a party of nine!  Our server was super patient, nice, and accommodating!  

The food here was decent.  The BF had the Ultimate Breakfast which included NY steak, 3 eggs, bacon, toast, hash browns, and fruit.  I had the French Toast with their vanilla creamy yumminess.  Their vanilla cream was so sweet and delicious that I would substitute it for maple syrup anyday!  It suited my French Toast perfectly!  I added their berries (extra $4), but was disappointed to see that the berries were not fresh.  My friends had their clam chowder in a bread bowl, fried chicken, buffalo wings, Denver omelet, and a couple also had the Ultimate Breakfast.  Overall, I think that my French Toast was the best thing on our table, and I would recommend it over everything else that I've listed!  Shhhh! =D  The food was definitely better than what I had anticipated. 

My biggest boos about this place are the price and the wait.  It was quite pricey for decent typical ""American"" food.  The wait between the time that we ordered and when the food came out was unacceptable when some of my friends wanted to put their heads down from the hunger of the wait.

1184796,2009-02-16,2,W-YhRJOSezqESSas-oLArw,"Came here for lunch with my old buddy Adrienne.  We were at a physical therapy convention in Mandalay Bay and only had an hour before our next talk so this was the most reasonably priced place we could find in the vicinity without resorting to the Pizza Hut at Excalibur.  Still, a turkey sandwich here was 14 bucks.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  What happened to the Vegas of yore, where prime rib dinners were 5 dollars and shrimp cocktail was 99 cents??  14 bucks is OUTRAGEOUS!  

I like to think of myself as a man of relatively high morals.  I try to help out those in need, and believe in the virtues of honesty and self control.  Thus it goes without saying that paying 14 dollars for a turkey sandwich goes against every moral fiber in my body.  Thus I opted for the shrimp gumbo.  

It turned out to be a good choice.  At 9 dollars, this was a good portion for lunch (although it was actually an appetizer) and it was hot and tasty.  It was served with a scoop of rice pilaf in the middle and surprisingly that meal held me over for the rest of the day.  It had a nice kick to it too.  They didn't hold back on the cayenne I believe.  

So the food here is not bad.  In fact I'd say based on the soup and from looking around at other meals, the food is pretty good.  But it's still immoral, and morality trumps taste any day.  Plus they have no beers on tap.  SERIOUSLY??",2--3--v8yHU3a3FljCcBRg,2,2,3,W6SAbpwEZ9L62ENpIPXy9g

Been here twice in the last 2 weeks, won't be going back.  I only went the second time because my gf's parents were in town and I got them a room at Mandalay so it was convenient, won't make that mistake again.

First off the service is horrible!!! We eat out a lot, it's usually comped and we leave 20-25% tip. 

How long should it take to get 3 coffees and a virgin bloody mary delivered to the table at 11am on a monday when the restaurant is practically empty?? Apparently here it takes 15 minutes. As I got up to go speak with the manager the waitress comes back and says "" Did you think I got lost, I got stuck in the bar"". Great, what the fuck does that mean, about time you brought my coffee. Now it's gonna take another 5-10 minutes for her to bring the whole milk to go in my coffee that I requested when she took the order.

I was so put off by the waitress and anticipating that it would take 45 mins to get my food that I didn't even order any. 

Last time we were here the couple across from us said they were disgusted with the place and just got up and left. The mgr asked us where they went, I told him they said your service sucks and they got tired of waiting for someone to take their drink order. He said ""we went out of our way to accomodate them"", yeah sure ok buddy.


The prices here are high and I use comps to pay and they're still overpriced!

Just for the service alone I won't go back. I like great service, this place does not have even ok service.

First, we tried to order room service, but when we were told it would take over an hour to get a plate of overpriced corned beef hash, we decided it might be a good idea to venture outside of the room. We sucked it up and stumbled down to the elevator. Luckily, we had no idea where to go and ended up here out of convenient location. My boyfriend got his hash, but I changed my mind and went for a burger. His hash was good, but I was way too into my burger to delve deeper into an analysis of it. That burger! It was perfectly done (medium) and the flavor of it actually came through! It wasn't just a patty, but something with flavor and actually tasted good. I'm really hoping it wasn't the hangover talking, but I'd say this is one of the best burgers I've had. In my top 5, for sure.

The only problem we had was a mix up with beverages and I ended up with some tantalizing coffee in front of me instead of just water. (I can't drink coffee for fear of a caffeine/nervous breakdown. Unfortunately, my caffeine tolerance is incredibly low.) But, it was quickly resolved and I got a soda to quench my sugar thirst. (Pepsi, not Coke.

So we went up to the hostess and asked if we could eat a complete dinner in a hour they said yes. So we went for it. Overall time spent in the restaurant was 48 minutes. Which is pretty good for an upscale kinda restaurant.
Basically nothing to write home about. I had a wedge salad and a small steak.   Kinda expensive. The food was way too salty. I love salt but damn it was bad! I couldn't imagine an old person eating the dinner i had. I think their heart would stop.

The menu isn't super extensive, but I did see a few breakfast items that sounded really appetizing. I ended up choosing the french toast with vanilla anglaise and he got some ultimate breakfast plate with steak, eggs, toast, and potatoes.

I really liked my french toast! It was nice and egg-y, and with the vanilla anglaise and a little butter, it was a really delicious breakfast item. The vanilla anglaise tasted a lot like vanilla ice cream, but not too sweet, so it was perfect for my tastebuds. I also got to eat the eggs with Wilmar's plate, which he got poached. They were pretty yummy and nicely cooked. My only complaint would be that they were a little bit vinegar-y, which I know is something people use to poach eggs nicely, but still, I would have liked it more without that taste.

1677415,2011-02-05,9,W-YhRJOSezqESSas-oLArw,"Red, White & Blue Restaurant is a lunch and dinner sit-down restaurant in the Mandalay Bay (next to Fleur by Hubert Keller).  The restaurant feels like a more contemporary version of a traditional American restaurant.  The restaurant's straightforward and kind of old-school decor (as well as the loud atmosphere) reminds me of a Daily Grill.

The restaurant (at least for lunch) features mainly classic dishes like buffalo wings, Reuben sandwich, pastrami sandwich, spaghetti and meatballs, tuna salad sandwich, and so on.  The menu and the prices felt similar to a lot of the 24 hour Vegas cafes though I found my experience at Red, White & Blue a little better.

I had the seared ahi tuna, which was served with wasabi mashed potatoes and a citrus sauce, but I opted for the green beans instead of the potatoes.  The ahi tuna was decent.  It was served rare and was pretty fresh.  The citrus sauce was flavorful and light.

The green beans were cooked properly.  Nice crispness to them and also fresh.  There were also some pickled onions and asparagus on the plate and both were fine and added flavor.

My friend's lobster cobb salad was huge and it did not look that great.  I don't think she was that impressed with it.

Both dishes came with pretty generous portions.

Service was good.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.

Like other Vegas restaurants, this place was overpriced.  Sandwiches were in the $13-$17 range while entrees were in the mid-$20s.  I've definitely had better food at the same prices, but I've also definitely had worse food in Vegas at those prices.

There are plenty of mid-range priced restaurants available at Mandalay Bay (like Burger Bar, which is okay, and Border Grill--I haven't been there).  Because of that, you may be able to find a better meal at the same price around here.  Still, Red, White & Blue was better than I expected and I wouldn't swear off coming here again under the right circumstances.

We were all pretty hungry and so we decided to grab some grub before we started partying. Red, White, and Blue is the first restaurant you see when you enter the Mandalay Bay. The restaurant looked decent and the menu looked eye-pleasing. Let me tell you, this place did not satisfy our cravings at all.

Let's Start...
My friends and I were waiting to be seated. We were informed by the hostess that it would be 10-15 minutes. I did not understand why it would be 10-15 minutes when I can see vacant seats everywhere. The hostess did not seem to acknowledge us at all and I was not pleased with her.

At any rate, we finally got seated and we looked over the menu. By this time, I have lost my appetite so I just ordered the french onion soup. I ordered it brown on top like I always do. When it finally came, my onion soup arrived luke warm and I was disgusted by the cheese that came with it. The cheese was like a big brick of melted cheese that was sitting on top of my bowl. The top was brown but as I dug my spoon into the soup, there was barely any broth because the cheese soaked it up. The bottom of the ""brick"" of cheese was not in solid form and it looked like brains. The waitress saw that I looked unsatisfied and so she asked what was wrong. She was very compliant and she let me substitute it for something else. I decided to get the chicken soup and it tasted like Campbell's. For the prices they charge, you would think it would taste great.

Concluding, I will not be coming here ever again. If the soup is bad, why would I try anything else? The only thing I have to say about this place is that the service is good. The food? I just threw up a little.",fncMFADHtmr_y_xPBlFWqA,1,1,2,rzIWEvkZNx-0JlGbsy3jlg

I suggested this place because a coworker had told me the food was good and the sandwiches were HUGE.

We waited in line at the host stand for about 10 minutes before being seated at a table right in front of the kitchen entrance/exit (saw the Chef picking on fries and such).  Our server was ok.  She  couldn't recommend anything because she was a vegetarian and told us that she hadn't tried anything on the menu other than the french fries.

I ordered a Mock-ito, which tasted like they had thrown a couple of mint leaves and limes into a glass of sprite...

I also ordered a Pastrami Reuben with Coleslaw.  It was good, but the bottom half of my sandwich was a bit soggy from sitting next to the coleslaw and my pickle spear was a little warm, which means my food was probably sitting under the heating lamps for a bit (our food did take a little long to come out). It was filling, but not HUGE like my coworker had described it.  My reuben was lacking in the sauerkraut department and the russian dressing was non-existent.  

My boyfriend had a burger, medium-rare (which was actually cooked correctly) and we shared a side of chili fries, which were good but missing something (which we decided was some diced onion and a bit of sour cream.

I was never offered a refill or another glass. My boyfriend's iced tea glass was refilled once.  Our server checked on us once.  We waited 10 minutes after the end of our meal before having to flag down our server (who was busy closing out...i think.  It looked like the restaurant was going through a shift change) to bring us our check and then we had to flag someone else down to pick up our check. And no one offered us dessert... wtf?

Bottom Line:
The food was just alright.  Service was just alright. I don't think I'd come back and wait in line to be seated. If there is a next time...

It wasn't late in the day or anything. we went there for lunch and she was very short with us and was very annoyed when we asked any questions at all such as what was our choices in sides, or other typical questions.

I ordered the shrimp scampi and garlic toast, my boyfriend got the chicken. The portions were big, i was stuffed and from what I remember the shrimp scampi was really good, a little buttery though. The garlic toast was great, just perfect. Definitely something to try. My boyfriend's chicken was small though. He was pretty disappointed with the portions and it definitely wasn't worth the price. But the taste was decent, nothing to brag about though. At the end of the night, he wished he ordered the burger instead.

I came to this restaurant a couple of years ago and had one of the best Rueben sandwiches in my life.  This time, I ordered something very similiar, the Donny Richman which is a corned beef, pastrami, and swiss on rye.  Each meat was in its own heaping layer and the rye was well toasted but maybe my expectations were too great after remembering what a terrific Rueben I had the first time.

I substituted onion rings and I could have sworn that I asked for ""frings"" which I thought was a combo of french fries and onion rings... maybe the waitress misheard me.  Come to think of it, our dining experience was mitigated by the mediocre service that I felt that we received.  Sure she took our order and brought us our food but that's it... no more, no less.  This is the kind of service I would expect at a Denny's late at night but not at 200pm on a Sunday afternoon.  My wife even saw the waitress counting her tip money later on towards the back, probably before she was scheduled to take a break.

My wife ordered the House Made Corned Beef Hash and said that it was just ok...  the poached egg was overcooked.  We also ordered $5 mimosas and it tasted like it...  it wasn't very good... the champange (sparkling wine) tasted like it was left over and flat, there wasn't very much pop to it.

Value wise this place is kind of expensive and leave you wondering whether or not it was worth it.  Our tab was $46.48 before gratuity for what amounted to breakfast and a sandwich.

We wanted to just stay on the resort our first night and wanted a low key and less expensive casual dinner.  Dining at this restaurant was fairly low key, not loud and crazy and if you like people watiching you can sit in their terrace seating which is out on the Mandalay Bay thoroughfare.  Here are my thoughts:

Atmosphere - B
Not swank but better than most chain restaurants.  Fairly intimate seating allowed us to focus on ourselves and not all of the patrons.

Service - C
The server was attentive enough but honestly was acting in his attitude and demeanor that being there was the last place on earth he wanted to be.  No smile, no personality, but he was on top of things however he probably could have chilled out on the upselling a bit.

Food - C
We each had burgers, I had the swiss & onion (swiss cheese/grilled onions) and wifey had the shrooms & blue (mushrooms/bleu cheese)...I will say this the burgers were better than most burgers you would get at a chain restaurant, they claim that they use grain fed, no hormone, angus beef and I believe them.  The meat was tasty.  Burger came with fries that were very ordinary and probably a little stale, that was dissapointing. Overall slightly less than what I would expect for a $17 burger even if in Vegas.

For desert we got the krispy kreme doughnut sundae and it was the low light of the meal, I do not recommend it.  A super stale krispy kreme doughnut smothered in cheap soft serve with gobs of whip cream and some tasteless sprinkes.  Cheap at $6 but not worth it.

Drinks were $3.50 for soda which is still a tad pricey flat soda.

I told him that we needed a few more minutes and to please come back.  When he came back we still hadn't decided and I could tell that he wasn't happy about having to wait for us.

Everything was top notch with the exception for our one visit to Red, White and Blue for breakfast one morning.   This is in contrast to breakfast we had the day before at the House of Blues (reviewed separately).

We were seated right away (@9am weekday) but it took well over 15 minutes before we ordered.  The breakfast menu is very limited and very boring.  Nothing special except for the prices, which weren't special in a good way.   The room service breakfast menu had more choices (I checked when I got back to our room).

I ordered the pancakes with apple cinnamon compote, my son's ordered the breakfast sampler (eggs, meat, potato's, toast) and blueberry crepes because they ran out of Belgian waffles.  How does one run out of waffles, unless they're are pre-made and probably frozen?!  Most Residence Inn's I stay at have waffle makers that turn out great Belgian waffles, so I couldn't understand this, and it was only 9:30am (by the time we ordered).  My wife just ordered a bagel since nothing really interested her.

The apple cinnamon compote with  my pancakes turned out to be basic applesauce from a jar (judging by the look, texture and taste).   One of the pancakes (out of three) was a bit burnt on one side (the bottom one of course facing down).  I didn't feel like returning it risking anything ""special"" let alone waiting who knows how long.  Other than that, the pancakes were fine as pancakes go.

The crepe's were okay, again, nothing special.  We had much better crepes at the Paris Le Buffet.  The breakfast sampler was the best of the bunch, but that's not saying much.  The scrambled eggs were done well, however. 

The service for the most part was slow.  Slow to get our orders, slow to arrive and slow for the check.  However our server did refill my coffee almost as soon as I finished my cup which for me, deserves a star by itself , hence two instead of one.  

Needless to say, Red, White and Blue is not recommended for breakfast.  I can't speak to the other menus, but there are far better choices within the Mandalay Bay.",2BLgaHhoHAIizZecfYiZ9g,0,0,2,cuR5re8DvRFCuOpSOXEwRQ

The meat was so tender you can shred it with your fork, no need for a knife. They caramelized onions, shallots in a sweet sauce and it was resting on a bed of mash potatoes. Now it's very savory and sweet. I would suggest asking them to put some of that sauce on the side instead of smothered onto the plate but either way it was a great dish. 

Oysters: OK y'all, if you want oysters, go to Harrahs Oyster Bar. The oysters weren't worth the price. They were flavorless..almost as though they ran the oyster in water after opening them up. It was weird.... Being an oyster lover I would had loved it to have a bit of ""oyster"" taste. Just don't order it. Not worth $26 dollars for a dozen. 

BAR: The bartender was awesome. Now if you want a great Bloody Mary they have a great Bloody Mary. Now I didn't have alcohol in mine because I'm allergic. I drank their homemade mix and it was off the hook. I love tomato juice! OK before you go chopping my head off for having a virgin Bloody Mary, my friend loves Bloody Mary and he said it was good. They don't use the usual worcheser sauce, they put in A1 and some spices. It was delicious! The bartender was very knowledgeable on tequila flavors and also made some oysters shooters on the house for us. He was awesome! 

Come here if you want a great Togo dinner up in your room or by the pool. Great MEAT selection. Stay away from oysters. Bon apetite.",pVU2DdtBFppBAX5G5t3rcw,0,0,3,rN4dEq4rUYfgiWEiy0fj0Q

3746260,2008-12-30,2,W-YhRJOSezqESSas-oLArw,"*Review for restaurant, NOT ""On-the-Go"" bakery/deli.

Why all the negative reviews??!  How anyone cannot love this place, I am truly flabbergasted.  This is hands down now my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  My family had a choice of eating at any Mandalay Bay restaurant complimentary of the casino and since we didn't want to go back to Raffles (read review), we chose Red, White and Blue Restaurant.  The ""On-the-Go"" is right next to it, and even though it was awhile ago, I remember the sandwiches from that part of the restaurant weren't that great.  We were seated immediately and our server was really friendly and accommodating.

Everything on the menu looked very enticing, so we just ordered whatever the hell we wanted since it was free.  We ordered and shared: a large Caesar salad, Fried Calamari, the Main Lobster, BBQ Baby Back Ribs, a Turkey sandwich, and the Mushroom/Chicken Penne, with a side order of Garlic Toast; then a Banana Split for dessert (check out the photos I submitted).

CAESAR SALAD:  You can't really mess up so we weren't expecting much, since we were starving.  We were pleasantly surprised when it was absolutely delicious, since they had their own type of Caesar dressing.  I can't explain it, but it was so good!

FRIED CALAMARI:  I don't like squid, but this was simply amazing!  It was very crunchy (on the outside) and chewy, with lots of flavor.

**MAIN LOBSTER**:  This was seriously THE BEST DISH in the house.  My mother was skeptical on ordering this since she was afraid their seafood might not be fresh, but she saw someone order it, so she did as well.  I'm not a very big seafood person and normally don't eat lobster, but I absolutely loved it.  The lobster was so fresh, tasty, with the right amount of chewiness.  The Baked Potato that came along with it was also huge!

BBQ BABY BACK RIBS:  These were good, but the lobster was better :)

TURKEY SANDWICH:  My sister ordered this and I only had one bite.  It's a cold sandwich, which I wasn't really feeling - but it was average tasting.

MUSHROOM/CHICKEN PENNE:  Tasty and flavorful pasta with big chunks of chicken, but again, the lobster was better!

GARLIC TOAST:  The first batch of Garlic Toast we received was actually burnt really badly.  We told our server and he immediately took it back in and gave us a new batch which was baked beautifully golden, and really tasty.

BANANA SPLIT:  By this time, our server is like ""Whaaaaat?  This family can eat!""  The banana split is served with soft-serve ice cream and you seriously cannot fail.  The banana was fresh, so it was pretty good.  The only thing that was sort of iffy was the strawberry syrup - it tasted sort of bitter to me.

After all this, we noticed that some tables had a basket of bread.  We weren't served bread, so I asked my waiter if there was complimentary bread.  I'm assuming he's a very quick thinker on his feet 'cause he quickly responded with, ""Yes, it's requested bread"".  For first-timers, how do would they know you have to ""request"" complimentary bread?  We knew he was lying, but liked the fact that he thought of an answer so quickly and smoothly.  But yes, we requested we have bread!  I swear we're not a scarily obese family :)  

Another waitress also slightly bumped into my father as she was walking by, apologized, served her table, and then actually came back to my father and apologized again.  This is what I call great and friendly customer service.  We left our server with an enormous tip and even asked him to thank the chef for us, 'cause in all honestly, the meal was one of the best we ever had in a long time.  It's even better than the Wynn buffet!  You might be thinking, ""Maybe this girl doesn't know what good food is"", but trust.  I know what good food is, with all my mountain-high standards.

Aside from the hostess being very pleasant, I can't say a positive thing about this place.  The server was determined to act as disinterested as possible and the food was equally unimpressive.  

My wife ordered matzoh ball soup which was basically Campbell's basic chicken noodle with a dough ball plopped in the middle.  Okay, so maybe it's best to stick to the traditional American fare at a place called ""Red, White, and Blue"".  Unfortunately that didn't work either as the burger and onion rings I had tasted just as plain as what you'd get from the frozen food aisle of your local grocery store.  Pretty disappointing considering the soup cost $10 and the burger was $16.  

Aside from bringing the food, the server refilled drinks once and then brought us the check.  Didn't ask if we wanted additional drinks, to order dessert, or anything else.  He seemed fairly annoyed at the presence of anyone in his section.  Perhaps it distracted his football-watching on a Sunday afternoon.  The mumbling and avoidance of all eye contact and acknowledgment was a pretty nice bonus too.  I guess there's a first time for everything and this was my first time eating at a full-service restaurant without leaving a tip.

The sauce had that Frank's Red Hot flavor to it but it was spicier and finger licking good. My boyfriend ate a couple and he said they were some of the best wings he had. 
BBQ chicken sandwich is what the waiter recommended and I'm not sure why, it wasn't good. The chicken was dry and the whole thing was just bland. The onion rings that came with the sandwich were the best part about the dish - crispy, big and addicting :)

I'll be honest with you -- the only thing that drove my best friend and me here was the horridly long wait at Burger Bar, with whose outstanding reputation we were impressed long before we arrived in Sin City.  However, the wait was over an hour and we had a Spice Girls concert to catch (reserve commentary please!).

This being the Mandalay of all Bays, we automatically expected the prices to be relatively outlandish.  We considered going to Red Square or other more gimmicky food joints in the vicinity, but after drinking and gambling most of the day all we really needed was filling for our stomachs.  And what outstanding filling RWB turned out to be!

Our servers were extremely kind and generous.  Our waters were refilled to capacity just when they needed to be -- not too much hovering, but not too much waiting either.

I went to Vegas the weekend of Nov 18th (my birthday!) and we stayed at the Mandalay Bay. It was early saturday night and we wanted something to eat before we went out. All I wanted was a deli style sandwhich (which is pretty hard to find). I called the concierge and she mentioned this place. I looked it up online through my phone and said ""why not.""

I walked down to the place and it was packed! There was a line waiting but I walked right in to the ""take-out"" window. I ordered a roast beef sandwich with a side of clam chowder. It was kinda pricey (about $15-20) for a sandwhich, chips, and literally 8-10 fl oz of soup, but whatever, it's Vegas.

So I leave and meet my friends at the Yogurt/Crepe place in Mandalay. Damn how I wish I would have gotten a crepe with them.

I opened my soup container and it literally looked like someone put half water, half olive oil, a tablespoon of alfredo sauce, soggy microscopic pieces of celery, and potato. I don't even remember if there were CLAMS in my CLAM chowder, that's how terrible this thing was! I didn't even know that clam chowder came minestrone style! But apparently here at the Red, White, & Blue, IT DOES!

I chocked down my soup and happily went on to the sandwich. I opened it and the thing looked AMAZING! Exactly what you would expect a roast beef sandwich to look like - the meat looked fresh, the tomatoes were vibrant, and the lettuce was beautiful. I took a bite into it and all I tasted was dry bread and a TERRIBLE wasabi mayonnaise. 

BLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHH!!!
What the h*ll did I get to eat?!?!

First off, how many people like the taste of wasabi on their sushi, much less on a ROAST BEEF SANDWICH?! Why couldn't you have given me NORMAL mayonnaise instead of this crap?!

So, once again, I literally had to CHOKE down half of the sandwich and then I called it a day. I didn't even attempt to eat their nasty looking chips that came with it. To this DAY those chips are still sitting in my pink Vegas Pimp Cup.

DO NOT GO HERE unless you want to feel even more cheated out of your money than you already are in Vegas!!!!

Okay, maybe I'm slightly harsh but this is the first place I've ever ordered a corn beef hash and had to actually add salt to it.. normally I tend to think it could use less salt.  I also like my food a little on the plain side so I never add salt to my food in general, but it was just too plain this time.

It takes about 35 minutes. I waited about 5 minutes in line to give my order to a girl behind the counter....she then scribbles my order down and hands me a receipt and hands another girl a carbon copy of my order. I go to the register to pay about $27 for my turkey sandwich, small Caesar salad and a bottle water. WHOA!!! 

I stand off to the side and watch a girl take my salad from the deli case, put it in a bag then push it to the side. I waited and waited....after about 20 minutes I asked the girl at the register what the hold up was....she turned around and said that the girls had not started making my sandwich yet. WHAT!?? Another girl comes over and asks me what I ordered...I simply said ""Don't you have a carbon copy of my order?"" and she had the nerve to look at me with one eyebrow raised and say ""Obviously I don't...thats why Im asking you"". So I told her my order...again and asked another girl to get a manager. I had to wait for that too! Are you serious?

Then I get attitude handed to me by some girl behind the counter who thought she was just about the cutest and funniest thing to walk the Earth. Yeah...this $27 sandwich better be gold plated! 

To say the least...service sucked...wait time was outrageous and the food was comparable to Subway. 

Here is my theory on customer service so you can better understand why I get so frustrated: 
#1 Your customer should not have to ask for anything. Meaning...always be one step ahead of them. Have some flippin common sense. If you see their drink is empty or on its way...refill it. If you serve them a burger....bring ketchup even if they didnt ask for it. Duh. 
#2 Never act like your customer is an inconvenience. Dude...they are paying for a service!!! They don't have to spend their money in your establishment...they can go somewhere else! Make them happy they chose to come to you. 
#3 Best advertising is word of mouth. You treat your customers well...they will be back and so will their friends. You screw it up...and everyone will know.",x5nXteWvGXT_1-HqJyMIbw,1,1,2,4cKCAHry2j9fCMYETy121A

Nice cool chopped tomatoes and ample chives were available to top these delectable morsels, along with the bacon that was already there.

French Onion Soup came out looking puffy on top with melted cheese, which is a good sign.  It was very comforting and very filling, featuring nice and hot and very cheesy Swiss Cheese, well-caramelized onions, and a well-deconstructed crouton in a white crock.

Red, White & Blue is one of my default spots to go to for breakfast during my work conferences at the Mandalay Bay. It has some pretty decent food for on-the-go or for a quick bite sitting down, but I find it way over priced. On the other hand, what isn't over priced in Vegas?

For my sit down meal I ordered the Honey Baked Ham, Swiss Cheese, and Mushroom Omelette for $14.  I looked at my dish when it came out and it was interesting. I noticed the egg was cooked like a flat tortilla and then all the ingredients were wrapped in it. At times I just found myself eating egg or just the ingredients.  I found this to be a unique way to cook the omelette, but I still prefer all my ingredients to be melded together and infused with the egg. This way it ensures I get an equal distribution of ingredients with each bite. 

All omelettes are served with house potatoes with onions, peppers and herbs, but I'm not a big fan of house potatoes so I asked for a substitution. My server gladly substituted the potatoes for fruit. I ended up with some cantaloupe that was very sweet and juicy.

On-the-go, I tried their Smoked Salmon Platter that comes with a toasted bagel with Atlantic Smoked Salmon, Cream Cheese, Red Onions, and Capers. This was a lot better than their omelette. I remember this being fairly expensive as well, but this dish is about the same price everywhere else in Vegas.
