They are quick, efficient, but no smile at all. I know they are trying to get the service done as soon as possible, but I just had a very bad experience with the cashier. I decided to skip my lunch because I did not want to spend $7.58 for this crap. He is rude and does not listen to people's question, and all he is trying to do is to get you out of the way. I understand he is probably  just a student and work there part time, but this is just not right. Not sure if I am coming back again.",lmtBNzEzSe0-J2LZv-Z9jw,1,0,1,DN4i2Kt-DOfy6M_40CeJ_w

1454886,2018-02-27,0,wcn_uRigm1UXqjOEGW7ufw,This Panda Express is bad. The only advantage this horrible Panda Express has is that it is on campus. Students just have no other choice. Line is freaking long and slow. Some Certain foods always need 10-15 mins to be ready. Should call it sloth express. I Won't choose Panda Express at all out of campus. Bad bad bad.,mzOC-wWFc19bsHbfkd10HQ,0,0,1,umQLSb_2I9pwwbG8PN39pA
1895484,2016-08-27,0,wcn_uRigm1UXqjOEGW7ufw,Outstanding food with fresh vegetables at a great price.  It is a shame that the staff is rude and condescending while people order.  I do not understand why they perform one task and stop while you wait for someone else to help you instead of helping the one guest from start to finish.,y5dzQj5vlf50YAgmnlWlaQ,0,0,1,HbrtcvUNI-VLCJ5UthvOMQ
3030395,2015-03-21,0,wcn_uRigm1UXqjOEGW7ufw,This Panda Express location is good. I decided to eat something new since I kept eating the same thing over and over. I decided to try Panda Express at UNLV. The food here is good and the service was good also. The one thing I hate is that the food/entrees needs more flavor but still good. Will come back.,fTt_rcnc-nNpjWaDrbvEow,0,0,4,JZSKgmmUVKAdD6mKafOuSw
3709583,2016-10-01,0,wcn_uRigm1UXqjOEGW7ufw,This Panda Express in campus is awesome. The employees are nice and quick. The prices are okay but I understand considering it's on campus.,-WkOKCQxbVreEFQLBZex-g,0,0,5,K97A0HyuH6aBjeOui-cxoA
4597988,2015-01-14,0,wcn_uRigm1UXqjOEGW7ufw,"It's on campus, and convenient. It isn't as good as other panda express I've been to, in the recipes they use are a little different than other pandas as well. One thing I don't like is that they charge for refills of soda pop. This is the first hand I've ever been to the charges for refills. The food comes in a to-go box and not on a plate which I am ambivalent about but the menu selection is very limited compared to other panda express. I've eaten here when the items in the hot table really look old and quite nasty, Other times the food actually looks fresh-ish.",jChAO7evd3yoUBgo-L1LHQ,1,0,2,SP080FyWHQeLlw4b1zkh2g
4689632,2017-09-03,0,wcn_uRigm1UXqjOEGW7ufw,"I only come here for rice and veggies 
It's panda so nothing special not many vegetarian options or any actually and not many healthy options except the only thing I order. I love the price and the rice but I just wished they had tofu and other vegetable choices.",NVvm8H9U_nzXkjrhPXkg5w,0,0,3,cU_oSBrZ4RcSj6qMS7rHoA

I hope when we return tomorrow she will be there so we can say hi to her. You have a great employee there.,lrs8ZmzaHvy4Wj6u1pcX9w,0,0,5,5kyMt3rjQbKHWd_hfbFuzA

5220963,2017-04-19,0,wcn_uRigm1UXqjOEGW7ufw,"I love coming into restaurants that are generous with their portioning, Panda Express is one of them. However, don't come during closing time because they wont have as much variety of food left out and you'd have to wait 10-15 minutes for sides such as potstickers. 

They let you sample as much food as you want but sometimes it seems like they rush you when people are behind you. I don't recommend going through the drive thru, sometimes mine and my fiancè's orders would be switched around. I'd have his two sides and he'd have mine. Also, ordering it in person and seeing how much goes into your plate is much better, they're not rushing your order like they do through the drive thru.

I order the two entrée plate with fried rice, teryaki chicken, and the Beijing beef. Occasionally, I add in potstickers if there are some already made. If I'm dining in then I'd order a drink. For two, two entrée plates, and a drink would cost about $24, if no drink it would go down to about $21/$20 including tax.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,1,1,3,QRdUma_XsIXg1vFuZtxX9g
5660007,2011-10-20,2,wcn_uRigm1UXqjOEGW7ufw,"I sit, at the student union, writing this with a plate, still full of food, from Panda Express, beside me. Eff me for thinking that despite the fact I hate Panda Express, that it could  be good this time. After having a severe hankering for kim chi, and NO kim chi anywhere near this campus, I was relegated to Panda for food. 

My stomach is severely cramping and I feel like I'm going to vomit. I'm counting down the hours until I can finally get the heck out of here. 

Any food that makes you nauseous automatically gets no higher marks than 2 stars.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,0,2,J-97Eml2zsW6y59fD8Wgjw

All their employees are always smiling and so professional and attentive to their customers.
