Oh my gosh, I have never had a better philly cheese steak in my life; but, it doesnt stop there, I also had a slice of my friend's pizza and it was out of this world! Everything is reasonably priced for the quality you're getting. It is extremely clean and the lady at the register made sure I was treated right. She checked up on us after a few bites to make sure we were satisfied. I am making this place my new Friday spot with my friends!

The pizza sauce is flavorful, crust is really good suprisingly, the food is hot and fresh, fries are really good, and one of my most important things is the excellent service. The only thing I would have to encourage would be possibly adding another delivery driver or update your menus if there are times when you don't deliver. That's all.",H3L2v-voSEgrt5bSVOztXA,0,0,5,qxMHiBV0TQHgds6dmHSNSw

I'm guessing they charge to grill the onions. I ordered a philly, but it just tasted like pizza.

I was looking for something close by and I found this café and decided to go try it out. I was a little scared because the prices were very affordable I thought the food may taste bad. I'm so happy I decided to give it a try. The food was very good I had ordered the pizza, Garlic bread, and mozzarella sticks. I was there with my daughter and my fiancé. The pizza was nicely done in the mozzarella was nice and cheesy. I will recommend anyone to come here especially if you're waiting on the DMV. The café is very nice and small but not so small. The employees are very friendly and always there to help if you need any help. I also noticed that the café is very clean.",qEHkDPgjl_J9nUFoowk7qw,1,0,5,QHOsZfD1lZCDQJRUZgdBYA

1813860,2016-05-01,0,XAOOeEtTOlyRKdeX8cmAsQ,Was in the neighborhood looking to buy a new BMW and stopped by at Newport Motors to do so. After a long day of test driving and negotiating deals I worked up quite the appetite and saw Newport Cafe right next door. Walked in and was immediately greeted by friendly smiles and wonderful service by the cashier Renee and the rest of the staff here. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak as it was recommended as a customer favorite and it did not disappoint! I was so pleased with this restaurant that I decided to get a pizza to go. Now I'm riding home in my new BMW with a delicious box of Newport Cafe pizza.,TznxskPjDdxvKYCs-q9imA,1,0,5,E6uVrKTuIxu1FqiL3k1bXg

The restaurant was very clean. Brandon took my order and was very helpful and polite and he brought me pizza out to me when I was outside on the phone and went back for me Parmesan and chili.

Can I just say, the place is so nice. Well decorated and CLEAN. You can eat off the floor. And I have never said that about any restaurant or even my own kitchen. Lol.

The philly came out and to my surprise it wasn't gooped with an insane amount of cheese. It looked healthy!! And for that matter it even tasted healthy! (Like is that even possible for a cheese steak?) well they did it and it was delicious!! I was pleasantly surprised how well made and perfect it was.

Mozzarella Sticks were gooey but a little taffy like.  A thin 12-inch Ham & Cheese Pizza with extra ham and extra cheese was saucy, cheesy, and surprisingly good,  A Hero Sandwich with salami, turkey ham, and nicely melted Provolone Cheese inside a soft and warm hoagie roll was all hot and excellent, accompanied by lightly crispy Fries.  The small dining room is very casual, and there is no waiter service.  But this is a nice spot for lunch, especially so if your car is being serviced at one of the dealerships situated nearby.
