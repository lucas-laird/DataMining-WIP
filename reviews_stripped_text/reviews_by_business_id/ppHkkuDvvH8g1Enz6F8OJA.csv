This a smaller restaurant where you seat yourself at a variety of home style tables and are greeted by ever-changing paintings on the wall created by a local artist. The waitstaff here are young, as described in other posts, but we have always found them to be hard at work, always asking us what we need, making sure to get us our drinks quickly, and greeting customers as they come in. They even get to know their customers, and know regular drink and food orders. 

As for the food - well it is EXCELLENT! Now, I have only had breakfast here, but I have never had a bad meal. The home fries are Amazing, and are not full of grease or salt like you might get from larger chains. Everything is cooked fresh to order so most meals can be adjusted to your needs and since there are so many choices you can really create your own meal beyond what their menu has. The food also comes out super quick, considering there's only one or two cooks at a time, and everything is always delicious. 

My husband and I go here at least once a month, and we will continue to frequent this little shop as long as we live in Vegas. Some personal food recommendations - The Bacon sandwich is a go to for us, and if you want something to satisfy your sweet tooth, definitely opt in for their whipped cream on your pancakes as it is rich and creamy and very yummy. 

This restaurant is worthy of its 5-star rating from me!",r_DOwFXtp1IVVcUXwKxn4w,0,0,5,FtmVAUnuQmmq9Zcz31NptA

She replied by saying they were ""pretty small."" So I then proceeded to ask if two people could possibly share them?

I'm not sure what she thought I meant, or if she wasn't aware of the actual size of the chili cheese fries. But I feel like she either isn't sure of her job or if she was trying to up sell me more food.

205080,2014-01-27,2,ppHkkuDvvH8g1Enz6F8OJA,"Very disappointing. Why are they charging $4 for a plain cup of coffee? When I asked for Sweet'N Low because all they had was sugar, raw sugar, and stevia in the raw, I was told by the waitress they don't have Sweet'N Low and lest I think they're just out, no. The owner said she WILL NOT carry all the different brands of sweetener. Lots of people I know use Sweet'N Low and it's one of the cheaper sweeteners so why the stance against carrying what many people want? There aren't that many choices on the menu. My companion and I both got the Divine Throwback. $10 for two eggs, two strips of bacon, home fries, and 2 pancakes. It's $1 extra to substitute red velvet pancakes or french toast. My friend got the red velvet pancakes. She liked them. I got french toast. I wanted regular french toast and got pecan caramel french toast. One piece of regular bread cut into two triangles. The food was good and the service was friendly. However, other than the red velvet pancakes, nothing I can't make at home. I thought the prices were quite high for what you get. There are other places nearby that have similar food with more choices for cheaper prices. We ended up spending $30 minus tax and tip. $15 a person for breakfast? I don't mind paying more when I'm getting my money's worth. I didn't feel that was the case here. Also, other people are commenting on the decor. It's odd certainly but I didn't mind it.

373086,2014-02-21,0,ppHkkuDvvH8g1Enz6F8OJA,"I also wrote this on your Facebook page.  Your food is fantastic!  I just have two suggestions.  Please note while I do own a business, it is not a restaurant, however this advice applies to every business.  Because I own a business, I look out for my fellow small business owners.  As I explain below, I think you got something great, and rare, as your food is amazing and I want to see you succeed.  I am only writing this, as after seeing your new hours after just opening a few months ago, I had to write you, and I did not see a website, so this was my only way of writing you. 
First your hours.
Being that you are a new business, you got to pay your dues by being open longer.  Ask any business owner and they will tell you this, in the beginning you got to put in your hours to succeed, to build relationships, to get regulars by developing relationships with them.  11am -2pm during weekdays, would be okay if you were located downtown as you would get all the lawyers, and business' eating for lunch rush hours, but you are located in a residential area, where most of us are at work, and the stay at home moms are just starting their day, being located up here, I can't see how you aren't open after 5pm.  You can also loose future customers like regulars.  I am saying this from past experience.  In my business, I'm open 6 days a week, with long hours, but I too have emergencies, and sometimes post a letter on door saying I'm opening late, or am closed for a day, and I can't tell you how bad that pissed people off, they would write me that they wasted a drive, and how unprofessional it was, and they were right, as it can be quite annoying when you see a business closed after driving there and especially when its during business hours.  At first I thought they were just being petty, but learned quickly how many people it pissed off.  Eventually after growing you can cut down your hours, but for now you can't.  Because your rarely open, people will just give up all together, as most don't memorize your hours, and every time they come your closed.  Your food is so great, once word gets out you can also get customers from other areas in town to make the drive out to eat at your place, but you got to give it time for word to get out, and to keep getting referrals, as if they make the drive, and your closed you will loose them for good.  11am - 2pm up here is just pointless, you got to be open from noon to like 9pm, I thought closing at 5pm was bad, but 2pm is just not good.

Secondly know how expensive signs are, but one good future investment would be to get Divine Eatery letter sign next to your Cafe Sign above (or replace Cafe).  I know it's on the glass window and door, but you are missing a ton of business with to go orders, because a lot of people who don't know your business name can't call info (411) and get your number, as they will just see Cafe, and no one will think about looking at the window.  When you first open, I called 411 to make a to go order, and did not know your name, and there was nothing coming up for Café off Hualapai.  There are a lot of people, who are like me,who would probably prefer take out as they just got off work, and don't want to cook a meal for their family, so they would place a take out order with you. One suggestion I have is, maybe get a small, clean, classy banner to put above the Cafe sign, the City allows you to file for a 6month temp sign such as a banner (I had to do this with my business), and your allowed to file this once a year the fee is $100.  Now I don't know what your landlord rules are, but I'm sure if you pick a nice clean looking banner, they will have no problems. But this would give you time to save up for a new sign (I know their expensive as most simple signs start at $5,000) But your food is so good, I know if you eventually open for dinner during the week, you will get a ton of take out orders.  From business experience I have learned you got to pay your dues in the beginning, there are no shortcuts, and it takes time, time for word to get out, time for referrals, but once you give that time, it could really pay off.  Whatever you do, don't get frustrated and give up!.  Also, don't be shy, ask some food critics, or food journalists, to try out your food, as they can write a article about your place, it doesn't hurt to ask.  Sorry, I'm not trying to be overbearing but I know you have something special and I want to see you grow to your full potential, and because I have some business experience, I look out for my fellow small business owners (even when it's not my place to), and if I see some things that could help them, I offer my advice. As I know when you open a business its your dream, for most of us, we gave everthing we had, you just got to keep you dream burning, as one small mistake could close you.  But you are doing a great job, and as I said above your food is delicious!",7pkHvgWceC4DOH6kSIsLtQ,3,1,5,IDRoopIRB8O1rR_y966OPA

The parking lot was deserted which should have tipped us off.  Upon entering the waiter, although polite, was not personable. The decor is eccletic and relatively sparse with an open view of the kitchen.

I ordered the ""unred"" velvet pancakes with no icing and a side of biscuits and gravy. My wife opted for the bacon bacon cheese and bacon plate.  With my pancakes they forgot to leave the icing off which wasn't a big deal except the cook berated the waiter in front of us and the one other patron that had arrived.  Extremely unprofessional in my eyes, if I want to see chefs yelling at people I will turn on the food network.  The pancakes themselves arrived with small light colored chuncks in them I assumed were nuts but in actuallity looked like hard clumps of batter. My biscuits and gravy were done well the gravy just a touch on the salty side.  My wife's bacon bacon cheese bacon plate was underwhelmingly bacony.  She left it half eaten due to the fact ""it just didn't have much flavor"".

Going in we knew the price but after our underwhelming food it was definitely not worth it.  Still in search of a favorite breakfast spot.",A8cN6BZl57wW2gj--ke0sg,5,1,1,d8MgaxRlXiLHWW8zDyYTpw

I also had scrambled eggs, pork sausage, and home fries which were fantastic. You can taste the freshness in every bite. As for the decor....it's very warm and inviting!

I rarely drink soda, but they have cherry coke on tap...yippee!

The one complaint I have, and it is a big one because it is the thing that really completes a hot breakfast...is that the breakfast potatoes were NOT GOOD. They were WAY TOO SALTY and I believe they came from a bag. They were tiny, dry, crispy squares, and totally inedible.

Being the curious person that I am, I came across Divine Eatery while under construction and stuck my head in. Chef Esther welcomed me inside, amidst the construction, and offered me a tour of the new casual restaurant she's creating here in Centennial Hills. The menu (while not finalized at the time of my visit) boasts true quality, focusing on all natural, preservative-free, fresh and healthy ingredients. In addition to the tour, Chef Esther was kind enough to provide me with a taste test of their BLT and their Veggie Burger. The bread used for both were superb, and sourced locally! The BLT was served on a toasted whole grain, while the Veggie Burger was served on an perfectly airy sesame bun. Chef let me know that the menu will also feature items served on a brioche bun, for the richer, ""wicked"" offerings... yum! Now being from Texas, I prefer meat over veggies, so naturally I thought the BLT would take the cake in a comparison test - [Now Insert Foot In Mouth]. If there's anything I learned from Chef Esther, it's never to doubt the power of a Veggie Burger. Long story short, when you pair roasted assorted veggies topped with fresh mozzarella, caramelized red onions and a balsamic reduction, you've just convinced this meat eater that this Veggie Burger is taking home the top prize!

There's plenty to get excited about Divine Eatery. I'm excited to come back after their up and running to experience the restaurant as a whole! While construction completion dates are always iffy, I'm crossing my fingers that Divine Eatery opens on their estimated date of Sunday, August 25.

Only 1 coffee choice- American- ie, black coffee.  Also, since it's special, it's $4.  I don't think any monkeys ate and then pooped out the beans, though.

The food- the omelette was awesome.  Done nicely!

Will this place make it?  Don't know, unfortunately.  I'd love for this to be my local breakfast spot that's within walking distance.  There are 3 other breakfast spots in Centennial Hills that have more ambiance, a more interesting menu, and cheaper prices.  Yikes!  Also, not a fan of the planted reviews (see Kate B).

On the strength of positive Yelp results we found this place.  Although we didn't have anything out of the ordinary, the food was delicious.  My wife's chicken fried steak measured up to everything she would expect, coming as we are from the home of fried food covered in gravy.  The ambiance was quaint with its home grown art and mismatched furniture.  It's sort of clashed with the modern strip mall building, but otherwise was charming.  

Business was brisk but it wasn't crowded like a lot of breakfast places are so if you find long lines at your favorite place this is a good place to consider.  I would have given it another star, but when we arrived there was only one employee doing it all.  He did a pretty good job of taking care of everybody, and eventually more help arrived.  But they could have had a better schedule the day we went.

The only complaint I have is the prices. Not exactly family friendly prices. However because they are actually serving real food from scratch I can see why it's pricier than most places.

DE...is as the crow flies...just short of mile from the domicile. A residence that I have inhabited for almost half a decade.  Maybe there should be be more check-in's.....I don't know.

On the most recent visit, I met the GF as she was coming off shift for some breakfast.  The DE was what was decided upon.

I arrived first and found not much happening on a beautiful, unseasonably warm Saturday morning.  Many a table option to choose from.  I sat and sipped on my coffee and water waiting for the GF.

Looking at the menu I decided on the ""Chilaquiles"" which consists of 
""Freshly deep fried corn tortillas, slow roasted pulled pork and smothered with salsa verde then topped with 2 eggs, queso fresco and chive sour cream"" (Retrieved from https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/divine-eatery-7181-n-hualapai-wy-115-las-vegas/348582?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIu7TA1fWN2QIVT2x-Ch1u2Qt5EAAYASAAEgKRYPD_BwE&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Las%2BVegas%2C%2BNV%2B%7C%2BLas%2BVegas%2C%2BNV%2B%7C%2BRestaurants&utm_term=%2Bdivine%20%2Beatery%20%2Bmenu&efkwid=274867955246&ef_id=WnfbGQAAAAF-rBOV%3A20180205041916%3A).  Wow!! I was not expecting that URL!  When it arrived the chips were for the most part....soggy.

I also ordered up some linked sausage and an a half order of ""Funky Monkey.""  It's French Toast with a peanut butter whipping cream and a sugar torched banana thrown on top.  Hell!  It was a cheat day!

The chow was three stars as was the service.  I thought whole thing could have been maybe a four....but when your coffee cup runneth empty, and there is not happening in the restaurant and it sits there for what seems FOREVER...and nothing happens, a breakfast joint is gonna loose a star.

However, the steak Benedict is no longer on the menu? That was the best thing. And they kept selling out of it beforehand. You had to come early to get it. It was a hot item & now they took it away? Makes no sense.

The menu is VERY inconsistent and the food is ALWAYS inconsistent.

This is the SECOND time coming where we ordered the food, and then 10 minutes later, they come back and say they don't have the food item? So we have to re-order. That is absolutely unacceptable. Not one but TWO times.... in a row!!!!! 

KNOW YOUR MENU. Know what you have and what you don't have before you seat customers. Warn them that something is sold out!

I kept coming back to see if they would make better changes but unfortunately I believe this will be my last time at this restaurant.

My potatoes were not even seasoned! Not even with salt or pepper.
My omelet order came wrong the first time and they had to re-make it.

The bus girls dismal lack of knowledge of even the drinks available and even worse our severs lack of any timing whatsoever was of no help. Drinks were never refilled, who has one coffee? Had to ask for flatware The dishes came out one at a time about 5 minutes apart. 
The bacon was overdone and of very poor quality, like the cheapest bacon at the grocery store. 
The unred velvet pancakes probably the best of our dishes but too sweet for my tastes. 
The biscuits and gravy was very meh.. The biscuits sweet doughy and not flaky at all. Tasted under cooked. The gravy was so so nothing wrong but nothing special. The chiliquiles with pork were just a mess no salsa and dry chips and the pork was flavorless and seemed to have been prepared in either a slow cooker or pressure cooker either way not good. The frosted flake French toast was ok but again nothing special. The bread choice was not good, too thin and not enough mouthfeel. 
Good berries.

2225481,2014-02-26,2,ppHkkuDvvH8g1Enz6F8OJA,"always happy when new joints open up in our neck o the woods and even happier to support small local businesses, i was thrilled to see that an eatery was opening so close to home.
this little locals cafe is just one big square room with tables, chairs and a completely open kitchen, which i find delightful because it just makes you feel like you're having a home cooked meal at a friend's house.
all of the furniture is mismatched, which i also find delightful but i'm sure it was unintentional as opening a restaurant is expensive so they saved on the furniture and spent most of their budget on more important things like good kitchen equipment.
whether intentional or not, i absolutely love the warm, inviting, comforting feel of the place with all of its fun and quirky furniture.

the first time i dined here was for breakfast in the afternoon with the hubby.
i'm of the mindset that breakfast can and should be eaten any time during the day.
chef esther greeted us and right away i had the feeling that i was about to enjoy an extremely comforting meal.
i had a stack of buttermilk pancakes and a veggie omelet.
both were prepared perfectly, i haven't a single complaint.
i was so satisfied with my meal and the service that i couldn't wait to go back.

we ordered take out a few times after that.

on our second visit, we arrived about 15 minutes prior to closing and chef esther welcomed us just as warmly as the first time AND she remembered us which was really pleasant.
we didn't want to keep her too long so we took a quick look at the menu (which had improved significantly since our first visit) and ordered.
i ordered the eggs benedict and, of course, she was out of hollandaise.
then, to my surprise, she said she'd whip some up just for my order.
WHAT!?
if anybody has any clue, hollandaise sauce is one of those mother sauces in french cooking that people hate to make because it is so precise and can break very easily.
so, i told her no but she insisted.
again, WHAT!?
as she began to make the 4 meals that the 3 of us ordered, she was also making my hollandaise.
i must admit that i had my doubts about her ability to do all of these things simultaneously.
but, to my delight, our food came out within a few minutes of ordering all at the same time and my hollandaise was perfect!
as we ate our delicious food, we all had a little giggle with chef esther as she told us the story of the first time she had to make hollandaise in culinary school.
yes, folks, she is a classically trained chef so...eat that.  =)

i've since been back many times and have enjoyed every bite.
the food here is most definitely made with love and care, never too salty, never underseasoned, always cooked to your exact preference.
there are understandably minor kinks to be worked out, as with any new small business, but certainly nothing that would prevent me from returning time and again.
it's easy to see that chef esther is working her tail off to make it a comfortable and inviting spot for all of us here in northlandia.

I think this little (think only five businesses in the complex) business complex only thing in the area. Not from lack of homes in the area but if not living in the area not sure if want make long drive. The food overall more like solid three stars but the service was without doubt five star in my mind. 

The food I ordered ""The Skinny Skillet"" was interesting take on skillet. I was thinking of maybe more traditional in casket iron skillet serve it in or even cook it in. They cook everything in separate pan and then put everything on the plate. I love the nice thick cuts of potatoes! They keep some of the skin on the potato. Just the hearty mixture between the turkey burger, sun dried tomato, and feta cheese. In every bite can get mixture or pick and choose. Top it off with fried egg (you can have the egg cook any style you want) my favorite things and anything tastes better with fried egg. You get some of that running cream egg yolk mixed in with everything. Good stuff!!! The plate is totally packed so there no cheating you out of your meal for the price. 

The ""Unred"" Velvet pancakes that was another interesting take on classic. i shared the pancakes with Suzy H. Yelpers need do our due diligence check out as much things on the menu for the first time! Maybe just stuck on traditional style. The fact that take out the red food coloring had my brain thinking is this trick. It looks more like chocolate pancake and that the first taste came to mind. The pancake not as fully but more dense. Not bad pancake at all. Just something never did much for me overall. If order pancakes again here would go try the other options on the menu.

The service that something that needs to be recognize! The gentlemen serving us was fabulous. The chef or she might be owner came out later checking up on not just us but two other tables dining at the same time. Both super friendly, attentive to details, and great peeps talk stories too! The gentlemen even offer if wanted take waters or coffee to go with us. Not often you hear your wait staff say that as your about to leave. Or the fact for the kids menu they serve capri sun juice as a drink option. I like the interior have local artists original artwork on the walls. If you want can purchase. The artwork fits with the restaurant. The only downfall is the location. If the food was more wow factor would make the drive. Really one of those that if am in the area would come back again.

We stopped by in mid-afternoon after a morning at the nearby Knickerbocker Park.  We had to be careful, though, because the operating hours are a bit wonky on the weekend (i.e. closed from 2:00-5:00 p.m.).

The menu is surprisingly large for such a small outfit, and it's great that breakfast is served all day.  My twins also appreciated the yummy choices on the Kids' Menu.  It's a tad on the pricey side, but not outrageous.  The quality of food and service was great.

The eating space is small, and cramped.  If it gets too busy, it gets extra stuffy and noisy, but that's to be expected.  It's also a bit awkward to have the kitchen so exposed.  I don't like listening to the cook barking out orders to the kitchen staff.  I was also a little put off by items being thrown across the kitchen.  The cook would call out for pulled pork, and someone would retrieve it from a cooler and hail mary it across all of 4 feet.  Nothing outright wrong per se, but just awkward I guess.

When we walked in the door, first we were not even greeted, or acknowledged in any way. We waited for a while about 10 minutes before we were seated. Fine, it's busy I get it. However, after we were sat, it took the server another 10 minutes or so to come to the table. We order our drinks and food, and the kid who sat us brings over the diet cokes....if he was going to bring them anyways why not ask for our drink order from the beginning, avoiding the long wait for the server. 
In any case our food took over an hour to arrive. I ordered a skirt steak sandwich and my friend had ordered a patty melt. She said her food was good, and mine was good for the most part, aside from the ""grilled tomatoes"" actually just being tomatoes that got hot from being on the sandwich...gross. 
We had waited too long, and we were far too hungry to send the food back for the grilled tomatoes, so I just picked off the tomatoes, although the table next to me did complain about theirs. 
When the young man came by to give a refill, he asked that I remove the straw from the cup because he was going to take the old glass and refill it so he wouldn't ""waste any more cups."" What? First of all, it's a health code violation to take a dirty cup from the table and refill and bring back to the table. Secondly, if he was going to do that, fine whatever but just give me a new straw then. Why leave me sitting there holding a straw? It was ridiculous.  Also, this same young man had gone and asked a table of guests if they had any advil? 
Service was sub par, from both the young man (busser/host/server assistant?) and the actual server. She was not very friendly, but who can blame her? SHE WAS THE ONLY SERVER in a restaurant where every single table was full. She was busy and clearly overwhelmed. After I paid the check, I needed it broken down, so I could leave a proper tip. Apparently, the owner was running the cash drawer, as the restaurant was running in chaos. When I asked her why there was only one server for Sunday Brunch, she very rudely told me that they're a small business, it's hard to get help.

The good: food is really good. They will adjust menu choices a bit, especially since I'm gluten free and need to cut bread from my diet. They have a variety of egg dish choices that are good, I often will piece two together as I like different ingredients from two of their choices. 

Before I discovered (thanks doc)  I was gluten sensitive I had their Frosted Flakes French Toast, I have to say very tasty, unique, but good. A little sweet,especially with syrup, so if you don't like super sweet, don't go for it. 

The not so good: service - the people are fantastic, let me say that..they are slow though. So if you go be prepared to sit back and relax, don't go if you are in a hurry or really hungry (mistake I've made).

My wife buys an entertainment book every year from the local girl scouts. When we decide to go out to eat, we just cycle through the coupons to choose the next restaurant. It's great because we are always trying something new (and getting a discount).  It's a win for both us and the restaurant gaining a potentially new customer.  This time it's for the divine eatery.  It's very frustrating to choose a place because of a deal they've made with the coupon book people, go out, eat a meal, and then be told that they are no longer accepting coupons. Even though it's no where near it's expiration. Just to fill you in it's a buy one entree get one entree free (so about $9 in this case).  It's not about the money...

I am assuming it is because the place is brand new, but the ambiance is very bland. Solid walls with only one small piece of art. The mish mash of tables doesn't bother me, but I seriously wondered if the chair I sat in was going to hold me (very wobbly).

Drinks are WAY overpriced, but the food prices for the most part are reasonable.

I had the pulled pork sandwich and potato salad. The sandwich was fantastic, fresh and flavorful. The potato salad was good, but I am not a fan of mustard based salads (my fault, I should have asked). Potatoes were fresh and tender, but not fall apart tender, so they stuck on your fork.

DH had the biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs and seasoned potatoes. The food all needed a bit of salt, but otherwise was very tasty and hearty.

DD had the ""fingers"", panko breaded chicken fingers. I was a little put off that it did not come with fries, so we added those on. The fingers are real chicken and substantial pieces. It was tender and juicy. The fries appear to be hand cut and were really yummy once you added some salt.

It reminds me of Saturday morning breakfast as a child. The pancakes are fluffy and have a good vanilla flavor to them. They come with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. They are sweet on their own, the syrup isn't necessary with the whip cream. I really love them. The only thing I don't like is they have a strange after taste, it tastes like they make the pancakes on the same griddle or spot that they make the bacon/meat. It tastes unintentional and makes me wonder if there is a cross contamination going on. Not raw food wise but while on the griddle like the grease may come in contact with the batter? It's weird. I'm not vegetarian but if I was I'd be concerned. 

I LOVE the potatoes they are not your regular ""hash brown"" they are diced and fried. My favorite!! The eggs are average as well as the bacon. 

For all that food it's around $10. Can't beat it!

My chair was wobbly so I know it wasn't new stuff. Besides that, the walls are also completely bare...no pictures, art, signs, nothing! 

Their menu is also a little on the weird side. It's very limited and the way it's typed up is awkward. And the food doesn't save this place either. I went with the Divine Throwback which is basically just a pancake and two egg breakfast priced at $10! The pancakes were bland and tough, I could barely cut them with my fork. For some reason they add powdered sugar to them but barely any at that, so it adds no flavor. The rest was just basic stuff anyone can make at home, but make better. My meal also included burnt bacon and unseasoned home fries...Yum! My son got chocolate chip pancakes which were ok but only cause they had chocolate in them. Basically the pancakes don't even stand out against regular boxed pancake mix. 

I'm not sure how this place will stay in business other than being the only breakfast spot that is so close to all those homes. They don't offer anything unique and it's overpriced. $3 for sodas and iced tea...we're not in downtown LV here! The service was decent but that's not hard to accomplish with only two tables at 10am.

We ordered the sausage biscuits, chili omelet and chilaquiles (without pork). I didn't take any pictures because quite frankly there wasn't anything exceptional about the appearance. 

My son's sausage biscuits had jelly with the egg, cheese and sausage (jelly was inside the sandwich). It was one of those times that I was ok with him not finishing his food. 

My chilaquiles was not very enjoyable...tortillas were soggy, not much cheese or sour cream and green chili tasted like it was store bought.

My husbands chili omelet was ok - nothing to celebrate. The toast that came with it was slightly burnt and ""home fries"" tasted stale with no seasoning. 

The orange juice ordered was $3.95 - even though it was store bought where I saw the juice container sitting in ice that it came from.

After seeing this place had good reviews I decided to give it a try only to find that this little place serves mediocre food and charges $4 for a cup of store bought coffee.

It's an unusual set up inside with no hostess stand or check in area, a seat yourself atmosphere with a view of the ""kitchen"" and open floor plan for servers to grab your drinks or coffee and garage sale find decor splashed in random places throughout the restaurant. 

I ordered the ""Divine original"" and a short stack of the nutty french toast. My partner ordered the Denver omelet. I was able to see the chef from my table and everything we ordered was pre-made, generic, boxed items. He pulled my french toast out of the fridge and threw it in the deep fryer (why?) to cook, used box eggs, pre-made potatoes and the coffee was from Winco, not some special roast their website claims it to be. 

We received our food and were both unimpressed with the outcome. It all tasted bland and like something we could have made at home for less money and a better price. Lesson learned.

3617403,2017-10-28,4,ppHkkuDvvH8g1Enz6F8OJA,"Another review of places to eat near the new house, this one less than a mile away I think.  

It has an average of 4 stars but we were a bit cautious because of the ""suburban star rating"" theory but had no reason to worry, it's definitely an eatery that has a lot going for it.  Its location is good, in a small strip mall with ample parking. The inside feels like the perfect size for a neighborhood eatery and is clean and cheery, as well.  The staff is also friendly and attentive.  The best reason of course is the food, some well prepared versions of the standard diner breakfast/lunch meals with a few creative variations thrown in.

I had the Country fried steak which was really good.  They used a good quality of cubed steak that was thicker than the normal pieces I get at other places.  The steak was pretty tender as well with a nice crunchy breading.  The sausage gravy was your standard white gravy with bits of sausage in it.  The potatoes were done nicely and the two eggs that came with the dish (ordered sunnyside up) were done perfectly.  I'm a sucker for runny yolk for sure.

Mark H had the Country Benedict - sausage patty, poached egg, country gravy on English muffin.  It's also served with a huge portion of breakfast potatoes, huge enough for people that want to carbo-load for a marathon or just trying to add to their girth.  He said the dish was really tasty.

As a bonus, we split a half order of the Nutty french toast.  It's Texas toast, battered and dipped in chopped pecans with some caramel sauce covering to boot.  This was pretty good, hit the sweet tooth nicely.

Quite a few menu options here from Benedicts, Griddle or Skillet meals, Omelets, and even a few mexican dishes like Burritos and Chilaquiles.  When I'm up there during New Year's, I'm pretty sure we'll eat here again.",IfLTw-yFMpuiqAdYRxLv8Q,11,7,4,U2Au23Onbha9ZcGSmYsiJw

After about 10 min he came back to the table and told us they had to brew another pot of coffee.  Ok? Can we have the other drinks we ordered?  Anyway, we finally got the coffee and he took our order. 20 min in at this point. 
They have a nice menu, good selection!
I ordered the Devine pancakes, other people in my party ordered the Eggs Benedict, the Bagel and Lox plate, and French toast, and a parfait.
The service was just terrible.  Never refilled the coffee, sodas or iced tea.  The food took forever!  The pancakes were very good.  The Eggs Benedict was ok,  the sauce had no flavor, potatoes were cold. The French toast was good.  The person who ordered the bagel and lox got a bagel with cream cheese.  He sent it back saying he ordered the lox plate.  They brought it back with lox on it but no tomatoes and onions, as the menu stated.  Also we asked for the parfait we ordered.   
At this point we just ate what we had and tried to enjoy our brunch.  
They brought the check and the parfait about 10 min after we finished our meal.  It was nasty and we just laughed at that point.

I had the Un-Red velvet pancakes-short stack. It was 2 large pancakes, but something was missing besides the red food coloring. They just didn't taste right (almost like the batter was old). The pancake on the bottom was very dry as the icing was only enough for the top. I have eaten red velvet pancakes at Babystacks and they don't even need icing/syrup.
The Throwback plate eggs were ordered Over Medium but were more like Over Easy-Sausage links were not cooked long enough and a little spicy-got the french toast with this and it was burnt on 1 side.

We ordered the nutty french toast  short stack order ( 4 triangles) to share. They did not skimp on the pecans coating this and the caramel sauce was just right. I love pecan pie and french toast so this is a awesome combination of those.

I got eggs benedict as a main. I got the vegetarian one somehow even though I ordered the regular, but I totally didn't mind as it was very tasty with the tomato and spinach in lieu of ham. The one thing I highly respect is that I overheard that she was making fresh hollandaise as the last batch was splitting as it sat and she was not going to serve that. I admire high standards and the payoff is a beautiful creamy sauce and a pleased customer. That is one of the better bennys in town because of the perfect Hollandaise. The home fried potatoes were nicely seasoned as well.

David got the chorizo burrito. I took a bite and thought the flavors of it was great and it was a pretty sizable portion.

Our beverages was kept on by our server and the chef/owner came out to chat and was pretty personable. I like that this is a open kitchen and you can see them make your food.

Short stack of Chocolately Red Velvet Pancakes - goodness. I'm not big on sweets, but these were freaking delicious. They were so fluffy, full of flavor and the homemade whipped icing was the bestest. 

Biscuits and Gravy - very good. I usually don't get this because gravy is so filling, I barely eat anything. And sure enough, I ate about 1/4. The gravy is very good though. It's a very strong sausage flavor, which is why I loved it. The biscuits were very light and fluffy. Delicious. 

Eggs Benedict - very good. In comparison to most benedicts that are good. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but it was still delicious.

8oz Divine BBQ Burger ($10): Cheddar Cheese, BBQ sauce, Crispy Bacon, Onion Strings & Fries. This was a very lean burger, cooked perfectly, just no juices on the squeeze.  It was not very messy at all actually...they could be a little more liberal with the BBQ sauce as well IMO.

The walls are still plain (no pictures, art, or signage, yet). Very quiet, with only three employees (Chef Esther (owner), Waitress Mary (friend of owner), and dishwasher son. Another customer couple was leaving as we sat down, while a third couple came in as we were leaving. So, steady business, but not overwhelming. This adds to the personal service received by not just Mary but Chef Esther as well. Everyone was so very friendly and polite!
The menu is just a two page flyer, but has all the offerings you'd expect from a 9 am - 5 pm cafe, at very reasonable prices.
The drinks ranged from fountain sodas, to flavored teas (hot and cold) and coffee. The coffee was extremely hot but a little weak for my taste, and the sweeteners available were only sugar, turbinado (cane sugar), and Stevia in the Raw. I think this goes with the natural, no preservatives thought of the restaurant. Still, I prefer Splenda.

Finally, the food. I had the Divine Biscuits and Gravy, which besides two biscuits with pork or turkey gravy, came with cubed potatoes (""home fries"") and two eggs any style. The biscuits were the yellow, layered flaky kind, which is fancy. I prefer buttermilk biscuits, but these tasted good. The gravy was a bit bland, no meaty flavor. I suspect that because the restaurant is new, they make small portions, and the gravy doesn't have time to soak up the flavor of the meat? Perhaps even making a plain gravy then adding the type of meat to it upon ordering. The food came VERY hot, especially the potatoes that, once cooled, were very tasty. The over easy eggs I received were good, too.

My wife ordered ""The Healthy Way"" which was VERY flavorful, especially the ""tomato composee"" which was cubed tomatoes with basil. She gave me her wheat toast which was so light and crispy. VERY tasty! 

All in all, it was a very good experience. We will be going back again, bringing our teenage children. I believe with the foundation already in place, most notably the great service, this place is going to build up to be something amazing, and I'm glad that I will be there to experience it.

Country Fried Steak- I did not love the meat. I think it's because it was a different consistency then I am accustomed to eating. I liked the breading, it reminded me of breaded Cuban steaks my aunt used to make. I asked for the eggs over hard and they were perfect. The potatoes were fresh and cut in up like home fries, but I prefer hash browns. I ordered it with a biscuit and had it smothered in gravy. BEST recommendation, it was amazing.

Denver omelet- my husband said it was fresh, but wished we would have added cheese because it was dry. We ordered it with a biscuit, but they forgot to give it to us. No big deal, we should have checked the order when we picked it up.

VEGGIE BURRITO ($10.95): Kind of pricey for a breakfast burrito, especially because there's no side! I wish there was more potatoes and that they were crispier. If there's such a thing as scrambled eggs being too moist, yup, that happened. The burrito was just okay. I would order something different next time - maybe pancakes! 3/5

STEAK MELT SANDWICH ($10.95): My husband opted for lunch instead. He LOVED his sandwich and raved that the meat was ""the good stuff"", i.e., not fatty. He also upgraded the fries to garlic fries for an extra $1. The fries were great! Super fresh! 4.5/5

SERVICE: The server was pleasant and the chef/owner was warm and friendly. Even though we came in 30 minutes before closing, the server didn't rush us at all and told us to take our time. Our server also sent us off with a to-go cup of a fountain drink ($2). Thanks! Cuz we thirsty! The chef chatted with us and told us how she used to work in the casinos and opened up her own restaurant for a more ideal work schedule. 4/5

ATMOSPHERE: Tables and chairs are mismatched and the cafe is pretty small. The walls are lined with artwork from local artists available for purchase. Music (from the chef's Ipod?) plays in the background. 3/5   

Return Visit?
I'd come back sometime in the future. 

PRO TIP: There's a BOGO entree coupon for Divine Eatery in those Entertainment Books for 2015.

Located all the way up in Centennial and tucked away in a small business park it was a serendipitous mention by a colleague browsing restaurant.com that lead me through the doors of Divine Eatery just after seven on a bright Saturday morning, my entry met by an empty dining room and warm welcomes from the lone cook and single server.  Not exactly the sort of place one stumbles upon but warm and cheery with local art available for purchase on the walls the menu of Divine Eatery is divided into breakfast/lunch sections for those arriving from 7a-2p with dinner commencing at five o'clock and with both staples and novelties available my order veered towards breakfast - a three part order mistakenly turning into four when my server seemingly read my mind and ordered dessert for me even though I'd not requested it.  Surprisingly soon to swell in patronage as the clock struck 7:30 and reaching perhaps 2/3 capacity by eight it was with several cups of Seattle's Fonte coffee and the restaurant's 80s soundtrack that I passed time until my breakfast arrived and citing Divine's reluctance to stock artificial sweetener ""to focus on natural, unprocessed"" food I have to say I was a bit let down as all options arrived with artificial maple syrup while the $5 Red Velvet short-stack tasted not only processed but chalky as well.  Turning my attention to the items that worked, both the scratch made buttermilk biscuit and crispy French Toast serving as a sort of crust to a topping of pecan pie proved remarkable while my freebie dessert - not at all natural or unprocessed - was exactly what you'd expect, the strawberry jus sopped up into the light batter of the Twinkie rousing thoughts of the pending summer and shortcake.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,2,3,G-teS7Bf-UXqjlOsgsihuA

Unfortunately, I wish we would have just gone to the same old stand by in the area.  We walked in about 9:30 am. The place was empty. We were the only guests. We were hesitant to sit but didn't want to turn and run. We ordered coffees, which they had to make fresh since there was no business.  Happy to have fresh coffee but that was another red flag.  They brew the Costco Columbian ground coffee from the can, not bad but I brew better coffee at home.  They should at least do it where I can't see what I'm paying too much for. We ordered the ""throw back"" and ""pop's omelet sandwich"".  Food was underwhelming. Think potatoes home made and they were best part of meal. Omelet sandwich didn't have cheese? I should have read menu description better. We could have made a higher quality and better tasting meal at home. You definitely don't get what you pay for.  Prices are a few bucks too high for the quality of food they are serving.   Maybe their overhead is too high.

5373588,2013-12-28,2,ppHkkuDvvH8g1Enz6F8OJA,"The Northwest is becoming one of my new favorite places to hang out. Probably more so now that they have actual places to visit up there. What was once a barren no man's land is sprouting new businesses. Divine Eatery is one of those places. I tend to be pretty critical about breakfast based places because they tend to be overpriced for stuff I can make at home. 

With Divine Eatery, I could probably make most of the items myself. Then I watch the owner make hollandaise sauce from scratch and think that I would rather not. There are many reasons why I like them more than their competition. 

One: there is this cool shabby chic look to the establishment. All the mismatched tables, chairs, and service ware is neat. It takes the stress off of a business to find a singular distributor while giving the restaurant a relaxed and home like feel. 

Two: The food is unpretentious. It is just comfortable food. I had the three egg omelet. The best part, it comes with five additional toppings. No one does that. Usually it is a three item limit. It would have been easier for me to tell her what I didn't want in my meal. When it came out, the eggs were cooked beautifully with a good amount of spinach, mushrooms, peppers, jalapenos, and avocado. The home fries were soft and pillowy on the inside and seasoned to perfection. The pancakes were fluffy and came in a mountain sized portion. The whipped butter and fresh strawberries are a nice touch. Between the three of us, we were unable to finish the mound. Of course, we each had our own dishes, but it was too much. For the quality of food, the price point is reasonable. 

Three: The service is attentive and friendly. The open style kitchen makes it feel like being inside someone's home. It was nice to be able to talk to the owner as she was preparing our meal. I just hope to be able to catch them when they have some daily specials. After my friends told me about the loco moco, I cannot stop thinking about getting one.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,5,1,4,fzbyvYp95C3SaRIopylhow

For breakfast I had the smores pancake and my friend had the nutty French toast and they were both 5 stars.. But the tall stack was a little much and they didn't come with sides which is understandable due to the large quantity of pancakes! Anyway, the server kept offering to go coffee which was awesome, I love places that offer free coffee refills.

We often get the same server, whose name I believe is Javier. He is a saint, remembering our drink orders each visit and never leaving my cup o' Fonte (aka the best coffee EVER) less than half full and piping hot. He is the best! I've seen him efficiently and calmly serve an entire restaurant of people without breaking a sweat. Whenever we see he's our server, we know it's going to be a good dining experience!

The food is scrumptious. I like that they have lots of vegetarian and healthy options. Watching your diet? Get egg whites for no charge! You can also substitute sides of potatoes and bacon or sausage with a side salad, rice, or berries. 

I don't watch my weight because I am a glutton who is in love with their home fries. Some people might consider them too salty, but I think they're heavenly. The best thing I've ever ordered here is the Frosted Flakes french toast, which consists of rich, thick french toast fried in a crunchy coating of Frosted Flakes cereal and covered with powdered sugar and berries. They will probably be the cause of my inevitable diabetes and/or weight gain, but I don't care. They're delicious!

Prices are a little steeper here than at most diners, but it's well worth it to avoid the blandness and monotony of IHOP and Denny's. Just say no to fast food breakfast chains, and say YES to Divine Eatery!",ioAxaAZTOIfa-3AkwixF-Q,1,0,4,RMpaL-XkjIEqae84e3kk5g

Went on Sunday 8-30-15 around 12:30 PM.  This restaurant is located on the corner of Hualapai and Elkhorn.  It did not look promising from the outside, sandwiched between a tobacco shop and a dog groomers but we threw caution to the wind and entered. Inside we found approximately ten tables, all of which are a hodge-podge mix of yard sale junk all fixed up.  There is a bench by the front door...oh my lord, that bench....it took all I had not to have my friend distract the waiter and run out the door with that bench.  Best part about the whole place, honestly.  

It seems like a bunch of middle-eastern dudes decided to open up a breakfast place.  Heck, they may even run the tobacco store two doors down.  $13.51 got me a pulled pork sandwich, fries, and the most expensive glass of apple juice I've ever had at $3.95 and no refills. Why, oh why, did I decide to get a pulled pork sandwich at an Armenian-American breakfast restaurant is beyond me.  It was a bad decision.  

The sandwich looked quite lovely, but imagine week-old pulled pork thrown on the grill top and re-heated with no barbecue sauce and cole slaw.  The pork was crispy.  I took a couple bites and put it down.  It was wretched.   It was served with real potato french fries.  They kind of reminded me of well-done In-N-Out fries with no salt.  

And then today, I am reminded of Kevin Buckman's song from the movie Parenthood (1989): When you're sliding into first and you're feeling something burst, diarrhea, diarrhea. When you're sliding into third and you feel a juicy turd, diarrhea, diarrhea. When you're sliding into home and your pants are full of foam, diarrhea, diarrhea. When you're driving in your Chevy and your pants are feeling heavy, diarrhea, diarrhea. 

I was going to give this place 3 stars but something happened while we were dining that bumped it down a star for me.  A customer walked out the front door and bit the dust on the pavement.  This poor old lady was laying there and only one employee from this restaurant went over to help.  Five male employees were sitting inside drinking coffee and one of them said ""Must have been her high heels."" 

 Now, call me too sensitive, but any place that won't help an old lady and gave me the runs is a place I will never go back to.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,6,0,2,5EQFg2x42ICkYAcfysSWXA
