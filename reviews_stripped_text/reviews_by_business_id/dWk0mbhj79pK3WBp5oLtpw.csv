After just landing in town for our wedding we decided to stop in and get some food. The staff was so uncoordinated; one told us to sit at a table, then another told us we can't sit there. Then another said no it's fine then another said ""no sorry you can't sit there unless you are ordering food (which i think she was under the impression we were just having drinks for some reason? As one person wasn't eating Even though most of us were starved and couldn't wait to eat!) she continued with a saucy tone and said ""it is what it is"".  So we got up and left without ordering and went somewhere else.

  So much confusion for just wanting a simple meal after a long flight. The most uptight unwelcoming Irish pub I've ever been to. To be fair I'm sure it's not always this way and we might have just been served by the bad apples, but I made sure our 70 guests who flew into town knew not to waste their time attending.",-6_D3_aPhXsCcKzSAJhY9A,2,0,1,VQNtcxqGI3XNv0_gbbQbmg

52655,2015-02-12,0,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"So me and two of my friends were walking around the Mandalay Shops tonight and we ended up at this place cuz the music was kinda fun. So they didn't had any tables available and we ended up seating with this bunch of people just to watch the band playing and have some shots. We only got 6 shots ($10 each) and one beer. The shots were kinda small compared to what u usually get everywhere in Vegas but why not right? So everything was alright until the check came. For some reason it had 20% gratuity already included so we were like ""wow thats really sneaky"" (let me just state the fact that me and my friends are servers in one of the casinos so we know about gratuities) So when we asked the server she said that the gratuity was included cuz we were a party of 6 or more. At that point we were really confused cuz we clearly stated when she first took our order that we didnt knew this people and the checks were separated. So, of course, she brings the manager just to tell us the same story. That they COULD NOT remove the gratuity which is a LIE and a violation of the gratuity law in Las Vegas. I understand that every place wants to make revenue but if your gonna stiff your guests and make them feel uncomfortable you should take your bussiness some place else. Its a shame such a cute little place ruined with that greedy staff.

124847,2012-04-14,5,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"My opinion, one of the greatest places in LV. Small but very accommodating. I came in with my bf around 12am after walking back and forth from Luxor to Mandalay to find a cool place that's not too expensive for a little late night rondevu before bed. So in we go, it's dark as hell in there, live band with surround sound thumping super loud. At first it was too loud until you sit down and realize the people around having drinks are even louder - which was fine because everyone was having a good ol' time and I'm all for that.

The bf and I sat down at the bar and we were greeted immediately by a cute Irish speaking guy; strong accent but very cool like the one youd hear in a movie. So we get to looking at the menu and then we ordered the mild buffalo style wings (multiple flavors you can choose from ie Guinness style etc) which were priced at $8.95 and the guiness beef stew $15.95. 

While waiting for our food, couple guys were standing behind us (we were sitting at the bar). The guy says to the gal bartender, ""hey I'm here with a friend and hes a beer drinker, me not so much kind of talk so what can you get me that's not so bitter, I like more sweet."" So she goes and grabs two cups and filled them up with new castle and guiness which I thought was cool cause who gives trials of beer? The guy who was ordering thought it was awesome too. Mind you when I came in, I was extremely tired from a trade show I'd attended earlier in the day so I was in no mood but after seeing all that, I was pretty much in the mood now. Shortly thereafter, our wings came in and I was thinking DAMN! I was expecting 5-6 wings, hey we're in Vegas and at the price marked I was surprised, probably 15 wings total. We get to biting and immediately I was like this is mild? it's so good but it's pretty damn spicy - more like atomic wings from wing stop, no complaints it's just a bit spicy I couldn't even finish one. The bf and I ate all the celery to calm the heat but nothing could tame it. Our bartender asked if everything was ok, we told him yeah except we were not expecting the wings to be soo spicy, so he laughs cause the bf's sweating his forehead off haha and he hands over more napkins. He's like yeah man (with his accent) we can change it up for you if you want, bf says no it's good man (dont want to cause too much trouble). We refused anway after a few more attempts - so a waiter comes out and gives us two large cups of milk and some fresh made vanilla ice cream - yum! Then the manager comes up, laughs and says hey were sorry, I heard from my kitchen and the bartender that our mild wings are a bit much, she also recommended we change the wings too but we tell her no. When our tab finally came out, they charged us only the beer. This was totally unexpected because we weren't complaining they were just that cool about everything. The entire crew here has awesome hospitality and their service is on point!

I gave the guys a $15 dollar tip for a 7 dollar guiness beer :) they deserved it. You guys are awesome!!!!",zRmfbwMXJ_CPbc3uOc9eng,6,5,5,zsXupinrQIK6laCXQ20x7A

Excellent food (which is rare in a pub setting.) The care taken in preparing the food we ordered was immediately apparent when we received our Scotch Eggs. Fluffy yolk centers piped back inside the classic battered and fried orbed gems reflect the care of the culinary designer. Served on sturdy aluminum trays too, not plastic baskets. 

From the soda bread to the service to the entertainment I found no faults. Irish butter even  adorns the breads. 

Our service was very efficient too. Runners bring food out immediately, bypassing the server if they are occupied. 

It was a welcome retreat from the overcrowded and overpriced places in its vicinity. The place just feels real and transports the customer to a place where people talk funny and make claims like ""Guinness is not just for breakfast any more.""

Pros: nice Irish bar ambiance. Harp and Guinness on tap (plus some). Friendly barkeep. 
Soccer on TV. 

Cons: the food is not good. In fact, it was a negative experience. 
The barkeep recommended the fish and chips. They were well rated here on yelp, so I went with them. 
IMHO - poor. The chips were Blah. The fish started ok (first, hot bite) and went sharply downhill from there. There was a strip of skin/bone I could not cut - ran down the entire length of fish. Peeling the meat away caused me to loose most of the breading. The fish alone tasted watery - like something frozen, thawed, and left to sit in condensate for hours before going into the pot. Pretty greasy, even for fried fish. 

Note - I got the mashed peas - a $5 side dish, thinking it would be a healthy addition. I could not eat. Tasted like a dirty diaper. And I can eat just about anything. I even hit it with Tabasco but it ruined the Tabasco.

Enter R√≠ R√°.  I wasn't sure what to expect...but to be honest, at the time, I didn't care as I was starving.  Because there was also a wait at the pub, we ended up sitting at the bar.  Go figure.

Oh my, was I pleasantly surprised!  I had the Irish Potato Cakes (ok, I'm an appetizer kind of gal), and they were soooooooo good.  I love potatoes (hence, my obsession with french fries), and the cakes were soft, but not mushy, and had just the right amount of saltiness with the balsamic glaze.  I also had the chips and malt vinegar mayo (yeah, ok, there was a bit of potato overload).  The mayo was de-li-cious!  A nice contrast with the chips and change of pace from ketchup.  I was so stuffed I decided not to have an entree.

The drinks department also did not disappoint.  My friend had some beers and I had a couple of Dark and Stormy's, which I'm not used to seeing on menus that often.  The drinks were good, not too strong.  Best of all, our bartender/server was Irish and fun to chat with.  

I agree that the pub is noisy, but in a good way.  This is not somewhere you'd go to catch up with a long lost friend; it's somewhere you'd go to have fun with a smaller group of fun people.

AT dinner I believe we had five different meals, and everyone was happy.
Really enjoyed the selection of import beers, and the whiskey flights offered came at a very good price. We had good service both times, and also enjoyed the atmosphere and live music, in spite of the 10% tax.

I've been told that there are original irish artifacts through out the restraunt which makes it very vibrant and unique looking. Second, i'd like to point out that they have a ridiculous selection of whiskey! And of course irish beer. The food is excellent. The rueben sandwich is HIGHLY recomended! And also the fish and chips! Their proportions are descent and the overall quality of the food is superb! The service is great! Very friendly staff and very knowledgeable :) which I love! I have yet to try the chocolate chocolate martini (i hear its to die for) but will mosdef be on my list the next time around! I do believe they have local and irish bands play on weekends during the evening so thats definately a plus! And most importantly the atmosphere is awesome! You honestly get a mixed crowd of locals and tourist! 
FYI: they do not have the full menu after 10 or 11pm only certain things on the menu but still a great selection is still available for your late night appetite :) the restraunt is located inside mandalay place at the mandalay bay hotel and casino across from the flip flop shop.

Ordering coffee, juice, omelette and  single pancake. Coffee came in carafe which is always nice. But was presented with a 100% used mug. Literally coffee stains inside and out.

449123,2011-03-24,1,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"I was kinda of skeptical when I attempted this place because 1) it was on the Strip & 2) not many Irish restaurants here in town. Usually I make the trek to McMullan's for my bday since it's the only decent place in town. I decided to try Ri Ra after looking at their menu. I must say that I was impressed.

1) The menu pricing was affordable. Nothing was too outrageous, although dinner for 2 costs us $60. Dang beer!!! At least you get complimentary soda bread and bread while you wait.

2) The food was pretty good. We ordered the beef stew and regular size fish and chips. I would say the fish and chips were pretty tasty however the fish was a huge filet inside of a stick so you have to use a fork. I like eating fish & chips with my hands but eh that might just me. Also the chips had no flavor and tasted a little overcooked for being fresh cut fries. The stew was good in my mind that I slurped that sucker down and used the bread to soop up the remaining sauce. It was beefy and packed with veggies plus the scoop of mash taters. I thought all the flavors were balanced evenly.

We arrived around 7:30 and were seated within 5 minutes. The layout and design of the place is quite interesting. It's pretty dark in the front until you walk to the back where most of the dining is. It's made to resemble an pub in Ireland but what do I know I have never been to Ireland! I do know that the management team is actually from Ireland so it was pretty interesting to see actual Irish folks tending to this place and trying to make it authentic. Around 8 pm they have a live band that performs every night. Business was pretty steady while we were there but I will comment that the food wait was quite long. I think we waited almost 25 minutes for our food. At times the waitress did seem a little flustered especially when they brought out the incorrect order of chicken tenders. Service just seemed slow but they had only been opening for a week so we shall see....

However, it is a great atmosphere to hang out and have some good 'ole Irish beer and listen to music. I would totally try this place again because overall the food was pretty decent and made me curious enough to come back and try the Dubliner burger for the true Irish experience.",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,3,2,4,km6NYbuTVtZTEK9XY5yubQ

Drinks: pretty good selection, but then again this is Vegas. It'd be a crime for a full service restaurant inside a major hotel to not have a good drinks list.

Food: 
- We had the Sweet Potato Tater Tots to start. This is so good, I want some again just thinking about it. And I had it over two months ago!
- I felt like eating something 'light but hearty'. Yeah, I can have weird ideas sometimes. So I had the Seafood Stew, and it hit the spot. Fresh chunks of seafood and vegetables in tasty broth. Mmmm. 
- The BF had the Irish Stew (it's lamb) and I'm told it's good. That's all I can say since it disappeared before I remembered to ask for a bite to try.

Service was excellent. Our waiter was very personable, I'm even sorry I forgot his name (It's not him; it's me. I'm terrible with names). We told him of the BF's 'no dairy' requirement, and he made sure that he knew 100% whether our dishes safe. He even remembered that he doesn't need butter with his bread, and that there's nothing in the dessert menu we'd really be interested in (well, other than drinks). You'd be surprised how often servers continue to put butter in front of him or offer creamy desserts even after being told of his allergy. It's not much, but it's attention to details like this that make us want to tip our server more. It makes us think that the server remembers as as individuals, not table numbers. Which is why I feel bad about forgetting his name. :P

Price is very reasonable, especially when you consider its location. It's the kind of prices I'd expect to pay if I were outside of  the Strip (note, SoCal ain't cheap, but cheaper than the Strip).",6A-ZTcSEe6Zh005zWs38Zg,0,0,5,sOsjSF1mK8rXHbgKp9KfzQ

Headed over there on our first day because there was an ad in our room for happy hour - buy a pint of Guiness, get a free shot of whiskey!  

Unfortunately, when we asked for the happy hour special, the waitress wasn't aware of it.  We wound up talking to the manager, who said we had to have a coupon (apparently coupons were given to guests of other hotels, like the Luxor), and then said we must have been mistaken, and finally basically called us liars.  We asked if she would honor it if we went and got the ad, she agreed, so we made the trek back to the room, got the ad, and returned.  She did honor it, but we received no apology, no discount for our trouble, nothing.  We had planned on sticking around and having a few other beers, and some grub, but decided to just drink our Guiness and whiskey and leave.

The whiskey, Feckin, was, incidentally very good.  And, although it is in the ""mall"" between MB and Luxor, it had a decent atmosphere inside.

Sadly, it failed on several counts and was- at least the time I visited - another example of some places on the Strip that send out the vibe, ""We cater to tourists and don't necessarily expect to see you again, awesome experience or not.""

I was there with a party of three and two of us had been to other Ri Ra pubs. So we were very much looking forward to a high level of service, Irish authenticity and awesome food. We got the authenticity (Irish accents, Gaelic menu items and Guinness served at just the right temperature) but the other two aspects were lacking. 

To service: We waited for 15-20 minutes (in a 1/2-full restaurant on a Sunday afternoon, so not really busy) to get our order taken and then some 15 minutes thereafter were told that one of our entrees was out and we'd need to choose another. So 40 minutes in, we received the food (in fairness and to the server's credit we were not charged for the replacement entree.) But until the food came, other wait staff and our own waiter rushed past, ignoring eye contact and giving us the feeling that they'd get to us eventually.

To food: The quality was not up to the standards of other Ri Ra locations- in terms of presentation and also in ingredients- and the portion size was also smaller than what I knew from other locations. Also, because of the wait for the one entree, the other two were served lukewarm, i.e. it was clear they'd been prepared and sat while the other entree was cooked later. 

There are plenty of good Ri Ra's across this great land and several good Irish Pubs on the Strip, but for now, the Ri Ra in Vegas isn't on our list for a return visit for a while.",43nXxZLfX8nPUNzQlPpUeA,1,0,2,tu9M8nMJ0D3yMlmcFQpHXw

Our server, Rustin was super helpful and friendly, as was everyone else who stopped by to see how we were doing. I'm not sure if high tea is a newer service they're offering or if people don't get it often but we had quite a few different people come up and ask us how we were liking it, which was nice.

In terms of the food/tea itself, the thing that threw me off the most were the portion sizes of the sandwiches, which when compared to other places I've seen were surprisingly large; we were originally planning on doing tea and a brunch later on, but ended up scrapping the brunch altogether because we were so full from the sandwiches, pastries, and scones. I have no idea if they make the pastries in-house or not, but the scones were great, and they do make their own Irish soda bread which was lovely as well. And considering the price is at a comfortable $22 per person, it was probably one of our more comfortably affordable meals as well.

Decently sized tea selection, and the decor was a rather amusing contrast given the fact that we were in the backroom of a pub decorated with old knick-nacks, but sitting at a table with a white table cloth and a cute mismatched tea set. If I ever visit Vegas again I definitely think I'd be stopping by for a return visit.",nU12-EgOlhsoWjZ5hpK21Q,0,0,5,41KuOD4C7c3w1rTeC79zlw

946415,2012-06-06,0,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"Came here for lunch on a Sunday with 10 other rowdy bros of mine. It's a tad small but it is quite accomodating and has a very quaint and charming Irish pub feel to it. What makes it even better is that as we walked in, we walked past a table of 5 Irish guys ranting and drinking beers. The presence of real Irish people? Ooooh this place has gotta be legit!

Ordered the bistro chicken sandwich - made with sun-dried potato pesto, mayo, garden rocket, piquant peppers, smoked provolone, all served on grilled focaccia. MMM soo good! And the portions were surprisingly large for a dish that demanded $11.95, especially in Las Vegas!

I also ordred a side of sweet potato tots but those ended up being less than mediocre. Surprisingly moist and soggy rather than crisp. So I would skip that and go with the mashed potatoes or simply chipper chips (fries). 

The dish also came with a side of a sauce called malted vinegar mayo which tastes exactly how it sounds. I was never a fan of malted vinegar but some of my buddies enjoyed pouring it all over their sandwiches. It's certainly interesting, not for me, not for everyone, but it's definitely got its niche! =)

So yeah, if you're ever in the vicinity of Mandalay Bay and you're looking for something relatively cheap that's not fast food, I'd definitely give Ri Ra a recommendation as it will probably give you the most bang for your buck! Also, the food is pretty bomb too!",YwAbuujxLASmH4jn6iZBYQ,1,0,4,5bXwuGi3DTFQIUph-nrtxw

A great spot to start your night off or to take a break from power shopping at Mandalay Place, Ri Ra embodies everything a great Irish bar should be. The best part is they're not lazy about their bar food. The menu is unassuming and reasonably priced (keep in mind it IS on the strip, so don't expect $2.50 beers and $4.99 chicken fingers) and boy was I glad I tried some unique stuff suggested by some regulars in our group. 

Baked goat cheese. Something about it just seems weird to me, so it's not something I seek out on menus. But I advise you to do so. So warm and tasty and it comes with fun little toppings to slap on the toasty bread. Great for sharing over some beers, of which they have plenty of. I love the Shandy, light and refreshing and not too filling. Moving on to Malt Vinegar Mayo sauce with fries. That is a real thing and it is amazing. At first I was like, hmm vinegar and mayo? Sounds dangerous. Well the only danger is you choking because you're hoovering this into your face hole. So good and they give you a good portion when ordered as a side. The sandwiches are massive and look tasty. 

Service is great, I've never had a bad experience. Bonus points for scoring a seat where the server is from Ireland...I swear something about the accent makes the food taste better here. The d√©cor is very rich and authentic looking. As a matter of fact some pieces of the bar are actually imported from Ireland, thought that was a fun fact. Take a walk around as each room has a different feel to it.

The first beer we were served was flat. Seriously, the carbonation or whatever had run out, not an auspicious start!  
Ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer, which was ok.  Ordered the fish and chips (the smaller size EASILY satisfied both the wife and myself, no arguing that the portion size is generous).  The fish was tasty, the fries a bit greasy, but hey, this is pub fare after all.  
So food, not bad.  Not fantastic, but par for the course.
It was the ""entertainment"" that soured our evening.   There was some kind of singing duo up on the stage at the far end of the establishment.  When we were seated, we asked to be as far from the ""band"" as possible, which brought critical looks from our hostess.  Turns out we weren't nearly far enough away.  These two guys singing were horrible.  My wife and I are both musicians, we know what wrong notes sound like, and we heard PLENTY of them.

A friend told me this before I showed up with four other friends to catch a bite before the Duran Duran show, and it was a lifesaver! No one else knew it, and it's not advertised, so if you are a Las Vegan and you're at Mandalay Bay on a Friday, give this place a try.

We sat in a cutely decorated room in the back. Our waitress was from Ireland (I have a feeling most of them are), and she was both charming and accommodating. Each of the girls had a drink or two, and between the five of us, we hit about everything on the menu: potato cakes, curry (on chips), reuben sandwich, chicken sandwich, pub burger, and fish and chips. I sampled the curry (pretty darn good) and chose a chopped salad for my entree. It was a huge portion and a great deal for the price (especially when you consider that it was almost half off), even though they added chopped chicken, which I didn't request. (No biggie; it probably made the salad more complete, although it was loaded with bacon and avocado as well.)

Had a grapefruit IPA and my first-ever Smithwick's (which I learned is pronounced ""SMID-dicks""). Deelish! And the food was good, too. A bit pricey without the discount, but keeping that Friday deal in mind, I may be back, concert or not.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,3,0,4,4oPt3v4HNBG0FjaTidtbMg

We sat down in the front to avoid the sad Irish band playing in the back, and had to go to the bar to request table service. We were starving so we ordered the curry and chips to start, both of which I believe may have been microwaved, but decent enough for me to eat in my ravenous state.

I have not seen a burger this sad since I left elementary school, a lukewarm brown patty sitting between two pieces of dry bread. My poor, hungry, boyfriend didn't eat it, and we left. 

Also I ordered a Guinness and Smithwicks, and the waitress brought me one of each. When I acted surprised to have gotten two beers, she told me I should have ordered a ""blacksmith,"" and walked away, mind you I never saw a drink menu. Weird. I drank both. YUM.

Then it was time to decide what was going to happen late night. Turns out these two girls are both teachers 28 and 31. The 31 year old asked me to walk her back, where she slammed the door in my face #strikeout. As I am walking back to Lyle and my room, i open the door and see Lyle making out with the 28 year old the hallway buffet. I just laughed went to bed, my flight was at 8 am. When I go to leave (3 hours later) Lyle is playing blackjack and is up $500. Gotta love Vegas!",7jrG_wNaiipQJLTta9_pdA,0,0,5,hiMafF1ovq2rkXa7imrbsw

1368444,2014-08-13,0,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"When my husband (then fiance) and I were planning our out-of-state wedding in Las Vegas, I have to admit I was nervous. I got several quotes from various casinos, restaurants on the strip, and restaurants off the strip and I was pleasantly surprised to stumble upon RiRa while perusing the Mandalay instill among their team, affordable prices (we held a lunch wedding reception in the Parlour Room for 55 people and it was beyond fantastic), flexibility, and delicious food, there's not much else to love!! 

When I was on the Mandalay Bay website. I was immediately drawn in by the Pub Lunch, but it's not only the price that you'll love about RiRa. It's more like what's not to love about RiRa? Aside from the amazing customer service that Scott and Paula exhibit, they worked tirelessly to ensure that our special event unfolded just as my husband and I desired; they communicated clearly and within 24 hours - they answered their phones! I can't tell you how many venues didn't even respond to our emails, let alone in a timely manner! This was never the case at RiRa. 

Paula's impeccable attention to detail went above and beyond what we had expected. She and her team even went as far as to set up and decorate our reception room so we didn't have to worry about it! I mean, who does that?? That's BRILLIANT customer service. Her concern was that we didn't have to worry about a single thing on our Big Day. 

We had our cake delivery scheduled and Paula even offered to pick it up, since the bakery was actually in the Mandalay Bay lobby (our bakery forgot to mention this and Paula tried to help us out here); she said she could just take a quick walk over and get it so we didn't have to pay the delivery fee.

Everything from the decorations, lighting, music, microphone available, food, service, etc. was amazing. We feel like RiRa is now a part of our Las Vegas tradition and so every time we celebrate there, we'll be sure to come in and feast on the delicious salmon, potato and leek soup, and corned beef!

If you're planning a wedding, look no further - seriously. You will not be disappointed - the venue is beautiful and a photographer's dream. If you're planning a party, look no further! If you just want a delicious meal or ice cold beer, look no further. Scott, Paula, and RiRa's staff are so on top of their game - anyone who chooses not to stop by, is truly missing out!",nZ_wvT8wzZ2HVdwYVwFrIQ,2,1,5,r-GXqbr-ZZDZKWemenvRVw

To eat we had the meatloaf burger, which was pretty good, and the smoked salmon club, which was great, but the story line to this place is 150 or so whiskey bottles hanging around the shelves and cabinets.

From $650 a shot down to $8, they have pretty much everything.  They have a great catalog at the bar detailing what they have available, and that alone was great to enjoy.  Wondered if I could somehow get it out of there, but thought better of it.  :-)

The only thing that kept it from five stars, and this probably sounds petty, most of the bartenders had NO idea about the whiskies.  In a bar like this, with that as one of their points of pride, seems like they'd give the staff some training beyond ""here's the book"", but it's not like that'll keep me from going back next time we're in Vegas.",GYXv4lNs5ul1Ka96pLi5Qw,0,0,4,_4JI6jfa_tWDAQUQMCHviQ

I was nervous planning everything because we are from out of state and had never been to Vegas.  I had to look at reviews to chose everything from the chapel to the hotel to our reception dinner.  We needed something to fit our budget, but that would be close or within Mandalay Bay for our guests.  Ri Ra's had amazing food at a reasonable price!!!  

Paula worked with me to organize our event and plan a menu that would fit our guests and budget.  We picked the options of fish and chips, salmon, and the roast pork for our guests to chose from.  Our guests also got to chose their salad and pick from two desserts.  Paula created our ""own"" menu for our guests.  The food was amazing!!  We were also able to allow guests to order drinks just within a certain price range, so that things wouldn't get out of control.  We had some drinkers with us!  We had compliments from everyone on picking a great place.  

They put dividers up to block off our section of the restaurant.  I wasn't sure if this would be private enough, but it was perfect.  The atmosphere was wonderful and our servers were great!  Everyone was friendly and we loved having lots of different beer for our guests to chose from.  They have a band every night, and I was also worried it might be too loud, but we were stationed in the back of the deep restaurant and could just hear it in the background.  This worked out very nicely for us.  It would be fun to be in the front with a few friends and hear the loud music, but for us being in the back was perfect.  

I would recommend Ri Ra's to anyone have a large dinner or just a dinner for two.  They were amazing at working with us and answering all of my questions as a bride coming from out of town!

NOT SO GOOD...the ruben does not look like the first picture, but rather the second (the one I took). The house brined corned beef was chewy, a little oily, but flavorful. The sauerkraut and 'thousand island' dressing was super BLAND, could hardly taste those ingredients and didn't even know there was cheese on it. 

The chicken and date salad WASN'T GOOD. The 'white balsamic vinegar' was WAY TOO STRONG and completely overpowered the whole salad. I put that in quotes because I'm pretty sure it was red wine or white wine vinegar because balsamic has a sweeter taste.

The only reason I would give this restaurant 3 stars is for two reasons.  FIRST,  the deviled scotch egg was AMAZING!! not sure how they got that perfect crust to stick to the hard boiled egg. SECOND, the service was GREAT!

Our server, Natasha, was friendly and gave great recommendations/descriptions on the food and Irish culture. 

I had the dubliner burger and it was perfect. Nice and juicy with just the right amount of cheese to add to the flavor of the meat without overpowering it.

I was with a group and they had the fish and chips. Which they said reminded them of the fish and chips you get in Europe.

The food was just ok.  The boyfriend got the shepherd's pie and it was ok.  I tried the Kilbeggan Salmon and it was pretty delicious.  Appetizers were crab cakes and onion rings.  The crab cakes themselves were just alright, but the sauce that they put on them was awesome!  I really liked the onion rings - the were the tiny, thin cut onions and were super tasty.

I left feeling full, content, replete, and well-rested. If that isn't a successful meal, I don't know what is.

I've been to a fair few ""Irish pubs"" before. I put that in quotes because usually, the most Irish thing about them is maybe their name, and the fact that they have Guinness and Harp on draft. 

Not so, here! From the genuine warmth and hospitality the servers show, to the deliciousness of the pub grub, to the really decent drinks -- I was really, really pleased. 

Foodwise, I had the Dubliner Burger and a side of chips with Irish curry sauce. That lamb burger...oh man, I hadn't expected to find something that good as my first meal. I hadn't. Yeah, I was crazy hungry, but I don't think it was just the hunger talking. That was a seriously tasty burger. 

As for the curry sauce...I'm a big curry fan in general. I love all different types of curry, including those milder ones that hail from the UK. There's a place for them all, I say. Especially on chips, and in the mayo on my Dubliner Burger.

1795266,2015-06-04,8,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"Having spent some time in Dublin, and in several ""traditional"" Irish pubs;  This place is probably about 60-70% close in authenticity.  The realism, of the bar and overall look and feel almost makes you feel like you really are in Ireland.  It's just the simple fact that you know you're in Vegas, and the newness of it simply out-weighs hanging out at an old bar that generations of people have relaxed in.  

Anyways, here's what I ordered, and why I loved this pub:
~ Deviled Scotch Eggs:  These were 4 pieces of breaded deviled eggs that were creamy and crunchy.  The yolk mix was slightly different than your mustard tasting center.  They call their center a creamy yolk mousse.  Truly a different starter choice.
~ Dubliner Burger:  A ground lamb patty with a rosemary aroma.  Now this was a super juicy burger, combined with goat cheese, grilled red onion, and a curry aioli... Man I'm gettin' hungry just thinking about it.  The burger was nice and beefy, and the bun nice and soft.
~ Fish 'n' Chips (small):  Now, the cod was cooked just right, soft and steamy.  The chips were also nice and meaty for fries.  The only thing is, this was not a Dublin sized cod in my opinion.  I regretfully wish I ordered the large.  I should've known better.  

All about service:
~ I'm so glad we sat a the bar.  Amanda, our server-bartender did a great job in keeping us company.  She shared some of her favorites from the menu, and made sure our water glasses were filled.  I asked for a Guinness, and she poured it pretty fast.  A ""no no"" in the process, so minus one star.  Yes, I was critiquing, haha!

Atmosphere:
~ As I had mentioned above, the set up was nice only you won't get that Irish feel.  The feeling of knowing you're in a pub that's 150+ years old.  You'll have an American watery Guinness, which was what I expected.  As nothing beats a Guinness made from the waters of Ireland.  A mix of people/tourist.  I mean, for the first time, I had wished there were more drunks singing along and mingling.  Oh well, no biggie, but I definitely a good time hanging out here!  

Overall:

Went here for lunch, came back from dinner the same day, then dined the next day for breakfast! Yes, sadly but with pleasure dined for breakfast,lunch and dinner. We even tried a fourth time but the line was unbearable 

I don't remember what I had, cuz most of the time I was drinking lik a cliche Irishman. I do remember that two of the three times we ate there was an Irish accent asking me if I wanted another pint. ""yes.""  Silly questions.

If i think hard, I can conjure from my memory  my pre-gaming and carbo loading for the Vegas half-marathon with a a Guinness and fish and chips.   

I was upset that I got the fish and chips because they were just unbeatable, bar none. I know that I may never have such an euphoric and exceptional moment of tasting drunk food again... it elicits nightmares. I am getting help.

Though I did not have the distinction of ordering food, I naturally had a drink instead.  A Guinness.....or two, to some degree of certainty.  At this point I can't remember clearly, I only recall having a good time.  The band performing that night was engaging, and the lively music only encouraged the audience to exchange their seats for a place on the dance floor.

Burger was cooked to perfection (I only eat them well done) and seemed to be just as good as Burger bar next door. My buddy ordered the fish and chips and proclaimed them to be the best ever. They included a free salad also. Our appetizer was an unusual one called Baked Goat Cheese. Basically a small bowl of melted and baked goat cheese with piles of chopped walnuts and two other Irish things you throw on some toasted flat bread. It's decent, but you don't need to order it and also skip the onion rings, which were just greasy onion strings. The fries were much better.

Publicans Reuben Sandwich ($13.95) - tons and tons of brisket. So delicious, but be prepared for a serious sandwich. Would prefer if they had a bread that could hold up the sandwich a bit better. 

Shepard's Pie ($15.95) - the lamb was a bit salty. Nothing memorable.

Fish & Chips - very generous portion. Got the regular at $14.95, though there's a larger size too. Good, but nothing memorable.

Decent selection of brews, at the time they were offering a special of red beer mixed with lemonade (I think that was the combo). Delicious.

- Well-stocked whiskey list -- Check. 
(carrying the spectrum from Powers to smoky 30 yr scotches)
- Several Irish beers on draft -- Check. 
(Harp, Kilkenny, Guinness, Smithwick's, Murphy's and more in bottles -- throw in some craft American beers in the mix as well for the win)
- Long hardwood bar -- Check.
(a bar patron needs some polished heft under the elbow at an Irish pub to sit for awhile)
- Live Irish music -- Check.
(consistently hosting excellent bands with a fiddle and a crooner singing out Irish ballads.  Other folks have suggested the music can be a little loud, but the bar is laid out with various rooms, so there's plenty of nooks to sit in and chat while the music is in the background)
- Televisions with rugby, soccer and hurling -- Check.
(Irishmen need their sports on a green pitch)
- Fried foods and classic pub fare -- Check.
(Their fish and chips is perfect and massive.  Thick cut fries and a whole cod battered and fried -- so much fish that you may need to split it)

Beyond that, it's comfy.  It's welcoming.  The bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly.  And for the locals, they offer a 40% off food special on Fridays.

European football on the television, irish-speaking employees (most of whom have work visas) provide authenticity.  But the food is where it's at!

2045503,2013-04-29,1,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"First the greatest thing about Ri Ra: they offer 40% off on food, every Friday, for locals. And you only need to show one local I.D., so its possible to take friends there with you. That being said, our first visit there as locals [we had stopped in for a drink once before, as visitors to Vegas] was a mixed experience. 
The atmosphere is quite pleasant, it feels like a real Irish pub once you get into it from the ""mall"" that houses it. Not surprising, since it was brought over from Ireland. And they play lovely Irish music, but when we went (early evening) it was at a level that still allowed us to talk. And our waitress, also an import from Ireland, couldn't have been nicer.
My husband ordered the chicken curry, along with a flight of Irish beers. I had the fish and chips, along with an Irish hard cider. The beverages are filled all the way to the rims. They were at the temperature and level of carbonation (not overdone, on either) that we expect in a pub that knows its business. My husband loved his curry, and I thought the fish was the best I'd ever had: a huge moist filet with thin shattery crust. And the remoulade served with it was delicious...I'd put that on everything! The ""chips"" (fries) weren't as crispy as Americans are used to, but we've found that in many other countries they are used as a base for the main entree, not as a side. So that seemed authentic. Even the brown bread served with the meal was tasty...it reminded me of the brown bread my mom used to bake in cans, for Sunday evening dinners! (And served with real Irish butter.)
Now, the reason I took off a star. The dessert was abysmal. They were out of creme brulee (not Irish, but pretty ubiquitous in Vegas). So we ordered the special: strawberry trifle. What we were expecting was the standard trifle in a glass bowl, with liquor-infused cake, custard/pudding, and berries layered, with whipped cream on top. What we got was a couple slices of store-bought pound cake on a plate, each topped with one sliced strawberry, which were almost inedible because they were under-ripe and not sweetened. And a small dollop of whipped cream.
Don't know if they didn't have the ""real"" trifle prepped, and just hurried to make up a substitute; or if this pub which tries to be authentic in most other ways just doesn't know what a real trifle is. Whatever...it left us with a bad ending. 
Like any Vegas dining/drinking spot, you never know who or what is going to sashay through the door, so its a great place to people watch. Just go someplace else to get dessert.",0DRa4GSTSml7vpwAFfRXjQ,2,1,4,wGzDlyNKl5HpK82rO9iujQ

I'm a bit of a Plastic Paddy. Love me all things Irish and Pubs in particular. 

I literally stumbled into this place the first time several years ago. It was a dismal Saturday at the casino tables, and a friend (from Limerick, Ireland) and I were just walking around so we weren't losing more money. We saw the sign that read: Full Irish Breakfast, served all day. 

We were in. 

That day, it was just what the doctor ordered. Full Irish for both of us, and a side of fries to split (with curry sauce on the side). 

Waitress from Ireland chatted w/ my friend, and we drank a pint waiting for the food. Great atmostphere, very authentic - - well, as authentic as you can get in a ""mall"" in a Casino in Vegas. it is MUCH bigger than it looks from the outside/storefront. 

Anyway, the food was perfect, and brought our spirits back to 100%. GREAT FRIES, great full Irish. (with beans and tomato and mushrooms, b/w pudding, the works).

I spent my 40th birthday celebration there with friends, and we looked through their iPad app menu of whiskey - - QUITE the impressive selection, ranging in price from ~$5 a shot to ~$800. Great servers, great vibe, great food, great drinks. Everyone has loved everything here:

Recommend:
1. Fish and Chips - - Perfectly fried piece of fish and those great fries
2. Avacado Toast (appetizer): Sounds strange but it's great. Toast w/ Avocado and red onion, balsamic and goat cheese.
3. Corned beef anything: the cabbage, the potatoes and the meat are spectacular
4. Full Irish Breakfast
5. Deviled Scotch Eggs
6. Irish Curry - super flavorful and perfect portions - - do the half rice half fries. :) 

Also have done their breakfast - - non-full irish version - - and it's also really great. Corned beef hash and poached eggs, rocked. 

Having just returned from Ireland a few weeks ago and being able to compare - - I think this place does an amazing job given what it is - - the aforementioned casino mall pub - - and I will be back.",VC97ZH1pnuQREwJxG1taRw,2,1,5,kyidoDQ1cswYgz-UFh0mgg

We started with the sausage rolls, which were outstanding.  The pastry was just like my grandmother used to make.  For our mains I had the lamb sandwich and the husband had the fish and chips.  My lamb was mostly tasty, but there was one piece in there that was thick and really, really tough, which made it hard to enjoy.  The husband said the fish and chips were fine - the fish came out as one huge single filet, as opposed to being cut up in pieces.  I can appreciate why they serve it in just one piece, but did make it a bit unwieldy to eat.

Sadly enough, the drinks were what let the experience down for us.  The husband had the Lagunitas IPA (I know, you're supposed to go for Irish beer.  But the husband doesn't like Irish beer) and it was flat.  I ordered their pink lemonade (Citron, chambord and pink lemonade) which was quite nice, but when I was less than a quarter of the way through my drink, I picked up my glass to take a sip and the bottom dropped out of the glass, splashing my drink and glass bits all over the table and me.  The staff (and neighbouring patrons) helped me wipe most of liquid off me and moved us to another table while the manager got me a new drink.  However, we got a quick apology and nothing more.  We didn't ask for anything, but we've been comped at least for a drink when anything similar has happened to us at other places.  A bit disappointing for customer service.",884jblxG71321Z6-pCTwsw,0,0,3,5t6F7KgdyNwmgrddPnHMtg

Decided to take the family out to dinner there on a Friday evening - they give Las Vegas locals a discount on Fridays.  We had a party of six (automatic 25% gratuity added on for that), and our waiter was not the most engaging person.  I ordered the chicken wings (volcano), and was informed by the waiter that they would be too hot for me and basically inedible.  I had to fight with him to get the volcano wings - which as it turns out weren't that hot.  The rest of the meal was good and everyone enjoyed their meals for the most part.  The beer was great of course and our service was a tad slower than I'm used to.  As we prepared to pay the bill we informed the waiter that we were locals asking for the offered discount - normally I would expect the person paying to be the one showing the identification as proof of residency but everyone in the group had to show ID.  My problem is I have a underage child that has no ID and I took an out of town friend - full price for both.  I know it's a casino restaurant that would probably prefer tourist to locals, but I like supporting my community businesses.  --Disappointed but not surprised",jAb_qGYImhclSlFvBwDLJA,0,0,2,itlaMg6RteW9KQsG1gkrmQ

Being in Ireland last year, it really felt like we took a step back there! Will definitely come back to try the food, beer and hopefully catch a live band.

If you are looking for a fun afternoon tea experience, this is it! The tea sandwiches were large size and yummy! We had cucumber and egg salad. The tray also included scones and dessert. The tea was delicious! They also serve  Ireland's Barry's Tea.

Our servers were so nice and helpful! They checked on us just enough times, making sure they didn't interrupt too much as they knew we were girlfriends catching up! They poured our tea, went over our treats and were just so friendly!

Price was reasonable at $24, where Others on strip are 35 or 45.  Overall just a great experience! Can't wait to to go back, thinking of having a birthday there in their separate room!",Ew2y3jL11uooMQxSwwL6tw,5,1,4,cpStguM6j0-BwG2lVjy0PQ

I've never been to Ireland but I felt like it was an authentic pub. 

We were a big group and they were extremely accommodating with the bill. Their service was consistent and the waiter was very friendly and helpful. I couldn't decide what to get since there were a few options on the menu that I was deciding between, and he helped me out.

I KNOW the fish and chips are the hit here (and they did look really good!), but I'm not a huge fish and chips fan, so I went with the veggie burger because it was calling my name. It was so tasty! The patty was delicious itself; cooked leaving a soft inside and a crunchy outside. I got a brioche bun instead of the one it normally came with and I was happy with that sub. The goat cheese was mellow but flavorful, and I got the curry fries on the side (recommended by my waiter) that were unique and yummy.

2318844,2013-03-12,3,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"Let me preface this review by saying that I KNOW MY IRISH BARS AND FOOD. I was born and raised in that magical country and I frequently return for lengthy visits. Ireland is my favorite place in the world. 

And now, Ri Ra is my favorite Irish pub in the world that exists outside of Ireland. It is authentic and decorated perfectly. The rich, dark wood and the paintings and the lighting and even the Irish accents of some of the servers could not be more perfect. Walking into Ri Ra is like walking into one of the local Temple Bar watering holes in Dublin. 

Ri Ra has an absolutely astounding selection of beer and cider - the best of what Ireland and England have to offer and in my opinion, more of a selection than any other Irish pub in town. (HELLO! MAGNERS/BULMERS ON DRAFT!!!) Also, they've got a great whiskey list and flight samples that rival even the Freakin Frog's attic! 

We ordered the fish and chips to share and the sausage rolls as an appetizer. Sausage rolls are one of my favorite comfort foods, so I was really hoping Ri Ra came through with this one. And, THEY DID. The sausage rolls were perfect and tasty and crunchy yet soft - probably the best I have ever had. When our fish and chips came out, I knew I was in love before I even took the first bite because I could tell that these were freshly cut potatoes and a really great cut of fish - HUGE too. 

Without a doubt in my mind, Ri Ra has the best fish and chips in Vegas - definitely the best I have had outside of Ireland. 

They've also got a pretty awesome ""late night chipper"" menu that I can't wait to check out. If you visit the bar for a drink, they've got all the bar snacks you'd find in Ireland - Tayto or King crisps, chocolate, etc. You name it! 

This place is amazing. Although it might be a bit pricey, you get what you pay for in terms of quality and service! If this bar was closer to my house and not located on the strip, I'd probably never leave.",1pqyIOcWh-EEHOR9AHUkWA,10,7,5,RBjNLt_4_4hdUxF6yOk-OA

Thus far, we've had the irish sausages wrapped in phyllo dough as an appetizer with a spicy brown mustard - To Die For!   I've had the Focaccia Chicken Sandwich w/ peppers, rocket....Fabulous!  The Kilcooly which is Boar's head turkey, irish cheddar, irish bacon, and a very tasty schmear - Awesome!  Irish Mac and Cheese was the 3rd entree I've tried - my fave!  You can have it plain w/ the bread crumbs toasted on top, or add shrimp or chicken. I had it w/ chicken. It's quite small, but definitely enough for one person.  My friends last night all ordered either the small size fish and chips and the Guiness Beef Stew. There were no leftovers.  :)     The small size fish and chips is about 10-12oz, while the large portion is about 14-18 oz.  The ""chips"" are hand cut and really good!

Ri Ra is a cozy Irish Pub that serves good food, beer, and custom cocktails. They also host, late night, live music. For breakfast, I like the Irish Benedict, for lunch & dinner, I like their Fish & Chips, Bangers & Mash, or an order of their Shepherd's Pie or Guinness Stew. They stay open until 3AM.

Vegas has quite a few good Irish Pubs (McMullens and the Nine Fine Irishmen are my other favorites) but I find myself coming back here often because I like the ambiance and location.

He had walked by our table full of dirty dishes at least 3 times and did not remove any. We had gotten no refills on our water for the length of our meal, either.

Visit 1 - We came into Vegas post lunchtime Sunday, and we were looking for some lunch. Decided to come back to old faithful RiRa for sausage rolls to start and fish & chips to share. We got the sausage rolls & even though they tasted like they could've been a hair under fresh, they still were dee-lish and melted in our mouths with that amazing mustard sauce. Then the fish & chips came, and where the fish was light & flaky with a beautifully crispy batter, the fries were soggy & stale, and the vinegar tasted almost watered down. We asked for proper chips, and they obliged, but with a portion 1/3 the size. We balked and management was kind enough to return with a massive portion of fresh, crispy, delicious fries AND knock $5 off the bill for our trouble. The waiter was kind & semi helpful, if not for him being totally forgetful about a few things, he would have been aces. 

Visit 2 - Unwittingly, we ended up back the same day for a late, late dinner after 9:30pm fireworks on the strip and s nap in the room. Amy was our server, fresh from Ireland, and was fantastic, sweet, and chatty but authentically as helpful as could be. We ordered Guinness Beef Stew, to DIE for, and a Guinness burger, and topped it with a pint of Guinness Stout. Well the Stout was the best tasting, best pour I've ever had on a beer, by far. The stew was best I've had next to my wife's amazing recipe, and the burger was perfectly delicious, if not totally outperformed by the stew. The only problem I had with the stew was that it ran out, so I quickly ordered another Stout to make up for it. Amy was great. Music by the Black Dubliners was on point, and food & brew were home runs. We'll be back for more before we leave!!",M9x88cnUvrS6hEe1VwgKAQ,0,0,5,JrWiO15EdgCHSinr1G63dQ

The first thing that jumped out at me was the fun and festive atmosphere. It has it's entrance right from the Mandalay hotel, and the Guinness store is right next door, which is cool. The restaurant has a nice, intimate feel, and you instantly feel comfortable here. I love the way the restaurant is appointed, and it has an intimate feel that is not ""corporate"" in style. 

They always seem to have great live entertainment here, and if you're looking for Irish music and entertainment, this is the place to come.

First off, they pour a great Guinness. Pouring a Guinness is an art, half of the experience is the velvety creamy head on top and if that is not done right the whole beer is off. Second the food is amazing. This is not straight out of the microwave pub/tavern food, the meals here are serious. My husband and I shared the Kings cut prime rib, it was the biggest cut of rare meat I have ever been served, and it was so tender I was able cut it with a butter knife. It was absolutely decedent. Also, the fish and chips was amazing. Not a pile of fish sticks but a lightly battered and gently fried fillet of premium fish, it was delicious. The bartenders we met were actually from Ireland so the conversation was interesting and they often have live music.

2523547,2012-08-22,1,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"A friend was in town from LA & staying at The Luxor and suggested we meet at Mandalay Place Mall, which is located upstairs in between the Luxor & Mandalay Bay Hotels. The dining options, as per my friend, were Burgers or a an Irish Pub - Ri Ra.

I admit that at the time, BOTH these options sounded very ""touristy"" being located between two MGM owned Hotels. I immediatly went here to Yelp to get some idea of what was ""what"" and was amazed to see there was not one bad thing that was said about the place. This had me even more interested and I even learned that the Pub was an Authentic Irish Pub that had been disassembled & shipped to Las Vegas. As you can see, The Yelp site has 122 photos of the Pub including entrees, decor and the likes and this was very helpful in making the choice between Irish Pub & Burgers.

To be honest, Burgers had the back seat from the start and is why I went to Ri Ra's Yelp page first. I can make Burgers at home. So basically with my mind already made up, I went to the Official web page and it was even more helpful and included a full menu. It was then that I had to fight between the choices of ordering the Shepards Pie, a Rueben Sandwich or The Fish-n-Chips....descions, descions.

And so it was agreed upon that we'd meet at 9pm for dinner on a Tuesday. Upon arriving it was a little tricky finding the entrance but I managed to do so by walking towards the huge lit ""Mandalay Place Valet"" sign and I quickly found the entrance & walked up the stairs vice taking the escalator (Excersice = Do it!!). Ri Ra is just around the corner to the right of the escalators as if you were going to Mandalay Bay. There was a hostess already assisting another party, so thinking that my friend might already be seated I walked in to have a look.

 When you walk in past the hostess you enter a small room wt a bar that basically extends the lenght of the Pub and this room opens up into 3 bigger rooms that are dimmly lit and seat diners at tables and booths. In the second Room there was a 2 person acoustic band playing and I made my way past them to the very back and did not see my friend and called her and told her were I was. As I waited at the empty deserted back bar sipping a drink I had brought in with me and watching some soccer match on the flat screen TV, I was eventually approached by a member of the Staff that asked me if I needed anything to which I responded that I was just waiting on someone.

 For a Tuesday night the place was half full and lively. I can imagine on the weekends there might be a wait to get a table. As my friend arrived, this was not the case and while at the bar as we discussed where we were going to sit, we were approached by a waiter who told us we could pick wherever we wanted & we quickly took a booth table by the wall that was right in front of us.

Everything, as advertised was GREAT. I ended up deciding on the Fish-n-Chips opting out on the chips & substituting steamed rice which I was very surprised they even had. In hindsight, that was a mistake - not because of any problem with the rice, but the Sweet potato tots would have been a much better option as I found out sampling from my friends friend dish. The piece of fish was very big and very filling. If you like fish, this is an awesome choice and comes perfectly lightly breaded. You cant go wrong ordering this!!

My friend ordered the Buffalo Chicken tenders and they were very good as well and I ended up sampling them as she couldnt finish eating them all. They were perfectly spiced and very plump = not overwhelmingly hot and not over breaded and I wouldnt be surprised if they had been hand cut and battered on site. My friends friend ordered a sandwhich of some kind and it look very good as well and as previously mentioned, she couldnt finish eating her Sweet Potato tots and that was very lucky for me. I almost ordered a side myself but between drinks & turning my piece of fish into finger food, was having a time of it on my own.

Overall, between the Atmosphere, the kindness & greatfullness of the staff & the good food I can see why no one had anything bad to say about Ri Ra. I will definatly be back with some company for a one man attack on the Large Fish-n-Chips with the Sweet potato tots next time. I dont usually hand out 5's BUT Ri Ra's is a 5 for sure if not more!!",pFnRSBFyU7IEF-9Z-UHP7A,2,2,5,gjJPCvyGCYS7G68DHj8UKA

-Pub Wings: We started off with this delightful appetizer! It was covered with Guinness BBQ sauce and Jameson honey glaze alongside bleu cheese dip. The flavors mingled so well (Probably a little too well because I ate about 75 percent of the wings, and left my friend the remaining 25 percent, haha). So... Hoorah!
-Turkey, Bacon & Bleu Melt: Me! This was my pick. It was really good, but a little dry. I had to dip it in my bleu cheese, but overall it was still a great sandwich.
-Publicans Reuben: This was my friend's pick (Oh, I forgot to mention that we traded half of our sandwiches with each other so we got to taste the best of both worlds!) I cannot explain how great this sandwich was! It was ultimately the best reuben sandwich I've ever gotten to taste! I RECOMMEND THIS SANDWICH UNDOUBTEDLY!

During and after our meal, our server and busser came several times to check on us! (I believe their names were D and Fred, if I can recall). They were happy to grab us some more water, dressing, whatever the case was. This definitely made it such a positive experience! I loved all of the workers! They were all so kind and had plenty of beautiful smiles on their faces whenever they walked by.

A few rounds of Guinness, Mum's meatloaf and a basket filled with a mixture of BBQ / spicy buffalo wings.. all served up while watching that epic Seahawks vs. Packers playoff game on an enormous TV in a restaurant / bar filled with die hard football fanatics.. a slight tear was shed, a little beer poured for the homies, hugs & high fives were exchanged and an extraordinary time was being had by everyone in Ri Ra that day. 

Mum's meatloaf is served sandwich style.. which is fine. I prefer to have my meatloaf in between two buns. OOOOH! BADABOOM! All jokes aside, this thing is a heap of loaded goodness. Not only is your everyday ground beef up in this loaf; Pork, veal, mashed potato, whiskey seared onions, Guinness ketchup and some beer battered onion rings. When a sandwich has that juicy, salty crunch mixed with a mound of flavor packed meat.. you, my friend, have yourself the perfect pub sandwich. 

The wings were the perfect compliment to this feast of a sandwich. They claimed the spicy would be out of this world 'hot'.. though, it barely trickled a sniffle from my snout. No biggie, as the wings were buffalo style and the 'hot' buffalo sauce was still tasty. The BBQ sauce was smothered on the other half, and that sweet tangy flavor could be smelled from a mile away.. More like feet, cause the kitchen wasn't too far from our seats. Mix the BBQ with the hot and you're swimming in Buffalo wing heaven. 

The ambiance is true pub. It felt like, at any moment, an old Irish folk song would be sung and belted out as everyone held their Guinness filled mugs in air.

When my wife and I arrived around 8:45 PM, we were told the band would not start until after a fight on TV was over.  So instead of music, we had to endure a packed bar full of loud drunks watching a UFC fight.  This consisted of men and women bashing each other's brains to a bloody pulp.  Had I been informed of this change of events when I called  earlier, I could of (and wold have) rescheduled my visit.  Since we drove clear across town, we stayed and ordered food. The food was very good. The menu was very traditional Irish fare.  The beer and whiskey offerings were top notch as well.  The band did not come on until well after 10 PM and by 11 PM, we were too tired to stay and enjoy them.  Things went horribly wrong when the bill came.  I  questioned the server about a 20 ounce Guinness on the bill.  I asked her if she knew how many ounces were in a pint.  I received a Guinness in a pint glass.  She proceeded to argue with me that a pint was 20 ounces whilst I corrected her to say that a pint is 16 ounces.  She then tried to tell me that the other beer we ordered in a (different glass) was 16 ounces of beer.  That one in fact was 11.2 ounces which was clearly printed on the bottle it came in!

Meals... My Guiness Stew was VERY salty and it wouldn't surprise me at all if it was nothing more than warmed up can of Dinty Moore. Conversely, though, my wife's Chicken and Sausage Ragout was VERY good. Others in our group ordered the Irish Breakfast, Shrimp Cocktain, Ceasar Salad, and Herb Grilled Chicken. Each shared that their meal was good, but nothing extraordinary.

Beverages... I polished off two pints of Guiness, as did another in our party. Each pint was served at the perfect temperature with a good, solid head. We also chased it with a shot of Jameson's (18 yo) that was a perfect compliment. Everyone else in the group enjoyed iced tea or soda.

Service... Just a bit slow and inattentive. The wait staff appeared to be thin in the ranks, so this may explain the extended wait time between visits - which led to a lot of empty and waiting for refill beverage glasses and the like. Also falling under the service category is that we were seated in one of the pub sections with the expected high bar table and chairs. This, despite one in our party having mobility issues and the high chair being a great challenge. There were PLENTY of empty tables in the dining room but, for reasons still not clear, they would not seat us anywhere but the pub.

Ambiance - VERY nice, from an Irish pub perspective. I appreciate how the owner literally disassembled multiple small pubs in Irelands and brought each to Las Vegas to build one restaurant with a bunch of different pub rooms from different eras. There was also a live Irish folk band, The Shams, playing throughout out meal. They were very good and offered some great, enjoyable music.",BFXL4uvofwVu60C69P1Qeg,0,0,4,q5AYIdMhjba1K57LglHntw

The place was crazy busy but we were early and settled in with a beer. They have an excellent beer selection. 

For dinner I ordered a chicken dish, that I can't seem to find on their online menu. But it was warm and comforting. The chicken was pan friend over mashed potatoes and veggies. It was home cooking done right with just enough elegance that made it feel special. I honestly gobbled it up because it was so scrumptious. When walking through the restaurant, it is easy to spot what the crowd pleasing meal is: fish and chips. This is not your ordinary fish and chips though. It is literally a whole fried fish. It is so big it hangs off the edge of the plate just enough that it doesn't fall off. Everyone raved about their dish. My girlfriends got the Shepherd's Pie, which was surprisingly small in portion size in comparison to all the other meals, but they said it was filling and fine enough to share amongst two people. 

When leaving, there was a live Irish band playing and the place was packed with what appeared to be true Irishmen.

My Husband and I went there yesterday for some drinks and to watch the baseball game. We are not from here so when we got there the ""hostess"" (she should just be called a mannequin or useless cuz she didn't do anything! or even greet us!), finally we caught her eye and we told her we just wanted drinks. She told us ""ok walk all the way to the back past the restaurant and have a seat anywhere in the bar section"". 

Per the Hostess' instructions we did just that, we sat down and no one greeted us or looked at us or came up to us. So many servers walked by us and ignored us.  Finally a blonde server came out from the back and my husband caught her attention and she told us  with an obvious annoying tone in her voice ""if you want service you have to tell the hostess, and first of all this table is dirty so you know you are not even suppose to sit here? if u want to sit here you have to tell the hostess or you sit at the bar"". 

How the fuck are we suppose to know? The gothic hostess told us to walk to the back ourselves, how are we suppose to know the operations of the restaurant? We took her description as the front was the restaurant and when you walk through the door the back was the bar section.  I thought that was RA RA IRISH PUB's job to train them to let them know to seat Guests, not have the Guests just knowwwwww the rules and where to sit. Do you need us to do research on the servers and just know who has how many tables thus far so we know where to sit? 

My Husband and I got so irritated we just left, when we walked up to the front we saw the gothic hostess with the pink hair and 2 other servers standing at the hostess station goofing off. One picked up the other server and was twirling them around in the air like a little kid and the hostess even had the nerve to tell us to have a good day. I wanted to tell them to go fuck themselves, FIRST IMPRESSION OF VEGAS CUZ WE JUST GOT OFF THE PLANE! WORST SERVICE EVER!

We just happened to walk by and see that Derek Warfield from Derek Warfield and the Young Wolftones was the live music that night. Of course, we jump into the pub and sit at the packed bar. Hubby bought several pints of perfectly poured Guinness, a couple which had the four leaf clover design on top, and I had a couple pints of cider. The special that night was mussels in a whiskey sauce. Let me tell you. I had just gotten back from RI and had fresh mussels and these mussels at Ri Ra were equally as fresh, and that whiskey sauce is what dreams are made of. Perfection.

The night was perfect, and it helped that a huge group of Star Wars convention-goers from the UK who were mildly intoxicated showed up and danced the night away with the rest of us.

We always go to Ri Ra for breakfast. At first their menu was smaller, but it didn't matter because everything was scrumptious. My hubby loves the full Irish breakfast complete with rashers and black and white pudding. I love their Classic American or the Kilcullen Omelete. Every tastes as traditional as it gets in the U.S., and it helps that they made the bar in Ireland and transferred all of it to Vegas.

I really appreciate how this Irish pub embodies the Irish culture, with the music and environment all fitting to the classic pubs I went to when I was in Dublin, Ireland. I believe our waitress even had an Irish accent!

I went with family and friends for dinner on Christmas. We went at 6:00, and we were the only table seated in our particular room. The waitress was probably anxious of the crowd of people that she was expecting in on Christmas night, but she was not the most friendly person during our interaction with her. She would lose her patience and give quick, short responses when we asked about different items on the menu. It seemed like she had somewhere to be afterwards and that we were wasting her time.

When we received our food, another waiter took the liberty of doing so. However, he would just place the dishes on the table without naming the dishes so we did not know whose orders were being delivered onto the table. 

Overall, not very satisfied with the service.

We had a party of 10, so we ordered quite a few dishes. 

Baked Goat Cheese: This plate was to die for!! If you are a cheese fanatic like myself, I would definitely recommend this appetizer. The goat cheese was extremely creamy, and absolutely perfect when you pair it with the red onion preserves, pepper relish, & walnut pesto. 

Deviled Scotch Egg: It comes with 4. This was my first time having a deviled scotch egg. I normally don't like mayonnaise, so I was worried it would be like eating a mouthful of butter when I bit into the deviled scotch egg. But, it was very delicious! 

Fish & Chips: This is quite a big order, so I would recommend sharing it with someone if you were to order this dish. The fries did not taste like fries! They were very flat with little potato inside of the fried portion. So I was very disappointed in the fries.

Mum's Meatloaf Burger: A beef/pork patty topped with mashed potato, cheddar, onions, and onion rings... all made into a burger. So basically a heart attack! It was absolutely delicious though. We ordered 3, and did not regret it.

Though we ordered a lot more, that is all for the foods that I was able to try out. I would try out this restaurant if you wanted to experience what it is like to be in an Irish Pub. I was personally not impressed by the service. But, it may have been because it was Christmas night and the waiters/waitresses were anticipating a busy night.

This is one of my favorite watering holes and comfort food spots here in Las Vegas. Always try to visit it before any concert at Mandalay Bay. Also like to bring out of town visitors here. Unfortunately, the past two experiences have been sub par. 

This past Saturday night we brought in a group of out of town guests to pregame before the 311 concert. The goat cheese appetizer is amazing and we always order it. They give you a heaping amount of goat cheese and other tasty spreads. They also only give you 5 small pieces of what look like a dry toast (melba toast maybe?). The 5 small slices are not enough. When you ask for more, they charge you money. Granted it's only a few dollars. But it feels like they are nickle-and-diming you. Especially when you have already ordered drinks and are waiting for your entrees. Not like we are sitting down to eat free toast and nothing else. Live in Vegas, work in the industry and have never seen a place on or off the strip charge for additional bread. It's just tacky. 

I ordered the Alaskan salmon entree. When it came out it was circular in shape, similar to a salmon burger. It sat on a bed of lettuce and was surrounded by some potatoes. The potatoes were dry and I had issues trying to swallow them. The salmon was super fishy and it tasted like the fish had started to decompose. I took another bite to see if it was my pallet and it too was fishy and gross. I suspect it was a salmon burger that had been previously frozen. It was not fresh. I sent it back and asked for fish and chips. Our server then informed me that they were going to discontinue that salmon entree in a few weeks. I suspect that others had also complained and sent it back. Salmon is a staple, it's easy to cook, it should not be circular like a hamburger patty. 

The fish and chips was OK. It was a bit greasier then I remember it being. The chips (fries) were also over-cooked and dry. At this point I had given up and turned my focus on catching a proper buzz prior to the concert. 

Our server was new to R√≠ R√° and she was very friendly. She kept us hydrated and we ran our bill up to almost $300 in the hour we were there (mostly drinks). I hope the management team takes notice and works towards correcting these issues. We will be back, and hopefully we get to experience the R√≠ R√° we fell in love with long ago.",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,2,1,2,_PFfuVxz1EpsqYXmIv3pCQ

What is good? Well, for one, the people.  Sat down on Friday afternoon for a pint while shopping and struck up a conversation with two of the guys behind the bar.  Really nice people, made us want to go back later for dinner, and we did.  And we were glad. Oh, and they recognized us.  We weren't looking for anything, but that tells me something about the persons tending bar and the atmosphere of the place.   

For dinner, I can only remember what my husband and I had, not our friends, but we had Shepard's Pie and a Kilcooly sandwich.  I do know that all four of us were quite happy with our meals.  They pull a proper pint of Guinness, which really should be mandatory for anyone who serves Guinness.  Great choices for beer.  

Good music was also another reason why we like the place.  The band was from Ireland and they were weaving in traditional songs and their own songs.  My understanding is that they bring a lot of bands from Ireland in.

While we were there they were showing Rugby World Cup and football from all over.  This is a good place to go if you are looking for Premiership.

Anyway, we were in Vegas this past weekend and had an actual rare night to ourselves (me and the lady) so we went to look for food.  Our TAO reservations were for the day after and so we yelped what was good near the area.  Of course, R√≠ R√° popped up, and we liked the name, so we chanced it.

I was actually quite worried we wouldn't find the place, but it's actually easy to spot.  Just head down to the area between Mandalay Bay and Luxor.  Then, look for the huge Guinness store.  It's part of/next to/permanently attached to the hip to R√≠ R√°.

It had this slight hint of the popular Irish pint.  But, I think it actually added more to the flavor because of its bitterness.  The beef was really soft, and though I'd rather have potato chunks, the mash was soft and delicious.

Service, for us anyway, was great.  They were attentive, though sometimes we'd go for fairly long stretches between checks.  Though, we were quite in the middle of conversation for most of the night, so I actually thought it was nice of them to leave mostly well enough alone.

I thought at the time... bad thing to hype up the expectations....
HE WAS RIGHT!!
Those fish and chips were crazy good. A huge piece of fish, which you might think would be hard to cook, but was remarkably tender, with the best thin and crispy batter. Also came with crispy In-n-out looking fries that worked perfectly in the dish. They also had malt vinegar on the side and a really tasty, tartar sauce that rivaled any I've ever tasted.
That being said, the potato cake was ok, but not something I'd get again. The potatoes were a little creamier that I would have liked, the texture seemed a little off. Flavor was good overall, but not amazing.

Fish & Chips - Where'd this thing come from? This thing is ridiculously huge, but ridiculously tasty too. Nice crispy and salty exterior with moist, flaky fish inside. Oh, and the tartar sauce is actually worthwhile.

Mums Mealoaf - Meatloaf in burger form, I'm in. Nice thick slab of meatloaf topped with mashed potatoes, onions and Guinness ketchup. Slap yo mum delicious. Need I say more?

Cider Glazed Pork Chop - No kidding, one of the best I've had in a restaurant. Super thick, meaty pork chop with a slightly sweet glaze. Might even want to gnaw on the bone when you're done. 

Guinness Stew - Beef, potatoes, veggies. Simple, but great. This is definitely the heartiest dish we had, but lots of flavor that'll leave you warm and happy.

We would have eaten just about anywhere, but we needed something in close proximity to our theater.  House of Blues - the closest - had a 20 minute wait, so we went up the escalator to the Mandalay Bay shoppes.  Honestly, there was no plan to eat anywhere particular, so the first place we could get into - Ri Ra - was where we stayed.

We didn't have much time to really get into the menu.  It took awhile for the server to come to our table, so I was starting to get anxious.  We were seated in the bar, and it was a very crowded night, so perhaps she just didn't notice us right away.  Once she finally showed up, we noticed she had an Irish accent.  And so did another lady that checked on our table.  Not sure if the entire staff was Irish, but it was kind of cool.

The only thing we had time to order was appetizers since by this time we literally had 45 minutes.  Decided to go for the classic potato cakes with sour cream, balsamic and a side of HP Sauce.  I had no idea what HP Sauce was, apparently it's British, but it tastes just like our A1 Steak Sauce.  Anyway, the potato cakes were crispy on the outside, warm and soft on the inside.  Very, very tasty appetizer.

The other item we got was the Stout Mussels.  My husband and I looooove mussels, and this particular one was steamed in a Guinness stout broth.  Lended a great flavor to the dish.  You could tell there was beer in it, but it wasn't anything overpowering.

Aside from all that, there was live Irish music playing the entire time.  So the atmosphere is very festive, although noisy, so don't come here for a quiet dinner.

Friday night at 5 is early by Vegas standards, so we were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. Knowing we wouldn't be able to take anything with us, we passed on the appetizers. For main courses, my wife ordered their Ruben with a side of Brussel Sprouts and I ordered the Steak and Chips, medium well. When the food came, we were not disappointed. My wife raved about her sandwich and her side. I enjoyed my steak and fries; there are better steak houses in the city but I realize I was in a pub so it did the job quite nicely.

I like the room. They've sectioned it in a way that it feels like a series of bars and not a huge warehouse of a restaurant and the decor is warm and welcoming - lots of wood just like a cool pub. 

Service was as friendly and helpful as you could ever ask for. Nice enough that I may give them another chance sometime down the line but right now I still have the bitter taste of disappointment in my mouth from yesterday. 

We started with the hot wings appetizer. They show up on a mini cookie tray. no problem. Not my style but I'm ok with it. The wings have a very good flavor but not as crispy or cooked thru as I would choose. Not bad enough to send back but made a mental note to ask for well done if I ever return. Both of us said they were ""not bad"".

My partner had a soup and salad lunch combo which was a caesar salad and potato leek soup. I ordered the pub burger with bacon and a cauliflower gratin side. I ordered the burger Med-rare, erring on the rare side. Our lunches arrive in good time and they are on plate size metal cookie sheets. My first thought was prison grub. My partners salad was as scattered on the tray as could be. It really looked like a handful of romain was tossed at the sheet and whatever hit was the portion. Even if we thought the metal trays were nice, and we don't, It could not have been plated sloppier. He said it tasted ok and the potato leet soup was ok too. I tried my burger and it was well done and desiccated. The waiter was nice, took it back and I had another burger promptly. Looking at the new burger it was obvious without even trying it that the patty was raw. I removed the top and the patty had the slightest grey color imaginable. It appeared that it spent about two seconds on a warm grill. I showed the manager and he was nice and apologetic. I was done with them. I asked him to remove it from my bill and to bring me the bill. He did. He also took it upon himself to give us a 40% discount on the rest of the bill. I appreciate that. 

I'm torn if I'll go back. The menu looks good, has lots of things I could enjoy but they can't cook a burger that is on their menu, they don't care how the food looks and sending out the raw patty shows me they are happy to insult a customer. They either don't know how to hire staff or run a kitchen or just don't care. Maybe another time I'll try again but right now I'm still pissed at what poor, talentless, lack of concern we were shown from the kitchen.",uc5SI7_91nonDnujTB7tug,1,0,1,Xo9lJ3hKIu86XML9rqUlGQ
3246649,2014-06-02,0,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"Ri Ra has got to be my favorite place to visit when I'm in Las Vegas.  I discovered this place in March 2013 for the first time and loved it then; I went back this past weekend and fell in love all over again.

We were seated at the bar and were taken care of by Junior, who was fantastic!  If you are headed to Las Vegas and want to visit this place, ask for Junior, he is the best!  

Here's the thing; 90% of the staff is Irish, the bar was from a bar in Ireland, the flooring in the bar room was the same flooring the Titanic was built on.  The whole 9 yards, have the staff give you a tour (they are always glad to!) and you'll learn even more.

On this visit we ordered the Deviled Scotch Eggs and Goat Cheese Sampler for appetizers, the Shepard's Pie for our meal, and stuck with the Irish Red Ale.  The beer was really good and Junior made sure we were never with an empty glass!  Upon hearing that neither of us had ever tried whiskey, Junior poured us a small, complimentary glass of a Jameson to split which hasn't even hit the market yet and is only available in bars.  He taught us how to drink it and has made a whiskey drinker out of me!

On to the food, our Deviled Scotch Eggs were absolutely delicious -- the breading was light and crispy, the eggs were well cooked and the deviled egg filling with fluffy and flavorful,  The Goat Cheese Platter was delicious; my favorite topped was the honey walnut relish.

The Shepard's Pie was okay -- the meat was a bit undercooked but the vegetables, gravy and mashed potatoes were perfect!

During our visit there was an Irish band covering songs like, ""Sweet Caroline"" ""Hey Jude"" and ""Drop it Like its Hot""...we had a fantastic time dancing and singing along and the crowd was fun and lively!

Yes, an excellent Irish pub in small town Japan. It was great. We've been missing that. This place came close. It is a chain so it didn't quite get to that intimate mom & pop feel but it was close. The atmosphere is perfect. It is dark and cozy. Our server was adorable. He was friendly, efficient and attentive. The accent was a huge bonus. I don't know if it was real but it was convincing enough for me. I told my  husbnd to tip extra just beause I got to hear the Irish accent. :)   The food? Delicious. I'm a salmon fanatic and they have a few salmon selections to choose from. I ended up getting the salmon rlt. It was not an easy choice to make though and I will have to go back to try some other items. The salmon rlt was so good I couldn't stop saying so and I'm sure I annoyed our friend who was with us. My husband got the fish & chips. He can be rather picky about fish & chips. While in Germany visiting family we took him to a British military installation where he had the best fish & chips he's ever had and he has yet to find anything that compares. This came close. The chips were not quite up to his high standards but he says the fish was excellent. It must have been because the portion was huge and he ate all of it. Our friend got the Guinness & beef stew and said it was good. He didn't rave about it but he seemed content. We all agreed it was a nice lunch and we'd go there again.

I had been working with the management and staff for a few months to pull  off dinner for 16 and I was not disappointed with either the restaurant  or the staff.
.   
The bar, originally  from Ireland, had been restored and transplanted iin The Mandalay Bay Hotel lock, stock, and dark wooded paneling for it's authenticity.  There was definitely  a pub feel and our bartender had an Irish brogue that was the real deal.   It made me feel like I could sit at the bar with a pint and chill with friends,  but I digress.  

We had a long table in the back next to the stage which was the perfect set up for the surprise party.  The staff was incredible and went out of their was to accommodate  our group.  If I could have had 20 people there was a really cool side room that we could have taken  over but that was not to be.  

Flights and drinks were consumed and laughs, as well as a few tears of happiness were she'd throughout the evening.   Our server,  whose name I cannot remember for the life of me (blonde gal, Virginia/Shannon...forgive me, it was late) was on top of her game!  I ordered the prime rib and it was fantabulous!  The meat was cooked to perfection, the green beans had just the right hint of garlic, and the potatoes were yummy as well!  Everyone's  food was spot on and I doubt that anyone would be disappointed  with anything  on the menu.

I had a specialty cake made for the evening (thank you CAKE Bakeshop in Manhattan Beach, Ca) that was incredible.   The staff graciously  offered to cut and serve the cake as well, even though they did not provide the dessert...what a great group of people!

Did I mention that there is a small stage and an Irish  duo plays most nights?  Entertainment,  food, and drinks...we couldn't  go wrong!  Ending the night listening to the lilting sounds of an Irish melody was the proverbial icing on the cake!

The fish was very good.  One very large piece of battered fish sitting on chips (french fries).  With some malt vinegar the fish was excellent. The chips were not.  They were soaked in grease from the fish and soggy.  Too bad really. I thought they were a victim of bad platting.

3368195,2011-06-16,0,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I'm no stranger to an Irish pub. In fact, I'm a regular pub snob, as my husband is 100% born and raised in Ireland, and I've spent a good amount of my time in pubs. Some good, some bad, some mediocre. And I know it's a chain, but I LOVE this Ri Ra.

After a stressful week spent in meetings, the minute I got to Vegas all I wanted to do was unwind. My coworker knows I love a good pub, and was familiar with Ri Ra, so she suggested we go get a drink. I could still hug her for that! When I stepped in, Ri Ra felt like home. Irish staff and bartenders, dim lighting, lots of dark wood, and an all around great atmosphere. There's even a statue of St. Patrick holding a pint! Love it. (Oh, and this pub is HUGE, btw - if you don't like the area you're sitting in, go exploring into another room, and you're bound to find a space that makes you happy.)

So, we sat at the bar, I knocked back a couple of Jameson & Diet Cokes (not too overly expensive for Vegas, either), and we shared the curry chips, which were excellent. A huge portion (for a good price), and I don't know what they did with the curry, but I loved it, and I'm not normally a fan of curry. As my husband was due to arrive into Vegas later that night, I immediately made plans to bring him back in for drinks and dinner.

Flash forward a few hours, and he and I are sitting in the snug, dining on some awesome food (get the salmon...mmmm.) and listening to a decent ""Irish"" band. (They didn't just play trad Irish, but also threw a bit of everything in, from classic rock and beyond). We moved to the bar after dinner, and  my husband strikes up a conversation with the bartender, who is (of course!) from my husband's home town. 

This experience pretty much laid the foundation for our weekend in Vegas, as I think we managed to come back to Ri Ra at least 3 more times over the weekend, and each time was a lot of fun - full or empty, music or no music. 

I already can't wait for my next trip back to Vegas in October, as I'll definitely be a repeat customer at Ri Ra. Just save me a seat at the bar, and have a menu and a Jameson ready for me.",JFIr4bbO2zjQYdA3LwbbsQ,2,2,5,PO7G8W1vRcEES89-9GeRug

The food is decent, however, it is not traditional Irish food, it is more Irish food with an American twist. The bangers were not quite right(not sure if they were actually real bangers), which kind of threw off the taste of the sausage rolls. Still the food was good.

One thing I that kind of shocked me was the 'live entertainment tax' which kind of sucked since it was almost $5. I have never payed that here in CA, so I wasn't expecting it. 

The 'Irish band' was also a tad disappointing, they played many American songs, and not a lot of folk songs like I was expecting. They all were great musicians though and had great voices.

Of all things to look forward to when in Vegas, my belly calls me back here time and time again. Never a bad meal, experience or eve spent. Tucked away in the hallways between casinos near the Mandalay Bay, it's definitely one to add to your list of places to try. Just love this place (in case you haven't figured it out).

My fave meal (and we've tried nearly everything on the menu) are the Bangers & Mash made on request - not on the menu but ask, proceeded by the Scottish Eggs - best ever, and a thirst quenching Moscow Mule - or two or three to compliment the experience. Or ale, the ale is good too. Portions are filling and shareable, comes hot and fresh. Can't say enough great things. Just go. You'll thank me later.

Love the staff's accents and good vibes, plus the service is top notch, so it's no surprise it's popular. Go early for less waiting and better seats.

Love the atmosphere of this pub, having visited pubs in both Dublin and London it was relatively close to authentic, about as good as it can get for a mall in Vegas. The selection of beer and especially whiskey was impressive. They have a LOT more whiskey than they advertise so make sure to ask your server for the list. I was VERY happy that they had Murphy's Irish Stout on tap as it's my favorite. If you like Guinness, you will LOVE Murphy's. 

Our food was good for sure, but not great, especially for the prices. Between us we had the mac cheese, a lamb burger, and Irish Stew. Best of the lot was the Irish Stew.

We wanted to order cake or ice cream, but were told it was unavailable. Instead we ordered french fries and chips and curry. The french fries are your standard salted skinny fries, nothing above average. The chips and curry are thick fries with curried lamb meat, a curry gravy, and goat cheese, a take on the traditional poutine. The warm creaminess of the goat cheese and the curried lamb taste fantastic together, my only complaint is that the fries don't stand up to the curry gravy and lost their crunchiness and ability to hold the toppings by the time they got to our table.

I ordered the Guinness stew, fish and chips, and the pork belly with polenta. The stew was decent and it reminded me of pot roast. The portion looks small but is is filling and hearty. For the fish and chips, the fish was lightly breaded so you can actually taste the fish, albeit it doesn't have too much flavor on its own. The tartar sauce was pretty good and helps with adding in much needed moisture and flavor to the dish. Also forgot to mention that the fish was huge! I got full after eating less than half of it lol. The fries were a lost cause. Pretty much soaked and soggy from all that oilZ I had a few pieces and had to call it quits because it was pretty disgusting to see all the oil sweeping out lol. Wish the fries were nice and crispy especially when paying $20+ for that dish. The pork belly was delicious but the polenta it came with was pretty dry and flavorless. I had to scrape the little amount of hoisen sauce they provided to make it edible. The free bread and butter was decent, but the bread itself was really dry and grainy tasting. 

Overall the dinner experience was decent. I don't know if I would come back here just because the food wasn't that special to me. I'll be exploring more Irish food at a different establishment to see how they do it.",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,4,3,3,0YS5badrW8wNGv4RF9tYdQ

The hostess asked if we preferred to sit close to the live band but she not-so-subtly implied that we may want to sit in a booth further away because it gets pretty loud. We took her advice and sat in a booth in a room where we could still hear the music but still hear each other.

Cha-ching! First thing we noticed was that they have happy hour all day everyday for the entire month of March. A pint of Black and Tan or Half and Half is only $4. The boys took advantage of the happy hour and the girls ordered cocktails which were at a regular Strip bar price of $13.

We ordered the chicken wings which were pretty decent and the fish and chips. We were surprised by how good the fish and chips tasted.  The fish was cooked to perfection and the batter was light and not greasy at all. The chips were well seasoned. The regular size was $13.95 and the large is $18.95. We just got the regular and it was filling for two people. 

To end our meal, we asked the waitress for Irish coffee and she asked, ""Do you want real Irish coffee?"" to which we agreed even though we didn't know the difference. Little did we know that real Irish coffee comes with a good amount of whiskey! It was good for the first few sips but got a little too strong for our amateur taste buds. One Irish coffee costs $8.

All in all, our first Irish pub experience was memorable. Service was really good; they checked on us regularly and kept our table clear of extra glasses and plates.

This time we were seated further back which had some plus and minus'.  The seating in the back area is quieter since there was no live music playing in this area but this also seems to be where the group seating normally is. The table we sat at was wobbly and attempts to correct it had previously failed as evidenced by the wadded napkins and other things at the base.  I preferred sitting closer to the entrance and will request that for future visits.  The mid section is where the music is playing and if you're going to eat I'd probably skip, its a better spot for drinks and the music.  

The food is what really stands out for me at this pub.  They have a really good, thick, Guinness stew that I really enjoyed and comes with some mashed potato on top.  They serve it with some Irish bread and butter which altogether hits the spot.  The food seems to have stayed consistent over the years which I really like that, that is dependable.


I didn't see it on the menu and frankly I didn't ask but in the past they had a whiskey sampler I didn't see this time that I would have liked to have tried again.  The single most off putting part of my experience is that the place seems like it needs a fresh coat of paint.  The back area felt run down.  I liked that it was quieter and made for a better overall dinning experience but the tables need some help and the chairs replaced.  I think they should rethink the flow so they can have their dinning areas and ""party"" areas separated a little more.  The chairs where we sat were pretty uncomfortable and from the bargain area...maybe some customers get out of control so they don't want decent chairs but separating the areas might help if that was an issue.",S35wtbj1kKgmmSBD5wLfuA,4,1,4,cPxgFPrCNMwcAhtSR1SUtg

I loved this place! It's a quaint place with dark wood, great food, comfortable seats, servers who are Natives of Ireland, and bartenders who know how to pour a proper Guinness. 

We were greeted by Maggie, an Irish girl through and through. She gave us some recommendations, brought our drinks and food in timely manners and chatted with us a bit about her homeland. I don't want to sound silly but her accent made our experience here more memorable. 

The menu is huge and filled with good eats and not just boiled potatoes. We ordered a few ""small plates"" including the sausage rolls and potato cakes.  The rolls were a mild sausage surrounded with puff pastry and a sweet mustard sauce. Flaky dough and meat, how can you go wrong? The potato cakes were crunchy on the outside and filled with sharp cheddar and herbs. Served with a side of sour cream, they were devoured quickly. 

Besides the bites we ordered the Guinness Stew and it was incredible! The perfect hearty warm comfort food you'd want on a rainy day like today. Tender pieces of beef, potato, veggies a dark Guinness gravy with creamy mashed potatoes on top. The flavors were rich and warm and I'm glad we listened to our servers recommendation and orders it. It's also served with a side of Irish Soda Bread and Kerrygold Irish butter! I could have taken a loaf home.

The food that we had here, during a buddy's bachelor party was absolutely garbage. Cold, bland. The mediocrity seethed here.

I mean, I get that they're serving Irish peasant food, so don't expect much. But peasant food [in my opinion] is generally delicious.  You can't put potatoes on everything, serve it with a pint of skunked, overpriced stout and call it good. Even in Vegas, people have expectations and standards to live up to. Clearly this was way below mine.

prices are stupid for the fare that's being served.",awQhT121Pe0R33sukfTyuA,3,1,1,87Nm0x_mNBRvIfZRzR1KCA

We were told all of the tables are currently full near the band but that they would move is as soon as it becomes available. Understandable and we agreed. Over and hour goes by so at that point I decided to take a peak on the table situation. Not one but several tables were readily open. Never asking for the check she returned with it in hand never mentioning the open tables yet again. Never asked if we wanted more drinks. When asked about the table she said, ""I didn't know you still wanted to do that."" At that point we gave up out of frustration. Food was alright. The poutine was horrible.

Once we reach decisions he was right there we went with a few of his suggestions i had the dark and stormy cocktail which combined two of my fav things rum and ginger beer. We started with the crab cakes which i only agreed to because Wally said he had lived on the east coast and we are from there (picky marylander about crabs). The boyfriend had the steak pie special for september, i had sausage and mash, both very very good didn't even need the sauces given/suggested with my sausage. The special was a little smaller thank expected but great  since the crab cakes and side salad would have been a perfect size meal. The live irish duo band was nice, giving something to tap your feet to while you dine.

House salad with blue cheese dressing- dressing tastes like it came from a bottle of wishbone 

Fish n chips- gross! Tarter sauce can't be home made, incredibly thick and overly  sweet, I had to add 3 lemon wedges to one ramekin to make it ""edible"" 

Reuben- sister ordered it with sweet potato fries which turned out to be over cooked and brown sweet potato chips. I'm sorry but when your menu says fries, people want fries, there's a huge difference. She said the sandwich was good though.

You might even miss it, walking by. Over the years, their biggest competitor (Nine Fine Irishmen, at NYNY) has slowly fallen out of favor with me. In fact, the ONLY thing I think Nine Fine has the upper leg on, anymore, is the decor, and that's only because it's two levels vs. R√≠ R√°'s one.

The facade is in the Mandalay Bay/Luxor mall, which is known as Mandalay Place. It's a rather small entry and doesn't offer a very good view of the interior. Once inside, it's a well apportioned Irish Pub with plenty of traditional decor and very dark tones. I like my pubs dark, this one nailed it. It's a rather long and narrow restaurant with a bar on one side and booths on the other. As with any good pub, you can get food at the bar, and typically better service and conversation.

We happened into this place on a Saturday morning and tried a couple items from the brunch menu. I had the Irish eggs benedict. They were poached eggs on potato cakes, rashers, with sauce and a side of hash brown potatoes. The only thing I can find wrong, was the eggs were overcooked. Poached eggs should be runny and they were past that point. Everything else was perfect. It was a lot of potato, but that's Irish food and I like it. Especially good for nursing a hangover. My wife had the corned beef sandwich with curry chips. Chips, of course, being what Americans call fries. Excellent with the curry sauce. When we saw it on the menu, we knew it would be a winner. They had the proper condiments, including malt vinegar and HP sauce available on the bar.

We both had a couple of drinks, including something called a ""Plain stout"" that was spectacular. The bartender was very friendly and helpful, although a little on the slow side to stop by and check on us. But his demeanor and attitude made up for it. He seemed to be of the Irish background, along with another 'lad' behind the bar.

Definitely will be returning. I will probably be skipping Nine Fine for this place, if things over at Nine Fine don't improve. Really a very good find in Vegas for me.",MFmpgDOynM8R9xGG-71i4Q,1,1,5,8G61p4PK3DFDjmjKUnsJgw

Since I live in Vegas and work at the Bay, I was clearly excited when I found out that we were getting an Irish pub of our own. I am yet to go to Ri Ra and have anything less than a great time. 

Lets clear a little something up, Mr. Ben G. Yes, the employees who work there, who are from Ireland...wait for it... They're actually from Ireland. Some are on a one time visa and some are on a permanent visa. Those who are short term, actually live very, very near by. Do you really think they could find that many individuals to fake an accent like that? Didn't think so... although if you head in late, late, late at night you'll find our douche bag so cal guys thinking that they have somehow become Irish and adopted an Irish accent... Anyhow, I'm yet to meet a wretch of an employee there... one girl had an extremely hard time hearing us and didn't think to double check our orders, because the music was too loud and she was caught up in having a good time. Either way, the girl was still a joy and that's the only close to meh experience Ive ever had there. 

The guys at the door, bar tenders, servers and managers always remember us. The music is always fab (Irish music during dinner time and a live rock band later in the evening). It is very loud. If you want to chat with someone and ""get to know them"" go somewhere quieter. 

Ive order their halibut on wasabi potatoes au gratin and Ive also had their gyro wrap ( they call it something different and its on their late menu). If you aren't a fan of lamb and are not familiar with Irish food, watch what you order and don't be afraid to ask what is in it. For instance, shepherds pie in the US is made with ground beef... Irish shepherds pie is made with ground lamb and lets not even get into the blood pudding. Irsih bangers are always great too. If you want to be a stuffy diner, and don't appreciate the hospitality of western Europeans... go back down and have your dinner at Strip Steak (which is always wonderful but for a different breed).",78s6qV0Mml6fu_I99M6MBA,0,0,5,aJYS9oEk65-zEXVVpkxOOg

Checking out the decor it was just as I would expect a pub to look; dark brown wood, a long bar that stretches the length of the restaurant, and a stage for live music.  There are a ton of televisions to watch sports and pass the time.  A very comfortable place!

3930705,2012-03-28,5,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"In the land of The Strip, authenticity is about as outlandish an expectation as winning a bajillion dollars at the roulette table. This is the main tourist drag in Las Vegas. Just about everything is over the top, overpriced, and nothing like its humble ancestors. Take the major bill magician shows. Back in the old days, instead of paying a few hundred bucks to watch a dude disappear a scantily-clad lady, we just stoned the magicians to death! Free of charge! Presto!

So I didn't anticipate finding a genuine pub in the midst of all the neon fakery. But I found one in R√≠ R√°, which is located in the least likely of places - the middle of a shopping mall at the Mandalay Bay resort. Believe it or not, R√≠ R√° isn't just an approximation of what an Irish pub might resemble. It serves lots of beer and whiskey as well as very tasty pub food - albeit, at Vegas prices - and many of the servers have lovely Irish accents. The staff was far and away the most attentive I encountered in my recent work trip to Vegas, possibly the nicest I remember based on a handful of trips to the city. And they didn't need a leprechaun who picked fights with fellows of English descent to keep me charmed, though I hear that's Criss Angel's new act.

Really, all I need for a solo meal in a pub is a cold pint, a plate of something delicious, and some decent reading material. One of the servers even asked me what I was studying so closely on my phone, and we chatted about figure skating. Charming, I tell you! It helped that the mac and cheese had just the perfect bread crumbs-to-cheese-to-noodles ratio. It was so good I ordered it on multiple visits. I know it's no shepherd's pie or fish and chips. I also know what I like, so screw you and the horse you rode in on and trust me just eat it. Even if UK pub food is not your jam, if you want a time-out from the surrealism of The Strip without renting a vehicle, you'll want to pass an hour or two here.",E4SfIfuU0H3RtDKwDvc_Uw,6,5,4,hB63CKEbccq3n1QYAg44tA

3947245,2018-04-27,0,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,I think one of the worst parts about staying in Las Vegas in a hotel is that for the most part when you order a meal at a restaurant and there's a lot of food you can't take it with you back to the hotel and finish it the next day because you're gonna eat at a different restaurant the next day. This is one of those cases. This is a great Irish restaurant and from what I've heard most of the Decour actually came over from Ireland itself it was transplanted into this restaurant. My wife and I were able to share a meal which I asked ahead of time for and we shared the Caesar salad. We had ordered the fish and chips which I believe was haddock and really good. I'm not a big fish and chip person unless it's really good and this was.  You get one big piece of fish which two people can easily share.  The bathrooms in this place are actually outside of the restaurant in the mall part. Before we went to this restaurant we went to the Guinness store next-door.

Everything was good, however, there was bug in my plate. It could be flea. Yuck. I did not see it when it was presented to me. Due to the dim lighting, it must've landed on my plate afterwards.

I guess I was using the reviews to scout out a nice casual place to host a business dinner. I was hosting mostly business associates who were young, hungry and thirsty so the thought of an Irish Pub near the hotel which was hosting our convention seemed appealing. That appeal quickly left us when the waitress assigned to us found better things to do than serve our table. 

It started out nice with the waitress coming over, introducing herself and taking our beverage order as well as appetizers. We ordered the wrapped sausage, mussels and poutine. There were seven of us all having a good time. At no time should all eyes have been turning towards the waitress until 45 minutes later and our food was finished, drinks were gone and we were hungry and ready to order our main dish. We were watching as she hid behind an area where she was entering information into a computer. We went over to her to explain that we were ready to order and she explained that she was busy with the computer having issues and would be there shortly----Wrong Answer. There wasn't a manager, hostess or other server available to rescue her. Finally she came over to take our order and get our next round of beverages. 

I had the sprout salad which was very good. The mussels, poutine and wrapped sausage were all very good hence the 2 star review. Unfortunately if you try to ruin an important business dining experience, the service plays a major role. 

We were seated at 7:00 and finished closer to 9:00 just in time to hear the live entertainment. It was a memorable experience, but only from the negative side. They add 20% tip to all tables of 5 or more. In this case, they should have deducted 10%. They don't point out that the tip is already included unless you read carefully, but always leave room for an additional tip. I usually do, but not this time. I won't be going back here again.

That is the reason I come here, the quality of the live music is great.  The person who books the talent knows their stuff.  It is always Irish themed music, but not just traditional jigs & what not.  The first time I came here, The Blaggards were doing some traditional song.  I took a quick break.  When I came back, they were doing Psycho Killer by the Talking Heads!  I haven't heard that in a while & was stoked!

Most of the bands will do Irish folk, country, & some Irish based rock bands like U2, the Pogues, Dropkick Murphys, etc.

Drink prices, specifically beer & cider are actually good for a joint in the Mandalay.  They'll have a cocktail of the month. This month is a Blackberry Mojito (for May).  It is meh, but, I am not a huge mojito fan.  I've done an Irish Whiskey flight and that was great & cheap.  $12 for 4 2oz shots of increasing quality.  

I've had some food.  For sure, their Irish Curry is great with chips (fries).  I would love to come for dinner, but I seem to only make it here on Tuesday nights.

The  service is friendly & fast, the ambiance is great with a private bar/room to the left of the stage & dining behind the bar/stage area.  If you need a more quiet spot, sit near the storefront & the sound isn't loud, in my opinion.

It took a minute for us to get a table although no one was there. I think we went when they were still trying to work the kinks out of serving breakfast (they were advertising outside that they were ""NOW OPEN FOR BREAKFAST!""). 

I ordered the Full Irish - A proper fry up - 2 eggs, Irish sausages & rashers, black & white pudding, grilled tomato, saut√©ed mushrooms, beans, toast - It was AMAZING. I've never had black and white pudding, but for the record, it's not the sweet kind of pudding. It's BETTER. It was this savory, textural, explosion of flavor. Amazing. And by the way, the coffee is done in a french press. At your table. If you so please, it can be poured for you after properly steeped or you can pour to your desired steep. Nice touch. I like.

My colleague got the Kilcullen Omelette and swears up and down that he's never had a better omelette. Take note, he's never had brisket before in his life and brisket can go horribly wrong so easily. Props to Ri Ra for making him a believer. 

Our waitress was a doll. Loved her to death. She was so accommodating and profusely apologized at their lack of condiments - though we didn't need them. She went above and beyond to get us ketchup and offered compote because they were out of jam. For the love of all, I wish I knew her name. She was amazing.

What's even better is some of the staff are from Ireland and I talked to a few who waited on us and they were really nice. I ordered the Guinness beer and it was like nothing I ever had before. It was so good. If you go here and get a beer, get the Guinness, you will not regret it. The bartender, Jr., even put an imprint of a three leaf clover on the head of my beer. How cool is that?

We came back later and Fitzy was our late night bartender and he was very nice as well. I was a little disappointed that we had come too late since we had missed the evening dinner. I was looking forward to trying the prime rib and/or the Shepard's pie and sausages and mash but we settled for the fish and chips and sausage rolls which wasn't too bad at all to settle for. It was really good! But that's okay because it just gives me an excuse to come back here again. Overall a great experience!",U5G7vS4dexvqljxeVLJYKw,0,2,5,wVmpDiaTLNaI3YCEUcIITQ
4055537,2017-05-23,2,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"My visits to Vegas have been more of a diversion and since I'm not a newbie, most of my trips come planned in advance with reservations at eateries I love or have yet to try.

That being said, given that our stay was not going to incorporate ethnic eateries (I can get Mexican and Asian food back home) we made reservations at a bunch of Americana spots or in this case, at an Irish spot located in the shops connected to Mandalay Bay.

While our journey here was albeit longer than the typical search for a breakfast joint, access is bia the mall, even if the mall is not open yet so bear that in mind.  Once inside, you are swept away to an envisioned Irish Pub.  If this is what a classic pub looks like, then I'm all game.

Their breakfast menu here is quite extensive and for those looking for direction, I would stick with something classic.  I ordered the Irish Breakfast, which came with the following items: The proper fry up of 2 eggs any style, Irish bangers & rashers, grilled black & white pudding, grilled tomato, saut√©ed mushrooms & toast.  Reason being, I wanted to try the grilled black and white pudding.  Please note that the platters here are huge, so there is no way you would be able to finish the entire portions.  The butter was the best part.........rich and creamy, like Darigold.  

We gobbled up everything prior to heading back out to the strip.

5 stars for ambience, service, food, and just a great reason to get out of the Vegas heat.",m5cBT7OYfn0HM0d-RCsdZQ,3,2,5,UvrBa4OPTR-kMv3lfaBWyQ

So my sister recently discovered this place and decided to take me and my bro over the weekend. When you first walk in, you're immersed into the expected fish and chips bar scenery...but then you keep walking...and walking...and suddenly realize you're walking into many different rooms with different themes. I seriously felt like Alice falling down the rabbit hole because it's so much bigger in the inside! 

The kind hostess led us to our reserved table in a room surrounded with red curtains and a lit Christmas tree in the back. Our table was already set with a dainty tablecloth, teacups, and menus placed in the middle. I was already impressed! 
Our waitress who had pink hair came to take our orders and she was incredibly helpful. Since it was my first time here and not familiar with teas, she was so kind enough to bring out the herbs for all of us to smell! She and the manager was also super intent with my vegetarian needs and even made a separate customized platter for me! A++ for customer service!

Price:
Afternoon Tea: $22 +tax . A pretty good deal compared to other tea places in Vegas.Also make sure to make a reservation a day ahead!

Food: 
As for the food, they really don't skimp out on their portions. The food comes out in a three-tier stand with the following:
Top: desserts (creme puffs, cake rolls, etc)
Middle: scones with jam and creme
Bottom: sandwiches and cheesy bread slices
The scones were soft and crumbly and the sandwiches were packed with filling! However, the cheddar bread slices were a bit dry.

Teas:
We each got a different pot of tea so we can try a little bit of everything. My favorites were the Organic Assam and Earl Grey - both are black teas. A great thing is that the pots are refillable with no extra cost.

Overall, this is such a great place for both fish and chips and a couple of beers, or a fancy  afternoon tea with the ladies. Remember, pinkies up!",2yPRCQMd2u0ka7r5IdITBQ,1,0,5,RifvqZYvE7QIw7zoCbJb2w

To be honest, a few if us wondered what they were thinking going from a small but elegant ceremony to an Irish Pub. As soon as we walked back to the private room, any doubts we had were gone. 

The fireplace and decor of the room made it seem like an intimate dinner party rather than a bar reception. The Irish themed appetizers were hot, tasty, and provided a nice change from veggie plates and chips and dip. Having super-charming bar staff with adorable Irish accents (who cares if they are really authentic?) added such a fun element to the party. 

Service was on par with nicer restaurants in Vegas, and no one in our party ever went without food or drink. After the cake was cut, it was expediently whisked away, only to return in portions to eat right there, or packaged up for later. The extra apps were wrapped up, along with extra cake, and sent to the Bridal Suite for late night snacking. 

The entire staff was overwhelmingly gracious, and in a town where they see so many weddings every day, it was great to feel like they were only interested in ours.

Food is superb--Quality Irish pub food with an emphasis on quality. Here's a rundown of some of food that I've tried:

-Potato cakes: No doubt, the best app I've ordered so far. A Must try. Balsamic glaze on the panko crisp blew my mind.
-Jameson glazed wings: I've had similar stuff at Firkin, but R√≠ R√° was here first. Delicious. 
-Irish roast pork: Hefty cuts of pork loin and  roasted potatoes covered in a whiskey gravy, coupled with honey-glazed carrots. Fist bump love for this one. Salad comes with this one too, and well, it's a typical salad.
-Fish & Chips: I've had many a fish and chip in my day. The way they do it here is one of my favorites. Plus, it's a huge serving. Order it. Devour it. Enjoy.

Don't be thrown off by the ""reasonable"" prices, their miniscule portion sizes are why they charge less for less.  

We ordered the sausage rolls app, at $12, they give you 2 tiny sausage covered in filo dough drizzled with sauce.  I saw the plate and knew the rest of the meal was going to be disappointing.  $13 for a burger slider (effectively), and $17 for flavorless shepherd's pie.  

Our waitress (Jane) was great, and I want to increase my overall rating for her, but that's what brings it from 0 to 1 star at all.  I don't know why anyone would go here, you're better off eating fast food at McDonald's...

4484675,2013-01-08,0,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"With our friends visiting from Philly, we went to RiRa on a Friday night, when a great deal for locals - 40% off food - is offered.  One thing I love about Irish pubs is the decor - all dark wood and atmosphere.  I wasn't sure that an Irish pub at Mandalay Place would be authentic, but RiRa sure was: raucously loud, friendly, and, and hopping.

Our choice was to wait for a booth or try to have four of us eat at one of the tiny, high center pub tables with backless stools.  Luckily, a booth opened up not long after we tried to settle in at the pub table, and we changed over to a much more comfortable spot.  The waiter was great, despite the crowd and having to shout over the music that was way too loud. 

We started with Irish potato cakes, delicious with the addition of a balsamic glaze. Two of us ordered the pork loin special, which differed a bit from the regular one on the menu, and it was terrific.  Hubby had the Guinness Beef Stew, which he loved, and one friend, looking at the Reuben sandwich at the next table, decided to go with the Corned Beef and Cabbage.  I tasted it and found it very bland.  IMO, when it comes to corned beef, there's only one kind of place to get it, and an Irish pub doesn't cut it for me.

We almost never order dessert, but since our friends always do, we didn't want to watch them and drool, so we did, too.  They got the blueberry crumble, which we would have gotten too, except it had an oat crumb topping.  I sowed my wild oats years ago, so we passed on that and went with the Kerry Apple Cake.  The apple cake turned out to sound better than it tasted, so I guess we should have gone blueberry.  I also ordered coffee.  They serve it in a French press, but the small one I ordered turned out to give me half a cup of coffee.  For me, an 80-oz a day coffee junkie, this was unacceptable!  The waiter, sweetheart that he was, brought me a gigantic French press, which the menu said serves 3-4, and it was just perfect!

Okay, so the music was too loud, and wasn't exactly my idea of Irish music - no ""Danny Boy"" was to be heard, mostly pop with an Irish flair.  The restaurant was loud even without the music.  It was crowded.  But I loved it!!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,0,1,4,TzDkdFqH28X4hrocvxfxEA
4488555,2017-06-07,0,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"The ratings on this place were so good I didn't bother reading any reviews, I assumed everything I ordered was going to be off the charts.  I live in So Cal so finding decent Irish/English food is a challenge, I was thrilled with the chance of finally getting some decent pub grub.

I ordered sausage rolls, scotch eggs and a pint of Harp. Boom, treat on its way...

What arrived on my table was the sorriest excuse for scotch eggs I have ever seen.  The eggs had a very thin (1/8"" or 3mm) coating of sausage making the entire egg not much bigger than a normal hard boiled egg.  Even worse, the eggs had been halved and made into deviled eggs.  They were downright f***ing nasty.

Next I tried the sausage rolls.  Now sausage rolls and I have had a love affair for 4 decades, I know exactly what constitutes a killer one.   These were sausage links covered in a very hard flaky pastry then smothered in a dijon mustard sauce...WTF!!!!!.  The links were hard and unflavorful and the sauce was horrible.  The pastry was so hard I believe they might have been yesterdays re-heated rolls.

Finally, it's hard to beat a pint of Harp but I got a 12oz not-very-cold beer in a not very appealing glass.  Irish/English pints are 20oz and lagers/pilsners etc are served ice cold.

$12 for each appetizer and $6 for the beer.  I paid $30+ tip for this pile of shit which really pissed me off. 

To the owner, I hope you listen and care.  Scotch eggs need at least 3/4"" or 12mm of sausage around them and DO NOT cut them open.  A correct Scotch egg is about the size of a baseball/cricket ball.  Sausage rolls should be made from sausage meat and NOT links.  The pastry and sausage should be very soft and served without anything on them.  Put your sauce on the side if you must.

Watch some YouTube videos and learn how to make these important dishes correctly for crying out loud.",3aazRNt2O0H2rXA1x9eGmQ,2,0,1,iTrK1oHAUA94wffeFvxpng

my friends Sheri M. Liza R and I were having a staycation at Mandalay for NYE for two nights. Always heard the Irish place was good. It was not super busy either night but they had live music, two guys singing and playing guitar. They were awesome, very energetic and lively. 

The food and service is what makes this place. The ambiance is dark and the vibe is cool...plus the whiskey wall is awesome! If you can't have fun at a place with live Irish music and whiskey everywhere...well.. I can't hang out with you. LOL

I ordered the veggie burger on 12-30 which came with goat cheese. See my pics, it's hard to describe. It was definitely homemade veg burger and it was really good. We came back on NYE for dinner and I couldn't resist ordering the salmon. It was out of this world, melt in your mouth amazing. I think it came with some sort of crisp potatoes, I inhaled it so fast. Perfect amount of food and wasn't horribly priced, I think maybe it was a $22 entree. It was New Year's Eve so I splurged. :) That and a Makers Mark mmm mmm mmm!

I personally love shoe string onion rings so I was infatuated. The Ruben was very good too, probably the best I've ever had. My boo went with the Irish mac n cheese.

They're trying hard to represent an Irish pub, but with the Cranberries crooning ""Zohohm-bee eeh eeh eeh "" on the speakers, and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish playing on TV, it's classic Vegas kitsch. 

Service was fast. I ordered a Guinness stout (served colder than I like), the Burren Irish Smoked Salmon small plate and a Sprout Salad, then settled down to watch an obscure European soccer game. 

The salad and salmon arrived simultaneously - I started with the former but it was too dry, though the dried cranberries and spicy cashews were a nice addition. I put it aside and turned to the Burren salmon. 

The salmon was excellent - tender and succulent - but ratio of fish to sundries was way off. Too much pickled red onion, capers, and sour cream, not enough salmon. And the soda bread was way too thick and dry - they'd put store bought Kerrygold butter on top (of course!) which made me smile at the irony.

Luckily, their late night menu goes until 1am, and has a good number of ""full dinner"" choices on it.

Being an Irish pub, I was expecting a few good draught beer, and a couple of good Irish whiskey and perhaps a few different scotches. However, this place has a fairly wide selection available, ranging from regular everyday stuff, to good outside of most people's repertoire brands, and on it to some good rare whiskey that some might kill to try (eg. Usually only available at large private dram club events - and the price tag of those is predictable, if not just a tad outrageous).

As far as our food, it was a welcome late night meal. When asked about the prime rib, our server was honest, saying she didn't find it that special, but it was a popular selection. Overall, she was dead-on... while quite a generous cut at a reasonable price, it was a bit dry (or perhaps a little over the medium rare I selected), but the au jus helped make up for that issue (and really, at well after usual dinner hours, I am not going to complain, anyway - I was happy to not be settling for a simple burger some place).",FppPJa7X_8Dz9gaNukmqlg,0,0,4,4yels4nEfUwgc_JCBeAyew

It comes with tarter sauce and they have a more traditional vinegar at the table so you have a choice.  We also ordered a Publican Reuben which arrived looking very nice with lots of fries on the side.  Nothing was left behind after this plate was eaten.

Felicia (didn't catch her last name) was the manger on duty.  She discreetly advised me that our birthday cake had not been delivered and she had her staff trying to contact Freed's.  Shortly thereafter, she advised me that Freed's could not be reached.  However, she told me she had a chocolate cake that they could substitute and that it would be on the house!  Wow, did you guys ever deliver!

Your staff took what could have been a disappointment and turned into a success.  What fantastic customer service.  You are to be commended for hiring and supervising such capable and wonderful people.  

We hadn't been to Ri Ra in two years, but I guarantee we will not wait that long to return.  Additionally, I will tell all my contacts on social media about this experience.

Their full Irish Breakfast is incredible, the fish and chips are great, and the Guinness stew is inexpensive and awesome.  All of the food I've had has been very good.

Immediately after entering I felt completely at home and absolutely loved the vibe from the place. 

I don't drink but after having the shepherds pie with Guinness and the Guinness chocolate brownie dessert I'm strongly reconsidering my position.  So so very good. But even better was the service. I had no fewer than 4 different bartenders up front stop by and chat with me. Incredibly enough they all were native Irishmen. All were genuine and went out of their way to provide unbelievable service.  Some of the nicest most hospitable waitstaff I've seen anywhere. If they are anything representative of Irish people than I seriously want to sell all my possessions and move my family there. I want my kids raised around people like that. 

The food was great, the service was the best I've received in my life and I completely enjoyed every minute spent in this awesome bar. The food was terrific and while i had better food in Vegas, I had no better experience than I did in Ri Ra. It will be the first place I visit again on my next trip through town.

Second and third stars: Atmosphere. Walk underneath the classic dark wooden entryway and into the Emerald Isle without ever showing your passport. Authenticity of the ambiance comes through with each seemingly minor decoration detail that accumulates to make for an experience akin to being in Belfast or Dublin (we went to both in the spring of 2015).

Fourth star: Service. Prompt attention from our server, Graham, who not only exhibited extended knowledge about an extensive drink menu but comforted with his good sense of humor as well.

Fifth star: Food.  Reuben sandwich with a side salad was of perfect proportion so that one wouldn't nod off when returning to a conference after lunch.  Although not every bar in the U.S. serving Guinness on draft has been personally experienced, it's hard to imagine their pour not making it into the nation's final four.

How can you be sure this place was truly liked? During our short Vegas stay we visited it 3 times.  Should you not prefer sandwiches, then the fish and chips are really as good as advertised.

I've tried a few dishes since each visit was with a large group and allowed for a greater variety of samplings. During this visit, I ordered the ""IRISH POTATO CAKES"" again and it was good.

I also ordered the ""UNIQUELY VEGGIE"" burger (housemade white bean patty, crumbled goat cheese, sun dried tomato pesto, cucumber, caramelized onions on toasted wheat) with a side of housemade chips. The patty was really great and everything came together well. The goat cheese was a tad too much, but that's just the nature of the cheese. It also needed a little more flavor or just salt, which is a simple fix.

Parking was a bit of a trip, finding it, that is. On the way there, we saw an Elvis impersonator on a scooter at a stop light, Pete Rose in a shop window signing baseballs and of course I found a stocking store, So those three things were a pretty good build up. 

There was a short wait, and once we were seated, we found that the service was excellent, never once did our glasses go dry. We ordered appetizers of Scotch Eggs and Salmon - that's for the boys, not for me, and both were incredibly flavorful. The scotch eggs were SO GOOD.

Our main dishes were as varied as the personalities at the table, so I'll just tell you about mine. I got the Guiness Stew and Salad combo and while the price was reasonable, the portion size was quite decadent. I couldn't finish the stew! The flavors were so good! 

The conversation was easy and the company was just as good! I was almost sad to leave, except.. not. It was time to get going on to the rest of our day! You can be sure that I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas.",Um5bfs5DH6eizgjH3xZsvg,1,2,5,qmUfIXxAZVlgpRHocEtO4Q

I came back when it opened and he fulfilled his promise. First round and by far the best pour I have had in America. Now for Guinness lovers that is a very important thing. I met some of the staff and they are awesome.

Since then I drop by whenever I am in town.  Food is excellent and I've tried most things on the menu. The ambiance is like a pub is supposed to be, and clean to boot.

What I have come to seek in a pub is a place with good food, affordable beer you can drink in large amounts while bullshitting with friends, prices that let the bar fill with regulars, and an atmosphere of cozy chaos. Bear this in mind.

My husband and I went with 2 other locals for the locals happy hour, and even with the deal, this pub was quite expensive for the food. 

Pros: 
- Lots of wonderful free soda bread, and all the import beers you might like from Britain and Ireland.
- Very friendly, attentive and polite staff.
- Easy to read in the Mandalay Mall thing.
- Scotch Eggs! And damn delicious ones at that. All of the food was quite good.

Cons:
- It's pricey. Even with a generous locals discount event it is too spendy to be a frequent haunt; which is rather at cross purposes with being a ""pub"".
- Its huge, and it is loud. Very loud. Not ""band playing a set"" loud, or raucous conversation loud, but ""the radio is so loud we have to shout"" loud; which is rather at cross purposes with being a ""pub"".
- It's authentic...like the Blarney Stone. All the parts are there, but it just sort of lacks the atmosphere that separates a pub from a bar that serves bangers. It's not a bad pub by Vegas standards, but the price point and tourist saturation will leave me hunting for a pub to call my local.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,0,0,3,wBmq3FvR8CM3qL--Dl2-rw

The ticket time was dreadful for starters while watching multiple servers pace back an forward with looks of confusion delivering food. Perhaps their table numbering system is off.    
I ended up inquiring with management about our food after waiting an unreasonable length of time (moments before it arrived). The restaurant wasn't busy on the front end at all.

My ""not so lucky"" white bean veggie burger $12 was absolutely disgusting! I literally left it on the table. This homemade patty texture was terrible and the flavor was even worse. 
My friend ordered the fish & chips $20. This whole filet of Icelandic haddock was massive! The taste was decent; no outstanding bold beer battered flavor to rave about. I did end up sharing the dish due to the generous portion (definitely shareable depending on your appetite). The fries (or chips) were soggy and blah just like the onion rings $6.

Ri Ra features an extensive menu of Irish and some American favorites. I wanted to order about a half-dozen things off the menu. Bangers and mash. Lamb stew. Fish and chips. Went with the fish and chips and shared with the hubby--it was plenty. It's a huge slab of fish covered with light-as-air beer batter. OM NOM NOM.

The soda bread--I know it's supposed to be dense and dry--was just a little too dense and dry, though once slathered in KERRYGOLD (!!!) butter pats and dipped in soup, it's perfection. So, toss-up there. I asked for an extra serving of it, so there you go.

The most memorable thing was actually my dad's lamb stew, and also their potato leek soup, of all things. The former was rich, flavorful, authentic, and lick-the-bowl good, and the latter was silky, smooth, and had ideal flavor. Win.

Drawback was trying to find gluten-free food for my mom, who has celiac disease (read: gluten ALLERGY, not diet).

We walked down the mall area for a few minutes looking at stores but then went to wait in front of the place again for fear we would miss our calling.   After a wait of over 45 minutes we were about to leave and go eat somewhere else but the guy pointed at us and let us know our table was ready.

For dinner I ordered the Reuben and my husband the shepherds pie.   My one complaint is that they charge extra for sides which don't really amount to anything when they bring them out to you.  I ordered a ceasar side salad to go with my sandwich and it was basically a few small pieces of lettuce with 2 croutons on top.   The Reuben was pretty good. 

Waitress made small talk as we were paying the bill which was nice however once I put my card in and she brought it back I set my beer down for a second to sign my name and she snatched my beer and all the other glasses and took them to the kitchen.   I still had about 3 drinks left in my glass so that irritated me since I'd spent good money to purchase a beer.   I took a dollar tip away for that . 

Other than that a reasonable place to eat at in Mandalay Bay.  Just don't go during the Irish music segment if you aren't interested in hearing it because I read on the menu they charge a 20 percent surcharge of your total bill to hear the band play.   Glad we got out a few minutes before they started playing or it would have been an $8 dollar charge extra on top of all the other taxes and tips.",VN_n0Ddxny0J6Z0ehMsvUw,0,0,3,94XmyAIWlOsXJHmW3q0HRA

The server immediately whisked the plate away and said she'd be back with a replacement. Within moments a manager came by to ask if my wife was ok and if she could do anything. No sooner had she stepped away then another manager stopped by and asked the same thing. Fantastic proactive customer service.

Located in Mandalay Place, which in the past could be hard to find from the main hotel, but there are signs EVERYWHERE. (I used to work in the mall, so I know it used to be difficult to find.) 
   We were seated right away and immediately felt at home. The decor, though new construction, made it feel like it has been there forever. Our waitress came immediately and brought us our drinks very quickly. A Guiness for myself and a summer shandy for my friend. Our other friends arrived and also got the shandy. The crowd was a normal mix of your typical Vegas Strip spot. Old, young, drunk bachelorette, etc. A huge fan of Reubens, I was excited to see it in a prime spot on the menu. Once we ordered our food, Sarah, our waitress brought out soda bread and butter. The bread was delightful, but the butter was those little cold bricks. It tasted fine but I hate having to warm it in my hand in order to make it spreadable.  
   I got the Publican Reuben with a side of Garlic Creamed Spinach. Other orders at the table included a Caesar Salad and another side of Creamed Spinach. (Did I mention my friends are girls) The reuben was the perfect size (no snake-like jaw acrobatics needed). The meat was tender and juicy with the perfect mix of salty. The sauerkraut was great, but there could have been a little more of it and the sauce was AH-MAZING! The creamed spinach tasted phenomenal. We joked a little at the texture as it was a little baby-foody, but it wasn't bad enough to make us uncomfortable. I would definitely order this side again, though I would order the large size. NOTE: If you are ordering any of the sides by themselves, go large. 
   When we were finished Sarah asked to bring the bill and even offered to split it up for us. Normally, anywhere on the Strip, when you make this request, it is answered with a shrug, a sigh and a hesitant, if not, passive aggressive, ""Okay."" All in all, the experience at Ri Ra was a great one. I will be back for the Fish and Chips. Everyone around us was ordering them and they looked mouth wateringly yummy. Make sure you get there early. After 8:45, when the band starts playing, a Live Entertainment Tax is added to you bill.

1pm.  Crispy, moist, a little greasy, foot long piece of battered cod on a pile of hand cut fries.  Fish and Chips.  A few splashes of malt vinegar and a pint or two of  GUINNESS, rooting for your team.

7pm.  Minced lamb sewed with carrots, leeks, wine and peas topped by a crisp crust of buttery mashed potatoes.  Shepherd's Pie with a pint or two of GUINNESS.  Dinner of champions.

9pm.  Live Irish music, a pint; before you know it, you'll have an Irish accent and are just another reveler in at the party!

One of the best pulled pints of Guinness outside Ireland (or another Ri Ra location).  Brewery fresh with rapid consumption, pulled through the ideal system designed by the brewery itself.  Perfect temp.  Creamy head,  The classic seven gulps, seven rings on the glass when you're done.

Outstanding selection of Irish whisky including some very difficult to find gems.  Solid list of brown libations.  Other Irish brews and a full bar to satisfy any drinking needs.

Outstanding service.  Very friendly.  Ultra high energy as the crowd swells during rugby and football matches and becomes standing room only during live entertainment.  True Irish pub atmosphere.

Critical Review:

1.  Breakfast - Stand out items, Irish breakfast (described above) and the banger or rasher sandwich.  Simply served on buttered white bread with a side of potatoes and a grilled tomato.  Simple and satisfying.  Skip the pancakes.  Crumbly and off taste.

2.  Food in general - If it sounds Irish, order it.  It's their forte and done well.  One exception, the burgers for lunch are outstanding.  Thick, juicy, huge, cooked to temp.  Try the dubliner with ground lamb.  Just remember, the Irish in Ireland don't eat corned beef and cabbage.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,22,24,4,fwrrKxe6_Q_VACvZ3cp8Vg

It's a good-looking pub. Wood is everywhere. I can imagine that the acoustic when live music acts play here would be fantastic. The selection of booze was impressive, as you would expect in an Irish pub.

The breakfast menu was equally impressive. I got the Full Irish breakfast, which consisted of eggs (I got my scrambled), Irish sausages, rashers, black and white puddings, grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, and toast.

My meal was tasty and huge. Luckily, I had brought my appetite. Everything was perfect. I especially love mushrooms and baked beans for breakfast. My only explanation is that I never had these items for breakfast until I hit my mid-twenties and have never looked back.

Unfortunately, I don't recall what my friend had ordered. All I recall is that we both asked for tea. For me, it was peppermint and it was perfect.

Our server was friendly and helpful. This pub has a relaxed atmosphere, which my friend and I appreciated.

Prices are cheap here compared to other restaurants in the area. If you want decent Irish fare at decent prices, this place is for you.

My second visit was following a long session at the poker table. Most everything around the Excalibur/Luxor/Mandalay Bay corridor was closed at 2 am, but this place was my late night rescuer. Still serving beer until 3 am and an adequate bar menu, too, I was able to get a little 1/4 pound Chipper burger and fries. It came with a curry mayo that was super-good.

5199346,2012-10-05,9,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"If you're looking for loud, live Irish music and a bottle full of whiskey, this is your spot. The music is a tad too loud for me when I am not intoxicated and actually want to have a conversation, but that doesn't mean it's not a cool thing. I don't think they have music every night, but they have it quite often.  

I can't comment on the food, but if you're in the market for a bible's worth of whiskey to share with friends in a quality atmosphere, this is a nice alternative to a super-swanky Vegas lounge. Heck, the bartenders even have Irish accents, which makes me want to drink more. 

The bar is beautiful, but my absolute favorite part is the little living room-styled back room. If you walk in, go to the end of the bar, and make a hard left you will enter what appears to be a rec room straight from a 70s Irish home. There are couches, wood paneling, bad wallpaper... every detail is perfect and cozy. It's an amazing room to host 20-30 people for a cocktail event, and a nice spot to pull up a stool, sip whiskey and listen to an Irish lilt.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,12,19,4,aXVr88lqXIfTASv5Kb39FQ

We hit this place every time we come to Las Vegas.  It's so freaking good...no joke.  I actually tried something new for the first time.  I always get the corned beef & cabbage, but opted for the Bangers & Smash.  Phenomenal.  My hubby had the fish and chips.  He ordered it that first visit and hasn't strayed...he has dreams about that fish.  It's stupid good...best ""fish & chips"" fish I've ever had.

Oh, and the last 5 or so times we've visited, I've had the Corned Beef & Cabbage is ridiculous (in a good way).

5227997,2014-11-03,1,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"It feels great to finally remove Ri Ra from my bookmarks list.

Let me explain:  Back when I started actively Yelping a little over a year ago, I saw someone review this place, and when I checked the menu, I saw an item that I HAD to try:  Irish Benedict.  Eggs Benedict on potato pancakes instead of an English Muffin?  You had me at ""Potato.""

Yesterday, we were celebrating my dear friend's birthday, and my completion of a pretty intensive diet and exercise program, so for a treat, we came to Ri Ra.

I'm really angry that I waited so long, but at the same time, it was worth the wait. 

The pub is easy to find in Mandalay Place, and has a very cozy feel to it.  Like so many Irish pubs, its a bit on the darker side, with dark wood tables, bars, and chairs.  There is a stage for live music, and they have several rooms, with TVs and projector screens so that people can watch games or matches.  

Our server, Victoria, was a treasure.  
She was friendly, offered recommendations, and answered our MANY questions about the menu, and the Scotches.  She offered us extra soda bread, and even continued to take care of us when we asked to take our Scotch flights in their parlor room, when that wasn't her section.

Speaking of Scotch!
They have a whole wall full of Scotch and Whiskey.  I was in heaven.  SO many good ones too!!!  They have some pretty amazing flight deals, which I will touch on later.

So now, onto the food. 
We ordered the following:
The Potato and Leek soup with bacon and Irish Cheddar, served with soda bread:  THIS was delicious.  I can't say I've ever had a leek soup before, and I just loved this.  Sadly, I didn't order it, my fella did, but he loves me, so he shared.  

Fish and Chips:  Two of the three manly men at our table ordered the small fish and chips...and it wasn't exactly small!  We'd heard amazing things about the fish and chips here, even that it was better than another Irish Pub that we frequent, and so we had high expectations.  I don't know that I'd say that they were ""better"" but they were very different.  First, rather than a few small pieces of fish, for the ""small"" portion, they give you a HUGE fillet of battered fish!  Let me say it again...HUGE!  The batter had a nice crunch to it, and for me, was very light.  My fella said it was a touch greasy towards the middle, but also said that he enjoyed the way the batter soaked up the malt vinegar and salt.  
The chips were pretty standard:  could have been a touch more crisp, but they were very good.

The Kilcullen omelette: The only issue with this one was that it was overwhelming mushroom flavored.  It was still good, but I think we could have done without so many mushrooms, and a bit more corned beef.

Finally, the Irish Benedict:  Let me tell you, this was 150% worth the wait.  
The potato pancakes were thick and rich, with a thin rasher (Irish bacon), and a poached egg, smothered in hollandaise...and there were two!  This was almost too much food, since it also came with a side of beautifully spiced potatoes, and a grilled tomato.  The rasher was delicious, and while the eggs were overcooked just a touch (the yolk was just a little more solid than a poached egg should be), I am not going to nitpick about that, because the flavor was delicious, and my friend prefers her eggs this way, so they were perfect for her.  

After our meal, the gentlemen decided to take their Scotch flights to the ""Parlor Room"" which has couches, another little bar, and really cute decoration.  
The Scotch flight that my fella got has to be the best deal I've seen for a flight... 3 FULL CASK strength scotches, and really good quality scotch too...for $20.  To put this in perspective, the Laphroaig full cask was $14 for a dram on its own...so for $6 extra, we got 2 additional great Scotches.  My favorite was the Aberlour.  So smooth!

Prices were really not too bad, especially for being on the Strip, and they do have an email club that gives you coupons, etc.  I received a $5 off coupon just for signing up (although it took a day or two to come through in my e-mail.)

The hostess let us know too, that they offer a locals discount on Fridays, which sounds pretty incredible.  I'm already planning my next visit!  I think the shepherd's pie might be next to try.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,7,3,5,9p2n7oheeKAxH7HWP5lCMw

We saw this place on our way back to the hotel and it looked decent so we decided to give it a try. They have all your usual pub fare so I got a burger and fries. They'd asked how I wanted my patty and I said ""medium,"" as per usual. What I ended up getting was NOT medium, however. It looked pretty well done, and the quality of the meat seemed meh as well. That was a disappointment, but it wasn't a horrible burger, by any means. Service was friendly if a bit slow--they seemed a little slammed with the late night crowd. Prices were pretty typical for a middling Vegas restaurant. Overall it was fine for what it was, but in the cold light of day feeling more sober I probably would've docked them another star.

I tried the Raspberry Cider(x2) and they were Delicious. My friend was extremely excited that they had Heineken on draft for a reasonable price. My friend and I decided to order two different things to split because we couldn't make up our mind. 

The Worcestershire Chicken was decent, it was just a typical Chicken sandwich nothing amazing but nothing bad. However, the Kilcooly was phenomenal!!!!!!!! It was one of my favorite things I ate during my trip to Vegas.  

Oh, I forgot to mention before you get your meal you get Irish Soda bread!

We came back for a breakfast and were equally as delighted with the full Irish breakfast of fried eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, mushrooms and both black and white pudding. Add a side of baked beans and I was in heaven. It was huge and way cheaper than the lesser alternatives at the hotels.

If you like whiskey, they have a Tour of Ireland  for only $16. Prices are decent, and a bit cheaper than drinking in a casino. Perfect for pre-gaming.

5325337,2015-04-11,0,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"Went looking for this Irish pub when I had a spare moment on a Vegas business trip. Did not see any directional signage for it on the casino main floor, so had to ask a waitress to point the way.  The pub is located upstairs in The shops area of The Mandalay.  
From outside, it looks  small, but that is deceiving, as it actually has a lot of depth when you enter.
I recall seeing three or four different bar seating areas as you make your way to the back of the pub.  I chose to seat in the main bar/restaurant area where many families were dining.
The pleasant lunchtime atmosphere was enhanced by friendliness of staff who engaged in conversation with patrons seated at the bar.  There was a soccer game and two baseball games being showed on TV in this main lounge area, The bartender frequently called out the latest score to patrons in the front pub area, where no TV's were present.
I asked for a Guinness and watched the bartender pour the perfect pint, tilting the glass and filling it three quarter ways, then letting the glass sit for a few minutes, before topping off and drawing a shamrock on the creamy white head.
The drink tasted as good as it looked. There has been a massive improvement in the quality of Guinness served in the United States in recent years and kudo's to Diageo and others who have installed great systems and trained bar staff on how to pour the perfect pint.
The menu was extensive and included the customary Irish items; fish and chips, shepherds pie, Farmhouse Breakfast with rashers and sausage, and the standard Irish American dish, corned beef and cabbage.
I gave thought to the breakfast, but opted for the Bacon Hambuger and added a fried egg on top as one of the extras.  
Well, Eat your heart out, Gordon Ramsey, because this burger was as good as the one I had at Ramsey's Burger in Planet Hollywood last month.
Large juicy meat patty, fresh bun, crispy bacon and that runny egg yolk. Oh my!
Think I had three Guiinness at about $7.75 each.  Total bill with tip was about $45. 
Sounds expensive, but the quality was worth it.
Vegas is well served with decent authentic Irish pubs like McMullen's on Tropicana being one of my favorites.  Definitely prefer the Ri Ra over the Nine Fine Irishmen in NYNY every time and will stop in again when I am back in town.",TbT4SkVnOgxBTKrj9FACSw,0,2,5,ILLR43Dgk2S_xX14DfWEcQ

We started a conversation with him which led to great food suggestions from him and great laughter.  The four of us split the beef shepherd pie and the fish and chips.  Both were very good.  The fish was a huge filet across a dinner platter.

And we had beer.  What else would you drink in a pub?  Maybe Irish whiskey.  There's an iPad with all the various Irish whiskeys that you can read up on.  Ask the server if you're interested.

As the evening wore on, the music either toned down or we adjusted with our own noise. The duo was great.  I'm sorry I didn't catch the name.

What did we get? 

Myself - Irish bangers with Mash and Peas. Sausages I think were precooked. Something slightly off. Mash seemed powdered but the peas were good. I got cramps after though so I know the food was off because we were totally fine before dinner.

Wife - Soup (was green, split pea? I dont recall) - got cramps and worse immediately after dinner that resulted in her running back to the room. Very bad.

Friends wife - she ordered risotto and it came gummy and funky. Definately not cooked to order. Sent back to kitchen. She shared her husbands fish which I guess was ok.

Friend - Fish and chips. Seems like the only one to get a relatively safe meal. I guess the deep fryer kills the salmonella or whatever was getting us all sick.

Over all for being in the Mandalay, this place is in serious need of a food inspection. That we got sick eating here is BAD. 

Not recommended ever. Maybe beers. Service was ok, but way too damn loud for a small irish band (coming from a guy who plays in bands no less) in a small space. it was uncomfortable and just kinda lame.",hA19M8xDf3kceTEIidQKmA,2,0,1,vmmx4J31LsZ1ToKZNH6Uvg

First of all most of the bartenders are very friendly. Susan and Junior are amazing!!  The food is really good. I tend to stay away from any fish dish unless it's the fish and chips. Every fish dish I have tried otherwise was way overcooked.  They do have the best fish and chips I have had outside of Ireland!
 Some of their prices I think are a bit steep for what it is but the fish and chips are definitely worth it! My husband is from Dublin and they also have the best Irish breakfast in the city! Their pub fries with malt mayo are so good. The seafood chowder (one of their soup of the day) is really tasty. As a matter of fact I have never had a bad bowl of soup there.  Their chicken finger are actually really good and I usually don't go for chicken fingers. Their wings are just OK to me. I also have tried the Guinness Stew and that was pretty yummy. My favorite sandwich is their Kilcolly, turkey, cranberry mayo, apple and some kind of cheese, delicious!!

The atmosphere is fun and I enjoy their happy hour, but just so you know it's only food on happy hour 1/2 off apps. Get the smokes salmon platter, my husband orders 2!!

 I do believe on Friday nights locals get 20% off. They have a nice selection of beer and a great whiskey list. Ask to look at it, it's nice to look through.

At less than $25 per person, it is one of the lowest-priced teas in town and comes with the usual: tea, sandwiches, scones, and desserts.  

I've done their tea service twice now.  The sandwiches they offer are egg mayonnaise, cucumber and cream cheese, ham and tomato, and Irish cheddar and ballymaloe relish (tomato basically).  It was unanimous in my party that the cheddar and tomato relish was the least favorite and we had plenty of leftovers of that.  The scone was ok, definitely very filling (""doughy"" is how one person in my party described it).  They offer only one of each dessert (per two people), including macaroons, cream puffs, and a jelly roll that no one particularly cared for.  Be prepared to fight for your favorite!  Or split it in half :p  As for the teas, I was wanting green tea on my most recent visit but they did not have any that day.  Instead, I got the Barry's Gold Blend which I enjoyed.  Service ranged from ok to very good on my visits.  

There is definitely room for improvement with their afternoon tea, especially with some of the menu items, but overall it was ok and I'm glad that I got to experience something different from the more expensive tea services on the Strip.  I mean, tea in a pub? That alone is an experience!

The only place I found that beat it out is McMullan's, a free-standing joint near the Orleans Hotel & Casino a bit west of the strip on Tropicana. This one beat Nine Fine Irishmen in the New York New York for the number 2 spot on my list.
The food is fantastic, the ambience is spot-on, and although the place is a smaller than the Nine Fine Irishmen, it has a more authentic feel to it (especially since you can sit at the bar and be within arm's reach of the stage).
The service is top-notch, and we were well-taken-care-of during all our visits. The bartenders and servers are always on top of whether you might need another pint, and willing to offer their own suggestions of what to try next.
They have a surprising number of different libations available, from the ubiquitous Guinness, Smithwick's and Harp on tap to a variety of different Irish ciders I'd never even heard of in bottles. I was very glad to try some new things to compliment old favorites, and I can't recommend asking what special offerings they currently feature enough. Try something new. Live a little, and enjoy the craic.
I was really surprised one night when we popped in for a pint that Derek Warfield and the Young Wolfe Tones were playing. ""Live Music"" is all the sign said, and I about fell off my bar stool when I saw who it was. I was a little miffed that they hadn't really advertised his presence, though I found out that not a lot of people who had come in for ""live Irish music"" that night knew, either, so I suppose that their target demographic isn't the most knowledgeable about Irish music.

The bartender was wonderful. Most of the bartenders I noticed that work here are actually from Ireland.

Now back home we are all drinking the anniversary stout"".

The waitress was very helpful with a killer accent.  The soda bread was excellent and I could have eaten more but didn't want to fill up. I had the potato cakes appetizer which was two large cakes with a vinaigrette sauce.  It was very tasty, it could have been a little crisper, but it did have a light fluffy texture.  For my main course I had the fish and chips.  The fish was light and flaky and the coating was crisp.  You only get one piece of fish but it was a decent size and after the ceasar salad, soda bread and  potato cakes, it was more than enough.  The fries were about the only negative about the meal, limp and soggy.

They have a special this month for Guiness...great deal! 
The goat cheese appetizer was amazing. I'm not a goat cheese fan but they added cream cheese to minimize the pungent goat taste..and with the condiments, so tasty! I ate most of the dish.
Both ordered fish n'chips...regular size. Perfect portion since we got an app first. Fresh cut fries. The fish was perfect and I felt that the tarter sauce wasn't needed.
Also ordered dessert..their version of brownie sundae. It was good and not sickly sweet...but wasn't a Wow for me..but I'm a dessert snob.

They were nice enough to take our reservation. I ordered fish and chips. Sorry it wasn't that good. I remembered way back when my friend asked if my tongue gets spoiled from eating all the good food. I said no because I still enjoy Del Taco and Wendy's. It's not all together true. I'm sure it's not just me but when you tried something so good that becomes your bench mark. You wish you can find something this good and hopefully doesn't cost you an arm and a leg. The best fish and chips I was at Venetian. Fries are so perfected by your McDonalds and Wendy's that it's harder for mom and pop restaurant to follow suit. 

Their chips were fries and they were soft same goes with their fried fish. The fish itself is not flavorful, sigh I wanted to like it so much since I love fish and chips.

For appetizer we ordered chicken wings and it were good only 8 pieces per plate though.

We waited almost 40 mins for our food. The waitress was nice and patient even though I was not. She keep asking, ""are there anything else I can get you?"" and I tell her, ""yes, we like our food"" I was feeling a bit a pressure since I'm the one bringing all my friends here and I wanted us to be served and fed properly.

I tried my buddy steak and it was cooked well, medium, pink, soft, and flavorful. Again it was served with cold, mushy fries. They also serve prime ribs didn't get to try that one but it must have been good since my friend cleaned it up

I like the ambiance if that's how Irish pubs are in Irish I'm cool with it. Love the live band playing Irish tune. I like how restaurant stay true to their culture and identity. 

Pro:
Ambiance
Friendly waitress
Ruben sandwich was good a little much on butter but the meat was done well. Do order the ruben sandwich over fish and chips

Con:
Food takes  too long to get to our table

You should be, as it was a tough go the 1st 100 yards or so, and it was already in the mid 90's. After a mile or 2 I doubled back to Mandalay Bay in search of a Bloody Mary. Whaaaat? Its Vegas damn it. Walked around the casino to discover the bars were not yet open at nearly 9am. Hey! I thought this was Vegas not Des Moines.

I decided to take the air conditioned route through the mall thing that stretches through a couple of hotels and drops one directly across from ""The Trop."" Panic started to creep in as I passed a few more shuttered restaurants. Wait, someone up ahead opening their doors for business. Is it a clothing store or..?? OMG, its an Irish Pub. I thought the heat was affecting me and I was dreaming a desperate dream.

Sure enough, 9am sharp and these Angels of Mercy were beckoning me towards the flashy bar. Some slick looking kat with (presumably) an Irish accent welcomed me like a long lost mate. Feeling better already.

My new mate Tom made me a killer Stoli Mary, and soon some fellow dehydrated patrons showed up and it turned into your typical neighborhood Irish bar kinda place. Yeah, right here in Fauxville Vegas. Especially unexpected in this mall tunnel thingy. 

My intention was a one n done, but my other new mates seated next to me ordered some delicious looking breakfasts, and I was soon requesting that menu that I previously returned to Tom. He recommended the Irish Eggs Benedict, which listed Rashers as an ingredient, and he informed it was the Irish version of Canadian bacon. I just looked it up and found this definition: ""Rashers (n): pieces of bacon; female genitalia.""  Ahem, think I will move on without further comment.

Cool little Irish pub in otherwise dull and bland walkway area between Luxor and Mandalay Bay. There was a band playing, the bar was crowded, and everyone looked like they were having a good time. Some of the staff are even originally from Ireland. I wanted to do my Irish impression, accents and everything, but thought better of it.

I dropped in for some late night eats (10:30pm for an old guy like me) and got the fish and chips, or as someone on Instagram commented -- ""whale and chips."" It's basically one giant piece of fried fish on top a bed of fries. 

*Thumbs down*
While the fish and chips may look impressive, there were a few issues. The fish (cod) was super moist and flaky on the inside, but the outside batter was soggy and greasy. I would much prefer 2-3 big pieces of properly fried, crispy fish. Also, having the fish on top of the chips (fries) was a disaster. Obviously, the chips get real soggy real quick. I barely touched them.

So it's brilliant that they opened all these restaurants between the walkway to their sister resort Luxor.  Among these places is a gem of an Irish Pub, Ri Ra. 

We wanted to get a decent bite for dinner and have a beer, so this matched our criteria perfectly.  We were late for happy hour and we sat in the area behind he main bar which suited us fine because there was a party going on in the main area and it was loud.  They have an excellent selection of beer and Irish drafts, which was great.

I ordered the Shepherd's pie, which was delicious, and my buddy got the Irish beef stew.  He liked it, but said he should have ordered the Shepherd's pie after tasting mine.

I came with a party of 10 - we were instantly seated without a reservation. The waiter was extremely nice and friendly. Honestly, you can probably close your eyes and point at any entree on the menu - it will turn out delicious.

My personal favorite is the Cider Glazed Pork Chop ($24). It's cooked perfectly and leaves you hungry for more with each bite. I ordered it medium rare - it was extremely tender and juicy. The oil from the fat layer around the protein just gushes when you cut through - make sure you soak it up with the meat cause it makes it that much better.

If you're a fan of fish and chips; make sure you try the one here ($20). The proportion of this is just gigantic! I've never seen such a large portion for the price of $20. Not only is the price well worth it, but the fish is just cooked to perfection as well - if cut through with your fork or knife, you can see the moisture retained in the fish.

The Ribeye Ragout ($23) is also very good. The ribeye is very tender and the flavor of this dish just... lingers.. In a good way. It really is an explosion of flavor - from the ribeye, to the mushroom, to the other spices they use.

The Chop Chop Salad ($12) is pretty good. A refreshing couple of bites after eating so much meat. The ingredients they use is definitely fresh!

Drinks here are at an expected price: A beer for $6.50. Long island and AMF for $9.50 each.

When we went in there our last night I was kinda broke. I read on the menu that Jameson was $6 a shot. I got it because it was so cheap. When we moved to out table and got a server a ordered a few more. When the bill came they charged $10 a shot (plus the live music tax, plus 23% gratuity, plus alcohol tax). It was far more than double what I thought I would be paying. I told the server the menu at the bar said $6 a shot. He said no way. I said I'll go get it and show you. He said he'd go get it. He came back with the menu and said it says $8, but our prices go up all the time so you have to pay $10. Slammed it, and walked off before I could ask to see it. So I did. Then as I was walking out I had to look, because I knew it said $6. Sure enough. I tried to flag our server down, and he literally ran in the back. I asked another server to get him. They came back and said he went home. I asked for a manager, and they said there wasn't one.

She basically undersold the tea and informed me they don't seat single people. I asked about the menu and eventually she let me see it. The policy is not inclusive and the attitude of the hostess is a turn off. Rolled her eyes at very basic questions and couldn't be bothered. I was disappointed that they still have poor customer service in the front of the restaurant as once you get inside the staff is friendly. I think I may be eating elsewhere. Lots of places to eat in Las Vegas. Oh, just made High Tea reservation at Veranda at The Four Seasons.

5837880,2012-08-19,3,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"Diane and I went back to Ri Ra and I was very impressed with their delicious dinner special of a Rasher Filet served perfectly medium rare as requested, with a few Whiskey Sauce drizzles on top, a surrounding ring of really tasty bacon, and a nicely grilled potato cake underneath.  Better hurry because this special will not last much longer.  The meat was even better dipped in an additional hot Gaelic Sauce that was brought to the table.  Accompanying spears of thin asparagus were good, and a starter of a hot bowl of Curried Carrot Soup with big hunks of potato was very good.  The soda bread & butter was good and authentic Irish fare, but the edges of this dark bread product are rather rough, and I like French and Italian bread so much more.  

Diane's large order of Fish & Chips was just that--a very large and delectable fried fish fillet.  I enjoyed one moist bite, she ate half of what was left, and then she took the remaining portion home to savor for lunch the next day.  Of course, I finished all of my food in one sitting!  

Service was very good, and I liked hearing all of the Irish accents that resounded throughout the place.  The 20% local discount was the cherry on top for this fine Irish dining experience.

5838785,2016-02-06,0,dWk0mbhj79pK3WBp5oLtpw,"Previous visits were great until the last 2 visits. Fish in the small fish and chips has been much lower quality the last 2 visits making me think they've changed suppliers. Small fish has been a bad tail end both times with hardly any fish and often chewy (sign of bad fish). Whatever they've done, go back to how it used to be. Portion sizes vary considerably depending who's in the kitchen I think and service can be good or bad. Until now the food is what keeps us coming back, if that's now slipping then there is little reason left to return. Also, please tell the girls on front desk to smile. The manager needs to observe them for a while and see how customers to to counter and wait, one girl in particular on lunch time keeps her head down makes you wait a minute or so and then raises her head and says 'yes' sharply. If a manager observes her they'd see how rude and unhelpful she is with almost all customers.",Ek0ceEcvm7shetjIykXobw,0,0,2,guT6c0HxX_4Jjh4kD7tC5g

The Guinness BBQ burger is really good. It has a great smoky flavor and the sauce is great. The chicken curry is really good. It isn't too spicy, but it has a nice flavor.

The staff is really friendly, and the restaurant is really nice and relaxed. I just think that the prices, even for Vegas, are a little high. For this reason alone I might skip Ri Ra in the future and spend the same amount of money at a place that I feel has better food for the same price.

My husband got the Shepherd's pie and I got the beef & Guinness stew.  The portions are deceivingly small, but with all the potatoes, it'll fill you up. The Shepherd's pie could have been baked longer to get a nice browning on the top layer of potatoes. In terms of flavor, I'm glad I stuck with the stew. The amount of meat to potato ratio wasn't too bad.  
I'm glad they had a healthy serving of bread before and during our meal with individual serving size of Kerrygold butter.  I definitely would have left hungry if there were lack of carbs.

The bouncer at Mix lounge told us it was the only place open at 11pm (this is Vegas, why does everything close at 10?! BS...). We had walked past it earlier and decided against it, we were in a sushi kinda mood. 

I am so glad circumstances basically forced us to come here because it is now one of my favorite places in Vegas (along with this amazing, yet magically disappearing, sushi place we found once on our way to the Shark Reef and have never been able to find again *sad face*). 

Food - I had the Irish chicken curry and the mister had fish 'n chips. Both of us being from mixed Anglo-Indian backgrounds; and I, having very briefly read up on the history of Indian cuisine in the UK, felt curious to try this mystery dish. It comes with rice or chips...I got half and half in order to have both! Ah-mazing. And so much food! I almost made it to the end, but had to quit a few fries short of the finish line. Husband inhaled his fish, he had both sauces and loved the Irish one (not the tartar sauce, though that was delicious as well). The soup special was ""leek and turkey"" ...scrumptious! You can find ""inexpensive"" ($10-11) items on the menu although most entrees were around $16-$22 and most appetizers were in the $10 range. It is Vegas after all..

Atmosphere - there was a band playing Irish music. From reading other reviews, I guess it's a regular thing? Good, because it really set the tone, we LOVED it (they also add a band fee onto the dining receipt, very European heh). The decor is amazing. We didn't know where to look and what to admire first! Bathrooms were clean and comfortable. 

Service - Excellent! All the servers were kind, courteous, friendly and very helpful! And most seemed to have Irish accents, we were left wondering if that was a condition of working there: to learn how to speak with an Irish accent. No way all the waitresses are Irish....right? I'm still not sure... anyway the manager came out towards the end of our meal to ask how everything had been. Really nice gesture :)

Their kitchen is open until 12 midnight but they were still bringing in, seating people and serving them up until we left at 12:01AM soooooo maybe that cutoff time isn't set in stone (?).

Once everything was set up we ordered all of the teas and it was surprising that some teas had a lot more caffeine than other ones. Since we all did the afternoon tea it came with Finger sandwiches: Egg mayonnaise, ham and tomato, Irish cheddar and Ballore Relish, cucumber and cream cheese. Home made scones and desserts.
