Ordered the fish and chips and they served it with their homemade potato chips instead of fries like the menu says out comes with. Then argued that we were wrong and that is what we ordered. Strike one.
Ordered the cheese quesadilla, which is just an appetizer, and a dinner salad. The dinner salad is listed at $4.99 and they served me a tiny bowl with a half a handful of lettuce, two slices of tomato, and a slice of cucumber, for 5 bucks! It normally is a nice sized plate full salad as I've ordered it many times before. Again, the waitress argued and didn't even know what I ordered of the menu. Not would she look it up. Strike two
No apology, just a waitress that didn't deserve to be in front of people and a cook who didn't care. Strike three.
Sorry, but will never return to this place. Even after being a long time customer for 20 years. Recent price increases along with a rude, ill informed waitress was the last straw.",2gKWbRWSFWiJDKe_xEzbVw,0,0,1,B11Xe2VdwBB7kAGOe7xe2Q

The menu has some typical bar food and some Great Lakes comfort food as well. They have your typical burgers, fried sides, and salads. This place has walleye ( my dad's favorite fish) and cheese curds! I loved cheese curds as a kid. My friend loved the curds, I didn't indulge as I'm vegan. 

The homemade chips were far too salty for bother of is and we had to brush off a ton of garlic salt to even stomach them. My drink was nice and strong, so there is a plus. 

The service was slow was far as taking out order and filling our drinks. The food service was very fast. This place is slightly smokey, but much better than most dive bars. A lot of regulars were gambling at the bar. Everyone was extremely friendly and said goodbye to us as we left. I would come back here again for a few drinks.

On a day trip to Vegas for appointments and what not, we decided to stop in here to check out how Minnesota it really is. Let me tell you.. It felt as though I stepped out of the desert, and right into a small town Minnesota bar. Being that I've only been out of Minnesota a few months, I literally wanted to cry walking in there.  The first words out of my mouth were.. ""I'm home.""  It's just like walking into Matt's bar on cedar ave in Minneapolis.. Or Lee's Liquor Lounge in Downtown. Or Robs on Knife Lake north of Mora, MN. Everything from the wood paneling on the walls, to the Norseman head (Vikings head) on the walls, to the framed Minneapolis Star Tribune papers, to the poster of Kirby Puckett and the old team photos of the Vikings, complete with a young Wade Wilson, and Archie (Papa Bear) Manning nearing the end of his career. It all screams Minnesota.. One of the first times I've truly felt at home in this desert. Right down to the bartender Steve.. Who is a Minnesota native, and a very attentive and nice guy. He never let my beer, or my girls drink go empty. Although a little disappointed that I wasn't able to get Grain Belt Premium, an iconic Minnesota beer. But what can I expect here in the desert?  Grain Belt or no Grain Belt.. This place is Minnesota through and through.. And we're already planning on going back to check out the other 2 locations, Including a trip to see my Vikings play the Packers. In about a month. Did not try the food, but I'm looking forward to it as it looks like classic Minnesota bar food. Thank you again Blue Ox!

The weathered ""bartender"" was less than courteous, as expected though.  Now I can tell you this.  We didn't have to wait long to be served.  The problem though started when my girl ordered a Pinã Colada.  Bartender had that face that lazy ones make when you order something that forces them to bust out the blender.  Sorry lady.  Then she asked me what I wanted.  A simple Cape Cod.  I swear I was not trying to challenge anyone's vocational knowledgebase whatsoever!  It's. Not a complicated drink.  Just a vodka cran add a lime.  She asked me if I wanted pineapple or grapefruit juice?  Huh?..  My party witnessed me explain the simple ingredients.  The next person ordered a bud light.  I bet the bartender was like, ""yes! Trust the white person of the group to make sense."" in her head, lol.  Then my brother said he was still thinking.  Obviously he picked up on the vibe we were getting from her.  In essence we were 4 people who came to a bar and asked for somewhat usual drinks.  She came back with a great pinã that she grumpily slapped together, huffin' & slightly puffin' during its construction before our eyes.  Hahaha ;) my drink came and instead of a bright cranberry red it was a golden clear pink and she popped open a Bud light.  Perplexed at the sight of my usual Cape Cods new colored tone.  I asked what my drink was?  She briskly trotted over and said, ""you told me grapefruit right?"" lol, I corrected her and she grabbled the drink away and uttered aloud, ""Then why did you say grapefruit!"" the cynical gent I am did not allow me to engage a close ended defense as such.  It came back correct.  We drank, and to mutual satisfaction I'm sure.  We left, never to return again. ;)",ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ,6,4,1,_o7cba9Ddu5nSAY_chYwKg

I ordered the Reuben and omg I think I had a record breaking time for basically inhaling it lol lots of meat and perfect amount of sourness and thousand island. The rye bread was amazing as well.

I was lucky to have TWO servers (Lisa and Cheryl) seeing to my needs and the chef prepared one of the best tuna salads I've ever had.

I have been back a few times and have also met terrific barmaids Nichole and Kim, as well as another fantastic cook, ""short & sassy"" CANDI.  You will like all of them, too!

I kind of ""over expected"" when I entered this place, because I was a regular Monday night diner at the Blue Ox location on West Sahara @ Jones, so I'm used to receiving nothing but the best in food and service.  So naturally, I asked myself, ""Will this location be as terrific as the other one?""

It turned out that it was, indeed.  The food was wonderful and the service was excellent.

My fascination with this place is because of the fact that I attended college at the University of Minnesota (Twin Cities campus) and resided in Minneapolis from 1969-70, then lived in Saint Paul during 1973.  While there, I learned that the folks in (and from) Minnesota are among the friendliest people on Planet Earth and they KNOW how to make you feel very welcome in their establishments.

This bar has a lot of booths and tables for diners in it, thought the vast majority of customers just sit at the bar (as do I). The bartenders we have had here have always been friendly.

The beer selection is pretty typical, with all the big name domestics and most popular foreign. They have a very few craft beers, but they are all common ones you've probably had before if your into craft. Nothing local here and nothing in draft, which is unfortunate because I prefer draft (like most people).

Really there is nothing here to distinguish this place from any of the other, older Vegas locals bars, except the food. Their chicken tenders (as mentioned above) are great and really may be the best I have ever had. They also have fried spicy green beans that blew me away. The prices are what you'd expect, with most meals in the $10 to $12 range. The food is really the reason to stop by here, if you like bar food.

If you are a gambler, the machines are the same multi-games with keno, slots and video poker that you'd expect in and Vegas Local's bar. Most of the machines start at nickel denominations and a few of them are fairly new and offer a wider selection of games. They are generous with the comp policy and will keep throwing you free drinks as long as your playing.

This place is worth a stop if your hungry and want a beer and some decent bar food, especially if you like that Vegas locals bar feel.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,0,0,4,U1ekMHjrW9S-kszVJ5qleg

Local bars are my favorite but this one is different I always feel welcomed. These bartenders are so attentive even when it's busy. Always clean and knowledgeable. I don't get this on the strip.,Grer2CtCAJHhTRzpsuAhnA,0,0,5,DDSEwwe7Ju-_h9kc0T3mcA

They have three tvs for you to watch the game's on and a fully stocked bar.,yS1kK5EGcwatp6D6hFGvlw,0,0,3,iO51LRK9IhsD149cORyGTQ

These bars are family friendly and sedate with a more mature clientele.  They are comfortable neighborhood bars that aren't trying to be something else.",WKaMMaZO5ThNDzJZj2_vzg,1,0,4,3uiuDtRWQ1TybzcIcB6xTA
5764800,2017-09-17,0,LCf4MZQcwgtniQUJ-MQBZA,We just moved to Vegas from MN and needed a place to watch the Vikings. Our first time there today didn't disappoint. Enough tv's for everyone including the game projected on a screen in the banquet room. The service was fantastic for how busy it was during the game. The burgers were terrific for a local bar and cooked to order. We were a little disappointed the cheese curds weren't served with marinara sauce for dipping. Also would be nice to have chicken wild rice soup and maybe MN sushi (pickle roll ups) on the menu for more Midwest flair...,qoxnaciQR_sLCqvHeDfUbA,0,0,4,JyJR7WabKUdO6NxB_wb4-Q
