41052,2010-02-25,0,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"This was my first experience with Ethiopian food.  I went with my boyfriend, who had tried the cuisine once before in a different city, and my roommate, who was another first timer.  

The restaurant itself is unassuming, but beautiful inside, with a colorful lit bar and tangerine colored walls.  The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly.  Like quite a few other reviewers, we were the only non-Ethiopians there.  From the moment we walked through the front door, the aroma of meat and spices tantalized our noses.

We started our meal with a round of yemisir sambusa - flaky fried pastries stuffed with spiced lentils.  One is enough per person.  They're quite large.  The combination of delicate, crispy pastry and toothsome lentils was delightful.  They came with small cups of spicy sauce for dipping, as well.

The three of us each ordered an entree, with the intention of sharing, so we could try as many new things as possible.  I ordered the Yedoro Wot, which is a chicken drumstick and a whole hard-boiled egg stewed in a rich, spicy sauce.  The chicken was incredibly tender.  The egg really soaked up the flavor of the sauce, and was a surprisingly good compliment to the chicken.  

My boyfriend ordered the Awaze lamb tibs.  They were so flavorful and juicy, stewed with onions and hot pepper paste; they may have been everyone's favorite dish.  

My roommate got the Special Kitfo:  seasoned raw beef mixed with cheese and spinach.  It was FANTASTIC.  I'm a fan of tartare to begin with, and this has to be one of the best presentations I've ever had.  If you have any courage in you at all to try raw meat, this would be your best chance.  Go for it.  You won't be sorry.

When the waitress brought the dishes to our table, she set down a giant platter in the center, covered with several pieces of fresh spongy flatbread.  She poured all the dishes directly onto the flatbread, as a communal serving dish.  There are, of course, no utensils.  Instead, the diner tears off pieces of bread, uses the bread to pick up the meat, and eats it together.  It's a wonderful, sensual way to dine.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys ethnic food.

Also worth noting:  the food is rather spicy, but you can order it mild if you prefer.

The service was also pretty good, if laid back.  Our waitress was happy to answer our questions about the cuisine and the menu.

We all left stuffed.  You can't find a more satisfying meal in this city for under ten bucks a person.  Amazing.  This place is a gem.",Of9UCq61gd2ehoN337taKQ,3,1,5,L-kNDVSWcYKK4snlPDuAiw

We forgave the lack of d√©cor & dark room & basic seating. We forgave the dirty and food splattered white curtains next to the booth we seated ourselves at. We forgave the 4 flies we killed while we waited for the sampler platter. We forgave the waitress for such poor English speaking skills that we had to explain we didn't want the tartar from the sampler and wanted just more of the other meats and veggies which came with, all with the HOPE the restaurant would live up to its rave reviews.

The sampler included a romaine lettuce and carrot salad straight out the premixed bag combined with Kraft Zesty Italian Dressing. Is this was Ethiopians eat in Ethiopia? Another meat dish, while tasty, was mixed with more sponge bread, as a filler perhaps? The rest was OK tasting but nothing to write home about or come back to.

289082,2008-07-28,0,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"As good as it gets for Ethiopian food!
A friend of mine came over and I told him that I got a ""something different dinner place"".
He never tried that kind of food while I had neighbors from Eritrea for about 2 years so I have a pretty good idea about their food. (I even used to chew tchat with them - but tsss! don't tell anyone because it is actually illegal here in US :)
We ordered beef tibs and doro wat. Boy... it was plenty of darn good food! I also had that Ethiopian sparkling water (i think it's better than Perrier). 

Bottom line: 
If you never had Ethiopian food before - go for it and start here at Merkato. 
Ask for ""not too spicy"" because Ethiopians like it ""spicy as hell"" on a ""Caucasian scale"" :).
 Also... just an advice - don't drink much cold beer - it doesn't help digestion in this case - go for hot tea or coffee and it'll make it easier for your full tummy :)
I will be back for sure - try more stuff off the menu.

A tell tale sign that a restaurant is any good if you find that the majority of the patrons are of the same culture.  Well, this one was mixed, and really the standard still holds.

I would consider my palate to err on the adventurous side, and I had Ethiopian once before.  The friends who introduced me to it didn't think I could handle a particular dish, so of course, I made sure my next opportunity fulfilled my curiosity.  Kitfo is the Ethiopian version of steak tartar, and I won't lie that the thought of it took some intrinsic strength to order.  Even the waitress at first tried to steer me away from it at first, and then tried to convince me to have it cooked instead of raw.  I reasoned with her that I wanted to try it as it should be.  A different waitress served it to me and said I'd be hooked.  Well, that might be true if only they didn't cook it anyway.  Granted, not all the way through, but it did see some high heat for at least a few moments.  This deeply disappointed me because I was willing, yet for some silly reason, they weren't.  It basically looks like ground meat served on flat, sour-dough along with spinach and cheese.  Using the bread, which I'm a fan of, as a utensil, I tried it in every combination: just meat, meat with cheese, meat with spinach, meat with cheese & spinach, etc.  Conclusion was that in every way, despite not receiving it authentically, it was good.  I'm not sure, even after asking, what spices they used, but it was a delightful combination.  Spinach and cheese weren't anything special, but added contrasting textures -- which I think was the point.  Surprisingly filling too.  Will I regularly order Kitfo? Probably not, but I'm still glad I gave it the half-assed attempt.

Very apparently if you're not Ethiopian by some measure, you just might be missing out on something.  I saw the service is leagues better if you are.  Also they won't tone down whatever you order I guess.  Not a pleasant thing to have to say, but somehow I can empathize.",0c0d6-jwJoAlwMVcOowEQg,0,0,3,jcnyaIH0sfSS6QxQNgc3Qw
446672,2011-11-11,1,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"If you've never eaten at an Ethipian/Eritrean establishment there are a few things you might want to know. First, the food is eaten with your hands using delicious, sourdough-like, mildly elastic njera bread to pick it up. Wait staff, while usually nice, will not be as attentive as other restaurants as a general rule. Be prepared to flag down your waitress if you need something. Know that there will almost always be a strong smell of incense. If you can deal with that you can have a great meal at Merkato.

I like to ask cab drivers who are not native to America where their country's best food is served in town. Not only does it help pass the time, but they will almost invariably steer me in the right direction (pun intended). Almost all of the Ethiopian cabbies say Merkato is the best and you can tell by the number of cabs parked in the Merkato parking lot.  

I've been to Merkato three times now; twice taking Ethiopian virgins (to the food, not the other kind). It is in the corner of a struggling strip mall without much indication that there is a restaurant inside. Upon entering there is a nice little retro bar with a small assortment of liquor.  The rest of the place is made up of dated peach-pink-ish Formica tables.

On all three visits I have ordered the doro wat which is a chicken leg and a boiled egg in unexplainably delicious sauce and the vegetarian combo. I'm an unapologetic carnivore, but I could be a satisfied vegetarian if all I could eat was that veg combo. the things they do with lentils are fantastic. Doro wat is the ubiquitous Ethiopian dish and is done to perfection here. On two occasions we ordered gored gored. Basically, raw beef cubes in a spicy herbed marinade. If you can get past the raw part (I've NO problem with it) then you're in for a real treat. On the last visit we ordered the short ribs which were ok, but nothing special.

Bring your appetite and be prepared for leftovers. I didn't think it possible, but doro wat is even better the next day.",JUa_lw30mOGTjOfKU0UxyA,1,0,4,TXVIPfHki_Sv71BAI7PcMQ

Food was fantastic, inexpensive and generous.  The veggie combo - which we usually order at Ethiopian places - had something like 9 items on it!!!

This place is exactly what I expect and want from Ethiopian dining: quiet, delicious, large portions, and cheap.  The wait staff is always very friendly, helpful, and accommodating, and the food quality has never disappointed.   

I've never had any of the meat selections, but the variety in the vegetarian combination platter is more than enough for two people and it is always diverse!  In addition, some of the items in the vegetarian combination platter change around on a regular basis which makes it more interesting if you plan to come back (and, if you are dining with others, it makes for fun conversations/debates about which items are best).

It is, however, a very slow-paced (but relaxing!) atmosphere, so I wouldn't recommend going to Merkato if you have less than an hour available.",oG6zUYCWKUy46G6foXnMdA,1,2,5,W-U8Y2gH3nNIJ22m_vmZLw

It's located in an unglamorous, partially deserted stripmall (like most delicious LV restaurants).  And then you walk in....and...okay, not glamorous inside either.  Don't even go into the bathroom, trust me, you will be frightened.

But the food, the food.  I always order the vegetarian combo (some habits die hard) and at least one meat option.  The vegetarian combo has a great selection of dishes that includes cabbage, pureed vegetables, lentils and a salad.

My favorite meat dishes are the lamb tibs, gored gored,  and Kitfo. The lamb tibs and gored gored (cubed, cooked beef) are all marinated and served in delicious sauces. Do try the house Kitfo, the raw ground beef.  It may sound scary but it's really just ethiopian steak tartare (I told you i'm a really dirty carnivore now). 

Between two people, two entrees is wayyy more than enough to order.  All the entrees average from $8-$10 and everything is served on injera(the big, bread pancake).  Also, if you don't know, eat with your right hand and use the extra injera bread as your utensils.

Ever since I had Ethiopian cuisine in college in California, I've been obsessed with finding good Ethiopian restaurants I brought friends to Merkato to try out Ethiopian foods. We're all in healthcare and of course some of them were wary of the ""raw"" beef that is presented in their dishes. However, the beef is actually seasoned and safe to eat (but you can always ask them to cook the meats thoroughly if you want to be on the safe side, but it doesn't hurt to try something new once in a while).

I ordered the Kitfo which is a minced steak tartare (tartare meaning raw). It comes with Injera which is a mildly sour and tart spongy flatbread that you can use to grab the meat and vegetables to eat. I love the Injera and I usually try to eat as much of it as I can. The Kitfo itself is a very flavorful experience. The beef fills up your mouth and the seasoning is very distinct and difficult to put into words. Being that the beef is raw but diced, the texture is extremely unique and worth trying out once in your lifetime. I eat Ethiopian food often and I've never had any issues with the quality of the food.

The service was difficult because of a language barrier between us and the wait staff, however we were able to get our questions answered by the manager who was very reassuring to my friends' doubts on the safety of their food (again, I've never gotten sick eating Ethiopian food, so I wouldn't sweat it).

Overall it was a very positive experience and I recommend anyone who enjoys food to try out Ethiopian food at Merkato!",URb6znpCCVzd1kZvugedwg,0,0,5,SXRWB-HnWtnPUQ5EioF3Ww
1106811,2007-12-15,3,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"I decided to visit this restaurant based upon the lone review here on yelp.  Also, my uncle married a lady from Ethiopia, and I was curious about the cuisine.

We arrived around 10:00 on a Tuesday night, and the place was pretty much empty.  We were the lone non-Ethiopians in the joint.

The surroundings were nice, but relatively spartan.  Our server, who obviously saw that we were clueless, was very nice and offered suggestions on what to order.  We went with lamb tibs and a beef dish of some sort.

OK.  Things are going well so far.  I'm drinking my beer, life is good.

The beef entree arrives on a big, metal plate.  There's also a basket with five or six napkins in it.  The food is sitting on this big pancake-looking thing.  No silverware to be found.  WTF????  Where's my freaking fork???

The server, sensing our confusion, unrolled one of the napkins to reveal not a napkin, but another one of those pancake thingys.  Holy crap!   I get it, you rip off part of the napkin (which has a very strange texture, like a sponge), to scoop up the delicious morsels sitting on the pancake.

OK, that's funny.  I'm a fucking yokel from North Dakota.  TEE HEE HEE. 

You can stop laughing now.  Really.  I'm a rube, we get it.

OK...the food was delicious.  A bit spicy, but in a good way.  The lamb tibs were a bit charred and had lots o' gristle, but were very flavorful and had a nice sauce to accompany them.  Very nice.

Service was at a leisurely pace, and the server was very nice and attentive.  The tab was about $30, and I had three beers.  CHEAP AS HELL!

I asked the server what the bread was made of, she said sunflowers, but I didn't buy it.  I subsequently learned the bread is injera, which is made out of a grain called teff.  Who knew?  I ain't never seen none of them there teff farmers out here in NoDak, no sireee!!!!  Wheat?  Check.  Barley?  Check.  Flax?  Check.  Teff?  Um, Nope.

I'm looking forward to hitting an Ethiopian restaurant on my next trip to the big city (Mpls/St.Paul, Denver, etc...) and would return here on my next visit to LV.

1229987,2014-11-29,1,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"Stopped by here with my husband for a late dinner a little before 9 pm last Saturday. Merkato is located in a plaza, specifically located right next to a hair salon. Parking shouldn't be an issue. 

When we entered, no one acknowledged us initially. The guy sitting at the bar was just chatting it up with another restaurant patron and did not notice us. I walked around looking for someone to sit us, which got his attention and told us we could sit anywhere. After looking over the menu, this is what we ordered:

Tibs Firfir ($9.50 prior to tax)- This dish is beef tips made with a tomato based sauce, onions and sliced injera. Wished there was more beef in this dish, but it was quite flavorful. I really loved that sauce and so did my husband. But he did find it odd that slices of injera was mixed into this dish, that was served on top of injera. 

Veggie Combo ($10.99 prior to tax)- This vegetarian combo came with 6 different tasty options on top of a spongy bread (injera). Two of the options I had were potatoes (seasoned differently) that were pretty filling. One of the options was spinach, which was my least favorite (I do like spinach but this was just not very flavorful). One option was made of chickpeas and another was made of lentils. I also got a side of salad with dressing on my injera. Each option was a fun culinary adventure and it was fun to eat with my hands (I am not a newb to Ethiopian food... make sure you wash your hands before eating, especially if you plan on sharing your food with others).

Portions of this food is definitely more than enough to feed 4 or more people. After our meal, we had plenty of leftovers to take back to our hotel room (we had a fridge in our room). And leftovers tasted even better the next day, especially with the Tibs Firfir (which allowed the sauce to sink in a bit more). 

Service in general was not as attentive, but our water glasses were refilled at least once during our meal. The owner actually stopped by our table to see how we liked the food. She told me that she was the one who made our food as well. 

Food truly is delicious and I will keep this place bookmarked so that I can come back here for another amazing meal the next time I am in Las Vegas.",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,5,1,4,5SEuTpQZTH7Dwcb_eaztMw

This trip was for the American Library Association conference, so I was trying to keep the expenses within the guidelines.
I was also of tired of paying for expensive and tasteless food on the strip.
Was tired of our usual Indian place and had a craving for Ethiopian food. It was a bit late so wanted something close to our hotel, so that we didn't sweat within the first 10 minutes of walking.
Ok so the location looks a bit sketch, and for a Saturday night at 8pm it was kind of dead. There were about 8 folks in the place, sad to say 6 of them looked like library folks, and a few others were Ethiopian. There were a couple of women who were sitting in the middle of the room and smoke was rising from the middle of the room and the small of burning was pretty strong. Did not see a vent insight, nor a fire extinguisher either. Apparently they were making fresh coffee and I mean literally. Roasting beans, grinding the beans, and brewing. If you have had turkish coffee this is similar.  
Ordered a vegetarian dish, and combo meat (for my regular readers, this was for me) Apparently for an army of me, as my plate could have fed 3 others. The veg one was just right. Be sure to order the spice powder.  The Injeri bread, some say is an acquired taste, but it cancels out some of the spices of the food.  Food was good and if you take the left overs it taste awesome the next day.
So we decided to have the coffee after. OMG, Why didn't someone introduce me to this 20 years ago when I was in college, pulling my all nighters! Thank god check out time was noon as I couldn't go to bed until 4am!

So after seeing all the reviews here, I definitely wanted to try this out.

I ordered the awaze lamb tips, which the waitress tells me is the spicy version of the lamb tip dish.  And I order the dark version of their Ethiopian beer.  The beer isn't bad.  I decide to try the light version and did not like it.  And honestly, the dark beer really isn't true dark beer.  Give it a try.

My plate comes out on a plate but on top of bread plate.  I was really excited after seeing the waitress bring out this enormous plate for another table with tons of food on the same bread.  The bread is spongy and cold!  I was a little shocked at the bread being cold.  I've eaten at a lot ethnic places that uses bread plate and it's typically served warm to hot.  This was the 1st time I've had it cold.  So obviously, you don't get any utensils to eat with your meal.  My lamb was really tough which definitely took away from my experience.  And I kept on thinking that the meal would have tasted better if the bread had been warm instead of cold-but what do I know?  I guess this is the culture.  Here's the thing that made me not give this place a 2 star rating.  It's really, really fun to eat with your hands.  It really made me want to go back and try the other foods.

At work, my coworker, Tesfaye (I'm sorry if I slept your name wrong) let me try his lunch... He said, just dig in with your fingers. I lOvE that. Just EAT! 

The reason I went here is because Ty is Ethiopian. In the break room, the left overs were flavorful and great!! That one bite made me crave a new culture of food I couldn't believe I have never tried.

Straight away I told my fiance, we're going to eat Ethiopian food. Soon. 

Ty told me which places were good in Vegas. He said this was the best food wise. Couple other's were good, one which has bad reviews on yelp.....but, because this was the best we went here!

Sunday, just past 2pm. We drive into the ghetto strip mall (which I love when it comes to food). People are leaving from the establishment as we arrive. And.. we walk in.

The place is empty. Well, there were two females one older and bitter, one younger and chipper... but the place was empty of customers. 

We choose a table with our son, get the high chair, and wait. And wait... and then we wait. I waaaved my hand, and we waited. Finally we got attention!

YES! We can try authentic Ethiopian food!! This is what I wanted my fiance to try! She went to Hong Kong with me while she was pregnant and we still haven't had this fare. 

The 'waitress'? Comes over. We kind of know what to expect, but still have questions. 
Fiance orders the Salmon. 

I specifically ask what the difference is between their different lamb dishes. Response is, YES, you wont just the one fish? Fiance says YES! She points to the same Salmon dish on the menu. Answer is OK.....ok

My turn, again. I ask for the lamb wot dish? Or more importantly please tell me what the different lamb dishes are... The description's look amazing. My taste buds are going crazy I just want to eat even though I have never in my life eaten in a place that has no customers!!!! (Seriously I don't think I have) 

Answer-Noooo.. just this one... 'server' pointing to the first lamb dish I pointed to... so.. OK I order that.. With confidence for sure. 

But then, the food comes.

My dish comes first. The flavor of the sauce is exactly what my taste buds wanted to experience, but the substance.

The delicious beef with bone stew flavor that they served me was what I expected Ethiopian food to be in flavor, but, it wasn't Lamb!

What did I order? Lamb.

Patti's dish comes...... LOL yeah, you think that's Salmon. She told the server the specific number on the menu of what she wanted. The server brought the fish the kitchen wanted to get rid of.

My fiance is too kind to complain. We should have. The 'server' said ""TRY IT"" ""IT'S GOOOOD""... Patti said... yes... it is...... So she ate her white fish.

but WOW. 

When I paid, the owner looking guy walked away when he heard me asking the question ""If I come again will you give us what we order""?

ARE YOU KIDDING ME? 

Think about this. When is the last time you have been to a 'restaurant' and been served something you didn't order. Entirely.

And ate it. OK. The food was OK to eat. With the horrible taste in our mouth of being screwed over unfortunately. My dish just tasted like a nice Mexican beef stew that I'm cooking right now at home. But, ugh, the fish... yeah... it was deep fried fish you can get from anywhere frozen. THANKS!

WOW.

I guess I need to come here with Ty in order to appreciate it. That's really sad to me.

This dinning experience was actually the worst in my life. It's a zero star for sure. Now I have about a decade of work to do convincing my fiance to try Blue Nile... she's completely done with Ethiopian food as of right now.

Our platter of food looked like an painter's palette, it was so colourful!

To be honest, I didn't know what I was eating at all, as in I don't know a lot of the names for the different items. 
The injera bread was very chewy and spongy and it was delicious. The lamb wasn't too spicy and was full of gamey flavour from the lamb and its bones. The various vegetable items had a great variety of flavours and textures. Some veggies were sour, some were creamy, and some were very simple. All in all, the veggie platter items were all unique. The meat items were chewy and flavourful. You got a new combo of flavours with every bite you took.

It comes with three pieces of that delightfully spongy, and slightly tangy heaven of a bread also known as injera which you can rip apart and fill with as many different combos of food as you like. 

I also recommend the sambussa, which is a lentil-filled turnover of goodness fried to perfection, add some hot sauce and your life will be complete. The best part of all of this, you eat with your HANDS! (staying true to Ethiopian tradition). If you don't mind getting your hands a little dirty, but do love exquisite and diverse tastes swirling around in your cheeks, this is the perfect place for you.

The kitfo (finely chopped raw beef with spices and clarified butter), yedoro wot (simmered chicken dish), yemisir wot (spicy simmered lentils), and sambusa (pastries filled with lentils) were all delish, although the gored gored (beef cubes cooked in a rosemary wine sauce) was the best!

I was recently here for dinner with my sister while on vacation and thought I'd stop by here due to the amazing reviews. The restaurant was pretty packed as we entered. As we were seated, I noticed that we were not handed a menu. So we sat and waited about 15 minutes before being given a menu. We were basically left to sit in the corner for about an additional 20 minutes. I was a little confused as to why things were taking so long. I mean the reviews on Yelp were really good. The customer service I found was extremely lacking, as our order was taken the waitress walked off and had not asked us if we wanted anything to drink. So I had to ask her myself. I told her that me & my sister wanted water and she returned 5 minutes later with bottle water (which a glass of free water would have been sufficient) The food took a while to come which did not surprise me at this point. The food was good not GREAT!!! The portion was large which is probably the only reason I gave them 2 stars. After we finished our meal, we could have basically walked out of the restaurant, I doubt they would have noticed anyways with the way things were going. I walked up to the counter and stood in front of the cashier to pay my bill. She took her sweet time and didn't even realize I was there until one of her co-workers pointed it out to her. From here it took her about 5 minutes to hand me my bill and change. She did not even say thank you when she gave me my change. No tip was given obviously.

So I'm looking through the menu, and of course I zero in on kitfo. The server urged me not to order it because it's raw meat. I try asking for it again, and she urges me to go with beef tibs.  Finally, I relent and go with the tibs. 

The food comes out and I am thrown off by the injera bread.  I inferred what the concept is immediately, but didn't expect the spongy texture.  Not that the bread wasn't good, the distinct sourdough taste overwhelmed the flavor of the meat for me, so I go with picking up the meat and salad directly. I just figured it's really just the same as picking it up with the bread except more saucy.  I suppose I must have sounded crazy when I asked if any of their dishes comes without the bread, but the server did note that some come with rice. The tibs tasted very similar to meat prepared Indian style and wasn't very foreign to me. The meat itself was very tasty and seasoned perfectly.

My husband and I love flavorful/spicy cusine, being Indian American and we loved this place! The portions are huge and there is so much variety. 

We ordered the lentil sambosas to start and they were a perfect way to start the meal( they come with a meat filling as well). We ordered the vegetarian platter to share and wow we could barely finish it. There were at least 6 or 7 different vegetables/salads to try. See the pictures! I really like the yellow lentil dishes. The injera bread was spongy, soft and fresh. It was perfect to scoop all the different veggie preparations. There was also a cold injera bread salad, which wasn't out favorite( a bit to sour and cold). 

It seems like they have entertainment on some nights and they have some tables with authentic table side cookware. You can tell this place is popular with locals( how do you know an ethnic restaurant is good? When you see people from that ethnicity's background as the majority eating there.

2191998,2013-02-01,0,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"The Merkato is unfortunately located in what at first looks to be a small, half-abandoned corner strip.  Because of the non-see-thru dark glass windows, it looks more like a business that has failed, than a restaurant.   The only hints you get are the Merkato sign on top and a partially-visible Open neon sign inside.  The left half of the corner strip looks to contain closed businesses with the Merkato in the middle-right of the left corner.  So ignore the outward appearance and enter one of the two entrances underneath the Merkato sign.

The Merkato sign says Ethiopian Cafe & Market, but I only found a cafe area (behind the left entrance) and a restaurant seating area (behind the right entrance).   There is no market (like a supermarket) section.  The two areas are connected so you can enter either door.   The inside wasn't dark, nor was it very bright... kinda okay lighting.  A couple of the waitresses acknowledge my presence and one said that I could sit anywhere I wanted.  The dining tables had tablecloth covered by a plastic sheet with your basic padded chairs.   There were also traditional wicker-like chairs to the side.  So, your basic no-frills dining area.  It was clean and neat.

The menu had a moderate list of entrees priced mostly around $8-9.  I ordered the number 15, the Doro Wot, which is traditional chicken dish with butter and some spice mix.  After about 10-15 minutes, the entree was delivered to my table.   The portions were huge; I think my single entree could feed two people.   Just to be clear, the dish came with a chicken leg and a hard-boiled egg in the stew-like spice mix, so the amount of meat is not huge.   The huge porton is in the amount of the stew mix (in a medium size bowl) and the injera (sponge-like bread)... I got four of the bread and could barely finish 1.5.   When eating Ethiopian, it is all about the stew mix and the injera, not the amount of meat... the meat is just a highlight.

The Doro Wot was very good.   I could taste the butter but it was not overwhelming like the Indian Butter Chicken.  And there was a hint of spice.   The chicken was tender and tasty.  I can't describe the rest of the spice mix's flavors... you'll have to try it yourself.  The taste is strong because I think the stew was reduced.  (Update: I came a second time, ordered the Doro Wot and a beef dish.  The Doro Wot was very greasy the second time so deducting one star.  The beef was okay, though a bit chewy.)

FYI, you eat Ethiopian with your hands.   Just tear off a piece of Injera bread and use it to grab some sauce, meat, and/or vegetable (if you got a veggie entree).   The server will usually put the meat or veggie entree on top of a spread-out piece of injera on top of a metal platter.   Save some room in your stomach because near the end of the meal, you will want to consume some of the flavor-soaked injera bread that used to be underneath the entree.   I say some because if it is a meat entree, there is a lot of oil soaked by the bread along with the spices and seasoning.   Oil... yummm.

I was so full but kept on eating.  At the end, my stomach burst as I attempted to consume the hard-boiled egg which I had been saving.   My ghost could not rest until I wrote this Yelp review.   Merkato, don't let the outward appearance put you off from consuming some wonderful Ethiopian food which a very hungry college student could even afford to eat.",7E4iVTIsZJu8y_w4_JKg2g,2,0,4,J2zGNDz-lB5rYthC6z6KgA

(This means you already know you won't get any utensils, and you'll be eating by tearing pieces of injera off and wrapping your food in it.) If you're into fancy places with three sets of forks, spoons, and knives, you should move along: there's nothing to see here.

Jon A. and I took the 203 bus from the Strip to visit Merkato for dinner on a Saturday night. Our waitress was happy to answer our questions (e.g., ""We want a lamb entree, but which one would you recommend?""). We went all out and ordered three drinks: mango juice ($2) and two helpings of spiced tea ($1 each). The mango juice isn't fresh-squeezed; it's in a glass bottle and imported from somewhere. But it was delicious. And the spiced tea really hit the spot on this cold evening. It was regular ol' Lipton tea, but they'd added warm spices to the hot water used to steep the teabag in.

We ended up with the house kitfo ($10) and awaze lamb tibs ($8.50) based on our waitress's recommendations. Our entrees came on the same big plate with three sides in total: a salad, goat feta cheese, and stewed spinach. Even though we tried our best to stuff ourselves silly, we still couldn't finish everything, which was saddening to me because we had no fridge back at the hotel to preserve the leftovers in.

If I had to order all over again, I would have voted to order one meat entree and one vegetarian one: two meat entrees felt like a ton of meat for the two of us. (But it was very tasty.)

During the meal, a guy at another table showed off his ability to balance a chair on his chin at two different times. There's also a dance floor and stage off to the side: they probably have special events and musicians visit once in a while. The atmosphere was laid back and friendly, which I really appreciated.

When we were getting ready to go, we asked our waitress if she knew where the return bus stop was. Not only did she tell us where to go, but she also dug through her bag to look up the bus schedule for us. How sweet is that?

The verdict: Huge and delicious portions, sincerely friendly service, and very reasonable prices. I'm a fan of Merkato!

Extra hint: They have a coupon for buy one entree, get one 1/2 off until February 28 this year. (Maybe they'll have another offer on their website after that.) I did have to remind the waitress to apply it after she handed us the first draft of our bill, but she was apologetic and promptly fixed the mistake.",jQ_X7Ob2WB_eH43i_hrSgg,4,0,5,uwrf5Yn9pYdviKEn5v6O1g

The food is quite tasty. We like spicy and they delivered on that quite well. It is a popular place and you will often see many cabs parked outside, but that's not necessarily because of tourists flocking there. It's mainly because of the high number of Ethiopian cab drivers that Las Vegas has. 

If you have never had Ethiopian food, served traditionally, keep in mind that it is served family style and with Injera used as the only food vessel/utensil. Injera is basically like a sour thin pancake/thick tortilla. We ordered the vegetable combo and meat combo.  It is served on a big plate that is also covered in Injera.

Like I said, the food is tasty and I strongly recommend it if you want to try authentic Ethiopian food. 

Now, the downsides: 

It is most certainly not the cleanest restaurant. Though the floor and tables appeared pretty clean, the walls, and fixtures are all quite dirty and dusty. Also, the bathrooms are borderline gross. The men's bathroom had no towels or toilet paper. 

The service is a bit slow and refills on water come once at best. Very friendly though. 

The restaurant is quite warm and they burn incense which is pretty potent. Also, the clientele is mainly Ethiopian so if you're not Ethiopian, be prepared to be stared at a bit by the clientele as you enter.  

Since you eat with your hands, I would expect a wet towel or something to rinse your hands with when you get there or when you are done, but neither are offered. 

Drinks are not served from a tap or soda fountain so no free refills on anything except ice water. 

Overall, I like the place and since we have been twice, I doubt we'll go back any time soon but I do recommend it if you're in the mood for a nice unique dining experience. Just be sure to wash your hands before you get there.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,3,2,4,bQlbYizNdl0ANSDiJ3pUNA

I discovered this place years ago on one of the many business  trips I make to Vegas every year.  A friend and I were hungry, and looking for a place to eat near by our hotel.  We just looked for restaurants in his cars GPS, and to my surprise there was an Ethiopian place near by!   I often eat at one of the many excellent Ethiopian restaurants in Los Angeles, but had never seen one in Vegas.... Until that faithful day.

If you like hole in the wall type places that offer excellent ethnic food, this place will not disappoint.  I've eaten here about 8 times now, and have yet to have a bad meal.  All of the Ethiopian staples are here.   The injera (a type of sour spongy flat bread) is perfectly prepared with just the right bite, and a fluffy yet chewy texture.   The tibs and wat (beef or lamb) are both beautifully spiced and  prepared.  The Doro wat (chicken stew with egg) is also excellent.  The little salad that is served with all meals has a nice dressing, and a little tomato for added sweetness.   All of the vegetarian options are available as well, and are just as good.

Today I had the pleasure of sampling their Ethiopian coffee!  Perfect.  Strong and sweet, with no milk.   They prepare it in a special kettle by hand on a small range / open fire right in the middle of the restaurant.   (not in the back kitchen)  I hadn't planned on ordering it, and I wasn't even quite sure what it was the lady was preparing at first.  It looked interesting, as it is appeared to be quite an involved process.  I asked what she was preparing, and she was happy to explain to me that she was making coffee, and was kind enough to offer me a cup.   It was so good!   I'm a fan of Cuban coffee, but this gives it a run for it's money.  At the end of the meal, I wasn't even charged for it.

The Portions are huge, and the prices are very reasonable.  A meal with soda clocks in at about 10 bucks with tax, and you'll probably have some left overs.  The service has always been friendly, and prompt.   It's a really special place, that definitely caters to the local Ethiopian population.   You'll often see local cab drivers on their breaks eating a quick bite, or Ethiopian ladies gossiping or discussing the days news over coffee.

The incense smoke was so strong that it reminded me of college when my roommates would try to cover up the smell of their ""special rolled cigarettes"" with burning incense. While it can be fun to relive one's college days, this just wasn't for us. I am glad that others enjoy this restaurant, though.",CRzdVtMax8w66L-xVq8dGA,6,0,1,bOvgXTjLeALRh0BKy75KTQ
2931749,2011-01-27,1,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"I almost always get the vegetarian platter because it's delicious, cheap, has a ton of variety, and is composed of different dishes every time I go.  One veggie platter serves two (leaving you either stuffed or with lefotvers), and coupled with two sodas puts you out under $12 (just add in tip).  Just a tip, either accept eating with your hands, or remember that silverware is BYO.

The veggie platters come with about six dishes, always one or two lentils, a split pea (yellow), some kind of green, often either cabbage or beets, a salad (seasoned with a vinagrette, sometimes spicy, sometimes not), sometimes green beans, and one or two other legume based things that are usually unidentifiable and delicious.  I love Ethiopian dishes, they are so warm, savory, and spicy - with complex flavors (I wouldn't even know where to start to imitate it at home), and the tangy, yeasty injera (spongy crepe-like bread) rocks my world.  

My favorites on the veggie platter are always lentils, split peas, anything involving the cooked cabbage (often coupled with potatoes and carrots), greens (sometimes collards, sometimes others, generally finely chopped and stewed until delicious), and anything involving beets (also generally coupled with potatoes).  You don't get a choice for what comes on the veggie platter, just whatever they happen to be cooking up in the kitchen that day.  I don't think I've ever eaten the same meal twice.

Expect the food to be plentiful and diverse, and the service to be friendly and slow (don't expect to be in and out of there in under an hour, and expect to have to ask for your check, and then maybe take it to the front to pay).  If you're even a slightly adventurous eater, like a lot of flavor to your meal and bang for your buck, Merkato should be on your ""to do"" list.",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,3,3,5,NBVLjdVNpEA8xjlvV4SsIA

So I did some research and found this jewel of a restaurant in a run-down mall on Twain and Swenson.

The restaurant is modestly decorated with some traditional Ethiopian art, and they even have a legit Ethiopian coffee experience you can purchase for about $15 I think?  They also had a stage in the restaurant so I'm assuming they have live music at specific times as well.

The food was good, but it's an acquired taste.  The bread was a bit sour for my taste buds, but the chicken was good and deliciously marinated.  Although it wasn't fitted for my taste, I respect the fact that the food was not standardized to appeal to average consumers; It's as real of an Ethiopian dish you can get.  I can see that it may be highly enjoyable after I build an acquired taste for it.

I gotta say the service was wonderful, and that's what earned the fourth star for me.  The server greeted us and constantly filled our waters, helped us with whatever we needed, and even other people eating engaged in conversations with us.  It may be in a run-down mall and whatever, but the people are very friendly.  All in all, it's definitely somewhere I would go with friends or families in town looking for an experience.

It was a cool experience trying out some new cuisine and eating with our hands. We ordered the Lamb tibs as per recommendations and some savory beef stew dish. Both were poured on a large metallic platter that was covered with a round piece of brown spongy bread. You tear off a piece of bread, grab some stew or tibs, and then consume.

It was also a little awkward since we were the only non-Ethiopian people there and we kept attracting stares, so we moved tables to the back and enjoyed the awesome food there.

It's in a run down neighborhood, but that didn't bother me.  Many good restaurants are.  Maybe it was the two people sharing a tiny ""cigarette"", out front, in broad daylight.  One of them looked like a cook.  They certainly seemed cheerful!

The inside was kind of dark, dingy and run down.  Come on.  Replace the burnt out bulbs!  I wanted authentic.  Gee, the flies were a nice touch.

There was some loud, obnoxious kid bothering the other customers.  Maybe it's a cultural thing, but my young son wasn't interested in making a new bestie today.

The sambusas were OK, but a bit overdone.  The crispy outside tasted a bit burnt.

I had the vegetable platter.  I couldn't tell if the individual sections were supposed to be warm or cold.  I don't think they did either, since I kept getting warm and cold pockets within the same bite.

I wasn't a fan of the spongy bread.  It seemed like thin, cold pancakes.

And I know it was just me, but I wasn't a fan of the overall spices.  I much prefer Indian, anything Asian, Mediterranean, etc.  

Halfway through my meal, they fired up some incense, a hookah or something.  The place filled up with smoke.  I couldn't breathe, so I just paid up and left.

Came here with some of my co-interns for dinner. I've had Ethiopian food a good number of times in various cities across the U.S., and it appears that Merkato is only one of several Ethiopian restaurants in Las Vegas. We picked this one due to its Yelp reviews and location (relatively close to work), as well as the fact that one of my co-interns thought Merkato sounded like meerkat and meerkats are cool (true story).

As soon as I walked inside, I noticed the intense smokiness (from burning incense). It was tolerable for me, and definitely transports you to another world, though I can see how it might be off-putting for some. There is also a small sitting area set up for the ""coffee ceremony"" (costs $20 per group according to the menu). I've never seen coffee ceremonies offered at any other Ethiopian restaurant, but it seems to be a thing in the Ethiopian places in Vegas, so maybe one of these days I'll shell out the money and participate in one. We got to peripherally experience a coffee ceremony during our meal since another party ordered it.

The interior is simple and the location of the restaurant overall is in a somewhat run-down plaza. The decorations were appropriate but not as comprehensive as some other Ethiopian places I've been to. 

Service was okay. It took a while to flag servers down to place our orders and ask for our bill, but we were checked on occasionally and the servers were pretty friendly and smiley whenever they interacted with us (one server was noticeably friendlier than others). 

As for the food, I thought it was quite good, though I've had better. The value is pretty great since most menu items were cheaper than I've seen at Ethiopian restaurants elsewhere, and the portions are fairly substantial. I ordered a veggie combo and dulet, and the veggie combo came with quite a few different items. Dulet (one of my favorite Ethiopian dishes) is not always on the menu at Ethiopian places, so I was ecstatic to see it on the menu here. 

The number one reason for me docking half a star off my rating is that they tried to sell us all water bottles when we asked for water. They do have tap water but you have to ask specifically for tap water. In addition, when we paid for our check with credit card, they entered zero in for our tip and said we had to tip with cash since ""they can't enter tip with chip cards."" I eat out frequently and am fairly certain that is a false statement; I feel like they just wanted cash for tip for bookkeeping reasons and/or to minimize credit card merchant transaction fees. Nevertheless, they were willing to split our bill six ways, so I'll give them credit for that.

Overall, a solid Ethiopian restaurant, but I'll probably check out some of the ones closer to home the next time I'm in the mood for Ethiopian.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,2,1,3,Uya9IIgtXpiy3LA59JpDeA

To be more specific and very blunt:
The area is a bit dicey, esp. at night, but the parking lot is well lit.
If you send the kitfo back to be cooked (it's raw), you'll get a hairy eyeball from the chef (normally a woman)--I watched 2 tables nearly get mowed down by her stare when they sent it back to be cooked.
If you are NOT Ethiopian and look Caucasian, you often will be seated away from the Ethiopian and non-Caucasian patrons.  I've been there five times. EVERY time, I'm way away from everyone else.  Once the servers and staff realize you know what you're ordering, the service could NOT be better and they are as sweet as can be. Otherwise, good service but not overly prompt.
I was told by several Ethiopian friends that it's bad manners to not eat all the food in front of you--when my 3 friends and I apparently ordered too much and asked to take it home, the cook came out and asked if we liked the food.  The waitress confirmed, when I asked, that taking food home is a sign of displeasure.  I assured them is was  WONderful but I was full (and patted my beef belly). 

I've had the lamb (beware--not delicate to eat--bones and gristle are in it still) and it was very good, and all the kitfo's but the Special Kitfo (with sweet goat cheese, spinach--I think--and hot peppers) is by far the best.  It doesn't look like much but my boyfriend and I swore it just kept multiplying on the plate.

This would be 5 stars, and my experience has been 5 stars, but I have seen the staff react negatively--never rude but in terms of a glare or a hard stare--at customers who, I think in their minds, should ""know better"" than to send raw food back to be cooked.",S0CoIlPKRmijNgC9v649xw,3,0,4,BZOz853HA9-cClvt5im6xQ

MANNERS
Eat with only your right hand. Very important! 

BEST ENTREE
I had the Kitfo ""Ethiopian version of steak tartar, raw red chopped beef"" ($8)  and an Ethiopian beer for $3.50 and sat at the bar. For $8 you couldn't finish the food and it is very tasty. Take a chance on the raw meat! If you are scared stick with lamb tibs.

SERVICE

BUS: route #203 you catch on the Palazzo side under the overpass to the Wynn. Your 24 hour Deuce pass is also good for 24 hours on local buses. Try to be there on the half hour interval 15 minutes before or 15 minutes past the hour.

DRIVE: Less than 2 miles from this intersection, plenty of parking

WALK: Questionable at night, OK in the day. It is a half mile from the southern back entrance to the convention center. Head south on Swensen and make a left at the 7-11.
   If you walk between the Venetian and the Wynn you will follow the monorail route until you get to Paradise Ave. After you cross Paradise, Sands Avenue turns into Twain avenue and you begin passing McDonald's, gas stations and Latino themed strip malls, and apartments. The restaurant is about 1000 yards past Paradise Ave after you cross Swenson . There is a 7-11 on the end of the strip mall. The windows of Merkato are very dark, but it's near the corner of the L shaped building.",W6rvhtIwQmqTRCYVmyRllg,9,0,5,l8_htMinrs7ijA_5bRNO6w

My friend wanted us to try his ethnic food so he ordered for the whole group.  I wish I remembered everything we ate but the best dishes were the Lamb Tibs and the Chicken and Egg.  The Lamb Tibs were AMAZING!  It came out on a skillet with sauteed onions and some sort of spicy vegetable.  Yum!  The chicken was just as tasty - it literally fell off the bone.  Not to mention, there wasn't any silverware in sight.  All we had were our hands and some sort of spongy-bread-crepe-looking-sourbread-tasting-food to use as a scoop for our food.

4046845,2015-06-09,0,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"Located at the East side ghetto of Las Vegas. A popular stop for cab and limo drivers. When you first walk in, they look at you like deer caught in head lights. They didn't seat me and my boyfriend right away until I told the pretty Ethiopian girl, it'd be for 2, please! Yes, I agree with past posts about a language barrier, vbut it helps to be educated on Ethiopian cuisine or any cuisine that you guys decide to go venture.

I ordered the fresh beef tartar, curried beef, sauteed spinach and feta style cheese, with a side salad. All served on top of a large size engari bread, shaped like a sourdough pancake. My boyfriend had the grilled lamb, beef tartar, spinach & feta style cheese with a side salad, We didn't think we'd get full from their scoop sized portions. The bread helped get us there. No wonder their portions were small, they knew you'd get full with the bread. The flavors were intense. The bread kept coming, the pretty, young lady even looked us down when we told her no more on the bread to eat the last bits of meat on our plates.

The soda's aren't refillable, as they sell soda by the can. I wish they had fountain style soda, cause all that bread can clog your esophagus. There's nothing better that that Las Vegas water. mmm hmmm! Next time we come in, we'll bring at least one more person, so we can enjoy the coffee ceremony. We'd probably order their vegetable platter and their assorted meat platter as well.  

I wish there were half ratings. It was actually close to a 5, but I didn't like the whole feeling in the beginning about them not hesitating to serve us!",eMwXdbCwnXgNpvEAttH3-w,3,1,4,JDio0R4azISs2HwqIKPKJA
4047951,2016-02-19,0,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"So disappointed about the vegetable combo!!!
Everything was served cold. Yes at home we eat the vegetable dishes cold, but when I go to restaurant I would like things warmed up. Even the Shiro was served cold!!
How can you serve Shiro cold??  

Shiro is simple to prepare. Shiro is a staple vegetarian dish. Its basically a stew made from group dried chickpeas and various spices. The Chickpeas give the stew a beautiful texture nutty flavor. It's very smooth and spreadable, almost the consistency of a thickened pureed soup. The flavors that enhance the Shiro are the classic Ethiopian ingredients like the Berbere spice & Nitere Kibbeh( ethiopian spiced butter). 

When the shiro begins to pop(simmer) add the butter throw some  jalepenos let it simmer for about 5-8 minutes than its ready to be served HOTTTTTTT . 

When did potato salad become part of the Ethiopian dish? 
All the vegetables were cold:((( 
We ordered the Awaze Tibs but that was not hot either. I did like the taste. 
Maybe they didn't bring it out right away or it was just warmed up:(((( not sure   
Not happy at all !!! 
Please do the Shiro some justice serve it hot and fresh.

4196287,2009-05-12,0,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"Being a vegetarian convention visitor to Vegas is tough, so I give Merkato Ethiopian Cafe five stars for being tasty, cheap, and friendly to both vegetarians and carnivores.  I've eaten Ethiopian food many a time in Berkeley, and this Vegas version held up pretty well in comparison.  My colleagues had never tried Ethiopian food, but were teff enough for a new adventure.  I ordered the Vegie combo and they ordered the Chicken Wot (a stew with a hard boiled egg that C said was fantastic) and a lamb stew.  While the food was great, the highlight of the experience was the special coffee ceremony.  Our server explained that in Ethiopia guests are traditionally welcomed with such a ceremony - which starts with flame-roasting the beans; no decaf here!  The aroma of coffee still lingered on my jacket the next morning; I was sad to have the delicious scent countered by the noxious odors (tobacco and artificial floral deodorizer) of the casino.  (Grumble - most convention goers don't appreciate having to traverse the casino floor to get from the hotel rooms to the conference rooms.)
As a bonus Merkato was only 1.6 miles from the back door of the Venetian, so we were able to work up an appetite by walking to dinner.  (Note that the neighborhoods traversed are not the greatest, so I suggest eschewing the walk if you're going solo.)  Getting a taxi back was easy: we simply asked the driver who had just finished his dinner if he was available.
The vegie leftovers made a great lunch the next day - I consumed most of it while waiting in line at the Southwest ticket counter.
Parking is easy: the restaurant is in a strip mall.",TJLwIKwwwnn3hVagSimLFg,4,1,5,okM-Kj0m2Y2cyw6-cODhbw

4265703,2016-02-17,0,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"5 Stars - for Service, which was friendly, helpful and unobtrusive.  Went with a friend and her son and we were greeted as soon as we walked in.  We sat ourselves, and after just a brief pause, the waitress was there with menus.  Since none of us were experts in Ethiopian (we mainly wanted to try the ""coffee ritual"") we were the painful people that servers dread - asking for recommendations and letting the waitress decide.  She gave us several options to choose from, and we eventually settled on  Beef Sambusas (if you like indian frybread, you will LOVE this), vegetarian combo (we're not vegetarian but we wanted variety) and YeDoro Wat (chicken in spices with a hard boiled egg).

5 Stars - for Food taste.  Sambusas were awesome (I like indian fry bread and it's similar in flavor, only stuffed with more yummy goodness and a sauce that LOOKS spicy but is extremely pleasant and complementary).  Vegetarian and YeDoro Wat were clearly freshly prepared and all quite tasty. The ONLY problem with the vegetarian combo was the spinach, which was just barely overcooked (not enough to knock off points in the rating, I'm just picky with spinach).  All in all, extremely filling, interesting flavors, and unique textures.  It's probably not good food for people who are into bland flavors or are unadventurous when it comes to food textures (the bread is spongy with an almost fleshy feel).  We were offered silverware, but decided to indulge in the eat with your hands option (which was fun).  All the food came out relatively quickly as well.

3 Stars  - for general beverage selection.  Not very many non alcoholic offerings besides coke, sprite, water, and crush.  My friend had an Ethiopian beer, which she said was quite good.  Since I was saving myself for the coffee experience later, I settled with a soda (don't bother, water is good enough).  Would like to see juice alternatives offered.

3.5 Stars - for atmosphere.  It's definitely a love or hate atmosphere.  For me and my friend, it  was reminiscent of an Italian eatery, with a homey, intimate feeling.  That said, the table was a bit wobbly (which did not detract greatly from the food experience, but was unfortunate), and the neighborhood outside is rather intimidating.  If you're a precious delicate flower, the place is not located or decorated for you.  The interior was a bit warm, bordering on uncomfortable, but not crossing the line.

5 Stars - for Coffee Ritual.  There is something magical about smelling freshly roasting coffee beans, mingling with the burning frankincense, and the delightful anticipation of something divine at the end of the wait.  Roasting the beans, smelling them, roasting them some more until it's just right, then grinding and brewing, with the preparer tasting and adjusting the amount of water and brew time until it was just perfect.... and it was just perfect.  The coffee ritual cost almost as much as the meal (at $20 for everyone) and could have served many more people, but honestly it was worth every penny and then some.  The coffee was served with fresh homemade bread (the bread being slightly sweet, and blending well with the aroma of the frankincense and the coffee), and sugar was offered.  All three of us drank it black.  It was strong and bitter, but not the unpleasant bitter you can sometimes get, more just a strong bold statement of flavor.  You were tasting exactly what you were smelling and it was Good.",HFMNedGJjPTo162-YSwqwQ,0,0,4,ELBVQB3tTsJ7I3hxTCy59A
4286916,2009-01-14,0,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"I have to preface that I don't eat meat at restaurants very often, so I don't think I can give a 100% fair review. 

Mf and I each had a sambussa, which is like an Indian samosa or puff pastry, filled with seasoned lentils and fried ($1 ea). Those were good. I could've eaten those all day long. 

I had the vegetarian combo for $8.50 and it was meh. It was six different items (like mustard greens which tasted like spinach straight out of the can, potato, ground lentils, split beans) served on a large circular platter and lined with an injera, a pourous flat bread. The texture of the injera is weird. It looks like a rubber place mat or a thin pancake. It is virtually tasteless, but you use it to pick up the slops of food. They also dropped a basket of more injera. 

Mf had a seasoned lamb dish. I don't remember the name. He just asked for a suggestion and the waitress pointed at this item on the menu. Maybe the tibbs? He said it was okay. 

We were both clueless on etiquette, by the way. We were totally spying on the other parties, trying to figure out how to hang. We didn't know if you were supposed to eat with only one hand (since Ethiopia is such a Muslim getback). You eat with your hands, both hands are fine. There aren't any utensils. Its accepted to pick up food off your own plate and feed it to your neighbor. We didn't witness that ... but its good to know. 

Service was friendly. Restaurant seemed clean. Although I did blow ass the next morning. I'm always wary of eating with my fingers. Read: wary, not afraid.

They serve alcohol. Mf ordered a mysterious blue bottle of clear liquid called Ambo. Yeah, its just sparkling water, bottled in Ethiopia. Um ... doesn't Ethiopia have poor potable water? We saw a lot of other customers order it, so we got it. I guess people just get it because the tap water tastes like chlorine. 

They have this dance floor/ stage with some instruments and I guess they get down three nights a week. We were not there on one such night (we went at around 530p on a Monday). 

When we got in, there were only two other parties of Ethiopians. When we left, there were like, eight parties of Ethiopians. And there were like, 15 cabs in the parking lot. Awesome. Okay, do I have to spell it out? There are a lot of Ethiopian cabbies in Vegas.

This place may make amazing Ethiopian food, I would not know.  I have been wanting to try Ethiopian food for a long time.  Well, today I got my chance.

I ordered YeDoro Wot, which is chicken cooked in butter and sauteed onions, seasoned with garlic, fresh ginger, and pepper herbs simmered until tender.

So anyway, I decide we're going to be adventurous and take a trip off the strip to a mostly vegetarian restaurant that I've been to before called Long Life Vege.  It's about a ten minute cab ride away, it's cheap and they have delicious fake meat.  Delicious.  While my dad may hate fake meat product, there is nothing the man loves more than cheap (the dude likes to be told how much you spent on his birthday present and if it's under $10 he will be all, ""HIGH FIVE!"" Once, my sister got him a pair of toe nail clippers from Mac Frugal's (RIP) for 99 cents and the man shed a tear.  HE CRIED, HE WAS SO PROUD) so we were in a cab faster than you can say, ""faux chicken chow mein.""  Well, our cabbie was a delightful chap from Somalia who was very affable and talkative and when he asked why we were going to a vegetarian restaurant, my dad said, ""Because this one's a VEGAN!  Hahaha!' and they laughed and laughed.  Good one, you guys!  It IS hilarious when someone is vegan!  HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR.

we pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed.  GODDAMMIT.  we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular.  We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets.  Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I ""forgot"" mine, you dig?  I ain't paying when money bags is around!  I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up.  Plus, there will be no social security left for me when i'm old and I gotta save NOW!  and by save NOW!, i mean buy that new ipod phone because it's SWEET!  do you think it comes in pink??

We take a cab back to the hotel, my dad get his wallet, takes out another $100 from the ATM and we drive back to Merkato.  The cab is $45 at this point so my dad gives the guy what he thinks is $70 because he has put up with our insanity for the evening.  You're saying to yourself, ""Who gives a fuck, Laura?"" And to that I say, ""Wait for it. You will get a mild satisfaction at the end but it's probably still not worth reading the whole long ass review.""

We walk into Merkato and are the only non-Ethiopian people in the place and it's crazy crowded.  Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness.  I order the veggie combo (which was a very typical veggie combo: yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc) and it was MAGNIFICENT.  One of the best i've had and I've had A LOT.  my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle.  now, contrary to popular belief, i haven't always been vegan.  i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat.  tendons and gristle and marrow...i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef.  i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year-old until i figured out i was eating bambi.  ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years-old, then get the lamb and when you're done, have your cholesterol checked because i'm pretty sure you're gonna drop dead at any moment.  

So, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in (that's how they roll in Ethiopia.  Slowly.  But friendly.  Like this review.) and as he's paying, my dad realizes that instead of the $30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him $115 tip.  MY DAD'S BAD!  we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, ""hold on"" and disappears.  two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel.  Major bonus.

In the end, we're dealing with:

Cab rides: $135.  
Dinner: $25 (for two HUGE plates plus two beers and tea)
Average Cost of Dinner for Two People in Las Vegas in Some Cheesy Rip Off Restaurant On The Strip: $200.  

So anyway, I think we still did good.  And there's a cab driver (Yasin!  Holla!) who is high rolling tonight.  Or, you know, sending money back to his family in his war torn country.  As my dad put it, his company is paying and screw those jerkwads, the better man (Yasin! Holla!) wins tonight!  I love my dad.  

I am finally done, you can rest your eyes.  Get up, stretch, do some squats, get the blood flowing...you've been here awhile.",To7EBxWC-Yz011V2-tdTvA,38,38,5,uGnMlAoLzdC2BU4jhzu0Cw
4620238,2011-08-23,4,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"I do not enjoy giving bad reviews, but based on principle, I have to give Merkato one star.

First, I should state that the dining experience itself was good. We enjoyed the food. Being Filipino, we grew up eating with our hands. The prices are cheap. We went with a combination sampler plate for $15, which gave us a great introduction to their cuisine. We also ordered their whole fish dish for $10. It actually came with two nice sized fish and a large plate of rice with tasty sauce.

If you want, you can stop reading here and head on over to try their food. You'll probably enjoy it.

Everything was going well until it came time to settle the bill. I had a TownHog certificate for $30. I had mentioned it before we ordered, but suddenly the server said she didn't know what to do with it. She tried calling the owners but was unable to reach them after several attempts. Strangely enough, when she had me call using my phone, they picked up right away.

To cut to the chase, the owner said he would not honor the coupon. He said he had called the company back in June and told them he no longer wanted to participate. So after sitting there for a long time, we ended up paying and leaving with a very bitter taste in our mouths.

I just got off the phone with TownHog. The representative said that because Merkato has already been paid, she would have to call them to confirm that they refused the coupon before I can get a refund. They've already been paid? That just makes the situation worse. It's just not right. You agreed to sell these coupons in order to get people into your restaurant. That's exactly the reason I was even there in the first place. It's essentially marketing and it worked. It got me into your shop.

It's really a shame because we did enjoy the food. But there's no way I can return based on that ordeal. Luckily, there are other Ethiopian joints around town with similarly good reviews.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,21,3,1,Vpim6TabrseI82FjRf65ZQ

All the dishes we had were very good, and the sourdough sponge bread stuff you eat everything with was awesome. Honestly, I don't know enough about the finer points of the cuisine to offer a detailed breakdown of good vs. bad other than I liked what I had, and it was reasonably in line with my previous acceptable Ethiopian food experiences.

My one complaint is that they didn't have the honey wine that I've had at other places. They did have two types of Ethiopian beer, though, so that was good.

Once we did, they were quite pleasant, but continued to be slow.  We ordered the veggie plate and a beef dish.  The odd bread did not satisfy either of us.

We asked for the bill several times with only the owner coming over to talk.

4974357,2009-07-23,4,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"It's not everyday you get the chance to take a step into different parts of Africa and try this vast continent's food.  However, this past Saturday, we headed to Merkato for some eastern African fare - specifically, Ethiopian.

Located in the corner of a quiet strip mall, the dark windows can be deceiving.  Walking in, you'll notice a bar to the left and tables in the middle with a stage area in the back.  Guests of all ethnic backgrounds are dining (some Ethiopians, and by the end of the night, more non-Ethiopians).  We chose a table right in the middle.

Our waitress brought our menus over and took our beverage orders.  (Unfortunately, no special Ethiopian drinks were available.)  Not realizing this was the Husband's first time, I immediately took ranks on what to order.

* Yemisir Sambusa ""Flakey vegetarian pastries stuffed with spiced lentils"" ($1.50) - We ordered one of these, but I guess they forgot to put the order in for it.  It was just as well because we were so full with our main course that we were glad they forgot.  The waitress did apologize when I brought it to her attention.

* Vegetarian Combo ""Great variety of vegetarian dishes."" ($8.50) - This dish arrived laid out on a piece of injera, which is a large sourdough flatbread and has a bit of a spongy in texture.  It included Injera Salad, side salad, ground bean powder, yellow beans, green lentils, spinach, red lentils, and steamed cabbage and carrots.  Our favorites were the two variations of lentils, the spinach, and the yellow beans.  The bean powder one had a weird texture, similar to baby food.  Overall, everything was really good from the Vegetarian Combo and perfect enough for two to share.

* Kitfo ""Ethiopian version of steak tartar, lean red chopped beef minced, blended and delicately seasoned in hot spice 'mitmita'."" ($8) - After seeing Andrew Zimmerman's Bizarre Foods, we recalled him eating this raw beef and was definitely game to try.  We were so glad we did.  The waitress brought it to the table and placed it in the middle of the injera that was already laid out with veggies.  It had delicate hints of spice from the chili powder, and had a nice taste and texture.  It didn't seem overly meaty despite it being rare beef.  It had quite simple flavors actually.  It was a nice addition to our Vegetarian Combo and perfect enough to share.

A basket of injera bread also comes along to help you eat since there are no utensils for this part of the dining.  (You just use the bread to pick up whatever you want and pop it into your mouth.)

The waitresses were really friendly, although it does seem like they have sections. (Our waitress stepped out for a bit and I think we were forgotten.)  But it also seems like people really take their time here, so there's no rush for you to eat and leave. 

The Husband felt he had a really good first experience with Ethiopian food, which is definitely a plus.  I personally felt the aftermath of the hot chili powder in the next day, if you know what I mean.  

We'd definitely go back again for more kitfo and to check out their other dishes too.  And it's a bargain to eat here!

We were interested in the Special Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony, but it cost $15.  So we figure we'd save it for another day.

Hostess was non-existent.  I stood around for a couple minutes before a waitress invited me to sit wherever I wanted.  But once I was seated, the waitstaff was friendly & attentive.

We got the veggie sampler, side salad,  yemisir sambusa ( lentil puff pastry). 

Side salad came first and out came a huge family style platter. We barely even touched this as it wasn't needed. It was just simple salad of greens and tomatoes oddly with Italian dressing. There was a mixup though and while we wanted a side salad the lady gave us a full size. The veggie platter comes with a little salad so I don't think its needed. 

Then the yemisir sambusa came and for $1.50 is a large pastry filled with lentils. I was expecting a small samosa sized thing. It was pretty good and filling with all the lentils. There was a side of a horseradish-y paste to accompany it.

Vegetarian platter- came with lots of goodies and it was all delicious. It doesnt seem like a lot of food at first, but when you eat it with injera it hits like a brick. We had a cold lentil salad, some greens and tomato salad, cold injera salad, braised cabbage and carrots, red lentil, yellow lentil, collard greens, curry paste. With the platter and the yesmisir sambusas the BF and I were full and we would definitely order that again and skip the salad. 

Service was just OK. There was plenty of waiting around after eating for a box and then it was a long wait for a check to come to us. It seemed usual so don't expect a speedy place.

I just I gave this establishment a 1* for the following reason.  Lets make this in bullet point form.

1.)  After we sat down, we got our menus 10 mins after and it wasn't busy.

2.)  Food takes a while to prepare.  Maybe my hunger just made my impatience stronger because it seemed like forever before we received our orders.  But that's probably normal.

3.)  Decoration was minimal. There wasn't much thought into making the restaurant look appealing and welcoming.

4.)  Lastly, the owner doesn't seem to care about customer service or whether people will want to come back or be given a bad verbal review because when we presented our coupon for the meal,
(a) the server didn't know how to use it or what it was which only means the owner doesn't communicate things like that to his employees.
(b) when she called the owner to find out how to use it, he wouldn't pick up the phone.  She dialed almost 7 times. It took my cousin to use his phone, a different number, for the owner to pick up.  Obviously, employees calls aren't important but unknown numbers are.
(c) he subscribed to the coupon, my cousin paid for the coupon, and the owner wouldn't accept it.  The coupon was purchased for $15 and worth $30.  Our bill came to $31 and some change.  We ended up having to pay because the owner wouldn't accept the coupon he obviously agreed to. 

The only reason why I'm even bothering to give a star is because the food was really good.  The cook was great in preparing our dishes and for the server who was helpful and sweet and patient with us. 

Moral of the story, as great little businesses are, one of so many sometimes forget that customers will talk to other people or blast a review in yelp about the awesome or awful experiences we have in establishments.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,6,0,1,kg7Sh-GXWe2jWuz971ieuA

5199002,2010-03-20,7,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"Ethiopian bread (injera) perplexes me, but based on my limited experience, Merkato has some de-lish perplexing bread. Seriously, I have not come to terms with the spongy, cool texture of the bread or the fact that I have to use it as my utensil, but I grant that perhaps my taste just has not evolved. After all, some things just take time and repeated exposure. Right?

Beyond the bread, which I really can't fault them for given that they didn't invent it, Merkato is quite brilliant. I went with some of my favorite artists last night. It was their idea, and I must commend them for that. It is located in a semi-abandoned strip mall that also houses Bagelmania. When we pulled up we knew we were in good hands because the lot was filled with cabs. Generally, you can always follow a cab to a cheap, succulent meal. 

The interior is not fancy, but it is welcoming. The artists in the group really dug the lighting behind the bar. We were greeted promptly with a smile. Service was a little slow, but I did not mind as we were talking. I actually appreciated the casual, kind service because I in no way felt as if we were being rushed out of there. These servers were so nice, like mom-nice. No attitude at all. 

We only ordered two dishes, a vegetarian sampler and a chicken entr√©e. I was expecting the server to push us into a third item, but she simply smiled and said: ""Yes, that is a lot of food."" All of the dishes were flavorful. I especially liked a cool lentil salad and a slaw dish (beware: that one is spicy). They were happy to bring us refills of ""the bread"", and with just two dishes, we all three had enough. The total was like $20, and that included a beer! If you are on a budget, you better consider adopting a Merkato diet, as this is a little money for a lot of kibbles. 

Other bonus points: They are open until 2am, and Tuesday-Thursday they have live music and dancing. 

I am not sure if I love eating with my hands, or if I am a total convert to Ethiopian food, but I have a feeling that if you are a hands-on person with a thing for Ethiopian, you'll be in finger-licking heaven here.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,14,13,4,hCIng9I2638YiqvBDFQrlA

I knew going in that this cuisine was friendly towards those who have dietary restrictions or are vegetarians. Merkato offers a vegetarian plate that can easily serve two people. The meal comes out on a large platter lined with the traditional bread and eight generous samples of different items. There were two styles of lentils, sauteed cabbage and carrots, spinach, a lettuce and tomato salad, a chilled salad using the injera bread, and two types of paste. It is enough food for two grown men to leave satisfied. At first we were surprised by the injera because it was cold to the touch, spongy, and then when eaten had a strong sour taste. After the initial shock, it did not hinder us from ripping at the three large rolls that came with the meal. The fun in eating is finding the best combinations of flavor. The two curry-esque powder items were good on their own, but when mixed with the spinach or the cabbage they were even better. The lentils had an al dente texture and were my favorite.

The service is ultra casual and chill. This place is by far my favorite ethiopian restaraunt, and I highly reccomend it. The spice is perfect n the raw beef is delicious! Worth your hard earned $.

I went there once and since I had order the lamb medium as in spice level goes, I decided to give them a break and this time ordered extra spicy lamb. Guess what? It was not at all hot.

Some other server came to ask me how the food was and I informed her that I had ordered hot and I got extra mild and the waitress said I understand you and then just wanted away??

English is not what these guys speak and the service is pathetic.",S2ygaci0w6EM0tuQU_erwQ,0,0,2,QQUqFC29DrtZjMhwTV6aoQ

We went with an Ethiopian friend of ours which made the experience SO much better because he explained everything in detail, reasons why things are done a certain way and he had a great rapport with the owners and many customers in the place.  We felt like we were on a tour or something..it was great!

We all shared the vegetarian dish with the beef tibs.  Oohhh the beef...soooo tasty!  Everything was delicious right down to the Amoeba water which is their version of Pellegrino.  Planning to do the raw beef dish next time.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,11,9,5,aiyIAfTl8xyFHmd4wJwEiQ
5586751,2011-07-06,0,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"I wanted to like it. I really did.

A friend and I went in here based on the Yelp reviews she read and, never having ethiopian cuisine before, we were excited for the experience. 

The flavors could have been good, but the food was gritty, hot food was cool, cool food was warm. We're not texture freaks usually, and we knew that it was a new cuisine for both of us... but this couldn't be right. The bread didn't scare us, the idea of no silverware was fine, and the various textures/preparations on the meat dishes were a welcome change (and, we hoped, an exciting new experience). 

We talked to the waitress who explained some of the preparation process. The idea of the mortar and pestle are cool - I love people who still use those - but grit in the food? Not so much.

We tried a combination platter and a few other things to make sure we were getting a broad spectrum of flavors and techniques. Overall, we liked the idea behind it and found some stuff we liked (the spice and flavor profiles were new to us and we enjoyed them!), but the grit really overshadowed what could have been a decent meal.

Adding to the ""meh"" is that the place just seemed dirty. Not old and well used, but dingy and in need of a good wipe down. 

Two pluses, which helped push this to a 2 star review... (A) Coffee and teas. I don't know what it was or how it was done, but it was all strong, flavorful, and hit the spot. (B) Price. We ordered enough food to feed two tables and the tab was barely $20.

Going back is on the table, so to speak; we have considered another go to see if it will be different/improved. After finding Blue Nile, however, I would be hard pressed to go back to Merkato if I didn't have to.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,3,0,2,GWR4ZwYihK4DilPrJIACqw
5604095,2015-09-03,2,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"My first time trying out Ethiopian restaurant, a friend raved about it, so I decided to go for it. 

 First tip- research what you are getting into. I'm an adventurous eater, but I don't like breaking protocol so I looked up some videos about eating Ethiopian food and was really warmed by the concept of family truly sharing a meal. Long story short- you eat with your hands, rolling bits of food into pieces you tear off a giant sourdough pancake- injera. And apparently it's totally ok to enthusiastically shove food down your loved ones throats and they have to be ok with it, or you can act hurt for the rest of the evening. 

 So the way it goes is, your food will arrive on a platter. If you order multiple things, they will still arrive on the same plate, so don't go in there saying- Bobby will have chicken and Ruby Sue will have ground beef tar tar. Coordinate. Act as a considerate, caring unit. Agree on a few things everyone wants to eat, and order. You'll be cooperatively eating it off the same plate with your hands anyway. 
 The flavors, in my opinion, have universal appeal. Nothing super weird or terribly spicy,  something for everyone, and they will gladly cook your food the way you like. We always get vegetable platter (spinach is the best) and either fish or beef.
 The portions are enormous. I've been there twice and both times ended up with giant to go containers at the end. Prices are also incredibly reasonable. 
 Liquor left some to be desired. Beer choices are ""light or dark"", all bottles. Mercifully, they have Ethiopian beer, so at least you don't feel like you are better off in the liquor aisle at your local grocery store. I like different! 
 There are some quirks. At the end of the day, it's an ethnic cuisine experience with much of clientele being Ethiopian patrons. Some people said incense smell was strong- I didn't even notice it. My family griped about bathroom cleanliness and the fact that they had no wet napkins provided at the beginning of the meal. Yes, that's a miss. I told them to lick themselves clean. 
 The decor is very casual eatery like, which is fine by me, but don't expect plush couches, silk curtains and belly dancers. It's a family place. Speaking of family, I visited again, this  time with my 11 year olds. Because I like showing them different cultures, and I thought they'd get a kick out of eating with their hands. It went well, my son actually enjoyed it more than my daughter, who's a fussier eater.

 There's also an elaborate coffee ceremony, according so some accounts, but I chose beer ceremony instead. 

 Altogether, a fun experience worth checking out. The world doesn't run on ""build your own pizza"" alone.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,1,1,5,gdyAfGXXM5wyAHilrlY_ig

I was only a touch concerned that he might be off-put by the exterior of the restaurant located in a seemingly half abandoned strip mall.  Fortunately, Merkato pulled through for me with their incredible food.  

In total, the entire group totaled 8 people.  We ordered two of the vegetarian platters, 6 lentil sambosas, and chicken, fish, and lamb dishes(I believe the protein dishes were tibs).  Though everything was good, the group favorite was the lamb.  No protein was dry. Even the fish dish was perfectly cooked with a crust on the outside and moist on the inside.  The vegetarians platter came out no more than 15min after ordering (so you know that not everything was ready made and just plopped on the platter.  Then the proteins came out.  The waitress squeezed the meats between the veggies on the injera platter.  Lastly, came the basket of injera. 

Now if only they would serve tej and mushroom shiro!

- exactly what i expect from a veggie platter. everything was good and fresh except  for one of the sides.  I suspect this was a filler, it was cold mashed injera with salad dressing...horrendous.   The injera was by far the best i've had.  very consistent texture and not to dry or moist.  this dish could be shared by 2 people.

Beef
- it was super fresh and was scooped right of a sizzling platter onto our dish.  pretty lean meat with minimal flavoring.

Injera refills were quick and without question. they tried to sell us bottled water but you can ask for tap.

this was probably the most legitamate ethiopian place i have been to, the staff was clearly african (rather than african american), there were home-made looking music videos on screen, and the food was rather good.",M0mONsg1ZJIKA30ad1qE1w,1,1,4,UdSU4J9b2crnkE5-26OBeg
5879427,2010-03-08,2,-BmqghX1sv7sgsxOIS2yAg,"This was my first Ethiopian meal but will definitely not be my last.  I really appreciated the reviews on this restaurant as it helped us to decided which one to chose.  This place was comfortable and we were able to grab a spot against the wall by the 'dance floor' secluded enough for good conversations.  We got there at 5pm on a Friday night and stayed for a little over two hours.  We never once felt rushed or abandoned.

We got an appetizer of puffed pastry with lentils and ordered one for each of us but could have easily shared a single one and saved the room for the main meal.  For the meal, we ordered the veggie combo and went with the server's recommendation of a lamb dish and decided to go spicy.  I found the food delivery to be very fun and even though we were served forks, chose to use the bread for sopping up the food.  The lamb was excellent and we were fighting over the juice-soaked bread after it was all gone.  If you're into Indian food then you'll be happy with cuisine too.

The service was friendly and efficient and the price was unbeatable.  We got a few beers, two appetizers and two main courses for just over $30.  The one downer was the bathrooms, which to me say a lot about a place.  It was good enough, there was paper and soap and they appeared to be clean...but the doors and walls were filthy.  This bugged me but, not enough to keep me away.",W36hPAvKxSm03Rpvo8eQJg,1,2,4,rjcQBm5H4vtdQLgXDWu0vQ
