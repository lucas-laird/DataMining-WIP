Giving with everything, friendly, and just a great experience. I will try and only go in there when he's there now.",43OClbvEv9HaY1oEaNA5IQ,0,0,5,ZytyJDcR4csYJq0n0G2F4A
848451,2015-12-29,0,AHnvBkGTNlpAVTmg-k0Bsg,Disappointed with the amount of food I got on my sub.  I ordered a turkey sub and got a few slices of meat. Then when I asked the worker for extra onions she gave me the smallest pinch of onions.  That's when I asked for more but the next time she gave me a dirty look and put about 2 more onion slivers in my sub. Before at other locations I would get a whole handful. I didn't understand why she was being so stingy with the onions. I asked for extra onions but I ended up getting hardly any.,X2WVXFHKYhIjY83pm0Pe5g,0,0,1,RVoNRrX9VmDm0-CN4yzkQA

Although there were three annoying things that  happened at this Subway, I wasn't going to make a public complaint until I opened the sandwich at home.

1. I was about to get the last bit of tuna in the tub, so I asked if there was a fresh one. The guy says ""It's from today."" This was now 4:30 pm. But, he did replace. 

2. I asked for swiss cheese. ""I don't have that today."" 

3. I asked for cup to get water. ""I don't have water. The machine is broken.""

I bought the sandwich. When I got home and took sandwich out of the bag, it felt wrong. See photo. Yep, the supposed 6 inch sandwich was just 5 inches!",eqmp2iHoxN4j1LSXD9zzUQ,0,0,1,J3siLYZksep7ZRcwDoA0Jg
2224780,2016-02-02,0,AHnvBkGTNlpAVTmg-k0Bsg,I enjoy coming here for great fresh food. Their service is fast so you can come to this location when you are on your lunch time. The subs are healthy which is a huge plus especially if you want to stay healthy.,qUYBE9JDV5X7DO3i7zgt4w,0,0,5,H_Z8AfKSpoeSIkxlWRIWdA
2492146,2017-09-10,1,AHnvBkGTNlpAVTmg-k0Bsg,"Generally a good place to eat until they hired Jhoana. She served me moldy bread and i did not find out until i ate most of the sandwich. When i confronted her about it all she had to say was ""sorry about that"" and made no effort to reconcile. Beware eating at this restaurant when she is there. Jhoana is as brain dead as they come.",3LTEsrbztAcxBOALKqq0IA,0,0,2,CS9kNbxKovOMF9hpIr0Lhw

3684290,2018-03-24,1,AHnvBkGTNlpAVTmg-k0Bsg,Friendly staff and good food but no public restrooms. In a city that already has a problem with feces being all over the place they can't even provide a place for a paying customer to wash their hands. Shame on them! Okay I had to update my review because when I walk out of the subway I literally saw s*** stains on the sidewalk on the side facing Flamingo Road.

This is bad for business I've been there 3 times trying to get a sandwich and every time it was the same story. No urgency to fix the problem, what makes them think I want a cold sandwich that's suppose to be hot?",3h_ru__tDbiLtiV47eAMFA,0,0,1,O_YetpsVcVwicvZ1FROJtg
5345919,2015-01-15,0,AHnvBkGTNlpAVTmg-k0Bsg,"I have to admit, Subway does fulfill my sandwich craving on rare occasions. I like that they toast the bread, unlike some of the other big sandwich shops. The cookies are pretty good. And the $6 combo is a good option for a cheap lunch. 

But I have to subtract a star for how miserable everyone who works here seems. Do any of these people smile?

My cheap Subway lunches are reliably good and the service, while not the friendliest, is quick. I can be in and out of this place in a matter of minutes, even around the weekday lunch rush.",rNjgVKaBh1PlUA6dYB6EUw,0,1,4,4V6e6BFsvfxC54CjIKHMEw
