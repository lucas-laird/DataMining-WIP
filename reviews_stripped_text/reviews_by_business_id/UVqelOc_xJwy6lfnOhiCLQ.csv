922015,2011-08-27,1,UVqelOc_xJwy6lfnOhiCLQ,"The food is great.  My favorite is the carne asada.  Anything you eat will be good, except for any vegetarian adaptations.  I order some bean and cheese tortas because I was not in the mood for meat and one cook made it good while another cook did a horrible job.  I could've done better at home.  If you stick to what is on the menu you should be okay.  The place is really small so if you're claustrophobic or come with a group you should order to go.  Portions are good and everything is fresh right down to the sauces in the mini bar.  Like Mike said, the shopping center is in a bad location so come early.",5GPJYhFS9h71eb2Ow7Gj5w,2,0,4,4f0fsYvLsOvLX1oUgiVUQA
1901277,2013-07-08,1,UVqelOc_xJwy6lfnOhiCLQ,I come here almost every weekend. I love the food! Plus it's inexpensive as well. The food is freshly made. The beans are cooked from scratch. I only get the boiled ones lol! The menudo is a great hit on the weekends. The cooking is consistent since it's the same two cooks from ages ago. On occasion you might see a new cashier.,-frBmh8tZDGwezlH5tyXiA,1,1,5,iPrk2p40sG1QL-mnMWVtHA

I've had nearly everything on the menu. The neighborhood isn't so nice that's why they've recently changed their hours but nevertheless the food is GREAT! I would suggest the huarache, the pastor tacos and honestly, anything else !!",0c2t3jdhzk-TXfj4cge4NA,1,0,5,DTkZHKeCexGQenmObwlpbQ
2716905,2015-07-12,0,UVqelOc_xJwy6lfnOhiCLQ,"Consistently great tacos, but you'll drive right past El Tizon if you're not careful.  The tacos are wonderful: hot and fresh.  You can get them individually with your choice of carne asada or chicken (of course), but be especially sure to try the tacos al pastor with everything.  Hungrier than that?  You can also get plates, burritos, nachos, menudo etc.  The menu is surprisingly large for such a small place.

The price is definitely right and the staff is always friendly.  If you work or live on the north east side, be sure to swing by.  El Tizon may just be your new favorite place to grab tacos.  Oh, and your taste buds and wallet will thank you.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,1,0,4,JSfoR5r3uSD5DhpPmxgkCg

In A Sentence
It's way better than anything else around here. (There ain't much.)

Quick Review
+   Great location within striking distance of CSN North Las Vegas.

+/- Food is alright. You aren't asking anyone to freeze it and ship it to you via courier service if you are in Antarctica with Cathy C. 

-    Restrooms are atrocious. Worse than the worst truck stop in Arkansas. 

Employee of Excellence 
María. Someone in there must be named María.

Pro Tip: Find it in the CitiTrends, Family Dollar, Super Pawn, O'Reilly Auto Parts-anchored shopping centre, next to Domino's®.

Pro Tip: One of the fast food places that actually have desserts (in the desert). Pide el flancito.

Pro Tip: No hay cerveza. 

It's alright. You get a shitton of food for a relatively small amount of money. No pesos accepted. 

They've always treated me well here. It's a small place; not a lot of non-Spanish speakers coming through. Everyone is welcome though.

Get the pollo or asada. Be kind, rewind. 

No tourists here and that is fine. It's pretty far from the strip after all.

Not good for kids*. (*Unless your kids are Mexican.)

Get some guacamole too, which they serve in a styrofoam coffee cup. Wash everything down with a mandarin jarritos mexican soda, and you'll be golden! This place is the bomb, and reasonably priced. Sketchy shopping center though.",z-xURZKh4i-OnIzBN3cK_Q,8,4,5,L0mmOlkB-f3Z1OYZi1D6QA
4044396,2015-03-23,0,UVqelOc_xJwy6lfnOhiCLQ,"Great tacos, quick service cheap prices. It's tough to find quality lunch options in north town (that aren't Chipotle, Five Guys, etc!), so I'm always happy to hear about any locally-owned joints in the Nellis area. 
The burritos here are really popular, but they're too huge for me, so I stick to the tacos. Steak, carnitas, asada are all delicious, but the standout is definitely the al pastor. If you're in the area, El Tizon is worth a look!",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,1,0,4,T4OkVz65fjoh9GP-YYnz3Q

When you first walk in the place is small and doesn't really look all that clean but decided to try the place out regardless. The staff was okay, asked what she recommended and just gave a stereotypical answer of the 'Carne Asada Taco'. Decided to try them out by adding cheese as a twist. The cheese ISNT real cheese and just looks like plastic. The salsa is terrible. Overall the meat was okay. Tried the Carne Asada, Pastor and the Grilled Chicken.
