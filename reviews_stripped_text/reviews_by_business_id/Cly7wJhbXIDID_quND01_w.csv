We browsed the menu and made our selections, which wasn't easy because everything looked so amazing. The avocado toast was hearty with perfectly cooked eggs on top. Only suggestion my husband had would be to add a few fresh tomatoes, I could go either way with that. 

I ordered the Mother Earth with Salmon (5/5) and my partner ordered the Strawberry Fields with no additions (5/5). On the side we tried the Spicy Japanese Eggplant (top of our list!).

Next, you pour your drink at the self serve station and grab your utensils before selecting your table. 

Pros - Fresh, healthy food at extremely reasonable prices. We had quick and friendly service as well. The menu has a wide variety of options for health conscious folks. In addition, I liked that there were both indoor and outdoor seating options. 

Cons - For beverages there's really only tea, lemonade, water and a limited selection of alcohol. Personally, I like a few more beverage options. Another ""con"" I thought was that you tip your server before you are even ""served"" due to the fact that you pay first. I like tipping after my meal as I gauge my tip on the service I receive. 

Overall, it's a great new spot and I will certainly return. Our food was fresh and tasted great --- not to mention you can't beat the reasonable prices!",UGlYryF2DKbmBhTa7kq5WQ,9,6,4,qbeFI7jedlelLtfIg_Rdzg

Touting themselves as locally sourced, all natural (a meaningless marketing term anyway), and healthy, this ""new age-y"" eatery has many challenges. My biggest peve... their menu says, ""Our proteins are naturally raised... because happy food makes healthy food.""

Me to manager: Is the salmon farmed or wild caught?""

Mr Manager: It's farmed.
Me: How is this natural? How is a constrained fish a happy fish?
MM: The fish are raised in their own environment. They are just restricted.
Me: Seriously? Ok, now you're just spinning words. I'm sure the restricted salmon are not ""happy"" salmon.

A note. The server asked if everything was ok. I showed her where it said ""naturally raised"". Her reply was word for word the same as the manager. Someone was coached.

The noise level was almost an intolerable cacophony. No sound-proofing materials on walls or ceilings.

So now the niceties. A lovely atmosphere visually with lots of pastels and artsie pieces. The patio is large and airy. The selection is varied.

I came at 6pm hoping I wouldn't catch the dinner rush, there was no line and ordering was simple. I opted for the mix and match with grass fed steak, corn quinoa and a side of tofu. They have a little area with their own house made drinks and I was interested in trying them. I went over to the drink area but none of the flavors sounded appetizing but I did try the watermelon mango lemonade. The drink was okay but not a wow factor. The food came pretty fast but one at a time, I feel bad waiting for the other persons food. The avocado toast came and the presentation was off, it also needed a little more flavor. When my dish arrived I was SHOCKED at the portion, I had seen pictures online and it was way smaller than I even imagined. I could eat my steak in one bite! The corn quinoa was flavorful and paired well with the steak. As for the tofu, it had a weird texture and did not have any flavor, which is upsetting because I love tofu anything!

The fresh, healthy menu is perfect for hot summer days and anyone who cares about what they put into their bodies. They have tons of options for customizing orders or compatibility with specialized diets, with vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free logos on the menu, making it easy for everyone. Location is super cute and staff are helpful and friendly- when the line is out the door (their lunch rush is no joke!), they expedite by reserving tables in advance. 

So far, I've liked everything I've tried- the Strawberry Fields salad is fresh and I love the addition of mulberries, the Thai Dye wrap with spicy tofu is perfect for Meatless Mondays, Skinny Cobb tastes better than the full-guilt versions elsewhere, and the avocado hummus is a must-get every time. Check out the bowls and plates if you have a heartier appetite.

Flower Child packs a punch in the flavor department. In spite of the tastiness, the items are generally light and feel-good in nature, so you leave feeling good about what you ate. The portions are a little on the small side, but that tends to be the norm with food in this vein. An adult is typically going to pay $17 - $23 for food, if you're looking to fill up on a normal size meal, though you could spend as little as $9 - $13 if you're eating extra-lite. 

Flower Child offers assortments of salads, bowls, wraps, and build-your-own plates. Lots of California, Asian, and Mediterranean influences are found throughout the menu. You could easily come here over and over again and not get tired of the food, based on the numerous options available. The menu is also clearly marked with Vegetarian, Vegan, and Gluten-Free options to make those choices easy to find.

My love and I came in with our girls and one of their friends. We order:
- Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl, with Salmon
- Thai Dye Wrap
- Flying Avocado Wrap
- A Two Item Plate of Sauteed Spinach and Clementine & Organic Apple, with Chicken as an additional Protein add-on
- A Three Item Plate of Indian Spiced Cauliflower, Smashed Organic Potato, Gluten-free Mac & Cheese, with Chicken as an additional Protein add-on

On a return visit I tried the Forbidden Rice Bowl, and The Red Chili Glazed Sweet Potatoes, and the Mother Earth Bowl. These were a couple of my favorites, though I also really enjoyed the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl, with Salmon.

The ambiance is nice. I was expecting a little more of a hipster feel, but I was pleasantly surprised with equal parts hipster, sunshine, hippie, flowers, and of course, the unavoidable big box modern food corporation overtones. There is a large indoor dining area, as well as a huge patio that includes a large covered, highly-protected portion, surrounded on three sides.

Their main categories consists of salads, plates, bowls and wraps. I ended up going with a plate that consisted of three options. The three options I picked were Indian spiced cauliflower, red chili glazed sweet potatoes and spicy jalape√±o eggplant, I topped it off with tofu as my protein. To sum it all up WOW! All of the choices for my plate where amazing 5/5 stars. My sister had bird is the word and she added avocado hummus. She didn't enjoy the grilled onions in side but loved the side salad 3/5 stars. We also had a fresh brewed beverage. I tried all of them and alone non of them were really that enjoyable. However, if you make an Arnold Palmer it's ok.

Flower Child makes a nice first impression - gorgeous outdoor patio, very welcoming interior. This restaurant is fast casual, so be prepared to wait in a short line to look at the menu and order before sitting.

The menu consists of a few salads, bowls, drinks, and sides. Lots of typical, trendy, ""millenial"" buzz word foods like avocado toast, quinoa, and hummus. Most items are vegetarian/vegan and then you have the option of adding a protein like salmon, grass fed beef, or tofu. I liked that the menu clearly labeled foods that were vegan and vegetarian and had the option of adding meat. I got the Vietnamese Salad, which ended up being a bit underwelming. The bulk of the salad was crunchy white cabbage strings that just arent satisfying the way greens would have been. I liked the avocado and pineapple in the salad though! 

As we were eating, I started to notice details. Every table had a bottle and a little plant (we had thistle flowers), the restaurant's token hashtag was prominelty displayed, and every corner felt ""instagramable."" The more I looked, the more I realized this place is like a character of what they think 20-somethings want. I think they ended up trying too hard to please millennials and it just started to feel forced.

The food was decent, atmosphere is decent, it just felt too cliche for me and so we probably wont be back. Unless I need a cute avocado toast shot on my instagram.",EmWRBnsaKgpJLT2xmKJgiA,1,0,4,RwUOIDcSLpwIscz1txn96A

Five of us ordered:
 - Chicken with Indian Spiced Cauliflower, Gluten-free Mac & Cheese, and Smashed Organic Potato.
 - Chicken with Clementine & Organic Apple and Saut√©ed Spinach
 - Thai Dye Wrap
 - Flying Avocado Wrap
 - Thai Cashew Quinoa with Salmon

We liked it so much that we came back for:
- Forbidden Rice Bowl
- Mother Earth Bowl

Flower Child serves healthy, simple, clean food...one might have thought the flavor to be simple as well...CERTAINLY NOT!!! Especially the Quinoa in the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl that I shared with my love...it is so good that I almost snuck into the back of the house to try and get the recipe. The salmon was cooked perfect. The Thai Dye was wrapped in a house made, whole wheat, flax & chia seed wrap that was warm and soft. Inside the wrap, the main protein is spicy tofu...spicy enough to notice the spice, but not so much to overpower the taste of all the vegetables inside of the wrap.   

There is a self serve drink station with some of the usual suspects as well as a couple of lightly flavored lemonades that our girls enjoyed. Napkins, utensils, togo boxes, and bags are all organized right next to drink station...so if you need a box to go for the left over, just go grab it.  

Unlike another health-oriented restaurant located across the street, FC's food has a decently good portion for the price...and it is so flavorful! They use local produce and Gluten light ingredients...but you can have many options as gluten free as well, though sometimes for an extra charge in the case of  the gluten free pita for $1.50. Their protein choices are all natural chicken, sustainable Salmon, grass-fed Steak (they serve medium), and organic non-GMO Tofu.  

Flower Child is a popular spot right now for good reasons. Make a point to stop by if you haven't already done so.

Flower Child totally is the Vegas equivalent! The steak was extremely tender! And my Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes were perfect sides! The size portion was perfect.

Atmosphere was clean and fresh!

The price for what you get can be a little high...which isn't surprising. The mark up on healthy trendy food is actually really sad...  but this review is more about the take out and service.

We have ordered take out twice. Once we got the curried quinoa bowl and the second time each of us got the Mother Earth bowl. Both times portions were much smaller than what you get when you dine in. Presentation is pretty awful and unappetizing as well. My bowl was missing the pesto which is a staple in the dish. I called to see if I could possibly come back and the response that I received was a bit scary. ""I'm not sure what you would like me to do? I can talk to a manager but I don't think we can take it back."" I literally hung up the phone in disbelief. Who says that to a paying customer? Will I ever come back? Possibly to dine in, but their food isn't difficult to make at home. I am highly against ordering take out from this place. I'd rather eat a kashi quinoa bowl than the slop they throw in a container and make look like dog food, honestly.",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,4,2,2,fKWlyxHPj3KBMgHYbQftXQ

The first time we ordered Togo 2 forbidden rice bowls.  When we were picking them up we watched a cashier that handles money stick her bare unwashed finger in someone else's Togo order and move the food around, and then put the lid on and put it in the bag for the customer.  Luckily not us.  So I kind of ignored that and the following week only I ordered another forbidden rice bowl with chicken.  I got so sick that night and it has been 5 days now and my stomach still is a little off.  I can only attribute it to that bowl and then I remembered watching them stir a Togo with their finger!!

It's only been open a few weeks and already the lines are out the door for both sit down and takeout on a normal Monday afternoon.  I ordered a forbidden rice salad with added tofu.  Large and full of different vegetables which made it nothing basic.  I saw broccoli and green beans and many other colorful fillings with additional jalapeno to spice it up.  Though it wasn't spicy whatsoever, it was still a nice dish to get the afternoon rolling.  The tofu was grilled nicely and tasted fresh.  Some of the better looking tofu I've had and presented well even at takeout where it was sliced thin and layed on top of the forbidden rice.Inside is pretty, kind of a sleek brunchy vibe.  Plenty of parking available and service was very fast with a takeout order called and picked up in less than 15 minutes, even during the rush of lunch.  Very impressed by Flower Child and will be back.  More of a higher end price-wise, at $14 for my salad with additional tofu, but well worth it for quality and taste.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,4,4,5,gUrcacmSXGcHFwwXfXgTMA

Sure the ambience is relevant and location is ideal but the layout and execution of the food is near catastrophic. Let's take the $7 avocado toast for example, this can be made at home on the same generic multigrain bread slice from any grocery store and still taste better...why not elevate the experience with a high quality bread slice that someone can't make at home. Other dishes tried were chicken tortilla soup (mostly a light broth overloaded with corn), and the vegan ingredient salad which showcased a Dijon mustard-y flavor beyond anything else. No thanks...2 people for lunch and $40 later, I'd rather enjoy their other sister restaurant next door - NorthItalia.",LC_o79IQTseA2Qi41v_rMg,4,1,3,1zibMWhznA7cjhPbZF9VYQ
3371097,2018-05-05,0,Cly7wJhbXIDID_quND01_w,"New. Favorite. Restaurant.

Discovered Flower Child just a day before they opened, in passing. Then, miraculously *cough* an ad popped up on my Facebook letting me know that it was to open the next day! Excited, I took my sister and her boyfriend with me on opening day and we all loved it SO much that I brought my boyfriend with me the very next day!

The atmosphere is wonderful. Very Instagram-y and it really has this cute California vibe. When you walk in, you will find a to-go ordering counter and a dine-in ordering counter. Dining in, you'll place an order, they'll give you a number stand and you find your own table where they'll bring your food out to you.

The menu is medium-ish sized, but the number of combinations you can make with all of the items are endless. In the two times I've gone, I ordered the Avocado Toast (10/5!!! AMAZING) and the Mother Earth bowl (5/5). I can't tell you just how much I loved both. I added two proteins to my bowl: the Tofu (5/5) and the Salmon (5/5). The Avocado Toast is the best I've ever had (and I am a HUGE avocado toast fan) and all of the ingredients of the bowl are PHE-NOM-ENAL! The Tofu is a super firm, seasoned tofu. It's delicious and unlike any store-bought tofu I've ever tried. The Salmon was cooked perfectly with even a little crispiness around the edges.

The Avocado Toast was and will likely always be my all-time favorite. The avocado is roughly mashed, still chunky. They top it with crunchy sea salts (yum!), black sesame seeds, white cheddar (I mean, WOW) and chunks of soft-boiled eggs (droooooool). The coolest part is that they cut the toast into 3 slices for easy eating! NO mess and NO falling ingredients!

Opening days for restaurants can sometimes be pretty obviously hectic, stressful and a bit of a chaotic mess (even for the patrons). However, despite the line of customers out the door, service was quick, friendly, polite and extremely seamless! I was very impressed and I couldn't wait to come back the next day with my boyfriend to share in the amazingness that is Flower Child. (FYI: he LOVED it. And he didn't think he was going to!) I will be back. Again and again and again and again...",WDm0OqWQoLuqFo36woMiEA,0,0,5,1b4VjoTscLK0EmutMda2vg

My salad was perfectly dressed - meaning it had just enough dressing to cover it. For most, it might seem a bit under-dressed, but I like mine that way. I wasn't a fan of the avocado dressing, but it wasn't bad. I might try a different dressing next time. 

The only reason I didn't give a five star is because for $4, I got probably 3 oz of tofu, which isn't a lot. I had to pay $8 to tofu... and that seems a bit outrageous, considering 18oz of organic tofu cost less than $2. So, my salad cost $16 for a regular bowl due to the double tofu. I could go to Wolfgang pucks and get an amazing salad for $20 with wild salmon on the side. At Flower Child, if I had gotten a side of salmon, it would have cost $15 which is less than what I paid with double tofu. Even if they had to grill it. There really isn't much to do. It's a better deal for salad if you don't get tofu and get chicken or something else. 

Otherwise, I think this is a great place. Everything seemed fresh, and the staff were super friendly. I'd go back, but would make  different selection.",_qkI_vYa8ZtFCxMNTEyxjQ,3,0,4,P2yipc9uyQvkJz-yuWwh0A

I was a little trepidatious about the menu as I've rarely had a great vegetarian meal, this one was awesome. We split a pair of bowls. We had the Forbidden Rice and the Thai Cashew Quinoa. Both were delicious. The Forbidden Rice had a great flavor with the soy sauce balancing out the textures and flavors.

The Thai Cashew Quinoa had a little bit of heat, make sure you have the water ready. All the bowls were awesome. My only regret was that the bowls weren't bigger. I may have to add some protein next time I'm there.",P2ZK_uDduvKbKgmNuyZQ4w,0,0,4,kWdZn9g_s9LzoMqjVD9ClA

They also have an outdoor shaded sitting area if you're wanting a little more fresh air which is just as nicely decorated as the inside. 

The service is impeccable and I received my food in a timely manner. I had the Mother Earth bowl which had ancient grains, sweet potato, portobello mushroom, avocado, cucumber, broccoli pesto, charred onions, leafy greens, red pepper miso vinaigrette, and hemp seed. It was the perfect blend of flavor and was very fulfilling. They give you the option to add protein but it was just fine as is. I also ordered their seasonal lemonade. They hand you a cup and you have the option to choose from the 3 different flavors they have displayed. I went for the cucumber mint lemonade which was so refreshing and you can really taste the cucumber. Refills are allowed so I definitely went back for more before I stepped back out into the Vegas heat that day. I look forward to trying more of their other food options. 

I was quite impressed by how fulfilling their food was.

It was my co-workers and I, who were able to check out the new spot. We ordered the Avocado Hummus, Crushed Avocado Toast and Vietnamese Crunch Salad to share at the table. We loved the toast and hummus! Those were two items that we would come back for time and time again! The toast had the perfect amount of avocado and the sliced egg was in every bite! Yummy!!! The hummus came with thin pita slices, but that avocado hummus was well made and it was so smooth and delicious!!

As you enter, you're met by a combination of frenetic energy and pleasing decor. The menu has a lot going on and offers lots of options for vegetarians (while still providing some meat choices). The staff is super friendly and helpful. And the food is ready fairly promptly without sacrificing quality or freshness.

However, I would recommend they clarify ingredients. They offer two soups: one clearly states mushrooms (among other things) while the other, an Indian curry with lentils, lists what I thought were all the ingredients (sans mushrooms, which is what I was looking for). Unfortunately, the soup arrived at the table,  fragrant and full of mushrooms. I counted two lentils. So I think Flower Child should list their ingredients clearly, particularly for those who might have allergies, in this case to said mushrooms, and also offer two distinct soups, with less shared ingredients. Also, they should probably dip the ladle deeper into the pot since this lentil soup was lacking lentils. 

All that aside, everyone was very nice about replacing it. We traded it for the avocado toast, and that was delicious. The black sesame is a nice touch. We also shared The Rebel wrap which has grass-fed steak, onion, cheese, arugula, and a nice flavor. (I would recommend that the cheese is evenly dispersed on the wrap - my half had no cheese, the other had all the cheese.) 

Flavors were good and the place interesting enough to warrant another visit. We left with a gf lemon olive oil cupcake, and that was tasty. Thanks to everyone for making the soup situation right.",ADNLYx9DMGoGPhZvnviTag,0,0,4,P7yJ0xspXREvYg8Oo8qkUA

Healthy and delicious, but you can still stay on track with your macros. I'm going to say it straight, the flavor is BIG, but the portions are SMALL. 

The restaurant itself has such beautiful d√©cor. Hip and modern. It's great that you walk up and order your food, given a number, and you pick a table. So much better than waiting around waiting for servers. Water is self serve as well as utensils. Yes, food comes out quick! 

Drinks - mostly teas and lemonades. Most sound amazing! I have to say the teas are on the bitter side because no sugar is added. Totally natural. The Lemonade is more on the sour side.

Food - like I said previously, the food is BOMB. So much flavor, you wonder how they do it and still keep it healthy. I got the Strawberry Fields salad with added chicken - which comes out to about $13-14.  The salads are a generally bigger portion since you're getting so much greens - so definitely more filling than the plates. The rest of my family members opted for the protein and sides  (these can go up to $15+). If you order the steak you only get 4 pieces (4oz approx) and for the chicken approx 6 pieces. We had a plethora of sides. Broccoli parmesan which you don't really taste parmesan, red glazed sweet potatoes - on the sweeter side, cauliflower - crispy and delicious. Can't really go wrong with the sides. 

I'd come here if I'm willing to go for something more on the vegetables and good carbs and take a hit with protein. The price kind of will keep me away since it won't fill me up.",6ImN7CLRvsDnrAx6DF4nIw,1,0,4,8vzbT6iti0lBEex3i7mS9g

When I try a place during their grand opening, I set low expectations and bump my patience level all the way up - I expect things to not go perfectly since they're working on kinks and all that. But Flower Child managed to pleasantly surprise me. They got their act together and things are going smoothly like a well-oiled machine. Service was fast and friendly. Food was delicious. The place was packed but no errors/ chaos occurred.

They have daily soup, salads, plates, bowls, wraps which you can add your favorite protein (chicken, salmon, grass-fed steak, or tofu) to. They have sweet treats as well. To drink, they have seasonal lemonade, iced tea, kombucha (on tap), wine, and beer.

Thai Cashew Quinoa with Salmon Bowl:
My bowl came out smoking hot - I got a good facial. Very tasty Asian flavors with a bit of a kick from the jalape√±o. Lots of textures and flavors. The salmon was nowhere dry or over cooked at all - it was perfection! 5/5

Spicy Japanese Eggplant, Saut√©ed Spinach + Grass-fed Steak Plate:
With their plates, you can pick 1, 2 or 3 veg/ grains and add a protein. The steak is lean but tender and flavorful. The veggies were delightful with a bit of heat and refreshing tang. 5/5

Brownie:
Gluten-free...I don't have celiac disease so, I'm not afraid/ avoidant of gluten. But if you do have celiac disease, this is the sweet treat for you! Good texture and very mo!$t. 5/5

Lemon Olive Oil Cupcake:
Not only did we try 1 cupcake, we had to get a dozen! I've had lemon Olive oil cupcakes before that only have a hint of lemon and olive oil + regular oil - not good. These cupcakes were so good. Strong flavors. Sweet and savory at the same time. 5/5

Chocolate Chip Cookie:
Another gluten-free item. Made with cashews, coconut and other ingredients without tasting too coconutty. Crunchy. 4/5

One of the highlights for me is their drink station. They have different kinds of teas and lemonades. They're all good and you can get creative by mixing different flavors.

They have neat wall murals, flowers, and little details such as a ""yoga mat parking"". So, after a good sweat sesh, this is a good spot to eat at with your gym squad.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,11,9,5,sSHpfWZ19Z0nfwcn9Gd75A

The food was UNBELIEVABLE.  I had the Mother Earth Bowl and it was sweet, tangy, filling, and very nutritious.

I LOVE everything about this place!  The ambiance, decor, service and especially the food!! 

The large open dining area is casual yet very chic, comfy and very inviting. 

You walk in and there are two areas to order. One cashier (far left) is for carry-out, and the other two cashiers (right) are for dine in orders. They were quite busy, and I appreciated how patient the cashier was with me as I tried to decide what to order from their extensive menu. I'm not a fan of raw kale, but my girlfriend highly recommended it so we ordered the kale salad and avocado toast, which I love. You pay for your meal and they give you a number for your order to place on your table. 

Even before the food arrived, I enjoyed just sitting there and soaking in the upbeat, vibrant atmosphere! I tried a bite of the kale salad and instantly regretted that I did not order it for myself! The fibrous, chewy spine of the kale was removed and the leafy green was finely chopped and I loved it, raw, to my surprise! The citrusy light dressing, mild cheeses and seeds made it an amazing flavorful and textural combination, and a culinary delight for my palate! I'm craving it now as I write about it now.

If you are in the area, definitely check it out. However, it is worth checking out regardless which side of town you are coming from!",i7vdmvgR3nam-Qo96-Cu7A,2,0,5,le8MFKn0FcvB1F-tAjo1Ng

I came for a team building lunch with a couple people from work. We got there around noon and parking was terrible. I would recommend ride sharing when coming so you can get dropped off right in front. Normally I'm not a fan of restaurants that have you order before and then find a table, but they made it super easy and helped us find a table outside. I ordered a plate combo with Mac and Cheese, Asparagus and Salmon. To drink I went with the seasonal basil lemonade which was delicious. Everything on my plate was good, but next time I will get the asparagus without the ginger. This was probably the best salmon I ever had -- it was cooked perfectly. Restrooms were clean and private and the decor overall was super cute. I would definitely go back!",E1KlcWb0qYwRSsR-iYzkXg,0,0,4,R4ahQh_msf4rn3MoHAq2Yg

Don't be deceived by the long line should you drive by as people typically are just pondering on what amazing dish they should get. This place offers a variety of choices and the option to add protein to just about any dish! Friendly staff and quick service. The Vietnamese salad still remains my favorite with the Thai cashew bowl coming in second. However it is on the salty side. Clearly being here 2x within a week it's my go to spot.

I was going to save some for my dad , a long time salmon fisherman in the Pacific Northwest (why I'm also so picky), but I couldn't stop! Melt in your mouth so perfectly prepared .

Ordering is a breeze, you just walk up to the counter and let them know what you want, grab your number and find a place to sit down. When your dish is ready, a server will bring it out to you. Staff was not overly friendly but you don't have a lot of interaction with them except when you order. I did speak with a staff member while pouring my tea, and she was super outgoing and bubbly. She was educated and helpful with the tea selection. 

The dining area is large and you can choose to chow down inside or opt for the patio dining which is what we chose. This place is so bright and airy. Great use of color through out the interior along with the groovy patio. You can't help smiling as you enjoy the good vibes emanating from this cafe'.

This cafe is primarily vegan but you have the ability to add protein to any meal. I chose the Strawberry Fields salad and added all natural chicken. The salad included organic strawberries, wild arugula, shaved fennel, toasted oats, dried mulberry, goat cheese, and the most delicious chia seed vinaigrette. It was a healthy choice for dinner and I also tried their Japanese mango sencha green tea. 
My daughter tried the Flying Avocado wrap featuring smoked turkey, gouda, romaine, tomato and avocado hummus. We were both pleased with our meals. Everything tasted fresh and the produce was crisp. The avocado hummus was so tasty! The menu has such variety. They have salads, wraps, bowls and plates. For the kids, they have some healthy choices for them which you don't see often enough at restaurants. They also serve organic wine and some Nevada brewed beer as well. 

I will definitely return here often so I can try more dishes from the menu. In addition, you can order food to go and they are offering e-bites!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,6,7,4,IA9cE2MzSDQ0XAmMizIB0Q

I don't think their pricing is bad at all compare to Panacea. It's healthy and they serve wine which is a plus! Haha I tried ordering different items at each time I've been here to see if they will keep up with the expectations. So far, everything I've ordered was great! You don't often find a healthy organic food with lots of flavor. This place is busy but you don't wait too long for your food to be served at your table.

I didn't dislike it. But I can't say that I absolutely loved it either. I had the rice bowl and it was good and added steak. It wasn't bad. I just think for the price there's a lot of other places and things I'd rather eat. My daughters wanted to try it so we went. 

One daughter had the skinny cob and loved it. My other daughter has the strawberry fields salad and liked it but the said she preferred cafe Zuppas salad...and my other daughter and I thought she was nuts. This was way more flavorful and who wants to repeat their order 50 times..this is better...order take a number--take it to the table and they Bring it there. 

I would eat there again. Not sure if it's my first choice but I wouldn't be opposed to it.",IPlLcdNG426qOopHH4EwkQ,1,0,4,yoSPqXkwdSaESvFu8HSmOg

The decor- bright and colorful. Great indoor and outdoor spaces, with comfortable seating. 

The staff- really friendly and always greets you with a smile. They have been able to describe menu items and make suggestions based on our likes.

The Rebel was salty, and was not crazy about the flavor.  When eating the wrap for some reason while eating it with all the stems from the arugula, I felt like I was going to choke on it. Not much meat inside really. The rose petal lemonade was just okay, I could taste more of the rose petal than the lemonade.  Place cute inside, although very noisy.

Very unpleased with the night and day portion along with consistency of what the bowl contains. About 30% less of a portion and 70% less of the veggies that comes along with the bowl from what I'm used to while dining in. Needles to say, I won't get take out again, will visit when time permits to dine in.

We were able to sit outside on the cute patio and enjoy a beautiful Saturday! Unfortunately my husband ordered a dish with steak and after waiting quite awhile we asked. It seems they had run behind on steak and no one told us that it was taking extra long (most of us were almost finished!) The manager (I think, but sadly I don't know his name) came over and apologized profusely for the error. Not only did he refund the item from our check, he also brought us some lemon cake muffins with a smile! Can't beat that kind of customer service. The food was absolutely delicious!
