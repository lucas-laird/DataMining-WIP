1039051,2017-10-02,0,qSNGooHe2XPOJMZI1mu-LQ,Service was great and very hospitable which is rare for a fast food restaurant. Shane and Arthur were way cool with their attitude ! I never write reviews but felt impelled to because of them. Thanks fellas !,S52qApM4rpfreoxhmYeosQ,0,0,5,99Mhc3SW8y7NxyJ46WGLlw

They kept their smiles while some obviously intoxicated maniac came in and made them feel horrible, before deciding to leave her sandwich and running off to write a bad review. I'm here to say that this subway is amazing and delicious!!! Keep it up!",auukW6aBKrh5ECOhNXCYPw,0,0,5,UTVvI1SqaDY8Amuz7Dv6BA

The restaurant looks as if it is open, all the 24 hr signs are lit and ever the hours say 24/7, but no one can get in.",77xwx92Xbhufa0DnQ4O5Kg,1,0,1,ho8GDpy4ef7GB-W9iRRyqA
2509581,2016-08-24,0,qSNGooHe2XPOJMZI1mu-LQ,The worker Amanda did not greet me when I first walked in. She was to busy carrying a conversation with an other customer about why she was passed over for a promotion. She continued to assist this costumer all the way through while I stood in line. No biggie. She finally gets to me and starts making my order. In the middle of my order another customer walks in and she stops making my order and begins to assists them. I begin to feel outraged. I stood in line and waited. Why are these people being helped before me? I had to be somewhere and she just didn't treat me fairly as the other customers. I will not be returning.,NKAn3fP97h8O_nJwvzM1GQ,0,0,1,qYYRFwlS6UvTB1HXLOp2dg

I walked in and said hi.. the girl replied with, ""I just closed my register, I can't make you anything."" I asked her aren't you open 24 hours? She said, ""yes, but I closed myself out on the register so I can't do anything for 10 minutes."" So I suggested I at least give my order, and that'll take up some time while the system reloads. She then said she was clocked out and couldn't help me. It's too bad I can't give zero stars.",d2HNq3Yop1hxnJDWpcYsXQ,3,0,1,jIpqAZTdU89yJPl4djUVGw
3262679,2017-10-18,3,qSNGooHe2XPOJMZI1mu-LQ,"Just wanted to say I'm very disappointed in this subway. I been coming here often after my gym session.
Apparently there's some New worker he told me his name is 'nathan' 
Me and my friend got done with our gym session and just ordered a sweet onion chicken footlong and split it.
I left my card on the register got a water cup and he charged me 10.50$?? I said footlong of sweet onion chicken .... he charged me two 6 inches, whatever its two bucks, it's the FACT that he doesn't accept his wrongdoing and won't give my refund of TWO DOLLARS.  I know customers aren't always right but you serious? Over two
Dollars he won't accept his wrongdoing, WONT give my money back. WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD I ORDER TWO SIX INCH SWEET ONION CHICKEN?????????? I still have the receipt very disappointed in this subway. Sorry but this was Very unprofessionally dealt with....",D5lbf6rhmTDos9Lpb7YyCA,3,1,1,0dl0wNM0x8HWi6GaBduQBA
3604721,2016-04-16,2,qSNGooHe2XPOJMZI1mu-LQ,"I love Subway sandwiches! I always go with either the Steak and cheese or the oven roasted chicken breast sandwich. Subways are always consistent on quality but service can vary drastically per location. This location is brand new. Opened on 4/15/16 and service is on point. 

John was friendly and fast. Made for a easy takeout order. Though honestly this place is great for dine in as well. Love the interior and wooden floors. Just a pretty looking subway. I've been to other Subways in the area, there's about 3 of them in a 1/2 mile radius, and this one is already my favorite. The other one down the street has super slow service late at night.",ga_05brEylDLIabc3lZOgA,3,3,5,BiNoVE3hbf8_9kaRcW_kXg
4026851,2016-05-05,0,qSNGooHe2XPOJMZI1mu-LQ,"I don't usually rate chain restaurants because that seems silly; you already know what to expect. But the staff here is great!

FYI there is a shortage of banana peppers at Subways nationwide. I guess bad weather damaged a lot of the crop from their supplier. This devastating news was given to me by a staff member at the Fort Apache and Sunset location halfway through making my salad. I apologized that I would have to cancel my order but I can't eat my salad without banana peppers. Deciding that the shortage can't be true, I tried this Subway location. The manager on duty confirmed that the shortage was true but that she thought this was going to happen and so ordered an extra box preemptively. What an amazing woman!

Great management and friendly service. Really clean and fast. Banana peppers galore. Thank you!",MyUAcr735ghKrBgaIBdI4w,2,1,5,1B3H7mnTdGedtc8WPU35FA
4355620,2018-01-18,0,qSNGooHe2XPOJMZI1mu-LQ,"Subway is by far my favorite place to get food. The service is always amazing. The staff is nice and helpful. The food is fast and easy to get with as many toppings as you want. Although there foot long sandwiches may be too big to eat at once, you can eat half and save the rest for later. There Italian bread whether it's toasted or not is amazing with fresh veggies and condiments of your choice. With the meal you can either get chips or cookies of both with a soft drink of any kind. Gets more delicious with each bite. High recommend.",X0J9Ox_H66G3143XqXVFSw,0,0,5,csb2lFEnwShESU8QFL8t4Q
4722239,2017-06-24,0,qSNGooHe2XPOJMZI1mu-LQ,Came here tonight and Arthur was absolutely awesome! He works so hard and was running back and forth to make sure everything was getting done(even though he was by himself) . I came in around 10pm and he offered such great service and was genuine and nice about it. He needs some recognition for how hard he works at night!!!!,7NYgQpw4xidoSPYDVEsRUQ,0,0,5,OGJBfBw_Q2E6AFNKR-Qf5g
4783092,2016-04-23,0,qSNGooHe2XPOJMZI1mu-LQ,"Came here and ordered three footlongs. The clerk was checking us out before the last sandwich was even made and even though there were two people assembling on the line, I still had to repeat the veggies over until it was correct. The 2nd person to handle my sandwich was about to close my sandwich without asking me if I wanted any sauce or other condiments. 

The bread was cut almost all the way through so that made eating the sandwich messier than usual. They didn't even press the veggies in before closing, so the filling was loose. Not that it mattered because the sandwich wasn't put together well to begin with.

It is clear that more training is required.",ssz4_Rj8p1CLgO2WWnIoTA,2,0,1,htvRJuwyn1yjisKfwLtV-Q

I come here if I am super lazy and need a quick bite. I never expect anything amazing.

It got busy as I was sitting here eating my lunch. And the 3 staff members kept smiling and pushing out the o rders fast. Thank you for lunch.,X9VeCgccP2kbm3tkdKqx8g,0,0,5,QcJ6fpQ-l4ZMOaNFTwiNlA
