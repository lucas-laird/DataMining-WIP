28425,2015-01-18,1,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"ATTN: GLUTEN FREE PEOPLE:

My husband and I pretty much only stay at the cosmopolitan because we like it so much, and an added bonus has always been that we can eat at the henry. we've been there maybe 5 times total, and it's great because they have a gluten free menu. Tonight, the place was completely ruined for us and we will never go back. My husband has a very serious gluten allergy. It's really hard for him to find places he can eat at while we're in Vegas. We went to the henry last night, and everything was great, like usual. Tonight when we went, he ordered the potato skins like he usually does, specifying gluten free, and the server comes back and says ""the potato skins are fried in oil that other items are fried in and may not be gluten free"" This made no sense to us because he always orders these and there's never a problem. For his entree he orders the gluten free chicken salad sandwich. When the sandwich came out my husband picked it up to take a bite, and noticed there was cole slaw on it. There's no coleslaw on the chicken salad sandwich. the server had ordered him the fried chicken sandwich....but on gluten free bread. That makes no sense. He then tried telling us they made my husband a special gluten free fried chicken sandwich. THAT DOESNT EVEN EXIST!!! he was lying through his teeth. we called over the manager and he was an even bigger waste of time. he tried justifying it saying it was on GF bread. He also suggested my husband make a report to security because of his ""gluten problem"" WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN. this restaurant has been ruined for us and if you're gluten free, be extremely careful about eating here. The staff is obviously not knowledgeable enough on what is and isn't gluten free.....even though they have a gluten free menu (makes sense huh).",NfShpsS5QsK_Y40qOZ3rRw,4,0,2,nDH2cOIT7xfTkAtXNN4wMA

A curiously small place in the heart of foot traffic, one has to wonder if Cosmo intends this breakfast specialty-house to be its ""cafe.""  You see, nothing is traditional in the Cosmo, thus there's no restaurant labeled casino cafe or steakhouse.  And that's just how it's clientele like it(?)  I just don't know; because while it seems dudes who wear moustache wax and gals whose parents played electro dance music to them in their cribs are the people who come here - I genuinely believe people don't like ambiguity.

So if The Henry is your casino cafe, I recommend going with the staples: eggs, bacon, and the like.  If you just have to have something like crab cakes for breakfast, be my guest, but know that something can go wrong.  I had the breakfast burrito everyone talk about, good, but you'll need to put something on it.  Eggs benedict was the real winner.

197027,2012-02-22,0,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"VIVA LAS VEGAS! For a weekend I headed over to the city that never sleeps. Amongst the relaxing, sun tanning, gambling, celeb-seeing, shopping, and partying, I made sure I left some time for my favourite hobby of all time -eating!


For the duration of the trip, we stayed at The Cosmopolitan Hotel  that just opened last new year's eve, making it the newest hotel on the Las Vegas Strip! If this was a hotels review blog, I would tell you that The Cosmo is probably the trendiest, most glamorous modern hotel I've been to, and how I can never stay at another hotel in Las Vegas again. But I'll save that for another yelp post.

The Henry is located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel on the main floor right next to the Chandelier Bar (fun fact of the day, the chandelier hanging over the chandelier bar is actually the largest chandelier in North America!). It has a pink and mahogany theme to it, and was comfortable yet classy with its comfy padded seats and chic decor. 

The type of food they serve here are mainly classics like burgers, fish and chips, and pot pies. Since this was Vegas, I decided to go all out and order lobster for brunch. It was in sandwich form, but I guess its the thought that counts!

""Maine Lobster Cub"" ($19)- Bacon avacado, citrus aioli, with your choice of fries, truffle tater tots or fresh fruit

The club was very good. It had chunky pieces of lobster tossed in a light mayo with a hint of lemon and parsley. In combination with the tomato and avacado, this sandwich was very refreshing...perfect for the Vegas weather! Even something so simple as a side of tater tots were delicious. They were deep fried so crispy and hot, and sprinkled with seasoned salt and truffles.  I don't know if I can go back to regular tots now. 

""The Henry"" ($16) - three eggs, slab bacon, smoked ham, apple sausage, taylor ham or country link sausage with Henry's breakfast potato 

Most other people ordered regular brunch food. They serve all day breakfast here, and there is a Henry's special that is a pretty hefty plate of breakfast items. It doesn't look that big in the picture, but I for one would definitely not be able to finish this as the first meal of the day.

""Chicken Pot Pie"" ($17) - slow roasted chicken, braised vegetables & pan gravy

Rob ordered the chicken pot pie, and it was a ridiculously large portion, even for a guy. It was served in a huge bowl filled with a hearty chicken stew, baked with a crunchy pastry layer on top. When I think of chicken pot pie, I think of a salty corn starch concotion with either fist size or non-existent pieces of chicken, green peas, and a pastry that becomes soggy on the bottom by the end of the meal. At The Henry, the chicken pieces were reasonably sized and wasn't the least bit dry. The stew had lots of other vegetables like potato, mushroom and carrots, and wasn't too salty. Tasty and filling! 

Really enjoyed this meal, definitely recommend this as a breakfast/brunch place. Make sure you come hungry though!",tE0aznXzQo-JRbHHHoFmfw,1,0,4,3bmvPfOoKP4Djk0z1JzZAQ

What's not to like about the Bellagio?  Everything is A++, BUT we decided to walk over to the Cosmopolitan and have breakfast at The Henry. 

i guess I can see why some people would consider this fine dining but honestly, it was in the walkway shortly after the entrance to the Casino and it felt more like a upgraded cafe than anything fancier, but it was nice enough.

We all ordered eggs and a protein (sausage, bacon, etc) and entres came with potatoes and bread and we are big aqua drinkers so the two sons who were with me ordered water.  Since I really don't eat carbs, I asked for extra sausage and an unsweet ice tea.  How about the ice tea was $5 and the extra sausage was $7.  So for three people our bill came to $68.00. plus the tip.  That's expensive even for Vegas.  I mean I have been here a few times and since I cannot use colorful language here I will just say we got screwed.  Food was not ""that"" special.  Ihop, Sizzlers - heck any of those breakfast places could have served us the same thing at about equal quality.   I guess the big difference here is, we did have cloth napkins, and our waiter had on this nice little pants set with the matching vest..it was nice.  No, no really it was just downright cute, now not $68.00 worth of cutieness but I was trying to find something that would help me comprehend why my breakfast cost so much.  Sat there stunned for a few seconds, couldn't figure it out and so we just left and went on our way.   

The Cosmopolitan is a beautiful hotel and casino but if you see the Henry, just remember what ya girl KB told you okay?  Average food, high prices...cute little guys in pants and vest.  If you think that's work $$$ go for it!  Next day we went back to the Bellagio for the $19.99 per person buffet includes all drink and I cannot even begin to explain the variety of choices.  It  is unbelievable and hands down the.best Buffet I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying (disclaimer: minus any cruise ship that I have been on because they are the king of buffets).",5iamRvg5kaJ3w2k_IOI-nw,1,0,2,SS26IacDYj6C5ne3m5x7Eg

I had a horrible experience here at about 3 in the morning...maybe the employees at this time think it's okay to provide crappy service during these hours, since most people are drunk anyway. They messed with the wrong sober person! The restaurant was not busy at all, but we had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated due to limited staff. When we were finally seated, about ten minutes went by, and no one had come to greet us or ask for our drink order. During this time, I looked around to see who might be our server, and met eyes with one of the servers working there a few times, but nothing came of it. Finally, I flagged him down to ask if he knew who our server is, and he told me he was our server. I was very confused at this point, because he had seen us sitting in his section for the past ten minutes, and did not greet us. His excuse was that he did not see our entire party sitting down at the table, so he did not greet us. He was correct about our party, since we were missing one person, but I thought it was odd that he would think it's okay to ignore us until this missing person showed up. My friend and I put in an order (two over priced burgers). About 20 minutes passes by, and we're wondering what happened to our food. We flag down the manager to ask him what is going on with our food, and he comes back to tell us it will be an additional 10 minutes, because the patties are thick and take long to cook. At this point, I""m pissed, because our food should have been brought to us within 15 minutes od ordering. I become even more pissed when the manager takes no accountability for the service that went wrong in this situation, and says the waiter put it in 15 minutes ago. That's what put me over the top, because I knew it had been about a half hour at that point from the time we put in our order with our waiter. To top it off the people who sat down about 15 minutes after us got their food right after we did. At this point I was expecting some type of discount or free fries...something! The manager only repeated that they did nothing wrong and followed all of their policies, which is to wait until all of the party is seated before greeting a table and the food was brought out within 15 minutes of being ordered(forgetting the part where the waiter didn't put our food in right away, which made it take 30 minutes to come out). Therefore, he told us there was nothing he could do. Very upset that he was refusing to take any accountability for the horrible experience we had, I went up to another random server on my way out to ask him about the policy they had on greeting tables. The server totally refuted this so called policy they have. So not only was the service horrible and the food was over priced, but the manager turned out to be an asshole liar who apparently thought it was okay to provide shitty service to us because we were just another group of drunk people to him partying in VEGAS!

For larger parties, reservations had to be made with the Sales Department and a Deposit will have to be placed prior to the event. In addition to the 8.25% sales tax, there is a high 21% Service Fee that will need to be paid as well. I had requested that my party's orders be placed before we arrived, as we were on a time schedule between events and I did not want to waste time ordering after being seated. With that, I also requested that our first appetizer be brought out shortly after seating to save on time. I had sent a copy of our party's orders via email a few days before my event. I had worked with Jody, who was quite helpful during the whole reservation process. She made it very easy for me and answered all of my questions. Overall, great customer service pre-event. However, I had to knock down a star for the customer sevice upon arrival, I found out that our orders have not been placed beforehand--- Fortunately, I had printed out a nice hard copy of our orders so I was able to just hand that over to the waiter. In addition, explaining the situation to the hostess was not the most pleasant as well, as she could have been a bit more understanding and helpful. After all the work i had done beforehand to schedule our time efficiently, we ended up having wasted time anyways waiting for the food items to come out immediately as they were not prepped beforehand.

I am willing to throw caution to the wind on vacation and I will pay a lot for a truly wonderful food experience. But the prices at the Henry are on par with the inflated cost of room service and it's basically diner food. Granted, it's better quality, but not *that* much better. I say, if you want to go out and have a comfort food in a stylish environment, go for it! I don't regret stopping there for dinner on our first night in. However, had I thought about it and looked at the prices more closely, I would've stayed in my room, ordered breakfast the next morning, and luxuriated in my pjs on the terrace for roughly the same price.

Saying that, I can see The Henry being an excellent stop for food after a night out. The decor is lovely, with over sized fringed lamp shades, cozy booths, and  leather chairs. The wait staff is friendly and attentive. I had a pretty decent french dip and truffle tater tots (honestly, they just seemed like straight up tater tots, but they were still good). The french onion soup is really good too. I have to say, I wasn't all that impressed with my omelet at breakfast the next day. But, we were in a hurry and they got us in and out quickly. 

I'm glad The Henry exists. For a 24 hour hotel restaurant. it's actually pretty fabulous. Stop in for dessert or an appetizer for the best value.",KmKC1eX7AqPGVKsQJrFtSw,1,1,3,bVVfkRXON0LQB-s_cz8hvg

pleased to report that it tasted just as amazing when sober.

their french toast is also to die for, but it's decidedly a better option if you're wrapping up your night as opposed to starting your day - very sweet & a bit heavy on an empty stomach. brilliant for a stomach full of liquids.

the fresh squeezed OJ is a must.

only (tiny) complaint - the tables for two are...well, cold. if you sit opposite your date and stretch your arms all the way across, you won't reach your counterpart. if you're seeking cozy, ask for a table for 4 and sit on the same side, lol.

dinner menu sounds delish as well - will have to give it a try the next time I'm in town.

I get the bacon and eggs with fruit and white toast (you have to ask for fruit or white toast or they will give you potatoes and country toast). I also love any of their salads with grilled shrimp. They use really fresh ingredients. Nothing too fancy on their drink menu, just the usual.

SERVICE & ATMOSPHERE: The few times I've been here, it seems like they are redecorating so the furniture always changes. I'm sure it will look great when they are done.

Now the food 
The first time I went my GF was at the spa as part of her birthday present. I went down for a late breakfast and there was a line (see above). 
The hostess said the bar was seat yourself , so I did and the bartender took my order while I enjoyed a complementary New York Times newspaper. 
My ham and swiss cheese omelet was excellent and the jams to go with my rye toast was perfect.

Overall experience was not so bad...but I've definitely had better brunch elsewhere for a fraction of the price we paid. I was here on an incredibly empty stomach and hunger was clawing at me like an angry animal, but considering how food usually tastes phenomenal when you're starving, the Henry didn't quite quench that hunger. Sure my stomach was full afterwards, but other than filling the empty void, my mouth and tastebuds were left wanting more.

Lila H. ordered the Henry burger which she ate open-faced. She said that without the buns, the burger really wasn't that special. The fries that came with it though, were delicious. Not quite shoestring, but skinny enough.

As famished as I was, I ordered the caesar salad, short rib benedict, and a side of the truffle tater tots. 

Caesar salad was okay - lacked the spiciness that I think Caesars need to be considered superb. 

Short rib benedict was recommended by the waitress when I couldn't make a decision between two entrees (fyi, i always love to ask the waitstaff what they like)...i wasn't really disappointed but I felt that the sauce created for the short rib could have a little bit of sweetness to it. Maybe it's because when I think of short rib, I think of the Korean version (galbi), but something was definitely missing and it fell short of culinary excellence. The meat itself was moist and succulent and my eggs were poached perfectly, but overall, the dish lacked a certain je ne sais quoi. Also, in addition to the potato base, I think I would've like the addition of some sort of bread.

My favorite part of the meal was the truffle tater tots! I absolutely love love love truffle flavored anything and the tater tots had a healthy dose of truffle fried right into them. Lila H. thought that it was too truffly, but I absolutely loved it. The truffle flavor was so aromatic that I could smell and taste it simultaneously with every bite and the tater tots were fried to a perfect crispity crunch.",qYj2HQTun4E-PNZfT1EsCA,2,1,3,NppkJICHLNp9jR5QMXQlzg

I had the French dip sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g?select=CmMrGPKOfzd2f3txCLHh4w) and it was decent except the jus was WAY too salty. It had probably reduced all day yet no one thought to taste it before serving. They are pretty generous with the meat so it's quite a mouthful and the meat was relatively moist so that negated the need to dip the sandwich into the salty jus. Think the highlight was the truffle tater tots. Tater tots are always a winner but drizzle them with some truffle oil and bang! Late night indulgence. 

Service was decent here although our server looked a little swamped. Still he got our food to us quickly and we were on our way quickly following this early morning pit stop.

During my first visit, I was hesitant to try this place out. I was fixated on getting Egg Slut but the line there was unbearable for morning hungers so the bf convinced me otherwise. I had the croissant bacon and cheese sandwich. Thank goodness it was good! The hanger subsided and all was good again. I got a taste of the short ribs benedict which was a little rich for my breakfast liking but it has layers of deliciousness from the savory ribs to the runny poached eggs.

Came for the second time last weekend. And the experience was better than the last. 
Our server Larry was attentive and has an unique radio jockey voice. He also never failed to let us know his name was Larry. 

Croissant wasn't on the menu so I opted for the HENRY BURGER. THIS IS EVERYTHING!! Everything I've been looking for in a perfect burger. First off, it was so beautifully constructed. The ingredients were simple: bacon, onion, cheese, tomato, butter lettuce with a side of pickle and placed in the right order. Nothing like the Google emoji. The brioche sesame bun was lightly toasted and perfectly round. The half inch patty was a perfect medium and juicy. I had zero guilt finishing it all by myself. Larry thought I would like a side of fruit to go with the burger but nah dude. I'm here for the truffle tater tots. Mmmmm.... Also, the brioche French toast was glorious. The berries were fresh. It tasted just as good as it looked. Portion size were huge.

Pair that with freshly squeezed orange juice ($5) and you spend about $25 with tip and tax.  It felt a little steep for me, and I left hungry still.

This place is located at the Cosmopolitan, and sits on the first floor of this resort. When we came here, it was not busy at all. We were seated promptly, and ordered drinks while we perused the menu.
I went with my usual: steak and eggs. The food didn't take long, and it was delicious. Our waiter was a friendly guy, and took care of us well. I asked him about custom drinks, and he gave a good recommendation. Apparently, drinks with cold brew or espresso are not as commonly made as I thought. But this place improvised, and made me a very good drink. Their beer selections are good too!
This was a great option for dinner. And from the looks of it, it would make a great stop for breakfast too.",-FZBTkAZEXoP7CYvRV2ZwQ,24,17,5,RBkijkg1W-gIfpm2ia2kdg

1570192,2013-02-20,0,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"Hmm, I would call this place average at best. Now mind it, it doesn't have to be awesome considering it is on the casino floor with high foot traffic. 

As we waited at the hostess stand, an employee came up and said she would be right with us. We proceeded to wait more than five minutes for her to come back, even though the restaurant was almost empty. 

When she did come back, we were seated right next to the casino floor. We asked if we could be moved to a table farther inside the restaurant to escape some of the noise and smoke. She claimed the servers could only service a small area. The tables were at most 10 feet away from each other. Doesn't make sense to me but whatever.

Also, their menu switches over at 11 PM. We arrived right at 11, and the server seemed super confused about what menu we could order from (or if we could order from both). She told us at least three different stories and finally let us order from either the dinner menu or the late night menu.

The food was good, but not great. Nothing terrible though. Good option if you are on the casino floor and in need of a quick bite any time of the day. 

The hash browns were AMAZING though! This is worth a star bump! I don't know how they prepare them, but I finished them before any other part of my meal!",H2VuJ3zigG9GOy9nRAusjg,1,0,3,iej4WT6PBYWJs3f-9Siv7g

I used to love the cinnamon roll French toast and they served it 24/7 but now they just have regular French toast on the brunch menu. Very disappointed they got rid of that item. I got a soy cappuccino this time and it was very good. Strawberry shortcake pancakes tasted similar to IHOP's fruit pancakes but with a much larger price tag. The fiancé loved his chicken club.

Maybe it was a good day for them... I don't care. If I ever stay at the Cosmopolitan again, I will be eating here more than once.

I tried their take on Eggs Benedict, with perfectly poached eggs resting on beautiful short ribs, which were perched on crispy-creamy-delicious potato cakes. The dish was drizzled with one of the best sauces I have ever eaten. Just thinking about it now makes me want to jet back there for breakfast tomorrow. So good, and at under $20 it was a bargain.

The atmosphere was cool. The only complaint I had was how close the tables are pushed together... I like a little room when I'm eating, and the people next to us were a little too close. Other than that, it was great.",jrSe4AEprc2uQ9eifK5APQ,2,0,5,gmZMrG917UXtL3B_bvv1Ww

My object of affection at the Henry was the braised Short Rib Benedict that I had been reading about for months.  And the pics for this dish really made me want to try it.

Dining solo, I sat at the bar, had a great (but busy) bartender and a wonderful large mug of hot coffee.

The dish itself was a delight.  The tenderness of the meat, the tangyness of the braising liquid, combined with the smoothness of the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce made for a great breakfast.  You know how you take a first bite of something and all you can do is close your eyes and lean your head a little - yeah it was like that.  My only wish is that the portion was bigger.  It's pricey, but worth it.

I will return for that dish.",SuyRUCI27QjQnQk7RNCu6Q,0,1,4,JM0-M6htyFrNhDIfkhNcaQ

I ordered The Henry Burger and it comes with mushrooms, caramelized onions and cheddar cheese however I had the shrooms left off. The bun was toasted and hard and the burger was dry. Just because a burger is big doesn't mean it's going to taste good. The onions were in abundance and and the cheese was good and since there was a decent amount of cheese it helped me get the dry burger and bun down. It came with a side of fries that were actually cooked perfect. I had no issue inhaling the fries. I did have a problem with a $18 burger that wasn't great let alone wasn't even good and $5 for soda is a complete rip off.

First I would like to mention that the restaurant and the hotel itself are so well decorated and designed.  It was obviously a very serious consideration when building the place.  

We were seated and given water, I ordered the french dip with truffle tater tots as the side.  The food came in decent time, the french did was AWESOME and the tater tots were so unique.  I hadn't really experienced truffles yet so it was interesting to have tater tots that were tossed in truffle oil.  It just classes up tater tots.. :)

Overall this was a great place to grab a bit for lunch, the dinner prices get up there and the lunch wasn't very affordable either for myself.. I could barely afford to eat anywhere in Vegas though.

Great place if you want to stop in a beautiful hotel for a bite.  Don't forget to walk around the rest of the Hotel to see it all!",biLZ8VWzrp9874Ye57ZPoA,1,2,4,V1SQNFhdbrEqjcjdJyz5Kw

1724209,2014-04-17,0,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"A beautiful restaurant with friendly staff. But the key part is always the food. I got the Short Ribs Benedict ($19) because it's what a large portion of Yelp reviewers had recommended. It was absolutely amazing. The thing I always worry about poached eggs is that the yolk gets overcooked and begins to harden. The first thing I did when my food arrived was run the knife through the center of the eggs and was super happy to find that the yolk ran out perfectly. The ribs were tender enough to cut with a butter knife and the potato cake under the ribs were cooked well. There was a jus covering the ribs and a wonderfully made hollandaise over the eggs. The flavors blended together were heavenly. I also ordered the apple juice and it was totally worth the $5 because it was fresh, and it was completely different from everything I'd ever had before. I could just imagine that with some kind of caramel vodka and some cinnamon schnapps to create an amazing baked caramel apple kind of drink.

My friend ordered the Cinnamon Roll French Toast ($15) with bacon ($6). The french toast was equally amazing. The buttery flavor of the roll with the cinnamon swirled through it brought a unique flavor to it that I hadn't had before with other french toast. The bacon was cooked incredibly well with a good crunch, but not overly done. 

This was an absolutely amazing breakfast and I couldn't have asked for any better. Everything about this place gave me the best start to my morning. I would highly recommend it and I would go back again. For what we got, it was worth every penny, and the cost of it felt well justified. Try this place.

I am convinced the raving about The Henry is coming from hungover, haven't gone to bed yet, people who love to spend $50 on a ""just okay"" breakfast.

We got a great night sleep so maybe it skewed our opinion of the food?
We made a reservation via Yelp's Open Table link and were seated upon arrival. 

The wait staff was very kind, very patient and offered honest opinions and suggestions about the menu, which we greatly appreciated. 
We started with the fried mac-n-cheese (5 stars) and it was amazing. However our entrees were okay. 
The Huevos Rancheros were fine, but nothing stellar.The ""marinated"" steak was actually teriyaki marinade, which I didn't finish and left most of it on my plate. For $17 I could have had this dish and more at any local mexican restaurant in Old Town San Diego.
The Henry was also fine, not stellar. The apple sausage was tasty, but the potatoes were just blah.

2090207,2017-07-12,0,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"First time dinning at The Henry, and it was not what I was expecting. So I was at the Cosmopolitan this last weekend, having a great time with friends, and at the end of the evening, after I dropped them off at their room, I wanted some breakfast. I asked around and was told The Henry was open for service (This was roughly around 5:30am) So I found my way towards the back of the Cosmo property to where The Henry is located. 

When I got there, I was surprised there was nobody standing at the entrance waiting area to seat you. Instead, I just walked past the entrance, and sat myself at the bar. There was one couple at the bar, and the bartender was having quite the conversation with them about his life in New York, why he moved to Vegas, and all the shenanigans that come along with that (Yep, I've got great ears to overhear convos this late in the overnight LOL)

About five minutes after I sat myself down I made eye contact with the bartender, upon which time he looked at me like I was there begging for something. He asked if I wanted something to drink, I said ""Yes, water please."" Thereafter, he got me a glass of water and asked if I'd like a menu. I told him I did, and he handed me the menu and off he went on his conversation with the couple.

After reading the late night menu, I beckoned him to let him know I was ready to order, at which time I went ahead and ordered The Henry Breakfast - 3 scrambled eggs, sausage, roasted potatoes and toast. Little did I know that for that it was $18.50. Good god that's up there in price LOL. Where did the days of a great breakfast for under $5 in Vegas go? LOL

So about 15 minutes later I get served the breakfast by a server. All the while, I believe the bartenders name was Alex (or Mark, one of those two,) the bartender was still chopping it up with this couple instead of tending to a customer. The breakfast came with toast, and I noticed there were no jellies or chutneys anywhere around me, but realized that some of the tables around did have them, so I got up, and got my own jellies for the toast that came with the breakfast. What I couldn't find was any ketchup (for my roasted potatoes) so I had to 'disturb' the bartender again, so he could get me some ketchup. They had the ketchup in these little metal jars inside a fridge under the bar tables. So I had that at my disposal and thoroughly enjoyed my breakfast, once I had everything I needed to enjoy it. 

The sausage had a great taste to it, wasn't burned, and the potatoes were these small rounded baby potatoes, which I prefer to sliced roasted potatoes. The bread was meh, at best, but overall, the breakfast was a good one. This would have been a 4-5 star review, had it not been for the lack of service/attention by the bartender. That is not how you treat a patron, regardless of time of day. There is a reason you work in shifts, so you're alert and attentive to your patrons, regardless of time of day, in a city that does not sleep, like Las Vegas. 

I wouldn't return back here, unless someone was paying my way for a 3 course meal.",Si6CDh3AIT5hrsqYFebLLw,1,0,3,3dHk6r4upeoC6dYVCfQPmg

i absolutely love this hotel but i'm so disappointed by the majority of their food outlet selections.

the henry is the cosmo's 24/7 food option.
we dined here late at night during one of our stays.

we ordered:
the fish n chips - $18
totally basic.
nothing special about the batter or the fish they use.
we've had much better at less expensive places.

build your own omelet - $16
the omelet was good.
was it $16 good?
no.
it came with truffle tots that had no truffle essence whatsoever and were definitely refried.
quite terrible actually.
a good tot = crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.
these tots were as hard as a rock thru and thru.
bleh!

deep fried mac & beer cheese - $12
crispy on the outside, COLD on the inside.
seriously?

the chefs at the henry need to take some lessons from the folks at tasty bunz!
they either don't know what good truffle tots and deep fried mac n cheese are or they simply don't care.
yes, i do believe there is an art to good fried food.

i'm more than willing to pay an arm and a leg for comfort food...

Wasn't sure if reservations were possible so we just did a walk in. The food was delicious! A friend in Vegas told me to try this place out for their eggs Benedict and it was tasty and well-seasoned. I had the tomato bisque with grilled cheese sandwich and oh my god I finally found somewhere that does it right! The bread was a little crisp and chewy yet soft and the mixture of cheeses was great and super melty. The tomato bisque had a little pesto drizzle on top and that was great and cut through the creaminess a bit. The beignet was more like a malasada or donut so that was definitely disappointing! My friends had the French onion soup and it was perfection! Cheesy, with a nice soaked bread, soup that wasn't too salty or overpowered with weird herbs!

I'm just too tired, too lazy and too dang hungry and nobody got time for that!

So I end up rolling out of bed at 12:00pm, brush my teeth and hobble down stairs for some much needed grub.  Just when I'm about to exit the hotel, what do I see? The Henry. Right across from Bond at the strip entrance. They serve a limited breakfast menu all day, I don't need to leave my hotel so that sounds good to me! 

The wait for a seat was a tolerable 5-10 minutes, and our server Billy, was energetic and friendly, albeit it on the frazzled side but he kept our coffees topped off and waters full, which was fine by me

He served up my coffee in a jiffy and since they proudly serve Illy, they get extra points!

We had to wait a bit for our food but it came out piping out and delicious! 

I highly recommend the breakfast burrito. This beast was packed with all sorts of good stuff: melts cheese crispy potatoes fluffy scrambled eggs and a side of zesty salsa and cool sour cream. 

We built our own burger with avocado cheddar and caramelized onions. I ordered a medium rare patty and it came out medium, no biggie. Oh but those truffle Tate tots were a plus! They were crunchy and had the most irresistible truffle aroma despite me immersing them in loads of ketchup! Yum

Both dishes were quite substantial so we decided to forgo dessert. We charged the bill to the room (hello identity points) and we were out of there in record time.

We wanted to share our sandwiches, and asked for them to swap halves on both plates. At first, our waiter (BILLY IS AWESOME!) said they cut the sandwiches in half, but it was busy, so the chefs probably wouldn't want to swap them on the plates, which was understandable.

French Dip Sandwich - Yum! While the sandwich itself was tasty, unfortunately the dip was way to salty.  Instead of literally dunking my sandwich into the au jus as I normally would with a french dip, I had to do one of those quick-dips to big bite ratios to balance out the saltiness.  The french roll was nice and flakey on the outside and tender on the inside.  Just the right amount of bread to hold up to the ratio of meat.

French Onion Soup - Unfortunately this too was also on the salty side.  I thought it was just my tastebuds for the day, but my girlfriend agreed that the au jus and soup was salty.  If you love a ton of cheese on your french onion soup, this is definitely the place to be.  They don't shy on the cheese at all.  Great flavor overall minus the saltiness.

Beam Me Up Scotty - WOW.  If you are a coffee enthusiast you will adore this alcoholic beverage.  Definitely a slow sipper as they are not shy on the alcohol.  Has a nice deep espresso flavor without being overwhelming.  I love the touch of chocolate syrup and chocolate cookie around the rim.


OVERALL:  Great place to dine in late at night considering this is 24 hours.

I love when a man has a great appetite and isn't afraid to try new things. It makes the whole dining experience much more enjoyable and you actually have a bigger appetite yourself. That was the case with me this night. I asked the server what he thought was the highlight of this place for late night dining. He suggested many, but the Cinnamon French Toast he mentioned was the one I was curious about and I haven't had that in a long time.. So that was my pick of the night.

The food came out shortly after and when I saw my dish.. I was already beaming with joy. Not only did it smell good.. It looked So delicious! Now this isn't your regular French Toast you make or order at IHOP or something. It was enormous for the size and thickness of the bread.. Lovely :) Even the maple syrup tasted yummy!!! I poured some on top of the toast and took the first bite... Sky rocket of flavor! Perfect perfect perfectly made French Toast. The texture from the thickness of the bread was unbelievably addicting.. so light, fluffy, soft, and had the most amazing flavor! The four thick slices of bread are dipped in french vanilla custard and I swear it was divine. Simply put... you could be having the best dessert/breakfast of your life. It tasted like candy, but in a good way.. not too sweet, but you have this happy smile in your tummy that candy sometimes give you.. yes that kind of feeling. Then the texture makes you want more and more and... I love eating the corners of this toast... when you try this.. you'll get what I mean ;) It also had candied pecans and creamery butter to finish off this brilliant breakfast creation. I loved it. 

If I ever wanted French Toast again and by the way... I Love French Toast. This place would be my #1 spot. It was SO good. I shared a few pieces with my guy friend and he loved this dish too. I thought he wouldn't want any since he works out hard and all, but with this dish I had.. he didn't care at all. He even said.. it's so good!!! Every time I asked him if he wanted another bite... he just opened his mouth without Any hesitation :P The plate was shining clean. Remember when I said I wasn't really that hungry... well after tasting this Cinnamon French Toast.. I magically became starving for another bite!!! Crazy I know!?!! 

This Cinnamon French Toast is the best to satisfy any hunger anytime in your day... Breakfast, lunch, or late night eats. So happy I came here and caught up with my friends. The BEST!!!",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,10,7,5,ohqjHt1OIV62fRWi3TP78Q

Let me weave you a fairly short tale, on this particular day I swore to my compatriots that come hell or high water I would dine on steak that day. However a busy day at a convention held us up longer than expected and most guys settled for fast and cheap, leaving no opportunity to have said steak. Afterwards was the obligatory gambling, drinking and after parties. After inhaling a piece of Secret Pizza (another gem in the Cosmopolitan), I remembered my vow from earlier. I wandered alone and at 4 am was directed to the Henry. It was in this promise land that I received excellent albeit slow service (it was 4 am, they get a pass) and dined on some of the best steak and eggs I've ever had in my life.

To start off with - coffee and they know how to serve it too, with a large cup!

I got ""The Henry"" which consisted of eggs any way, toast, sausage (or bacon) and breakfast potatoes. Eggs, well its hard to mess them up, and I did ask for mine over easy - cooked perfectly. Toast is toast. The sausage though - it was a chicken apple sausage (they gave me three); wonderful flavor and the it wasn't overly fatty like some breakfast sausages can be. The breakfast potatoes were also very good - lightly crisp on the outside, soft on the inside AND full of flavor, just the way I like them.

We continued after breakfast to walk over 20k steps all over the north end of the Strip.

I had the corned beef hash and eggs, substituting poached eggs for the over easy, and asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side.  Our server was happy to accommodate my request, and my breakfast was delicious.  The eggs were perfectly poached, and the corned beef hash (more of a patty) was crispy and flavorful.

I always order a steak and egg breakfast when I try new breakfast spots just to have a baseline of comparison. As far as that went, I have to say it was one of the best I've had. The steak was no joke. This is not a rubbery cheap steak from ihop. They serve you an actual bone-in ribeye steak with your eggs. Something I'd expect at a high-end restaurant for dinner. And it was a well cooked and seasoned steak to boot. It was $35 (so pricey) but honestly for that type of steak I thought it was a good value for what they give you. Poached eggs were delicious and the hash browns were casserole style and really good too (cheesy). Just nice to have something prepared a bit different than what you always get.

It's located inside the Cosmo on the 1st floor, near the casino, to the right of the entrance going to the East side. 

SHORT RIB EGGS BENEDICT
Yummmmmyyy. This was the only dish we got that was stunning. The poached eggs were perfection and the short ribs just fell apart in my mouth. It's a good dish to share and probably the best dish at The Henry. 

CORN HASH EGGS BENEDICT
This was also very good, but the short ribs are better. I would actually get one of each, and share the dishes. 

HENRY'S BURGER
Very mediocre. I wouldn't get this again. I only had a small piece, but the burger was dry and bland. We asked for it to be medium rare, but it was pretty much medium. 

CROISSANT
I didn't get to try this, but my friend didn't rave about it...so I think it was just ok. It comes with bacon, which she gave to me. The bacon was a bit  soggy and not crispy at all, which is not good in my book.

They use Illy coffee so you can't really go wrong with that.

You must get the tater tots. The little potato nuggets we loved in elementary school are all grown up at The Henry and they will delight you in a whole new way.

Things I was not too impressed with was the Huevos Rancheros. This might as well had been a breakfast burrito of some sort. Unimpressive looking, but the flavor of the meat was o.k.
The french onion soup was very blah. Lacks a good broth underneath the cheese. 
The Henry Burger... for $15 its overpriced, and upstairs of the Cosmo there is Holstein's which provides a much tastier option.

The restaurant is located about as far as you can go from the front door of the main floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Next to the Bond Bar is The Henry. The service is consistent. In other words, figure you are going to wait to sit, wait to order, wait to eat and the check will be slow. It's almost like they only hire folks with a 'tude, or who are horrible at customer service. 

Generally, when I'm here with a group, we create a small pool to bet on how slow our service will be. However, the food is really good. Fresh OJ, Great coffee drinks and lots of really good eggs dishes are their forte. The Bloody Mary is good, too, though liquid breakfast doesn't usually get it.

If you want an option, eg sub fruit for potatoes, there's always an up-charge.  It almost seems like a game where they see what they can get from you. ""Oh, you'd like an English muffin v toast? That'll be $16.00!""

2904380,2014-05-13,1,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"I moseyed over to the Cosmopolitan to eat at the Henry for breakfast on a Monday morning. It was about 10am and there was no wait. It was classy and cute, with some whimsical takes on the overt masculinity of old school gambling culture, and a nice break from the casino right outside. It was full of big chesterfield booths, and velvet covered chairs, argyle walls, and possibly my favorite piece of art EVER (picture attached). This horse's bangs are on-point, and I consider her to be the one fashion icon I saw in Vegas. 

But most importantly, the food, right? First, the coffee cups are big. Thank you. It's Vegas. People are purging their sins from the night before, and that calls for a heavy hitting cup of coffee. The servers were great about refilling, but also asking before they refilled. One of my personal pet peeves is when you get your coffee/cream/sugar ratio perfect and then they add more coffee. But they know what's up. Constant refills, always asking first. Juices were served in martini glasses, and one of my companions ordered a really beautiful fruit smoothie and loved it. 

There is an embarrassment of riches at the Henry. We had to strategically order to make sure we covered the bases. We ordered a California Club Omelet and the Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes and split them. The omelet was full of creamy avocado and cheddar cheese, and studded with crispy bacon pieces. My friend doesn't like tomatoes and I love them, so we got them on the side, and they were nice, fresh, and sweet. The omelet was served with a potato hash brown type cake on the side that was the best thing I ate. It was very crispy on both sides, and creamy inside. It was really flavorful, and we spent some time trying to guess the flavors inside. I'll save you the guesswork and let you know (I asked the waitress). They use the truffle tater tots for the potatoes. It has cheddar and Gruyere, onions, leeks, and thyme. It was seasoned with the perfect amount of salt and pepper. It was heavenly. The meal was served with a choice of toast and I got the sourdough. It was pretty good, because sourdough toast is always good, but nothing to write home about. I usually eat all of my toast, but I left 3 of the 4 pieces behind to make room because the rest of my meal was so good.

We also got the blueberry buttermilk pancakes. They're served with a dusting of powdered sugar and syrup on the side. They were fluffy and sweet, but not *too* sweet. I didn't need the syrup at all, because they were so moist and tender without. 

I'm sad that we didn't get to try the Cinnamon Roll French Toast or the Short Rib Eggs Benedict because they look deliciously decadent, but the guys who went with us are SO RESPONSIBLE about ordering healthy and we couldn't talk them into it. It'd be worth a trip back next time I'm in Vegas. I would definitely come back here to try the specialties.

While flipping through the menu, one can get confused in the plethora of choices. Let me make it simple for you. If you don't have the Short Rib Benedict, you're missing out big time. Tender braised short ribs on top of potato cakes topped with two poached eggs, hollandaise sauce and black caviar. Yes, black caviar, the stuff that costs $250/lb and is so damn delicious. If that doesn't make your mouth water, look at my picture. The entire combination is just so rich in flavor and texture. I usually never get my eggs poached, but these were fantastic, especially with the hollandaise sauce. It's worth all $17.

One other thing that sticks out here is the Deep Fried Mac & Beer Cheese Balls, served with spiced buttermilk ranch dressing. These are delicious and perfectly fried without too thick of a layer. However, you can't taste too much of the cheese. Still worth it for an appetizer though. 

Service here is very friendly and surprisingly fast. We had a group of about 10 and our dishes came out within 15 minutes. Do yourself a favor and splurge a little. This is one of those places that is very worth the hype.",1yv6GXttiII_-od7HaUcfA,0,1,5,Db2SOvzFJpO670d6-9zLxA

Beyond great even. Asked us several times if everything was okay. Provided us plenty of condiments and bread spread. Fixed a mistake on behalf of the kitchen. Everything was amazing - so we went back. 

Second time around, had the opposite experience with the server. Gustavo did not introduce himself (I had to look for his name tag), was hasty to leave, and gave us one tray for bread spread even though we ordered 3 entrees that had bread. Gustavo also took the initiative to just pick the hot sauce for us instead of asking us which one we would prefer (Larry, above, actually gave us all three types). Gustavo's face was just unhappy and unpleasant - it would've offset any great restaurant experience. He did not refill drinks, did not ask us once if everything was okay/if we needed anything else, and disappeared to who knows where towards the end. Maybe he was having a bad morning, but I've never experienced having a server who does not talk, does not provide service, and carries a stink face during the entire dining experience. And here's the nice cherry on top - he rudely handed us the check and said ""here you go!"" and walked away. Those were the last few words from this unhappy man.

PRICE: pricey... for 2 people at lunch $76 (of course we did have a cocktail each which contributed to about 1/3 of the price) 

ATMOSPHERE: an upscale cafe across from Bond Bar 

SERVICE: 2-2.5 stars 

- walked up around 11:30am and was sat right away at a table with no flatware or bread plates, just napkins... took them about 5 minutes to locate flatware but didn't bring any bread plates (this will become key later) 

- server was busy with a couple of other tables so it took another 5 minutes before he was able to make his way over... he was VERY nice and attentive ... took our orders and off he went 

- water glasses remained un-filled for another 5-7 minutes ... turns out they waited to fill our water glasses until they brought out our drinks... odd 

- appetizer was brought out but no appetizer plates and since we didn't have bread plates...we sat there staring and trying to gain the attention of any one of the 3 different wait staff helping the other tables ... no such luck... even the guy that was dressing the table next to us didn't notice... so we took the bread plates off that table (literally arm's length away)... so strange! 

-our server was Nice but it just seems like he was a bit too busy maybe the manager didn't have enough people on staff that day 

FOOD/BEV: 3 stars average 

Bloody Mary's - 2.5 stars - a little on the watery side... I've had better at golf courses and for $12 a pop... I won't be ordering it again from them 

Deviled Eggs - 3.5 stars - for $15 you get 3 halves... they have crab and caviar but still... seems a little steep to me (and I don't mind paying a lot if the food and service are really good)... better than your average deviled eggs, but not over the top spectacular that I would order them again 

Lobster Club - 3 stars - Good size portion that looks like a Scooby Do sandwich.... thick pieces of toast with lots of chunks of lobster with creamy avocado pieces... but the downside was that the mayo was killing the lobster... I mean... they need to ease up on the mayo... and add a hint of seasoning like dill, garlic salt and lemon (which I did when I took 1/2 home... it did the trick...YUM) 

Chicken Salad Sandwich - 3.5 stars - Another good size sandwich loaded with meaty chicken... like the above... too much mayo... it was served on a cranberry nut bread which was Awesome! 

Fries - option served with LC - 5 stars - thin like shoestring and perfectly salted... definitely put them on my Drunk Food menu. 

Tater Tots - option served with CSS - HOLY YUMMINESS! Again 5 stars! Nice crunch on the outside and steamy hot on the inside with a hint of truffle oil or maybe it was truffle salt... either way...

Mambo Italiano, The Henry's take on a bloody mary, is downright incredible.  Made with a base of garlic-infused vodka, the drink is fragrant with a tomato basil scent, peppery, and tasty - all at once.  It comes with a slice of pepperoni and olives.  

The truffle tater tots are addictive.

Now on to everything else. 

The service was nonexistent from when we sat down until 30 minutes later, when we flagged down the hostess to tell her the waiter never came to our table.

Grub: We ordered from the late night menu and got the buffalo wings (eh shrug), Belgian Waffle (how can you mess that one up), French Dip and Fish N' Chips.  The French Dip was oversalted and the only saving grace to that dish was the truffle tater tots.

We were all starving and getting really drunk from drinking on empty stomachs making us less and less picky about where to eat.  We were seated right away and given some water to drink as we browsed the menu.

What was ordered: 

JH - Huevos Rancheros
BB- Reuben sandwich on rye with tater tots 
Me- Chicken salad sandwich with fruit

3 mimosas

Mimosas were really good, a good mix of juice and champagne.  Didn't taste like the cheap stuff some places use in their mimosas.

Huevos rancheros was pretty flavorful but I wasn't too big of a fan of it, in the end the portion that JH traded me for my other half of the sandwich was finished by him as well.  

Chicken salad sandwich was really good, at first I thought I was ordering a chicken salad so when I saw it I was kind of like wtheck.  The bread they used was tastyyyyy, the cranberries baked into the bread really complemented the chicken salad well.  The fresh fruit that came on the side was pretty good too, it had raspberries in it and usually raspberries taste bland or sour, but these were sweet & tart.  

Reuben sandwich was really flavorful and surprisingly delicious. Although, I don't tend to like sandwiches that don't have veggies inside.  

Service was good and prompt, nothing special.

Yet, since we were in the City Center and as I mentioned it was 2am, The Henry was about our only option. The hostess told us it would be a 45 minute wait for a table, so, we waited.

We were sat in the back of the restaurant amongst a few tables of drunk middle aged women, 3 Asian business men, and 2 Persian men playing cards. Our server was rude, short with us, and had no interest in actually delivering customer service. I understand that the average client in at that time is probably a rude tourist who is more interested in snapping cell phone pics than focusing on ordering, but this is The Cosmopolitan and I expected better. Our table was not obnoxious or rude or loud in any way, but we were treated like children and the kids table.

The late night menu had very little selection outside a few appetizers, light breakfast, and a few sandwiches. My friends shared the mac-n-cheese balls and they were a bitter disappointment. 3 very small portions of almost-cold-in-the-middle noodles in a crunchy coating. I had a burger that was reminiscent of cafeteria fare. 

We paid out bill and bolted. At the price and the time it took to receive our food, room service would have been a better option. I highly suggest avoiding this restaurant, which is sad to say about the newest and hottest hotel in Las Vegas.",nYIH8IHzWp3j33L3qsAz5Q,3,0,1,cROl8GccYYI0UFGg5ErehA

Wanting to try a more casual brunch, we were trying to decide between eating here or at Eggslut. My husband had gone there the last time he was in town for work and told us that he really enjoyed it. 

The only problem was that neither my friend or I are huge fans of runny yolk (which apparently is the highlight of their dishes). While I'm sure they would have been more than happy to well cook our eggs, we felt the Henry was a better choice as it had something for everyone.  

I made us a reservation painlessly via Open Table, but it turned out that wasn't necessary as there were no more than two full tables in the place (granted it was 11am on a weekday). We picked a cozy half table, half booth and settled in to browse their menu. 

Both my husband and our friend ordered the Henry Breakfast, while I opted for the breakfast burrito with chorizo. Their plates came with a choice of bacon, ham, or pork or chicken sausage, along with 3 eggs any style, hash browns, and toast. They later found out they should have shared since neither of them were able to finish the generous portions. 

They also brought out a cute butter and jam plate for the toast with some of the most delicious strawberry preserves I've ever tasted. 

My breakfast burrito was stuffed to the brim with scrambled eggs, chorizo, pico, tator tots, and Monterey jack cheese. It came with a side of sour cream and salsa which sadly I wasn't a fan of. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the tots nice and crispy, but the chorizo seriously lacked heat. Dare I say, it was almost sweet in the way maple breakfast sausage is? I tried to use the salsa to amp it up, but it was pretty bland. I made do with a side of hot sauce I asked the server for, but only ate half because it was gigantic. 

Next time I think I will stick to the typical breakfast plate because everything on that was great. Also, don't order sodas here you guys. I want to say it was $5-6 for a diet coke. We were gambling anyway after our meal, and I felt pretty dumb for not just waiting and ordering one then for free. Oh well, you live and learn.

It shows that it's open 24 hours, but I saw a sign there once that said something about going upstairs to eat, so I can't confirm that.

We ate breakfast here twice during our stay and felt similarly about it both times.  The food is decent/good, depending on what you get.  Over the two days, I had a taste of:
-Short Ribs Benedict: sounded amazing on the menu, and was good, but not my particular favorite.  Potato on the bottom (it was crispy at one point, but the heavy short rib/benedict sauce did away with that), short rib on top of that, and then poached egg with a tiny bit of caviar on the very top.  Nice presentation and preparation, but flavors were just ok for me. Jim G. enjoyed it.
-Huevos Rancheros: I deconstructed mine so as to avoid the tortillas. I think I may have made them better that way. The components were too separated otherwise.  This way, I was able to mix together the carne asada, bell peppers, cheese, avocado, and ranchero sauce. It was simple, but good. I wish they had some sort of jalapenos or something; I asked and somehow there aren't any in the whole kitchen?
-Day two we sampled some omelettes. Not too overcooked and full of ingredients. Solid breakfast.

Where The Henry goes wrong is the service. SLOW! Sometimes it's slow with a smile, other times it's slow with a bewildered look. I feel like I spent half our meal with head turned, searching for someone to bring us something fairly standard, some accompaniment to our meal. Don't go there if you're in a hurry, that's for sure.  If you just need breakfast the morning after? Then The Henry works just fine; you won't be amazed, but you'll certainly be full.",-lh59ko3dxChBSZ9U7LfUw,5,3,3,mYLEfu-YhnD78ymu-0Cjng

We only visited once during our last trip to Vegas, but the one visit was enough for me to be impressed. It was our final meal of the trip, and we stopped in to get breakfast before heading to the airport. I had the short ribs benedict, and they were very tasty--tender, boneless short ribs served atop a toasted english muffin w/ hollandaise sauce! Nom! Vinny had one of their traditional breakfast meals (w/ eggs, bacon, etc.) and enjoyed his selection as well. Our friend Denise was also with us, and she ordered the breakfast sandwich, which she requested to be altered to meet her vegetarian needs.

I ordered the short rib benedict ($19) for my main entree and was disappointed to receive one single benedict stack. I'm not sure if they were running low on eggs that day, as I saw the table next to us ordered the traditional benedict and also received one benedict as well. All of the images on Yelp from previous diners at The Henry, and really all of my restaurant experiences everywhere, lead me to believe that I should have received two. For $19, a single benedict was pretty sorry, and it really wasn't all that good anyway. I wouldn't order again. 

My husband ordered the croissant sandwich ($15) and it was probably twice to three times the size of a normal breakfast sandwich. The size of it definitely exceeded my expectations, but the sandwich itself was nothing special. 

As for the french toast - I'm glad we ordered since it was the best food I had on my recent trip to Las Vegas. Both light and crunchy, sweet but not overly sweet. I would definitely recommend getting one for the table to share...it was too much for one person to eat alone. 

We also had some cocktails which were well-crafted and delicious but not particularly memorable. 

Our service was really slow; it took our server nearly 15 minutes to even greet us, and everything after that - water delivery, drinks, food, etc - seemed to take ages. A table next to us (in a different server's section) sat 20 minutes after us and received food before us...so your mileage may vary. And since this restaurant is largely open to the casino, there's not much to speak of in terms of ambiance or atmosphere. It feels like you're eating in a casino. 

We dropped about $100 on breakfast for three entrees, a side, two drinks, and tip. 

This experience reminded me why I stick with the fancy buffets! Wicked Spoon, just a short walk away, offers a better selection of food, where you don't have to wait on the server, and of course, lighter on your wallet.",MHmKe1NQ1pCpIrbK4XREDw,4,3,2,XizizKbrOAof0e_M6_UYZA

3303578,2011-03-23,0,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"Decent food. Pretty setting. 

The Henry is the Cosmo's version of a coffee shop or diner, with a little bit more pizazz and much nicer booths. The decor and food are slightly elevated from your typical Vegas coffee shop. 

Decor is probably the best part. Very luscious booths and nice comfy chairs.  Gorgeous light fixtures!  The tables along the outer edge of the space, near the entry-way, are not separated from the rest of the hotel by any glass, making for some great people watching as folks walk by coming in from the hotel's street entrance.

The food itself is a bit disappointing. Its just not as good as you're expecting based on the decor. It has a lot of potential and ambitious goals - ""revamped classics"" is their goal. The menu is definitely classic and trying to be revamped, but its not knock-your-socks-off good. There are a lot of places that ARE managing to do the classics in the way that this place is trying to accomplish.  But I'm not gonna totally dis this place and give them the benefit of the doubt...The hotel hasn't been open that long and so hopefully, they'll keep working on the food.

As for what was actually eaten, I had the prime rib plate which comes with mashed potatoes, horseradish sauce and au jus.  It was decent and hit the craving I was having at the moment.  My dining partner had the pot roast, which she said wasn't exactly what she thought it was...but I'd take that comment with a grain of salt since her palette and dining experience are pretty limited. She thought she getting something like a carved hunk of meat but got something that was more like a thick beef stew....in the menu it was described as ""braised short ribs"" so to me it looked like what that sounds like.  

The free breadsticks with dinner are super - nice & soft & warm! Perfect with butter!  My mojito was alright. 

Prices were as expected, not cheap but not outrageous.  

Service was adequate. Actually I guess it was a bit fake?  My dining partner (the boss lady) wanted some sort of cocktail but she wasn't sure what she wanted AND she doesn't really drink anything other than girly fruity drinks so she asked our waiter for a recommendation. He didn't have one so he asked her what she liked..like what specific fruit do you like in your fruity drinks. She told him she wanted something with raspberries. He said he would have the bartenders make her something with raspberries and vodka, ""just for her""...He came back with a drink with dragonfruit that was straight off the menu!  He told her that the bartender ""thought she might like this one better"" based on what he reported she liked!!! Fake! Whatevs, dude! She was all impressed and thought that was sweet....I just this was dumb and totally not true...The bartender refused to make something off menu. Please. Anyways, its minor but I thought that was lame. Just be honest!  Someone more attentive would not have been pleased with that. 

Pros: Breadsticks, decor, people-watching, comfort foods, simple/familiar items, quality ingredients.

Cons: No bathroom in the resto itself (you'll have to exit & use one of casino level bathrooms).

Food is good, but they're really cheap on their juices.  I don't mind pricey food in Vegas, but I had problems with ordering juice with them three times.  

We went for lunch and snacks a few times because the Cosmo did not have many options for lunch.  It's not the waitress's fault, nor the bartender.  I believe it's the head bartender who just didn't want to give us more juice.   

The first day, our cranberry/pineapple juice cocktail (non-alcoholic) came in a regular-sized glass.  The second day, it came in a small glass about half the size, so we kindly talked to the waiter and he brought back the juice in a taller glass.  We did notice, however, that he sort of had difficulties with the bartender.

The third occasion, the juice came in a small cup again, so we kindly asked a different waiter who happened to be very friendly help us.  No questions asked he made us happy.

The fourth time, this female waitress says to us that they simply pour more ice into the glass if we wanted the juice in the regular sized glass.  So of course, we get the juice in a regular sized glass (not full).  Was that supposed to make us feel better?  Did she think we were being cheap?  The casino invites me to the high rollers tables, but this restaurant does not get a great review from me, nor extra tip $.

We never once asked to speak to the manager, nor gave attitude to the waiters or waitresses.  We even asked the waiters if they had problems.

It was relatively early (around 7) and there weren't many others in the restaurant. The space is a little odd if you've never eaten in a casino restaurant before - it's quite open compared with some of the other bar areas - but nicely decorated and manages to hold onto a little bit of atmosphere for itself.

The service was fine, not super attentive or friendly but, well, serviceable. We ordered beer and wine along with the buffalo chicken tenders to start. The tenders were good, and the buffalo sauce one of the spiciest I've had. Tasty, but builds fast. A good start.

The mains, though, were thoroughly mediocre. I had the ragu bolognese which could have been hotter. There was a good amount of cheese on top but it wasn't spread very evenly and kind of clumped in places. The sauce was a little bland, not as warming as I'd hoped. The rigatoni was soft (though I've come to expect that outside of Europe). My husband had the meatloaf which is Sriracha-glazed.

For dessert we went for the chocolate fudge cake, which was in fact more like a chocolate gateau with fudge sauce on top. Decent, but not really what I had in mind. It also wasn't heated so it was quite firm and stuck to the roof of your mouth - but because it was already finished with the sauce on top it felt too late to ask them to heat it up.

Overall, pretty bog standard, really, and I'm sure there are better meals to be had for $130 for two, even in Vegas. I heard good things about the brunch so I'd come back for that, but not for dinner.",uCNgCZCuo07ew0sWPB1z7g,8,3,3,g7akUChsX1YrWuoOdw_zag

It was about 11 pm when we arrived and the hostess seated us right away. We were put into a corner that left us no elbow room, so hubby asked the hostess if we could move to a different spot. She moved us to a half booth and half table. That didn't end up much better at first, but we moved the table around a bit so we had room and it turned out fine. Our server was nice however we did have to flag him down for drink refills. 

French Dip ($18) - Shaved prime rib, Swiss cheese and au jus on a French roll. I asked for the horseradish sauce to be left off. This also came with my choice of a few different sides and I chose the Truffle Tater Tots. The sandwich was not as great as I has hoped for. If you look at other pictures of yelp of this sandwich you will see there is a lot more meat in those ones compared to mine. The prime rib was tender, but lacked a lot of flavor. The bread was stiff even after dipping it into the au jus. The tater tots were nothing special and I tasted nothing truffle whatsoever. The total was $50 including tax (before tip) for just 2 sandwiches, 2 sides and 2 sodas. I wasn't impressed and have experienced better at other places both on and off the strip, so I can't see coming back.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,41,39,2,PSIigFMrk1KNahmGOxS0zQ

We started off with some buffalo wings, which were pretty spicy! They were cooked really well, and we were also given wet wipes to clean up the unavoidable mess that comes with chicken wings. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, but had asked for the blue cheese dressing to come on the side. Unfortunately, when it arrived, I was disappointed to find out that it had not come on the side. The chicken was kind of soggy from all the dressing and water from the tomatoes, that it wasn't really that enjoyable. It was really flavorful, however, and tasted just like the chicken wings! 

I opted to order the sandwich with a side of tater tots, which they fry in truffle oil. I had never had truffle oil before, so I was put off by the smell, and had to remove the tater tots from in front of me because it was so nauseating. This is nothing against them, just something that I wasn't expecting.

Overall, I would not pay the price we did for this meal, but it is pretty standard in the Las Vegas area. Other than forgetting my request, our server was really friendly and quick. They also serve breakfast all day, so it's kind of like a fancier and more expensive Denny's, and the quality is not much better than I what would expect from Denny's either.",MKTrPMPWriQuc5GkuYpFcQ,2,2,3,NlFghg4N2q2GoKPzcRtvdg

Anytime I see Benedict I must try it, it makes me weak in the knees.


as we came in there was no line, but they had to clean some tables took about 5 mins to get a seat which wasnt very bad at all, it is located in the front of the cosmo downstairs, which was hard to find at first since most of their restaurants are on the 2nd and 3rd floors. The cosmo I would say is hands down the best casino in vegas, so just hanging out waiting to sit was pleasant.


I had ordered the short rib Benedict of course. It was tender and flavor full, I didnt realize it was on top of a potato cake, Normally in a Benedict the sauce makes things soft and yummy, and you usually have something harder or crispy on the bottom, I would have liked it better if the potato cake was more solid/ crispy.

The food was the right portion, Didnt make me stuffed and didnt leave me wanting more.

while we were sitting apparently celebrities go here at like as three times during the meal. I saw random people come up asking for their autograph and photo, which was cool that you get to eat/ sit next to them.... only if I knew who the hell they were, im too much of a loser to be in the know..

Don't misunderstand me, though -- even though The Henry's offerings are more modest in price doesn't mean the  food quality is any less spectacular than what you might find elsewhere at some of the more trendy, overrated and overpriced restaurants in the immediate locale.

Everything on the menu appealed to me, but I was immediately drawn to starting with the Caesar Salad with grilled shrimp, and then having the Chicken Salad Wrap with bacon. The salad is huge, large enough to easily be shared by two (which I did). The shrimp were large and meaty, grilled just right; loved their flavor. I was immensely pleased with my chicken salad wrap. Large, generous amounts of chicken in every bite, graced by just the right amount of mayo. The bacon added just the additional element to make it more than memorable. (Tip: Ask for the horseradish dipping sauce to use in conjunction with the wrap. That sauce is phenomenal!) My entree also came with a side of Truffle Tater Tots. They were quite good, but I couldn't finish them. 

Needless to say, I left The Henry very happy. For whatever reason, it didn't seem to be getting much attention of traffic while we were there.

3954973,2011-09-06,1,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"Utterly delicious!  I mean it.  This is the other restaurant that I've been lucky enough to go to during Restaurant Week, and again, I have not been disappointed.  I'll admit, though, during any other circumstances, I may not have been coerced into trying this place out--prices mainly.

We had a group of 6, and they were quite accommodating.  I had also made a separate reservation for another group through Open Table, and changed it according, through the hostess.  They were pretty helpful in trying to get our tables together, though, which I appreciated.

Being as it was during the week, I'm pretty sure that our reservations were unnecessary (since we walked right in and there was no wait), but I can definitely see how this place would have lots of traffic and why people would need to be prepared to wait.  

I must say, I thorougly enjoyed my dining experience due to a number of factors: ease of finding the restaurant (make sure to park in the West Tower/Area vs. East to avoid a long walk), accessibility was close to the Strip (a bonus for some of our friends that wanted to walk around after the large meal), and the excellent service (seemed like the wait staff was coming around quite regularly to either ask us if we had any requests or to to give us refills...no, not in a way that got annoying, but definitely enough times to know that they were present).

Since it's Restaurant Week, we definitely went with this menu.  The choices were a Caesar or Wedge salad with bits of tomato, bacon, and cheese, in addition to the dressing for the first course.  The second course options were Prime Rib with mashed potatoes or Salmon with bacon, green beans and potatoes.  Finally, the third course was Chocolate Cake or Banana Cream Pie.  Basically, our group had a combination of the salads, prime rib, and a combination of the chocolate cake and banana cream pie.  I thought it was actually pretty funny that nobody got the salmon.  Haha.

We also had bread and butter for the starter, although nobody was really impressed with this dish.  My boyfriend did, however, order the truffle tots, which were gobbled up in seconds.  The tenderness and crisp tots were actually pretty tasty, without feeling that ""I just bit into a lot of grease and need to spit all of this out,"" but more like ""Just one more"" repeated again and again.

The salads were, well, salads.  

As for the prime rib, JUICY JUICY AND JUICY!  I could get enough of it.  If I would've had to have given up any of the other options in lieu of another piece of prime rib, I would've done it in a heartbeat.  I feel like you couldn't go wrong with the prime rib, and I was unwilling to be the lone soul to order the salmon, instead.

With the desserts, it seemed like people were split on this.  If you like a moist, filling chocolate cake, look no more.  That's what they had here.  If you expect anything else out of a chocolate cake, you're probably not gonna like the dessert here.  Did I mention that the piece of cake was pretty much close to 5 inches tall?  Amazing!  I heard that the Banana Cream Pie was pretty good, but I'm more of a chocolate person, personally.

Can't wait to come back for more Prime Rib!",QiDtS54JwTGeH81c-a84WQ,4,1,4,I7WE6qyLVxH6G56L9wA-rA

I haven't tried their burger, but if you are thinking of getting a burger here, go to Holsteins (on the 3rd floor) instead - they make phenomenal burgers.

I split a salad and sandwich with my coworker and they were really thoughtful and split our meal on separate plates before serving us.

The Tuscan Kale Caesar Salad ($11) was good - it was a mix between romaine lettuce and kale, with parmesan cheese, croutons and and caesar dressing. It was everything that I expected in the salad. Nothing that blew my socks off, but it was good and a solid salad.

The French Dip Sandwich ($16) was also good - it was decently sized and they were not too skimpy with the meat. The best part were the truffle tots - perfectly crispy and anything with truffle is amazing.

I was glad I split the salad and sandwich - it was the perfect balance of food, and the right amount of food for me. I'd come back here again for breakfast, brunch or lunch, and a good option for late night food since it's open 24/7.",cSNER_qF_bb1t7kN0kZ44Q,5,2,4,6kiHdfhe1pf9EHMQ41QdYg

Only because the Thousand Island dressing overpowered the entire thing.  I could taste a little crab but no truffle or caviar.  I would put the Thousand Island around the plate so you could dip in a little or a lot to your taste.

That said, the rest of the food, as well as the wine, was totally delightful.  I had the French Dip with Truffle Tater Tots and the hubby had the Lobster Club with Truffle Tater Tots.  We paired it with their CC: Winery 2008 Cab.  This Cab was terrific and complimented the food well.

The French Dip was Prime Rib and was sweet, tender and delicious-- the bread was perfect, toasted on the bottom and flaky like a croissant and the Swiss cheese just gave it that little something in the background.  

Hubby's Lobster Club was also great--lobster was cooked perfectly.  The bacon was applewood which gave it a great flavor.  

Now to the Truffle Tater Tots--AMAZING--we had to ask how they were made.  The waiter said they were fried in oil with a little truffle oil infusion, then tossed with truffle salt with just a hint of truffle oil drizzle.  I love anything with truffles and these not only didn't disappoint, but I may spend the next year trying to get them right at home.

We got there excited to eat the AMAZING cinnamon roll croissant French toast and chicken fried steak, (among other things) only to find out they don't make those items anymore. According to the waiter they hired new cooks and changed the menu in June. We decided to try the lunch options since they didn't have the breakfast items we had specifically come for. I had the French dip sandwich and my husband had the meatloaf. 1st of all We waited a long time for the food. When it came, my sandwich and fries were barely warm and you could tell not fresh - the cheese wasn't even soft or melted. It also came on a small flat square cutting board instead of a plate, how am I supposed to dip my sandwich and not have it dripping all over the place? Lol. It tasked just ok, I don't like to complain so I ended up just eating what I could. My husband's meatloaf was just ok, nothing great. We decided right then that we definitely weren't coming back. A few hours later both my husband and I started to get sore stomachs, and 8 hours later (which is the time you'd get food poisoning) I was fighting not to throw up and couldn't stay off the toilet. I knew it was the food we ate from because that's all we ate the whole day.

The menu here is something I can get into with so many breakfast choices at 3 pm. Believe me this is the night menu too. It is fantastic. 

So many choices of wonderful food selections. This is going to be an awesome place to revisit, since I enjoy good breakfast at all hours of the day. The hours here are fantastic too. They are 24  / 7. Who could go wrong with that? I applaud them. This is a rarity here in Vegas to find a decent and upscale place to eat at 3 am; for example. 

Adding this to the permanent bookmarks in my Yelp app. I can now get good breakfast or steak at an hour. Mental check done!

I had the French Toast, in which the portion sizes are massive. The giant was Jack in the Beanstalk must eat here. The plates are portioned to his liking. Fresh fruit comes on top with my mix of strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. The fruit is fresh . The french toast is cooked with cinnamon and other lovely spices. It smells so good, and the powder sugar is all it needs. I am not a big fan of syrup but they put it on the side. 

Who knew that a Rose infused cocktail with elderberry and vodka would go with french toast. Vodka goes with everything; enough said. But the mixture of all these flavors bring out the cinnamon in the french toast. 

The name of the libation that I tried on the menu was Rose All Day. I believe it is the cantaloupe Vodka and Elderflower that give the drink that amazing taste.

Having been so long since I have had apple pie I am trying their spin on it here. The menu has it paired as a traditional style. With the Apple pie along with vanilla ice cream. They use caramel sauce to sweeten the deal with their pairing. It looks way to amazing to eat too. The taste of the Apple pie is over the top. It is served warm with the Apple pie and vanilla mix sheet decadence. The caramel sauce just seals the deal.

Mental note when you have midnight - two am cravings; this is the place to come. The service and food are fantastic. It's located in my favorite casino. What a great pairing when I come back. Oh! Did I mention",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,18,18,5,fwvBwQclaL1CqzvskXJ2PA

Food came reasonably quick. I ordered one of the hearty omelets which came with a side of toast. Potatoes were also served with the dish. Some of the best breakfast potatoes I have ever tried. The omelet was good. Lots of flavor. Not salty. The other dishes were savory and much enjoyed.

One member of our party observed that a bottle of wine that she was familiar with was reasonably priced, so we selected that, and it was delivered in a timely fashion. 

When it came time for the food orders, though, there were issues. Three of us ordered grilled cheese with tomato soup from the late night menu, but we wanted to add bacon to the sandwich. When the sandwiches finally came, there was nary a strip of bacon in sight. In the interests of time, we asked that they just bring the bacon and we'd take care of it, rather than a remake. Once we dug in, except for being a little light on cheese, the sandwiches tasted OK, but they had gotten a little cold as well.

I got the Signature Short Rib Benedict, which is an eggs benedict dish with braised short ribs served on a crispy potato cake. It was a creative idea, however, it was way too salty in my opinion and the crispy potato cake wasn't as it sounded. Turned out more like mashed potatoes (which were still tasty). My friend ordered the yogurt, which sounds plain, but I was amused with how it was served. It was a big wide bowl of yogurt! Like how oatmeal is served. It made me laugh :) I would give this place another try I'm in the area and need breakfast, but I wouldn't get my dish again.

I wish they had a spinach and mushroom benedict option for vegetarians (they only have 2 meat benedict options) - when I asked to substitute the meat for spinach and mushrooms instead, we were charged an additional $3 - which I can't justify. I hate that they completely overcharge my sister every time she orders juice - a consistent issue with the bartender we have had because we go so often. It makes me angry just thinking about how they rip her off of just pouring 2 concentrate juices into a tiny glass.

I didn't like how the waiter would ask my friend, do you want soup or salad on the side? when it didn't even come with the entree.  The waiter  pretty much tried to upsell my friends, misleading them; that it came with our entree. Lucky I asked before they placed the order in.

This is a random little open bar/restaurant in the Cosmopolitan in Vegas. You've been to or seen a million of these kinds of places and they're generally okay for a quick bite. I got in late for a work trip so i decided to stop by. I happened to be the only person sitting at the bar. The bartender handed me a menu and grabbed a drink order. The menu isn't huge... but just like every other little open bar in vegas they do breakfast, lunch and dinner all day. The bartender recommended a burger so i went with that. Their burgers are a create-your-own style and you get to choose 3 special items to go on there. Feeling a little crazy, i did bacon, avocado and a friend egg. No cheese? Whats wrong with me?? 
Cue the black and white 1950's gangster movie scene:
The bartender comes over, starts hand-drying some dishes and says ""so what's getting to you boss?"" As he sets my whiskey down in front of me. This was pretty hilarious as this literally was a scene out of a movie. Anyway...
I can't even describe to you the amazingness of this burger. I would have given this place 5 stars had i had this burger and had to fight a thousand rats to get to it. Not only was it the best burger I've ever had, i literally had a dream about it recently. This is the worlds only 6 star burger. I don't even remember what side it came with, because i couldn't care less. Everything i did that day became absolutely obsolete. The egg was fried perfectly. The bacon was crispy and fresh. The avocado was half of the most perfectly ripe avocado ever served. The burger itself was fantastically medium well (don't kill me but i love it). The bun was slightly toasted just enough so it had a crunch. Need i go on?",sWU5xarXp1AnfnBwcego9A,2,1,5,K3MxuSo_MBzUOjeVIh2Ybg

Braised short rib Benedict-  presentation is awesome and the flavor had a good base but a little salty.

It was my boyfriend's, ahem, I mean fiance's birthday, and we go to Vegas, it's just our thing.  I remembered how much I LOVED the short rib benedict and couldn't wait to get at it again.  My fiance ordered the blueberry pancakes like last time and it was as good as he remembered.  But, the short rib benedict fell short, way short for me.  There was barely any meat under those two eggs.  And the eggs were too runny.  I like the yolk runny but the whites need to hold some kind of consistency other than goo.  

We came back the next morning for breakfast and NO I will not have the short ribs again so I went for the corned beef hash.  I've had REAL corned beef hash and I've had canned corned beef hash.  This was somewhere in the middle.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but when you're comparing it to something a little better then canned hash it shouldn't cost as much as it did.  Fiance got the plain pancakes this time and again, he loved it.  He even threw in some sausage which he didn't complain about.  

We had mimosas the first morning and coming from San Francisco where brunch is a big thing, we're used to having bottomless mimosas on the menu.  At about $10 a pop our brunch came to well over a $100 for 2.  The 2nd morning he had 1 mimosa and I had a bloody mary.  It was ok; I've had better.

The prime rib was so tender, perfectly cooked & topped with Swiss it seemed to simultaneously melt in my mouth with the bread. Add to that the horseradish sauce & it just took it to another level.

4484711,2018-05-07,3,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"I had eaten at The Henry not long after the Cosmopolitan opened. It was the final ""party"" of the fabulous wine/food pairing series of events that the hotel offered for free to locals, which were usually held in the now-defunct wine shop on the second floor. I didn't write a review then because I hadn't paid for the meal.

Since we were going to see Opium at Rose. Rabbit. Lie., we decided to have a quick dinner at the restaurant. I'd made a reservation, which turned out to be unnecessary, and the hostess seated me while my husband was parking. The first try was a combination booth/table in a dark corner, and it looked very uncomfortable. Next was a table for two, and it was awful. I should have asked for a larger one, but missed my cue. It was also a half booth, but I was able to look out on the casino instead of a wall. But the table was very uncomfortable: way too long, so we were too far away from each other, but not wide enough.

We ordered two sandwiches, and told our waiter, Claudio, that we were going to share both. I did like that we were able to get salads instead of fries, but the bowls they're served in are pointed on each end, making it difficult to eat. What didn't end up on the table made its home on my brand-new sweater. And yes, I had a napkin on my lap.

Our sandwiches came out quickly. The corned beef reuben had almost no meat, and what was there was almost all fat. The grilled chicken was served on their version of sourdough. I'm not a big fan of sourdough, but this had none of the characteristics of that bread; it seemed like plain old white bread. And it was a mess: hard to eat, with pieces of the very small chicken breast falling out and the bread breaking up. Instead of plates, they serve sandwiches on a slice of paper sitting on a board. This meant that I was literally eating off paper. I don't like to eat from paper. Call me old-fashioned, but I like plates. Either the waiter or the kitchen didn't bother to split the sandwich halves for us, so we had to exchange them across that long divide. Not classy.

We didn't bother to order a replacement, so we made do with the two little side salads and half a sandwich each. At least we weren't charged for the extra salad. The only positive thing I can say is that there was a good amount of avocado along with the measly chicken.

No manager ever came to our table, which I think is a piss-poor way of dealing with customers who send back a food item. The waiter service was perfunctory at best.

The braised short rib is so tender with a great sauce on it.  The egg was cooked perfectly so that the yolk oozes out when you cut into it.  Then there are some potatoes on the bottom soaking up all the egg yolk and short rib juice.... yum!  My only complaint is that there is no bread that comes with the benedict.  I mean, can it be a benedict without some kind of bread?  

The wife got an egg white omelette which she says was very good.  One of my other complaints about this place was that they brought us lukewarm coffee.  That is a big no no in my book.

The prices are reasonable for the Vegas Strip and people watching is free.

1) You'll find the food passable if you're used to dining at Sizzler-level establishments. Otherwise, gross.

2) Hate getting stuck under drafty AC vents at restaurants? When you sit down at The Henry, look up. You'll notice that nearly every table is below a vent. Really?

3) Our original server was a jackass. We waited 20+ minutes for him when we first sat down until another employee eventually told us he was taking a 'longer-than-usual break.' After a few more minutes of complete confusion/idiocy from the waitstaff, a combination of no less than 3 members of their team just ended up serving us. 

You'd think this would be okay until you realize no one can figure out who the hell is responsible for the various tasks that make a meal out (refilling drinks, taking orders, actually serving the food, etc.) with a setup like this.

Oh yeah, our original server eventually returned as well (pointed out by other staff members). Too bad he ended up looking down at the floor each time I glared at him, scurrying away from our vicinity with the utmost of urgency.

Last nail in the coffin - our table's order was relatively small since the group was only composed of myself and two females who don't necessarily have the biggest appetites (total order was something like 2 coffees, an OJ, 2 breakfast sandwiches, tots side, and a corned beef hash). 

Final bill? ~$150. 

If you do the math, that means it cost about 66% more to eat at The Henry than at Wicked Spoon, which runs around $30 per person after taxes. I have my own issues with WS, but unless you like to go to restaurants to pay and not eat food, there's a clear winner here.",59QzQ3-dmOD1USV2hQpwkw,0,0,1,bFtbwxY9_VlfHEmpNtTchQ

Almost every hotel-casino in Vegas has at least one 24-hour diner-type restaurant, The Henry is Cosmo's version.  And since it's the Cosmo, it's shiny and gorgeous to look at, with abundant chandeliers and glittery surfaces (natch).  It's located right off the casino floor, across from the Bond bar. (Watch your head, since selfie stick-wielding tourists are everywhere.  I may or may not have been smacked by one.)  

The place was quite busy on a Friday morning, but there was plenty of room at the bar, where the full menu is available.  

I ordered a whole grain waffle with a side of chicken apple sausage.  The waffle was extremely delicious and even somewhat healthy, thanks to the abundant yogurt and fresh strawberries.  Unfortunately, the chicken apple sausage wasn't nearly as good -- it tasted slimy, like it had been sitting in the fridge for too long.

I washed down my breakfast with a much-needed cappucino, which was quite tasty.  I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but getting through a day on the Las Vegas Strip always seems to require that extra jolt of energy.

Another plus about The Henry: very friendly staff.  I've found that most Strip restaurants have a cold or stand-offish staff with major chips on their shoulders, but not here.  They make their customers feel at home.  That's reason enough to come back!",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,7,6,4,pg0xD7tbBWJjrISzRIKoXQ

Well, I have definitely been over carbing on this trip, so I didn't really mind the loss of the bread, but texture, that I did mind.  Soft eggs, generous tender slices of short rib, stacked over browned soft potato cakes - you did not need teeth to eat this.

It's like a New York diner that went to finishing school for a few years and came back a proper lady. Leather upholstery, smartly-dressed waiters and a menu lousy with truffled this and organic that. They stop serving breakfast some time before noon, but luckily for my egg-obsessed boyfriend, they have 3 breakfast plates that they serve all day. 

I'm not so breakfast-reliant and opted instead for the tuna melt on marble rye. It was, without reservation, the best tuna sandwich I've ever had from a restaurant. The rye was buttery and crisply toasted, the tuna was smooth with just a hint of vegetable crunch (I hate chunks of greens in my tuna salad) and the perfect amount of melted cheese (Swiss, I think). I chose fries as my side. They were salty, delicious shoestrings in a little metal pot. I ate every single one. Literally. 

They skew toward the pricey side, which keeps me from awarding them 5 stars. But it's Vegas, it's the Strip, and it's located in the newest, hippest hotel ON the strip. So for those reasons, they can get away with it. 

But seriously, the food is great. I'd recommend it to anyone.",3PaNIWP2uFZBcayFa1yUkQ,1,0,4,Me2mZ993-HwiCGIhDYz5gQ

I had the Rose All Day and that was good. It was bubbly and sweet. Definitely started my day a little tipsy!

I ordered the California omelet with a side of truffle tater tots. The omelet was the most beautiful omelet I have ever had. The egg was perfectly colored and it was stuffed in the most perfect shape. It was really good too. They didn't skimp out on any of the toppings and everything was evenly spread. The truffle tater tots were amazing. The tots were super crispy and hot with a hint of truffle. 

We got a plate of the french toast to share. I only had a bite because I was so full but it was definitely a nice way to end the meal.

The worse part is the service. It took forever to get any attention. Asking for a side of toast should not take 20 minutes.

On Friday, July 4th, after a happenin' night out with my girlfriends, it was our goal to find food; fried, fatty food to be exact. Well I don't know if people know this, but there is not an abundance of fast food choices available inside The Cosmopolitan. We were desperate for food so we asked a nice bartender where we would find french fries and a burger at the hour of 3 a.m. She directed us to The Henry. We arrived at the entrance to the restaurant and we were quickly seated by a pleasant gentleman. Our waiter shortly followed and took our drink orders. After thoroughly reviewing the menu, and subsequently stumbling upon the fried chicken sandwich, my mind was made up. We all ordered our food and then we waited, and waited, and, well, waited some more. Now, I don't know if it just seemed like an eternity due to the hour of the day or our level of intoxication, but man... waiting for our food was like waiting for a popsicle to melt in Antarctica. 

Finally, our food arrived! And ohhhh myyyy gahhhh.... it was sooooooooo good. I would gladly have waited for another hour if I had known what was in store. The spicy chicken sandwich is unreal. I'm talking crunchy, fried, spicy, two layers of chicken with a tasty and tangy slaw in the middle on a delicious bun with pickles. Throw a side of french fries next to it and it wins the best looking couple of the year award in my book. Classiest, most expensive, but well-worth-it drunk food.

The Henry disappointed. For the price it commanded... we expected:

1.) It to survive a cab ride home on the strip. We asked for it to be medium and not bipolar (cold on the outside, warm on the inside).

2.) For it to not be dry

3.) For it to have cheese

Our party of 4 ordered the Traditional Benedict, 2 breakfast sandwiches and one oatmeal.  I had the Benedict, which I liked a lot. The menu boasted of its ""Real Canadian Bacon, English Muffin & Hollandaise"".  I didn't realize fake Canadian bacon is a big problem?  Are cheaper Canadian-style bacons from Maine or Minnesota being passed off as the real thing?  Why isn't the English muffin real too?  Ok, enough fun -  good Benedict (I'm a Benedict aficionado), but not truly exceptional. 

The breakfast sandwiches were well received, but they were stoopid huge and maybe a little on the bland side flavor-wise.  My sister-in-law liked her oatmeal, and the round of orange juices for the table were good as well. 

At home I'd probably have given The Henry 4 stars, but the standards have to be higher in Las Vegas - if you're in a food town, you gotta step it up a notch. I liked The Henry a lot and wouldn't hesitate to go back.  But for the price (expensive but reasonable for the Strip) and for Las Vegas it is a solid but unexceptional choice.

4856714,2013-04-08,2,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"Blink and you might miss The Henry as you walk out of the Cosmopolitan and onto the Vegas strip. It looks like an unassuming coffee shop that is tucked off to the corner, right at the Cosmo's side entrance that is the closest to the Bellagio.

We first stumbled across it one early morning while searching for a nearby breakfast option, and decided to give it a try. I am so glad we did. It is now a ""must visit"" whenever I am in the area early in the morning or when staying at the Cosmopolitan.

While The Henry serves up soups, salad, and burgers and is open 24 hours a day, I have (thus far) only come back time and again for their signature Short Rib Benedict that is decadence on a plate. 

Imagine a sexy hunk of skillfully braised beef short sitting atop a somewhat crunchy yet delicate potato cake, the whole floating in a glistening meat sauce. This is topped with a couple of expertly poached eggs (that remain firm to the touch, but bleed their citrine yolks at the slightest poke from your fork), a luscious Hollandaise sauce, and a smattering of caviar for added effect. It's the stuff that dreams are made of.

I can also vouch for their Cinnamon Roll French Toast when I've been in the mood for something sweet over something savoury, which is dipped in an unctuous vanilla custard and served with maple syrup, creamery butter, and candied pecans.

If you visit early in the morning and the Hungarian-born Attila is working the bar, you're in line for whole other treat, especially if you like to get your Vegas drink on before noon. If that's the case, I would highly recommend sitting at the bar and passing on the coffee and orange juice, as Attila is quite the mixologist and it would be a shame to let his talents go to waste. 

My favorite cocktail, that pairs ever-so-nicely with the Short Rib Benedict, is The Henry's Midtown Manhattan. Imagine some bacon-infused Maker's Mark bourbon, some cinnamon and fig infused sweet vermouth, and a mix of bitters (including Aztec chocolate bitters). Perfection!

If you absolutely need coffee with your breakfast, ask Attila to make you a Beam Me Up Scotty, which mixes Van Gogh Double Espresso Vodka with Tia Maria, a shot of Espresso, and a creamy vanilla syrup. There's also a nice selection of unique Bloody Mary drinks, including the Spicy Swine that uses that tasty bacon-infused bourbon in place of vodka.",DB8eZawJlQxbWc2I7aJ_vQ,1,1,5,6_C64iu2FjuHdUq1lVBSkA

Leave it to the Cosmopolitan to modernize and elevate the concept of the Vegas-strip hotel institutions, including the 24-hour diner. What they've done to buffets (see: Wicked Spoon), they've unnecessarily done to the 24-hour diner.

(The other 2, for the record, are the fantastic Citizens @ Mandalay Bay and Grand Lux Cafe @ Venetian and Palazzo.)
The Henry has a much more upscale feel than a standard diner, with plush leather booths and chairs, nice silver, and cloth napkins.  The menu is simple, but it has the essentials: burgers, breakfast anytime, etc.  My favorite item is, by far, the French Dip.  Nicely toasted, never soggy on the bottom, bun, quality beef, and a delicious, not-to-salty au jus.  If you are a first timer, you should absolutely try the truffle tater tots with whatever you get, although their basic fries are excellent as well.  They have a few fun specialty cocktails as well, and their location, right near the north entrance is both convenient, as well as great for people watching  or listening to the music coming from the bar next door.  (It can be noisy late night, but that can be part of the fun.  Just be aware, its often not a quiet place to eat.)",MS5160dww4tX3x03cfk3jA,0,0,5,Ex22vgGc3avnP4v9-yXybQ

5022974,2014-02-02,0,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"On my last visit to Las Vegas, I had breakfast at the Henry on two separate occasions.  The Henry has been a regular breakfast stop every time I'd stayed at the Cosmopolitan.  It had been, up until now, a model of consistency given its high-end 24-hour casino diner status.  However, both visits on this trip provided wildly different experiences, which also offered two distinct data points indicating that things are amiss at the Henry.

First, good, consistent service has noticeably slipped.  On Saturday morning around 11am with a party of six, our service was fast, friendly and attentive.  On Tuesday morning around 10am, service was largely AWOL as it took over 25 minutes for our breakfasts to come out after placing our orders with no interim stops at our table by our server to check up on us or to explain/apologize for the excessive wait for our food.  Second, the food quality, execution, and portion sizes have nosedived.  I had the Short Rib Benedict ($19) on Saturday.  While it was still a tender, flavorful, and savory hunk of meat, it was noticeably a much smaller portion than I'd received on previous trips to the Henry.  The short rib isn't served atop an English muffin, but instead a potato hash.  However, this time the hash was desiccated, crispy, flavorless, and not very appetizing.  It wasn't a good result for this previously awesome dish.  On Tuesday, I had the Breakfast Burrito ($16).  It, too, was noticeably smaller than I remembered.  More damning was that after the excessive wait to get it, the burrito was only warm, not hot, and seemingly soggy and limp.  It had likely sat around for a while before being brought out to me.  However, the ultimate failure was that I bit into a foreign object, an inch-long sliver of clear plastic, found in the center of my burrito.  While the server did the right (and only) thing and took my burrito of our bill, it was really too late to recover from an awful experience.   At least the Illy coffee that they serve was good and hot on both visits.

Everyone has an off day.  That said, the slippage at the Henry is painfully apparent.  While I will stay at the Cosmopolitan again, the same can't be said about a return visit to the Henry.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,2,0,2,RWx6SEDCTwUYKm8IXr3XZQ

I was intrigued by this place because it's one of those 24 hour cafe's at every hotel except this one doesn't have the the looks and feels of one. Already late for lunch, there was no question that the French dip was the way to go, as it came with tater tots with a slight hint of truffle oil! With so many restaurants in Vegas that make you order fries separately with their sandwiches or burgers, this is a huge plus! How many places come with sides with their steaks in Vegas? Exactly my point. Especially since it isn't built into the price, it felt like a great deal here. The french dip tasted great, and we finished all the tater tots. The only thing I wished was that I could choose how the prime rib was cooked, but they said it's already pre-prepared..oh well.

My main complaint with The Henry is their beignet dish. If you've ever been to NOLA and had the cafe du monde beignets (and you like those), please don't order the beignets here!!! It's sweet but tastes more like a doughnut hole than anything else?? Wish we had ordered the French toast or the banana foster doughnuts for the table to share instead. 
I couldn't decide between the grilled cheese w tomato soup and the short rib Benedict. So my friend and I split the two dishes. They were both really good!! The Benedict isn't your traditional Benedict on a breakfast muffin...it all sits on top of hashed potatoes instead. I prefer the traditional Benedict but their version was still good!!

5278304,2015-07-02,3,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"Me and my guy came here to try out the 2 for $40 menu at The Henry on a Monday night. The Henry is a 24/7 diner at the Cosmopolitan casino with food comparable to the quality at Denny's but priced exceptionally higher. I had a reservation through OpenTable, but the restaurant was practically empty when we arrived. The hostess, interestingly enough, tried to seat us directly next to another table in a cramped booth. At least seat me one table down woman! This ain't Europe and the place is a ghost town. Upon request, she moved us one table over without saying a word. Yeah, she wasn't very friendly.

The server shows up and I ask about the 2 for $40 menu since they didn't give us that menu when seated. He says we need a coupon. Um, no we don't. He says ""Let me check"". The hostess silently comes by and unceremoniously drops off the special menus. I knew beforehand that no vegetarian options were offered as entrees, but I called ahead and asked if they would accommodate me and they said they could. On the phone, I was given the choice of a salad or wrap. In person, the waiter said the chef could make me a veggie burger. I'd rather have a burger anyways! Up until this point the service sucked. Something changed along the way and our server did a 180. He started checking on us more frequently and made sure to bring out one dish after the other, but only when we were finished and ready. What could easily have been a 2 star review turned into a 3 star review thanks to him. 

STARTER - CAESAR SALAD: Wasn't a fan of the dressing, it could've used more of a kick. The lettuce looked kind of sad. 2/5

MAIN ENTREE - VEGGIE BURGER: My burger came with a side of fries. It was huge! The burger came with mushrooms and cheddar cheese. Odd combo. Grilled mushrooms usually come with Swiss cheese. Just saying. 3/5
MEATLOAF - Served with mashed potatoes with gravy and peas. It looked like a brown SpongeBob. My husband didn't say much about his entree. I'll interpret his silence as a 3/5. 

DESSERT - CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM: The server said the ice cream was house made. The ice cream was super chocolatey and satisfied my sweet tooth. 3.5/5
VANILLA ICE CREAM - chocolate ice cream is better! I thought it lacked flavor and just tasted like ice to me. 2/5

Worth a Return Visit? 
The water tastes like crap and leaves a slimy taste in your mouth, forcing you to order a fountain drink. Guess how much those are? $5! Are you friggin kidding me?? Honestly, I would've preferred Denny's. Sure Henry's is nicer, but why would you shell out $50+ for 2 star food?

I was not familiar with this french sauce, and took the chance that the carefully selected menu would not disappoint upon this inclusion. I also ordered the chicken apple sausage as a benedict in my world is not complete without an accompanying meat or fish. 

I highly recommend both; the muffin stayed crisp through the sauce, and the 'lightly poached' description on the egg was accurate - it was a beautiful sphere that was balanced on the spinach on each muffin half, cloaked in a coral glaze. The composition was spectacular, and the weighty flatware made the physical act of cutting bites its own bounty of pleasure. With a crisp, firm, moist sausage to absorb the perfectly runny yolk and more of this intriguing sauce, the dish blew my mind. 

In the new era of quality - even on the casino floor - I wasn't surprised the dish was good, but I didn't expect it to be excellent and memorable. One of the best breakfasts I've had in quite a while.",riETmgv8NnaNfTWhXc-XDA,2,0,5,2vDf9UnWtYcI90gnTOZnMw

I am very big on service.. due to my egg allergy. I came here very early in the morning with a group of 7 friends so you can only imagine they only offered the breakfast menu.. which consists of egg infested selections. That's perfectly fine for me, I always manage to order something without eggs or simply ask them to make it without eggs.

I ordered the breakfast burrito and informed our waiter that I have an allergy.. which means that not only can I NOT have eggs, but I cannot eat anything that includes it (such as ranch, mayo, etc) and it cannot be cooked with it as well. The waiter said he'd make sure of it. The food came out promptly. Two bited later, my lips started to itch and swell. Fortunately for me.. my reactions come quickly so I am able to prevent myself from eating more and getting worst reactions. So I simply informed our waiter that I was getting allergies and for him to take the plate away. He asked me if I wanted anything else and I declined. I was not upset, I understand that he did everything that he could within his own power. 

Shortly after, the manager came up to me and asked me about my allergy. Instead of apologizing, he wanted to make it a point that there were no eggs in the burrito. I explained to him that if my food even touches eggs or gets cooked on the same pan, I will get the same reaction and I understand that it's a breakfast menu so there are risks for me eating during breakfast hours. He then asked if I wanted to make a claim, in which I politely declined. He insisted and said that he has to because of policy. Then why even bother asking?? So I told him to do whatever he needs to do.

A few minutes later, two paramedics showed up next to me asking me if I add asked for urgent care. I told them I did not request for it. They asked if I was having allergy reaction and I said I was, but it was light and that it wasn't an emergency. They offered me benedryl but I declined because it has no affect on me. They left to go discuss with the manager, in which at this point.. I was already embarassed by the scene they caused. Everyone was staring at me like I was going to pass out and die. And after all that, they had the nerve to come back and ask me to sign a consent form stating that I had refused their service. That was my last straw. I told them I was signing any paperwork and to just bring us the bill and they still managed to charge our table after the chaos they had just created when I simply told them to take back my plate.

I don't know the manager's name, but this gives Cosmopolitan a really bad name. Learn to understand that CUSTOMERS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT and it's not your job to prove us wrong. I don't care if you disected my burrito to make there was no eggs, I think me having ALLERGIC REACTION is enough to prove the point. Not only did you ruin my meal, you ruined the rest of my day. You bet I am writing to corporate about this and I hope whoever has allergies can understand my pain and not support such poor management.",KP7_25EAHd9Zfq4x9pfqfA,6,0,1,811h6LjBj2T_NmRzAxpGAg

The Henry is just another one of those 24/7 strip cafés  with an upscale modern feel. 

I was staying at the Cosmopolitan and was craving some a juicy hamburger and thought about , ""The Henry."" Having a 24/7 café is crucial in your Vegas hotel, if you want to avoid walking outside looking for a Denny's or some other late night diner.  

But anyways, like other reviews has pointed out, this restaurant is always packed and the service was outstanding! 

Items I've ordered here:

+ $19: Signature Short Rib Benedict - braised short ribs, hollandaise, crispy potatoe cakes = Phenomenona!

+ $18: The Henry Breakfast - ham, sunny side eggs, breakfast potato, toast = Delish!

Their Dill/Cucumber smashed Bloody Mary is to die for!!!  Their coffee is divine. The service was great both times AND there was little to no wait times to eat!

The first day 2 girls ordered the Short Rib Benedict- Hot Damn is that good!  It was so good, in fact, they wanted it AGAIN the next day and sure as shit they both ordered it AGAIN!!!!!  

But truly the most AMAZING THING is their Gruyere cheese hashbrown cake of LOVE. I actually thought it was a Risotto cake at first, but BY GOD IS THAT GOOD!  It's hashbrowns, onions, and cheese in a latkes style hashbrown circle of mouth watering, tongue tingling DELECTABLENESS. Need I say more?  Don't even think of not getting this thing. It's so good other people did without fries or tater tots; which by the way, they have as well, to get this as their side item instead. It can't be good for you, but by golly is it good!

I got a burger the 2nd day as it was 11 o'clock on Saturday and they had a brunch menu, it was delicious as well.

The first day we sat at the bar and the server was so amazing and soo attentive. He was super entertaining and checked on us frequently. I had the short rib benedict. (im an eggs benedict fanatic its my go to item on every menu) it was a huge portion, super hearty and flavorful. The flavors just mixed so well together, the hollandaise sauce and the sauce from the short rib. I could barely finish all the food on the plate. Also their orange juice is sooooo good, you can taste the freshness 
   On the second day I ordered the all natural omelet with a side of fruit. First of all the side of fruit was the best combination of fruit I've ever ordered at a restaurant. There was star fruit, pomegranate, strawberry,mangos and blueberry. The veggies inside the omelet were cooked perfectly and complimented each other very well. Again the portion was very big and I couldn't finish but that is a good thing. The person i was with got the Belgian waffle both days with fruit and whip cream on top,they love waffles and absolutely loved the waffles at the Henry. Devoured the waffles both days.
     Next time im in vegas I will definitely return for breakfast, the food quality is very good here and im sure anything on the menu is going to be good to eat. The environment was also great. the cosmopolitan hotel itself is beautiful, but the décor inside the henry is very nice and very well thought out. it is a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy a good meal.",ka7BrA-9PRyQikuZB1MsLg,1,0,5,lNwrB6z_cGfYdCajK8YtUA

5515013,2013-09-16,6,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"Considering The Cosmopolitan is the newest resort on the Strip, it's not surprising that nearly every aspect of the hotel is so trendy and nice.  However, it's still pretty surprising that even their 24-hour diner/cafe looks great.  Definitely nicer than some random Denny's or IHOP!

Unlike the vast majority of Cosmo''s restaurants and eateries, The Henry is located on the ground floor (by the entrance closest to the Bellagio) as opposed to the second and third floors.  Despite being so close to the casino though, it's pretty cool how the restaurant isn't at all loud or smokey.  Although there seemed to be a decent sized crowd waiting to be seated, it only took about 10-15 minutes to get a table for brunch on a Sunday.

While I normally would have opted for an actual brunch type of dish, I decided instead to go with the CORNED BEEF REUBEN with a side of Truffle Tater Tots based on what others had mentioned on Yelp.  The dish sounded pretty good, but to be honest, the truffle tater tots was what got me excited.  It's a combination of two fantastic things!

As far as portions go, the reuben was certainly a winner - the sandwich was practically bursting open.  However, I don't think it tasted as amazing as how others have described.  I certainly appreciated all that meat, but the abundance of sauerkraut was very overwhelming (think sauerkraut with corned beef rather than corned beef with sauerkraut).  Conversely, the tater tots were just as good as I had hoped.  They could have been a little crispier, but that's a minor quibble.  I just wish there had been more!

Even though the service was good enough for me to round up from THREE AND A HALF STARS, I'm rounding down specifically because of price.  The reuben wasn't awful at $16, but $5.00 for a diet coke?  That's ridiculous, even by Vegas standards.  Next time, I'll just stick with a cup of water and get my diet coke comped at the tables..",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,7,7,3,5kaErjH41U_hOq2W-W3gcw

My friend is a pescitarian, I don't eat hamburgers and his friend, well, I have no idea. Holstein's was clearly out of the question, and almost everything else was closed. We ended up at The Henry. 

Drinks. We got drinks. A long island iced tea, an apple martini for them, and a ""Beam Me Up Scotty"" martini for me, at $12/ each.

Dropped by here on my last day of my stay at the Cosmo for breakfast.  I ordered the breakfast croissant with avocado.  It was just perfect. The fresh squeezed OJ was poured out of a martini shaker and swirled into a martini glass!  The croissant was the perfect amount of flakiness yet held the sandwich together perfectly.

My colleague enjoyed his omelette and share with me a taste of his hash browns which were seasoned with a tater tot spice!  Yes I would come back here just for that!

Our table was located right in the middle of the aisle too.  Since we were checking out, it was a bit cumbersome as I felt like my bags were going to get spilt upon by the waiter.  Also, if you are checking out by cab, the restaurant is located near the front while the lobby is located in the back of the hotel.

I think that The Henry and the Vesper Lounge should switch locations, but that is really about it.  The food is nice and hearty.  It is what I would define as a full European breakfast that is best served as a brunch for those who like to only eat two meals a day (my recommended strategy when in Vegas).",vbXmCVj1RZ4civT7nrcKyw,2,1,4,TbshuXGMoQrwMLVBjWHUyQ

Short rib Benedict was so savory and delicious. What I think was a rice base (instead of English muffin for example), was topped with short rib meat, Demi glaze and two perfectly poached eggs. Literally couldn't stop eating it.

It was about 10am and the place wasn't crowded and there was no line up....so we were seated immediately.

Like at the previous morning, I ordered what was called The Henry Breakfast.... supposedly one of the ""Specialty"" breakfasts. Again, you get to choose how you want your eggs with a choice of pork sausage or chicken apple sausage, hash browns, and toast....I ordered an egg white scramble and the chicken apple sausage this time. My friends ordered the Croque-Monsieur Omelet which was filled with Canadian bacon, caramelized onions
Swiss cheese, with breakfast potato and toast on the side.

The portions were very generous and our server was very nice enough to have the kitchen split their dish into two, and both their plates looked like FULL breakfast orders! The breakfast was excellent and well worth the $18 for all that food.....of course it's a bit expensive, but this is the Cosmo on the Strip....so what did you expect. If you're looking for some place cheaper then I'm sure there's a Denny's somewhere within a few miles of the strip. 

All I will say is the breakfast was absolutely delicious.....my eggs were perfectly cooked, smooth and fluffy, the hash browns unique and yummy, the chicken apple sausage and sourdough toast just made for a perfect.....and very filling.....breakfast.

We arrived just a little after 11am. I thought that's reasonably early for Sunday brunch, but we were quoted and waited 40+ minutes to be seated.  I almost got into an argument with the hostess when we were updated ""10 more minutes"" when we had to still wait double that time, not to mention seeing some parties seemingly able to walk in without being placed in the queue.  Having said that, I checked out the line at Eggslut, and the line wrapping around the wall was likely at least a 30 minute wait also. 

Once seated, the service was very good. We ordered immediately because we were obviously starving by then. Fortunately, both the short rib egg Benedict and Brioche french toast came out fast.  They were both very good, although not spectacular. The latter was gigantic; I had to ask for a box to fit the last 1/3. 

Aside:  I was not convinced that the bottled water provided for every table was truly bottled, as it had a slightly funny taste, but it was free, so I guess I can't complain too much. 

Tip: Call 702-698-7280 for direct line to the restaurant for placement into the queue. That is, if they're not too busy to pick up the phone. 

Just realized after I wrote the review initially: you can book a reservation on Yelp!

During Restaurant Week I began with a giant crock of French Onion Soup brimming with melted Gruyere on the outside, and sherry and a quickly deconstructing Crostini on the inside.  It was a superb, cheesy first-class Onion Soup Gratinee!

I next enjoyed a chopped Caesar Salad prepared with a light and tart Caesar Dressing and nice crunchy croutons, although no anchovies were available to kick the dish up a notch.

For my entree I selected Meatloaf with Whipped Potatoes, gravy, a slab of spiced up bacon, and peas.  The Meatloaf was moist and really comforting with the Brown Gravy slathered liberally over it.  And for dessert I savored a really traditional New York Style Cheesecake with Strawberries and Strawberry Sauce.  Diane liked her Fish & Chips.

Came here at like 3AM and wanted some late night breakfast style food to soak up the large amounts of...uh...soda. The Henry is 24 hours so it's a great place to eat if you're not willing to eat fast food late night, and it's a great place to go if you end your night after Secret Pizza closes.

Parking 4/5
If you're coming here as late as I did...you shouldn't be driving anywhere.

Ambience 4/5 
Lots of comfortable seating and booths. Late night you won't get the hustle and bustle of the casino, because the tables in this section close. 

Wait time 4/5
Fine, just fine. Didn't notice waiting for food, and we got sat down immediately.

Food 4/5
Needed something to soak up my sins. Here's what I got:

Grilled cheese and tomato soup - A
So. Good. Grilled cheese had three different cheeses. Crispy on the outside and ooey-gooey-cheesy in the middle of every bite. Tomato soup had Pedro in it. Interesting addition...loved it!

Service 4/5
Server was great. She took our order quickly and made sure we had LOTS of water throughout our visit.

Overall 4/5
Really good and simple food. My brother-in-law had the short rib benedict which he really liked. I just feel like the prices are a little too steep for the food they offer. Other than that, awesome.",TXJ59_oLDI4e8kDSvWmleQ,4,1,4,7xDm6sxE7yZYHyFrzY4mLQ

Maybe a text message.   It is 2016.  Why would you not want people to gamble while they wait.   Come back in 20 minutes and stand.   That because there is no chairs.  No big deal unless with and old person.   The 30 minute window was way off.  It turned into 50 minute wait.   Table still had crumbs on it from the last person.   Service good.  Had a Bloody Mary.  I would give this a 1 star.  However I never found a very good one in Vegas though.  Food was good.   Big portions and was fast.,x9txomt_2I-48pZWgt-uTg,0,0,3,dlHh2-adlJ298qvSCVsKlQ

The customer service was OK, nothing that blew me away.  Honestly, the bartender seemed kind of annoyed that we only ordered 2 shots.  We were actually just bar-hopping from The Henry, to Chandelier and to Bond.  Of the 3, I prefer The Henry the least probably because it has the most serious setting and it seems a little more intimate and formal compared to the 3.  

Price was on the higher end.  We paid about thirty-something dollars for 2 shots.  The Henry was good to try but it's probably not somewhere I would go regularly if in the Cosmopolitan area.",-WYbVngIGDQ81MY12UtwnA,3,3,3,UZUx_ihROvFfzxVMQS2UyQ

Many restaurants in Vegas don't worry too much about the hospitality part of their establishments- and they ultimately pay the price. From the hostess to Vincent the server who treats everyone with kindness (and patience!), to the food runners to the bartenders...everyone seems to care about creating a wonderful culinary and rich dining experience for their customers. It can be a little loud in the restaurant later in the morning but it's often a quiet and tranquil refuge in the oasis of noise and self-centeredness that is Sin City.

AMBIANCE: I absolutely LOVE all of the Cosmopolitan's interior designers. Every single area of the Cosmopolitan shows impeccable attention to detail, including the Henry. From the brown leather wall paneling, the belt loops around the bar stools, the cushy button tufted booths, and how all of it just comes together.. gorgeous.
PRICE: $20-$30/person
VALUE: It seems to really depend on what you order. I saw my friend order a waffle for breakfast, and it looked extremely plain and unsatisfying. I feel like a lot of the other lunch/dinner items seem pretty solid, but I've really only tried (and loved) the French Dip. (The Cosmopolitan is really the first Las Vegas hotel/casino I've been to where a majority of the restaurants typically serve good food, and the Henry is no exception.)
CHANCE OF RETURNING: 100%

___________________________________

:::: THE FOOD ::::

* THE FRENCH DIP - $16
          - [4/5 - The best french dip I have ever tasted. The melted swiss cheese over the tender juicy layers of prime rib... mmm. I also love the horseradish sauce and the au jus is deliciously flavored and generously (yet appropriately) salted.]
* TRUFFLE TATER TOTS (Included)
          - [4/5 - Perfectly cooked, the right amount of crunch on the outside, soft on the inside. The truffle oil was used appropriately - it's not overwhelming, yet there's no mistaking it's presence.]

:::: THE DRINKS ::::

* BEAM ME UP SCOTTY - $12
          - [4/5 - One of my favorite breakfast drinks - an espresso ""chocolate"" martini with cream vanilla syrup that contains a Van Gogh Dbl and Tia Maria. Really tasty!]
* BLOODY MARY - $12
          - [4.5/5 - To date, one of the best Bloody Marys I have ever had. I always ask them to make it extra spicy for me, and they never fail. They also put a generous amount of horseradish in it.]
* VIRGIN BLOODY MARY
          - [4.5/5 - The last time I went to the Henry, I was pregnant and yet really craving the flavor of the Bloody Mary. They made me a virgin one that knocked my socks off. It was so refreshing and spicy, though I did add a few extra dollops of Tabasco.]",BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg,5,3,4,z1_3Wq60I4KBUXEOxz_7eg

5959912,2010-12-31,2,Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g,"I was pretty pleased with the food here.

The layout is somewhat awkward and I was seated in a little room that feels a little like an offshoot of the actual restaurant, but I like the privacy and the views of the bar and strip.

I started with a wedge salad topped with bleu cheese, bacon and pear. I think the pear is kind of an afterthought and not necessary for the salad. I enjoyed the dressing quite a bit, but had hoped for more bleu cheese crumbles and for the bacon to be slightly more crisp. Then I had the ribeye steak smothered with bleu cheese and a side of mushrooms. This was prepared perfectly and I was very happy with the flavors and textures. A nice piece of meat. Overall, I was pretty happy with my meal. 

I liken this restaurant more to an upscale cafe than a restaurant, even though I know they don't want to be thought of in that way. The prices are slightly higher than a cafe, but the atmosphere and dining hours definitely resemble that of a cafe. So, I guess I'll call it a hybrid.

The food was pretty good, but the prices were a little higher than I would like to pay for a cafe, so I think it deserves 3 stars. Luckily I didn't have to pay.

Not sure I'll be going out of my way to come back, but if you're in the area and looking for some grub after hours, then go for it. There are so many other better food options here, I'd make this a last resort.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,3,3,UMJ8g2A-U_lI2YoSRn7ZKg
