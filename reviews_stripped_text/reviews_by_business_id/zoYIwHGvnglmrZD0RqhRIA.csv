Not only did we end up waiting a total of about an hour before we got our food, but people that sat down after we ordered got their salads first.  I had all you can eat pasta (Tues night) $7 but they make you buy a $3 drink and I got a salad w/ it but my husband bought the gnocchi dish for $11 and didn't get a salad?  Dumb.  They also charged my husband $1 for adding a couple of shreds of basil to his dish.  My all you can eat plate came out and it was twice the size of his $12 dish and he couldn't get more.  It was terrible!  I had the carbonara sauce and it was okay but super buttery.  

FYI for the vegetarians, all sides are $3, yes, to add spinach to your dish is the same price as adding chicken.

We live right down the street and will not go again.",1sVC_xVc9aTzyYPLL39AZg,0,0,1,uHh1S97xjMjIBWi8kdOwNQ

-it's overpriced for what you get
-the sandwich was nothing near what an Italian sandwich should be. I basically paid $8 and change for a lack luster ham and provolone sandwich.
-the pasta salad was dry and/or old. the center of the pasta was mealy and the edges were hard.

overall was disappointing because I was really hoping I had found a good neighborhood deli.",SH-H_eK-stK1lCKpAkL7LA,0,0,2,aGI89oP1kyYYEj8ysj7Now
403856,2011-02-19,0,zoYIwHGvnglmrZD0RqhRIA,"My husband and I usually go to the Pho restaurant in this plaza, but noticed this place and decided to give it a try. We went with my sister and her boyfriend and child, and we stood in the entrance waiting to be seated and the waitress/hostess, who we later came to find out is actually the OWNER, walked past us several times without even acknowledging our presence. At one point, she stopped at a table right in front of where we were standing and the patrons at that table mentioned that we were waiting for a table, and she made a dismissive remark and gesture and walked away. We probably should have had a clue things wouldn't be great at that point and just left, but we were looking forward to trying some of the things on the menu so my husband went over to the deli side and asked if we could be seated, and a young man apologized and brought us to a table. (Mind you, it wasn't busy, there were two tables with people at them at the time.)

So we sat there, and no one even came to get our drink order. We waited at LEAST a good 15 minutes with no one coming to our table at all. We were all starving and getting annoyed at this point, and we began talking about just going someplace else to eat, because the wait was getting ridiculous with absolutely NO service. The deciding factor was when the ""waitress"" started getting angry at a table nearby when one of them asked for something she had ordered and had apparently been waiting for a long time for. The waitress very nastily, and LOUDLY told her she was getting it and that she had already told her that. We just looked at each other and got up to leave at that point, beyond disgusted with the service, or lack thereof in this place. 

My husband went over to the deli side because he wanted to make a complaint and let them know that the service was unacceptable, and the waitress went over to the other side and at that point asked my husband how she could help him. After ignoring us in the dining room all this time. My husband said he didn't want to talk to her, he wanted to talk to a manager, which is when she informed him SHE was the owner!! Unbelievable! This, of course made my husband even more annoyed that the owner would treat patrons in her restaurant in such a horrible manner and let her know. She dismissively said she was sorry, and that was it. 

I would give this place zero stars if I could, and I can't even give a review on the food, as we never even got the free bread in the 15 or 20 minutes we sat at our table. I'd avoid this place at all costs, unless rudeness is your thing.",EsOq_EegwysF9b0iiFd9aw,2,0,1,vCKLT2m-tQTU-8rqD9GErQ

I was most disappointed with the focaccia, mostly because it is namesake of the restaurant and was strongly recommended by a reviewer in a local newspaper when the restaurant first opened.  I also, love bread, non more so than focaccia.  The fococcia, was like evertything else, meh.  It's just there to distract you from how long it takes to bring your entree.  I had high hopes but they were dashed.  

The night I was there, there was live music by Angelique.  Who was quaint, but also meh.  I appreciated Angelique's efforts, but was disturbed/surprised by the waitress/owner who was talking very loudly with some of her friends at another table, so much so that one couldn't here dear Angelique.

926318,2009-09-15,1,zoYIwHGvnglmrZD0RqhRIA,"I will concur with some of the reviews referring to the service here, it was somewhat subpar.  Our waitress was not attentive at all, but whenver we made a request of the owner it was responded to promptly. The ambience was not at all what we expected.  More of a busy bistro feel than anything romantic.  The actuality of the restaurant doesn't quite live up to the picture of the inside that you find on its website.

Started with the Gorgonzola and Carmelized Onion Focaccia which was rather good.  Kind of left us wanting more.  Split a Caesar Salad which was not really the best, but I was more upset about the fact that they didn't split it for us.  Just gave us one plate and had us do the work.  Not really a deal breaker though.

For our entrees, my wife had the Capalini al Gamberi which was quite good.  Especially the outstanding Tomato flavor throughout the pasta which lingered in your mouth and did everything it should.  I had the Batutta di Pollo alla Daviola and WOW!!!!  This chicken had so much flavor they needed a bigger plate.  The veggies has the flavor of the chicken in them and everything combined in my mouth and made me h-a-p-p-y.

Overall, the food was great.  The service needs help.  And the ambiance needs to live up to it picture.  It would be quite different if it looked like that.",imSdVhXgf882JJsBqZifFg,0,0,3,KibdMnWcN97U63q3IOddKQ

He's the chef and he comes to each table to greet you, offer suggestions and checks back with you the entire duration of your time. The gnocchi is out of this world and made fresh. I also highly recommend the risotto. I've tried the mushroom one and it was well worth the wait. If you want to change up a dish they are open to it.  

It's a little more pricey but I think it's worth it.

We also got a veal dish that my friend loved. We got ice cream, the chocolate, and pistachio were really good. We also got the liminochello cake thing which sucked major. 

Fact is i would have rated this restaurant like a four if the service did not suck big time. It was practically empty, and it took so long for us to get anything. Our meal ended up taking around 2 hours because how slow the service took. 
We also used a groupon we bought and since we had two groupons and 4 people they made us sit at two different tables.

2703865,2009-07-10,1,zoYIwHGvnglmrZD0RqhRIA,"My friends and I spend many days & nights sitting outside the Starbucks adjacent to La Focaccia, and today, based on a prior conversation my friend had with the owner, we decided to have lunch there.

They have a pretty good special, any panini sandwich + soup/salad/or fries & _1_ soda for $7.95. All 3 of us ordered that. I had the salad with a roasted pepper & mozzarella sandwich, Ramze S. had the cream of broccoli soup and a grilled vegetable sandwich, and Dustin X. had the ""tomato whatever"" soup (his words) and some sort of chicken sandwich. We sat outside, and the service was friendly, but quite leisurely. All 3 of us enjoyed both courses, and the portions were generous, especially considering the price tag. After our meals, Ramze S. and I both had gelatos, which were $1.95 and delicious, even if not the greatest gelato in the world.

Overall, I'd be happy to come back here when I had time for a very leisurely lunch, but I'm not sure if there's enough on the menu to hold up through dinner. I was very much on the edge of 3 stars vs 4 for La Focaccia, but considering it's an independent restaurant, I'd rather err on the side of too many stars than too little. Give the place a shot, I think you'll like what you see, even if you don't necessarily fall in love.",21KWy-JENq6xVEly5xki0A,2,0,4,vO4qBkzWvFRtcEGGGctIBQ

3304893,2008-06-11,2,zoYIwHGvnglmrZD0RqhRIA,"We sat outside.  Which was dusty & dirty of course, but we didn't mind.  
Our waiter was nice, but did kind of smell like booze.  His service was quite slow at the start.  He kept coming outside to talk to the other waiter as if we weren't his customers too.  I don't want to hear about your personal shit, really I have enough of my own.

We both had a Pellegrino & a glass of wine.  

We had the Meat & Cheese Antipasto 12.95.  It was okay.  The mozzarella was like Poly-O.  The bread was dry & lacking in flavor.  

For my entree I had a pasta special which was okay.  The sauce was tasty, but for $16 I thought I would have received more of it.   It was only a very small portion.  In all fairness it was an Italian portion.  I just didn't feel it was worth it.  I wanted it to blow my mind...

My husband had the Spinach Salad.  It was just baby spinach leaves, pecorino shavings & some croutons.  Again, for $9.95 I felt it was a very small portion of salad.  

We skipped dessert.  

Overall, nothing was awful about the meal, it just lacked in quality overall.  I figured since the owner is Italian it would have been better.
It was not worth the $80 that's for sure.  I would definitely not go back either.",0fG7akW_GqoA3iWMD8_wNg,5,1,2,hXdz83dNfC17g5ZWBXp9Zg
3764758,2010-12-22,0,zoYIwHGvnglmrZD0RqhRIA,"My husband bought a deal off Living Social for La Focaccia earlier in the year and decided to use it last night. So the two of us and a friend make the short trek. Let me start off by saying the only thing good about the visit was the pizza. And that was the last thing we experienced.

The service was HORRIBLE! Our server was slower than slow plus he simply kept forgetting about us. We got a bottle of the Chef's Special which was some Merlot that was disgusting. I tried a sip and sent it back. Our server said he would get out a few different wines and let me sample them. 25 minutes later, I'm still waiting for my wine. He comes by finally with a bottle of Chianti and I ended up liking it. BUT HE STILL CHARGED ME! I'm sorry but if you make me wait that long, I deserve a free glass of wine. Or a free bottle. Or both. :)

We ordered the Antipasto x2 to start off with. The bruschetta was alright. The eggplant parmigiana was ok but it was very cold. The roasted red peppers were good. The olives were extremely salty as was the buffalo mozzarella. The one thing that irked me the most was that they gave us TWO PIECES OF SALAMI. Really? 2 pieces? UGHHHH. Totally overpriced for what we got.

They have a calzone on the menu that has crushed tomatoes, ham, salami, ricotta and fontina (i think). We made those the toppings on the pizza and it was pretty good. All three of us enjoyed it. 

Oh I forgot something. So after we are done with the antipasto ""platter"", I ask my husband and friend if we were supposed to get bread like all the other tables around us. I ask our server and he says ""I guess so"". WHAT? What kind of answer is that? 

Let me just clarify that the one star is for the pizza. Nothing else deserves a star. NOTHING! 

I'm not going back. EVER. I don't care if they have pizza slices for $2. I'm not going back. I don't care if they released another coupon on Crowd Savings today. I'm not going back!!!!",Ta9LFVuDqpEx3NzFjNpvRw,7,0,1,flPkqXV2yf5KGvUTSnytIg

I've been here twice so far and haven't been impressed.  On my first visit, I had a pizza, which, at under $2 a slice, is a pretty good deal.  Granted, it wasn't the tastiest or most groundbreaking, but it was good.  

My second visit involved a meatball parm sandwich.  Only thing I could think of when I got my food was ""where's the beef?""  The thing had two meatballs.  I can get a heck of a lot more at Subway for the same price!  Five dollar footlong, anyone?

I'll probably give this joint one more shot to see if they really justify only a two star rating.",9aHS1o9JVm04buXN9PgE4Q,2,0,2,wnYQAXY8R6afMFmlKzE75A

Some would say it lacked flavor but I prefer to add salt to dishes rather than being too salty.  The sandwich was roast beef with pepperjack on rye and it was flavorful but I wished there was more meat. I then noticed you can add more meat so they must know they don't put enough or other customers have mentioned it.

On a whim we drove past it and decided it was time to give La Focaccia another try...
The service is just too slow, I know this is a small place but they need a waitress and a cook that can work at a faster pace, I mean we do have other things to do other than wait for out food!!!
O.K. my pasta was really good- I would come back again for my pasta-
I had the Penne Americiana bit replaced Penne for Angel Hair Pasta- the dish had Pancetta, Onion, Tomato Sauce,Chili Flakes and Parmigiano...It was really good- because of the Pancetta I could see how it may be too salty for some but I liked it alot!!!!
My daughter had Spaghetti al Pomodoro-I tried it - Good!!!!
The BF had Ravioli Burro e Salvia- Good but he had to ask for more Tomato Sauce and he was still hungry after the fact...
At one point I had to get up and ask again for the tomato sauce as the BF's food was getting cold just waiting for the extra sauce- I'm telling you the slow pace in here is just ridiculous!!!!
For the appetizer we ordered the Bruschetta which in the menu said $4.95 but I was charged $9.95 come to find out I was mistakingly given the wrong bruschetta appetizer- 
The Bruschetta was different because your bread was dry and you added either tomatoes,olives or garlic. I liked it, I loved the whole garlic cloves!!!
So just like the name of this place= Focaccia= I was wondering where our focaccia was (each table is supposed to be given focaccia on the house) but if I didn't ask I wouldn't have gotten any so just ask people... (The waitress said she didn't bring us any because she was waiting for the focaccia to be warm then she would've brought it out) I didn't believe her, I mean we were already almost done with our meal. The Focaccia itself was chewy goodness!!!
The Italian BF wasn't impressed, the Kid and I liked our food so sorry BF majority rules and I think we will be back but I'd have to make sure that  I have nothing else planned for the rest of the day- yes, it may take that long....

5691056,2010-01-09,0,zoYIwHGvnglmrZD0RqhRIA,"Went here for lunch.  Walked in and was greeted with ""Deli or Restaurant?""
I asked what the difference was, and didn't receive an immediate reply, so I sat at the first available table, which as it turned out was the deli.
I ordered one of the specials from the board outside, 1/2 order of Lasagna and a salad.
The waiter/cook/cashier said if I wanted something to drink get it out of the cooler.  There was no diet coke, so I didn't get a beverage.  No water was served at the table.
The salad came, mixed greens with oil and a moderately harsh vinegar.  Acceptable, not great.
The Lasagna came, cold.   I sent it back. While waiting I got my own fork and napkin, because apparently if one of the tables you sit at is ""deli"" you have to get your own stuff.
The lasagna came back hot in a few min.  There was no bread, although the menu board said there was supposed to be bread.
Attempts to get the waiter's attention failed, so I decided to just eat it while it was still hot.
When I went to pay the bill I mentioned.
1. No Diet Soda (the guy said we have fountain drinks, and had diet soda there.  I said how was I supposed to know that. You said the drinks were in the cooler)
2. The lasagna was cold.
3. No garnish, no bread.  He said ""What do you expect, its the special.""

He again said ""you should have asked. "" I said you never came around and asked how the food was.  He said he did, but he didn't or I would have brought up those things.

He then lambasted me again for not asking and said, and I quote ""What do you want us to do bring you a list of everything we have?
""
and I said YES its called a menu.  I shouldn't have to ask and I shouldn't have to be a mind reader to know what you have and what you don't.

He then said, well you can leave.  I left with a salty comment flung his way.

So all in all. The lasagna was ok, once heated, but I question the healthiness of items served at room temperature.
It is very confusing as to the ""deli"" part and the ""restaurant"" part.  The specials apply to the deli part, at least I think they do.

If you sit at the wrong table,  you get your own PLASTIC fork and small napkin, cheap Parmesan cheese, no salt, no pepper and bad service.

I don't know what you get if you sit in the restaurant tables.  I presume you can't order the specials on the special board.

Its very confusing, the waiter,cook,cashier  fellow was very unfriendly and was offended that I suggested they have a menu with the items they have for sale on it.  They have a board, with SOME of the items they have available.

This place is clearly not ready for prime time. Worker with a hair trigger, unfriendly, confusing, cold food; you can do better",VJp8VJbN07sYWczWH5j9Qg,0,0,1,IEBbW3XD1KO51ERsYLRPFQ
