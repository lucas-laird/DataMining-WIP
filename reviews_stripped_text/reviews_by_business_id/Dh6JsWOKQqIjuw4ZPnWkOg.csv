Chicken quality didn't seem good. Seemed like they were dry or old or recently frozen. The meat was tough and too chewy. Sauce was typical quality from any wing place.

The macaroni was small in piece size. The portion was fine but the individual macaroni size was tiny. I never had mac that small. Cheese sauce was decent. Saw some black spots in my mac and cheese. I'm guessing it was burn marks or something.",gwBCsl0OA3KOUXdyzy0xlQ,2,1,1,4gZgojRgl_JOeDmc9Zcy7A

If you have any doubts about a flavor, he'll let you try the sauce beforehand. My personal favorite so far is the curry seasoned one.

Their desserts are nothing short of delicious. I'm a big fan of the red velvet cake and peach cobbler myself. 

The atmosphere is more of a cafeteria, but the service and food match a sit 'n' dine. He plays some nice rock music at a balanced volume and it surprisingly makes you feel very comfortable while eating.

Starts out with a pit in my stomach craving for some delicious wings. We find this place on yelp and so my friend and I tried it. Here are the main points on why it was an awesome experience.

1. The wing size as compared to Wing Stop and Buffalo Wild Wings is a lot larger.

2. The price. A way better deal than any other wing place in town. 

3. The service. The owner, Brian, is a down to earth and chill kinda guy. He really cares about his customers and their experience.

The hot was a perfect hot not tearing your mouth off but a good kick, teriyaki was very good, sweet chili slam is the one that rrally caught me off gaurd and had to get milk, jamacian jerk bbq was smoky full of spicies and flavor lots of kick and the spicy mango was a great blend of sweet and spicy. Then we got a large fries they had a spicy cajun seasoning on it which i didnt realize until my 7 yr old grabbed one and yelled hot :-) ! But other then that they were very good and were fresh cut. I ordered the fried pickles and the guy there bryan waited until we got there to drop them so they would b nice and crisp still when we got home needless to say they didnt make it home lol they were awesome thin and crispy! They have an awesome zesty ranch dip and blue cheese dip as well!

This is it folks. Go get your WINGS HERE!

They have more than a dozen flavors with HELL being the hottest.

I went with my normal Buffalo wing choice and I was not disappointed in the least. They are exactly as I wanted, crispy, spicy and fresh.

I must say however that the space to eat them in is NOTHING to crow about, it is a weird convoluted space with several fast food joints all crowded into a big room with fast food table and chairs with florescent lighting. NOTHING to CROW about and NOT a DATE PLACE...However you can can call ahead and the owner, who is from Louisiana, will take your order and have it waiting for you to pick up. 

This is the BEST CHOICE for Game day and he said he has orders for HUNDREDS of wings going out to people now...so CALL AHEAD!

Amazingly, the owner called us the next day to see how our wings were and to be sure he got the order right!!!! OMG he cares too! Lovely man.  I wish him the very best in his WING KING endeavors and hope he brings another WING KING to DOWNTOWN VEGAS soon..although the drive is fast from downtown- just straight up Charleston...

Now don't forget to leave room for the VERY BEST PEACH COBBLER ever.
Did I mention that the owner is from Louisiana? This is his mothers recipe and she not only raised a fantastic business person but developed the BEST PEACH cobbler.

1433778,2012-10-12,1,Dh6JsWOKQqIjuw4ZPnWkOg,"Move over WingStop, Buffalo Wild Wings, and all other competitors! These are the best wings I have ever had. Hands down.
Having first heard of this place from a friend of mine, I knew I had to try it. 40 flavors of wings? Are you kidding me? That's insane! I've never had SO MANY to choose from. And being an extremely picky eater this was good news to me.

Walking into the internet cafe that this gem of a place is hidden away in, I was surprised. Having expected Wing King to have it's own building. But that is beside the point, don't let the fact that it's in a food court fool you. This place is phenomenal!

The owner, Brian, is one of the nicest guys I have ever met. He let us take our time with the menu, and even offered some suggestions. For my first time I went with a six-piece of ""Hot Chili Lime"" flavored wings, and an order of fried pickles. Oh, did I mention the fried pickles? They're perfect! (This place really had me at the fried pickles) ANYWAYS, the food was a very good price. Just about $4.50 for a six-piece order of wings (plus ranch and celery) and $1.49 for a basket of pickles. Being a college student who loves wings and is on a budget, I was estatic to see those prices. 

Now, those wings. Hot Chili Lime is something I knew I would love, I was very right. Tangy and spicy, and just delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about them!

Since my first time, I've been back several. And have had a different flavor of wings (almost) every time. Along with their french fries, jalapeno bombers, red velvet cake, peach cobbler, and cookies! With so much to choose from, you really can have it your way (sorry, burger king!) when you come to Wing King.

I'm a pretty regular customer here, and don't plan on ending that anytime soon.

So to sum it all up, this place is great! If you want great food, with great service, definitely stop by Wing King. (Did I mention it's great?)",5CdrbmxlmDJ9XC4lLlJRzw,4,2,5,U5eb5ULh9MNfvNNpudFDfA

1729387,2014-01-26,1,Dh6JsWOKQqIjuw4ZPnWkOg,"Spicy garlic parmesan wings are where it's at, bros and hos.
I stopped by here after missing my work's Happy Hour on Friday afternoon, thinking I'd take HH home to the BF. I've been to a few other places in this food court and remembered this place- site indicates that they have 40 flavors of sauce, so I thought they'd be a good option.

In short, guys, I was blown away. Menu offers 6 wings for $5, so naturally I went hog wild and got three orders- for research purposes, you understand. Gotta make sure this review is thorough.

The spicy garlic parm were amazing. I love garlic, I love parm, and I love spice- but usually garlic parm wings are dry, bland, and/or underwhelming, but never spicy. Here, they actually ARE! And the excess cheese crumbles in the dish are delicious too. This was the favorite flavor by far.

Next up was spicy mesquite barbeque- I'm a Texas girl, and Mesquite BBQ is a Texas thing. This flavor took me back home, in a good way. Warm heat, got the spices right. 

Jamaican Jerk Barbeque was recommended to me by the cashier as her favorite- and they were excellent. Extra saucy, warm heat and a lot of flavor. Not as good as the garlic parm, but still good- and an option you won't find too many places.

I'll def be going back to try more flavors, and perhaps buy stock in the spicy garlic parm. Menu also boasts ""pig wings"" which are actually mini hams? Doesn't sound appealing to me at all, but they're the only place in the state that offers them so that means I'll get around to trying them sooner or later.

Side note on the service; as a note says by the front counter, this is not a fast food place. Your order is made WHEN you order, so expect a wait. Mine took a reasonable 15 minutes, and I was pleased with the product. I prefer fresh food even if a wait is required though I understand some might be on a time crunch and assume the food-court location is going to be quick. Definitely recommend calling ahead to order, which they encourage!

1939593,2012-12-08,4,Dh6JsWOKQqIjuw4ZPnWkOg,"Ok so you if you dont know i'm biased toward Wing King because i believe excellence should be rewarded and not ignored. The NEW Campus Commons is possibly THE best kept secret in the general area due to it's impressive gathering of several individual eateries with their own unique flavors as well as a community vibe. 

Yes i know Brian the owner. The other guy behind the counter is Brandon his brother that holds down the shop when Brian is out doing other stuff. I've eaten here a few times and i've passed them up a few times and i'd like to share why i keep on coming back.

The Flavors
Now if you think there's 40 flavors as advertised you're wrong. The count i'd estimate now would be around 60 flavors with a lot more in the works. A unique thing about Brian is the gears inside his head are always turning and cranking out new flavors. The latest set of flavors (new during this re-review) all contain contain the word 'Slam' in them because he 'Slammed' them together that afternoon.
So far my all time favorite flavor are any of the Jamacian Jerk flavors. Standard is quite balanced with a layer upon layer of different flavors starting from some sweetness then some tangy savory, then herbal, then aromatics, and finally a steady rising heat from spicy.  The Apple Jerk is a bit sweeter but the latest being the Jamacian Slam is my new favorite with it's cinnamon notes

The Option to Taste and Pick What You Want
Lets say you're torn between a few flavors or want to give a taste of what new. Ask Brian or Brandon to try out the sauce. Time after time they've shown remarkable patience and a willingness to grab the sauce bottles and give you a taste as well as explain to you the origins of the sauce and it's various other similar flavors or new flavors that have emerged from that once sauce.

Tweek the Flavor
Lets say you choose a flavor but it's a bit spicier then you expected. This happens to me on a few occasions. I dont handle spicy all too well so i asked to cut the spicy by a third. They did it and it came out perfect. It's too spicy for you or not spicy enough? Ask them to crank it up or tweek it down. All sauces are made in house so they'd be more then willing to accommode you. 

The Fries
To be honest i love the regular fries. It's a mixture of the Seasoned dry rub flavor and a bit of the Cajun dry rub flavor but to me it's perfect for fries. Their fries dont come out of a plastic bag that's been frozen for a while. You are eating real washed skin on potatos and you can tell they are too, no two fries are the same and they all taste good. A new option is available to season your fries in different flavors as well. Garlic Parm is a huge hit among the masses as well as Sweet Chili. Be warned as these are better dine in then to go as the fries get soggy if you dont eat them fast enough.

There's Always Room for Dessert
Desserts are also all home made and made in house. The usual lineup of desserts include a Red Velvet cake, their Too Much Chocolate cake, chocolate cookies, and everyone's favorite: the Peach Cobbler. If you're lucky there will be something different. I struck gold on two occasions when there was a soaked Rum cake available one day and a few weeks later a German Chocolate cake with the coconut cream center.

Bottom line. If you're hungry and in the mood for a whole lot of flavors that wont leave you broke till next week. Wing King is the place to check out. If you're on a diet and dont think you should be eating wings or desserts, come anyway. Pretty sure Brian can season a basket of celery sticks for ya.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,17,10,5,ZgXtCem-g_6YziCA_Su4xw

The advertisement looked promising, and the menu even included two of my favorite comfort foods: mac and cheese and fried pickles. My husband was excited to try the garlic parmesan wings, and split his order with ranch-flavored wings to try something different. The wings looked frozen (unthawed) as they hit the deep fryer. The flavors were not easy to distinguish and my husband was unimpressed. The ranch dressing for dipping was straight from a bottle and also lacked quality. As for the food I tried, the macaroni was overcooked and disintegrating into the cheese mixture, into which the cook may have accidentally dropped the pepper shaker.  This dish could better be described as shredded pasta in creamy black pepper sauce. The fried pickle chips had a nice flavor and the serving was generous, but the large pool of oil inside the basket was unappetizing. Drain that grease. I also tried a few of my husband's french fries, which were handcut, but appeared to have been fried only once (twice is nice), as the crisp exterior revealed a dry interior.

2442275,2013-01-31,6,Dh6JsWOKQqIjuw4ZPnWkOg,"Roger T--I tried this place because of your glowing review.  I must have gone on a bad day because my experience was nothing close to yours. 

Let's start with the positive news. The Sweet Chili Jerk sauce I chose for my boneless wings was amazing (better than anything I have tried at Buffalo Wild Wings).  They were sweet yet had a nice kick of spice to them.  If I were to rank this place on the wings alone, it would be 5 stars. 

However, we did try some mediocre side dishes that really let me down.  First, the fries were overcooked and over seasoned.  The second offender was the macaroni & cheese, which was basically Kraft mac n cheese with some garlic salt and a ton of black pepper added to it.  The potato salad was a disaster, and really lacked any real flavor. Add in a stale Hawaiian roll, and our lunch was complete. 

Let's talk about the service for a minute (or lack thereof).  I placed my order at 12:09 pm, and did not receive my lunch until 12:50 pm.  What's funny is that the place wasn't busy. There were 2 ladies in front of us-thats it! The entire food court was empty, so it was easy to count them.  In fact there were more gnats in the building than there were customers.  Since the doors were open, these creatures decided to have lunch with us.  The gentleman with the pony tail behind the counter was not friendly in the slightest.  All he could do was begrudgingly take my order and complain that he was short staffed for the day. However, to his credit- he did give us a few extra cookies to go - since we had to wait so long. 

I am glad I tried this place. I would have never know that this hidden food court existed. If I do decide to come back for the wings (only), I will make sure to call my order in ahead of time. I would also recommend wearing a citronella bracelet if you decide to eat there.

Just like you I was reading the reviews, (mainly Tawni and Tien's), I was compelled to check this place out.

So as I park and get out of my car, I see a big sign that says this place is an internet cafe. Huh? Am I at the wrong place? Then I remembered from the reviews that the whole place is a food court. 

I walk up to the Wing King counter and Brian, the owner, was still getting ready. He sees me and politely asks if he can help me. I said excitedly ""WINGS, IM HERE FOR THE WINGS!"" So he takes my order and I sit down with my mouth watering to wait for my first bite. 

So while im waiting, I tell Brian Yelp is what brought me here. Never mind the fact that I dont mind going to new places to try out wings, if it wasnt for Yelp, you would not be reading this review.

Ok so for the wings. There are 40 flavors. Yes. 40. I had garlic parmesan and garlic hot. Ok, so I love garlic. Dont judge me! Especially if you are a vampire! The wings were a little bit bigger than your average size. Brian asked if I liked it extra crispy. Hell yes I do! So after I devoured my wings, things like hole in the wall and a 5 star review was already embedded in my head. From my last conversation with Brian, he is already coming up with even more sauces like mango slam and honey mustard slam. This guy works his butt off to keep you coming back and I for one am one of them!

I also ordered garlic parmesan fries and fried pickles. YES, I SAID FRIED PICKLES! Both were off the hook and Brian also let me sample some sweet chili glazed fries. OMG it was some of the best fries I have had in a long time. Please refer to the amazing pics on here and your mouth will be watering. I guarantee it!

As I was finishing up, Brian just happen to serve me a peach cobbler fresh out of the oven as a token of appreciation. DAMN! If I knew he was gonna do that, I wouldnt of ate so many wings! I could only finish half of it. 

Speaking of the peach cobbler, man this guy has some great desserts as well. I have tried the red velvet cake and the cookies. A special mention goes out to his rum cake as well. This is not a usual and its not on the menu but he made it for a customer one time so he decided to make two. One for the customer and one for whoever was lucky enough that day to be there when he put it out. Yes, I was there and boy oh boy it was awesome! If I ate any more I would need a cab to get home! Im sure he can specially make it for you if you let him know ahead of time so he can do his magic. That is the advantage of baking your own desserts! You can taste the freshness for sure! Oh, before I forget, Brian tells me he is in the process of bringing in Bluebelle Ice Cream. For those that dont know, that's only something that you only see on the east coast. So that alone should warrant a trip here.

If you are wondering, yes there is a really, really spicy hot wing challenge. The flavor is called Hell. No explanation necessary here. All I know is that I need to bring my friends that think they can pass this challenge here soon. Im also hoping we can make a Yelp event out of this. (Hi Misti! LOL)

So now after reading this you should be compelled to check this place out just like me. For complete info on their 40 flavors and other items, go to their website: www.wingkinglv.com",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,25,18,5,evj9wSKhYQwqZIaPwHGKvw

Owner was cordial, helpful and let me try the sauce before ordering.

The sweet mustard wings were great, cooked right and that sauce is excellent. I normally dont care about fries, but these fries were a great compliment to the wings.

Honored my check-in offer for a free desert. The owner gave me a generous portion of the German chocolate. Nice, moist and warm..downed it in 5 mins.

3455192,2012-12-06,4,Dh6JsWOKQqIjuw4ZPnWkOg,"Wings aren't really my thing. Too much work to eat, but if they come prepared boneless then I'm there. With that being said, I can't say that Wing King is the ""King of Wings,"" but what I can tell you is that their other food items are pretty dang BOMB. Yeah, I just dropped the B-word.

I wouldn't have known about this place if it wasn't for the CMYE: Kaba Curry Tasting that my girlfriends and I attended. While waiting for our curry samples to arrive, we observed other Yelpers lining up at Wing King. One Yelper (bless your heart, whoever you are!) came by with samples of garlic parmesan fries and some type of chili fries; both were fresh and hot from the fryers. The samples were what tempted us to try the other items listed on their menu, such as the Jalapeño Bombers, Red Velvet Cake, Peach Cobbler, and Fried Pickles. 

Peach Cobbler ($2.00 a bowl): My friend had been eyeing the cobbler for sometime, so she bought a cup for all of us to share. Peach Cobbler isn't a dessert I can say I love to indulge in, but this was indeed scrumtrulescent! The cobbler tastes homemade. It's as though there's a granny in the back kitchen whose sole duty is to make peach cobblers.The crust is the best part of the cobbler. It's sweet and it crumbles and melts in your mouth. *Homer Simpson drool*

Red Velvet Cake ($2.50 a slice): I want that cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake! It's not even my birthday, but I thought this was a fantastic start to my birthday week: sharing a slice of red velvet cake with my girls. Rumor has it that the secret ingredient to this cake is North Korean unicorn tears. I swear on a book of carpet samples that the cake was amazing and it will change your life. Ok, I'm exaggerating just a little, but it's one of the best Red Velvets I've ever eaten. When I heard that the Red Velvet was about to come right out of the oven, I headed over immediately to the counter and received the first piece. As I watched the cake being sliced, I could see the steam rising. Moist and sweet, I thought it was at its peak of deliciousness when the icing began to solidify. There's also bits of chocolate in the cake giving it a sweet crunchiness with each bite.

Fried Pickles ($1.49 for a small) and Jalapeño Bombers ($1.00 for two): We couldn't just have dessert. Sweet needed to be offset by something savory. My friends and I shared a small order of the Fried Pickles and two orders of the Jalapeño Bombers. The Jalapeño Bombers weren't spicy, but they were cheesy. The Fried Pickles were alright, but I thought they were too salty.

Service: The guys running Wing King are friendly and just seem cool. They even came around to pick up empty containers and plates for us after we were done eating.

Overall: So far Wing King's made a good first impression on me. I'll have to come by again to try some wings. Their ""suicide"" flavor wings sound like a challenge that I'm thinking about accepting.

Drop by Wing King if you're hungry and are in the area. It's located inside the Internet Cafe across the Charleston CSN campus.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,5,6,4,MCG4m2UadWCwsjMiZf-c2Q

I was meeting Tien at the internet cafe for lunch, which is where this place is. There are about 7 different food places to choose from. It's a food court, without the mall. Pretty cool concept, and it's right down from the college campus.

I'm there, on time , and while waiting*cough cough*, looked around at the menus of the places inside.I was getting hungry waiting for Mr. Lateness, oops, Tien, (I mean, who showed up 27 minutes late) so, I ordered the small fried pickles and a slice of cake.

I thought it was weird that it took a bit to get my order. I guess he was alone, but I waited for over 10 minutes to get my stuff. I did enjoy the pickles. I was surprised that it was such a large portion, as I ordered the small. It came with a kicked up dip (chipolte mayo maybe?). I enjoyed it quite a bit.

As for dessert? I was definitely full after lunch (we ate at the healthy place). BUT, the butter cake was delicious. The best part was the gooey stuff on the bottom. It was so yummy! Had there been more of that on the cake itself, it would have been crazy delicious. 

I will be back at the internet cafe, I've got to try some of the other places, and I will return here for some dessert again!

I love dry wings, so Debbie ordered the lemon pepper and the Jamaican slam sauce.  Next time, we will ask Brian to just to fry the wings, and have the Jamaican slam sauce on the side and we can dip the wings into the sauce.  Also, I like the fact that Brian will let you sample the sauces, and he can also make it more hot, less hot for your preference.  You can tell that Brian caters to his customers.

Also, when you check in on yelp, you get a small dessert with your purchase.  This is an offer NO ONE should ever pass up.  Why?  Because Brian makes the most delicious desserts!  OMG, the peach cobbler is to die for.  They have the right amount of crisp, peaches, and pastry dough.  Then the red velvet and too much chocolate cake slices...ahhhh, so moist and fluffy.

Based on the other reviews I knew what to expect as far as decor and that it was more of a food court type setting.  I ordered the Lemon Pepper Dry because lemon pepper is my go to wing flavor to which I compare all my wing experiences.  I also compare all wings to my fave spot from my hometown and to me they are hard to beat, which also probably makes me a little biased.   These weren't bad but they didn't wow me like I was expecting from the reviews.   Brian was very nice.  The desserts looked really good.

I'm swearing off meat and dairy come Jan. 1 (if I put it in a Yelp review, it has to be true, right?) so I'm going on a heyday in preparation. I had the honey mustard slam wings with some kind of sweet chili fries. I made sure to get the wings boneless (a.k.a. chicken nuggets slathered in sauce) so that I could snarf them on the way home. Don't worry, I created a bib and everything in case the delicious sauces should drip on my clothes. (In case you were wondering, I didn't need the bib because I'm just that good at eating.)

I literally inhaled the wings, though I can't imagine I'll be back anytime soon (both distance and the no meat/dairy prevent me from coming back) so I'm going to just recommend that you all go in my place. Go! Try the sauces! Eat them all! Oh and don't forget about dessert--fresh baked pie and cobbler and cake and a myriad other things. Love you, Wing King.

I purposely chose odd sauces, they have 60: Sweet Chili Hot, and Jamaican Slam. Both were great. A nice touch is that, since I ate there, the food was served on plates, which reflects the very hippie vibe (Bob Marley posters, dreadlocked staff).

However, the environment is AWFUL. Wing King is really just a counter sharing space and tables with 5-6 other low-budget exotic food vendors in a building no bigger than a large McDonalds. Best bet is to eat elsewhere.

3901454,2013-04-03,5,Dh6JsWOKQqIjuw4ZPnWkOg,"My husband wanted some wings last night so he searched Yelp and found Wing King. The menu looked legit, so we headed out. When we got to 'The Food Court' I was totally skeeved out. It's a random windowless building with a sign on the front. Doesn't look like anywhere I really wanted to be - but my husband was persistent so I caved. We were the only people there, and only 3 of the businesses were open. It was like being in a food court in the local mall - minus the mall. So weird. 

We stood in front of Wing King for a good ten minutes before anyone even came out from the back, then they went back to where they came from without even acknowledging us. 20 minutes into our visit a kid came out and took our order, rang us up and we waited... for what seemed like an eternity. The long wait was apparently a blessing, as we reviewed our receipt. For 24 wings they kid charged us $222.98. Yes. Two hundred twenty two dollars and ninety eight cents. I promptly rang the bell and a corn-rowed gentleman (apprently the owner) came out and rectified our transaction, all the while trashing the employee to us. 

The wings looked great, and the dry garlic parmesean weren't all that bad, they were just absolutely COVERED in grated cheese, which isn't our thing. Instead of one of our orders, they gave us mild, and the caribbean jerk was super sweet and then burning hot - so we didn't eat them. 

Later that night we both weren't feeling so hot, and were consistently burping garlic parmesean....so we definitely won't be making a return trip to Wing King. :/",uYlzvshOSWCTwNLFBELTug,1,0,1,KLfOfXg4WeaFHa6ppWJuLA

The money I would spend if this place was known back in the day.. jk?

If you don't feel like chicken wings on that day, you can choose from Mexican, Korean BBQ, and Soul Food. And if you're not into any of that, you shouldn't be Yelping in the first place! #TrueStoryBro 
For just two of us, it had to be the 24 piece wing combo including Cajun Fries (great tasty kick), and a couple canned drinks. The portion was perfect for a guy as small as me, and we did a great job picking the wing flavors. You must try the Mango Slam! Its sweet, delicious, and most likely as hot as i would go on my wings. Garlic Hot seemed like regular 'ol buffalo. Jamaican Jerk was perfect to a person like me who prefers spiciness for the flavor, and not burning myself later on the toilet. :/ Any-who, I shouldn't have to worry about that much since they have over 60 combinations of flavors to choose from!

The infamous/delicious/scrumptious Peach Cobbler was ordered to come out fresh after we finished our meal but we were already so full of the 'sin-food' so we took our time in unbuttoning our muffin top holder.

The parm came with a lot of grated parmesan, but the flavor for me was just OK. I ended up dipping them in the mango slam since that was more my type of flavor and the BF picked the garlic parm. The wings were a good sized and crispy though. 

Fried pickles were nice thin pickles so they fried up like chips. These I really liked. It came with some ranch type dip, but this probably would be awesome with some mustard based sauce. We got a regular, but the basket was rather generous of a portion. 

The fries came seasoned and are skin on. These reminds me of fries at places like 5 Guys and are rather solid if you like those thick cut natural skin on type fries.

The check in offer is with purchase is a free a dessert. We got a slice of rum cake. It was good, but maybe a bit too boozy since it was straight soaked in rum, If you want a buzzed dessert though this is for you. 

So the ambiance looks not like much but the wings and the fried pickles hit the spot so I would be back during lunch when I just want a quick bite. It would probably be a good to-go place  or a spot to get a big ole tray for a get together.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,1,4,dup7erhf3t7Xjj7LYPxzgQ

They are much more tender than rib tips and a whole lot more meatier.  They are fried up in no time and can be prepared with any of the flavors, although any of the BBQ flavors would probably be your best bet.",4tBboKZrkVWp4IZES_wqug,1,2,5,MjL5bxy_p93tXt1OQBAUQg
5127028,2013-02-13,1,Dh6JsWOKQqIjuw4ZPnWkOg,"I have been hearing rumblings about Wing King for a little while now. I never even had the desire to give it a shot because of it's location in the Food Court building by CSN. I gotta say you can't really judge a book by it's cover. Let me set the scene up for you.. I place my order over the phone and walk in 20 minutes later to the background music of Gansta's Paradise. Automatically that's a bonus point, and from here on out I'd prefer to enter most places with Coolio singing my real life soundtrack. Any place not playing Gangsta's Paradise automatically loses a star. Ok, sorry for getting sidetracked. 

Upon entering, the place was a little smokey, but not because of the Bob Marley posters all around if you know what I'm saying. It had the smokiness of poorly ventilated fryers. It wasn't overwhelming. I've worked kitchens before, this was pretty mild and you get used to it immediately. The gentleman that helped me, Brian, was a nice polite guy. I told him I've been hearing good things about the place and wanted to check it out. There was a check in offer for a small dessert, so that was awesome. I opted for the chocolate bundt cake, because he said it was the freshest. He also went out of the way to pop everything open and verify the order was correct. And then he wrote on the cake container to microwave for 20-30 seconds. He said it makes it nice and gooey like a brownie. I cant begin to say how much the tiny attention to detail was appreciated. I love when a food service establishment goes out of their way with customer service, mainly because a lot of places tend to get that part dead wrong. 

I tried a bunch of different stuff. The french fries stole the show. I'll get that out of the way up front. They had an awesome seasoning on them. I got boneless and traditional wings in the flavors of Parmesan Garlic, Spicy Parmesan Garlic, Mango BBQ, and Mild. I'm a huge fan of Parmesan Garlic at most places. This place wasn't particularly the best though. It was just ok. I enjoyed it, but I've had better. The spicy version tasted off. It was my least favorite of the four. Mango BBQ was solid. Sweet with just a small kick of hot. And Mild was... well Mild. It was a safe bet and it didn't disappoint. The Mac and Cheese was a let down. Not expensive, but not on some BFG level or anything. I'd skip that altogether next time in favor of a bigger size of fries. Did I mention the fries were bomb? Because they were. Mmm, I can taste those seasonings now. Also, the cake was pretty good. Nice and fresh and satisfying. 

If you are in the area and craving wings, definitely try this place out. I'm going to go back to experience some more flavors and of course, the fries. The pricing on everything is very reasonable and you should be able to find something you'll really like... Especially if you order their french fries.",eBWDX4a5iURWg-MA97hFpg,2,2,4,D3bWLm04OWhOnJk5T_Ln4A
5136727,2013-04-10,3,Dh6JsWOKQqIjuw4ZPnWkOg,"Veeeerrryyyy sloooooooowwww service. Ordered a 5 Wing special and i think I saw them rubbing 2 sticks together to start the fire underneath the fryer.  Then they touched the food with their bare hands (yes I'm serious). I told them to eat it themselves, even though I prepaid....$7.00 down the drain. NEVER AGAIN.",d44mCiCiv41bCYLSkHBqlw,1,1,1,byMvZDo9FXoae1F2N3kavg
5139470,2013-01-12,0,Dh6JsWOKQqIjuw4ZPnWkOg,"First of all, this is a cafeteria style eating setup.  There are multiple food ""stands"" here, and you eat in a small area that is shared with others.  Not a big deal to me, but don't expect BWW or other establishment.  It is a cool idea though, more for college kids I think, since it is right near CSN.  

Ordered the fried pickles, jalapeno bombers, and traditional wings of course.

Pickles were good...it is the sauce that makes them actually.  The pickles by themselves didn't do much for me, but the cajun/mayo/ranch whatever it was is pretty solid and goes well with the vinegary/saltiness.  Jalapeno bombers were not very good....pretty bland...would not recommend.

As for the wings, I saw them cook the entire batch at one time.  But somehow, some of them got overcooked and dry, others were absolutely perfect.  There were some with a lot of blood vessels or whatever it is called, and one of mine had a broken bone with marrow all around the insides and chunks of bone pieces...yuck.  These must be frozen and transported via UPS freight (jk...kind of)....

Tried the parm garlic, mango habenero (I think), and carribean jerk bbq.  The garlic parm was ok...the habenero was like a basic hot to me...both were good, but not great.  What WAS great was their carribean jerk.  It was an excellent, spicy mixture of bbq and jerk'ness and really really wish all the others had that much thought and love put into them.

Since all the other reviews seemed great, I must have had a bad experience or bad choices in sauce at least.  If the wings were cooked right, it would have made this a 4 star, and more than one solid choice in flavor, would have bumped another outta me.  I guess I will stick with the chain restaurants for solid and consistent wings.",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,0,0,3,PIgB3NVHexFDv16ORgC0xg
5140356,2013-02-17,0,Dh6JsWOKQqIjuw4ZPnWkOg,"Okay, saw the many great reviews about this place and it kind of made me not want to write this one but on second thought, I think it only fair to everyone that we tell it like it is.  The sauce which makes the wings were okay, nothing to jump up and down about, had the Teriyaki, and Med. Hot, and also tried the Dry Cool Ranch.  The wings were over fried and dry, nice crunch but just too dry and small wings at that, Wingstop had much bigger wings.  Mac and Cheese was tasteless and the Parm & Garlic fries was also pretty tasteless.  It may have been that the oil was too hot but they should know better since they are the Wing King.  Waited half an hour for 24 wings with the sides.  

Went on a Sat. night at around 7p.m., 3 out of the 5 food stalls in there were either closed or out of business, only Wing King and the Soul Food stall were open.  Maybe these businesses are geared for the CSN crowd??  Just wondering why so many 5 Star reviews?? Did I miss something??",G5HJ8ojD6Dx515m-eJYaXQ,4,1,3,N0cmhYmGFzMz4ThZtL4Dog

The gentlemen behind the counter were very welcoming and attentive, and were nice enough to treat us to some of their chill and parmesan fries (amazing, btw), which was enough to get me curious about their wings.

Once I decided to get a few wings to try I approached the counter and asked the million dollar question: ""what is your best seller?"" I thought I would get a standard pitch for some random flavor, but the owner (I didn't catch his name) let me sample different sauces and even tweaked one of the sauce recipes just for me! I will undoubtedly come back to get some of the dry-rubbed wings which, if they are as amazing as the jamaican jerk ones, should be pretty amazing.

Thanks guys for your great service and awesome wings. You just became my favorite wing spot in town!",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,1,1,5,3414Mu9TT9FfZOnhg9l8Ng

Always in search of good wings, and to find great French fries in the same search is phenomenal. The owners are from Louisiana so they know good food and are friendly as well. 
We got to sample some of their Slam sauces, Sweet Chili fries, garlic Parmesan fries, fried pickle chips and peach cobbler. We ended up ordering some Jerk Slam wings. Nice size wings, cooked perfectly and the price is great. They don't skimp on the sauce either. 
I can't wait to go back and try more of their many flavor wings and fries.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,8,4,5,Cuu5K9TTPKuO5A0tYlnQqA
5529408,2013-04-18,6,Dh6JsWOKQqIjuw4ZPnWkOg,"How good is it when the best thing on the menu is the peach cobbler??  That's definitely worth trying above anything else.  It might be even worth buying a whole tin of it.  I would!!

I wasn't impressed with the rest of it.  We got 12 wings.  Half of it was extra hot and the other was garlic parmesan which was recommended by the person working.  It had a ton of grated (sawdust) parmesan on top which was pretty lame.  The wings were just wings.  Nothing special to me.  The baked beans side was really good and the potato salad was decent but that doesn't equal a complete dinner.  The red velvet cake wasn't as good as before either.  It was definitely dry and there were no chocolate chips in it like last time.  

Considering the atmosphere of the dining area (this would be an ideal place for illegal transactions to go down) or other things lacking like clean tables AND the fact that Wing King doesn't have one of the best things to drink with wings (BEER), I am a takeout customer at best.

For me the main reason to hit up Wing King, is their desserts.  Red Velet Cake is good, but sinfully good when it is barely legal out of the oven.  If I can still eat like a teenager, I would totally eat 1/2 a cake and a pint of ice cream.
