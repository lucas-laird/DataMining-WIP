6155,2017-09-28,0,8KEB1lcjKlIVSd6uA8JB9w,This location has the worst service. Every. Single. Time. They are impressively slow. They never have whip cream for the desserts. The machine is always broken or they're out. We've complained to corporate so many times about this and *surprise surprise* nothing ever changes. The food is still decent for the most part but this location in particular makes me want to stop coming to cafe rio.,Na__TWiSv91vVp8N9iA4Ag,0,0,1,JVRQGOerGzc3f5Bln0P7pQ
48477,2017-04-06,0,8KEB1lcjKlIVSd6uA8JB9w,"I've gone to this Cafe Rio around 40-50 times since August when I moved to this side of town. This trip was by far the worst I've had. I walked in at 9:52 as they closed at 10:00. Understandable that the employees were anxious to leave, but I just wanted my free salad I earned with rewards! I walked in and there were upwards of 25 people sitting around eating and carrying on. Fairly unusual. As I approached the counter, not only could I see the employees unhappiness, but I could hear them complaining about the amount of people in the store. (I'm sure the owner wouldn't complain) 

Anyhow, a male employee asked me verbatim ""what can I do for you?"" I'm not going to go into how misjudged this approach is to customer service, so I'll leave it alone. However, when I responded with ""yeah can I get a salad to go please"" his first response was ""well this is all the rice we have left so (he paused for a second as I stared at him) I'll just give you the rest"" There was about 2 spoonfuls of rice left. As he goes to scoop he looked up to see more people walk in to order and quickly changed that 2 spoonfuls to a half scoop. Sweet dude. Then, he passed it along to a young woman employee who while she was making the salad was speaking in Spanish to another girl employee complaining about the people still in restaurant. (Hehe, I happen to speak Spanish, what are the odds right?) 

In the end, I will say if you go here I guess don't go after 9:30 because apparently you'll get upset employees who of course didn't sign up for the 2-10 shift or you'll get half a scoop of rice from a male employee who clearly isn't in it for repeat business. 

Also, she forgot the lime. And if you have had the salad you know that the lime is a delightful touch that really makes the salad a ""salad.""",MjoqIL3lTigoJA_FM2dMmg,0,0,2,JxaBPc_aizZCi6aCeomdUw

They are robots going through the motions. I ordered a quesadilla with grilled chicken. I saw the guacamole that the menu stated I received with my order. When she asked me if i wanted the sour cream, pico, and guac I replied yes please. The guac she gave me was from another bin behind the counter that was brown and watery. I asked for the guac in the other bin that she had just told my husband was fresh. She replied that she had to give me this one and slapped a scoop of the nastiness on my food. The quesadilla wasn't cut which made it really hard to eat all folded up. Also we had the chips and queso. They give you a ton of chips which is a bonus but the queso was less to be desired. My husband had grilled steak tacos and he said they were very bland. The meal cost us about $30.

1086565,2016-10-21,0,8KEB1lcjKlIVSd6uA8JB9w,"Let me start with the food was good, even though the service was horrible.  The place was busy for dinner and there was a large line waiting.  The ingredient area was a mess with other foods mixed in with other items.  The employees would make the food and have to take out the other ingredients that weren't supposed to be be in the dish.

When it was our turn to order (for a family of four) the employee took two of our orders then started a take out order.  Once she finished that one she asked us for the rest of our order, one of which was an enchilada styled burrito. After she made it handed told another employee to finish it and walked away because she had to ""change her gloves.""  That employee grabbed the burrito dish and turned around to put it into the cooker, but the foil collapsed on her and the burrito fell onto the flat top.  She gathered all of the ingredients and put it back together and put it into the oven.  But now all of the sauce was now gone, so it came out dry.  We moved down the line and the employee who finished the order would ask us what we wanted on the dishes, but then would turn around and work on the to-go order, so we basically had to keep repeating everything to him because he wasn't listening.  After a few times it really became frustrating.  

When it was time to pay, the cashier only had two of our meals and we had to point out that the other half of our dishes were still waiting to be finished, since there were several to-go orders in between all of ours now.   I had my phone out with the Cafe Rio app open to get credit for our order, but the cashier never looked up after getting our credit card and closed out the order and handed the card back without even looking at us.  She started to ring up the to-go order and we had to remind her that we needed our drink cups. She had that ""oops"" look and handed us the cups, but never said a word and kept ringing up the to-go order.

This will be the last time we will be going to this particular location.  It is extremely rude to ignore the person in front of you while working on somebody's order who is not even there.  And why bother asking questions if you don't listen to us anyways.  The other reviews about bad service were accurate!  Needless to say when it slowed down nobody came around and asked us how our visit was going, I don't think they really care.",YrlH8p-BIadJpE5cx2wYrg,1,0,1,0tw8e7XcR0EF4Tm9ErsUmg

She charged me for 2 extra salsa (I get that instead of my dressing) she also charged for the single scoops of sour cream in the two tacos I got.

1375356,2017-10-16,0,8KEB1lcjKlIVSd6uA8JB9w,"I created a Yelp account just to comment on my horrific experience with this location. Cafe Rio is sometimes my go-to after I hit the gym, but not any more. 

I came to have a quick dinner on 10/15/17. It took about 20 minutes just to order. There was only me and someone else in the line but for some reason there was a big delay. When I finally got to the register I realized it was one employee that was delaying everything - her name ended up being Esmeralda. 

I realized there were no napkins so I asked Esmeralda at the register if we can have some and she said ""sure, I'll get you some right now"". I sat down and watched her as she didn't go for more napkins, but instead went to mess with other employees and right after blatantly got on her phone and was there fiddling with her phone for at least 5 minutes. After about 10 minutes I decided to get up and I asked another employee and we got the napkins right away. 

As I'm wrapping up my dinner I heard a commotion coming from the cash register and it was another employee spilling a platter of I don't know what in between her legs, making it look like she was peeing. Both girls (Esmeralda being the main one) were laughing so obnoxiously loud that it made sitting there another second unbearable. 

Finally I am throwing away my trash to get out of this nightmare of a dining experience and as I'm walking out Esmeralda and one of her gentlemen co-workers set their food down at a table and race past me through the doors. As I drove away It looked as though both of them were taking part in illegal activity (smoking). 

There was a bigger gentlemen that worked there with a wrist tattoo that was awesome and even though he was stuck working with children that have a blatant disregard for professionalism and customer service, he handled himself well and tended to each customer that walked in. Poor guy was doing a bit of a juggling act trying to make up for his coworkers that were playing around. 

All in all it was horrendous. Me and my many friends eat at Cafe Rio frequently but this experience left a nasty taste in my mouth and needless to say none of us will be eating at Cafe Rio again.

This location is really disappointing. I go there pretty often and each time I see new people working there . Last night the guy who was giving me rice , beans and meat for my salad seemed to be not even knowing what he was doing . His metal trays were empty and when I saw it , I asked myself ""is he gonna refill it or serve the air ?"" Well, he didn't refill it.   He literally gave me NOTHING . Same thing he was doing to other people . The guy behind me looked at it and decided to get double meat cause double would be barely an amount of regular .  The same thing he did to rice and beans . I just wonder does this food goes from employers'  paychecks ? 
I'm giving 2 stars because another employee ( the guy who was serving the rest my salad ) gave me a good amount of salad . So I basically was eating greenies with tortilla yesterday .

For the record. I ordered a burrito enchilada style with fire Chicken and green sauce. 

What I got was burrito enchilada style with shredded chicken and red sauce. 

I was very disappointed and frustrated. 

Also your assembly line was so chaotic and loud it was hard to get your employees attention. 

The lady making tortillas taking orders did not communicate my party's order correct either. That is where the problem ultimately began.

Yes, I'm aware that they are fairly new but it was very disorganized. At one point me and the lady in line behind us didn't know who should pay the cashier first because some of our order was ready yet some was not and no one was advising us what to do. Awkwardness. Also some of the employees weren't very friendly. When my husband asked for green salsa for our chips and salsa she gave him a bad look and seemed annoyed that she had to go to the green salsa toward the end of the line versus the red salsa in front of her. We didn't appreciate the attitude. 

Now for the food. The tortillas were hot and fresh and so were the chips. The steak was a little tough and dry but I did enjoy the chile roast beef. It was super tender, juicy and flavorful. They should've drained it a little better before putting it in the taco though because my taco was drenched, dripping and a little soggy from the juice. The tacos came with rice and beans. The rice was good but the black beans lacked flavor. 

Overall, the food was pretty good but the service was a turn off. I would like to go back and try some of the other meat choices on the menu.

I went in Saturday Feb 7th, they were rather busy, I do not mind waiting but I the person was moving through the line trying to take my order before I was even up to the glass. When you have to yell at me over people that is probably the time should wait and allow the line to catch up. 
I was trying to order slow in hopes that the line would start moving. I ordered a salad, and asked for no rice, and of course there was rice. I asked to add sauce which when I opened the salad was very minimal.  I was very disappointed. 

The one thing that really bothers me is that I order several times through their catering and get meal vouchers which I was using. The cashier was upset or pissed off that I was using a voucher, and her attitude towards me really showed. She even wanted to charge me for a side of sour cream, which I have never been charged for. This is the second time visiting this location and using a voucher. I got the same response from the cashier. Its not like they are paying for my meal, so I do not get why there is always a bad attitude attached with theses vouchers.  I spent a few hundred dollars so I should not get the negative attitude when I come in there. 
This visit was a true disappointment. It is safe to say that I will never be back, I didn't even eat my salad I was so disgusted with them.

Both times I have waited in line for approximately 30 minutes. In my opinion even though the food is fresh, it's is made in an assembly line process and this length of time to wait is unacceptable. The line corral was only filled half way both times. Sadly I will have to only have cafe rio on my days off and not this location.",-DfRa6mbp1Oz8dFeMMxghA,0,0,3,VibtqhtKvykYGSjrhUfBxA

Most of the workers are very pleasant and ask you how your day is going and take great interest in getting to know how their customers are doing.  However, there is one worker in particular, Sissy, (what my receipt says) who constantly has a bad attitude towards customers and other coworkers.  Today, when I asked for chips and queso in a bowl, another coworker had put the chips in the container and he queso on the side.  Sissy then proceeds to scold him and tell him ""you should've put the queso inside the container with the chips.""  Sissy proceeds to open the chips and put the container of queso on the chips, which crushed the chips.  Disappointing, I didn't know I ordered crumbs.  As Sissy was the only one working the register and handling all the money she had no gloves on, there was a chip hanging out of the container and with her dirty, ungloved hand she put the chip back in the container.  My friend who was in line behind me had asked for chips on the side and when the same worker she previously scolded had proceeded to put it in a container, Sissy yelled at him and said ""are you stupid?  Put it in a bag!""  I thought that comment was very rude and super unnecessary.

People from the west coast tell me that Cafe Rio is the Chipotle here but much much better in terms of taste and authenticity. While I can kind of see where they are coming from when they talk about authentic Mexican food, this isn't really my cup of tea.

I am past the Chipotle phase of my college days but I do get cravings once in a while. Cafe Rio being conveniently close stood as an option. Both times I have tried, I could not find the appeal. First time I tried to fire grilled chicken salad. I do like that they give a lot of line but the dressing and salsa were pretty mild in taste with no kick. Their ""spicy"" was not one bit spicy. The vinegarette was beyond oily, I felt like I was eating leaves in an oil soup. The second time I tried the enchilada (was feeling fat).

I've never eaten in at this location, only ordered to go. they have gotten my order correct every time which is a plus.
My typical orders are Chicken Nachos, Chicken Tostada, or Tacos, and always Chips and Queso. There is always a ton of meat. I usually have left overs for another meal. I love the Creamy House dressing that they use for the salad, even if I don't get anything with veggies I still order some and dip my chips in it. So Yummy!
Parking lot is small and busy...if a line forms to order, you may be waiting a bit but you can order online and skip to the cashier!

I've visited 3 times since moving to this side of town and I can't seem to figure out why I didn't enjoy my meal.  After reading reviews I agree that the workers are hurried, make plenty mistakes, and are just miserable.  Except for maybe the girl at check out.  

I ordered a salad, kids meal quesadilla, and the free nino quesadilla (for kids under 6).  At checkout I was confirming the order with the cashier and the veggie lady was obviously listening in.  When I said kids meal she jumped in, all defensive and told the cashier ""no she ordered THE BIG quesadilla."" I shrugged her and her attitude off and just told them I wanted the kids one.  She went to remake it, made us pay, then wait for the kids meal, with a one year old in tow.  Geez, calm down lady.  I wonder if they recycled the perfectly good BIG quesadilla that was customized to my liking.  Either they threw it away or they mess up on purpose so they can save it for lunch :P:P:P:P",-8FDlhUsu5_lVONV_aOnGA,2,0,1,KQlTBL0xOXsnPpyin4Oy6A

I normally get 'everyone's norm' the shredded chicken salad with their cilantro dressing. I'll let you all in one a little secret. Get the shredded lettuce vs the normal Romaine lettuce they use. It truly makes a difference and you don't have huge pieces of lettuce falling out your mouth. And how did I go so long not trying their tortilla soup!!

A lot of people order specials so that is why it's a bit slow to order imo.

This location is unlike the others I've been to (eastern & blue diamond locations). It's incredibly modern inside and it reminds me more of a knock off chipotle atmosphere compared to the other locations which have a typical Mexican fast food feel. 

The drink selection at this location looked incredible. I have to admit that I've never noticed that they make their own drinks at the other locations.... The way they display them here made me want to buy a drink & I am your typical, only a water cup, please, customer. 

Food is still just, okay. The chicken was seasoned well but the portions are minuscule compared to their competitors. One of which is a short drive away...they also need a spicer mild salsa option.

The tortillas are delicious. Can I just buy a whole plate of those?  

Also, better service then the other southwest location on blue diamond. So drive the extra 10 minutes!",WnheFaHC4RyDNTf6scisyg,1,0,3,pV6Y2Z63BAz5pU93qXnbXQ

I've ordered their nachos and quesadilla here and they are both real greasy and not consistent depending on who's making the food. I do like the whole 10 meals and get 1 free punch card idea which is cool. Their customer service is cool although I did see one employee be kind of rude to a customer which I think could have been handled better.

I love this particular location which is Amazing as I have been to both Sahara locations and had horrible experiences.

They are fresh, delicious, filling and reasonable.

They have great options, burritos, quesadillas, tacos, tostadas, and taco salad. They also have a standard daily special with a non menu item.

I tried the coconut shrimp taco special on Tuesday, mmmm yum yes delicious!

The burritos are HUGE and is really two meals!

The staff is super friendly at this location and I am devoted to this location only!

They have Amazing desserts! I really enjoy the keylime tart and tres leches strawberry cake it is so good.

If you complete the survey on your receipt than dessert is FREE on your next visit.

We have eaten here so many times that the staff recognizes us and is always sweet and welcoming.

This group of staff is super fun and nice, they are the Super Stars getting all of us hungry customers through the line.

The process is easy, decide on what you want, burrito, tacos, enchiladas etc. Then you pick a meat, chicken, asada, sweet pork, salmon etc. They build it for you as you like it, rice, beans, etc.

We are on the late freight in trying Cafe Rio, we had been missing out this whole time!
