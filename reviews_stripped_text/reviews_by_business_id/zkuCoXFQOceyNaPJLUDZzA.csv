You can choose the buffet, which is very pricey and doesn't include coffee or juice, and that's a little quicker.  They seem to be perpetually short-staffed in the morning.  I guess that Bally's figures that since this restaurant is the only game in town - or at least in the hotel - for breakfast, they don't need to make an effort to please their guests.

They are slow to seat guests.  One of the waiters is terribly rude, although the waitress on the last visit was delightful and did her best in trying circumstances. 

If you stay at Bally's, you either need to get up a lot earlier than you normally would or plan to skip breakfast.

There's a coffee cart near check-in, but there's no information about it, so if you don't see it, you won't know it's there. I wish I'd known about it earlier in my stay.",Tu9Lg3EffIv4ozeNpTnzfQ,1,0,2,D0cQrzhN0k-yCUnQ9thrJg

The food was mediocre. The service was actually pretty good. The setup of the dining area and buffet was atrocious. A long line outside to be seated, then a line almost as long to actually get food. The selection was pretty limited, as its basically a motel style continental breakfast. There is no live cooking, the ""omelets"" are just a warmer tray of dried out eggs covered with cheese. The whole buffet area is basically one small counter of warmer trays stuck in the back of the dining area.

With the rather long line to get any food, most people were double fisting with two plates. This, in turn, meant that the supply of clean plates was quickly exhausted, stopping the line from any further movement.

Finally, you don't pay when you enter. When you leave, you pay at a cashier counter, so there is often yet another line to wait.

They lure you in with ubiquitous signs of $11.99 for brunch.  But, this is nothing but a fraud.

First, it is $11.99 for brunch, but hey, that doesn't include beverages.  What buffet brunch charges you extra for non-alcoholic beverages?

When you find out that there is an extra charge, it is too late.  You are already seated at the table.  Why? Because your menu makes it clear that there is an extra charge, right there, in bold, in red.  It's just that the 100 or so signs surrounding the hotel offering the $11.99 brunch conveniently don't mention that fact. 

Did I mention the entire buffet line is about 15 feet long? Yes, that's how many options you have in total, about 15.  

Bally's may have once been a decent casino, but it has had to resort to fraud to get customers in.  Truly sad.

My friend and I were supposed to have late lunch (around 3:30 pm) elsewhere, but that place was closed at the time.  Sidewalk cafe seemed like a reasonable option at the time.

We walked in and obeyed the ""Please Wait To Be Seated"" sign.  We stood there for 3-4 minutes before the hostess made an appearance.  All the while, the two cashiers were staring right at us like that Money You Could Be Saving With GEICO character, pretending not to notice us.  Finally we were seated at the booth next to a nice elderly couple.  There were hundreds of tables available, but Sidewalk Cafe chose to close off two large dining areas, making everyone sit within uncomfortable proximity of one another.

I ordered Cajun Chicken Fettuccine ($14.95) and a side Caesar salad ($3.95).  My friend ordered a plate of nachos ($9.95) for lunch, for which she got a lot of grief from me: ""Nachos, seriously?  How old ARE you?""  However, she was the one who laughed last.  

The Caesar salad that we ended up splitting was pretty boring.  Everything it lacked in the flavor department, it made up with abundance of yucky Caesar dressing.  The Cajun Chicken Fettuccine was neither ""Cajun"" nor ""chicken.""  There was a lot of dry chicken strips floating in the sea of tasteless Alfredo sauce and store-bought pasta.  My friend's nachos looked good enough by ballpark standards, not by restaurant standards.  I did not dare try them.  The portions were very generous though, although the prices did not jive with the quality of the food.

Sidewalk Cafe is seriously understaffed.

Stood there aimlessly as the servers walked about without giving us any direction in how to get service. Sat ourselves (party of 7) in a section that was closed since there weren't any open, clean tables that were ready for us. Sat there for 10 minutes, and realized no one was going to come our way. Hailed down a server walking past us who was happy to take our order. The only downfall was that I suppose he was in a hurry to do whatever he was on his way to the kitchen to do in the first place prior to us hailing him down, so he didn't stay to hear the rest of our order. I'll give him a benefit of a doubt- perhaps he thought we were finished ordering? But after seeing another table who sat after us receive their water before we did, I thought I needed to speak to a manager. I walked up to the bar and the bartender said he would get the manager. After 5 minutes of standing I decided I'd wait for this ""manager"" at my table. Our order of 6 tacos and 2 margaritas arrived and still no manager. Finished the meal and still no manager.

#1. All servers should acknowledge guests.
#2. I don't care if someone's not sitting in a ""section"" or your section. Eventually there has to be communication between the servers and or management as to who's going to take the party. 
#3. You're always going to get customers who aren't sober. It's not an excuse, but it is true. I understand that one of our members was out of it, but don't walk away without completing the order. If anything call management to deal with the individual. If they see fit, they'll ask them to leave and trouble will go away. In our case, I believe the server was just being impatient. 
#4. Managers, where the heck are you? Your server's service is a direct reflection of you. In fact, I almost can't blame them for not knowing to how to greet customers, and serve patiently and serve fast- you didn't even show your face! WTF.

The buffet line consists of the main breakfast staples. About a dozen items. Nothing flashy or extravagant. But it's hard to beat $12 buffet on the strip.

Just a no-frills cheap eats if staying or near Ballys. It might be some people's thing and some I'm sure would find it horrible.

A classic Vegas favorite that's soon to close because Caesar's Palace has filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. It's a pity that Caesar's Entertainment has nothing but bad news for their deteriorating resorts and layoffs to come. I'm glad to have had my last breakfast here as it will be the last of the classic affordable Vegas eats on the strip.

My Dad was a Platinum Casino Rewards member so fortunately we didn't have to wait in the long line. Service was speedy and our waitress was very attentive with refilling our drinks. You had an option to eat on the buffet or order on their menu. Food was just average as well as the prices. It didn't break the bank at all. 

From the buffet I had scrambled eggs, bacon and some toast. Nothing over the top just the basic breakfast eats. The rest of my family just ordered from the menu and I wish I had done the same thing because their buffet had really limited selection.

For the best value I decided the buffet. Unlike eating at Le Village Buffet at Paris Las Vegas, I wasn't planning to get a lot of plates. I wanted to get just enough plates to satisfy my hunger throughout the whole day as I was leaving from Vegas to LA to San Jose. There aren't a lot of items on this buffet. The items here resemble a continental breakfast buffet at a hotel in Orange County around Disneyland. It's nice for that kind of hotel, but not for a casino and hotel in Vegas. The first plate I got included scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and country fried steak. For the breakfast buffet toast and cereal was included. So for second plate I got sourdough toast and oatmeal. The second plate was the best plate for the whole buffet. Inside the sourdough toast was moist as if it came right out of the oven. The oatmeal with brown sugar was soothing dish for breakfast. The last two plates I didn't take pictures as I forgot or didn't care. The third plate was portion of cinnamon roll, a donut, and country fried steak. The last plate consisted of fruits like watermelon and pineapple. So if the second plate, which consisted of sourdough toast and oatmeal, was the best plate of the whole buffet why didn't I give this buffet a lower rating? As a Total Rewards Card Member I got about a fifty percent discount for the buffet. Instead of paying about $13 including taxes I paid about $7. Is this buffet worth $13? No. If you're a Total Rewards Card Member is this buffet worth $7? Yes.",4hVHTZhy70Sw4gmQfk1pJg,2,1,3,Q-tRcr3bYvxk10LpE1--Hg

With all the great dining options around, there's surely better good around!",U1IJyl62vzKeAZ-fUZl05Q,0,0,2,RH1RpvdzsgCDZ2vCkcD4-A

I had the All American Breakfast, which came with eggs, meat of your choice, and french toast or pancakes.  I chose to have the french toast and it was ok, but the syrup was very watery.  The eggs were edible and the bacon was actually cooked how I like it (a little crispy).

My friend got a ham and cheese omelette and we laughed when it arrived because it looked like they threw a Kraft cheese single on top of it to melt.  She said there was way too much cheese inside.

Edible food, but not my first choice for breakfast.",nlOqiupHx-HJXxxIo1xArQ,0,0,2,DLUl2LJsdHMkKhNAxotrUA
