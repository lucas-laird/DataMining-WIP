501645,2007-05-28,1,_ZSCWjiYNPjnteZDo-AZOg,"Senor Miguel's at the Suncoast Casino is a typical Amerimex place, with nachos, tostadas, chimichangas, and fajitas.  The service isn't very friendly or attentive, but they give you tons of chips and bowls of salsa and warm bean dip.  The food is more American than Mexican, but they give generous portions.  The best part about this place is that it's located right next to the Oyster Bar, which shares the same kitchen.  You can order anything the Oyster Bar has and have it served to you along with your enchiladas.    This is a great way for people with kids to comfortably enjoy the food from the Oyster Bar without having to balance the kids on the barstools.    I will probably would go back when my in-laws are in town, because they can get their Amerimex food and I get the Oyster Bar's bouillabaisse and oysters, while the kids are comfortably wedged in between us in a booth :)

By the way, their ""fried ice cream"" is NOT fried.  It's just a scoop of vanilla rolled in a sticky-sweet coconut and peanut mixture.",E7sk9jsImePqLT4roNgotg,3,0,2,UmoUvoXSSNuGFaMBdvtqwA

It was a delightful experience. We both ordered the chicken Montery, one of the specials.  I would rate it outstanding from flavor and presentation perspectives.  Very creative cuisine.

I've grown up in Southern Ca and consider myself a pretty good judge of good Mexican food, but I did not expect to find it at a hotel in Vegas! The taquitos and relleno are scrump.

Ever since the casino took over the food has continued to go down in quality.  They removed the margarita and taco special which was really good.  You used to wait to be seated....now its 50% empty.    Now they have a taco and enchilada buffet that is absoulutely horrible.  They dont even give you a plate to use!!!!   They make you use the appetizer plate on the table.  Food is cold and doughy...I mean really.  Dont bother to waste your time coming to this restaurant unless your already in the hotel, their are many better mexican restaurants all over the place.   Oh and by the way, the servers are rude and not knowledgeable about the menu, I mean just an overall bad place.",fX58R4-bic9FoqfpNK9Cyg,1,0,1,3Mq3ruvuaVt5J-3rfbJ4dQ

They kind if went downhill with quality because now they do buffet (serve yourself style) versus freshly made enchiladas and tacos. They also don't do endless margaritas anymore. Buffet style enchiladas and kind of hard after 5 minutes.

Nice decor and attentive staff. They were a 4 but after the change a strong 3.",qS_nLMJ1jc_0Y3BFsPcJAQ,0,0,3,6i4RrWVEdCqhNjIRl_L7lg
1735881,2015-01-05,5,_ZSCWjiYNPjnteZDo-AZOg,"Friendly service & it just works for us :)

We've been coming here for years and we always order the exact same dishes! This is very unusual for me but it just works for us as we always share. We start with the chicken flautas which are always on point with some guacamole on the side & sour cream. We then move into the steak fajitas! We get our veggies cooked extra long & the flavors are on point. We always drizzle some extra fresh lime juice and the steak is cooked to perfection. 
We recently started adding the churros to our dinner because they are too good to pass up. Overall it's a very casual place and the service for the most part has been consistently good.
The Suncoast is definitely geared towards seniors and I actually like that! It's quiet and we just slip in to enjoy our meal & then we're out...",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,5,6,4,wL5UGgZQNtHwFbiT7xYMcQ

I think it was 5/6 medium size shrimps placed around something(I ate it but don't remember what it was).  Meal tab with drinks around $57 for my twin kids and I.    Shoulda went to the casino buffet instead.  Oh well, at least I have an opinion. DON'T ORDER SHRIMP ANYWHERE!!",aUgeH8sQFM_abSi1EsVSzw,0,0,1,LTDohr9Aebf2F0dQHwziDA

I am not sure why the name changed to ""Coasta Cantina"" but I will tell you the food is the SAME consistency and quality. It is located inside the Suncoast.

You get started with chips, salsa, and bean dip. All are good. This last visit I decided to try the ""Carne Asada"" and it was soooo good! The meat was full of flavor and that was with them cooking it well done per my request.

On Wednesday and Thursday night they currently have the following special..
Endless Tacos, Enchiladas and Bottomless Margaritas - $9.99 
-Choice of ground beef, shredded beef or chicken tacos
-Choice of cheese or chicken enchiladas with red or green sauce
-Includes flan for dessert

We go for this all of the time you just can't beat it! If you haven't tried this place yet it is a must if you love good Mexican food and not have to pay an arm and a leg.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,6,3,5,By0WjtjXqJeoQv4a3CLZ1A
3688961,2014-07-05,0,_ZSCWjiYNPjnteZDo-AZOg,I have been going to this place for ten years now. They did change their name and until now I haven't been back. The food is still outstanding.

4254984,2013-05-29,0,_ZSCWjiYNPjnteZDo-AZOg,"Average Mexican food.  Nothing to write home about.  Chips were good and so were the salsa.  The refried beans were excellent.  So much flavor. 

We started with the Mexican potato skins.  These were really good.  Crispy potato skin with cheese and different meats.  They give you 3 of them, one chicken, one pork, and one ground beef.  The beef one was the best.  The ground beef was really good.  A good amount of spices. 

The wife had a cheese enchilada and a chicken taquito plate.  She liked the enchilada, but didn't like the taquito.  The chicken inside was good, but they really scimped on the size.  They only gave you one.   I ordered the chile relleno and a beef taquito.  I liked the taquito, but the size is just not worth it.  The chile relleno was not good.  It was poblano stuffed with cheese and then an egg batter crusted on the top of it and baked.  So disappointing. 

Overall just an average Mexican restaurant meal.",vlc6EN9zb66D01fLE8ehPQ,0,0,3,SpffA5qPFMfuAgpzQprdDQ

There was so much food in the beginning that I couldn't even eat my dinner because I was so full. First there is salsa and bean dip and part of the 2 for deal is an appetizer and my husband chose this sampler which was a dinner itself. The only thing that wasn't that good was the churros for dessert. They were kinda stale and they covered it with chocolate and whipped cream. It sounds good but it didn't taste good.

The employee's are nice and as always it is not a busy restaurant.",EZzV8WIUGWJ7D-e5E7XdjQ,0,0,4,K8WRYhb0gpfzNSmiq6tdug
4992808,2014-11-06,1,_ZSCWjiYNPjnteZDo-AZOg,"Sourly this is a big ""UGH"" review.  Due to a big shopping decision earlier in the day, we ended up here (to save $$) for our 1st Anny dinner, instead of Fogo De Chao.  So the place is located inside the Suncoast Hotel and Casino.  My hubby had previously ate here alone, and wanted me to try it.  I'm a vegetarian, so I'm rather limited at Mexican restaurants, but I browsed their menu and chose the cheese quesadillas app and ""sizzling"" veggie fajita.  Hubby got some mexican platter.  All of our food was below average for the price you pay.  ALL OF IT.  But I could get over that, because I'm used to average mexican food.  So what made this place 1 star?  SERVICE.  Horrendous service.  Our male server, could not give a damn about helping us.  He was absent, slow, and non-friendly.  And we went at 5pm, and the place was only 1/2 full.  He disappeared for long stretches, even when I paid and so we had to wait for the receipt.   We spent over an hour inside, just because of the slow service.  We wanted out, and couldn't because our bill was held hostage!  We'll never be back.  My sizzling fajita was barely edible, UGH.  This place is SUPER UGH.",iwQsBQDrpQirBmmCxmzLeQ,0,0,1,5HfQrpr9arZqy48eUVYPaQ

We came here tonight for $9.99 endless tacos or enchiladas (avail on wed or thurs night) and bottomless margaritas and flan for dessert.  

I chose the chicken enchiladas and had 3 margaritas (yummy), My dinner was very good. Service was average. I had to wait for more salsa that took almost 10 minutes to get. 

I think this special is very good and I would absolutely go back again.  I was actually surprised that their margaritas were really good (choice of traditional or strawberry) and it wasn't just watered down or anything. Even the flan was good.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,1,0,4,7zq38B5DBBUAGHlRP7JsGg
5093417,2015-04-21,0,_ZSCWjiYNPjnteZDo-AZOg,"I had family visiting me, but they preferred hotel accommodations. 
I recommended they stay at the Suncoast because it is the most upscale hotel/casino near my house.
 A long time ago, I ate at this place, but I don't remember anything outstanding or horrible.
If anything, I remember thinking it was pretty good.
Well...The service and the atmosphere are very good, but sadly, the food is not.
The rice was dry, my taco shell was stale, and I tried my cousin's chicken dish, and it was tasteless. 
And, considering that it's a hotel restaurant, the food is overpriced. 
It just doesn't cut the mustard (or salsa).",TP84hS-tDZGv0vEDSowrxQ,0,0,2,8isG57aUlqH-xhu2xZSNUw
5356590,2015-11-04,0,_ZSCWjiYNPjnteZDo-AZOg,"The Coasta Cantina is located next to the escalators in the Suncoast Casino.

On Friday, 10/30, we arrived here at 5:30 & found it not very busy or espec. friendly.  I ordered the Coasta Cantina chicken special and my partner had a chicken burrito.  The service was lousy because when more & more people arrived, the 2 servers couldn't handle it all.  Everyone in that dining room waited at least 40 minutes for their food and we were told nothing when we inquired.  The bean dip was horrible and almost cold.  My chicken wasn't pink, but thin & transparent.  The sauce of spinach & mushrooms was only warm, & very mediocre.  The burrito was the smallest I've ever seen on a plate & delivered once again with that pitiful bean dip.  Our server never returned to ask if all was well with our food.

The ambiance was 1950's with huge booths that blocked the lovely tall windows.  The lighting was like hitting George Webb's hamburger parlor at 1:00 am, and there was no music emanating from anywhere (which could have helped the mood for sure).

Las Vegas has a huge population of Mexican restaurants, so how this one gets away with even being open is a mystery.",kFFhw53ZEPoDo6okPU4eRg,2,0,1,bwx7rJQ_Dlea2cDdn8ux4Q

5686927,2016-01-17,0,_ZSCWjiYNPjnteZDo-AZOg,"I'll start off by saying that we arrived around 845p and later realized they closed at 930p, so it may have attributed to the atmosphere and service.  

We were seated at one of many empty booths but couldn't actually sit down until the booth was cleaned off from the crumbs left behind by the last patrons.  I did notice some stains on the upholstery of the seat, some white smears, that I only hoped could be sour cream from the hands of a small child. 

The chips and salsa were just okay.  The salsa had a nice taste and consistency but the chips looked like they were bought from the store and tasted about the same.  The beans however tasted extremely bland and old, I wouldn't have fed them to a starving dog. 

We ordered and shared the chicken fajitas, which came out sizzling and their presentation was quite nice.  They were served with an additional plate of guacamole, beans, and rice.   The beans looked to be the same as the ones served with the chips, so I didn't try them.  The rice looked okay but didn't taste very good at all, I only could stomach one bite. 

Being that nothing had been very great thus far, I didn't have high expectations for the main dish.  To my surprise, the fajitas were pretty good.  Cooked well and through, the chicken was just right.  The seasoning was good, and the flours were soft and fresh.   If it weren't for these, my rating would have been 1 star.  

The service was rushed and our waiter wasn't at all enthused that we were there; which I'm sure was because it was towards the end of his shift.  We did finish our meal and left well before 930p, though. 

I won't be returning anytime soon and cannot see the restaurant lasting much longer with these types of standards.",zBfO7lz3DbQZmelHCSD1sw,0,0,2,wIzgFB33R-COEnU-nqqsYg
