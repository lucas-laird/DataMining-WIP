The cashier (girl with glasses and braces who I believe is Andrea) quickly said yeah when I asked for the dressing on the side. What I got was a salad drenched in dressing. It was late and so I didn't have time to return it. The second time I also ordered with her and the same thing but this time I sent it back. Third time I went to the Arroyo location and the guy got my order right! Well I decided to return to the arroyo location even if it is out of my way just to not have the mixup happen again. I went in and almost walked right back out when I saw Andrea was the cashier. I ordered and said ""please make sure the dressing is on the side"" she said yup and of course I did not get dressing on the side. The food is great and everyone else is wonderful but I will walk out if she is the cashier next time.",tYU_cfjvhZVkXpEGM8fL-A,0,0,3,_w6njobSJikueXmNFvllfg

You order at a counter and they give you a number and deliver to the table. We both ordered the chicken leg-thigh and rib combo. Very tasty.

We got the baby back ribs since they are dry rub and not smothered in BBQ sauce like they normally are - which might be the source of some of the bad reviews.  Personally we love dry rub ribs much better, and since they gave us sauce on the sides, we didn't understand all the complaints about the ribs being under seasoned.  I actually preferred the ribs without the sauce and the seasoning was perfect to me, my gf dipped them in the sauce however.",GdsNZN_yMfKNQ6Mf0c3hGw,0,0,4,Ta7J_5o0fhvbXAESbhuMDg

They smoke their meats right outside the store in the parking lot and the smoky flavor wafts into your car as you drive in! Been hard to find a real bbq in Vegas but look no more! Let me get to the details. My husband and I split the sides we ordered: coleslaw and beans. The beans were outstanding and instead of serving a slice of bread with the meal, they served a fresh, warm tortilla to mop up your bbq beans! The chicken and ribs were moist and smoky and were seasoned so well you didn't need alot of sauce, which by the way is homemade and they took it right out of the pot to give us.

298281,2015-12-02,1,2dCnTMv3Hh-fM8bOjYS4Xw,Went for lunch yesterday with my wife and mother in law. I have been in the past and always been happy with the food. Today I had a chicken wrap and a Caesar salad. The salad was large and fresh and wrap was good. My wife had a quarter chicken and the mashed potatoes and gravy which she really enjoyed. My mother in law had the six wings and coleslaw. She enjoyed the wings and gave me one. I would say the wings are the worst thing I have had there. The sauce on the wings was a mediocre and the wings didn't have that nice crispy feel to them. The place is definitely worth a stop in but be aware that the place is small and gets very full especially during the lunch rush so make sure you try to get there a little early or a little later.,yLCsv3QheMmnZJyKgDdSqg,0,1,4,22FAMVThZNDfkrrkNL1VxA

321641,2014-08-05,10,2dCnTMv3Hh-fM8bOjYS4Xw,"I hate this place, yet I constantly go here because its the restaurant that sucks the least out of all venues in this neighborhood. 

The first and most flagrant violation that this restaurant makes is that it is a blatant knock off of California Chicken Cafe. CCC is a very respectable chicken chain in southern california that does EXACTLY what Nevada Chicken Cafe tries to do, only 100x better, cleaner, cheaper, and more efficiently. The owner of Nevada Chicken must have gone into CCC, enjoyed his meal, and unintelligently figured he could replicate the same concept in Nevada. I would imagine that if one were to conduct their due diligence, the owner of Nevada Chicken has some personal ties to Southern California and i would imagine his credit card statements would show multiple purchases at California Chicken Cafe restaurants while he was conducting field research / concept theft.  

Setting aside the fact that this concept is a ripoff of another restaurant, this place really sucks. When you walk through the doors you are greeted by the smell of stale chicken rotting into the cracks and crevices of banquettes and refrigerator vents. This place is incessantly filthy and you feel like you might get ringworm just by resting your elbows on the tables. How a restaurant manages to stay so filthy, so frequently is beyond me. God forbid you have to go to the 'salsa bar', you will see the remnants of weeks old chicken and tomatoes, salsa stained floors and sneeze guards, and rotting cucumbers. The tables always have old food on them and if you ask someone to clean the tables they'll look at you like you farted in their mouth. 

This leads me to the main problem with this restaurant. The staff. Everyone that works at this restaurant seems to have been bludgeoned in the head with a pipe, bat, or brick at some point during their childhood developmental years. I dont typically venture to quick concept restaurants expecting rhode scholar employees to be serving me bbq chicken, but i do expect to pay for what i ordered, and I expect consistency when ordering the same thing twice. I guess the only thing consistent about this restaurant, is that they are consistently inconsistent. If you order an avocado wrap with a side caesar salad, and an additional side of roasted potatoes, you should anticipate receiving something like an avocado-less wrap with a side of corn and and extra side of macaroni. So if you go to this restaurant, make sure you proof read the food once it is handed over. If you do happen to get avocado on your avocado wrap, it will probably come from a premature avocado and your avocado will have the consistency of a frozen stick of butter. Nevada Chicken Cafe is REALLY good at serving un-ripe avocados. I've actually watched the desperate employee in the glasses grab a premature avocado and mash the poor thing on the counter top to try and soften it up so his knife could cut through the skin. 

The food here is shit. All of it is bland. 

The thing that is so disappointing about this place is that it would take SO LITTLE to make this restaurant good. The concept is so easy... its just chicken. Grill it, cut it, serve it, and dont screw it up. I think thats why I constantly go back. I figure, 'how can they mess this up? It must have been a fluke the last 100 times.' Screw this place. I'm finally done letting you ruin my meals. Fuck Nevada Chicken Cafe.",VfXQbpVaY-RPg4h-h-j7Ow,7,2,1,4zXa6NuGOnJQtYayh5ixow

I ordered  the 3 dark chicken plate with one side and  an additional 2 sides, he than gave me my cups. When I went to fill my drinks there was no ice and the Coke was out. So I kindly asked him if he could fill/replace my request and  with an attitude said ""ill be right over there okay!"" Blown away by the response and tone he directed towards me I patiently waited. Customers waiting in line behind us have already  got there food and I ask another employee if she could kindly change the Coke and said says "" okay"". 20 minutes later for 3 pieces of chicken and 3 sides the woman brings us our food outside and I ask her if we could have another set of silverware. With a very nasty attitude she said "" uh huh"". I still do not have my Coke. So I look down at my plate and I only see 2 pieces of chicken. I go to the counter and ask for another set of silverware and let him know my order is incomplete and he finally tells me the Coke is out to just grab one from the  fridge. He  follows me to our table to point out that the chicken was not cut, making it still a 3 piece meal. Portion wise to me there was only 2 but I guess he's the chicken expert. Fed up I take my plate to the counter and ask for a refund of my meal. He hands me my money for just the 3 piece and I walk back to our table and notice my sister no longer wants to eat there if only she was going to eat. We than walk up to the counter again and finally ask for a full refund. He grabs her sided lunges them in the garbage can. Pretty much I didn't want to eat there from the beginning and now I really have a reason to never go there again. What really got me was that an employee could be soo rude to a customer.

Mashed Potatoes - 1/2 Star (only for the effort)

My girlfriend asked the woman taking her order if the meal came with a salad and she said it didn't, so she ordered side salads for her and her daughter; the meal came out with salads on the plate AND two more salads that she asked for (basically charged for 2 unnecessary salads). No complaints about their food whatsoever, I even tried a little of the ribs and chicken. The one thing I noticed was the customer area was sparkling, they had someone (sometimes 2 people) cleaning the dining area (you could smell the cleaning supplies a little too much), but I'd rather the restaurant be too clean than not enough.

When I ordered the family size chicken and ribs that is supposed to come with a rack of ribs the girls told me they only had half a rack left for the night. I said ok if they could throw in some extra chicken. 

Then I sat and waited over 30 minutes. While waiting I watched a female employee carry a wet shelf across the kitchen dripping the whole way. She saw it dripping and did nothing about it. She stood it up between a counter and cabinet just behind the register. Then slammed it into place with her butt. She must have seen the look on my face because she then sauntered back and forth swinging her hips like she was pretty proud of herself. 

Another girl without gloves tossed a knife into the pile of meat a man was cutting and packaging. 

And then there was the woman with the long pony tail flipping around without a net. 

My personal favorite was the young lady who filled herself a side container of watermelon with her hand and then grabbed her purse and left. After watching her ungloved hand dig in the watermelon I wrote off one of my side dishes. My watermelon came out of the same container after her hands were in it. 

Finally got my food and raced home starving. 3 ribs does not make half a rack. And I got the same amount of chicken I always get with this meal. There was no extra to compensate for the lack of ribs. 

The Mac and cheese was good. The mashed potatoes were ok. But we threw the dirty watermelon away in the empty rib container ... Kinda like they threw away a regular customer tonight!!

The service has gotten worse each time I've been in over the past 6 months or so. There is a definite who cares attitude among the staff that there didn't used to be. I am horribly disappointed ... And still hungry ... $50 for dinner didn't fill 3 people with the missing ribs and now I have to cook after waiting half an hour for take out.",76crp1vXF1A3LOoNP6zcUQ,6,0,1,ShqoTZZ9O7B_RyiD8Mp4NA

Me:
The only way you could improve is as I suggested. 

1. Service
2. Seats that can support a child ( bare minimum ).
3. Try a light brine with your chickens, ""dryness"".
4. Just make your sides buffet style, because they won't improve.

P.S. I won't be back... you're lucky you don't have a lawsuit!, My little boy received a decent sized bump on his head and I am sure a nice headache to sleep off that night. 
You can improve such as I have stated,  and by spelling my name right, and using better English grammar or that may be why your seats break in the first place... low attention to detail.  I sir have a very HIGH tolerance to many things but, when my siblings get hurt EVERY poor details comes to light.
Just let old dogs lay, take your licks, and count your blessings.

Old review:

First time there chicken for both me and my wife was dry... Sides were fruit salad and limp cucumber salad could have made it better at home for less.

Second time back we gave it a second chance this did not happen however, we waited behind some happy people trying to figure out what to order for over 10 minutes while the line behind us backed up.

We finally had our chance to order after noticing 2  people coming up asking where there lunches were.

We took our table it was me, my wife and my 2 year old son...my son feel through the seat down to the floor while I in shock I quickly pulled him out while he began to cry turned to the front counter girl and demanded a full refund ($28 ) and left, I will never be back. They let people sit in broken seats? I doubt there chicken has improved they could improve there service by making the sides ALL buffet style as they are CHEAPLY MADE anyway.",eprBxC4U5xnYb24cffDxxA,1,0,1,tpLrdtgBs0lgZo3_2Xm6YA

They have more than chicken, they also serve BBQ ribs and a great variety of sides, sandwiches and salads. We ordered a whole chicken to go and ate it at home with some homemade sides from previous meals that we already had, the chicken was moist and very flavorful it went great with just anything.

First of all it was SO NOISY!!!! The music that was playing was so loud I thought I was in a club. I couldn't even hear the cashier & talking to my friend was almost impossible. There was a couple of minutes between the albums & that was a nice rest. Then it started again. 
 The food wasn't as good as the Sahara location. We both got a combo rib & 1/4 chicken dinner. This time the ribs didn't fall off the bone & it was kind of dry. I had to slather the bbq sauce to make it ""wetter"". The chicken was good but, you could tell that it wasn't as fresh as the first time I ate at NCC. I got a corn on the cobb again but, it was hard as a rock. I had to slather the butter on it to eat the cobb. The last time I didn't even need butter it was so good.
  The bus person cleaned all of the dirty tables but didn't even touch our dishes tbat were clearly done. I guess I'm being picky, being in the f & b industry but I hate a dirty table & always try to clear dishes to make room for my guests. I don't get why she didn't do that. 
 I left a 20% tip with the cashier & absolutely no thank you from the cashier who saw me leave a good tip. It's pretty sad that employees have no personality & have no grace to say thank you. After all
Tips aren't guaranteed.

After extensively checking reviews here and browsing their online menu, I settled on the 1/4 rack rib combo with leg+thigh for my guy, with a side of saffron rice, and a chicken mozzarella wrap for myself with the mac and cheese. Opted for a taste of home with a Dr. Pepper for our drink, and hit up the salsa bar for a cucumber-based pico de gallo, an orange-looking ""salsa verde"", and a crave-inducing garlic ranch sauce.

Service was quick and friendly, and despite a lackluster exterior, the interior of the place is clean and organized with windowed views to the kitchen where you can watch the guys cutting up the hot grilled meats as you wait for your food. Plenty of booths, and I was downright surprised to see tables of families with eerily silent kids- kids entirely focused on devouring their food. That's downright unusual, and I knew I was in for something special.

The ribs we ordered saucy, at the cashier's suggestion, despite his mention that the dry-rub style sell better. I love a good sauce, and theirs was spot on! Not to spicy, not too sweet, but good balance and robust flavor that complemented the char of the chicken as well as the meaty ribs. BF and I picked off of one another's plates but the obvious was that I should have gone for a second meat plate rather than a wrap.

The mozzarella wrap was large and tasty, and served as an excellent vehicle for that amazing garlic ranch sauce they have, but the taste of the cold chicken was more subdued and the grill-fresh char flavor was rendered almost absent. It's a good healthy-ish option though, but I might opt for a salad instead next time.

As for the sides? The saffron rice was moist and flavorful, and the mac was solid- not dry, not overly cheesy and saucy, but a good version worth having on the menu that doesn't feel too heavy or contrast too sharply with the other major menu offerings. 

Attentive and helpful service, damn good chicken and ribs, AND a Yelp deal to offset the price? Done.

When you order inside the restaurant, you can see the side options and they all look yummy, it's almost hard to choose!  There are two chicken options for the chicken: I prefer the rotisserie chicken over the mesquite, but they are both very good- you should specify which you prefer when ordering. Consider ordering a family meal w/ sides over individual orders to save $$. All of the sides were tasty, including the chicken pasta (cold), mac n cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, salad, etc. 

They also serve wraps, salads, and sandwiches, again very delicious. My favorite is the chicken avocado wrap. Mmmm... 

Added bonus for NCC is that they let you create your own wrap or salad from scratch and you can order all white meat. Let them know what ingredients you want from the list and they'll whip it up for you.

The chicken is always cooked to perfection but the smokey flavor sets it off the top. This includes their BBQ sauce that is to die for! Don't be fooled though, their sides are also one of my favorites. In fact, their mashed potatoes are by far the best I've ever tasted! Their Mac and cheese is always fresh and super creamy. Their veggies and fruits are always super fresh.

I've been coming to this place for years now and it's always been the same faces. The employees are ALL working and because they're all so quick, efficient, and friendly, it's hard to tell who their manager is because you can see that much passion in the work that hey do. Let's not forget their owners. They are always present and always going above and beyond to make sure that not only their customers get the best service, but that their employees also also happy and have their support.

One of those times it was later in the evening, maybe around 6 or so. I could understand them being out since it was so late in the day. But my most recent visit was at 1:30 and they were out. I don't know if they only make x per day or what, but this is becoming a trend I don't like! 

Besides not having my favorite item available, the customer service is pretty bad. On our last visit, there was a decent rush, about 10 people in line, and only one cashier. Not only that, but she would stop in the middle of taking orders, and answer the phone and take their order. Totally unprofessional and rude! They do this every time they are busy too. One weird thing to mention is there are no trash cans so people can't throw away their garbage, so dishes and trash are left on the tables for a ridiculously long time. Also, they need to pay more attention to detail. We ordered a bunch of food and told them we were dining in, yet our food was packaged to go. Also when we specified tortillas with our food, we got dinner rolls. These are all minor things, but they add up to one big annoyance!

In summary, get your shit together NCC! I am not going to boycott this place because I love the food, but I will probably only order to-go from now on.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,6,3,3,uy70yBKZGUqalMiJMvJ6Wg

2270207,2015-04-04,0,2dCnTMv3Hh-fM8bOjYS4Xw,"Let me start this out with the fact that I almost NEVER write reviews..... but this has compelled me to begin. Since opening I have been going to the Nevada chicken cafe about 2-3 times a month. The food is always fresh and the ingredients are proudly displayed. The staff is friendly, food delicious and service is usually reasonable and within expectations even during busy times. Unfortunately this is where my review of the establishment ends and my candid review of a specific individual begins. This business appears to be family owned. The owner or possibly general manager a gentleman in his late 40's early 50's short hair greying in color is easily spotted. He and he alone is the cause of myself never spending another dollar at the establishment again. This individual has zero professionalism managing employees. On many occasions he can be seen degrading his kitchen staff with extremely rude remarks. He yells, slams things on the counter and pretty much acts like Gordon Ramsey on steroids. Let me tell you something you are not on TV. Intimidation and humiliation are NOT how employees should be treated. If someone (or most staff in this persons eyes) is underperforming one  should stop and look at the quality of leadership first. Have you empowered your staff with the adequate knowledge to excel in there duties? Try some positive reinforcement for a change. The final straw for me was on 4/2/15. I want to have a very late lunch with my boss at around 5:15pm. As usual service was excellent and the food was wonderful. Mr. Owner walks in and immediately starts reprimanding his staff  over what seems to be petty items. Using choice phrases as ""are you stupid"" and ""you must be an idiot"". Upon completion of my meal as I'm walking outside. What to I see (not to my surprise) Mr. Owner sitting on the patio booth, ice cold beer in hand sitting across one of his staff members loudly shouting at him regarding some sort of matter. This was just unprofessional and a disgraceful display of character. For this reason and this reason only I cannot support someone who feels THIS is how to run a business.

The wait time alone is a turn off! After placing my take out order I waited another 25 or so min before getting my order. Why did it take so long? There were no other orders for them to kick out because there was barely anyone there when I arrived and everyone seated at booths were already eating.

When I finally got my food and took it home, I realized that they hadn't given me any utensils...luckily I wasn't trying to eat in the car or something otherwise I would've been screwed. I had ordered a half chicken w/ mashed potatoes and a chicken cobb salad w/ blue cheese. The half chicken were tiny pieces and there were only 3 of them instead of 4. Is the wing not considered part of one half of a chicken? Because I didn't get one. The mashed potatoes were garbage and had no taste to it even though it was smothered in gravy. The cobb salad ironically looked much larger than the half chicken, but I had gotten it for the gf. Maybe I should've gotten 2 salads since both meals were about the same price at $9-10 each.

If the half chicken meals are this small I could eat 2 chickens then. Crazy! If they were going to half ass my meal then they should've gotten the order out sooner! Any other chicken restaurant out there would probably be better than this place!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,3,2,2,ka8eGaJCEnHy1ue180g0Ag

I go through cravings, and when it's for chicken I really like their grilled chicken (they also got rotisserie style). I really like it's flavoring, I believe it's mediterainian type seasoning.

Also, recently, I started trying their grilled pork ribs, and I really like them and have been on a steady crave for those the last few times I've been there. They serve them dry with the sauce on the side. And I like this. If your dry rub is good, then you shouldn't have to smother your ribs in bbq sauce.

I've seen a bunch of bad reviews here on Yelp, and I will say they have their bad days (or orders). In my experience, every 6th order is fudged a bit. They need to clean this up and become more consistent. But the place is always crowded...I guess by people who don't post on Yelp!

But I want more places like this. Where else can you get freshly grilled or rotisserie chickens other than the supermarket? And the quality and taste is much better than the market - although almost double the price ($5 market, $9 at NCC).

I wish there was a place like this in Henderson, near my work, as it would be perfect for my lunch needs (fresh meat, no carbs - unless you splurge on sides).",LL6Ao1JidSt_jYCSPpzZOw,0,0,4,BNORQeN91dHLXeUViFx1FA

I know the hour was late but if your business advertises that it's open until a specific hour, then it should still serve you or have some options available to customers.  Being turned away is the worst feeling, and should never have happened.

Ok so we walk in and that awesome grilled meat smell is in the air. On the outside you see a BBQ grill. Normal gas looking grill, back is surrounded by a brick wall. Lots of outside seating. Inside to the left behind glass you can see someone chopping up raw chicken. Directly in front is what I want to call a tiny salsa bar. It has a cucumber pico salsa, mild salsa, garlic ranch, limes, 3 bottles of BBQ sauce and some bottles of hot sauce. Next to that cart is the soda fountain with Pepsi products. Then it has a line that says enter here. You walk and see on the other side of the glass the sides. You get to the register and order at the end. They give you a number and you sit down. 

Our experience: the place was empty except for 2 tables had people there. We go to order and waited 5 minutes for someone to come. Two workers behind the counter were mopping and could care less if we were there. We were about to leave when this guy ceasars from on the tables to help us. Serious? This place needs a class in customer service! We asked about the sides if they were home made. He said yes, and raved how flavorful they were. I got the chicken breast, wing, 1/4 rib combo. Came with a side and a drink. My friend got the dark meat combo and an extra side. Luckily we had a coupon because that was $28. Our coupon brought it down to $21. 

The food: no meat on the chicken wing, the chicken breast (attached to the wing still) was small was flavorful tasted like rotisserie chicken. The pork ribs were ok, had a good BBQ roasted flavor.  No BBQ on the meat. I didn't taste a flavor of a spice rub either. So maybe the were salt and peppered. The combos came with a little salad and one flour tortilla. For my side I got mashed potatoes and gravy. There was barely any gravy on the potatoes. But they tasted the best compared to my friend's mac n cheese that had less flavor than Kraft Mac n cheese.  It was really bland and not cheesy. Her other side was potato salad. She said it had way too much onion in it that all she could taste was the onion flavor. The BBQ in the bottles that aren't even marked BBQ are really sweet. You don't get any bold flavor or smokiness. 

I might give them a second shot on a salad looks like they have tons of ingredients to choose from.",KMddoqBFJ2h9AYbaetprFg,3,0,2,cVrMrFnug3RFrkctD6KPWw

I ordered the 1/4 Ribs n Chicken Combo (St Louis Style Ribs, 1 Wing and Thigh, a choice of 1 side, and a drink), which came out to 12 and some change. The ribs were pretty good. Had a dry rub and good smoke flavor to it. The chicken had good flavor but was a bit dry. I chose sauteed vegetables as my one side which was a mixture of broccoli, green beans, carrots, cauliflower, and green peppers.

There is a ""Salsa"" bar towards the back where you can get garlic ranch sauce, hot sauce, salsa verde, and pico de gallo. Now the pico degallo was a bit weird. They put little pieces of cut up cucumber. Never seen that in a pico de gallo  before.

As far as service goes, when you order for dine in they give you a number to put on your table and then they bring it out to you. That is pretty much all the service that you are gonna get.

Overall, everything was decent except for their dry chicken. Come on man! Anytime you have the word ""Chicken"" in the name of your restaurant, that should be the best item that you serve.

Had three hours to spare before I can get our room at a local casino. Needed to find a place to eat with a outdoor patio for our little pet. I was just driving by and seen some people eating outside.
So we stopped by, i asked if we can eat outside with our little dog. No Problem they replied!

Now to the food,
They had a pretty good size menu with many options. I had the quarter mesquite chicken white meat with black beans.
It was really good, it was a perfect portion. Chicken had great flavor and the beans were great. I also had a salad with it, that was also good. 
My mom had some Waldorf chicken wrap. She loved it. This was really big, she also had the mac and cheese for her side dish which she also enjoyed. But the wrap she could not stop talking about. Going off my memory, this wrap had chicken, apples, walnuts, blue cheese, and many other things.

How can I start describing my experience at Nevada Chicken Cafe another way? It's just not possible! I first went there because I thought that a chicken wearing sun glasses in their logo was too bad ass for me not to try that place. Surprisingly, their chicken was hands down the best chicken I've ever tried! Hey, I been in Hawaii and their chicken wasn't as good as Nevada Chicken Cafe, so yeah here we go.

Nevada Chicken Cafe also offers you a healthy and fresh selection of vegetables, salads, druids and drinks! Of course their main dish is their Chicken, but you can also enjoy amazing pork and cow ribs! Particularly, I like to order their weekly selected combination combos that allows you to try both Chicken and ribs at a discounted price. 

My favorite dis as Nevada Chicken Cafe is their 1/2 chicken & 1/4 pork ribs with a cucumber salad on the side, you shall also order their house sauce! Please let me know if you liked this dish because I'm just in love with it!!! If you like my review hit that like button and go get your bad ass Chicken!

3203648,2011-07-09,18,2dCnTMv3Hh-fM8bOjYS4Xw,"Rex is sentimental...if nothing else. Which of course as you know...makes Rex nothing else. One thing Rex loves is when old friends meet new friends.  Old Friend, sleeping off a bleach/ammonia high in a dumpster...meet New Friend...waking in the dumpster and finding an unused Groupon coupon. The sun was hot. The dumpster, or as I calling my ""mobile home"", was even hotter. The bad thing about ""mobile homes"" is that they are dirty, lumpy and usually smell like Kirstie Alley's bellybutton. The good thing is that sometimes you can meet someone and have a little...rendezvous. Guys...and I guess girls...if you meet a girl in a dumpster...there is a very good chance she is dead or easy...or both. Sometimes you might be tempted to hang in there if you realize that you are sharing it with a hooker who has a hacking cough. Don't. There are plenty of ""mobile homes"" out there.  TB and an empty wallet sucks.

So obviously some rich bastard who has things like a home, indoor plumbing and a vacuum that will vacuum the floors on its own just through out this little piece of gold like he does his underwear with holes in it. (which by the way...found a ""gently"" used pair of underwear. nice.)  Anyway, I was able to purchase 20 dollars of food from the Nevada Chicken Cafe. I started off on my long walk to what could potentially be...chicken nirvana.  I was about 2.3 miles away.  I got there 5 days later. It all started when I tried to walk an old lady across the street...and then...well...lets just say that it went wrong.  I did think that Scottsdale was nice.

When I did arrive at the Nevada Chicken Cafe, a lovely Dutchman pulled me the last 30 miles on a sled. (Long story...but you will always pay your debts to Rex...and Rex knows his Mel's Diner trivia.)  When Rex pulled up he was immediately struck by the smell. It was amazing. They had an outside grill/smoker going on and it was impressive. The chicken, ribs, spices, mesquite, all made me want to go in and order as much as I could. 

Rex forced the Dutchman to order one whole chicken, one half chicken, a side of salad and it came with some BBQ sauce and tortillas. The tortillas were gratis. Gracias for the gratis. Rex found an empty mobile home and sat down with my feast. I was starving. Grave robbing is a lot more difficult than you would think. What is even more difficult is finding a landlord that will take a burial dress and skull in lieu of payment. Trust me...in Scottsdale no one has the kind of loot Princess Diana's had...not that Rex would know...anyway...

...for the equivalent of 21.50 Rex was well fed. Rex fed well for 2 meals.  The chicken was excellent. The mesquite was subtle but flavorful. It didn't overpower the meat and was really good. The BBQ sauce is exceptional. Rex doesn't like an overly sweet sauce and this one isn't. It is well balanced and not too overpowering on the chicken. it works with the plain chicken better than the mesquite rubbed.  Rex was so impressed he has gone back several times and tried the ribs and some other sides.  The baby back ribs are among the best ribs in Las Vegas. They are fall off the bone and the extremely flavorful.  The St. Louis ribs are good, but they aren't great. Rex didn't love that it wasn't sauced enough. The sauce is sweeter and that is fine, but St. Louis ribs should be HEAVILY sauced...and these aren't. 

The chicken...well...when done right it is the best. It is a excellent piece of chicken. The problem is that there is no consistency. Rex has had dry pieces and he has had perfect pieces...and this is a MAJOR issue. If you are only doing a few things they have to be perfect. In fairness I have had more good than bad...but I have had enough bad to not necessarily want the crap shoot when I am paying good grave robbing money. 

The sides are were everything falls apart.  The Mac and Cheese...and Rex loves the mac and cheese...isn't good. Under seasoned (the only thing that is), and mash potatoes are so peppery it is of the charts. Rex loves pepper. He would roll himself in pepper and find a nice salt covered girl to mix with...but this is too much pepper. The fruit salad wasn't cleaned as well (the tough pieces) as it should be, and the mixed veggies were okay, but nothing great.  The black beans were okay, but again nothing to write home about and didn't taste like they were simmered in a rich enough stock. The sweet potatoes were a real stand out and should be eaten as the side. 

A huge special shout out for the garlic ranch sauce...get a few tubs of it. perfect with the chicken and the salad. Amazing taste. 

Rex has dated his fair share of unstable women. It adds a little spice. A little mystery. A little arousal. Eventually no matter how good post release from jail sex can be...it is time to go.  In his eateries Rex demands stability. Consistency. Reliability. Excellence. Rex is all of those things and more.

Spend your money and time on a shrine to Rex. He will spend his money on gas and whores.",jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ,11,11,2,_vGuJmjvn6r3aNjjXk3yHw

I wasn't in the mood for ribs even though that's what everyone told me to get. I saw a lot of people on yelp say chicken was dry...they offer grilled or rotisserie. I asked the girl at the counter what was best for juicy. She said the rotisserie was juicier because skin holds in moisture better. Sounded good to me so hubby and I ordered 1/2 chicken, paid $3 more for white meat. Added three sides for $8 - Mac n cheese, mashed potatoes gravy and black beans. With coupon total was $11.99.

Delivered to our table in less than five min. Chicken was hot & juicy and cooked to perfection. Sauce choices were limited to two: BBQ or hot. Tried BBQ which was just okay. Sides were hot and tasted good. Mashed potatoes had skins in it and gravy was okay so I probably won't order again. If you like white mild cheese then you will love the macaroni n cheese ( I'm a sharp cheddar girl myself). Black beans were excellent! Our meal came with two warm tortillas and a small vinaigrette salad which was a nice surprise.

I am giving this review four stars today subject to change based on my next visit. It is clean, cute, TVs are a nice touch. I hope the owner adds more sauce and spice choices easily ready at tables. I look forward to ribs, broccoli salad and pulled pork sandwiches in my future here. It's way better than fast food.

Tonight, I finally decided to drop in -- this is one of those reviews for me that is hard to write. I know a person's review is their own opinion but I try to always be fair about the things that I write.

When I walked in I was surprised to see a fast food like environment. I wanted to try both the chicken and the ribs, so she sold me a ""combination plate"" this consisted of one small piece of chicken. I requested White meat, three small ribs a childlike side dish -- I chose the chicken pasta a very small salad and a small beverage.

I would rate the food as ""good"" but not worth the cost; especially for the portion size provided. I initially ordered my meal to be consumed in a restaurant. Within five minutes of my food being delivered, they got a rush of people in. The place is too small to have any kind of comfort while eating. I then asked for a to go box.

Will I go back? MAYBE... I know that at those prices, it can't be a regular place to dine. Three or four times a year perhaps. It will definitely be take out though.",8hDnAB36ePyQfgHTBdd0_Q,1,1,3,OzrQbEM-Cbkf8_ZptyRiWQ

I feel like this was such a missed opportunity for the cashier to give suggestion and guide me through the menu but he was to busy watching the football game on the tv to care about my experience. 


I ended up ordering one piece of roasted chicken and one piece smoked. The smoked chicken was better than the roasted but both were nothing special to me. I also had a side of Mac and cheese and a side of fruit. The mixed fruit was well fruit so I can't complain. The Mac and cheese was not good to me at all.

Well I can say that we were happy and enjoyed our meal. We had full rack of ribs, whole chicken, mac n cheese, garlic roasted potatoes, and mashed potatoes and gravy. The kids loved the sides. Me and hubby not so much...but the chicken and ribs were great. They seasoning on the meat was great. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I wanted to try the wings but they were out and wouldn't have them made for one hour.

They offer chicken platters ranging from whole toasted chicken to single pieces of legs thighs and more, they have wraps, salads and more. Almost all dishes come with at least one side dish which are all very yummy with a large variety from healthy fruit to heavy Mac and cheese or potato's.

I have been going to Nevada Chicken Cafe for over 8 years.. almost daily when I lived in the area up until 2012...
I just got into Vegas on business this week.. after over 3 years away and yearning for the sensational taste of the Mesquite BBQ Chicken and Ribs.. and my ""custom side dish"" (combination of Sweet Potato and Saffron Rice)...
Actually... I found the place has had a full face lift.. with major improvements to the patio, and the parking lot.. AWESOME.. As well as a revised interior seating and ordering area.. all great upgrades that provide an extremely family friendly environment from the seating to the order menus to the well uniformed and informed STAFF... i NOTICED AND REMEMBERED THAT MOST OF THE STAFF ON DUTY WERE THE SAME CREW FROM YEARS AGO!!! That alone speaks for the consistency of the restaurant performance and ownership.
New cooking equipment... especially a rotisserie type BBQ for the ribs.. resulted in even MORE JUICY AND TASTY RIBS.  The chicken was well cooked and Juicy at the same time... 
The custom side I love so much and have had sooooo many times in the past WAS EVEN BETTER THAN I REMEMBER IT!!!

For some reason the chicken tasted dehyrdated.  Like they were made with the intent of it being completely well done and then sat around while you prepared another dish.  The rice was plain and good, and the salad was about the size that Las Vegas Grille serves, good to-go box size full.  

I should have tried the 1/4 rib combo that came with a breast and wing, 1 side, and drink but I'll save that for next time.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,2,0,3,bKcMZqBbhnQwKJ-2vFxTwQ

Unfortunately, Nevada Chicken Cafe doesn't hold a candle to Chicken Dijon. I ordered the chicken cesaer wrap, and the meat was pretty dry and it kind of grossed me out. The whole thing fell apart the second I took it out on my desk so I ate it with a fork-- not very wrap-esque.

It was about 4pm and we were going for a very late lunch/early dinner. 

Facility: it's pretty small, only about 5 booths and 5 tables. It was cool you can see where they prepare the chicken and ribs through the window. It's got a fast food feel, but with better food. 

Service: You order your food at the counter and the give you a number. They bring it to your table. The guy that helped us was friendly and answered all our questions. However, we stood at the counter a few minutes waiting for him to finish mopping. 

Food:  I got the combo with dark meat chicken, ribs, and 1 side for $11.99. The CHICKEN (3.5/5) was good. It had a nice mesquite flavor and the meat was moist. Felt like it was missing something though. I pulled it off, wrapped it in the tortilla, added salsa, pico and some SALAD (4/5) off my plate. I liked that. I loved the PICO (5/5) because it was tart and it had cucumber in it. The SALSA (3/5) was good and spicy. 
RIBS (4/5) were good. Again, loved the mesquite flavor. I added the BBQ SAUCE (2.5/5), and not a huge fan. It was just too sweet for me. They need a second sauce that is savory and spicy. I ordered the POTATO SALAD (3/5) that wasn't bad, but not a fan of the onions in it. I got an extra side of MACARONI AND CHEESE (3/5) which was also decent, but needs some salt. 

Overall: (3/5) I liked it, but didn't LOVE it. I would come back, but not waiting in a long line. I liked the meat, but the sides were just ok. To me, the best BBQ is good meat and good sides too!!!!  So, this was just ok.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,2,2,3,rjZpnznCXVAOdYa_lTXi6g

   Last time we ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich the coleslaw came on the side, so we were expecting the same this time but sadly it was put on the sandwich, which the person who it was for was not too happy about.
  I had asked for extra dressing on the side for my wrap only to find out when we got the food back to work it was not included. Which was a bummer because the wrap itself was actually quite dry and the avocado was not ripe enough. The side of macaroni and cheese was just mediocre at best.
  The ribs are really tasty, but a little bit on the pricey side, and honestly the only thing I thing that really shined were their mashed potatoes, they were delicious!

I liked how they had a self-serve condiment stand which everything was made fresh; garlic ranch, hot sauce, bbq sauce. The mac and cheese was awesome, I love gooey mac and cheese and the combination of cheese they use was great. I don't advise the Spinach Feta Pasta though, it was pretty bland but anything can be great with ranch or hot sauce.

He's the chicken man so we went to a place that specializes in the cluckins. 

Got a breast and wing with a side of saffron rice....they gave me an extra chicken piece so thats always nice! It wasn't that the chicken was bad, but it wasn't even warm which makes me think it's been sitting a while and they didn't bother to throw it into the heat even a little.It wasn't dry, but it wasn't juicy either. It made me sad specially since theres a guy in the front grilling these things....why didn't I get a hot one? That was what made me excited to try this place was the smoke I saw coming from it....my chicken did hit the smoke- but hours ago. Saffron rice has buttery and good. Got a watermelon drink and it wasn't very cold and it needed more sugar to contrast how sometimes watermelon gets that ""green"" taste to it. 

They have a sauce station with ketchup, bbq sauce, Red Hot sauce and then a garlic sauce, green salsa, a cucumber salad/salsa, jalapenos and baby peppers.

The garlic sauce was more garlic ranch like dressing, but it worked with the meat...I still prefer the real deal garlic sauce a la Zankou chicken. Cucumber salad was a good cooldown since I was eating the peppers and it got a bit hot.

The chicken was the star and without hot and juicy chicken, it can only be an OK lunch at best. I'll try again to see if I can make sure I get one piping hot, but if I can't then I'll have to bawk bawk away and find me some hot cluckin lovin' elsewhere.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,4,3,j8O4n4vvCDAHbMvNUAaWnA

So we've been wanting to come here for ages because of the smoke and the awesome smell it produced. Located on Sahara next to the Chevron gas station, the Plaza has plenty of parking. Interior is a cute cafe style setup with booths and 7 individual tables that seat 2 people. There is a subway style counter top where you pick your sides. Buy it's not about the sides here, it's called Nevada chicken cafe, so it's all about the pollo, right?!

NOPE!!!

It's all about the sauces. 

1. Dry chicken.
2. SKINNY Chicken
3. Dry chicken.
4. Very skinny chicken. 

Lololol..

For years and years we thought this would be the spot to beat. So so so disappointed. El pollo Loco has juicier fatter, in fact Popeys  (next door) has healthier chicken than here.  Like I did mention though, the sauces are good. Garlic ranch and the salsa flavors to be exact. Mama Belle and my wife agreed, without them it would be a total loss. 

WHY AM I STILL HUNGRY!!!?? 

As for customer service, the staff seems friendly. Saying seems because the only person who spoke to us was the cashier. 2 employees were eating at customer designated tables, which they shouldnt. SMILE PEOPLE!!!! Shoots, at least pretend your happy you have a job! But that is not my business. Pretty clean inside the cafe. The smell is amazing but very VERY deceiving.

The place was slamming packed at noon on a Saturday so I figured that's a good sign.

I Had the whole cut chicken with mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese to go.

...Chicken was on the dry side which has been mentioned in a lot of reviews...so I almost kind of expected it. It did have a nice flavor though...maybe they intentionally overcook the chicken due to fear from a salmonella outbreak and don't want to end up closed like Fire Fly. 

***The fact that you can get an equally delicious full roasted chicken hot and fresh from Walmart, Smith's, Sam's Club, etc...for like $6...take it home and have it hot and MOIST is where I really struggle to find the value in the meal I ate had I not had the discount. $21.50 for dry chicken...I would have been pissed without the $10 off.

The macaroni and cheese was average but the mashed potatoes were really good. They still had bits of the red peel from the potato and it was flavored well with a delicious gravy...that was probably the highlight of the meal. 

They included 2 tortilla skins and I couldn't figure out what I was to do with them. I know Pollo Tropical has the salsa bar to go with the tortilla but when I waited for my order I sat in front of the TV and watched some NBA playoffs...perhaps it was in the back and I didn't notice.

The employees seemed less than thrilled to be working, soda machine had no ice, condiments were in 2"" of ice water, and the temperature inside was not tolerable just so many things that were weird.

Took the combo selection of ribs and chicken with bbq beans. The ribs were a that of a boiled mess with some seasoning spattered on it, not tender and tasteless. The chicken had the same seasoning on it and was as dry as the desert heat outside. All served with a mini salad on the side.

5466073,2009-07-08,5,2dCnTMv3Hh-fM8bOjYS4Xw,"I drove by this place for ages, always wondering what the food tasted like, and more than a little entranced by their giant inflatable chicken man that would shill on their roof or on the sidewalk next to the chicken cafe.  

I'm not going to lie: Every time I drove by, I've secretly hoped that Peter Griffin from ""The Family Guy"" would run out of nowhere, and the two would engage in epic fisticuffs for my own amusement (or to make my time at the stop light go by faster).

Regardless of my dreams unrealized, I decided to break down and actually go into this place.  I'm glad that I did.

You'll see the little man grilling to his heart's content when you first walk up, and he'll cheerfully wave while you smell the chicken and ribs cooking.  The entry door's a little tricky to find (it's at the far left), but inside, it is a veritable mecca of chicken.

And it's good.  The side dishes are no slouch, either, all filled with fresh veggie goodness, and your choice or light or dark meat, chicken or ribs, and it's certainly filling.  The mashed potatoes were especially notable, and while I haven't gone the rib route, the chicken is flavorful.

It's usually around a $10 meal (perhaps a little less), so if on a tight budget, it may not be a ""cheap"" dining alternative.  However, the food is fast, it's grilled right in front of you, and it's tasty.

Now when I drive past, I see the little grill man and the inflatable chicken, and will be tempted to go in at times, and occasionally act on that urge.  While I still wait for my inevitable ""Peter Griffin Vs. Giant Chicken"" fight, at least the food is good enough to pass the time until that eventual reward.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,2,1,4,rlI44USYl4cTtOhZT8MnPQ

I wish I would have taken the move on advice in this case. 

I suggested we order lunch from this place for work and we passed the menu around in amazement at all of the option that we had and the ordering began. Once lunch was picked up and brought back we all quickly dug in and then we all quickly stopped digging in. There was a mix of things ordered, Chicken Wraps, 3 piece plates, and sides like mac and cheese and ceaser salads.

I am not overly picky but I will say the chicken in my wrap was EXTREMELY dry and there was absolutely no flavor to the entire wrap. The coworker to my right stopped eating his plain chicken and cheese wrap after he pulled 4 bones out of it and to top it off, one of my other co workers could not stand to eat his mac and cheese because it was so runny..

Unfortunately I messed up and while ordering online I somehow ended up with vegan wrap super disappointing since their chicken is so delicious. I ruined my dinner plans thinking that while ordering from a ""chicken"" place that their wraps would include chicken. 

Under the make your own wrap category there is no option to ""add chicken"" so I thought that would mean it's already included. Little did I know that I needed to write add chicken is the special options box which is usually used for items like no onion or whatever. 

I called and explained my issue to the store and although the person on the phone was nice she was unhelpful by just telling me I needed to know that chicken is always extra. 

It's a f@$king chicken restaurant, why would chicken be extra! 

I'll give you guys another try but I probably won't ever attempt to order a wrap again. What a waste of my time. And now I'm hungry and have a stupid veggie wrap I spent 24$ on",7HlyV5UG2iNniOkfduGHsg,0,0,3,5KVTXz1U-ZZgp8tVFVNQFg

Unfortunately, it seems like this location has become the mecca for lunch because the line to order was super long, and only one person taking the orders. After about 15 minutes in line, I placed the order to go and just had a seat off to the side, but then it was another 15+ minutes to get my order and for a to-go-order this is simply too long in my book. 

While the food is good and the reason why it has become more busy and a noticeable change in the menus, again, it has been a while since I have been here so maybe the menu was updated long ago, I feel the Nevada Chicken Cafe has lost some of its good old fashion edge.
