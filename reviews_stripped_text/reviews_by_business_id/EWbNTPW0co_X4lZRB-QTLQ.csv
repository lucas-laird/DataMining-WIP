Two women were belting out Lady Gaga over the karaoke machine, with the rest of the party singing along.  Be warned.

Ordered Tom Kha and Chicken larb. The larb was okay.  As for the former, the reviews below are right: something is up with the Tom Kha soup. There's an odd nuttiness--almost like peanut butter--in the soup that clashes with both the coconut and any heat in the soup.  More positively, the tofu in the soup was fine, and there were a good amount of mushrooms.  

Not sure I'll go back. Feeling scarred by the karaoke and confused by the Tom Kha.",ivCQ6oLaalsmZvytynCelw,0,0,3,66p-uY-DPguOVGyEzHwPiA

As for the food, we ordered the Thai Papaya Salad, Pad Thai with Beef, and Red Curry with Chicken (~$29 total) as take-out. I really was expecting mediocre or worse. However, it was better than I expected. Granted it wasn't the best I've ever tasted. But, it you're looking for some reasonably priced Thai food near the Strip, this is a good place to check out. General flavors were there. The papaya salad had good flavor and kick, though a bit on the soggy side, which might have been due to the time between cooking and consumption for take-out.",FJy6BVYJt0hErGnKaEv4uA,2,1,4,-TUEFpCrY7ctTqqJ9RlITg

I know Thai food well. 

- Food: Very Authentic, good taste just like when I go to Thailand. Cant get better than that. Of course this is with some dishes, not everything or all the time. Depends on the chef probably. 

- Sanitation: Reminds me of Thailand as well...Dirty. Not American Standard. But they are downtown. But I go there for the food. I was street raised, so don't mind eating ghetto styles. 

- Atmosphere: Not really authentic, just a place, with tables, a TV and Chairs. What evs 

- Overall: When I visit, I make it my business to visit and get food. I take food home for my friends mom, who happens to know Thai flavors more than me, considering my friends Mother, Grand and Great Grandmother all once worked at the Royal Palace in Thailand as food preps.

Planned to walk back to my hotel but the area is really iffy so decided that might not be a great idea.  Uber back it will be.

Ocha is lacking atmosphere and I was immediately greeted with my pet peeve of a blasting large screen T.V.  This is definitely not a fine dining establishment.  Service was fine, no complaints, nothing fantastic either.

I ordered the chicken chow mein lunch specials for $6.95.  I heard my lunch sizzling in the kitchen and I knew it would be good.  Their version of chicken chow mein reminded me of a Chinese chicken and vegetables in a light brown sauce.  It was served with rice and a pile of yummy lo mein type noodles.  Plenty of fresh vegetables and chicken.  No skimping on the protein, even at the great lunch special price.  My entree was truly outstanding.  Very well flavored and cooked.

The lunch special was served with a spring roll.  The spring roll was cold but still good and an egg drop soup that wasn't much one way or the other.

Overall I'm a bit conflicted with this place.  The food is really good but the overall atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired.  I tend to go for the more elegant places but sometimes you just want a quickie and a beer, right?",P4lN2my6anb7U8Z6s8t5qA,2,1,4,Z0Xb_wlVbxlptO-OAfc-6w

We have only used them three times for delivery so I can not speak to if the place is nice.

They deliver VERY QUICKLY via EAT24 and they are always super nice upon arrival!

They do not have a set veggie menu so you will just have to type out your special requests on each menu item.

After a hard day of riding (scooters), we dialed up this place on the Yelp app and decided to give it a go.

I ordered the Thai beef jerky (awesome!) and the beef Pad Kee Mao (not on the menu, but most true Thai places know how to make it...plus it was hilarious to hear the cook yell, ""PAD KEE MAO!!!!!"" in the kitchen).    As to why such a fantastic dish as the Pad Kee Mao was and still wasn't on the menu (as far as I could see), I'll never understand.

Anyway, huge portions, great food, good prices, def worth the short cab (or scooter) ride up the strip for when your looking for something more than fancy microwaved dishes with some Food Network chef's name attached to them or feeding troth buffet that litter the Vegas strip.

The good:
+ friendly, attentive staff
+ took special orders (PAD KEE MAO!)
+ great quantity and taste for the money

The not-so-good:
- a little ways north of most of the major casinos on the LVS
- sign is hard to see at night, as it is lost against the barrage of other signs it must compete with",5q86YD6uc7AnbttrFrbKPA,0,0,4,TUAYr-4cWiv5skcb__CeLw

We went here one night about a decade ago because we heard tell that someone would let us sing karaoke.  So we showed up, and the entire restaurant was filled with Thai people.  Yes, there was karaoke, but there was also the opportunity to try some authentic Thai food that was obviously really good. I started trying all different things: pad thai, chicken satay, tom yum soup, thai fried shrimp, curries, etc.  All of it is great and has been consistently great for years.

It ain't fancy, and it ain't in a good neighborhood.  If you're trying to impress someone with a posh place, this isn't where to go.  But if you're trying to impress someone with good food, it ain't a bad choice at all.

2621898,2010-11-09,0,EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ,"We went here for lunch today, and had high hopes.  Unfortunately, I wouldn't say that Ocha is one of the better Thai restaurants in Vegas.  They seem to get a lot of business from tourists and businesses in the area.  So, why change to be authentic?  We ordered the tom kha khi, pad see ew (on the menu as something else), shrimp with pepper sauce, and beef panang.  

We liked the pad see ew the best.  Of course, this is a hard dish to mess up.  One thing that stood out was the quality of the chicken.  They gave us nice big chunks, and some of it was dark meet seemingly straight from the bone rather than thawed from a package of chicken meat.  The Chinese broccoli was also fresh, thick and lots of with stems.  The sauce was a little on the weaker side, and although the dish was good, this ""weaker"" attribute seemed to be the theme of the food here.

The tom kha khi was disappointing.  I even ordered it extra sour and medium spice, and it still came out bland.  There was no galanga or lemongrass chunks.  It had the floating spice that LoS and Komol are famous for.  Appearances don't fool the taste buds though.  The chicken was the only great part about this dish; again huge chunks that seemed to have been pulled off of a whole chicken.  

The beef panang was very sweet.  In fact, I don't think I have ever had a beef panang this sweet before.  I think that it could have been a decent panang if it weren't for this.  

Overall, I am giving Ocha a 3 star review because their ingredients are good, especially their meat. However, their style is definitely dumbed down for the average person.  This makes sense considering their location, but overall this was a disappointing experience for me.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,0,0,3,ioxIVXeEi1Sz-QtetzSWRw

Buyer beware! We were fed the old bait and switch and played for fools. On the menu cover, they write something along the lines about their pricing is subject to change at any time. Yeah, they take advantage of playing the price game and being dishonest with their customers. Also some of the menu items such as pompano say market price. Why?! Pompano is not in any way special or luxurious!  Shady. This place is a dump and overpriced for no reason.

The service was horrendous and a good indicator that the rest of the evening was going to fail miserably. 

Our waitress did not have any business working as a server at a restaurant, matter of fact, she didn't have any general training. Her superior was just as clueless and not a joy to interact with. We received half-assery all around.

Other than the break in communication, (which isn't a problem at all) we felt that our waitress used language as a barrier to withhold pertinent information about menu items and pricing. She played the dumb card. 

To summarize the betrayal: I ordered the $13 catfish in spicy sauce, she takes the order & the menus, goes back to the kitchen, then comes back up to tell me they ran out of the catfish and if I would like to swap it with the pompano fish? I was unsure at first, but she assured me it was the same exact dish, but with pompano fish instead. Fine, I decide to go for it. Little did I know, the pompano is doubled in price. It went from $13 to (market price) $26!!! She never disclosed this to me, at any time. It wasn't a swap, it was never a swap. She ordered the $26 pompano fish, which was not the $13 catfish in spicy sauce I had originally ordered. Highway robbery!

We went to dispute the charge and they said that's the price on the menu and thats what we agreed to order. That's funny!...she took the menu after I originally ordered the $13 catfish. She comes back to tell me they only have pompano if it's ok the swap the fish. Never showing me the menu again or disclosing it's doubled in price. Apparently I'm the idiot prisoner; apparently I needed to ask her if the price was the same or if it doubled?

That's so screwed up. The worst part was all the food we tried was all half ass, super basic. The beef in the panang curry and pad see ew were paper thin, overcooked, hard, dried out and chewy. We also tried the Thai beef jerky (which I would rather eat a slim-jim) sucked. Nothing wowed any of us.

I ordered at level 7 for spiciness because i like it spicy. When the food came out she brought some spice on the side said here add it your self maybe because i am white they didnt think i could handle spicy food.

Every time we come in we get what they call ""the crying tiger"". It's steak on a bed of lettuce that comes out with these 2 sauces. The sauces are the highlighters! This is why you cry when u eat this dish. Lol it is spicer then anything but it's also extra delicious so you just can't get enough of it! One sauce is red (my favorite) and one is green (burns your whole mouth). I honestly love spicy foods but the green sauce might just be my limit! 

The dish comes out with rice. I usually make like a little lettuce wrap with it. You can just dip the meat in the sauce and eat it with rice. Which ever way.. It's extra delicious. Also you can substitute the meat with chicken which is what my beau does because he's on a diet and can only eat chicken. But if you want chicken breast you have to call ahead and check if they have it because they don't always carry chicken breast. But either way it's still bomb.

I've also had the chicken Pad Thai which was amazing as well. I actually ate the whole dish by myself which NEVER happens! Lol 

The staff are really attentive and nice. They make sure they come and talk to us and converse. Waters are always full. And one time one of the species took over my throat and I was coughing up a storm and they Gave me a free Thai tea! Which actually helped with the heat.

I was sorely disappointed when I came back to have lunch at Ocha with my niece on August 25th.  This spot used to be my favorite Thai/Lao restaurant.

When we first walked in, I could pretty much tell that something had changed, but I didn't want to assume anything and just sat down any way.

The guy who sat us was rude and loud.  He was on the phone almost the entire time when we were dining in and I could hear everything he was saying, and this restaurant is pretty darn big.

We ordered my usual: beef salad, papaya salad and esarn sausage with sticky rice.

The beef salad was dry and flavorless, yet sour so it was hard to enjoy with our rice.

The papaya salad was also sour.

The only good thing were the sausages, but that comes from a package from a well known vendor so it tastes the same everywhere.

The waitress was the only reason why this place even got a 2-star.  She was very friendly and accommodating.  When I asked her if the place was under new management, she said yes and asked if the food was ok.  I told her the truth and she was very receptive of my complaints and said she would let the owner know.

Will I be back?  Most likely not...",Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg,24,23,2,M-y7adIszE-uZUNWYt2BkA

Id recommend this place as a nice sit down restaurant that also offers to go and they are also open late!! :D

I usually order Shrimp Pad Thai, Combination fried rice, and Tom Yum soup.

Their service is pretty good exept for this old lady with curly reddish brown hair who doesn't understand english that well, and she gives you attitude. And bad customer service skills.

Heres the story of my bad experience at ocha's 

Okay so i decided to take my cousins out to eat some good food because we were all hungry. So I decided to treat them to a nice dinner at Ochas. We get the the location of 2211 S. Las Vegas Blvd. and there's no resturant there. They relocated to 1201 S Las vegas Blvd. which is a short drive up the street. We get there and we get seated into a small table me and my cousins were bumping our elbows to each other every so often and our waitress is a older woman with curly reddish brown hair she has a strong accent and we struggled to communicate with her. She seemed to come off as a tad rude and grumpy.  I ordered four Shrimp pad thai's  a combination fried rice and four thai teas for our dinner, I wanted to take some food home so I told the lady that I was also going to order a combination fried rice to go, but not right now after we all finish our food I will order it. She nodded as if she understood and walked away. 

   The food took about 5-8 mins to come out which is average and not long at all we were happy because we were hungry :D.  As she was placing our food around the table she also brought with her a bag with  a container full of the combination fried rice. She placed it on the table and Walked away. I look at the box and said ""excuse me,"" she kept walking away so I got up and walked to her with the bag and container of food and explained to her that I didn't want the combination fried rice right now that I was going to order it once we finished. She looked at me for a while as if she was annoyed and said, ""well the food is already cooked,"" I responded with, ""well I would like my food at the end after we finish eating,"" she took it and we went our ways me to my table and her to the counter behind the register.  I went back to my table and even asked my cousins, ""didn't i tell her i wanted my to go order after we finish eating?"" they responded with agreement and they also pointed out that she was giving me attitude. I like to give the benefit of a doubt but I also noticed the attitude. 

We begin eating and it taste soo good OMG so good D: ahhhh!!   :@ cant stop eating until the food is gone :c and our tummy's full xD

But we rushed through eating also because I figured the lady wouldn't remake the food that she mistakenly given us too early so it was just sitting there getting cold.  So we finished our food and it was really good. We got full and I got the bill it came out to around $60 bucks So i went up and payed And the lady reaches around the counter and gives me the bag with the container of rice she didnt remake it as a predicted. I left no tip that day but i usually tip at least 20%. 

I have gone there many times after this day and also ordered over the phone to pick up some food to go. I've had one problem with ordering on the phone.  The lady on the phone was rude and kept making me repeat the order and kept cutting me off when I was talking. But when i went to go pick up the food the same grumpy old lady with Curly reddish brown hair with the strong accent was there. And yet again I left no tip. 

ThIs place has the best shrimp pad thai and thai tea that I have ever eaten. That's one of the reasons i keep going back but I will avoid that One waitress lady from now on.

Hope this review helps some of your guys out there Thanks for reading.",5-Rod5QiPuv7esGuNXuUDw,0,0,3,RI9ig3rn54WyVdWZxQpcVw

Customer service was extremely amazing. Fast and very attentive. Super polite too.

He said I had been there before even though it was my first time ever trying this place out. So my husband and I laugh it off as if he is playing mind you we have never seen this man before. So I get home and sure enough there is absolutely no shrimp in my food at all. I call and let them know there is no shrimp in my food and this same man very very rudely gets on the phone talking some nonsense of how I had been there before two weeks ago and complained about the shrimp not being in there. (Ohhh so this has happened before.) He claims he has me on video so I said ok I will come down there bring my food and you can show me the video. I get back there and he is being very rude saying he is not going to do this because I have been there before and I ask show me the video and he told me it would take hours ok why say it then. My thing is this establishment is not only rude but racist. Yes it could have been possible a woman who looks similar to me( meaning another black woman) came in and you did the same thing to her but what would be my reasoning if that was me to come back and order the same damn thing if it was a big problem the first time????

Considering Ocha is in the shadow of the Stratosphere, they might seem to be a bit of a dive, especially in comparison to other spots on the Strip. On the contrary, Ocha is clean, and their service wicked fast: we were seated, had our orders taken, and got our food before we could blink. For their speed, we never were rushed.

Everything was expertly prepared, from start to finish. We enjoyed their beef jerky appetizer ($8.95) - chunks of tender spiced beef brisket, sundried then deep-fried - as much as the sweet sauce that came on the side. Their chicken tom yum soup (8.95), flavored with mushrooms, lemongrass, chili and lime juice, helped ward off hunger.

For entrees, try their pad thai chicken (8.95), stir-fried with bean sprouts, and a lime on the side. It's slightly sweet, with a perfect, light texture. A few plates of combination (pork, chicken, beef) fried rice (9.95/plate) rounded off our meal nicely. (Somehow we ended up with sticky rice too, but I didn't try any.)

Recommended for a comfortable, affordable lunch.

Waited by the sign that said please wait to be seated for a few mins until someone noticed us and said we will be right there. Told them we had a party of 13 with 2 babies. Took them about 5 mins to get the table together. We sat down....and menus were passed out to us. The waitress then proceeded to ask if we know what we wanted to drink. Stated water all around for now, but ask where on the menu was the drinks listed. She then stated it was on the back of the menu and then left to get water for us. I kept looking on the menu for drinks and did not see a single drink item, so when the waitress came back I asked her again and she tried looking for it but it was no where to be found. Then stated they were new menus and probably forgot to print the drinks on there. So then I was like okay, can you at least tell me what you have, she kindly told me the drinks menu. Then I ordered a thai tea :)  then after we proceeded to order our food. Took awhile for food to come out but we did have a large order. When the food came out it smelt so yummy and I couldn't wait to eat. They did messed up one of my family members order, but took care of it right away. There was also a live performance that night, from one of the worker, she sang some great oldies. But anyways when the food all came out and we stated eating, the food was just okay. It didn't really hit the spot. I got the drunken noodles with beef spicy #6. But goodness it was spicy for a 6, but the good kind of spicy. Their fried rice was okay.

It was easy to find and had ample parking. We walked in to a spotless restaurant with shiny clean floors. We were greeted immediately and seated in a comfortable booth. The server came over to take our drink order and answer any questions we had. She returned a few minutes later with the drinks and took our food orders. 

The food started coming out a short time later. Presentation was on point, temperature was perfect and everything smelled delicious. A runner came by to inform us there was no yellow curry, which was disappointing. He recommended the green which was a wonderful substitute. I had also wanted Tom Yum Goong, but they only make it with chicken broth, which I cannot eat. 

The food was very good and the server checked on us at regular intervals. The only negative was the spice level scale. It is based on 1 to 10, 10 being hottest. My husband ordered 10 for himself and I ordered 4 for the dishes shared with the kids. I was caught off guard when I took a big bite of shrimp salad and my tongue was on fire. Same with the green shrimp curry. The flavors were amazing and the spice wasn't a big deal, but I'll remember to order  3 or below for the kids next time. 

Overall, we enjoyed our meal and will come back again. A family of 4 with 5 dishes( plenty to take home for lunch tomorrow), 3 Thai iced teas and 1 beer--with 18% tip around $80. Perfect!!",2-El5qA0hHX4Q67lQoP_aQ,1,0,4,vIqUkMWEU7G2Q9atxUSOHA

Upon returning recently, we've come to understand that the original owners have passed the business to a younger generation of their family. Whom is a bright young and eager businessman/ entrepreneur. With that being said he is trying to bring all the potential out of the restaurant (in which I applaud) we need more of this in Vegas. He has live entertainment every night, a new variety of cocktails, and alcoholic beverages. (I'm a bartender so this is a stamp of approval in my book!) he's also expanded the restaurant to accommodate more patrons.
 So why did I give it 3 Stars???
 I get it!! it's gonna take some time, and I will be returning with an update of my review accordingly. I love his vision! Howeverrrrr the entertainment on Monday (with all do respect!,,""Shade No Shade"") was awful, the service was not up to par, they weren't knowledgeable of the menu or beverages, and the lack of attentiveness was unpleasant.

4040072,2014-07-09,1,EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ,"Ah Yelp photos let me down. I've been searching for more of a Thai style Tom Kha Gai and I literally searched through all Yelps of the Thai places in Vegas to find one similar to Lao Thai Kitchen which changed owners.

I finally decided to try Ocha's version for lunch with some friends based on the photos I saw.

First of all the restaurant is huge. It was actually pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated promptly and there was one server. 

The price points are average for Thai food in Vegas. The dishes were on average $11-$12 which is okay. There's some cheaper places and some more expensive.

The place wasn't so nice inside as the table was all beat up with some sharp areas you'll have to be careful of.

We got pad thai which was good but nothing special. Not the best but most the worst. On the plus side it did stay nice and moist. 

We got Thai beef salad which was okay. It really just tasted like it was dressed with lime juice. It was really one note. There was pretty much just lettuce and some beef slices. 

Last we got the Tom Kha Gai. It was not good. I know that Laos and Thai people all make it different and I've had this soup many times. I've heard of the sour flavor from the soup coming from lime or tamarind. This place definitely used tamarind and it was super sour and super salty. You couldn't taste any spice just salt and sour. The portions of chicken and mushroom in here were generous though. I can't say that about the pad Thai or beef salad though.

My two positives were that they gave us a generous serving of white rice & I believe the sticky rice was on the house. That reminds me their rice was not good. Sometimes you just want plain old white rice and they definitely didn't use jasmine rice. Otherwise it was not cooked well because it was dry.

Overall our lunch kind of was lame. Service was slow as our server was pretty slammed so we were barely checked on. We also got our check super late BUT they were able to split it three ways and there wasn't a card minimum which is nice. I wouldn't recommend this place",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,2,0,2,GZlhYaaDafur3K5BZ437hg

The  space is huge, nice and airy. There is dance floor, which confirms my dance club theory, and it looks like in the evening they have karaoke. 

This is a good option if you are in the downtown area lookin for Thai food, but are not willing to go down to E. Freemont.",Se3XL5Opy0e2cHbxxjs2ZQ,2,0,4,HkVU94kdAbylvwQhNVtjhw

He had the salad of course which was just as tasty as the other Thai places we frequent. I was craving Chow mien so I ordered the lunch special that came with white rice and an egg roll. The Chow Mien was okay the noodles were a little thicker then I prefer but it still tastes great with a little Siracha. I enjoyed the egg roll because they put see through rice noodles in there. I don't see that a lot. The star of the meal was the Beef Jerky! I was hoping it wouldn't be like 7-11 beef jerky ...that would be pretty hard to eat with rice.

I love saying that in my best Bruce Lee accent (and in the most obnoxious,""I'm gonna kick your booty Muay Thai style  if I don't get it"",  way).

It's also my favorite thing to order at any given Thai restaurant. I don't eat pork or beef (as most of you already know), so of course  we ordered this one with all the seafood trimmings. I really enjoyed the delicious broth that came with this soup. The squid was rubbery and overcooked, though. Freshness in seafood are a must! Again, the broth was to die for: just the right about of savory and tangy and spicy.

Ok, so how about the the other fare?

The giant prawns were spectacular! So succulent and perfectly cooked. The Hawaiian rice was the most disappointing addition to our dinner table: greasy and underseasoned.  I took it home and ""doctored it up"" with some scallions, peas and carrots, cilantro and soy, and it became much more comestible. But why should I have to use my culinary degree for such activities when THEY cooked it?! 

The service was prompt and friendly. It's definitely not an ambiance for romance, and I highly recommend you either: A) BYOB or B)Come in already liquored up. 
Oh well, the highlight of the evening was the fabulous wine selection they had at their beer and wine only ""bar"" (Insert sarcasm here:___________).
The lady had the nerve to bring me White Zinfandale  when I asked for a ""nice glass of red wine"". OMG! My inner sommelier wanted to SCREAM as I eyed this Sutter Home disaster in a glass. Egad!


Honestly, they actually had Bartles & James featured as their ""Wine Cooler of the day"". I know how much we all crave a great fuzzy navel cheerleader beer with our spicy Thai food, right?


Enough of that...

Good points: Hooray for being open 24 hours! After a wicked session of Muay Thai boxing it was nice to get some ""late night"" Thai eats. This place definitely scores bonus points as the ""only viable Thai option available after a certain hour.""  We all know that Thai places are notorious for closing wicked early (why!?!?), so that was cool.


Ok, I'm going to stop being a food snob now. If you want some decent eats at a fair price with a ""no frills"" attitude, then here ya go! 


Go get 'em, tiger!

I arrive to a near empty restaurant, which is usually a bad sign, but since the sign outside implied that Ocha was newly opened, I took a seat anyway. The two dining areas could have held probably 200 patrons, and there were only 4 of us customers at 7pm on a Wednesday. We customers were actually outnumbered by the front room staff not to mention the kitchen employees. 

Anyway, the food. Based on the waiter's recommendation, I ordered a mongolian beef dinner special which was an entree with a soup and eggroll. 

Well, not only was the food not very good, there wasn't enough of it! If I weren't taught by my mom not to ""waste"" food, I probably wouldn't have eaten much of the Mongolian beef which tasted ""funny"" in addition to being too spicy and salty. I did end up eating everything but got hungry again less than 3 hrs later. 

Also, I should note that the majority of the menu (and the entire dinner special section) consist of Chinese dishes, not Thai. This is weird because the owners and employees of the establishment are clearly Thai (I've heard enough of the language to be able to recognize it).

It's a good hole-in- the-wall spot located in an area I probably wouldn't venture to if she hadn't been there so many times. We were greeted by a nice young lady and were seated right away. We sat by the stage area and I thought they had karaoke. One of the workers told me they will have someone sing I've in half an hour. It was around 6:15 p.m. on a Friday night so I'm guessing they have live music weekends? Cool either way. It's a charming stage to add to the vibe. 

I ordered the chicken pad Thai in spicy level number one and my friend ordered the pad se ew in spicy level number three. Food came out fairly quickly and the portions were enough for seconds or even thirds! My friend suggested the fried wontons as well. They were good, but not my type of appetizer. The wontons were folded into a triangle shaped and filled with a dollop of ground pork. It was crispy and came with a side of spicy vinegar like dipping sauce.  If you like crispy and crunchy apps, then you would like the fried wontons.

The chicken pad Thai was very flavorful. It had a slight heat to it and that's when I realized our spice preferences were mixed. My pad Thai was supposed to be a one level and I got spice level 3. My friend's pad se ew was a level 1 instead of a 3. Not a big deal actually because the little extra kick of heat was quite tasty. Although I think my friend was kind of missing some heat, but she said she was fine as it was. The waiter came back to check on us and we informed him of the spice level mix up. He quickly offered to redo the food, but we said it was ok because the food was still delicious. 

All in all, the food was hot and delicious. The prices were affordable and you get a lot of food for it. Service was attentive and it had a no frills kind of atmosphere.

We came Saturday night around 9pm, and there was only one big group there celebrating a birthday. There was a DJ lady playing Youtube videos (by request) and occasionally singing. And top it all off with a parquet dance floor with disco ball for the big group's kids to jump around singing and dancing to LMFAO. We noted that it felt like we were at a 1990s prom. Amazing.

The food was fine. The Thai tea is only $2 but was extremely sweet (like 2x a normal Thai tea). The pork pad see ew was decent, but not particularly flavorful or salty and saucy enough. I did really enjoy the Yum Nur Nam Tok though, which is grilled strips of beef, mint leaves, red onion, green onion, ground rice, and spicy sauce.

Ocha Restaurant is located right next to a motel, between a couple of chapels...not too far from the Stratosphere.  You can hop on over to Luv-It Custard after wards!

I was there the other day and made it in time for their lunch specials.  Not wanting to fill up too much since it was a late lunch, I went for the standard pad thai chicken lunch special.  For $5.95, it came with rice and an egg roll.  The pad thai was standard and it decent lunch overall.  The real winner was the Thai iced tea ($2.00).  I used to make it all the time for my old job and they make it pretty good over here.  Yum yum!

Overall, a 3.5 star rating.  It's a no frills kind of place.  No particular ambiance or anything, you're really here for the food.

Lunch specials: $5.95 Mondays through Fridays, excluding holidays. 11:00 am to 3:30 pm
Dinner specials: $7.95 Mondays through Fridays, excluding holidays. 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm

Update! 04.18.08 - Grabbed a quick dinner and had the rice noodles with gravy.  I had it with vegetables instead of meat and they really loaded up on the veggies. (It looked more like a vegetable dish than a noodle dish!)  So, they are definitely not skimpy there!  The BF had his favorite, the Thai Beef Jerky (Nice tender beef brisket in thai spice sun-dried then deep fried.) $7.95.  I've never had it anywhere else and it's pretty tasty, you might want some sticky rice with it!  We also shared a gigantic order of Thai tea.

It's no Le Thai of course, but don't be fooled or put off by the fact that the place is half Chinese. Aren't all the places in Vegas fusion anyways? 

Although Chinese/Thai food seems inauthentic in say LA, it's the norm in vegas.  We got the spicy basil chicken, pineapple fried rice and a third dish. Split between 3, it came out to 9.67 with tax and the portions were huge.

This was the only place still open after 10pm.  I remember eating at one of the older locations many years ago and the food was decent.  The new location is much nicer and larger complete with live music capability and a small dancefloor.  Only one table was seated, which I guess does not say much since it was a Monday night at a non-strip location.  We try our best not to eat at any strip restaurants since the food is generally over-priced and in our experience, horrible.  We like to eat where the locals would eat .  The server was very friendly and welcoming and told us to sit down at a table since the counter was dark.  The menu had a good variety, did not have my favorite pad ki mao, but I was able to order Thai Beef Jerky, Nam Sod Salad, which are my brother's favorite.  I also ordered Pad Thai and Pork Belly with Chinese Broccoli for his gf.  Portions were ok for the price, aside for the chinese broccoli, since it did not come with rice and it's not like the box was even half full.  The Nam Sod had good flavor but I ordered it medium spice and my brother said there was barely any spice.  The pad thai did not have much flavor to it although they did use fresh rice noodles, which is always a plus.  They did not put any condiments in the bag aside from some cheap packets of soy sauce, which is useless to thai people.  For restaurants that serve Isarn style thai food, I expect the spice level to be higher.  I will make a note to order level 10 spicy if we decide to order from them again.  I am glad the server did not handle any of our food since she seated us where we had full view of what was happening behind the bar.  She blew her nose and did not wash or sanitize her hands.  Had she decided to touch our food I would have complained and walked out.  They must have a large crowd later on in the night since they open til 4am on a weekday.  We probably will not dine in.

The nicer the old man is, the meaner the old lady is. She doesn't even laugh or smile.

We had a bad experience with her. She took our orders, we already known that the Thai Ice Tea is sweet and we ask for the less sweet Thai Ice Tea. She just makes sweet. I asked for combination fried rice but changed immediately as I just noticed the Hawaii fried rice. She mumbled. My friend asked for a shrimp curry but she wants to change right after that. The old lady mumbled again. Then she kept mumbling after and after that which we don't even know.

As the coffee is too sweet, we want the blank dark coffee to dilute the coffee. The lady kept asking what is it? Ice or hot? She came back and the old man brought us a hot black coffee. Later on, the lady brought another ice coffee but as she figured out we already had one, she brought it back and ....drank it!!!!!!!!

We paid for the food, she just left our bill right there on the cashier table and take care of the other customers first. So it's take us like 15-20mins to have our bill done.

All of the food is not as good as they used to be, or maybe she doesn't want us to have a good food. Hawaii fried rice is the only one that we could eat. Green and red curry are so salty, the shrimp is tasteless.

5509502,2014-04-16,0,EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ,"The reviews being highly mixed extremes, either ""This place was disgusting"" or ""This was food of the Gods"", my sister and I were a little hesitant to eat here. We decided to give it a shot anyway on our last day in town. I'm so glad we did!
The place was pretty empty, only two or three other tables were filled. I asked about this during the meal and apparently they had a location shift, only to find this part of town had very little diner traffic. Despite the cavern-like emptiness it was clean and well-kept, with warm lighting and an overhead tv with the news signifying the dining area in use.

Our waiter was young, personable and enthusiastic, happy to answer questions with descriptive answers, and checked in on us often. The manager at the counter was pleasant as well, and halfway through our meal asked about our experience personally.

The thai iced tea was FABULOUS, delicious and refreshing. It paired well with all the dishes. I ordered the Tom Kha soup, Thai Beef Jerky, and Fried Wontons to share. My sister had the Chinese fare, Kung Pao chicken (no spice) and Egg Drop Soup.
We received the wontons first. They were a little transluscent and crispy-crunchy brown, a little greasy but in a good way. There wasn't as much of the yummy sausage-y meat in each one as I would have liked, but it wasn't a big deal. The sweet chili sauce served with these had no heat/spiciness at all, which was great for my sister's cat tongue.

Next we got the Thai beef jerky, the Kung Pao, and Tom Kha soup. My soup was on fire! Rather, the beautiful metal tureen it was in had flames coming from the center, which was both fun and kept the soup hot throughout the meal. There was enough soup to feed 4 people, which was great as I was wondering why it was $10 alone. The Tom Kha is offered in chicken or shrimp and has a coconut, chili,  and lime base. It was rich and clean, sour at first sip before bursting with flavor, absorbed well by the tender white-meat chicken. 

The beef jerky is evidently marinated or well-seasoned thick sticks of beef that are quickly deep-fried. The result is a crispy yet jerky-like outside and a tender inside. I'm not sure what the greenish dipping sauce was, but it pairs perfectly with the jerky. I was a big fan of this dish, as was my sister and our family ravaged the leftovers. 

Sister's Kung Pao was very good, I'm not too familiar with the dish and something tells me it wasn't like most dishes of the same name, but names aside the meat was nicely done, the sauce delectable, and always a pleasant surprise the vegetables were perfectly done, not mushy or hard, just a perfect little crunch to it. 
The Egg Drop came about a minute after the rest and was an enticing rich gold-brown, not the typical glutenous neon yellow. Sister loved it. We were also offered a tureen of white rice, which was perfect as well.

The check came out to about $48-$50 (before tip), with the Kung Pao and Tom Kha being the $10 dishes, the jerky and wonton appetizers about $8 and $6 each, egg drop $5, and drinks $2-ish, then tax. The portion sizes were good for the price. I typically don't pay more than $15 for a meal, but I feel extremely satisfied with my experience, and can't wait to visit again next time I'm in Vegas!",WvnjkrpWT8POkMEpe_l0ww,0,0,4,2XsDtKbFw9582FGDbpBImw

5600122,2013-01-08,4,EWbNTPW0co_X4lZRB-QTLQ,"I think this place intentionally tried to make this a bad experience.  I did everything possible to stay positive and give this place a fair shake.  How would you rate a place based on this?

1. I find this place on Yelp and I go to the address and they have a small sign on the door that says they moved.  The owners did not update any listings on-line!  The only thing they did was take a piece of copy paper and hand write a little note and tape it to the door.  DUHHHHH.

2.  No greeting upon entering.  Some slobish looking guy sitting at the register waved some one down to sit me.  I wouldn't be surprised if this was the owner - it would make perfect sense.  Imagine, Barney from the Simpson's greeting your customers.

3.  Super long wait for the food.  I ordered a simple chicken curry.  I was in no hurry for my curry, but the 30 minute wait for food was getting to me.

4.  So by the time I get my food, I am starving.  I dive right into my bamboo shoot curry....  errr.... chicken curry and burned my mouth.  Maybe that was my fault, but it hurt like a mother effer!

5.  The food.  Well it was not good.  It was a bowl of bamboo shoots with a few pieces of chicken.  The curry was greasy, it was like gravy or something.  I thought green curry sauce was supposed to have a coconut flavor.  Anyways, I could hardly taste anything anyways after my mouth was burned.  I can say this, for the better part of 2 days I had a terrible after taste from this place.  

6.  I get my bill.  These people had the nerve to charge me a $1 for rice, even though the menu says rice is included.  So it was $8.95 plus a $1.  Who charges for rice?  That really pissed me off!

The tom kha gai soup is amazing and they will make it to varying intensities of spiciness so that you enjoy it to its fullest.

Close place to where I live (Hostel Cat). Also near two wedding chapels, many cheap motels and a couple of adult stores. I'm not implying anything. 

I ordered the Pad Thai, as most people to a new Thai place do. The rebel in me chose the shrimp over the chicken.

Interior is nicely decorated but simplistic. Feels a bit on the posh side. There's even a stage where a lady was singing Thai songs, karaoke-style. 

Pad Thai arrived with a whole lot of chilli flakes/powder sprinkled on top to make it spicy - this could be improved. 
The taste was typical and the noodles were greasy enough to not feel dry as they do in some other places. 
However, no lime wedge was provided and flavour could have been richer. 

I probably should have gone with the Tom Yum Goong.
