TRYING to order was even more fun.  I told the guy three times that I wanted a six inch subway club but he kept on talking.  So he pulls out a foot long bread and rudely asks me what I  wanted in my sandwich.  I said pepper jack and he said NO what sandwich you want?!?!?!?!  So then as he's beginning to put it together he hands it off to his equally lazy coworker and takes off in the back.  Paying for it was it....EXCEPT after the girl took my money she took off forgetting to give me my sandwich so I reached over and grabbed it.  I will NEVER go back to this place again!,z8AGhUv_InAzDIe7GGhuQg,0,0,1,R47wGWqoiBruriGaTPfZTA

So far at this location, I tried:
- The Black Forest Ham
- The Cold Cut Combo
- Italian B.M.T.
- Sweet Onion Teriyaki

If you decide to stay FIT, I recommend going to this Subway because all the subs are HEALTHY. Also they give you lots of vegistables and you know that vegetables are healthy for you.",fTt_rcnc-nNpjWaDrbvEow,0,0,4,Jj40-tMNSxmaYOKL-sn9WQ
4396446,2015-10-07,1,D92rYqjoz8e1YKoif_bwuw,I waited in line for 20minutes. The girl working kept leaning over to grab items and her dirty shirt kept touching my sandwich. That's disgusting and unsanitary. So I just walked away. I'll never come here again.,WQGiKbfq2NFbc8jXCOnUng,0,1,1,eSpbOXMwf678H-Ki-P4EkQ

She is one of those people who is happy to be alive. I love seeing her at subway everyday being so upbeat and great at her job. She deserves a raise!!

Lines are terrible but typically move pretty fast, so not mad about that. What I am mad about is that there is something really strange going on at this location with money. Last week I was overcharged for a single chicken breast salad (salad only, no meal or sides) and it cost $7.50 plus tax. Yesterday, I was got a ham and cheese 6"" meal with a large drink. The charge for chips/large drink is ""MISC RETAIL $2.90"" my sandwich itself was $4.09. When I got to the register my total was never said outloud to me so I just handed ASHLEY a $20 and got my change and left. During busy times they really move you through like cattle, no time to double count. I sat down at a table in the SU and thought something was off. At first I thought she shorter my change by $5, but that wasn't it. I looked at my receipt and sure enough there's another MISC RETAIL charge for exactly $5. What the hell is that???? I'll post a picture of my receipt as well. I'm in contact with the franchise owner and I really hope they'll make it right.

DOUBLE CHECK YOUR RECEIPTS WHEN CHOOSING THIS LOCATION!!!!

The employee ASHLEY is so rude and never cracks a smile. I would never hire her for anything and she deserves to be seriously disciplined. Don't work with the public if you hate your job, it rubs off on the customers and puts a bad taste in our mouth. Especially next to an exceptional employee like Stephie, you look even worse. Get a grip. 

My two receipts where I'm overcharged were rang in by 1) Stephanye (salad) and 2) Ashley (ham meal). Beware dining here.",-YV1yESQXqR3vpIgBjKDsw,1,0,2,d7mtwXFMAac3-VNgU63TxA

I don't know if they are under staffed or what, but there's always a wait. To be fair, they are usually the only restaurant open at 10am. 

One thing that is frustrating, don't prioritize a to go order if the person picking up the food isn't there and there's a huge line. Frustrating",dQ9QCke91gPqdzAzoGWUYA,1,1,1,iI9_7auGoaobVtJ5ZrC9FQ
