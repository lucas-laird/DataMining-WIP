The service was extremely slow It took them 10 minutes to seat me and I waited over a half an hour to get my entree (I guess it didnt help that the kitchen crew came out of the kitchen with their lunches and sat down in the dining room to have there lunch while I was still waiting 30 minutes for mine). Food was bad I got the carne asada tacos and the meet was just grizzle and fat (totally inedible), pinto beans were gritty and under cooked,  tortillas were all soggy from the bean juice/water, Rice was soggy and over cooked.  Food was over priced.  The manager never came up to ask us how the food or service was going, he just stood at the bar doing nothing ( I guess he must have been waiting for his shift to end so he could get out of this horrible place). oh and did I mention we where the only table in the whole restaurant!   I wish I could write something nice about this place but I cant find one thing.... oh maybe the only good thing was the Iced tea was cold.",wYyC1E2mSvAgUxqg68KD2g,2,0,1,mnINCVCmPOzWxffwQSHiMg

410625,2011-05-28,0,1Fa_brd85F_-gXYP45GpsA,"En tant que Français, je me devais de tester ce nouveau restaurant qui mélange cuisine française et cuisine baja. 
Dès notre arrivée, nous avons été surpris par l'endroit : la terrasse ensoleillée est très agréable et à l'intérieur, la décoration est extrêmement soignée. C'est aussi très spacieux. Le service était impeccable et tout le personnel gentil et rapide. 
La carte proposait beaucoup de plats avec des ingrédients français, qui s'accordaient parfaitement avec la cuisine baja. C'était la première fois que nous goutions des plats aussi étonnants, risqués, et délicieux. Les nachos au brie, les crevettes, tout était très bon. Et le dessert, des gâteaux de crêpes, ont permis de terminer le repas sur une note toute aussi positive qu'il avait commencé. Cerise sur le gâteau, le chef, très sympathique et accueillant, est venu échanger quelques mots de français avec nous (il a étudié la cuisine en France avec les plus grands chefs !). 
A quand un Hotel California Restaurant à Paris ?

As French people, we had to try this new restaurant that mix French and Baja cuisine. The place was very beautiful, clean, with a great terrasse. Inside, it's huge and the design is perfect. the staff was really nice, and professional. 
We were surprised and amazed by the menu (a lot of meals include French ingredients that we love). Everything we tried was very tasty, fresh, and delicious (Nachos with brie, shrimps...) from apetizers to dessert (a crêpes cake, amazing). The chef, very nice and welcoming came to speak to us in French (he learned French cuisine with the biggest chef of the country !). It was a perfect afternoon.
Now, we want a Hotel California Restaurant in Paris.",NLDumY0gCat787qsm8RaQg,1,0,5,d4hp5PXAaOhWPOSADhvJAw
411780,2011-06-27,0,1Fa_brd85F_-gXYP45GpsA,"I had the pleasure of dining at Hotel California this past Friday and let me just say, for all you past reviewers who tried the HC in their beginning phase, you NEED to go back. There is a beautiful new menu, all laid out complete with a separate vegetarian section (which is awesome since it's something I'm grappling with)! But let me just begin with the ambiance. This is a beautiful restaurant both inside and out. I could probably talk to you about the bathroom alone for another page (however I won't) but the furniture, the decor, the set up and the music are all pretty amazing. The patio sections are laid out just as nice with couches, MISTERS (perfect for BOTH happy hours on the patio!), and a cabana-style feel to it. We sat at a table inside which worked out to our benefit (I will explain why later on).
So let's get down to food and service, both extremely important. Almost as soon as we sat down, our waitress Colleen came over to greet us and tell us about the seafood specials which all sounded pretty great. It was honestly soo hard for me to choose with this new menu. So many items, so little time. Almost at the exact same time, someone came over with chips and salsa. You can just tell that this was made fresh in the restaurant, it was just fantastic. I think I ate too much of it therefore leading me to be kinda full by the time our entrees came out. Colleen suggested the Raspberry Mint Margarita so my friend ordered one of those and I got the sangria. Let's just say I was pretty jealous of that marg when it came out and ordered one for my second drink. I eventually narrowed down my selection to the Camarones Rancheros while my friend got the Camarones Negros (the newest item on the menu we were told...I was skeptical because it came with a Mango Beurre Blanc sauce and I'm not a huge fan of fruit and seafood but I let my friend be a guinea pig). I was also offered either the soup of the day or a house salad and I ordered the salad which came with a herb house vinaigrette that was pretty delicious. All the while, someone kept coming over to check if our drinks were ok, filling up our waters when they were 3/4 full and bringing us more chips and salsa. SOOO attentive, I'm not sure where these bad service reviews are coming from but if they do one thing right (and they certainly do more than one thing right) its the service. So an A++ for that!
Finally, the entrees. Six big shrimps with sauteed peppers and onions with a creamy tequila-jalapeno sauce on top of rice. Hello, amazing. I would have liked the mushrooms that were supposed to come with it but hey, that's ok. We told our server and she said that mine was also a newer dish they were working on and promptly offered to take it back. But it was so good, I had already eaten half of it by the time she was done talking haha. My friend's dish was surprisingly good! I didn't want to tell her how skeptical I was but I'm happy she didn't change her mind last minute because the mango sauce was great! It really complemented the ancho-covered shrimps quite well. So overall I'm gonna go with an A- for food just because of the missing mushrooms and we were supposed to get beans (though I certainly didn't need them, the food we received held its own). 
BUT WAIT! We aren't done here. Desserts? Of course! So we couldn't resist the bananas foster which is made at your table! They bring out a bowl with vanilla bean ice cream and some tall guy comes to our table with a rolling cart topped with a huge bowl of butter and brown sugar and starts explaining how he makes Bananas Foster. Who was this mystery man? Not sure because he didn't look like a server but he makes one mean Bananas Foster (also comes in peach variety but so glad I chose banana), complete with flambeé and all! It was an experience to be remembered for sure and this was why I was glad that I sat inside. I am going to give the patio a try one of these days because they do fajitas out there and they smelled pretty amazing as we were walking out (though I was about to bust out of my jeans). 
All in all, a night to be remembered and hopefully repeated in the near future! Thanks Hotel California!",DJMaw3f7slmLPniDqCN8bw,4,0,5,DjfTzhctj8Ft--4AAUk9bg

This was a horrible dining experience. Our first clue should have been 6 tables occupied at 6pm on a Saturday night, but we wanted to give it a try. 

Had our 4 kids with us who are very good eaters and willing to try anything. The manager came over to tell us how ""kid friendly"" the restaurant was. 

The food was average at best. My husband got the pork and did like it. The kids ordered bean/cheese burrito and it was OK. 

The problem is the $3 charge PER KID for a glass of water with a splash of lemon....on top of the kids meal. Then they wouldn't honor the happy hour prices in the restaurant, only at the bar. So how is this kid friendly? 

I talked to the manager on my way out and he obviously isn't interested in my business. He explained they charge $3 for a drink because they used REAL lemons (really?) and ran into the kitchen to get away from me. 

We will never return!! Doubt they will be open for more than a few months. Too bad, we need good Mexican in this area.",9HFUo_3T6R0bnNVSUQJ7tg,13,0,1,9IEy-1g6--BUhmdR6FLOCg

I was hoping that something good would fill the shoes of this nice location in Boca Park.  It's the lack of quality in the food and lack of impressive service that bring it down.

Food:  We got specialty nachos, chile relleno, seafood pasta.  The chef himself vouched for all the food, but I was not impressed.  The portions were small and the food looked like they were sitting under a heat lamp before being brought out.

Service:  Granted that everyone can have a bad day, but it was weird that we did not get appetizer plates while we were all making a mess of ourselves and the table with the nachos. 

Conclusion:  The un-inspring food, average service combined with cigar/cigarrette smoke wafting over every now and then (we were sat near the cigar lounge) led to a very un-tasty experience.",bW2AQqcSPascYvKXsF0S-g,13,3,2,mqiB6fiiNlhv04DgXSNQ2A

For the mains we ordered the lobster it was very very small and served with beans and rice that were very bland, there was a tortilla on the side but we didn't know what to do with it, just a rip off at $25.

By the name of the restaurant (excluding Cantina) we though it was American fare (burgers, salads, with a ""cantina style bar"").  Turns out it was more of a Mexican type restaurant (chips & salsa served) with some other things on the menu (pizza, crab cakes, steak).

My son had the kids pizza, my husband the enchilada and tenderloin and I ordered the crab cakes.  The food was pretty good, but the portions were small, especially for the price.  

Kids Pizza - decent, expected for a kids pizza, no drink included
Crab cakes - a bit thin but good tasting, not too bready.  There's a salad on top which was way way way to salty and an eggplant below with a green sauce, both were yummy
Enchilada & Tenderloin - Both were very good and tasty, sides of rice and beans were small - again overall small portions

The service was really slow for more than 1/2 the restaurant empty.  The waiter seemed overwhelmed with his few tables.  He didn't anticipate our next course, so we waited a while to order, waited with empty dinner plates to order dessert and waited with empty dessert plates for our check.

Walking in to this restaurant is beautiful, restaurant is decorated very nicely, looks huge from the out side but not too big inside.
They bring you a small bowl with some veggie sticks and  a lime ""that will change the flavor and be so amazing"". not so much, tasted like a carrot with lime juice. 
We ordered the chips and salsa trio ($3) chips are greasy and heavy, salsas were good. 
 I had Vegetable tacos ($9.95)- One  zucchini stick and one slice of eggplant deep fried in thick heavy batter topped with pico. So BAD!!   
My boyfriend had Fish tacos( $9.95) a deep fried little piece of fish topped with sprouts, not good either. 

 For a restaurant claiming traditional Baja California cuisine with a modern twist, I think light, fresh and clean flavors and that is not the case here. Everything was very greasy, heavy and I do not recommend this place.",iCZFcVMCICuT7ZtcKYeL2Q,2,0,1,jZ3tZVo0q3IU-6wUOg32Tg

3351929,2011-05-17,7,1Fa_brd85F_-gXYP45GpsA,"Sometimes I wonder about the mixed reviews Yelpers put out there. I don't want to say my food reviews are more credible because it is still just an opinion but I am an obsessed foodie with lots of gourmet eating experience so I think I can tell the difference between good quality, fresh, passionate food and bleh. For those who gave the food a good review....I wonder how the heck they came up with that??!!

I went to the opening of Hotel California and only tried a cocktail or two so I wanted to go  back to have the dining experience.  The cocktails were pretty good and I read some bad reviews so I had my fingers crossed.

As you have read in previous reviews of this place, the ambience is the best part.  I agree.

We went for lunch and were seated far back from the other 3 occupied tables. Maybe because we had an infant in a car seat? Maybe they were worried that she would be noisy or they were just trying to spread the tables so it looked busier than it was.

While we looked at the menu we were given a little dish of fruit and vegetables to munch on. That was nice of them! Usually people get chips and salsa but ok, not here I guess. The dish was about 4 inches in diameter and had a few slivers of mango, papaya, pineapple and 2 carrot sticks.  Each table has a lime squeezer hanging on it. To me that was an awesome idea! So I was looking forward to squeezing lime on or in something.

I ordered the seared Ahi Tuna Salad and my friend ordered the Tortilla soup and Octopus appetizer. (I actually love octopus and was eager to try their dish...imagining it was like the Pulpo Asado at Firefly.)

My dish came out with the seared tuna sitting next to a tortilla bowl full  of lettuce with one half of a cherry tomato, 2 super thin slices of old bruised cucumber and 3 pepita seeds. I could smell the fishy odor before she even set the fish down and I was a bit worried...Ahi shouldn't have a fishy odor right? The sear was not a sear it was more of a what??? It was white on the outside but I can't figure out how they seared it because it didn't have that seared edge to it.  The thick lime type dressing looked like mayo and tasted like sugary lime so I  passed.  Lemon wedges and salt were my backup dressing. I tasted the fish and couldn't even finish it (and if you know me, that is an odd thing because when hungry I can eat almost anything!) because the texture of disintegrating stinky fish just turned my stomach.  I ate lettuce.  

My friend's dish of Octopus came to the table. The octopus was wrapped in a barely cooked piece of bacon..weird? I tasted the dish and was not surprised to find that it was way too rubbery to be a decent dish.  I have had the dish at Firefly and the texture is almost as tender as chicken so I KNOW octopus does not have to be rubbery!

The tortilla soup tasted like a can of enchilada sauce heated up with strips of soggy tortilla swimming in it.  It came with little dishes of chicharonnes, avocado cubes, chipotle chile rounds and crema. The chicharonnes (sorry re spelling) were stale and not even crispy, the avocado cubes were unripe and tough. BOO!

Then we had dessert... can't mess that up too much right? We ordered the Churros to share. When we bit into the churros we both were pretty confused. Where is this strong taste of egg coming from? Why is this in churros? After racking our brains as to what the churros reminded us of, we figured it out.  They tasted like cream puffs (or choux pastry) but without the pastry cream! Oddest churros I have ever eaten.  Not crispy, so cakey that I suggest they don't even call them churros.

Before we left we asked the server for just a little taste of the homemade Sangria. (I had a feeling I wouldn't be coming back so I wanted to try as much as possible.)  Well, at least they are consistent. It was bitter, tasted like it had tequila in it and was lacking any kind of fruity aspect that one would usually associate with Sangria.

So, the 2 stars are for the service and the ambience. I might go back to hang on the patio but probably not. If the folks at Hotel California read these reviews they should take the hint and invest in higher quality ingredients, a chef who really cares about his/her dishes and wants to get creative and let the chef have some freedom.  If they continue on this same path, I'm afraid it's going to result in another try and fail for that building.",0kLYM03OtK-qeVNrk3sUbQ,16,3,2,xe6R5JGF-pEcow1eKNyn_g
4693261,2011-05-26,6,1Fa_brd85F_-gXYP45GpsA,"Okay, so the only thing going for this place is their outdoor patio and decor. But you can check that out from the parking lot.

Whatever you do, avoid this place. It's overpriced, low quality food. First things first; their ""fresh guacamole"" was nothing more than doctored up, store bought guacamole. The chips tasted like paper. My flank steak was tasteless and overcooked. I would've rather gnawed on my shoe. I realized that attempting to send my food back would only result in a repeated disaster of bad foodism. The rice was not good, nor was the attempt at pinto beans.

4825943,2011-05-06,0,1Fa_brd85F_-gXYP45GpsA,"Designed around the concept of casual Baja Mexican food and feeling, Hotel California has potential to be great. Main word being potential. The atmosphere and decor is spot on with the desired concept; Soft, ""beach"" colors, huge wooden tables, colorful chairs, and a huge waterfall above the main bar. They do have a few flat panels around the bars, but all are 32"", a lil small for this application, but not the biggest deal to worry about. So an A+ in the look and feel department. 
There is also a separated Cigar area, but it is lacking music and a real humidor or selection of cigars. It'd be fine if you bring your own sticks, but only a choice of 8 out of a vending machine if you buy there. 
As far as the food is concerned, I can only comment on the offerings for the grand opening, but I still think it's a good representation of the full menu. 
Tilapia Cerviche: Bland at best. The ingredients were fresh, but it just lacked any kick or good acidic accents.
Mini Burritos with Sauce: The burritos was ok, but the sauce with it was the king of the night for me. It had a smokey/tomato and herbs taste and scent, amazing.
Deep Fried Oysters: These had apparently been made earlier in the day, very chewy and dry, I really hoped for these to be better.
Empenadas: Pretty much all pastry. The texture was right, was just missing some real substance.
Food overall I'd give a C. I honestly think the kitchen needs a lil more time to get their flavors right. But for now, the food does not match the quality of the beautiful decor.",QIrJKF0cJ04Vasv-rxOQ3Q,13,3,3,rMpHISEK6udl6kfOFOXySA

Sunday evening and the place is empty, not a good sign. We had reservations (obv not necessary), since we were planning on having a large group (14).
 We slowly met around the bar since it was happy hour, some good deals to be had, and had some drinks while we waited for everyone to arrive. The bartender was nice enough to let us sample the Sangria, meh, nothing special. I ordered a Logandrop Martini, very yummy. Bar service was a little slow. As we were standing there a busboy came through the patio door with a tray full of dirty dishes and dropped them at our feet along with a bowl of salsa. They apologized and cleaned up quickly, not harm, no foul...accidents happen.
We were seated at a nice big table, lots of elbow room for everyone to be comfy. Chips and Salsa at the table, they were average tasting.
Service was pleasant and helpful. I think our waiters name was Antonio. 
About half of our group ordered the 3 Course Special of Soup or Salad, Lobster Tail, and Peaches and Cream for dessert for $27. There was a wide array of orders otherwise.
The Tortilla Soup is a thick tomato soup with some spice, nothing to rave about, it came with little sides of tortilla strips, avocado, sour cream, ancho chilis, and Chicharonnes (which were not crispy and tasted like styrofoam). When main courses were served somehow, everyone got food except the Lobsters, it took at least another 5 minutes for ours to come out. It was a decent size tail, with a few strips of veggies on the side, it was cooked okay. My husband got the Steak Fajitas, I liked their fresh made tortillas, the steak looked dry but it was tender, but needed some seasoning, just average.
While eating we finally inquired about the juicers on the table. The waiter said their concept is ""Everything tastes better with lime""...well then why were we not told this, or given limes?? LAME.
Our friend got Chicken Enchiladas, and in his second bite were chicken bones. It was taken back, and he got a fresh dish without bones. No one raved about their food.
The Peaches and Cream dessert was big and actually quite delicious, Fresh and presented beautifully.

The atmosphere was great, made me feel like desperately wanting to go to the beach.",vOG8Z_fZIvMLZ25NNvzD0g,1,0,5,PvBbonf2c3vbvIXGjWTdCw

First, I have to mention how incredibly friendly the entire staff is.  
The first time I was here for the cigar lounge.  The good: It was very comfortable, and it is a great place to have a few (drinks/cigars).  There are several tvs and plenty of comfy chairs and sofas in there.  The four exhaust fans clear the smoke out very well.  Now, the bad: it was very hot in the cigar room around 5-6pm on a hot day.  Also, the cigar selection is not great.  Not a problem, a cigar shop is in the same shopping center just a short walk away.  

On my second visit I went to the cigar room again, but also spent some time on the patio.  The service was great!  We had some appetizers and they were tasty and fresh.  Misting system and fresh guac makes a great patio set up.  Also, my date really liked the sangria. 

I didn't give 5 stars because I haven't tried the entrees yet and the cigar room is too hot at the wrong time of day.   Might need some darker shades or tint.",5lOtqU-BVcGdangJNy9kXw,2,0,4,1pmhgXj0U0vpwXtAcHskTw

My husband and I went here on a Wednesday evening.  The outside patio area was very nice and since the dining room was fairly empty we opted to sit outside.

We waited about 10 minutes before anyone approached our table with menus.  Our server finally arrived and took our drink order.....one of their specialty martinis and a blue moon. And then we just sat there.... tick tock went the clock. At last a busboy came to our table and asked if we wanted any water.  We said yes and asked him if he could please, also check on the status of our drink order.  
The wait on just drinks was outrageously ridiculous.  A party of 6 sitting near us had enough.... someone from their group took down their drink order and headed to the bar.  And yes, they received their drinks before we did.

A good 25 minutes later (seriously, no joke) our drinks arrived. Yay! Maybe things will get better after a cocktail?.... Not.

We ordered the ""fresh"" guacamole with chips, Flautas de Pato (duck taquitos) and the Arrachera Marinada (marinated steak).

The guacamole was all right - not bad, yet not great. However, the chips accompanying the guacamole were just plain awful.  Not sure if they were sitting in oil for too long or were simply undercooked because they were chewy, very chewy. Although props to them for attempting to make fresh chips??

My Flautas de Pato were average..... similar to buying frozen food from Costco and deep frying them at home. Wait, I take that back.... food from Costco is much better. But since I was starving, I ate half of it.  The biggest disappointment  about my dish was the ""strawberry jalapeno"" salsa it was to have on the side. Maybe I had high expectations... but I was truly expecting to see fresh strawberries (most especially since they are in season) chopped up with some jalapeno.  The salsa was more like Smucker's strawberry jam with a chive on top.  No jalapeno anywhere. Not even a hint of jalapeno flavor.

My husband ordered his steak ""medium"".... it came out well done.   Enough said.

The table next to us asked if we liked our food and we told them the truth. They also agreed and stated they would not return.

Oh! and the table of 6 dining near us?..... they got up and left since service was extremely slow.

Maybe the chef, kitchen staff and servers were having an off day? Regardless, we will not be returning.",bNZB4YBVV6KkeISX7u4MMg,16,5,1,M1ReTbXm-DAX-HA-dncEXw
