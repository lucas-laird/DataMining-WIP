I really like the simple menu and fresh ingredients. I got the chicken bowl with everything.",Ac2oeT_2_xFn117_UszdcQ,1,0,5,I0Lx-m7lF0GDiz8m7W9GsQ

3551943,2017-11-10,0,bU9RYLrF77bxO2pSA0Ba7Q,This is the worst Chipotle' s I have eaten at in Las Vegas. The food was bland and the portions were small for the prices you pay. The employees are not friendly or knowledgeable about their menu. The atmosphere is as sterile as a mental hospital. If this is what Chipotle' s Mexican grills are like I won't waste my time and money to eat at another one.,uAunkTZWzpVSiKl5G2Ggow,0,0,5,cDHoXk3Kt2Q8Clnk0R053g

From their very existence it's always been a top notch joint (if I can use that terminology) negating (Invalidate.) all for what the chain stand's for..... No thanks to the media. I understand overall the company has been standing on shaky ground with certain issues.This particular restaurant from the food, clean Invironment, great service and staff. If one would ask for a little extra here and there not a prob. Been there a few times.",_qNjkdmabszxzeS4rWsuxg,0,0,4,hnl4TELYMTBGHlAqm8qzHQ

This location of chipotle did not disappoint. We were on our way to Hoover dam when we realized that our navigation was taking a detour. It worked in our favor as we ended up finding this. 
The place is fresh and full of natural light. There wasn't a line so we all go our burrito bowls very quickly. All of their ingredients were super fresh and par with chipotle standards. It was also very clean! We did not have to look at multiple tables to find one that was acceptable. I give this place 2 thumbs up and hope that it continues the good work!",bEXtBenbCGae5YPIPJ2B6g,0,0,5,l8EbBOMngNWbQC-k6BmkEw
