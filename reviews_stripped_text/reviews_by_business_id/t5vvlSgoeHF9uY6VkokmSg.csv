765168,2015-10-19,0,t5vvlSgoeHF9uY6VkokmSg,"This place is horrible to deal with. These people are fucking idiots and the manager Mary as well. First they get my order wrong. Granted they corrected one part of my order. They can't make something as simple as extra well done crispy sesame beef. When we got it. It was saugy. We had to return and there only solution what to put the sauce on the side. At the other location on Centennial they know how to make it perfect extra well done crispy and guess what they have it delivered to us and it still crispy. This store where we live close by and we picked it up, they can't even do it. They said that with the sauce on top it makes it saugy by the time you get it but the manager wouldn't and listen to what I was saying. How can they make it perfect at the Centennial location they make it extra crispy with the sauce on top and have it delivered and it still crispy. Yeah they're different locations and all named China one but they're owned by the same person they should all be taught how to make it all the same. Especially if you're paying for what you want when you tell them what you want they should be able to make it for you I don't understand why the other place can do it but they can't. And the manager just kept explaining how they make it and how they make it at all the places but she wouldn't listen when I'm telling her they don't make it that way at that place. She said the put the sauce on top it will taste the same. Hell no!!! It was not even close. Its so tangy and nasty. Unlike the one at Centennial it was darker crisper like beef jerky but you didnt lose the flavor and taste crispy but soft inside. DON'T RECOMMEND THIS CHINA ONE LOCATION TO ANYONE!!! The one on CENTENNIAL IS WAY BETTER AND THEY DO IT THE WAY U WANT IT. HELL IF NOT JACKY CHAN IS BETTER AND CHEAPER AND GIVE U WAY MORE FOOD THAT IS SOOOOO GOOD AND THEY GIVE U FREE FOOD TOOO!!! AND WHEN THE MAKE A MISTAKE THEY MAKE IT THE WAY YOU WANT IT AND FOR THE INCONVENIENCE THEY GIVE YOU FREE FOOD LIKE EGG ROLLS, WONTONS, ETC. Also there's no point in complaining to the manager because she ain't going to do anything for you! She will defend her staff even though it's not what you ordered instead of making it the way you WANT( I MEAN SINCE YOUR PAYING FOR IT ) AND had ordered it. The funny thing too is that it says it on there menu it's crispy right under sesame beef. The QUALITY OF THE FOOD SHOULD BE ALL THE SAME IN ALL THERE LOCATION. BUT I WILL NEVER ORDER HERE IF ANYTHING IF I CRAVE THIS AGAIN I WILL DRIVE MY FUCKING ASS TO CENTENNIAL. IT JUST SUCKS U KNOW WHEN U CRAVE FOR SOMETHING AND THEY CAN'T EVEN MAKE IT THE SAME WAY AS THE THERE OTHER LOCATION..I WOULD UNDERSTAND IF IT WAS A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT BUT IT'S NOT!!!",0BWVf4hiNXdgRwBmxiZ0aw,2,0,1,3VyqHZJLEFwh4bEtzCNrsQ
862931,2014-04-16,0,t5vvlSgoeHF9uY6VkokmSg,"Wife and I went here for a quick bite. We normally hit a different Chinese take-out around the corner when we want a quick fix of chinese food but we decided to give this place a try. 

My wife got the combo teri-bowl, I got the sweet and sour pork. 

The beef in the teri-bowl had an odd texture but tasted fine with the sauce. overall she really enjoyed it.

I like to get my sweet and sour with the sauce on the side and that wasn't a problem here. Now overall, for someone to say that the food they got here was the best Chinese food they have ever had is a bit of a stretch. I will say though, that this was the best sweet and sour pork I have ever gotten from a strip mall take-out place. Nice bite size pieces of yummy pork goodness wrapped in a light-crunchy fried coating. Just wonderful!

I was sitting at home hungry, while my boyfriend was out with his dad, so I decided to go out on a limb and finally make a decision on my own :P I just so happened to get a flyer from China One with some coupons on it, and I can't resist a good coupon, so I made my decision!

I got the honey walnut shrimp and a large order of Thai tea, the total was a little more than I'd anticipated (delivery charge?) so I used the coupon for free crab rangoon. The food came in a timely manner, and the lady who took my order over the phone was really nice, which definitely added to my experience! 

As far as the honey walnut shrimp goes--OMG! Hands down the best honey walnut shrimp I've tasted! They don't skimp on the shrimp either!! This could definitely feed 2 or 3 people! So flavorful and it surprisingly felt healthy! I knew I made a good decision that day! The Thai tea wasn't too flavorful, but it complimented the meal perfectly anyway.

My family and I went in for a last minute Chinese food run after church on New Year's for dinner. We ordered the beef and broccoli, shrimp and lobster sauce, sesame chicken, fried rice, crab rangoons, egg drop soup, and chicken wings. At the time the food tastes good but within the next few hours one by one we all had the terrible symptoms of food poisoning. The 4 adults were the ones affected. 

The symptoms were so severe that we were not able to hold any fluids down all day on January 2nd. I had to even go to the ER to received IV hydration, meds and get an ultrasound to check on my baby since I'm 19 weeks pregnant! 

My father in law personally went to the restaurant to complain and no one took his complaint seriously. They just asked him to wait for the manager instead of calling him to let him know the situation. Because my father in law was not feeling well he couldn't wait for the manager and left. They didn't even ask him for his phone number! I personally just called the restaurant and spoke with a female (I didn't get her name as she was rushing to get off the phone) and she spoke to someone there but told me that she will have the manager call me. She did take our number but was rushing to get off the phone. I told her that this is serious and we will have to report it to the health department because there was so many of us affected. She still was rushing to get off the phone and I said ""don't you want our name?"" To be honest, I don't know if she even wrote it down as I was spelling out my father in laws name she was still trying to rush me off the phone. 

Again, this will be our first and last time here at China One on Durango. We'll see if we get a return phone call tomorrow.",Y8qNiJiwt810irZC9CBf-A,2,1,1,BWlXx1xBgVAe1N-oafebGA

Pros:
- Quick
- Inexpensive

Cons:
- No mention of MSG Free Food

China One is very similar to China A Go Go's.  The food was okay.  The food portion for their lunch special was to fill the white styrofoam box.  I ordered the Shrimp with Lobster special and the sauce was not clear like at most places.  It looked dirty like it was cooked using a dirty pan.  People had mentioned authentic Chinese Food.  I can't say that it is.  I've had better.  

It's been an hour since I ate at the restaurant and I'm feeling very jittery and anxious almost like I'm having an allergic reaction to MSG.

------

It has been a week since I have been to this restaurant, and I am NEVER going back.  I received this message from another Yelp user:

MSG 
""It is your responsibility to let the restaurant where you are visiting know that you cant eat MSG, you should be the priority care person for your own health and not blame others after youve ate MSG and give a bad review, if you really care about your health, instead of complaining, dont eat at restaurants that you know might contain MSG and better yet, dont eat at fast food restaurants, go buy organic foods at whole foods. dont blame others for your own health issues, go and work out and stop eating so much, you being fat is not others problems and you should take care of your own health.""

**I have never had an allergic reaction to MSG.  If it's not MSG, would it have been better to say the food made me sick?  LOL.  Not sure if this guy that responded to my review is an owner, a friend of the owner, or a passionate individual that LOVES this restaurant.  Either way, I stand by my review.",Bh6e3oeMTM3oGs1h4PWlhw,4,0,1,VNopMXLR09WE1c9aMvyifQ

Looked promising at first. There were 4 people ahead of me in line when I got there. Menus are printed in color on nice paper, they don't have it displayed on the walls. Decided to go with the Orange Chicken lunch special since the price wasn't too bad, $5.95. I also ordered the Vegetable Egg Rolls. I was going to try one of their smoothies, but they didn't look very good in those machines. Like they weren't mixed very well. I paid for my order and they told me it would be a 10 minute wait. No problem, since they were cooking everything fresh (I think).

Took it home and was pretty disappointed. The Orange Chicken was bland and the sauce seemed chunky, like it was old or something. You know it's bad when Panda Express serves better Orange Chicken! The egg rolls weren't very good either. They were hot and crispy, but bland as well, even with the sweet and sour sauce. Again, you know it's bad when Panda Express has better egg rolls!!
