You'd think it should be pretty simple for someone of High School graduate age to ring up an order, subtract $16 and then give me the correct total, right?  WRONG!!!!!  They took off $7.36 pre-tax and then $8 post-tax.  The entire $16 should have been subtracted PRE-TAX like a coupon (in fact, like their combo discount).  But no!  Their method gyps the Groupon user out of an additional $1.34 on a $16 Groupon, on top of their outrageous prices because they're located in a strip casino food court.  STAY AWAY!!!!",Drz_LtpTc4sLKW7Vf5FQrg,0,0,1,VxBcYcesKzb2CzfVpTDazw

Thinking, oh my they might have something I can eat, I promptly waited in line. I ordered a regular and told you how much I would not like olives on my sandwich. I also told you how I like light vinaigrette on it as well. 

But no, you did not listen. You gave me a wet, warm and crappy looking sandwich with traces of olives. 

Fracking AWESOME! 

Thank you so much for charging me 8 bucks for this horrendous meal. I stuffed it down as I had to run, but I should have thrown it back and asked for my money back. Ah well.",GMHsJ-4_08LjEmk8YEBm8Q,1,0,2,Fl6oBPcrsq2OyLVNL10fZg

The food was probably the worst food I've tasted this trip to Vegas. And for being a franchise restaurant that's not impressive. I will never give this place business again.",0VVZB8IsXXcgI6YZCBqBcQ,0,0,1,MqVPc0_auQHI4feEudTMTg

Quizno's  is located at the food court in the Riviera.  You can enter through the casino or from the Strip.

Average sandwich.  I prefer Subway over Quizno's.",LOi1qbpl2hTP0cwSDDuyBQ,1,0,3,K4wuuqNT6fDyhYTTUD7B2A
