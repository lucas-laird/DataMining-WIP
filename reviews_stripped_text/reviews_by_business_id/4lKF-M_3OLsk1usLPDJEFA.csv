While visiting my folks last December, I inquired as to where I may partake in a delicous, almost NY-like bagel, and my mom gave me the car keys and directions.  I believe this is a sister company to Noah's bagels, but somehow, these tasted better.  I got my mom a cheesy bagel with salmon, I think, and myself-the nutty-wheaty type (good grains?) with that honey cream cheese.  Also picked up two frozen mochas, and off I went.

When I got it replaced the second bagel was very cold in the middle and on top of that had a piece of egg in it on the back! I requested a refund and was given the wrong amount back (less ) than I paid. The manager processed my refund and didn't even offer a single apology.

The food itself was good.  There were only two people working and they were very slow.  My friend and I amused ourselves with chit chat while waiting for our order.  And waiting.  And waiting.  The man who took our order didn't think to give us our cups so at least we could prepare our drinks.  I finally asked for the cups.  We had plenty of time to observe how the food was prepared for us and the folks before us.  The preparation was very slow and appeared to be unorganized.  

I would make a suggestion to management to think about a little more efficiency training for the employees.  Seems to me the shop might make more money if customers knew they would get taken care of quickly?

My family and I went in shortly after 12:45 p.m. I got a breakfast bagel with cheese and egg, nobody else wanted anything so I was the only one ordering.
The sandwich came hap hazard with the top of the bagel toppled over and left on its side inside the basket exposing the cheese (which wasn't even melted!) Being in such a hurry, I took it as is and sat outside while the family went next door to Starbucks.

The sandwich filling was stale. I immediately regretted the cold cheese and the, what I could only describe as a cold egg sponge didn't help.. Gross. However, the bagel was warm and soft (??) I should have known something was wrong with the first bite. As hungry as I was, I couldn't bring myself to finish the other half.

Later that night, without going into too much detail..I experienced the worst symptoms associated with food poisoning. I hadn't eaten anything else that contained cornmeal that day or the day before, so when you know...you 'know.'

This place is terrible. You'd think with its location it would be a little more attentive to service and sanitation.

I wait about 7-8 minutes and walk up to fill my cup... But it's still empty.  I remind the guy that there is no coffee and he says he'll take care of it.  

I go back to my seat and talk some more with my friend.  I go back about 5-6 minutes later assuming that the ice coffee is ready... But still nothing.

Located right next to the Starbucks, I used to frequent this Einstein's quite a bit for a morning bagel or to grab a box of bagels.  I stopped going once I found other bagel places to go to, but from time to time I still stop in because the other bagel places are a little out of the way.  The inside is a decent size enough to seat maybe about 20 people and they do have a few tables and chairs outside you can sit at as well.  The bagels are usually pretty tasty.  However, on a few occasions I've had my bagel over toasted almost burnt served to me or the employee sent my bagel down the bagel slicer at a weird angle resulting in weirdly shaped bagels.  Coffee here is mediocre, if you do get coffee from here the iced coffee is better than their hot brews.  Overall, this is an ah-okay place to get your bagel fix.  Nothing too spectacular but nothing too horrible either.",hgfqysg2htnJI5bvtIIUjg,1,1,3,NVOHbej31S9eLJASt6sRRA

Fortunately, I had shoved the receipt in my pocket (which I normally wouldn't do) so I could prove that I paid, although I didn't have any way to prove whether or not the bagels had actually been received.  I spent over 30 minutes trying to buy 6 bagels and a tub of cream cheese.  My son ended up being 10 minutes late for a 30 minute piano lesson.

The guy was kind enough to exchange the salt fest for a different bagel with plain non-MSG laden cream cheese. So, they get a couple of stars. The chai latte was super, so they get another star.

One that wasn't 500+ calories a cup and for a reasonable price. And something to eat for breakfast, that would hold me over till lunch. I was starving and needed to be Downtown at jury duty by 8am.

Just my luck einsteins is open early! Woo hoo! I forgot that they were one of the few quick-breakfast food places open early, I really didn't want to go to McD's or Jack's. 1 star. 

So glad I was able to avoid McDonald's. When I stepped in, no line, score! 1 more star.

 I was greeted by the cashier. Smiling and a welcoming attitude. Another star.

The other worker, he seemed like he was just there for the paycheck.

 But the girl who helped me was more than helpful. I really appreciated that since I was only running on 2 hrs of sleep and on my way to jury duty at 6 am in the morning.

 I got a medium coffee and a bacon and spinach panini. I guess I didn't pay attention to the price of the sandwich because my total came out to $8. $5 Seems kinda pricey for a breakfast sandwich. But the panini was pretty big.  And that's what I get for not going to a fast food joint. The medium coffee was $3. I didn't finish the panini so I was able to eat for lunch too. So it wasn't too bad. 

I can't remember the last time I was at an Einstein's nor do I remember getting their coffee. So I was joyfully surprised to see that the coffee is self serve. I was happy to see that!!! 

I really liked the coffee! I don't like to add sugar to my coffee and just a couple squirts of half and half.  They have a couple different flavors of coffee to choose from too! 

I forgot what the name of the coffee was that I got. It was a very bold flavor. I really liked it! I love intense flavors. I've had their bagels, but not at this visit. They're delish.

While I was standing in line another customer stepped in front of me wanting to order, not knowing I was in line. It's fine, simple mistake.
