The owner who is a really sweet lady came over, introduced herself and we talked a lot about all sorts of different things. The place was super clean and beautifully decorated. The bathrooms are really nice and even have hand lotion. The food was delicious and they have lunch specials which make it very affordable. I started talking to the owner about Yelp and she was telling me how the old reviews are from an old owner. She was so sweet  and said ""look the place is spotless now"". They also have karaoke but I haven't been there on karaoke nights. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves thai and asian good.",vceNZbXaJH1vvxsChvcUyg,0,0,5,gdHamuVS8Y3FCLpj81179Q
291489,2011-09-24,0,g3wJ3T0ksO4xgDS6KIDY1A,"Wow. Really bad. First off, I went in for takeout on a Friday night, and there was not a soul in the restaurant. I sat at the bar, because there was not so much as a hostess to greet me. Finally someone came out and I paid for my takeout, she then said it would be just a few minutes. It was 45 minutes I waited for nearly inedible food. 
45 minutes for takeout is inexcusable and for the food to be awful after that is atrocious. Don't go here.",dOBVvU3YFkGjlAAtyKO2dQ,1,0,1,hdLSoWTvOaOcerhe0nXetQ

769827,2012-08-16,0,g3wJ3T0ksO4xgDS6KIDY1A,"I went here for lunch this week. I read the reviews and was skeptical but I heard they had new owners. I had a great lunch. The place was very clean and the owner came over to the table and introduced herself which I thought was impressive. 
The lunch portion size was very generous for $6.99 and I like the fact they are open until 4am. 
Good luck to you and I will be bringing my family back for dinner.",u9tKOnxJzd4O_BC-6NixNw,0,0,5,1dOWs1g4wH4HwNCO4XhprA
1857529,2012-07-11,0,g3wJ3T0ksO4xgDS6KIDY1A,This always happens to me. I go back a second time to a place after a great first meal and disaster strikes. The Chicken Pad Thai looked good again and that's where the comparisons ended. This version tasted funny right off the bat and had a soup-like thing going on under all the noodles. There was also a distinct fish odor this time which wasn't present last time. The pieces of chicken were smaller again and they weren't really showing their presence in the dish. I had about eight forkfuls of this before I tossed the $9 away and took the loss. Maybe there is a reason that nobody is ever in the place when I get take-out. Time to move on again.,ELcQDlf69kb-ihJfxZyL0A,2,0,2,QDbAvbiArLL-pyOI5MS1Rw

2315684,2009-03-07,0,g3wJ3T0ksO4xgDS6KIDY1A,"I was here during Christmas week 2008 and the food was okay. They gave my friends and I VERY LITTLE amount of noodles. I ordered some kind of spicy seafood noodle soup, it was around 10 bucks, I finished it within 10-15 minutes. The soup was good, but they were really greedy on the noodles. I was NOT full at all, I had to eat some food off of my boyfriend's plate. I will not be coming back at all.",m6yY60x48WgOUKuQGmcNLw,0,0,1,DrFeZ1i9AeScPgZFHFKQVw
2575689,2011-12-08,0,g3wJ3T0ksO4xgDS6KIDY1A,"The place was one of the open late restaurants not on the strip, so we decided to go. It was maybe 11:00pm, nothing too late. We had been craving thai food for a long time. We ordered everything seemed really nice, a little spicy, but I kept smelling the faint smell of urine coming from my dish. Enough to make me stop eating it. I am no expert on Thai food, so maybe that's normal. But I kept thinking I wonder if there really is urine in it... so yeah, I'm probably not going back.",GfwHukEfGxfBGQfmGQIiCw,0,0,2,oO4fj8Qwf9AMlWFlZgVFQA
2867458,2009-04-29,0,g3wJ3T0ksO4xgDS6KIDY1A,One of the best lf Vegas. HUGE MENU! Everything is great. I have ate here many many times. The Waitress Gaye is the best ever I thnk she no longer works there. Unfortunately last time I went they quit serving alcohol which is a big dissappointment. They also have thai karaoke which is hilarious.. They still open till 4 am which is awesome as well. VERY VERY GOOD! its not lotus of siam but lotus is only good if u know what to order. Here it is easy to choose. The Chef is super cool and always remembers you.,E3-bcRsTtyICecnHxJOGlw,0,0,4,ymN4R39GLfcSeFZdCLX3lw
3294503,2011-10-14,0,g3wJ3T0ksO4xgDS6KIDY1A,We order from alot of restaurants in Chinatown.  Tonight was my last time.  I have orders w/ beef instead of the chicken I ordered.  No cashews in the cashew chicken.  This evening no sauces for the egg rolls or expensive tempura....they don't check the orders before sending them out.  I'm done.,0urjI2eySUkIjs1oDi9_mQ,3,0,1,Y9rQY9DV0m1g8GB98bdenA
3832868,2011-08-30,1,g3wJ3T0ksO4xgDS6KIDY1A,"So I was out late last night...ok real late lol and this one Chinese restaurant I used to like that was open late looks to be shut down ;/ So I decided to drive towards china town as restaurants there are mostly open late. On the way there I passed little Bangkok and noticed a few cars in the parking lot.
 
I went inside and was the only ""Falang"" there ;p  (Thai term for Westerner which is also there term for guava fruit because it was brought by Portuguese traders over 400 years ago) - yeah I looked it up ;p

There were many Thai people in there and even had karaoke going on which was cool. I was really hungry and asked for recommendations from the waiter. He directed me to the special northern sausage plate and then I wanted a soup as well so I ordered he shrimp coconut curry milk soup maybe a ""Tom Kha Shrimp"". I of course had to order the fish cakes, because what's an Asian meal without a good fishcake!

The fish cakes (4) came out and they were pretty good as far as fish cakes go, nice green onion and the usual squishy bite.. Love this stuff.

The ""Special Northern Sausage"" came out with 4 sausages with some cabbage, ginger, peanuts on the plate. It was a ""rustic"" sausage with chunks of meat and such, a little sweet and a little spice. All in all a good flavor and enjoyable.

The ""Tom Kha Shrimp"" was the best soup I had had in a while. It was a little spicy from the curry, sour probably from the fish sauce and lime. Yet it was creamy and sweet from the coconut milk, an all-around great combination and it was ""off the hook"" nommy!

I told the waitress that I enjoyed the food very much and the lady chef came out and asked how things were. I explained the fish cake was good but still a fish cake, the sausage was great and the soup was the best I have had in a good amount of time. She was very pleased.

They gave me a menu with a 15% off coupon for next time I come, and I will. I suggest you give it a try if you like Thai food or want to try something new.

4984405,2010-09-26,0,g3wJ3T0ksO4xgDS6KIDY1A,The boat noodle soup entree and smoked pork appetizers are great. This place is great and worth a cab ride from the strip. Bring cash because the credit card minimum is $25.,yYAjnGg9nNcC98ri_0dk-w,1,1,4,8-RlWegWjtNpgTZDKo-rrA
5520561,2011-09-13,2,g3wJ3T0ksO4xgDS6KIDY1A,"Stopped in today for lunch after not having been here for a while, and I'm sad to say that the place has really gone downhill. 
While the lunch specials are really cheap (only $5), the food kind of sucks now.  :(
The Thai iced tea was so sweet, that I didn't even bother finishing it.  The egg drop soup that came with lunch looked, and tasted pretty unappealing (didn't finish that either).  The pad Thai was super sweet, and kinda gross as well.  It wasn't  topped with crushed peanuts, and the flavor was off overall.  
The spicy basil chicken was bleh as well.  They used a basil that had a really rough texture, it seemed kind of like it had already dried out some before they decided to put it in the dish.  They put in so much of that basil  that it totally overpowered the dish, and there were more stems in it than leaves.  The visual presentation of both entrees was poor, and the server wasn't very attentive, even though we were the only people there.  Whatever, I guess watching his soap opera was more important.  
To top it off, the whole place is in need of a major remodel, and the bathroom smells like something is rotting in there.  
Hate to say it, but I'm going to take my business elsewhere.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,4,0,1,eT2XjhH-w-8YBMqMPLvRig
