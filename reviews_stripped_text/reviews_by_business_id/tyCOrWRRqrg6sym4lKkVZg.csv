The staff was really nice, and went above and beyond to make an off-menu breakfast burrito for me. Yes, yes, it is pretentious and against Foodie rules to go into a new place and ask them to make something they don't make. Whatever! I was out of town on business and I wanted some comfort food for breakfast.",5vTaiN76J39IhloxKci2CQ,1,1,5,ibncDuID-zBdwFsXNt_7ZQ

I've been coming here for about 5 years. I almost always get a carne asada burrito, and it's always delicious. I also almost always get some wedding cookies, which are amazing little delicious sugar bombs that aren't too sugary. Today, I branched out and got hard shell tacos, and they were messy and delicious. Their guacamole is more like guaca-salsa, but whatever. My only complaint with this place is that it's not open 24/7.",YHjehNNYPYccUI7Zumn6NA,0,0,4,E09pIsL7Gp92EP_R-y0jdw
1865222,2016-01-21,11,tyCOrWRRqrg6sym4lKkVZg,"The name says ""bakery""- and they do have cases full of baked goods. However, the bread my torta was on completely fell apart, so I'm not sure their baked goods are really that great. Snag a day-old bag for $1 if you're really curious.

The building also says ""taqueria"" along the side- and Mexican dishes do seem to be their specialty, as it's what the customers around me were picking up. But my torta was unremarkable with dry chicken and bland beans. Veggies were fresh, though and there was ample avocado.

But what brought me in were the bright new window signs featuring photos of fresh salads and sandwiches- none of those dishes were actually available though. In fact, the first FOUR items I tried to order weren't available!

Service needs work. I can deal with a language barrier, but when I wait ten minutes to place my order (because no one can multitask?) only to find out half the menu isn't available? Not seeing a reason to come back.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,11,2,5d6GcRmP6IxUH07CvyIgQw

Everytime I have ordered I felt that the recipe, style, quality, and presentation changes for better or for worse. I truly wish a Robertos would even show up and take over the location. That would sadly be an improvement.",5cxk_eDtMKHU7YOnZHzzsQ,1,0,1,48ajJfFQE3pB9EvjHD039Q
