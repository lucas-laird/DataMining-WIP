AMAZING PHILLY CHEESE STEAK.

I was starving and came here around 12PM. 
Place was pretty empty. Two other parties.
Lady who took our order was very nice. Said if we didn't try the Philly, we'd kick ourselves in the butt. I was going to order a Philly cheese steak anyway, so I did. 

Philly Cheese steak+mushroom+bell pepper+onions+BACONS
Everything about the meal was perfect. 
The bread was toasted and had this fluffy consistency to it.
It held everything together quite nicely. It was AMAZING.
Fries were crispy and nice. 
Only regret I have is not going back there the next day for more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Paid about $10 which included tip. And I left feeling full as heck.",qM5-LTDO8ceGzYAtZWyufA,2,1,4,z_VWF8rTFmvZTQC0AWXPSA

Great deals! Big basket of chips and salsa for one buck. Philly cheesesteak around $5 or $6 (don't remember) and it was all so good. 

My bf has brought home the Philly for me so often but I've only been in the bar twice. And from what I can tell, service is fair.

If you answered yes to all of these questions then go here! I've been here only during midnight after a night out with friends. They have specials during this time for a lit price! I usually get the steak and eggs. It tastes great and for some reason their french fries are really good. It's a cool place to go with friends because there's two floors. The first floor is the bar and restaurant and the second floor is a pool area! Friendly service but food might take a while. Besides that you should definitely try it when you're out late at night. Also, the entire place smells like cigarettes immediately when you walk in, so if you don't like that then it's not the place for you.",M1pcZLW5wAjOyOZNVL8VKA,0,0,4,6pi_LE3nWmKM78fbQxNqyg

247410,2012-02-10,0,Apkr-qykgpUI5ltIw7B-7Q,"My last and final visit here was horrendous.  I used to frequent this establishment for the low-cost good food, and friendly service.  The last experience was the worst experience I had ever had in a restaurant.  The bartender/manager ridiculed me for the server's poor performance, she had gotten my order wrong twice and it was not even a modified item.  I ate 1/4 of the plate before I had realized it was the wrong order.  The bartender/manager was incredibly rude to me, yelled, and told me I lacked common sense, that I just wanted a free meal ($7.99, really?), and was very condescending with her questions to me.  Apparently, because I ate 1/4 of the wrong food, I was to pay for it and be happy with their mistakes.  The bartender/manager was so angry she started tapping her hand on the table telling me ""How it is"".  There is more to this story but I just dont have the energy to talk about how terrible other people are.  I manage a very profitable restaurant, and know that even when a guest is WRONG (which I wasn't) you are to accomodate them, and be polite, as they are potential opportunities to make money or lose money.  If I was the owner, I would be outraged.  Good luck, you should take a hard look at who's really running your place and clean up the staff.",KKOy30jkxGLE1JO5ovvVew,1,0,1,fOtAsnpcipP42hkwUlSsGw

We asked the staff if they could turn up the A/C, but they replied that their manager wouldn't allow them to. If management was to change that ridiculous policy it would definitely be a great place to go.

I always saw the glowing pink neon in the corner of the strip mall but never thought anything of it. But to be honest it isn't much, nor does it need to be much. its charm is really how chill it is. The crowd is always relaxed and enjoying themselves, the place is never packed but never empty and the staff is always very friendly. The are open 24/7 as are most bars in Vegas, and they offer food that is surprisingly good considering the strip mall bar motif. again its not amazing but for what I would expect out of the location its great. and the happy hour specials are really good.

Must tries are: buffalo wings, chicken finger sandwich, and the ribs that literally fall off the bone and have this unique flavor to them that i still cant pinpoint, but then again i dont think i want to.

I wish I would have said I wasn't in the mood. 

The service was great, so let's leave it at that and get it out of the way. 

I ordered the 1/2 rack ribs meal with a baked potato and salad. Chris ordered one of the hot sandwiches, which I can't recall right now. 

The taste was decent but it was better the last time I had it. The ribs were very tender and fell off the bones. 

The salad was a good portion, and with the low lighting, everything looked great. It wasn't until the end of the salad that I noticed all the BROWN WILTED SLIMY pieces of lettuce. Had the lighting been better, i would have likely seen that from the beginning. 

Chris had no complaints about his sandwich during the meal. 

We don't live THAT far from the bar - it took from finishing the meal, paying the tab, driving the 10 minutes home before I was hit with the aftermath of my meal. 

Good thing we have more than 1 bathroom, too- cause apparently we were both hating life for a short while. 

I was up and down all night with some additional puking the following morning. Chris said he felt ""ok"", but was sick all day the second day after (we can't be sure it was from that meal, but it could have been part of it).

My buddies and I were hanging out and was hungry.  One of them suggested Philly cheese.  2am? Philly? Make it happen!  We migrated here assuming they were still open and of course they were.

Bartender was very nice, doing his job he carded all of us.  Yay! we still look young! Woot Woot!  He asked if we like anything to drink, but we just wanted food.  He gave us a few waters to take with us to the table.  Seating area was small, simple.  Chairs and tables.  Obviously, we came for philly.  Easy? No, there were different options.  (Added bacon, extra cheese, etc).  Kept it simple went for the regular.  

Few moments later, time to eat.  Philly was served in a diner type way, basket with pickle, side fries.  Took one bite, not too bad.  Slices of meat was cooked well, but could use some more cheese.  I pictured cheese gushing out of my first bite.  My buddy, who is a philly fan, didn't think too much of it.  So I guess we are on the same page.  Worth a shot.

Ive been known to knock back a couple after a hard test here or come by to watch a game.  The waitstaff is always pleasant and they have free wi-fi in case your putting the finishing touches on a term paper (because I always need beer to get me over the hump.)

The Stake Out gets a nice mix of people from students to faculty to after work professionals.  Everyone feels comfortable there.  Not the kind of place to come just for food but if you're having a beer or three its a nice compliment.  Overall a solid joint.  Never played the video poker inside but word on the street is its a little tight.  

PS- If you pay by Credit Card, they have this goofy system where you have to write your tip or tell it to your waitress so she can add it before she runs it.  I always am put off by this because I feel it influences me to leave a higher tip than I normally would.  Now I always pay by cash to avoid this.

The atmosphere of the place feels more like an older neighborhood bar as opposed to the bars one would usually find around the university area. It's really dark inside, and the walls are decorated with a mixture of sports paraphenila and old movie posters...classic rock is almost always blaring from the jukebox, unless a football game is on.

The staff is pretty helpful...and consists of a staff of blonde waitresses who were probably working there when the place opened however many years ago.

As for the food, it's not too bad. I personally only ever order the daily specials, which are usually pretty decent. Sunday is the best day to go, as they have the $5.49 All You Can Eat Spaghetti and Meatballs w/ Garlic Toast. Totally delicious!

The Cajun Chicken sandwich is also pretty good, as is the hamburger. I'd steer clear of the Chips and Salsa though, unless it's happy hour, because they really just taste like Tostitos Chips and Salsa.

Upstairs, there's a couple of mini pool tables that are only .50 a game that seem to be unpopulated most of the time. It can be a nice quiet hang-out if you're looking to get away from people on the second floor.

I also can't go without mentioning how awesome it is that there are machines in the bathroom that sell condoms and small pamphlets with different sexual position guides. Unfortunately, this isn't something seen too much anymore, and for some reason it's always a nice touch.

It's been 7 minutes now and we still haven't gotten our sodas but she was busy lounging at the bar doing something with her phone.  Obviously she totally forgot about us but still had plenty of time to play on her phone.  I had to go up to the bar to remind her we were still waiting on our beverages.  I was amazed at her poor service.  Remember there was no one else eating.  Finally we got our beverages 10 minutes after we sat down.  We ordered two cheesesteaks with bacon.  We received our subs 12 minutes later and she forgot the bacon on both of our subs.  I was famished so I just ate it.  The food was extremely subpar and probably one of the worst cheesesteaks I have had in this town.  They only have white American cheese for their cheesesteaks which didn't help at all.  She basically ignored us the whole time and never came back to see how the meals were.  Of course we had to go to the bar to ask for a box and our bill.  She was polite but her service was lacking.

No chance.  She goes to put in their order and proceeds to talk to bartender.  We decide to go somewhere that wants our business and as we get up to leave still no one says a word to us.

I won't speculate as to why we got such horrible service.  It looks like a decent neighborhood bar with cheap drinks and greasy food, exactly the kind of place we are trying to find except it would be nice to actually get drinks and food.

The drinks (which is the main reason I go here) are excellent, mixed drinks never watered down (unlike many station casino bars), and are served quick. The waitresses are always nice, and the service is top notch. Add points if you're a regular customer, they always remember you. Also, the juke box is a very nice touch.

I like this place too, because it is almost never really too crowded. Certain days it does get busy, particularly when there is some kind of event going on near the school (i.e. Rebels basketball game), or has college kids celebrating after a finished day of finals.

Stake Out is a Buffalo Bills bar, so naturally, a wave of depression and crushed dreams hit you as you walk in the door. Don't let that deter you. There is good to be had. They had specials every day of the week. The best being Taco Tuesday, where two tacos are dirt cheap and they are loaded with ground beef. Tacos not your thing? Arguably the best thing on the menu is the crispy chicken sandwich. It used to be only available on Wednesday, but due to popular demand, it's an everyday thing. 

Oh and yes, their Philly Cheese stake sandwich. Does it make you think you are in Philly? No, but it's pretty darn good. There are a ton of great food options here. Even if it isn't on the level of crispy chicken sandwich, you can sleep easy as you will get well sized portions.

What about drinks? Stick to beer. Seriously. I've never had a mixed drink at the Stake Out that was any good. I'm not talking about a bad Manhattan or a non spicy Bloody Mary. I'm talking about a messed up Jack and Coke. Seriously. Have I made that clear? Don't get mixed drinks. Plus, draft beers usually have some decent options. I like to get Sam Adams Rebel IPA on draft. 

Remember that personality thing I mentioned earlier? Stake Out has super sweet servers but don't be surprised if they need gentle reminders or if cashing out your check is a bit more work than you planned. If you are in a rush, I would probably ask for your check 15 minutes before you think you need to ask for it. This has been truth for lunch time and I've been at night when it's a bit better but same concept applies. 

Oh and it's smokey. But you probably figured that out by now. Dive bars wouldn't be divey without the air quality being at least 75% Marlboro. 

Why 4 stars with all these seemingly negatives? You didn't ask that question but I'll answer it. It's a dive bar, through and through, but the positive is great food and nice service. Yes, it's smokey and can be loud and service can be slow but I love it, warts and all. Give it a shot, you will too.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,4,1,4,hn51a1DtW_kKZo0GJPvB2w

However, I went there about a week and a half ago and sat at the bar with a co-worker around happy hour on a week day and was informed that we'd have to sit upstairs (since seats with machines were only for players). They gave us an option to sit at the crotch of the bar, wedged between two machines, which was really a slap in the face. I've been coming to this place for almost ten years and always sat at the bar in front of machines and not gambled. In fact, most the of the people sitting at the machines looked like shiftless hobos and degenerates. I'd say it was only at about 30% occupation. I'm not sure if this place is falling on hard times or what.

Anyway, we declined and walked next door to the Freakin' Frog. We actually made it for their happy hour and got 2 for 1 beers. I didn't eat though since the food looked questionable at that place, but still a much better experience.

So it is kind of dimly lit and you can buy weird condoms in the bathroom and it smells like smoke but you cannot beat their lunch deals. Every day is different but Tuesdays have 2 tacos for $1.50 or something like that. A good value for some crunchy tacos. 

I have also tried their philly cheese steak which comes in a basket the size of french bread. I enjoy their philly although the meat is more like ground beef than thinly sliced steak.

Initially I saw some outlying reviews about the texture of a phillycheese steak and crunchy chicken fingers, but that seemed to be the end of the negative reviews with the exception of the ambience of this dingy hole of an establishment. 

However, throughout my experience here on a Wednesday afternoon I can't seem to figure how it took them 30 minutes with only 3 other patrons in the bar to take our food and drink order, we had to flag her down in which the server replied, ""oh, I thought I already took your order."" We did receive our drinks quickly, but noticed that our food sat in the window for 7 minutes before we had to flag her down again and ask if our food was ready. In which we had been here for an hour and 15 minutes before we actually got food down in front of us. 

The food and service isn't decent enough for me to return here. Their bland and soggy fries don't entirely entice most patrons unless you're down for that kind of thing. We spend most of our meal debating whether or not our chicken was undercooked because of the pink lights. 

My friend Kim would like to add that ""the wing sauce was not bad... I've tasted worse.""

We are honestly extremely confused at how this establishment has 4 stars as it appears like this is a normal for this place. Unless you are sitting at a bar stool, all dining customers are ignored.

On a plus side, I like the music.

The mood in here is extra dark, which can be a good thing if you're into that sort of stuff. The people in here are very nice as its mostly locals and regulars. Its a good place to catch a game because it is never too crowded in there, and the bartenders are nice where they'll change the sound to the gamecast if no body objects in the bar. The service of this place is brisk and quick, with very friendly servers.

As for the food, I'd hate to say this but it is only decent. Its one of those places where you definitely need to know what to order to have a good dining experience. However, one thing that they guarantee is that their PRICING IS ABSOLUTELY VALUE. Its one of those places where you can catch early dinner (before 7pm) for under 10 bucks (alcohol/tax/tip excluded). I give it a 5 stars because its pretty much thee watering hole of UNLV, which will always be special to me.

Some food items I would recommend: Cheesesteak, Burgers, Ribs, Happy Hour Chips and Salsa (only 99 cents to munch on with your beer), Happy Hour Wings ($3.50/4), Fries. 

Things that need work: Nachos, its not a very good one. Some daily specials (Chef salad, all you can eat spaghetti Sundays)

It may not have been the best cheesesteak I've ever eaten, or even had in Vegas for that matter, but it was a very solid lunch.  I went on a Friday afternoon during summer, so it was nearly empty.  A couple of dudes playing video poker, and every table was empty.  So, service was quick and attentive.  The server was very friendly and had suggestions, which is always appreciated at a place you've never been.

To eat, I had the cheesesteak with peppers, onions and banana peppers, which cost a quarter.  I went with the Cajun fries.  The server offered to bring some ranch, and I asked if it was homemade.  She said it was and it was great, and she was right.  It was a very good ranch, much better than any bottle.  She also offered the honey mustard as the ""best in the city.""  I had to give it a shot, and again, it may not be the best I've ever had, but it was a pretty damn good honey mustard.  

The sandwich was solid, but inconsistent.  The bread mostly held it together, but in places where it was wetter, it would lose integrity.  And, the cheese wasn't consistently placed on the sandwich.  Some bites had a lot of cheese (needless to say, these bites were the best) and some were dry.  When you get all ingredients, the sandwich is very good.  But, there were dry areas as well.  The fries were good, and you get a heap of them along with 2 pickle spears.  Very fair price for the amount of food you get.  The specials looked good, and all of them were cheap.

The atmosphere at Stake Out is fantastic. Everyone I have met there is willing to socialize with their groups, as well as the strangers around them. The bartender, Gia, will make anything you want and is always up for a challenge. There is a waitress there, Summer, who is not only hilarious, but has a very warm personality. She tries to get to know her clients and make everyone feel right at home. Jim, the owner, takes pride in Stake Out. He comes in every night and can always been seen helping out behind the bar or serving the patrons. Quality guy for sure. The old time pictures and Christmas lights also add charm and uniqueness to the venue that gives it a very homey feeling. 

My friends and I have never eaten a bad meal. Everything we order comes out quickly and tasting great. I would definitely suggest getting a cheese stake, it's definitely what they are known for.

Finally, Stake Out offers some of the best prices in town! It's not many places that you can get a cheese stake with fries for around $8, and a pitcher of beer for around $10.

The bar is two stories: the first where the bar is obviously located, and tables and booths to sit down to have a meal if you don't want to eat at the bar itself. Upstairs is the pool hall and social area for drinking, eating, and other miscellaneous things. Stakeout is unique in the sense that it's two stories and you don't feel like you're in an overly crowded atmosphere, even when it is busy.

Their food is on the heavy side with ingredients, so it'll leave you feeling pretty satisfied walking out the door. The Philly Melt is one of the more popular ones, and after trying it, it has to be one of the best sandwiches I've had on their menu. I'm not too crazy about the French Dip, for the au jus that comes with it is flavorless at best, and the meat along with the bread is pretty bland. Otherwise from that, you also can't complain about the buck dollar chips and salsa.

I prefer the taco salad!",FOFKuCoclgR0zAlVe7i1Zg,1,0,4,hKp-SuO4tlHhFUyADkkluA

Jim is an awesome bartender that works graveyards there, though we only met him once.",8m_Z5WrNv_Kjpv4T0yihnA,0,0,4,96P0hh3lSuGvkTHCd4QCbg
