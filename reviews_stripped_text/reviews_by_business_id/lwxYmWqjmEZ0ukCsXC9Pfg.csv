50652,2017-05-15,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,Amazing! Tried the Chicago pizza. Make sure you give yourself Iots of time this pizza takes a while to bake. Good things come to those who wait. Tried the garlic cheese bread while we waited. Billy the bartender was friendly even though we only ordered water. Gotta hydrate. Much like most of Vegas very large portions. We ordered a feed 1-2 size and only finished 1/2.,bdrhYOsP7GfQJEFAjFmZQA,0,0,5,XzjmxYo8HDJpzkc6ZLHlkA

80898,2017-10-20,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"This place had one one the best pizza's I ever had.  Only down fall is you must wait around 45 minutes for it.  They tell you up front, so don't be surprised.  Don't go here if you are pressed for time.  It was well worth the wait.  We had their Small Deep Dish with Sausage.  It was outstanding.  For an appetizer, we had their Bruschetta.  The Bruschetta was practically a meal by itself.  Big plate loaded with tomatoes and sliced mozzarella cheese on a nice mini toasted bread.  

They have two different locations in the Grand Bazaar Shops outside of Bally's.  One is an outside seating area located in the middle right after you come down from the escalator  from Bally's.  The other one is at the top of the escalator and is an indoor location.  Use indoor location when it is really hot outside.  We definitely will be coming back to this place.",Hc0v8M1RP6sUuFQ2_zLP6Q,0,0,5,_pF_vOtULUUqWt-ILAKWQQ

My boyfriend and I happened to go there when the AC was out, so the hostess brought it to our attention before seating us.  We walked in and didn't feel like it was that hot at all....and I was really craving the pizza anyways! 

So, we got a table next to the window with a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. We ordered the small deep dish with pepperoni and mushroom.  We were aware that the deep dish takes about 45 minutes, so we decided to order garlic parmesan fries to hold us over.  The fries came out fairly quickly and they were fresh and tasty.  Being by the window really helped in passing the time, as we got a chance to watch the fountains.  

The pizza came out at about the 45 minute mark and the server served it to us with that infamous ""cheese pull"".  It was everything that I expected in a great deep dish.  The crust wasn't to thick, sauce ratio was good, lots and lotsa of cheese and yummy pepperoni and mushrooms!  The slices are pretty big and being deep dish....very filling.  I only could finish about a 1/3 of my slice and my boyfriend only could finish one slice.  It was so good and I wanted to eat more, but I couldn't do it!  I think I was a little full off of the fries.  So, we took the rest of the pizza home for later.  When we warmed it up in the microwave it still tasted yummy!

We will definitely be back and might not order anything else but the pizza, so we can enjoy more of it!",_zhBvTS4Vh7CINbiavBoDg,0,0,4,ChsbT1EHvFbNYej-FeUC9Q

We sat there for over 45 minutes with empty beers as we didn't see him again until he finally showed up  - with the WRONG pizza. In that span of time I could have ordered from Dominoes.

132374,2017-03-05,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,I fell in love with Giordanos while visiting Chicago several years ago so i can't explain how happy I was to see Giordanos in Las Vegas on a recent trip! I was sat instantly and the wait wasn't nearly as long as any of the locations in Chicago. Service was fast to begin with but slow by the end of the night. I ordered the personal deep dish pepperoni and pineapple along with an Arnold Palmer. The pizza tasted just like the ones in Chicago. It was delicious and full of pepperoni and pineapple and cheese. For dessert I had the three cannolis. They were amazing and freshly made. Being in Las Vegas I thought the prices would be higher but they were very similar in price to the Chicago locations and I think even cheaper. I'm excited that I know longer have to go to Chicago to get this amazing pizza. Can't wait to be back!!!! Five stars on this one.,HgS1oA7UQA152IAx2Sj2gw,0,0,5,fIG0PJoX8f_2cZZQBIbhzA

The communication between the hostess and the servers were zero because the hostess kept seating people. Thank God we ordered an appetizer. We were not seen for 25 minutes, sitting with dirty appetizer plates and no drinks. The guy next to us went to the bar himself to get a drink. The table next to us just sat there too. It was a mess. I understood that you have to wait 40 min for a deep dish pizza. The comical part was when the server finally came back she dropped off our bill. I looked at her and said, ""we didn't even get our pizza yet."" 
I called the manager and he didn't even listen to our issue. All he said was, ""I will get your server."" Anyway, the pizza was good but it took so long we didn't even get to enjoy it. We had one slice and took the rest to go. We don't have a fridge or microwave so our pizza is now no good. I should've gave it one star but it's the Holidays. U guys really need to get your act together. Side note Carlos our busser was good. We gave a big tip to him. Our food should've been comped or we should've been given a gift certificate. This was completely unacceptable. I even thought the server didn't put our pizza in. I would've yelled holy hades if she didn't. Anyway, not sure if it was her first time serving, but a tip for two people who were previous  servers. Ask for HELP! Tell your customers your slammed and you are sorry. Don't ignore your customers...we see you.",74vMCWKA355hHKajGqYfag,1,0,2,N9i-Yb9JRGiGrzZ0nJ_f_w
212343,2017-04-03,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"My most recent visit to Giordano's Las Vegas (located on the Bally's promenade) was truly fabulous.

The decor feels next to nothing like Las Vegas, which I think is a compliment. You feel as if you're in a charming Chicago suburb with a view that just happens to overlook the strip. 

Every member of the staff couldn't have been more friendly, attentive and helpful. The Owner, Michael, is literally one of the most impressive Owners/Restaurant Managers I have come across as a diner. His passion for Giordano's and for taking care of guests is unparalleled. I used to work in restaurants and I have never come across a gem quite like him.

But, I digress, let's get to the food!

Our server and Michael recommended some appetizers for us and helped us choose a few salads that were Giordano's signatures. To me, salads are the perfect appetizer when one is about to tackle a deliciously dense stuffed pie as an entree later. We ordered the Chopped, the House and the Italiano and all of them were a unique experience. And, as explained by our waiter, all of them complimented their pizza in their own way.

Speaking of Pizza, we ordered a deep dish stuffed pie with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms and it was truly a symphony. Their sauce has a hint of sweet, with just enough spice and tang to play off of the mild flavors of the caverns of mozzarella that lie beneath. And the crust; that crust! It is flavorful and the perfect combination of soft and crispy in addition to somehow functioning as a mold for keeping the mountain of toppings in place. 

For dessert, we split a tiramisu that was fresh, moist and good all over alongside a surprisingly good cup of coffee.

I can't say enough good things about the food and the service. I'll be back many, many times.

Giordano's Las Vegas, you are a star.",wMPCencOjAXZIO8OHjF8Dg,1,0,5,68SaWt6nmQnF0GsuRlH_hA

I have never had service anywhere before the way she was. The place was packed and she kept her cool and between her and katilyn(?) they kept the bar running smoothly even with the getting everyone at the bar their food asap. Even if the food sucked which it didn't i would come back just to sit at the bar and eat with them there.

401061,2017-03-07,1,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"Flavors and configuration are, for the most part, legit Chicago pie.  HOWEVER... be judicious about toppings; more is not better.

AVOID the ""Chicago Special"" pre-configured selection, as the ratio of vegetables to sausage is serious overkill; we could barely notice the sausage 'wads' amongst the sea of bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  Plus, those vegetables have a lot of inherent water content, which releases when cooked.  This ended up sogging out our crust, which meant scooping up pieces of wet cardboard with our slices (see pic).

Lastly, this location should purchase enough pie pans to keep them on the table while serving. That is what they do in Chi-town, and it helps keep the pie warmer, longer.",-R3A-Lo__YzMUkka__ShHQ,0,0,3,l6aoy1iW4zGYilJZQTgrnQ

592113,2017-08-28,1,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"As part of a bachelor party, we ate here on a Thursday. A group of 5 guys, we were just looking to have some deep dish pizza.

Upon arrival, the restaurant is very hipster and modern in decor. I guess it's just part of being at Vegas. We were greeted with our server and we placed our order pretty quickly. Respectfully, he did warn us that the pizza will take an hour. We really didn't believe him but we were hungry so we ordered some fries to get started. 

The fries were pretty good, had good flavor and was a bit greasy, something you expect from fries. We finished that basket of fries an be at the end of waiting about an hour 15 minutes, the pizza finally arrived. Honestly, we were getting tired of waiting. So be forewarned that you will be here a while before the main entree arrives.

The server actually served us the slices, something I actually never experienced being a NJ/NY native in a restaurant. It was also my first real experience with deep dish pizza, so take that as you will.

The pizza slice was heavy. The crust was able to support itself still. Loaded, with cheese and sauce and bread, this one large pizza was perfect for our group, with two slices each.

My only gripe with the pizza was that it was poorly cut. The eight slices were not equal in size. Obviously I'm not expecting perfection here but some of the slices were extremely small compared the ones next to it. Typically, this wouldn't affect me when I'm with my girlfriend but I got handed the two small slices by bad luck. Not a big deal but I felt like I wanted a couple more bites.

Overall, this pizzeria has really good pizza for a decent price in Vegas actually. We had some at another place around the corner for a quick pick me up a couple days later and that was overpriced and tasted like frozen pizza. 

It loses a star for the long wait. We wanted to eat here or even but they take out urinal pizza but that would have taken 40 minutes to cook and we needed to leave in a bit for our flight.

Overall, good pizza but long wait.",RXT-cogR8t_8NUQXb1OcDA,0,0,4,QVPcps1BTZbQ1VHTICpzGg

When I got there at 6:00pm, I was shocked to see that the entire restaurant was filled! Apparently, a birthday party added to the crowd. It was recommended to me to order the pizza while waiting (30-40 minute wait to be seated, 45 minute wait while the deep dish pizza cooked). The other people in my party didn't arrive until about 6:20, so we ordered our pizza then and waited. We were seated shortly after 6:30.

Even though we ordered while waiting to be seated, the restaurant was so crowded that evening that they were apparently backed up on cooking the pizzas. It took a loooong time for the pizza to arrive, but when it did, it took the sting out of waiting so long. The large deep dish pepperoni pizza was excellent! Our server was friendly, fun and attentive in refilling our drinks.

The experience was great with the exception of the really long waits. However, I guess that is the price you must pay for getting excellent Chicago deep dish pizza on a busy night at the start of the weekend.

Giordano's is not my favorite Chicago pizza by a long shot (though it is my dad's and I have it at least once every time I visit him), but when you want Chicago pizza, you take what you can get. 

I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner because he wanted to try deep dish. Most Chicagoans that I know are not huge fans of deep dish; it's just kind of a Chicago cliche. Again, I wanted a taste of home, and he wanted deep dish, so we both lucked out. 

The wait for a table was about 45 min, so we opted to sit at the bar instead (we actually prefer it in most restaurants). Our bartender was fantastic and friendly, and had our order in fast. We shared a Harvest Greens salad, and of course had our deep dish with sausage, spinach and mushrooms. Pizza was perfect, and the salad was really flavorful.

They were having a promotion where they gave free chicken wings. Also, if you sign up for their email list on yelp you can get free cheesy bread or tomato bruschetta. My friend and i ordered the medium meat n more meat deep dish with added mushrooms. By the time the pizza came out, my friend and i could only eat one slice each because the pizza is so filling. We were happy to take home six slices to eat later that night. Giordanos is the best deep dish pizza out there!",wGGcoQeI8phehoYTr6oYIw,0,0,5,LSDMQyiEMy8K2z2vSp5Qsw

it is a stuffed pizza and its the ""same"" Giordano's
Staff: A+ and they all seem to have ties to Chicago
Food: A+ it is the same Giordano's 

Great modern Vegas design and look, located well in front of Ballys 

NOTE: Giordano's isn't for everyone! pizza is a personal choice of flavors and style (relax NY thin crust  people). 

My point, if you LOVE Giordano's this is a real Giordano's

if you have never had it, get a personal size pizza and dip your toe in the water, be prepared to wait about a hour for the pizza to cook",WmKsjZpbJwDpWB1EDATkHA,0,0,5,YUa70f2-iwC6pjjpUuvGAg

My family and I finally ventured out to the strip to check out Giordano's. The restaurant opened about 6 months ago and we have heard great things but have been reluctant to deal with the crowds. Plus, in our experience, a lot of restaurants on the strip have lack luster service compared to those off the strip/Henderson (probably because tourists can be annoying).

Well, I can say that I am glad that we went to Giordano's. On a Monday night (approx 7:30pm), we were able to get a table in less than 10 minutes. The Manager stopped by the table to introduce himself and to tell us a little bit about the restaurant. Our server was very nice, attentive (multiple refills on our beverages arrived before we finished our glasses), and he was up front about the pizza taking about 45 minutes to cook. So we ordered their calamari (and more) appetizer to start (which had calamari, banana peppers, fennel, and lemon slices). It was really good (light/crispy, not greasy) and I am pretty sure that my kids ate some of the peppers and didn't complain.

For our main/dinner, we ordered 2 custom deep dish pizzas, one with pepperoni/mushrooms and one with sausage/mushroom/peppers, and a kids pepperoni (on thin crust). I tried all 3 and Giordano's has the best cheese on any slice of pizza that I have ever had. You can put anything on the pizza but the cheese is the star. The crust is also phenomenal...reminiscent of a saltine but thicker. I also commented to my husband that it would be good with some apple pie filling!

We were so full after that we didn't get a chance to try the desserts but they have canoli and tiramisu, which we will have to try next time - because we will definitely be back!

The restaurant was nice and the bathrooms were clean which is a strong plus. The staff was amazing, our server made sure our drinks stayed full and checked in on us while we waiting for our order.

The Food: The Italian beef was good, my critique was the bread was not the authentic bread I am use to, and they toasted it which took from the sandwich I like my bread soft with a little chew to it. The meat and au jus was so flavorful it took the sandwich to another level. 

The deep dish was by far one of the best we ever had, it was cooked to perfection and was full of flavor. It defiantly passes the cheese pull test when you lift your slice up from the pizza. 

The only thing I was disappointed in with our whole meal experience was they brought out my husbands food while mine personal pizza was still cooking so b the time he was done eating about 10 mins later my pizza came out.

The service was the best. The server never asked me if I wanted another drink, he just brought it out, which is amazing, because I didn't have to stop feeding my face to acknowledge such. 

Please note that the bigger the pizza and more shit, the longer it takes for the pizza to cook. We must have waited around 40+ minutes for the pizza to get done, but worth the wait! 

Between 3 people, 2 mouths that eat more than the average person and 1 person who eats less than the average person, a large was hard to finish. We brought back 4 slices to the hotel, which 1 slice got demolished that night. With all the other foods in Vegas, highly doubt we will eat the rest of that pizza.

I couldn't believe how amazing it was. This was the first time I had an actual pie of pizza, the heaviest, most cheese packed, best crust slice of pie I had ever had 





I also had never seen a pie built in this manner. So the top is a layer is pizza sauce, below the sauce is whatever topping you want, then a very very thick layer of cheese and then the crust. By the picture you can see that the other part of the first easily breaks an inch and a half.

1570903,2017-05-02,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"I would give zero stars if it allowed me. Let's start by letting everyone know it takes 45 minutes for pizza, which is ok, I am used to Chicago pizza as I am a native. I prefer Lou's but figured it's been years since I have had Giordano's so why not try it and see, plus it wasmy granddaughter's 7th bday and she wanted pizza. So here we are...
The hostess upstairs and downstairs never offered for us to pre-order our pizza to cut the time in 1/2, even when the 4 of us were standing there and they could plainly see we had 2 kids with us. We put our name in both locations, so whichever dining area had availability first, we could be sat. You would also think since we did this and explained that we were putting in our name twice, they would offer for us to pre-order.
When we recd the text that our table was ready, I asked the hostess if the pre-ordered, she said yes, I stated it would have been nice to know that ahead of time.The mgr. standing at the host stand, questioned me that the host didn't offer it, I stated no, she did not. He apologized and that was that. He could or should have said, if you let me know your order, I can have it rushed, first strike.
We ordered our pizza immediately and let the server know we had more of an order but wanted to get the pizza in right away. We then ordered a salad for the table to share and a meatball sandwich since my husband does not like deep dish. I explained that we would like the sandwich with the pizza. At the time of ordering, I also let the server know that it was my granddaughter's bday. She nodded in acknowledgement. The salad was ok, nothing special, just a decent Italian salad, although it did take about 25 minutes for the salad to arrive. A little too long in my opinion.

Our pizza came about an hour later, we never said anything about the salad or pizza's timing as it was a Sat.night, it was busy, we figured we would give them some slack. BUT... we were all finished with our first slice of pizza before my husband recd his sandwich. Let me also let you know that we served the pizza ourselves, I have NEVER been to a deep dish pizzeria where they did not serve you your first slice and my grandkids are little so they eat slow. That is how long it took for the sandwich to arrive.

We questioned the server about it when she finally stopped by the table,she said they just forgot it upstairs and it would be right down, 10 minutes later, I am looking around for the server to see where the sandwich was, and the manager saw me looking around and came over and said the sandwich was on it's way down now. 5 minutes later it arrived. Strike 2

When the server finally came back after the sandwich was delivered, our plates were empty and stacked as we sat there while my husband ate by himself, and then she finally asked how was the food, well not that great but seeing it took over an hour for the pizza and longer for the sandwich we ate it anyways, plus she never stopped by until we were done. Even my grandkids didn't like it, and kids like ALL pizza. 
Pizza crust was flavorless, as was the pizza sauce, and there was hardly any sausage or mushrooms on the pizza. Husband said the meatball sandwich was just ok, again nothing special. 
The server was not very friendly, more of an order taker, and nothing more, hung out in the room where they get drinks and put in their orders more than she was on the floor taking care of her customers. 
We took the pizza with us and gave it to a homeless person, since we were staying in a hotel,but the final strike was that she never did anything for my granddaughters bday and they charged us for the meatball sandwich. By the way the mgr. that came over once to say the sdw was on it's way down right then, but it really wasn't never stopped by again, nor did he apologize for them forgetting to make his sdw as we all know they didn't just forget it upstairs, it was never initially made. Guess I will not try the one in AZ where I live after that experience!!",u4l6I2NAdUxwGOYRQXtKJw,0,0,1,rEArAMe7nDI7txj928V6OA

We sat right away and our pizza was ready within 40 mins. I highly recommend their boneless buffalo wings. They taste so goood + they keep u busy till ur pizza is ready. The most amazing thing about their deep dish is that the crust is a bit crunchy. Usually with deep dish pizzas the crust gets soggy. I a medium pizza was more than enough for the 2 of us.

They have both covered patio and indoor seating with friendly service. Deep dish does take some time to cook (expect ~40 minutes from when you order), so we had some mozzarella cheese triangles and garlic cheese bread while we waited. I really liked the cheese but could have done without the bread, despite their menu making it seem amazing.

Two of us shared a small deep dish and only managed to get through 4 of the 6 slices. They're also willing to go half and half on the toppings, so we did bacon/onion and pepperoni/sausage. The crust is tasty and probably the best you'll find in Vegas.

Well...that wasn't quite the case.  I was staying at the Bellagio so I decided to try the one across the street. Kind of a weird setup - outdoor seating/bar with the kitchen somewhere offsite. The servers were less than friendly, not welcoming at all. I mean come on, you're in a huge tourist attraction, it would better serve you to at least be fake nice 

I was so excited for my pizza, I knew exactly what I wanted. So I ordered my create-your-own. I thought afterwards: I wonder if the waiter knew I wanted the stuffed pie instead of regular.  When I stopped him moments later to confirm, he gave me a bit of an attitude and said, ""We don't serve that after 10pm."" Well that would have been nice to know, perhaps at least printed somewhere on the menu.

Regardless, I got a ""regular"" pizza with my usual toppings. It was still good (not the great pie I was expecting) but I was highly disappointed in the service and lack of food options.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm going to bypass this establishment and find a Giordano's elsewhere.",YSPwb5_9D96yNaB68psHYg,0,3,2,8OvvK2mLAIIP1W0HJt4ZMQ

WARNING, this place is not only busy with a waitlist, but each of their pizza pies takes 25-45 minutes as they're made to order, from thin crust at 25 min to their famous deep dish being a whopping 45 minutes. As soon as you put your name down, definitely get your order ready to put in and hope you love talking with your dining group because it's going to be a very long wait.

In 100 degree plus weather. And they only had OUTSIDE seating. They get effort points for having it covered, and having misters, but the mist was mostly towards the ceiling and unfortunately did not do enough to counter the heat. 
They were very good about bringing us water, which was vital, since we were sitting in the heat for  an HOUR and a half. 
Let me repeat. We were sitting there for an HOUR AND A HALF. They tell you to expect a 45 minute wait to cook your pizza. We waited TWICE as long for our pizza. And when it finally did arrive, all I could taste was salt. The cheese was salty. The sauce was salty. The crust was salty, and obviously the pepperoni was salty. The only thing not salty was the pineapple bits, sprinkled sparingly around the pie. I couldn't even manage to eat one slice. Maybe it was the heat, but my body started to revolt after salty bite #2. 
I brought my leftovers home and will attempt to eat some again after I know I don't have heat stroke and stomach hunger cramps from an epically long wait.

We ordered appetizers and drinks while we waited for our pizza. Their house salad and buffalo wings took a while to come out too but it was well worth the wait along with the pizza. We had the small Chicago classic deep dish pizza (23.75$) which was the perfect serving for three people. It came with pepperoni , mushrooms , green peppers and onions. We ordered ours without onions but it came out with no green peppers instead. We didn't really mind eating the onions or not having the green peppers (it would only be a problem for us if one of us were allergic to onions) plus it would be a hassle to take back the order and wait another 45 minutes for our new pizza to come out. The deep dish pizza still tasted pretty amazing though even with the onions.

Service was top notch and I love the ambiance they have. They have both an upstairs & downstairs along with a take-out booth. It's easy to find at the Grand Bazaar Shops @ Bally's hotel.

If you are as obsessed with cheese as I am, this is the place for you. The cheese pull on this pizza could stretch to the celling. And I'm not exaggerating, I genuinely believe that if you had arms long enough I think it would be possible. 

The flavor is amazing. I personally love the Super Veggie and the Chicago Classic and obviously ask for like 10 sides of ranch. Obviously the star of the show is the filling, cheese and sauce. But, I think one of the best things about this particular deep dish is the crust. It's flakey, buttery, and almost like a pot pie crust. So fantastic. 

If you do want to order a deep dish, be prepared to wait. It takes about 45 minutes to cook that thick bad boy. Totally worth it. The plus side is they have bomb salads and appetizers to chow down on while you wait for that cheesy, circle of heaven.

Next, I tell the bartender that I know the stuffed pizza takes about 40-45 minutes so I wanted to order right away. He puts in my order and about 20 minutes later I am presented with a thin crust pizza by someone on the kitchen staff?!? I ask what this was because it wasn't my order. He speaks to the bartender and the bartender tells me he screwed up and they would need to remake my order. I ask if that means I had to wait 45 minutes from now and he says it should be ready in 35-40minutes. This is while I'm sitting in a place with no AC and my arms are sticking to the bar because it's so hot. People are walking out during this because it was too uncomfortable. Now my wait is even longer because of their mistake. 40-45 minutes later I get my pie. When I finish I ask for my bill and there is no discount of any kind after all of this. Additionally, I was never visited by any manager to apologize for what had happened. They walked passed me numerous times but no one asked how I was doing or if everything was ok. Isn't that the floor managers responsibility?!? Extremely disappointed and expect more when I am paying $22.30 for a small pepperoni pizza!",RC1AyLRM-reF0h1IqG-eLQ,0,0,1,enO_8O2V1oxKtU094hUE6A

Perhaps I don't know what Chicago deep dish pizza is.  I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza.  Wrong decision.  BBQ sauce was waaay overpowering.  All I tasted was BBQ sauce.  I had no idea chicken and onions were included.  And the crust is kinda like a pie crust.  Way different than any regular pizza.  I guess it was my fault.  I thought maybe the next day it might taste better.  But nope.  In the garbage it went.  Luckily my $30 gambling win covered this meal lol.,hpWGgXs3vyDi5pj6H8MrhQ,0,0,3,pxD7FbH3u7z3uvIsgQxTOw

Was told 10 more minutes and was patient and waited. Another 15 minutes passed and asked again and at that point the hostess chimed in. She blamed us for getting a pizza and said we should have known it would take an hour. Our pizza was ready finally and we asked for it to go because we were done sitting there. The bartender seemed mad and wasn't polite once we asked for it to go. We paid and he didn't apologize or say a thing. On our way out the hostess snickered and walked to the bartender to clearly say something.

1949587,2017-12-24,1,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"Adam and I were walking along the strip during the day when the smells of this place got us. We knew immediately that we would be coming here for dinner because we knew we could not be disappointed. 

We did not make any reservations and came on a Friday evening around 7:30 PM. We were able to be seated right away at their outdoor seating which is exactly where we wanted to be seated. 

We were able to browse the menu and pick out our drinks and our pizza by the time the waitress came. We ordered the Meat and More Meat deep dish pizza and we both got cocktails. We were told from the very beginning that since we were ordering a deep dish pizza it would take around 45-60 minutes to receive our pizza. We have ordered deep dish at other places so we knew this was the case and we were okay with it. It took right at the 60 minute mark to get our food and let me tell you... it was worth the wait!!! There was a perfect ratio of every single topping and it wasn't too salty either. Being that it was deep dish we weren't able to eat a whole bunch because one slice is so filling but we both ate 2 slices and had left overs that we ate the next day. 

The reason why I won't give it five stars is because of the wait staff. I felt our waitress could be a bit quicker and a bit more attentive. We were done eating and ready for our pizza to be boxed up and given the bill and we had to wait for nearly 10 minutes for her to show up. Once she did every step seemed to take far too long. I understand part of the issue is that everything has to be ran from the restaurant to the outside area but somethings shouldn't take long. We were there for over 2 hours which is a long time, even when you are waiting for deep dish pizza. 

Overall, we had a great time, and I would recommend coming. The food was amazing but the wait staff could have been quicker. I think if we come back here we will eat inside of the main restaurant with hopes that service will be quicker because the staff doesn't have to run inside for everything.",tXMMYZQgczzZPIIhfV7jhw,5,3,4,NoWN7-0CrgrvDLNXplZJ5A

Everyone who knows me knows how much I love the Chicago food scene, which features these deep dish works of art as its centerpiece. This one here on the strip is every bit as delicious as those back in Chicago and has an awesome view of the strip to boot!

We were promtly greeted and seated at about 10:00pm on a Friday night (and not coincidentally on National Pizza Day!). Our server was very friendly and smartly suggest we get our food order in with our drink order since the pies take 45 minutes to bake! 

We went outside of the norm (I pretty much exclusively go with the meat meat and more meat), and tried the Small (6 slices) Chicago Classic, which is their take on a supreme style pizza. We enjoyed our cocktails while we waited and took in the great view of the Bellagio and the Bally's shopping area. 

When the pizza arrived, we were all overjoyed. It looked and smelled incredible and the stringy cheese was sooo hypnotizing! It tasted even better than it looked with a wonderfully sweet yet perfectly acidic tomato sauce and incredibly tender veggies to include onion, mushrooms and green pepper. 

We finished the meal with 3 delicious cannolis that had a light, crisp shell and a creamy, sweet ricotta filling. Just superb! 

Overall, I highly recommend Gio's on the strip for a great evening out. You'll notice that it's a bit more expensive than those in Chicago, but it's worth every penny to be sure. 5 stars!",WdezEW3GjYnCeOmTCxX1TA,3,1,5,20f30V1v-K0jq6olmzIFzg

As if pizza couldn't get any better, the classic deep dish Chicago style pie is loaded up with a ridiculous amount of cheese and toppings. The only downside to this location is that it's on the Strip, which can be a hassle to get to at times but there are some great views from their second floor windows and bar area.

The apps and salads are fresh and fairly light to keep you ready for the pizza, which is the real reason you came here. Each pie takes a while, so go with a fun group (also helps with pricing). Staff were super friendly and will try their best to get the best cheese pull for your photos! So far I've tried the Chicago Classic (pepperoni, mushroom, peppers, onion) and the Super Veggie (mushroom, peppers, onion, broccoli, spinach, olive), and preferred the latter- the cheese was so overwhelming that the added meats weren't necessary.

I have always wanted to eat a real Chicago deep dish pizza. I don't know how authentic this pizza was, but it sure did satisfy my craving for one! It's located at Bally's Las Vegas, in the grand bazaar shops busy right outside of the casino. The check in area is on the second floor, and it looks like they have a bar/outside seating area right on the ground level in the middle of the shops. 

The restaurant is pretty big. From the outside it looks tiny, but it keeps going and going and going. The menu is fairly simple. They have your appetizers, pizzas, salads and even more pizzas! We got the deep dish pizza and customized it ourselves. We added pepperoni, garlic and sausage. We also ordered a Caesar salad to share. 

Just be mindful that the pizza does take a bit of time because they make the pizzas to order. They list it on the menu and they also tell you that it might take a while, so you are well aware. The pizza was good. Sauce was nice and tasty and sweet, but not too sweet with loads of toppings and cheese. The Caesar salad was really tasty! Had a nice garlic taste and you could really take the anchovies.

When we got seated, it took a good 15 minutes for our server to come take our order. We asked if substitutions could be made on one of the speciality pizza's and he said no but we could do the make our own. So we tell him what we want on the make your own pizza but he then specifies it is a thin crust pizza. At that point, we decide we're just go with a small cheese pizza double dish with the toppings of our choice. 

He ask us if we want anything to drink and we tell him water. The restaurant is not that busy but our server forgets our drink order and after 10 minutes we chase him down and he promptly brings it to us. The pizza itself took more than 45 minutes to come out and even the table next to us was complaining.

Now when the pizza does arrive, I take a bite into it and the toppings (mushrooms, onions) that I ordered on the pizza are cold and even the dough is not cooked well. The sauce on the pizza lacked any sort of taste. My best friend's pizza also felt cold in the center. We both felt the pizza wasn't freshly made but instead pre-made and warmed up in the microwave. We were disappointed that we just took one bite and asked for the check.

I never met a pizza I didn't like but the lack of good service and the fact the pizza was not fresh makes me feel this particular establishment needs improvement. I will not be back..",ootiFwOHNxWxUX1kadu15g,0,0,1,qBIj8fiju0kJPY8-e7nYaQ

2097124,2018-02-19,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"My friend highly recommended this place because she had tried it in Chicago and loved it so we decided to have dinner here. The patio outside doesn't seat parties of 5 so we had to go to the indoor seating. We arrived at 7pm. The hostess quoted us for a 30 to 40 minute wait. We put a name and number down and pre ordered the pizza once we figured out what we wanted: deep dish chicken bacon bbq. While my friend was pre ordering the pizza,  I noticed a couple come up and put their name down for a party of 11 and a pre order. After 10 minutes,  we received a text at 7:20 saying our wait time was bumped up to 60 to 70 minutes. Then a minute later we got another text saying our table was ready. We were seated and told the waiter that we had a pre order already and he went to check on it.  

At 8:15, the table of 11 received their 3 pizzas before us. A table of 4 that sat after us as well received their pizzas as well.  We didn't receive our pizza until 8:40. When we asked the waiter why our pizza took so much longer than normal even after we preordered and came before the other tables, he gave us a half assed  answer saying they preordered and he doesn't know how the system works up there. The waiter noticed that the party of 11 got their pizzas first and tried to assure is ours would come soon. He kept dodging our table and would go around even though we were seated next to the kitchen. After we questioned him on the pizza time,  he stopped asking us how we were doing.

If the waiter or the hostess messed up on our order it would be understandable but they didn't tell us about it and tried to half ass a response instead of fixing it. The service sucks.  The food is good. I understand it takes time to cook fresh pizza but when you have to wait over an hour for food and see tables that were seated after you and they get their pizzas first,  then the taste of the pizza isn't really that worth it. My friends enjoyed the pizza because they were so damn hungry but I couldn't stop being irritated at the lack of etiquette and respect for the consumer.

2131428,2017-05-12,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"I've been to Chicago twice and both times I got deep dish pizza but had not yet had a chance to get to Giordano's pizza there, despite my Chicago friends telling me it was one of the better places to go.  I was quite excited to hear they were opening up one of these here in my hometown of Columbus, OH but when I was on the Vegas strip and saw the advertisement for Giordano's plastered on the side of the building I knew I would not want to wait until they came to Columbus and would be trying them in Vegas for the first time.

Arriving at the restaurant on a weekday somewhere between lunch and dinner meant there was no line or no waiting and we were seated right away.  My first thoughts was how really clean and modern the restaurant looked.   Despite being at an odd time on a weekday the restaurant was still mostly filled.  We were waited on promptly and started out by ordering an order of their Buffalo wings.  A short time later some very delicious looking wings came out and wow, they tasted even better than they looked.  In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb and say these are probably the best Buffalo wings I've had anywhere.  Very surprising as I was not really expecting it.

We went ahead and placed our order for one Chicago deep dish pizza (small) with sausage and pepperoni.  Our waitress informed us the wait would be, at minimum 45 minutes, which i was aware of having ordered deep dish pizza before.  So the long wait for the delicious pizza began.  Normally this is the part where one would drink beer and watch some sports but being in Vegas for a few days I had had my fill of beer so we just chit chatted and waited for the pizza.  While we were waiting the waitress did a great job of giving us refills on our tea and water and the manager, Eric Hamilton, was even nice enough to come and ask us how we had liked our wings.  I chatted with Eric a bit and he had noticed I was wearing a Buckeye shirt so he started to tell me about the Polaris opening, which I thought was nice.  He told us he'd come back and check on us when the pizza came out.  

Eventually, right on schedule, about 45 minutes in, the pizza arrive and wow, did it look spectacular!  Eric, the manager, actually came over and got our slices out and that allowed me to take some fantastic shots of all the cheesy goodness.  The first bite of the pizza proved that it tasted even better than it looked and all I could think of was wow, it's a good thing Giordano's is coming a ways away from where I live in Columbus or I'd be eating this a lot more often than I should!  It really was just that great.  The cheese was plentiful, it was very saucy and the sausage and pepperoni were just amazing.  It was everything I had expected it to be and more and we were very happy with it.  The Chicago deep dish is so much more filling and we couldn't actually finish the entire small pizza, so we took the last slice with us to give to a lucky homeless guy.  

The entire experience was awesome and I loved all of their food.  We will definitely be going to check out Giordano's once it comes to Columbus, this spring, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who has the opportunity to try it. Just a tip too, there is a Giordano's bar on the street that we were not sure if they served pizza or if it was just a bar.  You can get pizza there, we just didn't see anyone getting pizza while we were down there so we went up into the restaurant to eat.

So when my husband decided to surprise me and take me here I was super happy. But that happiness faded quickly.
We waited a good 10 minutes before our waiter greeted us.
It was like pulling teeth to ask for a cup of ice for our ice teas.
We put in our order 1st, deep dish pizza.
The pizza came after 45 minutes (which is normal)
I'm waiting for the the first slice to be served to me and he walked away from the table, SMH thats part of the experience.
So I served my family (that never had this amazing pizza before) my kids loved it.
I dug in and it was soooooo good taste wise but it wasn't hot, it was just warm. Waited all that time for a warm pizza, pretty disappointed.
I just wanted to leave.
I was waiting at the bar and the manager happened to be there, he asked how everything was and I explained to him of my disappointment.
He was great and offered a free pizza on my next time down (since I am local)

2291722,2017-09-04,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"""When a moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore"". Hmmz, I wonder if it's still amore Deano if I went along with the build your own individual sized pie? Well that gamble is certainly worth a roll of the dice. 

What was not a gamble is the experience overall at Giordano's. I do like the fact there is the actual restaurant towards the back of the Bazaar vs. the more casual setting towards the front. Depending on the time of year and weather at the time at least you have options. Safe to say since it was in the triple digits at the time of my outing I went with the restaurant experience and that suited me just fine as the table I picked had a bird's eye view of Bellagio in all its glory. So what a backdrop that was (too bad the window cover was on or I'd have surely snapped a picture to do the description justice).

I went about 4pm during the week and it was still relatively busy, but nothing too crazy. In this outing I decided on the individual stuffed deep dish which comes in 4 slices and is just the perfect portion size for one person to indulge in. Just be prepared that it can take up to 45 minutes to put together. The waitress made that very clear and as I said even in the tip I left you know what you're getting yourself into so don't hold that negatively against Giordano's as it's not their fault. Personally I'd rather have them take their time so I don't feast on uncooked pizza. That'll leave your insides with a jackpot you surely don't want to cash out on!

Ingredient wise, the pizza overall is a lot different compared to some of the deep dish pies I have had locally here in California. The crust actually was very light and flaky which really elevated things to a different height. I was not expecting that as I thought carb overload with all the crust, but it really leaves you feeling full yet not bloated if that makes sense? The one low point was the lack of cheese pull (more of entertainment value) with getting the individual size. I mean yeah it is what is I suppose, but if it was just me eating it why would I get a bigger size just to have that experience? I gladly traded that in for what is really important: taste. All the veggies and meat choices tasted fresh and nowhere near canned so that at least speaks for itself. What also set this pizza apart (which I know sounds weird) was the tomato sauce. The last variation of this I had came out tasting really watery, but their sauce is hearty and it lets the ingredients speak for themselves. All in all just a well prepared meal!

I am so happy after about three Las Vegas visits under my belt having to pass this up that I finally got to have the Giordano experience. I urge you in the event a craving for pizza in Vegas comes about skip the ""secrets"" of the Cosmo or the Sbarro's of the Monte Carlo's and come here for a real treat.

The place was pretty empty but we realized it was because people preferred to sit in the downstairs patio area, which we probably should have done for the experience. 

WHAT WE ORDERED:
 
Italian beef sandwich - had good flavor but was a bit salty for my taste

Margherita pizza - we didn't realize this was under the thin and crispy crust. I didn't mind it but everyone else didn't like that it was crispy and flakey like a cracker.

The Chicago classic deep dish - delicious! Ooey gooey and oh so cheesey!

Fettuccine alfredo - sounds like the most basic thing we ordered but it was actually the best dish! It was HUGE for starters. We liked that the pasta actually tasted like there was cheese. I hate it when Fettuccine just tastes like pasta mixed in cream.

I don't know if it was because this place just opened and they still have some kinks to work out, but our order took ridiculously long to come out. Well over an hour!

The timing was expected, but to have the dish we got warned about the timing to come out FIRST? That's odd....the rest of us ordered sandwiches, pasta, and the pot pie thing and waited a good 5-10 mins after the pizza came. The pasta was UNDERCOOKED, cold, and some were really hard. We ate it anyways because we were starving from waiting so long and we had already waited a long time for our food and didn't want to wait for a replacement if that was an option. We complained and the waitress and she spoke to her manager. When we got the check we got a 10% discount on all the pasta dishes!  Better than nothing I guess, but what a joke to wait so long for pasta and sandwiches only to have it cold and hard and receive a measly 10% discount. I can't say anything about the quality of the sandwiches bc I did not try it, but it definitely shouldn't be one of the last things out esp. when we were warned about another dish. The pot pie was dry, but the parmesan fries were good . If you come here expect long waits and definitely just order pizza. The deep dish was alright; I'd rate it a 3/5....i've had better",FL-o3WF42ih6pSEUyL3y_A,0,0,2,TkWOtRGQf749J7vn_OJMYw

Our waiter Markus informed us right when we sat down that it would be 45 minutes for a deep dish pizza, so we ordered it right away when he took our drink order. We told him to get the drinks and we would order the appetizers/salads. Well we got our drinks from a runner and didnt see our server until we got our check. I had to order a salad 45 minutes after getting our drinks from a runner. You'd think that if it was a 45 minute wait for pizza they would see if we wanted any appetizers or at least keep our drinks full the whole time, which wasn't the case. We got our kids food 15 minutes after ordering then waited an hour and 5 minutes for our pizza!!! We were the very first order of the day. By the time we got the pizza our kids were done eating and ready to go. So my husband and i ate a slice or two and got a box for the rest. We went to pay the check and left the box on the table weny back to get it and they threw our pizza away!!! The pizza we waited an hour and 5 minutes for and paid for. Service was absolutely horrible and the manager didn't do a dang thing, didn't even help his staff. It looked like only two servers were in the floor while we were there. The runners did more work than the wait staff and manager.

When I received the Greek salad, it had no Feta and no tomatoes. (Annoying). But the manager came over, explained they were out of feta and the kitchen forgot the tomatoes. He profusely apologized for the mistake and offered another salad but at that point I was hangry and just ate my delicious salad albeit without the salty tasty delicious feta I was anticipating. Then they offered a free dessert and ended up comping my salad AND discounted my pizza 50%. Mistakes happen, I get it. For me, it was forgiven in the recovery and the fact they were empathetic and made the situation right. Plus the food was boooooomb!

The only thing to be aware of is they make your pizza to order, so it can take about 45 minutes. You should plan on coming when you have plenty of time.

Our only complaint is that the service is hit or miss. Sometimes you get an attentive server who is friendly, quick to refill drinks, totally great. Other times....crickets. I think the fact that the pizza takes a long time to cook, customers get impatient, servers start hiding because they don't have good news about when the pizza will be out, service spirals downwards.

On a recent visit we sat at the bar thinking we would get better service. No. One bartender serving the entire restaurant, barely time to take an order, much less offer a glass of water. We hung in there, made some new friends on either side of us due to our shared terrible experience. Poor guy next to us ordered a thin crust which took over 50 minutes, stuck behind deep dish orders. The guy on our other side was waiting on an individual pizza and that took even longer. It would have been easier if our bartender was offering us drink refills, another wine, but he was in the weeds.

This is where a restaurant manager can really help the situation. Checking on tables, giving assurances, refilling drinks themselves (not having someone else do it), clear some tables, even get behind the bar and pour a few beers. A good manager can make a huge difference in the customer experience, especially on a really busy chaotic night.

Located on the second floor on top of the 24 hour Starbucks at the Bally's Bazaar area. 

I never had the famous deep dish Chicago style pizza (pie) and I finally got to experience it!
I went with family and we ordered their sampler that had garlic cheesy bread, chicken nugget ball shaped minis, tater tots that tasted like mac n cheese with bacon (my favorite thing! YUM!), and mozzarella triangles! 

For pizza, we ordered the Deep Dish Meat lovers and we also ordered the Supreme Veggie that usually goes on the Deep Dish but we switched it out for thin crust instead! 

There is a 45 minute wait on the Deep Dish pizzas but that wasn't a problem for us. Just to let everyone know!

Both were really tasty and I definitely enjoyed them! 
Overall the experience was ok, I wasn't really hooked on the pizza to want to come back anytime soon honestly. Our server was extremely friendly and extremely knowledgeable about explaining the items on the menu! I do have to mention that one of the receptionists was rather rude and the man that seated us at our table was even worse! Could be the reason why I wouldn't want to bring any friends or family back to this place.",K_b3RL36r6VvxOd2zrh71Q,1,0,3,i9er__shfBMQdbLyQBgZig

We went as a group of 6 and were quoted 45 min for pizza(they recommend you order prior to being sat) then an hour. 1 hour and 35 min later our pizza finally arrived after we ALL asked the staff numerous times where it was. The server didn't seem to care he kept avoiding our table after we asked first for the pizza and second for the manager. We had to ask 2 times for the manager and the server seemed annoyed we even asked. We don't have his name but he was about 25ish dark hair tighter black pants, tattoos on his arms and looked possibly Hispanic. The pizza was amazing just as I remembered from my first and only trip to Chicago but the service was unbelievably poor. The manager comped ALL our food we just had to pay for drinks. I bartended and waitressed throughout college and you have good and bad days in that line of work like all jobs. With this type of industry you own your mistakes and you make it right for the customer. It would've made it easier on us if he came over and said hey sorry my mistake something happened to your ticket so your pizza is delayed let me get you guys dessert on the house or maybe some more cocktails. Anything would've been better than the continual NOTHING he did for us. The server didn't wanna own it and just continued to avoid us and make up lies. He first said he couldn't find our order, then blamed the kitchen, then said he stole the pizza from another table. Good gosh way to piss off another table. In the end the manager(female blonde petite) was very nice and apologetic and took care of the food bill. We noticed a lot of tables being annoyed and the table next to us had to call the manager over to comp something too. We got there at 6 and we ordered right away and we saw NUMEROUS tables arrive after us who got their pizza and even paid and left before we could get ours. We were informed they called ahead for their pizza but we also ordered right when we sat down. We attempted to order prior to that but the hostess said we were about to be seated. The manager told us the issue is the hostess staff is taking pre orders and not recognizing the orders happening in store so the pre orders are coming before anyone and anything. They have great food but they need to work on customer service skills. The staff is young, oblivious and doesn't care. Sad.

Happened to be in Vegas and thought I'd give it a try.  Service was good, the deep dish does take 45 mins to cook but here there are some shops to look at if you get bored waiting.  It's outside and a nice spot to people watch.

As far as the deep dish pizza, it was really good but I prefer Gino's.  Love the cornmeal crust there and the tangy/acidic sauce.  Giordano's is a more plain crust and milder sauce.  Very well done but not my preference.  Would go again though if I want pizza on the Vegas strip.",y36BaIZSLSBjgN0XdRwE1A,0,0,4,GIUCSCPQDlEWapCA7Ro9-g

2724972,2016-12-15,2,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"Ahh, this brings back childhood memories.  Finally, one of two of my favorite Chicago deep dish pizza joints made its way to Vegas (the other being Lou Malnati's).   Located on the 2nd floor of the Bazaar Shops at Bally's, patrons can opt to eat inside in a nice cozy atmosphere with a bar area or downstairs outside where there were heaters to keep warm.  

Inside, we were treated with great service all around.  It seemed like the staff kept vision of our table at all times with the corner of their eyes.  Every time we finished an appetizer, they came right over to clear the table for the next dish to come.  Water glasses were always filled as quickly as we drank them down. 

Minestrone soup for starters was hot and hearty and it was a nice intro to what would be a delicious dinner.  Even my daughter's chicken fingers for some reason tasted better than the average chicken finger.   Of course, we came for the pizza.

This is not going to be your quick sit down, eat, and go restaurant.  From time of ordering, the server will tell you it takes about 45 minutes to make your pie.   It certainly isn't quick but it certainly is worth the wait.  Double flaky light crust, thick gooey melted cheese followed with all the toppings and pizza sauce on top.  As our server served out each pre-cut slice of pie to our plates, the signature cheese stretching from the pan  just makes your mouth water as you prepare to take your first bite.    The pie is so thick, make sure you're using your fork and knife for this one!

You can't really go wrong with any of the pies here.  If you love meat, the ""Meat & More Meat"" will be your best bet.   Pepperoni, sausage, salami, and bacon will keep your carnivorous self content.  If you so happen to desire to sway from the norm, salads, pastas, and Italian beef sandwiches round out the menu.

Overall, a nice experience, hardly crowded, plenty of food, reasonable prices, great service, full stomachs.  Welcome to Vegas, Chicago.  Your food is always welcome here.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,5,4,5,AhuQWx63n4oH4lxhDp1g8Q

We ordered the same thing as last time which was a medium thin pepperoni and a small deep dish special. Unlike our last experience, this time around the deep dish had plenty of onions, mushrooms, peppers, and sausages. Of course the amount of mozzarella cheese was insane! The thin crust gave you a mouth full of pepperoni in every bite. Yes, you have to wait a while for the any deep dish order but there are some things that are worth the wait and this is one of them.

We even tried the house salad and the cheesy garlic bread. Both were excellent starting appetizers to get your palette started. Afterwards we all shared a chocolate cake which lasted all of 50 seconds. Should we have ordered our own? No. Although my kids would have loved it, I have to put my foot down sometime. Just because you can doesnt mean you should.

Our server Goose did everything that was expected of a good server and then some. Even the manager Nick stopped by several times to make sure everything was ok.

In closing, most people complain that they dont get enough cheese on their pizza. Here you just might complain that its too much and thats not necessarily a bad thing. As a local, I usually try to stay away from the strip for obvious reasons but Giordano's is only one of the select few that me and the fam know that its worth going to.

We ordered the small deep dish Super Veggie Pizza ($27.33 including taxes) and asked for sauce on the side. 

The only sauce available was ranch. The ranch was not bad. It did not taste like refrigerated sauce and was not chunky. 

The pizza was stuffed with tons of vegetables and had less cheese than I expected. I was hoping for it to be a little cheesier on the inside. It was interesting seeing the pizza stuffed with broccoli. Luckily, the brocolli pieces did not overpower the other toppings. 

I really liked the crust! The whole crust was super crunchy.

With that said, this is the BEST Chicago style pizza I have ever had!  I have had many pizzas that are chicago style and I really like this style, but they all pale in comparison to what we ate tonight.   Giordanos states they started in Chicago & still have a restaurant there.  That's easy to believe because this was the most perfectly cooked Deep Dish Pizza I have ever eaten. 

We ordered a medium create your own with Pepperoni, Italian Sausage. Bacon, Mushrooms & Olives.  They warned us that it would take about 45 minutes, which was fine as 1). This tells me it is made to order & 2.). It's Vegas, no rush!   Since the medium feeds 3-4 people and there are only two of us, we didn't order appetizers.  We started with a pitcher of beer because hey.  Pizza & Beer!  

The crust was flaky like they coated the pan in butter and it soaked in (YUM!).  The sauce was chunky, tomatoey goodness.  Crisp edges , not too doughy or thick and amazing gooey cheesy goodness !  I have got to start working on how to replicate this!  

If you love pizza, you have got to try this.  BTW, the service is great as well (I got lost in remembering the tasty goodness to talk about the service.).",RKPYhVgEhfvr-TBzEEP9qw,0,0,5,yzBIMJLnNPA_JZnszJfmCQ

As a transplanted Chicagoian who travels a fair amount for business, I am always on the lookout for REAL Chicago pizza.  I make a habit of calling ahead and ask how long it takes to cook the pizza.

There may be a lot of touristy celebrity spots (which can be fun too) but there are always plenty of foodie gems both on and off the strip. I love the place.

My Wife and I decided to try something different this time we headed into the desert. We decided to take the kids, a venture that we were a bit unsure of at the time. Super glad we did.

We spent a little time researching family friendly restaurants and Giordano's came up on every list. We LOVE Pizza Rock but wanted to try something different and something we'd all appreciate. 

Honestly, it was probably our favorite meal of the trip and we hit a lot of good spots. We ordered the Chicago deep dish pie with meatballs. It was phenomenal! So cheesy. So delicious. Sauce was perfect. And the crust... Oh, man. Like a perfectly buttery, flaky pie crust. Very authentic. It takes 30 -45 minutes for the pizza to come out once you order (typical for Chicago style pies) but well worth it. The service was really good. Just one of those dining experiences that you really appreciate. Highly recommended.",zEfvWoqBiwJSQ_LReT8Fyw,0,0,5,QbcPwlmrvUBOKtjInDyatg

3023987,2017-01-08,2,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"I was looking forward to Giordano's ever since they first opened (and when I saw people posting the famous cheese pull on IG). If I ever went to Chicago, my first meal would be DEEP DISH PIZZA. 

The host offered me a buzzer, or to text me when my table was ready but I told her I would wait inside since its freezing outside. There's not much standing room inside and it was packed when other people started to come in. 

At first glance, the restaurant looks pretty small but it does wrap around. There's a pretty good view of the strip if you sit towards the windows, but if you don't then they have comfy looking booths in the back that can seat about 6-8 people. There's a big EAT PIZZA sign on the back wall which is good for taking pictures ;)
There's a wrap around bar with a bunch of TVs. 

Service was good, our server checked on us quite often but she had a lot of trouble hearing what we ordered because the music was pretty loud. Bathrooms were clean, but they need to put seat protectors in the bathrooms!

3/5 Caesar salad was average. There are 3 sizes to each of their salads... I think the first one is personal, entree and then family (serves 4-6) and pricing varied. The Caesar salad wasn't great, but it wasn't too bad either (how can you mess up a caesar salad?). It also came with a piece of cheese bread. My friends said there wasn't enough dressing but I'm sure we could have asked for extra dressing on the side. The entree size was a good started for 3 people. 

4/5 Garlic parmesan fries were SOOO good. We could actually taste the garlic AND the fries were crispy! One of the better garlic parmesan fries I've had, for sure. However, we got a lot of small pieces. It seemed like we got leftover pieces of fries or something like that. 

2/5 Pepperoni pizza. Their pizzas come in 3 different sizes and you can add different protein or vegetables to them for an additional cost. They also have hand stretch thin crust pizza (I'm guessing thats the regular pizza crust you find elsewhere) and extra thin crust pizza. I guess I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza because I found the pizza to be on the salty side AND it had way too much cheese for me. My friends did enjoy it, and they did not think it was salty. I found myself getting tired of the pizza after the first slice and towards the end I just peeled off the cheese and ate the crust and pepperoni. Also, the longer you let the pizza sit, the less good it good (obviously). We ordered the MEDIUM for 3 people. On the menu, it said a medium was good for 3-4 people and its pretty accurate. Between the 3 of us, we only ate 4 slices so had half leftover. 

Cocktails here are $11.50 but the pitchers of beer were about $16-17. We ordered a mojito and it had way too much mint and was a tad bit sweet. We also ordered a pitcher of blue moon. We were able to get about 6 glasses from the pitcher so its definitely worth it to order a pitcher if you're in a large group and everyone wants a drink. 

4/5 We got tiramisu for dessert and it was pretty good. However, I thought it was pretty small for $7. While I found it to be moist and soft, it was lacking coffee! It wasn't too sweet either, which I liked. 

Dinner for 3 with 2 drinks and a pitcher was around $80. Overall, we enjoyed our experience and will be back next time to try their thin crust pizzas.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,5,2,3,8B_4PefXT-QRJJNLXp7Rsw
3031295,2018-02-11,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,This location is a sad excuse for a Giordano's.  The service was slow and forgetful. The food was bland and overcooked. We ordered the grilled itailian meat in a pizza and the meat had no real flavor. The crust was overdone and dry. The only good on the plate was the french frys with garlic and herbs. We also ordered a deep dish with pepperoni and green bell pepper and that too was mediocre. Honestly I have had better pizza from Pizza hut. Now don't get me wrong I loved when I was in Chicago and ate at the original but this one was a sad attempt.

Prior to eating this in Vegas I had only had Giordanos delivered frozen from Chicago and it was great like that, but there is no comparison to having it fresh! I was sooo hungry so when we ordered I wanted to order a medium but my husband assured me a small was enough for both of us. When the pizza arrived (it takes a while but they let you know that in advance and trust me it's worth it) I looked at it, looked at my husband and I was like ""dude I'm totally gonna eat this whole thing by myself."" He laughed. No faith in me. But he was right, 1 and a half slices in and I was done. The pizza is thick with cheese that melts and stretches perfectly, deliciously robust tomato sauce, and the toppings of your choosing. The crust is so good, great flavor and nice and flaky.

Chicken tenders were tender. Fried cheese was fried. Cheesy bread was cheesy. Potato balls were balls of potato. Beer was beer.  Absolutely nothing to complain about. Yummy.

Thin crust, not too thin. Flaky not soggy. We got the meat lover and added some veggies. That was a mistake on my part. I listened to the old lady and I knew better. I blame myself for that one.  Should have only had the meat lovers. Anyways, layers. They later each incident randomly which is awesome. They stuff this bad boy with so much cheese, it's insane.

3046207,2017-01-01,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"Giordano's is one of our favorite restaurants to eat at when visiting Chicago so we were pleased to see that it had made its way to the Las Vegas Strip. While in town for NYE, we figured it was only appropriate to have it as our last meal of 2016. Our strategy was to eat here for an early dinner and have the leftovers for a late-night hangover snack (thinking ahead ).  We ordered our staple, The Chicago Special with added sausage, and also decided to try The Sample as an appetizer.  The garlic cheese bread on The Sampler was delicious as well as the loaded potatoes bites. Of course, our pizza was tasty. I always recommend adding giardiniera if you want an extra kick of flavor! The couple next to us saw us order it on the side and decided to try it themselves... they became instant fans!

The staff here was extremely friendly and our server, Leon, was great and accommodated everything we needed. I was also happy to see that this location didn't price gouge simply because they're in the heart of The Strip... everything was on par with what you'd pay at any of the other locations. They have two dining areas - one on the promenade and then the main restaurant.  I recommend dining in the main restaurant as it has an amazing view which is great for dinner.  We also noticed that there are retractable doors towards the back which I'm sure will make for great patio-style dining in the warmer months.

All in all, we were very pleased with our experience at Giordano's LV and will likely add this to our ""Go-To Dining When We Don't Feel Like Figuring It Out"" list.",LOhPtNsOYUqYQlTL5t9TQQ,2,0,5,OGPRM_u7ZjjYTdtlSLESGA
3046513,2018-04-11,6,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"Ah Giordano's my old friend. I lived in Chicago and used to appreciate all of the classics: Pizzeria Uno, Due, Gino's East, and of course Giordano's. It's nice to have one of the latter a little closer to home.

We had a late lunch on a Saturday and typical of Giordano's, they warned us that any deep dish pizza would take 40-50 minutes to bake. Not sure if they do it at this location but i know at some of the Chicago places they take your order ahead of time while you're in line, that way you don't end up waiting all that long for your food after you've been seated. Nonetheless we were seated right away and given the time warning at our table.

Since I can never agree with anyone on toppings (i.e. I don't like 20 things on or in my my pizza) I just got one of the individual deep dish pizzas. Truly the best. I got my pie stuffed with bell peppers and sausage which go perfectly with the sweet tomato sauce, the gooey cheese, and the flakey crust.

It was as good as I remembered. I typically frequent a thinner style of pizza so for me a deep dish is a splurge. The pie is basically filled with cheese, sauce, and any extras and baked to golden perfection. The individual pie can seem small and like it won't be enough food when it first arrives, but it's not a problem when you realize how filling each slice is.

The inside of the restaurant is considerably more modern than some of the Chicago locations which are more home style and have lots of wood paneling. The main restaurant is on the second floor of the Bally's casino at the entrance. There was also a to-go order window on the first floor right below, and a separate enclosed patio-type area with barstools, tables, and people watching opportunities in the Grand Bazaar Shops.

As expected in Vegas there's a considerable markup so we paid about $40 for 2 individual pizzas and drinks. If you've never had a Chicago deep dish definitely put this on your list, and if you have, it's a great place to re-visit.",tm2ZW0fMczxDCT_wyFJkww,10,9,4,6nnt2H1t5KAm9wRSDMQrEA

3077816,2017-01-21,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"I give this review a 2 star only because the pizza was amazing and if it weren't for the pizza I would give absolutely no stars to one of the most awkward and uncomfortable dining in experiences I have ever had. Let's start with the moment I walked in. At approximately 3:35p on Jan 20 we walked in and were never greeted so then I brought it to the hostess attention that I had called in an order and was told that the pizza would be ready. prior to this day we came in a week ago to enjoy a giordanos pizza only to find out that the wait time unfortunately was not a fit for my wrk schedule that night so the guys told us we can call in next time so that our pizza would be ready for dine-in. Back to the hostess today, she asked if we ordered it to go, I told her no one asked me if it was to go or for dine in so we would like to dine in. By the look in her face she looked annoyed to have to seat us and told us ""I have to ask a manager if it was possible for them to seat us"" as I look around the empty room with absolutely NO line and about 20 open tables. I felt like the decision was pretty obvious. As she comes back she said ""they will try to figure it out"". The manager then comes to our table and asked if we were dining in as if the first time I told them wasn't enough. She then seats us and asked if we wanted to keep our pizza in the to-go box or place it on a tray the way any other dine-in customer has it. We then said ""it doesn't matter, thank you"" so then one of the girls brought it out to our table in the to go box. We then stared blankly at each other wondering why an establishment this big had a problem with setting up our dish on a tray for paying customers as if it were out of their way to serve us. It's a PIZZA!! not that hard to put on a tray. Not only did they make us feel uncomfortable we were also ready to enjoy a few drinks from the bar and as I was trying to pull the pizza out of the box another server comes to help us and puts the pizza back in the box, accidentally, cause the manager/staff didn't inform him we were in fact going to dine in. Not only was he not informed but neither were the two serves after him. Don't get me wrong, they (men) did their job accordingly. But at this point we didn't know who our server even was. We didn't have a set server. As we're sitting there still thirsty, we never properly got served because we never had a set waiter to ask what exactly we wanted to drink. The manager instead brings us just waters but never once asked if we wanted anything else to drink. At this point we can see the girls (manager and hostess) discussing how annoying we were to them as if they couldn't have that conversation in the back without making it obvious. Already one slice in, one of the girls says we cannot pay in there, we need to go down stairs to pay for our meal. After everything we went through we just ok, that's fine thank you. Then we get ANOTHER server come tell us he would switch our ticket so we can pay up in the dining area instead of having to go down stairs but one of the girls proceeded to tell him we had to go down stairs. Our second slice in, one of the male servers was nice enough to refill our water and got us our bill for us instead of having us go down stairs. In my head I'm thinking 'how was this so hard for them to seat us, serve us, and bring our ticket'?! There must not be a hiring process to work here. We then have another server bring us our check in which this point we have no idea who we were to tip. We were honestly just ready to get out of that restaurant and as we walk toward the doors on our way out, both the female manager with the glasses and hostess give us an ugly look and continue their conversation as if we were a burden to that place. The male servers, however were great and tried to keep us happy. Pizza was delicious but dining here again isn't something that sounds too convincing. Now, not ONCE did we have an attitude or be rude with them what so ever and still kept a smile on our faces but if this was my establishment, I'd definitely look into the staff represents giordanos",YyjuCYqAd2_uWICVVGKGTw,0,0,2,m_fgVsZT-luNv9DB7Xyuug

If you're looking for a quick bite, this is NOT the place to go. We waited over an hour for one large pizza. Mind you, there were still empty tables in the restaurant. I can't imagine how long the wait is when it's dinner time or when it's fully packed. 

Our waitress knew it was taking a long time so she avoided our table for a very long time. Want a refill on water? Forget about it. Want your wing order to come out correctly? Forget about it.

The hour plus wait is definitely not worth it, the deep dish was ""ehh"". We should of walked out the moment the hostess took us to our booth that was still not cleaned with a broken plate underneath the table. 
For $12 you would expect a decent size cocktail, nope you're practically given a tea cup. 
Twice i had to get up from my seat to track someone down because we were not given napkins or forks once our food was brought to us. I mean we could have probably just got up and left and our server would have never noticed.
We can definitely agree and relate to most of negative reviews this place has.

3245984,2017-02-18,3,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"I have never had Chicago style pizza but my friends in Chicago highly recommended Giordano's to me when it opened. We went on a Saturday night in December and it wasn't that busy. We ate in the upstairs portion of the restaurant (there's a downstairs outdoor portion in the Ballys shopping area as well) and the decor was very industrial, the walls I think were garage doors which gave a nice ambiance.
Our server was fantastic, energetic, and very knowledgable. He even knew where their farms were that they sourced their dairy and tomatoes from. I ordered their sangria which was inexpensive and strong, I enjoyed it. I had a few because the pizzas take about 45 minutes to cook. We also enjoyed the bruschetta in the meantime.
I think I actually heard angels singing when they brought out our pizza and cut the first slice. The cheese oozed absolutely everywhere and I could not wait to take my first bite. For how insane this pizza looks, it's surprisingly light. The crust was almost like a cracker, I don't like pizza crust typically and I could not get enough of it. I'm glad we only a medium because with three people there were still leftovers.
Between the excellent service and otherworldly pizza, I'd recommend everyone and anyone get a pie here.",S5Eld1fZx6D8d9i5YbFOaA,6,2,5,dasF5bffXbkr9TpvqtMtug
3250865,2017-04-18,5,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"It was a glorious Easter Sunday. Jesus had resurrected from the dead, and heck, I was even willing to give Giordano's another shot despite the last subpar experience. That's right. Even after I said that I would rather have BJ's deep dish pizza than eat this again. 

My wife and I started off with a couple appetizers including the Caesar salad, Bruschetta, and Calamari. The Bruschetta was the steal of the night, quite possibly the best Bruschetta I've ever had! It was toasted flawlessly and topped off abundantly with mozzarella cheese and diced tomatoes drizzled with a balsamic reduction. The tomatoes were so robust and flavorful, and my mouth is watering as I'm writing this review. The Caesar salad was also a great starter, light and refreshing, and the ingredients were all very fresh. The calamari was battered to perfection, and the marinara sauce was rich and tasty. What puzzled me however was that there were fried green beans and lemon peels in the calamari dish as well. The lemon peel was very unique, unlike anything I've ever had; it tasted like a lemon chip with a zesty kick at the end! 

On to the pizza. For those of you who haven't had Chicago-style deep dish pizza, don't come to Giordano's expecting a traditional pizza where the dough is soft and fluffy. An accurate description of their deep dish pizza would be somethin more along the lines of a pie, a savory one that is. Last occasion, my wife and I tried ""The Special"" stuffed deep dish pizza, but this time, we decided to go with a classic deep dish pepperoni sprinkled with some garlic. And oh boy, the pizza was freakin delicious! The marinara sauce was so much more delectable this time, and the crust wasn't as hard nor fragile. The cheese was super cheesy and gooey, and the garlic also really enhanced the overall flavor of the pizza. 

Lastly, we concluded the night with an order of the cannoli, and to put it simply, it was interesting. The fried shell had the texture of an egg roll or fried wonton, and the cream inside the shell was like a whipped cheese. It's not sweet so they drizzle some dark chocolate syrup to give it some sweetness. I enjoyed it, but a great addition with the cannoli, in my opinion, would be a scoop of vanilla ice cream (even though it is not traditional in any sense lol). 

Giordano's, I just wanna take my hat off to you guys, because I was thoroughly impressed with the food this time! The service was also impeccable despite how busy the restaurant was. You guy have proved me wrong, and I can't wait for my next visit! (And for that Bruschetta)",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,14,7,5,UMXVGskGraze0dtS7HzlUA

The host & our server emphasized to us that a deep dish would take 30-45 minutes.  But our server, Carolina, would not give us a chance to look over the menu!  The restaurant was not busy, this was our first time dining with them, we did not know what we wanted, but I kid you not, she came by 4 times within 5 minutes asking if we were ready.

Potatoes fritters were also great. They were pretty much little deep fried mashed potato balls. The BEST part f the meal hands down was the pizza. I decided to opp out of the deep dish pizza because the wait is 45-60 minutes because baking one is essentially like baking a pie. The crust on the thin crust (what we got) was crispy and delicious.

3322368,2018-01-20,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"Giordanos's truly a Chicago favorite loved by pizza lovers nation wide. Chicago is known for its great pizza especially deep dish and Giordano's is a hallmark of that greatness. Giordano's is a special kind of pizza you can only find in the chi town right? I mean come on the last time I went there it was a gorgeous day on the strip with ma.......Wait a second......The Strip????? This cant be possible!!!! NO NO this place is not real OMG when I go back home to Illinois I am going to get beat up is the streets!!! Please if your reading this it is my final review!!!!!!

Though its not located in my favorite city in America Chicago this Giordano's is pretty amazing. The setting maybe different but it still had that bold and delicious Chicago flavor. The two apetizers I started off with were great and very satisfying. The first appetizer I had was the calamari and more $10.95 this dish had fried pieces of calamari such as the tentacles as well as fried green beans,lemon rings, shaved fennel, with a very fresh and tomatoy marinara sauce. Then I moved onto the most amazing tomato Bruscheta $9.25 This plate had fresh tomatos mozzarela ccheese basil,olive oil, balsamic glaze, all served on a crispy garlic toast. The tomatos were so fresh I almost asked if they were freshly picked. 

Then after a 45 minute wait(WHY YOU TORTURE ME WITH WAIT GIORDANOS!?!?!?!?!!?!?) a gift from god himself was delivered to my table. The deep dish chicken sasuage deluxe $28.25 for a medium which was tottaly worth the price. This pizza came packing with nicley portioned chicken sausage,spinach, and mushrooms all packed together for an amazing bite. The crust was cracker thin just like it should....AAAAAH it felt like I was on top of the Willis Tower at night with a cool breeze blowing.

Though the food was great the outlet itself could have been a bit better. The atmosphere was great with the whole restaurant being open and it had water spritzer just in case it got hot. The table were nice and the plates could have been a bit cleaner my had tons of battle scars it had seen a few forks in its time. The location was ok(not known for the most sober patrons) but I think Giordanos could thrive in someplace more upbeat and lively such as Dowtown Summerlin. Truly it could have had more of a Chicago deel with decorations and could have even played blues brothers music instead of 107.9. The service was great the waitress I had and the other staff had excellent customer service skills. 

Chicago it is truly a wonderful city and the home of the original Giordano's. Who would ever guess that I would find a nice tastey slice of home right here in Vegas.

I had a slice of the deep dish cheese, pepperoni, and spicy sausage. I did not care for the sausage. The pepperoni was fine, and there is CHEESE people! I felt like it was too much. That's just my preference. I only had the 1 slice and didn't finish it. It was just too thick for me. Smelled great tho. 

Bathrooms were nasty. Toilet paper and water all over the place; and it smelled to high heaven. It was horrible.

I ordered a virgin daiquiri because I have liver issues and can't drink...pretty sure my drink had alcohol in it. I didn't really taste alcohol, but I felt buzzed after I drank it. And since I don't drink, 1 drink would easily get me buzzed. That was a little disappointing.

To explain, my boyfriend has only had mail delivery Lou Malnati's as far as deep dish goes and he had a hankering for it in Vegas. With seemingly no other sit down pizza places within walking distance of our hotel on the Strip, I decided to stop being a snot who only eats deep dish in Chicago and went for Giordanos. To my delight, it tasted much like it does in Chicago. 

The restaurant itself was pretty cool. It was on this mini strip off the strip, with a bar area in a glass enclosure. We took a seat at the bar, ordered a cold local beer and waited the 45 minutes (it just takes that long to cook) for our deep dish pizza. For an appetizer we decided to get the fried calamari and peppers and it was salty, crispy, and very tasty. For our pizza we went for their version of meat lovers with of course, a side of Giardinera pickled vegetables, and ate until we couldn't eat anymore. 

Is anything more satisfying than being pizza drunk?

As if the night couldn't get any better, we were able to walk across the street right as the Fountains at the Bellagio were dancing with some sweet jams to complete our evening.

The pizza was very soft from the amount of cheese yet somehow they managed to keep the crust intact so it still had a good crisp crunch to it.  If you are a pizza connoisseur and have children that love pizza this is the place to come to.  I would also highly recommend the Fried Mozzarella Triangles.

I came here with a group of friends not too long after they first opened and we shared the Chicago Classic, Fresh Spinach Deep Dish and one of their thin crust pizzas along with the House Salad and everyone was pleased. Pleased enough that I have been back to eat by myself! Yep, I have had a cravings for this perfectly prepared deep dish pizza and came here all by my lonesome which meant I didn't have to share ha! Pizza is one of those things I personally feel that is best shared with family and friends, but Giordano's offers their famous deep dish pizzas in different sizes making it perfect for the times you want to make memories around a pie with people and perfect for the times you just want to have a pizza moment to yourself lol. Pizzas come in individual 6 inch, small, medium and large sizes. Staff is really nice and checked on the table often. 

Harvest Greens Salad ($5.95 for small size) - Spring greens, candied walnuts, dried fruit and blue cheese. This salad comes with balsamic vinaigrette, but you can choose a different dressing like it did by asking for ranch and I did ask for tomatoes to be added which was no problem and they didn't even charge me extra which is nice since a lot of places do. The salad tasted great and was a nice portion for the price. Totally worth it. 

Individual 6 Inch Deep Dish Pizza ($10.45) - Each additional topping is $0.95 cents per topping and proteins are $1.45 per topping. I had mine with pepperoni and it was sooooo good! The deep dish pizzas take a little longer to cook, 30-45 minutes depending on size. The bottom crust has the perfect crispness which is necessary to hold all of that glorious cheese the deep dish pizzas here offer. They certainly don't skimp on cheese and the sauce tastes great. Definitely a worthy deep dish pizza. 

Besides deep dish, they also have hand-stretched thin crust and crispy extra thin crust pizzas and they have the option for a gluten free thin crust. You can place an order for pick-up on their website or phone it in.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,71,69,5,Vq7i067byKG7StdySoIQrA

To me, it was full of tomato sauce and not a lot of toppings. It was an over kill of sauce. The crust was okay. It was more of a cookie crust, so that also made it filling too. Sadly, I don't think I'll be back and if I do, I'll just get it to-go and eat it at the Tiki Bar. I'll also order 1 small to share for a party of 4. But, honestly I don't think I'll be back.

""I finally took your pictures off the wall. It didn't even help at all. You're simply too beautiful. Got you frozen in a frame inside my mind."" - NKOTB (Miss You More)

THIS IS MY SONG!! IT DESCRIBES LOU MALNATI'S PIZZA FOR ME!!

Giordano's in Vegas is a decent pie. Don't get me wrong. But it leaves me wanting more! (For reference I would rate Pizza Hut, Domino's, Little Caesars, and Papa John's - 0 stars, meaning I won't eat it!!)...

Giordano's is located right in front of Bally's Hotel & Casino on the Vegas Strip. They have a take out window and a dining area that is covered and away from the elements. (I didn't know that when the BF and I dined here on a COLD WINTER DAY). We ended up eating in the area outside with the pouring rain and the wind blowing!!

Let me be blunt, Giordano's claims to have a cheesy pizza which allows the patron to enjoy the ""cheese pull"" before one devours this pie! I saw a good video at this location on Yelp and had a mini foodgasm!! That cheese pull made me have dreams about having my own cheese pull experience!! They even have a sign that says people should post their best cheese pull videos  (the amount of cheese that goes into the pizza to make the cheese ""stretch for miles"")!!

SADLY, MY CHEESE PULL SUCKED!!

One of the best things I love about Lou Malnati's is that they deliver their pie in their signature steel pan! Their crust is cooked through and NOT reminiscent of CARDBOARD!

The BF kept telling our waiter the food was ""awesome"". I said it was decent. Yes, I am such a fan of Chicago Deep Dish (CDD) Pizza that I will not eat any other type of pizza! Of course, since we live in America, the BF is entitled to state his opinion, but I didn't have that same love. LOL.

We ordered the following:

-Chicago Classic Pie
-Calamari
-Minestrone (complimentary)

Chicago Classic Pie - Medium Pie (8 slices) - $30.25. (3.5 stars).

The toppings on the Chicago Classic were classic. No doubt. (Cheese, Pepperoni, Green Bell Peppers, Onions, and Mushrooms). Honestly, I hate green  peppers (I picked them out - they are too bitter for my liking) and raw or undercooked onions. YUCK.

That crust though... really ruined my experience. After chiseling through the crust for what seemed like hours, I was able to take a forkful to my drooling mouth... Ingredients were tasty, but again, the crust (sans the pan), was disappointing.

Yes, my expectations are high. Many Yelpers have said that. But I know what I love and I also know what I won't accept. Next time I'll order the CDD but just scoop the toppings out! ;)

Calamari - $11.95. (4 stars).

Soft and moist, fried and tasty. Fried up nicely! This appetizer was surprisingly very tasty!! Just a little seasoned salt and fresh squeeze lemon and I was good to go. It comes with a marinara dipping sauce but I prefer my calamari au natural. The rings and legs were tender and the batter was light and refreshing! I would definitely order this again!! The part that threw me off is that there are also fried banana peppers, green beans, and lemon wedges. I tried each one but only enjoyed the calamari itself.

Minestrone - FREE FOR KITCHEN OVERSIGHT. (4 stars).

Such a nice hearty soup which went well on a cold winter's day! Very heart warming! I would order this again!

I normally don't comment about service but our waiter Josh was exceptional and the manager gave the BF and I a complimentary bowl of Minestrone soup, since the BF's cup came out with coffee stains (he ordered TEA), which was warming and perfect for the cold weather!

---

All in all, Giordano's is right across the street from the Bellagio... if I really have a hankering for CDD pie I will still come here since I find myself in Vegas much more than Chi-town. (But I will make my trek back to Lou Malnati's one day to have my all time favorite!)

Giordano's does have a take out window, but for those who aren't familiar with CDD pies, they take a LONG WHILE TO MAKE!! Average wait times are about 45-55 minutes.

The cheese wasn't even melted all the way through. It is as if they put blocks of cheese all over and it mostly melted.

3852630,2016-12-17,12,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"So to preface this experience, I have to say that this is my first time trying real Chicago deep dish pizza. Giordano's is the newest addition to the Grand Bazaar Shops that are located in front of Bally's. 

They opened very recently 12/13 apparently but when I stopped by everything was in full swing and boy was it packed. You have the option of the indoor section of the restaurant on the second floor or their open bar area downstairs. We opted for the second floor because the weather was a little brisk in December to be sitting outside. 

For our food we opted for the appetizer sampler and sharing two deep dish pizzas. The appetizer sampler includes their cheesy bread, mozzarella triangles, chicken wings, and potato fritters. The cheesy bread was quite delicious and I would order it standalone next time!

For our pizzas, we opted for the Chicago Classic (pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms and onions) and the Meat and More Meat (pepperoni, sausage, salami and bacon). Our waitress warned us that the pizzas can take up 45 minutes to prep and bake. I'm glad that they warned us ahead of time instead of us just waiting around wondering if they were forgotten. 

The pizzas were.. interesting. I'm still not convinced about Chicago deep dish pizzas but this was my first time trying this style. The pizza was pretty tasty but very very saucy and cheesy, something I'm not entirely used to. But you be the judge!

You can park in the lot shared by Bally's and Paris (hopefully they don't start charging for it anytime soon) and just walk out towards the strip from Bally's. The entrance is on the second floor.",90ZtCUwxXjUBvrdBgyWYyg,23,27,4,L6WTd_f2EdE6vWeDHHTXnA

My group was one of the last in the restaurant and my server was friendly and polite nonetheless. The pizza was phenomenal. I am an avid pizza eater and Giordanos is one of the best.

When it comes to the pizza, I was extremely disappointed. The crust was dry and crispy but not in a good way. It's reminiscent of the crackly dry crust you get off frozen pizza. Toppings are extremely thin and lacking. Prepare to go mining through the mozzarella to assure yourself toppings were added. 
Service wise, the server was attentive and went through the motions. We had better experience from the host and the busser. The bussers did an amazing job and provided a more memorable experience.
Would I ever come here again or recommend it to someone else? No; no I wouldn't. This place is a pass. Find something else if you want a good meal.",f0gCTu1wT5ACCXinrUH9lQ,2,0,2,QPu7TnrJElX-i7kvqbQnGw

Chicago style is my favorite and in NYC I get very very little of it,  so I jumped at the chance to try these guys out while in Vegas for a trade show.  I thought I was hungry enough to finish a small by myself,  but my server accurately predicted that I'd need a box in the end.   Sure enough, after 3 of the 6 slices of my deep dish classic Chicago pie I was done.  It was,  I believe, the best pizza I've ever had, and that's saying a lot.  I took the rest in a box to my hotel room with fantasies about my next days lunch.  But the next day,  I realized I had no way to heat it up!  I just couldn't stomach having the best pizza I'd ever had cold, so I called the restaurant and asked if they wouldn't mind heating it up for me.  Well,  Erica told me that it would be a health code violation for them to serve me something that had been left out all night and day, but she related my tale to her manager and they offered to bake me a new pie for lunch if I brought in my receipt from the night before. What??  I got a little teary eyed as I blubbered and thanked her - I was totally overwhelmed!  They made me feel at home as I had my lunch at the bar (with another glass of that amazing Goose Island Greenline!) this time I could only put down 2 slices,  but I left with a heart a full as my stomach, more leftovers, and for the first time a desire to live in Chicago.

We came around 4pm after our pool party and just keep in mind the pizza does take about 30 to 40 minutes to cook. I ordered an appetizer because I was so famished. 
I was so hungry I kept asking our waiter Daniel what the ETA of my pizza was. He was patient enough to check an exact time for me multiple times. 

When it finally came I dug into my Chicago Classic and downed about 3 slices. I remember when I ate it in Chicago I only had space for one slice. Maybe it was because I was inebriated or I was just really hungry. 

The warm cheesy goodness, pepperoni and veggies plus that buttery crust melted in my mouth. I wanted the flavors to never end, but as i split the small with a friend my half was over before I knew it. 

Thank you Daniel for keeping me posted !

After the nightclub that evening I wished for more and wish I had leftovers. 
So the next morning I tried to call in an order but sadly they weren't open at 10am and I guess it doesn't make sense to as they don't really do breakfast. I didn't have enough time before my bus back to LA to pick up another one sadly. But I shall return ! And it looks like they deliver nation wide !

3997264,2017-04-13,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"Pretty awful experience to say the least. It was one issue after another. I first put my name down for our group of 5 and was told 10 minutes. The girl didn't mention that it was a completely separate reservation for upstairs than the outside seating, and apparently this was for outside seating. She takes us to 2 separate tables of 4 ? Uhm, usually people like to sit together which is why I said 5 ! So she moves us (attitude of course) and we didn't get our waiter to get our drink order for at least 15 minutes. By this time it is 9pm, starving. We are ready to order and start with the chicken parm and a deep dish pizza which we were told they were at a 45 minute wait. Ok we can start on the chicken parm, no big deal. About 20 minutes later, he comes back and says oh we are sold out of the chicken parm ! WhAT ?! Ugh reluctantly we replaced it with spaghetti and meatballs and specified we wanted it BEFORE the pizza came out. Again no rush, it took 40 minutes to get the spaghetti and meatballs - which were cold ! I guess they cook it upstairs and bring it down ? It was super windy and cold so I'm sure that is why everything was cold. Finally the pizza comes down and also a bit cold, nothing special. The crust reminds me of a cracker or a tart crust, the sauce is flavorless and the cheese wasn't as gooey as I prefer. Basic plain and nothing to wait 45 minutes for. The waiter never came back after our pizza, we never got refills - nothing. The couple next to us was livid over the lack of service that they left. Finally the bill comes and he says oh I'm sorry we are only taking cash bc the machines are down. Uhhh... what? This day in age NO one carries cash, granted this is Vegas I would carry it if I was going gambling but that wasn't my plan tonight. So I said sorry I only have a card, so he used the old school machine to take an image of the card. Dinner started at 8pm and ended at 10:30pm !!

So we sit at the bar and start a convo with the bartender from Colorado?.. who was super nice. The manager comes out and strikes up a convo about their bruschetta over the cheese bread so we put in our order..(he's as gracious as can be) I mean I can't tell you enough how nice this guy is.. he was very informative about his menu and explained all about the process of making their dough similar to Chicago's because in Chicago they use Michigan water.. their dough making process alone shows how far they are willing to go to make sure you are getting the real Giordanos! He gave us both a very good vibe..the place was very clean, they played GREAT old school music..we didn't want to get up!

The one thing about Giordanos is their sauce for me and the sauce was the exact same as Chicago! The dough was close but I'm telling you, it's still the best pizza I've ever had and I'm so excited that they are only a few hours away which is doable for me because yes, I would drive here for their nice cheesy and rich, saucy, piping fresh hot deep dish pizza! The bruschetta was good but needed more basil and garlic in the tomatoes and not just on the crispy bread so I wouldn't order that again, the customer service knocks it out of the ballpark!

If you haven't been, 
it's a fail, it's a pity.

But now we have one,
right off the strip.
Takes 45 to cook,
Be patient, don't trip.

The view is excellent,
Yeah, pretty cool.
What's even more impressive,
the famous cheese pull.  

Phone eats first,
yeah, even at this joint
Let me get to the details,
I'll get to the point.

The pizza is cheesy,
it's not a bust,
The sauce is good,
And WOW!  That crust!

The crust is flaky, 
it's baked not fried.
It's even good cold.
I know, I tried. 

I had three slices, 
could eat eleven.
I think I just died, 
and went to pizza heaven. 

So there you have it, 
another rhyme.

1:06 PM - My 6' Famous Stuffed Deep Dish Pizza topped and stuffed with pepperoni, jalapenos and mushrooms is is in my belly.

The personal sized 6' Famous Stuffed Deep Dish Pizza is very filling considering it's size and is just over 1,200 calories. (per their website)  There's only 4 thick slices, and it's very cheesey af (like me) and extremely tasty.  The ingredients are high quality and the preparation is on point.  

We had a very good pick up experience. The location isn't the easiest to get to but my next visit will be a dine in option so I can tear into that pizza right out of the oven.  That's another Yelp tale, enjoy!",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,5,4,4,Aq8BeM_u73DOJMZxqArl9A

We ordered, and it was a 45 minute wait for the deep dish (SO worth it!)...During that time, your entertained by the many televisions broadcasting sports...or for me, my cell phone.  
I love the tanginess of the marinara that tops off the pizza.  I can only eat a slice.  My big guy can eat 2-3 slices.  There are always leftovers for our next day perfect breakfast experience..

I went with a group, we were seated quickly. The server was a little slow to take out drink order. While she was taking it, we told her we were ready to make our food order. She blew us off with a ""no, not yet"" and went to service another table.

After we got our food order in it took a while to get food. We did get our drinks refilled in a timely manner.

We had appetizers first. The calamari was good, but nothing amazing. The Buffalo Wings had a good flavor, and they weren't too hot. A great balance.

The pizzas were dynamic (Note: I'm normally a thin crust fan). The deep dish pizzas were delicious. The cheese blend was right on. The sauce was fresh tasting, but not overpowering. The crust was good, but that is very subjective. I like mine a little doughier than Giordano's. A couple slices and you will be filled. Even our most aggressive eaters only got down four slices off a medium pizza.

The PIZZA is amazing.

I've had this placed bookmarked for the longest but never wanted to fight the traffic of downtown. Until one wonderful Thursday night. 

There are two ways to get to this location. One by walking through Bally's from the Paris ( which isn't long), or by walking up the steps from the street entrance.

Directly across from this eatery is another popular food place that I can't think of the name of. There were two nice and friendly hostess that informed us that there was roughly a 10 - 15 minute wait. Our wait time was shorter than that (5 minutes) , and we were seated at a nice window seat with the view of the Bellagio fountains.

I waiter came and he was nice and friendly. They recommend that If you are getting their famous deep-dish-pizza, that you put that in first since it takes about 45minutes for it to cook. We decided on a deep dish pizza have specials and half meat loves. This was my first Chicago style deep dish pizza and it did not disappoint. I had to use a knife and fork to cut eat my pizza because the slices are HUGE.

My only problem was that I had sauce all over my shirt because I kept forgetting that the sauce is on top (so it keep sliding off and hitting my place).

I love this place and will defiantly be returning soon for some more yummy goodness.",dIHHaoF-yyIvBFEOyEQ8Pw,2,1,5,GB0bL1rcewH_6Ng0sS9kKQ
4231458,2017-03-09,3,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"It was a huge disappointment for the overall experience. We came to Giordano's expecting real Chicago pizza, however, overall experience made me think that they had too much staff on the floor but there was barely no service offered.

We expected a long wait, but it was just a brief 15 minute wait. I definitely thought they were going to take our order ahead of time to be able to start working on the pizza instead of having us wait another 30 mins for the food at the table. We were not in a rush, but 30 minutes is enough time for someone to lose their appetite. Considering that the style of pizza they serve takes a long time, they should take the Chicago order style into consideration as well.

As we were sat at the table, our server was just too much. He just stared at us instead of greeting us or anything. He never introduced himself, but he did asked if we wanted to order, we asked for water and we ordered our food as well. We never got our water until our salad came out, and asked for them again. 

The salad came out roughly in about 10 mins after we ordered, and it actually tasted pretty good. We got their house salad, yet I wish they offered a choice of more cheese or not, but it did not matter that much. Then, our pizza came out. We got the giordano classic for 2-3 people. I would say it is enough food for even 4 small girls to share, but that's just me. The server offered us to serve the first slice for us, which is the reason I am giving 1 extra star. Then we were on our own. The pizza was just bad. It seemed like they put the amount of marinara that should go in a thin crust. It was like they forgot to put the other scoop of sauce. That was how bland the taste was. It was like eating an onion pizza with so much cheese that had no taste to it. We basically only had one slice each, and left the whole thing behind us.

Will we come back? NO. I already even told my friends to go to local deep dish pizza places instead of coming out and waiting for a table, bad food and bad service. It was a combination of bad bad bad all the way.",s01liMq8lG4G3f3AvJMi5w,2,3,2,zdRRMGhH4Q5zh96pjqmM1w

We got there about 4pm on a Monday night and the restaurant was not crowded. They only have a few booths for large parties, so we sat by the windows overlooking the shops at Bally's. We both had eaten at Giordano's in Chicago before so we knew exactly what we wanted and order our  Medium Sausage/Mushroom Deep dish pizza right away. The pizza took 1 hour to make it to our table, so plan accordingly if you are in a hurry. The pizza was good but had hardly any sausage or mushrooms. For $27.00 you would expect this pizza to have more meat on it. The crust was as good as we remember. But I must also comment on the cheese, which oozes all over the place once the pizza is cut (not crazy about that). Giordano's is not the best pizza place in Chicago, but it is the best Chicago deep dish pizza in Las Vegas. We will definitely be back to try the extra thin pizza, and hope if will be our new thin crust pizzeria in Las Vegas.",535H0AVY41CWfHGjYhEoKQ,1,0,3,GC9qbghJh2CHJm0LM5Cv9Q

4255335,2018-06-28,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"This pizza is everything. If i could marry it, i probably would. I would give Giordano 5 stars but i have to knock one star down because of the drinks. We ordered a Bellini. It tasted great! But the price was pretty outrageous for the size. The bellini was served in a smaller sized wine glass and the price was $12. Just not worth it. Maybe if we weren't in Vegas, the land of cheap alcohol, it would be worth it. I'm also comparing the value to other restaurants that we ate at while in Vegas. This one just seemed overpriced for the size. For example we ate at a fancy steakhouse later that night and the price was $12 for a cocktail. It was 3 times the size! And this was at a place where the entrees START at $60 a plate. 

The pizza though! OMG. I've eaten at Giordanos in Chicago before. It is by far my favorite pizza. I was very excited to see they have a location in Vegas now. We live on the west coast and it's not easy getting to chicago for true deep dish. The cheese, the crust ( i don't know how they get that crunchy bottom with so many fillings and the sauce). Be prepared to wait 45 mins for your pizza. This stuff is made to order. The pizzas are very filling. The small filled both of us plus we took 2 pieces to the hotel. My husband has a rather large appetite, but even he couldn't tackle this one till the end.

The last two times i ordered ahead of time and STILL had to wait an additional 30-40 min once i arrived AT THE TIME IT SAID TO PICKUP .  Then to get the pizza it wasn't as i ordered it and was a little over cooked. The pizza crust was like cardboard.  Spending $22 on a small pizza and for it to be mediocre is never a good thing.  The manager came over to ""fix"" the situation but his solution was to make me wait another long wait time for a pizza. Not a good solution for an already starving family. I ended up keeping it due to the hunger we already were experiencing but i did not fill it was handled properly. He then begrudgingly offers 20% off for THIER mistake which i felt should have been 50% due to the extra long wait and inconvenience of eating a pizza that was not the way i ordered it AHEAD IF TIME.

We arrived during lunch hour, there were six of us. Sadly the AC wasn't working, the hostess asked if we preferred to dine downstairs where it was cooler. Everyone declined due to the 30min wait time. So we stayed upstairs, My husband and I didn't mind the warmer temperature...side note! My apologies to the staff! Two of our cousins made rude comments about the AC....These southern idiots could've went downstairs, but decided to complain. Classic ignorance...

Food: 
Everyone knows a Chicago deep dish takes 30-40mins to order. We selected two Large deep dish pizzas the ""Meat & More Meat"" and the ""Classic Chicago"". Talk about perfection!!!

Our server even brought us pizzas we hadn't ordered to hold us over as we waited. The setting and ambiance here was amazing and the service was seriously the best I have ever experienced.

We love to share a small, meat-filled deep-dish Pizza and eat the whole thing by ourselves. I think the dough is perfect - very buttery and almost flaky, never burnt or crispy. It's absolutely FILLED with sauce, toppings and, most importantly, CHEESE. 

The only downside to deep dish? A very long wait. You might wait for a table if it's busy. Then wait to order because people can't decide what to order. Then you wait about thirty minutes for your pizza to cook. So imagine my husband's happiness when I informed him that this location has person size deep-dish Pizza to-go. No waiting. They ready before you even place your order. Perfect. 

Personally, I really prefer the full Size pizzas because I feel they have a better relation of dough to fillings. But it's nice that this location can get be you either depending on what you want. 

I've also tried a couple thin crust pizzas. The BBQ Chicken definitely stood out and I would absolutely order it again!

4584915,2017-04-27,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"I had two encounters with Giordano's on Easter weekend, one not so pleasant and the second absolutely incredible.

1st Attempt:

I searched online and the website said that the restaurant was open till 2am so I thought, ""Perfect late night snack!"" As we walk straight into the upstairs restaurant at the Bally's, we noticed no one would seat us. We basically stood around looking to see if anyone would seat us or if we were going to seat ourselves. Finally, after looking awfully dumb in the middle of the room, a waiter came up to us and told us the indoor seating was closed at 12am (mind you it was 12:05am and they did not close the doors). He explained to us that we were able to eat in their outdoor area downstairs (he did not mention any exceptions to the menu at this point). I was dying to try their pizza so of course I wanted downstairs to their outside location.

We checked in at the front podium where we were quickly seated and a waiter came over to take our order. Upon reading the menu, it read individual deep dish options and it gave a brief listing of them. I was a little concerned but I thought the waiter would definitely ease my worries with a simple explanation of the incomplete menu that was handed to me.

We raised our concerns with the waiter and he explained that at 12am they stop making their deep dish pizzas and only offer the individual size options because it takes much less time to cook. The regular deep dish pizzas take a minimum of 45 minutes to cook. I was highly disappointed that the waiter couldn't make an exception to make the deep dish seeing as it was early enough in the night to do so. Sadly, I left disappointed with my craving unsatisfied. 

2nd Attempt:

I couldn't leave Vegas without trying Giordano's, even if the first time was a complete and utter disappointment. During the day, the staff are incredibly nice and they help you deciding what to eat and even what deep dish size is recommended for your party size. We went with the Meat & More Meat in a small and trust me when I say, this will be a lot. Honestly, this is enough for 4 people to eat comfortably with appetizers included. We tried the Crispy Chicken Tenders and the chopped salad which are both very delicious.

The anticipation of the deep dish's arrival is insane because you're building up this crazy appetite but as it's placed down in front of you, it's a spectacle to see! The waiters help serve you but I think it's so much more fun to cut into that pie yourself. The cheese is so stringy and if you're not careful it gets everywhere but I feel that's where the fun lies. The meats are perfectly cooked (I did not get a undercooked bite and I hear that's always an issue with deep dishes). Ohhhhh and the crust is absolutely DELICIOUS!!! It's thin but crispy and just everything you hope for in every bite accompanying the melted cheese and delicious meat filled pie. 

Staff was attentive, the deep dish pizza and crust were amazing, and lastly the restaurant location is perfect if you're a people watcher :)",Fxzv4iufRNIyPVO0XvKmWQ,0,0,4,Y7ZqkpRrkYmc_MCvOqnxBQ

For instance, letting us know that an order of deep-dish would take just under hour to prepare.

We went ahead and ordered the Chicago deep-dish pizza. The wait was definitely worth it. Pulling the first slice off the pan, you can tell the cheese is not some generic sprinkle of mozzarella right before it hits the oven. The cheese has a nice bite and pull to it and full of flavor.

This level is extremely noisy with ""garage door"" windows open to the noise of traffic along Flamingo Rd. Children in the contiguous booth kept kicking my seat back. The waiter, who was attentive throughout, said there would be a 45 minute wait for the thick crust and a 40 minute wait for the thin crust. We went for the latter because of time. When I asked to add garlic to the veggie pizza, he said he would have to then price the pizza as a ""build your own,"" so we declined. At any rate, we filled the long wait with some garlic parmesan fries that were very tasty.  The thin crust pizza is more like cracker crust, not chewy pizza dough, so I didn't care for it. The toppings were okay but bland (missed the garlic). Lots of free ice tea refills. When I tried to pay, the waiter returned saying my credit card had been ""declined,"" so I gave him a different one. Called the credit card company, which said there was no record of any attempt at payment. It said the restaurant had a faulty credit card reader; very annoying and upsetting.

Both were above average, quality was up to expectations. The server did warn us it might take up to an hour for the pizza, being determined to try the deep dish pizza said that's fine. Due to some error in the kitchen our order didn't go through and we found out 2 hours later after we asked why our order didn't come yet, otherwise I'm guessing it would've taken longer. In the end it was just a bad mistake, they did compensate by making our dinner free but still 2 hours sitting outside waiting for food is never fun.

Our server, Ken, was so helpful and knowledgeable, he made it an even better experience! We got the stuff crust, medium for $25 (more than enough for 2 people) we ended up taking most of it home. Of course, the cheese pull pictures are my MOST favorite, I also loved the pastry crust. It's flaky and soft and crunchy- all at the same time.

4721017,2017-09-04,1,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"I love Chicago style deep dish and have been wanting to come here since they opened. Las Vegas, for all the Illinois transplant's, doesn't really have great Chicago style Pizza. I finally made a trip to Bally's just to eat here.

First off all, this place gets packed. I went on a weekday and was lucky to wait only about 15 minutes to be seated for a party of two. By the time we left the waits were up to an hour or longer. Also, if you want to order a deep dish pizza it does take a while to bake (about 30 minutes, and they are good about warning you about it), so this isn't a place to go to if you are pressed for time.

The Pizza was overpriced, even considering the strip location. Our large pizza was over $30, which isn't worth it even considering how big the pizza is. When the Pizza showed up, they tried to stretch the cheese like you see in the pictures on Yelp, but it snapped immediately so no presentation points here. The server even kind of apologized and said it doesn't always stretch that way every time. Not that something like that matters to me, I only bring it up because I think we got shorted on toppings compared to the average pizza here. After we were done dining and left, I looked at a lot of the other pictures I saw on Yelp and I just think our's wasn't loaded up with cheese like they usually do.

The crust has a buttery taste, but it's very soft which I don't really like. Heck, I thought it might be slightly undercooked but when I reheated some leftover slices in the oven the next day they didn't taste any crispier, so I guess that's just how it's supposed to be. All in all, the Pizza was just OK, not bad, but nothing that would blow you away. And considering this Pizza cost over $30, my wife and I were both very disappointed.

The only thing we did like was the Italian beef sandwich. We ordered it to split as an appetizer since they Pizza was going to take so long to bake and it was delicious. If I ever came back here, which I doubt, I would get this over the Pizza. The meat was juicy and the peppers went perfectly with it.

With all the good reviews for the Pizza here, and I can only think that Giordano's either screwed up our pizza or the reviewer's haven't had good Chicago Pizza before, but I lean towards the former. There is no way the Giordano's in Illinois serves pizza of the quality we were given and got so successful. This isn't a place I would ever return to again based on this experience.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,4,2,3,uym2SsCjWsV4ophrkgWQ2Q

My family and I having already experienced real Chicago Deep Dish Pizza at another restaurant in town, wanted to try it where it's talked about all around the world. The restaurant is located in the Bally's Casino area where parking is very limited (try behind the restaurant). So here we went mid July in a 110 degree afternoon. I don't do hot very well but it wasn't too bad until we got to the restaurant. The place was hotter inside than it was outside. Come to find out, on our way out that the AC was out. So as we're walking out, workers could be seen hauling big fans inside. 

The hosts were kind and pleasant, seating us fairly quickly. Our waiter was trying to do too much that he couldn't properly serve his tables. We had to ask bus boys for refills and extra napkins constantly. The food was good and worth the wait (the deep dish pizza takes 45-55 minutes to make). Order an appetizer while you wait. I recommend the sampler. Now having said all this, I left there a little disappointed. Being a huge pizza fanatic and connoisseur, I was expecting more from the big name of Giordano's. I was hoping to be knocked off my feet with plenteous flavors but I wasn't. I'm not saying it wasn't good cause it was but I just left wanting more. We'll return on our next visit to Vegas and hope to have a better report. Still love you Giordano's! Check out my pictures.",rq3YoQLeHnCiVAadnKp0ew,0,0,4,7gr6oOF5yakzeXEu85FSog

There was a very thin bottom crust and a very thin layer of pepperoni (the pepperoni was sliced paper thin). There was a huge mound of cheese and a drizzle of sauce. The cheese pull was cool to see but the overall taste in the pizza was lacking. Because the layer of meat and sauce was so thin, all you tasted was cheese! Now let's talk about that-  the cheese cooled very quickly so half way through, you end up with something that tasted more like one of those kiddie cheese sticks. All in all, I probably wouldn't recommend dining on a Chicago pizza here. The taste, the price (23 and some change for a small) and the excruciatingly hour long wait just isn't worth it.",Cwhly6PJGXu_5mvwVxzWkg,21,15,2,AOJJLSmvYj-or4a6EWfhoA

This is a place that you visit with a group of friends where you can all throw $10 to one of their larger options and be engrossed in the entire experience.

This place is located in the shopping mall right in front of bally's, which was not a far walk since we were staying at the Paris hotel.

We decided to sit at the table in which we asked for a chicago pizza and also requested to have happy hour as well. The server told us that we would need to sit at the bar in order to get the happy hour deals (50% off on draft pints, which is around 2.50 depending on the beer.

We decided to change seats and understood that we had to wait for the pizza (about 45 mins). I decided to ask the server again if they had placed the order in after 30 just because I felt something off. The server said he did not because we changes from a table seating to the bar, but after a bit, the server let the bartender know that to put in or order and speed up it because the order wasn't placed in. Since we didn't have any time constraints, my friend and I were cool with waiting (since we did not have any time constraints for that day) and just ordered more beer due to the happy hour prices. The bartender came by after a bit and said that due to the mixup, they offered to waive our whole pizza as long as we paid for the beer. We still offered to pay for the pizza and beer since this was a communication mixup on both parties.

We were able to get our Pizza, which was a small chicago style - meat and more meat pizza. The crust was really nice and flaky, almost like a pastry crust and the amount of cheese and toppings in each slice lets you know that this pizza will fill you up. The amount of cheese and toppings makes it feel like a different experience than your normal pizza. The ingredients themselves were tasty and were nicely cooked. My friend and I were able to finish the whole pizza and were stuffed by the end. 

Even though they waived the pizza, we still left a tip just because they were willing to fix something that wasn't exactly their fault. We did have to stay for more than two hours, but nevertheless the beer was good.

All in all I would come back to this place for the happy hour deals and just to share a slice or two of Chicago style pizza with some friends.",RlqVcqbYNyPRbbnMuW2_Qw,0,0,5,3oIHtvV8rU02oZA8CfmaGw

We complained to management and to my shock, manager threw his entire kitchen staff under the bus and blamed them for the missing thin crust pizza. He even offered to allow us to enter the kitchen to yell at the staff ourselves since he said yelling at them himself has not been effective.  Wtf? Who does that? A place is only as good as their leader and clearly this place was despicable. I felt bad for the waitstaff who had to work with them. The manager not once offered to comp the meal despite part of our group never getting food and having nothing to eat. We mentioned we didn't feel like it is fair that we have to tip since part of us was never served and that manager should cover our tip towards the waitstaff but he did nothing.

However, I have lived in Chicago and had the real deal multiple times so I know this is an aberration and abomination.

We had a larger group and were seated at a bar table with the bartender as our server who got our drinks and took our orders right away, but after forty-five minutes when our appetizers hadn't come out he didn't seem to notice until another fifteen minutes had gone by after that.

It wasn't until we'd been sitting there an hour and a half when he came back and noticed none of us had gotten our food. He seemed like he was busy at the bar, so we didn't blame him, but it wasn't until this point that he warned us about the pizzas taking a while and admitted that it looked like the kitchen lost the ticket.

After an hour and forty five minutes, we finally got a visit from the manager who seemed totally unphased. She barely apologized and reminded us that the pizzas take 45-60 minutes each but didn't seem to care when we said it had actually been an hour and forty-five minutes. She then went and sat down at a table and chit-chatted with another employee rather than go run the restaurant. Another half hour after that, we finally got our food. When she brought our checks, she comped the meals for those of us that ordered entrees but still insisted that it was normal for the pizzas to take an hour even after we explained it had taken two. Eventually she  took the pizzas off the check but still made us pay for our drinks. 

So, all in all, it took two hours to get our food (which was actually good) and the manager didn't seem to care enough to even follow through with the kitchen, let alone stand up and go do her job rather than hang out with another employee right in front of us as we all sat there waiting for our food.

It was 110 degrees most days & I was concerned about sitting there sweating for the next hour, especially when their average wait time for a Chicago deep dish is 45 minutes. I quickly realized that this Giordano's outside area isn't the only option. I walked past this area to the back & went up the escalator towards Bally's. At the top of the escalator is the entrance into a very nice indoor Giordano's seating area that overlooks the strip. When I approached the hostess, she informed me of the time it takes to make a Chicago deep dish & gave me the option of pre-ordering it. I pre-ordered a medium pizza & she placed me on the list & told me I'd receive a text message when my table was ready. I went back down the escalator into the Grand Bazaar Shops & sat at the Sin City Brewing Company's bar to try a few pints, while my wife and daughter explored the various shops.  After about 40 minutes, I received a text to head back up. We were promptly seated, ordered & received our drinks, & then our pizza arrived 5 minutes later. I was very impressed with their system & found it REALLY convenient. I can't wait to go back!",lFXj_qDrWsbBftMzSCr4gg,1,0,5,81ZwqT01Z_jXkNHvP5Lx3Q

The reviews basically warned me about the long wait, so we were prepared for that and ordered a couple of beers and appetizers while we waited for the pizza. The cheesy bread and wings were delicious. The cheesy bread was free since I signed up for their emails. Totally recommend doing that. We ordered the Chicago classic, and it wasn't as cheesy as I expected. I wanted the crazy cheese pull and I didn't get it. That was a bit disappointing. It was one of the main reasons we wanted to try it, we're cheese fanatics. The pizza itself was good though. It had great flavor and was very filling. Our eyes were definitely hungrier than our stomachs though because we ordered a large for 2 of us, even though our nice waiter told us a medium would be enough. Haha, we should've listened. That large pizza lasted for 3 meals, lol. It was a lot. We may go back when we visit Vegas again, and hopefully I'll get my cheese pull.",tTBs7mpZi7cYj5WDCH6Y9A,0,0,4,piwBaWcrPhdUwEEQf1hZzg

The wait was about 40mins for a deep dish pizza but I didnt mind. They also have a to-go window with pizzas already made and hot waiting but I wanted the real deal fresh off the oven version so I waited.The service was great and employees very nice. The upstairs restaurant was cool too with nice decor.The missing star of the show was the pizza. The ingridients did not taste fresh. The sauce was just ""ok"" but I remembered it being so much better than it was. The itakian sausage was actually not very tasty or good. The sausage just didnt taste that great and I was surprised. The pepperoni tasted like hornel brand and not very good quality. I dont know. Maybe my tastebuds overhyped the pizza as a kid but its just not that great anymore. Its good pizza but not great and I actually will likely throw away the leftovers. Maybe it taste better a day later. The cheese did taste good and fresh. Given all the calories and the wait, I would not come back for ""ok"" pizza. They do have regular crust pizza which takes less time and looked great. The presentation of the deep dish pizza was great just the taste was mediocre. I tried it a few years back again in Chicago and alao felt the exact same way. Something is off with the taste and I cant put my finger on it. Sadly I would not go back to any of the restaurants anymore. I guess you can never go home again :(

I also found the pizza to be salty (likely due to the pepperoni and sausage). but I also feel they skimped on the sauce. you had all this cheese and meat and barely a covering of sauce. I dont know I really was a bit disappointed and it totally turned me off to the whole brand. The pizzas used to be so good at Giordanos.

I don't care if I cause a fight.  I'm a Malnati's fan but that said, there is no better example of the deep dish in Vegas at the moment.

If you never had a deep dish in Chicago, you don't know what you're missing.

Beautiful golden brown, buttery crust adds incredible richness to what must be a 2"" deep,  5lb, loaded pie full of sweet Italian sausage, spicy pepperoni, salami, and bacon all sitting atop a molten lake of melted mozzarella topped by a chunky crushed tomato sauce (""meat & more meat"").  Need a little veg to feel healthy?  The ""Special"" replaces the pure carnivore stuffing with sausage, mushrooms, green peppers and onions and IMHO is better than the ""Chicago Classic"" that subs pepperoni for the incredible Italian sausage.  Best part of the veg, despite the long cooking time, all add flavor while still maintaining some integrity and none, including the mushrooms leave residual water in the pie.

There are more creative pies for the non traditionalist including a vegetarian option.  Additional non traditional fillings (olives, broccoli, jalepenos, meatballs, anchovies, bbq chicken, chicken breast, pesto chicken, and heaven forbid pineapple are all available if you just gotta go all West Coast and ruin the classic.

Note:  Deep dish pies take 45 minutes to cook.  Follow the recommended serving suggestions, they are large.  Think in pounds not ounces.
 
Tip:  skip the starters, pastas, sandwiches, and ridiculous thin crust.  Keep your eye on the prize.

Efficient, Strip friendly service.  

While not as good as the same pies in Chicago; could be the water, the air, maybe the sweat from the Midwest pizza maker, perhaps the angst of Chicago itself, it's still plenty authentic and just plain good.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,25,25,4,S8wy93MJnEMtp_glvUlpvQ

Hopefully getting pizzas out to tables more promptly will rectify the problem as running it outside is not where the problem lies. When you already wait for quite awhile for your pizza to cook I kinda didn't want to wait anymore for it to be re-heated.

Also plans are in the works to get the water filtered for the downstairs dining area. So for future diners, things looks very promising for you to have a good dining experience. Management takes negative feedback seriously. I commend them for that.

My next update review will have to be when I return to Vegas. Maybe another three years?",mwc8rVfuwgfh13HB6hxYmw,4,2,2,Oss4y0KZgpPBL63lPnHvGw
5143471,2017-02-23,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"Being from the east coast, this is a very different kind of pizza. It was very tasty and different. It was a lot of crust and a ton of cheese. Imagine a pie with two inches of cheese inside. The sauce was also pretty good. 

If you are completely against deep dish style pies, they do have a selection of regular thin crust pies.

The bruschetta was very good and the table next to us got the garlic cheese bread which look very good as well.

Be prepared to wait, it takes 45 minutes to an hour to cook a pie. They recommend you order the pie as soon as you sit down and they put it in and the waiter comes back to order appetizers after the pie is in.

Terrible for blind dates (no leaving early) but fun with friends. Just don't come starving like I did.

Pros:
- For Chicago-style deep dish pizza, there's no place else.
- Appetizers come out lightning and gratefully fast. My friends and I split the sampler. The Mozzarella Triangles were my favorite.

Cons:
- Pizza takes forever to come out!
- Don't get the 6 inch personal pie! It's about half the height of the regular pies, and takes just as long to cook. And if you're still hungry after like I was, there's no chance of ordering another pie (unless you want to wait another 45 min)

I wish there was a size between the 6"" thin-deep dish and the 12"" for the one vegetarian in the group who didn't want to share in the main pie everyone else was eating.

So I yelped them (of course). I saw they offered 10% off any online orders. PERFECT! So as the assistant in my office I proceeded to take the individual orders from 8 different people. All 8 of us ordered 6 inch individual deep dish pizzas with all different toppings. 

Placing the order online not only was easy but it gave me the total price of each person. So placed my order at 11:30 and asked for a 12:20 pick up.

The pick up: 3/5 If your doing a pick up, parking is easy but not convenient AT ALL. I parked in the Paris's parking garage. First 30 minutes was free! We walked through half of Paris to get outside to the promenade. Please note there is a pick up window next to starbucks so don't waste your time going to the main restaurant.  Once I finally arrived at the pick up window I paid and the were finishing up the pizzas. By 12:35 I had all 8 pizzas in hand and walking back to my car.

Taste: 5/5 By the time we got back to our office the pizzas were slightly cooled and ready to eat! Once I bit into my pizza, I could taste all the fresh and quality toppings. I wish it had a bit more sauce on it but another than that it was quite perfect. 

Would I go back? Yes, but I would dine in. I want to see a whole pie and try other items on the menu. To improve my rating, I suggest offering delivery.

Original 3/30/17 review:

As good as the Chicago original.

We went to a Giordano's in 2015 while in Chicago for some Royals games.  Just fell in love with this deep dish pizza...very worth the wait.

Visiting Henderson/Vegas this March and found out that this had opened on the Strip.  Because we visit Vegas fairly often, we don't really go to the Strip anymore.  But, by god, we were gonna trek our happy asses anywhere to get this pie.  We got there at opening, so our pizza that probably would have taken 45 min took exactly 1 hour because it was the first pizza in the oven that day and because we ordered a large so we could take some back ""home"" to our friends that we were staying with (they've never had Giordano's).

I'm telling you, this is a heavy pie...TONS of cheese, great ""toppings"" and a nice crispy crust that is just thick enough to hold this work of art together.  So don't go ordering one and then bitching that you have cheese gut :) It's worth it!!  I'm supposed to be dairy and grain free and I did not care one bit what the repercussions would be. 

It was good as what we had in Chicago.  Will go here every trip back to Vegas...guaranteed. Won't be upset if there's a location off the Strip that is more convenient though :)

Wife, son and I were on our way back from the strip and were going to meet our friends at this place for a drink and pizza at i guess would be considered the bar area (we saw people with food and drinks on their tables). Well, the waitress (short hair red-head gal behind the bar) just had the nastiest personality. When we arrived our friends were sitting at the bar and approached to give them a hug. At that time, our friends called my son over to give him a hug as he was getting ready to be stationed to a military base on the following day. My son (19 yrs old) went in and our friends were about to give him a hug when that aforementioned gal began to scream, ""are you 21?!"". I attempted to explain to her that he is merely here to allow our friends an opportunity to give him good wishes on his journey. Well this gal did not want to hear the explenation as she stated in an angry tone, ""well he can wait and say goodbye on the outside of the bar"". We all looked at her like are you serious right now? I tried telling this lady that wife and i are planning on staying, but our son is gonna say goodbye and head back to the room. She still did not want to hear it as she said, ""he can do it from behind thw line"" as she pointed outside of the bar area. We tried to ignore her and my son said his goodbye's and began to leave the area. Well, our friends were like, ""so you guy's going to sit and have some cocktails with us""? We said , ""hell no"", sorry but we are going with our son back to the room. As we left the area i looked back at that nasty attitude of a lady and fake smiled at her while waving and telling her, ""you see, that wasn't so bad was it""? He just wanted to say hi and bye. But her nastyness of a person tried to ruin it for him. I just think if it was that big of deal that a 19 yr old was entering an outdoor bar/restauraunt area that the hostess that we passed on our way in would of stopped us and informed us that he could not enter. But whatever lady behind the bar, your ugly attitude can't ruin our trip here but good try. Nonetheless, will not return to this place because would not want to be treated like this again.

5319891,2017-03-31,7,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"Spending a few years growing up in Chicago where the family is from, deep-dish pizza was our jam. In the Chicago pizza war that includes Lou Malnatti's, Gino's East (boooooo!), and Giordano's (yaaaayyyy!) - I think it's pretty obvious who wins. I'm so happy for a slice of Chicago to land in Vegas. First, it was Garrett's popcorn and now, this! OMG! And I haven't been back to Chi-town in years. I digress.

Anyway, I must say that I actually prefer New York pizza than Chicago pie. But if I must eat deep-dish pizza, it has to be Giordano's hands down. The crust can withstand all the sauce and all the fabulous ingredients. Once you take that first slice of pie, ooey gooey nice and melty cheese just taunts you ""eat me!!!"" I can eat a whole New York pizza by myself. Try doing that with a Chicago pizza - I have yet to witness that! I can only do 2 slices because of how big and thick each slice is.

Sometimes, I like a chicken fettuccine alfredo on the side. Huge portions here so, come hungry. I like the fact that their pizza tastes the same as it would in Chicago. BTW, their pies take a little longer to cook (ummm...because they're thick) so, if you're in a hurry, take your whiney booty to Peeksa Hut.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,11,11,5,BXl5N6WZWeKzzV2TqvU0eA

I don't have a negative thing to say about the place. If you LOVE Chicago Deep Dish Pies like me, you will NOT be disappointed. Just make sure you have the time to spend there.

Came here to have an early dinner with my boyfriend, his cousin, and my brother. We've been hearing and seeing so much about Giordano's and it was a perfect opportunity to go. The cousin was visiting from overseas and he loves burgers and pizzas so what's better than showing him something he can't find outside of America? 

We were seated rather quickly after we got to the establishment. They actually have two locations -- sort of. One outdoor area and one that's indoors but on the upper floor. 

Beware, if you're ordering a pizza, be sure you know which one you want asap and order that first because their pizzas take a good amount of time to be cooked. 

We ended up ordering a house salad, cheesy garlic bread, and their small classic chicago deep dish pizza. The salad was a salad. Th cheesy garlic bread was pretty good -- although, I may prefer regular garlic bread. It had good flavor but I think the cheese interrupts a lot of the buttery garlic goodness. To me, anyways. 

The pizza, oh man, the pizza. Cheesy, gooey, warm, hearty, fulfilling goodness. There was pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions. But who cares what's in it! It's the CHEESE that matters! It was DELICIOUS GOODNESS. If you get a large size of their stuffed deep dish pizza, they put 1 kilo of cheese in it, which is roughly 2.2lbs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is very filling though so be sure you come hungry, otherwise, you won't be eating much and you'll be facing a lot of left overs. I only managed to eat one slice of the pizza cause it was just too much for me! Regardless though, it was very delicious. 

The prices of everything were also very reasonable for the strip. We got a pitcher of blue moon and it only cost about $17. That was 4 glasses of beer .. which would've cost us close to $28 total if we were to drink elsewhere.

I would definitely recommend Giordano's if you're in the area and if you love cheese :)",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,2,1,4,_Wa6aE1VIH4Jfvs8-UHh5g

We were seated at their downstairs bar, and enjoyed the people watching, with football on their TVs. 8 total, I think? Upon greeting, the server was quick to remind us that the deep dish takes awhile, so while we browsed the beer list, he put our pizza order in. Decent beer list, could definitely use more craft! I was impressed they do carry one from a local brewery, Crafthaus. Drink local! I work for another local one. We ended up with two Stone Ruination IPAs. Great prices on the drinks, for Strip standards. For our appetizer, we went with the cheesy bread, which was pretty good! I wanted the wings, but the mister really wanted that bread. The blend of cheeses was really nice, with a tangy marinara on the side. I'll pass on the extra carbs next time, though, after eating that pizza... which leads me.... That deep dish pie... oh my... we kept it simple with just sausage, as we wanted to experience the flavor of the sauce, cheese and crust. It was mouthwateringly delicious. My husband is from Chicago, and he honestly got a little emotional after first bite lol. Finally great pizza in Vegas! They have a system in place to filter their water so it's just like the h2o they have in Chicago, to ensure the same flavors as the original. You can definitely tell, it's authentic, according to my hubby. I can't wait for the leftovers already, even though I'm still stuffed. Only slight bummer.. We really wanted the cannolis for dessert, but they ran out. It's ok, though, they're still getting their wings ready to fly. The tiramisu was a wonderful substitute. Would order again.

Good morning Michael,

I have to apologize for replying back to you this late. I appreciate your message and I am humble to have received it. I'm going to take your offer and please refund us our meal (I have attached the receipt).  I cannot take your second offer in bringing my family back for a second chance.  In Las Vegas, theirs too many restaurants to give one a second chance.  For us, once we love the the food, we write about it and continue to come back to it.  I just believe that there were too many eyes from your staff that saw our pie and didn't take it back or say something.  From the guy that served us (and us pointing it out there, he just turned towards the back like he was looking for someone), to the waiter that saw three half eaten slices on our plates, saw the rest of the pizza untouched and said that our cannoli's we're on our way out.  Instead of asking us if their was a problem or how was our pizza,  would of at least open the door.  
Don't let me get started on those poor cannoli's too, they were soft, they came frozen to your kitchen then microwaved (very sad) to our plate. 
We're not one to make a scene or to get mad and storm off.  This is why we love Yelp! You even made a comment that ""the execution of my pizza wasn't right"".  I totally agree, and I agree that there are different types of thickness to deep dishes in Chicago but the one that's pictured on each of your tables (for marketing, to take a deep dish home) isn't what we got. Even pictures that I screen shot and attached here have that second layers you guys promote (and you mentioned) and ours had a cheese thick bottom, with a barely rationed sauce and some pepperonis. 
I just believe that customers should have that one time experience to continue to come back.  Unfortunately, ours was just overlooked, ignored and we are here.   But I wish you and your restaurant the best. 

Let me know if you need anything else for my refund. 

Regards,
Luis F.

I visited with my son, cousin, and family friend. When my cousins pizza came out it was accidentally dropped on him by another waiter. My cousin was burned by the pizza, his new clothes stained by the pizza, and the waiter used his hands to unfold the pizza as if my cousin could still eat it. Our original waitress came out and took the pizza away and put in another order. The manager and our asking if my cousin was ok and apologized but never offered to compensate his meal. 

My cousin had to wait an additional 20 minutes for a replacement pizza, while we were all finished with our food. When the bill comes the waitress says we are going to give you 50% off the pizza. Really? For burning me, ruining my clothes, and waisting my time I get 50% off. Oh no no no no! Our family friend spoke up and said he needs to not pay anything considering this inconvenience. We weren't looking for free meals, but my cousin definitely shouldn't have paid anything.

The waitress had to check with the manager to get approval for a free pizza. His final decision was to only remove the pizza charge, but they still charged for my cousins lemonade and calamari appetizer. I will not be returning to this location based off of this experience. I've visited Giordanos in Chicago and wanted my family to have the experience of good food that I had there.

Pro tip- the deep dish pizzas take 45 minutes to master. Come starving, or not, because if you are- you will be completely full soon, and if you aren't, you shouldn't mind waiting. The wait is what it is- and it won't change. Perfection takes time, so don't complain.

Giordanos deep dish is an experience. The sauce is on top of the ocean of cheese below. This time we went with an individual to split and each got a side salad. One star loss for my Greek salad because it had some old looking lettuce. Not a huge deal, but would have been an easy fix.

This amount of food was perfect because we were hungry but not starving. We actually went with some tiramisu at the end. It was still partially frozen- and our server said he had never sold dessert to anyone before. Haha. 

All in all it was pretty great. If you have the chance, go to the one in Chicago, but this is a great option as well. :)",y_XgW02VKRwDKGhHq17yuA,0,0,4,gNOP3Sv1PSkzSB7J_a9d1Q

I was disappointed that there was no apology or anything said it was just plopped in front of me. But I was extremely hungry at that point. 
The pizza itself was awesome. It was cheesy deliciousness that was flakey and saucy. It was definitely a Chicago deep dish that you would expect. 
Even after waiting so long for the pizza and the mix up with the first one the bartender never came back to see if everything was ok. I was sitting at the bar, it wouldn't have been hard to do a quick fly by. By the time I got the check I had been there for over two hours most of the time just waiting. 
The food here is great, but the service left something to be desired.",98BB-9KO_RySfLuafz9TKw,0,0,3,_whOt5Rxmh1Gm_3mHsHC_A

CHEESE!
DEEP DISH!
Yup, that's what you get at Giordano's, now in Vegas at Bally's Grand Bazaar Shops.  Those cheese pulls are the real deal because if you order a deep dish pizza, it's filled with cheesy goodness.  I can only handle about 1.5 slices exactly because it's a lot of stuff, but delicious stuff.  
We arrived today around noon and it was perfect timing because the lunch rush started right after that.  Just know that an order of deep dish takes about 35-45 minutes to prepare, a warning that's printed right on the menu.  We ordered the Harvest Green salad to eat while we waited. The salad has spring greens, candied walnuts, dried fruit and blue cheese tossed in balsamic, a nice and light combination of ingredients.  The medium size is enough for two people.
Our waiter, Jose, was good about keeping us informed about the status of our pizza, letting us know when it was five minutes from arriving.  When it did, we were ready to chow down.  Jose did the honors of serving us our slices, cheese pulling included.  I am a big fan of the cheesiness of this pizza and the crust seals the deal.  Like I stated before, a little goes a long way; this stuff is so thick that one slice is probably equivalent to two regular thin crust slices.  
If you go with the intention of ordering deep dish, just be prepared to wait, but it's worth it.
Service was wonderful throughout the meal and if you can sit by the window, you have a nice view.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,4,4,4,ATUxcz7BhSvyidYtTi6gkA

We ordered a salad & potato fritters to start (so bomb), we shared alfredo pasta & spaghetti, and finished our meal with a deep dish Chicago pizza. Everything was delicious! 

However, it was odd that no one who worked here was friendly. The hostess was not friendly or hospitable. I asked the bartender if he could make a few cocktails? A French 75 which is champagne, gin, little simple syrup, with a lemon twist - blunt no. No other recommendations or alternative suggestions? And our waitress was accommodating, but not overly so. It was peculiar that no one we interacted with that worked here was nice. This is your job and a smile goes a long way. 

With that being said, when I come back to Las Vegas I would for sure eat here again. The food was great & the atmosphere awesome. Live Las Vegas!",td-RLO3vjf7sYk51kS_JZg,0,0,3,UBi4917VLR8xfpxdfYjr6w

It's worth the trip though to get the real deal, but that includes the real wait time. For us on the second visit it was a solid 50 minutes for the pizza to arrive. The couple next to us looked like they were really suffering with an empty table for so long. Hint: eat your salad or appetizer very sloooowly...

Also note that if you eat in the main indoor dining room it is very loud. There is no place for sounds to be absorbed given the concrete floors, absence of window treatments, etc.

5675585,2017-09-08,1,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"Giordano's is my favorite Chicago pizzeria and it's taken me far too long to visit the Vegas location.

It's hard to explain what makes this pizza so damn delicious - it's very different from ""normal"" pizza. It's got super thick, buttery crust and tons of cheese. It's basically stuffed pizza, because only the tomato sauce is on top. My absolute favorite is the spinach pie, which I originally tried in Chicago. We recently met my hubby's Aunt for dinner while she was in town for a conference and we decided to share a salad and a custom pizza. We basically wanted all meat and veggies and we got what we asked for.

This is a busy place and the pizza takes time to cook, so be ready! They have a decent beer selection, with even a couple of local taps. The service was friendly and it was semi-baby friendly. I say semi because we were seated upstairs and the baby blocked an aisle because the tables were close together. It's also pretty loud, so if you have a child and they are sensitive to noise, I might say to avoid this place. Luckily, our kid sleeps better the louder it is, so we didn't have any problems.

I wish that Giordano's built locally, rather than on the Strip. But I get it - unfortunately, it just means we won't visit often. It's such a hassle to deal with parking at Bally's, especially now that they are charging (although it's currently still free for locals).

Listen and stop over talking.  Not once did any ""manager"" or overly dressed food runner ever come to our table to see how things were

There is nothing special about the sauce. They served our extra crispy pizza cold.  They forgot to add the jalapeños on the other pizza yet didn't forget to charge. 

And the deep dish well our friend wanted green olives yet when his wife bit into her pizza she got a big jalapeño bite. Mind you the deep dish had Zero jalapeños.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our experience started well with a polite waitress, prompt drinks and order.  We were advised that the pizza takes at least an hour to cook which was completely fine and we anticipated that since we have had Chicago style deep dish before.  

Then things went down hill quickly.  Our drinks were never refilled without us begging for it, our appetizer took 40 mins to get, we couldn't get silverware and had to ask a different waiter for forks.  He got mad, rolled his eyes, and asked ""WHO IS YOUR WAITER?""  I replied that if I could find her, I wouldn't be bothering him for forks.  He left and came back 5 minutes later.  

The pizza was good but not the best that we've had.

After we finished, we had pizza left over for later and needed a box.  Our waitress reappeared and took the pizza away for boxing and our bill.  That took another 10 minutes.   By this time I was annoyed and told my husband to get a bag from the bartender (our table was right by the bar).  The bartender looked shocked when asked for a bag even though he had just given one to another gentleman that was eating at the bar.  He said he would be right back....yup, another 5 minutes.  In the meantime I asked for a manager and that is when a table near ours told me that they needed the manager next.  They had opened their silverware and the napkin and fork were covered in dried blood.  We saw the silverware and it was indeed blood and it was disgusting.

The manager was very nice and gracious.  She apologized profusely and refunded our money even though we initially declined.  Our waitress came over to apologize and explain that she had been given too many tables in different areas of the restaurant and her concerns were ignored.

I'm not sure if we would give this place another chance.",zrW2ucEGZEwSCw8Fd9olKQ,0,0,5,CENxU2gFbOOGbTYQu7USmQ

We were the only customers at the bar.  We had a simple order of a small cheese pizza and two sodas. After waiting over 40 minutes, we asked someone to please check on our pizza.  We were told that it takes 30 to 45 minutes.

I would not recommend sitting in the out door area as there is a serious lag time between when your food is made and when it is served to you; even on the simplest of orders.

The Green Peppers and onion dominated the dish, but it was nevertheless very good served with a mild Marinara Sauce.  Then a fairly large bowl of Chopped Salad was very satisfying, with lettuce, tomatoes, scallions, bacon, red cabbage, pieces of chicken breast, Bleu Cheese crumbles, bits of pasta, peas, and a mild Honey Mustard Dressing.

5893727,2017-09-18,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"My friends and I stopped here for some dinner while meeting up in Vegas this weekend. 

We ordered the Chicago classic and the veggie deep dish. They told us the deep dish takes 35-45 minutes, which was fine with us. We ordered the appetizer sampler and greens salad to snack on while we waited. 

My friend and I had flown in that evening so we were starving. 20 minutes goes by and no appetizer or salad. I kept trying to find our waiter but he was no where to be found. After 30 minutes our appetizer sampler arrived. I asked the bus boy who delivered it where our salad was and told him we had been waiting forever. 10 minutes later our salad came out. I'm not sure why it took 40 minutes to bring our salad but when it arrived it was drenched in salad dressing and soggy. We barely touched it.

After an hour of sitting and waiting our pizza finally arrived. I was excited to finally get some real food. The appetizers were comparable to snacks you'd find in the freezer section of the grocery store. But the pizza was absolutely horrendous. I had one slice of the veggie and was completely disgusted. The sauce was gross, the veggies weren't fresh. It was just gross. 

The service was slow and rude on top of it all. And they never even checked in to ask how things were. Overall a horrible dining experience.",gmm6XPBna6QwDvk2JFUZUQ,0,0,1,83doUFhyLMhpKnz2yurz3g
5904748,2017-04-26,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"On our last trip to Vegas we decided to give this place a go.  We decided to sit out in the newly constructed section going down the main strip of the Bazaar.  I cold imagine that sitting out there in the summer could become kind of hot but it looks like they have a mist system installed.....still prob going to be hot though.  

Knowing that our pizza would take 45 minutes we were unsure of what appetizer to order, luckily they have a sampler plate so it made it easy.  The sampler plate came out and it soon become apparent that we should have just ordered the mozzarella trianges....they were by far the all star out of the bunch, followed up by the wings.

So the pizza came out and the waiter did the long string cheese move.  Pizza was pretty good but my only gripe is that they don't have honey to eat the crust with.  The honey would have pushed this review up to a 5 star and the end crust really needs it if you're going to eat the whole thing.  

The service is what you'd expect and our waiter kept coming back to make sure we were doing ok while waiting for the pizza.  Overall a good place to eat...when we come back I might have to smuggle in some honey for the crust.",VxvFf0NeKk5lT-4Wdp9qkw,0,1,4,4lY5gDgTtEtMkIBD6ePYpA

We ordered the bruschetta which was amazing. We also ordered a medium house salad with lemon vinaigrette. Excellent as well. You must be extremely patient for the deep dish. We ordered a small and should have ordered the personal. We had 3 slices and we were full. Overall, I would do take out as they have a lunch special next time. It was good not excellent or to wait that long.",3fTNoAmlXNAkIaMCmBQjLQ,0,1,3,PzSNKZT1w8vC3u7zUPtmlg

5938149,2017-03-19,1,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"They sat us right away, which for a Saturday night, we thought there would be a long wait. So that was great. The waitress kinda explained to us about how the pizza cook time works (45 minutes to an hour) which we understood. So we put our order in for a medium stuffed deep dish and waited. She was very nice in keeping us updated on how far along our pizza was coming, and refilled our water regularly. When it finally came to our table, it wasn't hot. At all. It wasn't even warm. The onions were raw and cut into huge pieces (is that the Chicago way?). We ate it anyway because we had waited for so long. I would probably recommend to just get the grab and go downstairs or get the frozen pizza you can just cook at your home. At least then you know you will be getting a hot pizza.",RRyU9z6S2e6mpNngh6ogSw,0,0,4,urilixbIOyRpSiiVv4GzkQ
5954099,2018-04-01,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"It's 35 minutes past my requested pickup time for my online order which I booked more than an hour ago. The cashier at the window did warn me when I arrived to pay that it would take about 15 to 20 minutes of wait...which is ridiculous because isn't the point of online ordering to get your food to-go upon arrival instead of waiting longer inside the restaurant? I placed an online order to save time so I can get on with my other plans for the rest of tonight!

About 5 minutes ago I asked the cashier again for my order and only then did she glance at my receipt under the scanner on the register that she tells me ""they're just cutting up your pizza"" and ""it'll be here soon."" Then I spotted her putting my receipt on the board. (Something tells me that chick never placed my order to the kitchen...).

Not impressed with this Vegas location. Sadly the multiple Giordano's in Chicago will always be better.

----------------------

**edit**
40 minutes!
Went up to the window and the cashier already knew what I was about to ask. She offered to call her manager (which I agreed to) and moments later he arrived to speak with me. He explained that my pizza was ready (side note: WHY is it the food arrives right when you begin to complain and demand a refund?!), but the salad and appetizers were only a few more minutes away. I was tired enough already, so I still asked to cancel everything. He voided my payment for the order, apologized multiple times, but did ask once again if I wanted the pizza...which was sitting in the warmer(?!?!). Ugh, fine then, give me the pizza! Why did that come out first anyway????

While I do appreciate the manager coming to talk to me while quickly getting the problem resolved without forcing me to resorting to acting rude (*thank you*), this entire experience shouldn't have happened at all and no one should have to go through that ever.",qNmalUH9giHO-0WuMkmLzg,1,0,1,YzD-fNHPaFB8i5AzKrHJTQ
5979201,2017-07-26,0,lwxYmWqjmEZ0ukCsXC9Pfg,"Als Liebhaber der deep dish Pizzas, welche ursprünglich aus Chicago stammen, war ich natürlich auch bei meinem letzten Trip nach Las Vegas erpicht darauf ein Restaurant zu finden welches diese serviert. Gab es vor ein paar Jahren noch nur ein paar wenige Adressen hierfür, scheint die Szene zwischenzeitlich Zuwachs erhalten und sich ausgedehnt zu haben. Giordano's ist als eines der wenigen Restaurants direkt am Strip und hatte zudem sehr gute Bewertungen, welche vollends erfüllt wurden. Die Pizza schmeckt wirklich lecker wie es sein soll auch wenn sie nicht ganz an das Original aus dem mittleren Westen rankommen. Dort ist die Teigzusammensetzung einfach irgendwie anders, evtl. mit einem höheren Anteil Maismehl als man es hier hat. Das Ambiente des Restaurants ist zudem eher laut was aber typisch Las Vegas ist und deshalb eigentlich auch passt. Plus, für eine Handvoll Dollars wird man hier richtig voll wo man in einem Steakhouse für das gleiche Geld höchstens 100g Filet kriegt. Deshalb ein absolutes Muss für jeden Pizzafan der sein Leibgericht mal von einer anderen Seite kennenlernen möchte. Aus unserer 6er Gruppe waren allesamt begeistert von der deep dish!",4xkmVbqGBth8QnguPYqKBg,0,0,4,007oygdqSEDLqHWv-z_bIg
