39306,2017-09-17,0,c_3abcaptUG0d4A4LWMe7w,Worst place to eat late at night. They had one lady do both the drive thru and inside register. She was way to slow to being doing both and management had no sense give her help. Waited at drive thru for 15 minutes before they took the order of car in front of us and that car finally drove off. That place needs new management. I think everyone that works there didn't graduate High School.,zBNDvY4SjYyi7wLXa0XMuQ,1,0,1,zVSrCISkfKgi-KwEDc2GzQ

The young woman with the name Elaine on the name tag handed me the coke and said: ""Are you happy now beach?"" I was shocked! I asked for the manager.... no manager... so I asked for her full name... I received a ""faked"" name: ""Mariah"" ... it looks like they work as a team to protect one another... they removed their name tags! Then, the young woman Elaine came back to the window with a different weird name tag... with a changed name on it : ""Mariah"" / What is going on here?... are they so afraid that I'll complain?... I turned around with my car to get inside the store but I saw Elaine running fast to lock it. Instead of being polite and apologize for the mistake... they waisted my time and other clients time as well. I will call the management right after the weekend and will see how this will be handled. I may as well go to the press!! The food wasn't good either... the fries were burned and the Hamburger a bit of a mess. Don't go there... you'll be disappointed!

236094,2014-01-17,0,c_3abcaptUG0d4A4LWMe7w,"So I usually love this Carl's, the food is always great and fresh and the employees at incredibly friendly. However, I always order the low carb six dollar guacamole bacon burger (say that 3x fast! ) and sometimes, understandably, its hard for the people in the drive-thru to catch all of what I'm saying. So I say it slow and they repeat it back to me to make sure they got it right.

There's a couple employees who get it right, but it seems like there's always some issue. Either I'm charged for a low carb burger and I get one with a bun (which is fine because the LC is cheaper and I just take off the bun) or, like tonight, there is no guacamole or bacon. This is already after they initially forgot the LC part and I had to say the whole thing over again.

Not really complaining because this burger is comfort food for me regardless, and I guess people don't order these burgers very often,  its just a pet peeve. But everything else here is stellar for a fast food place.",vQHmyZJsrcLjtlGmVsKa5w,1,0,4,QqpfdaouAr0gQjisUFDmsg
