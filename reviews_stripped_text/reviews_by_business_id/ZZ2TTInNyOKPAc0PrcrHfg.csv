It is very true when people say, "" the innocent are always the ones to get hurt."" I will never come back to this grocery store and to make it so bad this was my first time of going in the El Super. All I can say is: Enter At Your Own Risk, and be prepared to be racially profiled.",Nsm9dJF3t1t3SYQKpgUPXQ,3,0,1,yv71SvZxWxyMC5OcO_02GA
1201208,2012-12-08,0,ZZ2TTInNyOKPAc0PrcrHfg,"My mother-in-law has been suggesting that I try to check out this store if i'm looking for cheap & fresh produce.  And also told me their meat section is good as well.  It was my 1st visit today & I wasn't in this store too long as I was with my WHOLE fam bam (MIL, my parentals, my child & hubby... just a lil bit of a distraction. lol).  It wasn't that busy.  No lines @ the butcher which was a good thing i guess.  I always hear it's sometimes impossible to get through.  I didn't get to check out everything so it's only the reason why I give it 3-stars (for now).  From my observation of this store though, it seemed to be well stocked.  Everything from produce, a quick look down the aisles looked good, butcher section looked clean & organized.  I'm someone who does price comparisons a lot but sorry guys.... this time I wasn't really paying attention.  I can say some of the produce was actually pretty cheap tho.  I don't live close to this place so if I get a chance to visit this store again, I'll do a review update.",u69_aHDTcGpLTAxwxFPHsw,1,0,3,voWDWzcd47RzvOp3J62Daw

2594527,2014-10-19,0,ZZ2TTInNyOKPAc0PrcrHfg,It is an average supermarket with decent prices. Watch their weekly ad for some amazingly good deals.,d5q0qsqcZFgWRJw7Lq4PjA,1,0,3,cjKFzwvIwDpNIqTk2XH4Ug
2694058,2014-04-11,0,ZZ2TTInNyOKPAc0PrcrHfg,Really upset about this place. Went there specifically for item on ad. They were out and i was told i could get raincheck. Decided to wait in long line for only 4 items and get raincheck. Once i got up there and paid for my items i was told i couldnt get a raincheck. I like this store and go out of my way to shop here.

3386557,2016-12-30,0,ZZ2TTInNyOKPAc0PrcrHfg,"If I could give this store no stars, I would.  I have been in this store a few times.  The staff is  consistently rude and not very bright.  I was treated horribly by a customer ahead of me in line.  The cashier, Nely, thought it was very amusing.  She totaled my purchase and acted like she was doing me a big favor.  Told her to cancel my order and to have a nice day.  Left the store and won't be back.  To make matters even worse, when I parked in their lot, two slots away from my car was a dead chicken.  Shopping options in this part of town are very questionable and limited.  I will say that I do shop at Cardenas on Bonanza and the staff there is welcoming, friendly and helpful.  My Spanish is limited and they never make me feel uncomfortable with my lack of communication skills.  They actually go out of their way to help me with my Spanish.  Parking lot of Cardenas could use some paving attention, but the store is clean and well stocked.  Guess I learned my El Super lesson today.  Go to Cardenas.",il_vFIsqk3CjwKOWbuhKfQ,3,0,1,OnGs60LxutrN8nYmxrWOOA
3786822,2015-03-16,0,ZZ2TTInNyOKPAc0PrcrHfg,Tres Leches cake is off the hook. Candied almonds shaving on the side! Great deals on fruits and vegetables.  My five stars are going to the bakery. They have lots of sweet breads to choose from and fresh tortillas. I would give the meat and cheese counters a 4. The rest of the store I would rate a 2. There really isn't much stuff to choose from product wise compared to Albertsons and Smiths. The store is targeted towards the Latin community.  Stuff like shampoo is limited to selection and the prices are outrageous.,y0X31AJuc8IzZBRmRZerRw,2,0,5,m0T7l0zewT49dKPX0rEBSQ
4395430,2013-09-26,3,ZZ2TTInNyOKPAc0PrcrHfg,"El Super is located off of Charleston and Lamb near Home Depot. This used to be Luckys/Rally's, so it's pretty big for a Mexican supermarket. My mom comes here mainly for good, cheap fruits.  She usually comes for papaya, mangos, cucumbers, jicama, pineapple, and watermelon. 

They also have marinated meat, fresh salsa (roja, verde, sometimes they have pico de gallo), and different kinds of crema (salt/no salt) available towards the back of the store.  Feel free to ask for samples! They gave me 2 heaping scoops of crema because I was unsure of which one I wanted. 

Everything is priced pretty reasonably. I always leave the store paying 20 bucks or less for a cart full of fresh fruits. 

*They sell dried hibiscus flowers. Use them to make some agua de jamaica! Soo good! 

*You can find chamangos in the frozen section. $8 for a pack of 4. I haven't tried it yet since the places you can get fresh ones aren't too far from home.",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,7,4,4,C6cA313Bj174JUa_aLyV_g

I recall that they're produce is cheaper than other local places and I believe their seafood is also.",BS3qOK1iRLcWtoV9KnwyXg,1,0,4,9fHO6qMUsMnhi_5wVipI4Q
4843181,2012-08-20,0,ZZ2TTInNyOKPAc0PrcrHfg,"I don't know how they do it, but El Super sells everything CHEAPER!  Produce, fabric softener, etc.  The one negative thing about El Super is that there are lines everywhere!  We waited more than 10 minutes for meats and decided to give up.  The lines at checkout were also long, but I guess that's the cost for lower prices.  The only other complaint I have is that they don't have any locations near my house!",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,2,0,5,6TRSBodjGSPf5X5Bd9na_Q
4879014,2015-10-11,0,ZZ2TTInNyOKPAc0PrcrHfg,"Good for vegetables and fruits.
I don't buy meat, but the freah meat and seafood counter seems to be priced low as well. 
I avoid the packaged goods and snacks and can pick those  up cheaper at other chains.
I can feed myself for a week for $10.
Fresh corn  tortillas are tp notch.

I should have taken a picture,  the place can get extremely crowded.

4936837,2011-06-29,2,ZZ2TTInNyOKPAc0PrcrHfg,"I've been to El Super about 2 or 3 times but I never check in b/c its not added online. I go to the 24 Hour Fitness that's caddy corner to this place. Although it is easier to just go next door to Liborio, I go across the way to El Super b/c I've heard good things about their items especially about their produce. Super cheap! 

PRODUCE: Red delicious apples were 2 lbs for 99cents! Bradenton apples for 79cents/lb. What the? that's HALF of what walmart or most stores charge, heck less than half. I also bough Pinalinaza which last time I saw this for sale inside King Ranch Market (which is now called something else btw) it was $13.99. Maybe that was a typo b/c today I only paid $4.99 for it., oh and Tajin which is a red chile spice you can sprinkle on all kinds of produce from sweet fruits to cucumbers to pineapple to everythin in betweena and its utterly addictive. If you've never tried it, they sell fruit cups with it sprinkled on it with lime -usually for $4.00- or you can buy your won fruit here for fractions of that and cut it up yourself and go crazy. to me its a great way to start eating more whole foods again. 

this is as far as I got, more updates to come soon but I'm trying to eat better and sticking to the ""perimeter of the store"" rule to not eat as many processed foods, and this place is a great place for that b/c the produce was the best deals I saw. And since I'm a broke college student I got only what I needed by not letting myself get a cart. I got 2 lbs of apples, Tajin, green tea, pinalinaza, mole, tomatoes all for $10. cant beat it with a stick. 

which im sure they sell there as well!",cafRiSVWRXlxDEK2YNrJ6g,3,2,4,K9Jvw9SbuAPaClUxw8lTFQ

5392703,2012-03-13,0,ZZ2TTInNyOKPAc0PrcrHfg,"Some of the best prices in Las Vegas.

Whenever I am on this side of town I make sure to visit El Super.  Other times I just take their ad to WalMart for price matching.  

Their Wednesday produce selections are usually crazy cheap (recently there were 8lbs of oranges for a dollar, 3 lbs of Italian Squash for a $1, and even 2 lbs of green beans for $1).  Thursday meat specials are hit and miss, sometimes amazing and sometimes not worth the drive.  Recently pork spare ribs or beef ribs were $1 a pound, another time pork legs were $0.79 a lb.

BUT be warned.  The lines here are always long.  It can get dirty.  And don't buy your normal (non-Hispanic) goods here, unless they are on sale, otherwise your meat and produce savings will be negated by their otherwise high prices.",sdiGHP8vk3QuMTYaVsmanw,1,1,4,WXpmei7bfa6FYxM6OZzpHQ
5420654,2017-07-30,1,ZZ2TTInNyOKPAc0PrcrHfg,"This was my first and last visit to your market. I went in with my sister and two friends, who wanted to come and shop because the friends always shop there. at the meat part, no one called the numbers in english; good thing i can count in spanish. we were getting the evil eyes..but here is the kicker...

RACIAL PROFILING BY MEXICANS!!!!

we go to pay for our items and the assistant manager, francisco, comes up to me and my sister and says that someone said they saw us put something in our purses. my sister was like, no, why would we steal? and he told her that someone had saw her put something in her purse. she asked him why would someone say something like that...she told him to check her purse and he kept apologizing and just said that he was told. and she asked him if he wanted to check her purse and he said that was not necessary. she opened her purse and he looked and kept apologizing. 
let me say, that i expect this behavior from white people not people who are brown like me!!!
the store stinks to high heaven and the products seem old! why would we steal?? we work and i told the manager that we work. i feel that he was expecting us to be loud and abrasive negroes; not the case! dont judge us!!! 
you will not have to worry about my black ass coming back in your stores and I am going to draw attention to this happening and wondering how many other blacks this has happened to....",nWQZkvuWYtFjgw9GxQL8JQ,2,0,1,BVOWRN0LyIdjys5roasiZQ
