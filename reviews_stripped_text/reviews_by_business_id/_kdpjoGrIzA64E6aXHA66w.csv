33929,2015-06-20,1,_kdpjoGrIzA64E6aXHA66w,"This is my first yelp review but felt I had to say something. We were excited to come here for the end of the week happy hour and to get ready for the weekend but were surprised how bland the food was.  It was obvious that they did not use fresh ingredients.  We ordered a few items that were served within two minutes, which leads us to believe that is pre-made and either sitting under a heat lamp or microwaved for quick delivery.  The food came quickly and was really hot for about 45-60 seconds on the surface but cool on the inside. We ordered the stuffed artichokes that were rubbery (squeaked as you chewed), mac and cheese was ok and the tortilla a la espanola had no flavor, not even the ""spicy"" sauce that comes with it and the last thing you would want is lukewarm eggs and potatoes. Finally, we got the chicken picatta. This was the last one to come out so they probably cooked this one. The sauce and potatoes that comes with it were good. Chicken was ok, basically a pounded out chicken breast. Maybe they don't make their food for happy hour and just reuse leftovers. The food was bland, nothing like real tapas or true Barcelona flavor. The service was ok, nothing horrible but nothing great - didn't feel really welcomed but not neglected either.  After reading the reviews I was expecting something great and was completely disappointed. I will not be gong back and would not recommend this restaurant.",280dRONg0OvAVijQZMpdRg,2,1,2,JNd1TLyw3V51Y9FYuwEh9g

Fried goat cheese--soooo yummy, the balsamic reduction was a great touch

Sliders w/ chipotle aioli and fries -- very flavorful, tender ground beef, well seasoned. The fries are amazing!!

Eggplant canneloni -- my wife chose this because she loves eggplant. She says it was top notch--I liked it, but eggplant is simply not my cup of tea.

Surf and turf -- 3 skewers of shrimp, steak and chorizo. We both really enjoyed this.

House salad -- light and refreshing.

And the best part of the experience??? The deep fried chocolate tres leches a la mode -- simply amazing.

Our server was less than enthusiastic, was not very attentive. We ordered from the AYCE menu, and ordered probably about 8 items to start, between two of us. 4 of those items came out and then we waited, and waited, and waited. Our server came back out to ask if we wanted to order more, and we informed him we were still waiting for the original items we ordered. He informed us we would check on them. A couple more items were brought out, but the mac and cheese never did (the only item I knew my 2 yr old would eat) I reminded him again of the item, meanwhile trying to keep my hungry 2 yr old calm... and it still was the last item to come out, about 30 minutes later. When we asked for our bill, I informed him that we had a $10 off from Restaurant.com before hand, yet he still brought the bill without the discount. The whole process of getting our bill took over 20 minutes. There were only 2 other parties in the restaurant, so it wasn't due to being busy, I think it was just late, and it was just poor service.

The quality of the food has got to follow. As much as I really wanted to like the food and was hoping that this place could be a good alternative to Firefly, it just was not. Overall the food was bland, low quality ingredients and clearly nothing is homemade. The worst were the meatballs, avoid them at all costs. They were hard as a rock and no taste. Clearly pre-maid, frozen and re-heated in the microwave (I am single, I know what those taste like!). Second to worst was the manchego and bacon mac&cheese. I had this before in other tapas places and it is a party in your mouth. This one was bland and floury. Not sure how they screwed this one up. 
Also as one would expect portions are small, it is a tapas place. I have no issue with small portion but it needs to burst with flavor.  On a good note, the bacon wrapped dates are good.

551050,2016-01-04,2,_kdpjoGrIzA64E6aXHA66w,"Let it be known that I made a Yelp account to review this place. That's how bad this place is. 

Let's just say that the best thing about Barcelona Tapas is its proximity to Smiths, where you can buy alcohol after your meal to drown your sorrows because you just paid $22 for food you could make better completely wasted. 

My husband, friend, and I decided to try this place based off reviews and the fact that it is close to our home. We were really hoping for a decent, reasonably priced restaurant we could frequent. What we found was a restaurant that none of us will ever return to unless we are forced by violence or perhaps paid copious amounts of money. 

Exaggerations aside, save your money. If you are expecting an experience and quality similar to that of Firefly (pre-food poisoning fiasco) then be prepared to be disappointed. This review will be covering the ALL YOU CAN EAT (AYCE) DINNER menu. 

To be honest, the restaurant should be sued for false advertising - it should be called YOU CAN EAT SAMPLES. Have you been to Costco or Sam's Club? You know the samples they pass out on busy days that you gulp down in one bite? That is all you can order off the AYCE menu. I know, I know. You're wondering - what?! It clearly says chicken SKEWERS! With an S! Ah, if only the individuals running the business had a strong understanding of the English language. Let me tell you: IT IS ONE. ONE OF EVERYTHING? Stuffed mushroom? ONE MUSHROOM. Chicken skewers? ONE SKEWER. ONE! If you knew this going in, you might not be irritated. You might think, okay. Chicken skewer. My husband and I are eating, so let me order 4 chicken skewers so we can have two each. But the menu implies others (what with the restaurant owner not understanding the difference between plural and singular nouns) so you order one chicken SKEWERS, thinking you will get two or three. You wait twenty minutes and are presented with a tiny stick with the smallest amount of chicken on it, so small that you seriously utter, ""what the ****?"" You consume it in .0004 seconds and request 6 more, waiting 20 more minutes for them to arrive. Did I mention there's a 90 minute limit? I am not sure if the errors are intentional or not, but they are definitely frustrating to any customer who is fluent in the English language. 

While you are eagerly waiting for your chicken SKEWERS (at this point you're still thinking you're going to get 2 or 3), you observe the chef talking to every table...except yours. Firstly, if Gordon Ramsay were in da house, he would be wondering why the hell the chef is out of the kitchen more than he is in it. That aside, the chef seemed to frequent tables who did not purchase AYCE or tables occupied by older guests. We were the only table that appeared to be mid-20s and apparently we did not deserve a hello or greeting from the chef. We also were not greeted when we arrived. 

The chef actually finally came to our table after our friend requested that the waitress remove an item from his check because it was basically inedible. The chef came and yes, he did ask what he could do to fix it or make our experience better. My friend looked at me and I shrugged, at which point he responded that there wasn't anything to be done, thank you, but we're going to finish up, leave, and never return. The chef became somewhat aggressive, again questioning how he could remedy the terrible experience. I ask you, fellow Yelpers - how do you tell a chef that the only way to fix your experience is to construct a working time machine so that you can teleport two hours back in time and avoid ever coming to his restaurant in the first place? I'm not sure there's a nice way to say that. 

Sure, there were dollar beers. That come in mini 8 oz glasses and taste like cucumber or a more evil version of Budweiser. They are likely $1 because the chef is hoping you'll get wasted on them and forget how god awful the food is. 

Not only was the quality of the food THOROUGHLY mediocre (and that's me being generous) but the service was ""meh."" Yes, my water was constantly filled. But do you know how many times it took for me to get a SLIDER with no sauce? 3 times. Ordered a slider with no sauce. Slider arrived with sauce. Ordered another. Slider arrived with no sauce but also no pickle, which was clearly something to be included on the slider. Ordered again. Finally slider arrived with no sauce and the pickle on it. Then, randomly ten minutes later, another slider arrived with sauce. Even the waitress was shaking her head at the total ineptness of the kitchen staff. Not to mention the mistakes with table numbering. 

Bottom line, save yourself tears and misery and eat somewhere else. Seriously. You'd be just as happy buying $25  worth of frozen food at Smiths.",t5nkLYfi7spS8uvX-eRLag,3,2,1,PUM-Hm2yYl384Y3v2T4hXg

I prefer the Sangria at Barcelona, the white-red mix is definitely the way to go. The wait staff always have time to check on the food and the experience, a nice addition to service at a neighborhood restaurant. Overall, I've always had great service. The menu and food is comparable to Firefly, in fact I sometimes feel like they ripped off the menu, which isn't a bad thing. My favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, the albondigas, the empanadas,  the chicken skewers, and the stuffed mushrooms are very good! The food quality at Barcelona definitely gives Firefly a run for its money and the wait staff actually come back and chat with you. At a busy Tapas place like Firefly(although it's super fun for a party) you don't get the personal experience. Also they have live music sometimes which is AWESOME! Spanish style guitar, so romantic!

Large Group Dining:
Last year I had my birthday dinner here. The restaurant handled the additional 30 people on a busy Saturday night with calm and provided the best service. Everyone got everything they ordered and in a timely manner. The waiter assigned to our party did a really great job making sure the drinks and food kept coming. We made a reservation a few days in advance just to let them know ahead of time and it truly was a great dinner.",VLzXAE_6GjhAtKGmtVkChg,0,1,5,t8WS8aJ-H5jVOC1PkhpnNg

There were at least five people still dining and drinking, and instead of engaging new customers we were shut down.

We get to Barcelona's and were seated by a hostess. The waiter comes up, brings us water then disappears. He never introduced himself, nor did he show any interest in taking our order. It took about 10 minutes before he came back to take our order. 

The food was great. Everything was cooked perfectly, leaving my girlfriend and i impressed. We asked for the check and gave the waiter the coupon we had bought off one of those group coupon websites. He instantly became hostile claiming that it was more work for him because he had to activate it and deduct it from the final check.  He returned and threw the check in front of me. He never once said thank you, or even came back to check on our drinks. I finished the check and we left.

He followed me into the parking lot and asked for a signature, which I had forgotten to do out of irritation. The gentlemen began to tell me I shouldn't be angry about the coupon situation that it was just more work for him. I had never seen any waiter be so assertive. I told him I was upset about the fact that he didn't check on us once during our meal. He than said, ""I don't need your excuses."" My excuses for what? For not tipping him? He didn't deserve a tip considering how rude he was. He stormed off and called me an a**hole at the door of the restaurant as he was walking in.  After leaving I attempted to call the restaurant for a manager, but the phone kept going to voicemail. This was during business hours by the way.

I'm sorry but that was unacceptable. Not even in the most run down places in town do you have the waiter insult you. Even these waiters are more gracious than this guy.  Horrible service. No matter how good the food was, I will not be returning. 

I will give this place 1 star because of the food. It deserves a zero for the customer service. Get rid of this guy, he's ruining your restaurant.",MDAumb01JkYddQgJJccXXw,1,1,1,sLv5Gsr1oMvoYaBdTjtMHQ

In terms of the ambiance and d√©cor, think of it as Cabo San Lucas, Spain.  They had merengue music playing in the background, if that gives you any indication.  

I could forgive the cultural inauthenticity if the food had been good, but it was not.  I ordered the tortilla de patata (Spanish omelet).  It was so rubbery, I expected to see ""Spalding"" stamped on the underside.  Cooking is about more than hitting buttons on a microwave.      

I guess the owners, who I hear are Salvadoran and Puerto Rican, think all they need to do is put up a couple of pictures of bulls and the FC Barcelona flag, and they have created a Spanish restaurant.

The food is okay, I had the ribs, and guests I was with ordered the sliders. The ribs were served in a sweet sauce that tasted like any that could be found in a Kraft jar. They weren't horrible, and they weren't great. The sliders weren't anything to write home about, as the meat quality was average at best. The fries were quite good, however shouldn't be a determining factor for patrons. 

The determining factors in this case: The service is horrible, and food is average at best. These two facts, coupled together should be a deal-breaker. It is as if they take pride in offering poor service. The wait staff would place the wrong orders in front of the customer, and did not seem to care if people are satisfied. They did this both with the drinks, and later with the entrees. One guest at our table had to wait ten minutes for ketchup, and when we finally got a waiter's attention, he was visibly annoyed at our request. On a side note-the coffee tasted like it had been sitting in the pot all day before being served. 

Strangely enough, if I see reviews for good food and poor service, I'm not deterred, as I see it like a 'soup nazi' situation: The food should be so outstanding that people overlook the horrible customer service in order to experience good tastes. 

In the case of Barcelona Tapas & Bar, I recommend avoiding this place, as the poor service does not justify the lackluster food served and the atmosphere is uncomfortable. 

I think the fancy name 'tapas' makes a place like this appear special, but in my case, it is simply a place to avoid.",9Jw0YHumH6OvTU2On5nSHA,1,0,1,SFe0gstF-FUMm-8Iu2Ko9Q

Given its way-out-of-the-way location, I'd likely have otherwise not heard of it. After a few months of the $25 certificate sitting in our kitchen drawer, my girlfriend and I finally decided to make the trek out to Southern Highlands to check out this tapas joint. 

I was nervous at first; the Yelp! reviews were not encouraging. Everyone was basically saying the service was terrible, the place was too loud, and the food paled in comparison to Firefly (a favorite), especially for the price. But we gave it a go anyway, and ...

I'm glad we did.

We went on a Friday night, which you'd expect to be a super-busy time, but it wasn't. Aside from one big party seated near the bar, the remaining booths were only half-occupied. We were greeted by the server/host immediately upon entering, and seated right away. He got our drink orders in before we even had to open the menus. Throughout our meal, we had servers constantly checking in on us, refilling water, etc. So, for us, the service was super.

The food? Pretty good in general. The patatas bravas were tasty, though could have been a hair spicier. The tortilla espanola was very satisfying, a thick, fluffy omelet that -- I hate to compare -- puts Firefly's to shame. I assume my girl enjoyed her manchego mac & cheese, because she ate it all. Even the toasted bread served with the meal (accompanied by a garbanzo bean dip and garlic cheese butter) was good. 

The only thing that was not awesome was the tuna tartare. While it was inspired to serve it with tostada chips (that almost tasted like wontons!), the tuna was bland, even with accompanying pineapple cubes.

But that's the great thing about tapas -- you try a bunch of things, and some hit, some miss.

The red sangria we had was also very good. Not too sweet, not too strong, a good mix of wine and fruit. Someone else here thought it was too sweet. Maybe they had the white? We'll have to try next time.

I don't know how soon we'll be back based solely on Barcelona's location (although we made it a date night with a movie at Southpoint, which was only about five minutes from there), but we'd definitely recommend anyone in the area try it. And if you go to their website, you can get $25 in dining for only $10. You can get better deals on sites like Restaurant.com, but Barcelona's in-house coupon has fewer restrictions on use.",FZNKwUSXvpv6dMQssaMqwg,6,3,4,J-Pgy5qgqE_Kdh8O6782Eg

(They even have an indicard sticker on the door) I was than told I couldn't use it because I was already getting a deal. On the indicard it says 30% off total tab excluding happy hour. It does not say not on all you can eat. I asked the owner if he would still honor it and he said no because we would be getting two promotions. I told him the only reason we came was because of indicard and it did not say that on there. He straight up said he was not honoring it.

The lamb sausage was soooo good and surprisingly spicy; potatas bravas (sp?) were very nice with a oregano and a hint of mint; pan-fried dates were such a party in my mouth - they were wrapped in bacon & topped with a bit of blue cheese; both the chicken and pork empanadas we cooked beautifully but I have to admit I preferred the pork; sauteed mushrooms were very flavorful and again cooked perfectly; the shrimp skewers had a tasty but not too spicy seasoning; and I wanted to keep slurping the steamed mussels broth!  We finished everything off with bananas foster and I was again very pleased with the balance of flavors.

I was very impressed with the quality of the food, especially considering they were literally packed wall-to-wall with futbal fans (go Spain!).  Service was very good - I don't how they kept up!

So, I ended up at Barcelona. Let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised with the food, service and ""drank."" Let's break this down into categories. 

Food:
Pan Fried Dates - Excellent and highly recommended. For those that have been to Firefly's, they are essentially the same. Bacon wrapped dates, with Blue Cheese. 

Sliders - Sliders come as 2 mini burgers and are just fine. Of course, I always say you can't ruin a burger that much when they are so simple. 

Abodingos (sp?) AKA Meatballs - Tasty little guys come in a marinara like sauce with lots of cheese. 

Empanadas - There are two types to choose from. I had the chicken, but the alternative is Pork. Chicken was chosen because my friend doesn't eat pork. However, the chicken empanadas were excellent.

Fruit Parfait - The parfait was sweet and tasty. Raspberry, Strawberry and blueberries, with whip cream and a sweet yogurt like mixture. 

Sangria - Thursday night is 1/2 off Sangria night. This means it's $3 per glass. Not too shabby and a good sized glass too. 

Atmosphere:
I have mixed feelings on the atmosphere. Walls were great, but the tables were a bit small for me and I am only 6'2"". My knees hit the top of the tables. However, there were booths that looked like they had more room. It was a Lakers game night so it was rowdy because we were the only Lakers fans in the place. Every else was for Boston. :-( 

Service:
Food was fast, and service was excellent. It was more personal then most places. Waiter recommended, talked about the game, chit chatted and more.

The mac & cheese is better than the one served at Firefly in my opinion and the butternut squash soup was tasty as well.  We ended the meal with the bananas foster dessert and it was A-MAZING.  I'm not even usually a ""banana dessert"" person, but this was awesome.  The service was great, but we were one of the only groups in the restaurant that night.

The second time I went was on a Saturday night.  It was much more crowded, which was good to see since I wasn't very sure how this place stayed in business based on the volume I saw the first time. Again, I had the pan fried dates and mac & cheese, which were still delicious.  I also tried the sliders and was very satisfied.

(Seriously, what's up with such shitty service in this alleged service-oriented town?) That's great. Perhaps find a better way to greet and treat all your guests.

The food I've tried on multiple occasions has been really good. This visit, I would have ordered more if anyone had bothered to check on me. (The brunch selections are more straight outta Waffle House, and the bloody Mary, while nice and spicy, is the size of a Dixie cup.)

Other: The ""hummus"" is gross... Like pureed northern beans. Too bad sports are blaring from the multiple TVs...ruins the ambiance, no way to escape them. It would also be nice to spruce up your patio with flower boxes instead of ugly banners and signs. I wish there was a more affordable, perhaps half order, of ceviche. And I know this part of town is the end of the universe, but a tapas place that closes at 11? In Barcelona, they wouldn't even think of starting dinner until about then!

1930338,2011-06-07,1,_kdpjoGrIzA64E6aXHA66w,"I'm a huge fan of Tapas,  my wife and I like Firefly a lot so when I got the opportunity to buy a deal on living social for $25 for $50 worth of food, it was a no brainer decision to give it a try.

I hate to be overly critical when I'm getting a discount but here goes anyway :)

The decor was nice, the restaurant has a nice ambiance and overall casual but comfortable feeling.  All of the booths in the restaurant section were full, so my wife and I grabbed a booth like table in the bar as noone was there and it seemed the best choice at the time. It turns out we should have picked a different table as my seat looked right into the kitchen, boxes of soda, the co2 tanks, some dude sitting on a box on his break.  The opening to the kitchen does have some black curtains but they weren't using them and had them tucked back presumably because it was annoying for the workers to walk thru them.  I'm guessing the decorator or owner put those curtains there for a reason, would be nice to see them used.

The menu prices and drinks are all reasonably priced, so no complaints there. They have lots of coupons available including a discount on Yelp, as well as a 3 hour happy hour with most dishes 50% off so if you time it right you get a big bang for you buck.

I ordered the Grilled Octupus and Shrimp Ceviche to get started with while we looked at the rest of the menu for other stuff.   5 minutes later, the Waitress returns with a ""I'm sorry we don't have any Grilled Octopus or the Shrimp Ceviche tonight"". I'm mildly irritated at this point as:

a.) these are two of my favorite items
b.) I hate it when waitresses don't tell you what they are out of when you sit down.

ok, granted they may be out of Octopus because it is not fresh, etc but they do have plenty of other shrimp dishes on the menu so regarding the shrimp ceviche I think it was more of poor planning or lack of desire to make more.

I asked if there were any more items that they didn't have, and the waitress scampered off to the kitchen again to ask (is it really that hard to know what items you aren't serving tonight???) She mentioned two other items they didn't have one of which was another dish I was interested in, big sigh :(

The food was quite good. My only real complaint was the lack of product knowledge from the waitress. We asked a couple of basic questions like what kind of cheese is on this? etc only to get a blank stare with her picking up the menu to look :)

It's also milldy irritating when they just drop off the food without a brief explanation.  This is XXX, this is YYY.  My wife and I had ordered escargot and they just dumped it off, we thought it was another dish we had ordered because the escargot was prepared in a method we weren't used to (it was good, but would have been nice to know we were eating it :) )

Waitress made two more mistakes regarding the check.  a.) didn't deduct the value of the coupon even though I gave it to her when we sat down, when she adjusted the bill, she gave me the wrong change and I had to point out her mistake to her. Not the end of the world, but I enjoy my evenings out without having to go through small hassles.

Overall, I would give the food a solid 3.5 stars, and the service about a 2.  

I will give this restaurant another try when I'm in the area. Hopefully, they won't be out of the items I want and we will get a better waitress. I will update my rating if I have a better experience next time.

The only thing I would add to the reviews is to consider the sauce that some of the dishes might be in.  You may want to ask for ""light sauce"" since some dishes (i.e. mushrooms) tend to be soaked in it.  I usually ask and they comply.

As for the service, it is usually pretty good. I don't know if they have had some turnover recently, but I notice some new faces working there.  But the owner/manager is a really nice guy and does a great job making tasy dishes.

I'd like to point out they have some awesome deals - 4-7pm everyday I believe the tapas at 1/2 off.  At 7pm, it flips and drinks become 1/2 off.  The 1/2 off times definitely make this place a much better deal.  I wouldn't miss it if you live in the South/Southwest Vegas area!",uE5iOwBCZk3-AByMdb8C8g,0,0,4,jlNIdooPXppimD4jXBJT5g

2029931,2011-05-05,3,_kdpjoGrIzA64E6aXHA66w,"This is one of those reviews that I've had a very hard time writing about because I don't think anything I say will do justice to how much of a good time I had here. 

We showed up for happy hour half off drink and food specials and were seated right away. We must have come at a good time because we really didn't wait long for anything. However, I would say that a great deal of credit should also be given to our server, Marco. He was funny, engaging, and (most importantly) very attentive! 

First, and most importantly: the drinks were deceiving delicious in the sense that they were so tasty that I inhaled three glasses without hesitation only to find that I was pretty ridiculously drunk. The red sangria (arguably the only true sangria) was refreshing and light without being overly sweet or disrespectful to the essence of sangria. We had two pitchers. We also had a pitcher of mojito, which was just as refreshing and tasty (though I favored the sangria). For kicks, I tried a glass of white sangria to Marco's and my husband's chagrin, and while it was delicious, it was nowhere near as awesome as the red (which I refused to admit until now). 

Second most importantly: the food. Delicious. I read a few reviews prior to visiting and was worried about the menu until I realized that the issues were mostly with the marinara sauce dishes and I had no interest in them to begin with. Worries gone! 

Anyway, the food was fantastic. We actually viewed the menu ahead of time and wrote out a list of the items we wanted to eat (for a group of 5). After the first round, we narrowed down to those we wanted seconds of and, voila, we were full and drunk! 

We had:

- Bread Course (complimentary): I think we had a cannelini and honey almond spread. Both were such a great start, but that butter was lardy crack, I swear! I wanted to spread it on everything and make the world a happier place with it. 

- Calamari: Good portion and tasty sauce. I'm partial to the battered calamari over the breaded variety so I was a happy camper. 

- Tortilla Espanola: I know it's just egg and potato, but it's really easy to eff this up. I think it was cooked perfectly (and it got ""pretty close"" remarks from my husband, the guy who thinks all tapas places not in Spain can't get it right).

- Chicken and Mushroom Soup: Not my call. Soup with sangria? What kind of nut orders that? My sister, that's who. But the soup was good!

- Bacon-Wrapped Dates: Standard fare done well here. We got seconds. 

- Manchego Mac and Cheese: I swoon for cheesy goodness and everyone gobbled theirs up, but I couldn't get seconds because everyone else does not have the same dairy love that I do. 

- Patatas Bravas: Okay, you know how when you eat out and something's supposed to be spicy but, usually, it really isn't? That is not the case. I love heat, but even I caught myself saying, ""WOO!"" and gulping down sangria. We for sure got seconds!

- Escargot: The sauce, the snails, the veggies... they were soppingly good. The toasted bread was the perfect accompaniment and we all found ourselves wiping the plate clean so as to not waste that delectable sauce. Seconds? Yes!

- Beef Carpaccio: It was dressed so well with the fried onions, balsamic sauce, and cheese. Hell yeah we got seconds! 

- Garlic Shrimp: We got seconds, first, because it only comes in a set of three and we had five people. Secondly, garlic butter sauce, man! 

- Petit Filet: It was like a mini meal of perfectly cooked steak and mashed potatoes. We got seconds. 

- Chocolate Tres Leches: I WANTED to get seconds! 

- Bananas Foster: Thank you, Marco, for this treat! What a satisfying end to such a fulfilling meal! 

All this fun and gorging came out to about $40-$50 a person with tax and tip thanks to the magic that is Happy Hour. 

The only downside is that, for a non-local who comes in from LA, it's a trek to get out here, but sometimes one should venture away from the main haunts. Can't wait to resume the madness!",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,6,4,5,9PQeUzUgO6Z5g5RU2xyIjg

When we arrived, there was exactly one host / bartender / server - and he may have even been doing some cooking too. So needless to say, service was incredibly slow (despite there only being two other tables of people). And to make it worse, he reminded me of a used car salesman - extremely pushy about getting you to order certain dishes. The table next to us was a mom and young daughter. The mom declined dessert, but the server then proceeded to tell the little girl about the bananas foster crepes and that she must want those. It was all very uncomfortable. (And the same thing happened to us with the one special of the day that he described to us.)

The good thing here is the happy hour deals. When we went, all mojitos were 1/2 half and all seafood and meat tapas were 1/2 off. And that is a great deal. Unfortunately, the mojitos and tapas were downright awful.

We had a mango mojito and blood orange mojito. Neither of us could even stand to drink them. They were very obviously made with a powder mix - and you could see and taste the powder. Ick, icky, ick.

We ordered a a variety of tapas - the special of the day (red peppers with capers and feta), mac 'n' cheese with bacon, tortilla a la espanola, fried dates, etc. We were both incredibly hungry, but we didn't finish any of the dishes. Not only were they disappointing, they were just plain bad.

The mac 'n' cheese was dried out, had little to no flavor, and practically no bacon. The tortilla espanola was very dried out and way overcooked. These are two tapas that are standard favs of mine at any tapas place, but complete failures here.

Though  we found the answer to having our tapas without consuming a half tank of gas when we heard about Barcelong.  We went there for the first time this past Friday night.  We had 7pm reservations and were seated 5 minutes early.  Off to a good start.  The atmosphere is what I call ""rustic, trendy"".  Great backgound music.  Very upbeat.  Our waiter approached the table and that's where everything went downhill.  He didn't welcome us to the restaurant and didn't introduce himself.  Just asked us what we wanted to drink.  The drinks came quickly, delivered by another member of the wait staff.  It took 20 minutes before our waiter came to take our order.  The restaurant is not very large.  He passed by our table several times and could see, by our closed menus, we were ready to order.  I was starting to take it personally until I saw a man, seated at the table behind us, standing up with his hands on his waist staring in our waiter's direction.  Maybe he had been waiting longer than us.  We finally got to order and the food arrive quickly, again delivered by another member of the wait staff.  The food was awesome!!!  While we were eating, a group seated in another table next to us got into a bit of heated discussion with the same waiter.  They had been sitting for quite awhile without drink orders, let alone food, and wanted to move to the bar.  I couldn't hear all that was said, but I did see the waiter ""dismiss"" them with a wave of his arm.  More was said, then he ended up taking their drink orders.  It took more time to get a second round of drinks.  (By the way, the sangria was great!!)  He never asked if we wanted dessert.  I wanted to order dessert, but by that time, my fiance was so upset he wanted to get out of there.  We asked for our check.  The waiter brought the check and tossed the check across the table.  He walked away without saying another word.  We are pretty patient diners and have eaten at some of the finest restaurants Las Vegas has to offer.  There were no negative exchanges between us and our waiter.  We smiled the entire time.    I'm not too sure if he was having a bad night or whatever, but it wasn't only us that were far from pleased with the service.  The waiter was flat out rude and indifferent.  Our service at Barcelona was the worst I have ever experienced in this city.  It upsets me, because the food was awesome.  The bus staff, the hostess were great.  Without them, we would have received no service at all.  I would love to go back, but not sure if I want to take a chance getting treated like that again.

Then when we placed that order our server said it was better for all of us to order all you can eat because it would be easier on him.. my parents had weight-loss surgery so all you can eat is a waste for them. We started to place our orders and once again he stated it was easier for him to do 5 orders off of the all you can eat menu for my sister and I to start. We were trying to tell him what we wanted but he was constantly assuming what we were going to order and just trying to move very fast. He went down the table for the rest of the orders. Food started to come out and he didn't remember who ordered what so it was a shouting game. Several items that myself and my family ordered never showed. Then when I went to do my 2nd order for All you can eat is when I really started to get frustrated. I wanted to order the bruschetta but not cheese, he then tells me that's no good, and I said well I don't like cheese so that's how I would like it ordered. I then ask what comes on Barcelona fries, he stated ""it is the same thing as Burger King"" I was very shocked by that comment because once again, I'm paying $26.00 per person for what I would hope to be better quality food than Burger King. I placed my order and we were still missing items other family members had ordered. When he brought out the bruschetta, there was no bread... I asked for bread and he said you don't get that... completely annoyed at this point I see a man walking around that looks like a manager. I explained to him my frustration and all of the missing items. They did their best to get them to us fast however, everyone was over it at that point. He took of 1 item from our bill as a courtesy. Our bill still came to over $200.00 and they added an automatic 20% gratuity which after the service I received, I didn't feel I wanted to pay (but still did).

2319136,2016-08-27,0,_kdpjoGrIzA64E6aXHA66w,"We've been coming here off and on since they opened several years ago. The food quality isn't as good as at first, but average. They have changed the menu up several times, I feel it has been when business is probably slowing. Some options are definitely not what you would find in a traditional tapas place in Spain. Though they seem to try and give the impression with decor, and name, that it would be. 
We came in the other night for the first time in a couple of months, maybe 6 or so. There was a wedding going on, and we should have know this would effect the service in the small place. I personally think it's awesome that a couple wanted to have their renewal ceremony here, but I feel bad how it was handled. Their group was completely crowded in the space provided. When the couple was saying their vows the music kept bumping and other customers literally were irritated with where they were standing and pushing past the couple in the middle of their vows. They were so close to our table my husband could have easily reached over to also hold hands with the happy couple. 
The food was sooooo slow. It trickled in, with no real rhyme or reason. My son and I ordered  several rounds of tapas, and received them, and my husband was still waiting for most of his first order. The service was so slow we eventually just asked for whatever food was ready to just be boxed up to go. It took a while to get a refill on water. They failed to ask how anything was when food actually arrived. The gentleman that sat us at our rable, and brought a foos item or two, was sitting at another table most of the time visiting with some other people. I would think with being so busy it'd be all hands on deck, the entire time.
The positives - there are two, and they are both staff. The young man that was doubling as bus boy and server was hustling the entire time. He was literally running when he was away from the tables to get to the kitchen to keep the food coming to people. No one else was on the floor was working half as hard. We didn't get a chance to speak with him because he was just moving non-stop. I'm tempted to go back and see if he'd want to come work for me with that sense of urgency and hard work. Then the young female waitress that has worked there for years. She is always so nice, and was very apologetic to how slow service was. We've watched her there for years quietly keeping the peace with customers. Like reseating a couple that was in the table the wedding couple was literally pressed against during their vows.
I think if you are going to host this large of a party, then make it a private event, close to the public, and do it right. We were left disappointed and tired after 2 hours of having kids from the wedding group running around our table, and not even getting all our food.",1GbtKqRpDAfv13fUYIBBmA,0,0,3,TP1WrzCnEGzRBdG2yetqQg

2432450,2010-03-26,8,_kdpjoGrIzA64E6aXHA66w,"I was looking forward to trying this place since I read about it in the 89148 Magazine back in February.  I love tapas and the menu looked so promising...carpaccio with truffle oil, grilled octopus with a red wine reduction, and chorizo clams in a white wine broth.  My mouth waters just thinking about these dishes and many more on Barcelona's menu, but I'm sad to report that this was one of the most disappointing restaurants I've ever been to!

It just so happens that I recently acquired a coupon to this restaurant and went to it last Friday.  I just want to make it clear that I would have happily tried this place at full price, and the dish I was looking most forward to trying was the carpaccio (you just can't go wrong with raw beef and truffle oil...I'd hope).  My boyfriend and I were seated and greeted promptly.  When the server came over to take our drink order, he looked down at my coupon, took it and went straight to the kitchen.  Being a server for a long time, I could tell he was not happy that we brought this coupon, but I tried to remedy the situation by being extremely nice.  We ordered the carpaccio, pan fried dates, steamed clams, diabla shrimp, grilled octopus, saut√©ed tilapia, albondigas, and merguez.  After a short while the tapas started coming out, and after delivering the first wave, our server said, ""I'm sorry, but the carpaccio is very popular and we are running out of it tonight.""  I smiled and said disappointed, ""oh really?"" and he responded, ""yes.""  Both my boyfriend and I picked up on his wording, but we did not confront him about it.  It is my strong belief that they had enough carpaccio for AT LEAST another order, but they didn't want to waste it on a table with a coupon!  As the night progressed our server grew increasingly more impatient and annoyed with our presence.  When we got our check he had manually written in an 18% tip...on a table for 2, and I always automatically tip 20% (even when the service is bad)!  With a coupon or something comped, I usually tip much more because that's what fellow service industry workers do...(can you tell how livid I am?)  Unfortunately, I wish I could say that only the service was sub par, but the food ranged from ok to not even edible.

Pan Fried Dates- This was the best dish we had from Barcelona.  The bacon was cooked well, all of the textures were spot on, and they had a nice savory sweet taste.  However, the red wine reduction was way too thin, the blue cheese crumbles were on the stingy side, and Firefly's are much better.

Steamed Clams- The clams were cooked well, but the chorizo was very dry.  The broth also needed more seasoning (this is a common theme).

Diabla Shrimp- I liked this, but again, it was not as good as Firefly's.  A nice spicy sweet sauce with shrimp, but the sauce was a little too thin.

Grilled Octopus- This just lacked seasoning.  The octopus was a pretty good texture, not too chewy, but the flavor was bland.  For good grilled octopus, try Olives in the Bellagio.

Sauteed Tilapia- Completely inedible!  I'm not sure if the kitchen just didn't care or if they genuinely made a mistake, but the outside of the fish was mushy and the inside was raw.  I've never seen fish this texture before, and I honestly can't think of how it happened.

Albondigas- Meatballs in marinara with melted mozzarella on top.  These were so dry we drenched each bite in the marinara.

Merguez- A spicy lamb sausage served over roasted red pepper couscous.  The sausage was dry and not very spicy.  The couscous was a little wet, but it had a good flavor.

The one good thing about our experience was that the man refilling our drinks was extremely friendly!  He never let a drink go empty and explained they have live music some nights.  I really wish the food had been better so I could give this place a second chance.",73aLiVtZIMsiKosTKL4f0g,13,9,1,3qiDM7smKIF1Ya4-05kvtg

We started out with one waiter who took our order and completely disappeared. Eventually another waiter took over and he was a sweetheart. Very attentive and called us ""my friends"" every chance he got.

I had a white wine sangria which was pretty low on alcohol. I had 2 of them and didn't even have a buzz.

In regards to food, everything was just so-so. The stuffed dates were delcious, as was the complimentary bread with hummus and mystery spread. What IS that stuff? Whatever it was, it was addictive.

Albondigas were okay, but they were served with a marinara sauce which I've never seen in a Spanish restaurant or on this type of dish. The chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms were served the same way. They had a mealy texture, as I believe the meat was finely ground or shredded. Weird.

The fried goat cheese was WAY too rich. It could have used more honey or balsamic to offset the cheese.

Macaroni and cheese was bland and unimpressive.

I'd highly recommend the surf and turf platter with shrimp, chorizo and steak. It was served with some amazing mashed potatoes and covered in a chimichurri that was delicious.

My friend and I arrived in Vegas quite late and decided to have dinner somewhere close to our off-strip hotel. We had looked up another restaurant in this strip mall but when we arrived, we decided that Barcelona looked more our style. Ok fine! I was sucked in by the ""All you can eat tapas"" sign!

At first I found the menu somewhat overwhelming. It is big and highly varied. Luckily margaritas were on special so one decision was easy. My friend and I ended up sharing a number of items off the vegetarian section: veggie empanadas, the Barcelona salad, raviolis, and these adorable parmesan nests that were on special. We also finished our meal with a piece of chocolate cake. Everything was waaaay better than expected. I wish I remembered what the parmesan nests were called because they were unreal.

The portions were pretty generous so this was more than enough for us since we weren't particularly hungry. Personally I don't think I'd bother with the all you can eat option unless it's on special. The prices were already pretty reasonable.

Overall I was very pleased with my visit to Barcelona. The had live music which was a lovely touch and fantastic service. This is the perfect place if you want something more casual with great food. It also seemed like a nice place for families without feeling like a ""family restaurant"".

My favorites here are the dates of course (Firefly ones are still better but it's a good substitute if you're craving), the albondingas and the empanadas. They do have a full bar with gaming, which is a nice surprise, and the sangria is decent.

First they start you off with complimentary bread and butter. Yum! Though it didn't compare to Firefly, that didn't hold me back.

We ordered :
Pan fried dates, I didn't enjoy these better than Firefly but they were nonetheless still very good. We knew we'd order more of these babies.

Garlic shrimp, very tasty. The sauce had a lot of flavor, I love garlic, so this was an easy like. It only came with three skewers and with so much goodiness in that dish, we had to help ourselves to seconds.. even thirds!

Beef carpaccio, it was my first time trying it and I was not disappointed! The sauce was so flavorful and the crispy onions were a great touch! I just wished I was served this first so I could have had room for seconds.

Beef sliders, I'm not a big fan of burgers but from what my brother said, it was bomb . com. And I loved how they served him ketchup in almost like Aladdin's genie lamp. So cute. Their thin fries were pretty good also, it had a nice crunch to it.

Manchego mac&cheese, definitely enjoyed this one a lot better than Firefly's, the taste was spot on. My boyfriend even enjoyed it, so big thumbs up for BT&B!

Paella, it was okay, I just didn't like having big, uncut lumps of chicken in there. They definitely weren't bite size but the flavors were there, rice was just a bit undercooked.

It's a lot more brighter and roomier than Firefly, that was a plus for me. Because I love being able to tell what the color of my food really looks like.

I was alone, and waiting for my husband to come join me after work, so I sat at a small table in the bar area. First of all, I ordered a glass of wine. Now, at this point, they usually bring you bread with honey butter and some other delicious spread first. This time they did not. They brought me my first tapas entree before I ever got any bread...and I had to ASK for the bread. I don't like the AYCE menu as well as I like the a LA carte menu, so that's what I ordered from. I have always loved the lamb chops in the past. Last night, the lamb chops were pretty good,  but there was no feta cheese at all in the accompanying couscous, so it did not have as good a flavor as it usually does. It's just not the same without the feta. I also ordered the mussels, which I remembered before as being really large and swimming in a delicious broth. This time they were much smaller and very dried out. There was barely a smidgeon of dried up sauce in the middle of each one, so they didn't have much flavor either. No broth at all. They were just placed on a plate around a small pile of lettuce with a very bland dressing on it...not at all the tasty dish I remembered from before! This place must be under new management or new ownership, I'm guessing, because nothing was as tastey as it was on previous visits! I decided to try something new, so I ordered Carne asada which was decent, but not good enough to make up for the rest of the disappointing experience. Overall, just very bland and boring flavors.

3087759,2017-06-10,0,_kdpjoGrIzA64E6aXHA66w,"I've been to Barcelona a few times, and it's always a pleasant experience. Most recently I went with my boyfriend and mom on a Friday night and was surprised at how busy it was. They offered us a table between two large parties but noted it would probably be cramped. Another server rushed to make a table by the bar that worked out perfectly. There was live music playing from the corner but from where we were sitting it wasn't too loud to talk to each other. 

I think it's brilliant that they have an all you can eat menu. However, it's pretty hard to eat $25 worth of tapas per person. We ordered the tomato bruschetta, patatas bravas, mac and cheese, pork empanadas, croquettes, al pastor tacos, and dates, as well as two martinis and four beers and it came out to $100. All you can eat would have been $75 off the bat and I think with drinks and tax it would have been more than $100. If you want to relax and share plates and not get too full I don't see a reason to do the AYCE. Lunch prices do seem more justifiable though.

My favorite of the dishes we ordered was the patatas bravas and tacos al pastor. The patatas bravas were smaller pieces than I've had before, allowing each bit to be crispy. It also wasn't smothered in cheese which was nice, and it had a great saltiness to it. The tacos al pastor meat was similarly cut up small and super crispy. I did taste a few bits of pineapple but could have used a little more. Surprisingly my least favorite was the mac and cheese. It had a smoky flavor to it and the side of bacon looked and tasted like bacon bits. The tomato bruschetta and empanadas were solid choices, not necessarily mind blowing. The dates are a must always. 

The service was wonderful here. It feels like a family environment and I'm glad to see that it was so full the night we went in. Even though it's further from my house I'd have to say I prefer Barcelona to Firefly. I definitely want to check out the lunch AYCE sometime soon.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,1,1,4,nC5iqnh2YBrbZaxZF3PGNw

I learned about pan fried dates a couple years ago at the aforementioned competitor, and in my opinion they are just as good or probably better at Barcelona.

I have mixed emotions about tapas, just because I've been programmed from a young age to appreciate large portions and having small plates with small portions (though plentiful) messes with my head :)  I also think I end up spending more that way...but I think that speaks more to my issues than to Barcelona.

First off, I've passed this place a million times and never eaten here.  It's conveniently located and easy to find in the Smith's shopping center.  It's much bigger inside than I imagined!  I mean, it's a modest size, but I pictured it much smaller.  We went in the late afternoon on a Saturday and it wasn't too busy.  We were seated and proceeded to order off the Happy Hour menu (half off).  Also, by checking in on Yelp, you get a free drink!  Awesome!

My friend and I ordered about 7 happy hour tapas...mac n cheese, escargot, some kind of chicken dish, eggplant dish, mushroom dish...and a few other things I can't remember.  Everything was REALLY good!  Drinkwise, we went with the sangria and mojitos.  I think I enjoyed the mojito more, but both were pretty good.

All in all, I don't have any complaints.  Our server was so nice and very attentive.  This place had a very comfortable and homey feel to it.  Everything seemed clean and in its place.  I do have to reinforce...tapas DO add up, especially the way my friend and I eat, so I probably would not come at any other time slot besides happy hour which is 4-7p Sun-Thurs and 4-6p Fri-Sat.",DRuhRt_8umGK9o603tV5vw,3,1,4,m4Wb2fSGgZM8GNTOKEWkCQ

Pan Fried Dates - amazing texture and flavor combination. Best damn dates ever. I ordered this twice in one visit.

Grilled Artichokes - very tender. Excellent flavor.

Stuffed Mushrooms - has a great kick. Delicious.

Garlic Shrimp - very flavorful. The garlic was generous but not overpowering. The shrimp was perfectly done and tender.

Steak Skewers - the only thing I didn't like. There was something about the flavor of the meat itself - gamey almost. Perfectly cooked, however. My mum devoured these.

Bananas Foster Crepes - delicious and tastes homemade. My mum makes killer bananas foster at home, and this lived up to our lofty expectations.

White Sangria - light, refreshing, and super delicious. I'm really glad we didn't order the pitcher. As a super lightweight, that would not have ended well.

Pan fried dates- pretty much a staple of any Barcelona visit
Beef carpaccio- the fried scallions and balsamic reduction make this one a winner 
Pork empenadas- kinda heavy for me but I don't think I was really in the mood for fried food
BBQ ribs- I was impressed. The sauce was flavorful but not overpowering, the pineapple chunks went well with the sauce and the meat practically fell off the bone. Will definitely order that again.
Spicy shrimp- this was one of my favorite new finds on the menu. The sauce was sweet and hot (think Thai chili sauce), the shrimp was succulent and it went great with bread (huge plus in my book).

Not too vegan friendly due to the excessive cheese factor in the menu. The decor reminded me of country bars/sandwich places in Texas so I didn't really get the Spanish vibe. I thought the prices were a little high ($5.50 to $6) for most tapas vegetarian items...rather small portions. 

The items I sampled:

1. Fried Goat Cheese ($6.50) - 4 panko crusted goat cheese balls deep fried and drizzled with honey balsamic. These balls tasted excellent. But I thought $6.50 for a small bite was a little outrageous

2. Potatoes Bravas ($6) - Tasted pretty bad. I don't know how to describe it except that it was a serious letdown. $6 for a small portion of baked potatoes? I don't think so....

3. Raviolis ($5.50) - Cheese medallion raviolis in a creamy tomato sauce. The sauce was excellent. But the raviolis (4 in an order) were undercooked

4. Vegetable Empanada ($5) - 2 empanadas with a bean, corn, mushroom filling served with more beans and corn and a tomato based sauce. The pastry was flaky, the filling tasty and the entire combination a rousing success!

5. Stuffed Piquillo Peppers ($7.50) - 3 peppers with goat cheese and beans and corns served in a tomato sauce. Tasty but definitely overpriced.

We had  pitchers of Mojitos that I felt were way too sweet. 

We were there as a group of 12 for a birthday. Edgar, the owner was very accommodating and helped us with the table arrangements as well as the cake cutting. The rest of the wait staff...oh gosh. It was a travesty. Water glasses were never filled, our orders were totally ignored for the longest time, drink orders were messed up, we got pork Empanadas to the table twice even though we explicitly told the waitstaff we were vegetarian multiple times and had ordered vegetable Empanadas. Just dismal service. They did make accomodations on the check and acknowledged the awful service but I'd rather have had water to drink with my meal than pay a few dollars less.

- Sliders.  These were overcooked and charred.  I would've complained but I'm not one to ever send a dish back.

Alex took very good care of as well as all the servers who kept the delicious dishes coming. The bacon wrapped dates are always a must. There were two new choices I tried and loved! Get the Sliders and the saut√©ed mushrooms. You won't be disappointed. The hummus is one of my favorites. It has a great heat and texture. When Alex found out we were celebrating my birthday he brought our table Bananas Foster and flan! Both are delicious. We will be back again and again.

THE MAIN REASON I'M GIVING THIS PLACE 2 STARS IS BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE.
I fully understand that a place is understaffed and has 1 waiter for the whole place but, our waiter -- UGHH!!!!!!

First, we order a pitcher of mojitos and he brings me a glass.

Worst was that my friend FOUND HAIR IN HIS RICE and told the waiter about it and he just laughed it off. 
Are you effing kidding me???!!
You know very well, if it was in my friend's rice then, there HAD to be hair in someone else's rice dish.

Sadly, the food we had was really yummy. Escargot, brie dates bacon, lamb, mojito. I would've gave this place 4 stars.
 
I'm just thankful his rice dish was the last thing we ate or else I would've been inspecting my food like crazy throughout dinner.",uERlyO-ASZag6XXouCrkhg,8,2,2,kshlkPnPqO4umWuKUE9bZA

On Mondays, it is all you can eat tapas. And then Tuesday through Thursday starting at 6 PM it is all you can eat. 

My favorite thing on the menu are the fried goat cheese balls. They also bring out complimentary bread with hummus and brown honey butter and the honey butter is amazing!!

The restaurant is also a bar so I can even get my alcohol fix at the same time if I feel the sangria isn't cutting it.

Here are my favorite plates there:
The FREE bread they serve at the beginning: it's warm and toasted when it comes out, and the orange butter (not sure of the flavor) is super yummy.  I think I can come here and eat just the bread and I'll be content
Pan Fried Dates: this is a salty/sweet delight and is definitely a must try for any Tapas first timers
Mac n Cheese: it has fun shells! And just the right amount of cheese.  This is a good carb to eat with all the small plates!
Mar y Monte (Surf n Turf): my favorite part about this dish is actually the sausage and the mash potatoes.  Also, the meat is cooked medium so its tasteful
Diabla Shrimp: good and spicy too!
Ham and Cheese Croquets: yum!
Sliders: These are super good and not really a small plate!

The so-so:
Empanadas: I've only tried once; thought it was OK
Egg-plant Cannelloni: The egg plant is yum, but the rest of it is too salty
Sangria: it does the job, but the fruit could be marinated in there; so they make it a little different here.  But I'll still order it for sure!

We were literally about to get up and walk out as we were so frustrated on the principle of the fact not really the $7 just the principle.

Then we noticed in the window a huge sign that says all day Monday all you can eat 1899 so we decide to stay order and don't mention anything until we're done he brings us the bill it's $26 per person I walk him outside show him the large sign in the window and tell him buddy change the price because we're not paying $26.

I was not impressed!
The only thing good about this place was our server. A very tall and handsome guy with a lot of enthusiasm!  I believe he may of been the owner.
When we walked in the ambiance of the place was just 'Meh' and it took a few moments before anyone even acknowledged that we were even there. 
Our table was at one of the bar 'booths' which was uncomfortable and the table was so short that we couldn't even cross our legs.  We had to sit next to each other, not across from each other, because one side of the booth was a booth like seat and the other side of the table were these short little bar type stools with no backs.  Very uncomfortable!
The food was OK, not wonderful, but just OK. Although I must say that the
 Pan Fried Dates................................$ 5.50 
(Pitted dates stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon with merlot reduction and sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles.) were VERY yummy!!  But everything else, I'm sorry to say, was just not very good.

I will start at the beginning..how this went down..I am writing,this because I am shocked at just how..well unbusiness like my lunch stop went..I pull up..get out look at menu by door..cool I thought have done a Tapas Bar 1 time..figured let me try it.
Walk in..waiter comes over to seat me.  (This is 1 something in the afternoon midweek..see my pic no one was there.) He leads me to a table..I ask for a booth..me bad I guess..I saw 3 open booths and no one waiting..and he is not pleased about it..I could tell..

I look it over...compare

I was in a good mood everything good..Waiter answer..
""Oh no..the kitchen is so busy right now""
....What?
Ok..but how do I order? Get a few items? Then try more?
What I surmised from his answer was. .you get one of each but not all together..or something like that..
Confusing... .again I hear..""we are really busy"".
1 more time I say..""ok""..dumbfounded I am hearing this..
So I say again I am not sure how to order and AGAIN
with a look of panic or angry or just.well I don't  know.. he says.""We are so busy""..""the kitchen""...and leaves ...just weird. 
He returned and I ask him is it better for me to just order an item from the menu? vs the Tapas Lunch? he looked befuddled..and by this time I can tell with the pissed look ...he really just does not care...almost became a silent stand off..
So I say...well you know what you appear to be too busy for me to be here..I guess I will just leave and go somewhere else..he shrugs and says..""oh ya..ya..maybe better"" with his accent.
.LOL....how much for my drink..? 5 bucks he says..I say ok then he brings a bill for 9.99..Whatever..I leave 10 dollars and walk to the exit door.
As I leave I glance over the empty restaurant into the bar...wow
2 customers on the end of the bar sitting by the front window.
..that was it for the bar...listening to the female bartender and the waiter that was too busy? He was,there too.. with his back to me doing nothing..talking...
So I say..to them (yes I was that person) as I look over at them..
Excuse me? You are too busy?  Obviously you are too busy for my money too.  Have a great day..
Wow..just wow
I am posting this so the owner is aware ..just dumbfounded at zero customer service and rudeness.  So sad..It was truly a cute place but the employees made it ugly
Ended up walking down further down the strip mall and going to a coffee shop with great service!
I truly am sad..it ticked a lot of things I like... had a bar..Cool Vibe..Close to Home..sports on the TVs..
..I love to support neighborhood businesses..
Very dissapointing..and sad because I really hoped to like it.

The general atmosphere was very Spanish, I loved the server and I even loved the fact that they offered a free sangria upon check-in. However, their food was a little bland in general, and the portion for their appetizers were a joke. I understand they are tapas, but I could barely taste the main ingredients since they were sliced too thinly or cut into tiny little pieces. 

The paella was served in a huge portion, but again, it just tasted like homemade. 

However, the pros about this restaurant is that it priced at a more reasonable margin that any other spanish tapa places in Vegas. Also their service is really good as well as their sangrias. This, though, is a really far drive from my house, so I am not sure when I will go back the next time, but definitely willing to come back",s01liMq8lG4G3f3AvJMi5w,2,0,4,3kHEO_V_2r5gOF5TcYuXTw

But the waiters were very enthusiastic and of course wanted our business so they even offered that we can bring in a bottle of wine and drink it with our foods.  
We were already kinda tipsy so we just opt for the food.  It tasted good then but almost anything is good after ""drinking"".

The second time I was here I was with someone who did not eat certain foods and I was kinda full to begin with.  So we shared the EMPANADA.  From what I could remembert...it was not memorable.

This time...I wanted to give it one more shot.  I brought my son with me this time hoping he would like it and he would be able to give me honest  ""TASTE BUDS OPINIONS""

We got there before dinner rush and there was only one couple in the whole place.  The host/waiter dude was in the back.  Maybe he did not hear us but maybe there should be a bell or something to let him know there are customers.  I had to go towards the back to find him and ask if we should sit ourselves.  

We chose a booth which the bench was lower than the table.  (just an observation)  My son had to get our menus since no one was really helping us. 

So on the quickness for your reading...

Waiter- not very talkative, ok for attentiveness, easy on the eyes but not warm.
Atmosphere- the walls were black and ok ""so-called Spanish"" decorations.  Lots of TV's and there was a full bar. 
*House Salad- too vinegary, the sliced apples tasted as if they used an apple that was old
*Calamari-bland, needed salt and seemed rushed out of the fryer since the batter was not fully crisp.  But at least the tentacles were there.  
*Son's Sliders- he was sad there was no cheese (LOL).  My son was not too happy and said he'd rather have McDo's.  So I had to take a bite since most kids would rather have McDo's.  The burger was dry and tasted like ground beef with the Lipton Onion Soup Mix.  He actually said he'd rather have home-made burgers.  hahahhaha
and the french fries that came with it...he said it's like those fries you get in a can....bwahahahaha.
*Some sliced Steak thingy with mashed potatoes.  It was not hard and chewy but it was very salty.  
My son even tried to dip his dry-ass burger in the sauce of the steak...but  it did not help. 
***White Sangria-tasted just like cheap white wine with diced apple in it.  (To make good Sangria...it must be made overnight and have the flavors marry each other)-NO I will not share my special recipe which I promise will beat the SANGRIA @ CHA CHA CHA'S in the Haight in San Francisco.  I assure you that. 

Anyways....I think this place is only staying in business because of the full bar and all the promos they run.  

I THINK....they should close the place and I can take over running it as a Filipinasian Karaoke Bar and Restaurant....
Whadda you think?????
SOUTHERN HIGHLANDS  need some new flavor and some excitement.

This is what is on their all you can eat menu: 
Pan Fried Dates
House Salad
Tacos (Pastor, Beef, Chicken)- I had the pastor tacos . They are the size of a street taco. The meat was tender and nicely seasoned. 
Spinach Salad
Empanadas (Chicken, Beef, Pork, Veggie)- The pork Empanadas have chunks of meat with a flaky crust. 
Salami Banderas
Grilled Steak or Chicken Skewers-The grilled steak skewer was one of my favorites. The meat was soft and juicy I ate them with some mashed potatoes . Delicious! 
Tortilla Espanola
Albondigas- This is not soup just so you know it is a single meatball . 
Mashed Potatoes- I ordered this as a side to some of my meat dishes. 
Chicken Picatta
Cheese Ravioli
Croquetas- The last time I had a croqueta or croquette I was in Amsterdam so it's nice to know I can get them here too!  
Saut√©ed Mushrooms- If you love sauteed mushrooms you need to order this! Very addicting. 
Couscous- I wasn't too crazy about the couscous . 
Stuffed Artichokes - The stuffed artichokes were also good the artichoke was soft enough where it was easy to chew. 
Tomato Bruchetta- The Bruchetta was just okay . I still prefer the Bruchetta at Grimaldis. 
Chicken & Rice soup
Fried Calamari- The Calamari was excellent! They know how to cook it where it isn't rubbery.
Sliders
Mac & Cheese- The Mac & Cheese is topped with bits of bacon. You know what they say bacon makes things better!! 
Barcelona Fries
Tilapia & Capers
Marinated Olives
Stuffed Piquillo Pepper
Stuffed Mushrooms - The stuffed mushrooms covered in a blanket of cheese is also a must!  
Beef Carpaccio
You also get to choose 1 dessert : 
Patatas Brava
Bread pudding with caramel Sauce
Flan
Tres Leches- The Tres Leches was good but it is a bit on the drier side which is not a bad thing for me. 
Sweet
Empanada
Vanilla Ice Cream

Oh you can't miss the big sign that shows off their $1 PBR specials either.  

We finally came in to dine for their brunch.  We heard from a friend that their breakfast is a must try...mmmm hmmmm it sure is.  Only on Saturday and Sunday from 10a-1pm.

We tried the Barcelona Benedict $6 and Chorizo Hash $6 roasted potatoes with chorizo and roasted tomato poached egg then we couldn't resist and added the escargot and banana pancakes...lol yes odd combinations.  

The Benedict is a homemade turkey patty, topped with your poached egg and roasted pepper topped with hollandaise sauce.  I think if there was spinach added to it, it would be even better...but that's just my taste buds.  Since the hubs had that I went for the chorizo hash.  Oooooooh weeee, that was a combination of deliciousness.  It's served in a hot plate of melted goodness.  Then on to escargot. Save your bread and dip that in the garlic butter mushroom sauce of the escargot.  They are not shy on giving you a lot of escargot.  When it comes out and served to your table, other patron will say, ""what's that smell?""  

Lastly, the banana pancakes.  I'll tell you why this is a must try.  First dessert for breakfast is awesome.  Second, The syrup topping is their banana foster syrup....need I say more?

They had to call 2 people over, just to give me $12 bucks!! One would think that I had hit a jackpot!! That made me feel uncomfortable.  I would have stayed longer, but the waiter was constantly glancing at my poker playing, and you could tell he wanted to voice his two cents with just about every move I would make with the cards I would keep!! Ugh!! Plus they have weird rules and policies written on a piece of paper tapped by the video machines. Not going back for gaming...that's for sure!! Or the food...",82kxXl_1K8M3cU66dhB8lw,4,4,2,7bNoQQmx23KFWhsREyJDYg

The one thing that did, and the reason this is 4 stars instead of 5 is on Mondays they used to have a special, the all you can eat Tapas was lunch priced all day, instead of dinner priced.  The added charge was not cool.  It was Monday, I was excited for the all you can eat, so I paid it.  

The tacos were great, the dates are a can't miss item, the fries are great, and the slider was amazing as well.  All in all if you're looking for great food, and a great atmosphere, this is an amazing option.  

I know other people have other favorites when it comes to Tapas places, but if you compare prices, this one serves up quality food at decent prices.  If you're looking to sample a lot, you can definitely get your money's worth here.

I've lived in the Southern Highlands area for years and always noticed this restaurant and finally decided to dine here after checking out other Yelp reviews.

I can definitely say that I made a lucky choice to enter the establishment on a Monday - all you can eat tapas for $18.99?! Yes please! My hungry hippo self definitely salivated at that option and proceeded to order a variety of tapas to quell my monstrous appetite.

Tapas that I liked:
Pan fried dates 
Saut√©ed mushrooms 
Hamburger sliders
Chicken skewers
Mac and cheese with bacon
Beef carpaccio 
Pulled pork sliders
Vegetarian empanadas
House salad 
Barcelona fries 
Salami banderas
Tomato bruschetta

Tapas that I didn't care for:
Albondigas - I found this to be quite chewy and not very palatable
Ravioli - I am a ravioli fanatic, so part of why I didn't care for it is my high expectations for ravioli
Stuffed mushrooms - mushroom was good but the sauce was mediocre

Now if you're planning on doing the AYCE, just a forewarning that not all the tapas are available and the portions are even smaller. But you can order as much as you want so it's not that big of a deal. The AYCE was the perfect option for me because it came with a glass of sangria and a dessert. I ordered the cheesecake while my mother who accompanied me ordered the flan. Both were delicious!

The ambience of the restaurant is more casual than I expected walking into the establishment, but I enjoyed it none-the-less. It seems like a great place to have a casual dinner or hanging out with friends after work with some sangria, a few tapas, some sports playing on TV and some gaming.

We were greeted and seated very fast.  We were seated next to the bar.  The seating over there is a little cramped and the tables are shorter.  If you are tall or would like a little privacy I would recommend sitting in the normal sized booths away from the bar.  Our server was just friendly enough.  We may have caught him towards the end of his shift.  Our server was different after we had made our initial orders.  Our second server was extremely friendly and our drinks were always topped off.

Chicken Empanadas
Pan Fried Dates
Stuffed Mushrooms
Calamares Fritos
Merguez Lamb Sausage
Croquetas

The dishes were standard tapas size.  I definitely recommend the Croquetas and the Pan Fried Dates!  The only thing I would say I wasn't a really big fan of was the stuffed Mushrooms.  The Croquetas were filled with Serrano ham, Manchengo cheese, and Parmesan cheese.  They were delicious.  And the Pan Fried Dates consist of pitted dates stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon with Merlot reduction and sprinkled with blue cheese.  You only get 5 of them so eat them slowly and enjoy.

4974785,2010-04-29,6,_kdpjoGrIzA64E6aXHA66w,"Returning from Spain only five months ago, we were craving tapas.  There aren't that many options for tapas in Las Vegas beyond the two Firefly locations.

Barcelona Tapas and Bar gives us one other place to consider when you're craving small bites.

Located in a busy strip mall where locals frequent, this restaurant had a few customers by the bar and dining when we walked in on a weekday night.

I had a few things in mind immediately based on previous yelpers, so we got to ordering.  We munched on complimentary bread and spreads while we waited for our orders to arrive.

* Beef Carpaccio ""Thin sliced of tender tails drizzle with balsamic vinaigrette, truffle oil, tapenade, and fried onions"" ($8) - I love beef carpaccio...when it's done right.  Yelpers raved about their version and sadly, we couldn't quite see why.  It's more like cured beef than raw beef, which is what we were expecting.  Not quite like beef jerky, but not delicate like what we're familiar with.  It was also covered with large shavings of cheese, which was not mentioned.   Not sure if this was to cover up the beef or enhance the taste.

* Pastelillos de pollo (Chicken Cakes) ""Chopped chicken, green and red onions, red pepper, chopped cilantro, black bean and corn salsa molded together and grilled served with gribiche."" ($5.50) - Something a bit unusual that you don't see on every menu.  It's a bit misleading in its description since we were expecting all the ingredients to be 'molded together' to create a corn cake.  In actuality, the black bean and corn salsa are on the side of the corn cake.  Nonetheless, it was quite tasty with the accompanying egg sauce.  And it is only one corn cake.

* Merguez Lamb Sausage ""Served with couscous, and roasted pepper tomato sauce and a Merlot wine reduction sauce."" ($7.50) - There was a distinctive lamb taste to it, and what I'm sure was some liver blended into the mixture.  The Husband isn't a fan of most livers so he was very aware of the funny taste to it.  Comes two in an order.

* Pan Fried Dates ""Pitted dates stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon with merlot reduction and sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles."" ($5.50) - Anything wrapped in bacon usually can't go wrong, and dates mix perfectly with bacon in this case too.  Comes five in an order.

* Boquerones (White Anchovies) ""Toasted French bread with a spicy aioli topped with sweet white anchovies and balsamic reduction sauce."" ($5.50) - Anchovies were something we enjoyed everyday when we were in Spain, but we didn't know what took so long for this one order to come out.  The bread could have been toasted just a bit longer.  

* Lomo a la parrilla (Petite Filet) ""Mashed potato, mushroom and Merlot sauce."" ($8.50) - Our final order, which we put in at the last minute.  It took a bit too long, and the waiter did come by to say it was coming out soon.  (It still took longer after that.  I can only assume that our order got stuck behind the larger parties that had come in after us.)  Another one of those dishes I ordered based on raving reviews, and sadly, it did disappoint.  We ordered it rare and although the center was pink, the outside was grilled a bit too long and thus hard.  

We were impressed by how busy it got for a weekday night - and Barcelona Tapas & Bar does cater to families with plenty of large tables, high chairs, and a diaper changing station in the restroom.  Right now they are offering an introductory and temporary offer where kids eat free on Sundays through Tuesdays from 4 pm to 8 pm, for those 10 and under only and with a purchase of an adult entree.

Service was okay - we asked our waitress for another set of silverware and she completely forgot about it.  (Immediately after we asked her, she went to sit a  party that arrived and never came back.)  We also had to ask for our beverages to be refilled.  The man who sat us did ask us how we had heard about them.  We also noticed the chef come by our table four different times to look at what we were eating, but never actually said anything to us.  

Specials include:
Mondays: Half off bottles of wine.
Tuesdays: Half off their homemade Sangria.
Wednesdays: Half off Martinis.
Thursdays: Half off Mojitos.
Fridays: Half off all their tapas from 4 pm to 6 pm
Saturdays: Ladies Night with Half off all House drinks, wines and beer from 10 pm to 12 am.  Live music.
Karaoke everyday (except Fridays and Saturdays) and tapas are half off after 10 pm.

According to their website, they are open for lunch now - but their opening hours are still posted as opening at 4 pm.

I came in for Happy hour and ordered everything from the HH menu so i can try a lot for a little. I was enticed by all of the pictures on yelp and it just so happened that everything that drew me in was conveniently on the HH menu! (Yay) 

I was surprised to say that not one thing gave me that ""wow"" factor! Not one thing imprinted my heart enough to compel me to want to return! Everything, when it comes to the HH menu, was simply bland and unsatisfying. Disappointed! 


Service was quick and great!!! Food came out soo fast, kind of makes me wonder how it's prepared in the back! Not complaining at all, I'm a woman of instant gratification when it comes to eating out, so fast food doesn't bug me! 

All in all, very bland food!! If you're a simple, non picky eater, you will enjoy this. But if you're a person of explosive flavor and enjoy creative culinary spice full foods, this isn't the place for you!",JA1iXUGIBKeCLE2Vvjis1w,1,1,3,3pL7ItavGkwxTCzWJhfmBw

But after passing it a few times, Yelp reviewers couldn't stop me, and I decided I had to make up my own mind. 

So, my man and I came here on a Thursday date night, and had a WONDERFUL time!! Got here around 6ish, and were seated right away. The server was friendly and gave us lots of tips on the most popular items. Everything is like 3 bites, so we decided to go big and order a bunch of things.

Beef Carpacio - DELICIOUS! Great flavor!
Boquerones - My man is spanish and loves anchovies. I was VERY hesitant to try this, but it was AMAZING. He didn't like the balsamic drizzle, but I did... not ""fishy"" at all and one of the best dishes
Tortilla Espanola - It was just alright. Being from Spain, I think my man judges a little harshly, but I've had better than this too. It didn't stop us from eating all of it though :)
Steamed Mussels - So good. The broth was amazing, and so flavorful. We ate all of this in a hurry.
Garlic Shrimp - Just what you would expect. Really good. Lots of garlic in a good way.
Croquetas - There was supposed to be serrano ham in here, but we couldn't really taste it. Nonetheless, it was really good. Crispy outside, and really cheesy/potatoey goodness on the inside.

After ordering all of this, and devouring it cause it was amazing, our server sent out a complimentary chicken cake :) 

Oh, and it was national chocolate cake day, so I decided to get to Chocolate Tres Leches, and it was rich and sweet, and just what I needed to end dinner with. My man got the flan, and it was also really good!! 

When we got ready to leave, the place had really filled up. And I noticed they only had 1 server and 1 helper for the whole place! So since we got there before the rush, our server had time to serve us properly, but now that he had 10+ tables, I can see where the bad reviews came from. I suggest that the management get another server cause the food is great!!

We will definitely be back. To top it off, they have a coupon on their website! You should definitely utilize this, cause our bill was only $50+tip after it was all said and done! Total score!",6gb0T4_MngSXukRUbIMEfQ,0,0,4,jpJweuOjm3JNpihJT--r5Q

Our drinks were never left empty and our dirty plates were always gone right away. Brianna our server was such a sweetheart and her recommendations were amazing. We loved everything she recommended and we would definitely come back just to see her to enjoy the good company while we enjoy our food.

Food was on point! We literally tried everything on the $25.95 AYCE menu except for like 2 items. Almost everything came out bite sized so it was perfect bc we got to try everything to see what we really like and what we thought was just ok. Mostly everything was seasoned perfectly with extra flavor and yes some may have needed a little bit of salt but it was all really good. Nothing we didn't like which was a good sign. 

Some of our favorites were the bacon wrapped dates, salami, beef carpaccio, artichokes, and of course the red sangria which we order multiples of each. With the AYCE it comes with Red or White Sangria and dessert. For dessert we had the bread pudding that comes with dried cherries and ice cream and the chocolate coconut tres Leches with were both so delicious. Yes I was stuffed but I managed to finish both of those haha always room for desserts  

They have daily specials so always check to see what you may like. I will definitely be back on Mondays for their $18.99 AYCE Tapas Special  Next time we will also eat from the A La Carte menu because their paella is calling my name",_2Sa7pq5z2XOUhS9DOCGHw,5,2,5,yOW9AFqplGkmTtAB3C3ZSA
5156380,2012-10-06,0,_kdpjoGrIzA64E6aXHA66w,"Sometimes, all you want in life is sangria. For me, this was a craving that spanned the course of three weeks. So when a friend wanted to meet up for dinner, I knew that Barcelona's happy hour was a must.

From the hours of 4 to 7, happy hour is a must do. Check in on Yelp for a free glass of sangria - sweet, strong, and in quantities more than a single glass, potentially dangerous. My friend and I ordered a mass array of goodies from the happy hour menu. The vegetable empanadas ($2.75) were little fried pockets of all sorts of vegetables - pretty good but nothing fantastic. Croquetas ($2.75) were also good, only made better with the aioli on the side. Lastly, the eggplant cannelloni ($3.50) was perfectly balanced with the hearty eggplant and the tang of tomato sauce. 

While dessert was the last thing on my mind, we somehow got conned into ordering...wait for it, Fried Chocolate Tres Leches a la Mode (I take liberties with the word 'conned'). Sometimes you don't realize you're having a bad week until you take a bite into something so sinfully delicious. One bite of this Tres Leches and suddenly, life is better. 

The food is good, and the happy hour deals amazing. But the real keeper here is Edgar, the owner. He's so warm and hospitable. But be warned, warmness goes right out the door when it comes to dessert. He'll charm you into ordering things you'd never eat normally thanks to diet and a conscience.

This place did not disappoint at all. There was no wait, the waiters were extremely friendly, and the food was delicious. 

When we went, it was pretty quiet, laid back...not really any music playing or any large crowds getting their drank on haha.. Seems like a good Tapas bar for a spot to have an intimate date or small get together to catch up with your friends... 

There was some signs for half off ALL TAPAS on Sundays and Mondays from 8-10pm (such a BOMBBB deal)... and different types of drink/food deals every night. I don't really remember what they were exactly, but if you're a local DEFINITELY check it out! 

I'm sure this place can get crazyyy so I'm lookin forward to coming back during their speciallssssssssss. 

Recommendations: 
Shrimp a la Diabla- if you're into spicy, tangy sauce 
Bruschetta- different from the usual Italian basil flavored bruschetta... lots of olives, feta, tomato 
Surf and Turf- Skewer combo with steak, shrimp in a green sauce, and chorizo... comes with yummy mashed potatoes

If you are the type of person that can make a meal out of appetizers, then tapas are perfect for you. Sometimes called the Spanish dim sum, these dishes are the perfect size to try a few. I am not the type of person that goes to a happy hour to save money, instead I order twice what I normally would and have it even out in the end.

The fantastic dishes: 
Chilled orzo salad- The orzo was cooked al dente with a nice bite and the grilled veggies were very flavorful. 
Beef carpaccio- This was a generous portion of thinly sliced raw beef. The parm, fried onion strings, balsamic vinaigrette, and tapanade mingled well. Place on on the bread and you have a good contrast in textures.
Stuffed peppers- The creaminess of the three cheese blend with a corn and black bean salad was mellow compared to the other strong tastes.
Bananas foster crepe- The crepe was more crisp than normal, but was perfect with the softness of the caramelized bananas and ice cream.

The good:
Stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. These were pretty standard.
Fried goat cheese- The balsamic vinegar and honey that line the dish made it delicious, but very decadent.
Summer bean salad- good but took the dressing from the goat cheese to make it better.
Strawberries tossed in a balsamic vinegar and cream with a sugar crust. Was decent, the balsamic did not play a prominent part in the dish.

The bad:
Tuna tartar- I love raw tuna in any form, but my friend said it all when she said it looked like cat food. It was bland on top of looking less than appetizing. 
Fried tres leches a la mode- Tasted and had the texture of fried chicken. Not the most appealing of the desserts.

The desserts are not part of the tapas deal for happy hour. The only one I would pay full price for is the bananas foster crepe. Our eyes were bigger than stomaches and it almost doubled our bill. Still for everything we got, it was a great deal.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,0,4,jzzt6hNAim1uanhdCGDErQ

The ham and cheese croquets looked good and weren't greasy but were flavorless, again I added salt. My friend had a few different items than we did and agreed the food needed more seasoning.

I feel that I never reviewed this place for that reason, because we just really enjoyed her service, even after numerous bad meals there. 
 I've had meals there that were hit or miss. The food is extremely inconsistent. You have a dish you love, like their Tilapia, for instance was great the last few times I ate there the sauce was different, and the tilapia was so way overlooked. The last straw for my husband was when on Fathers Day last year they had a prime rib or ribeye special, can't remember which. My husband asked the weight, again don't remember if they said 12 or 16 ounces. It was so shady and sneaky, it couldn't be more than 4 and a half ounces! The shady part is this, it was cut very very thin and at a strange angle. It looked like perhaps the rest of this tiny piece of meat was under the mashed potatoes it was served with. My husband lifted up the potatoes and there was nothing there! They cut it slanted and made it appear that the rest of the meat was under the potatoes. If we didn't look, we couldn't prove that this was not the size that said. So sneaky, so much lack of respect for their customers, not to mention we were regulars! Our server was so embarrassed and apologetic. On the top of it it was Father's Day! He was so upset he did not order anything else or has yet to return. My dumb ass have given them so many more chances and wasted to much meals there. My wonderful drinks by Melissa kept me going for their mediocre food, but not since this past Saturday, February 8th, was my meal so horrible! Stuffed mushrooms tasteless, served cold in the middle and just a funny texture. My 7 year old said Barcelona Tapas made her hate mushrooms! She said the best thing was the sprite. The ribs although very tender and fell off the bone outrageously sweet, it was a pile of meat and bones and pieces of bone mixed in the meat.  We ordered a filet, which was not a filet, it was chewy, had weird bristle and we  ordered medium rare, it was medium well. So 10 dollars for crap!

Started with the deep fried goat cheese balls that were really good, definitely recommended! Had the surf & turf skewers which were a bit on the overdone side but still had a pretty good flavor. We also had the stuffed red peppers which were very tasty as well. Just a quick sampling but we'll definitely be back.

The only comparison there would be to make here locally would be Firefly and honestly we prefer it for several reasons. The prices on the dishes are more reasonable at FF and they're a bit overpriced at Barcelona for what you're getting. Also, the flavors are just a little more refined at Firefly and their sauces are right on the money where Barcelona needs a little more practice.

If it sounds like we weren't happy that's far from the case. Barcelona gets 4 stars because we did enjoy what we had and we'll definitely be back. I hope they grow a little bit in terms of making some slight changes to recipes and their menu but overall a good foundation has been layed. Now it just comes down to lowering their steep prices a bit.

Edited to add I forgot to mention the great customer service we had! Our waiter was very friendly and also very helpful when making suggestions as what to order.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,2,1,4,O2PSPuC3XjRFfzk41k4lPQ

First time I ever tried it was at Firefly and it's just as good. They start you out with bread and a sweet chili butter and also a spread which is delish. I always seem to order the same thing. Beef carpaccio, bacon wrapped dates, tilapia, surf & turf skewers, tuna tartar. Those are all pretty good. I've had the empanadas with beef and I honestly didn't like them. They had no distinct taste to them. I like the tuna from Firefly better, but it's still pretty good.

I know this place has lunch specials from 4-7. I noticed the last time they made their portions smaller during this time, when for the past year they had this special it was regular size. Who could blame them though?

5499017,2011-06-01,0,_kdpjoGrIzA64E6aXHA66w,"For a suburban spot Barcelona is surprisingly good. It's not quite up to the level of Vegas standard-bearer Firefly but it's close, fairly quiet, and the service is consistently acceptable. Not exceptional, but Firefly has historically had issues with service.

Most of the dishes I've had here have been good to excellent. The tuna tartare, with wonton chips and pineapple, is a neat study in contrasts. The gazpacho was a little more seasoned than I care for, which takes the focus off the freshness of the soup. The patatas bravas, wrapped in bacon, are cooked perfectly to taste on the inside like baked potato. The chicken banderas are bite-sized skewers of garlic, roasted pepper, grilled chicken and avocado, served with a tasty vinagrette. The pork empanada is also highly recommended, the flaky crust is almost reminiscent of deep-fried Chinese noodles. The ham and cheese croquetas are one of the richest foods I've ever eaten.

I think this place is kind of overpriced, but their half-price tapas happy hour and restaurant.com gift certificates can put it into the realm of the affordable.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,2,0,4,lSDKiHBYlm3qkCnZxcVRAQ

This is also not a trendy, hip place like that OTHER tapas place. That didn't make for an unpleasant visit, though. This place has its own charm. 

The decor is a bit shabby-chic, lending to a laid-back, casual atmosphere, but it's an interesting look, not a bad one. There's a slight sports pub feel due to the TVs and the wide variety of objects on the walls, which were painted dark green (at least the wall alongside my area). The booths are roomy and comfy with slightly high tables. I really liked the servers - very friendly and attentive.

This is a tapas restaurant, therefore there are only a few entrees. I didn't feel like eating a bunch of little meals (ironic, huh?) so I had the pasta entree. My friend had a Groupon, which is why I happened to be invited for this outing.  My pasta dish was not bad, and neither were the fries I tried, but as there was nothing special about them I would try something different during my next visit.  The bread and butter were good, though. That butter was heavenly, as a matter of fact. I hate sweet honey butter but this butter was just right in terms of flavor, sweetness, creaminess (and the way it melted on my tongue like a dream!). 

My friend loved her bacon-wrapped dates and had no complaints about her mac & cheese, beef (veal?) medallions or sangria.  I was impressed that our waiter didn't give us a hard time about the Groupon, as some restaurants do.  The restaurant has its own version of a Groupon on their website, by the way.  Using that coupon would provide customers with the same discount but would not cost the restaurant as much money. I don't want to hate on Groupon, but I don't want businesses to suffer because of them. I hope you'll check out the coupon.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,2,1,3,YpPwmA9y5bS8Dz3jPoFPwg

On this visit, I ordered the bbq ribs, shrimp in Lemon Garlic Butter sauce and beef skewers.  The ribs came with four on a plate and had excellent tangy flavor.  The Shrimp also came with four and a few pieces of baguette sized bread.  The sauce only had a hint of garlic but gave it a nice flavor.

5586812,2011-06-28,0,_kdpjoGrIzA64E6aXHA66w,"I stumbled upon this place quite by accident and I am so glad I did. I went in for a glass of wine, came out with new friends and a promise to return for some food. I went back three times the following week, including my birthday party.

Casual with an elegant, tony *feel*, but inviting, not ostentatious, and fabulously friendly. 

Some of the Firefly favorites (you did know they're within that six degrees of separation idea, right? Well, now you do.) are here, with a twist. The stuffed dates, patatas bravas and various others are throwbacks (in a good way) of what we love from the Firefly*.

The first standout for me: The escargot is simply amazing. I am so used to the tasty (but overused) butter and garlic bath in which snails are usually prepared and presented. En croute or no, let's face it, they're done that way everywhere... everywhere, that is, but at Barcelona. A savory, tomato-based broth with complementary veggies and a healthy (but not overpowering) bit of spice for kick. I can admit it... we ordered it three times. For one friend, it was her first taste of escargot and I was so pleased it was here. We have a convert! Snails *are* yummy!

The portions are perfect; I am only left wanting more because something is that good, it is not for a lack of generosity on the part of the kitchen.

Smaller and more attention-oriented, Barcelona allowed for dietary substitutions (within reason, of course) and was helpful to a fault in finding dishes we would like or helping us if something just wasn't what we expected (diner error, I assure you, and no reflection of the restaurant).

Everything tasted fresh and the flavors were clean. There were a few things we didn't get to try when we had the big group but only because they were running out of certain things.That hadn't happened before, even when the place was busy late into the night... so I am going to give the benefit of the doubt to it being our large party running them down after 5 hours of food and drink goodness.

Whether I am there alone, or there are two of us at the bar, or fifteen of us descending upon them, we are always treated with the greatest of care and welcomed with open arms. Edgar and his staff make you a part of the family and you get the feel from your co-diners that they feel the same way.

I ordered the steak skewers,Barcelona fries, stuffed artichokes,cheese ravioli, Mac and cheese, beef carpaccio,spinach salad,pork taco,
Pretty much everything on the menu
My favorite dishes were  stuff artichokes, stuff dates, cheese ravioli,spinach salad, Mac and cheese
I definitely recommend this place, it's really fun and good, definitely a good place for a girls night out",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,4,3,5,Y0Ul9egc0rDYLbCD4zW8Ew
5924313,2011-06-15,1,_kdpjoGrIzA64E6aXHA66w,"Normally I really like this place, but twice now on a weekend the bf & I have arrived around 11:40, 11:45am and they haven't been at all ready for customers (note that they're supposed to open at 11:30am every day of the week). I mean, we're talkin the door's unlocked, but the ""open"" sign is turned off, the chairs are still sitting inverted on the tables, and neither the owner nor any waiters are there.

The first time, one of the cooks, who was busy in the kitchen, heard us come in and came out to greet us and offer us something to drink and eat. He didn't know how to make mixed drinks, but was happy to offer us some red sangria. The owner showed up 20 or so minutes later, apologized, and offered to make us something else (not comped or even discounted for the inconvenience, mind you). He seems pretty cool in general, though.

The second time, we walked in at 11:40am. By 11:55am someone just noticed we were there, and a waitress had just arrived. Both the cook and she were very nice and accommodating, but I'm still confused as to why they pretend to open at 11:30am when they clearly barely open at noon. I get it that that could be perfectly acceptable in the actual city of Barcelona, but come on, man.

All that aside, the food is good, but used to be better (they've recently changed several menu items for the worse, AND you get an expectations-versus-reality clash since the menu still has the old descriptions, but what shows up at your table isn't at all the same). Most of the menu items they have--including the sangria--Firefly on Paradise does better, hands down. But do I want to drive all the way there that often? Hell no -- and that's where Barcelona comes in. It's a decent, gas-saving substitute when I'm craving Spanish tapas; I'll just likely avoid going there for lunch on the weekends from now on.",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,2,0,3,Q6xvhfO1krSf7O1w7C-QJA

Wish we had come to this one sooner.  Our server was Ariel (like the mermaid, she told us) and she was fantastic.  I can't remember the last time I went into a place for the first time and the person serving me said ""I'm so happy you guys came in!  This is going to be so much fun!""  Come to think of it, that has never happened until I came here.  Her recommendations were 100% on target for us every time.  I did the all-you-can-eat at her suggestion, tried the Pan Fried Dates at her suggestion, tried the Beef Carpaccio and a bunch of other things I probably cannot spell correctly; every dish was exactly as great as she described it or moreso.  When dessert time came around, and my wife had already decided on ordering Bananas Foster, Ariel beat her to the order and said ""You should get the Bananas Foster for dessert.  SO Good!""  She really guided us through the menu expertly from start to finish.  The whole experience felt like we had been invited into someone's home as an honored guest and were dining with good friends.  And if I have not said it enough, my GOD the food was delicious.  There were some items, like the Pan Fried Dates I mentioned earlier... I have never tasted anything like that in my life.  Truly exceptional.  On top of all that, the prices were really quite reasonable.  This is a place we are definitely going back to, preferably soon.  I haven't tasted every dish yet, and this place is so incredible, I really want to try them all.",FWOdutO_Z7qc_HSxLWcJ5Q,0,0,5,dDSfJ74UrP0eEIiTlIn5Mg
5983693,2013-02-19,0,_kdpjoGrIzA64E6aXHA66w,"I like Barcelona.  I think it was a nice addition to the Southern Highlands plaza.  I've been here several times: date nights, birthday parties, etc. etc.

As far as food goes, the food is very comparable to Fireflys; however, I think the sangria is just a touch better.  I prefer both the white and red sangria at Barcelona over Firefly's.  I recommend coming here during happy hour (4p-6p & 10p-12a) so you can get more food and drinks for less!  Just keep in mind that not all their tapas and drinks are discounted though.  But who doesn't like happy hour?

The pan fried dates are a MUST.  Seriously, you can never go wrong with these.  The paella (entree) is also really good.  It does take about 30-45 minutes to make though, so just be aware of that before you order it.

They used to have a printable coupon on their website that was awesome, but alas, it's not available anymore. :( 

If you haven't tried tapas before or you're looking for an alternative to Firefly, I would recommend going to Barcelona.  It's good, not great, but good.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,1,0,3,Z8JckjXJo1DlA8oXw5Mjew
