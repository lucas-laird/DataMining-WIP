Ask the beef on the side if you don't want your beef to be soaked in the soup for too long. Ask for less spicy if you are not a big spicy eater like me. The spicy hotness is very similar to the Chinese hot pot type that stings into your tongue so be ready for that. They also have pig hock noodle soup and all sort of rice dishes. If you just want to stick to a regular pho, their pho is pretty good too.  Their soup is really hot (temperature per say) and it's a plus for me. BTW, you can ask for cooked bean sprout. I'm planning to go back there again already.",jR1QaUqe2bccY7I9BWGZBg,0,0,4,ZtyaVQgqhZZVnpwi8WkqDw

They have authentic food there.  Noodle soup is always hot there.  Their cold noodle with egg rolls are so good.  I just can't believe why no one ever wrote a review for them.  Try it out.  Please!  They need some recognition.  Inside the restaurant is rather simple, but they are definitely cleaner than most pho places.",J-WfsRmH4VPsycArml_G9Q,0,0,5,PHZ4e_cyCRo8dJxR8T0pXA

FYI: traditional mi quang has soup broth that covers only 1/4 of the noodles, but at this place, the broth covers the whole noodle. just the way i like it..",QEQYldM0S2uvjhbjJAuH3w,3,1,4,ECAYIfYUS-c_m1DH7xWryA
2168922,2009-03-31,1,D9iGotN_nI8MCzVpISep9w,"Perhaps I'm a little jaded by being in L.A. so long.  I judge a place by how crowded it is.  My favorite Pho spot on sunset is ALWAYS crowded. I arrived at Que Huong after passing several Pho spots to find it, EMPTY.  I figured I came after the lunch rush.  

I ordered the Pho Tai (beef rare steak pho noodle soup) and the fresh summer roll with shrimp and pork.  The summer roll was the bomb, and the peanut sauce it came with was akin to crack.  One bite and I couldn't stop myself. . . well I stopped myself from licking the bowl, but that was a lot of self restraint.  There was a hint of coconut which set off the awesome little dish.  I posted a picture, unfortunately I couldn't stop myself from eating one of the little buggers before I snapped a photo.  (note to self:  you may get strange looks for being the only person in the restaurant and taking pictures of your food before you eat) Only in vegas?  But I have to say the ingredients, shrimp and lemongrass were super fresh.  

The pho tai came out and the bowl was huge!  Tons of noodles too which I dig.  But alas I must come to the point why I gave it 4 stars.  There wasn't a lot of meat, which is a bummer.  But more of a bummer was there there was NO ambiance to this place.  I could have felt a little less weird if there were music, a tv, any distraction besides being the only person, inhaling peanut sauce, and taking pictures of my food.  Ok, maybe I'm a little weird but someone should bring these folks a boom box.  Or might I suggest bringing your own Mp3 speakers and making a party?  

All in all, good pho, awesome summer rolls, I will come back when the pho craving returns and I'm in vegas.  

Oh and by the way, the total for the summer rolls, a hot tea, and the pho tai.  $10.45!!!  Maybe I should have given it a 5th star.",e7Hs-mEDH2HTtSAH1HFOcg,0,0,4,iqcpaOmlYYBlcR-fmmiJQA
2540197,2012-01-04,0,D9iGotN_nI8MCzVpISep9w,"This review is of one item, and one item only. I don't even think the dish is on the hard menu but I come here at least once every two weeks to get it (sometimes twice in during the colder seasons). 

The Pho Spicy Beef Sate.

For anyone who likes spicy food and noodles this is a MUST HAVE! It's not like any other pho you have ever tried. The soup is a thick and flavorful broth with chili peppers and onions. There are some cucumbers and tomatoes which I believe is also cooked with the soup. The noodles are soft and satisfying unlike other pho places where they just simply pour hot soup over the pre-packaged noodles and you can still feel the noodles softening as you eat it. The best part about about this dish (besides the soup) is the beef. The beef is so tender and juicy. Usually the beef in pho is chewy and flavorless but the beef in this dish is literally cooking within the soup. All of the textures (noodles, beef, cucumber, tomatoes, onions, chili peppers) blend together so perfectly in this delectable, spicy pho.

 * Just a heads up, I do get mine WITHOUT peanuts, bean sprouts, and cilantro (as pictured in the photos) *

The dish is about $7. Be sure to being cash or a couple friends because they do not accept card unless the total is over $20.

But if you have a couple dollars, you're around that area and you're craving something hot, spicy and delicious...be sure to check it out!",_AMcbwIpiw0Hm_ztXeNpiQ,0,0,5,_OdYD3DplpgDlUVJx0hdyw

3074785,2011-11-20,0,D9iGotN_nI8MCzVpISep9w,"PQH is underrated and definitely deserves more attention.  

I was sad to walk into an empty restaurant at 8pm on a Sat but based on the reviews, I had to give it a try.   We received excellent service....probably 5 star if you rate against Asian restaurants.

The spring rolls with shrimp and pork were fresh because the rice paper wasn't dry or hard.  Many times, you'll get these at other places which means it was made before.  

We ordered the Banh Xeo (crepe with shrimp, pork, bean sprouts) and although the crepe was nice and crisp, it was filled too much with bean sprouts.  It would have been nice to have more shrimp and pork but the flavor was spot on.  The pairing with the pickeled carrots and cucumbers in the lettuce wraps was the perfect combo.

Based on Tomoko's recommendation, we also ordered the Beef Satay with Thick Rice Noodles.  This was super rich as the broth was really thick but was very flavorful.  

I'd definiltey come back to try their pho, com (Rice dishes) and more. 

I hope this place gets more business.  I believe it's a hidden gem and many of the other Yelp reviewers agree.  It's like finding the younger sister of Pho So 1.",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,1,1,4,T5_MR01Z2EvroeHt1bvBUg

About average on the cleanliness for an Asian place.

However, their food is excellent.  Their Pho is great, I've had it a few times and it was excellent - all of their meats (steak/flank/chicken/etc) are good quality and their broth is great.

3382527,2011-03-25,0,D9iGotN_nI8MCzVpISep9w,"Vietnamese restaurants can be found in most big cities (except Palm Springs, CA), so why the surprise in Vegas? And there are plenty of them. You have to count with both feet too if you really want to know.

To the point, it served just ordinary Pho. Maybe they are not really Vietnamese since they speak Cantonese.

We were the first customer at 10 AM on a Sat (Wendy's next door was my first choice but it opened at 11). I went straight to the Pho, item #1... the staple of Vietnamese dishes in USA. The broth was light and plain. It looked filtered, so was the flavor. It's a small bowl with pathetic amount of meats, not for the $7 in SoCal. Oop! I forgot. This was the touristy Vegas I'm talking about.

So diners, there are so many options, better options, out there. Do you really want to take a chance on Que Huong?",P-CRYltpvp4aABRctIZWtg,0,0,3,9tBOWx_X1zmwKxN_c1O1sQ

As we walked thru the door, we were greeted with a warm smile and a friendly hello. 

The staff was very helpful in helping us to choose our meal. These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across. They really want to make your experience a good one.

The restaurant decor is Yellow, with Green Plants, and Red Upholstery. The mirrors on the walls are clean. The table is average showing just a little wear, but still nice. 

Pop Rock Music is played, at a moderate volume 

I ordered a Spicy Soup Pate, It was pretty tasty.
My lady friend ordered a noodle soup and was completely full.

I was not filled up, so much, so I ordered another dish.. BBQ Rice.

Three dishes, and a tip for under $25.00. 

The average price is about $6.95 on the menu.

I like it and I will return...

After tasting the pho, I knew I had good reasons to be doubtful. The broth and noodles were flavorless. The only saving grace was the rest of the ingredients were acceptable and my Pho did come out hot.

The only way you can have worse service than an Asian restaurant is not even executing the simplest request. I asked the water 3 times till I finally got my first cup of water. Water or some other drink should be given when  you sit down with your menu. The waiter just couldn't remember a cup of water, and there was only 2 other small groups in the restaurant. I'm surprised he actually got the right order.

Anyway, my family finally decided to try the place out just to see how their food was. When we walked in, the place was almost empty, even though it's Memorial holiday weekend. The furniture look old and raggy. Anyway, we were there for the food, so furniture didn't matter. We order Bun Thit Nuong, side of EggRoll,and Mi Trieu Chau, along with Soda Xi Muoi (salted plum) and Soda Chanh (soda lemonade). The drinks were so awful, tasted neither like lemonade nor anything good. The soda was flat and just nasty. Moving on to the food. Their food looked and tasted like stale noodle and meat. Their egg-rolls were burned and stored bought (because I bought that same ""made in Vietnam"" egg-roll at S&F market last year). They were not good. Worse, we found ants in the chili paste. Base on the mixed reviews of their Pho from other yelpers, I don't think I will ever be back to this place.
