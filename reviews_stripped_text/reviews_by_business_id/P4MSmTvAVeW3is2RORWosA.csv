The female was polite and felt bad for a bunch of us having to wait way too long in line but the male was rude and uncaring. He ignored me totally after I had received my food and then discovered the men's room was locked. Fortunately, the nice lady working helped me right away. Would never return.",dDUMWM6lJZGkruMYzZOgHQ,0,0,1,g2L1o5_dx3nHUGMZnTYdow
196099,2012-06-12,0,P4MSmTvAVeW3is2RORWosA,The owner Scott is the rudest person I've met in a long time I have called and complained on him and I think anyone else who witnesses his behavior would do the same. I am determined to make this man understand that the way he is running this business is not sufficient. Scott seems to be an unhappy miserable person who treats his employees like crap! Scott has no respect for himself his business the subway franchise his employees or his customers. Save yourself the trouble and just go to another subway the food is pretty much the same.,GRXixaGGv4kgBWbV7IrnoA,9,0,1,78QIN-twoOlN9T8mFh_kag

I am calling corporate to also let them know how bad they treat their customers and ""run"" their business. This location is right next to our home and we rarely go to subway anymore because of how we are treated EVERY time, together or separately. Seriously, it never fails there is always an issue when we go in. The sandwiches are never up to par and they act like they are bothered to make a sandwich. The husband is really odd and the wife is a TOTAL B!TCH! DO NOT GO THERE! They SUCK more than their CRAPPY SANDWICHES. Thank Heaven Kneaders is across the street Much better quality and SUPERIOR Service than THIS CRAPPY SUBWAY! STAY AWAY!",NETXwi6TQivUUTpILnErRw,0,0,1,c7ypVJi--jy7XSkxB6g6xQ

The place was very clean but was cleaning anyways she then made me the best oven roasted chicken sandwich I have ever had at a Subway restaurant.  The food was excellent an the service was amazing.  I didn't see the infamous owner ""Scott"" yelling at his employees or see him at all for that matter.  I will definitely recommend this Subway to my friends and neighbors who live in this neighborhood with me.",mCz4AYDBzpXs8wEIEcoa0A,1,0,5,eQNKIzYMHTWXGb7x1bXCHA
425924,2010-03-01,0,P4MSmTvAVeW3is2RORWosA,"I am a huge Subway fan for quick cheap eats.  A Subway lunch has been the norm for me over the past 5 years.  

At this location, food is average for a subway but the service is the worst you will find. The kids making your sub never seem to know what they are doing. The owner is constantly yelling at the sandwich artist as they make your sandwich.  It is shocking to see the owner treat his employees in this manner in front of customers. The owner is strange and aloof and not customer service oriented.  

There are plenty of Subways in Vegas, stay away from this one.  I recommend the Quiznos across the street if you are looking for good food and service.",GeZ7JQpjZ5q0_EStk8WWjQ,2,0,1,ESYXDPE7HSiuN_4BO4hJMA

Diana helped me this time and she was super nice, the other girl working didn't have a name tag and she seemed like she hated her job. There's nothing wrong with this place and I definitely don't think it deserves two stars. It's a normal, clean, nice subway.",81TwDLaT--phE6d4ir67UQ,4,1,4,Kar-wS0xFNTzW-oUJ-YRow

Every single time I've gone (mind you, I've been there A LOT since it's near me), the customer service is horrible. They aren't very friendly at all. It basically ruins the entire experience for me.

2015145,2012-04-16,0,P4MSmTvAVeW3is2RORWosA,"We all know Subway: Eat Fresh!  Cheap sandwiches made quickly, 5 dollar foot-longs, etc.

The one thing I like about this Subway is the fact you can order and pay online, just show up, and pick up your sandwich.  Excellent for being on-the go, especially if you know you're going to be around that particular afternoon or evening to get your sandwiches for the family but are currently stuck in the office or what have you.  

Aside from that perk, the interior is clean, there are usually ample tables, the staff has been there for a while, they greet you pretty quickly.   

I took away a star due to the GM/owner, this kind of ""off"" older guy lecturing and kind of embarrassing one of his employees in front of the customer(s).  I thought that was really unprofessional and awkward to witness.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,3,0,2,EBDZC8goTWIL2qvHvmo0lg

I had a chicken bacon ranch, with only spinach & black olives only! I asked him for more black olives 5 times!! 2 times he gave me 2 more olives & the other times he literally ignored me. I feel extremely bad for the workers who work under him. Will NEVER be going here again. Your store would run better if you were nicer to people.",aVc1kVO6sDzbyRLShN2U7A,1,0,1,OUm_Ammsdrsfmnoxg8LjJQ

I used to get full from eating a 6"" now I need to eat the 12"" plus chips & cookies. There chocolate chip cookies are so yummy. But so pricey now =T sigh 

Note I'm not a fat person =P I been eating almost the same amount of food for a while.

The service is nice. I'm in and out of there. The place seems clean. They don't have every good specials no more. But in the ad mailers you can find coupons for breakfast and there 6"" subs.",ZzC-ngWslLIw2hZbWFs3VQ,1,0,3,q0JycvpwqEeCgZoU8SRHdg

Anyways, this is what you would expect at a subway, the same selection, decent quality, decent value.  My only complaint was that my meatball marinara was never toasted when I told them to toast it.

My sons sandwich was not toasted ad cold.  I went to counter and told them I had asked for a toasted sandwich.  They told me that they could not toast it more since they had alredy given it to me (that they could not take it back and put in the toaster) and if I wanted it more toasted, I would have to pay for another sandwich.  I told them I had just spent over $25 for my lunch and I wanted my sandwich the way I ordered it.  After more debate, the clerk said ""Whatever"" and remade the sandwich and acted like she (or he, couldn't tell) was doing me a favor.  Are You Kidding Me????  This is how they treat their customers????  Keep your effing sandwich......you have lost a customer and I will tell everyone I know to stay clear of this location, including Subway Corporation.

Don't even bother ordering online because when you get here it won't be ready anyway and they will act like you are inconveniencing them. Not to mention that the young lady by the name of Andrea that works there is a ball of attitude and it shows on her face every time you walk in and she is there. For one she will not greet you at all. Second, she will have her resting bitch face ready to throw your way if you DARE ask for more condiments and lastly she will put SO much salt & pepper and oil and vinegar that you will immediately get high blood pressure while eating your soggy ass sandwich!!!
