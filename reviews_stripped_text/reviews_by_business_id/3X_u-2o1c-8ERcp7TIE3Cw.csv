Pretty misleading sign and employees need to learn what their sign is ""selling"".",8-VlEyudaPU6z70Mqtb0rA,0,0,1,cTFdSXy1D5zYTQjcX97CYQ

Well I have once but this pasta with meat sauce and garlic bread was just what I need before heading back towards California! The cashiers were super funny and polite and Tony the cook made us fresh past with a smile!

Counter area was clean which is a most for me including service area as well! 

I wish that I could have remembered the older ladies names and the pregnant young lady as well but because they made my food as I created it I gave the all a $5.00 tip just because!!

I'm pretty easy to satisfy but I demand great service always or I can take my money  somewhere else!

Thanks ladies for making me day!!!",WmwFjhvUYAaHAXtU99FusQ,0,0,5,cXP-iqlpbUHEk2xSc728Yg
4529026,2018-06-25,0,3X_u-2o1c-8ERcp7TIE3Cw,The food is expensive and extremely poor quality.  I was hungry I couldn't even finish my plate because it was just gross. The lady attending us gave my mom attitude when she asked her why she was over charging me. Maybe they were having an off day but everyone looked like they were in annoyed. I really hate giving bad reviews but this place is just terrible. I could have ordered some where with better quality food but like I said I was super hungry.,w73yTy15vZRA97SBm_X2Mg,0,0,1,vnsiSQDsASeuFpZrsMaqXA

Atmosphere - 4 stars
Food - 4 stars
Service - 4 stars

Background - I needed some food before I become Hangry!

Atmosphere - It is the outlet malls food court.  Nothing to fancy here.  The place was actually packed.

Food
  Snack -The pizza slices are in the display window partially cooked.  So that is the only thing you can order pizza wise.  I was watching and hoping for that last slice of pepperoni to make till I was next in line.  A slice of pepperoni pizza please.  They place your slice back in the oven to warm it up to temp that burns you mouth on that first bite.  

Service - It is a fast food pizza joint, the staff was polite.  I got what I needed from them.

Future - If I had to use the food court again I would pick this place.",gVO3VZwCu54Otc7bUB33Mg,24,19,4,Jmf3looKKMhg2B8lrS-ftg
