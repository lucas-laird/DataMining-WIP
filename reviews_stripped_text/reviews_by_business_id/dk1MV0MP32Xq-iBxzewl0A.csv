First, the drive thru speaker is so bad, I couldn't hear the girl taking my order and vice versa.  Repeated it 3 times before she got it right.  Once we got to the window, the person taking order stepped away to help with food - she didn't seem to be wearing gloves to handle the food or wash her hands, but maybe?  Anyway, when she came to the window in about 7-8 minutes, she handed me the bag of food/3 smoothies.  I asked her if we got chips with our wraps and she said yes.  I then said, what kind of chips do you have.  She said, ""sorry, all we have our sun chips, so you can't really choose"".  Once I got home, we had 1 pkg of lays salt/vinegar, 1 cheese sun chips and 1 original sun chips.  She was too lazy to even ask us which chips we wanted and instead lied to me.  Then, I checked my punch card and she cheated me 1 punch.  Also, didn't even offer me my receipt.   We ordered 3 different wraps - none were marked, so we had to peel apart the wraps to determine which is which.  This particular tropical smoothie is definitely a 1 star as far as employees/management goes.  I will start going to a different Tropical Smoothie from now on.

969114,2013-09-26,10,dk1MV0MP32Xq-iBxzewl0A,"""I was so disappointed with this place, that I was compelled to write this almost as soon as I finished eating."" says Kellie A. in a review over a year ago.  Well lets start by saying that not a whole lot has changed in a year and that was my first thought on my drive back to work.

First off I already had read some of the reviews and it was a consistent ""customer service is crap"" here.  I didn't pick the place as I was meeting my friend for a lunch date.

When I walk in my friend is at the front of the line and there is a lady behind her.  No staff around.  We wait.  And wait.  And finally Mr. Ignacio shows up.  No greeting just asked my friend what she wanted to order.  When he finally got to me I ordered a Chicken Caesar salad and a diet coke.  He then asks me if I want a 12 oz or a 24 oz and without hesitation I order the 12 oz thinking the smaller is better....not fully realizing its a kids cup.  I pay for my meal (by the way he never told me how much it was) and he walks away.  No receipt.  No drink cup.  No ""I will have your order right out"".  So I move to the side to see if someone can help me.  Immediately he is annoyed and ""thought"" he gave me a cup (my kids cup).  I ask if THAT is 12 oz and he said yes.  Ok I guess?  Would have been nice to mention that little detail. The receipt without any conversation was awkward not knowing if he was going to give it to me or not.  Again he hands it to me and walks away in silence.  What a ball of joy this guy is.

So my name is called and I kindly thank the guy (another employee) for my lunch.  My girlfriend ordered the same salad and as I am a quarter through I look at her salad and realize mine doesn't have chicken.  I quickly look at my receipt and make sure I ordered it with chicken. Sure enough they forgot the chicken.  So once more I'm headed to the front with no one around waiting for assistance.  Mr. Ignacio's slow ass comes up and as nice as can be I state that my Chicken Caesar Salad is missing chicken-praying and hoping they don't spit on it.  No apologies just an argument of him wanting my salad back and me not wanting them to do bad things to it.  I informed him that he can bring out the chicken separately which he did and added extra to be nice I guess. Thanks but no thanks.  The chicken looked gross and was clearly nuked (a little cold in the middle).  Maybe that's why they drench the salad in dressing ""over"" the whole salad so you don't see the chicken-which is how my friend's looked when it came out.  

Anyways, I counted like 4 employees in the back.  Don't know what the heck they were doing because no one was up front unless forced to when a line piled up.  Not to mention not one of them paying attention to customers up front. This is exactly what I'm talking about how special it is to have a young person giving great customer service.  Because it is not often that you see that.  In this case with Ignacio, I cant believe they have him servicing people.  No personality and not one skill of customer service.  Very sad.  Lets just hope someone mentors the poor guy to grow up with a positive and friendly attitude. 

Like other reviews there isn't much to say positive. What a disappointment on all levels.  Maybe management should check out the reviews to realize after a year they aren't getting better...sigh.  Definitely will not be returning to this location.",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,14,10,1,Jf-0KVr-deasjuUsd2L6cQ

Took my daughter here for a smoothie I've been promising her, and we passed this place the other day, which said ""kids eat free 4p-7p with a purchase of adult paradise combo.""
To keep this review down to less than a book, here are my positive and negative experiences:
-The staff is unfriendly and look depressed like someone beats them when they go in the back
-even with free kids meal, my meal was still $10 which was.....
-not even that great. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap that was mediocre at best. My daughter said ""of all the pizza she'd ever had, they were better than this one,"" and I'd have to agree. It tasted like cardboard with ragu, microwaved.
-one size of smoothie for adults=too big
-my usual smoothie which I bought today, peanut butter cup tasted...somehow off. Not very flavorful and seemed watered down! like not enough things other than ice went in it.
-It took long. There was no one in the place when we walked in,and it took nearly 20 min to get mine/daughter's food. For microwave food, this is unacceptable.

You know, I can't think of anything positive here, except ""I'm glad I didn't ask my hubby to accompany us, or he'd a been mad too.""

2. 24 hour Drive-Thru

And they also have a variety of food choices from salads to toasted wraps and Flatbreads. I had one of the wraps before, it was the Sesame Chicken. It was ok...the sauce they used in it was too strong for me, and very sweet ( in my opinion), and they used a lot which in turn made my wrap a bit soggy.

Its Chicken, mozzarella cheese, green and red peppers, some onions, romaine lettuce and i think it was southwest ranch all on flat bread. Yum!!!

I got the peanut butter cup smoothie, one of their indulgent smoothies, because it was the only thing that sounded good.  It's chocolate, banana, and peanut butter.  The flavors didn't really meld together for some reason.  I would get a mouthful of banana, then a mouthful of peanut butter.  Didn't taste much chocolate, even though it was the dominant color.  And there was no way I could finish it all.  Their smoothies are huge.

two stars because the food tasted good but when it takes 25 minutes from order time to getting food in a drive thru something really needs to be fixed.

I decided to give it a second chance today and their DT speaker had a sign that said no cards bc the system is down, cash only. Again, I was the first and only in line.

The two star rating is spawned from the seemingly intolerable drive-thru wait time and service.  On this particular trip I decided to time my experience.  36 minutes total from line entrance to smoothie acquisition.  On top of that I was charged for 3 smoothies initially despite being well within the buy 2 get 1 free time window.

They're drive thru takes way too long, granted they offer sandwiches and eraps, no other food place takes this long for the drive thru.

This last visit I decided to go inside since I saw 4 cars in the drive thru.

The 2 female associates making the smoothies saw me but didnt say anything, they could've greeted at least.  As I stood and waited another associate Miro? Came to the front, looked at me, and went to the back again.  NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.  

I was finally able to put my order in once the associate came back to the front, counted an existing register, and had a glance at their phone.

So we ordered a king Caesar wrap, a chicken baja flatbread, a beach bum smoothie and a half turkey sandwich. So first of all, it took 5 minutes for us to order. The person greeted right away, but I have no idea what the hell he was saying. He spoke so fast and then I tried to order, but he didn't respond. So a minute or two pass by & I keep saying ""Hello?"" Then he finally takes our order for the flatbread and wrap and then stops responding.... We keep saying ""hello"" again and then another minute later he finally responds again. And he responds confused saying ""ooookay..."" Like, why was he so confused? 

So, we pull up to the window and he goes, ""So what was your order?""
I repeat everything again.
""So did you still want the wrap and flatbread or just the smoothie?""
Yes we want all the food we ordered.
""Oh okay shoot hold on let me fix that""

Like, when did I ever cancel the flatbread and wrap? Lol. Then I ask for the smoothie to be charged on one credit card, and the other 2 items on the other card. He closes the window, then runs everything on one card for some reason. Opens the window again, stares at the cards like it's something foreign then says, ""sorry hold on you want what?"" I tell him again, then he closes the window and calls someone else over to help him redo the transaction. 
I also hand him my friends lvac card for a discount, and he was very confused. He stares at that stupidly too. I respond, it's for the gym discount? Then he closed the window and doesn't ask about it again.
*Everything so far took 10 minutes already.*
10 minutes later, we finally get our food. I had to ask for the stamp card back. He forgot he even had it I guess. 

We get home and look at our receipt and he didn't even give us the discount. My flatbread was okay, kind of dry and barely had any sauce in it. The smoothie was good and the sandwich, but my friends Caesar wrap was very sloppy and had old lettuce in it! I can't believe how horrible of a visit we had.

First of all, it looked like it wasn't even open. There were no cars parked in front and only one person was inside and it was a homeless man. The two employees inside were talking about how he shouldn't be in there, but I was thinking he might as well be in there; hell, he's your only customer. He did have a drink that he had bought and all his stuff laid out on the table and was listening to music and dancing in his seat, but for the most part, he was harmless and kept to himself. 

Some young kid was the only one in there when I arrived and his coworker came in a little while after. Both acknowledged me, which I was surprised about, given the massive amounts of negative reviews. There were a few cars in the drive thru and he said he'd be right with me, which was fine, because it gave me time to figure out what I wanted. I ended up ordering the Sunrise Sunset. While it was good, it wasn't ""blow your socks off"" good. It was blander than what I expected. I've been to Jamba Juice and ordered similar items that have had more flavor. I think they are being cheap and using less fresh ingredients and more ice. That's why it was so watered down. I might give them a try, again, but they wouldn't be my first choice for a smoothie, especially when there were 3 other smoothie places in the same shopping center.",nOv0AvP4doCU6Kg9ge-xFg,34,32,3,Kll0-Qbx6dnrzZJ5lqOjWg

Not a big smoothie person to begin with but there is a deliciously great smoothie place on lake mead called Berry Blendz. The fruit is fresh, they have a huge menu and different size options and I would go there any day. 

Because it's hot and I love Berry Blendz, I decided to try Tropical Smoothie. What a waste. The location is a new one, although they must have transferred the Yelp page over bc the reviews/ pics are from the previous location. The interior of this one is new and clean and refreshing and has a drive thru. 

There were three employees working all moving at glacial speed. I sat down at the bar top right next to the cashier but everyone behind the counter continued to just do their thing before anyone acknowledged me or took my order. I watched a girl make someone's sandwiches slower than I've ever seen anything in my life. 

The smoothies come in one size which in my option is stupid bc who needs a smoothie that big. But anyway, I was still excited to try it. I watched the employee make it which included ice, the smallest amount of fruit I've ever seen and tap water that was running from the sink they had going. My smoothie was so bland and flavorless. It was like blended ice with juice. And then I had this huge thing of it to drink for $6. 

Perhaps it was just this experience and others would be different although based on the reviews overall, I get the sense this experience  is pretty common.

When we got there, there were no customers, but the drive thru lane seemed busy. There was only one staff member, Marcus, we saw working. He was courteous and took our order as soon as he was done with a drive thru order. Our order was taken at 2:37 p.m. A few minutes later, another female customer came in, waiting to order. After that, two staff members came in, a male named Verna and another African American female, wearing fuzzy slippers, which by the way, in my opinion, is an inappropriate footwear for work. It looked like they came from their break time, wearing the TSC visor and apron.The female customer that came in after us knew the female staff member that came in and greeted her and they knew each other. She took her order and made her smoothie right away. We were there before her. This staff member of yours even gave her the left-over smoothie with no charge. On top of that, it seemed that the order was not entered and seemed free. The staff took the cash and pretends to push the cash register. That's the first incident we noticed... We may be wrong but check your cameras. After waiting a while longer, this is already 2:55 p.m. - our smoothies weren't even attended to. There were 3-4 cars in the drive thru lane that drove by and left with their orders but not OURS. There are now THREE staff members, and no one attended to our order. I then came up to the counter and asked for our refund. I asked the female staff of why she did not took care of our order and she said that she was not even working. And yet she helped her friend and pocketed the cash payment. I was confused. There was confrontation and exchange of words. If she was not working, why was she there? Neither Marcus or Verna knew her name. Both stated they just started working. I  totally understand if they did not want to be involved but it does not help that neither do not know the name of their co-worker. She was very rude and had no remorse of her behavior. She does not represent TSC's customer service. I am sure you provide training to your staff to deliver excellent customer service.
I could not believe this happened but it did. I've attached a video clip of her screaming at us and flipping us off.

5840732,2015-06-14,1,dk1MV0MP32Xq-iBxzewl0A,"So usually come to this location for the 24hour drive thru late night. The late night staff is always good. Came in about a week ago in the late afternoon and had terrible customer service so felt the need to do an updated review. We ordered four smoothies to go. Noticed in the car that two of the smoothies looked great and the consistency they should have. The other two however were so thin that it was literally the consistency of water. Never have seen a smoothie look that thin especially when the other two I ordered looked how they were supposed to. Went back inside to ask them to remake  just those two. The guy behind the counter, Shawn had the worst attitude. I'm amazed this guy is employed in customer service because he is terrible at it. He was immediately confrontational when asked to remake them. Showed him what they looked like and his reply was ""yeah that's just how they come out sometimes nothing we can do"" um excuse me?!? Said again we wanted them remade he then says "" we don't remake anything unless it doesn't taste right"" really? I have worked in food service for many companies all of which would instruct its employees to remake an item if it's not right. My theory is that I'm pretty sure he was the one that mixed those two smoothies and for some reason took personal offense to being told they were not made properly. 

So after literally arguing about them making our order wrong he rolls his eyes then instructs the girl in the back to remake them then hides in the back right by where the smoothies are made. Hell no I'm not taking it at this point. Asked for a manager who of course was not there. Demanded refund. I'll give the other girl on duty credit kaylene or something like that. She came to the register apologized and offered to remake them. After being treated so poorly we just wanted a refund and to go to the other location down the road. She refunded us no questions asked and apologized again.

But keep in mind that for the past 4 years, I lived in Irvine, CA where the only 24 hour things we had was a 7-Eleven, Denny's, one donut shop, and one CVS store. 

One day I was craving a smoothie and immediately thought, I'll go to a Jamba Juice! Then I learned that they did not have any locations near where I lived. But that's okay because I discovered Tropical Smoothie Café, which is better in my opinion!

This past week, I came here two days in a row because I liked it so much! When I first walked in, I was surprised to see a full menu of smoothies and food, for some reason I thought they just had drinks. Good to know that I can also grab food for breakfast or lunch here! So far I have tried the Acai Berry Boost and the Paradise Point Smoothies. Both were very good and made perfectly (not watery)! I also have my eye on other flavors that I want to try next. On my second visit I ordered the Paradise Combo, which is any smoothie + a wrap, sandwich or a salad (you pick one) + chips or fruit. It was $9.99, but for all that I think it was worth the price. I tried the Sesame Chicken Salad, which was pretty good. They even gave me extra dressing, even though I didn't ask for any.

I waited at the drive thru call up for quite some time before someone felt honored enough to grace me with an inquiry for my order. Then when I got to the window, she opened it up, looked at her screen and said ""Oh Crap"" and then shut the window on me.  What happened after that was a case study for bad customer service.  The three staff members huddled around and talked and then when about eight minutes later she opened the window again, she said nothing and so I asked, ""Is there a problem with my order?"" and she says ""No"" and then she goes to the register to let me know what my total was and I hand her my credit card.  She runs the card but noticing that the window is open,decides to close it again in case I was getting any feeling of warmth.  She hands me the receipt to sign without saying a word and continues a conversation with her fellow staff.  She then hands me the drink and I put it in my cup holder and then with what might have been the most dismissive stance I've received, she continues to talk and hands the bag out the window not even looking at me.
