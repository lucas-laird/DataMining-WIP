Same Jersey Mike's quality you expect to find at any of their locations.  At least, I HOPE you expect to find it there.

I had the #13 (Original Italian, I think it was called).  There was a very sizable portion of lunch meat on the sandwich, which was awesome of course.  The toppings were very fresh, and the bread was pretty recently baked it seemed.  Despite the very long line, the staff moved quickly, but accurately, efficient and friendly as well.  

It was a little more than I like to spend on lunch, but compared to the other options of burgers, pizza, and just general fried stuff, it was clearly the winner on appealing to my taste buds.  I don't like to grease-up when flying, so a sub shop usually gets my vote.  If I'm back here again and have the time, Jersey Mike's it is again.",OYqbkGuG-FksdFhggwljjw,0,0,4,NbIK-UxjpsNDfZiNrsZaCQ
1229984,2018-03-17,4,bLieCqMMt4la2i8M2v1TUg,"Jersey Mike's Subs at the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, specifically next to Nathan's, Between C22 & C23 (in the Southwest Terminal). 

After walking around the terminal, looking for something to eat for dinner (Although I had brought food with me, it wasn't quite enough to hold for dinner), my husband and I ended up picking this place. As we looked over the menu, it dawned on me that it would be cheaper to purchase a giant size sandwich instead of a regular size sandwich for the 2 of us. So we ended up getting:

Giant Size #7: Turkey Breast And Provolone, $16.99 prior to tax- Because I do not like spicy foods, we omitted the jalapenos (although I am sure if we requested for half of the sandwich to have it, I am sure the employee making our sandwich would be able to accommodate). We also omitted the onions, pepper, oil & vinegar (my husband just decided to omit these things just in case I do not like them. Like a true Yelp member, I was busy taking photos of this place and the menu board to pick what I wanted on the sandwich so I let my husband make that decision). The sandwich itself was really good. I thought the sandwich had plenty of turkey and also lettuce and tomato. The freshly sliced provolone (an employee slices it right in front of you as you order your sandwich) had a great flavor that enhanced this meaty sandwich. 
-------------------------
(Total= $18.39 after tax)

All of the employees helping us were very friendly (the person who initially took our order, the person helping to add the toppings on our sandwich and the person helping to ring us up at the register). I appreciated that when I asked if they could quarter our sandwich since half of a sandwich is just way too large of a size to eat, they did so happily. 

The only thing that did bug me though was that the employee wrapped our sandwich (after cutting it into 4 sandwiches) in 1 large butcher paper and stuffed it into a narrow paper bag. I would have preferred for 2 sandwiches to be wrapped separately from the other 2 so that each person could have their own. Maybe this is something I can request for in the future. 

I know that the prices for this sandwich place is pretty high, especially compared to any other location of Jersey Mike's that isn't at the airport. But I have accepted the fact that a lot of airport eateries will charge a higher price because you are in a desperate and vulnerable spot (and maybe the rent at the airport is high) and so that isn't as big of a concern to me. My husband and I travel a lot so it just comes with the territory (but please note that not all airport restaurants have such a high inflated price. Some places are actually quite reasonable, but this airport isn't 1 of them).

Overall, I really liked my sandwich and was pretty satisfied after having 1/4 of the sandwich and saved the other 1/4 for the next day (a little soggy from the filling but still pretty tasty). 

If I was ever at this airport, down in this terminal again, I would consider getting another sandwich here.",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,5,4,4,d0WU91Qi95Glcx6dCFaISg

I scanned the reviews of all of the restaurants in the terminal I was in and really just nothing was standing out to me. Am I surprised? No. No one like airport food. My decision to eat at Jersey Mike's was mostly made because one had just opened in Reno and I was curious about their sandwiches.

There is no place to sit down here, it's just a walk up counter to order, pay, and get your sandwich. Finding a chair or a table elsewhere is totally up to you. I decided on the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich (because I'm a sucker for steak and fake cheese). I can't comment on the authenticity, but I did find it quite good (albeit quite messy too). It was a nice size and they don't skimp on the meat.

Yes, it's fast food. Yes, it's fake cheese. Yes, there are probably healthier options. But if you want a quick sandwich that is pretty good and will fill you up, this is a good bet.",N11AGsSHMp9ZhOARSq8LNQ,6,4,4,OOjJKLnanpU1OQsKcYdnTg

It was about 9am and a sandwich sounded really good since I had been up since 6am and had not eaten breakfast.  I could now relax, I had a couple hours before departure, already checked in, went through TSA, etc etc!  I walked around the airport  area close to my terminal C first, but Jersey Mike's was definitely top of my list, I am very glad I came back.

Only 2 customers in front of me in line, and ordering seemed to go quickly.   I wanted something hot, so I got the Chipotle Steak sandwich.  They cooked the meat fresh right there too.  The guy who took my order was cool and friendly, he was also slicing the deli meats for other's sandwiches.  The girl at the register who I paid with was friendly and good customer service too.  I was having a pleasant morning :)

There are no tables/seating near Jersey Mike's, so I suggest you walk back towards Popeye's area, which is exactly what I did because I also wanted some Cajun fries to go with my sandwich ;)  There I found some empty tables/chairs, which was great because I did not want to eat near my terminal on a waiting seat!   At least I had my own table and was comfortable to take my time to enjoy my brekkie/early lunch.

The sandwich was GREAT, I really liked the soft white bread, Chipotle sauce flavor, and all the goodies in the sandwich. The meat was cut small, sauteed on the flat top grill, I think they put provolone cheese on it and wrapped it in foil, so it was all melty and still hot when I opened it.  It was a bit messy to eat, but I always carry Wet Ones with me and mini Bath & Body works hand sanitizer, it's important to keep your hands extra clean while traveling or anywhere eating out.  I enjoyed my sandwich and it definitely filled me up.  If I ever come across Jersey Mike's again, I would try a cold sandwich next time, more healthy choice.
