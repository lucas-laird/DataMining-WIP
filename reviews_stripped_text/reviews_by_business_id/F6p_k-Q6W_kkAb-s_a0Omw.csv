I was checking out the Town Center mall and decided to stop here for lunch based on the reviews.  The restaurant was very bright and airy and the employees were very friendly.  After taking a quick peek at the menu, I decided on:

Mixed Grill of Lamb Skewer and Falafel

While sitting at my table waiting for my food, one of the employees brought over plastic utensils and napkins.  I also noticed they have free wi-fi.  Shortly thereafter, my food arrived and looked fantastic.  The food runner asked if I wanted to try a harissa sauce and brought a small container when I said yes.

The food looked very good and I was pretty hungry so I dove right in.  Hummus is one of my favorite things and the pitas accompanying my meal were very fresh. Unfortunately the hummus was a little too smooth for me.  I know that hummus varies and the flavor was very good, but I like a little more consistency.  I'm sure others will prefer it this way and I'm in no way knocking the restaurant for it, just airing my preferences.

The salad was also very fresh and flavorful.  I like that the cucumbers were diced allowing them to pile more onto the plate.  The lamb was a bit tough and not very flavorful, but the harissa added a nice kick.  Contrary to some of the other reviews I skimmed over, I thought the falafels were very tasty.  I also liked the roasted vegetables laid over the cous cous to support the skewer and the falafels.  The cous cous itself was very fine, to which I'm not really accustomed.  It also was very light, so it had a tendency to fly all over the place when I was cutting my lamb.

Overall, I enjoyed the meal and the portions are very generous.  I'd definitely return and try a pita next time if I'm not as hungry.  The food was good, the employees are very friendly and the prices are reasonable.",K7vTmYHTnr0fjw807c8E2w,1,3,4,u8_5ODGPqdbXxDkSnszH4g

Instead of the usual thin sliced seasoned lamb meat budging out of the sandwich I got mostly filler and a few cube cut pieces of undercooked red in the middle pieces of no taste meat.

It does get a little crazy around lunch so be prepared for a little hectic-ness when waiting in line..they only have one register.  The service is pretty solid as you can tell the wait staff really cares about making sure the customers are happy.",ACZauHUxS5MXq7_RTDDppQ,3,1,3,HS8HMA6wB3RhJ3Ji6CWp2Q

Our party had ordered the braised lamb plate and chicken pita wrap. The flavors of the meat were great! Seasoned very well and both the lamb and chicken were extremely tender.

What fell flat for me was the hummus and pita bread. The pita bread was warmed a bit too much for my liking. With its charred edges the pita bread hardened up too much. I prefer the pita to be warm, soft, and fluffy. In turn, their pita was a bit flaky. 

The hummus was pureed a bit too much for my liking. It was more like a liquid than a paste like texture. Perhaps, hummus is made differently everywhere, I did not care for it too much.

Overall, the service was fast, the meats here were great flavor wise, however their accompanying star side dishes fell flat.",byro8NKHYBreKT0VmW6dUA,2,1,3,p5bjE7vn9euCI8ojZRmtbQ

I often times wonder how someone can mess up a sandwich or salad, but it happens. Pita wraps I have had in the past may have had meat that was too dry, or way too much hummus or sauce in it, or too much veggies and not enough meat. You get the picture. This was just right. The chicken was so moist and flavored perfectly. Their was a perfect balance of veggies and meat, and the veggie mix was seasoned perfectly and the amount of hummus was just right. I didn't think I'd be able to eat the whole thing because I usually can only manage half a pita of that size, but it was so good, I couldn't stop eating.

Ordered my food at around 15 till 1pm and got my food about 15 after 1pm. This was after everyone who ordered after me got there food. It's a Friday during lunch time and the place isn't that big so when they realized I was the only one sitting there for half an hour with no food they realized something was wrong. I appreciated that they were very apologetic about it and got me my food right away....30 minutes later.

I understand mistakes happen and I wasn't too peeved about it until I actually opened up my to go box to dig in. My fries were cold, and my Pita was literally just thrown together probably in a matter of seconds. The lamb chunks were huge and over cooked and the pita was falling apart after one bite. I said screw the pita after two bites and ate the $11 I paid for the four large chucks of overdone lamb and a veggies.

This Crazy Pita is tucked in the corner of the Town Square shopping center, across the way from Yard House. It's a very open and inviting space. The menu is posted on the wall behind the cashiers, and once you place your order and pay, they give you a number to place at your table where they will deliver your food. 

I ordered a chicken pita plate; it comes with a side of fries. My husband ordered a 2 skewer plate (one chicken, one beef), and once we received our dishes we began our feast. The pita bread is warm and soft, and the amount of chicken they give you is generous. They add a good helping of chopped veggies and some salad on top. My only concern with the pita was the meat and veggies were so juicy that it soaked my pita bread and made it difficult to eat towards the end. 

The french fries were shoe-string style, but they were just average as far as sides are concerned. Next time, I will pay the additional $0.99 to upgrade to another side. 

Will I be back to feast at this Crazy Pita? Yup, you bet! The food is excellent quality, the staff is friendly, and even though it's not the cheapest option in Town Square, it's certainly one of the most tasty!",d_DPeh-LX77efXj6fiMLhw,0,0,4,ALzoVg_G5XsUW5bzjX7CTQ

The lamb was decent but it was kind of frustrating to eat because the pieces were big round chunks instead of thin slices which would make eating much easier. Basically instead of getting a small bite of meat and pita, I had to chew on the whole ball of meat because it was hard  and tough. The fries were nice and crispy, but you can definitely tell it was the kind you can buy in the frozen section of the store. My meal was about $9-10 which would be okay if I wasn't still hungry afterwards. My friends were also still hungry and decided to get some dessert after to fill up their stomachs. I would probably go here again if I was really craving a pita and was not too hungry. If not, I just go to a different place.

Falafel bowl had only 2 flat flavorless falafels. Side tzikiki and hot sauce were mediocre. Price point is fine if the food had flavor.

I would change the fries that come with the pita. They are very basic and don't match the flavor quality of the pita. I think either some kind of seasoned fry would be good, with a bit more complexity.

Crazy Pita is Located in Town Square Shopping Mall on the Mandalay Bay Side of the Mall. Right Across from the I Heart Burgers Restaurant!

Before you Enter the Establishment, On Occasion, there may be a Worker Standing Outside the Doors, Handing Out Samples, and there is also an Outdoor Menu. 

The Establishment is Kept Very Clean, The Bathrooms are Only One Stall, but Again Very Clean! lol  There are Tables inside the Establishment, and I Believe Outdoor Seating as well...The Counter Persons are Very Well Mannered, Happy, and Friendly! If you didn't know what a Certain Item was, they would be Very Happy to Explain it to you, Like they did to Me! They Take your Order, Give You a Number & Ask You to Have a Seat while your Order is Being Made. As it is an Open Grill, You Can See How Your Order is Coming Along! 

The Food is Very Tasty.. I had the Shrimp Skewers, and it was a Tad Salty, but Very Good, the Couscous that the Shrimp Skewers were Laying on was Very Soft & Light! The Cucumber Feta Salad was also Very Fresh & Light! They also Add Hummus & some Hot Pita Bread to the Dish! Yummy...is all I gotta Say! 

**Again this is Based Solely on My First Visit to a Mediterranean Restaurant, I am Sure there are Others that May Be Just as Tasty as This One, but for a First Timer, I Really Enjoyed the Atmosphere here!

You order from the cashier and then you find a table and they bring your food to you.  They also clear your table, so it's kind of a combination of sit-down and self-serve.

I had never been here before so I wanted to browse the menu a bit, but it was slow when we went in so the cashier was just waiting on us to place our order. I felt a bit pressured and rushed so I just ordered the lamb pita with a side of French fries. I was expecting something like a gyro, where the meat is shaved or at least in thin slices, but it was actually kind of large chunks of meat in the pita, making it impossible to eat.  It was really delicious and the meat was tender, but with veggies and sauce spilling all over my hands, the table, my plate as I tried not to get whole giant chunks of meat in one bite, I ended up having to eat most of it with a fork and knife. I think smaller chunks of meat would have helped tremendously.

My friend ordered the combo skewers and she got chicken and steak. YUM!!!  This combo came with hummus, rice and veggies.  The beef was very flavorful and tender.  The chicken was good but just slightly on the dry side.

Overall, I really liked it and will definitely add this into my lunch rotation. Next time I want to try the beef patties!",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,1,1,4,dgi_N0tNyekwY80uxtnAzA

Crazy Pita's Felafel Pita had a twist to it because it had the unexpected additions of hummus and roasted peppers in the wrap. I'm still undecided whether I like this new take better than the classic version however. ;) What really stood out for me was how incredibly fresh the felafel was. It was warm, moist, and almost had the texture of a meatball. Not to be a Debbie Downer, but the fries that came with the meal were downright tiny (as in portion size)! What am I, a toddler? A girl's gotta eat! Overall though, the food was great.

The service was quite attentive, although I should add it was pretty empty inside. The restaurant was impeccable, cleanliness wise. For a meal for two, the bill came to around $21.

The hummus was hummus-y. Honestly, I don't know how to describe hummus, only to say that it was good. The only thing I didn't like were the vegetables. They were cooked fine, but they were missing some more flavor. I wish they had the same seasoning and char as the shrimp. I just dipped them in the hummus.

It took almost half an hour for our food to be ready, which I'm normally okay with if the quality and service is great. However, that was not the case. When I arrived to my car, I realized there was a huge leak from the bag. Upon opening my food, there was an excessive amount of ketchup splattered all over the center portion of the box, right under the pita. The ketchup completely doused the fries and got into my pita. So gross! I don't understand why they wouldn't just put the ketchup in a container? Or just give us packets? Also, there was no tzatziki (of course). Never going back :/",bD1Rl4Bitd7jdmmB-vhJbw,0,0,1,mM_NJ9l8dhp_XtiWneg8SA

I wish they would cut the meat I'm a bit smaller chunks so it's a bit easier to eat but either way it still taste good to me. The service is pretty decent too. So far my experience has been enjoyable and the food delicious in my opinion. The steak is cooked just right! I wish they would give a little more fries though it almost seems skimpy next to the Pita lol but I guess it's their way of not carb loading. I suggest they should do a rewards system :),ShPDBEGOPMTP3LyVT5nMqw,0,1,4,UAlJl2R1hVg6YUTRu2UVaQ

The chicken was juicy, tender and flavorful. The staff was friendly and pleasant.  We look forward to our next trip so we can try other dishes, and we highly recommend this restaurant !!",8lOiKeui8Y0D_Nk0V7M6Dw,0,0,4,biIC2d5YlxcCfkj2Bq4DKw

It's a shame cause we would eat here at this location more if it were not due to the service.,meRvDvEWtvDcHyJsgLbK9Q,0,0,2,F7g3mhRQe6qtzRcddlPavQ
