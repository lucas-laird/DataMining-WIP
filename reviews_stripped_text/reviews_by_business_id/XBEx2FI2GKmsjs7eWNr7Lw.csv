776699,2016-09-28,0,XBEx2FI2GKmsjs7eWNr7Lw,"This is my first time at Juice N Go. I loved the customer service, but I feel for a place that seems like it uses the most natural of ingredients, it doesn't taste completely natural to me. The taste isn't much different than tropical smoothy. It is overpriced considering they don't use the most natural of ingredients for the base of whatever you order.  If you want a place that uses most natural I would go to Nectar in downtown summerlin. 
I made my own juice, and when I make my own juice at juice bars I always get the same one. This one was the worst one I tried. I love the natural taste of the juice without sweetener added to it. I didn't read the sign correctly I'm guessing, but when I create my own juice I would assume nothing but what I ordered would be added to it. Im assuming they used a coconut water( not natural). To make my own small14-16 oz juice cost me $8 which is a ridiculous cost when its not all natural juice and you use coconut water to fill the cup. Again you can go to nectar and get a 32 oz cup of nothing but natural juice for $8. 
I also got a Acai bowl, like many others said it was soupy melted within 2 minuets ice like flavor. I paid extra for extra granola which I didn't seem to have much extra of. The granola is popcorn like. Again the bowl is un naturally sweetened somehow just like the juice really taking away the greatness from fresh juice and fresh fruit bowls. I have had much better fresher tasting bowls and juices at many other juice bars, if your a juice fanatic and really care about the quality of whats being put inside the bowls and juice, I wouldn't bother trying this place. But if your someone who is giving there first try to juicing and eating healthy or super busy on the go person def try this place, because this is better than the typical drive through.

I started this review over a month ago and I forgot to submit it!

So the first time I went I got a acai bowl loaded with fruit and granola...not sure if the granola has honey in it :( I forgot to ask. If you are vegan DON'T FORGET TO ASK because I'm not sure.

Anyway. I ordered the bowl and asked for it to be made with coconut milk instead of soy. They did it no problem.

Now here is the deal...it says alllllllll over there signs and even the guy that took the order said it too...it's cut and made to order so that's why it takes longer. Ok. well explain why ever time I have gotten a bowl there the fruit is frozen. It has not frost bite but it def has a SUPER THIN ice on it and it's hard to the bite.

I'm not bitching about fresh frozen fruit I eat it at home in my smoothies daily. I'm just saying it always surprises me to get the fruit this way when each time the guy says it's fresh cut. LOL!

The mango smoothie that I got hubby once there was super good. 

I really don't know how often I will make it this far Rainbow, even though I live on Rainbow these bowls are no out of the ordinary bowls that I can not stay at home and make with my Vitamix :)",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,2,1,3,yB3wwwOHhI2UxlISbljQ9g

Yet, somehow... still was able to finish that gigantic (large) acai bowl. I'd say that large container, was maybe a pint. give for take. Not a small portion. 

Topped with fresh fruit (strawberries, bananas, blueberries, and coconut shavings), to me, first thought... ""this is what i should eat after going to the gym huh..."" XD The Traditional Acai (Ah-sa-ee) bowl is made with organic acai, guarana (apparently rich in caffeine), strawberries, non-fat frozen yogurt blended w/ choice of apple juice, coconut milk, or soy milk. Topped with organic granola, coconut shavings, and either agave nectar or honey. 

The first one i had was topped with agave nectar, felt like the bowl, as a whole, lacked a little bit more of the sweetness (didnt know honey was an option, and suggested to friend, maybe honey would do better). The acai and the fruit was bright and refreshing but light. But with tons of organic granola (score!). It's almost a meal in its own

2nd time, i had went myself in search for ""breakfast"", went through the drive thru. Was told through intercom that they will be with me in just a minute... a minute later, i hear a voice off to the side while i was concentrating on the menu outside.. XD the guy walked up with a notepad to take my order LOL that was a surprise.. Judging by my first experience of the large, i thought the regular was maybe the same type of cup/bowl, but shorter. After i pulled up to the window, to my surprise, it was a regular cup size, and tall. Then i thought, DANG ! for $1 difference, should have gotten the large ! XD so worth it for large ;_; Cut fruits were topped with honey this time and presented nicely. I was wrong about the honey though. it adds a .. different flavor to it.. maybe not so good with honey. maybe next time ill ask for agave nectar again but a little more? 

Experience noted. Get Large instead of Regular.. the regular was finished by the time i got home.. and i only live like 10 minutes away. Err... Maybe ask for a little more granola too (love granola for some reason... XD om nom nom)",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,1,4,lf854lAUZySArY5KITpVLg

We ordered 2 large Acai Bowls, added extra toppings and for $3-4 extra received about 4 pineapples and 4 blueberries. I asked them if they could put my bowl in a larger cup rather than short change me on the other ingredients attempting to fit everything in the same size cup.

The HUGE acai bowl is my favorite thing here- it is blended and frothy at the bottom without being icy, and the granola and fruit on top make it similar to a parfait. The regular is like $7 while the large is only a dollar more- an $8 meal, which isn't bad considering all of the nutrition it packs!

Bonus star for stellar service! For my first purchase, I was allowed to try the large size bowl at the cost of the regular, which was much appreciated and worth it. Employees are friendly and upbeat, but the line does move really slowly.

EDIT: Dropping a star. Over the past year, quality has taken a nosedive. The acai bowls are now over blended to the point that they're a smoothie consistency, and a flavorless one at that.

Apparently very good.

They use fresh tasting fruit and the Acai smoothie/juice part is refreshing. I definitely recommend getting the larger size because it is way more worth the price.

- Lots of organics

- No preservatives

- KIDS EAT FREE EVERYDAY! (with a $9.99 purchase)

I was a first time visitor, going through their drive through. First of all, doesn't the name Juice N ""GO"" apply that they will be fast? Anyways, I pull up and before I can say anything the guy tells me to hang on for a sec. 10 minutes go by, and I finally say that I'm ready to order. I got no response still, and then someone came out of the inside and wrote down my order on a notepad. He didn't apologize or state why I wasn't ordering through the speaker, just asked me what I wanted. I thought it was a little weird. Then I pull up to the window. 10 more minutes go by and a different guy comes to the window and says ""I'm sorry we're understaffed today."" and walked away before I got the chance to say anything. So by now, it's been 20 minutes. No total on my order, no food, nothing. 10 more minutes go by. The guy who took my order finally comes to the window. I just simply asked to speak with the manager. He begins to say he was giving me my bagel for free and how ""we are not McDonald's."" I told him I could make a smoothie and clean my blender in under 3 minutes, how long did it really take him? He never answered that question. He also asked me if I wanted to cancel my order and I said no. I'm not sure why he said anything to me when the first thing I did was ask for the manager. During this, the guy behind me literally pulled out backwards and left the drive through, so I brought that up. He said ""that's fine,"" and presumed to walk away. Then he came back and said the manager ""didn't want to talk to me because they are too busy."" I had no words. I just asked for my total. He gave it to me and walked away without making any exchange. It was now 35 minutes later, I know this because I tweeted right when I got there, and the manager comes to the window. He says, ""You wanted to talk to me?"" I said, "" you didn't want to talk to me."" He says, ""well I apologize but we are not McDonald's and the bagel's on the house."" I told him I could pay the $2 I just wanted my food. He then asked ""do you want to cancel your order?"" I never implied this, I even told the other guy no. So I just said no. I brought up the guy leaving the drive through to him as well, and his exact words were ""I don't care."" at least the other guy said that's fine. Then the manager asked ME what my balance was. I said ""you tell me, I don't work here."" That must've been his last straw or something, because he then said he was refusing me service and told me not to come back, and shut and locked the drive through window. There was no signs about refusing anyone service, or any signs at all by the window. I was appalled. I literally waited 35-40 minutes to be rejected service. I was frustrated after 30 minutes, but I used no profanity. I even offered to still pay for the bagel. Apparently, the manager turns out to be the owner, and I think his son was the other guy I was dealing with. Don't go here.",pUKAjAaSMkxiJ1WCIFSsBQ,2,1,1,JaGNrf4bBlZdNV7UZ6_REg

We also ordered the Hot chicken with ranch on ciabatta bread with all the veggies. It came with a hand full of tortilla chips and the sandwich was so yummy.

PROS:
The menu contains lots of options for different bowls or you can customize your own which is the best thing about this place.

The drive thru makes ordering quick and easy.

They have tons of options on fruits, veggies, and toppings for your bowl.

The pricing is reasonable and portion is huge.

They carry dairy free milks.
 
CONS:
I cannot stand that most of their fruits come frozen on top.. it takes away from the freshness that a standard acai bowl should have.

Their granola could be better. I used to get the gluten free granola because it tastes better to me, but for some reason it's usually stale and hard to chew.

I tend to add ginger in my acai bowls, but whenever i pay the up charge, i feel like its not even worth it since i can barely taste ginger.",6BLLyZDiR0pb-h2E5qvLXw,1,0,3,zRUoaJHrZ4dBROj1bYjBxA

Which means blueberries, bananas, strawberries, coconut shavings with honey. The fruit is always fresh, & served atop the acai fat free yogurt blend, which is amazing.  I'm not a fan of any type of yogurt (frozen, regular, Greek, etc) but this acai yogurt blend definitely has my attention and is worth trying!  They have a regular size and a large size, for $1 more. The large is a generous portion and often I can't finish it all. 

The fruit smoothies are also awesome, again regular and large (+$1). This isn't order by numbers, all smoothies are customized. They give you options for the base liquid (juice or coconut water) as well as your fruit options. 

This place has a drive thru, which can be a narrow squeeze for big trucks. I believe they also have a walk up window to order from, so don't let your vehicle stop you from trying this place! Everything is made to order, so be prepared to wait a few minutes. But it's never taken too long, and the staff is always friendly.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,0,1,5,UFSw-jxSTL0iZ3g9PzAUiQ

Juice N Go offers food items as well. I remember many moons ago I ordered some sort of wrap or sandwich and it was very good (I can't remember the name of it, however).

The Acai Bowls are never going to be a bad idea, and the lemonade - heaven really... just heaven in your mouth. 

Personally it's a bit over priced for just to go but obviously I understand because it's more natural foods etc... and more often than not when it's lunch time the line gets incredibly long it seems and I've waited more  than 25 minutes here for food before. 

Occasionally you get surprised with ""complimentary"" chips or chocolate covered acai berries which is always a good treat and business tool they use ... makes people feel special when they use the word, complimentary haha..

I've only had the Acai (Ah-Sai-Ee) Bowl and they were nice enough to upgrade me to a large bowl for the price of a regular for my first visit. 

I don't know much about acai berries other than its suppose to be some ""superfood"" from South America and is a great antioxidant! I'll take acai berries over prunes any day! I believe they use Sambazon Acai Juice (the expensive purple one at costco) and freeze it then blend it for the base. It comes with 2 fruit toppings (plenty of choices), coconut shavings, honey or agave nectar, and granola. The regular is $6.99 (24oz) and large is $7.99 (32oz). The large could definitely replace a regular person's meal and regular for a smaller appetite. A regular may be more optimal because unless you can guzzle your bowl in 20 minutes or so it starts to turn into a berry soup. Maybe if it was more of a thick smoothie I would like it a bit more.

I ordered their traditional acai bowl regular sized (6.99). It had strawberries, berries, and banana with coconut shavings, granola, and your choice of honey or agave nectar. I did the agave nectar. It satisfied my craving for sure! Delicious in every bite! However, I did expect it to be like a regular acai bowl which is usually thicker in consistency, but it is more runnier. Either way I managed and I enjoyed it anyway.

I also ordered a chicken quesadilla on a wheat tortilla (4.99) since I needed actual food in my stomach as well. That wasn't as great either, and now I know that you'd prefer to order their specialty beverages and smoothies here rather than their food.

Their wait is a bit long, but they were nice enough to forewarn you that everything is made to order so the wait might be a bit longer than most places. So I understood.

I love when places use fresh, quality ingredients in whatever they're making... I stopped by to grab a mango-banana smoothie. Initially, I really didn't expect much from this place. I thought -- ""how could a place so small produce good smoothies and acai bowls?"" They proved my initial thought wrong.

The set-up is much like Dutch Bros. Coffee on the Eastside, where you have two options on how to order: walk-up or drive-thru. It may take a little while to get what you ordered, but that's okay because the fruit smoothies and acai bowls are worth the wait! My mango-banana smoothie wasn't made from a flavored powder mix and it wasn't watered down, either. It actually tasted like the fruits I ordered for my smoothie, and that's what I like most about this place -- they give us what Mother Nature intended fruits to taste like. 

On a separate occasion, I ordered myself an acai bowl to hold off my midday snack cravings. I ordered the traditional acai bowl, and asked them if they could add mango (upcharge of 99¬¢), and they gladly accommodated!

The apple juice as a base gave it more of a tart flavor, but it was balanced well with the sweetness of the fruits and honey. The coconut shavings and the crunchy granola gave it a good texture. Overall, their acai bowls are really refreshing and are the perfect thing to snack on when you have down time. I'm not an acai bowl aficionado but from my own judgment, the acai bowl I got here was great!

There's not much going on in the shopping plaza it's located in, but it's definitely worth a try for those fresh fruit fanatics.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,8,8,4,j2tqOg9QPKJmLW-Wuf22SQ

Sambazon makes a freeze dried acai powder that I always have in my fridge and I add it to yogurt and smoothies at home.  So, when I heard of Acai Bowls at local places around town, I was determined to see if what they offered was better than what I make at home.

I have driven by this place many times so finally today I went to the drive-thru.  The wait was like 20 minutes. But the staff did come out and apologize and offered a student discount...since I'm not a student I did get a military discount of 10 percent off the $6.99 small ""bowl"".

You pick your own fruit and it was a long list of great tropical fruits to choose from so I picked berries, coconut and honey.  Granola and frozen Acai was added.  For me I wasn't crazy about the icy cold acai, I guess because I compare it to my own home version where I use yogurt. 

There are other smoothie drinks to choose from and you really have to be creative because you have to put it together by choosing all the ingredients yourself.

If the wait wasn't so long I would consider coming back to try out other items.

My go to item is their Traditional [Coconut Shaving, Strawberries, Blueberries, Banana, and Granola (Granola have Almonds for those with allergies)] 1/2 Acai Bowl, 1/2 Pitaya Bowl with Whey Protein and no extra sweetener.  The bowls are loaded with natural sugar, so you don't need any extra calories from simple sugar/agave.  

Aca√≠ is rich in antioxidants, so by adding Pitaya (Dragon Fruit) not only thicken the bowl but it also upsurge your fiber intake.  And it's freaking delicious too.

For a large bowl its roughly about ~400cal according to their math they did on the spot.  Trim it down more by subbing Coconut Water instead of Apple Juice (organic) as the base, or even omitting the Frozen Yogurt.

I called my order in to avoid waiting, and sure enough, my order was ready when I arrived. The employee that helped me was super friendly too. 

Everything here is made fresh to order, so you WILL wait if you do not call your order in. You can't have your cake and eat it too, if you are impatient and don't want to wait, order ahead. 

I got a regular acai bowl with bananas and blueberries, made with soy milk. (Actually, I got two, my  co-worker wanted to give it a try as well).  It was delicious, my only complaint is that it was a little runnier than I would like, but that may have been due to driving 15 minutes before eating it. It was also surprisingly filling!

After feeling very excited and anxious to try a bowl,  I was leery and wondered if I could actually find such healthy goodness in Las Vegas.  It seems as if many of our favorite healthy food places don't last long here in the valley.  After Googling, Yelping and searching high and low for a place to find a good Acia Bowl I found Juice 'N' Go.  It wasn't close to the house but beggars can't be choosers.  The next day we set out for Rainbow to try this bowl that my brother swore by.

My husband and I got different variations of the Acia Bowls.  It took awhile to get our order but we didn't care because this food is fresh people, and made to order.  After one bite, we were hooked.  The fruit is delicious and fresh and PRETTY, the value is phenomenal and the people that work there are so freaking nice and friendly.  Juice 'N' Go Acia Bowls have become a part of our lives on a weekly basis and sometimes more.  We've had bowls for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  We dream of that yummy goodness and have withdrawals if too much time lapses between visits.  Oh, and we've also tried the chicken salad, bagels and smoothies.  Everything is awesome!

Location: It's a bit of a strange set up in the middle of a shopping center parking lot with a walk up window or drive-thru option.  We opted for the drive-thru since we were going to eat in the car anyway. (No seating)

Service: EXCELLENT! We ordered a large acai bowl and an iced green tea, but the guy said they just got rid of their green tea and suggested their tropical one instead.  Ordered it and thought nothing of it. Pulled up to the window and got our stuff, but the guy said he charged me a regular and gave us the tea at no charge!!! Said he was sorry they didn't have the green tea. Totally didn't have to do that but just shows the kind of business they run and how they care about their customers. 

Bowl: Definitely tasty and filling although a bit more watery than I like. Was almost a smoothie with granola, bananas and strawberry on top.

After a morning hike through Fletcher Canyon, an acai bowl on my way back to the strip sounded like the perfect plan. I was super excited to find nearby Juice'N'Go - over 4 stars and super close to my hotel? Amazing!

Juice'N'Go is drive thru/car service only. The employee at the window was very nice, and I took his recommendation of the traditional acai bowl. They have a promotion for 1st timers - free upgrade to a large, nice! Once ordered and paid, I was instructed to pull around to their side stairs where another employee promptly brought out my bowl to my car.

The bowl looked great. They have great packaging, including a labeled cup, lid, spoon, and napkins.  Too bad the flavors didn't stand up though - it definitely looked better than it tasted! The acai blend was so watery and melted to a drippy juice consistency in under 5 minutes. Though the toppings were plenty, the banana slices were so tart and unripe. I ended up throwing away about half of the bowl because it became so unappetizing. 

Juice'N'Go was sadly one of my worst acai bowls ever - Yelp totally got it wrong this time. With their proximity to the strip, I would have happily made this a regular stop on my LV trips had it been good.

(just down the street from school and is my usual stop if I'm feeling like I need a healthy 'pick me up' before I hit the books)

The Acai Bowl is amazing. It's sort of got a slushy-like consistency to it and you can choose what to blend it with (coconut milk, apple juice, soy milk). They top it off with berries and bananas (plus whatever fruit you want to add to it), organic granola, coconut shavings, and some kind of sweetener. I always just get honey (but there's also agave) I've only ever ordered a 'regular' sized bowl because the large just looks WAY too big for me and the 'regular' already gets me pretty full. 

I've seen on other people's reviews that the acai slush isn't sweet enough but c'mon people, its natural and it isn't pumped with preservatives and additives. I would hate for it to be too sweet. I think it's perfect the way it is, but that's just my take on it. Also, I've heard that there can be a bit of a wait but I don't think i've ever waited for more than 5-10 minutes, so maybe I just beat the crowd? or am there before? Either way, no complaints here!

I got the large Acai bowl (normally $7.99)  with coconut milk, banana, mixed berries, coconut shavings, granola & honey~ That thing is HUGE.. like the size of a large soup to-go container haha It was delicious! Some of the fruit were frozen and some fresh so if you have sensitive teeth it may be too cold for you but if you let it sit a while you should be good to go~ The best way I can describe it is it's kind of like an acai/yogurt smoothie with fruits and granola haha I can't wait to come back and try all the other delicious sounding items on the menu.
The chef told me they are the greenest restaurant in Las Vegas so they don't use any paper products even paper to-go menus. They also have a walk up window and plan on soon building a little out door dining area. Juice 'N' Go makes eating healthy fast, convenient & easy.. Definitely check this place out ;]]]

But in the end it went in our favor. The worker took our order and apologized to us saying it may take awhile to get ready. We weren't in a rush so we were willing to wait since it was our first time trying out an Acai Bowl. 

We ordered a Large Acai Bowl ($7.99) and the worker said he would give it to us for the regular price ($6.99) since it was our first time. Turns out it took about 20+ mins to finally get our order. But in the end he gave us 2 Large Acai Bowls for free :)

Lets just say my boyfriend and I were stoked!!! And the Acai Bowls were even more AMAZING!!!! Best thing I've ever had in such a long time! It was refreshing and just the thing I wanted on a hot Vegas day!!!

I want to give a big, ""THANK YOU!"" to the sweet workers here :) Keep up what you guys are doing!!!",x_tSBRi1agHBSAi4ADrpxQ,2,5,5,LrXgDGMZdCFUrFKXyN79Qg
4995630,2014-04-10,0,XBEx2FI2GKmsjs7eWNr7Lw,"Got to this little box on the corner of a shopping plaza at around 3pm on a Wednesday afternoon. No long lines as mentioned in the other reviews. However we have made attempts before and the line gets pretty ridiculous for an establishment where you can either drive up or walk up to the window for your order. You can call in your order too but I wouldn't do that the yogurt melts pretty fast. The other reviews talked about how long it takes, I think it's well worth the wait, I think they only slice up the fruits when it is ordered hence the uber freshness . I don't think they are pre sliced and sitting in a tub wilting. 
My 8 year old daughter placed her order first and ordered the breakfast parfait. The guy helping us told us that it would be too much for her since it was 20 oz and that we could order her  a similar item on the kids menu. Wow! Honesty so rare now a days that breakfast parfait was about $6 and the kids menu is 1.99. The kids items are the same size as Jamba Juice's kids items but WAAAaaaaaay cheaper. So she ordered a kid's yogurt and customized it with strawberries bananas and granola. I got the regular size yogurt customized it with strawberries, bananas, mango, granola and peanut butter. My boyfriend got the famous Acai bowl and my son got the kids' chocolate smoothie. All that for $14 we got the smoothie for free for no reason Yay! 
The yogurt was not dense and tart like most yogurt. It was sweet and very ice cream like. The fruits were all firm and tasty, I don't know what brand granola or peanut butter they use but it was super delish and very different from anything I've tasted. I love that you can customize your bowls and that they have lots to chose from. I added peanut butter as an afterthought and while I was waiting I was worried how the mango and peanut butter would taste mixed together. I was also worried when I saw that the peanut butter was not blended with the yogurt it was placed on top. 
We are regulars at Jamba Juice and yogurtland  and it takes us awhile to consume our yogurt bowls and smoothies but with Juice n Go items, we went through it pretty quick. My son killed his smoothie just from the walk from their window to our car. We were all done within our treats in less than 5 mins. Take a look around the parking lot and you see everyone leaning on their vehicle handling their yogurt/ fruit bowls .",7eXW0KClU3J1ehd-QHO3Sg,0,0,5,JBpRFlq2-bpKD-DJx_pTaQ

It truly is the best in town. I definitely suggest the traditional for a first timer. 

I highly recommend the Pitaya bowl. I'm telling you.. it's just HOT PINK goodness. If you're truly indecisive of what to get, I definitely recommend half acai/half pitaya bowl. They make their entire menu to the best quality. Prices are reasonable, healthy is not so cheap nowadays.

The customer service is top-of-the-line. They've thrown a few discounts and samples here and there. On one of my visits, it was a windy out. I found a piece of animal hair on top of my bowl. I did return it and they did not hesitate to make a new one. They also gave me a free bowl for my following visit. I'm a winner.

5167298,2014-05-29,5,XBEx2FI2GKmsjs7eWNr7Lw,"Unfortunately my last experience has really changed my mind about returning to this business. I was an incredibly loyal customer but now I will not be going back. 
   I was encouraged by their employees to download their Epoxy app. which acts as a stamp card giving you credit for purchases and then leads up to them offering you a free purchase once all of the required amount of stamps are collected. 
   Today I purchased a large acai bowl with mixed nuts (which is an extra charge), I large smoothie with a .99 additional ingredient, a bagel and cream cheese and a child's smoothie and peanut butter sandwich. It is advertised that kids eat free always with full purchases and that is very generous. However, I paid full price for all my other items which came out to over $20. When I presented the stamp card I was told I am not entitled to a stamp for any of my purchases due to the child's meal being ""on the house"" and that I can't receive ""two offers at once"". I was not redeeming my stamp card, I was simply requesting a stamp for the purchases I paid full price for. Also, I was never informed nor is it posted anywhere that I will not receive a stamp if kid's items are part of my purchase. Also, the ""kids eat free"" is permanently on the menu so I don't understand how that's a special offer.
  When talking to the owner regarding the situation he told me ""I'm the only one in town who is this generous.. This is as good as it gets."" I was really shocked at his attitude. I have brought him business, referred so many of my friends, written positive reviews in the past and gone out of my way to check in on social media. 
  If you are going to have a loyalty card program... Shouldn't you be rewarding those customers who are in fact, LOYAL? I wasn't asking for anything special.. Merely a stamp on a virtual card for items I paid full price for. If you have limitations- post them clearly, verbalize them to your customers and please don't allow your ego to destroy a great customer relationship. I regret to say I won't be back.

I roll down my window to place my order at the second window because their speaker wasn't working. The drive through window was awkwardly high. I drive an SAV and the window was still too high. You'd need to drive a semi. A strong smell of grease was in the air. I'm not sure if it's coming from the pupusas place next door but it was 8:30am and the pupusas place wasn't open yet.

I got the Traditional Acai Bowl with pineapples and protein. I asked if the pineapples were fresh or from a can and what kind of protein they use. The pineapples are frozen and shipped from California. The protein powder is flavorless because it sells more. Each topping/add-on is $1 extra. 

The service was pleasant. I was told they took a $1 off my purchase but didn't tell me why. I was the first customer of the day but had to wait at least 15 minutes for my order.

My acai bowl was very soupy I couldn't eat it in my car without making a mess. I had to use a straw and then scoop up the granola and fruits with a spoon. The granola was soggy and overall, the flavor was lacking.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,7,3,2,pfGpOrwmUig0xymsWiKB_g
5349086,2014-01-07,2,XBEx2FI2GKmsjs7eWNr7Lw,"My boyfriend and I decided to try Juice 'N' Go the other day and I gotta say, this place is hard to miss due to the bright colors of its building compared to their neighbors. It's a pretty small place, in fact, I think they could even turn this into a food truck deal if they didn't want to have an actual location. 

They have a drive thru area as well as a walk up area. I actually didn't notice their drive thru so I went ahead and walked up instead. They have a pretty good amount of items on their menus ranging from wraps to smoothies to, of course, their famous acai bowl that everyone rages about. 

So since their most known item is the acai bowl then that is what I ordered. I decided to go with a regular sized acai bowl. The guy that took my order down asked me if I had wanted a traditional acai bowl. I wasn't really sure what he meant ... so I asked. He said that I could customize it with what I liked. I didn't really know that I had the utmost freedom until I read the reviews more closely AFTER my visit so instead, I subbed two items. 

Their traditional bowl had bananas, strawberries, blueberries, honey, and coconut shavings topped with honey I believe. So instead of the bananas and coconut shavings, I wanted mangos and raspberry. Then on top of that, because I was a first time customer, they upgraded my regular to a large -- which was very generous of them. 

The wait was ... sort of long for something that doesn't typically take a long time to make. Then again I've never made these types of things so I actually wouldn't really know. But they also had some drive thrus coming through so maybe it was that too...

And he came out with a traditional acai bowl. Huh? Haha he said that his mind sometimes is too busy and completely forgets. So he made a traditional acai bowl instead of the customized one I had ordered. He gave us the traditional one on top of re-making my order so I walked away with two large acai bowls! It was my lucky day! 

Anyways, though maybe because I didn't want the bananas, my acai bowl didn't look as filled as the original. And the blueberries were missing :( Or perhaps because I got two that he didn't fill up my bowl? Who knows. 

The flavors of the acai were a little bland than what I expected it to be. Granted I'm not very familiar with the acai flavor but the one in the bowl was sort of ... watery. It was runny as well. Perhaps they need to put more frozen yogurt to thicken it up? I love the granola mix in it though. It goes very well with the fruit. The bowl wasn't really sweet either which is a plus -- it was very refreshing and can be really filling too. My boyfriend didn't want to have any so I got stuck with a whole bowl on my own ;(

So it may have been average at most for me but the service is amazing from what I have experienced so far. Can be a bit slow but eh, I had time. I definitely do want to go back to try more things and perhaps try another bowl and this time, I'll be a little smarter on the ordering :)",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,1,4,qCTrKBU23jOOCbDkcPYFsA

almond milk. Then granola reminds me of rice crispies and wish they didn't melt so fast when you don't eat it fast enough to get the crunch. I used to love getting their sorbet since it didn't melt as fast, but they took it off the menu. 

I have tried their customize your own wrap and tried their peanut butter bagel. When you order a wrap they come with tortilla chips, but kind of odd since you wish you could get a side of salsa to with it.

5620304,2013-02-15,9,XBEx2FI2GKmsjs7eWNr7Lw,"Wow, I haven't given five stars out in a while, but this place totally deserves it, IMHO.  After popping up in the ""New Businesses In Las Vegas"" section and checking out the menu online and seeing they had acai bowls, I knew I had to check it out.  My first experience with these was at Swami's Cafe in San Diego and I've been hooked ever since.  Juice 'N' Go is located in the drive-thru hut at Rainbow and Oakey that used to be a Baskin-Robbins back in the day and then a hot dog place in its last incarnation.  I'm happy to report that the newest tenant is a welcome addition to this side of town. 
      I did a walk-up transaction, having left my car for an oil change down the street. I rung the doorbell and rather than help me through the customer window, Alex, the owner dressed like a chef, came out of the little hut and took my order.  Their standard acai bowl ingredients are organic acai puree, guarana, strawberries, non-fat frozen yogurt, coconut shavings, and granola.  In addition to that list of ingredients,  customers can then choose two more kinds of fruit; apple juice, coconut milk, or soy milk; and either agave nectar or honey.  My head was kind of spinning with the add-in choices so I just asked Alex what he suggested and he said to go with bananas, blueberries, coconut milk, and honey, so that's what I did.  I ordered the smaller 24 oz. size, paid my money, and Alex offered to deliver it to my car.  I told him I was on foot and he disappeared into the juice hut to make my bowl.  He reappeared to offer me the larger 32 oz. version for the 24 oz. price--who's gonna turn that down?  Not me.  Minutes later, he came out and presented me with today's breakfast and it was fabulous.  All of those fresh, organic ingredients blended together deliciously well.  
     There are lots of other things on the menu that I will definitely go back to try, especially with customizing orders.  Check out their menu ahead of time if you want to save time in the drive-thru and you can even call in your order.  This is a place that offers organic, healthy options (no HFCS) and is environmentally conscious, too--no paper menus available, they use earth-friendly cups, etc.  
     **Because I was taking pictures of my order, Alex told me that he gives deals if you check in on Facebook or use Instagram.  Since I was doing neither, I told him I was Yelping and he told me that he will upsize the same way for you if you tell him you heard about him from Terri the Yelper.  Give his place a try and see for yourself.

Room for improvement: I wish it had more granola and the pitaya blend was rather watery. Besides these points, would recommend and I am happy to try them again.",PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A,0,0,4,_wD7wJ4evCy6ezM92dy0GA

In fact, most times I ordered my acai bowl, they would upgrade it to a large and even give a free smoothie to my son. Now, there are new people working who are definitely not as accommodating and friendly, the bowls aren't as fresh, and there have been no upgrades at all. I used to feel like a special customer and appreciated. I still enjoy the bowls, although because of the long waits in line, the bowls are soupy and melted. Even when calling in an order, you still have to wait for all the cars in front to pick up your order. I miss the old juice n go!!",T6wxQerOUwd4JmRTXBOuog,0,0,3,G-z2Ny9UnQFXkCJVqFRGFQ

  They're customer service is great and for a lil walk up and drive thru place it's great.
   They even give you beef jerky for your dogs.
   I plan on visiting this place a lot more so I can try some of the other things on the menu.",TQifqbmeO0Zc0Pg6jqZdsg,0,1,5,0wrE62ZTqovQgR6MEtaKoA
5753467,2013-03-02,0,XBEx2FI2GKmsjs7eWNr7Lw,This place is amazing. Healthy organic and delicious. Came here to beacause someone recomended me this place and let me start by sayimg that this place is a must go to if you are looking for healthy delicious place to eat. Unlike places clamimg to have healthy food and unhealthy food in their place. This place screams healthy. The fruit is cut up to order the fruit smoothies acai bowls are amazing. This juice n go is great we deffenitly need more around las vegas. I had a chicken wheat wrap which was one of the best wraps I have had in a really long time. I also tried the acai bowl with banana and mango which was great. Its almost like a parfait but instead of yogurt its a acai berry smoothie. Bit they also have regular parfaits. The customer service experience of this place is great also i parked my car and walked up to the window and aftwr ordering the owner of the place asked me which car was mine and he qould glady bring the order rite out to my car which i thought was very cool and generous . this place gets 5stars and deserves the 5stars for good food and good customer service experience.

I love the service here and the care that they put into each and every order. My favorite drink is the lemon-limeade because as the days get hotter here what's better than some ice cold lemonade! My favorite food here is the quesadillas! They have 3 choices of cheese and a few meats to choose from! Overall a great place to go,SlCXIWAYwL_itoM_gHuzQw,0,0,5,0FZW665jtUeVa_Nej6h_gA
5813540,2016-12-18,0,XBEx2FI2GKmsjs7eWNr7Lw,"I'm from hawaii where there are Acai bars everywhere! This place, BY FAR, has the worst acai bowls I've ever had. It's like, slush. It's not thick and creamy like I've always had. I don't mind that it's not sweet; because that's what the agave is for. But it was like they blended 1 acai smoothie pack with a bucket of ice. I just don't understand how it came out this way. I also don't understand how they have rave reviews about their bowls. It was DEFINITELY not great. =\",nl2o0kovLXXU1faZ9H-xYg,0,0,2,LkMC-ufm1ryW6MvJETaKnQ

Wow, such a treat and a great meal that leaves me full and happy inside. 

I am truly a fan and am excited to try more of their fantastic looking menu items!. I really think the staff is Awesome as well. This is for sure one of my new favorite finds in all of the valley!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,7,7,5,GNnxoVc5GygqV1Lt9-NV2Q

5959455,2014-08-23,6,XBEx2FI2GKmsjs7eWNr7Lw,"I am no expert, but the acai bowl I had here was refreshing, filling and tasty. Driving around the area during lunch and looking for something a little out of the ordinary I decided to give Juice n Go a chance. 

I arrived around 1230 and they were not usually at all. I went through the drive thru and decided on the large acai bowl since there is only a $1.00 different between the regular size and the large. 

I was surprised by how large the serving was. Lots of fruit and very fresh and filling. I wasn't sure the acai bowl would be enough for lunch, but it was the perfect serving. 

I can clearly make something this simple at home on my own, but let's be honest, I will be back when I'm in the area again. Yes, I am that lazy.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,7,8,4,CqsMImbI8jCMq41heklg9w
5973494,2013-03-06,2,XBEx2FI2GKmsjs7eWNr7Lw,"Often I am craving something fruity and healthy and delicious. But I often have the 2 kiddos with me and just the thought of getting them dressed, and in & out of their carseat, bribing them with toys/ candy so they behave- already tires me out. Juice 'N' Go is the answer to my prayers. I just wish it was closer to where I live. But beggars can't be choosers. 

 The Acai Bowl may be my new addiction. I stopped by for the first time yesterday and had to swing by again today because one bowl just wasn't enough. It's a good thing that I just happened to be in the area both times. Owner Alex said that he also ate it practically every day while in San Diego which is why he had to bring this little shack to sin city. And I am so glad he did. 

The large bowl ($7.99) is huge and comes with your choice of fruits and other toppings. I love the traditional flavors of strawberries, bananas, blueberries, shaved coconut, and honey. I don't know if it really has all of the health benefits that this ""superfood"" Acai berry claims to have, but I do know that it is dang good. 

I also have tried the smoothies and was pleasantly surprised to learn that when you spend $10, you get a free kids smoothie too. So luckily my kids got to try the strawberry banana smoothie too. And the verdict: they love it. 

When you go up to the drive thru, Alex comes out to take your order and gives recommendations if you are overwhelmed by all of the delicious choices listed on the menu board. You then drive up to the pick up window and pay. Since everything is made to order, there is a bit of a wait. Just turn off your engine and catch up on Yelp Talk. Note, if you find yourself without a car, you can also walk up and order too. 

Can't wait to try other juices...and a wrap...and the soup...basically the entire menu. In fact, I may just be in the neighborhood again tomorrow. Besides delicious and healthy food, the friendly service is top notch!",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,5,6,5,-Arfoeli8FMTA_PzpfQuNg

I went with the traditional acai bowl with almond milk and he even upgraded to a large for free since it was my first time.  It was so good!!!!!! If this place was close to home I would literally go everyday. So impressed! Can't wait to go back! Support local!!!,GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,2,2,5,xH92qDUrxcNrXWLkDKJsEg
