We tried the coleslaw, rice, fries and yuca fries and all where good with the beans and fries being my favorites. 

They are a little unorganized at the counter and some items aren't being served that are in the menu but I'm sure once they get established things will run more smoothly. Overall a great place to get some good chicken!",c5tvQ7RYTYd8BQ1VMqVqNw,2,1,4,VhaE-Ciq1WER9X6qrP3B4Q

The yuca sticks were good. The empanadas were delish! It was all around just really good, really fresh ""fast food"" I think this place is actually better than some of its competitors but.. that's just my opinion. Some of the workers weren't so friendly, but some were quite friendly, so it worked out. They actually serve you and pick up your plates when you're done, so it's fancy fast food. Will definitely be back for some of that delish chicken.",FTjIHMSeXJDRTO0QHOoTiw,0,0,4,w9TkafImrtaAlcZ9_YFvnA

The sauce was a little sweet too.  But the chicken was a hit with my family and that empanada was to die for I bought one just to taste made me want to turn around and get more! The Sauce was amazing. Gooey hot cheese and the chicken was flavorful. Light and flaky crust.,jSglBrvPsFS2z1JBgBk7Mw,0,0,5,FGXAWPeh-ZjHLtxBKVjilg

I went for the first time last week to try it out and was so disappointed when they were out of the citrus grilled chicken at about 8:00pm in the evening. Went again just tonight with my family at 7:00pm and again they were saying they were completely out of the citrus grilled chicken again!!!  How do you run out of your signature item during the peak of dinner time for customers??? Seriously? This is the sign of a very poorly run establishment. I probably will not go back again.

I was impressed with the quality of food and flavors. I got the 2 piece leg and thigh, one fried and one grilled, just to try the options. Both were very good but the grill chicken was delicious. I also got the Campero rice, a side of the campero beans and the empanada. The empanada was so good and creamy. The beans and rice were very good too. I decided to eat in there and they served my food on a real plate and brought it to my table. The staff is nice.

3082128,2018-01-14,3,O1aOpTSYbHmyV_712z5fsQ,"Pollo Campero has delicious grilled chicken!

On my first visit, my husband and I ordered grilled chicken, plantains, sweet corn salad and empanadas. The chicken pieces were decent sized and full of flavor. I don't know what type of spices they use but the taste is fresh and citrus-y. 

On our second visit we ordered an 8 piece combo that included mostly grilled with a couple of fried. We also had plantains and beans. The fried chicken was juicy but no where near as flavorful as the grilled. 

The first two visits were dine in visits and every visit after has been to-go. 
From our visits we have determined we will only order grilled chicken and to only order it to-go.  There have also been a few issues with trying to place our order as there is sometimes a language barrier; however, someone usually appears quickly to recover the situation.



Enjoy... the grilled chicken!",KGQZvfuthc12iq7p_VzX-w,7,4,4,cPPBDyXMZLgyDCz6eUWepA

The boyfriend and I got the 8 piece chicken family meal and it came with two sides. Decided on half grilled and half fried chicken. With a side of french fries and rice. 
Grilled chicken had a wonderful char and lots of seasoning to it. The fried chicken on the other hand did not and was not as crispy as we would of liked it to be. We also tried the empanadas, and honestly, I spit it out. It was horrible! 

Staff was beyond friendly and place was very neat and clean inside. Wouldn't mind going back, just not any time soon.",SoiacX2r2mvHqIh3GgRMUw,9,11,3,509V1Qf9M9T_sm_1mMnVRA

It reminds me of the chicken in my mom's hometown in the Dominican Republic. I also get the sweet plantains, I'm Caribbean I need my platanos maduro.  Don't forget to request their Pollo Campero sauce! It Is So GOOD! If you dine in it's almost like you are at a RESTAURANT and not a ""fast food"" joint.  They bring your order to the table in BEAUTIFUL porcelain plates & they also clean up after you. The employees have always been friendly with me & provide great customer service. I always leave a tip even though it is not a traditional practice with fast food place. Their drive through is pretty quick. The only reason why I don't rate them a 5 is because if you order food a little later in the evening it doesn't taste as fresh or juicy. Other than that it's a must TRY!

3340778,2017-12-28,0,O1aOpTSYbHmyV_712z5fsQ,"I loved my first time here. I had the 3 price grilled meal with street corn salad , dinner roll and soda for $9.41 including tax .
The only item I didn't like was the dinner roll .  I chose this option over tortillas and I regretted it .
Not only was the dinner roll not tasty but they don't have butter or honey to serve with it . Next time I will stick to the tortillas.
Everything else was GREAT! The grilled chicken had a citrus lime flavor and tasted like it just came off the grill . This grilled chicken has a much better flavor than the other chicken places (you know who I'm talking about.)
The street corn salad is also a must have item . If you want another side -do yourself a favor and get an extra side of this corn salad in addition to the other side that you may think you want.
I was also impressed that the food was served on a real plate instead of plastic or paper.
The restaurant seemed clean and the employees were happy but productive. 
I don't have this chain in my neighborhood, but I will gladly make the trip to this side of town to eat here again .",ats8qvpIrTawAhgXmDUg8w,2,0,4,XWxaSm8zS3RhIWKecSdlSw

4395528,2017-11-03,14,O1aOpTSYbHmyV_712z5fsQ,"Pros:
- Grilled chicken tastes amazing!! They have the option of grilled or fried. They automatically give you fried, unless specified. We asked for half and half to taste both. Grilled had the most amazing citrus, herbaceous flavors. Soo good, you don't need any sauce! Fried chicken tasted like normal fried chicken. 
- Empanadas! We got the trio and all of them were delicious. Gooey cheese, meat, and their respective sauces. The empanada was warm and flakey. Doesn't get any better than this! 

Cons:
- Sides are meh. We got rice and street corn salad. The rice was bland. The street corn salad was very herby and had this green bean that tasted like a lima bean. There wasn't much corn. The flavors were good, but the texture wasn't to my liking. 
- Flan is meh. We got that for dessert because the picture looked amazing, but what we got was store bought flan. 
- Sauces.  We were so excited to try the pesto and creamy cilantro, but they didn't have it. They didn't have 4 out of the 6 sauces.. We tried Chipotle Honey Mustard and Campero sauce, but they tasted like regular honey mustard and thousand island dressing. So we ended up not using either since it took away from the taste of the chicken.

End story: skip the sides and buy the grilled chicken only with a side of empanadas!",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,19,15,3,Ok4PV_9LpEMJA8lbDYcrXA

I ordered only the grilled chicken, no sides. I asked the girl at the window to check it before I leave, she did.
The Chicken was so flavorful and delicious Im certain I'll be bringing that home again. Ive had a few of the sides and they are ok but we really liked the chicken the best.
