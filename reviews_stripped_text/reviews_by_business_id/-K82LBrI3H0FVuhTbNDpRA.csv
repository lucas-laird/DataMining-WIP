141618,2013-02-04,2,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"Since I am a fan of Bachi Burger i was really excited to check out there ramen place.  1st...I thought the server was great!  She asked if it was our first time and went over the menu with us.  Since it was busy at the time i thought i was really great to take her time with us when normally they would just take your order and run.  She warned us that the ramen can be very salty and if that would be okay.  Since we both like our food on the saltier side we thought it would be fine.  we order the miso ramen and the spicy ramen.  I have to say presentation was excellent for the miso ramen.  best i've seen in vegas. Sorry, I did not take a picture, I'm sure there is one already posted.  Based on the presentation we were even more excited to taste it.  Initial taste was that the miso ramen was tasty and the spicy ramen had a really good flavor.  Now here's the bad news...after about 3-4 spoonfuls of broth it began to feel like i was slurping straight salt.  Remember i am heavy on the salt kinda person, but this was way too much.  I could not eat anymore.  I told the waitress she was right about the salt and she recommended hot water to add on the side.  Hot water???  I don't think i should have to adjust the ramen with hot water.  She told me that the broth had to be that way.  What!???  I don't know why it wold have to be that salty, but whatever. =)
Because the spicy miso was tasty we might give it another try with...""hot water"" on the side, but will see.  Also, the broth was not hot enough.  Luke warm.  i was told to ask next time if i wanted it hotter.    Overall, i might it another try since i have not seen a review on it being too salty...maybe it was a bad day. =)...second chance coming soon.",_O34OQgnyeJ-9w3VnjDR1Q,3,3,3,Lr3CAe6n3AEohj7UH_pp2Q

Too bad it's too far from my house, hence why  they need to open one in Summerlin.  The broth, chasiu, and noodles are so much better compared to Monta and Ramen Sora. Service is better, too.

298602,2015-01-11,0,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"If I had rated this place one year ago, it would have gotten 5 stars. I used to eat at Shoku Ramen once a week, so often that I even had a stamp card! I always order the Tonkotsu Ramen.

Before their renovation, this place was THE BEST. The food was awesome, the service was excellent, and the ramen was fairly priced for what you get. Here is my last experience since they have merged the two restaurants:

I went alone and asked to be seated in the Shoku side for more privacy. They told me I couldn't sit in there because the space is only for parties of 4 or more (or something ridiculous). So instead the waitress sat me in the middle of the restaurant (if you've dined alone, you know how awkward this can feel). Anyways, I brushed it off because I was going to get to eat my favorite dish ever. I ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and a hot green tea. The ramen came, and looked like it normally did, but something was different. The broth was not as savory as it used to be. I chomped into the two pieces of chirashu pork and got a mouthfull of PURE FAT!  I was totally shocked, but there was not a single piece of ""meat"" on either slice! They used to char them wonderfully and there was always a 50-50 meat-fat ratio in the slices. I cannot believe they charged me over $9 for two pieces of fat in mediocre broth. On top of that, the one tiny cup of green tea was $3. Insane.

I complained to the waitress about the chirashu and she said they changed their recipe, basically, ""too bad"". I think they changed their recipe to use PURE FAT SLICES and raised the price of the ramen to pay for the renovation of the restaurant, which isn't fair to the customers at all. Don't scalp your customers for mediocre food just because you decided to merge the restaurants together.

I checked other reviews to make sure it wasn't just an accident or one time thing...sure enough, other people on yelp have complained about being served pure fat slices in the tonkotsu :(

I am so sad to say, I will take my money elsewhere.",-eyD9AcOndfdUexRDjWmrw,2,0,1,9L5D2DHqZNDzIbZuVJWGTQ

345128,2014-05-01,0,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"Service: 7/10
Host was nice, waited about 10 minutes to be seated.
Our server was a nice kid he was pretty honest with me when I asked him which ramens were better and suggested I get the tantanmen ramen , which I did.
Though, he only came by once to see how we were doing and I had an empty glass of water for awhile.

Food quality:
Oxtail chili cheese fries 10/10
Spicy miso ramen 7.5/10
Tantanmen ramen 8.5/10

Food quantity:
The ramen bowls were both fairly large, filled me up completely.
The fries were overwhelming. It was only my boyfriend and I so we finished about half of it and fries aren't exactly good leftover foods. Probably good for a group of 3-4

Beverages:
Matcha iced tea 0/10
     Really tasteless. Tasted like water with green food dye. And my boyfriend and I both usually really enjoy green tea.
Thai tea with boba 7/10
     The thai tea itself was delicious but the boba balls were hard and tasted a little old. I would suggest the thai tea but with no boba balls.


Ambiance: 7/10
Newly renovated from the old bachi burger so the place had a really nice open, modern feel. It was pretty small though, especially for 2 restaurants in one.


Overall: 7/10
I would come back. But I wouldn't drive across town just for this place.",Us1fPCq8Cnp47BaL4R1fsA,1,0,4,4YaYqY5Mpq4yXwcctdRURw

I also tried the toro karaage and the chicken was raw!! There's nothing worse than getting served salmonella on a plate.

I had read about this restaurant and had lunch here today, but when I left,  I only had a small smile on my face.  I had the Tonkotsu ramen, a good basic ramen.

The noodles were very small, and all stuck together.  How does that happen?  I like thick and chewy noodles, so I was disappointed.

Next, the broth.  It was thin and not very flavorful or rich.  Had no depth, a single note of flavor.  

The pork bacon pieces were smoky and flavorful, but only two small pieces?

The motif is Tokyo ramen shop, with a long counter with stools, facing the kitchen, but not within view of the chefs.  A few tables are against the opposite wall.  It is quite attractive, really.

I hope they stay around long enough to find their way.",SKUA6eWhHv3eKuVf451jZQ,2,0,3,UxhEYyV-BduHO5gcBupKng

Prior to ordering I asked the server if the Ramen comes with bamboo if not I'll add it to the order in which he said it does. The first thing I noticed when it came out was it didn't have the bamboo we talked about. It took almost an hour wait for them to finally bring out my bowl or Ramen. The broth was eh the corn was hard and the mushroom had an after taste to it. The terrible service and bad food definitely will keep me from coming back.,rhXZfgmNjO7ITTcxq9n_5A,3,0,1,DgNIa2DDOosZJ2Yw4kalhg

Service was somewhat poor. Ramen came out after my friends were 3/4 finished with their meals. Never came back to check on whether the food was acceptable. Had to walk to the front to get our check.

Came in, were sat immediately, and then waited around 15 minutes to order, which was seriously annoying, especially as almost everyone who got seated after us were able to order first.  I had the spicy miso ramen, extra spicy, and they weren't kidding, it was spicy, but that's ok, I'm a bit of a chili head.  The waitress told us that some people thought it was too salty, so she recommended getting hot water on the side.  I didn't think it really needed it, but I used it anyway, and the full flavor was still there.  The noodles were cooked well, but I wish there had been more of them.  I finished them way before I was even halfway through the broth.  Overall, meal was fine, but I think there are better ramen restaurants around town.

The broths were so salty, the wife and I had 3 glasses of water each to go with.  Noodles were ok, cooked to an al dente, but the broth is what makes a good bowl of ramen, and theirs is certainly lacking.  

Also had a yummy order of the chicken wings, which were served with some sort of aioli dip.  Perhaps they should consider a fried chicken shop instead...because these were delicious.

First Trip I got the Shoyu (Soy Sauce) Ramen.  It's the most basic and simple menu you can get in Ramen and it really tells me how good each part of the Dish really can be.  Second trip had the Abura Soba (Soupless Ramen) Apparently new on the Specials menu. (Didn't see it on the first visit)  I haven't had Abura Soba a lot but again a simple ramen dish that uses simple ingredients so you really judge the chef's cooking technique with the ingredients.  (Everything here is locally grown)

Soup:  Simply put it was AWESOME....  Flavors are well blended.  Probably a combination of Chicken Stock with Fish Stock.  Had a robust flavor with a little bitterness from the veggies in the stock. (the balance is exquisite)  I wish it came a little more hotter (Tempurature) but I'm used to the soup to be burn your tongue hot.  

Noodles:  Cooked perfectly.  Uses the Standard Straight noodles used in Tonkotsu (Pork Broth) Noodles.  I'm used to the Shoyu Ramen to come with the standard wavy Egg Noodles but the straight noodles worked.  

Note: The Abura Soba came with the Wavy Egg Noodles so it really captured all the dry ingredients.  Again cooked to perfection.

Ingredients:  You can add your own favorite toppings but all Ramen comes standard with Green Onions, Menma (Bamboo Shoot) and Chashu (Roasted Pork).  The Chashu was just awesome and it came slightly charred so it really brought out extra flavor.

Staff:  They are the best part of the entire experience.  They were very polite, attentive and most of all knowledgeable with everything on the menu.  They are very well trained and really made the experience a wonderful one.

The staff has been overall very pleasant and the restaurant is comfy. It isnt extremely cramped like other popular ramen places... but i know that is how most popular ramen places are overall. I dont feel like I am going to put my elbow in my neighbor's soup at Shoku Ramen. 

If I had to say one particular thing that everyone should get when you are here... it would be their spicy tuna/ yellowtail item. I believe that it isnt always available though... since it is not on the main menu. I really enjoy their Spicy Miso. I usually add bamboo shoots and pork cheek... and it doesnt need any other additional condiments for me! It is pretty good when you are having a hard ramen craving. 

I was, however, disappointed in the duck ramen. Considering that duck usually has a pretty distinct taste, I did not taste much of anything in this ramen dish. I felt like i was about to empty every condiment on the table to get it to taste like something else.  I may need more duck ramen dishes at other places to give it a fair comparison though.

Came in on Sunday for lunch and was able to get seated right away. Heres the run down on what me and my party got:

- Garlic butter bacon fried rice. Yum-O! The description on the menu couldn't get any better. Right when the dish came out, I could smell the oily garlicky bacon goodness. Yes it might have clogged up an artery or two but to me, it was well worth it. However, after we left the restaurant, my party couldn't stop ahem ahem-ing from all the oil apparently. Obviously, it was my fault for ordering it but I didn't expect all the mucus/phlegm to be coming up from my throat. Aside from the ahem-aheming, I thought the dish was quite tasty.

- Tonkotsu ramen. First off, I really dislike the noodles here. I like thick chewy noodles and these were more on the thin side which some people love, but just aren't for me. The broth itself however was on a a good salty level but like others have said, lacked depth and richness of the pork bone flavor. The chasu was alright. Wasn't a melt in your mouth kind of feeling. 

-Buta-san ramen. Broth was even less impressive than the tonkotsu ramen. The egg however was done to perfection. 

Overall, I would've given this place 4 stars except I left ahem-aheming trying to get the mucus out of my throat. With all the ramen places up popping up, I think there are other better options.",cdCvHUFdssePxowTHIo3dQ,7,2,3,gMqz8iMYt90c13EzLxVUwA

Location - great! Close to the southwest area & near the I-15 exit. It is located right next to Bachi burger.

Restaurant - cozy, typical jap-style restaurant setting. Long wooden tables. Good atmosphere, but can see this place getting cramped during busy hours.

Food - I ordered tonkatsu ramen with extra nori. My mom had some kind of marinated salmon bowl *don't remember the full name* (looked just like salmon eggs, thought it would be some kind of meat). I can only speak for the ramen. Overall it was O-K. I didn't like how the noodles were wayyy too soft. No bite to it whatsoever. The broth was a tad bit salty, but I dealt with it. It came with 2 slices of chasu and bamboo shoots. I wish it came with egg, but it was an additional charge. 

Price - a bit more expensive than monta, but maybe because it's the only one in this neighborhood so far..?

Service - great and extremely attentive staff!  It wasn't busy during dinner tonight and we were seated right away.

Overall, I'd only come back if I were with someone who wanted to try it out. Otherwise I'd make the drive to Chinatown for ramen.

Also I want to say that the chef and one other staff argued with in ear shot of where I sat so the whole conversation was about my order and how it slipped his mind about my food allergy.

Food: I had the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra corn and nori. The broth was delicious without being overly salty, or overly bland. It was the perfect balance. I should have opted for extra chasu. There were only one or two pieces in the broth, but were melt in your mouth delicious. So, if getting Tonkotsu Ramen either get extra chasu, or opt for Buta-San. That is what my friend had, and the broth was almost identical to mine except his had much more meat /""heavenly pork"". The portions were  a bit larger than those at Monta's. Average price before any additions were between $8-10 a bowl.  We also had two orders of their gyoza which were pretty average. 

Service: Our waitress was very sweet with a great attitude and willingness to accommodate additional requests for condiments. She forgot to put in our additional order of gyoza and was very apologetic once I reminded her. 

Decor: The restaurant was not very large. I'd say about six tables and six seats at the bar. It was clean with simplistic modern decor. Tables featured condiments that consisted of sesame seeds, shoyu, chili oil and gyoza sauce. They accommodated my request for Sriracha because I wanted a little bit of extra spicy kick in my broth.

1707157,2015-01-29,7,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"Two stars is a stretch after my last visit.

My previous trips were great. I've brought the boyfriend and his parents and we left very content. Service was on point and there was never a wait for be seated. I'm not a ramen expert, but I loved that Shoku offered a vegetarian option and rice noodles instead of the traditional ramen noodles.

My last visit was on a Sunday night. I arrived to find that Bachi Burger and Shoku Ramen are now one. My first thought? ""Gee, I can see how the wait time will be even longer!"" Sure enough, the line of people were scattered in their entrance and outside the building. Good thing I was getting take-out...or so I thought. 

I placed my to-go order with the host, who informed me it would take about 1/2 hour. So I ran errands across the street and returned 35 minutes later. 

Host: ""Oh, I forgot to get a phone number or payment from you, so I couldn't put your order in. I can put it in now...""

Me: ""Wow. So how long will that take?""

Host: ""About 1/2 hour.""

Me: ""That sucks.""

Host: *shrugs shoulders*

I started walking to the car, then decided to go back. I asked to speak to a manager. Chris approached me and apologized, saying it was policy to get a phone number or payment for all take-out orders. I replied that I understood there are rules. However, it was not my fault that the host did not follow through. It was unacceptable to expect a customer to wait ANOTHER 1/2 hour and provide NO OTHER SERVICE RECOVERY. Chris agreed and offered to make my food ASAP. I waited and it ended up taking about 1/2 hour. No discount, nothing comped, no coupon for a free appetizer on my next visit to make up for this awful experience. 

I think the only reason why this review wasn't ONE star was because of Chris's efforts to get my food ready. I thanked him and left. Was the food good? I will admit it was, yes. Sadly, it's definitely not good enough to go back.",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,20,14,2,jdytcfzUlz2OB-n42qSlfg

After our party was waiting for what seemed an eternity at Bachi Burger, we decided to go to its sister place, Ramen Shoku.  Simply put, I most likely, not probably, won't be back here again. The various appetizers including the GYOZA and TAKOYAKI was somewhat interesting, but nothing too exciting to do an order of again.  Each of us  had something different...TONKOTSU, SPICY MISO, and I had the most touted TAN TAN MEN ramen for 11.50.  It was overly salty and the noodles were too al dente.  I couldn't get past the overly salty taste of the soup and it seemed that every time I had the soup, I would be grappling for the water as a chaser.  The menu stated spciy base, but they need to edit it and put salty base.  I almost wanted to add the carafe of water into the soup and ask them to heat the soup along with the al dente noodles to cook some more.  The overpowering taste of salt definitely made me want to walk out that door and not even consider ramen places in general.  I think the SPICY RAMEN was more up my alley as it had more flavor from the miso base.  The base of the TAN TAN MEN was just simply oxtail soup which would have been more preferable than what they had added to it.  It definitely helped me to eat less, but then again helped me to cross this off my list or put it on my list of places to never go back again.  

Next time, I'll wait for Bachi Burger even if it's an hour long wait...there's a reason why this place was barely empty and the Bachi was filled to the brim.  You'll enjoy drinking water at this place.",EDomjStHED1E59zv3haruA,5,0,1,idcjQbj0KtsBAiqqN7XHwQ

I ordered the tonkotsu with buttered corn and the nitamago. The broth was really good, the butter adds a little richness and the corn was sweet just how I like it! The nitamago was good but I think I like monta ramen's better. It had a really deep soy flavor at the very end. Tastes like they used kikkoman soy in their marinade? I'm guessing?

It was also frustrating that although we wanted to eat ramen only, They were not seating in that room and we had to Wait 45 mins for a table at bachi burger side. What's the point of being connected if u won't use both restaurant spaces? Esp when some people only want food from shoku only?

2261966,2013-04-08,1,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"So I dunno if you've ever been in a situation where you're really hungry and you're thinkin, 'Do I want a Burger, or do I feel like a hot bowl of Noodles?'  So typical..... I've been there on numerous occasions and let me tell you, I could ponder that fork in the road for hours...if only there was a place that served both..... Tadaaaa!

Well, it's not exactly one place, more like two places adjacent to each other by chef/owner Lorin Watada; whose fusion burger fame, 'Bachi Burger' has propelled her into Ramen game - the current 'it' food in Vegas.  Not that there can be enough Japanese fare in my opinion!Jaku Niku, Kyo Shoku (The Weak are Meat, The Strong Eat) Shoku Ramen-ya 

I have to say, there's like, a Ramen explosion going on in Vegas, it's getting a little over saturated  with all the Ramen joints popping up...not that I'm complaining.  Some of the places here taste better than the one's in Japan!  (no kidding) 

Well being right next door to Bachi, it's a culinary Sophie's Choice, what am I willing to let go; could I possible eat a Burger with Fries right after a bowl of Ramen and Gyoza?  If only they could deliver next door, that would be the best of both worlds right in one sitting. I mean, how many calories could that be...4,000?  What's that, 7 hours on the Starimaster? No prob!

Shoku Ramenya is relatively small, just under thirty seats, but feels pretty open and spacious for a noodle shop.  I'm particularly enamored with the set of condiments at the table as well as the jug of water that they provide for you as you're seated, refilled often throughout the meal.  And the iced Green tea is also refill friendly, all little plusses that add up in the end. 


Pork Gyoza

Always start off with a plate of Gyoza, it's like a cultural tradition of Ramen Shops to provide these half dozen, moon shaped crispy delights stuck together like little piglets.  It's always a little game to try and pick them off without ripping the skin, retaining the piping hot filling within its crackling confines.  As for the pork, I enjoyed the strong hit of Garlic, but it felt to me as if the meat slightly overcooked; it had a harder texture without that juicy component that one would expect when you bite into Gyoza.


Lobster Miso Ramen

Somewhat of of an offbeat item, the Lobster Miso Ramen has Butter Sake poached Lobster pieces along with the usual Ramen suspects: Chasu Pork Slices, Buttered Corn, Kikurage (Wood Ear Mushrooms), Menma (Mabmboo Shoots), Nori (Seaweed) and Kaiware (Daikon Sprouts).  The broth is made from the gooey, brown, Crustacean brain sludge (hence, Lobster Miso) that delivers a predominantly briny, sea/ocean soup that if that's your thing, it will drive you insanely happy!

I was bouncing off the walls, it tasted so good! And you get the best of both, there's three Chasu pieces resting on top, although they looked more like thick-cut Pork Belly slices to me. Minor details...  Usually the portions are overgenerous, where I'm hurting to finish the bowl, not the case here, in fact I was left wanting a little more Ramen noodles to go with all the toppings.

As for dessert, I was tempted by something cold after all that hot broth, And Ice Cream seemed like a good idea. I'm terrible fond of Black Sesame, as it seems to be a reoccurring ingredient in many Japanese desserts.  Assured of it's moderate portion, what came out was a pint of Ice Cream, which could only be considered one scoop if its contents came out of a ten gallon vat from a factory...  I should have know better, but I'm slightly disappointed every time I order a Japanese dessert, it's relatively mild with lukewarm sweetness.. underwhelming.

But a palate cleanser was definitely needed after all the oils in the broth and this kinda worked..


So, now it come down to the Battle: who won?

For Appetizers:  I don't know, they both so different!!
For Main:          I can't choose - they're both sooo good!!!
For Dessert:      Bleah.....

There really is no battle, if you feel like having Burgers, ie. red meat, got to Bachi.  If you cold and need to warm up with a great bowl of Ramen with some great Broth, get yourself on over to Shoku Ramen Ya.  I love both of these places and it's always hard to decide each time I'm in front of these two doors!

The food was decent. Broth tasted ok. The ramen seemed like it was from a package you buy at the store, and not authentic ramen. Their cha siu was mostly meat and very little fat (which is unacceptable because the fat in cha siu adds to the flavor). There was this weird red fruit in my ramen as well. I believe it to be a pickled.... uh... I honestly have no clue. haha!  I didn't really like it too much, but it does little to the flavoring of the soup. Next, the 'half order' of gyoza. And they really do mean half. Three tiny pieces pan fried on a plate.  They tasted like they were frozen from a supermarket. The nitamago was the only good thing in my bowl of ramen. Nicely flavored and decently cooked.

The waiter we had was not very knowledgable and could not answer simple questions.  We asked if we had a choice on the hardness of our noodles, and he did not know what we were talking about. To my knowledge, Shoku used to allow their customers to select the hardness of their noodles (one of the reasons I decided to check out this place) and the waiter had no clue what I was talking about. (We asked a different waiter later on, and he explained to us that a lot of customers were confused with the option so they ended up removing it completely).

Food: I've three types of ramen, two types of fries, one of their burgers and I have no complaints. My fave ramen so far is the spicy tonkatsu. Even though it is a little spicy for me (you can get the spicy paste on the side or add more if you like), it was delicious. Their burgers are great too. You can tell they use quality ingredient and their burgers are on the pricey side for that very reason. Fries are unique in flavor but fresh and yummy every time. Food is 5 stars. 

Service: their service is slow. Our waiter took his sweet time coming to our table from when we first sat down up until we got the check. And whenever I could get his attention he didn't let me finish my sentence before he ran away. Every time I come here I sit there 10+ minutes before my server comes to take my order.

But the egg tasted too much like mirin or vinegar. So much that I didn't want to eat it all. The broth was way too salty. The pork was dry and meaty. The flavor was actually good, but I wish it had more fat. Miso only comes with one sheet of nori. Wish I knew that. I would have ordered more. There was also a pickled plum (I think) in there.

The seating was good, I liked their glassware and dishes (if you are interested in that sort of thing). Their menu had a lot of different things from what I'm used to seeing at Monta, so I was happy to try something new. The boyfriend had the Kim chi pork bowl and my daughter had the bacon Takana fried rice. I ordered the buta-san broth and extra chashu and a poached egg.

Their bacon rice was absolutely amazing, to be perfectly honest. I tried some of my daughter's food and therefore had high hopes for my own dish. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed in my choice. 

There was hardly any broth, and while I like a large portion of noodles and pork, the lack of broth was a deterrent. The mushrooms have to be an acquired taste to enjoy, because I have never disliked food as much as I disliked my meal.  I'm a mushroom lover, but the stench emanating from the dish was such a deterrent. It was like smelling and eating an old, dirty sock... One that hadn't been washed in months. I picked them out but the smell and taste lingered, making it so unpalatable I had to push it off on my boyfriend (who agreed that it was bad but took it home for himself anyway).

I liked their atmosphere and the server was extremely friendly, but I don't think I'm going to be going back.

Personally would have picked one star but the bacon fried rice was delicious, so it bumped up the score a bit.

Just finished. The food came out really fast but yup..  off our ramen place list!!!! The soup was very tasty and not super spices, but the noodles weren't separated from each other and they were over cooked..how does that happen?! Very disappointed with their ramen.

I can proudly say that I have eaten here over 10 times. Everyone should start off with an appetizer of the Tori Karaage which is now boneless fried chicken that come with an amazing chili sesame aioli. As for Ramen my favorite has been the TanTan Men, a spicy seafood ramen with scallops and shrimp grounded up with beef and bok choy cabbage to add a good balance of vegetables in your ramen. 

Not until did the Abura Soba come out which is now my all time favorite. Its a brothless ramen that comes with egg noodles, mushrooms, veggies, chashu, and a poached egg. They also provide you with vinegar on the side to add into your bowl. Mix it all together really good and you have a party in your tummy. Now that the deadly summer weather is creeping up on vegas, the Abura Soba is perfect on a hot day. 

The setting is very relaxing unlike Monta where they rush you in and rush you out. Shoku has a cozy ambience and great attentive service. 

Finish off your meal with some mochi ice cream, either green tea or strawberry (I say both) and you got yourself a perfect meal to add to a perfect day. 

p.s. You also get a stamp card! After a purchase of 10 ramens you get the 11th for free. What a bonus!!",Ep__st7ImgJavzPO4E6XOQ,4,3,5,NfKAPKxYg1S5jJxrMPRm3g

We ordered the gyozas (good), bacon fried rice (YUMMY, no need to say more, just order it) and tonkotsu ramen with nitamago (good). The noodles were done nicely, the broth had good flavor, the nitamago was perfect with a gooey center, however I'm not sure if I liked their pork?  It was sliced thicker than most of the ramen houses in Vegas and was way smokier.  Since the pork belly was thicker, it was harder to eat because the fat didn't melt off entirely.  They were running a special during V-day for couples and, included a free dessert to share.  I think it was green tea ice cream with red bean curds, and some type of granola (or crunchy stuff).  That dessert was OFF THE HOOK!  I recently was looking to see if they had a dessert like this at Bachi Burger (since I heard it is the same owners) but, saw nothing like it.  Their tap water is served up very nicely in cute plastic carafes.

Perhaps this has changed but, Shoku could use one huge improvement... Upon arriving there was no sign in reasonable view to let you know exactly where this restaurant was.  We walked around like idiots trying to figure out where to enter...  

Service was good and friendly.  Unlike most ramen houses, our waiter was totally fluent in English with no accent (he was Asian).  I also noticed he was very knowledgable, kind, and patient with other guest who ordered before us (as they were new to the world of ramen and Japanese fare).

Pretty standard, not the best takoyaki I've had, but it wasn't bad.  For my entree I ordered the spicy miso ramen- EXTRA SPICY. Definitely had an extra kick! The broth was creamy and packed some flavor. My favorite part of the ramen was the bacon(?) or was it pork belly? It was tender and it was sitting in the broth for a while so my spicy miso flavor was coating my bacon.

I'm used to the pieces that just literally melt into the broth, but this pork was thicker and meatier and stayed put together.

The ramen was not the worst I've ever had, but it was close. There was no check back by a server to see if our food was delivered or acceptable. Once we finished our meals we sat for around 45 minutes with empty dishes in front of us and were ignored by the entire staff. The thought crossed my mind of just walking out because I am sure no one would have noticed. We were finally able to track down a server that was kind enough to grab our bill for us.

My boyfriend and I arrived and got seated the first time immediately with a fair amount of people in the room, the service was attentive and very polite. We ordered the "" Tonkotsu Shio Ramen "" and a side of the ox tail fries. I'm going to be very honest, this Tonkotsu Ramen was phenomenal and nothing like I had before. It was very rich and flavorful, I got excited for what other ramen they had to offer. But the ox tail fries, to me personally, tasted like chili cheese fries. 

Everyone raves about these fries but it did not compare to the ones I had before. I like the more oriental style or taste when it comes to ox tail, with this one it felt very westernized. It had beans and the ox tail was cooked very nicely although it resembled a lot like pulled pork. Their style is unique though so I'd understand if they're trying to make it more different than other restaurants. 6/10

The second time was an alright experience. We had an over 10 minute wait to a lightly populated room. Our waiter had us wait longer than 15 as well just to order. I happened to try the ""TanTanmen"", and I was disappointed. They abused the greens with the cilantro and broccoli sprouts, they ended up overwhelming the broth in my opinion. It says they had green onion which is way more preferable but I literally remember there being cilantro. You cannot confuse the two since cilantro looks like a very small leaf. I don't know if that was a mistake or was intentional? The shrimp paste was okay but it gets too salty and weird when you slurp a big chunk of it in your broth. If that was chili string used to garnish the ramen, it was a weird texture to break down in my mouth and I ended up spitting it out. Would recommend having a less excessive ramen garnish and minimizing it. The broth itself was good before I mixed everything in, and I enjoyed the meat. 

The fried calamari was cooked to perfection and I really enjoyed the taste and texture. Was good to side dish with ramen.",_mKmr0bHrlsf2A5HURovcQ,3,1,4,A__XR24Mb0qSdJx2_7is5g

Noodles are great.  Thick wavy ramen with just enough chewiness that adds good texture.  Vey spicy is just spicy as compared to others in the area.

I do like that you can add bok choy, though the $2 upcharge counts for about 3 branches which doesn't seem worth it looking back.  The broth is fine - more of a pork soup than an umami blast.

Unlike Fukumimi, they provide condiments out at each table so you can add to your ramen as you see fit, but don't forget to taste the soup base without anything added first! They have a large dinning area that looks to fit at least 40+ people in it. You can't see the kitchen because the bar in front has a high wall, but it's slightly exposed. There is a bar area that you can sit too if you don't want to sit at regular tables.

They bring out the pickled ginger and garlic in separate containers and offer it if you so desire to put them into your ramen, they do however add some of the ginger to the ramen. The server was very nice and asked if we had any food allergies to let the kitchen now, which I've never been asked about food allergies before, always had to let them know or ask about it, so that was a +1. The condiments that they offered include, goma (which has a grinder) or sesame seed, shoyu, chu oil, and gyoza sauce. 

Both my friend and I ordered the spicy miso combos except he got the one with the pork bowl and I got one with the gyoza. The combos came with an egg as well. 

The ramen had chashu, bamboo shoots, ginger, seaweed, and some sprouts. The broth was rich and a bit too salty for my tastes but some people like that. The noodles are okay, they're regular ramen noodles, but my friend didn't like it as it reminded him of making ramen at home as he said, not sure how that made any difference. The pork bowl that my friend had was a bit too strong in flavoring for myself, but I'm also not really much of a pork eater, but it was still good. The gyoza tasted like one of those prepackaged ones you can buy at the grocery store, it wasn't one of the good ones either. I won't be getting gyoza with my ramen here anymore.

When I arrived, I sat down, and I was presented with a large container of water, and a shot glass. At first, I questioned whether or not they were serving me sake. It's a minor complaint, but I wasn't a fan of having to refill my water shot glass 27 times.

THE RAMEN: When I order ramen at a new place for the first time, I like to keep it simple. I ordered Tonkotsu ramen. My ramen arrived 10-15 minutes later, kind of a long time considering the restaurant was only half full. 

The first thing I immediately noticed was that there was only one piece of pork. The pork was tender and delicious. However, half of that piece of pork was entirely fat and nearly inedible.

Next, I dove straight into the noodles. The ramen was cooked perfectly. I then grabbed my spoon and proceeded to taste some of the broth on its own. The broth was very one-dimensional. It had some pork flavor, but it wasn't EXPLODING with pork flavor. This wasn't good because the noodles were lacking that pork flavor that they desperately needed. The ramen also felt as if it was lacking salt. You're probably laughing at the fact I just said that, ""What? Ramen? Lacking Salt? You're crazy, Alex!"" It goes back to what I said about the flavors being one-dimensional. I added an excessive amount of soy sauce to get that saltiness, and the ramen tasted 10x better.

THE VERDICT: From the inferior amount of pork (which was also extremely fatty) to the bland broth, it just wasn't good. Stick with Monta. It tastes better, and it's cheaper.",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,0,0,2,jHOET2nFjpD1WdtnAVpO1A

The price for the fried rice was reasonable for $7.00 and the flavour was quite nice with a bit of a spicy kick to it, but they didn't give you much on the plate.  Same with the ramen, they served it in a big enough bowl, but the bowl was only half full and the two slices of thin chashu that were in the bowl were I would say 90% fat.  And not the type that melts in your mouth either. The ramen portion was also very small and you have to pay extra $2 for extra ramen. The flavour of the broth was quite good though but don't think I would be coming back for awhile, since the portions are so small.  
 
The tori karaage was a big disappointment for $6.50 I got three drumsticks and one wing and they were just average size.  The dipping sauce was okay, but the karaage itself was lacking in flavour.  Whatever it was marinated in made the texture of the chicken mushy like.  I didn't like it at all.  And it was deep fried too long.  I won't be ordering this dish again.

This one is located right next to Bachi Burger, at the corner of Windmill and Bermuda. We noticed a lot of people milling around outside waiting to be seated... Lucky for my tummy, the line was for Bachi Burger. At around 5 pm on a Saturday, my party of two and a half was seated right away.

The restaurant is small, much like other ramen spots in town. It's one long narrow room with a few tables and bar seating. They do have high chairs which was a huge plus for us.

To my dismay, they were already out of the Lobster Miso Ramen, the main reason why I wanted to try this place. Our waitress suggested the Bacon Takana Garlic Fried Rice as an appetizer. It was so good that even baby liked it!

I ordered Tonkatsu Ramen with a side of extra noodles and an egg. My husband ordered Buta-San Ramen with an egg. I'm not sure if my taste buds were overloaded with salt/garlic flavors from the fried rice, but I found myself gulping down my water after a few spoonfuls of my soup. I enjoyed my broth but it was a little on the salty side for my taste. Baby loved the side of noodles which he ate happily.

I can't recall the prices of other ramen places in town but I felt like Shoku Ramen-Ya was a little pricier. Service was very good. We always had our water jug full.  I was so full and when the waitress asked if I wanted to a to-go box, I refused. She talked me into taking the ramen to-go, and advised me to heat up the noodles separately from the broth so they don't get too soft. When the hunger monster reared its head later that evening, I was very happy that I listened to the waitress. I enjoyed the ramen much more as leftovers for some reason!

On the second visit there was DRASTIC improvement in everything, except service because that is as good as it gets. 

Had to try the Buta-san again and definitely there was a change in depth of the broth, a savory pork flavor with an almost smokey finish. The consistency of the broth is still  a bit thin but that is all personal preference! The noodles that were a bit of a downfall for me last time have been replaced by a thicker noodle that gives it the satisfying bite, mmm! 

Also tried the specialty XO Tan Tan Men, which had a prominent seafood taste with a very forward nutty sesame taste. The ground pork had a clean fresh ginger finish which worked really well for me to combat the savory broth. I'm not sure about its adherence to traditional Tan Tan Men, but it is definitely worth a try in your ramen rotation. My only complaint was there there was not enough bok choy and it being an expensive ramen @ $11.

I'm not much of fan for Ramen, but I do have my favorite spots around and I know what entails a good bowl of Ramen.  

What intrigued me about Shoku Ramen-Ya is not their broth, but the unique ingredients that came with my bowl.  The Ni-Tamago was something I don't think I have ever had in the US.  Most of the Ramen places serve a hard boiled egg, it is less time consuming and much easier to make.  However, at Shoku Ramen-ya, you know time and care was taken to make their egg!  It was a soft boiled egg, meaning the egg yolk was still a bit gooey and jelly-like, which I love and takes a slow controlled temperature to make sure the egg turns out like that.  A+!  

Another thing that was unique about their Ramen is that the chashu is done how any other Ramen shop does it, with an exception, it was char-grilled and has that smokey grilled flavor to it!  That was something I never had with Ramen and I thought was smart and unique!  It adds a whole new flavor to that bowl!  That was very memorable! Another A+!  

Most of the times, I grade a ramen based on the broth/soup base.  I find that to be the MOST important since it basically gives it its kick and stamina with each bite!  I didn't really get that at Shoku Ramen-ya.  Don't get me wrong, the broth was good and flavorful, but it just didn't quite meet my expectations of other broths I have tried at other places (LA and Hawaii).  

Even with the broth not meeting my expectations, the unique ingredients itself did which far exceeded my expectations....now if we can all put ALL those into one bowl, I'd have the PERFECT bowl of ramen. =D  

Another memorable dish I got was their bacon garlic fried rice!  Fried rice at a ramen place?  Hell yea!  Ramen shops, especially japanese owned, usually have the BEST fried rice dishes!  Usually they make it with the charshu porked that is used in the ramen (which Shoku-ya does) but also adds garlic and bacon to it which makes it even better!  I would definitely come back for more of that fried rice! 

I ended the dinner with a scoop of the black sesame ice cream.  Meh.  I wish it had more of the black sesame flavor and less milky.  I know I can be picky, but in Asia, I have had amazing black sesame ice cream, simply because every bite was a burst of sweet black sesame flavor!  

I'd definitely come back to this place again, especially for their fried rice! =D  Maybe add a few other Hawaii local favorite side dishes on the menu?  (Ban Ban Ji) =D",n_UcypOj7YW8gdR43XIUSQ,4,2,4,yIqF9Xus0S_WvpalJEVCfQ
3810780,2013-04-12,1,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"i found out about this ramen joint through an article emailed to me by Eater Vegas.  Did some search online right away and found very good reviews.  The joint is much closer to me than Monta, is owned by the same group of talents behind Bachi Burger, and haven't been back to Monta since they were shut down by the Southern Nevada Health Department for incurring 47 demerits.  They were reinspected and have   reopened since, however.

This ramen joint is pretty much not very visible and is tucked almost at the back and the very end of the same building where Bachi Burger is at.  Considering the strip mall's big parking lot, parking that day was a bit hard because it was lunch time, duh!.  There was a line outside, and more people waiting inside.  It's a relatively small, typical of ramen joints, with 7 (i think, that what I counted) tables and the counter bar but way bigger and feels more welcoming than Monta's.  The kitchen is not as visible as Monta's.  There's a 5 feet tall wall that separates the bar and the kitchen.  

I was able to sit right away since I chose the bar and didn't have to sign up and wait.  I realized that aside from the people waiting to be seated, there were also people coming in to pick up phone orders.  This place was busy!

There were a couple of wait staff, both very friendly Latinos, and since there's a wall obstructing the kitchen view, i wasn't sure if the cooks were too.  The clientele that day was a mixed crowd, mostly I assumed, workers from around the area on their lunch breaks.  The joint's ambience is very cozy and relaxed, very clean and bright, minimally but tastefully decorated.  Much better than Monta's for sure.  

As i sat down, I was given a bottle of carbon-filtered chilled water and a shot glass.  I ordered the chasu rice bowl, and for a change, I ordered their Butasan Ramen instead of Tonkatsu Ramen.  

The breakdown:  Chasu was grilled alright, but found them to be more fat and there was hardly meat in them.  Again, I will never order rice bowls, ever, when I go to ramen joints.  Lesson learned.

Tonkatsu Ramen is my peg when critiquing a ramen joint.  I should've ordered tonkatsu but I ordered Butasan aka as Heavenly Pork Chasu which has two kinds of pork preparations in it, a slice of braised pork cheek (fat), and a slice of stewed pork belly (fat), ni tamago (boiled egg) and the usual sliced scallions, bamboo shoots, mushroom and with nori strips.  I could only assume the broth for both tonkatsu and butasan are the same.  It tasted porky alright but a bit one dimensional.  I didn't taste the usual layering of flavors and that umami kick.  The noodles are the same thickness as Monta's but a bit bland.  I wish they were a bit thicker.  And the pork?  they're mostly, if not all fat.   The friendly wait staff asked me if I wanted some condiments and I said no because I didn't know what they were, or if I would get charged extra for them.  I should've said yes, in retrospect.  

The verdict:  Well, the place is new, relatively new, fairly new, so there will be a lot of growing pains and improvements to be had.  The food are competitively priced, and very passable, not the very best , but certainly edible.  I will surely go back and try their other ramen concoctions, specifically the lobster miso.

I loved the food at Bachi, but stopped going there because the wait was ridiculous, the service was really bad, and they were pretentious.  

Merging the spaces and redecorating did not speed up the wait time, but we were able to get some counter space way quicker than waiting for a table.  The service was still crappy.  We got flat $3 Diet Cokes and the waitress did not seem to think flat soda was an issue.  And even though we did not drink them, we still had to pay for them.

I ordered the 5 spice Shoyu Ramen for $10.  This sounded interesting to me because I have never heard of ramen with chicken.  I assume it's not traditional, since I have never seen it at any noodle house, but it was very good.  It was a shoyu broth with free-range chicken breast, wavy noodles, bok choy, green onion, mushroom, and fish cakes.  The broth was not too salty, but it needed a little kick so I added chili strands and chili spice.  The chicken had skin, but was very good once I removed it.  

All in all, if I had to go back to Shoku, I would likely order a burger from the Bachi menu, but I would order this again if I was in a soup mood; even though it is overpriced for ramen.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,2,1,3,06Wh7Dqxfv3aCXtsLJ_pJA

The ambiance of the restaurant has kind of dark and mysterious atmosphere. It looks like a typical Japanese pub you'd find over in Japan. A bit of authentic appearance which is pretty neat. 

When I had viewed the menu, there are a variety of ramen you can select from. I wasn't sure what to order so one of their servers had suggested the spicy miso ramen since it was one of his favorites here. 

The noodles came out several minutes later. The ramen had a bright orange color to it. It was appealing to the eyes and it smelled really good. But after taking a sip of the broth, I shook my head in disappointment. The broth was bland and lacked seasoning. I couldn't really taste the spicy miso as well. The noodles were more overcooked than I wanted it to be. The only thing that tasted good was the braised pork.

Would I come back here again? Maybe but highly unlikely. Their service was good so that would probably be the only reason why I'd come back.",Nfp5VrZwnms_whEFBpX9VQ,0,0,3,UCD-sfRH52yYiEI6SGqK9Q

I like Bachi Burger because of the quality and complexity of ingredients they use, so i couldn't wait to try Shoku.

I got the Tonkotsu style which is a milky rich broth accented with pork flavors that boil and marinate for 20 hours. Very rich and delicious. Really liked the noodles, thin like spaghetti and not thick like some places. The pork was tender and flavorful. They had a host of options that you can add for an extra cost. Such things as green onion, buttered corn, hen egg, extra pork.  The result is one great bowl of ramen. Along with that my wife and i got a side of bacon fried rice. Talk about immediate addiction. The rice had sort of a crust like they fried it up in the flat top grill. Yummy!! Had little pieces of onion and pork mixed in with it. We thought we would eat about half and take the rest home. Well before we knew it after pecking away at it like a couple of roosters the whole bowl was empty. They also had a nice special going on $6 for a large Sake.

The restaurant is fairly small and filled up quickly for lunch. But the service was great and the food quality is excellent. Great lunch if you're craving some good ramen.",0grZ4N1UYPZmRvv3lXJuJA,5,1,4,r42rfx8sl6QD3z3BXhAM4g

I was quietly greeted and quickly seated and handed the menu. The waiter returned shortly later with a pticher of water (woohoo!!) and asked if I was ready to order.

I decided on the tonkotsu ramen with an extra side of noodles (+2) and extra nor (+1.50). There were some unconventional choices such as lobster miso, spicy miso, and buta-san. These choices were not completely unexpected considering Bachi Burger had some very inventive burger/sandwich combinations.

The ramen came out quickly. There were several slices of fatty pork, wood ear fungus, a sheet of nori, chopped green onion, julienned green onions (the extra negi I had ordered), and some black sesame oil (?). The pork was soft and tender, but there was a mild charred after taste to it. It wasn't terrible, just unexpected. The broth was good: not too salty, rich, but not very flavorful. In short, the broth just really didn't make a huge impression on me. The noodles were just a touch harder than I prefer. I was checked on frequently and my table cleared quickly

My total bill for the bowl of tonkotsu ramen, extra noodles, extra negi with tax and tip was $15, a little pricey. Overall, Shoku is a good addition to the Vegas ramen scene, service was friendly and quick. The distance/location of the shop along with the somewhat poor value makes me think twice about making a trip just to try the other types of ramen.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,3,1,3,05W2_m20qxDX4bgHj6LkxQ

This review is a summation of what took me a solid week to get out of my wife who is too nice to give something negative without finding the smallest compliment go with it, but who's Japanese pride eventually boils to the surface.

First, the good!
Location: Easy to get to off the 215 and a small drive from the 15.
Staff: Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and took the time to explain what was going on and made sure we had all the condiments we needed. Whenever she saw I water getting low she was quick with a refill.
Atmosphere: Urban chic, but laid back enough to unwind. The modern upbeat Jazz music was a nice change from the norm.

The bad:
Now, I know there is always a battle between those who hold authenticity close to their hearts and those who give leeway due to the fact that this is Las Vegas not Japan.

The wife and I ordered the Tonkatsu, I took mine regular while the wife combo'd it with gyoza and hanjuku egg. The wife's first sip of the broth was followed by a ""that's not right"" look, but being the cheerful person she is said it tasted good. Upon further hammering by me she said ""The broth is not as 'deep' as it should be."" When I kept on asking how she stated ""There isn't that much flavor, there should be more flavor"" and that she thought she was eating miso sesame ramen, not tonkotsu. She was also put off by the sake like after taste of the hanjuku egg, void of the umami flavor she was expecting.

She summed it up by saying that she would never bring in a person from Kyushu, where tonkatsu ramen is there pride. When I asked if she would bring in another Japanese person at all she answered with a quick 'no.'

What really highlighted how off their broth was when we made the instant tonkotsu she had in the cupboard only a few days later. After tasting that I understood how disappointed my wife was.

So, was it good soup? Yes.
Was it proper ramen? No, no, no.",HAFTRawn2sz909EbdVt5wQ,4,3,2,Wdas7VgZFLjxOVIofooFfA

4131122,2013-05-05,1,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"Upon the recommendation of a friend I bookmarked this and it quickly became a MUST do when a certain person I know wrote a review.

On an early day off I decided to make the drive over and give it a shot.  I walked into a nice greeting and was seated at a small table to look at the menu even though I knew what I was going to order.  I  contemplated the lobster ramen but needed to stay with what I know to give it a full and complete review.

A short back story, I have traveled to Japan and fell in love with Ramen I craved it upon my return to the US to the point of driving to LA to have it.  Yes, there was a Pre Ramen day here in Vegas not so long ago.  I do not consider myself a professional I am however a lover and a budding connoisseur of ramen.

I had to order the ramen I fell in love with in Japan, Tonkotsu Ramen (pork bone broth).  Tonkotsu is a think broth from boiling bones at a high heat for many hours the soup has a consistency of almost a gravy.  Ramen is an art of sorts if you appreciate ramen almost as much as fine art when it is done properly and consistently in its many different forms.  Only certain chefs really do it right only a few succeed at it correctly.

This was done right it had an amazing thick rich and flavorful broth a nice firm but not too firm noodle you can choose all your favorite toppings to add as well (mine are nori (seaweed), corn and egg)  The egg here is different from what I have had here in the US this is more reminiscent of what I had in Japan.  It is kind of like a soft boiled egg but the yolk remains just slightly soft on the edge of turning firm.  OMG LOVE this once you swirl it around in your soup a bit it warms and oh pure yumminess ensues!  For the softer egg fans only if it freaks you out get a firm one but I suggest trying it at least once.  BTW the Charsu here is different as well, still soft and fatty bursting with flavor but I felt like it may have been cooked differently it had almost a grilled flavor not what I have experienced before but I loved it.  I need to do more research...

The service was nice they served a medium size pitcher of ice water and check on you but leave you alone for the most part but ready to jump when you are ready.  When I asked for my bill I sadly expressed my left overs going to waste it was just too good for me to want to leave behind.  She brought out 2 containers and slowly started to scoop out my broth into one container then added my noodles and what not to the other.  Handed it to me and said ""there now the noodles won't dissolve and you can eat the rest.""  DUH seriously why didn't I think of that!  BTW my lunch the next day was almost as amazing as the prior day! ;)",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,4,2,5,3B3C1VZmMb8gO-kgHuxzng
4137714,2012-11-28,2,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"First let me say that I luv that there's a Ramen place near my house - FINALLY!!!!
Oh and it's right next door to yummy Bachi Burger - now a yummy Japanese/Hawaiian Bakery just needs to open next door to these 2 places and I'm good.....

The inside is on the small side but not as small as other Ramen places - I lived in SF for a few yrs. and there are way smaller restaurants - almost tiny.....

Again just like the last Ramen place we ate at the decor of wood (wooden chairs, tables ect...) seem to be the trend right now.

The waitress and waiter were very attentive - constantly giving us new water even though we weren't finished with the water we already had.

I asked the BF about what something was on the menu and waitress heard me and answered my question right away - that was good knowing that she was paying attention.

Gyoza - different,tasty, but needed to be cooked longer. An order consists of 8 pieces and by the time we got to the 6th piece I noticed that the inside was not hot and too soft so when I spit it out I saw that it was still raw. The waitress showed the chef and I was asked if we wanted a new order but we declined.

*** I orderd the Lobster Ramen only sadly to be told that they were out of Lobster - That sucked!!!! ***

So I settled on the Miso Ramen while adding Buttered Corn for $2.00 (which I think is too much $ for corn) and fried garlic.The noodles were perfectly firm and yummy- I enjoyed the noodles. The broth to me could've had more taste - I know that I could've added Soy Sauce ect... But I like eating food at a place that I'm paying for without having to add flavor. I'm not saying that I didn't like it - I just think the broth needed more something.....

The BF had the Spicy Miso Ramen which had Chasu,Red Ginger,Kaiware,Fried Garlic,Spinach,Green Onions, Chile Threads, Menma and Nori. Now, one look at this soup and it looked like a party going on in that bowl!!! I tried the broth at it was OK as well. I like the Spinach and all the add-ins. 
The BF was a little turned off by all the add-ins while I on the other hand was turned on by it....
I LOVE PICKELED PLUMS!!!! So I was happy to know that you get a pickled plum in your soup but I think they should've used seedless plums cause if your not careful you could hurt yourself chopping down on one.

I was given a complementary scoop of their Black Sesame Ice Cream probably because of my raw gyoza. I am thankful though for the ice-cream. I liked the ice cream - yes it was different and a bit weird at first but once you get over the weirdness it's actually yummy....

I think the prices of the appetizers should be cheaper though....

So while our first visit was OK I will return to Shoku Ramen-ya again and hopefully get to try the Lobster Ramen,Karage Chicken wings (even though I hate wings) and the fried rice looked good as well. I like to give all new restaurants a 2nd try before I count them out because just like a new baby - there needs to be time to grow :0 crawl,walk, then run......",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,9,6,3,A5sBj9p-Q5UpxvG5kePSdA

food- ordered the spicy miso ramen- excellent (they said they didnt have the lobster miso ramen because of vendor issues)

service- excellent- always had a full glass and server checked on us frequently.. Explaining the menu, he talked a bit too fast  like he was in a hurry but still did a good job.

Price-slightly higher than other ramen restaurants I've tried. 8.50 for a regular bowl of shoyu ramen. And any extras was an add on. Bacon fried rice was good but for 7 bucks on a small plate, not really worth it.

one thing that kinda irked me..we had some leftover ramen..they didn't have large togo container lids for their large containers...so we had 6 little containers to put our ramen in.

Service - 5 stars.  The Front of the house staff ONLY and specifically were very attentive and polite, and tried to make my dining experience excellent.  Even though I had to send back food twice, they did so with professionalism and courtesy, and each time came back to check that everything was ok.  I didn't have the heart to tell them that whoever their cook/chef was that day just simply did not care about their job or their food.

Food - 0 star.  Takoyaki was overcooked with the wrong texture, too much bonito and not enough mayo on the top, and a weird old seafood flavor you find in b grade restaurants.  Gyoza (the server brought it out late to the table because even she was unimpressed with the appearance of the first effort) was under-cooked and incorrectly prepared.  It's a shame because it had excellent potential with the spicy meat stuffing.  Spicy Tonkotsu ramen was first served as a big lump of noodle that had fused together for my potion (though my associates portion was fine).  This is just disrespectful and lazy preparation, and I flagged the waitress and had it sent back.  When it was returned to me by the ""chef"", it was clear that he had simply cut out the big lump (as the noodles were significantly less and much shorter), removed some of the meat and all of the egg, and then returned it.  Truly a very disappointing overall experience.

Drink - 3 stars.  Iced Vietnamese coffee came already blended with condensed milk and didn't taste freshly made.  Still drinkable but not great.  They had a variety of other drink options to choose from.

Recommendations - sadly just avoid this place.  I feel sorry for the front of the house staff, who were all stellar, but if the chefs and cooks don't care about their product and are willing to take terrible shortcuts even when it wasn't a packed house, you can surely find better places to spend your money where the chefs and cooks actually take pride in their work.",HFMNedGJjPTo162-YSwqwQ,0,0,2,kkR0488kDor3OEkzCf8L_w

I've eaten here many times before when they were their own restaurant and was not part of Bachi burger, and I'm very familiar with their menu. We got seated real quick, but I was disappointed that we didn't seat at shoku ramen part of the restaurant, but instead we got seated at Bachi burger. It took awhile until our server acknowledge us and offered or asked for beverages. 

My mom, brother, and I ordered ramen, my brother ordered spicy miso, my mom ordered tonkotsu & sprite and I ordered tonkotsu with no mushroom & lychee soda. And I told my server, that I was allergic to mushrooms. And I knew the broth was mushroom based, but since I ate here many times before I was okay with the broth, I was just allergic to the actual mushroom. My mom didn't get her sprite right a way and my lychee soda was sooo sweet that I didn't get to enjoy it (and I always get lychee soda whenever I go to Bachi burger). We got our food and I was happy because that's what I was looking forward to. We got our food. I started to dig in and I notice that my tonkotsu ramen has mushrooms. I tried telling our server but she is nowhere to be found. And so I told the other server, that this ramen has mushrooms and I ask for no mushrooms. The server apologize and kindly took my plate away. And I have ""NEVER"" have to do that and I don't want to ""EVER"" have to do that again. And then another different server came back to our table and told me ""there is no mushrooms in my ramen"" and I showed her that this is mushrooms. At that time I was already irritated and didn't want to eat anymore. And so the server took the food and didn't even apologize. Our main sever came back with a brand new ramen, at that time I didn't want to eat anymore. With the new ramen bowl, there still was mushrooms, I didn't want to bring it back anymore and I just took out the mushrooms and hoping I don't accidentally eat one.

I have come to the conclusion that I like their rice bowls very much the ikura don and the stewed pork to be specific, and their fried rice has gotten much better.  The first time it was way to salty, but the other two much better so I could actually taste all the flavors.  The big problem is that the chefs do not use any form of measuring, so you cannot count on consistency.  I have had two of their ramen dishes the lobster and the tonkotsu.  The lobster would have been great if again it were not so salty.  Everything else in the dish was done so well so I have hope.  The tonkotsu had a weird after taste.

We returned a few days later after attempting to try Monta ramen. We couldn't handle the chaos or ""hurry up & eat"" atmosphere so we came back to the tranquility of Shoku. I think Shoku has better ramen than Monta anyways and a more enjoyable dining experience for adults. Maybe in college that hole in the wall eat and run type of place was good but not anymore. Shoku's location and food trumps any Chinatown ramen house.
I would recommend they have explanations of the different ingredients on the menu for people not familiar with theitems...even I had to get a tutorial from the waitress on a couple things. Shoku also needs to work on their ""substitution"" policy as a member of our party doesn't eat pork so we asked to omit it & just add more black garlic, to which we were told there would still be an added charge.

My girlfriend and I like to stay at an RV park on the south end of the Strip, which is right down the street from this restaurant. We usually arrive in town right around supper time, so this place made perfect sense as our first stop for some nourishment after a long drive up from Tucson.

The Plot:
We shared a bowl of Tonkotsu Shio.

The Scene:
The portion size was good and just enough for the two of us
The broth, which was pork based made with bone marrow reduction, was the star of this dish, as it should be.
You can tell the broth is really good when you keep drinking more of it then end up draining the bowl and leaving behind a mound of noodles that looks more like Mazemen than Ramen.
The soft boiled egg was also a nice, comforting addition to the bowl.


The Rest of the Story:
Our expectation at a restaurant specializing in Ramen Noodle soup was that we would be served a big bowl brimming with plenty of noodles and other ingredients, like you would be served when ordering Pho at a good Vietnamese restaurant.
My girlfriend commented about how the bowl we were served was only about  three-quarters full.
The slices of pork were few and a little overcooked so the texture was more like the consistency of noodles.

Epilogue:
The soup was quite delicious,  satisfying, and it succeed in warming us up on a chilly evening.

4562374,2012-12-11,0,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"I was very excited to see a Ramen joint open up in my neighborhood.  My latest food adventures have been taking me to Ramen places.  

Just like your other Ramen joints, the seating is a long bench against the wall, wooden tables that can be manuvered for bigger parties, and the bar nearest to the kitchen.  We were greeted very quickly with "" Irasshaimase!"" and because we came in before a rush were also seated very quickly. 

I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen combo with Rice and Pork Belly-I posted pictures for you to see if you can't make up your mind.  My fiance got a half order of Gyoza with his TonKatsu Ramen.  BTW, he is a fellow yelper so I'll let him share his own experience in his own review. 

The pork belly was okay, it is topped off with Tobiko and Nori.  Mmmm I love Tobiko.  Anyhow, reason I said okay was that it may of been a little over cooked.  Another thing, Perhaps another reason it didn't taste as good as it looked was because we were sitting close to the door, so the food actually got cold fast.   

Still, that of which I didn't finish in the rice bowl, I was eating the pork belly along with my ramen.  The Spicy Miso Ramen looked appetizing so that was what I ordered.  It was decorated with thick slices of Chasu, sprouts, garlic, greens, scallion, chile, bamboo shoots, a whole egg sliced in half, a seeded Ume, and they put a piece of Nori in your bowl.  
Chasu was over cooked, its wasn't melt in your mouth Chasu like other ramen restaurants.  Noodles may of been dropped in a little too early.  Overall, the bowl of ramen was OK, nothing that wowed me or had me sipping up the bowl.  

It is spicy maybe a spice scale from 1-10 a 5.  The broth was slightly salty.  A trick though for ramen is if it is salty, ask for more hot water.  I didn't ask for it at that time, but just a trick for ramen when it is salty.  BTW, bring yourself a toothbrush after because your breath is going to be kicking of garlic! LOL, I love garlic, but just wanted to advise you. 

The ambiance, the servers were great.  Food was ok, I probably would be back when I need to fulfill a craving for ramen if I didn't want to drive too far.  Actually I may try other things on the menu other than the ramen.  Maybe their specialty is in other dishes?",i3bLA4sEdFk8j3Pq6tx8wQ,0,0,3,RibtswVA04pgnbY-R52E_Q

I went with the basic Tonkotsu Ramen bowl with Ni Tamago added in. The broth was flavorful and quite complex. I don't have a very refined palate, but I enjoyed whatever it was I was sensing. The pork was different to what I'm used to. It had a stronger grilled flavor. So while nowhere near as tender as Monta, it was good in its own way.

Honestly, I think I prefer Sora and Monta. But being so close to work, it's an excellent lunch option. Their service was super quick and friendly too. That helps put Shoku into my work week lunch rotation.

The chicken wings were fried pretty intensely but i cant complain cause i love fried goodness.

I seem to like Sapporo style ramen much more, and this is a Hakata style restaurant.  I'm not going to pretend I knew all that, but it's what I've managed to take from reading other reviews!

The tonkotsu ramen seemed to be the thing to get at this style restaurant, so I did just that (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shoku-ramen-ya-las-vegas?select=AJjAleK3jiM_Ul3J1OFYtA#hHXDCiSoCIocVTIh0C4vjA).

The gyoza was good and tasted home made, I'll be ordering this again if I come back.  The tonkotsu broth was decent, but didn't tickle my ramen bone.  The noodles here are also the straight thin kind, and not the thicker chewy kind that I love.  The pork had a good char/grilled flavor that I enjoyed, so I can see myself getting additional pieces.

It actually only took 13 minutes to get here from Rhodes Ranch so that was plus! When we got there all the tables were taken so we sat at the empty bar. Pretty soon we were joined by other diners at the bar and I had to move my purse off the stool next to me which sucked because they don't have hooks or a little shelf to put purses on and my purse is huge. hmmm We both got tonkatsu-shoyu ramen which is not on the menu but they were able to accommodate so yay. We also got a half order of gyoza and karage chicken wings. 

-Karage Chicken Wings- 4 pieces, nicely seasoned but way too greasy. I think Fukumimi's version of serving it more as a popcorn chicken style works better. 
-Half Order of Gyoza- 3 pieces.. nothing memorable. 
-Tokatsu-Shoyu Ramen: First off, I think there was just way too little soup compared to everything else.. The broth itself tasted just like soup that you could get from a packet of .99c ramen. There was no deep, rich flavor that said oooh I've been cooking for 6+ hours instead it was just plain and boring. Maybe it was our fault for getting something not offered on the menu? The Chashu.. OMG what a disappointment... there was no melting in the mouth action what so ever. If anything it was more on the tough side and just not the business. The egg was perfectly soft boiled but more on the salty side. The only thing I liked about my ramen was the noodles. They were cooked aldente so they had a nice bite and they were of the thin variety that I like.   

Service, although very friendly, was very spotty. For instance.. When we got our gyoza we were not given a soy sauce tray, when our ramen came out they only brought 1 spoon and we had to flag her down to ask for more water... 

Something else that was weird was there were no toilet seat covers in the women's restroom... HAHAHA yea i'm weirdo so I wanted to include this in the review. but isn't that like a health code violation? idk ... 

Right now Shoku is at the bottom of our ramen list. I really want to try the lobster miso ramen which is the main reason we came here in the first place but I don't know when they will have it again.. I feel bad giving them a low review but we just weren't impressed. 

HOT TIP:  Make sure to check out the specials' board.. We forgot to ..They had a couple interesting items like kimchi ramen & tan tan men.. Also don't forget to get a stamp card.",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,5,4,2,anB4brUQ3cY1L-5phjgugw

My 4-year-old goddaughter LOVES noodles, so I decided we would give it a shot.  We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty slow.  We ordered the bacon fried rice and the buta-san tonkatsu with nitamago and extra noodles.  I wasn't expecting too much based on my past experiences, but I was REALLY pleasantly surprised.

The bacon fried rice is BOMB!  I can eat this all day.  My goddaughter did not like it because she got a spicy bite.  I didn't believe her at first because I didn't taste ANY spiciness, but then I got a bite that WAS really spicy.  The spicy bites were super random and with the entire bowl, I got maybe 3-4 spicy bites.  Still, it was SO good!  

So the ramen came.  I gave her a small bowl of noodles and just broth.  She ate it and said, ""WOW, mine is SO good!""  So I eagerly dug into mine and to my surprise, it was freakin' delicious.  It definitely tasted different from any other times I've visited.  It tasted like real authentic ramen.  Everything about that bowl of ramen was amazing.

1.  Ambiance - 4 star - Very nice small ramen place. Very modern, roomy, well lit. Could be a bit more cozy as it was a bit too sterile.

2.  Service - 4 Star - Nice. Attentive, pleasant, just right.  The people there were all spread out and there was not enough tables to join to fit 7 people, so we waited a bit and they took care of us.  A nice couple left their table and drank at the small bar so we could sit.....

3.  Food - 3 star - Pretty Good food.  Good selection and add-on's.
a.  Broth - a bit strong and rich. I respect and enjoy the authentic broth that must have been boiled forever, just that it was a bit rich.  I believe I prefer a subtle broth and this Hakata style broth I like to do at home as well, so I really was excited, just a bit rich.  Hakata is the pork bones boiled over high heat to release the flavors into the soup. 

b.  Noodles - good overall.

c.  Pork - They have pork belly (really fat)  Pork Cheek (that is what I am talking about) and the normal Tonkotsu.  Pretty good.

d.  Tori Karaage - Fried chicken wings.  Pretty good. Wiped them out and had to order another dish.

4.  Price - For some odd reason, just seemed expensive for 7 people, but perhaps I was just numerically challenged. With tax and tip, 95.00 for 5 adult and 2 kids (sharing one bowl).

I like the place, there were hardly any ""Japanese"" eaters in here, more western clientele.  I think they can use better signage and all.  Right next to Bachi Burger.  The people are very pleasant and I will come back.

4939646,2012-11-22,5,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"I had somewhat of a high expectation given favorable reviews from one of my trusted yelpers as well as from the expectations that people have from recent openings of authentic ramen-ya's in this town.  

This just shows how simple things such as Ramen is not easy to imitate by wannabes.  You can't just put mayo and yum yum sauce to cover crap up.  

I have read beforehand  that the owner of this establishment is Hawaiian Japanese nisei or sansei.  As Ramen is sort of a ""soul food"" for Japanese people, this was a source of slight concern for me, as many nisei, sansei, etc,in this country are not as well versed in the Japanese language and culture as they think they are.  But all the background info aside, I wanted to see what Bachi folks' interpretation of ramen was so here is my take on this place. 

The decor is modern chic, not very Ramen-ya like, but it's a cozy place.  The menu is written in Japanese/English, and the Japanese part of the menu gave away that the owner is not a native speaker.  My daughter and I look at each other with a look of concern, but we said ""as long as it tastes good"".....but it baffles me why the owner didn't have a native speaker proofread something as important as a menu; imagine reading a menu with a bunch of typos.  Most people won't even notice this but it tells ME something about attention to details.  

We ordered an appetizer of gyoza and I had tonkotsu, she had buta-san, which is basically a tonkotsu ramen with extra chasyu.  

Gyoza was not bad.  Not Monta quality but satisfactory.  They also have a ""gyoza sauce"", but a lot of us like to make our own by mixing soy sauce and rice vinegar along with rayu and I'm personally not very fond of pre-made ones.  

Also, you are asked whether we wanted our noodle firm or soft.  Firm, I ordered, as it should be, I""m not sure who would want a ramen noodle to be soft.   That's just wrong to me.  It's not the way ramen noodle is supposed to be.  

So the ramen....I don't even know where to start with this.  The broth was not all there. Actually, it wasn't there AT ALL.  It tasted thin, unsavory, hardly any umami, and was void of any rich tonkotsu flavor that it was supposed to have.  The menu said ""hakata-style"" but I can see someone from Hakata feeling quite insulted by this.  If I put a bunch of MSG in chicken broth it might taste like this.  

The noodle....WTF.  It was floppy, soft, and had absolutely no KOSHI, which is a term used to describe, not exactly firmness, but the quality of rebound or crispness you feel when you bite into it, and I ordered a FIRM??  I couldn't tell if this was a problem of having poor quality noodle or was just horrendously overcooked, but I have a feeling that it was both.  I think packaged ramens have better quality noodle.  

The two main components or ramen are noodle and soup/broth, just as Nigiri Sushi has rice/shari and fish/tane, and just as nigiri sushi, the harmony between those two parts is the very important 3rd component of any good ramen.  This ramen had zero out of three.  I was trying to decide between 1 or 2 stars, but I would have to go with 1 given the quality of this ramen.  It is with great sadness that I have to leave such a review, but I have to be truthful, and for those who are familiar with my reviews, I stress authenticity quite a bit, but this ramen is at a level where authenticity is not even relevant.  It's anime ramen level.  It's not something you expect out of a place that specializes in ramen.  I'm at a loss for words here.  

As much as I enjoy recent boom of authentic Japanese restaurants in this town, I just as much, if not more, resent wannabes who try to ride the bandwagon and I must say that this is one such case.  The other reviewers who spoke highly of this place should really revisit monta, sora, and fukumimi and listen to their palates.  Shoku is not in the same league as the above 3.  IMHO, it ain't even in the same ball park or the same sport.",I510KttlB4dxqER7AueQnA,21,7,1,wK8buUXZgQpnT9oGzTG7zQ

Anyways, when I took a first sip on my soup (spicy miso) it was very very very salty to the point where it was so hard to eat it. Don't get me wrong the broth was really good I wish it wasn't salty and also the noodles were so soggy. I wish the pork wasn't tough isn't it supposed to be tender because its a soup after all. After we were done eating & got home I got sick and threw up bc of all the salty soup I consumed. I really wanna like this place cause its right by the house but what the hell?

First thing we noticed was how clean the store layout was.  Everything was nicely done and had a place for it.  The only weird spot was the bar seating.  The window to the kitchen is much higher, so you're actually facing a wall should you choose to sit at the 'bar'. 

The Husband ordered the Buta-san Ramen ($9.50) with Nitamago and Toroniku Don Mini Rice Bowl ($3.50).  He was initially going to do just the ramen but the waitress did an up sell and for only three dollars more, we got a little rice bowl.  The 'Heavenly Pork"" had plenty of meat in it and the stewed pork rice bowl was very tasty.  He preferred the noodles at Shoku versus a few other ramen places we've been to in town, although he wasn't quite as impressed with the broth.

I had the Miso Ramen ($8.50) with Nitamago and Ikura Don Mini Rice Bowl ($3.50).  It's not a bad deal with the add on rice bowl and egg for $3.50.  I found the broth to be quite creamy, although I did have miso in mine.  And it was more than enough food with my added ikura rice bowl.  I had a good amount of meat in my ramen as well.

They do give you the soft-boiled egg on the side here, which I am on the fence about.  I don't particularly like it on the side because the egg is cold.  But then again, the creamy egg yolk doesn't leak into the soup right away.  I guess I could always put the egg into my soup to warm it up.

We also really enjoyed the Benishoga that's available on the table.  It's made in-house and boy, is it tasty!! The Little Guy was loving it as was I! 

Service was good - they were super attentive about making sure our water pitcher was filled and everything was fine with our lunch.  We were pleased with service.

Overall, another good ramen place in Vegas that is definitely welcomed.  We'll be back!

They offer frequent eater cards now!  Buy 10 ramens, get 1 free!  (Lobster ramen not included.)  We ordered the exact same thing this time around and this time they put the egg in the soup.  It did sit right on top, so it wasn't submerged in the soup yet.  The Husband's Buta-san Ramen had less broth in it this time around too and he had to ask for more.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,21,15,4,UrVienp5YNjsidRhubsLxg

When I saw that they share the same entrance and same menu, it was game over. I ordered the Spicy Miso. I don't think you can go wrong with any choice, but that's just how I was feeling today. The soup base was thick and creamy. I added extra spicy oil so I cannot tell you if it was actually spicy or not. The only criticism I have is the soft boiled egg was more of a medium boil, but that's ok - it was still tasty. My order covered spicy and savory. Only thing I was missing was sweet. I ordered a Coke to complete my meal. After my first gulp of a nice refreshing Coca Cola, I got a mouthgasm. Thanks. My next meal today will be a disappointment in comparison.

I let her know about my previous review,  however, she was still adamant to try it out.  I was not necessarily opposed hit, however, I remember not really liking their broth the first time. I was completely thrown off, this second time around.

David, our server was so knowledgeable. He knew about everything! Told us the difference of menu items. Corrected us on food knowledge. I was so appreciative of his attentiveness.  He was personable, articulate and made a really great experience for us!  


For starters, we got the Hakutsuru carafe unfiltered cold sake. It was served in a craft, equipped with a separate well for ice.  The unfiltered sake was refreshing, grungy and flavorful, super awesome!  For lunch, I got the fried gyoza for $6.00 and the Tonkotsu Ramen for $9.50. The gyoza was light, crispy and packed with amazing flavor!  The gyoza was stuffed with filling which was perfectly cooked and seasoned well.  As for the ramen, holy smokes!  This time was completely different than the first.  The pork belly was marbleized perfectly, the seaweed, egg and other items in the ramen were great toppers and man, the broth was on point!  Such a nice, warm, salty broth.  I was amazed!

5100265,2014-12-11,6,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"The most depressing ramen experience since... well... ever. I have never left a bowl of ramen unfinished--half my bowl remained untouched. -___-'

Ordered Shoku from the Bachi Burger side of the restaurant a couple days ago. I've been a little burger'd out lately and figured this was the perfect opportunity to try their ramen. I've been putting it off for something like 2 years. When I go to Bachi, I usually want burgers & oxtail fries--not soup! My Spicy Miso Ramen w/ Extra Menma made me wish I had just thrown my money at a burger T___T

As an appetizer, we ordered calamari. It was fine I guess.The breading was a little soft but the dipping sauces tasted pretty good. It was served with an aioli and a zingy citrusy oil. The ramen broth is alright. It's somewhat rich, saltiness is right, but the flavor is very strange. I'm not sure if they're taking a lot of liberties with their ramen or someone put something they shouldn't have in there but the flavor profile was extremely different from what I have ever had at any ramen place (in Cali or Vegas). Whatever region of Japan this came out of, something was definitely amiss. At least their noodles were good though. Good flavor, right texture, and slightly chewy. Just how I like them! **My brother ordered the Five Spice Ramen. It's more of a clear type of broth. Flavorful, healthy, if that's the kind of ramen you're into. I liked this over what I ordered.

As far as toppings, standard ingredients included 2 slices of charsiu, menma, shredded wood-ear mushroom, and sprinkling of scallion.  The spiciness of the spicy miso comes from dumping straight chili oil into the broth. Therefore, it's really not that spicy based on my comparisons with other ramen joints. The menma is the worst menma I've ever had in my life. Is this what canned or jarred menma tastes like? I've never had bamboo shoots so soft, limp, and flavorless. They were kind of gross. I was very disappointed that I had ordered extra. My brother usually orders nori in his ramen and guess what...they removed nori from their toppings menu. I asked the waitress why and she said the owners wanted to try something different... whatever.

The Charsiu: There's a bit of controversy as to ""what is good charsiu."" Some like it fatty, some like it meaty. More char, less char, etc. But what is not cool is when I'm served a bowl of ramen with 2 clean cuts of pork fat. PURE PORK FAT. No meat whatsoever. **see pic below** This was not charsiu. This was leftover fat they were trying to pass off as charsiu. Shame on you.

Prices here are a little higher than average. I'll probably never eat here again. Word on the street is the owners are spreading themselves a little thin with their expansion plan and turnover is high. I think it's safe to assume there are newbs in the kitchen and food quality is poorer than usual.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,15,6,2,IYfq-sglXzlpWcKm5bM9wA

I understand that the location has now merged with Shoku Ramen-ya and the servers might not have adjusted to the ramen menu or may not be as knowledgable about it. I myself am not a true ramen connoisseur, but I know what I like and what to order. My friend and I both ordered a bowl of ramen; I ordered tantanmen and my friend ordered the spicy miso ramen. Our waitress Annette put in our orders. About 15 minutes later another waitress dropped off our ramen, rushingly saying ""who had the tantanmen"". I slightly raised my hand and she placed the bowl in front of me. She then assumed my friends bowl was in her hand and rushingly said ""this is tonkatsu"" and rushed away from our table. My friend asked what she said and I thought I misheard her but I knew tonkatsu did not sound anything like spicy miso. We knew, however, that it was not her bowl because it contained egg, broth that did not look spicy at all, and other ingredients that were not supposed to be in the spicy miso ramen. We then asked a male waiter who told us what they were but he was quickly brushed off by our waitress Annette who said ""oh these bowls are correct but you guys just have each other's bowls"". She then switched our bowls and left us confused. I then went on yelp to look at the pictures of the ramen dishes we ordered while my friend dived into the dish in front of her. I found a pic of my dish which was now the dish with the egg and unknown ingredients, it looked nothing like the tantanmen dishes that people posted pictures of. We then called the waitress Annette over and she said ""these bowls are correct, this is what you ordered"" so we asked for a menu and she showed us on the menu what we ordered. Our ingredients did not match the ingredients on the menu! But she insisted they did and we said the spicy miso isn't even spicy. ""She then said it's not supposed to be very spicy. Then we asked why does it have extra ingredients in it. So she said well the chefs must've just added extra products and that it would only cost US a couple more dollars, as she laughed it off. At this point she started blaming us for the switch and tried to give me back the tantanmen that my friend, who was starving, had already eaten quite a bit out of. She kept saying ""well you guys were confused but it is correct so you can switch up the bowls again, this is in fact what you ordered"". We KNEW what we ordered and this was not it. We asked to speak to a manager. The manager came to our table and said ""so I heard that there was a mix up between you two but it is now resolved"". We told her it was not resolved and we explained to her what happened. She then suggested that her waitress and staff were correct and that we should just switch the bowls back. She then lifted the bowl that my friend had been eating out of and tried giving it back to me. How unprofessional to assume that I want to eat out of a bowl that's already been eaten out of and pay full price for it. I stopped her before she placed it down in front of me and we asked for different bowls. She then said ""let me talk to my cooks and see if there was in fact a mix up"". She finally came back to our table and said ""oh, there was a mix up actually because another table ordered almost the same ramen as you, and you two got their orders"" she then agreed to give us new ramen bowls. Then our waitress came back and said ""I am sorry that you were confused and I will take off one of the ramens for you, is there anything else I can get for you?"" We said no, we just want our ramen so that's it. They brought us the correct ramen and the check. The check did not comp us like Annette said it would. I then asked what happened to the comped bowl and she said ""oh no actually you are going to be paying full price for what YOU ordered"". We were then so frustrated that we paid and left.

The menu is a little bit pricey overall and are actually part of Bachi Burger too - when I went it was a bit confusing because the door was under construction..so you had to enter through Bachi Burger's entrance and state where you wanted to eat and then they'd guide you to a table.

I walked in with my brother and wait time was about 15 minutes. We sat down in the corner and we noticed A LOT of flies just flying there. It was a bit bothersome for us but we tried to brush it off.

First off, service was okay. Nothing special about it. We ordered a kalbi burger, oxtail fries, and a miso ramen. The server said the kitchen was a little busy so it might take awhile. So she insisted to get the fries to start as a appetizer for something to munch on while we wait for the burger and ramen. It was about 15 minutes, and we got the burger first. We got confused because we thought appetizers were supposed to come out before the main meal. However, we weren't losing our minds over it. 

We were starving, so we halfed the burger and decided to eat that while waiting for the other food. About 5 minutes later, the Miso Ramen came out. Yet, still no fries. Hmmm.. okay then. After 10 more minutes, after we finished the burger already and I was half way through the ramen, the fries finally come out. Interestinggggg. 

 Since I'm not sure if Bachi and Shoku are really together, I won't go on with a lot of details with the burger (however it was tasty.) But the main reason why I'm giving this place two stars was because of the ramen. I was entirely disappointed with it. The soup was really bland. I felt like instant noodles was tastier than this.

I had Tan Tan Meh (it wasn't on the menu but I had it last time. Tan tan meh is quite spicy-in a good way. It was still good- but it wasn't like the first version (back then it was on the menu & had seafood (shrimps & scallops) and the broth was exquisite! This one had just a bland piece of pork & that's all for the meat.  It was still good but not near as good. 

My husband has Shoyu Ramen.  The Shoyu Ramen broth wasn't very flavorful at all either. It also had the one long bland piece of pork. Meh 

The noodles and the veggies were good but couldn't hold up the ramen by themselves. 

Overall, it was ok but I really think I would try somewhere else next time. If we're just looking for a delicious soup, we will go to the Galanga Thai restaurant (see my review)  just up Blue Diamond-they weren't on Food Network but their food is really good. Maybe places try harder when they are just coming up?",2z2A6ayPZmlVwZFK-uz60w,0,0,3,o8Uyr5RWy_uw2cYcXZYE8A

5599542,2013-12-06,1,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"It has been some time since I been back here...call me a victim of demographics.  Additionally, I thought that I completed a review here then, but I guess my foodie ADD got the better of me...either that or I was too busy enjoying my meal.  

It looks like the menu has changed significantly and has added seasonal specials.  It must be tough being right next door to Bachi Burger, but they are sister companies if I'm not mistaken, so call it sibling rivalry.  

I consider this place one of the trilogy of ramen spots in the upper echelon of the ramen game.  The other spots include Monta and Fukumimi respectively.  I see all these other ""puppy mill"" ramen shops that never seemed to get my attention (via Yelp, anyway).  I'm sure there may be a soupy gem out there that I may be overlooking.

Okay so out comes my bowl of tonkotsu shoyu ramen  [pause] ""nom nom nom.""  Shoots pau!  Today's offering was...pretty good and just what tamed the craving for this near freezing day.  The bowl was presented very well and included chashu, bamboo shoots, nori, an egg and of course...ramen noodles and broth.  I am not a fan of bean sprouts and glad it was not included.

The ramen was pretty good from the outset.  The noodles were just the right amount of firmness, the shoots weren't cold and the chashu....whooo #trinidadjames.  It almost looked like the thinly sliced pork belly was an abnormal sized square of pork belly tataki.  It almost tasted seasoned, but not exactly sure and failed to ask.  Either way, it was not your traditional chashu and very delicious.

I love the bossa nova Brazilian jazz lounge music playing as well, pretty sure it was Astrud.  The ambience and decor is very similar to most ramen joints and closely resembles fukumimi, just slightly larger.  

The waitresses look like they could be part time dealers at the Palms, adorned with full sleeve tats, but are very friendly nonetheless.  

I think this was a calling to try to come back way more often and saddened that it's been so long since my last visit.  Perhaps I can convince the wifey with the miso hamachi taco special.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,1,0,4,JjtO2hJlLwHZeT7-eFBHdg

It was a cold Tuesday night.  My friends and I had just done a training run around the District at Green Valley and looked forward to some ramen to warm us up afterwards.  This new place is right next to Bachi Burger on Windmill, so it's nice to have a ramen joint on that side of town.  It was my friend Brian's first time having ramen that wasn't Top Ramen, so the menu was a puzzler.  Our waiter, Ehren, did an awesome job of breaking it down, though, explaining the differences between their style of noodle versus other types of ramen (like the style at Monta, though he didn't name that place) and other items on the menu.  I'm no ramen expert, but I've been to both Monta and Ramen Sora here in town as well as Ramen Jinya in L.A. and none of those places had Lobster Miso Ramen on their menus, so that's what I had.  It was a bowlful of bliss.  Brian had the same thing and the next thing I knew, his bowl was empty--pretty good for a ramen virgin.  The noodle style (again, no expert am I) can be compared to noodles in... Top Ramen.  Of course, Top Ramen is nothing like this, but to illustrate for average Joes and Janes who've been to the other ramen places I'm referring to, Shoku's noodles are kinda curly and thin, not thick and straight.  Either way, my friends and I enjoyed our first Run/Ramen night and look forward to more.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,2,4,4,EFTJwag-B-YxSBRpDcVMxQ
5659574,2012-11-26,1,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"With the recent popularity and boom of ramen joints around Vegas, my expectations for Shoku were probably a tad higher than they should have been. Upon entering, there was no music playing, and the lack of chatter among customers made the place seem a little awkwardly quiet (jazz music began playing a little later, though).

The waitresses were obviously new and/or inexperienced. I ordered the spicy miso and my friend ordered the tonkotsu ramen with a side of gyoza. The waitress confidently presented our respective dishes - dishes that we almost immediately realized were switched. That could have just been a little mistake instead of a lack of knowledge, though.

The ramen was what ultimately made me decide to give Shoku three stars. I chose my noodles ""firm"" and didn't expect to find a thick clump of noodles still stuck together in the middle of my meal. The chashu was not the soft texture I was used to, which made me a little disappointed.The broth was actually better than expected though - not too salty with a decent kick of spice. It was nice that ramen already came with a few toppings as well.

The gyoza were meh. They probably would have tasted better if they were hot and fresh but instead seemed cold and dejected. 

On a random note, I was childishly fascinated with the sesame grinder they had on the table. The tables were also nice and clean and new. I spent a good 5 minutes stroking it...

All in all, Shoku is just okay. We decided to stop by only because we were already sort of in the area but if I were to choose, I would not go out of my way when there are so many ramen places closer to my house.",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,3,2,3,F7hT0nBy5MWsT5RmJ25tDA

But, since he had already gone, he made sure to guide me in the right direction. I really never knew ramen could be made to creatively and with so much flavor! I have only been here 2 times now, and both times I have tried something vastly different.

I ordered tokotsu shio ramen and added corn and the total was about $12.  This is more than I normally like to pay for ramen.  Also it took about 25 minutes to arrive, which is longer than I normally like to wait.  GOOD LORD I am just UN-PLEASE-ABLE aren't I?

The noodles were absolutely perfect and the broth was delicious. My problem with this ramen is the chasu.  

Perhaps I have been spoiled by Sora's thick and tender chasu....or by Monta's huge chasu...or Fukumimi's velvety chasu.  But this place's chasu was bad.  It was paper-thin and looked like they threw it on the grill right before they served it.   It was oddly sweet and was more fat than meat.  I did not enjoy it.

I didn't try the broth before putting in sauces the first time but I did the second time. It got a bit salty after my sauce add-ons the second time. Oops :b. The broth is okay, though, but doesn't really stand out to me.

Overall, their noodles weren't anything special and it didn't taste all that great. They used to let you pick the texture (hard or soft kind of thing) of the noodles but according to a waiter, they stopped doing that because people complained. Ridiculous guests (for complaining)! 

I tried asking the server to make my noodles hard on my second visit but he had a look that was making me question my memory, lol. However, we ended up asking another server later on and he was VERY informative. He let us know that they will indeed be doing Tan Tan Men in the near future but there's no set date yet. 

I also tried the black sesame ice cream cause of the reviews/tips but it wasn't my kind of thing. If you get it, make sure you like black sesame, at least :0b.

Overall, I'm not sure if I'd go back here.. maybe if I was on this side of town and wanted ramen. Otherwise, I doubt I will be back anytime soon.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,2,0,3,v6Xvli5wMj5wixfxsH5vXA

One of the best ramen I've tasted 
This is located right next door to Bachi Burger. It was another cold night and I wanted something warm in my belly. They certainly did that. 

Here's the rundown:
Seared Hamachi - delicious. A carpaccio with citrusy notes. My only quibble is you only get 4 pieces. More please. 

Takoyaki - octopus balls. Octopus pieces in a crepe like batter and cooked into a ball. It was very tasty and the Unagi sauce? was perfect with it. 

Bacon Takana Rice - bacon fried rice. This I didn't like. It was on the dry side and not much bacon flavor IMO. Not a lot quantity wise too.

Tonkatsu Ramen - hit the spot on a cold winters night. The broth was so delicious. It came with pork belly and you know me and pork. Yummy!! Noodles were perfect.

Buta-San Ramen - also good, but to be honest it was basically the same as the Tonkatsu ramen to me. The same broth. The only difference to me was the extra toppings for this ramen (sorry, I could not identify the extra topping it had). Still very good, thanks to the broth. 

I had this to go, so service was efficient. 
The place was on the small side, A row of tables on one side and the kitchen on the other.
Pricing: it is on the high side. They do skimp on the product.
Ambiance: good for a date 

If you want a good ramen, you've found your spot. Everything else was just okay. 
3.5 stars, rounding up (thanks to the ramen broth)
I'll definitely be back (just for the ramen)",R_xjmz2nZgyOkqFKPmkjnA,12,12,4,727stmc0qF0B-UVutKujCA

I ordered the Lobster Ramen which has both pork and lobster.  While the ramen might stand on its own fine in Vegas, it doesn't rate against the better ramen shops back in Hawaii (Yotteko-ya, Gomaichi, etc...)

In simple terms, the pork was not nearly as tender as I am used to, and I thought the broth was good but not great.  I would compare the broth to Lucky Belly's back home--nothing special...

5939159,2012-12-19,10,-K82LBrI3H0FVuhTbNDpRA,"I got a reputation around Yelp when it comes to Ramen. I've eaten at every major Ramen-Ya on the West coast, so I got a lot of credibility when it comes to recognizing a good bowl of Ramen. So my assessment is that: SHOKU RAMEN-YA doesn't have a good bowl of Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen...SHOKU has a GREAT bowl of Hakata Tonkotsu. 

Things have changed a lot here in the last month. I came here over a month ago during their soft opening,  and the manager was still training the cooks and servers to be more proficient. Today when I came to SHOKU, everything had been perfected. I have to congratulate the new manager(Ehren) for working non-stop around the clock, and dedicating his whole life into turning this place into one of the best Ramen-Yas in Las Vegas. The flavor of the Hakata Tonkotsu was a world of difference from last month! You can really taste the pork bones and marrow from them preparing the broth all day long in that traditional Kyushu style. 

The Charsu has changed as well. It's very soft, fatty, and tender like the ones you get at Onizuka Street. I loved it! 

Unlike 99% of the Ramen-Yas in LV, SHOKU actually has a Hanjuku Egg as one of their add ons. This is big! This really BIG!  Monta, Sora, and Shuseki only have normal medium-boiled eggs. A Hanjuku egg needs a lot of work to prepare correctly. It needs to be boiled for exactly 7 minutes to preserve it's extremely runny nature, then it must be instantly placed into ice water or the egg will continue to cook itself and the yolk will be ruined.Afterwards it's transferred to a mixture of shoyu, sugar, and sometimes vinegar. It will then be marinated for many hours. SHOKU is the only Ramen-Ya in Vegas that features this style of egg. It's a very rare delicacy here in LV. 

The Bacon Fried rice was the best Japanese fried rice I have ever had. Better than Monta...Better than Yagyu Yakinku..Better than Shuseki. The Bacon Rice here at SHOKU RAMEN-YA is a perfect fusion blend of flavors. It has the buttery qualities of Hibachi Fried Rice(ex-Benihana), but with much stronger and unique added flavors. Because SHOKU is a Bachi Burger spinoff, their cooks do fusion better than anyone. 

The manager of this restaurant told me that in a few weeks they will add Tan Tan Men onto the menu. I was like HOLY SH!T THIS IS HEAVY! Every Yelper knows that Tan Tan Men is my favorite Ramen variation in the world. I've been to every major Ramen-ya on the westcoast and only like 8 of them had Tan Tan Men. For those who don't know, Tan Tan Men is a very difficult dish to master for any chef. That's why there are Ramen-Yas that specifically specialized in ONLY Tan Tan Men. I've been to Chinese-Japanese Ramen houses where TTM was the only thing on the menu because the chef needed to put all his attention in only that one thing. I can't wait to see the SHOKU variation of Tan Tan Men. Ehren is one of the most talented restaurant managers in Las Vegas, and I'm confident that his staff can master this difficult variation. 

I encourage all the Nisei, Sansei, and Yonsei to come eat here, especially if you are from Hawaii. Every Japanese born in Hawaii I have spoken to have told me that SHOKU is one of the best Ramen-Yas on the mainland. There is something about the flavors here at SHOKU that make Hawaiians happy. I know that many of my Japanese-Hawaiian Yelp friends would love this place. 

Also, remember that this is a Kyushu style Ramen-Ya so it would be a travesty to order something that wasn't Tonkotsu. You don't go to a Sapporo Ramen house and not order the Miso. You don't got to a Tokyo Ramen house and not order the Shoyu. You don't go to a Chinese-Japanese Ramen house and not order the Tan Tan Men. And you defiantly should not go to a Hakata Ramen-Ya and not get the Tonkotsu. Tonkotsu is the signature dish of Hakata, Kyushu.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,22,12,5,wMs_p2f7fmxTh2zGplN8Vg
