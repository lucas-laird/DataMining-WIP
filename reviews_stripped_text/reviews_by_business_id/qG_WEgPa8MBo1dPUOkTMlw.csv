So I can only say it's okay. We like eating food with adequate amount of fat but this Double Double was way too greasy, we think the grease amount was beyond appropriate, which gave a negative effect on the burger overall. I think the grease was from the making of the food. 

We definitely don't crave for In-N-Out burgers, we might come again only due to 1) convenience or 2) running out of options or 3) very very low budget.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,0,0,3,3m1dRXtCRc6ie_ZZnsFxIA

Both burgers had thick stale bread that overwhemed the beef and fell apart, and just was not up to the In & Out standard.  Lastly the grilled onions were not grilled enough to take the crunch out of them.  
None of this I expect from this company.
This location has a company store and warehouse on site so I would expect the standard to be at it's Highest level.

Animal fries, cheese, grilled onions and thousand island dressing ( whoopee) I don't care for it.

The fries are fresh cut , they have a different texture , not as crisp , or as good as mcdonalds, before U   scoff and write off my review , because I like mcdonalds fries...

We noticed that the place was not overly advertised in the decor; its simplicity is enough to get the message across that you're here for the food and not for the decor. 

We noticed that they really do have a system in place. We saw how a team of people really gel and work together. It was welcoming to see how right they all work together and the care they take to make everything. 

We saw them slicing the potato to be cooked fresh. How the hamburgers were being built with precision. It was just amazing to see. 

The food was really good. We ordered a double cheeseburger that was really tasty. A simple touch of toasting one side of the bun gave our burger that nice crunchy taste (not too much but just enough) where others just get soggy, especially towards the end of the burger, not this place. 

If you have the opportunity, make this a place that you simply must try.

i was stoked to hear that a new in-n-out formed on trop and fort apache, an in-n-out less than 10 min drive from my house! (other in-n-outs i would have to drive no less than 15 min). so i decided to check this new location out yesterday. it was my first time eating in-n-out this year since i was in philly attending school. I had my fair share of descent quality fast food restaurants in philly (five guys, 500 degrees) but none of them come close to in-n-out status...whenever i would go to a fast food restaurant in philly, the in-n-out song would always play in my head...""in-n-out...IN-N-OOOUUUTTT! thats what a hammmburgers allll about!!"" thats how much i missed it...

anyways, this is what i usually get: double-double, animal style (chopped and grilled onions) with extra lettuce and tomatoes (no extra charge), fries, and a coke. if im in the mood for it, i ask for animal style fries (chopped/grilled onion and their ""special sauce"" added to the fries) and a strawberry milkshake. i also usually ask for extra spread (their packaged ""special sauce"") and chili peppers (if you like some spice to your meal). their buns are always perfectly toasted, their meat patties are always flavorful and juicy, their vegetables are always fresh and tasty, and their special sauce is to DIE for...and the fact that around $5 will get you a meal makes me think...why even think about going to another fast food joint?

if you're the type who can't read long posting like this, ill try to make it as simple as possible:
- ask me what my favorite movie of all time? I DONT KNOW
- my favorite song of all time? NO CLUE

Typical cookie cutter location, which is perfectly fine. There was plenty of parking in the shared shopping center and it was easy to access from the freeway. Nice.

Double double animal style - perfect. I love the extra veggies and pickles and how wet the burger is.
Double double w/ raw onion - excellent. Loved the flavor of the raw onions. Was a little dry in comparison to the animal style. Maybe I should get animal style with raw onions?!

1109265,2016-06-15,1,qG_WEgPa8MBo1dPUOkTMlw,"I have eaten In-N-Out Burgers several times, but fail to see the almost cult-like following. Don't get me wrong, every burger has been well made, tasty, with fresh ingredients. If in the mood for a burger and an In-N-Out is nearby, I will stop in and grab some quick grub.  But this is not the best burger in the known Universe by a long shot.

My less than informed guess as to the fascination is because of three key reasons: (1) So many people have fond memories of eating In-N-Out as a child; (2) The ""secret"" menu and ordering makes many feel like they are privy to a secret society; (3) Those on the east coast have often only heard of this chain restaurant through office conversation, and through legends passed down by elders at night by the fire.  Oh, there might be a fourth reason; many think it is a good burger, but are afraid to take on In-N-Out fanatics by suggesting there are other equally good burgers available to our civilized society.

Now, while the burgers are fresh and good, the french fries (not animal fries or some other version) are boring and in my opinion as a three generation french fry expert are not very good.",U2cNYvPy5EHkBsp-GIsXaQ,0,0,4,uKVn6Iix7bIpHzx6GCnFxw

1162051,2010-08-05,0,qG_WEgPa8MBo1dPUOkTMlw,"This is my favorite fast-food burger joint.   The menu is small and simple, with just a few items,.  This simplicity is definitely a virtue because it helps In-N-Out to maintain its commitment to high quality ingredients.  Their beef, for example, contains no additives, fillers, or preservatives.  This is important to me because I will rarely eat meat anymore unless I know it's free of sodium nitrate.  

The burger comes with beef, crisp whole-leaf iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and thinly sliced onions with a sauce which seems to consist of  mayonnaise, ketchup and relish.  With cheese, it's only 359 calories.

The fries are made from potatoes that are peeled and diced at each store and cooked fresh in 100% trans-fat free, cholesterol-free vegetable oil.  There are no small, medium, large, or ""biggie"" options.  You just get a well-proportioned cardboard boat of fries. 

In-N-Out doesn't use heat lamps or microwaves because the burgers and fries are cooked fresh to order.  

In-N-Out is also one of those rare fast-food restaurants that make their milk shakes with real ice-cream. 

Their commitment to quality and simplicity translates into great tasting food, and also allows them to keep the prices low.  Being on a student's budget, this is one of my favorite things about In-N-Out Burger.  A hamburger is $175, with cheese it's $2.05.  An order of fries is only $1.35.  And a milkshake is just $1.95.

Another thing about In-N-Out is that there's almost always a long line of cars at the drive-thru when you arrive, but because of the distance between the ordering station and the pick-up window, you rarely have to wait long to order.  The line moves fast and your order is timed to be ready when you get to the pick-up window.  So don't let the long lines deter you.

Because of their great tasting burgers, quality ingredients, and low prices, I'm giving In-N-Out Burger the highest rating I could give to any fast-food restaurant -- 4 stars.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,0,0,4,HLn2DvF7_TJctBxZYSyIYQ

Cheaper than Carl's Jr.
Better than Fatburger in pretty much every way.

FOOD: 5/5 stars

This has to be one of if not the best tasting fast food burger in America.  The flavors of the cheese, lettuce, sauce and hamburger work so well together and the bun is just melt in your mouth, double D delicious.  The fries actually taste like fresh cut potatoes, not that mashed together again fake fries a lot of fast food joints serve. 

my double double with animal style fries! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qG_WEgPa8MBo1dPUOkTMlw?select=FT9xeB10CA3NEO03SwdIqw

PRICE: 5/5 stars

Fast food is suppose to be cheap, when you start paying over $10 for a fast food meal for a processed product that is not healthy for you, something has gone wrong with America.  In-N-Out has very cheap reasonable prices for the quality of ingredients that they use.  When you actually taste their burgers, you'll realize how much better it tastes than the big fast food american chains.  You won't be disappointed.

VARIETY: 4/5 stars

Okay so if you're looking for a chicken wrap, chicken bowl, salad, or hot dogs, etc.. LOOK ELSEWHERE.. This is not sonic with their 128,000 choices for drinks, this is In-N-Out where you come here for a damn good hamburger and fries.  What they lack in variety they make up in their secret menu.  You can take a look at the link below for a list of the secret menu, I will give my caveat here by saying i have not tried to order all the different secret menus, but if i lived in a place where i could eat In-N-Out regularly, I'd try to get them all..

INTANGIBLES: 5/5 stars

I've eaten a lot of fast food and I can honestly say that In-N-Out is the only place that I do not feel so guilty after eating a meal.  Yes it is still a burger and yes they still deep fry their potatoes but at least there are no additives in their food.  You are eating a quality product for a super cheap price.

My negative review is a result of making a rather non-complex order and having only two vehicles ahead of me.  It was on a Saturday around 12:00 in the PM. I just want to note that the inside of place was not slammed by any stretch.  I sat there for over 10 minutes watching all the employees not move with any sense of urgency.

The fries, as far as appearance goes, reminded me of McDonald's fries, but at least I saw the people actually placing the potatoes in the potato slicing machine. Can't beat that. All four of us still believe that there must be some type of drug in the animal sauce, because it left me wanting more burgers and fries.

A couple of my friends also got the well-done fries. That and a couple of protein burgers might be in order next time. With more animal sauce, of course.

There's a video of me eating the food. You know, just to document my initiation. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWuBDFVgK1w)

Unfortunately, I passed on the shakes this time. The panda can't handle excess dairy. The cheese in the burgers was enough. I do hear the shakes are good, though.

I'm a fan and I'll definitely return. Gotta tackle more of the secret menu next time!",oN23cWAm6Umyp19BTCc-QA,6,3,4,Q87aJqDLH8LOvEZGynURbA

Burgers are delish. Fries are hot and fresh. And shakes are thick and tasty. Their menu is pretty simple; it's just burgers, fries and drinks. And they also have the not-so-secret ""secret"" menu. My go to order is a 3x1 (3 patties, one cheese) animal style (patty cooked in mustard) with raw onions instead of grilled and no tomato. No matter where I go, I know quality will be the same. 

What stands out at this location is the customer service. They are always fast, friendly and efficient. During one of my visits, I was standing near the counter waiting for my to-go order and this angry customer stormed up to the counter. He claimed that his burger was raw and showed the female employee the half eaten burger. I saw the burger and I assure you it was not raw. The female employee was very friendly and patient with the irate customer and gave him a new burger even though he proceeded to eat the old one he was complaining about. Some people are just a**holes, but the female employee took it in stride and kept smiling. Props to her. Also, their drive thru goes by pretty quickly even with the long line of cars.

It was the single greatest fast food meal in the history of civilization. Even though I was full, I immediately ate another Double-Double. I was nearly in tears at this meal, it was so transcendently excellent. Those #*&!@'s should hire me as a spokesman.""

Only in Vegas where you can see a Inn-N-Out sign in neon lights!!!   

This location has both dine-in and drive-through.  This is the In-N-Out that everyone sees on their way to Las Vegas.

I have never had a bad burger at In-N-Out.

Cheese burger animal style with extra toasted buns, gilled and raw onions.

And the only thing you could find in the frat house refrigerator was a bag of frozen french fries that had been in there since your freshman year. But being desperate, you threw them in the oven at 500 degrees ('cause you just couldn't imagine waiting 15 minutes to eat). And then you burned yourself on the pan when you pulled them out, but you were too stoned to feel the pain (although you were quite certain you were going to feel it in the morning). Do you remember how, after just a few bites of what might just be the nastiest thing you ever ate, you threw them in the garbage and thought to yourself, ""What's the use? What's the point to all of this? Why do I even bother? Why do I even go on"" And when you woke up late the next afternoon, you went straight down to the registrar's office and changed your major to philosophy. Then you started getting drunk and smoking pot every night with that long-haired old guy who hangs out at the bar, the guy who never showers and always hits on the freshmen girls who sneak in on the weekends; only to find yourself dropping out of college a few months later because you just couldn't disseminate the intellectual struggle between being and nothingness, and your professors were just too stupid to understand you. And now, 20 years later, you're living back home in your parents house, unable to keep a job and drinking away your paycheck every night in that same college bar. And when you look at yourself in the broken bathroom mirror you suddenly realize that you have become that old, smelly drunk who still hits on college girls. And you look back at your life and think to yourself -

""If only I'da skipped those fries, everything in my life would be different now.""

Trust me, those fries were gourmet compared to In-N-Out Burger's. They tasted like powdery, freezer burned match-sticks that had been reheated under a heat lamp - it was difficult to tell if they were made from potatoes or from some Star Trek food simulator machine.

My burger was equally disgusting. It is fair to say the only part of the burger that did not suck was the lettuce. The bun was stale and dry, the browned skin of the bun's top peeled off like 60 year old wallpaper from an old pickle factory, leaving what looked and tasted like a frozen bun that was thawed on high in the microwave..

I have nothing to complain about with the vanilla shake - at last, nothing to complain about.

In all told, my last visit to In-N-Out Burger was as disappointing as anything you could imagine. My guess is, there IS a limit to how much you can cut-back on quality just to save a dime. It's a shame for such an iconic brand.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,10,9,1,2VweJh5sMNm6zdj2aZ9PLA

My friends and I actually wanted to walk from our hotel (Monte Carlo) to the In-N-Out in the area when we first arrived in Vegas. We decided it wasn't a good idea and we'd make our venture there another day since we were already too hungry at the time. Well the next day, we took a cab from our hotel to In-N-Out which was basically less than a 5-minute ride. Our cab drive did warn us about this specific franchise because of the long lines but we decided we'd brave it. The line and wait wasn't too horrible and we got our food within 15 minutes. I ordered the double double and fries with a vanilla milkshake. It was pretty great. Next time I'll order 3x3 and the fries with cheese (I know animal style is probably best but I'm not a fan of all the stuff they put in it unfortunately). I was also expecting them to charge a hefty price but it was a cheap and good meal. Definitely gotta try it when you're in the west coast and close to one. But for some reason I'm more partial to Shake Shack in NYC even though it's so much more expensive but it could just be because I can't completely compare the two side by side or that i'm biased to the east coast.

Call me crazy - but I DO NOT think in - n - out is the best burger.  It's OK, and thats where it ends.

Burgers and pizza are long time debated food items.  The truth of the matter is, it depends how you like it.  In this case, it depends what you like on your burger.  Since I'm not a fan of slices of cheap raw tomato with snotty tomato goo in the middle, crappy iceburg lettuce, and mystery hot orange sauce, in - n -out is not my burger style.  I'm more of a bacon, sliced avocado, sauteed mushrooms kind of a gal.

The meat and cheese at in-n-out is good.  The patties are flavorful and juicy and the cheesy is melty and generous.  But if you don't like their ALL-American (aka boring) toppings, that's all you get.

The fries suck - plan and simple.  I ordered fries at an in-n-out once; never again.  Now, I just stick to a burger. 

Also, plan on waiting a MINIMUM of 20 minutes just for 1 burger - even at the drive through.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,2,1,2,WK1hDYAlFAZnhJQ14z4iaw

I reside in LA County home of the in n out burger,  and frankly as much as I love in n out, this location by far is not up to par with the many other locations I've been to. My girlfriend lives no more than 1 mile away, and today's experience has made me decide to review this place. 

First off,  the design of how the drive thru is makes it difficult for dine in customers to park on the side where it begins.  As the line gets long,  you would be stuck in your parking space with dumb drivers still blocking you as you're halfway out of your space.  Yes this just happened to me. 

Now for my food. Presentation is pretty much standard for all locations. I got my normal,  post workout meal of a cheeseburger,  mustard fry,  whole grilled onions and a double meat,  whole grilled onions and lettuce wrapped and man do I regret getting it lettuce wrapped.  The lettuce doesn't even wrap around the meats,  and for being whole grilled onions,  I got a measly two rings of onions???  Really?!  Ugh. My cheeseburger was alright I guess since pretty much tastes the same as all the other places I've been to.  

The workers were friendly so that's a plus,  and was quick to open an additional register once the dine in line became long. The workers and cleanliness off the location is the only thing that stopped me from giving this place 2 stars. 

I don't ask for much from in n out,  just the same quality and comfort that you get at every location.",22D4m1dOd3C9QMrxPIzbHg,1,0,3,7MwJrwGGJsfDW1xbr1KduQ

My usual - a cheeseburger with light spread, grilled onions, add pickles. Their burgers are perfection in a fast food burger.

I've been once before and I wanted to make sure and try it again.  The wait wasn't as bad as I thought it would be at midnight.  Decided to park and order takeout from the counter.

Ordered a Double-Double animal style, animal style fries well done, and a Neapolitan shake.  It took about 10 minutes for the order to be filled so it's not necessarily fast food.  Took the order with me and went to my hotel to check in so I didn't get to dig into everything for another half hour.  The burger was very good.  Tasty and juicy, a decent size offering and very affordable.  The fries were another story.  I wanted to try them well done and by the time I got to them they were ROCK HARD.  Now I'm not sure if this was because I waited a half hour to dig into them or they are normally this way when you order them well done.  Even ordering them animal style did not soften them up.  I wasn't impressed with the fries the first time I went to In-N-Out so I guess my opinion has gotten worse.  The shake was good, nothing to go WOW about.

If you could kindly cut me some slack, I'm going to admit here on the Internet that (up until a few months ago), I have always been a wee bit of a burger snob. At most every burger joint, I would order a hamburger with nothing but the meat and bun. No lettuce or tomato, no onion or pickles and definitely no condiments whatsoever... I know. You despise me. You think I'm a weirdo.

On rare occasions, I'd try something new, but a lot of the time--just the meat and bun, like plain vanilla. And here at In-N-Out, I'd either have that or a grilled cheese, fries, and a shake.

After finally deciding to put an end to my picky habits, I marched over to this location and had my very first, real In-N-Out hamburger (not the Double-Double... Baby steps! Baby steps!)... And, god, it was freaking awesome. I now find myself craving In-N-Out a lot...

Please don't think I can be fooled...especially when you hand me the cup and it's got some pink ""strawberry"" colored stuff dripping all over the lid!

4632152,2012-06-26,2,qG_WEgPa8MBo1dPUOkTMlw,"Why spend a fortune on burgers at Johnny Rockets when you could have them just as great here for a fraction of the price? 

For 2 burgers, 2 orders of fries, a vanilla milkshake and 1 order of animal-styled fries (with grilled onions, thousand island dressing and cheese), our total added up to less than $15 and it fed 3 very hungry hannahs - stuffed and contented!

If you're a first-timer, you will find the menu a little too simple - at least that was what I thought 3 years ago when I was new in Vegas. Don't be too quick to judge. What makes In-n-out so interesting is the fact that they have a secret menu (envision a burger entitled 'the flying dutchman'!) and you can have it at a snap of a finger. Everything is served fresh, all the braches I've been to have been spotless and the staff always have a bright smile on their faces. At the same time, you get this whole 60s diner feel that I instantly associate with Johnny Rockets (and thus the comparison) every time I enter, only not with the dancing staff. 

Great place to take the family after church service, or hang out with a group of friends. Their milkshake is made from ice-cream by the way, so just a heads-up, sipping it through a straw may not be the easiest thing in the world.",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,3,2,5,iGST6UXllbeO1zQCWotBfw

There are 2 classes of burgers, the thin patties, simple, clean flavors which In-N-Out serves. Then you have the restaurant gourmet burgers that tends to be big beef patties with lots of ingredients, more complicated, flavors aren't clean though. Both are still delicious. This is like arguing over Deep Dish Pizza vs Thin Crust pizza. Note that to pull off the simple flavors, it requires to have really good ingredients, which includes good meat patties, cheese, and veggies. In-N-Out usually does this well.

Like most other In-N-Out locations you usually will get great food and service. But the couple of times I went, I have some not so perfect service and food for In-N-Out standards. Despite this, it is still a lot better than some other fast food places.

You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, burgers, shakes, or fries. But things get interesting when you start ordering off the secret menu. 

What I order now is: 3x2 Protein Style No Salt w/ Grilled Onions and Animal Style Fries. 1 less cheese makes it less filling. The lack of salt keeps the burger from drying out. The protein style is really so you can taste the ingredients, since the buns just get in the way.

Double-double animal style. Crunchiest lettuce one has ever crunched, ripe tomato, 2 x juicy beef patty cooked in mustard, 2 x american cheese, thousand island, and grilled onions. This beast was to die for. Really though, heart attack is imminent but so worth every morsel. Each burger patty is made to order. Also, according to their website they do not own a freezer, microwave, or heat lamp. And their burger patties have no filler or preservatives of any kind. Pretty cool. And in this case, a little goes a long way. You can taste the quality difference in their product compared to any other fast food restaurant.

I normally have to wait for a little more than a half hour before I get my food.  Here, it is what it's named, In and Out.  You're in to get your order, and out in no more than ten minutes.  I don't know how long this will last a people will more than likely catch on.

Service is efficient, and food is always cooked to perfection.  Fries can be sometimes too dry for my liking.  But, I prefer it over any other fries.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,2,1,5,bFOgpyYEby0pgzmffBniyQ

This place just opened... and it showed. Well, in a good way I mean. I drive by and the dining room seems empty. Its a Friday night around 10pm and I figure this place would be somewhat busy.

I roll into the drive through and there outside in the freezing weather stands a girl taking orders. I wonder if she drew the short straw that evening or just normally out there.

Here's a list of what we ordered:

- Cheeseburger, Protein style.
- Cheeseburger, Animal style add a slice of raw onion. 
- Fries, Animal style
- Regular fries
- Chocolate Shake

When we arrived back at the house, the food was perfectly prepared and everything was in order. Needless to say, the food here is great and the prices are reasonable.

We spotted a table and downed our burgers and fries.  It reminded me of a Johnny Rockets Restaurant if you have ever been there but it was much better!!  For under $5 bucks a person, you could have a tasty burger with fries and a drink and its really good.  They apparently butcher their own meat so I was told.

I ordered a double double with no onions or special sauce (I don't like special sauce...I mean, I like my boyfriend's special sauce but it fortunately doesn't taste like Thousand Island dressing. Thank God!), fries, and the largest freakin diet coke they could give me. I was surprised at how freakin FRIENDLY all these mo' fo's working here were....every one of them was all smiles and thank yous and come agains. Wow, sure beats the grim faces of McDonalds! 

I got back to the Venetian and after finding my room in that labyrinth of a complex I sat down to eat. Burger - YESS! Yummers! Definitely trumps all other fast food burgers. Thick, juicy, meaty patties and a really great bun. Everything tasted fresh too which was a definite step up. Does it trump my fave burger joint? No, but it trumps Whataburger, McDonald's, Wendy's, etc. I would say it trumps Burger King but I never go there so I don't know. The fries were undersalted and not as crispy as I like them so there's the minus one star. And the drink was cold and restorative after a night out boozing it up like a rockstar.

Got my usual double-double and fries. Delicious as always.  There were some people buzzed and faded. Always interesting to people watch in Vegas.,TQcycwYMygQ8SvgXvgW3oQ,0,0,4,fV_nd-w9MKGYYaxd_T-hSg

That would be like the equivalent of opening up a pizza joint but having no pepperoni.  Shame.",AjyjpkhcU2IWdgD8VTwN7g,1,1,3,8KQ8mfpgsMyvIRucxz_D2g

This is a staple burger joint that I have eaten at since my days living in los angeles, (SFV) and the quality never disappoints! My boyfriend and I go here from time to time to get our burger and animal style fries craving satisfied! Animal style is the way to go on the fries for sure because they are just too plain and dry without the caramelized onions and special sauce. !

The Fantastic service, cleanliness and quality can't be beat!

We love In-N-Out Burger!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,4,5,4,CjeSa2ZrSfOuq64QpPHISA

5892841,2012-01-01,0,qG_WEgPa8MBo1dPUOkTMlw,"I am not a huge fan of fast food but In-N-Out is the exception to the rule. Whenever I am on the West Coast In-N-Out is a must. I landed in Las Vegas at 10:30 and I was at In-N-Out by noon. 

Their double cheeseburgers are a thing of beauty and I love their fries. And did I mention the unbelievable sauce (essentially thousand island) that is available. I dip my fries in it and drench my burger with it as well. 

Just all around one of the best guilty pleasures. I absolutely love In-N-Out and am somewhat thankful they are not on the East Coast. I would be a house if they were.",UBHPEEA3whv9X4rEZmc--Q,0,0,5,iWCwdvJKgo7_ICtF6OSKkQ

5934524,2010-03-17,0,qG_WEgPa8MBo1dPUOkTMlw,"I used to be jealous that the east coast had whitecastle. Having had some, I've changed my mind. 

Fresh ingredients, never frozen patties, fresh cut veggies and fries made to order, and great shakes. At a incredibly affordable price for the top quality food you're getting. The wait is usually longer, but that's how it should be. Real food should not be made at microwave speeds.  They also have the infamous secret menu. 

My usual order: #3 (hamburger, double meat, whole grilled onion, and fries well-done)

Simple. Fresh. Cheap. Convenient. 
This is the pinnacle of conventional fast-food establishments.",k-35KEBzHxuchfV8Y2WdjQ,1,1,5,p_WK4EoJXCDcoTgj4asmUA

You are famished and you don't want to risk a new place that may or may not feed that hunger demon who will play havoc with your insides les you appease his demands, at that point you are going to go here In'N'Out.  It was because of Yelp that I found my nearest In N Out location. I love that app.  It directed me here and I was in burger heaven.  Everything taste so good at this place.  There isn't a single complaint I ever have upon leaving, only that I wish I had more room to consume more.

The drives they line was pretty long today and took almost 20 minutes to get through. I customized my order so maybe that's why it was a bit of a wait. I chose a number two with grilled onions, chopped peppers, and no tomatoes. I also ordered the fries well done with a lemonade to drink. 

This time my fried came out as ordered and I was able to get two packets of spread to put on my fried instead of ketchup. The service overall was good and once you get to the windows to pay and get your food it's actually quick.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,1,1,4,cmANudx7n0EaMEtj7Z-vGg
