165849,2010-10-13,1,iiIXOU0L-KUCjuNES2e6Cw,"As a general rule, I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but I do enjoy a good fish taco. For some reason, it seems that the vast majority of Mexican restaurants do not offer fish tacos on their menus. That's probably because it's harder to get it right compared to a chicken or carne asada taco. Fortunately, there is Rubio's. Its whole claim to fame is the original Baja-style fish taco and as far as I'm concerned, Rubio's makes one of the best. Crispy beer-battered fish is served with shredded cabbage, mild salsa, and a tangy white sauce in a flour or soft corn tortilla. It's just as delicious as it sounds, but it tastes better if you eat it right away before the batter has a chance to get soggy. On Fish Taco Tuesdays, the original fish taco is only $1.25 after 2:30pm.

We also enjoy their carnitas rajas taco with its tender and tasty pork. My wife often orders their balsamic and roasted veggie salad with grilled chicken. Their salsa bar has 3 different salsas: mild green, spicy red, and my favorite, the chipotle. For the health conscious, they offer a grilled Mahi Mahi version which is very tasty as well. Sure there are other items on their menu, but we typically stick with our favorites.

Rubio's is a great choice for an inexpensive meal that tastes good. With friendly and efficient counter service and surroundings that are clean and comfortable, what more could you ask for? If you join their ""Beach Club"" email list, they will send you coupons on a regular basis, including a free meal on your birthday.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,2,2,4,rv2Fg7w6gWMbyqtBGEuHTw

Sure, Wahoos Fish Tacos are classic. I've been going to the original shack in HB since I was 16. And those are tasty and healthy, no disrespect. But the RUBIOS tacos are TASTIER and UNHEALTHIER... and cheaper- What's not to love?

The salsa bar is good. For some reason, the salsa bar at any local El Pollo Loco is still my favorite, but I usually question the freshness of the EPL salsa bar, although I can never turn down the guacamole salsa, even when It's 85° and I am scraping the bottom of the cilantro-cluttered bowl.

Back to the fish tacos. I get them with an extra side of white sauce and extra cabbage. The fish is usually golden fried and of ample portion. Stay away from the lime, however, they are usually very potent and overpowering. Use a little salsa verde and a little chipotle salsa- Voilá!

And I usually only get 2. Very filling, although when I feel like a fiesta I can order as many as 4 (that's pronounced 'quatro').

The staff is friendly, the girl at the Lake Mead location rides a GSXR- Whoot Whoot! And they always throw in some free corn chips. Love it.

Rubios apparently doesn't hire anyone to answer the phone, even though they have cashiers and managers ALWAYS standing around. They will let you call 5-10 times before answering. Seriously, how hard is it to add ""answer the phone"" into a minimum wage job description anyways? So after two months of this I went to the manager, who sounded 18. I expressed that I hadn't been able to get through and had been taking my business to Baja Fresh, and she said I'd be better off going to Baja Fresh and also that the phone is a low priority for them.

Now they limit the number of shrimp per burrito to eight (8) per burrito, so it ends up being pretty much all rice and beans. The shrimp got smaller, too: they used to use a 36/40 count shrimp size, now they're using 41/45 or smaller shrimp size (my best guess.)

I understand that sometimes product offerings get smaller as margins are protected at chain restaurants (e.g. the Big Mac is tiny nowadays, the Burger King hamburger is bite-sized now.) But, with a Chipotle exactly one block away, you'd think that the franchise owner here would ensure that customers are getting their money's worth. In the middle of my burrito there was a pretty big triple fold of excess overlapped tortilla - meaning the burrito was much smaller than it should of been.

I have now been to this location in summerlin 3-4 times now since I have moved here 6 weeks ago. The location is clean, fun and they play 80s rock which is good for the whole family. I always see a bunch of families here especially on Tuesdays after 2:30 when they have their original fish taco (cabbage, lime, white sauce and mild salsa) for 1.50 (originally 2.99) and their fish taco especial: guacamole , cheese, cilantro/onion, usually 3.29 is only 2.00!!!! Such a steal. I usually get 6 tacos for my husband and I for only 10$!!!!!!! They are quite large too! I can only eat 2 tacos along with my husband. And we take some for work the next day. 
The fish is Alaskan poluck and is very crispy and tasty. No signs of fishy smell or taste. 
If it was only closer to where I live I swear id eat here every day. 
They best is that they close at 9pm on Tuesdays so when ur feeling lazy/tired after a long day of work or the gym, the fish isn't greasy and taste really refreshing esp with a squirt of their fresh lime and tomatillo sauce (which I hoard) lol 
Other options at the salsa bar include fresh lemon/lime, the mild and tomatillo sauce for people like me who don't like spicy. But for the spicy lovers their chipotle is smokey and lightly spicy and their picante is real spicy as well.

3203647,2011-03-21,16,iiIXOU0L-KUCjuNES2e6Cw,"Mentioning my name in certain circles is verboten. Never mention Rex Marvin at the San Antonio Community  Quilting Bee...apparently quilting the greatest moment of your sexual history isn't appropriate for a 12 year old looking to enter the competitive world of quilting.  Never mention Rex Marvin at the National Bowling Stadium...apparently streaking across the lanes with ""This Isn't A Real Sport"" on your buttocks is a faux pas.  The beer and bratwurst crowd can be a touchy one.  Never mention Rex Marvin at the Birmingham Alabama ""Is This Your Sister or Your Wife"" Blueberry Festival...apparently screaming ""anyone who didn't take a bath with your future wife as kids aren't really married in this state"" is a little too close to the truth for most. (On a side not, moonshine, incest and the bible is a dangerous combination. A lot of bad ideas are formulated.)  And never...ever...ever mention the name of Rex Marvin at the Kentucky Apple Festival...I will just say this...when someone tells me there is an apple festival...and there is no Apple Spinach Lasagna then you get what you deserve...and if that means holding the Apple Queen down (a guy in a dress by the way)...and putting apples in every cavity...then you take it like a man...a man in a dress with shaved legs and a date that couldn't tell he was a man.
 
In most Mexican food restaurants...chain restaurants... there is a written rule to ban Rex Marvin on sight. They won't announce this policy...if you mention Rex Marvin they will call the cops and have you escorted out.  Only Del Taco has publicly stated on a Danish Crime Show roughly translated as ""Man Who Can't Salt Fish Correctly"" that I will be killed even if I try to go through the drive thru.  I have taken that on as a badge of all that is right in the world.  (Secretly, I go in to Del Taco's and eat their crappy food while writing 'Tom Sizemore banged your mom' on bathroom stall walls.)
  
I take Mexican food very seriously, because it is great when you just take great ingredients and don't mess them up. Most places use over processed crappy ingredients and used heavily handed sauces.  Fresh, simple and flavorful. Chain Mexican food restaurants seem to remove the flavor when they defrost the meat outside in the sun.  Canned vegetables. Premade sauces. Frozen food. Is there any reason that 4 of my 9 felony convictions have been committed in a fast food Mexican place? Instead of the Twinkie Defense I used the Canned Crap defense.
 
When I woke up behind a Rubio's after 3 days of snorting bath salts and Pine Sol. Trust me it is something that is really best left to the professionals.  I woke up to a great smell...actually I woke up to 3 guys carrying trash cans and drinking low grade sake out of a plastic jug.  Three shots later I was ready to eat. Nice guys. Bought two Chinese stars and some fireworks.  They kept smiling and speaking Finnish...weird blonde bastards.
 
I went into Rubios and it was a revelation. Very reasonable priced. Very good food. All of the chips are made fresh daily. The standout is the fish taco.  I have gone back several times and I have bought the battered fish tacos (I suggested calling it the Rihanna but they didn't go for it) and they were great every time. Get the Especial, very good guacamole and cilantro. Worth the 40 cents.  The Burritos are very good and a good size for the price. The salad has a lot of good things in it, not just lettuce and the blows are good if you are into that. They are light.  The taquitos are good, but not crispy enough the time I got it. The main thing is that this place uses great ingredients. The times I have eaten there I have loved the food.  Is it as good as a great local place...no, it can't be. It is still a chain, but a good chain...like the one from my scrotum to my nipple. 

It does have a decent sauce bar. The three sauces range from very good to okay. They have roasted pepper sauce and the best one. There is a salsa verde, but it is the weakest one. They have a spicy piccante which is good, but one note.

The bad...the sides are not great. The beans are just awful. Very soupy. Not much flavor. The rice was dry. The sides are very important and seem like an after thought here. Sad, because it would be better rated if they cared about their side dishes. 

I won't eat there all the time. I won't eat there when I have better alternatives, but I will go back. I like it. I don't love it. It is how I feel about the girl who I peep into her windows. I like her enough to look...not enough to stalk. Fine line? Yes. A line nonetheless? Yes.",jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ,12,12,3,Db34e6_ndLAXRoesG7c-BQ

Each year Rubio's sends me a birthday coupon for up to $7.00 worth of free food. Oddly, the coupon expires a week before my actual birthday, so I had to take advantage of the coupon prior to its expiration date. I thought I'd give this Rubio's a go after having discovered it by chance as I was driving to Patty's Closet. It's hardly noticeable from the main roads unless you're really searching for it, or if you get out of your car to visit neighboring businesses. 

It may appear tiny at first glance, but there's additional seating around the corner on the way to the salsa bar and soda fountains. The restaurant in general is clean, especially the counters which were free from saucy spills.

I ordered my usual ""Pesky Platter"" (I'm still going to refer to it by that name!): Two fish tacos especial accompanied by sides of tortilla chips and pinto beans, which I skipped on. I did notice a difference in the tortilla chips, which were thinner, crunchier, and overall just ""lighter"" than the chips I used to order with my tacos.

The staff here is welcoming towards customers, and the service is quick.  My food was delivered to me within minutes of placing my order.

After browsing the menu for a while, I decided to go for the Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans instead of Black Beans ($6.29) and a Carnitas Taco ($1.69).

While I was waiting for my meal, I went to the Salsa Bar and filled up 4 cups of their spiciest Salsa.  The food came out relatively fast.  I decided to go for the Carnitas Taco first......it kind of like the ""Street Tacos"" found in Mexico.....Corn Tortilla, Meat, Onions, Cilantro, Lime Juice.  I poured some Salsa on it and took a bite.....it was pretty good, but not great.  It's very small and in my opinion not worth $1.69.

Next, I went for the Steak Burrito which came with a side of Chips.....bonus!  I took one bite of the Burrito and became a fan.  The Steak reminds me of the Carne Asada I had in So Cal growing up.  The flavor of the Burrito hit home for me.  The Salsa was pretty spicy too, so that was awesome!  The Chips weren't that good though.....good thing I didn't pay extra for that.

Overall, it was a good dining experience.  Glad I found a new quick Mexican joint.

This was the primary reason for our lunch visit last weekend. It came with chips. You order at the counter and pay for it. Someone will bring it to your table. We also got a kids meal for our picky-eater son.

The layout is an L-shape. Counter is to the right side, when you enter. There is a salsa bar to the left. There were four or five choices (mild, medium, and spicy), as well as sliced limes. To the left of the salsa bar are the fountain drinks (including two choices for iced tea). The bathrooms are to the back of the property. It is clean, both the general seating area and the bathrooms.

Mine was good, hubby's was lopsided (ie. missing the langostino) so he kindly brought it up to the manager's attention, which was handled pretty well. I do remember that the one we had in the past was more hearty with langostino, is my only criticism. Otherwise, the ingredients were a nice compliment to each other, and nothing was overpowering, as I had it as it came (hubby usually omits a few things); I thought the salsas were creamy and flavorful. I could've finished it, but I saved the rest of it to enjoy later. Hubby thought the replacement burrito was better, as the langostino was more evenly distributed. The chips were fresh, crispy and went well with the chosen salsas. 

Our son loved his cheese quesadilla, which came with chips, a churro and a small drink @ $4.79. We are trying to expand his food choices, so it's nice when he was something sort of new (it's been a while). (He likes Chipotle, Roberto's & El Pollo Loco.) He didn't finish it though, we took it home. 

Would I get this again? There are other choices on the menu (might try the other langostino ones, enchilladas, tacos). My favorite thing to get here is the fried fish tacos. Hmm, decisions, decisions.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,1,4,dMM16kf9hTTqLAN_YRp9xg

Sooo on your bday they email you a 7 coupon for your bday, as long as you sign up for the email club prior. Now Ive been to Rubios in San Jose and really liked it! My son enjoys their classic fish tacos, and on Tuesday after 230 you can get them for 1.25 each! DEAL!! I on the other hand do not like fish, but do like shrimp, Im a weirdo lol. Anywho we ventured here after school a few days before my bday (they send the email on the first of the month) 

I scanned the menu for chicken and shrimp options, and asked the cashier what she recommends, her answer were the street tacos. Now I wanted to get more bang for my freebucks so I ordered the chicken burrito sans tomatoes. My son chose 2 fish tacos so my total was only 3!! SCORE!! We went to the salsa bar and got some hot salsa and FRESH cut limes!! FRESHHHHH! We always opt for water bc soda is the devil, I went ahead and squirted (dirty!) a lime into my water and enjoyed how yummy it was! 

We only had a short wait and our food was BROUGHT OUT to us! WHOA! I couldve walked my little fat ace up there and when I seen him I stood up and he said no and walked it to us. Talk about hospitality! I cased my burrito and noticed it needed to be mixed up and needed more crema. I was a little afraid to ask, but he gave me a generous helping of it. YUM! So I put my crema and salsa and salted that bad boy. Now typically I do not like beans in burritos, unless theyre from Chipotle. Here the burritos taste like a more Mexican chipotle and most def make you feel fuller. The burritos are long and medium, not short and fat like Chipotle. 

We both bit into our yummies and honestly I wasnt crazy about the burrito... it was kinda a fail : ( It honestly had no seasoning and was pretty bland even after all the stuff I added. I even added lime to give it a light taste, but negative! Also the tortilla dried out pretty fast bc the AC was on in there so my burrito pretty much stooped over and died mid meal. Thank goodness they give you chips otherwise Id be eating it with a fork. My son only ate 1 taco bc they also got a little soggy... we are the weirdos who take like an hour to eat, but since the ac was kickin it kinda died up our tortillas. No biggie! Cant be all grim over almost free food!!

Now I give this place 4 stars bc of the customer service, as mentioned above both the cashier and food runner were very courteous. Also, my son was wandering and seen a beach ball so I asked if they sold them and the cashier gave him a FREE RUBIOS BEACHBALL! How nice right?!

I would have given 5 stars except the nearest location is in BFE:(

I had a coupon for free chips and guacamole with the purchase of an entree.  i ordered my favorite Chipotle Shrimp Salad.  i was disappointed that there were no fresno chiles on the salad like they have at other locations.  Maybe the person making the salad forgot to put them on.

But coming the first time, it would have been beneficial to look at the menu online first. LOL! 
I got the trio tacos, which has the traditional fried fish taco, shrimp taco and grilled Mahi Mahi. The grilled Mahi Mahi was my favorite, but all were good. 
We got an order of the guacamole and chips to share, but both filled up on tacos and ended up throwing the chips away. 
They have a small salsa bar that had many choices from chipotle, med salsa, tomatillo, to jalapeño citrus to name some.  I like the jalapeño mostly because of the spicy it added. What can I say, this Louisiana gal likes it hot!  ;)
I really enjoyed this place and will return to try some of the other choices.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,2,1,4,gXV1jcObCYNnPag9-41XCw

I prefer a flour tortilla which you can substitute instead of corn. I don't know what exactly is in the sauce they put on the taco, but it makes my mouth sooooo happy! There are several types of fish to order as well..pollock, tilapia..grilled or fried. Order a meal and it includes two sides. I order my tacos a la carte and just get two.

God forbid you forget to buy a drink or want to buy something else. Because you won't be able to do that. Or that you get full on the 1st meal because they don't give you anymore food. I bought my food then I planned on purchasing food to go because I was paying with same visa they didn't honor the transaction. I even agreed to pay extra for the card use. No! That's there policy one card swipe use a day & the register confirms. This is sad & poor service because there was not a sign to keep the customers informed of this beforehand. Money is money. I suggest they change that policy or get a new up to date modern card using machine or charge the visa transaction amount or put a sign up saying this. I wish I could've been informed about this before a purchased my meal then It would have given me a chance to buy everything in one shot one deal.,EttcwtTCziTRgzGupJWiIA,0,0,1,zr9NFzI9ZGTXYQYQwH3G0g

They are over priced now just by a little bit.  However their food is fantastic and I love their chips and all their fresh made salsas to pick from.  Their restaurant is always very clean and comfortable to sit inside or outside.  I love their fish tacos too.  Their beans are never refried and I love their black beans too.

I had the Baja Burrito with grilled chicken. The flavor was incredible. The grilled white meat chicken was nice and juicy and the cilantro & tomato salsa adds another element of flavor. Be sure to add one of their four or five salsas from the salsa bar. My favorite is the green citrus sauce that was in a squeeze bottle. It's nice and tangy. 

Don't miss out on the fish tacos either. There's plenty of fish in it so you don't have to worry about fishing to get some fish in every bite. Their white sauce and cabbage smothered on top adds the creaminess and crunch that every fish taco should have.

I got the costal trio, Original Fish Taco, Salsa Verde Shrimp Taco and Regal Spring Tilapia Taco. The shrimp and fish taco's was good, fresh, crispy with crunch, however, the tilapia was a little fishy smell, it turned me off.

Not 1 single piece of chicken. I love me some chicken tortilla soup but this was not good at all. And idk why you would get flour tortillas with tortilla soup.

But most importantly we have to all come to Agreement on what to eat for lunch.. Well today we had a tough time figuring it out but the underlying theme was Mexican. Someone shouted Chipotle, then someone shouted, "" Ugghhhhh, are you serious?"" Then From the other side of the building you hear a faint, "" Baja Fresh"", and again you hear, "" What? Are you kidding me?"" and finally someone suggested Rubios and there was a moment of silence and  the tension in the room Mellowed and the calmness of Agreement was among us. 

We all put our orders down and I chose to devour a Veggie burrito. Veggie Burrito? You ask... Yep, Portabellos, peppers, beans, rice, and a nice kick to the hot salsa i had them add. Once the order arrived in our office we all headed back to the lunch table like a heard of Lions to a large................. salad..... Okay i know lions don't eat salad but just in case you are reading this as a bedtime story to your kid i did not want to say we headed to them like lions on zebra.. Moving on. The Burrito was plentiful, and they did not skimp on the portabello which i have to be honest I was expecting. This thing was stuffed like a thanksgiving burrito and was really really filling. Everyone elses food looked great and smelled great as well. I now think that this is going to be moved a little closer to the top of our lunch picks for the future feasts. 

If you have not been here, and are in a hurry and like Veggies i would recommend trying out the Veggie burrito that they execute with perfection.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,3,2,4,LufVTd7ss0XEPHefhubIoA

The manager was working the till when I walked in and greeted me with a genuine welcoming.  I ordered the Mango Habanero Ono Two Taco special.  Obviously I am a gringo but it the best way the manager asked me if I like it HOT?  I said not really and he let me know this particular platter was pretty spicy.  I said I just had a hankering for the mango accents.  So, he quickly had the grillmaster put some of the mango salsa in a cup with a single tortilla chip to taste.  Ok, that works for me.  He then gave special instructions to modify the platter so only the mango salsa was added and not the other really spicy stuff.

I sat down and grabbed a 3% lemonaide and within minutes he delivered the meal to my table in a very friendly way.  Great meal for $10 and as I left I thanked him and he did the same.
