41045,2009-08-07,0,GMrwDXRlAZU2zj5nH6l4vQ,"Thanks to the brutal hangovers I experience several times a month, knowing where to get decent pho is absolutely critical.  It's the only thing that can ease my abused digestive and nervous systems into a state of complacency.  

I did not get decent pho here.  In fact, it's the first pho I've ever eaten that made my hangover worse.  

Maybe I just got a bad batch.  I don't know.  

My bowl was awful.  The broth tasted of nothing but salt.  The subtle flavors of meat and spice that my body craved simply were not there.  I tried to enhance the flavor profile with the usual panel of hot sauces, to no avail.  

The meat was alright, if a little tough.  The veggies were pitiful.  Half the leaves on the mint were grayish brown and wilted, and the bean sprouts were slimy.

It all made for a bad brew.  I ate all the meat out of it, and that was about it.  I usually drink the broth like it's the elixir of life, but not this time.  I may as well have been sipping on hot brine.  I couldn't even eat the noodles, as they had been steeped in the brackish concoction.

The pho left me excessively parched for hours, exacerbating my hangover, and did little to help my stomach ache.  

I won't be back.  Which is a shame, because the bahn mi looked great.  

At any rate, the food is cheap, and the service is lackadaisical, as is traditional for family-run Asian eateries.  I wouldn't go for the pho, but the bahn mi might be worth a try.

One should note that they close somewhat early at 9pm.",Of9UCq61gd2ehoN337taKQ,1,1,1,FGGA3jLtzimhYeZlxM_fMQ

Pho Thanh Huong Restaurant is our 3rd Pho Restaurant attempt in Vegas and it's the best from all! First thing that greeted us was a very friendly smile and offer to choose any table we like. We already had a good feeling. We both went for King Size Pho bowl with all the meats inside (well, I went without tendons). We also ordered 4 spring rolls.

The bowl of Pho was HUGE!  Our greedy foodie hearts filled with joy at seeing such a size. However more importantly, it was also very tasty. The restaurant also had the small fresh red hot chilli peppers for us, which we like to add to provide some extra spiciness. It's always a plus when they have it and bring those out! Again, all the service was with a smile which is very important to us.

The restaurant has free WiFi hotspot as well. 

We came back the next day for Grilled Pork + Shrimp + Eggroll vermicelli, and it was also very much to satisfaction. The menu didn't provide for a King Size version for the vermicelli, but we asked anyway... and they flexibly provided! They said we were the first to order it. We like flexible restaurants :)

5 stars! Would come back definitely.",YGCaKX5y2FCXyHMYzQS-JQ,1,1,5,6FfFLz7DNGjGfPbH0sRWhQ

Opted for this place because it's closer to our dorms than Mr. Sandwich and we had to get groceries from Von's next door. The plaza it's in has some wanderers but the parking lot and stores are spread out enough you can avoid them. Outside looked kind of dead, not much curb appeal, but once inside it was nice and clean. It was 6:30 p.m., Friday night, and there were only two other tables being served. Note that you seat yourself, order/eat, then get up to pay at the register. Ordered our food (four combo pho, one fried rice), came to the table within 10-15 minutes, and we all left full. Reasonable pricing! If I weren't in a pho mood, I definitely would've tried the $3.25 banh mi.

Besides Hue Thai which is literally my favorite place in Vegas, this place is in my top 5. 

Whenever, i go into the shop, I'm greeted by all of the staff and depending on if i'm eating in or taking it to go, they are very quick and attentive. I've tried both the charbroiled pork and grilled beef banh mi and they are completely packed with flavor. The cooks here really do it well. They pack the sandwich with the right balance of spicy and sweet from their mayo sauce, daikon , and carrot to their smoky meats and jalapenos.  Depending on what you get, most of the sandwiches are around 3.75+tax with the exception of beef at $8...  Also, if you're looking for bubble tea, please don't get it here! The boba itself is bitter and way too chewy but the tea is excellent. I'd recommend any of the teas without boba.

Their tapioca boba is almost always flawlessly cooked - the perfect blend of chewy and soft.  

When you enter the restaurant, there is an area where ""to-go"" food/drinks (eggs rolls, shrimp chips, etc) may be ordered.  Past the ""to-go"" area is restaurant seating.   

Food Selection:
Pho Thanh Huong offers inexpensive menu items similar to what you would expect from a typical Vietnamese pho restaurant - beef noodle soups, rice plates, sandwiches, egg rolls, etc.  We ordered Pho Tai (beef noodle soup with rare steak) and Com Tam (broken rice with BBQ pork) with a side order of fried eggs.  The food is average tasting but tasty enough to satisfy my Vietnamese food cravings. 

Customer Service:
The employees are pleasant and will accommodate any special requests without judgment.  My food orders have always been fulfilled in a timely manner.  This restaurant appears to be family-owned and I love supporting small businesses.  

Miscellaneous:
The restaurant's décor is to some extent outdated but their restroom is clean and there is plenty of parking.

Decided to give this place a try on a Sunday night since it's just around the corner from me and didn't feel like making the journey all the way to Chinatown.

All I can say is WOW!  Went in there with no expectations and walked away beyond happy.  I moved to Vegas about 4 months ago from San Diego where the Pho shops are plentiful and have tried many in the area since arriving.  Thanh Huong will now be my go to for my pho fix.

The servers were SO nice and prompt with everything.  The pho was not heavy nor was it very bland, it was PERFECT!  You also get the option to build you own pho starting with just the beef broth and the noodles, which is great because you only get what you want in it.  To add to it all, unlike some other pho restaurants in the area this one is CLEAN AND... wait for it... they DO NOT bus an entire table on to a dish-washing cart right in front of you as you are eating.  HALLELUJAH! 

This place gets 5/5 because I have eaten at MANY pho restaurants throughout the southwest over the the years and I can honestly say this one is one of my top choices.",DpGRP2GXrAaFZWJ4gro1yQ,2,2,5,M797oT6rkfadhiZdcgfKMQ

all the banh mi $2.75 ( still slightly higher than the so cal / m. park places but that's ok ! )

Looks like the pate is pre-sliced ( not from a can - at least i don't think so ) i didn't see the ham.  the pork looked good.  rolled it up in paper the standard small rubberband - i'm on the road - gotta get home - SOON !

while driving - the smells - catfish, pupusa, banh mi - F IT !  i rip open the grilled pork banh mi - that's a big roll !  i can't believe i'm saying this -  crunchy outside so light, airy inside - delicious ( thought for sure the micro was gonna f-it up ! )  and the pork  - very, very good ! maybe a touch to much pepper but people, the flavors from the cilantro, the pork, the daikon, the pepper, Lord let there be banh mi's in heaven !!

The broth of the pho soup is addictive. It's so tasty I'd rather have extra broth than noodles! It tastes perfect--with the right amount of saltiness I want in a broth, and the soup just warms my stomach up. I always get full with the pho dac biet. I also tried the pho brisket--it's also tasty!

The sandwiches are great--the bread is always delightfully baked by the restaurant--they bake it themselves! From this, you know it has the perfect fluffy-on-the-inside-and-crunchy-on-the-outside texture. I usually come early so I can be one of the first people to get a fresh batch of baked bread. I love it with butter--it just melts delicious into the bread. I'm drooling right now~
My favorite sandwich has got to be the grilled chicken sandwich with pate. It's so delicious. I usually put a lot of spicy sauce on it and extra jalapenos for the right kick!
Do I sound overly enthusiastic about this place? Yes? GOOD. THAT'S HOW I WANT TO SOUND!

As for the smoothies, I've tried all of them. The boba is chewy and soft, and is a tasty sugary treat. I don't particularly like the strawberry, mango, or guyabano shake though. I don't recommend them. What I DO recommend is the Taro shake, avocado and the honeydew shake. It's the best out of all of them! 

Overall I give them 5 stars for variety, service, and tastiness (is that a word?)

- Pho Dac Biet (3/10)
- Grilled Pork Bahn Mi (8/10)
- Fresh Spring Rolls (5/10)

I don't know why Yelp STILL doesn't give you the option of filtering by ""most reviews"" on smart phones, because honestly, that's the best way to find a place in an unknown city. Because of that, apparently, I found not the ""most popular"" Pho place in Vegas, but just ""A"" pho place in Vegas. I'm so annoyed, because my friend just got done telling me that he knew of a great pho place, and here's me Yelping while driving and ending up at what Yelp probably thought was the ""most convenient"" pho place. Grrr!

PHO
I think, because I thought this must have been the place my friend was raving about, I had much higher expectations than I should have for it. The pho was just barely warm enough to be acceptable. The broth wasn't really that great either. If just barely had this taste of being...old, or not fresh. It wasn't spoiled or anything that bad, but it just didn't taste very fresh. The broth did its job, but didn't have that tiny bit of sweetness that I've had in better broths. The tripe specifically was very....tripe-y. I like tripe, but it sort of teeters on a line where if you cross it, it starts to taste bad, and it was just starting to go that way. Honestly, I would look for a different place for pho.

SPRING ROLLS
Pretty decent, but nothing spectacular. No flavors really came out of the spring roll it self. The sauce was peanutty and sweet, and essentially, the spring rolls were just textured canvases for the sauce. Texture was good, the ""skin"" wasn't too thick. About average. You could do better, but it gets the job done.

GRILLED PORK BAHN MI
Poor Bahn Mi. I like it, but I always get pho when I go to a Vietnamese place, so I'm too full. Luckily, I had a friend here to split one. The bread was very crusty, which sounds bad, but is actually really good. The crust was crunchy, but not hard. The pork had a real nice smoky sweet flavor and the veggies made it taste fresh. This is only the 2nd time I've had Bahn Mi, and so far, it tasted pretty close to my first one, so I'm not sure how to distinguish these yet. It was very tasty though!

NOT PHO ME
Granted, the bahn mi was excellent, but so far, for me at least, bahn mi is always excellent. The pho, though, was a real downer. It just didn't really taste fresh, so it was one of the worse ones I've had. Considering that there is an area with a lot of pho places further west, I'd say skip this one, even though it is one of the closest to The Strip (I think)!",4dk6ki0f4GKpgzAqdupOvw,2,0,3,JaJ85AkRZeGRVj-dC60_MA

For my meal I chose #24 Com Ga Xao Xa Ot which is a Spicy Lemongrass Chicken ($9.50) serve with a side of white rice and salad. They serve the meal really fast, it took within 10 minutes. The chicken taste very spicy. I was hoping there would be a hint of lemongrass flavor, but all I can taste is how spicy the chicken is. So I end up pouring a small bowl of sweet fish sauce over the chicken just to tame the heat. The salad taste okay. It's mainly fresh lettuce, cucumber, and two slice tomatoes topped with pickled radish. Even though it's a simple salad, it did balance nicely with the meal.

In addition, I chose #53 Che Ba Mau ($3.95) which is a Tricolored Dessert in a cup filled with green jelly, sweetened azuki beans, mashed yellow mung beans in coconut cream and topped with shaved ice. The Che Ba Mau is somewhat similar to the popular Filipino Halo Halo. The only difference between the two shaved ice dessert is that with Che Ba Mau, you get three ingredients and coconut flavor. Whereas with Halo Halo, you get a lot more ingredients including ice cream and they use evaporated milk. Personally I prefer Che Ba Mau, it's a light and tasty dessert and I like that it's not too sweet.

The restaurant can accommodate up to 57 people. The lighting is dim, but there is a lot of open space, you can sit comfortably without having your chair bump into any person. I notice the background music is a mix of R&B and Pop, the song I hear playing is ""Havana."" The service is very friendly. They are attentive and asked if I need anything and if everything is okay.

The fillings seemed to have gotten worse. They were Extremely stingy on the fillings and it was salty. Also didn't seem as juicy as before, maybe they need to add more mayo.

Here the broth had a wonderful aroma and the Pho 'rare steak' was great.  The rare steak is served inside the broth; that seems to be the norm here in Las Vegas as I have tried many of the Pho restaurants.  In Hawaii one is given the choice of ""meat outside or inside"" meaning that the rare steak can be served outside of the broth on a small plate and then placed into the the broth by the guest.
One small thing I took issue with is with the Ca Phe Vietnamese service.  The menu states ""hot or cold"". Hot is priced at $3.00 and cold is priced at $3.50.  I was charged $3.50 for hot Ca Phe and then also charged another $.50 cents for it being hot.  Next time no Ca Phe Vietnamese for me, just water.
Another thing with the coffee is that it is served in a 'to-go' cup and already mixed.  Pre made (made in the back of house) Ca Phe again seems to be the norm here in Las Vegas.  I am used to receiving the coffee table side with the coffee and hot water in a Single Cup Coffee Filter served on top of a coffee cup that has the 'Condensed Milk' in the bottom and the coffee then drips slowly into the cup while one is enjoying their Pho.  Once the coffee is finished dripping that one has the option of stirring and enjoying hot or stirring and then pouring over the accompanying ""glass"" of ice.

1476002,2015-10-03,5,GMrwDXRlAZU2zj5nH6l4vQ,"TLDR: Get the pho, bahn mi, and fresh fruit smoothies, but skip the boba. 

The #11 combination pho has a great, savory broth and ample meat and toppings. They pack this really well for takeout, if you're in a rush. 
Their bahn mi are made with fresh, fantastic French bread- some of the best bread I've found in town, actually. For under $4, the sando is stuffed with toppings, but I'd personally ask for extra pate. 
They advertise the smoothies as being made with fresh fruit- I'm not sure how true that is but the jackfruit version is perfection in a cup. Not too sweet, no artificial flavor, would get again... But their boba is pretty flavorless, so I'd skip that. Smoothies automatically come with boba (for $5/ea) but if you as for it without, they're closer to $3- but they may forget and give you boba anyway out of habit (happened to me).",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,6,4,35JUlbHZiMVDrEdmVOOlLw

To my delight I came to find out that there are NEW owners/management that are extremely pleasant and helpful. 

I got pho there, which is actually really good. There is a combination bowl and it has tons of items in it: tripe, beef balls, brisket, flank, etc. And it's a flat rate at $8.50.  They said that if you don't like any one of those items, they remove it and add more of what you do like.  So I was definitely happy with that because I really don't like tripe.

 It's hard to find places that are not in chinatown that have good pho. This place is one of them. 

I also tried their grilled pork sandwich and it was delicious! The bread is made in-house and I was told that they make it fresh daily around 9-10AM. I love bread and I'm picky hhaha but it was really good with their grilled pork and veggies.

I've been a fan of Mr. Sandwich for a long time, but a couple of impromptu lunches here and I am now sold! I'd never heard of this place. It's in an unassuming strip mall off Trop and Maryland.

It's a nice clean restaurant! The first time, I got pho and a banh mi. Second time, I got the banh mi.

The bread is perfect. Crunchy, chewy, delicious all at the same time. Priced well at about $3.75 per sandwich. 

You can be a fatboy like me and just get two sandwiches, but call it a day after that. It's still pool season.

I used to come here a lot for the Bahn mi and pho when I was attending unlv. Reviewing it now based on this visit.

Came for lunch on a Monday. Place was busy. You got people waiting for to-go orders and people arriving to get seated.

They sat us at an open table pretty quick but it was dirty. Server noticed and cleaned it right away after we had sat.

We each did the check in but I realized you just have to mention the free eggrolls to get it I think. 

We ordered:

*2 free eggrolls - 
he didn't bring the fish sauce sauce that you dip it.. I waited for my dish which usually comes with it to come out before I could eat it lol Bf dipped it in the peanut sauce. It didn't have much veggies in it and was quite packed with filling which I didn't hate. It was okay but hey, free.

*fresh spring rolls 2pcs. w/ pork and shrimp
I found them decent spring rolls, not too much lettuce. The peanut sauce was lighter and less thicker than most places but I actually preferred it like that.

*Pho combo with everything but tripe and tendon
Bf ordered this and said it was quite watered down and I agree. The broth didnt have depth. It didnt make you WANT to scoop another spponful of it after one bite. He had to use hoisin sauce to add some flavor. But it didn't taste like a mouthful of msg either which would have you chugging water even after eating it.

*grilled pork chops
Two thin but good sized chops on the bone. They were seasoned really well, not too salty or sweet and not overcooked either. The fish sauce sauce went well with it but could also do without it too. The pickled daikon and carrots that comes on the plate were flavorless. I usually eat it to cut the oil and fat at the end but it wasn't pickled with the right amount of sugar and vinegar. I wondered if they used that on their sandwiches..

The decor is plain.  Some carpeting and a standard counter with plenty of table space for groups.  The menu photos are bleak.  And the soup is basically water and noodles with vegetables and whatever else you tell them to throw in there for the price.  I have had friend after friend drag me in to this place and tell me that Pho would change my life.  Sadly, however, it did not.  It was simply Pho.  And I was unsatisfied.

The location is convenient for UNLV students, being located right by campus.  The prices were reasonable for water soup in a bowl.  But try as I might, and no matter how many spices I tried to throw in it to flare it, it was still just runny, watery, soup.

2180573,2015-07-09,0,GMrwDXRlAZU2zj5nH6l4vQ,"Of the four Vietnamese restaurants I've tried in Las Vegas and Henderson, this is the best. And it's because of the pho -- the reason I visit any Vietnamese place.

Although I prefer veggie broth, I'll admit that the pork broth used here for nearly every type of pho is tastier. Just not healthier. The soup has come out remarkably quickly during a couple of my visits, which is helpful when I'm pressed for time because pho isn't exactly a dine-and-dash experience. 

The quality of the sliced chicken is the highest of any pho place I've visited in Nevada; when I got a bowl recently at a pho place in Northern Nevada that I also rated four stars, there was no comparison. That place rates highly amid the dearth of good ethnic food in Northern Nevada, while this place rates highly in a foodie's paradise.

If I have one quibble with the aforementioned foodie's paradise, it's that some Las Vegas-area restaurants play current popular music a bit too loud in what appears to be a sad bid for hipness cred. It's annoying and diminishes my enjoyment of my meal. Fortunately, this place is nice and quiet. There's music playing and a TV on, but neither interferes with my enjoyment of my meal.

A word to the wise: I showed up about 9:20 p.m. recently, 40 minutes before the restaurant closes, and I was seated. People who showed up after maybe 9:30 p.m. weren't; they were told they could only order food to go. 

The only real negative I can see about this place is its location, in a not-so-nice strip mall. I realize that ""not-so-nice strip mall"" might seem redundant, but even by strip malls' middling standards, this one looks kinda dirty. Once you're inside, of course, that's not a concern.",hm6Iy0z325GZqQ09ozZgLw,2,0,4,y5iZ-loWtROI8lcCcviByA

The pho here is fairly basic, and although it gets the job done, it doesn't really stand up to most others I've had. The broth is a little light, and I often have trouble getting everything in it that I want due to the fact that the servers and counter workers don't really understand what I want if it's not already on the menu. They pretty much rely on me pointing to a picture or a number, but if you want something extra or a substitution forget about it unless you speak vietnamese.

The menu is also basic, and there are not many soup options other than pho, which is fine because the real star here are the banh mi sandwiches, which they do exceptionally well, with a great toasted bread and they are one of the few places I have found that have the option of the shredded pork skin sandwich.

All the staples are there and then some.  I personally love everything but tripe in my soup.  The different cooked meats, meatballs, tendon.. so delicious.  

More importantly though, their Bahn Mi (vietnamese sandwiches) are SO good here.   They bake their bread fresh and the portions of their meat and veggies are excellent.  I always order the grilled pork.  Just a tip: the Jalapeno slices they top the sandwich with are hot.  So ask them to put it on the side if you aren't sure you'd like them.

I've also enjoyed their vietnamese meatball sandwich, but their egg and chinese sausage sandwich wasn't much to talk about.

I've already bought 6 sandwiches and brought them to my co-workers.  They are IN LOVE with it.   Super damn good!",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,6,5,4,KKDPRYsADwa-EuhLEtN5iA

The daikon/carrot mix inside the 'wich overpowered all of its other flavors... so much so that I kept adding chili sambal paste to make this meal go down easier.  Even my banh mi companion (she believes herself to be an expert) admitted that the food was below sub-par. Add to that the overall inattentiveness of the staff, and well... SIGH. Too bad.

Thank the Yelp gods for this small gem! During the four years of attending UNLV, I would've been delighted to know there was such a yummy Vietnamese restaurant just across campus. There has been numerous times I craved pho or banh mi but did not have the 10-15 minutes to drive to Chinatown.

I had some bad experiences with previous pho restaurants regarding service, but this place is great. No need to wave down waiters to get a refill for my drink. Also the venue is clean and tidy.

I had the fried egg and Chinese sausage banh mi. The bread is toasted nearly perfect. It is crunchy yet crumbles away effortlessly, almost just melting away in your mouth. No need to chew and bite endlessly like with the bland toasted bread from Subway. Damn, did I just compare this place to Subway? Yeah right. Anyways, the fried egg and Chinese sausage was great, just a little too salty. I would definitely tell them to hold the salt next time. However, only $3.50 for this tasty sandwich? I can roll with that any day!

My girlfriend had the vegetarian pho and the broth looked and tasted spectacular. I really dislike how some pho are served drenched in oil. I hate seeing pockets of oil floating around in my broth, yuck! Thankfully, the broth was very clean and tasty. Maybe because it was vegetarian pho the broth was clearer than usual. I normally have beef or shrimp pho, so next time I will try that.

In conclusion, I really like the location of this venue and the banh mi. Definitely recommending this place, not only because location but for its surprisingly tasty dishes as well.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,5,4,4,3AuAtjwEOCw4lgZ6eMuZKQ

The service is quick when you do sit-down, and they're nice enough people, but of course they're not 5-star-restaurant material.  Highly recommended, get #1, it's the most flavorful.  The best thing to do when going with someone is to share a pho (which ever one you like) and a sandwich each.  That way you avoid over-ordering.  This will probably run you about $12.

The sandwiches are great - I put them in the over to toast up the bread a little and it's absolutely delicious.  It's one of my regular places as a Las Vegas local.  

I have had banh mi in many places, including California and Virginia, which have vibrant Vietnamese communities.  Oddly, the best one out of all of them thus far is here in Vegas.  The bread is fresh and had a nice chewiness to it; the grilled pork sandwiches have pork that don't have too much gristle, and the sandwiches use good vegetables.  The other inferior places I've been to have meager portions of meat, or cost $3.50 and upwards per sandwich, or had bread that I wasn't particularly fond of.  

I did have pho there once, and was disappointed by it; I go to Pho Saigon 8 up on Spring Mountain for my pho needs, but will often come here after a meal there for sandwiches to eat during the course of the week.  I put in my order, and go to the Vons in the same strip mall to finish up some shopping (it's an incredibly ghetto Vons).  

The decor is pretty lousy, though they have a flat screen tv up.  The service is spotty though I've been there enough times that they recognize me; they're not rude, but they aren't necessarily on top of everything.

Cleanliness is average.  The banh mi is prepared in the open area in direct view of anyone, which I like since it can help keep a kitchen honest.  Value is solid because of the high quality of banh mi and reasonable prices.  As said by others, you'll be best off if you stick with the sandwiches.

Also, avoid the place during UNLV basketball games, cheapskates come out here to park rather than parking at the arena and it makes the entire lot a zoo.",mP8n6b42hcI8mLLGuR9u-A,1,1,4,IeuML23YT0UUuv2bq3lulg

I've tried a couple Vietnamese spots around town, and I gotta say that so far, Pho Thanh Huong has the best pho in Vegas. It's clean yet flavorful, and the noodles have the perfect texture, not too chewy nor too soft. Perfect for a chilly winter day. The egg rolls were really good along with the pork banh mi.

But, I'm comparing that to southern cali prices and this IS vegas afterall.  After ordering the large bowl of pho, I now I understand why they charge you a pot of gold for it.  The large pho is ridiculously huge, probably one of the biggest bowls of pho I've ever seen.  You can easily feed 3 hungover people on a large bowl.

My last time here was a LONG time ago, and I've been waiting to be around the area to go again. Tonight, I noticed they redesigned their menus and made some other changes to the decor. It looks nicer than last time.

The boyfriend and I normally get #28 the Special Rice Combo which comes with rice (duh), grilled pork, grilled shrimp and 2 fried eggrolls. Has a small side of vegetables (pickled carrots and daikon radish on top of lettuce, and tomatoes and cucumbers). I'm in love with pork and theirs is scrumptious. But their grilled shrimp is pretty amazing also... one of the best shrimp I've ever had AND THEY DE-VEIN THE SHRIMP! All this for $9.50!! And they make the shrimp look pretty... If that matters to you...

We also got the spring rolls.. they could use a little more ""umph"" since there was only like one slice of meat in it but their peanut sauce is good.

I told my boyfriend I don't think I want to go to any other Vietnamese restaurant other than here from now on. He HATES pho (yeah i know, who hates pho?!) but he took a small bite of mine and liked it so that means something, right?

Also idk about during the normal lunch/dinner hours because we normally come here around 9:30pm but we've never had to wait to be seated and they have pretty good customer service.

The grilled pork and chicken sandwiches are scrumptious, light and crunchy.  Every bite is full of delicious flavor. Very reasonable price for such a bangable sandwich.
Spring rolls, and fried rolls are no doubt delectable. Eat with caution though, as you can easily fill up with these appetizers that your entree may feel neglected... you might need a to go box after 2 bites.

First I walk up to the doors and there are pictures of food in the window which weren't there before. Then the inside was painted a different color. I looked at the menu at the to go counter and it was actually missing essential Vietnamese items like pho and vermicelli. The staff was also entirely different than the family that used to run the restaurant. So after I ordered my sandwich and I ask if there is a different owner. And the gal responds ""Yes, different owner."" UHH OHH! I ordered my usual charred pork bahn mi. I immediately noticed the bread was still the same, but the daikon radish was definitely different. More of a vinegar taste vs the mayonnaise taste, totally didn't like it. They also added cucumbers which the previous owners didn't do. Overall I think this place is on the wrong path.

There's plenty of seating, something I always enjoy. They let you sit wherever. Most of the seating is built for larger parties, so if it's just 1 or 2 people, you might feel bad taking up a whole top. Don't worry, I've never seen it get super packed.

The Pho is what I get here. I usually just get the Pho with Rare and Flank steak. It's always been pretty good for me. You can get a baked french roll for 50 cents with was a nice addition to the Pho. The Thai tea was also pretty delicious.

The service is nice. It always feels like a bunch of high school kids working there, but there are pretty attentive and nice. Always looking to refill the water in your cup.

This summer, Las Vegas Weekly named the banh mi thit cha as one of the top 10 sandwiches in Vegas. They are dead wrong. The banh mi thit nuong is way better.

Both banh mi thit (please spell it correctly) are $3.25 and both come in a small baguette with pickled carrots and daikon, hot peppers (note from tongue to self: make sure they remove this next time!), and a bunch of some kinda butter or margarine flavor enhancer. The difference is that thit nuong is grilled pork. It has sweetness and all the pork flavor you would expect. The ham, steamed pork, and pate in the banh mi thit cha is all too mild in flavor. Top 10 in Vegas? It might only be top 10 on the restaurant's menu because there's only 10 sandwiches.

Get the banh mi thit nuong. It's not as good as banh mi thit I've had in San Jose, but it'll do for Vegas. Or you might try the banh mi trung chien lap xuong, which I've gotta have next time. Fried eggs with (sweet) chinese sausage? Count me in.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,4,1,4,FxLSiTp83og2ernSlIcKXQ

With the crispy flaky bread& slaw ( the BBQ pork was my fave) but i probably won't be back after my last visit! Ordered the pho, had flank steak, tendon, beef? And tripe, ordered with no tripe! And got some funky meatball concoction! Also had more tripe and tendon than any other meat!! Of course no one checked back! We had ordered crispy spring rolls and sent those back as an appetizer, they were cold and not fried when we ordered the fried, the waitress who barely spoke English took them back, and the people behind the counter ate them in full view of us!! With there rubber gloves on, than proceeded to make the next persons sandwich with the same gloves on!! Poor guy!! Well when they came out they were microwaved and more chewy than crispy!! Double gross! Also the pho came out lukewarm and meat even tho thinly sliced took awhile to cook in broth!! Speaking of the broth it was very tangy and gosh I really don't kno how to describe it, but was not up to par the way it used to be ( we joked that maybe we really pissed them off and well ...... The bathroom is in full view of dining and two employees did go before we got our pho, just saying!!) my friend tried adding soy sauce , hoisen sauce everything , but that weird flavor didn't go away and finally gave up ! He only maybe had 1/5 of it, if that, and gave up, me I ate the noodles, & what beef there was, but really couldn't get into the broth either! So I left it!! When paying we told them we didn't like it and if they wanted to , go look at the table and see what we left ,nothing was taken off the check, and no real apology was given! I think we even payed for the first spring rolls that were the waitress's mistake! For 2 people it was over 35$ so I know I got ripped, but I was angry at their in different attitude and in turn they lost a customer !! Not that u go there that often about every 6 or 7 weeks but this last time will definetly be my last !! Poor food , poor service , and over priced go to Chinatown and get some options of pho eateries!! Hope this helps!!

I lowered it 1 star after reading some other reviews, cuz both my friend and I did get sick after eating there!!

Bahn Mi sandwiches are not hard to find in Vegas. But beef wrapped onion certainly is! I didn't discover until I moved to CA, and so far this is the only place  in Vegas that I have found has it. It is the juiciest, most flavorful and tender morsels of marinated flank steak rolled up with perfectly cooked onion slices inside. Honestly, I could just pull the wraps out and eat the veggie sandwich separately. And the price? A mere $5.00! Best value in town. 

I have been lunching here for years- on the usual suspects- pho tai, fresh spring rolls and such. Menu is large, service is great, ambiance is casual and clean. Plenty of small tables that easily fit together for your large gatherings. Now I will be back much more often for my new favorite which may become yours! Long live bo hahn huong!

Right when I walked in there was a cart full of fresh baguettes!!! I was so happy I called in and order a bahn mi. The smell alone made me hungry. The bahn mi was around $5 and it was bugger than a 6"" at Subway. 

As much as I wanted to down this bad boy, you know you cannot eat bahn mi's in the car.  FYI! The crunch of the baguette will dirty your car in an instant. Find a place, sit down, and let the flakes fly everywhere!! 

The meat was so good and the pickled cabbage was fresh. 

The parking is a bit sketchy but once you go inside it's clean and get a great welcome from the staff. The restaurant is definitely family owned as everyone was so nice.

I did like the vermicelli bowl, I am not a fan of shrimp, but I loved these ones as they seemed grilled and marinated. The pork was tender and had a delicious marinade, and the vermicelli freshly made. 

I however did not like the egg rolls. The texture on the inside was mushy and flavorless, and I wish in my vermicelli bowl that the fresh veggies were not under the warm vermicelli.

The egg rolls were well made. They were crispy, had a good ratio of pork & veggie stuffing to-wrapper, and not too greasy or soggy at all. 

The pho was delicious and one of the  best I have tasted in Las Vegas so far. The broth was not too salty & had good flavor. The ratio amount of sliced beef, spring onions, and noodles was justifiable. The garnish toppings of Thai basil and bean stouts was fresh. I have had pho from other places were there was hardly any sliced beef, overloaded with noodles, and the broth was either too salty, flavorless or the garnish toppings were not crisp n fresh.

I will return to Pho Thanh Huong as I am a fan of banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) and I want to try those on my next visit. They looked delicious. 

I finally went back to Pho Thit Huong and tried the Banh Mi Nuong sandwich and it was better than I expected.

What I like most about this restaurant is that they give plenty of fresh side fixings to go with the pho or noodle soups. Either for take out or dine in, they give lots of bean sprouts, Thai basil leaves, sliced jalepenos, and sliced lime. However, if you do want more chili sauce or hoisin sauce to go, just ask for it. Otherwise, you get one small container of each. The bun bo hue was decent. Not too spicy and had a decent amount of meat. The regular size pho was enough to split for two or one really hungry person.

I haven't eaten a lot of bahn mi since moving to Vegas, and I really like them so I was excited to give this place a try.  Since I've been making pho at home for every meal I eat in, I wasn't about to order their pho.  THAT would just be pho-king extreme.

I ordered the spring rolls and #57, which I think was steamed pork and pate.  Can I just say, YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!!!  The spring rolls could've used a little more meat and shrimp, but it was still really good.  It wasn't dry and rubbery like some spring rolls tend to be when it's not fresh.  My sandwich was so delicious. The bread is impossibly crispy and soft at the same time, and the fillings were ample.  I loved the subtle sweetness in the mayo that they use here as well.  If I am craving bahn mi, I will definitely stop here. For a mere 3 bucks a pop, sign me up!

One negative is that the server never came back to refill my water even though it was sitting on the edge of the table empty for nearly the entire meal.  Just don't expect too much out of the service here, but again, 3 bucks a pop!",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,1,1,4,WwhW2qodb9veHtlPKLC9Mg

They have their own ovens back there to bake their own French bread, which makes these sandwiches even more ideal!  We got the recommended #1 Grilled Pork (Banh mi Thit Nuong) with pate added as well as the #13 Grilled Chicken with Pate (Banh mi Pate Ga).

Both sandwiches were so good, great flavor and a nice heat from the jalapenos.  

What a steal for three sandwiches for $10!  Definitely the place to go to grab some banh mi for the road!

Stick to the sandwiches and maybe the pho - don't try the Hainan chicken rice dish.  It was VERY dry, probably among the worst I've had!  It was old and definitely not something theyspecialize in!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,8,4,4,GcgIj6C4e_72D_KY2zqcTw

I went for rare steak pho and a Bahn mi with charbroiled pork. 
 

The pho was piping hot and flavorful. Initially after tasting I told myself the broth was missing something. Maybe it could be a little more flavorful. Then it hit me duh it's missing lime ! After that it was A Ok ! Not my favorite broth I've tried but the fact that they gave a huge amount of noodles and meat made up for it. They definitely are not stingy with Portion at $8.50 a bowl. The Bahn mi came out with the pho. Crusty baguette bread loaded with meat and vegetable. I did enjoy the Bahn mi but I'd have to say I would have enjoyed more vegetables on it. 

After eating that delicious pho I only took a few bites of the Bahn mi and took it to go and enjoyed it later. Still good it's just better to eat it fresh when the bread it's till warm and toasty.

I like it, but I do not absolutely love it. The bread is so delightful they should make it a foot long! Alas, the sandwiches are a little small. They offer a tofu option, which I appreciate, but their tofu filling is not especially flavorful. It tastes like tofu, not necessarily bad, but not miraculous. They could spice that bean curd up a bit.

As for the pho, I would describe it as good, not flavorless, but also not the best. Plus, they aren't able to serve up a vegetable filled pho, which as you may know is my standard for judging pho places.

Lastly, the service has always been haphazard when we have visited. The last time they were out of jalapenos. What? And, it was unclear if there was really a waiter in the dining area, as no one consistently checked in with us and it took a while for our food to come out. Plus, their menu pricing and what they charge doesn't seem to be the same. We have been confused by our bill on both occasions. Be sure to double check your bill if you go!

I think this is a very good and convenient pho spot besides traveling to China town. Average price for two pho's and a spring roll would be roughly around $26-$28 with tax.

I normally get the same items: egg rolls, Thai tea and a bowl of pho. The egg rolls are warm and crunchy, and the filling is tasty. The pho is always steaming hot...the broth is good.

Dude, this is my favorite banh mi place evoooooore! It's really inexpensive and the ingredients are super fresh.  The bread is freshly made, and they have a ton of selections. I really like the chinese egg and sausage banh mi and the charbroiled pork one. MMMM! The sandwiches are about $3-$4, so it's handy for broke college students like myself (also located across the street-ish from the Trop garage of UNLV). I've had pho from here too, and it was pretty decent, but I usually just go for banh mi.  The soup was just cause I was sick that day and had to study haha. Still tasty nonetheless. 

Downsides: This place smells like smoke! gaaah, horrible.  I recommend taking your food to go, unless you like the taste/smell of carcinogens with your food.  Also, the service when you're seated is kinda slow.  I drink a ton of water and the refills didn't come quick enough after I loaded my sandwich with Sriracha.  Plus, they don't really have consistent waiters or whatever.  It's like everyone is doing everthing? I'm not sure. Personally, that's not really a big deal for me since I feel like most authentic Asian restaurants have that same kind of attitude, but sometimes people wanna be dined for real so be cautious 0.0 

Overall, I'd definitely come back...and back...and back again.  It's tasty, low cost, and it's right by school, which is the biggest seller for me.  It's something different from Chipotle or whatever is around campus.",wxDM6hqyW5OPp5cXzn6F0w,4,1,4,faQCMlXKb9dHixXxSLI71w

Anyway, we weren't greeted immediately and being my first time...Wasn't sure if we had to seat ourselves or they seat us. Apparently, you seat yourselves. 

Once we assessed which table we were going to rest our elbows on because gosh knows when there are madd tables (I typed, madd. Dang...do people still use the term?) open...the first world problems kick in.

The restaurant is pretty spacious--clean too. Staff were friendly and pretty prompt.

Onward...Never been but knew I wanted a banh mi. So I opted for their grilled pork banh mi sans the jalapenos por favor. I even said please! My sandwich caMe with jalapenos. No biggie, nothing my fingers can't pick out. Bread was toasted wonderfully, meat was full of flavor, and it certainly filled the inside of that baguette wonderfully. I was bummed though because I swear I only seen cucumbers in there. If there were the usual pickled veggies...they were scarce. Scarce like there was a radish and carrot drought. Scarce like Bugs Bunny cultivated the crap out of them carrot fields. Scarce like somebody plucked all the carrots in the world to make some juice because homeboy was trying to improve his eyesight. And then the radish fields....uhh..ummm...must've been a bad crop month or something. Lol.

I'm not a pho person so didn't have that. Overall, it wasn't all that bad. I'm still a kinh do banh mi lover. Felt the prices were typical of other vietnamese locations. 

I say...if you are in the vicinity, want a different view from your usual, don't have a preferred vietnamese spot, and this is the fare you are craving...well go get 'um tiger. If you are a UNLV student, perfect! If not, Chinatown is about 10mins away if you can hold your stomach in. Despite the disappointment in veggie ratio...the meat made up for it so it certainly hit the spot. 

Ample parking, definitely stroller and kid friendly, and based on my friend's opinion...he lerrrves their tofu spring roll. So for you vegeterians or tofu lovers, just may wanna try that out.

I try to be as impartial as possible when trying a new place, but I'm not quite sure what's going on with this place. We arrived around 12:30pm and expected a lunch rush. The place was mostly empty, maybe 6 tables out of 17 had customers dining. With two other parties in front of us, we were told we had to put our names on a list and wait to be seated. It only took 5 minutes to be seated, but given that so many tables were empty, waiting at all seemed odd. 

The hostess is very friendly and delivered menus and took our order quickly. We ordered pho and a bahn mi sandwich and were given the usual plate of condiments to go with it, but it was missing the Thai basil and cilantro. When we asked about it, the server said they recently started omitting these items from the plate and only served them if customers asked. So that is a little weird to me too. 

My dining companion was served her soup several minutes before my sandwich came out, which is also when the iced coffee I had ordered at the start came out. Also weird. 

But as for the food, the bahn mi sandwich rolls are HUGE. Like...American football sized. And they are GOOD! They were a little skimpy on the jalapeños, but I understand not everyone has a mouth made of asbestos like mine.

Located in the shopping center with Vons or Smiths grocery (not sure which) on the SW corner of Maryland Pkwy and Tropicana. Very nice restaurant, clean, and with plenty of seating. They were playing the football game on TV so +1 for me. 

Ordered the pork chop and a bowl of Pho Tai Chin. Food came out quickly and was decent, the pork chop was kind of small but flavorful. The Pho was very tasty, with plenty of meat to go with the broth. I always taste the broth before adding anything, and this had a nice flavor. A little squeeze of lime and a few bean sprouts and its all warm in my belly.

Its not fancy, but its good. Its not expensive, but its good. Will definitely be back because its easier to get here than to the places on Eastern. Family owned and operated.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,3,3,4,BZ4ZbcsgjOcrNqWzcjAE1A

I thoroughly enjoyed their pho and really liked the consistency of the noodles which were chewier than what I'm used to.  The portion was very generous and there was also a lot of meat in the pho which many other establishments skimp on.  My fiance had their egg and sausage banh mi and loved it.  He said their bread was just like the ones he's had in Vietnam.  We also had their iced coffee which was excellent also.

I've tried a handful pho places whenever I'm in Vegas, but I have to say this is by far one of my favorite places to eat at. I like how they allow you to build your own pho, in which you could choose whatever toppings you like. For my pho I just kept it simple so I chose rare steak and meat balls. The portion is pretty big, I couldn't even finish my bowl of pho, but for the price of 10 dollars, it's pretty much equivalent to 2 pho bowls in OC. I also ordered a side of eggrolls to go with my pho. The size is quite small nothing too special about them, just typical eggrolls and fish sauce. I've had bigger ones back home in California. They also sell banh mi too! Unfortunately I was too full to try them, I should have bought some for the road.

Was craving a BBQ Pork sandwich, loaded with vegetables including cucumbers, carrots and the white one (which is so honestly called ""white carrot"" when translated my way) and Cilantro! 

Delicious, friendly staff and the bread comes out warm (possibly due to heating in a conventional oven before the goodies are inserted) but still nonetheless satisfying. I prefer this style of banh mi versus the Lee's baguettes or any baguettes for that matter since they're much tougher and tend to shred the top of my mouth.

I ordered the spring rolls and a bowl of rare steak pho. My order took a while, at least the pho did. The rolls came out within 5-10 minutes. I was half way through and I heard the microwave being used and I thought why? Lol so probably 5 minutes later my big bowl of soup was served. The steak was a bright red which appears to be fresh, good sign. I add all the side items to it and taste the broth and the flavor was ok, not bad. However it lacked a lot of seasoning. Being that I've lived by naval military bases which are located in a heavily populated Asian community I consider my opinion or rather my palette on the experienced side when it comes to PHO lol just saying lol So anyways, I was disappointed that my broth wasn't like fresher since it cooled down pretty quickly and that took away from the dining experiences with pho. Your mouth experiences heat, flavorful broth, seasoning like Anise, etc and some decent tasting beef. I unfortunately didn't experience that today. It was OK but not the best I've had in a while.

5915504,2012-12-09,1,GMrwDXRlAZU2zj5nH6l4vQ,"I used to frequent this place on occasion because of the location and they offered semi decent food. 

However, a couple weeks ago I had one of the worse experiences of my life. I had walked in literally a minute before closing, so they were not the most friendly. However, they still had a restaurant full and if they didn't want anyone to come in, they should have locked the doors. (which they did after I walked in)

I ordered special combo Pho with extra tendon to go along with a grilled pork banh mi. The wait was short and easy. I paid for my food and was on my way home.

Me and my hunny shared the banh mi, which was half ass put together. I had a piece of cucumber which was literally 1/3 of a cucumber that was just thrown on there. And not to mention almost a whole jalapeno that was just on one side of the sandwich. Talk about lazy and no attention to detail. 

So after we finish the banh mi, I pour my broth in a pot to warm it up and get it steaming hot so my meat can warm up too. When I go to open the container up, the first thing I look at is my tendon and considering I paid almost $2.00 for extra tendon, I felt ripped off. My rare meat, not even cooked had a light brown tinge to it, which means it was not fresh. 

And then to make things worse, two little flies or gnats or whatever they were flew out of the bay leaf and bean sprout pile and completely ruined my appetite.

In utter disgust, I threw it all away and almost felt the need to vomit.

I used to like this place. But now, you will never ever catch me here, no matter how bad I got a craving for Pho or  banh mi.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,3,3,1,4SAGQrlLRqu8c5tJb1EzPw

I came here years ago before I was on Yelp and thought they were good, but only if I happened to be in the neighborhood while craving Vietnamese.. They had pretty good sandwiches, but I just didn't end up back here again until today. 

I ordered a grilled beef banh mi and Thai tea with boba. The sandwiches looked a lot different than I remembered them. The French bread they use is enormous and much bigger than on my previous visit. The meat they used was a little different than I'm used to in banh mi. It was a little smokier than I like but very moist. It was a little on the messy side. They packed it to go in a way that was difficult to eat without dripping meat juice all over myself while I ate. The pickled veggies were hidden under the meat which made them a little soggier and less crunchy. I'll have to ask them to put the veggies on top next time so they stay fresh and don't drown in meat juice. The bread was really great. A little breadier than I'm used to, more like a bolillo shape than French bread but very flaky and light. The Thai tea with boba was good. A little on the sweeter side, but still good. 

The price is right, so I'll definitely give them another chance if I find myself in the area again. I was perusing the menu and their pho and other hot menu items seemed to run on the more expensive side compared to other pho restaurants I frequent.
