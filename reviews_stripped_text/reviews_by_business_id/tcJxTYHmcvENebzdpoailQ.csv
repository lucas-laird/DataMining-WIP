3025011,2017-12-04,0,tcJxTYHmcvENebzdpoailQ,I frequent this specific location because it is the closest one to my house. Always a good experience. Friendly staff and the subs are always fresh and tasty. I especially enjoy their large tuna. I go early as lunchtime can be very busy.,IfX18Uxx_zjipapPOG7CwQ,0,0,5,qgoTZ027JWMTSNjxUZkR7g

Ever wonder how clean a restaurant is behind them closed doors? Like many of the Subways I visit, service was great and the food was fresh! What makes this Subway different is that I was able to take a peek behind the scenes of this fast food restaurant.

I ended up here during an off campus field trip for my HVAC class. My professor was able to set up a date with Ben (manager) for us students to check out how their fridges, freezers, and A/C units are maintained on a quarterly basis. After a long 4 hours of detailed information and walk throughs which many of you would not understand or even care about, all of us were pretty amazed with how often these systems actually need to be cleaned to prevent buildup from occurring. 

Let's just say that if you personally seen the amount of calcium/lime accumulated within 3 months in ice machines, you would not want to get ice from any low end restaurants out there.",A1yK1QyPaahfwp38zqn2Bg,5,2,5,YwIw-K1tD-xXFCQMpVv6Tw
