21830,2017-04-06,1,bFUWmRKsCkborKVe6oaA5g,I have been going to this jack in the box since I moved to this side of town for about three years now and I have always had decent experiences. Today I went in there to use the bathroom I just went through the drive through and I got inside and tried to go into the bathroom and for one it was locked which I absolutely hate. For one its unsanitary for the workers to go unlock the bathroom every time and secondly it is just purely annoying and an inconvenience. So then I proceed to ask if she could unlock the restroom when she is done with the customers and didn't respond ( hey I will be with you after I take care of them) no she said nothing. So once she finished with them she unlocked the bathroom for me and when I went into the bathroom she said next time the paying customers come first. Which absolutely infuriated me I am a paying customer and for one anyone who walks into your business place should be treated with customer service. I know it's fast food but work on your customer service skills. There will be no next time.,4Bifp4jfdGx32PIWLxrGvg,0,0,1,N-qmRjSPTwBJXlnrpMkc8g

Thus my reason for two stars, poor customer service and this place seems to horde condiments.",dnp-e7SBVygsGo0TQXGTWQ,1,0,2,sR3thOGP5rqE4GpywZb6nw

The only thing I could say is to try it, see how you like it, and go from there.

The service was go to go as I ordered up some cheap double burger with curly fries and a soda pop.  With items purchased, I sought out a quite spot in the parking lot to stuff me face.  The surrounding area was sketchy.  Lot's of shadiness out and about.  Stop, grab, move, stop, until I felt like I could devour my meal safe and sound. The meal was made with efficiency but not much love.  What does one expect when dining from a get and go commercial trough.  All in all.....an A-OK experience.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,3,5,3,Kvf3HLPLoLT31bDPQfazsg

The three visible staff didn't even move this time. The drive thru pathway shows you the employees (can't call them workers) just sitting there. 

I will drive over to Ann and Decatur. Jack would be sorely disappointed with this location.",fdaFWAz_qZy53S2N-z5Kbg,0,0,1,x5ApV_UtE0h2cSpsE1NgtQ

Every time I get my meal, the fries are hot and so are the chicken strips. And don't get me started on how delicious the chockate oreo milkshakes are. They are always so thick and it sends my taste-buds on a journey. The customer service at this specific Jack in the Box is excellent as well.",uepq44B_7tMGEeVX2hxM6w,0,0,3,18lkXTgC_No5Jzvz9Hhk_Q

I drove to the window and honked my horn and one of the employees came to the window and let me know they were temporarily closed because the people suppose to be helping on his shift had not gotten there yet.

Now I understand things happen however when I drove back around to the driveway I saw the employee I had just spoken with standing outside talking to 2 other employees that appeared to have just gotten off duty. 

Now I know if there shift was over they are not required to stay, however if they were just going to be standing around in the parking lot talking and making jokes they could have easily stayed in the kitchen until someone released them.

Other than this trip I would rate the customer service to be about 4 out of 5 and the food to be about 4 out of 5 as well for a fast food restaurant.",IsaN7PgWOYgm8SoMnM9QUA,1,0,2,5UcMJLnbOVjIAs-2NTntPw

The staff has always been friendly to me, the service fast compared to some ""fast"" food places I have been, and the food always good for what it is.

As to another review here I always get butt-loads of condiments where i actually have a little horde of sweet n sour sauce's banked up in my fridge lol.",8-OX2_HEYDbArnMSDyJe5g,0,0,4,AsXRYRyMZHysrw3sIusR3A

I've eaten at at least a dozen Las Vegas locations and often order the new breakfast sandwich which has waffles for rolls and it is awesome.  At my last visit to this location they served it on tasted really hard crusty waffles instead of the usual moist soft waffles.

Too bad that is for McDonalds Big Mac and not Jack In The Box's Bonus Jack.  The Bonus Jack just falls short, in my opinion.  I'm not sure if there were onions on it or not.  Shredded lettuce for sure.  But what looked like possible onions may have been,  in fact, tiny bits of lettuce.  And there was no sesame seed bun.  The sauce is different too.  More red than the secret sauce on the Big Mac and a bit sweeter.  The burgers are very similar to each other.  Call me a traditionalist but I prefer the Big Mac hands down.  From the onions to the sauce, the Big Mac is a superior classic.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,0,0,3,Bf66EUO3Xsf3IotH-t-Zsw

5054948,2015-11-08,0,bFUWmRKsCkborKVe6oaA5g,"There were five cars in front of me in the drive-thru, and I hesitated to stop because I thought that line was doomed to be a dreadful 10-20 minute wait. But the line made space for me seconds later, as if it read my mind. I was handed my food three minutes later (if even), greeted with apologies for what only a total arsehole would call an unreasonable delay, AND my order of fries was upgraded to the next size up as an olive branch. My order was filled perfectly, and, having finished my entire meal comfortably at home 20 minutes later, I feel like I should have generously tipped.

My point is that I get the feeling the employees are being worked like race horses which is not healthy. There's no reason why people should feel the need to apologize for doing their jobs really quickly and without mistakes. I can't imagine they're getting paid enough for that.

Thanks, Jack-In-The-Box crew around the time I wrote this! You're doing more than well and can totally afford to relax just a bit.",QnssWsiku9RARVhfOF2gyg,0,0,5,TK33vSloEQ_qoFWkGtUzFw
