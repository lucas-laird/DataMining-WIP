2323036,2014-04-22,0,JzmJCDSJ_35kJgAlxcZDqQ,Quick place to grab a bite while at Meadows Mall. There is usually a line during lunch but it moves fast compared to some of the other places in the food court. The food trays are usually full and the food is fresh for a Panda Express. Generally in and out at this location with no problems,zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,0,0,4,5l54ZiZwvYBywwlT1BnMXw
3065040,2017-07-26,0,JzmJCDSJ_35kJgAlxcZDqQ,I love Panda Express so I came to this one. I stood in line and there was one lady working that I could see. I was behind the person ordering their food. Then a man walks up to the glass in front of the food basically cutting me in line. The worker woman had looked at me multiple times already and knew my place in line but she served this random dude who just showed up. I had already been standing in line for a while at this point. I looked at both of them in amazement and the lady didn't even acknowledge me. So I walked away in frustration. Never coming here again.,vSb-XS53a8zSp_AQrgMNBg,0,0,2,9uDEsuTx9qkHP25b502Nmg

The food was good--- there was nothing wrong with mine (hence my rating): fried rice, beef with broccoli, and sweet fire chicken (the boy & I split this), except my husband had lots of chicken pieces containing joints (the problem with getting chicken thighs; if it were me, I have to dispose these parts into a napkin, 'cause I don't like eating this); more so than other PE locations, he noticed. 

Anyway, a good value overall, two item plate; usually have leftovers. I always eat the fortune cookies (something I grew up with; in my childhood, we often went to Chinese restaurants on special occasions, the last being my high school graduation night dinner). If you do the survey on the receipt, you get a free item, when you buy a two item combo. As with all their locations, free drink refills.  

There's only one other place here in the food court, that I like to eat, but we usually get PE a couple times a month, 'cause well, my hubby and son are big fans (consistent, fast, convenient, chinese food).",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,1,4,cvdhl9VHTymCy2qsCJsRMg
4406608,2009-06-14,3,JzmJCDSJ_35kJgAlxcZDqQ,"Another fast food place located in the food court a Meadows Mall. My kid like this place so I let him give it a go. 

To me everything looks dried out & very pastey sauces. 

They no longer have crispy beef and the other stuff just looks weird so my son chose ORANGE Chicken w/ half noodles half rice.

Whats up with the Fried rice w/NO pork? Yuk! 

I'm NOT a fan I'd rather go to Pick Up Stix at least its made to order.",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,2,2,2,lZXK88iwt2EcfsR1jtMjyQ
4470136,2013-02-22,0,JzmJCDSJ_35kJgAlxcZDqQ,I stopped by last week for the free Tangy Jumbo Shrimp with an internet coupon.  The restaurant was located in the Meadows Mall in Las Vegas.  I got 3 shrimp with the tails on mixed with red bell peppers and green beans.  I would not pay for the Tangy Jumbo Shrimp.,XKo5IT6o-WslzHPT69PRSQ,0,0,2,dsBA_DgPcCphv4uORYJxQg

When I walked up and ordered a Panda bowl with vegetables side.  They made the veggies fresh while I waited.  Then I added the peppercorn shrimp.  I wish I go more than 6 shrimp with the veggies that come with the peppercorn shrimp, but my whole meal was a total of 270 calories.  It was filling and tasted good.  I enjoyed it.  

When I am not on a diet, I enjoy the cream cheese ragoons.  The mall is right across from my work.  I have no complaints about this place.",kWj6AdUtkvbzhdsqRifwLQ,0,0,3,eYir5emTKliC7PA_ylLztA
