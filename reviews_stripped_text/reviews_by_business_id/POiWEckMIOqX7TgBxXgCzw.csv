The one Star is for the unbelievably rude person working there. I went there on Tuesday 12/26 at approximately 3pm. I ordered my food and attempted to pay with my ATM card which has my picture on it. The person working there insisted on seeing an additional ID because he said I ""Didn't look the same!""  I told him my other ID was in the car, he insisted I go and get it. When I brought it back he scrutinized both ID's for at least two minutes before he swiped my card!  I have used my ATM card constantly with no problems until that day!  The only difference is my hair is longer and there is grey in front. This man was rude and ignorant and I will never patronize that restaurant again!

The female server that helped us was the rudest person ever.  I had a simple question on the menu, she rolled her eyes at me and has the nerve to say what.  So I repeated myself and asked what kind of sauce was on what I would order.  She said what it was and then I said ok I'll have that and she grabs the menu out of my hand coldly.  She then takes my friends order and our food was cooking there after.  Our server never delivers our food to us.  The gentlemen that worked the register brings us our food and we never get checked on until the very end.  

All of the workers than gather at the front table nearest the register and a customer comes in to order his meal.  The female server gets up and takes his order and she again has the same reaction to the customer placing his order at the register.  All the while the customer sees them eating lunch and asks if it's ok to order.  She tells him it will be a few minutes.  The two cooks then get up to go in the back to start cooking.

One of the cooks washed his hand, the other absolutely DID NOT wash his hands at all.  Improperly handling the food and serving the customer who keeps their business going.  

We get our check and no thank you or nothing.  They just continue eating and staring at us as if we are bothering them for coming into their restaurant.

Safe to say, we will never come to this restaurant.  But please guys beware.  Don't trust the service and the cooks because I sure will not.",JJr0F3Qh3DtmuX5_XkESTA,2,0,1,M2J-12xKbs4i9AgKnXKkIg

I have always liked China One and was happy to see that there was one closer to home. 
We started with the fried shrimp as an appetizer - 6  in an order. It wasn't what I expected but happy to say, I was pleasantly surprised. They were tempura shrimp! Sorry for the excitement, but I LOVE tempura shrimp. Entrees ordered were Beef Chow Fun - very nice presentation and great taste. I ordered it extra saucy because that's how I like it and they did not disappoint. Combination Kung Pao - nice presentation, fresh tasting veggies ( lots of them), the shrimp really stood out to me but the whole dish was delicious. 
Strawberry boba and Thai tea boba to go. Delicious! 
We dined in and received great service. 
Very clean and nice atmosphere.

My husband and I had our food delivered earlier than expected which was fantastic. However, my only problem is the customer service. If I had better costumer service I would have given this restaurant 5 stars. I had ordered online on the China One website. It was pretty easy to order from. When I received my email confirmation the order had one different item that I had not ordered. I decided to call the restaurant to see if they had my order right. A woman answered and asked for my phone
 number. She then told me that they didn't have my order. I told her that I had put in an order and she said maybe I had the wrong place to check my email to see where I ordered from. I explained to her that I had placed an online order at that restaurant. She kept insisting that I was wrong and that I was calling the wrong place. After a while she said we dont have your order. OK? Bye. And hung up on me. I was so upset that I tried to find a way to cancel my order but I had no luck. I called back after a while and I asked to speak to a supervisor or a manager. The employee who answered then passed me to another employee and I repeated my concern and she said that the manager was not there and to give her a second. For the next few minutes I felt like the phone was being tossed around to employees like a hot potato. Finally, somebody who I could communicate with spoke to me to verify my order. It was so rediculous of how unprofessional, unorganized and unknowlegable the staff is. By the time I was done verifying my order I had a headache. I just dont understand how it took 20 minutes just to make sure they had my order correct. I would have requested to cancel my order but that probably would have taken hours to do.

The first wrong order was a completely different item than we ordered and they got very irritated when we told them it was wrong and the employees were all yelling at each other.  Awkward.  Second time we ordered it was two dinner specials and instead we got individual items.  Not a big deal except that then there wasn't enough egg rolls and things to go around.  I honestly can't figure out what the problem is.  We knew we had issues last time so we showed the cashier what we wanted on the paper menu...did not help.

HONG KONG STYLE CHOW MEIN. YOU MUST TRY! Believe me, every legit Chinese restaurant, even in Chinatown MUST have this dish. Most Americanized Chinese takeout places, even Panda Express and PF Changs DON'T have this dish. Even some Chinese restaurants in San Francisco don't have this dish. But here it's featured, and it's a must try. By far my favorite food. Sure you could drive to our Chinatown in Vegas but this place is so convenient for us here in North Las Vegas.

The Seafood Chow Fun and House Special Fried Rice had shrimps the size of large prawns!

And don't even get me started on the service, it's not your standard takeout place, they'll serve you so well. And this is straight from the humble owner.

I should've listened to my Grandma who's been coming here for months since there grand opening. They remembered her and even brought her complimentary egg rolls for keep coming back!

They even had a wide selection including boba - and I have to say that you won't find a place with this quality, variety, cleanliness, and service for miles! 

I hope this place stays here and becomes a staple!

Give them 5 stars for delivery.. Food in 20 minutes deserves nothing less!

The food itself gets 3 stars. We ordered Mongolian beef, which was not cooked as dark as I thought it would be from the picture, but still had great flavor. Also, the beef was a little softer than I expected. We also ordered orange chicken, which wasn't the best either. It was dry and the flavor didn't seem fresh. We each got an order or shrimp fried rice and pork fried rice. The pork was different than what we're used to being from NY. It was a strip of pork rather than the small pieces we get out there, so that was shocking. shrimp fried was great! Shrimp much bigger than the ones in NY. The other issue with the pork fried rice was we asked for no vegetables and there were peas and carrots in it. 

Price gets 2 stars. This meal, was $34! That's a lot for Chinese food.  But, for good food who cares! However, this food didn't taste like $34 meal. They charge $5.25 for fried rice. You don't get he option of white or fried. So that was an extraordinary $10.50 just for rice. If it weren't for that, the price would've been fine. 

We will likely give them another chance before we decide they're a final no.",RmOGhgrBSs1kU6cZ6G8eAg,2,1,3,WGPQnIxZASfaQ3xCrbfBIg

Thanks guys!!!",kyeWEMHkh7FmiMP1gixiyA,4,1,5,slAAyArnDXfi11jkav3WiA

I asked that tofu be added, like I've done at other establishments.  I get all the way to work, there's shrimp in my order, I return to the restaurant, explain that I'm allergic.   Asked if it comes without shrimp.  It does not.  Well that info was in the hand menu, not on the wall.  Understandable.  I'm new.  I'm good until the owner proceeds to tell me, ""you have to tell us"", that ""I have to READ the details"".  Then he says he can ""pick"" out the shrimp.  Do u understand, I CAN'T pick out the shrimp.  I will DIE.  He snatches my order, is visibly angry...this man isn't fixing any food for me.  I asked for my money back, reminded him that I was looking to be a return customer....but yeah not returning this location or any other.....",dIkaQF3XM0Oe-eWmZA1WfA,0,0,1,3ITSLxnZ7d8QdMhzOvQp1Q

We try different dishes each time and everything has been great. The only downside I've discovered so far is they use the iconic Chinese food folding box for most entrees instead of the styrofoam containers, and it causes food near the bottom to go soggy if you don't remove it from the box quickly.",SLTN3Iy8dGKn-VkxeLNNmQ,1,0,5,OsIBMsTplHRJV2KpnOXIdg

The Family Dinner is a great value and everything was delicious. I wish there were more entree options for the family dinners and that they had pot stickers and egg rolls with pork instead of chicken and veggies respectively, but these are small concerns considering the quality of the rest of the food. 
We will definitely be ordering here again.",yab1cq5yzrTHzoyz8LYqYQ,0,0,5,XZ4M-BSV4ejhPpw8d3zgoA

I ordered Mongolian beef and veggie chow mein. Yum, it was delicious. The mogolian been was really spicy but great flavor. It went well with the veggie chow mein, as the chow mein was a little sweet and had broccoli and mushrooms.
Can't wait to try their lunch specials. So much to choose from on their menu. So happy I've found a new Chinese restaurant in NLV. Will definitely be back again and again!",3lbcTFGtEHPvZhVxowxHBg,2,1,5,FEpihe6VnPAvWGJSbthXDg

Egg drop soup was literally egg and really hot water. The house rice had 3 pieces of shrimp after I had just asked for $3 extra shrimp . Everything needed salt and the beef was like gum.
