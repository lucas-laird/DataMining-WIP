I didn't try the mexican menu because I wanted peruvian food, and man it was nasty! everything was pre-prepared and was not at all authentic. their papas a la huancaina was not at all(in taste, presentation, ingredients, anything!) like in huancayo, and never in peru have I seen ceviche drowning in a creamy, white sauce! their chicha morada had no purple corn taste, only sugar, lemon and cinnamon.",PaBOdDfrgs1n4qPWNlUARA,1,0,1,C1QXhiEcccGksKwA3OgkOg

Finally the rest of the world is catching up with what South Americans have always known, Peruvian cuisine is among the best in the world.  Now Las Vegans can taste for themselves.

More specifics coming soon....",btUugfufQAe-QD6gC_Ckmw,0,0,5,N8DoXYt3lAc-cxTRFHcFSg
