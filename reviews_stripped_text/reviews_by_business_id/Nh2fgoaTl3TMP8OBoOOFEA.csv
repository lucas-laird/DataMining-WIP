Menu was very limited. 
Maybe they should call John Taffer to help them out.",jFAZq2ntyxrlixFB9bcJ7Q,0,0,1,7yMm8BYDoM_DQarJODtBFg

Although the lasagna was well priced at  $16 we felt the Burger $15 was a little much.  As was stated in an earlier review the interior was very spacious and has a bar.  We were there about  7pm on a Saturday and there were only three tables occupied  (including ours).  I did like that the menu was only one page long, so it wasn't like I was reading a book",SzSvDsJZKtPmgl0NmYjXLg,0,0,3,tGmGhLH_4-SbeJLCWISQKQ
