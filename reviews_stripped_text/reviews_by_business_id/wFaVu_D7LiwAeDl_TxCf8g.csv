I just had to write a review after eating here last weekend.

I ordered ""com tam bi cha thit nuong""

OMG

the ""cha"" tasted like it has been frozen for 2 months and reheated in the microwave before serving it to us

the ""bi"" did not have any taste

the ""thit nuong"" was not palatable",p2DC1ydWhaECCSaT4u7nJg,1,0,1,_Y6ZczACYoHTxjg9e0Ut8Q

I ordered a dish that I did not enjoy at all. The dish tasted really bad, even with the sauce! As a result of my first taste of the dish, I did not touch any more of it. I told a waiter that I did not like the dish and that I did not want to pay for it, as I did not even eat it! So there I sat, HUNGRY, while my friends ate and enjoyed themselves. The waiter came back with words from the manager that they could not do that - but why? My group of friends did not even pay yet. I was not asking for a refund. I was asking to not pay for something I did not like and did not eat. What ever happened to goodness guarantee? 

In all, my last day of high school was not how I would have liked it. This was also my first time at a Vietnamese Restaurant - horrible impression, but I know all of the are not them same.",T3kuKHFbmk3raKkMAf1GYQ,0,0,1,M6QnUJu4X-ifTQrlsJGOBw

The food is not bad here, wouldn't say spectacular, but if you're looking for a nice bowl of pho or some spring rolls you'll be pleased.  Prices are very reasonable.

They have two menus, one vietnamese and one chinese, so its kind of like two restaurants in one.  

Service is decent.  You order your stuff, they bring it to you, and then they leave you alone.  They're definitely not there to be your friend.

One thing to keep in mind, the aircon is cold, the bowls of pho are large and wide meaning that you need to eat  fast or else your stuff is going to be cold in no time.

The value and convenience keeps me coming back time and time again.  Don't forget to load up on supplies at ranch 99 afterwards.",ENFa63YugoJ2C-TUCIJP9g,1,0,3,54T8iOPKy0bDOaABApRuoQ

Pretty average pho restaurant. Your servers speak mandarin. I got the supreme large bowl of pho but it really wasn't that big. However, extra noodles only cost $1 and they give you a ton if you order extra.

Nothing exceptional or memorable. If it was a dedicated vietnamese/pho restaurant I'd probably rate it higher. Instead, this place is like a cantonese place combined with a vietnamese place so you have the decor and service of a chinese restaurant. Decent food but not necessarily presented authentically or professionally.

Unfortunately, today's experience was not the same, with both food and service.

Ownership has been switched, from Vietnamese to Chinese. If I wanted Chinese food I would have gone to Sam Woo restaurant in this same plaza.

Pho ""Vietnam"" has lost its authenticity. I ordered Pho Tai and received watered down broth, with ""well-done"" instead of ""rare"" beef. ""Tai"" means rare - FYI. My Vietnamese ice coffee was served in a ready-made to-go plastic cup. That is NOT an authentic Vietnamese coffee, or style. There was a sour/tart after-taste, too! 
When this place was under Vietnamese ownership, EVERYONE received the true coffee-drip method for their Vietnamese coffee.

I am disappointed. I hope this review will prevent potential customers from coming here. There is a near by pho restaurant that serves real Vietnamese food and is owned by Vietnamese people. Pho Kim Long.",55n5mGPyO5AprFFf6rAZMA,1,1,1,ag4wI6Tl4X38iKvB6DVNfA

I love the Pho here but it's LA and Chicago that have the best beef broth. Adding fish sauce that they have on the table as a condiment really helps make the broth tastier. The bean sprouts and basil are always fresh and the beef served in the broth with tendon and tripe is my favorite and very tender and juicy. 
I also like the spring rolls they serve. Very fresh and good amount of pork and shrimp so they are not skimpy with that and is not overloaded with noodles like in some restaurants.

The service I received here was the worst at a pho restaurant ever. Here are the reasons why:
- We all ordered water with our meals. Water did not arrive for 40 minutes and not until after 3-4 requests for it.
- Of the 9 orders placed for each of us, 4 were not the right order and were redone. That wouldn't be such a problem, but the more ridiculous matter was that the waiters bringing out the orders could not identify what they were bringing out..guessing a number 13,15, etc. what I think was hope of just dumping what they had in hand as the order we had rather than getting it right.
- The last two pho bowls came out 30 minutes after the initial order, which is a ludicrous amount of time for pho, especially since the other bowls at our table came out after 10-15 minutes.
- Lastly, two additional pho bowls were added to our order when the check came.

The food was decent. The pho is about two to three star quality with my main complaint being that the soup was lukewarm even after the 30 minutes of preparation.

However, this was just a really horrible experience and I will never come back here because of the service.",RXCoHt7BBFQN_vjsb8IDjg,4,0,1,DCfBm6qFA7CNl1HHxHj-EA

I went here with my father and step-mother, they had the pho noodle bowls, one tendon and one well done meat.  I had a banh mi sandwich.

I have a strict policy to avoid any restaurant that touts serving a combination of cuisines (e.g., Italian and Mexican, Vietnamese and Chinese) since it's obvious that specializing in one is challenging enough. But it wasn't blatantly apparent from the outside that Pho Vietnam (Vietnamese) and Capital Seafood (Chinese) were one and the same entity.

Craving pho, my boyfriend led us to the door in front of the Pho Vietnam signage even though it clearly read, ""Please use other door."" (We were suffering from denial at that point in time.) After confirming that the Pho Vietnam doors didn't open, we resorted to opening the Capital Seafood doors. I was beginning to fear what was to come. My fight-or-flight instincts started kicking in after I saw ""Vietnamese restaurant"" written in Chinese on the front of Pho Vietnam's menu. By the time our waitress carelessly tossed the Capital Seafood menu in front of us, I was ready to bolt for the door.

Resigned to eating here, my boyfriend ordered the pork & shrimp spring rolls and a bowl of pho (total = $12). The spring rolls were fresh and seemed okay, but the lukewarm pho just wasn't right. It was missing cilantro and lacked the level of green onion I would expect, the beef was tougher than I was used to, and the broth seemed like it originated from a chicken rather than a cow. Blech. 

The verdict: This amalgamation of two restaurants validates my phobia of establishments that serve two or more cuisines. But at least it wasn't an expensive lesson. I just never want to end up in one of these places ever again.",jQ_X7Ob2WB_eH43i_hrSgg,2,1,1,htQhRzWPCcgbpCQmz0b-vQ

We DID in fact ask her some questions about the menu that she apparently had trouble with, so I believe she had to send another young man to our table (who was shaking like a leaf) & was just as unprofessional as she was bc he was just as dismissive.

It's crazy how this place is always packed no matter what day or time you go. When the food is this good I really don't get so picky about the place and it seems that way with every good Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant here in chinatown, they really dont pay much attention to the decor or matching drinking glasses.

I wasn't hungover however, but i still was craving some pho so my friends and i headed to Chinatown. We stopped by Pho Vietnam which was a joint Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant so you have plenty of options to satisfy your asian cravings.

Our hostess/waitress was very nice and got us everything we asked for with no attitude you normally get at a asian restaurant if they're not ignoring you. My friends came in to get pho but we ended up ordering the opposite. I ordered the Nam Vang with the soup on the side and if you don't know what Nam Vang is it's basically a Vietnamese/Cambodian style dry noodle dish. The bowl consists of your choice of noodles (ho fun noodles or pho noodles), shrimp, pork, fish balls, ground pork, cilantro, green onions and if you have never had this dish give it a shot if you see it on the menu. The soup on the side was like twice the size you get from restaurants here in the bay area and the dish is quite good. 

My partner and her cousin ordered the Bun rieu and vermicelli bowl but, it lacked flavor. We realized the person who brought out our food forgot to give us fish sauce for the vermicelli bowl and crab paste for the bun rieu. We asked our nice waitress and we quickly apologized and got us the sauces promptly and made the dishes really good. The ice coffee is a big on the sweet side and was just okay for me.

3182275,2014-01-07,2,wFaVu_D7LiwAeDl_TxCf8g,"This place doesn't even deserve a star. I have never in my whole life been humiliated like this before. This is my experience and I do hope this review stops people from going to this place. It is cruel to even say this but it is what I think this place deserves.

my family and my gf were in Vegas for two days to see what the famous Vegas has in store for us. It was our last day and we were hungry. Came to China town and chose this place to eat because we were too tire, hungry and was in a hurry to find food so we can drive back home before it's too late. Got in, and got served one pot of hot tea. Asked them for a cup of water and we never got it. The price was really really pricey. One plate of stir fry veggies w/chicken was $13 dollars. If you ever gone to cheesecake actory then you'll know how expensive their food is. We stuck w/ with pho since the price was ridiculously pricey. The food wasn't even all that compare to pho in fresno. My pho broth wasn't even hot. Just warm.  Quantity was small (my uncle was actually hoping he wouldnt get hungry in the middle of his 6hrs drive back home, which I think he did because I saw food being microwaved when we were unpacking)

When we were done eating me and my gf went to pay. We did half and half on our cards not that we didn't have money but because we like to help each other out. We did not tip them from our cards because we thought our family would tip since they left the table while we were paying. We went to the restroom and when we came out, the ""owner"" stopped us right before the door and said his waiters & waitresses said there was no tip. He said it so loud I can feel my face burning from embarassment and we could tell other customers were looking at us. He wouldnt let us leave without tipping. We didn't have cash either and my family was already out of the restaurant. So we told him if we can tip them from our credit/debit receipt. He gave us our receipts and by now my gf was furious (thank god she kept control of her temper) tipped him $4. The owner expected me to tip too so he kept saying ""she (me) can tip herself on her receipt."" Since she was mad and humiliated she told me out loud so that he can hear  I already tipped don't tip. Humiliated, mad, and actually threatened by this man I tipped him $1 just so we can hurry and get out before they shoot us or something. We walked out and was like ""wtf was that?""  Not once did they check on us after we got our food btw. My family was thirsty because while we were stuck in that restaurant they were downstairs buying something to drink.

The thing with me and my gf is we started working in restaurants so we know how or what kind of crazy customers they get. We're the type of people who still tip even with rude waiters/waitresses and we had always respect everyone around us no matter what but this kind of behavior from a restaurant is ridiculously out of this world rude. We were all dressed decent, respectful the whole time but we were treated like we couldn't afford food even after we paid $70 for our foods. Actually he made us look like we were diner dashing on him. 

I would never ever come back here because of the way we were treated. Ive always support people on their businesses but to support this business is to say it is okay to act the way they did when its not okay. I encourage others to stay away also unless you have money to blow on food that will still leave you hungry and on tips.  And unless you want to get treated the way we did. For those of you who wants to try it out, good luck and don't forget to tip or else they will fry you.",A7piBtHLIi-00GJy-6YPFw,2,0,1,PEmksg9AiTom87pllEso3A

There are two areas to this restaurant, the nice side and the not so nice side. I'm assuming the nice side was for the dinner crowd and the other was for breakfast and lunch. The side we got seated in was, in my opinion, dirty. The floors looked like he hasn't been mopped in weeks and the tables looked like they have been there since they first opened.

Service here is quick and they speak a multitude of languages. We all ordered the pho and the wait for it wasn't too long; less than 10 minutes.

They brought out two different vegetable dishes for us; one with the thai basil, lime, and sliced jalapeno peppers while the other one had the cooked bean sprouts (they lost it's crunchyness from being cooked... i was wondering why they didn't just bring out the raw ones like all other places and cooked being requests).

The broth was pipping hot and clear. It had a hint of flavor but not too much, it was more on the bland side. After a lot of hoison sauce and plenty of hot sauce, it was fine... it was passable.

Pho Vietnam is located in a huge, sprawling Asian plaza with a 99 Ranch and Volcano Tea. It's a combo pho place and Chinese food restaurant, which would normally make me wary, but my friend the pho expert vouched for its delicious broth. 

I ended up going with the bbq pork and egg roll bun, my favorite selection when I'm not feeling like soup.

The prices were average...and sounds about vegas price. I ordered the beef combo (the largest bowl on the menu), the service was fast and the workers were all very kind, so far so good. When the food arrived, it looked amazing. Had my extra side of white onions + lime + chili garlic...I was ready to go to town. A thing that I realized was that the soup was pretty dark....pretty dark brown...never have I had a pho broth that was so dark...but it was fine. The noodles were fine, but the MEAT...was horrible! Im pretty sure that I chewed on the rare beef for about 5 minutes for me to swallow, and the tripe was super chewy as well too. Pretty soon, my jaw got annoyed and tired and just disregarded the meat all together. The broth was good though!

This venue is probably one of my favorite nightclubs, and the nightclub that I go to most. WHY? Cuz I love house/trance music. Area is very big and very well ventilated as well. The SKYBOX is awesome, as well as the tv screen and light visuals.  If you love electro music, this is def. one of the spots to hit up. Saw Paul Oakenfold, Armin Van Buuren, ATB, Markus Schulz, and some other DJs here as well.

5247749,2015-02-20,0,wFaVu_D7LiwAeDl_TxCf8g,"Pho is in the category of ""soul"" food, where after eating continuous American food during the Las Vegas Fashion Trade shows, I had to have some soup.

This place was actually my third choice from Yelp. I was going to order to go, so I could go back to my hotel room and take my time about savoring it. The first two places were closed, due to Chinese new year.

This restaurant is situated on the second floor of a large shopping center. I entered to order my Pho, the nice gentleman at the counter asked me if I was local. I replied that I was ordering to go, so that I could eat it in my hotel room, and he insisted that I eat there to retain the freshness and the hear. I am glad that I took his advice, because I realized the delicate rice noodles would not have had the same texture by the time I took it back to my room.

The atmosphere was very accommodating and relaxed. I couldn't shake the song that came to my mind as I sat there eating my Pho all alone, observing the other customers. Although it was an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, that night it was full of mixed clients. Oh, what song you ask?  Billy Joel's ""Piano Man"".
Why, you ask?  There was a table full of drunk people, an Asian couple and a white couple. They seemed to be enjoying themselves, but from the effects of hard liquor, they were having a ""party atmosphere"" where it began to spread to other tables.
There was another table, a Hispanic couple who came in as the drunk table of four started a conversation as to spread their intoxicated overflow of cheers. Contrary to my initial perception, the Hispanic couple were not locals at all, and that they were from Arizona. Go figure, it seems that everyone has a story.

Then there was Davy, who's still in the Navy, and probably will be for life. No, the actual guy was not named Davy, and I have no idea if he's in the Navy, but I got the feeling that he was born in Las Vegas, has never been out of Las Vegas, and probably will die in Las Vegas. Such is life. He too, just like me, was eating alone.

Oh, the food?   The funny thing is, Vietnamese Pho has caught on as a fad to us Koreans since the mid 80's. In fact, Pho was so popular to Koreans, that Koreans started Pho restaurants themselves, catering to other Koreans. To us non Vietnamese, variations of authentic Pho is acceptable and perhaps at times even preferred. After all, these are the times that we live, and the country we live, where ""Fusion"" is ever changing things. I would give the Pho, (given my non authentic Vietnamese taste buds) a (3) Star. It satisfied my need for ""soul"" food that night after a long day at the convention center. Overall, I really enjoyed the atmosphere, thus rating overall a (4) Star.

Since it was Thanksgiving, we decided to head to China Town and we all decided on Pho. Entering the complex, we spotted Pho Vietnam and headed up the staircase.

I love watching and smelling it brew, then swirling in the lightly sweetened condensed milk. Also, how long was the premade iced coffee been sitting. Answers I never got; nonetheless, the iced coffee was delightful.

Our Pho came out, it was a decent portions, and a decent price. For me, a great pho has an amazing broth. A simple, yet complex flavor profile. I don't like to add anything other than veggies and spice to my Pho. I had no choice but to try and spruce this up. The broth was less bland than the time I tried instant Ramen. Meh.

The Spring Rolls were deep fried and that's all I can tell you about that. They were fried, you couldn't taste the vegetables inside, which were just mushy and off color. Not even fish sauce could save it. It was, for a lack of a better term, gross.

Pho felt like the right choice and we ubered to Pho Vietnam. I was really confused when I entered the restaurant. Was it Capital Seafood? Was it Pho Vietnam? 

Anyway, we ordered the fried egg rolls to share and then each of us ordered a bowl of noodles. I got the #9 pho. The broth was not super flavorful but it was also thankfully not super salty. The meat was sufficient for the bowl. I have a very hard time eating restaurant pho since my ex's family always made amazing homemade pho. The relationship has been over for almost two years but the one thing I still miss is the pho. For restaurant pho, this place was fine.

I was pleased by the selection of veggies that accompanied the pho. They looked clean (cleaner than many other places) and I liked that they provided ample sliced peppers and juicy lime.",2HchhLgGj16aITZGVy0hqA,1,1,4,zRSWJkjrmxJVaAw67wQxxg
