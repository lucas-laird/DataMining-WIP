The staffs are extremely friendly, the food are delicious, and love the modern interior design. What made it even better, it's extremely PET FRIENDLY! Was waiting outside and people walking by asked me to bring my dog in, they even have dog treat on their menu. 

What I ordered:
-Shack stack burger: extremely flavoured, juicy beef patty with fried portobello, sooooo good! When you take the bite, the warm cheese will explode!!
-Cheese fries: fat food are always good:)
- Summerlin S'more: house made chocolate ice cream with marshmallow and cookie, highly recommended!

First time dining here and I think I'll always stop and go in whenever I see shack shack!",ApVRdMshuTMh5jWMmoZ_1Q,0,0,5,9sF4Xqzg9c7O__Z_1ihx0Q
108577,2016-06-12,0,jBh399TajGcH28Zo2J1pHw,"So I kind of get it. I am an In-N-Out girl, but I can see the hype around shake shack. The regular burger is definitely not comparable to In-N-Out, but they do have a pretty delicious chicken burger and their frozen concrete is something I crave from time to time. The restaurant is in a great location, Downtown Summerlin, somewhere I shop at often so it's convenient for me. 
The chicken burger is delicious as well as the concrete. The strawberry lemonade is refreshing and not too sweet. I also tried the fried tomato, vegetarian burger and I was sick of it after two bites. It had way too much cheese in it that it was overwhelming. The regular BLT is okay, I would prefer in-n-out over theirs any day. The cheese fries are probably my favorite thing on the menu. For the dog menu, my dog definitely gives their poochi-ini a thumbs up (if he had thumbs). 
All together I would give Shake Shack 4 stars at most. However, this 5 star review is really for one of the managers at Shake Shack. I was shopping alone with my dog and the restaurant doesn't allow dogs inside. I couldn't leave my dog outside so the manager, Daniel, kindly came outside to take my order and brought it out for me. He was very kind and went above and beyond to bring out a water bowl for my dog as well. Although this is not something they do often and because it wasn't a very busy evening, Daniel did me this tremendous favor because I was really craving for a frozen custard as well as my dog (it was 100 degrees Fahrenheit that day). I thought it was something very considerate and I appreciate it beyond belief; for that I give this place five stars.",AHjL9W6zA4g_8rrI-zeAEQ,1,0,5,wr4CSDvrcA_x80viOUnoLQ

My husband has been looking forward to trying this restaurant since it opened in Vegas but we just haven't made it over to the New York, New York location on the Strip. When it opened in Summerlin, we went the first day for lunch. The line was long, but the employees were great. They were informative and very helpful, but the food quality was fair at best. We both ordered cheeseburgers and split the cheese fries. The food was served quickly and it was hot, but it was just blah. The burger had no flavor. The bun was not toasted and also flavorless. Neither one of us finished our burger because it was that unimpressive. The fries were a bit better, but I would much rather have In n Out or Five Guys. Probably will not return as the food quality was lacking.",ZpAiOx-wy-XbD0OMI1d7JA,2,0,3,yTDqI5zOhWMFAy-c5luOTw

I'm not going to hate on Shack but it was definitely somewhere below the hype that builds up its rep. At the Downtown Summerlin location the ambiance is awesome. We are talking about a burger joint where you order and sit down, but it definitely has a clean feel and trendy look. 

The burgers were good. Nice portion too, staying away from an oversized portion. Ingredients were fresh from the bun to the tomatoes. Fries were crinkled and crunchy. (None of that soft, high school cafeteria, baked and flaccid fry.) Ketchup was good and they gave me a side of awesome sliced pickles without charging me and with a smile, no less. 

The difference between church-goer and cult follower comes down to a few things for me. We tried the shake and the custard. Not bad, but not great. We've had better, smoother custard and places like Freddy's. And the shake was just ok too. Not bad, but probably won't be a crave-inducing shake. The burgers are good. But they are in the Smashburger category. Similar buns, similar patty and similar ingredients.

I'd recommend the place and have no reason to steer people away. Just putting this place somewhere below the hype.",QwpJwNG_pWr6X8-TkpP9hg,2,0,4,2McFlCR7h3TXOVUR5Q9xqg

I got the Shack Stack @ $7.95 (burger with a patty-sized cheese stuffed portobello mushroom) and fries. The burger/portobello was very tasty, however, rather small, especially for the price. The meat patty itself was pretty skimpy.  The fries were like anywhere else...nothing notable.  

I then had the mint chocolate frozen custard (since I wasn't full from the burger at all) which was  pretty tasty also. $3.60 got a small scoop.  Not cheap, but not outrageous.

There is a saying, don't go or do anything with expectations because you will always be disappointed.  

The hype over Shake Shack is tremendous. I was in NY this summer and didn't get to try it because the line was out the door every day we passed by no matter what time of day it was. Didn't want to wait in line knowing the Summerlin location was opening soon. 
I wanted so much to like it but....in my opinion In'N'Out is better and here is why:

My first shock was the price. Actually I was told the prices were high, but it still made me gasp looking at the prices. 
I was hungry so I ordered the double shackburger($7.99) thinking it would be like a double double from In'N'Out. 
When I saw the burger it was a lot smaller. The meat was probably similar in size, but smaller buns, and much less lettuce and tomato. I prefer the toasted buns from I'N'O as well as fresher and larger portions of lettuce. After eating 3/4 of the shackburger I had no lettuce or tomato left. The bland taste made me reach for some ketchup. You should never have to do that.  
I like krinkle fries and they were good, but I still prefer the fresh fries from I'N'O. 
Ordered two hamburgers for the kids and three shakes. Vanilla and chocolate were okay. I tried the flavor of the week, salted caramel butter. Very good!

So fast food dinner for me and two kids came out to $41.37. Not quite worth it. Would rather pay much less for In'N'Out or Fatburger, or go sit at a nicer place at Bachi Burger for similar pricing. 

Food is good. I will be back to try the custard and concrete desserts. But as I said, will not live up to the hype. If you go, then go with a 3 star rating in mind and maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did.",lx8FUcr12oVA90sRAewO3g,5,0,3,bg5b3x-kDvcGVSY379pd1g

When our beeper went off indicating our order was ready, I went up to get it and saw that only one order of fries was ready.  The young girl behind the counter said our other was cooking and that someone would bring it out in about two minutes.  Her watch must work differently than mine, because two minute came and went and no fries.  We continued to share the one we did get while we ate and waited for the other fries.

I had read how Shake Shacks in N.Y. and L.A. often have lines of customers around the block. On the rainy Friday I went to the Shack here in Vegas, there were no lines but plenty of crowded tables, mostly filled with teenagers.

I got two Shackburgers and an order of fries to go, which I split with my husband at home. He liked the burgers more than I did. To me, they taste like a combination of In-N-Out and Steak and Shake. I love both of those burgers, but they are bigger and are more reasonably priced than the $5.39 burgers here. And I was not a fan of the doughy potato roll. But I do like the crinkle-cut fries here better than the ones at either of the aforementioned spots.

Maybe the ""Shake"" part is what drives the Shack's popularity. But I'm not a big shake fan, so I'll never know. And when it comes to burgers, I think I'll stick with the Double Double.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,3,B2RL7XHncK27c944IY1phg

Lots and lots of options for those of you looking to be adventurous. Burgers, hot dogs, and shakes/custards, etc. I liked that they had beer on the menu. 

Made it a simple lunch, cheeseburger and fries smothered in cheese. Wife had cheeseburger and fries. Kids went with hot dogs and fries. Here's a tip for you just do one order of fries for two or three to share. By the way they are crinkle cut fries. I was not that impressed with the burger. It was good but not great. It was very puny as well. Reminded me of a white castle burger. The bread was really good. I had a few bites of the cheese fries and they were good. My kids were not impressed. They barely touched their hot dogs and fries. I enjoyed the beer and the atmosphere. I am probably a bit bias for in n out and the habit.

For $35 we both got fries, burgers, small soda fountain drinks and I also grabbed a ""bag of bones"" to take home to my pugs. The food was very low quality, my ""Shroom"" burger since I don't eat beef and it sounded delicious - tasted ok but it wasn't worth $7 by itself - maybe if the fries came with it. I technically also ordered the cheese fries just to try and the cheese was this weird melted American cheese with a bland taste to it. Nothing special to them and very boring. 

I officially don't see what the hype about this place is. Will I come back? Sure but is it worth the money being spent? who knows. Maybe I just went during a bad time or the staff is still new and learning but for $35 I was not satisfied.

I also am concerned with their cashier system. It took our cashier 5 minutes to figure out how to use my gift card and instead of asking someone else like her manager for help she just kept yelling at her screen and then finally showed us why she couldn't do her job correctly which made the entire 5 minutes just awkward. We also were the only ones who had to get up to get their food and then this one employee walked around the entire place passing me 3 times before finally realizing it was me to give me the bag of bones I had ordered a while back.

Food wise they primarily serve burgers, hotdogs and fries. My kids ordered shack burger, which is your basic cheeseburger but made extra special with shack sauce. Now the sauce is  on the spicier side and my kids are not like me with heat, so was a bit much for them. You can't help but compare their burger with In N Out and of course, we agreed that In N Out is better. 

I wanted to try a veggie burger but their only choice was portobello burger. I prefer veggie patty so didn't try their veggie burger. 

The cheese fries were good but for the price I felt the portion was small and nothing to wow me. 
They also serve beer and wine which I thought was pricy, $7.99 for white and $8.99 for red, I am sorry but that's a bit much for fast food wine. 

We tried their featured marshmallow chocolate chip shake ($5.29) which was awesome but it has a whopping 1000+ calories!!! I am thankful when restaurants mention calories on the menu, what an eye opener!

1598466,2016-02-06,2,jBh399TajGcH28Zo2J1pHw,"I had a single hamburger, fries, and a cold milk. Although I ordered a vanilla shake, technically. 

Overpriced. Overpriced. Overpriced. Insane. The burgers themselves are pretty good, to be sure, but I can get one just as good in  the time for  1/2 the price at In-n-Out. At these prices, this place brings nothing to the table. 

The fries were not great. I left half of them uneaten; a real rarity for me. The wall says they're hand cut and fresh, but maybe that is just what's written on the freezer bag they came out of. They sure don't taste fresh if they are, and when I say fresh I mean when I drive through at In-N-Out I can see a kid reevaluating his short life's choices while he runs whole russets through that chopper. That's fresh.

I called my shake a cold milk at the beginning. To be totally fair, there was obviously some ice cream in it, but this is one of the least appealing milk shakes I've ever had. Here's the test: suck it through a straw. If you feel like your eyeballs are going to get pulled inside your head, it's too thick. If you let the straw go and the milkshake that is left behind immediately runs back down into the cup, it's too runny. Not only did this milkshake run like the wind back out of the straw, it was just bleh for flavor. A true disappointment. 

I say all of this with a heavy heart. I had my first Shake Shack burger at Bite of Las Vegas, 94.1 FM's yearly music and food festival. The burger was great! And so was the burger I had in-house on this visit. I thought I was getting price-raped at Bite of Las Vegas because I was at a food festival with $12 Miller Lights. Turns out I was getting price-raped because that's the business model here. And between that and the fries, and the shake, being so lackluster I don't care how good the burgers are. I'm not going to pay for them.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,9,2,1,3rG9O_NwP50MKwXSScsqCw

I was buzzed only to walk up to the counter and hear an apology: ""oops, we didn't meant to, we will re buzz your pager."" I go sit down only to be buzzed again immediately. Okay... when I arrive at the counter for the second time two orders of fries are ready, but only one burger. (I ordered two burgers) ""sorry, we can buzz you again!"" No, really, this is annoying, I ask if they can bring the burger-yes. For our troubles they also brought a third drink. Awesome, but there is only two of us...   So, when I bit into my burger, the first one which was done, it was pink. Clearly not done. Of course they'll fix it they say!! And when it is returned to me it comes with a FOURTH drink!! You cannot make this stuff up! So, my second order, it was to go. Again with the premature buzzing. Maybe they just like a crowd around the counter?? Our food finally arrives and we head home-Green Valley. My son starts eating his burger....PINK!!! Not cooked completely!

And you definitely can't forget about the sweet stuff.  Although it's seasonal, there pumpkin pie concrete is my favorite, but I have tried the apple and also the s'mores concrete which are also great.  Their vanilla custard all on its own is deliciously silky goodness and they do offer concrete samples.

Stopped in for lunch yesterday. I had heard a lot of positive feedback about Shake Shack. I have been eagerly waiting to try them out. 
The restaurant is very busy, for a great reason. The vibe is very cool, and they're great for large groups. I had the Smoke Stack (Bacon Cheeseburger), fries and a small drink. My wife had the Mushroom burger, fries, and a small drink. It cost us nearly $30.00 for lunch, which I felt was a bit high for a Fast Food experience. 
My burger was fantastic! The quality of the ingredients was top notch! Perfectly cooked burger and bacon. The mushroom on my wife's burger was a breaded, filled with cheese, rolled in breadcrumbs, and fried, portobello mushroom. Perfection! The French fries were perfectly cooked, golden and crunchy exterior, soft interior. Fries portion is very big. The small soft drink is smaller than any other place I've ever been to. This is fine, because they offer free refills. The problem with the refill, is every time you want one, an attendant has to get it for you. I had to get 5 refills. Each time, they give you a new cup. They fill that tiny cup with so much ice, you get maybe 5 to 8 sips. Just with me, six cups were used. I complained, thinking it's a total waste, and very unfriendly for the Environment. I was told it's Company policy. 
Every employee I encountered had great Customer Service Skills, fast, efficient and very friendly. 
Had it not been for the soda situation, and price. They would have definitely gotten 5 stars out of me. I might go back, if they ever change either cup sizes, or the waste of paper products.

Not much else to say about this place, other than when you book an airbnb in Summerlin, it definitely beats the 1+ hour wait time at other locations.",IHalLPBURlCw6mdtmY4VgA,3,2,5,KV0YT2Qf79kSHfCNW036xA

This gourmet take on classic fast food serves tasty treats in bite size. Even as a female that eats less than most, many times I am still hungry after eating a Shake shack burger and fries. You may want to order two burgers preemptively. Don't get me wrong, I still love the place. The ingredients, customer service, and community service is of the highest quality which are all important to me. 

As a vegetarian the only option is the 'shroom burger and fries. It's great. I come here for it often.  

We've been to many Shake Shacks around the country and this is the only location where you can get your food in less than 10 min from walking in!  Here's a no-line-Shake-shack!",WBmDeZG_dGUwhG1DtotLcw,1,1,5,RkRFC20Jfrr3GxbFVtM7-Q

I've been hearing about Shake Shack for months now and finally decided to try it. OMG! Why did I wait so long to try them??? I love simple burgers. I'm not into all the fancy bells and whistles other places add to their burgers to compensate for the lack of flavor from the beef itself. SS keeps it simple, and boy oh boy is their beef tasty. Thin patties, crispy edges, juicy, and full of flavor. Very simple ingredients, and very fresh. Such a flavorful burger! And the way they stack the ingredients looks like a work of art, you almost feel guilty for eating it. There is one thing that stood above their burgers though, their customer service. I'm not sure if she was the manager or owner or both, but ma'am I applaud your customer service. Truly an amazing burger and experience.

I'd say it's like in n out and five guys got together and had a hipster baby that likes cheese wiz and dogs. I found it delicious but greasy. Hubs is not a fan due to the amount of grease. The burger is small and you could prob get away with eating two burgers.... fries came out crunchy and hot. The sodas are behind the counter and you must ask for refills. We're in vegas and spoiled and not used to places like that. The shack burger was good cause of the cheese plus cheese sauce, no mayo or ketchup comes on it, but you don't really need it. Did not have the shakes or dogs. But I will have to come back with my kiddies without hubs. I really enjoyed one of the employees. I should of got his name, but he is REALLY tall and slim, white guy. He went far above and beyond what I expect of a fast food place. He asked if I needed help with getting condiments since I was holding a baby and pushing a stroller.

It's really hard to get my husband to try new food, so when I suggested this place he was all for it because how can you screw up a burger and fries? Well you obviously can. The cashier that took our order was Shawtrice she was unhelpful, and seemed annoyed that she was even there. I ordered their featured  burger that was ""roadside burger"" and fries and my husband ordered the regular ""shack burger"" with an add on of bacon and fries with a soda. Mind you the soda comes in 2 sizes small and large and the small is a 12oz cup but you get free refills. But getting up and down to ask for a refill is a little annoying and they give you a new cup each time. Which for sanitary reasons I can appreciate but I feel like just give us the big cups and you wouldn't go through so much paper. Anyway, the food. The actual meat had no flavor. No salt, no seasoning, no anything. The only thing I could taste on my burger was the pickles. The fries were mediocre as hell. Just frozen crinkle fries they deep fried. They don't have ranch to eat with your fries which is fine but annoying to me because I love ranch to dip my fries in. The interior is very modern and stays clean because they have employees roaming around picking up trash and trays. We spend $24 for 2 burgers, 2 fries and 1 drink, and the food left us feeling empty and 30 min later we were hungry again.

This Burger & Shake joint hails from New York, a well known spot where customers line up for a bite to eat regardless of how long it is.

The place is very dapper, hip, with a contemporary classic modern twist. It's simple, not too flashy, but most importantly clean.  Restrooms are pretty clean as well with a stainless steel appeal! ...And on the real...The place just recently opened up a couple weeks ago....so cleanliness should be expected...lets hope they keep it that way.  TV's surround the upper wall ceiling for a casual feel. Wife and sister in law and I came during an off time on a Sunday afternoon, around 3pm, so this place was not crowded at all, plenty of seating to choose from and the line was minimal. That being said the location does boast an outside seating area to match its indoor seating...weather permitting. However, expect this place to be packed during peak hours, lunch and dinner especially on weekends. The good news is that Downtown Summerlin hosts plenty of restaurants and eatery joints with more opening soon, so it does help spread foot traffic from all those hungry shoppers.

Menu choices do contain a variety, but not as much as far as burgers go. They do offer hot dogs and simple yet crinkle fries with shack cheese. Shakes & thick creamery delicacy serve up to those sweet tooth looking for something to go with the delicious meal. Regular drinks come on the smaller side, but they offer free refills, actually when you do refill the drink, they give you an entirely new cup! (How bout that?) 

Staff were friendly, helpful and did provide a better experience. Found the staff to be plenty and in full force. So with a crowd coming in, looks like they were prepared to battle it out. 

All in all, our overall experience was excellent. Everything from service to ambience to food was on par. Burgers were juicy and on point, maybe not the healthiest, but it sure does hit the spot. I do recommend checking the place out to blanket your pallets with a mouth watering juicy and flavorful burger. You won't be disappointed.",Wp11jaXd3nQGwxTVH5ZTyg,1,1,4,zYUs13JHMqvnlpq52hPt0A

I came for lunch. First impression was loving the whole look of the place from the minute walking to the restaurant. I love the outdoor patio area. Not only because it nice size, great place to people watch, chill, and hang out with friends enjoy the weather. The menu is pretty huge especially for my first time. The staff in the restaurant the whole time was simply awesome. The gentlemen taking my order explained everything well the whole concept of Shake Shack and gave me great recommendations. I ended up ordering the SmokeShack burger. I went double on the recommendation. Talk about mouth watering and tasty burger!!!! If your hungry not doubt would highly recommend going double. Single is decent size but I feel with the double the smoked bacon, cherry peppers, cheese, and sauce get the full burger experience! The burgers cooked perfect nice and juicy. Fresh. The fries was going cheese fries but the first time just wanted taste the fries. They were awesome. I enjoy the fact that the crinkle cut fries not your straight cut. It adds different texture and can only imagine put mound of cheese sauce on it settles nicely on top. The fries were nice and HOT. 

Not only burgers they offer even have a vegetarian style burger, chicken, and more. The shakes need come back try my next visit. Concretes just reading the descriptions sound tasty. The drinks talk about diversity. Burger joint with different daily fresh lemonades. I love it. Selection of beers on tap not just your bland mass market ones but quality micro choices. Wines. More and more. The diversity is pretty awesome and really something for anyone here at Shake Shack. 

The service was awesome. The gentleman taking my order mention earlier answered all my questions being first time great. Positive vibe, friendly, and next thing know talking about endurance sports. Even when I was sitting down couple different workers checked see how everything was going they had that same positive happy go vibe. One of them asked if needed refill on my soda. They have no fountain machine out front.

And aside from the shake, the food wasn't good at all. The hot dogs are tiny and taste about as good as grocery store microwavable dogs. The cheese fries were just a handful of crinkle cut fries, aka frozen, with some nacho cheese on top...expected more from a place with this much hype

If you come here, I'd only recommend getting a shake and not any of their food. It's not good at all and you'd just be wasting your money. Definitely overrated.

With that, I find Shake Shack pretty darn delicious. I think they are overpriced - but this doesn't mean I won't pay the price. They are, as the three star review on yelp is appropriately titled, ""A-OK."" I'll go back with groups, but if I am looking for a delicious burger lunch or dinner I'll skip this joint for a double cheeseburger at In-N-Out everyday. I only had their oatmeal pie milkshake but it too wasn't spectacular. Good - not great. 

I think I am only so hard on this restaurant because everyone discusses it like the epitome of what a burger should be - um hardly. The SmokeShack burger is delicious but not worth ten dollars for a double. The cheese on their cheese fries is nacho style which is good for a few fries but ends up making you want regular fries by the end of it. 

I will say this burger blows Red Robin out of the water for the same price. But at least at Red Robin you get some atmosphere and a waiter/waitress.

Although on the strip they had a shake shack next to the hotel I was staying at, we decided to come here since my friend had to work around the area. This shake shack is located on the outside of a mall. 

My friend and I shared a Shake Stack Burger, double down fries (which was big as my head or bigger), I got a single concrete and he got a shake.

I ordered the hamburger with all the fixins (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles and ShackSauce.) Also got a side of their regular fries. Super tempted to get the cheese fries but I need to watch my waistline. 

Am I the only one who thought the burger was on the smaller size? It's not as small White Castle (then again, those are more like sliders) and it's not the size of an In n Out burger. Just thought it was.....kind of....an awkward size? It even reminded me of elementary school lunches. Like I could've gone for another burger if I really wanted to.

I still got my burger fix without walking outta there feeling like a blob.

2716975,2015-12-16,3,jBh399TajGcH28Zo2J1pHw,"My first experience with Shake Shack was very shortly after this location in Downtown Summerlin opened in October 2015.  I've been back quite a few times since, and see no reason why I won't continue to frequent this place for its tasty burgers and desserts.

The restaurant has a clean, semi-urban feel with the cool addition of tables made from the wood of old bowling lanes.  It can be a touch noisy when the place is packed, but overall not bad.  When I've been at lunchtime, I've noticed this is a favorite place for the kids from one of the nearby middle/high school to gather and eat.  Kind of cool, given the relationship Shake Shack has with Communities In Schools.  More on that in a minute.  Most of the seating is inside, but when the weather permits, there's a decent amount of outdoor seating too.  You admire the gigantic menu on the wall when you walk in, order at the counter, take your number and find a seat.  Depending on how busy it is, they'll either call you up when your food is ready, or just might bring it to your table.

The burgers are all made from 100% hormone and antibiotic-free Angus beef, and there are vegetarian options on the menu too.  After trying the SmokeShack, the ShackBurger and the 'Shroom Burger (the vegetarian burger option), my solid favorite is the SmokeShack.  You can't go wrong with a bacon cheeseburger topped with chopped cherry peppers to add a mild zing.  Oh, be sure to get it as a double.  I've also tried the Shack-cago Dog.  While it's not thoroughly traditional, it's definitely a good variation on the Chicago style hotdog.  If you want a Chicago dog and can't find one prepared in the traditional way, this will definitely do.

Then there's dessert, which can be described in just three words:  frozen custard concretes!  If you're unfamiliar, a concrete is basically a shake that's too thick to drink through a straw.  Definitely try the totally addicting Summerlin S'mores.  To make a great place even better, this location is partnered with Communities In Schools (Nevada) and makes a small donation from the sale of every Summerlin S'mores, Red Velvet Rocks, and Crunch-stellation concrete.  So eat dessert and contribute to keeping kids in school!  (It makes the whole dessert thing guilt-free.) 

Parking: this location is in Downtown Summerlin, so there's no shortage of parking lots.  If you're pressed for time or don't want a long walk, be sure to park on the north end of the shopping center.  Now go eat!",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,4,4,4,oOT1rLTr-YNC7mDIj7SJxA

I've been a fan of Shake Shack since I had my first burger from them in 2013. My first Shake Shack was in London, England...not even in the USA! I haven't had Shake Shack since June 2014, so I  was very much looking forward to the Yelp Elite Event to check it out!

Try the classic cheeseburger, some cheese fries, and an IPA. You truly cannot go wrong with that combination. Some compare their fries to In-an-Out. I think Shake Shack wins hands down. I would take their fries every day. 

The frozen custard was the only thing that could've been improved on. I didn't think mine was the best in terms of presentation and taste. But, my prior experience with Shake Shack won't influence the rating on that!

There is tons of parking at Downtown Summerlin. You may have to walk a bit, but it is so worth it. They have a nice little patio as well!

My 5 year-old daughter even prefers Shake Shack over McDonald's (McDonald's has toys). We love the doublecheese burgers, fries, chocolate shake with malt and vanilla custard. Their potato buns are just the best.  Burger patties are juicy not oily.   Plus this location has the greatest customer service.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  They come around to greet customers at the tables. And most often they offer to bring the food to you even though this is a fast food, get-it-yourself restaurant.

I went during their opening week and was glad that the line wasn't our the door long. Our wait time was expected after ordering (not too long though), but it did seem like a few other folks were wondering where their food orders were. Both the burgers we got were solid and the bun finally tastes like how I remember the bun tasting in their east coast locations (something about the NYNY location was a bit off). I know people complain about the higher price tag, but I'm officially a convert... no more In-n-Out for me. I'd rather pay up the extra money and go out of my way for my fast food needs. There are also a few TVs in this location, that were a lot easier to view than the NYNY location. When we were done with our food, a nice, very tall, young man proactively offered to put our tray away, which I appreciated. Some of the things I noticed:

Customers - geez,  clean up after yourselves a bit citizens of Summerlin! The workers do a great job bussing tables, but it kind of sucks seeing people really not give AF. 

Entrance - Not very wheelchair or stroller-friendly, and very tight. Summerlin parents, keep the lanes clear when ordering! (again, another complaint about the customers, but I think the business could do a bit more to ease the situation). The space itself is not as expansive as the NYNY location, and their is some but not a ton of outside seating, so you do feel a bit cramped when they are really busy. 

Restocking - the whole time while we were waiting for the food and eating, this employee took forever restocking the straws/napkins/condiments area and was in a ton of people's way. She definitely could have picked up the pace and finished doing that in 5 minutes or less. Get in, get out, and check on it again in 30 minutes.

I have visited the location on the strip several times expecting that the service and quality of food would be just as good. That wasn't the case this past weekend. Now I really wasn't in the mood for a burger per say and I was open to trying out something new. My friend and I both decided on the chicken shacks! One of them original and the other just the traditional style. They were offering a new style of bbq bacon fries that sparked some taste bud interest so we went ahead and through a side of those on! Roughly $20 bucks later we were given our buzzer and found a nice spot to sit out on the patio. The timing was perfect and once the buzzer wrong we proceeded to get the food. Now. I know that you can't predict which size chicken patty is going to come out of the bag before you drop it into the fryer however I would like that there would be some sort of consistency on the size of the chicken breast that is ordered. My biggest issue with this situation wasn't just the size of the patty but it was the fact that they chicken was over cooked. I really couldn't understand how an order that consisted of two chicken sandwhiches one was cooked correct and the other was over cooked. My friend brought this to the attention of the person working and really didn't get a very caring response.. more so along the lines of a pretty nonchalant well that's just how it's mad kind of thing. Yikes! If that's how you treat the customers who come and spend good money on fast food then I can easily go to KFC or hell even McDonalds and order a chicken sandwhich..

They even have dog treats for sale as well which is freaken cute!

SMOKE SHACK BURGER $6.69 - the SAUCE is freaken awesome & it has a slight kick of spice which I LOVE since I'm not good w/ burgers... but that spice makes it all good.

CHEESE FRIES $3.95 - crinkle fries cooked to perfection & drizzled w/ cheese sauce

I came with my family and we all either ordered the shack burger or the chick'n shack. As I wanted to fairly compare with in-n-out, I just got their regular shack burger. It was a good burger, but felt really not worth it. When it came out my burger felt small, and was kind of expensive, for what it was. My brother described the taste as ""something that you can make at home""-- which can be good or bad. It was a solid burger, but not filling because it was on the small side. 

What I really enjoyed was the chick'n shack. My mom thought it was dry, but I personally really liked it. It was the perfect amount of crispy.

I probably would not come back to a shake shack, if I have other options. Its overpriced for what you get. The food is not bad, but not life changing either.",Wlwkq4Si3h0YPd21lAfwbQ,0,1,3,XG3-oFRcB_VYttCq2YXblg

I brought it to the staff members attention that we are frequent customers and we ""get it"" but it's cold outside and it was never a problem during the prior 6 visits.  I added it's really nice you have a dog menu but if feels like a ""colored drinking fountain mentality"" when a business wants your dog money ...but then ya gotta eat outside when it's cold ... regardless I decided to call and express my displeasure to the manager and I spoke and was met by silence.

By the way gals and guys, their SmokeHouse is a burger, but they'll let you replace the burger with the crispy chicken.  I promise to try the burger at some point.  Those pictures!  Some appetizing stuff!

Just yesterday I had the crispy chicken again as a smokehouse.  I cannot get enough of the flavor!  They dice up those spicy red bell peppers and the sauce they use goes so well with everything.

Mmmm and their Portobello Burger nomzzzz!  There's no meat, by the way.  It is fried crispy - so it's pretending to be healthy vegetarian.  Don't over think it.  Vegetarians can have extra fun eating this meal.  It's ooookaaaay :)

My first experience with Shake Shack was at the location on the strip and it was underwhelming to say the least. I had ordered the double burger the first time around and could not fathom how anyone could enjoy paying $10+ for such a mediocre burger. 

This time around I ordered the Shack Stack Burger and I was once again disappointed. The burger came out to almost $10 and I was still fairly hungry when I left. The  ""shroom"" that they put in the burger looked like it would add a substantial amount of mass to the burger, but the moment you bit into it, it flattened and became almost non existent. Not only that, I couldn't even taste the mushroom. 

After trying two different locations of Shake Shack, I cannot justify coming here anymore. You pay high prices for mediocre burgers, that don't do much to satisfy your hunger.

Honestly, gather together a few extra dollars and go check out Bachi Burger. It is MILES ahead of shake shack for slightly more money. You'll thank me later.",swqSj4zuamI_HFfPTj63Hg,1,0,2,ZELyuZNYvu0ED1NAOlgEqg

My boyfriend was so pissed about me getting sick that he started researching Shake Shack and found quite a few disturbing articles related to food poisoning, including this one:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/3147046-could-this-be-shake-shacks-worst-nightmare

The article explains that Shack cooks their burgers to medium versus well done, which greatly increases the risk of spreading food-borne illnesses to consumers. I'm not saying that Shack doesn't obey all laws and regulations, but I do believe this is why myself and so many others are getting sick, and it's something people should know before deciding to eat there.",w1hvQ8taOfV-EpvdxjjH5A,11,1,2,aZIYaPuqOlGq4K1vjT0ptA

For drinks, my husband got a rootbeer and a chocolate frozen custard shake. We're silly sometimes, so I took a big slurp of the shake and while my mouth was still full, backed it up with rootbeer. Yes, it was good. But, I recommend probably just going with the Float option.

The little bit of heat from the chopped cherry peppers is an amazing complement to the smoked bacon and ShackSauce. The Shack Stack with its beef patty and fried portobello is tasty too, but at $9.59 for a single, it borders on pricey for a fast food spot. With all their burgers the buns are too squishy for my tastes (I prefer them toasted and firmer) and the beef patties lack the sear and crust of better burgers around town. The best thing going for Shake Shack are the concretes. In particular, the Red Velvet Rocks with vanilla custard and chunks of red velvet cheesecake is a reason to come back over and over.

The wait to order and get my food wasn't terrible considering they were supposedly making it fresh and they were busy. They have seating inside as well seating outside seating on the patio which is dog friendly. 

Chick'n Shack ($6.59) -  Crispy chicken, lettuce, pickles and buttermilk-herb mayo. My sandwich had both leaf and shredded lettuce, odd. I have to say that I really enjoyed the taste of this much better than the one I had at the other location. I did ask for extra mayo this time and it made a huge difference. I ate every bite and can only hope that if I do stop by for one of these again in the future that it will taste just as good.

Hot Dog ($3.39) - Advertised as flat-top dogs, these hot dogs are sliced down the middle and cooked on you guessed it, a flat-top grill. I added Shack Cheese Sauce for $.50 cents more and that still didn't cover up the not so great taste of this dog. One side was charred way too long and the other was just right. The potato bun was tasty, but this hot dog was just lacking many things. 

Shakes ($5.29-$5.79) - They have soda, water, beer and wine, however we chose to support No Kid Hungry and purchased $2 shake coupons and had shakes with our meal. I was excited to try the Coffee Fair Shake, but it was a real disappointment. The coffee shake tasted like a Jamocha shake from Arby's, but with less flavor. My hubby ended up getting the Peanut Butter shake and it tasted very good! I bought a few of the $2 shake coupons, so I decided to go back and get a peanut butter shake and was so glad I did. 

The fries here are just average in my opinion. I honestly prefer Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken located right across from this Shake Shack because I get a better portion for my money. The burgers here at Shake Shack are too damn small. A double shack burger will set you back $8.19 before tax, drink or fries and let me mention that's for a burger with just lettuce, tomato and sauce. I can get a double double at In N Out Burger for $3.45 before tax, so I just don't get what's going on here at Shake Shack. If someone wanted to come here I'd join them and most definitely I'd go with the chick'n shack, but can't see coming back on my own. One cool thing is there's an outdoor patio with tables/seating and it's dog friendly.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,70,63,3,DEOJ_2VspX_MTYptyn-JEw

We were fortunate to have attended the Elite event where it was my first time experiencing Shake Shack. We were planning to try three different burgers, but due to our location in the back of the patio, the very talked about Smoke Shack never made it to us.This was also the first Elite event where we saw DOGGIE BAGS!?!? Yup, Elites went there..classy huh? So a return visit was planned to try the Smoke Shack.

A couple weeks later, we returned already knowing what we wanted, I got a Smoke Shack and also tried a Chicken Dog, Chicago Style. Wifey liked the flavor and simplicity of the Shack Burger, so along with some fries, we were set.......until I saw a sign advertising a PUMPKIN PIE CONCRETE, so that was added for dessert and put on hold until we finished our meal.

Service is always friendly, quick, and efficient here, and although there may be a line at times, the wait times for your order don't seem long at all. As the burgers go, they are quite tasty. Shake Shack burgers have that flavor that will definitely keep people coming back. The frozen custard here is dense, rich, and smooth and a perfect end to your meal. Flavors change weekly, and the concretes are exclusive to this location only. Prices here may be a deal breaker for some, as well as portion sizes, but the Smoke Shack and concretes will definitely keep me coming back. ALOHA!!!

Shake shack is very mediocre and pricey for what it is. My burger was a thin over cooked patty sloppily put together. The fries were ok (crispy crinkle cuts) but the cheese sauce was pretty flavorless and gloppy.

Chicken sandwich ( a rather new addition) was better than the burger. The crunchy breast was crispy and tender.

Shakes , which are made with frozen custard, are okay. Plenty of flavors and monthly specials but they are not amazing at all.

One of the crew members, I believe Mark was his name, came over and asked if we had any ?s. My mother said she had a question about the mushroom burger. Mark answered and then went out of his way to ask if we wanted him to take our order at the table instead of us having to walk up and stand in line( I guess he noticed we all had health issues). It blew my mind. He took our order and brought it to our table like a full service restaurant. The food itself was good, but nothing super special. Would definitely go back for the food. I just felt like I needed to write a good review for the service because it seems like in Vegas, it's very hard to find someone willing to go the extra step to satisfy someone.

Since we were served at the Yelp event, I didn't know the routine of entering the right doors, placing your order, getting your buzzer, and then waiting for the food to be ready.  A gentleman leaving told me to go in the other door and order there.

After looking at the menu for a short time, I got two SmokeShack burgers--cheeseburgers with bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and ShackSauce. I ordered two fries with cheese.   I also ordered two regular iced teas.  I then took the buzzer, took my seat, and waited for for the buzzer to go off.  There was no drink until you picked up the order which is a minus for me.  I could have gotten some ice water but why no drink while you sit there?

In a reasonable amount of time, the buzzer went off and I collected dinner for the two of us from the pick up area.  The burgers were OK.  The bacon was good as was the tang from the cherry peppers but I got no flavor from the ShackSauce at all.  It was a colossal mistake to get the cheese fries.  That was partially my fault.  I should never order fries with any topping.  The cheese on these fries was overwhelming and it made the somewhat soggy fries even more so.  Naked fries as the best fries in my book.  Before we were finished, the fries were a soggy heap that would have made good food fight material.

We decided we'd try a concrete for dessert.  My wife wanted the Red Velvet and I got the S'mores.  After ordering, the counter critter told me their regular blender wasn't working and that the concrete would have the normal mix ins on top.  Really, one of your claims to fame is your concrete and you have one blender.  That's like saying our regular grill is broken.  Is a frozen patty OK?  They weren't concretes and even if the accoutrements had been mixed in, I don't see how this frozen custard could ever be called ""concrete.""

In summation, it was worth a try.  There are so many better options where you can get your own drinks and refills.  And, you don't have to go through the ordering line all over again.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,17,8,2,MEJOz5rR2qhyIAVF8hfThg

Our shakes were very good, I cannot believe that I have waited this long to try them. I had the twins with me so the two flavors we had were chocolate and twist. The twist is a mix of vanilla and chocolate which could of been more impressive with added extra chocolate, but that was it. The chocolate was very rich and creamy.

A lot of people like to compare Shake Shack to In-N-Out.  They are not the same thing.  Plus, it wouldn't be fair to Shake Shack to compare them to an In-N-Out.  Overall, I don't think Shake Shack's baby burgers are bad at all.  I have a lot more pros than cons.  

Pros:
-Conveniently located in Downtown Summerlin
-Parking is great.  You have the whole mall to find parking. 
-The weather is nice in Summerlin. 
-Located close to Red Rock
-Their burgers are so cute and tiny.  
-Shake Shack's Double Shack is one of the better sliders I've had in a long time. 
-Lower in calorie because you don't get much
-Their burgers won't ruin dinner.  You'll be ready to eat again about 30 minutes. 
-Takes about 2 minutes to finish a burger here.  This means people are in and out.  A lot of seating. 
-Love the crinkle fries
-Two burgers, fries, and a drinks is less than $100.  More like $40.  

Cons:
-You have to wait for your meal in order to get your drinks. 
-Takes a while for this ""fast food"" joint to cook your food. 
-Their Double Shack, at over $8, is a really expensive slider.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,8,7,3,E4bC9A_oOlGhq_Hil0XVIQ

The crinkle cut fries are my favorite type of fry and all of our fries were crispy.  The how dogs are Vienna brand and always delicious.  The shakes were awesome.  The only complaint I could give is the size of the burgers were in the small side and pricey.

My husband wanted to check this place out so here we are again. Final verdict: 

The food is pretty good but the prices are a bit high. $5.99 for a small hamburger $2 extra for an extra patty and the drink size for a regular is more of a small which they fill with ice (not a fan of the waisted space technique). I love the butter bun they serve with their hamburgers! Crinkle fries are nicely salted and soft. The shake I had (strawberry malt) was just okay. The chicken dog is not impressive, bun and dog. We ordered two single patty hamburgers, 2 drinks and a chicken dog for about $25... Yikes. These prices will keep us from coming back which is a shame. 

The tables are recycled wood which is awesome! I suggest having a refillable soda area accessible to customers and lowering their price points with added drink sizes.",XdLQep9R3V7EHwW2fjgK-g,3,3,3,YBCOWe2bHVxNfbCh-i2aTA

I hadn't heard too much about Shake Shack except that it was the east coast's answer to In N Out so I was pretty excited to try it.  Walking in to Shake Shack the restaurant itself was clean and open, decorated with wooden walls, tables, and chairs.  To get your food you just walk up to the counter to order and then they bring out the food to your table.  Service was fast, friendly, and efficient.  Unfortunately the decor and service were the only things I liked about Shake Shack.  
 
The prices here are pretty steep for a burger joint because the entire menu is a la carte and doesn't include any meal options.  Between my parents and me, we ordered 3 burgers, 1 soda, 2 orders of fries, and 1 of their red velvet concrete desserts all for about $40, which is pretty expensive to me seeing that usually at other nice burger joints the three of us could eat for about $25-$30.  The fries were crinkle cut style, we thought they there were just okay.  All of us thought that the burgers we ordered were a bit more on the dry side and forgettable.

I've only been to two other Shake Shacks other than this one (one of which is the one in New York New York on the Strip).  Today, I ordered a burger with fries (no cheese) and the vanilla concrete.  The burger, although very good and fresh, seemed to have a soggier bun than the buns that I had at my previous visits to Shake Shack.  Otherwise, the burger was pretty delicious.  I have no idea what that Shake Sauce is, but it is pretty darn good.  The patty was well seasoned and very fresh. 

Unfortunately, the fries are nothing to write home about.  They are crispy and tasty, don't get me wrong, but  they are nothing notable.  They taste pretty similar to freezer fries.  The vanilla concrete didn't taste much different from any regular blizzard/freeze/McFlurry like concoction.  A single is pretty small and might not be worth the $3.50.

For fast food, Shake Shack is pretty expensive.  But the burgers are so good and fresh that I always come back!  The service here is very fast and friendly as well.

The fries is pretty good alone but you need to get the cheese sauce to dip it in. It's probably not the healthiest, but I like any type of melty cheese that you can dip into.

The meat (100% angus, hormone & antibiotic free) is the main event here. It is tender, juicy, and it's responsibly-sourced (A + in my book, as I am becoming aware of real foods and nutrition as a whole, so I am trying to eat better, but it's a process...).

We've been here a few times, and the average cost for us (family of three) to enjoy a yummy lunch is about $25 (hubby says it's pricey, but I don't mind it when it's this delicious; this is quality over quantity). Our most recent lunch this past saturday, was three burgers (all different types), one order of fries, and one drink. I had to pace myself and not rush into eating my burger (savor, MMM). It was perfect. The shake shack sauce was a standout too. The non-GMO buns are soft, pillowy. Usually our son gets the all-beef hotdog, but he wanted a crabby-patty (Sponge Bob speak). He finished it, but first he was grubbing on the fries. (I don't usually like crinkle fries because they tend to be soggy and oil-soaked, but not these ones, which were crispy.) He is a carnivore (always wants more meat), though, and he finished his burger, bun and all. It is a good thing when we can get our picky son to eat something and finish it without saying ""I'll finish it tomorrow"" or ""Let's bring it home.""  

The lunch rush equals busy parking lots nearby, so we had to stalk someone leaving, and we got lucky. The line to order was very long (almost to the front door), but it went fast (you order and pay at the front). All the outside seating on a beautiful sunny day was taken! Inside was a different story, surprisingly, many tables were free. Like all venues in LV when it gets warm outside, inside temps are very cool. The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and while there isn't table service, they clear your table and check in with you and your meal, on the taste of your food. The bathrooms are clean.

They said it was busting with flavor and the best burger they've ever had. My husband practically inhaled his Cheese fries, so they must have been good.

If we're ever back in the area we will definitely come back, because it was great. Thank you Toshonna for being so awesome.",aVChxyqlwt1xd1C_lJv-og,1,0,5,ldjFrs4nVhcJGM0TtnphQg

We've never tried Shake Shack so when I found out they a place in Downtown Summerlin I told my husband we should have lunch there.

I've seen many YouTube videos of Shake Shack and how people said this place was awesome, so expectations were really high.

I don't know if we expected too much but I have to say we were disappointed.

The burgers were okay.  The cheese fries were okay.  The lemonade was okay too.

Needless to say, for our $25.11 it was really disappointing.

My husband still prefers the burgers from In-N-Out and I have to say that Hot Dog On A Stick makes a better lemonade.

This place did not make our list for places that we want to come back to.

Food is great! The 'Shroom burger is their vegetarian option with a crispy and juicy portobello patty. The vegetables taste fresh, and there's gooey, melty cheese that oozes out as you take bites from your palm-sized burger. Some may find it's size relatively small, but I think it's a healthy portion.

A burger, a side of fries, and a milkshake is a good combination that will satisfy the average sized person! If the portion were any bigger, I would feel unhealthily full! (Psst! You know exactly what I'm talking about! It's that, ""I just got hit by a truck"" feeling after gorging on junk food!) And side note, I love cheese, but I definitely prefer the fries without it. If this review were based on food alone, I'd give it a solid 5 stars!

Now, why is it a 4 and not a 5? Well, I was put off by the customer service, which is indeed essential for a prime dining experience. The place just opened, and I understand they need to work out some kinks, but I didn't enjoy the atmosphere of the place either. The walls do not absorb enough sound, so the noise levels were a little high for my sensitive ears, and it pales in comparison to the more spacious Strip location. These are the reasons why it is a 4-star overall rating from me.

Also! I've noticed others mentioning the price... I expected that and accepted it, as I've been to Shake Shack before and understand that it needs to maintain the image of a more ""upscale"" fast casual restaurant (which also explains the trendy, industrial decor).

The era of fast food chains getting away with serving mediocre food cooked in greasy oil with impersonal service in a sterile environment designed to get you in and out is facing intense competition from the newer generation of fast food chains. This new generation of fast food chains is being led by Shake Shack, Five Guys, and Smash Burger. 

   After hiking in Calico Basin and the streets of Downtown Summerlin, my brother and I were up for a post-hike dinner in Shake Shack. I had been looking forward to biting into a Smokestack burger. In recent times, I had visited Shake Shack four times and  developed an appreciation for their Smokeshack burger. 

   Just like downtown Summerlin is the future of the regional shopping mall, Shake Shack is the future of the fast food restaurant. My experience describes dining in a futuristic fast food restaurant. After ordering from the menu on the wall (not over a counter), the friendly cashier presented me with a beeper. Instead of waiting by a counter for other people, or hearing order numbers go off, the gentle buzz of a beeper went off when the food was ready. The dining room is an environment that encouraged me to relax. This is totally disparate from a sundry of the fast food restaurants walled with plate glass windows overlooking the highway where the psychological message has been to eat up and get back on the road. In Shake Shack the interior feels more like a casual full service restaurant than a fast food restaurant. From my table I overlooked a couple of close caption HD TV sets playing football and ""Shriek."" If it was a warm day, I could of sat outside in the patio overlooking the beautiful arroyo park in downtown Summerlin. Whether I sat inside or outside, there was an employee offering to dump my garbage. And if I really wanted to relax, instead of a Coke with my crinkly fries, I could have enjoyed a draft beer. Biting into a Smokestack burger was more than enough to make me relax. 

    Shake Shack has been consistent with quality. In similar fashion to the past three visits the Smoke Shack burger elevated my taste buds. That 100% angus beef between two soft buns were the delicious prime ingredients that complimented Applewood bacon, red peppers, and that mysterious Shake Shack sauce. The crinkly cut fries were good but not Nathan's greatness. 

   It seems that Las Vegans including yours truly Daniel. S love Shake Shack. But Shake Shack is doing a Winco business strategy where they build a couple of restaurants that require  people to drive a distance to come to them. Currently the only other Las Vegas location is in New York - New York. 

  Speaking of New York - New York, I want to clarify a major Shake Shack misconception. There is a misconception that Shake Shack is the IN N Out Burger of New York and they are all over the New York metropolitan area. Not true at all. I grew up in New York and never heard of them. Throughout my young adulthood there was a few locations in the city. Only recently did they expand to the Suffolk County suburbs of New York. They are totally different from IN N Out. Shake Shack goes for around $12 where In N Out is about half the price. Shake Shack offers several different items where In N Out offers a few. From growing up in New York, I feel thar White Castle would be comparable to IN N Out.

  On the other hand what is the antithesis of a misconception is that Shake Shack is fantastic. With all the four star reviews including this one, it is foreseeable to walk into this futuristic fast food restaurant and set eyes on the ""People Love Us on Yelp""  sticker.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,12,4,NbJELh7JUDTy3ql30u29LQ

FOOD/PRICES:
You can choose from a variety of burgers (bacon, mushrooms, and cherry peppers), chicken sandwiches, hot dogs, crinkle fries, shakes made from custard, and beer and soft drinks. Prices range from $3-10 and because there are no combos, your bill may end up being pricier than expected. 

QUALITY:
The food is made to order and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. The strawberry shake was tasty and the chocolate shake was too chocolate-y. Not a fan of how thick the shakes were though. French fries were whatevs in my opinion. Hoping to try the cheese fries next time. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
The cashier was friendly and somewhat helpful with the menu. Nothing super great and nothing bad.

My favorite is the ShackBurger (cheeseburger). I enjoy it as a single or a double with the standard lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce. Plus, I like to add onion (raw) and pickles. Amazing. The SmokeShack is really great as well. My favorite part of their burger, besides the delicious 100% Angus beef patty and fixings, is the soft and chewy potato bun! (Potato bread is awesome!!) Hamburger buns usually drive me bonkers because so many of them are dry or disproportionate to the amount of meat, etc. Their burgers are perfect.

Crinkle-cut fries aren't the most amazing or exciting potatoes in the world, but they're still tasty. Plus, if you're feeling extra gluttonous and order them with cheese, it's so darn good.

I've had a couple of their concretes and they're good, but I'm not crazy about them. Their shakes are pretty tasty, too. I don't focus much on dessert since I'm all about the burgers and fries!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,6,6,4,7mcdbBRz03woUiOmVezWxQ

Now, you can't compare Shake Shack to In N Out or Five Guys. If you love a good cheeseburger, you know they all fall into their own category. And I'll leave it at that for those comparisons. 

If you're a first timer, you definitely have to get the shack stack. I don't go for that now - the deep fried cheese filled mushroom is something you must try but I'm definitely cool off of getting a smoke stack or a regular cheeseburger. Yeah - it can be a little pricey but their patties are always good and I've always received a consistent product at this location.  

The fries though - not a big fan. I am not a Kringle type of girl and the cheese sauce is not my cup of tea but I still think they're worth giving a shot if you've never been here but for like $4 - I could definitely live without it. 

Their shakes are also creamy and thick AF. Bomb - but use a spoon. I like that they have seasonal flavors but I can't finish one on my own. Still gotta get it if you're a first timer. Go big or go home, right? 

Not sure if there are soda refills since the machine is kept behind the counter. They do have a couple items for dogs and if you aren't into cheeseburgers, they have hot dogs and a chicken burger too. 

All in all - if you love cheeseburgers, you should definitely check this place out and I believe you can now online order if you wanna save some time.",RnTfhTi7VVEAMzlBXKvDsw,1,1,4,AFbG8bmc7J98lHBA9VzcQg

In any case, I knew that this would have to be a MUST try in Vegas. I ALMOST didn't get a taste of Shake Shack, but luckily enough for me, the Shake Shack on The Strip isn't the only one. 

My friend took me here on a Sunday night around 9PM and it was fairly busy. There were tables, but a good amount of people were there. I had overheard my friends talking the other day about a burger with mushrooms and how good it was...so I came in look for it. However, it was nowhere in sight...I was about to order the Shake Burger, when I noticed that there was a burger called the Stack Shake or something along those lines, which was the burger I was looking for. 

It was a big on the pricier side of burgers, but I told myself it was worth it, and luckily it was. This burger was absolute perfection. The mushroom is actually a patty that has melted cheese in it, stacked on top of the meat patty, which also has cheese, served with the shake shack sauce and lettuce and tomatoes. 

I took my first bite and cheese oozed EVERYWHERE, which is what I LOVE. I devoured my burger because of how tasty it was! Shake Shack is totally worth it if it's a once in a while thing, but I don't know if I can afford to come by every week for it. 

I feel like a traitor saying this, but Shake Shack is half a step above In-N-Out because of how amazing those fries are. I didn't order the fries at this location, but when I tried them at the one on The Strip, it was AHHHMAZING. 

I definitely need to try the shakes and cheese fries next time I come across a Shake Shack! This is a definite, must try when you're on the West Coast and in Vegas!!!!",DXuKlWTybbr3V55skkldUQ,2,0,4,JgJAySvS1ywTORtHj4jCWQ

I didn't detect any salt or pepper in the meat. The onions cannot be grilled. $6.99 for a bland burger? The fries are not salted either. I tried looking for signs of salt crystals but my beedy little eyes didn't detect any. The best part of the burger is the bun. Its like a soft Hawaiian bun. The patty was cooked to the right consistency and not over cooked. The apple pie shake was good and tasted like apple pie. Next time I'll stick with 5 Guys on the other side if I want a burger.

My husband, sons and the rest of the team had to order 2 burgers each which means it is very pricey.  Crinkle fries were good but get the cheese fries w/ bacon, so much better!  The chick n shack was also very good, crispy not greasy.  For me personally the shack stack was the best there.  Dessert wise shakes we're not bad but the red velvet concrete was amazing!!!

Over the years I did go several times to the NYC location and the last time I had it was at least 6-8 years ago. So at this visit, I ordered the cheese fries and they were great!  A good amount of cheese on it and the fries were nice and crispy. The chick'n shack was crispy, lots of pickles but the bread was a little too soft to my liking. The boyfriend ordered the shack-cago dog and the double shack burger. He liked both but he really preferred the cheese fries and he ordered another serving!

There was plenty of seating and no long lines at this location. Their facilities were clean and their employees were very friendly. There was a particular employee that was awesome because he asked if we wanted a refill for our drinks, we said yes and he delivered it to us. We didn't even ask. He was awesome!

I love DTS, parking was a bit rough but it's always like that. The place was clean and spacious and there was no one in line, so far so good.. I ordered the 'Shroom burger and the host at the register (Andrew) said ""are you sure you don't mean the Shack Stack""... mind you, it's my first time here so I'm unaware of what a Shack Stack is, but there IS an item on the menu called the 'Shroom Burger which is what I asked for, so I found it odd that he would question my selection. Moving on, I ordered the fries since very few places have crinkle cut and they're my fav. When I picked up my food first thing I noticed (and I'm not a big eater) was the size of the burger... I said to myself ""did I accidentally order a $6.99 slider?""... The burger was everything I expected and then some as far as taste, the melted cheese with every bite was nice (tho there were only like two bites). I just don't see how they justify the size of that baby burger, it was so off-putting... Have larger options  and charge more (like Smashburger), people will pay.  On to the fries... they looked amazing, I couldn't wait to dig in... when I did, right away I tasted subtle sweetness which I wasn't expecting and honestly didn't like. Also, they seemed like the store-bought frozen ones... Just straight nasty. People know what fresh tastes like....  Honestly, the fries ruined the meal, along with a pesky bully gnat that kept trying to have his way with my food and actually landed in my ketchup.  SMH. Bottom line is I'll never go back.

I had heard a lot about Shake Shack but was truly disappointed when I finally went there.

Yes! they are located in cool locations in town.  
Yes! their stores are modern and sleek. 
No! the food is not good.  
No! they are way over priced.

Their burgers a tiny tiny.  I'm a skinny Asian guy and thought that I needed at least 2 burgers for it to be considered a meal.  They use a heavy potato bun and a pretty boring piece of patty. Their burgers are also fairly expensive - it was $17 for 2 basic single burgers and one shake.  At that price, I can go to In-N-Out and get four burgers that are spectacular.

5013139,2015-10-07,2,jBh399TajGcH28Zo2J1pHw,"Really good burgers which must be compared to In N Out and Five Guys to give the right perspective.  I grew up in CA and instinctively am biased against Shake Shack in favor of In N Out so this review hurts a little.


Quality of Meat: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five Guys (from best to worst)
Shake Shack the easy winner here.  Juicy on the inside and cooked at high enough heat to get some charring on the outside.  A really solid patty you wouldn't have an issue with if you paid $15 at a steak house for(besides expecting a bigger patty).  Five Guys, to me, has the worst meat.  It's bland and cooked at lower heat so there's nothing happening on the outside.  In N Out has some charring but the patty is too thin and not juicy enough.

Quality of Bun: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five Guys
The Shake Shack bun is awesome. Soft and pliable.  It lets you bite down into your burger without all the toppings flying everywhere.  That's a problem Five Guys in particular has and to a lesser extent In N Out.  In N Out does toast the buns....I couldn't tell if Shake Shack did but definitely didn't taste the toast like you do at In N Out.  Still.....have to go with the Shake Shack bun.  If they sold that bun in any supermarket it's what I would buy to take to a bbq for burgers.

Quality of Toppings: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five Guys
In N Out has the best tomatoes, lettuce, and onions.  However, Shake Shack has bacon, superior grilled onions, and other toppings like peppers which give you much more variety.  Five Guys has the most options and they're free...but I've always found their toppings to be bland, poorly cooked, and just not good.  

Fries: Shake Shack - Five Guys - In N Out
Well seasoned crinkle cut fried over at Shake Shack.  NOT a good value by any means as you get an average portion at around $4.  That's insane pricing.  In N Out has pretty brutal fries IMO.  Five Guys gets silver on volume alone.  But fries are too big which means you have to put a ton of salt and/or ketchup.

Cost: Shake Shack - Five Guys - In N Out (meaning Shake Shack is the most expensive option)
Shake Shack is flat out expensive.  For a double cheeseburger they charge around $10 vs. $3.50 for In N Out and somewhere in between for Five Guys.  I don't know why anyone would eat at Five Guys with the prices they charge.  Five Guys does have an awesome soda machine at Downtown Summerlin.  If you're price sensitive, Shake Shack is gonna trigger you.

TLDR; Shake Shack has really good burgers and fries.  But it's very expensive for what is essentially a fast food experience.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,8,4,5,f40WuXsKExzrb6yoFFMHog

My boyfriend and I walked in and saw the massive menu and instantly got excited. Since we were hungry we decided to try a burger and the chicken shack after the gentlemen raved about how awesome and ""filling"" their burgers were. My boyfriend isn't a small guy and we both lift. The guy ringing us up could see how huge my boyfriend was but continued to convince we didn't need large fries with our burgers because we would be full. After we ordered and they called us when our food was ready, I watched my boyfriends face in serious disappointment when he was walking towards me with the food. I looked at the size of the burgers and thought this was a joke. The fries were basic crinkled fries you could buy frozen at the grocery store and while the burgers were good they were so tiny. My boyfriend took three bites and was done. His cheese fries were weak!... Same basic fries with some American cheese barely on them. We paid $26 bucks and still hungry. We paid $16 at smash burger and love every bit of it....for a better price. Sorry but I'll leave this place be.

5085195,2016-01-14,6,jBh399TajGcH28Zo2J1pHw,"My first trip to NYC was magical. It was foodie heaven. One of my most favorite meals was at Shake Shack in Madison Square Park. Now it's here in Vegas and off the strip! How awesome is that?!

Mushroom lovers, the shack stack is a must try! It is a breaded portobello mushroom with warm melted cheese in a cheeseburger. Warning: it's a lot of cheese, but in a good way of you really like cheese. Negatives: the priciest of all the burgers. Some people can't justify paying that much, but for me it was well worth it to relive that original Shake Shack experience. Plus it saves me a plane ticket. 

Vegetarians, the 'shroom burger is a great choice also. Basically, the same as mentioned above minus the beef patty. Love this option on my non-meat days. 

Do you like a little heat and a little sweet? Bacon? I think I have your attention now. I highly recommend the the SmokeShack, which has chopped cherry peppers and applewood smoked bacon. It's so tasty! Definitely, a man's burger. My husband gets this every time! Also, available as a double (patty). 

Truthfully, you might be disappointed with the ShackBurger. It was not bad at all, just not memorable. I would rather spend a little more for the ShackStack or the SmokeShack. 

The crinkle cut fries here are okay, but I recommend the cheese fries over plain fries. The cheese adds some extra oomph in the flavor department. 

What I love about Shake Shack is the quality ingredients. Although, burgers are on the small side it doesn't bother me. I'm full after one burger and sharing fries.  Pricy overall, but it's a nice splurge. Honestly, Shake Shack is not really comparable to other burger joints out there. 

With desserts and cold treats nearby, I usually skip the shakes and concretes. I've sampled some before and they were delicious and extremely smooth. Look out for limited edition flavors that rotate weekly / seasonal!

I play it safe when trying new places--this time a ShakeShack burger, regular fries and a shake. I asked the cashier which flavor shake she liked most and enthusiastically made conversation and recommended something I not only didn't notice, but totally loved: a Cookies and Cream shake. 

Three televisions all on different channels, perfect for kids, parents and adults of all ages. The staff was so friendly and eager to help from the moment we walked in. 

The burger was soft and not too greasy, and the shake though a little small packed one hell of a punch.

This is like any other fast food burger from a decent resto (in and out, tom boys, jonnyrockts etc).  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, i'm pretty sure it's a duck.  Gourmet just isn't served in a 10cent paper fry holder and paper wrapper.  The patty is thin, and the burger is tiny.   

If you wanted a REAL restaurant gourmet burger, I suggest yardhouse or fusion burger, where the burgers have restaurant style sized patties served with shoestring fries, ON a plate WITH waiter service.  And maybe order a side of french onion soup too. 

I can't taste the difference if the potatoes are actually from yukon (where is that anyways) and if you walked the cows home from the farm and you fed it organic strawberries it's whole life.  It tastes like burgers and fries, just like Dasani tastes like water.

Now as a point of reference, the one star is just for it claiming to be gourmet burger.  If it had claimed to be a normal burger joint, i'd rate it as a normal burger joint.",SyyYQfNQ4a4Lua5RBlggmQ,0,1,1,NhG1F_KnIehu1mdYe8Y8Tw

I've always held the belief that there is really only so much you can do with ground beef on a bun, and other than seasoning it a bit differently, it's really all about the same stuff. Shake Shack is absolute proof of that.

I went there with a buddy of mine for lunch and the place seemed kind of busy. I figured I'd try their normal bill of fare and go with a single bacon cheeseburger and a peanut butter shake. I had them throw on a cheese fries to my tab also, and got a little sticker shock when I saw the total was about 18 bucks. Seriously, for a burger, shake, and fries in a chain joint. Ugh, whatever.

The food showed up at our table about 5 minutes later and the burger looked like someone sat on it...at least 3 times. It looked about a thousand times worse than anything I've seen come in a paper wrapper in a drive through at any fast food joint. It looked terrible. I regret not getting a picture of this very disappointing burger. The fries were in a paper tray and it looked like they just took a slice of American cheese and melted it on top. It looked gross and unappetizing and didn't taste much better. The shake tasted good but it was VERY rich...it was like trying to suck a stick of butter through a straw. Once it melted down, it was OK but just too heavy.

If the price had been half of what I paid, I would probably give this place a bit better rating but overall, I have to say it was VERY disappointing eating here, especially considering the price.

Situated in Downtown Summerlin, a location in the dining alcove nearest Red Rock Resort and Casino adjacent Wolfgang Puck, Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken and Pub 702, Shake Shack takes up a significant footprint with indoor and patio seating, the entrance bringing diners face-to-face with a big board of options and the counter with room for queuing. 

Pure Meyer in its concept, the non-GMO Buns, antibiotic-free Meats and Organic Produce all showing a passion for quality while also commanding a premium price, ordering at Shake Shack is a streamlined process with weekly Specials augmenting a list of classics plus the recently launched Chicken Sandwich, the prices really no different from Panera or other ""quick casual"" concepts with a five part order totaling just a shade under $34.

Amused by the Calorie Counts, just in case the toll on one's wallet for what is essentially fast-food delivered tableside despite a flashing pager is not enough, it bears mention that Shake Shack has actually designed their food to be ""Instagram Friendly,"" and with each Sandwich presented as if birthed from the wrapper the visual appeal is undoubtedly compelling, though first bites of the ShackStack were far less-so as the melty Mushroom completely overwhelmed an underseasoned Meat patty that really added nothing to the flavor of the Cheese, Sauce and Fungus.

More impressed by the Chick'n Shack, a brined Breast fried golden with a pleasant spice profile that outperforms Chick-fil-a from Bun-to-Bun as Pickles, Herbs and Lettuce all mingle nicely with the Bird, the rest of the afternoon focused on Shake Shack's famous Concretes and Custards, the weekly Blueberry Sweet Corn a lackluster attempt to do something Jeni's has been doing for a decade with a taste not much different from Vanilla with a spoonful of sautéed fruit drizzled over it, while both the Summerlin S'more and Desert Crunch-stellation fared better largely as a result of the Mix-Ins as the texture of the Custard was far less creamy that either CJ's or Luv-It.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,2,2,uOWUmIQ7agO18NtF5Kc1Kw

I received my food quickly (with everything in it), and it was SO GOOD. I'm very happy with my second experience!

Also, I got a Poochini for my pup; it was so cute, and my pup loved it! It has custard, peanut butter, and a Shake Shack biscuit. 

I'm so bummed. I love Shake Shack a ton. BUT, the last time I went (this past Sunday), they forgot to put my bacon cheese fries in the bag (app order). Things happen, so okay. I decided to call because that's $5, and I wanted my fries. I left a message with the 'manager' (just an answering machine), and the prompt said they would call me within 24 hours. I never got a call. 

The food was great (what I got of it), but I'm really disappointed in their customer service on the manager's end. I'm not sure if I'll go back to this location, just because I'm irked the wrong way by the lack of call. Again, super bummed.

The shakes here are good and thick but for 5$ for such a small amount... that's a negative. I'd rather go to in and out for a similar concoction.

5362903,2016-02-10,2,jBh399TajGcH28Zo2J1pHw,"My friends in the East Coast always rave about how awesome this place is, and now I can too! For starters, Shake Shack is its own unique burger joint. Despite the constant comparisons to In-N-Out, I can say after trying it today that they are nothing alike. So let's put an end to this East Coast/West Coast rivalry nonsense. :)

Okay, back to the burgers. Whenever I order a burger, I usually look for an option with sautéed mushrooms if one is available. I saw they had a ""Shroom patty"" and just assumed I could order my Shackburger with mushrooms. The cashier, however, informed me that the mushrooms only came in the form of the ""Shroom patty"". Um, okay. I'll pass on the mushrooms.

Despite the initial confusion, I ended up really enjoying my burger. Subbing regular burger buns for soft, buttered potato buns is just genius! The meat patty was juicy, flavorful, and perfectly topped with melted cheese, fresh lettuce and tomatoes, and pickles. I really liked the pickles because they aren't the precut, dill chips most burger joints use. They are actual, freshly cut dill pickles! The fries are good as well, especially if you're a fan of the crinkle-cut.

I will, however, attest to the overly high prices. You can easily find yourself spending about $20 on two burgers and fries here. Hubby also commented on the rather small size of the burgers. He isn't a proponent of large portions either. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I'm in the Summerlin area, I will definitely make a Shake Shack stop.

P.S. Ask for a side of ShackSauce for your fries. You won't regret it!",oQ0m7zCcppNT-8jMbPC6DQ,1,1,4,7lPaFG5zP0HdE6EWLhPQnQ

I like the burgers here because the meat patty is not to thick and you can taste the veggies on the burger. I hate when all you can taste is hamburger. I wish that they just had grilled onions and it was not mixed with bacon. That would be amazing.

The cheese fries with peppers are the best. I normally have to share these but I am pretty sure I could eat the entire bowl myself. They are that good.

We got here on a weekday around 2p, so its after the lunch and the place was not crowded at all. You place your order they give you a buzzer and you wait at the table until it buzzes. 

 I knew I was getting the Shroom burger and a shake, that's all I had been wanting since knowing about this place. My daughter got the Shack burger which is their take on a cheeseburger with their special sauce.
I didn't know what kind of shake to get since they all looked good, and so I asked the cashier what he would recommend. He said salted caramel and that's all it took because I was leaning towards that flavor. It did not disappoint! Next time I will try the Marshmallow chocolate chip if its still available as its a limited time flavor. 

The Shroom burger came with a warning sticker that it was Hot. It didn't register to me why, because shouldn't all burgers be hot? well, when I took my first bite, I realize why. The cheese that comes oozing out of the middle! I almost burnt my lips off! hahaha! I'll never make that mistake again. Needless to say, I had to let it cool off with a little bit of shake. Once it got to a decent eating temperature I was quite pleased. I like how the portobello mushroom is lightly breaded and cooked crisp. The melted cheese is held in by the breading. 

I was a little surprised at the size of the burgers when they came out. To me, they weren't full sized burgers nor were they sliders. It was in between. Like the size of a whopper junior. It was perfect size for me and my daughter and we shared an order of fries which were also cooked to a nice crisp. there was not one soggy fry.

First thing I loved was how the customer service was spot on. Everyone was seriously SO friendly! They all kept holding the door for the guests, personally handing them the menus, and just making you feel like your first time experience there is a great one! 

Now on to the food, my BF and I ordered the ShackBurger and the SmokeShack. ShackBurger was superb; it was so juicy, cheesy, and delicious that I even considered getting a second one cause it was that good! The SmokeShack was good but the cherry peppers made it too sweet for my liking. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant was really nice! They have an outside patio where my BF and I enjoyed our meal since we had our puppy with us. One employee was even nice enough to give our pup a Shake Shack dog biscuit! He gobbled it right up. We thought it was so sweet for her to do that!

Food: I ordered the Roadside Shack and it's basically a cheeseburger with grilled onions and bacon bits but I also added lettuce and pickles. The very first thing I noticed was the superb quality of the meat--so fresh and flavorful just by itself. I love how all of the ingredients mixed very well together in unison and complimented each other. The burger was absolutely delicious. I also was able to try the Smoke Shack, which I actually liked better than the burger I ordered. At first I thought that the cherry peppers and bacon would overwhelm the flavor of the burger, but it was just so perfect.

Service: Everyone was very helpful and attentive. While we were still deciding on what to order, one of the workers (I think he may be the manager or some type of higher-up) gave us a sample of their Frankenstein (Shackenstein) dessert, which was delicious. Mark also gave us an amazing experience by talking to us while we were seated and cleaning after our trays (we went for seconds and dessert).

When we arrived, we were greeted by an employee who was energetic and excited about explaining the items on the menu. She helped us decide what to order. This was helpful and I decided to order the Shack burger with fries and a chocolate shake! My daughter had the chicken hotdog! I was like Really? They are known for their burgers, but she is slowly moving towards becoming a vegan so...I couldn't say a word.

As I was walking away to find a seat there was a lady stating she was so excited to try their food and hoping it was delicious and I chimed in ""so you can Yelp about it"" and her response was ""Yelping is for cowards"". Excuse me??!!?? I took the higher ground and chose to ignore her obvious stupidity. Ok, on with my review!

They give you a little beeper which lets you know when your food is ready to pick up. We chose to sit outside and it was a gorgeous evening! There is plenty of seating both inside and out but with our terrific fall weather why eat inside? Our food arrived and I have to say it was good not great! My burger was tasty and I liked the special sauce but I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. My bun was really flat and lifeless and although I love crinkle fries they had way too much salt. The chocolate shake was rich and heavy. It was also not blended all the way as lots of lumps. 

I understand that they just opened and probably have some training issues to work out. I am going to give them one more try after they have had a chance to be open for a while and work out some of the kinks and hopefully it will be better.

Since it's kind of empty, you have a lot of space to yourself. I do love the location of the restaurant though, because it's in Downtown Summerlin mall and the outdoor designs are so aesthetically pleasing. 

* There was this student discount that they having going until July, where it is but one get one free. I ordered the shackstack and my boyfriend got the smoke shack (or smoke stack, I forgot, whoops). These burgers ooze out flavor. It is so amazing but it also oozes out oil; like lots of it. My boyfriend thought that the meat was very tender and juicy, but the burger fell apart quite easily. Very hard to handle and keep clean.

Wife ordered the Shack Burger and she also chimed in saying that it wasn't great at all.

I had to reach for some pepper to season my burger. With the pepper added, it was somewhat better. However, I was going to put some ketchup in but decided against it. The burger doesn't even look like a burger. It looks like slivered meat. 

Another thing to note about this location was that the rubbish cans were overflowing. Nobody cared to empty trash or to take the trays back in. It wasn't even crowded.

My usual preference is no mayo in any of my sandwiches, but their buttermilk herb mayo was pretty good. Also, unlike the Hot Dog, the Chicken Dog here is awesome and packed with flavor. I have always been a fan of crinkle cut fries and usually order the cheese or the bacon cheese fries.

Although the food here is expensive, customer service is top notch! There is always an employee walking around the dining area, asking how the food is tasting, offering to get a drink refill for you and taking away trays and throwing the trash away. They also clean up the tables in a timely manner, which is great because at other fast food places, you sit down in the restaurant and find oil, crumbs and other trash on and near your table.

Since they have put the new chicken shack sandwich one the menu it is my go to item of choice. The chicken is so juicy and the breaking is crispy and flavorful. I've had other chicken sandwich places and this sandwich is heaven. 

When I get the burger I get the shack burger, the sauce makes it and I am not one for sauce on burgers but shake shack's sauce with the melted cheese just makes the burger.",vqe-wt1H-H6AksHY252-tA,1,0,5,MHen02CxeTRY8-4fkVuyDA

Got the Shakestack , fries and a red wine. Wonderful service. Great food.  They even checked to see if everything was going well during the meal.  I would go back to this location",mvA6vrAJCVc0Pqv3ZME8qQ,1,0,5,6S_-7XvYfpXKDmo6c_9xvA

I can see why this place is always busy! Hit it between lunch and dinner- relaxing atmosphere.",zBdfduwvbKUy8tnDLAM9Xg,3,2,4,02CxzbB9KVvdt6CzpXFtww

Walked in and there was no line. Loved the decor, this place has a cool ambiance. The menu was pretty extensive. Since it was my first time here I kept it simple and ordered the double shack cheeseburger, fries, and a strawberry shake. My bf got the double burger with bacon and red peppers, fries, and a chocolate malt. The cashier was very friendly and informative when it came to our questions. Our order was over $30...somewhat high for burger place. But I do like that they use hormone free meats...

Didn't take very long for our food to be ready, which was a plus. My burger was awesome. I got extra sides of the shack sauce to dip my fries in. Loved the crinkle fries, perfect mix of crispy outside and soft inside. Only downside was that I really wished they had ranch. I love ranch with my fries...but what can you do. My bf really enjoyed his burger and thought the peppers perfectly complimented the meal. 
My strawberry shake was delicious, I wish it was bigger! My bf wasn't too impressed by his chocolate malt. He thought mine was better. We are big Luv It fans so we're picky when it comes to custard shakes.  

Overall everything was good. The price was a huge turnoff, if I ate alone it would be almost $20. And I wasn't too happy about there not being any ranch. This is definitely a place worth trying.",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,1,2,4,8iXf8tKML7vAJJWcx8Q6Jw
5969286,2016-02-18,5,jBh399TajGcH28Zo2J1pHw,"I love this particular Shake Shack especially because it's the only one I've been to without having to stand in line for an excessive amount of time for a burger. But they're so famous I was willing to stand in line for an hour in New York City to try it and then again when one opened on the Vegas strip. Now, no line at Downtown Summerlin for the best burger in my humble opinion (yes even better than In n Out, Five Guys, Smash and FatBurger)...and you pay for that extra dose of gourmet but it's worth every meaty bite  And now they have a chicken sandwich that was so good it will now substitute Chick-fil-A for me until one opens in Vegas. And I'm obsessed with Chick-fil-A. But on second thought it's all the way in Henderson so I may just convert to Shake Shack chicken. The crew at this location were nice and didn't judge me when I had a beer for lunch, cause why not, I work in morning radio, noon is my happy hour.",1vMmzy_K5sdoK9P-mNFJXA,11,7,5,eBqg-V1gHAjIZ2BfWOQLyw
