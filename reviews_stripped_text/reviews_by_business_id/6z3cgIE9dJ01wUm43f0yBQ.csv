Everything was good except the general tso's. It was very pungent with the vinegar. Green beans were amazing and the pork buns were juicy. Dumplings were standard issue but good. Our cups had some type of sticky substance on the outside which was a bit off-putting. Food was decent.",UEY8l4Jc8wv6W4jAW5Y-iA,0,0,3,0DDDj9rNGEqbtSnScL_xBg

Not sure where should I start, my Friend took me here when its grand opening, it is a small place but the experience was really lovely. The server was excellent & very tasty food.

Dumpling is the traditional food of my home town, and what they served here is exactly like what I had back in Northern China. All these dumplings are handmade & fresh. (14 pieces per dish if I remember it correctly) I also enjoy their smoothies, not so sweet & they use fresh fruits. 

Prices are reasonable!!!
Definitely recommended!!!

My friends and I show up there with a party of 10 and asked if we could be seated together, so they told us that we could add  two extra chairs to a table meant for 8. The tables are small so that wasn't going to work out. We suggested to add an additional table to accommodate us and their response to us was ""We're going to be busy today, we can't do that."" What???
We were all hungry and didn't want to fuss so we sat at different tables. We ordered beef and chicken pho, bun bo hue, pot stickers, pork and shrimp chive dumplings, pork cabbage dumplings, ""pork steam bun""- really it was shanghai style dumplings, and chicken wings. Our dumplings came first and 30 mins later the noodle soups. By the time we received the noodle soups everyone that ordered the dumplings were already finished eating.

Our waitress was nice and pleasant. She took out order pretty quick and asked how we like to cook the chow fun ( type of vegetables and sauce).

1105149,2015-08-29,0,6z3cgIE9dJ01wUm43f0yBQ,"Fat Dumpling is really good! 

As this was one of the restaurants that looked really cool (as compared to others, in my opinion) in Chinatown, we decided to check it out for breakfast. 

Our breakfast was: pork/sauerkraut dumplings (14 pc.), roast pork fried rice, lemon crispy chicken, and wonton soup. 

The dumplings were extremely delicious, and in my opinion, the best part of the meal. The slight sourness of the sauerkraut went really well with the soy sauce that I dipped the dumplings in. I don't know, I just really really liked the dumplings.

As for the fried rice, it was good as well. It had that fire-cooking taste, which everyone enjoyed. As for the wonton soup, I thought the wontons were alright, but the soup was what was really good. It was light (pretty much only had some lettuce and cilantro) and did a really good job in washing down the meal. 

The lemon crispy chicken... I thought it was average. It's basically the chicken katsu you can get from L&L, but with some lemon sauce on top. 

The service was pretty good. We got our food relatively quickly, and because two of the dumplings popped (broke) during the cooking, we were given three more after they were made. (That is to say, we were given our twelve dumplings first, and then three more in about 10 minutes.) In addition, as my family is fairly traditional, we drink hot tea during every meal. After we poured out our initial cups, the waitress came by and automatically refilled it for us (upon noticing that we had poured it out). 

All in all, I thought the meal was pretty good and very reasonably-priced for what we got. I'd definitely come back again!",SR0JeLZ84MDkcd4y666GbQ,0,0,5,to_sU6Tz8HxdAgw50WcEpw

I've been here a few times and while it hasn't been consistent most of the time, this is the place where I would frequently visit for my boba needs.

It's a fairly new spot that's been open for a few months. I've gotten turned in this place by the recommendation of some yelper buddies. It's located on spring mountain next to lees sandwiches.

Popcorn chicken - a Taiwanese speciality, the one at fat dumpling is nice and crispy on the outside, and moist and juicy in the center with an interesting seasoning. They give you an OK amount for the price, but I think they should give more.

Smoothies - order the jumbo size. It's the best deal in town. It's the Big Gulp of bubble teas. All of the fruit they use are real. The tea also has good flavor as well. I've never found boba quality as high as Half & Half tea house in LA, but... It's good here. Sometimes a lil bit too soft, but better than a lot of places in Vegas. My total for a jumbo smoothie with boba was 5.14, not too sha-bay!

First off, they ran out of plates. What kind of place runs out of plates?! The waitress gave us little plastic dipping cups instead.... which doesn't help.. Secondly, I don't think they train the staff very well because when we asked for napkins, she gave us 3 pieces.. we had 4 people in our party.. I mean, give us a little more. No need to skimp on paper napkins... And third (which was the worst), they ran out of dumplings! We ordered pork & zucchini which came out right away however, she said they were still making the pork & cabbage. We thought it would be maybe a 15-20min wait... but we ended up sitting there for over an hour. If they were out, she could've told us at the very beginning so we could've chosen a different flavor or just skipped it totally. 
The four of us ended up cancelling the pork & cabbage ones since we had to leave. Very disappointing. Lucky for them, their dumplings reminded me of the ones my grandma use to make back at home. The skin is hand rolled and chewy just the way I like it. The dumpling is stuffed to the brim with porky goodness and the juices drip off the skin once you bite into it. Dip the dumpling into some vinegar and hot sauce and you have the perfect dumpling. We also ordered some of the apps such as the chicken wings (skip), popcorn chicken (good), and liang ban fen pi (noodles were too long, difficult to mix with the non-existent peanut sauce). Just stuff yourself with dumpling goodness.

They also have a massive smoothie/boba menu, chose not to partake.

While I loved being able to snag dumplings to go and found pricing fair, the giant 14-piece order got a little boring after half the order was gone. Would like the option to purchase by the half or mix and match. Overall, dumplings held up and were tasty, seemed to be mostly pork and chive with a slight shrimpy flavor.
Squid balls were underwhelming and bland, despite a sprinkle of seasoning- would have appreciated some sort of dipping sauce, but they're a good portion for the price. 
Ordered the lamb skewers as recommended here on Yelp, found it spicy and underwhelming with a dismal portion compared to the other things we enjoyed here.

Overall impression was underwhelming. They need to make some changes if they're going to stay open: at 8PM on a Friday night, I was the only customer. Lee's Sandwiches next door had more business- that's pretty sad.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,4,3,uetNNF1Wk9Gg1unkBx9kfw

Place is clean, typical Asian restaurant. Smoothies made with real fruit but I just wish it was more sweeter. Beef noodles soup was good and it flavor reminded me of Vietnamese beef stew. Fried rice was also good but the pork was a little hard like it was over cooked/burnt but the flavor of the rice was good. The leek/egg pancake was excellent since I rarely find any place that make them anymore and the price here was very cheap and reasonable.

Firstly, upon entering the restaurant we experienced a very unpleasant odor. You get used to it, but it is very worrisome for the future of this establishment. I'd recommend they figure out what's causing it and get it under control.

Secondly, get some control over your service. We experienced some very basic service issues. They were certainly friendly, but you need to give us some plates to eat our food on. They were alllll over the place. I couldn't even tell if the servers were assigned to any particular tables. Some basic training and management would easily take care of that.

But in the end the dumplings we had were pretty good. The little basket dumplings, although good, had no soup in them at all. We will go back to give them another try.

Since discovering this place a few months ago I've found myself coming here quite often and pretty much anytime I'm craving a boba drink or fruit smoothie. Their drinks are the best in town and for the price ($3.50-4.00 avg for medium) you really can't beat it in quality, especially because they use fresh fruit in their smoothies. I've never had a bad drink here and their consistency is what keeps me coming back. My favorite drinks here are their mango smoothie and taro milk tea. Don't forget to grab a stamp card to take advantage of their Buy 10 Get 1 Free offer, although you can only choose from the medium tea drinks when you redeem a free one. Medium is the recommended size because the large is pretty big unless you're drinking on an empty stomach or sharing.

I haven't actually eaten an actual meal here in a while but regularly get orders of their popcorn chicken, which is probably the best I've had in town for the $5.50 price point. It's always made fresh so it might take about 10 minutes to get it. I've also had their dumplings and green onion pancake and they were really good. I like the thick skin on the dumplings so they don't break as easily. 1 order of dumplings is 14 pieces, but they now also have a smaller order of 8 which is good so you can try other things on the menu as well. The green onion pancake is freshly fried, greasy and crispy and for only $2.50, it's a yummy good deal. They also sell pho now which is a little weird because the owners and staff are Chinese and the rest of their menu is Chinese/Taiwanese.

The only thing I wish they could do better is their service since they usually only have 1 server, who also doubles as the cashier and is usually 1 of 2 teenage looking guys who sometimes seem like they have no idea what they're doing. As long as the older lady makes your drink, you'll have one of consistent quality. There was only 1 time where 1 of the kids made my drink and I felt like it wasn't as good and I got less boba than usual.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,13,14,5,BB3EvcCdzZCjpDe6YpvANQ

Chicken & cabbage dumplings - D'lish, liked those a lot
Vegetarian buns - ok. kinda small and a bit bland - was expecting more seasonings
Takoyaki - my husband liked it. I wont eat octopus, lol
Lemon crispy chicken - soooo good! the lemon sauce was thick like honey and oh so flavorful!

My boyfriend and I are hard core boba heads and we just needed our fix tonight. Being that it's our first time here, we even went as far as buying 3 drinks total between the 2 of us. You really let us down! Weak flavor, mushy boba, whack customer service - all terrible. 

Here's the story: 
I ordered the lemon honey green tea with half boba. Man, I didn't expect it to come out with the whole lemon, seeds, bitter rind, pulp and all. The wide boba straw slurped up all of the seeds every time I would take a sip. I choked on a few. Then I decided I couldn't go through with it, it just didn't taste right, and brought the drink back to the counter.

The guy was not having it. He told us that the drink is not for us to taste, but for us to buy... Whaaa? Wait huh? Accent or no accent, those are some fighting words mister. He then said he would pick out the seeds for us. Ugh. No, the drink tastes weird mister. It's not good. At all. 

He said he would not exchange the drink out for something else. We had to stand at the counter for a while and firmly tell him that we would like to have the almond milk tea instead, that the the lemon seeds were horrible. After a few minutes of going back and forth he then tried to exchange it out for a small almond milk tea with no boba. Lol. This guy is a character. So stingy! 

In the end he gave in and we got the almond milk tea with boba - woohoo an even (embarrassing) exchange. 

To my dismay, the drink tasted like a lot of hatred went into it. My almond milk tea tasted like pure powdered thick milk. That's the flavor I got. Why you gotta hate to hard?

Not to mention the other 2 drinks we got: durian slush and red bean slush - were super watery! Icy slushy ice is what we ended up getting. 

To be fair: they were clean inside, had a huge menu (they even have a vietnamese menu!) the drinks were cheap, not a sugar bomb, and they are open late! 

Sorry fat dumpling. Your antics are too much for me to handle. I don't want to hate a hater, but you's terrible!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,21,15,1,DB4lsxBmW0cpP8rGe606xA

I felt a little worried coming in since they had a sign up at their door saying ""chef hiring,"" what a red flag!! 

We ate family style and shared the Green Onion Pancake ($2.95), Chicken & Cabbage Dumplings ($9.25/14 pieces), Pork & Cabbage Dumplings ($9.75/14 pieces) and Beef & Onion Dumplings ($9.75/14 pieces). We also got beverages. I don't recall what my friends ordered, but I ordered a medium Lemon Honey Green Tea ($3.50). 

The Lemon Honey Green Tea was by far the WORST DRINK I have ever tasted in the history of teas. Not only was it overly sweet, there was an overwhelming essence of bitter old lemon peels. Way to kill my taste buds!! 

The Green Onion Pancakes were not bad. They provided a nice crunchy texture change to all of the soft dumplings we ordered. It tasted just like the ones I buy in the frozen section from 99 ranch though, so nothing special. 

The Dumplings here were indeed fat... but not their filling. The wrapping on the dumpling was on the thick side and the filling was not that generous. I really did not like the Beef & Onion dumplings. If I had to pick between the Pork and the Chicken, I probably liked the Pork & Cabbage Dumplings just slightly better. 

It's always good to try new things and I had good company with me exploring this place, but I don't think I can be convinced to come back. The quality of the food just seemed like something the reheated.

What we ordered:  

Lamb, Pork, and Beef  Dumplings (one item).  Menu says it comes with 14 dumplings.  We got 17.  Awesome.    These came out nice and hot and they were large dumplings.    Inside each was the meat and also some tasty broth.  Reminds me of the soup dumplings I've had back in NYC.   So delicious, I would go back for more.

Fried chicken - Pretty much Chicken Karage with salt and pepper seasoning.  No problems here.

Two fruit smoothies with boba.  Average.

Green onion pancake and Chinese fried dumpling.     The chinese fried dumpling is like the green onion pancake's big BIG brother.  It's like the size of my hand.  Inside it was stuffed with lots of green onion and little shrimp.   A little bit on the oily side but it was good, nonetheless.

The green onion pancake itself I wasn't too much a fan of.  It's like eating just the skin of a dumpling with very little green onion.  If you just want a little light appetizer it's only $1.50.  But for a $1 more you get the chinese fried dumpling.  


Be sure to bring cash.  You can pay with card but their credit card reader wasn't set up yet.  Instead they did it the old fashioned way where they get an imprint of your card and you sign it.    


Just 1 star off for now, when I asked about certain items on the menu, the servers couldn't exactly describe some of the offerings.  For example, I asked what 8 delicacies rice was.   Waiter was stumped, just said it was sweet.   Other than that, everything was fine.  Staff was friendly, ample room for a good amount of people.

First of all the dumpling was horrible, maybe it was hand-made but it tasted like it's been frozen for too long. Also it didn't come with a dipping sauce. The inside was kind of cold and not hot and fresh which I expected.  Way too much flour for dumplings and hardly tasted any shrimp.

The menu is divided into small dishes (for example, beef noodle soup, Chinese chives dumpling, lamb kabob, popcorn chicken fried rice and chow mien), dumplings ( pork cabbage, pork and shrimp cabbage, lamb and cabbage & egg chinese chives.) try them poached, steamed or pan fried, with different meat and chinese vegetable fillings, or vegetarian. Then there's the cold dishes like cold seaweed, potato's shredded noodles and shredded tofu curd. There's a list of hot and cold drinks and a tiny choice of beers - Chinese plus Heineken as well as a few non alcoholic offerings.
We had a good feed for two plus SODAS for $70.00. And we were out in under an hour! 
It's not the sort of place you go for a leisurely amble through the gastronomic landscape. Its not a romantic hideaway. It's good food and good value from friendly people.

I'm completely addicted to dumplings right now after having a whole bag of Ling Ling dumplings from Costco for every meal for two weeks... But Fat Dumpling is what started the addiction...

What Fat Dumpling has going for them is that they don't try to be too much. Most of the menu is dominated by the standard style dumplings. You can tell by the taste that these are made in house, and I'm further convinced by how they treat their smoothies.

The first time we went, we were told that the tapioca pearls weren't ready yet (it was around 11 in the morning), and that it would be close to an hour. A little disappointing that they aren't made ahead of time, but considering that some pearls take almost two hours to make, it isn't too surprising. In fact, they do let you have yesterday's pearls if you want, or there's some yummy jelly options. But what convinced me to keep coming back here for their smoothies was that they use fresh fruits and not some substitute like powder or syrup. The prices are reasonable, and the mango smoothie is one of the best I've had and isn't overly sweet as well. Usually I get a large and it's gone by the time I get home :|

Then there's the dumplings - I thought the flavor was good. No sauce is needed here, though you can always have some if you like. I've also tried their popcorn chicken which has a good flavor but might be a tad salty. On the very plus side, the chicken was very moist and had a good amount of meat. I also tried their steamed pork dumplings which had a good flavor in my opinion.

Overall, I simply just enjoy the simplicity, price point, and flavors they offer here. It is probably my favorite local Chinese joint in Las Vegas.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,3,2,5,Mc_ilCJy3CEJiSxckG5KNQ

Takoyaki, Chicken Wings, Karaage Chicken, Green onion Pancake, Chive and Egg Dumpling, and for the steamed dumplings, we had Shrimp and Chive, Vegetarian, Beef, Lamb, Pork, and a few others I don't remember.

Standouts for me were the Lamb Dumplings, Chicken Wings, and Karaage Chicken.
I also got an Avocado Boba Smoothie which unfortunately tasted watered down(stick to #1 Boba nearby) Service was good and attentive. This was just a fraction of their menu items we got to try. I'd like to return to try other things on their huge menu.

Just a heads up and maybe what Ramsey H. mentioned(?) They have Durian as one of their smoothie flavors, and during our lunch, it permeated the dining room about two or three times when people ordered smoothies. Smells like dirty diaper..:(  ALOHA!!!

Definitely a rare occurrence with all the boba and tea places around Chinatown. The smoothie was great and the boba wasn't overdone or hard, the perfect texture. The takoyaki portions they gave were generous, I was only expecting 5 balls tops, but they gave 8.  The menu states that you get 14 dumplings per order but I felt as if there were more than that, which is always appreciated!

Any ways Fat dumpling is in the China town plaza well the strip mall part of it so you know parking sucks, but it's mostly due to the popular restaurants such as hot&juicy crawfish pho Kim long, and yama sushi. This place is easily over shadowed due to that. But let me tell you if you want good food at an affordable price this is your place! Pretty big menu selection, huge boba and smoothie selection well surprise you. The portions are massive so don't order to much food you can easily share dishes. The food it's self is good! Now it's not nothing that will blow your socks off but for it's price you really can't complain.  The chow m ein was not overly greasy which I did not expect. The beef noodle soup was excellent nice big chunks of beef the broth was super beefy, the only thing I disliked was the noodles they could be a lil thicker and the broth doesn't really stick to the noodles. I recommend getting a mango smoothie it was amazing you can taste real mango the freshness is to die for. Also I  tried some beef chive and shrimp  dumplings, they were good I never really had dumplings before so I can't compare them to anything but let's just say the hot chili oil and black Chinese vinegar came in handy. The reason I did not give this place 5 stars is the service or shall I say the lack of service. Smile more ladies ! Check up on your customers while they are eatting,  I shouldn't have to wave you down to get your attention.  But other than that it was great . I ordered two smoothies ,6 or 8 pcs dumpling I forget, beef noodle soup, and shrimp chow mein, which in total was under 40 dollars and it's probably the cheapest your gonna get in China town and you know I asked for a to go box lol .

Service was terrible.  Yes, its a Chinese place, and I don't expect 5-star service, but seriously?  We stood in line, and then were told if were going to eat here, then to sit and wait for service.  The people behind us asked for take out and ordered before we did.  They got their order in their takeout boxes and plastic bags quickly, then sat down in the restaurant to eat.  We on the other hand sat their for the slow and rude service.

The dumplings which I thought would be the highlight of the place were terrible.  Super chewy and slimy exterior, and mediocre filling.  The sesame chicken we ordered was overly sweet, and mainly batter instead of chicken.  Boba drink had a funky aftertaste, and not sweet enough.  Best thing there was the beef chow fun.

My preferred boba in the area is No. 1 Boba Tea. However, one of my friends recommended Fat Dumpling, and it was literally a short walk from where we had eaten dinner. I was really confused until I actually saw the menu because I'd only heard of the dumplings, but they have pretty much every typical flavor of fruit that you would find in one of these places, including durian.

They proudly display on their menu that they use real fruit. You can see them use real fruit as well. That's a solid plus compared to some other places. I just wish that I had seen Nelson Q.'s review before I made my choice of the avocado smoothie (without toppings) because I definitely would have picked something else.

What I got definitely had the texture of avocado, but definitely less flavor that I would have liked. More importantly, it doesn't seem like they've added any sugar whatsoever. Basically, it was more of a nice textural experience than a flavor experience, and I had to endure it with the small diameter straw that I had selected because of my peculiar avoidance of boba.

I will gladly try a different flavor if I'm ever invited here again. I just can't recommend this place yet based on my personal experience.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,2,1,3,YMlTOL32ynhx3ceUjZjYpQ

Since it was my first try I stuck to favorites like Singapore style noodles, Bok Choy, and Pork Dumplings. All delicious and served up hot!

I ordered the pork, chive, and shrimp dumplings--every order comes with 14 pieces. I kinda wish you could mix up your selections but I guess this makes it easier for the kitchen.

As for the food -- well, it's comfort food. I think they give the right amount of serving for the price they offer and the taste is good enough for me to eat as much as 10 dumplings in one sitting (which is a lot for a tiny Asian girl like me). I usually get the pork and cabbage dumplings and veggie steamed buns and dip them like crazy in a mixture of soy sauce and vinegar. Yum.

Their selection of drinks is okay as well. They're all in the same price range as other Boba places but the real winner is that they serve super fresh fruit smoothies. Now, this is just me being nitpicky, but I also wish they served Jasmine Tea with milk and Boba, too. Or just Jasmine tea itself with lychee syrup. That tastes bomb.

Note: we were not in a sweet mood so we didn't try the boba.

The xiao long bao were small as some have mentioned, and did visually resemble frozen 99 Ranch XLB, but they were much tastier, albeit a bit ghetto in presentation, having been steamed on paper towels instead of steamer liner paper or cabbage or lettuce. Still, they were a refreshing respite from all the sweet abominations I've been subjected to in my search for replacement XLB in the wake of the closing of Supreme Dragon in Diamond Bar, CA and the downhill-going of J & J in Alhambra, CA, my two favorite XLB establishments outside of NYC (Joe's Shanghai Cafe and Yeah Shanghai) and Hong Kong (Peking Lau, which I'm not even sure still exists anymore).

The pork potstickers were also quite good, juicy and thick-skinned, though not as good or as thick as the recently-defunct Shanghai Old Kitchen in Chino, CA (why does everything I love on the west coast have to close down?!?). I'm back to having to trek back to my old NY/NJ stomping grounds to get decent thick pork dumplings.

The hot tea was free and it was piping hot and jasmine, so I was happy.

Service was not bad. It's a casual boba place so you go up to the register to order, they don't take your order tableside.

Would definitely come back to try more items on the menu.

UPDATE:

We got a green milk tea boba the second time we came but when we asked for it to have no extra sugar, she said, ""I'll try but it won't taste good."" This is how we always get it and we like it, so it was insulting for her to say this to us. I'm not one of those people who uses the phrase ""the customer is always right"" to justify all kinds of unreasonable customer behavior, but I do think that she could have found a nicer way to tell us she thought we were wrong. We are obviously not the only ones who want our boba this way, since many boba shops offer different sweetness levels, INCLUDING non-sweet (technically probably no added sweetener, since it's still slightly sweet from the boba syrup). That said it came to us exactly right and tasted as expected: milky, tea-y, with just a hint of sweetness punctuated by sweet chewy boba.

Shanghai chow nin go was the wrong flavor profile but at least the rice cakes were nice and Q (chewy). This was made with chicken and did not have pork, beef, shrimp, spinach, or shiitake mushrooms. It was on the slightly sweet side and had too much cabbage. Would not get again, but it wasn't inedible.

Niu rou mien were not handmade but they were nicely cooked with a good amount of chew. The beef was tender and had a good bit of tendon-y bits (YMMV if you don't like tendon) but the broth was a bit bland and not spicy enough. It also had a hint of a strange flavor that wasn't bad per se but wasn't a taste I expect from this dish. Would get again.

Chung yao bang (green onion ""pancake"" - similar to Indian roti) were also nicely chewy but did not have enough green onions. Would also get again.

XLB were still small, still good flavor, but not soupy enough and not hot enough - these are supposed to burn if you don't take your time carefully biting a small hole and blowing and slurping your way through it until it cools off enough to take tiny bites of it. NOT be cool enough you can pop one in your mouth casually like a chocolate bonbon. That said, I would still get this again.

Still have yet to make our foray into the sui gao (boiled dumpling) or dry noodle parts of the menu. That's next on the agenda.",SkGhMBBRcvKq3bwjcjbs_w,0,0,5,ObKt8z6BknE0LUD5W2zgMg

Second, I am a bit disappointed that they only have large servings for dumplings. They should at least offer smaller servings so that people who doesn't have that much big of an appetite can try other dumplings too.

Good dumplings; the wrapper has a nice, slightly chewy texture and are filled appropriately. Most of our selections were in desperate need of seasoning, though this was remedied with a douse of dipping sauce (which you create yourself with vinegar, soy sauce, housemade chili sauce, and seasonings).

We tried four types of dumplings: Pork Chive Shrimp, Lamb Carrot Cabbage, Chicken Cabbage, and Shrimp. These come in servings of 8 pieces (All options: 6.25-6.95; Shrimp: $8.25) or 14 pieces (All options: $9.75-10.75; Shrimp: $12.75). You can either have them steamed or pan-fried (additional $1). We did a mix of steamed and pan-fried and both options were pleasant. The only option that we were completely happy with was the Shrimp Dumplings. These had the perfect flavor and were quite tasty.

One of the few dumpling places in Vegas. The place was quite pack when we went in and they had only 2 people working the floor. Normally, restaurants with experienced waiters / waitress should be able to manage a restaurant that size but you can tell that they were inexperienced and forgot to bring us our drinks. 

Food
There are various dumpling selections on the menu. We decided to try the traditional pork and cabbage and a nontraditional beef and onion dumplings. The dumplings were good, nothing extraordinary and can't really compare to the places I've tried in Hong Kong or Taiwan but it was still good nonetheless after I'm a big dumpling fan.

We also had an order of the Green Onion Pancake which tasted like every other green onion pancake, but it was crispy and cooked pretty well.

We had an order of the Beef Noodle Soup. The broth tasted pretty good but the noodle were a bit overcooked. There was an wrong order of beef noodle that they bought out that no one claimed before we ordered and our order came pretty quick after ordering, just assuming they bought us the same order that was return. Anyways the portion size was big, good enough for 3 of us to split a small bowl. Just the noodle wasn't anything special and other Taiwanese places would be more worth the price if you wanted Beef Noodle.

Dumpling - $8.75 for about 14 dumpling

The service was not so good, even for a Chinese place. Two people were very nice but seems like they were unorganized and inexperience. Normally a restaurant of that size, even 1 experience person should be able to manage it but they had 2 people that forgot to bring us our drink order (water) and messed up on other peoples orders. A lot of times, it was a lot faster to just stand up and grab a set from the next table then call one of them over.

Overall
The food was ok, It was still a little bit pricey in my opinion for dumpling but it makes sense because restaurant have to make some return. The service wasn't great, you can tell they were really trying but after being open for a while and seeing other yelp review, would have figure they improve their service standards.",sCb9265DeUJLDIcvs03Owg,1,0,3,seJI-RwCEWffyj1qWLv-kA

It was flavorful and had bits of taro in it. Boba was standard soft chewy and a bit mushy. Next time I'd like to try a smoothie since they add fresh fruit in their smoothies.

Their boba drinks are made with real fruit (Saw them cut up a huge watermelon for my smoothie), so to find a few seeds in my drink is really no big deal.

Strawberry Banana Chocolate Smoothie:
I got this with boba. This is one of my favorite flavor combos. Equal parts of delicious strawberry, chocolate and banana. The black balls were soft in the mouth. Mmmm... 4/5

Thai Milk Tea:
As if a big cup of smoothie wasn't enough, I also had to try the Thai tea boba milk tea - I love this stuff. This was a bit too sweet though. 3/5

Pork and Cabbage Dumplings:
You can either get 8pcs or 14pcs. Make your own dipping sauce. I'll give the sauce I made 5 stars (self love). The dumplings were a bit doughy but it has lots of hot steamy juices so it's understandable. The filling was tasty. 3/5

Beef Noodle Soup:
The noodles were thick like chow mein...maybe, it WAS chow mein. They're a bit generous with the beef chunks and chopped Chinese cabbage. This reminds me more of Filipino beef mami than the mildly spicy Chinese/Taiwanese beef noodle soup. If this was sold to me as beef mami then I'd give it 4 stars but since it's beef noodle soup...2/5

Standards have never slipped - emphasis on simple, fresh ingredients, prepared into comfort food.  I've gotten adventurous and my favorite smoothie is off their ""crazy fruit"" menu - papaya, watermelon, strawberry, banana and (yes) avocado. The avocado gives it a creamy, almost milkshake texture that is really satisfying.  A huge kick of vitamin C and potassium - I go to Chi Kung classes at the Lohan school down the block and this smoothie is frequently my post-class dinner.

Another staple is the peanut, celery and carrot salad.  Boiled peanuts and the celery/carrots are just blanched - lightly steamed, but still crunchy.  Tossed in chili oil and spices (but not too hot).  The perfect healthy snack and I've gotten several co-workers addicted to it!

They've introduced more menu items and I have yet to find anything that doesn't work - various kinds of new pho (the rare beef round steak pho is sensational), fried snapper (little whole fishes flash tempura fried, super tasty!), turnip stripe pancake (more of a mini eggroll pie then a pancake; so delicious - filled with mashed turnip, a bit of meat and assorted vegetables.  Its a meal in itself and less than $4!!).

They also started selling their homemade dumplings frozen by the bag - comes in a freezer bag of 50 pieces.  I have pork and cabbage dumplings in my freezer right now.  $25 or $30 for 50 dumplings (depends on the type) - I throw them into some broth for a quick soup at home.

Service is always friendly and the prices are incredibly reasonable, even compared to some of the other restaurants in Chinatown.

Decided to finally try this place out after a day at CES. So what did we order? The dumplings of course! We ordered the pork, chives, and shrimp dumplings -- which are typically the ones I always eat. I decided to skip on any of the appetizers due to Jennifer's review. However, I did order some xiao long baos (steamed pork soup dumplings) because I was curious and I just had to see how they were.

They gave us some spicy and salty peanuts while we waited for our order along with tea and iced water. Then this odd sound came through ...and I'm thinking, ""Is she hand chopping the pork?!"" Whoa, like whoa. It sounds like it. Anywho, the wait wasn't as bad for me .. maybe a 15 minute wait for the food to come out. The dumplings came out piping hot and fresh! There were 16 of them by the way. And the wrappers they used for the dumplings did NOT look like the typical thin store bought wrappers at all! They were thick and chewy just like how I usually prefer them. So it does seem like the dough is made from scratch by them. 

I just couldn't wait and I dip a dumpling into some vinegar and start munching! Juicy, warm goodness in my mouth! The flavors were good. It was a great balance between the pork and the chives. Not too bad, not too shabby, and authentic to the bone. But wait, the vinegar is a little bit too sour for my tastes. I think I prefer red vinegar when it comes to eating dumplings. And also, that's when I noticed that my boyfriend is dripping juices everywhere -- dumpling juices! Where are our plates? Where are the soup spoons? Awkward. We end up asking for soup spoons but decided not to bother with the plates. We were eating them too fast anyways.

As for the xiao long bao's, skip them please. They were small. They were bad. It had this odd taste to the soup in them that I did not like. The meat was fine but their soup was a no go. 

The service was good though. Our teas and ice water were almost always filled. They were quite attentive. Though a warning, all of the servers are mando and/or canto speakers so their second language is English. They may have a heavy Chinese accent and may not thoroughly understand your question. Not sure if that's something that people get turned off about but just a little warning. So just gotta be patient :)

Great dumplings. Gotta be from the dumpling menu! No to the xiao long bao/steamed pork soup dumplings. Pretty nice service. Think I will come again just for dumplings and maybe try their smoothies and/or milk teas to see how they are. 

However, one thing is, CASH ONLY currently. They don't even take your card. They told me that their credit card machine isn't in yet so they can't even accept the payment.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,5,3,4,qsJ_walkeLz52SE3VXOFmw

Each order of dumplings has 14 of these little babies.

I got seated right away as soon as I walked in but the service quickly deteriorated from that. Never even took our drink orders. But whatevs. They had one person manning everything at first and then a second person had to help. You can tell from some of the tables that they're trying to get their attention for assistance. They're definitely short-staffed to save on money or something.

In the end, the dumplings and the green onion pancake was just okay to me. But the beef noodle soup was surprisingly not too shabby :0D. They also have boba drinks but we didn't end up trying any.

I don't know when I'll be back, if at all. I'm not too much of a dumpling person anyway.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,2,0,3,Ll7JUvbWRShr6UYnfCQOKQ

We tried the shrimp and the chives and bask choy and pork dumplings and they were both excellent as lwell the beef and onion pancakes which were cut open in front of us while we watched the juices flow out onto the plate.   They were so good!   
Today's second visit Gabe is an excellent review of their best of Vegas scallion pancakes.   As well as maintaining their consistent excellent quality dumplings.   This restaurant is definitely a keeper for us! !!! Five Stars !!!",5LgPA0DqQzGso79Pry30Jw,0,0,5,60GSBCOvZQS356rUXdvxzw

We ordered the following:
- Xiao Long Boa (XLB) was really good.  Make sure you ask the waiter for fresh sliced ginger.  There's vinegar on the table and the must-have for XLB is ginger and some red chili oil.
- Pork and Shrimp Dumplings - these were nice and plump - tastes really good with chili.
- Pan Fried Turnip Bun & Pan Fried Beef Bun - both were really tasty.  
- Fried Shrimp Rice - actually tastes really good with huge shrimp, fried egg, green onions.
- Papaya Boba, Avocado Boba - both taste fresh and the boba was spongy and chewy like it should be.

5765746,2014-12-01,0,6z3cgIE9dJ01wUm43f0yBQ,"Very nice, friendly dumpling house in Chinatown area with refreshingly straightforward menu (listed on the wall, on a giant poster for easy reference) and simple, non-garish interior.  Open late until 2am, which is perfect for late night food hunters who are looking to eat dumplings and other related Chinese food. The xlb here is good and juicy with decent skin thickness, and I would recommend that here.  They have a variety of different types of dumplings and filling, ranging from combinations of ground pork, cabbage, shrimp, beef, and lamb.  I stayed with the traditional pork and cabbage pan fried dumplings and was not disappointed. It's very authentic here and the young owners appear to have come here from mainland China or Taiwan, so I'm assuming they know what their food should taste like.  Inside is also a full on milk tea boba juice bar, which could be a whole store in itself judging by the selections.  

Fat Dumpling is located in the heart of Chinatown along Spring Mountain Rd in a shopping center with other late night restaurants.  Good place, I hope they do well.",o5PjjS1IxZ8rvBKSFZeM7Q,0,0,4,fD2S1_u-u-WSZCHive3Xbg
5778762,2014-03-12,1,6z3cgIE9dJ01wUm43f0yBQ,"i love dumplings, and like the name suggests - these are some fatties. they offer a pretty large selection of fat juicy boiled dumplings as well as other small dishes like msg-licious fried chicken wings, not as good boneless pieces of fried chicken, fat crispy pot stickers. everything we tried we really good and prices are reasonable. 

service is friendlier than a lot of other asian places, but they did forget a couple orders even though we were literally the only table in there both times i've been. we had enough food anyway, so not a big deal. i've ordered the lamb beef pork dumplings both times because why stray from something i already know is good. be patient and give it time to cool off so you don't burn the sh*t out of your mouth like i did. the filling is all meat and super juicy - way juicier than their crappy XLB soupy dumplings (definitely skip those). 

i'm pretty loyal to #1 boba for my boba fixes, so no clue how their drinks are. but i'll definitely be back for more dumplings in the near future.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,3,2,4,l_Eb9E03VUrWZeZthmuvSQ

Popcorn chicken
Pork, Chives, Shrimp dumpling
Shrimp dumpling
Green Onion pancake

The popcorn chicken was all right.
The dumplings were bland
The green onion pancake just tasted as if I was eating fried flour.

The only thing I did enjoy was the black sea same smoothie. 

This place is small, so seating isn't the best. When they first seated us, they put us under a counter... Like the counter's height was those for a bar seating or just to pick up drinks, but the place decided to squeeze some tables under there. When we saw another table clear out we asked to be moved. 

The service is really slow as well. The waitress took forever to take our order and even ignored us a few times when we tried to call her over to take the order.",_ciGAS7wUviQ0RPO2GWGYA,2,0,2,YjHta1W3cfEV837LmJfyow

The fried rice is a little expensive, but, it's enough for two sittings and isn't loaded down with peas like most places do to add filler.

I ordered vegetarian eggrolls and popcorn chicken.
The vegetarian eggrolls seemed to be frozen, as when we received them the inside was pretty much vegetable mush. But they were still pretty good.
The popcorn chicken was incredibly decent, I'm used to spicy dishes growing up in a Hispanic household, so the chicken was bland. But it was crispy and juicy and filling. 

I also ordered a jasmine milk tea and my friend got a green apple tea. 

The jasmine milk tea tasted very artificial. Not the best. I liked my friend's green apple tea a lot better-- very refreshing!! 

I would visit here again to try out more of the food options (:

They have a small dining area, but they can fit a sizable amount of tables for dine in guests. All the servers were really friendly and I was greeted quickly and politely by two when I walked in. One server told me they had only been open two days, so I was pleasantly surprised by how big a crowd of diners they had attracted. 

Their menu is extensive. I noticed soup dumplings and got excited, but since I was doing takeout I knew that was a no-go. Next time for sure. I ended up with the pork and cabbage dumplings and a taro slush with boba. My dumplings came out first and were packaged well to go. I had hoped for some sauces or something, but I just used some stuff I had at home to dip them in. My taro slush wasn't amazing. It was a little on the thick side and too sweet. Not my favorite in town, but they have quite a few flavors, so I'd be interested in trying some of their less conventional flavors. 

I tried some dumplings as soon as I got home and they were good. Lots of meat and pretty flavorful. Not the best I've ever had, but solid and a huge portion for the price. They're a new spot, so I give them the benefit of the doubt and I look forward to trying a few more of their menu items in the future.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,14,11,4,FYh6f_aPmKAVIPo5voCmIg

Lots of boba tea selections here and they tell me they use real ingredients as we complained about the taro tea being gritty but he showed me the real taro they use so it's not the powder. Prices are reasonable but not dirt cheap, it's worth it because the service is very good and the items we've tried are delicious. Gailan, fried noodles (Singapore style was delicious here), soup noodles (they even have pho here which is unusual for Beijing/Northern style fare).
