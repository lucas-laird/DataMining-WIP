First off, while I'm having a conversation with my husband (not loud at all) I don't care for an over-dramatic, ill-educated and condecending bartender telling us to ""tone it down or leave"" because we are apparently in a ""family establishment"" despite no one under 21 being permitted in the hermetically sealed bar area.
Secondly, for us just moving to the area and not knowing many places to go, this smokey dive bar with its narcissistic ""boss lady"" bartender Megan (obviously in dire need of attention) clearly lacks the fundamentals of management, as is reflected in the overall level of service.
If you're looking for a good dive bar, I recommend you raise the bar and aim higher than this tweaker infested ashtray of a watering hole. Your lungs will thank you!",GTRr-bNxKsWQu0_v4GK-mw,4,0,1,eKYubT6FaiIrOtMOWF8rxQ

302878,2012-07-14,0,vuqHcBCbxH36hCFsZ1W-0Q,I have only been in here once so this may not be a fair review. Came in around 4 PM and asked about happy hour specials and was told they didn't have any. Ordered a Bud Light longneck and they charged me $4. I commented that was pretty steep especially for a bar so far from downtown and was told i should have ordered a draft that it was a better deal. I guess i could have been told that from the beginning but oh well. Nothing exciting about the inside. Just a typical dark smokey bar trying to pass itself off as an Irish pub. I didnt try the food but the menu was typical pub fare with nothing really standing out. I dont see myself ever coming back to even rate it or give it a second chance.,SyJwSBcXtLMyunxrx6lymw,0,0,1,lmIvP3JSe_EVgysZfSinTA

We ordered a couple drinks and the bartender brought us two waters. We thought he was giving us something until he brought us our drinks - nope. We had to call him back over because we couldn't get either bartender to stop to talk to us. We asked him why the water and we were told we were being rude, we were there 10 minutes and only talked to each other! Next thing we know, Metro is walking through the bar! They called the police on somebody! We did not hear or see anyone being out of line. What the heck is wrong with this place? The bar emptied out within 20 minutes of us being there. There was only us and two other people. One of us asked for hard apple cider and was told they didn't have any. Even though we just saw the bartender serve it to the girl two seats down! What is wrong with this place? It was like the twilight zone! I have never seen a bar that was so rude to customers. My advise ...

i live near & decided to enjoy a late lunch. i look younger than my 28. so of course the bartender asks for my id. 
i hand her my usa passport id card. a valid government issued id, to be accepted everywhere.
on my passport id card, it says: nationality: usa 
placeofbirth: california, usa 
& birthdate prominently centered in black ink.

mrs. megan/meghan asked if i had my passport book, i said no, she said she couldn't accept my passport id card. & only allowed to accept passport books.  
i asked to see the policy in writing. as my usa passport id card is accepted elsewhere i patron. she said we don't accept passport id cards. i said okay, well i want to speak to the manager. apparently she happened to be.  i asked if she was the general manager? she said yes, i am the bar manager.
 i have the right to refuse service to anyone. i am refusing to serve you. i asked her, why am i being denied service when i gave you proper identification? is it because i asked to see the company policy, & wanted to speak to management? 

as our entire conversation was spoken calmly. i had no intention of ruining a great day, by her escalating it, if i tried to patron here further. 
i told her i will be contacting corporate about this uncouth service. & that's when i asked for her name. a manager should know how to treat customers & keep business. 

if this is company policy, a sign should be displayed visibly for patrons to see. if i was shown company policy i would have given her my ca state drivers license. since it is not displayed. when i asked megan/meghan to see the company policy, megan/meghan should have provided it. if megan/meghan had managed the task of customer service & represented company policy w/skill & integrity. i would not have felt the need to take 3 hrs to complete this review. this event occurred between 3-3:05pm 6/27/2018.

her description: bouncy black long hair, 5,5 or so, curvy body & small eyes.

ps: corporate/ownership is not found. if the owners/corporate let renegade management speak for their company w/out policy evidence that is bad business.

2177488,2013-01-09,1,vuqHcBCbxH36hCFsZ1W-0Q,"I've been in Henderson/Las Vegas again now for 7 months. My office is close to this place so I chose to move over here so that I could either have a short drive or just ride my bike. I had driven by this place many times and finally decided to stop in one night since I didn't feel like cooking or cleaning up. I had a few hopes of finding some place near me that I could hang out in every so often, but all hopes were dashed. 

I'm sure most people around here are use to the indoor smoking thing, but I am not and find it disgusting, though I knew this would be the case going in so I tried to find a spot away from everyone else. I'm sure you'd ask why I didn't just go sit in the dining room, but I was alone and I feel stupid sitting at a big table by myself. Plus, typically dining rooms don't have tv's so I'd just be sitting there alone and bored. The bartender finally came around and I got a Maker's on the rocks. I'm seeing a trend in this area that Maker's is as  good as it's gonna get. 

Looking through the menu I finally decided that nachos sounded good and were safe. Boy was I wrong. First off they drench the bottom of the plate with refried beans so you get this sopping mess of soggy chips in the end. Not sure how they managed it, but the nachos them self were boring as crap. The chicken was dry, the ingredients seemed bland, and really I only ate them because I was starving. 

The atmosphere was ok, but really it was just your typical smoking rednecks of Hendertucky. Seeing that it's across the street from my apartment, I wish I could say I would go back, but I highly doubt it. I was just terribly underwhelmed by the whole experience.",tL4NRC4uraCxjF8ZQ6GTTw,5,1,2,8YEwigoArtz0y5Fa4N5lsg

I've seen their sign advertising various specials and events, but given the crazy people that congregate around the bus stop nearby, I never wanted to risk going in and dealing with crazies.  My friend told me to meet her there one day after a softball game. My softball buddy and I went there and she met up with us later. We were hungry so we ordered some food. He went with the BLTAPNB which is a standard BLT with Peanut Butter. Seemed odd, but worth a shot. I went with the more than a turkey melt sandwich which has turkey, bacon, cheddar cheese, garlic butter, and Cajun mayo. We split both sandwiches and they were OUTSTANDING!  The prices were affordable too! Onion rings were good, a little on the undercooked side where the whole ring comes out of the breading, but whatever. French fries were cooked perfectly.  Beer is reasonable, both draft and bottle.  The only thing is, if you don't like a smoky place, this may not be the place for you. HOWEVER, they do have a small seating area/restaurant area that is completely closed off from the bar with glass partitions so that may work for you if you want something to eat.  Bar staff is friendly, and this is definitely a neighborhood joint where if you visit enough, they'll get to know your name and drink of choice.

The staff was friendly and efficient and the food was great.
April 2018 we again stayed and Siena Suites and ate most meals at Mulligans. They serve a great breakfast, the only near by place to get breakfast early, and have specials at affordable prices. We are traditional breakfast lovers, hashbrowns, eggs, bacon and toast. 3 days in a row our breakfast was wonderful. Cheryl and Pauline took great care of us and keep the coffee coming. 
We also had dinner twice. the first night we both had a burger and onion rings. Our last night in Vegas I had the Cobb Salad and was able to customize it to my dietary needs, my spouse had the fish sandwich. Both meals were excellant. 
The waitstaff in the evenings were very friendly, appropriately attentive and efficient.

2938246,2012-04-06,0,vuqHcBCbxH36hCFsZ1W-0Q,"When I first decided we were going to move to Vegas, I told my fiance I would not become a degenerate gambler. Apologies to those who are, because I am thisclose to becoming just like you and am proud to do so at Mulligan's. 

First, Jocelyn is the best bartender. I love her, her bangs, her personality, her everything. She is one of the top bartenders we've ever had and she makes our experience at Mulligan's 100 times better whenever we go (which is not as often since we're attempting to save up for our wedding...oops...VEGAAAS!). She works on the earlier shift, so see her then (e.g. football games).

Second, my fiance has won two royals there since we've moved to Vegas which has not been more than two years yet. That's saying something, but I'm not sure if it is about him or the looser slots? Let's go with loose slots. They have fun games and great incentives if you hit 4 of a kind, a flush, etc. You've got to appreciate the perks my friends.

Oh the food. Oh, yummy food. I could eat that $3.99 breakfast special any time. Two eggs, hash browns, two pieces of bacon, two pieces of sausage and one very large pancake. $3.99. YES PLEASE! We would go to Mulligan's after the fiance's graveyard shift, get the breakfast special and then drink, I mean gamble, I mean, talk to Jocelyn and act like respectable citizens. I love the atmosphere and the darker pub feel, especially since clubs and dance beats aren't really my scene anymore.

The Caesar salad no croutons with chicken? Hands down on the of the best Caesar salads I've ever eaten before. Huge portion, lots of delicious grilled chicken, they go somewhat easy with the dressing so I don't realize how many calories I'm consuming and oh yes, it fills me up for longer than an hour which is not normal with me and salads. Delicious. I want it almost every time. My fiance also loves the nachos and says they aren't too weighed down with cheese that ruins your meal with its greasy nature and the chips and light and crispy. He loves their nachos more than El Segundo Sol which is definitely saying something.

So go to Mulligan's for a nice relaxed time, no drama, just drinks, a little video poker, some sports and maybe you'll even meet some new friends to do all of the above all over again the next day. Great place.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,1,0,5,VsFCkBb7zqOdvMaCdOA9vQ

I myself have yet to enter on the right hand side. My bf and I came here when we had 2 NFL games to watch. I ordered the buffalo wings eventhough I was dying to try the hamburger b/c I saw another person who had just received their order @ the bar. The wings were good but not to die for or anything. Well since we had been there since 10 am... and here it was 4 and we were still there watching our games we just went ahead and ordered dinner. I ordered the cheeseburger and it was really really good. 
On acouple of other occasions we came here for HH. well it wasnt so happy b/c the prices were kinda high compared to other bars in the area (for mixed drinks @ least for happy hour prices. I dont think I'd come back here for just happy hour but I would come back for that cheeseburger or the wings. ..but its just hard to come here for wings when BWW is just 5 min. away.",cafRiSVWRXlxDEK2YNrJ6g,0,0,3,j2EhAuePdWKGz274coHiPw

Seriously, the philly cheesesteak sub is the most satisfying late night drunkin meal one could ever imagine.  Whether they are busy from UNLV game crowds or dead in the wee hours of the night/morning, they are always efficient and friendly.  Their prices are very reasonable and their menu is pretty extensive for a pub type establishment.  No matter if you are regular or a first timer, you will be made to feel welcome and leave satisfied.",lCYC5Ei9tIFBaW1AQfRu7A,1,0,4,EgVm5EXWDqiq7JUiZvR-ww

The place is super dark and has a section for dining and a section for the bar.  There are signs all over and pub style decor.  Remember when you come here, you are NOT allowed to say the F bomb.  If you continue saying that word, you will get kicked out.  I don't know why, but it's a rule they have.

Last night we got the chicken nachos, chicken quesadilla and the spinach and artichoke dip.  The food overall is pub food and good when you had a few drinks down.  Isn't really something I would choose to eat all the time, but it works.  I think I had an overall great experience with the staff and my friends, which made me give a higher than normal rating.  I wouldn't mind coming back if my friends ever chose this place again.",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,0,0,4,ZydJNk-bTRls5N_ACEb2FA

And for Mulligan's policy not using derogatory words in their bar is straight bs. It's a BAR for Christ sakes. Give a kit kat or snickers because that would've made me have a better time.

Since it was St. Paddy's Day, what better than to stop in, enjoy a green beer, corned beef and cabbage, and watch some NCAA March Madness BB.

They have a pretty large menu for a bar. They also run some good drink specials, ie 16 oz Guinness for $4, Irish Car Bomb for $6. I'm not sure what there normal specials are, since this was a special day.

I ordered the Corned Beef and Cabbage special meal, $15. Out came a huge plate loaded with Irish goodness. The Corned Beef was tender, and flavorful. So far my two meals at Mulligan Pubs have been very good. 

The bar itself is square, with plenty of gaming spots, and a 6 seat section of non-gaming spots. The dining area is separated by glass, so non-smokers can enjoy their meal. The air conditioning/air exchange felt pretty strong, I never noticed the bar area being too smoky.

Service was on point. Friendly, welcoming, and both bartenders worked together as a team to check on patrons. Great job!

I'll be back for sure.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,6,4,4,9sWoOBN_q6pI02tAaSsoFQ

If I have to be honest, though, I'm not sure I would have stopped by the place if I were just randomly driving by cause it seems a bit sketchy from the outside, but since it's right next door to the in-laws, the wife and I grab a few cold ones before heading into the madness.

The beer is great, Meghan and Andy are da bizness, and the place has a pretty chill vibe. You can tell the staff gets along with each other by their kwerky and sarcastic sense of humor; just the way I like it. 

I give it two enthusiastic thumbs up.",l_yEb3Q-q7C5Eq1HReCrzw,0,0,5,5pvXZGLKA4PVfe7MPLpijA

On our way home, we were hungry and craved a good beer, so we figured Mulligans would be a convenient stop. It looks ok when you walk in, clean, typical gaming pub and restaurant. We ordered a Stella off tap which was ice cold and refreshing in a frosty mug. After ordering food we were waiting, gambling and discussing our golf round. My friend said, ""Fuck, I can't believe I missed that putt!"" That is when the old lady bartender, Said ""Excuse me, but we don't use that kind of language here"" ""Our gaming clientele is older, respectable, and the owner doesn't allow swearing."" I thought she was joking, but the machine dealt me 4 to the royal for the 4th time and I said ""Fuckin A!!!!"" ""Fuck Me!!!!"" and she came back and reminded me in a calm way, ""No Swearing please, It is really a rule here."" Soon our Southwest Philly cheese steak sandwiches came out with fries, they were average at best but hot and fresh, lacking any substantial flavor but edible. But the old lady scolding me for language in an empty bar playing shitty old music left such a bad taste in my mouth that we left immediately after eating and will never consider going back. WTF? If you are gonna have freedom of speech censorship rules, please post on front door, so non conservative freaks know to turn around and not waste money in this boring, lame, establishment.",DN4UP-5EHYEU0LBI-5tdzw,4,0,1,j9ZFmii188aJw-vVnVN9rQ
