211972,2011-08-20,2,vHt0CSynqesXox-9nBj7uA,"One thing I know for sure: I am definitely NOT 'On the Border' about this place and I am a big believer in second chances when on the fence.

My spouse and I got $200 worth of Chili's gift cards for Christmas and after quickly getting tired of their offerings decided to try some of the other places that take their gift cards. After all, we weren't paying for it out of own pockets so taking a chance on new place could be fun. On the Border was one of the places that took the gift card so I looked up their menu on-line and thought it sounded promising. So off we went with empty stomachs and high hopes of finding another great location in our neck of the woods. 

We were initially pleased with the decor and cleanliness. It was around 8:30 so it wasn't too crowded - maybe 25 cars in the lot. In fact we were the only ones originally seated in our area (most of the other people were in the Cantina area.) I am wondering if this accounts for the poor service we received. Our drink orders (water) were taken and we were given a basket of overly salted chips and salsa while we looked over the menus. Our water glasses came about 10 minutes later when we were ready to order. I immediately drank the whole thing while the server was still there and remarked how thirsty the salty chips made me and requested a refill.

They were running an 'All-You-Can-Eat-Enchilada' special so we decided to try that. I took one bite of my beef enchilada and decided that was ALL I could eat! Admittedly my spouse's cheese and onion was slightly better but he agreed that he'd never order them again. The rice and beans that accompanied them were edible but still in the 'meh' category. Our server checked on us once to see if we were ready for another serving (no thanks!) Our water glasses were never refilled so I had to resort to the water bottle in my purse. We decided not to waste any more of our gift certificate on dessert. 

NOTE: It surprises me that in a service-driven economy like that of Las Vegas which is suffering from high levels of unemployment, that some servers who are fortunate to still have work don't apply themselves more to making their guest's experience a good one. I am a highly generous tipper when I get superior service, even when I didn't love my meal. Furthermore, because the unemployment here is so high, these food industries should have the pick of the crop when hiring and training employees so there is no excuse for poor service regardless of the poor meal.",2CwFylScEKXPN0fhknmt5g,7,2,1,IB_xGY0SzZmxRzzPRkmQiw

Chain chain, go away, come again another day. 

Ok so, as far as chains go, this place is OKAY. Eh, yeah...okay. I've definitely had better. The salsa and chips they give you in the beginning are good. And that's a star right there. Free salsa and chips that are tasty are extremely important. Yum. 

But then here comes the food. I got some kind of chicken fajita (FA JIYE-TA?!) that didn't have much flavor or zest to it despite being grilled chicken in onions. Try burger king style chicken among some chopped tomatoes and terrible guacamole. NO! NO! SAVE ME! 

Granted, the stuff my sister got, the chicken enchiladas, were much better than what I ordered. That's either a signal that you shouldn't order from the healthy side of the menu (which I did) or you should have the taste buds of my sister. That's your choice. 

Dessert was a saving grace, some kind of caramel chocolate empanadas with ice cream that really made the meal better. Well, it at least made me forget what I ate, until now.",BMEmpeosi4LfwRlAMgtjbg,5,4,3,WhaTEDsVCof_lsejK1SRuw

378316,2017-07-26,0,vHt0CSynqesXox-9nBj7uA,"We (my son and I) had never been here (in Las Vegas).  It would turn out to be the ABSOLUTE BEST PLACE we could have been.  This may be one of the longest reviews you have ever read, but I think it is worth it for this very special On the Border restaurant.

I believe that sometimes Las Vegas gets a bad reputation, but I think that is only because there are a lot of people who have yet to meet the REAL ANGELS who live among us here in Las Vegas.  My son and I have met many wonderful, caring and friendly people but today would be a Very Special Day for us (even though it did not seem like it could be with the way things had been going).  

You see, today we met One of those Very Special ANGELS here at On the Border!!!

PIt seemed like things were not not going well despite our attempts to change that since we had started our early day.  My son wanted to throw in the towel (as the saying goes) but I, of course, refused.  He agreed to at least go have some chips and salsa and maybe share a tea.  We didn't have any money, just what was left on a one year old gift card.

We were seated right away with our menus and then a very nice young man appeared with delicious chips and savory salsa and asked what we would like to drink.  As embarrassing as it was, I explained to the young man that my son was having a bad day and was hungry but that I only had a very limited amount on a gift card and asked what my son could get for that amount.                  

At first the young man gave us a couple of ideas and then asked if my son would prefer chicken or shredded beef tacos.  I asked for just one taco and my son's drink which, with 0tax, would max out the gift card.  The young man took the order and said he would get the order right out.  Then a female waitress came to our table, introduced herself and said she would be our waitress.  I thanked her for letting us know and informed her that the young man had already taken our order.

The next thing I knew, both my son and I had a beautiful plate each of two shredded beef tacos with rice and beans in front us!  This young man was really not our waiter (he, I believe worked in a different area in the restaurant).  He told us to please enjoy the meal and not worry about anything, that he had taken care of everything and if we needed anything to just ask him.  Both my son and I were in shock and very touched by this young man, this ANGEL!  

The food was very good and all the staff  were very nice, but this young Angel was special and I only saw him once more before we left, and that was to give him the gift card, thank him emphatically for his huge heart and generosity and told him my son and I would be back to pay him back.  He just replied, with a very nice smile, ""Don't you worry about a thing.  It was a pleasure to meet you both and I will be here whenever you need me.""

I want to applaud  On the Border for hiring all the wonderful staff they have there, the wonderful food they prepare and especially for having Angels in the business who provide a source of light and Good Will to others!!!!
My son and I will be back.  Thank you again, our wonderful Angel!!!",zAqNNW1YKtYjkuaEgIxRwA,0,0,5,7z4eJt6YbXFnYxUACNrgdg
389822,2015-10-05,1,vHt0CSynqesXox-9nBj7uA,"We came here as a party of 2 on a Sunday evening. It was completely empty when we got there. By the time we left it was full. So from my experience, it looks like the place is pretty popular. I just can't figure out why. 

The food came out pretty fast, which is a plus. However, the Mexican rice was grossly under cooked. It wasn't crunchy, it was still hard. The flavor wasn't bad, it just wasn't a pleasure to eat.

The refried beans were unusual. There was an odd smokey taste to it. It almost tasted like they took a can of baked beans and cooked them. I'm not really sure if I liked them or not. 

With the dishes we ordered, I'd say the food was OK. Maybe I was spoiled by the Mexican food I would eat in Cali, but for some reason, I expected a place called ""on the border"" to be somewhat familiar to the great Mexican food I used to eat. It just wasn't. I was disappointed by that. 

The true issue with this place is that the service is awful. When we were first seated our order was taken by someone who wasn't our server. She said that she's ""helping him out this evening."" I'd understand that if the place was busy, but we were the only ones there at that point. I'm all for getting faster service, but how much help could he have actually needed?

While we were there a large party came in. (Party of 9). We were unfortunately, sat right next to them. The reason this was unfortunate because we actually had to witness what good service actually looks like, while being basically ignored ourselves. It's one thing to get bad service. At that point I just chalk it up to the servers being incapable, and don't go back. It's quite another to witness the same, exact servers giving amazing service to another group, while basically shunning you.

I'm not even exaggerating. I had an empty drink for almost ten minutes. Meanwhile there is a server sitting at the table with this large party, having a casual conversation. To get his attention I just start drinking the non-existent drink, which makes a sound anyone in the food industry should understand. The server actually looks up at me, smiles, and continued his conversation. He wasn't taking an order, nor was he helping them in any way. He was just talking.

A few minutes later the girl who was ""helping our server"" offered another drink. Our ""server"" only made an appearance twice. To actually bring the food, and to drop our ticket. When he actually dropped the ticket he told us to take it to the cashier when we were ready, and pointed to the front desk. We went there right away and we're told that the server handles that. 

The manager said he'd take care of it and said our total was $50 more than the ticket actually was! I had to correct him as he walked away saying something about tips. That's pretty audacious to talk about tips with the experience we just had.

Finally some other server brought me the receipt back, and I left the lowest tip I've left in years.

Overall the food was decent, but the service was abysmal. If you want mediocre food and horrible service give this place a shot.",qy2iix8eGSrJzqkWsbHwtg,1,0,2,cc_Wr-iwwcWMnHH7J6dqcg

Then there's the issue of the really greasy, low-quality food that always leaves me with a tummy ache.  YUCK.  I honestly can't think of anything good to say about OTB.  Sorry.",9JSCHAgXnzQnna1a3crJOA,4,1,1,a4qmLU3ALt1AqKDn82R2Mw

Because we love the $3 strawberry margaritas, chips and salsa, and the price of the appetizers.  We put up with the consistently bad service for the two years because we could both have a drink or two and eat for $20.   What makes the bad service? There can be 5 tables of people and you would think there were 30 occupied due to the the slow service.  When we asked for more chips, it would take forever.  Sometimes didn't get utensils without asking; the check would take forever after done with meal; I had to go to bar and get my own napkins instead of wait forever-just nominal things like that.--BUT EVERY VISIT.  There are plenty of servers walking around so I don't get it.  I even made a joke of it on Facebook when I checked in and gave the weekly service problem.

524573,2013-12-07,0,vHt0CSynqesXox-9nBj7uA,"The beer was cold and even though it was not happy hour only $3.00 for an 18oz goblet. The decor was very nice and the bar was spacious, but only a few patrons even though it was Thursday and the the football game was on.

The salsa was terrible: All I could taste was cumin and tomato. I added some lime juice and a few dashes from the store bought hot sauce located in the condiment basket and it was passable.

I had ordered the steak nachos, but luckily I saw a plate being delivered to another patron and immediatly asked to order something else. In my opinion... Nachos should be a heaping mess of tasty goodness without ryme or reason, not 14 chips spaced evenly around a plate with exact portions of steak, beans and cheese neatly applied and dressed with 3 jalapeno slices and a scoop of guac and a scoop of sour cream. 

Instead, I ordered a combo plate: Fish taco, steak taco and a pork tamale with beans and rice. 

The fish taco was surprisingly good: Deep fried fish, pico de gallo, some type of southwest sauce and cabbage, but I have had much better from several restaurants and trucks around Vegas for allot less. 

The steak taco was a mixed deal: 5 slivers of steak, some type of southwest sauce and breaded and deep fried, but soggy, onion strings. I have never seen deep fried onion strings on a steak taco, but gave them a try... Disgusting. All I could taste was grease so I took them off and put them into my napkin, but then I had so much grease on my fingers I had to wave over the manager hiding behind a pillar to bring me more napkins. I asked for some pico de gallo, lime  and cabbage and the manager and waitress watched in wonder as I re-built and ate my taco... Decent taco: The steak was tasty, but there was barely any on the taco and I have had much better for allot less around town without having to make modifications for them to be edible. 

The pork tamale looked like hot dog wrapped in a thin masa casing with a dark brown gravy on the top. I would say it looked and tasted like it came out of a frozen microwave dinner, but unfortunately that would be unfair to microwave dinners. At least the other stuff looked like it was edible!

I am not sure how you can say you are a Mexican restaurant and not have edible refried beans, but ""On the Border"" managed to do it. The beans tasted like smoked paprika, which overpowered the beans and ruined them. Beans are so easy even Taco Bell manages to not ruin them... Just saying!

The rice was surprisingly good: Buttery with just the right amount of what tasted like soy sauce. I ate them all, but was craving a fortune cookie after I finished.  Kind of wierd, but I was hungry.

In my opinion, ""On the Border"" is another chain restaurant that spent a ton of money on marketing and decor, but neglected to invest in their menu. The staff apparently knows the food is terrible, because they never ask, ""How is everything?"", but instead ask, ""Do you want anything else?"". The bar area is beautiful, but deserted, which is a shame, because there are only a handful of restaurants in the Centenial area and a ton of potential for a decent Mexican restaurant and Cantina to be successful.",3LmMwgI5vf1ZECblJniBsQ,0,0,1,je3OeWfKsMPAxT50QOVE0g

The service was some of the worst I've ever seen.  After waiting outside on the patio with three kids for fifteen minutes, I was forced to go inside and find two menus.  After another ten minutes I went in again and asked the bartender, who'd been outside several times, if I needed to order through her.  She said that she would let our server know someone was outside. (like it was possible to hide three kids and two adults).  

Our server was nice enough but no where near attentive.  We (4/5 of us) sat for some time with empty drinks.  We had to flag him down only to wait another twenty minutes for a box and the check.

1178943,2011-04-17,0,vHt0CSynqesXox-9nBj7uA,"In general, overpriced and underwhelming:
I was excited to try OTB, having heard decent things about it from others, plus I had a $25 gift certificate so I figured it would be a pretty cheap dinner.   About 30 minutes before we got there, there was an ad on TV for their ""endless enchiladas"" so we figured it would be a good day for our first try.

When we arrived, we were seated pretty much right away.  My children were given a page from a coloring book with two crayons each.  Unfortunately, my daughter received a gray crayon and a white crayon, impossible to color with.  We asked for other crayons but, no go, so she complained about that through most of the meal.  

Our waitress came up and apologized, letting us know she was the only one working that day.  She was the only great thing about our experience, as she must have been working her tail off, and still managed to be relatively attentive and prompt.  

We ordered two kids meals, the lunch portion of the fajitas, and I tried to order the endless enchiladas, but was told they were no longer running that special, even though the ads were still running.  I ordered the enchiladas combo plate for $1 more than the endless.  They gave us tons of chips and salsa, which was OK.  The chips were fresh and the salsa was spicy, but pretty watery.  

When we got our food, it was pretty disappointing.  Very bland, chain-y, nothing thrilling, and not very pleasant textures.  The kids' nachos were just about 6 chips covered in melted cheese, no meat or anything at all to go with them.  The enchiladas didn't seem like they had real tortillas on them, more of a thinly rolled pasta texture.

The bill was the most disappointing part - it cost $7.50 plus tax/tip to get my son's kids meal, which consisted of a handful of chicken nuggets, some refried beans and a ""chocolate"" milk that was still white.  We paid about $50 for lunch portions of pretty bad food, and not even enough to have leftovers the next day.  Not at all worth it.

1195162,2013-12-09,3,vHt0CSynqesXox-9nBj7uA,"It's funny that this place is named ""On the Border"" because it's right on the border of mediocre and actually bad food. Just in between there. Not offensive, just not actually good, either.

Lunch specials are priced right - $8.99 for two items or $9.99 for three. Portions are generous. Chips and salsa are underwhelming, and the salsa gives a slow burn that almost seems authentic (but again, not quite). I ordered Caesar salad, a tostada, and an enchilada. 

The Caesar salad was BAD. Because this placed seemed like a weird Mexican version of Applebee's, I expected a very generic Caesar. Instead I got some weird, flavorless Caesar-flavored vinaigrette with wilted lettuce and no croutons. NOPE. I put it aside after a few bites and notably received no questions from the servers. Normally when you don't do more than touch something you order, a server displays some worry. ""Did you not enjoy that? Is something wrong? Is there anything I can do to fix it?"" I don't even care that they're not going to do anything, it's the gesture that counts. 

Both the tostada and the enchilada were alright, but very flavorless and underwhelming - pouring salsa on them helped, but not much. The meat was either bad quality or incredibly poorly cooked (maybe even burned a little). Not into it. Beans and rice were fine but nothing special.

The one thing I will say that's positive about this place: they have a great interior designer. Whoever put together the decor in that place has a real eye for it. It's very nice looking and probably draws in way more customers than the food. They also have a huge flatscreen so you can watch the game while you eat your mediocre, bland food.",HxeiKWNQhp1QD7oImwzIxw,2,0,2,SJqM57C-Ju1BiW3HauKaRg

My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch. I usually get the brisket tacos, which are fantastic. But I wanted to change it up, so I got the three-item lunch combo with chicken tortilla soup, a ground beef taco, and a mushroom and spinach enchilada. The spouse had the lunch-sized beef fajitas. Each came with a side of rice and beans, and unlimited chips and salsa (we only had one bowl). We had so much food that we both had leftovers. We also each had a grande house margarita, which was good -- not great -- and I had an icy cold goblet of Dos Equis amber. Yum!

My husband enjoyed his food, and my meal was good as well, although I'm pretty sure I will stick with the brisket tacos next time. As I said, I'm baffled by the poor reviews because the staff was great -- from the hostess, to our server, to the manager who stopped in to see how we were doing -- and the reasonably priced food was pretty tasty. I just wish there was an On the Border closer to my house. Or, then again, maybe I don't, because I'd probably be dropping a pretty penny in there for happy hour every week!

If you're in the mood for some Tex Mex, give On the Border a try. It's not like mama (or abuela, if you're lucky) used to make, but it's pretty good in a pinch.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,2,2,4,BWIcUVmvp02yy04Tb4JTLA

we were seated immediately
got drinks & chips within just a few min (chips were good & fresh-salsa was weird, had an extraordinary amount of cumin, but ok-spicy after half a bowl)
our server greeted us &  gave us a few minutes to look over the menu, he didn't recommend anything or mention any specials, which was ok with me.
I asked him how popular the fish tacos were, he stated that a lot of people order them-which, in retrospect I should have asked if people LIKED them??!!
so we order the fried avocado appetizer & I ordered a cup of tortilla soup, 

appetizer (fried avocado ) takes about ten minutes to get to us, but , alas, no soup. we finish the app & first basket of chips, twenty minutes goes by - NO SOUP, guess what?? entrees hit the table after 30 min elapsed....we ask the back waiter - wheres the soup??? his blank stare says it all - i tell him cancel the soup

I ordered the 3 fish tacos - my wife orders the fajita chicken salad, my son gets teh shredded beef burrito

to sum up - Son's burrito, ok ok, temp ok, but shredded beef had a not normal flavor, not bad, just weird

chicken fajita salad...platter was barely sizzling at arrival, but that's ok, chicken was very tasty, but the contents of the salad were pretty dismal in my opinion, and the dressing, im pretty sure was Ken's ranch, otherwise a lower quality ranch dressing

fish tacos - ** note to restaurant** A fish taco is supposed to be CRISPY, so taco items should be served on SIDE, if you put all the meaningless crap on the fish taco , IT MAKES IT SOGGY!!!!

server could see we were not enjoying meal but made no effort to even engage us to ask any questions

the restaurant was busy, but I could tell the servers, all of them, were relatively new, none of them looked like they had a clue. i saw our waiter forget things, from other tables, see the dumbfounded look on his face & watched him turn around to retrieve whatever it was he forgot at least 5 times in the course of our meal

Once they finally came to our table we got drinks, apps & meals, they had an endless enchiladas special for $10 so my friend and I tried it the other two with us got regular menu items. When it came time to check out the manager on staff Luis made the call that they would not apply my active duty friends military discount to her regular priced menu item, even though the endless enchiladas were a deal on a separate check. However the excuse Luis gave us was we sat at the same table. How patriotic. I will urge other military members to avoid this location. Never at any other location have they ever told a member serving their country no you can't have your discount because your friend on another check got a special. The only good things about this visit was our fantastic waiter Christian A. who once assigned to our table was phenomenal and the food quality has gone up significantly since it last visit. But I highly urge ownership to look into their unsympathetic unpatriotic monotone management. 


**old review** So I received a second opportunity from ownership to come give this location another try, and I didn't think it was possible but the service managed to become even worse as well as the food. When we walked in the door there was a line and no hostess. The first family had been waiting before us and by the time someone seated them and then us about 10 minutes had passed. The server we had was less than enthusiastic and didn't greet us or get a drink order in until we had been siting for over (again) 10 minuets and three different people had seen us. For a Friday night it was a ghost town, and so was their Cantina. I brought two other couples with us for a group date night and they would all agree with what I am saying. The chips and salsa were fine but the chips some how managed to have no salt on them and it had all been piled up on the bottom of the bowl, and we constantly had to ask for more salsa they gave a table of six people 4 cups of it and two of those people being from Texas... personally speaking we love our salsa. We also had to ask for our own drink refills which having been a server myself is unacceptable. I got a create my own dinner with 3 kinds of enchiladas. The cheese enchilada was so hard I couldn't even cut it with my knife that was sharp enough to cut through meat easily and the onions were invisible to my tongue. The Chicken Tinga enchilada was so mushy and watery I didn't even know it was chicken until I opened it up to check it. The spinach mushroom enchilada was good on the spinach but lacking int he mushroom department. The sauces on all three of the enchiladas were good though. The black beans were so cold that the cheese they put on top never melted. and the rice was yummy minus the very, very dry corn in it. At least he got the order right the kitchen just didn't do what they are paid to do apparently. When it came time to check out I was shocked at what came out of his mouth next... If we split our check to the three couples he couldn't do the military discount. BUT if we kept it in one check he would. Having been in the business myself I know how much of a pain splitting checks are but seriously?? These men that are with us don't want to have one guy pay for everyone, let alone they deserve to each have the discount just for serving our country. I was completely amazed and offended for them. On top of that I had the email for a buy one get one up to $10 for labor day weekend that the server forgot about. The only decent experience was the manager working this shift. She stepped up and fixed my check then added the discount for the Military onto all of our checks which she said she wasn't suppose to do. I love OTB but needless to say I will not be going to this one again anytime soon since this was suppose to be their second chance for us to try them out per- owners. When I lived in Texas I went 4-6 times a month and this establishment is an embarrassment as to what On the Border's standards are. They need new staff. And their 21 year old rule for the cantina is losing them money still, when they desperately need the business having been almost completely empty on a Friday night.",VzhTzkUePWU5ytmgc-oNVg,1,3,3,ASrvKtHTltTVRIbHfdgajQ

First the host placed me and my wife at a booth that would fit 8 people. The window was facing the afternoon sun and she never asked to lower the blinds. After a few minutes of sitting in the direct sun and starting to sweat, I asked we could be moved. She asked if we wanted to sit at the bar. "" No, please just seat us at another table or booth"".  She did as I asked. Even though the table she took us to was clean on top, you could have filled a waste basket with the food and chips that where under it. She grabbed a broom and did sweep it out. So I started to look around. The place was a complete mess. Tables with plates and food still on them and the floor was a complete disaster. Ok, lets just eat I told my wife.

We finally went back on Sunday, and wow...the entire menu has changed, and not for the better.  The taquitos (or flautas) are off the menu now, but they kept that disgusting empanada (all flour, no taste).  So, I was told they would still make them (keep in mind these are small, rolled, fried meat-filled), and what they brought me - as an appetizer I assume - was something thick, still fried, but with a different filling that was a LOT spicier and not as good as the original, AND charged me $10!  We also decided to order their special, which was two chicken fajitas, a bowl of queso and sopapillas for dessert.  The queso was thin, as if they'd been adding water throughout the day to stretch it.  It was also not mentioned that the fajitas would be a lunch portion only (we were there for supper) and no one asked if we wanted flour or corn tortillas (I would have preferred corn), or what kind of beans; they brought watery refried beans that are probably the worst I've ever tasted.  To top it off, they were out of sopapillas!  It's on the special.  Advertised.  And they were out.  But they substituted a brownie sundae to share - which had me wondering, since everyone around us was receiving an individual sundae with the special, why did we receive one to share?  Just curious about that one...

Bottom line: We were told  ""Corporate"" decided to change the menu.  Now it's just like every other Mexican restaurant in town, and we have no reason to drive the twenty miles to eat here.

I got the Tortilla Soup, thinking it was the safest bet, considering I never like their food, and it was terrible.

August 21, 2013
Stephen V. Clark
Chief Executive Officer
On the Border Corporate Headquarters
2201 West Royal Lane
Suite 240
Irving, TX 75063

Mr. Clark.

I thought I would write to you today to let you know that I have been a loyal customer of your restaurant chain for many years. When I travel on business and get to my hotel I usually look to see if one of your On the Border restaurants is in the area and at least once a week I will wind up having dinner there or just hang out in the cantina for a while. Most often on business trips I visit your outlet in Kennesaw Georgia where my company is located.

When I moved from Connecticut to North Las Vegas in the fall of 2011, I was pleasantly surprised to find one of your restaurants not far away in Centennial (5630 Centennial Center Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89149). I actually found out about this particular On the Border because I received an email from your corporate office regarding a free lunch for Veterans Day or Memorial Day 2012 (I can't recall exactly which one.)

And this is where my problems with your organization began and why I will no longer visit your restaurants.

1. I went to the Centennial location for the advertised Veterans special; I sat down and asked for the Veterans Day menu and I was summarily told that this particular establishment does not follow corporates advertising and marketing campaigns. I was not pleased, however, I still ate there that day.


2. The week of August 4th 2013 I took my son to your restaurant. My son is 3 months shy of his 21st birthday and he is an active duty United States Marine (at the time on leave from Okinawa Japan.) While here in the Las Vegas area, my son has never had an issue sitting in a restaurant cantina or bar as long as he is not consuming alcoholic beverages. On this particular occasion we were going to order lunch while sitting in a booth along the windows as far away from the bar as possible. It was not long before we were summarily kicked out of the cantina into the regular seating area. I was informed that since he is not 21 he couldn't be in the cantina. Well, it was annoying but if that's your corporate policy, I figured we would get over it.

3. At least twice a month my wife and I visit this location for Taco Tuesday. The day before my son returned to his Okinawa unit (August 13, 2013), we returned to your Centennial location for $1.25 Taco Tuesday. I walked in the restaurant and mentioned to the manager about what happened the week before, that we could not sit in the cantina, but we wanted Taco Tuesday. He told us he could not serve us Taco Tuesday specials in the main restaurant and that since my son was not 21 and could not go in the cantina, he could not take advantage of the Tuesday special! He wasn't very pleasant about it either.

After I gave your manager a piece of my mind, my son and I did an about face and ate at one of your competitors locations down the street (in their cantina no less!)

As stated above, I will no longer visit any of your locations, local or otherwise.

Sincerely,",s9F7XyxK8nG0HnGvCT8W5g,8,1,1,NLqWnwiUL29lA2d69A_doQ

The g/f and I went there to enjoy their Loaded Carne asada tacos.  They were not what they used to be, but still good nonetheless.  That's about all that I can say was good about the experience.  The Refried beans were gross (they tasted slightly sour) and the same for the rice which also tasted old.  The service was near the bottom of all experiences I've had.  Not the worse, but pretty bad.  Never offered a refill on my beer.  My g/f was never offered  a refill on her water.  Both of us had empty glasses before we finished our meal.  They were still empty when we left.  

The worse part was how they served us food and failed to bring out utensils.  I asked the waitress who brought the food for utensil and she was never to be seen again!  So after about 3 minutes of waiting I asked another waitress.  She came back after a few minutes with utensils.  So we were able to enjoy our meal 5 MINUTES AFTER IT ARRIVED.  No bueno!  So we are trying to enjoy our meal and the table next to us experience the same thing...  but only worse.  They get their food and no utensils, so they ask the waitress for some and she says, she will get them.  She then walks over to the register and works on fixing some orders.  Now mind you the people who asked her for the utensils can clearly see that the waitress was not getting them because she was 5 feet from their table.  After waiting 5 minutes themselves with their food in front of them and the waitress they originally asked for them, they finally ask another waitress for the utensils.  They still had to wait another few minutes.  I can only imagine how cold their food was.  About a minute later, I saw a woman waiting by the bar who appeared irritated.  She waited for about 3 minutes and not a single waitress or bar tender was in sight.  She then went to the hostess at the front entrance.  What was she upset about...  She had her food WITHOUT ANY UTENSILS.  This is a restaurant for crying out loud!  By this point, I'm pissed off that what we experienced was very similar to what others were experiencing, so this seemed to be the norm, rather than a one time thing that a simple apology would do.  The waitresses disdain for each other was clearly evident as well.  

Maybe I would have enjoyed my experience and would have remembered and cared less if I was drunk...  But I wasn't offered another beer!  So they have no one to blame, but themselves for this scathing review.",NktC3FNiPJRbx2Oly0Xtew,4,0,1,fXlyOIbYHir6A8bhlLTCgQ

The last time we went we had a very long wait and bad service but good food, so we thought we would give it another chance.  I guess shame on us.  We had a large party and the restaraunt wasn't busy.  We had to go to the bar to get our drinks because the price difference in the dinning room was unacceptable.  We ordered our food and it took about 45 minutes for half of us to get our meals and another 15 for a couple more to get theirs and then another half hour for two other guests to get their's.  Several of us ordered the Chimichanga which we ordered smothered and none of them came out right, my daughter asked after 15 minutes for her salad dressing and an hour went by before she got it.  One person sent her whole meal back and ordered something completely different and when it came the food was cold.  Then.....the Manager  Dawn came over to the table and spoke to the couple who did not have their food yet and said she was going to take care of their's and when I said really you should take care of the whole table because nobody's was right and she put her hand up to me and said ""I don't hear you!""  then walked away.  The server Vicotoria, should be commended, it was her third day and she put the orders in correctly and she ran her ass off for us to try and make things right, but she couldn't go back and cook it too!  We asked for the Manager to come back to the table to talk to us and she wouldn't, she went by our table many times and kept her eyes in the other direction.  I can't believe this, it is acceptable behavior.  I don't know if the kitchen was just ""hazing"" the new girl or what but the Server Victoria was the only one who cared.  
 
I hope that you are more concerned than the staff at your restaraunt.  I want to say that I ate at On The Border in Maryland and it wasn't at all like this, but this one has 2 strikes and I don't think there will be a third attempt.",D5AJVzmyxsQSgCI62sedeg,1,0,1,re0bzVV9wFlxZR7rjJmf4g

For example, if I'm going to a barbecue joint, I'm fine with drinking from plastic cups and eating off of a paper plate, it's part of the appeal.  Something that bugged me about this restaurant is that most of their margaritas and specialty mixed drinks (each around $8.00 a drink) have pictures in the menu to reference.  Each picture shows each drink being served in a bar glass.  Three people at our table were given our drinks served in plastic cups, and not just a regular plastic cup with the restaurant's logo.  I'm talking about the sort of plastic cup that you get a sleeve of at Wal-Mart when you intend to have an influx of guests in your home.  Despite being annoyed by the plastic ware, they have a massive menu of mixed drinks with several that I'd like to try.

That snafu aside, the waiter was friendly, even if he did mess up my order, but he was extremely busy with the Cinco De Mayo crowd.  The food was alright, not the best I've ever head, but not bad by far...though, the queso was delicious.  I'd go back for appetizers and drinks alone.  All in all, not a bad restaurant.

This is a great place to watch sports. They had at least twenty, maybe twenty five televisions going on at once. And these aren't small TV's, NO, I'm talking big, super-sized TV's. The big suckers. There was one above the bar in my field of vision that I swear seemed as if it were on the edge of our table. It was even more noticeable when one elderly patron yelled out how much she loved near naked men wrestling in near barely there underwear. It changed my thoughts of the UFC fight to be sure.

I went without salad dressing and topped it with salsa. It was outstanding. The Mrs. got the Enchilada Suizas. Of course, I had to steal a few bites for Yelp review purposes.

Why 5 stars? I am vegan and we happened to be served by Christina also a vegan. She suggested some awesome menu items for us and was very engaging. My spinach and mushroom enchiladas with tomatillo sauce were so tasty. My husband loves the stuffed chile rellano dish.

My husband and I visited two times in less than a week. We used coupons and Christina and other awesome staff members made it a wonderful dining experience for us.

We buy our dogfood at Bonapart's Bone-appetite and the personnel and I are always talking how great OTB is and what we ate there. FYI Bonapart's Bone-appetite is planning on moving into the strip mall that OTB is located. This is so convenient. 

We highly suggest coming in anytime but particularly when Christina is on duty.",fT2yry9VgSa3EY-mpSahlA,0,0,4,_mcQrTpQQ-kZiSApFcPqdQ

Although today there's about 3 people right now. The food menu was a shame, nothing sounded appealing. So I went with fish tacos since it would be lighter and to be honest...who can mess up fish tacos? Well first the plate came, the tacos were so sad. No sauce, nothing to make it look attractive. Second the fish came all mushed up and placed in the taco like it was scraps. I had 1 of the 3, and it had a bad funky taste with it. Like it wasn't fresh. So automatically I didn't eat the rest. Why risk it? I wouldn't even feed it to my dogs! The beans were dry like if they scraped the pan to get it all. Rice was dry and flavorless. Only thing that was somewhat decent was the drink and that's because they just have to follow steps. I wouldn't come back!

3516991,2016-05-05,52,vHt0CSynqesXox-9nBj7uA,"I came here years ago after this location first opened and wasn't impressed. A couple of weeks ago, I received a gift card for On the Border that allowed hubby and myself to experience two different dinners here within 3 days of each other. For both of those experiences I placed a phone order that I was told could be picked up at the bar. The first time the order was bagged and waiting, but when I went to pay the girl behind the bar says ""don't forget the tip can be written in here"" when handing me the slip to sign. I was naturally going to leave a tip however it was tacky how she mentioned it the way she did and never once did she say hello, thank you or come again. The second pick-up order was worse. This time the order was not ready at the time promised and I had to wait at the bar an additional 25 minutes for the order and the girl working behind the bar (different person this time) could have cared less about my order not being ready, didn't apologize or reassure me when it would be ready and when it came time to pay was when the order was brought out and she only said ""ok here it's ready"" and took the gift card not even offering a receipt or anything about waiting. Customer service is lacking as badly as the quality of the food here. 

Free chips and salsa come with each meal. The chips come in a big bag and actually aren't bad. The salsa instantly reminded me of the salsa I had at Chili's years ago and then hubby reminded me that Chili's and On The Border are owned by the same company, so maybe it's the same. Either way, it was no bueno to me. Looked fresh yet had a funky taste. 

Baja ($11.99) - Chicken & cheese stuffed fried avocado with ranchero sauce and a chicken enchilada with sour cream sauce. The fried avocado was tasty and it ended there. When it comes to  enchiladas I prefer them with a flour tortilla and I requested this one to be made that way and I was told that wouldn't be a problem yet it was made with a corn tortilla and it didn't even have the sour cream sauce on it as described on the menu. Not only that, but the enchilada was rock hard! The menu says they are handmade, but maybe they are frozen after? The enchilada could not be eaten. The corn had a disgusting flavor. The beans were actually good. 

Street-Style Mini Tacos ($10.99 for carnitas) - Three mini soft corn tortillas with carnitas, grilled onion, Jack cheese, avocado, pico de gallo, roasted red chile salsa. Since I didn't like the rice previously I asked for double beans and they at least had cheese on them and tasted good. The tacos looked so good yet were flavorless! First off they only put onions, cheese and avocado on the tacos and forgot to include the pico and red chile salsa which is a bummer because it might have added some flavor to the tacos. The avocados were half frozen WTF?!?! 

I ordered hubby a burrito and asked if they could leave the black beans off and the girl who took my order said it would be no issue. When hubby opened up the burrito it was small and cut in half almost like they forgot to include the other half of the burrito. It was also filled with tons of black beans and very little steak. There are certainly better options for legit Mexican food in the area and with all the things wrong I can't see coming back in the future even with a gift card.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,69,62,1,jhby0Xu2Mcs9ERX8NmdFJg

Please white people, stop trying to do Mexican food with inexperienced ""professionals"" and mediocre management.

Strike 2: Dirty pitcher, dirty glass and didn't pour the drink we had ordered. Simply stated she would be right back and by that time I had downed half my drink waiting for her to take my order.

The waitress offered to bring a side of mushrooms; ten minutes later she brought one mushroom that had been cut into six slices (took that long for the cook to grill it she said), but she did credit back the $.99 cents she had to charge me for the mushroom.

I went with a bowl of chicken tortilla soup, beef empanadas, and the sour cream chicken enchiladas.  The sour cream enchiladas were definitely the winner of the trio.

I had juices running down my arm.  The closer it gets to the elbow the better.  This made it about 1/3 of the way there. The margarita I ordered, though served in a beer mug (shrug), was good.  It was refreshing.  The chips are thin and crisp.  The salsa is blended and a little bit soupy but with a mouthful of flavor, it matters very little.  I have had a few different enchiladas here.

We checked into On the Border and got a free appetizer of quest dip. I had chili relleno and chicken taco. The chili relleno came out without sauce and I was excited! Because they are supposed to be crunchy. But then.... the chili still had burnt skin on it and was not deseeded so it was bitter. Hubby had a massive burrito that he said was too dry.

Update: the General Manager/Owner saw our review and was kind enough to give us a gift certificate to try them again. We had the sampler appetizer which was pretty good. Then I had the combo plate, cheese enchilada and chicken taco. Hubby had fajitas, I liked the taco, but enchilada was just ok. Hubby said fajitas were okay.

You would have to come here wanting Mexican food (Tex-mex to be precise - authentic Mexican food isn't served here), but not expecting to be amazed. And then they will either delightfully surprise you, or let you down completely. 

Me and the hubby-wubby-kins have eaten her on date night too many time to count. We first started coming here when we were dating for their $1 Tijuana Tuesday deal. If you sit in the bar area you will be served $1 tacos all you want all night long. Then they have drink specials (we only ever order margaritas, but they have bucket-o-beer specials too) unti 7pm. This is a fantastic deal - you get to choose between chicken, ground beef, or shredded beef and crunchy or soft shell. Free chips and salsa to boot. However, service is hit-and-miss in the entire restaurant and you take an extra risk on such a busy night in the bar area. Was it worth it for the tacos? Hell yes. 

After frequenting this place every Tuesday while pregnant with my first son, we discovered their Thirsty Thursdays. Premium tacos for only $2 until 7pm with drink specials (strawberry margaritas are only $2 also - a supreme favorite of ours). You can choose between beef brisket (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - who knew I would like barbeque sauce on a taco???), chipotle chicken, or carne asada (tex-mex. tex-mex. tex-mex. not REAL carne asada - so don't get your hopes up). Also an amazing deal. Since they're less busy on Thursdays, this isn't a bad gamble. Once we did have to sit without drinks for about 20 minutes, but I can let that slide. They're not getting a 5 star rating. 

I've eaten in the regular restaurant, and I wouldn't go back to this place if they didn't have the specials in the bar area. The food is overpriced and often bland, though I did get a salad once that I thought was tasty. The service is mediocre at best and for some reason they're super popular ""Guacamole Live"" appetizer (where they make it fresh tableside) has been ""unavailable"" both times I've eaten in the restaurant and wanted it. 

If you're looking for a cheap, satisfying dinner Tex-mex style, come here and sit in the bar for their specials. Otherwise, you might be disappointed.",UcR01xQcUpF0ZqkAvwO2Nw,0,0,3,hzRYYYOYa3idNFl5SJjukA

I love On the Border.  Usually when I have gone here in other states, I love it. Not this spot. I always love the salsa and get the XX fish tacos. 

First, the wait staff was not very good.  When our food came, we asked for more salsa. That never came.  So we asked another guy and he brought it.  

We ordered the queso and guacamole. The queso tastes like cheap velvetta cheese. The guacamole was ok, but too many onions for my taste.  The salsa was still pretty good. 

The fish tacos were just not that good.  Too much cabbage and veggies and not enough sauce. They were bland. The rice was very good, but the refried beans were not. 

The waiter did ask how the food was and I made a sour face and said, meh...it was ok. He talked right past it to go get our check. LOL!  Guess he really didn't care. 

The manager came by because I had a groupon and when he asked, I told him we wouldn't be back.  I told him what was wrong and he apologized and gave us an additional $10 off. 

So I will give 2 stars since the manager, rice and salsa were all good. :)

    My friend ordered their stacked nachos as her lunch ($11.99) and I ordered their carnitas chimichanga with red sauce ($10.99). We finished a bowl of their tortilla chips that came with their complimentary salsa and asked for another which we got no problem except they were a salt BOMB. Like, they were inedible.

    My chimichanga was pretty good, although very small and served with a huge chunk of raw jalapeno on top. For the price I definitely didn't get the bang for my buck. I then had a couple bites of my friend's nachos and again HUGE assault on my senses with all the salt. We thought that maybe it was the chips again, but after eating just the meat itself we figured out that this time it was the meat that was crazy over seasoned. It was so unpleasant that she didn't even finish them. As for our server, she started out pretty nice but after sitting there for a while her attitude seemed to change like we were more of a nuisance.

4623664,2014-10-03,1,vHt0CSynqesXox-9nBj7uA,"I've been wanting to go to an On The Border restaurant for the last year and a half. I know it sounds crazy, but I'm still on my quest to find a great taco Tuesday in Vegas. I have been subscribing to OTB's email newsletters for months now, and I finally made it out on taco Tuesday this week 9/30/2014

When we arrived in the cantina area all of the tables that were empty were completely filled be and sticky and gross. We set up the one with the least debris on it and my friend had to go and get some disinfecting  cleaning spray off of the server's station because no one came by to check on us.

I was dismayed when I ordered a margarita at, & I found out that it was pre made from a giant slushy like machine at 7 eleven. It was overly sweet, and it came in a mug instead of a margarita glass. Our server who is obviously over worked told us that we had to order the jumbo margarita in order to get in a margarita glass. Um ok, but who serves a margarita of any size in a beer mug with only 5 ice cubes? 

So I ordered another margarita with a ""floater"" of Cazadores tequila, but I never actually got to see the ""floater."" Apparently they do it all for you. No, thank you! 

So the margaritas suck. On to the food:

The chips and salsa were nice and fresh tasting. I order the guacamole which came on a plate that was formed by two ice cream scoops. 0 stars for presentation or even trying to make it look like they made it fresh sometime in the last day or two. It wasn't pretty.
Yes, it contains more onions than a normal guacamole, but I do love onions and the flavor was actually decent. Next, we ordered the empanadas with chicken. There wasn't much chicken and they were very very Fri fried, but whatever. That's all I have to say about those

On to the tacos. I ordered the grilled fish tacos which sounded delicious. They came out and lavish presentation with lots of cheese and lettuce and cabbage like I like. Unfortunately the fish was so salty that as soon as I took a bite my heart started hurting from the sodium intake. The corn tortillas were greasy. I asked our server -when I could finally find her again- if she could have them remake the tacos with less sodium.

Finally our server brought out some more tacos, and they were made ""without salt,"" but they still had a great flavor. I guess the grill was already salty enough from all the other overly salted tacos.

If the service would have been better, then I would have been able to overlook  the discrepancies with the food. Unfortunately. All of the servers were too busy and very inattentive. Our server especially acted as if we were a burden every time we asked for something.Thank goodness for the caring busser who finally brought us the water and napkins our server forgot.

At the end of our meal, instead of thanking us, our server told us to order the fish tacos ""without salt"" next time to save the hassle. How about I avoid your section next time instead? 

I'm so disappointed!  After a year and a half of anticipation this is what I get. I might go back and give them one more try only because I really love tacos and Tuesdays.",wDc4RxHpfwB49EpNZu1jfg,3,1,2,Tx3c7X-wLKwxTM3OKoqXXA

Finally seated, I inquired about a Margarita for Happy Hour and was told since I was in a booth, I would have to pay full price unless I wanted my entire party (me, hubs, 4 year old and 17 year old) to move to the bar! Total BS! We were literally the only people in the joint. You would think the goal would be repeat business or at least taking pride in their job. No such luck. Worst Margarita I've ever had and it made me sick for 2 days due to the rot gut Tequila, despite my request for top shelf alcohol.

I can best compare the quality of the tacos to that which you can find and make for yourself at a lower end casino buffet (think $10 station casinos or silver sevens). Tons of shredded lettuce, bagged cheese, very little meat, huge soft taco shell. Wasn't great.

We also got a half dozen wings to try since they were 35 cents at the time and they were the smallest wings I've ever eaten...typical buffalo with Frank's red hot /butter mix. I hope they don't serve these sized wings at regular times.

We also ordered a weak frozen margarita pitcher.

Service was actually pretty good and the fresh chips and salsa weren't bad. Was gonna shoot this one a 3-star but that ""A-Ok"" rating wouldn't be accurate.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,7,4,2,6hqoAX9E-6WameK4tjYZBw

Service, obviously, is not great. They will give you the chips and salsa, which is pretty hot, and one drink. Then they will make you wait, and eat your hot salsa.

When we walked in the door and asked about Happy Hour we were told it only applied to the bar and to a couple of tables in the vicinity of the bar. WTF!!!  The only table near the bar that met the Happy hour rules was one that had the high chairs. I'm short and overweight and can't get into those chairs so we had to sit at a table away from the bar and out of the Happy hour zone.   Luckily we had a true gentleman in our party (Thank you Rick) that went to the bar and got our drinks, twice.

I'm not even sure the table we sat at was even clean as the chairs were not pushed in and it made the table look a mess. 

That being said, the food wasn't bad. Average, non exceptional. It was meh!!  I don't think I'll go back just because of their stupid happy hour rules. There are other places that serve the same food without the happy hour restrictions.
