47058,2014-03-14,0,BQJokxJ4y4s57i7Mn65pvA,"We made reservations here since there was a lot of activity at the MGM Grand, as I am sure there always is.  We waited a few minutes to be seated in the bar area.  Was a little disappointed since we did make a reservation.  And being it was ""happy hour"" time, most of the patrons around us were ""happy hour"" partakers.  Our server was pleasant but the service was extremely slow.  We were almost done with our chips and salsa by the time he came over to take our order.  We knew we wanted to try the table side guacamole, so we ordered that and he ran away before asking or taking our drink order.  When he came back to take our drink order, he ran away again.  We were ready to order our entrees, but he literally could only take one order at a time.  

The table side guacamole was very good.  A good amount of avacodos, onion, cilantro, tomatoes and salt. We ordered margaritas, mine was a frozen, prickly pear, and raspberry margarita on the rocks.  Both were very refreshing.  Since we filled up on chips and salsa and guacomole, we shared fajitas.  We had a chicken and shrimp combo.  You have the choice of flour or corn shell tortillas.  We got flour tortillas, and there was three small ones.  The shrimp was very good, and had a mesquite seasoning.  The chicken had some pink spots on it which kind of concerned me.  

We needed to get to a show and was looking for our server to get the bill.  When he got to our table, we gave him a card, and he disappeared for a while.  When he finally came back he said the credit card machine was down so had to take a carbon copy of it.  However when I was walking out, I saw other peoples bills being delivered I saw their's were done the modern way.  I didn't have time to ask why my receipt was the old school kind. The next day we went down to the restaurant to ask if their machine went down last night, no one could give us a straight answer.  It was a little suspect if you ask me.  There are plenty better establishments to go to while in LV.",MEQAAU6FlZmqbAh1s54kRA,3,0,2,e21PluKMlHS66zIijelkXQ

I had put my bet in the sports book at the mgm so I thought I'd try this place. It wasn't too busy. So I walked up to the bar, but it seemed the heavy set white bartender was more interested helping the other white customers and completely ignored me. Maybe I didn't look rich enough. I ended up taking my buddies, one of who was being deployed that following week, and showed them a better time elsewhere. I will not be coming back here or gambling at the mgm casino altogether because of this experience. We don't make much money in the military, but we don't deserve to be treated like this.

Lot of sugar skulls and Dia de los Muertos paintings which I love. Ok the drinks, I would recommend the top shelf margarita. I did not have one but was able to taste the one my husband owned and had instant drink envy.  For dinner.. I started with the ahi tuna ceviche which was so good! Creamy and very fresh with great flavor. I could have had 2 more dishes. For the main course I had carnitas and mushrooms again great flavor and with a white cheese crumble and chunks of mango. At the end of the meal my sister mentioned that this was my birthday trip.... they brought out flan with a caramel sauce and what I think was some sort of roasted nuts in chocolate (and yes he got the table next to us to helps sing Happy Birthday to me). I was ready to fall over. The service was great which also added to the enjoyment of the meal.

327762,2016-06-02,0,BQJokxJ4y4s57i7Mn65pvA,"Limited menu. Bland and uninspired preparations. Massively overpriced given the lack of quality. They even charge $5 just for chips and salsa, and the salsa is basically blended tomatoes....and the basket of chips was basically the bottom of the drawer....all tiny broken pieces....and $5 for that?. The service is horrific. Extremely inattentive and slow, and one of the servers even had an attitude as if we were rudely interrupting their doing nothing in order to serve us....and it was a slow night.
The only positives were the hostesses, who are friendly, attentive and efficient and the drinks are well prepared....so maybe Hecho En Vegas would be best served closing the kitchen, getting rid of the wait staff and just becoming a bar with the hostesses......otherwise, if they couch it as a budget fast food restaurant, then maybe the poor quality would be acceptable at $4 - $5 a meal.

Our server was Daniel and pardon my French but he was a douche. He was not very informative about the menu and rolled his eyes at us quite a few times. His personality was just very rude. The only standout of this place was Eric who delivered our food and even came back to check on us even though he wasn't our server. He's the only one who seemed to care about our table.

All of our food was delicious! The taco salad was HUGE and also unlike anything I've seen before. The tortilla was very flight and flakey, yum, and it wasn't in a typical bowl shape...but instead more of like a giant taco shell!

We had reservations to Ka at 9:30 on Saturday and before the show we decided to stroll the MGM grand to find a nice place to eat. My date wanted some Margaritas and we saw this place so we decided to give it a shot. When we were seated the server came and gave s a menu and we couldn't believe the prices,  $14 for a taco salad with either shredded beef, shredded chicken, or pork. I asked the server how much would it cost to upgrade to carne asada and he said $6, so I told him that I would keep looking at the menu and he gave me a disgusted look, My date saw the prices on the tequila shot and they were ridiculous, I know shots can be pricey but this place was over the top we could of walked to the liquor store and bought a whole bottle of cabo wabo for the price of one shot of cabo wabo uno.  They gave us chips and salsa, the salsa was not bad but the chips were stale and hard, so far I was not impressed,  We settled for appetizers instead we ordered the chimi surprise which were 3 mini chimis which was ok, my date had the street tacos which were passable at best and for that it was nearly $30. I am used to authentic Mexican food and this place is not that, I would of been better off eating at Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, which can be pricey but at least the food would be worth it.

The manager and chef came out and told me they could oversee my meal prep and could give me celery sticks to dip into the salsa instead of chips.  Even though they offered to make my meal, we left because I did not trust the kitchen staff who may have cross contaminated, put food items that were not gf with the gf items.  What is the point of offering a gluten free menu if your staff is not educated on cross contamination??? Also, many bulk food suppliers offer gluten free chips, tortillas etc. if you are a Mexican restaurant offering gluten free all over your menu...why not order some gluten free items to serve to your celiac patrons?

1061444,2015-06-16,3,BQJokxJ4y4s57i7Mn65pvA,"My group of 6 recently had a late lunch/early dinner at Hecho en Vegas. It was an off-time so we walked right in and were seated at a high-top table. 

The service was prompt and on-top of our needs the entire time. As this was a pre-nap meal, the trip was food-only.

The complimentary chips and two salsas were delicious. The chips were crispy and the salsa verde had a great flavor. We ordered a side of guacamole for the table. They don't offer the tableside service that early in the day, but were able to offer a discounted pre-made guac. While not fresh, it was pretty good. 

While ordering my dos enchiladas I asked if they could be made extra spicy. While they could not, our server brought out this banging habanero puree. It didn't taste spicy at first but it had a really hot after taste. My non-spice loving friends hated it but as a spice lover, I couldn't have asked for anything more. It had flavor and hotness at the same time. 

My enchiladas came out with jalapenos on the top so did get that extra spice in addition to the habanero puree. I like the attention to detail my server had for my spice needs. 

The enchiladas themselves (one chicken, one cheese both with crème sauce) were good but fairly standard. The dish came with rice and refried beans. My friend's came with black beans. I wish we were given the option as I would have gone with black beans. 

There was a little confusion with the check. The dos enchiladas were $15 on the menu, however they charged $19 on the bill for the three orders for my table. They took it off the bill and blamed it on a glitch in the system. I wonder how often that's happened without anyone noticing. 

Overall, Hecho en Vegas provided for a relatively quick, inexpensive and tasty Vegas dining option. I'm not rushing back on my next trip to Vegas, but it's a good casual dining alternative if you happen to be nearby and hungry.",OLGQ7alK4VKl3YdQk6UF5g,5,4,3,9GSPADfwUeQCenhTlj5Djg

My how times have changed! We live in San Diego, so we have the authority to critique Mexican food. Diego's was grub, but Hecho took ten giant leaps towards ""On the Border"" status, yuck. 

We went to Hecho last night and ordered the following: $7 margarita, guac, wings, street tacos, and the tres carnes enchiladas. Pretty good happy hour deals. 

The drink was standard in quality, but was served in a pint glass (not used to that). The guac was not table side, but looked fresh. It was ok, big chunks of avocado. The strange thing was, it had this funky effervescence. Some strange tingly sensation! (Maybe something to keep the guac from going brown when they made it ahead of time?) still edible, just weird. The wings were really good, I would recommend them. Thank goodness we got them or my poor hubby would not have been satiated. The three tacos were also pretty standard - nothing great. The meat was sub-par but, again, edible. They could use a special sauce or salsa. The street tacos are a fairly small plate as they don't come with beans or rice, FYI. 

Finally, the tres carnes enchiladas - they were sad. The meats were carne asada (which tasted like jerky), shredded beef (which tasted like rope), and carnitas (which was actually really good!). The enchiladas were dry not only because the meat tasted like it was sitting in uncovered hotel pans for 16-18 hours but also because there was not enough sauce or cheese. For being one of the most hyped plates on the menu, it was just depressing. 

Let me say that I really like the new decor and remodel. But I wish they remodeled the place and not the menu. When my husband and I left, we discussed the changes & I asked him, ""Don't you feel like we just left On the Border?""  

This place may satisfy some people who don't know guac about quality Mexican food - but this place, in short, is NO BUENO.",0ljr1GZNT1j4wB9z_qyRaQ,1,1,2,ItHWIfg4pRVN65fYbmJCEg

The restaurant did not disappoint.  A reservation was made for 6pm, we arrived about 10 minutes early, were greeted by a very friendly hostess, and were immediately taken to a table.  As soon as we were seated, a very friendly woman named Veronica offered us water and menu suggestions.  She advised that Chris, our server would be with us shortly.  

When Chris arrived at the table, he offered suggestions for both our meals and beverages.  While we were deciding on our entrees, we ordered the chips and salsa appetizer that comes with guacamole made tableside. Daniel made the guac exactly as we asked and it was delicious. 

When Chris returned, we placed our orders.  We both chose Enchilada meals. The foods arrived very quickly and was presented beautifully.  The food was amazing!

The moment we walked in, we were impressed. From being greeted with a smile and seated immediately by the hostess, to the prompt attentive service of our server Chris and his assistant Veronica, and our guacamole maker Daniel this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in Vegas.

When we asked what kind of fish is in the tacos, he said ""fish"". We asked if the fish has scales, he replied, ""all fish have scales"". Eventually he told us the name of the fish and it is similar to shark...not fish nor has scales. We found this information on our own because he didn't think it was important.  We asked due to dietary restrictions that one of our guests had. We go to Vegas often but definitely will not go to this place.

Our server had a great sense of humor, checked in frequently, divided our check (for a large party), and delivered our orders quicker than expected. We were never lacking for chips and salsa. The manager stopped by and checked on us too. I loved the service and there is nothing that they could have done better.

The atmosphere at Hecho was vibrant, fun, and clean. There were many rooms and sections that provided various levels of privacy (or not). Our section felt mostly private. We could easily hear one another talk, but it wasn't SOOOO private that it was awkward. Spot on Hecho!

It's the food that really squashed my opinion of Hecho. I hardly ate my mushroom fajita and left hungry. This was the issue: the food flavor was enhanced with lots of salt or something. I tried to get the healthiest thing on the menu but I still felt as if I was doing my body a disservice. M felt the same way about her food.

I was also disappointed by the drinks. I love mixology, so the drinks at Hecho were too main stream for me. I would have liked a non-tequila cocktail OR even something with mezcal (a smokey kind of tequila).

If I were paying for service and setting, then Hecho fit the bill. But, to be honest, I was also wanting food.

Both my husband and I got enchiladas (I had beef with red sauce, and he had the three enchilada sampler). Meals came with refried beans and rice. It wasn't awful, it just didn't taste great. No seasoning, the meat was kind of tough, and it was just super bland. 

My husband ordered mezcal (they have about five different varieties on their drink menu), but the server was really confused about why he just wanted to drink it neat, and asked him a few times whether or not he meant ""mix it into a margarita."" No. So then they brought it out in a champagne flute, which was odd.

I got a drink (I think it was called Better than Bourbon). It was mezcal with lime, mint, and agave. All I could taste were the mint and agave. It was almost too sweet for me to even drink, and if there was actually alcohol in it, it was a minuscule amount. I couldn't taste any smoky mezcal in there at all, which was a disappointment. Not worth it for what they are charging. 

I've given two stars: one because they do have high chairs and are accommodating to little kids, and another because they do have gluten free options, and my husband didn't get sick from eating the food (he has Celiac disease).

I worked in a Mexican restaurant for 3 years, so I am pretty picky about my guac.  We asked for it to be on the mild side, and it was heavenly.  We split the steak fajitas (also amazing) and they gave us flour and corn tortillas since we preferred different types.  The steak was perfect, really juicy and tender.  

We had been thinking that the guac and fajitas may not be enough food, and we were planning on getting desert from the froyo place outside Hecho, but we were both so full that we didn't have room.

We always stay at the M GM.  While walking through their restaurant and food court area on the ground level, we noticed that the Mexican restaurant called Diego's was no longer there. In its place, was another Mexican restaurant called Hecho en Vegas. 

Now, usually when I see a restaurant replaced by a similar restaurant, it kind of is a turn off. It seems like they replaced apples with apples.  

We had been to the now defunct Diego's before, and it wasn't that great. It was overpriced, under portioned, and they never actually seemed to be open to serve their full menu. It was always happy hour appetizers pretty much every time we tried to go there.

We decided to give this new place a chance, hoping that it was completely different from the original Diego's.  Believe me, it definitely was. The service was excellent, our waitress knew the menu very well, and the food came out fairly quickly.

 Instantly, I noticed that this was not your traditional Mexican food. It wasn't super greasy, it wasn't super salty, and it wasn't heavy-handed with the seasoning. Everything was very delicate and almost seemed sort of like a Mexican version of fine dining cuisine.

We were pleasantly surprised. I got steak tacos with some side dishes, and the wife got a steak Mexican salad and also had some appetizers. Everything was fresh and tasty.

It was a bit on the pricey side, but that is pretty much what you can expect when you're eating in one of the major resorts on the strip. We felt that our food was so good that it was worth every penny.

First of all, the service was excellent the entire time! Our waiter was very friendly, fun, and on top of it. The manager also came over and introduced himself and he was very nice also...we even got a free beer when a table said they didn't want what they had ordered so our waiter just brought it to us LOL

We started with DRINKS! My husband and I each got large Coronaritas and they were delicious. I got mine watermelon flavored...yum! Definitely tasted the booze in them! Our friends got the fish bowl sized Mojito and it was huge and they loved it! We definitely had a good buzz going on when we left!

I ordered the fundido because I love cheese, simple as that! It was delicious! Some of the best I've had! 

My husband got the chimi changa that  had been all over the posters in the casino and he said it was definitely good enough to warrant the posters. I got the tri colored enchiladas. They were good, but not great. Our friends split the tamale sampler platter (and they loved it) and also go the mini chimi changa appetizer plate. They loved everything they got.

I was taken to the back left of the restaurant.  I really like the way the place has been changed.  The large room has been subdivided into several smaller areas that keep the noise to a minimum and also give you a feel of being in a smaller place than it is.

Complimentary chips and two salsas were brought.  The chips were nondescript and the salsas were OK.  The green tomatillo wasn't as flavorful as the red which also had some spiciness to it.

I started with pozole.  It was good tasting.  I was surprised that the corn had been not left whole but had been chopped.  I guess it's just their way but I hadn't seen pozole like this before.  There was a nice seasoning to the soup.

For the main course, I had pollo barracho, drunken chicken.  Along with the chicken were some mixed vegetables in a cream sauce and what I call and open face tamal.  The chicken was cooked and sliced and was served with a sauce that was more a tomatillo than a barracho.  There were no olives and there was no olive flavoring, something I expect with barracho.  The vegetables were good.  It was a mixture of carrot, corn, zucchini and tomato cubes  coated with a thick sauce.  I called it an open face tamal because the masa filling was placed on top of some fold corn husks and one didn't have to open the husks to get to the filling as you normally do.

Time for dessert and I got the raspberry tres leches.  The menu describes it as vanilla tres leche trifle with raspberry compote and a cinnamon sugar buñuelo (Mexican style).  The dessert was really good.  The trifle with the raspberry was great!

Service was good.  The pace was perfect.  There was ample time between courses.  I was never tapping my foot waiting for something to be brought, either.

I get that it's Vegas and EVERYTHING is expensive, I felt like the quality of the food did not match the price. 

For example we ordered chicken tacos which the meal comes with 2 tiny tacos & rice with veggies mixed in for $22 I believe. Usually authentic tacos are small but they pack flavor. These were kinda bland. My mom ordered a $26 taco salad. It had large chucks of meat that needed to be cut down into smaller pieces. Of course all they provided is a butter knife (which is difficult to cut meat let alone tender pork with). The waiter hardly came back, by time he did my mom didn't even want the dish anymore. 

I will give credit where credit is due! The table side fresh guacamole was great!!! The only thing worth it. They actually come over to your table and make the guacamole how you want it. You can choose your spice level. I probably won't go back but if I did this would be the only thing I order. 

The service wasn't that great for being an upscale type restaurant.

4173044,2014-01-13,0,BQJokxJ4y4s57i7Mn65pvA,"I heard about this restaurant when I was visiting friends in Tucson, Arizona where I dined at El Charro restaurant.  Tucson is the Mexican Food capitol of the United States and one of the best restaurants (and there are many) is El Charro! El Charro has been in business since 1922 and for good reason.  I was so excited to see an article posted on the wall saying they just opened up in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand but under the name of Hechos En Las Vegas! I told my kids, my brothers, my sister and we had a group of 14 people very excited to finally have good Mexican food in Las Vegas.  The servers were very nice and we were excited to tell them that we were originally from Tucson and looking forward to the food.  The first sign that things were not going to taste like El Charro was the chips and salsa.  This was definitely not El Charro's salsa.  It was thick and had a hint of ""tex-mex"" in the flavor.  Then we got our menu's.  This was definitely not the menu I was expecting.  I had even called the original El Charro in Tucson and asked if it was their recipes and menu... and they told me yes.  Well, it appears to me that the Las Vegas crew thought they knew better than a 92 year old restaurant and they changed everything.  Which is ironic since our waiter told us that he previously worked at another Mexican restaurant in MGM and they closed it down.  Duh!  It probably sucked and yet they had the same crew make a bunch of changes to this Mexican food concept.  Everyone in our party said that their food was very dry.  They hardly put any enchilada sauce on the food. And my enchilada plate had some kind of pickled cole slaw/cabbage thing on it (what?) along with very dry Spanish rice and black beans.  Black beans?  This plate should have had the amazing re-fried beans that you finish eating with chips at the end of your meal because you just can't leave a drop on your plate.  To add insult to injury, our bill was $465! We had very below average Mexican food at 4 start pricing.  The only thing that was good was the guacamole that they made table side. Everything else was a disgrace to the El Charro name - at least they didn't use the real name of the restaurant they were supposedly modeling after!  Unless someone from the real restaurant comes in and changes everything soon, I predict that this restaurant won't last very long.",gmsrNjMvC6V1JeY5UOHQaQ,0,0,1,6aWqs2HOk_Yqp-6-etJK1Q

We got our water, and placed our order for margaritas and table side guac from our perfectly friendly server, and both were good.
I had ""The one and only combination"", and my wife had the skirt steak fajitas, Very tasty for sure.

The restaurant itself is appealing aesthetically, with bright colors throughout the entire restaurant. The seating area also opens out into hotel and casino, which is very inviting to those who walk by. 

Their happy hour is fabulous! I believe it's Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 5p-7p at the bar. Everything is $5! Guacamole, draft beers, Carne Asada fries, margaritas, and more. They also offer complimentary chips with red and green salsa. I personally love their red salsa, it's FULL of garlic flavor!! I could easily eat a whole bowl myself. 

The staff here is great, the bartenders and bar backs are so friendly and make the bar atmosphere fun. We've had Cesar serve us at the bar several times and he is phenomenal. The restaurant managers Curtis and Fred are wonderful too, they walk around the restaurant floor, engaging with the guests. They always check up on us whenever we go! 

I've been here quite a few times, mostly for happy hour and a few times for dinner. Their taco salad is enormous!

We ordered the queso for starters.  It comes with flour tortillas but we requested they not bring them because that would be too filling.  The chips were ok and the green salsa that they bring out was so good!  I didn't care for the red salsa too much, as it had a roasted taste to it.

I ordered the street tacos for my meal.  I thought the pork was hands down the best one, and I do not eat pork.  So I probably wouldn't get this again.

Another night we were there, we had drinks at the bar.  It seems to me they have a different bar food menu, as there were fish tacos on the bar menu and I was annoyed because I would rather have had that than the stupid street tacos I had the day before.

The margaritas were good, but I can honestly say the food is just ok.  We both paid for it the next day, so I wouldn't eat here again.  LOL!

4702229,2014-06-17,1,BQJokxJ4y4s57i7Mn65pvA,"I made a reservation via OpenTable for my family to celebrate Father's Day and we were seated promptly. The restaurant is really nice with modern decor. Definitely suitable for special occasions and semi-casual affairs.

I had informed my family about their Happy Hour and we briefly perused the menu at the hostess stand. We requested these menus once seated, however, we were informed that the ""menu was basically all the appetizers, half off, except the Chicharrón."" That was satisfactory. Well, until I realized that I had researched these details the week prior and the other part of Happy Hour was $5 margaritas. No one told us this information, so it is possibly only offered at the bar?

Complimentary tortilla chips and salsas start your meal. The chips are seasoned nicely and the salsas (Rojo and Verde) are delicious (my favorite being the red, of course). We opted for the Tableside Guacamole ($10) made with avocado, freshly-squeezed lime, cilantro, serrano chili, onion, tomato, and sea salt. The guacamole-dedicated cart (adorable) rolls over to your table and asks how spicy (mild, medium, or spicy) you want your guacamole prior to its creation. This guacamole received my high stamp of approval! It was my mom's first time trying guacamole - I don't know what compelled her (although I like to think that my love for avocado was the influence) - and she loved it! We also started with the Short Rib Taquitos ($12): slow-cooked shredded beef, served with salsa verde, crema, and queso cotija. Crunchy tortillas and succulent meat. I'm not sure I would be able to identify the short rib without being told, but it was certainly more moist and soft than most beefs I've had in Hispanic cuisines. The taquitos lacked proper seasoning, but tasted really great with the table Salsa Rojo.

My mom ordered the MGM Grande Taco Salad ($14): Crispy flour tortilla, chopped romaine, refried beans, pico de gallo, black olives, tres quesos blend, avocado, chipotle ranch, and shredded beef (alternatives: chicken or carnitas). The shredded beef seemed like the Short Rib in the taquitos, although indicated differently on the menu. Either way, the salad was delicious! The flavors were wonderful together, the meat was so tender, and everything was so fresh. However, there was WAY too much cheese and as with all taco salads, too much fried tortilla (which I discarded without remorse). This was the best entree at the table.

Other entrees at the table included Tres Carnes Enchiladas ($20), Chicken Mole Enchiladas ($17), Mesquite Chicken Taco Platter ($17), Mesquite Chicken Burrito ($18), and Carne Asada and Applewood-Smoked Bacon Taco Platter ($18). I didn't try any of the enchiladas, but my brother noted that the meats were a little dry (except the shredded beef). The Hecho mole negro was flavorful, but a tad sweet for me. I'm usually a fan of mole, but this one didn't do it for me. I also had a bite of the Mesquite Chicken taco and I did not care for it. The breast was surprisingly moist, but lacked flavor. The Carne Asada tacos was my entree and I was displeased. The beef was dry, I couldn't taste the bacon, and it was weirdly sweet. It also had an abundance of non-spicy marinated red peppers (most likely bell) that proved an odd addition. I didn't eat the second one. The refried beans and rice served with most dishes were unimaginative and lacked great flavor. I didn't eat these items either.

My dad wanted a margarita, so I ordered him the Muy Picante ($14) made with Chipotle-infused Patrón Reposado Tequila, Patrón Citrónge, fresh lime juice, and agave nectar. It had a really great smokiness from the chipotle infusion and a nice balance of sweetness.

We shared Fried Ice Cream, Cinnamon Churros, and Raspberry Tres Leches ($7/each) for dessert. The corn-crusted dulce de leche ice cream had a Oaxacan chocolate ganache center and it was very tasty. The Tres Leches (Vanilla tres leches trifle with tart raspberry compote) didn't actually taste like ""Tres Leches"" usually does, but it was a decent dessert. The churros were pleasantly soft with the perfect crust. It also featured a cream center (could do without it) and served with Oaxacan chocolate ganache and Cajeta. Loved the Cajeta because it's not nearly as thick as caramel and not as sweet.

Service was wonderful. Our server was very friendly and extremely accommodating. I'm a little torn about the food since it wasn't really what I expected. It's supposed to be Sonoran style or inspired (New Mexico/Mexico border) and perhaps I'm not familiar with its flavors or maybe it's too Americanized. Overlooking authenticity, I wasn't pleased with the majority of main dishes based on preparation of meats and overall seasoning. However, I really enjoyed the salsas, guacamole, and short rib (or shredded beef). These strong areas are not quite enough to carry a restaurant, so I can't say I'm a fan. Also, prices seem a little high ($32/person), but the portions are generous.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,3,2,3,ivJpKZX8VWD8CdvCN7ONHw

My husband had the three enchiladas with different types of meats and sauces. I had the cheese enchiladas with red sauce, with refried beans and rice, upon recommendation of our server. It had a nice little kick to it, but not overly spicy. It was delicious! The server also gave me a mocktail (I'm pregnant) which was fresh and fruity. It tasted like a smoothie than a mocktail but I was happy regardless. Food and drinks came out quickly and they also had an excellent drink list. My husband had the herradura tequila, one of his favorites. Altogether, great service and great food.

Honestly, I've had much better Mexican food. This is basically a step up from El Segundo or some other Mexican chain. I tried the bacon wrapped shrimp, chips & guac & salsa, quesadillas, & soft tacos. Also, this used to be the old Diego but it looks like they took down a few walls on the outside to make the space appear more inviting and make it look larger. Diego seemed pretty closed off.

The reason for the 4-stars is because the service and servers were nothing short of awesome. Very personable, always coming around with food and drink refills.

We are from Texas so mexican food is pretty common for us at home and thought this would hit the spot.

First off, this place is REALLY loud. It's like a club more than a resteraunt. The front desk girl found us a table in the far corner where it was somewhat quiet though so that really helped. Very nice staff!

Right off the bat we knew we might not be completely happy. My wife asked if the shredded beef was barbacoa and the waiter who was Hispanic didn't act like he knew what barbacoa was. Then when we asked for a pina coloda we were told they didn't make those. My wife instead ordered a beerita and the waiter looked at her like she was crazy not realizing they are called that. They called it the ""there is a name for that"". When she got it the glass was so small that she couldnt flip the beer into it and still get a straw in so she drank the beer and maragarita seperatley. Not looking good so far!

We got chips and salsa and the green sauce was pretty good, red sauce tasted odd. Not bad, just odd. We also got table side guacamole and this is 90% of the reason for giving it as many stars as I did. It was awsome! 

My wife ordered the short rib tacos and I got the steak fajitas. I got flour tortillas with mine and hers came with corn tortillas. Both tortillas tasted bad and killed the taste of the meats. The fajitas were a bit bland but my wife said hers short rib tacos were pretty good after she ditched the tortillas. Beans and rice were average at best. 

To sum it up, if your looking for a place for beers and some pretty awsome dipping guacamole and dont mind ear numbing loud music then this place is pretty good. If you want a full dinner in a dinner environment and expect good mexican, go elsewhere. I'm pretty convinced that someone could make a killing in vegas with a authentic mexican resteraunt.",gUGWKcp7C9bcL7ipK80-3w,0,0,3,QDC0tkbPHeC8kGQ_HltARw

They actually comped the burrito after we told them it was made incorrectly (only to make sure we were charged for the lesser priced burrito), so kudos to them. Also, chips and salsa is $6.95. I would definitely upgrade to the guacamole because you get free salsa with that, and the salsa isn't that great. The chips were amazing though!

Our waiter was the epitome of a douche. Throughout our entire meal, he was rushing us and didn't bother to listen to what we had to say. For example, I asked which seasoning sauce he recommended out of the three choices I had for the enchiladas and he basically just mocked me for asking and didn't answer my question. WTF? He got lucky that there was an automatic gratuity (which is probably why he thought he could act this way) since I had a party of 6. Otherwise, I would've left him a $0.99 tip.

Anyway, we got free chips and salsa (two kinds - red and green) which were yummy. Then we ordered two orders of guacamole (mild and medium), which they make in front of you! I think it was only $10, which is a steal compared to DC prices when they make the guacamole in front of you. The medium was basically mild... No hint of spiciness at all.

Me and a friend split the ceviche. We got the one that included both types of ceviche. I hated one of them - ahi something. It had wasabi in it, but after long days and nights of drinking, it tasted like Jose Cuervo to me. Blech. I liked the other kind though! The traditional Limey one with shrimp, cukes, etc.

Everyone in my group seemed to enjoy their meal - they got steak fajitas, chicken fajitas, ahi ceviche, taco salad.

I got the beef enchiladas. They were just okay. The rice was the highlight of my dish, which in reality isn't even that good. I was just hungry :-)",AWhiw19dCygAJt0kGbU77w,1,0,2,pcDLVLKcWaC8H5zxsufomg

We were at MGM for the Justin Timberlake concert and were looking for a decent place to have dinner before the show.  Just about every other restaurant at MGM had about a 45 minute wait.  We didn't check the buffet or Rainforest Cafe, mainly because their buffet is terrible, and I'm not eating at Rainforest Cafe when I'm on vacation.

Anyway, we came upon Hecho en Vegas, which is located close to where you enter the arena.  My wife and I had just eaten Mexican at Javier's the day before, so we were a bit skeptical about eating it again.  But, it was either that or the food court, so we chose Hecho en Vegas.  They quoted us a wait time of about 20 minutes, but it was more like 10 minutes.  The restaurant is loud, fun, and vibrant.  I honestly had very low expectations going into dinner.  We were seated and were quickly given chips and salsa.  I thought they chips and salsa were good, but were certainly a cut below Javier's.  I preferred the green salsa to the red.

Our server was very friendly, and took the time to answer any questions we had about the menu.  For our meals, we each ordered two enchiladas, which came with rice and black beans.  I ordered one chicken with red sauce, and one cheese with a white cheese sauce.  I thought everything was really good, so I have to say that this place far exceeded my expectations.

They have red and green salsa and both have great flavor and a little kick. Table side guac is also available and they have a cart that does it so it comes quick. Chips are thicker and weren't my favorite but that's a small thing to the flavor of the dips.

Endless street tacos are interesting, but they are only 3 types and unsurprisingly small. 

Had the chile relleno special with a walnut sauce and pomegranate seeds. Fantastic, the quality of the ingredient were above average and it was well crafted and presented. 

I would come back here for dinner.",L0zkEpnjWdrZNBioJjzsjA,0,0,4,03ty0-_nmA1jOF7S88V9Xw

The restaurant is really large so even though they have a lot of staff they struggle to keep up with how big the place is.  On to what I consider much more important the food: We got the tableside guacamole which was really good.  The salsas weren't to my friends liking so they made a special really hot salsa that was what my friends wanted.  For entrees we got the steak fajitas which was above average, carnitas chimichanga which was huge and tasted like a barbeque pork chimichanga which my friend liked and the tamale trio which looked good.

The price of My soup and a cheese dip could have fed a family of 4 in Mexico! The soup was cold, had to ask them to bring it back which they returned it 15 minutes later with wilted taco pieces in it, the cheese dip I ordered wasn't melted very much then they claimed they had no frozen drinks, what Mexican restaurant on the strip claims their frozen machine is broken? I thought they made their Margarita's by scratch not by a pre-making machine, then I asked for a mojito when I saw it on someone else's table to get it with no sweetener in it which I returned, not even a tiny bit of mint in it. The total cost for the soup and cheese dip and a glass of tap water was $34.00. Really was the worst food I ever ate. The Strip is bad news if they offer these kind of overpriced tourist traps. Oh and the server never showed up at my table for about 12 minutes. Will never go back again!!!",lCOtFdT0yaJPMpoAaPLQFA,0,0,1,q52vXZ5V7J4y6yx-S2Omdg

Ordered and enchilada and a fajita.  The wait for the food took a long time. Pretty much finished all their nachos waiting for the food. When the food did arrive the food quality was average. Definitely I had better Mexican food than what they served. Without even tasting the fajitas visually the veggies were over cooked.

The atmosphere is vibrant but classy...televisions are available if that's your desire, but there are also quieter areas of the restaurant if you want to get away. 

The food is outstanding....I would describe it as a perfect blend of authentic Mexican with an American touch. Everything on the menu was unique in its own way. The desserts were just as good as the entrees. 

The service matched the food...our server was attentive but not overwhelming.

Hecho in Vegas did not disappoint. More like hecho in Mexico.
Hecho is in the MGM Grand. Lots of contemporary Mexican art to be admired while you enjoy your meal.
Allow me to get to the food!

BURRITOS: Very large. Enough for two meals. Ingredients are notably fresh and flavors on point. Not over done or too spicey. Subtle undertones. 

ENCHILADAS: Chicken, beef or cheese or  pork. I had cheese. The sauce is delicious with a blend of cheeses. 

MOJITOS: I highly recommend

TEQUILA: Hecho has a long list if you're a TEQUILA lover. Speciality tequilas, old tequilas, tequila with a dead worm..lol

DIABLO ROJO: Tequila with pomegranate liquor and lime juice. The bomb. Its sooo good.

List of Mexican Wine. One of few places 
with Mexican wines.",P1JqTh13dpAZ16U1ZPw_IA,6,5,5,fMulKfJVN-qA0r7dLFQwhA
