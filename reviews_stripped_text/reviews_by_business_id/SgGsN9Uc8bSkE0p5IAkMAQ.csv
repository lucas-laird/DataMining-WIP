285087,2015-07-13,0,SgGsN9Uc8bSkE0p5IAkMAQ,"The line for this subway was astronomical. Literally, out the food court into the main hallway.  They worked pretty quickly though getting everyone their order. 

It was great to eat at a known restaurant and not get gauged. The prices in Vegas can be high, especially with all the 30$ buffets.  My girlfriend and I don't gamble so buying a few drinks throughout the night can really add up. 

This subway was consistent with most others. Food portions were what I have come to expect from this chain.

I would recommend coming on off times to avoid the lines. But, recommend overall.",3SIe4Wj_ANjsXmliD3OhxQ,0,0,4,v_3g3G1N63JThWFvqEc_8Q
637530,2014-11-10,0,SgGsN9Uc8bSkE0p5IAkMAQ,"Went to subways today 11-10-14 to buy four subways.  A kid was helping us then a white guy came over to help him.  Without asking us what we were having (because there was different breads there), the man assumed he knew what the subway on that bread would be.  My husband corrected him and he just seemed so irritated.  He roughly snatched the cold cuts and threw it on the other subway.  He kept shoving our  4 subways around (roughly) as the other 2 workers were trying to complete them and as he was trying to make other customers subways.  I've never had such rude service and I regret not walking out the store.  The store was previously owned by a Filipino (or Asian) family that always gave EXCELLENT customer service.  These owners hire people who do not want to work here.  We were not rude in anyway except I started getting very annoyed at how rude this man was which put me in a bad mood.  I told my husband NEVER again will we give this shop any business and it's the reason we had not been there for a while.  It's just shocking that you do the shop a favor by giving them a business (4 subways) and they treat you like crap because of that.",w-zi0RgOysq_xNrQQUGGeA,0,0,1,tT3A0wBumyfcVCCi2xPCsA

Stop right there.Quick, yes.Cheap, yes, but not in the way you think.Cheap quality food and service.5 dollar footlong doesn't exist here, it's more like 9 bucks.I had to remind the sandwich ""artist"" to put gloves on, the bread tasted like it had been made weeks ago.Save your money and go for the 2 dollar footlong hotdogs next door.",b4aIMeXOx4cn3bjtdIOo6Q,0,0,1,pCuBq07BgwQtvOCbQpPT6g

I get that the veggies will be limp from sitting out all day.  I know that the employees will be about as friendly as zombies having had to work a soul sucking job all day.  

What i don't expect, understand, get or know is coming....a crampy food poisoned stomach from the moldy tomatoes you put on my sandwich (and much to my chagrin I discovered halfway into eating the darn thing.)  This is a subway to beat them all.",fTqd3X1Ogdy6xoZR33ycww,0,0,1,OS1BdU2QhgfBopxbO5icag

The mcdonalds right next door has regular mcdonalds prices so go there instead of this subway location. $13 for a Foot long sandwich is stupid, doesn't matter if it is on strip Fast food prices should always remain Fast food prices.",hn8mOELJXX_2C72q9O1_sQ,0,0,1,NCNlxbuFhA0__QcGvPyTgA

The employees who helped me did not have very seasoned customer service skills, but I think some are struggling to learn English. And my infested brain forgot most of my Spanish, so I couldn't help them, either. I paid $9 for a turkey salad that was fine, but I couldn't help wondering who was making all the money on the backs of the well-meaning employees and starving customers.",pf7HvMm9JGUWTVUT21nw2Q,3,2,3,ce8VgVD1a9sibMT5Yon2tQ

So when I asked for manager, she just pointed at him and I had to flag him down.

Not to mention I was standing there to order at the counter and the total jerk of a guy looked passed me and asked my husband what he wanted to order!  My hubby, being a gentlemen let me order first, but it was really rude!  I was standing there and he totally ignored me.  What a @#$!

we were shocked to pay over $20 for 2 sandwiches (saw the news recently and sure this would not have been more than 10 inches)
