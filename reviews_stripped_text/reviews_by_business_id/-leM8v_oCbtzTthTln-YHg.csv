91340,2016-03-03,0,-leM8v_oCbtzTthTln-YHg,Will not go here ever again and my family of 4 went between us 9 times a week. The manager did not get back with me after 2 wrong orders and he promised he would. SHAME of him. The workers are nice at this location. I know mistakes are made. He could of fixed it and blew me off.,UlYYmCBz4x_VtEv3NpEFeA,0,0,1,N5NJ7_BNYhWvKxSwqbtwqA

I pull up to Carl's Jr. this morning expecting to be greeted by a menu chock full of delicous, biscuity breakfast goods.  No dice.

I told them I hated them and drove off, vowing never to return again.

And I still haven't gotten my fast food buttermilk biscuit fix in Vegas.",ScAkGG5VXHNpnMYsGtaadg,0,0,1,d4ezS-yw_SWaoI2VVRMjaw

Demanded a refund and the shift leader had the nerve to get all kinds of attitude and even flipped me off when I told her how her acting super ratchet was a terrible example for her team. Mind you, I've been eating here since I was a kid and NEVER had a problem. There should always be a manager present if you hire a bunch of dumb, immature kids.

So I went to the closest food place which happened to be this Carl's Jr/ Green Burrito. Anyway, I go into the restaurant and their only like 3-4 people in the restaurant, and they all just look ""shady"". But when ""nature calls"" you try to look past that. So, I go to the restrooms, and the entire restroom is empty, and I handled my buisness. I heard someone come in, and I opened the door to go wash my hands, and I swear there was a kid who looked 6 or 7 years old, and she turned around and looked right at me and she looked normal except she had an eyepatch that looked like it was made out of metal. I thought I was in ""Children of the Korn"". Anyway, this review is not about the food, and I will never eat at this Carl's Jr, because of this experience.",jPDf-2aTnIPm8jDMJ4I8MA,0,1,1,213bRlz3b7fhmgZ9LgS9Kw

This location is unique as it has a Green Burrito in it too so you can get a taco salad some burittos or whatever floats your boat.

4409627,2009-09-22,3,-leM8v_oCbtzTthTln-YHg,"Nice! 

this was the first Carl's Jr. I discovered Green Burrito. Strange name, but they were pretty decent for fast food. Years later, I read Morgan Spurlock's book, he's known for doing Supersize me. In Don't Eat this Book, he writes about the connection of Green Burrito to Carl's as an attempt by Carl himself to revitalize the chain. And apparently Carl was fired from his own chain but since rehired? 

There is some dark history with me and this location, but it had nothing to do with Carl's. I had a motorcycle accident out front one night. Actually, I had a protected left turn (left onto Maryland north), and someone approaching at excessive speed from the opposite direction BARRELLED thru their red light to make a swerving right turn- right on my path. So I veered left and slammed into that island in front of the Carl's. 

also, in the area was the first (ghetto) apartment I had when I moved to Vegas, so I have been going to this location since moving here in 1999. The Ghetto apartment has since been refurbished somewhat as a Siegel Suite.

Carl's is one of maybe 3 national chains I go to for one reason: The Big Carl. Right up against McDonald's mystery mad cow beef, the Big Carl is a larger burger for cheaper. Folks, there is NO reason to go to McDonald's since the McD brothers sold to Krok.  They put unsanitary barfed and peed on playgrounds and make happy little sweatshop imported toys so that your kids will nag you to go. 

So go to Carl's!",zulBnf95Ji1_LAcQKyhi8w,2,4,4,2cyxZ-oUZoYz90g3JMOGxQ

He's not funny, if you're reading this and you're the one who makes that decision, I know you're laughing at this and thinking you're hilarious, but you're not. You're a dick. A big fat dick. You could be a chick and you'd still be a dick. Every time... I can hear the other English sparking people talking to him trying to give an English lesson while also cooking the food, and I know you're still laughing, but you're not funny Dick. You're just a Dick, and guess what Dick, I hope you love being assistant manager because dicks like you stay assistant manager for a very long time, maybe even forever. So enjoy your laugh barely above minimum wage assistant manager chick who's also a dick because chances are you'll be laughing at this one for years to come. Aim high and remember to keep laughing when Mr ESL keeps kicking ass and learns how to do everything to become manager then hires all his friends and family and you become the one with the funny accent in your own neighborhood. Keep laughing it up, funny ass dick because that's what's funny about what you're doing when you say ""here ya go"" then go and giggle your ass off until it's time for you to go home.

4460099,2015-10-17,0,-leM8v_oCbtzTthTln-YHg,I liked being greeted as i entered the restaurant. The cashier was attentive and stopped what she was doing to service us. I had the taco salad and it was well worth the price paid. 5.99 but enough to feed the wife and I.  I was feeling nostalgic so I got a bean and cheese burrito. The size of that for the 1.69 price didn't match.  I did like that they had a salsa bar so that made up for it. Location was at the corner of Dessert In and Maryland. I guess they have problems with shady people coming in because they had to kick out a couple of people all in an hours time.,sYSRSJVuZcLEM-_kQfIRNw,0,0,3,aJFKWeiNOsmrW-5H9AHKMA
