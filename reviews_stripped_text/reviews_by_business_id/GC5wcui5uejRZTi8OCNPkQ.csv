Can you tell I am not a fan? 

My guy and I went here last night around 7pm.. We were told that there was a 40 minute wait..I walked around the restaurant and it was about 1/4 full.. It is a huge place , and there was about 10 tables with customers, the rest were empty, clean, and waiting for someone to sit in. Seriously, why am I waiting 40 minutes ? 

40 minutes come and go and we come back , now there is about 2 parties in the dining room and we are still waiting to be sat, finally I give the hostess an evil glare and we are sat. Right next to the kitchen. there is about 50 empty tables and we are sitting right next to the kitchen ?! really?   So then we sit , and sit, and sit.. My boyfriend says we will give them 5 more minutes and then we will leave. 4 minutes in and our waiter shows up looking like he has been working his butt off , I look around wondering why he looks so overwhelmed,  There are a dozen servers and now about 5 tables being occupied.. This guy is a mess, he can't look us in the eye, takes out drink orders and runs off without taking our food orders..Which we obviously were ready to give seeing how we sat there for 15 minutes before a server even approached our table. He then scurries around randomly ,  we just watch him..another 8 minutes go by and we see him walk in our direction stop , look at us, realization that he never gave us our beers dawns on his face and he runs back towards the bar. This pretty much goes on like this all night. It took us about 45 minutes to get out check at the end. Now , my guy and I have both been servers, so we always tip 20%  ... it pained me to even tip him at all. He did nothing . other people brought us our food and cleared our dishes..he never checked on us,never  refilled our drinks, never asked if we wanted another beer, or even dessert..which I was dying to try the bananas.. but couldn't even order them because he NEVER came back. WTF.   Just looked at my receipt..The server is named Ruben ..

The food was complete garbage. $10 for a tiny bowl of mediocre guacamole with NO chips ! Our entrees which were grossly overpriced were as bland as taco bell.    Do yourself  a favor and NEVER go here.",FIP2UfF716BLq9i00pS_Cg,6,2,1,v-P4V-ijyqmnjZqaZ5AuOw

The atmosphere was very nice, but the food was very poor as was the service.
The comb fajitas was 2 small pieces of each item with ice cold rice. At $18 a plate.
Our other two entrees came with rice also ice cold. The waiter made a comment that we should have said something about  the rice right away. But he was not around to complain. They did keep our water glass full because the bus boy was doing his job. Now I will be fare, I did order the Red Snapper and it was perfect.
We don't mind spending money on our dinners while on vacation, and we do spend a lot, but we will not return back to this restaraunt because they had both bad food and service with an attitude.

The 3 salsas that came out with the chips were good, even the one that burned my mouth. 

I had the chicken chimichanga with red sauce on top. It was well prepared and a perfect size. Came with a side of rice and a small dish of beans, that weren't too shabby. 

I thought the prices were OK, maybe a little on the high side, but being that it is in a casino, it was tolerable.

327890,2012-10-14,0,GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ,"This is a beautiful restaurant.  Too bad the management has let a good place slip down so far.  We have been eating here for several years.  When it first opened the service was good and the food was excellent.  It then transitioned to a place where the food was still excellent but the service diminished, but we would put up with the poor service because the food was so good.

Prior to this dinner on 10/12/12 we had eating there in August and the food was still very good.  Something happened between then and now and the food was just as bad as the service.

You are served three salsas with chips and all three were pretty awful.  It almost seemed like they had added sugar to all three. Pretty horrid.

Ordered nachos that were left in the broiler  too long and were burned on the edges. That wasn't the worst part however.  There seemed to be what might have been hormel chili con carne slathering about.  Pretty terrible nachos, which honestly, is not the hardest food to prepare.

We ordered rock shrimp enchiladas which were at the top of the price list. Instead of rock shrimp the enchilada was filled with bay shrimp, I kid you not. 

It seems more and more the restaurants in casinos are skimping quality hoping you don't notice. That recipe is not one that will keep a loyal clientele, which might explain why at 8:00 PM on Friday night the restaurant was no more than 1/3 full.",zUftxbDN37tL_ghulwdwFA,2,0,2,PI-GUQlyEK3XYiwzEfmqag

We also ordered the $35 Cadillac Margarita pitcher and got about 6 drinks out of it, which was a good deal, except, we weren't offered our tequila of choice,  As a result I think it was a cheap tequila, resulting in a gross 6 drinks.

The ambiance is very nice - kind of a Mexican village at night. Its festive but not gaudy like a lot of Mexican restaurants. We loved the overall décor!

The next surprise was the incredible service!  Celina was our waitress and she was great!  Super attentive and very knowledgeable about the food. 

Next surprise was the price - very reasonable for Vegas.  Combined with the happy hour which stretches until 7:00pm, the prices were even better.  Our beers ended up being $2.50 each.  A full 3 taco carne asada plate with rice and beans was $13.  

They have a full menu - tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, carne asada, etc.

Based on the prices, I expected the food to be mediocre, but it was delicious!!  The chips are served with 3 kinds of salsa (all tasty), and the chips were very thick and fresh tasting.  We later learned they are baked and not deep fried.  Next, we tried the avocado fries.  Yep, a sliced avocado battered and fried with a ranch chile dipping sauce.  So tasty and so unique!!

The entrees were just as good as the appetizers.  And while most Mexican restaurant refried beans are forgettable, these were absolutely not.  Very fresh tasting and I believe they are made on site each day.

Overall the food was easily as good as some of the best Mexican I've had, and when the price is considered it was an incredible value!

We had 4 beers, the full order of avocado fries, chips/salsa, and two entrees for $52.  I paid with a smile and will refer anyone looking for good Mexican to Mi Casa Grill Cantina.

Tonight my fiancé and I wanted to have a nice night out and decided to go to Mi Casa. We ordered the shrimp enchiladas however we were told they only had seafood enchiladas tonight, which we didn't mind. The seafood enchiladas were delicious until I took the last bite of my rice and felt a piece of hair in my mouth! I immediately had to spit the rice into my napkin and discovered there was a hair cooked INTO  my rice! Disgusting! We let the waiter know what happened and he immediately got the manager. As if the random hair in my mouth wasn't  bad enough, the manager GINA was so insincere. monotone, and sarcastic. I told her, ""look, we love this restraint and eat here all the time. The manager then told me with an attitude, ""I don't see how that could happen all the chefs are men and wear hats"" then she proceeded to eyeball my hair. (My hair is extremely light golden brown color and the hair in my rice was black)  She was judging us as if we did this on purpose to get a free dinner. Then I explained ""look it's not about the bill we can pay for the bill"". Then she repeated 3 times ""so what do you want to do? "" and then ""are you drinking? Oh you have drinks. Do you want me to take off the drinks or what do you want?!"" She is the manager and she should be smart enough to know what to do in that situation! I told her forget refunding the drinks I specifically don't want to pay for my meal. She said ""ok"", turned around and walked away. Unbelievable! At that point I wasn't mad about the hair in my food anymore. I was upset because she judged me and my fiancé, I could see the look on her face that said they are just trying to get a free meal liars, probably don't have money. So offensive. Will NEVER eat there again. Loved the atmosphere, food and wait staff. The judgmental manager disgusted me more than the hair in the food.

Now for the cons. Our server was very nice but seemed to be overwhelmed. My friends and I had asked for certain ingredients to be removed, certain type of liquor for our cocktails, etc. and he completely forgot. He also seemed to never come back to our table unless we asked one of assistant servers for another drink or water. When we were finished with our meal, he asked if we wanted dessert and we said yes. At that, this would be an up-sell for the restaurant. Again, totally forgot to bring a menu over and disregarded to come back and check on us to ask for the bill. It seemed the other tables around us were being served properly...except for us.

Now for the food. The first batch of tortilla chips were awful. All broken pieces and tasted like they were sitting out for a few days. When we asked for another basket of chips (to the assistant server), they tasted even worse and completely stale. For my entree, I ordered the Chicken & Steak Fajitas. Meat was cooked well and veggies were done nicely. It could have used a bit more flavor as well. The refried beans were a bit under warm and the ""spanish rice"" was dry. 

Overall, I will not be coming back. There are so many better options to choose, including El Dorado; Bandito's, etc. Take this recommendation and move on to the next choice on your list.",o_87PGSRVpYrFj_0_zv4GA,1,0,2,c1hjrI_dLqQZM1-4WDTxUQ

1436586,2013-03-03,5,GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ,"Well...
We used to come here frequently... But we will not go back :( and here is why :(

It was the day before National Margarita day and I thought it was Margarita day. 
I wanted to get a special sugar skull tequila bottle the one that they posted on their FB page.

We were seated after the hostess took our last name, why I'm not sure the place was empty. We were dining early at about 5pm.

The server after about 20 minutes came to our table and took our drink orders a draft beer and a margarita and two waters. I joyfully mentioned the National Margarita thing and he said ""YES IT IS!"" no mention of the promo...and then he left the table...no eye contact the whole time...hmmm...oh well. (really the whole time NMD was really the next day, come to find out, I misread the FB post)

Soooooo....after about 25 minutes he finally came back with our drinks and no waters. I asked him for the waters and he said ""I'll be right back."" Again no waters until the bus boy brought them for us.

Soo the whole time we knew what we wanted to order. Just combo Fajitas. That's it. I eat the grilled veggies and hubby fixes them the regular way. We eventually got to order with him and he seemed annoyed. 

An hour later...yes an hour later...hubby was getting hungry and I suddently noticed the table who sat down at the same time as us were getting their check. And also the fact of the FOUR tables who sat down after us already had their food. Ummm...

Our server was no where to be seen. My drink was gone and he had never checked on us. So I flagged down another busser and asked for a manager. Then our server comes flying to our table. I started to ask him to check on our food and HE ROLLED HIS EYES AT ME AND WALKED OFF TO THE KITCHEN. 
He eventually comes back and says the manager is coming.

The female manager said there was an issue and they are making our food. Twenty seconds later it comes out in to go boxes................telling her my hubby already left and does not want the food she said ""I just had them re-fire it and it's ready to go.""

SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?!? I asked her if she really thinks I believe its not the same original food and that we were afraid of some weird sabotage at this point. (since the server was soo rude) She said things like that WOULD NEVER happen there and yes they did remake it.....ummmmmm they remade Fajitas in 30 seconds.....did they come from the microwave?

Whatever, I wanted out of there. I did not get either of their names because they never introduced themselves nor offered to make it right. She did comp our drinks but that's not the point. I offered SEVERAL times to just pay for them and not to take the ""to go"" order. Why would they think we wanted it to go?

Anyway..Silverton...It's close to us and we have NEVER had an issue at Twin Creeks dining...as for Mi Casa...honestly we will never be back. 

I really hope the GM reads this and asks his female sup or manager that was working why she may or may not have axed the rude server...horrible and sad.",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,9,1,1,_Nk0VjOzSTceYz88VqzH5Q

Besides, we had a perfectly good Groupon to use :) the restaurant has great ambiance and is tucked back from the slot machine casino action, which is nice.  Here's what we thought of the food:

Chips and salsa: YUM! The trio of salsas were good and we devoured the chips, and our server brought another basket of them without us having to ask.
Appetizer -- Queso Fundido: NOT what I was expecting.  Agave in Summerlin has this killer queso that's bubbling hot in a baby skillet from the oven, and that's what I was expecting here.  Instead, we got a bowl of warm cheese dip that tasted OK, but was basically a fancier version of the fake nacho cheese you'd get at a baseball stadium.  I was not impressed.
Entree -- Chicken Fajitas for 2: A sizzling platter loaded with seasoned chicken and veggies, and we each had our own plate of toppings, flour tortillas, beans and rice to make our fajitas with.  This was really tasty, and for $18 a pretty good deal.  
Dessert: We got the featured dessert which isn't normally on the menu, a deep-fried banana-filled tortilla covered in sugar, chocolate and raspberry sauce and with vanilla ice cream.  Presentation was beautiful and it tasted great! 

Overall I think the rest of the food made up for the disappointing queso dip, which is why I'm still giving this place 4 stars.  Our bill came up to $32, which seems very reasonable considering we got a ton of food.  If you like Mexican, give this place a shot :)",AylVoBstCLobpop4QkgGzQ,2,0,4,cFA-w4iKKOtEvMNjkABsUA

The food was good and if it wasn't for the service, I would say I would be back.The service was really the reason I gave this place 3 stars. It was extremely slow and there weren't many people there.

They were all different levels of filled and spilled all around the sides and even had a piece of broken chip in the mild and when we confronted the server, he brought the manager Gina over who had major attitude and wasn't helpful at all, she gave us zero piece of mind by just saying that the salsa was just ""spilled along the sides"" on the walk over.. that would be a whole lot of salsa on the ground and there was none, and why would there be a piece of broken tortilla chip in the salsa? Not only were we served used salsa, it took 45 minutes for us to get our food (IT WAS 1 PM THEY WERE NOT BUSY IN THE LEAST) and we had to ask for refills when he brought the food because he never came back to check on us. After we were finished (not that any of us ate our food out of fear), he took our plates and it took him another 10-15 minutes to return and we had to ASK for our check and then we waited another 10 minutes before going up and asking another server to please take our check. The manager tried to stop us on the way out by offering a free dessert but we were too scared to even eat our entree after the salsa mishap so we declined her offer.

We ate there last night and was pleasantly surprised.  In the three weeks since we were last there, they've changed their menu and gotten a new chef.  The changes were instantly noticeable from the time the hostess sat us.  

Changes:
1. Hostess was friendly and had a smile on her face.  Not sure if it's the same one who has seated us before, but I never really notice the 'sour puss' people I come across.  When she sat us, she made sure we all had everything we needed - menus, silver, water glasses, etc.

2.  Salsa was amazing!  They obviously changed their medium salsa because it has never been as yummy as it was before. I didn't try the hot or the green so can't comment on it.  I ate waaayyyy too many chips this time because I couldn't get enough of the salsa.

3.  Service was perfect!  Waiter instantly at our table, water glasses filled, drink order returned promptly - granted two of us drank water and the other ordered a coke.  We placed our order:  Chicken enchiladas and Beef Fajitas for two.  Both arrived in less than 15 minutes and place was packed.

4.  I cannot attest for the Chicken enchiladas, but he downed them quickly, so I can only assume they were good.  The Fajitas were amazing!  Before they were way overcooked and came with some weird orange glaze on them.  The veggies would be so charred that they had lost all flavor.  This time, they came out a perfect medium and veggies so fresh and cooked perfectly that we ate the whole thing!  This is the first time we didn't have leftovers to take home.

I don't know who the new chef is, but he/she made this a place we will consider as a first choice for dinner as opposed to a 'can't come up with anything better and we are already here' choice.",nTGPIseYL1KiIpi7ZelVNQ,2,3,4,FDU_H12JSXy-dl0FfZQi6Q

The good-Their chips always come out hot and fresh. They are served with a selection of salsa and refried beans. They keep them topped off even when your kids eat their way through 8 bowls. My kids would never do that, I'm just saying..........IF that ever happened they would keep them topped off. None of their salsa is very spicy. Maybe it is toned down for the tourists. I wish it had more heat, though. What does have heat and is also extremely good are the chicken tinga tacos. I'm  not a huge fan of hard shell tacos. These are the exception. They were killer and super spicy. MMMM

The less good-Their other food has been hit or miss depending on when we have been there. The Chile Verde has been great at times and not great other times. It's mostly due to the quality of the pork and how well the fat has been removed. I will say, they have offered other dishes when there were issues with the pork. The kids meals are on the expensive side for the portion sizes, but pretty good. Their nachos are good, not great. Their sopes were also good, not great. They ended up being a little soggy the last time we were there.

Lastly their service has always been really, really good. This goes a long way in my book. 

If you are at the casino and want Mexican food this is a good choice, but I would eat at other places first based on quality if you have other options.",4P1Z7pUGC8aQjNRImEXiqw,0,0,3,RycBavJP0wfSU2QdSlSOQA

She seated a 2 top and then a single. Over 10 minutes just to be seated. Once seated, the bus boy came over with the chips and salsa. I asked for another mild salsa and he said he would be right back. He never came back. The waiter came over and took our drink order and again I asked for a mild salsa. He brought drinks, no salsa. By then it did not matter as the others finished the chips. He finally comes back to take our food order and after ordering I asked for the salsa again and a bigger glass as mine sat empty. He said he was ""not that busy"" so he will just keep filling it up...I said the bus boy was terrible as he never brought salsa or even looked our way to refill the drinks. So the salsa finally comes and he sees my glass is empty again. He fills that and then we do not see him for about 15 minutes or better. We were wondering what was happening because everyone around us had gotten their food and they came after us. The food runner finally came but only had 2 of the 4 meals..... Our server was nowhere to be seen. By the time he showed back up, the people who had their meals delivered, were completely finished. We asked where our food was??? He said he would check. After a few minutes, he came back and said ""your food was in the window except for the wings"", and dropped off the Taco plate to me. He left to find the wings. I sat there and looked at the plate he presented me! It had to be in the window for OVER 25 minutes! And it looked like it! How do you bring a plate that has sat that long? Tacos were soggy and disgusting. Lettuce was completely cooked as was the Pico. The sour cream melted all over. By now we are wondering if there is ever going to be a manager who makes the rounds? After a few more minutes, he comes and places the wings down. The look terrible like they were steamed with hot sauce thrown on them.... We give back the Taco plate and just ask for another corn if it does not take long. After we see him a few times he says he told the kitchen he wants the corn now, not later.  5-6 minutes later, he brought the corn and refilled the iced tea. Surely after all that went on, a manager would at least come over to our table???..... Nope, he told us he took the Taco plate off and here is your bill. It left us to wonder if there was any management present at all? I usually love this place and have been here several times with no issues, but today was just terrible. Seating. Service.

This is not a place to go out of your way to eat brunch at. But the waiters were all very friendly, the prices were reasonable, and the food was good. 

If you're staying at the Silverton, I'd recommend it for easy, decently priced food. I'd also recommend it if you're looking for bottomless drinks for a good price. However, if you're not in the vicinity, you can find better brunch/bottomless drinks elsewhere in Vegas.

The service was also slow on a not-so-busy morning; we ultimately flagged down multiple people who were not our waiter for almost everything: order drinks, food, the check, etc. So keep that in mind if you have somewhere to be.

That means I'm intimately familiar with the coffee shop, but haven't spent much time in their other restaurants. I've been to the buffet a few times, along with the new Twin Creeks, but hadn't had the chance to make it to Mi Casa until last week. I had a $30 comp that was expiring soon, so I figured I'd stop after work, and have a steak at Twin Creeks. Well, I totally forgot that they are dark Mondays. I had been eying the chicken mole at Mi Casa for a while, wondering how it would stack up to my precious Papalote, so I figured what the hell, let's give it a run.

The *extremely hot* hostess sat me at a semi-booth near the front of the restaurant, but I felt that I was still very comfortably isolated from the casino. They have a nice entryway set up with a lot of big plants that do a pretty admirable job of not making it seem like you're not 15 feet away from the casino floor (but it's still there if you look). Decor was pretty nice, and in my opinion, classier than similarly priced mexican places. My waitress, who reminded me of a less-cordial version of Lurch, eventually dropped off the oft-mentioned tortilla chips & salsa and took my order, which consisted of beef flautas ($7-8) (sp?) and the chicken mole ($18). Chips & salsa turned out to be good, and I ate them throughout the meal - even desert. The flautas came out, but I quickly deduced that they were chicken, and not beef. I tried for a while to get Lurch's attention so that I could send them back, but when the futility of that became evident, I just decided to eat them anyway. They weren't bad, but definitely seemed on par to something I could pick up in the freezer aisle. After that, the very nice serving girl brought out the chicken mole. It seemed like a nice presentation, but ultimately the dish turned out to be just ""alright"". The chicken was cut into slices, and was OK at best, quality wise. The mole was not very chocolaty, and the cheese was very sparingly applied. As I was eating though, I did notice that the dishes were very cool, so a plus for that, I guess. Post-mole, Lurch came by and gave a cursory ask if I wanted desert, and seemed surprised when I took her up on it. I ended up with the fried ice cream ($6?), which was passable.

Overall, had I been paying cash for this meal, I would've thought it was a bit overpriced. That's not to say that it was expensive, but I'm just not sure if I would've been happy paying for what I received. I saw nothing to explain why the mole was so expensive, and the appetizer portion was not very large. High points include the chips, the plates, and the frequent, but mysterious trips the hostess made past my table. Food was decent. This review seems more negative now than I believe I felt when I was eating the meal, so it could just be that the food quality was overshadowed by the lack of server quality I experienced. I would go back again, but only because I pay for my food at the craps table and not the dinner table. 2.5 stars, rounded up for the hostess.",21KWy-JENq6xVEly5xki0A,1,0,3,C20s3ZRrO-G4qIOYalUXTQ

I usually ordered the 3 items entree, cuz I love sampling a varieties of food..hehe
 
The burritos are not bad at all, but the most popular is their fajitas.. I always see people order them.
 Skip their street tacos, it's not that good!! And kinda expensive for each, I rather buy them at a food truck (cheaper and tastier)

My friend and I wondered here this past weekend in the hopes of getting some decent margaritas. we were so wrong. we were seated by a girl who didn't seem to like her job. pretty bland. it was whatever. we looked over our menus and the margaritas looked pretty good so we ordered one each at $7 dollars a glass. I asked for a not so sweet and sour one, but a stronger one with more flavor so the waitress recommended one to me. While she put that order in my friend and I decided to share some basic beef taquitos for 8 dollars. She dropped off some free chips and salsa which were nothing too impressive. the 3 choices of salsa all tasted the same pretty much and were bland. so sad. Our drinks came over and I took one sip and already felt sick from all the sweet and sour. It tasted like a virgin drink. I'm sorry...I'm 27...don't you remember checking my ID while I asked for something of the opposite? I did not say bring me a virgin margarita. open your ears. My friend was not impressed either with his frozen margarita which tasted like frozen lemon water. UGH what is this place?! our taquitos came over and they looked like they were from the freezer isle at target. believe me when I say there was no beef whatsoever in this little things. there were 3 of them and they were the size of my boney little pinky finger. $8 dollars for what?! OMG. unimpressed. When the waitress came over to ask how our drinks were I told her mine was too sweet and I didn't like it as I moved it to the side for her to take away after one sip. obviously she didn't get the hint as she watched me and walked away. umm alright. she brought our check over and I noticed our drinks were $8 dollars while on the menu they were $7 dollars so I decided to ask her about this. She said they charge an extra dollar for the alcohol. nowhere on that menu did it say they were going to charge more money for a drink that already has alcohol in it. WTF! yes...I understand it is only an extra dollar per drink but it is the point of telling your customers about this before they order. I didn't even drink my margarita because it was disgusting and wanted you to take it away but instead you decide you want to charge me more for it?! not to mention your food sucked and was such a disappointment. I left this place so angry and upset over this. The waitress offered no help and it was obvious she wanted us out of there.
I'm apparently still very angry over this about half a week later. I will make sure none of my friends and family ever go to this place. I really hope they do not stay around too long and are replaced by something better. I am so let down with mi casa's food and service.",UYoakf0Mnpa3-eQUasnJEw,10,1,1,Ir8dtysKDqR6D-wW7LmnIQ

3219442,2016-10-08,2,GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ,"Pretty disappointed with this visit.  I have hosted a work party at this place before and we were happy on that night, but this time I came with my family.  My 6 kids and my parents, so between us there is 10 of us.   It bothers me when I go to a restaurant and they tell you they are going to automatically add a tip on the bill for parties of 8 or more.  My family is large, but I am not a group of teenagers, or a group of drinking 20 somethings.  We are a FAMILY.   We were told by the host when we checked in that they required a mandatory 18% tip be added to the bill.  I immediately said I don't want to be required to have a tip added automatically.  She said, well it is our policy.  I said, please bring the manager over then.  Unfortunately, that meant that we had to wait, instead of being seated.  So, we sat for 15+ minutes waiting and then they didn't even bring the manager or even address the concern, they just came over and said, ok, ill seat you.   After I was seated, the manager came over and he was friendly.  he didn't get the RIGHT story, so I clarified to him what our concern was.  He seemed very nice and said, ""No problem"",  we will make sure you are not charge the tip automatically.  And what I said to him was... we always tip well for good service, many times over 18%, but I don't want to be forced to tip before getting service simply because I have a large family.    He pointed out that he will have the female manager check on us, because he had to step out and he assigned a waitress to our table.  
   We went on with our meal.   Now, I don't know if the waitress made up her mind to not give us good service because there was no guaranteed tip, but that is what happened.  We just got terrible service.  When she WAS at our table, she was very nice and personable, but getting her to our table was impossible  We ordered drinks and literally sat for 25 minutes before she even took our order.   My father was so annoyed he was going to just go get someone else.
   The food was ok.  But it was not till after we went home that we realized that they charged us for EVERY side we asked for... including Pico De Gallo.  and extra soft tortillas.   Now, we ordered a fair amount of food, to be charged for a small Pico is silly, but even worse is the tortilla.  If I knew when they serve a bowl of Queso for an app, they would only give you TWO small tortillas, I would never have ordered it.  When we asked for more, we were charged.  Stupid.  And my mother who got Fajitas only got 3 soft tortillas for her huge order of Fajitas.  You couldn't even fit the about of meat and vegis on 5 tortillas, so there is nowhere near enough.  I can understand only giving someone 3 to start, so you don't waste them, but to charge when they ask for more...that is just greedy.  
    My father who paid the bill, still gave the waitress a 20% tip, even though she didn't even come close to deserving it.  He did it simply because of the hoopla about us not wanting to pay a required tip up front and didn't want it to seem that we didn't because we wanted to be cheap.
   We simply wanted to pay a tip based on the service we got, not based on the amount of people we have.
   Unfortunately, I don't think I can go back here just because of how poorly they handled simple tasks.   I gave them a 2 instead of a 1, because what food we did get was not terrible, it was just everything else that sucked and I was frustrated to pay anything frankly.  if I was paying the bill, I would have given the waitress 12% based on the quality of service.",pBhaCEcdbdDv76kMwm8Nng,2,0,2,1EjzjYyE2UBv7StfPKz91Q

3248242,2011-09-16,0,GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ,"Judging by the mixed reviews for Mi Casa, I think your experience here might largely depend on what you order.

The first time I visited I ordered poorly and the whole experience was rather meh. Then, a year or so ago we got hold of a groupon and tried again. Ever since I have been eager to head over to the Silverton for some cheap, tasty Mexican fare. The sort of stuff I want to eat when I don't feel like anything lavish like Border Grill.

Now, I won't lie, Mi Casa eternally disappoints me in that they don't really do a big plate of nachos that you can, not only enjoy in the restaurant, but graze off in leftover form for days afterward. This instantly derails my standard order, so what I like to do here is mix it up with an order of grilled Sonoran corn, which is delicious, followed by chicken fajitas and maybe round it off by sharing a fried ice cream. I also once sampled the chicken wings here and found them to be huge, crispy, and excellent.

The real surprise here is the fajitas. Fajitas are usually pretty hit and miss for me. They always -look- fun, but the reality is often some overcooked, rubbery meat among a sea of limp, oily, tasteless vegetables, served with dry tortillas. That's not the case here. I can't believe I'm going to say it, but these are the best fajitas I have ever tasted. The meat is prepared with love, sliced AFTER grilling so it's not all dry, and the vegetables are chunky with a nice sear - not too oily. On top of all that they serve it with some sort of amazing sauce drizzled over the top.

Over the past year or so my Mexican standards have risen. Placed I used to rave about like Coyote's on Sunset and Guadalajara at Sunset Station now seem pretty lowbrow and mediocre (except for the salsa bar at Guad - that's worth the price of the meal on its own). Mi Casa, though, if I order right, is a surprisingly excellent Mexican offering at a more than decent price. If you've been here and been less than blown away, it might benefit you if you gave it another shot one day - maybe if you're in the area and can't decide what to eat. Order something different - maybe the fajitas - and see if, like me, your experience here can be amazing if you hit the bullseyes on the menu.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,3,1,4,bNohlH9lcRCAvzOVtFSt2w

I went here with a group of about nine people, and even though six of the nine people were present, they didn't seat us until everyone was present.  Hmm, ok.  This was on a quiet Monday evening.

We're seated and I will give credit to the server as she was very pleasant and attentive.  There was rarely a time a beverage glass was empty. 

The food leaves a lot to be desired.  I had the carne asada taco plate with a side of guacamole.  It was as if nothing had any seasoning.

We also got the chicken burrito which I thought was okay. It didn't really do anything for me. It was just shredded chicken.

The Carnitas burrito was a better choice. It had the right flavor and it's filling.

The chicken enchilada was okay. There was nothing special to it.

All the meals came with beans, salsa, sour cream, and rice. The rice is really good. It wasn't soggy and it had a lot of flavor.

The only reason we gave this place a chance is because the San Gennaro feast was cancelled due to rain (LAME!). Anyway, this became our choice of eats. They serve complimentary chips and 3 types of salsa. One salsa was tomatillo, one spicy, one mild. The mild was good but I wondered if it can from a can, rather than fresh. The other 2 seemed fresher. We ordered the queso fonduto for an appetizer. WOW! Very good. A bit spicy but very tasty. I really enjoyed that. I got the veggie fajitas for 1 (2 wraps) and my friend got the cheese enchiladas. The fajita presentation was beautiful. Sliced yellow squash, zucchini (both with nice grill marks), tomatoes and corn served over peppers and onions. It had a spicy sauce, not a lot at all, just a touch for flavor and color. So good. Came with the usual sides; rice and beans, guac, pico and sour cream. The cheese enchiladas were VERY good too. I usually dont like enchiladas because I dont like the sauce they drown it in. Since my friend wanted to try both the red and green, the sauces were on the side. Sweeeet! The service was great. Friendly waiter, hostess always making sure we had water. Food portions were quite large in my opinion. $10 for my veggie fajitas and I didnt finish it. $10 for the enchiladas, which my friend didn't finish and $7 for the fonduito. Not bad AT ALL. We were both majorly stuffed and she got to take home some leftovers! Good food, good service and pretty damn good prices = Happy Vanessa & Molly!",8OeTLey-p-WaL9ErNEci1Q,1,2,4,fv7AhgJxb1fzld0sXPhEJg
3517671,2010-07-19,0,GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ,"Three years ago I thought this was one of the best Mexican places around. They had a large menu, quality food and excellent service. Since then, it's gone downhill. The menu is much smaller, the service is spotty and the food, while still good, isn't quite what it used to be. It may not be authentic Mexican -- it is after all in a casino full of gringos -- but it's still a solid choice to get some Mexican grub. The chimichangas are large and stuffed like Oprah wearing spandex. The carnitas chimichanga is much better than the chicken. The pork (on a good day) has that tender, succulent pulled-pork quality to it, although on occasion it can be a little dry. The enchiladas are also worth getting as they don't over-sauce them like so many other places. Their rice is also some of the better spanish rice I've had around here. It's not that mushy, inedible pile that can be found elsewhere. Compared to other casino restaurants their prices are good, with many dishes around $10-15.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,0,0,3,nDAu1ax4hhKaGg8rjO5jLA

Brunch is served Saturdays and Sundays 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.  There are nine brunch choices on the menu.  They are priced reasonably with nothing above $12 but I found the choices very limiting.  It's pretty much egg, cheese and bean based.  I mean where's the beef or chicken?  A couple of the choices did have Chorizo but three of us ordered the Mexican Breakfast skillet and were left wondering if there was actually any chorizo in it.  You can make your brunch bottomless for $13.  There is absolutely nothing special about this brunch and unless you are staying at the Silverton and don't have access to a car there are better options.  On top of that the service, if you want to call it that, was not very good.  Being that this was an event, so they knew how many brunch tickets were sold in advance, they definitely were not staffed for it.

3592616,2011-07-12,2,GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ,"One word could describe this whole place - Why?

Why did the owner decide to open a restaurant?
Why did the chef decide he/she knew anything about cooking?
Why is the Silverton the only casino in town who is getting no applications for its open positions? (ok, well that one's a no brainer).

It took only one bite, although I am often a fool and will continue to eat more despite what my taste buds are screaming at me.

My meal was simple - Chicken Tortilla Soup - how can you mess that up?

Well let me tell you, Mi Casa messed it up with flare and extravagance.

After tax, the so-called bowl of so-called soup was the better part of $9.00. But it was far from a bowl and its only resemblance to soup was the way it dripped off my spoon. Oh, and a bowl is a bowl - not a cup.

Here's a bit of advice for the chef - Chicken Tortilla soup is not a beef broth base, and certainly not a broth made from beef bouillon cubes.

The soup was so harsh (let me emphasize harsh here), it almost made both me and my dinner companion gag with disgust.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,6,0,1,mFSd9251iaFsxCpeEXjKbQ

I didn't order a starter because I knew I'd eat enough in chips and salsas to make up for that.  My server, Celina, was at my table quickly to take my iced tea order and it was quickly brought.  It was also refilled without asking several times during dinner.

I ordered the carne asada with it cooked rare.  When the meal came, I was stunned at the size of it.  There were refried beans, rice, grilled peppers and onions, sour cream, guacamole, and pico, tortillas, and a large amount of perfectly cooked rare steak.  On the back of the platter was a whole Mexican street corn cob.

The beans and rice were standard.  The street corn was good but the star of the show was the carne asada.  The meat was rare and tender and I enjoyed it very much.

I had so much to eat I was rethinking my need to get dessert.  Well, that thought went by the wayside quickly.  I ordered coconut flan.  This was the only let down of the menu.  The flan was a little heavier and not as soft as one normally gets.  Also, I could only discern a small coconut flavor in the flan itself.  The coconut flavor came from the coconut spread on the dish.  The caramel topping was just overwhelming.  It detracted and overpowered the flan rather than adding to the flavor.  It was also a reason why the coconut in the flan just didn't come through.

Service was very good between Celina and a runner who was there with iced tea and ready to be of help.

First off, the space is huge. The decor is beautiful and the atmosphere is fantastic, but the cavernous space is so big that most of it goes to waste (I've never ONCE seen any activity in the open tortilla kitchen; the place just gave up on making fresh tortillas. Sad). They always clam to have a 'wait' even if only a few tables are full. I think this is a casino ploy / policy so you'll drop some money in the slots while you wait. 

Don't plan to have a quick meal here because the service is notoriously atrociously slow. I'm talking waiting 15 minutes to be acknowledged, not getting refills on your drinks, and sitting around for 20 minutes after repeatedly asking for the check. This is, sadly, the norm at Mi Casa. I don't know if they don't have enough servers or what, but I've never had good service at this restaurant (and I've been dining here since they first opened)! 

The food can be hit or miss. As with most casino restaurants, the food is really overpriced. Expect to pay $15 - $18 for mediocre fajitas with tiny portion sizes. I've had good meals here and I've had awful meals here. The kitchen does appetizers well so you can't really go wrong with the queso, avocado fries (one of my favorite menu items), chips with salsa, or simple fare like cheese quesadillas.

The food was OK, nothing crazy good to me. The popular appetizer right now is deep fried avocado and they have it. I thought the Avocado came in a tie with the grilled shrimp as for the best things we ate. We tried the Steak and shrimp with cilantro rice and grilled tomatoes. The cilantro rice had maybe a hint of something but was very bland to me. The grilled tomatoes had no taste - even a splash of lemon juice or a pinch of salt before they grilled it would've helped taste wise. 
The waiter had a whole speech as to how their steak was excellent and it was the same steak as in the expensive steak house (I forgot the name) in the Silverton. So we were sold but the steak wasn't tender and I had to ask for sauce to deep it in for taste.
The shrimp had a yummy sauce on it.......
My brother really enjoyed his steak salad in a taco shell and my kid's cheese quesadilla was passable as well.....
The service was slow....too slow....the waiter at some point did come up to me and said that because I wanted my steak well done it would take longer which is fine to me but bring out all the other stuff like the kid's meals and the easy salad!!!! So even with all that it must be known that we were only the 3rd table with people in there so the extra slow service was just weird to me....
My main problem was with the young lady who was the greeter at the front. It was a Sunday afternoon on Father's day and her demenor was just awful. She hardly cracked a smile and she had ""I hate my job"" written all over her face!!!! I watched her with each customer that she brought to their table and each time it was just so unfriendly, so unwelcoming. I told our waiter what I felt and I hoped that he passed along the right channels because there are so many people right now that so badly need and want a job and that would appreciate one. So it just sickens me to see public service employees act like that.

Oh and as we were leaveing she didn't even look at as and then as we were going to turn a corner we heard in a very low monotone voice just like in a weird freaky movie ""Thankyou, have a nice day"" My Mother looked at me and said how nice she was thanking our backs.....",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,2,1,2,Q9Fe8ILogcL1qlADJ_ur_g

I liked the chips and salsa display that was placed on my table, but none of the 3 salsas were hot.  I understand not all guest like authentic hot salsa, but at least have 2 out of 3 spicy.  Green chili dip was good, but no heat.  Salsa = spicy.  I'm just sayin'.  It needs some new salsas.

My combination plate was OK.  Fish taco with a beef enchilada. Taco was good and refreshing not getting a fried fish stick in a tortilla like at a lot of restaurants.  A good amount of fish and once you add Tapitio,  it gave it a nice flavor.  The beef burrito was OK, but not muy buena.  Just average.  The service was fine and my waitress was very nice.   I love the Silverton because it's close to my 2nd home and it is one of the best local's casinos in my opinion ( other is Red Rocks)   The buffet at the Silverton rocks and I was really surprised by Mi Casa.  From the outside you'd think the food must be outstanding.   It could be with the right changes.   3.5 Stars.",_PcyxpbkS507OjTxwItkXg,0,0,3,U_z4EFIjojy2iJ9rVL1h4Q

We ordered a few minutes later and the food arrived in what felt like not even ten minutes... and it was good! At this point, I think our bartender had become the other guy on duty, not sure - they both refused to make eye contact with us. I get it, you're tired and want to go home by the end of the night. We've all worked the industry, you put on a fake smile and at least try to rush us out. Not the case here. I watched the two argue over who's table was sitting behind us while we sat there for a whole 20 minutes, empty plates, empty drinks. It was clear that we were finished. Eventually, we caved and asked the guy for our bill. Needless to say, I'd never go back to the bar there.",_OwDe9EPXjy0AzDzb1IFrQ,0,0,2,nxe5OdqAtJZTYg2nntSxNA

It's not super fancy, but one of the best Mexican restaurants here in Las Vegas.  When you sit down, they bring their 3 salsas and chips - we added their bean dip as our appetizer - LOVE IT!!

The steak was very tasty along with all the accoutrements...but what absolutely MADE the meal, for me, was the street corn...char-grilled, covered in cheese and seasoning...every bite was so delicious!!  I would go back again and again just for the corn!!  
the downside - chronically understaffed, so guests have to wait 10 - 15 - 20 minutes or more while there are empty tables because there aren't enough servers scheduled.

We attempted to make happy hour which is from 4-7 everyday. I ordered the house margarita at 6:53, the waitress than informed me happy hour was over. I was upset due to the fact I waited 40 minutes for a dirty table now bad service?
we argued about the time and she then stated that if I wasn't willing to pay the full price for the margarita she would bring out waters instead? WATERS?
I asked if there  was a manager I could speak to, and she told me Gina. Which I then inquired about speaking with her. She scurried away I assume to locate the manager. When the waitress came back 10 minutes later she exclaimed she was unable to locate a manager. WHAT IS THAT ABOUT? 
My husband and grand baby decided to get up and leave at this point. No service from a ""manager"" no drinks, and no food. Extremely dispointed we love gambling at silverton and hope the place isn't going under due to unequipped so called managers.

Decided to stop in with my gf  because I didnt want to sit down for a steak at Twin Creeks, but wanted something a little less greasy than Johnny Rockets. Mexican? Im in!! Heres my dinner date.

Ordered drinks and apps. Was told one of the apps was not available as per the chef (queso dip). No biggie, Ill have something else (shrimp cocktail). Enjoying our drinks, and Queso dip comes out....huh?? Also, the tortilla soup that my gf ordered comes out. No joke, the tortilla soup looks like apple sauce....what the hell is this? I LOVE tortilla soup...order it everywhere I go. This was NOT tortilla soup. Shit was a disaster. Queso dip looks thrown together and is so thick. It almost seemed like frozen cheeze whiz reheated. Absolutely repulsive. Still, Im cool calm and collected, and just wait for  my server to come over and send it back. Where on earth is my shrimp cocktail?? I offered to pay for everything, because I hate making a scene. The server was great and of course says not to worry about it, and both the soup and cheeze whiz will be removed from the check. In open view, she speaks to the manager on duty whos office is in full view of the table Im sitting at, literally, right across from me. I watch him get up, comp the items off our check and walk away. I wanted to thank him for the gesture, but he didnt even give me the time of day? Whatever, not a problem, still just hanging out drinking, enjoying the scenery. WHERE IS MY SHRIMP COCKTAIL??!!? Im confused at this point.  After ordering our entrees, the shrimp cocktail comes out. It was delicious. I could have eaten two orders. The waitress comes over, asks if everything is ok. I told her everything was fine, and that I wish I could have thanked the manager for comping our food, even though he didnt have to do that (despite the fact that he obviously did the right thing.) She just kind of smiled and left. LOl WTF. Maybe its just me, but I would have gotten that lazy manager off his chair to touch the table that clearly has been dissapointed with the quality of food. Again, no biggie, but now its clear to me why this place isnt more popular. The check comes....it was about $67 or so. i left a $20 tip, and thanked the waitress.

I didn't have anything to drink from the bar, but I heard the drinks were good and strong. 

For appetizers we had taquitos and empanadas. I love fried food so I was hoping that this would be good. The taquitos were crunchy and had a good flavor to them. I enjoyed these a lot with guacamole. The chicken empanadas weren't so good. The chicken was really mushy and it was filled with this weird tasting sauce. I didn't know empanadas were supposed to be wet inside. 

For the main course we had beef fajitas. This was actually pretty good. The meat was tender and had a good amount of spice, but not burn your mouth hot. Their tortillas were warm and soft. I think I ate 3 of them. The rice and beans were typical, but edible. The steamed vegetables were way over cooked and reminded me of baby food. 

I was really excited for dessert since I have a huge sweet tooth. When they brought out the churros, that was the highlight of my meal. These were solid churros! Deep fried, sugary goodness. 

Overall, this was better than I had expected. I don't know if I would come here again on my own, but I wouldn't be opposed if someone else picked this spot.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,2,2,3,ZEVe2CSP3k0ei9x8jZb3EQ

To get thing started, are hostess was a doll. She offered us a seat on the floor until I saw the booths, and asked for one of those instead. She didn't bat an eye, and led us to a booth. 

The drink service was prompt, and our waiter, Luis, was no non-sense. P.S. I LOVE the waitstaff attire here: they have cowboy-esque black colored shirts with pearl buttons and skull and rose embroidery. A very nice touch.

We ordered the ""Bloody Maria"" (a bloody Mary with tequila) and a house margarita (the special was a margarita with 3 street tacos). There was plenty of alcohol in the drinks and they used special care mixing the ingredients. Bloody Mary was nice n spicy! Just how I like it. 

Two of us ordered the Santa Rosa salad with chicken. HOLY COW WHAT A SALAD: black beans, big chunks of mango, lots of avocado, pan fried corn, grilled chicken, finely shredded carrots, and nicely shredded lettuce. The salad is tossed, so every bite is super flavorful. It's also super deceiving: the bowl looks small, but good luck finishing it. This salad is filling!!!!! Seriously, one of the best salads I've ever had!

The service was prompt and attentive. Luis came by a couple times to check on us, but didn't linger. Water glasses were filled and the check was brought quickly. 

Also, I totally love the ambiance in here. Lots of low lighting, leather bound menus, wood finishes on everything, etc. Very romantic!

The ONLY criticism I have: the music playing through the restaurant was totally random. They were playing top 40 radio hits. It was out of place. This place is so cool and unique, I think they could find some more complimentary music to go with the setting and food.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,0,0,5,C4pASqcBw1JGfyOdaw1Khg
4429312,2012-10-17,0,GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ,"I keep coming back to Mi Casa time and time again, and I always walk away conflicted. This place has so many bad aspects, but yet so many great ones as well.

Service in the bar area is downright terrible. It's as if Mi Casa only hires bartenders and cocktail servers with below average time management skills. This is especially obvious during happy hour when you can almost see the shock on the bartenders' faces when the foot traffic starts to pick up. Mi Casa has amazing margaritas and great prices on those margaritas. The trick is simply getting one in your hands. It's going to take a while. Especially during happy hour. This applies to the servers in the bar area as well. Once you actually get one to wait on you I would recommend ordering multiple drinks. I have no doubt you'll be pleased with the quality of your beverage, but you never know when you'll be getting another. The servers always seem more overwhelmed than the bartenders do. 

Being sat in the dining room always confuses me as well. You could walk up to the hostess and you can literally count maybe 4 or 5 tables of patrons, however the hostless always says the wait will be between 20-45 minutes. I don't understand how this can be on a Monday evening when it's obvious they're not busy. Is there only one line cook working? Is there only one waitress on staff?

I've been coming to Mi Casa for years, and the examples above aren't based on one time experiences. That being said you might wonder why I keep coming back. The answer is simple: the food is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The burritos are a can't miss, the enchiladas are wonderful, and the trio of salsas they give you with their chips are unbelievable.

I wasn't surprised at all when I saw the average review is 3-stars, which is a shame because this place has 5-star potential if they would only up their service a bit.",VGuKmjxmYi8BXqPj_r9tbg,3,0,3,f0N1CkHnL8wOgJFj8a7WqA

I think its the fact that it is usually not busy compared to buffet, where-if you are patient, you can score a great deal.

 Like other reviewers have said, the chips and salsa are very good, but most other items are average. The fajitas are a good deal if you split them, but they will only bring you about 2-3 corn tortillas per order. The service has been slow most times and I think it is a bit pricey but prices are on par with most casino restaurants.

A couple of high points; the decor is awesome-it really reminded me of Pueblo Bonito resorts in Mexico (trust me, it's cool), and the mole. Mole is hit and miss, and Mi Casa's is a hit for sure.

Ruben was our waiter, very fast, polite, checked on us throughout the meal. Water was always filled promptly. We had a gift certificate from a Yelp nonprofit event a couple months ago so we decided to check the place out. 

Complimentary chips and three salsas were good. Not hot but at least they were flavorful. I thought the green avocado salsa was interesting. 

The food came out at lightening speed. My friend ordered the steak fajitas and she was very pleased with her entree. Came with a lot of meat seared and served hot, with onions and bell peppers. 

I went for the combination of one grilled fish taco (delicious) and one cheese enchilada (meh). I should have ordered two fish tacos, ah well. The enchilada was just not that great, the cheese in the middle was not even melted. I am very particular about enchilada sauce as I make my own but this seemed to come from a can. Eh. Just ok.

For the main entree, the wife and I both ordered the Shrimp & Crab Enchiladas. I liked it - it had the right amount of spiciness from the poblano chilies, but mi esposa thought it was a little too salty. For dessert, order the Helado Frito (fried ice cream).

4974815,2007-12-22,0,GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ,"Having dinner out on a Thursday evening, it was slow over at Mi Casa Grill Cantina.  The hostess almost  took us all around before seating us in the corner of  this huge dining area that was nicely decorated and had a lot of promise.  We were seated in front of a giant screen TV showing Thursday night football.

After our beverage orders were taken, chips and three salsas arrived at our table.  There was one limed based tamarind sauce that the BF was practically drinking, while I had an affinity to the spicy red pepper color one.  We were very impressed already and couldn't wait for our orders!

After deciding on the manaza $7 (apple rum, lime juice, and mint) for myself and the caprinha $8 for the BF, we realized our waiter was very new - at his job and at this restaurant.  It humored us nonetheless as he had trouble understanding and pronouncing our drink orders.  (The BF's caprinha was a bit too strong for his liking and my manzana was pretty much an apple mojito.  It was a lot tastier than his drink, that's for sure!)  

We decided to ask for his recommendation on food items since they had an extensive list.  He gave us some ideas on whether to order tapas or go straight for the main courses or do the mix and match.  

We decided to try out a bunch of different things by going for the Appetizer Sampler ($17) and the Mix and Match entrees of three items ($17).  We had the waiter bring out all the food together so we can enjoy it all at the same time.

The food was rather quick to come and just as well since we had already finished off a basket of chips.

The appetizer sampler came with two corn cakes that were sauced up and topped with guacamole.  The BF thought the cakes were pretty decent.   Two chicken(?) flauntas also came with the sampler.  I found it to be dried out and tasteless.  The adobo seasoned deep fried calamari was left in the oil too long, and the BF couldn't taste any of the seasonings.  These items were laid out on a bed of coleslaw and came with three dipping sauces - a dill based cream sauce, a chipotle sauce, and the lime-based tamarind sauce from earlier.  There was also a cup of queso fundido, which is melted cheese that you're supposed to dip your tortilla chips in.  However, once the cheese starts hardening up, it becomes one big goopey mess that's pretty challenging to eat with chips.

Of the Mix and Match entree, we got one shrimp, lobster, and crab enchilada that wasn't to my liking.  The BF was appalled when he saw and tasted what appeared to be imitation crab meat.  Blah on that!  There was one soft flour tortilla (or you can choose the hard corn tortilla instead) holding what would be our carne asada taco.   It was alright.  Hiding behind that taco was one tiny ass what they call a burrito filled with dried carnitas.  The burrito was small enough to fit into the palm of my hand.  (Was this a kid size?)  Half of the plate was covered with rice and beans.

When it came down to it, I found myself eating more chips and salsa than the actual food we ordered.  That's a bad sign.  The only leftovers we took were the cheese (so we could remelt it), the tortilla chips, and that lime tamarind sauce. 

Service was fine.  It took awhile to get our orders in, but the food came out rather quickly.  Our waiter was nice and friendly, so no problems there.  I'm glad that we had a gift certificate too like Allison J. because it's definitely not worth the price they are charging!   

Sidenote: They offer a weekday happy hour from 4 pm to 7 pm with $2 chips and guacamole, $3 nachos, $2 flauntas, $3 calamari, $1 margaritas, and $1 tequila shots.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,9,3,2,g1beYlUchXxMFsH54KUxrg

5051432,2013-07-10,0,GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ,"The BF and I were hanging out with friends and somehow fajitas came up and they've been here several times where it was rather good they said so I went along with it. 

So we started off with some chips with a mild red, spicy red and a green. All were good salsas and chips warm.  

We got a order of avocado fries. I assume it was the ""full order"" which was just the amount of a full avocado with a chipotle ranch. I thought it was pretty decent version of this dish. 

Fajitas wise, they didn't have steak with shrimp on the menu but we asked if that was possible and they did it for us. You can order a 1 person or 2 person portion so we got a 2 person one. They give you your own beans, rice, guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, and tortillas and have a shared hot skillet.  

At first I was thinking, ""thats it?"" when I was a few steak strips and shrimp but I was super stuffed. The steak was tender and was cooked to about medium which I appreciated. I prefer things to be not well done, but I know medium rare is kinda hard to do in fajitas. It had a bit of a ranchera sauce (ask for more to dip) The shrimp was cooked well as well.  Peppers and onions had a nice char and seasoned well, no white raw onions or peppers to be had. The beans were a surprise as I don't normally like beans but forgot to ask for all rice. These were flavorful beans though, similar to my moms/grandmas style, similar to that deep porky flavor Leticias has which is the only other place I really enjoy the beans at. 

Service was good. He was friendly, he did our special substitution request with no problem and he was on it with drinks and checking in on us. We also had a drink spill and he got it cleaned up in a jiffy as well. 

It may not be the most loved of places, but it was actually pretty good. Our friends have been here enough times that I trusted them to try it out and ended up enjoying the meal and being ridiculously full. Per their advice though - go for the fajitas, but the other things they've had were just OK.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,5,4,6nHrXYJImYPeorxYtfclVA

We had no problems with that and loved the text notifications when our table was ready. We were seated almost exactly at 40 min but then it was all downhill from there. We had three children, myself and my hubby and we seated toward the back of the restaurant which was relatively empty for a Sunday so I figured they were short staffed then as to why we waited so long. A runner came by and brought chips and salsa and waters thankfully as the kids were getting really hungry. But our actual server didn't come to our table until 25 min later. I timed it because I was about to walk out when he showed up. He took our orders and never came by again even when we ran out of chips and waters. The kids were getting crankier by the minute but we never even saw our server come out to flag him down more than a couple times. The food then took another 30 mins to come to the table and another runner brought our food. Our actual server did not check on us to see if we needed anything until we were almost done. At this point my husband asked for extra tortillas. That took another 10 to 15 min. My husband then had to flag him down for the check and that took another 5 min for him to bring it even though we were right next to the POS system. I had my card ready to go when he came so I didn't have to wait anymore as the kids were so done by this point. He then took another while and disappeared to process my card. Finally when he came back, he curtly said thank you and that was it. Nothing to check on us to see if we wanted more water, nothing. He was very nice and courteous to the table beside us and checked on them more times than us. They were seated after us and left before us. I truly feel that he was discriminating my family because we had children. I have noticed this from some servers who clearly think families are not worth the time and effort of serving. He was short with us and never offered more chips for the kids. It was the most disappointing Mother's Day lunch I've ever had.

The atmosphere is comfortable; the tables and booths are spaced out enough for conversations. The food is decent. The food being ok, the price, and the service made it an ok experience.

For a Mexican restaurant, I am disappointed with their margaritas. My friend ordered the grapefruit, which she found too sour. I ordered the prickly pear, which I found overbearingly sweet. We ended up switching, and drinking, although she didn't like mine either. If you want a great prickly pear margarita, go to Mesa Grill. At Mi Casa, it is pure sugar.

The chips were fresh and warm, which was a plus, but their salsas were lacking. None of the trio stood out as impressive. 

Our group of three ordered the specialties of the night. One was a 14oz. NY steak specials served on top of a cilantro lime rice, grilled vegetables, six shrimp, and topped with crisp onion straws for $24. The steak was seasoned well. The shrimp was cooked nicely, but was overpowered by the sauce it was smothered in. The rice was my favorite. The chef explained that he purees the cilantro, adds in the lime juice and butter, then tosses the rice in it as a binder. The other special we got was a tilapia with three shrimp over roasted corn and black bean rice topped with mango salsa for $18. I did not care for this dish at all. Nothing stood out as spectacular or worth eating. 

The waitress was scrambling, a bit inattentive, and just seemed nervous. I found it odd that we were never asked how we would like our steaks cooked. I will just count myself lucky that she went the safe route and entered medium, because waiting another fifty minutes for a new order would not have been an option.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,0,2,w9mmc_VWq1dpu21nz4mWXg

The sizzling fajitas have got to be one the best I've had in a long time. Completion better step up the fajita game! #micasa #chickenbeeffajitas",Cbtddaoz25YxlVYyuWxu1Q,0,0,5,rQITiWpaTKMkO79q4wD0Zw

Service: 3/10
Price: 4/10
Atmosphere: 7/10

Went here with some of my buddies for some food before a movie. One of my boys swore that this place was great but boy was he wrong. If I could choose one word to describe Mi Casa, that word would be disappointing.

To start the food was pretty bleh. I ordered the carne asada burrito and it barely had any flavor despite all of the green sauce on it. This was probably because it was mostly rice and beans.  The chips and dip were the only reason they got a 2.

The service was pretty whatever. We only ordered water and the refills were on point, but when we ordered food and/or ran out of chips it seemed to take forever to get anything. There were only 3 of us so I didn't think it would be that hard to get some service.

Price wasn't too surprising. The restaurant is inside of the Silverton so I expected it to be $5-$10 higher than something outside of a casino. I spent about $18 for my burrito which is to be expected.

Last but not least, The atmosphere was the best part of the place. There weren't many people when we went midday, but I can see this place being pretty lit on Friday or Saturday nights with a little live music. The place is pretty attractive with a nice looking bar.",k_V-E5TksMJDvqnr1VfACA,1,0,2,DI1RDJiXkhz6jjZWEYSXsA

5679246,2015-08-18,0,GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ,"Family and I use the Silverton Casino / Bass Pro Shop as our pit stop, when we travel to Utah.  It's convenient, easy to find and parking has never been an issue.  We were looking for an easy lunch, in a low-key, kid friendly restaurant.  

Found this inside the Silverton, as we were making our way from the parking structure to the Bass Pro Shop.  It wasn't crowded, and looked like it could be a good place to sit down for a quick lunch.

I ordered the Chile Verde for myself, husband order tacos and we ordered a kids quesadilla for the little guy.  The wait staff was very accommodating when we asked for a booth, instead of the table in the middle of the restaurant.  Our waiter was attentive and service was quick.

My chile verde was okay, arrived hot with tortillas - some of the pork was cooked very well, while some were a bit overcooked and dry.  Overall, it did the job and I enjoyed it enough to finish the meal.  The tacos were good, typical street style tacos - husband enjoyed it enough to not share it.  

Portions were big, service was friendly and seating was plenty.  Chips & salsa were good.  Only (small) bummer was that it was located in the casino - smelled a little bit like smoke (but, I have been to smokier places) and you can still hear the slot machines in the background.  With that said, we totally expected it and it didn't dampen our meal.  

We would definitely go back again, but would stick to simpler meal choices (like tacos, quesadillas, etc.).",0bVdXH34J62nZso8_mE2AQ,1,0,3,W9IOkNTmX-PkYuuQZokc8Q

Fajitas smelled really good, if it's the same chicken as they use in one of the street tacos then they are probably amazing. Not the best Mexican food but the happy hour drink specials and street tacos are a good deal. Service was incredibly fast, staff was very attentive (hostess, waiter, busser).",hqNixeS3AIbpENzSftrq4w,0,0,3,AM8Yj-3drJH8gv1IXv-lTg

I had my beef enchiladas which I always get here, and they were incredibly skimpy on meat!  There was one little piece of meat in the middle of each tortilla.  I would have added a picture, but didn't want to embarrass them too badly as hoping this was on off day for them.  My husband tried the steak fajitas and that was a complete joke!  NO seasoning at all, bland steak with large cut up veggies with cold tortillas.  Sorry, if this is the new way they are cooking at Mi Casa, we will not go back and certainly will not rate them more than 2 stars.  Let's hope if they have new cooks that they get them trained QUICKLY before this place really sinks!",2Pd17IlJVxekp-1fwdgl0Q,1,0,2,wP2UukHLYOqY4LmooUhamA

5877010,2013-07-14,1,GC5wcui5uejRZTi8OCNPkQ,"My GF was craving Mexican and wanted to gamble so we found ourselves at the Silverton and patronizing Mi Casa Grill.. 

Staff was top notch. Quick to fill drinks and keep your complimentary chip basket filled. The menu seemed a little weak. Mostly just your basic Mexican fare and nothing screamed out ""I'M SPECIAL TRY ME!""

My GF tried the Steak Fajitas and was upset that they had poured a tomato/basil sauce over everything. This is a Mexican restaurant not an Italian one so I can understand her confusion and disappointment. 

Management came over right away when they saw her frown after tasting the sauce and offered to remake the dish for her. She declined, scraped off the sauce and dove right in. Turned out the sauce is fairly new on the fajitas and many people don't like it. (Why is it still being served that way would be a good question for the kitchen manager)

I had the seafood enchiladas. They seemed a bit off visually and even a little disappointing that they were using micro/extra small shrimp. After a few sample bites to reassure my tastebuds I liked the dish I ended up cleaning my plate.

They don't make the guacamole at your table but from the taste and chunks found in your order it does appear they are making it fresh in the kitchen it wasnt the best in Vegas but I'd give it top five for Guacamole. My only complaint on the Guacamole was that I had to share it with my table.

All in all we will give it another try should our taste buds crave Mexican and we find ourselves inside of the Silverton Casino but we won't be going to the Silverton specifically to eat here.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,2,1,3,iD6rBw7wQGkVV-D8TqDSZQ

The shrimp dish from the $10 lunch menu I ordered was covered in the diablo sauce, and it was just way too much. I tasted it and knew that even being a spicy food fan, my stomach couldn't take that much diablo sauce! Or my colon, for crying out loud!
I asked for a manager and found out they would try to find one. Instead, one of the chefs came out. I explained my plight and he didn't agree with me. No apology, just an attitude. His ""explanation"" was that it's diablo sauce. Well, duh. That doesn't make it OK to pour it on!
I'm no Gordon Ramsay, but I know when they screwed up! 
So that was returned, and I had the chicken enchiladas instead, which were so yummy! 
Sad and so unprofessional. Hopefully an apology is forthcoming for basically telling me to eff off (if I could have read his mind) because I dared to complain about their crappy dish!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,2,0,2,sf9UDn1QRW9JFGybGnvbuw
