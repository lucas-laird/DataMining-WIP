We got a couple appetizers, the tofu and the veggies, the tofu was wonderful. Silky tofu with a light fried batter and a delicious mouth watering peanut sauce to dip it in. A couple orders of that and i could eat it as an entire meal. 

For entrees we got the Dan dan noodles, which was a thicker noodle, kind of like ramen consistency and we mixed it in with the provided peanut sauce. It was different than what I normally eat, but so glad I tried it and will be ordering it again. We also got the crispy chow mein and the regular chow mein. Both were excellent, sauces were good and ratio of toppings to noodles was spot on. 

For dessert we shared a mango sticky rice. We were so full. But it was so delicious! Wonderfully sticky, the mango was ripe and sweet and the extra sauce I wanted to drink. If you don't like sweet, hust don't put the sauce on. 

The best part is we got great food, great customer service and a great price. Worth it!",tQVTyovdm4doXxDSkfYUUw,0,0,5,_-EzOGLnojAhYObpOA9cHw

The other food, such as the fried rice, was just OK. The baos, which I normally love, had really tough, beef jerky like meat that I ended up pulling the meat out just trying to bite it. The fried tofu was very bland with no seasoning.

1131709,2018-03-06,1,NXcV1HuXbfus0QNdI6UpOA,"If you love Asian food, you'll want to check out Sweet & Spicy. The name of the business speaks for itself as majority of their entrees are incorporated with sweet and spicy flavors, which grabbed my attention because I love them both. Upon entering, Mama Lee was welcoming and friendly. She serviced us herself and recommended the top favorites in the menu. She was very sweet and took great care of us. 

We ordered two of their appetizers, the shaking chicken and sweet & spicy wings (5 pc). Both were good, but not enough for me to want to order this again as it is basic chicken wings and fried chicken. As for the main entrees we've ordered, the Laksa Noodle soup and the Sweet & Juicy Chicken is a MUST try. I was excited about the Laksa soup the most since several people talked highly of it. They're right, I loved it. It had loads of flavors. The rich coconut curry creaminess with a bit of spice was a perfect remedy for the cold weather and to my stomach. The Sweet & Juicy chicken tastes similar to orange chicken, but way better. It was nice and crispy on the outside, juicy in the inside. Mama Lee's Chow Mein reminded me of Pad-see-ew (Thai) because of the thick flat noodles with eggs, and vegetables. Usually I know chow mein is used with thinner noodles. I'm sure that's the Asian fusion coming into play. It was delicious nonetheless. 

The restaurant is a decent size. Decor is nice and modern. The prices on the menu were inexpensive ranging from $3.99-$7.99 only. We were able to order 7 food items for under $45 with tax! Each dish can feed up to two people. But we were a party of 3 with 7 dishes hehe. What can I say, I like options! To top it all off, Mama Lee gave my daughter a complimentary Mango Pudding and wow that was delicious! Overall, the service and prices won me over.

Located on the NorthWest corner of Flamingo and Durango, it sits facing south, west of the CareNow Urgent Care. 

Decent sized restaurant with an open style kitchen, with a fairly small menu. 

10 ""Appetizer"" including Sweet & Spicy wings, edamame, poached broccoli, vegetable spring rolls, green salad bowl, calamari, dancing tofu, homemade little dumplings, braised pork belly buns, and shaking chicken

5 ""Wok Fried Noodle"" including Sweet & Spicy, Mama Lee Chow Mein, Pork Belly Udon, Crispy Egg Noodle, and Singapore Noodle

7 ""Rice"" including Sweet & Spicy fried rice, Mama Lee Fried Rice, Lychee Massaman Curry, Spicy Rice Bowl, Signature Rice Bowl, House Curry, and Sweet & Juicy Chicken

9 ""Soup Noodles"" including Shrimp Noodle Soup, Tempura Udon, Laksa Noodle, Miso Ramen, Shoyu Ramen, Beef Pho, Dan Dan Noodle, Fish Ball Soup Noodle, and Crispy Fish Noodle Soup

4 ""Desserts"" including Grass Jelly Lychee, Mango Pudding, Bobo Chacha, and Warm Mango Sticky Rice

We had both gotten Dan Dan Noodles and Braised Pork Belly Buns to share. 

Dan Dan Noodles include garlic ground pork, egg white noodles, cucumber topped with a sesame paste sauce. 

Very simple dish. Sesame paste is a staple for the base of a dan dan noodles. Wish they offered a spicier version or way to make it spicy. Could use more of the cucumbers as well. The dan dan noodles became fairly one noted with out the freshness due to lack of cucumbers, and other spices. Still a decent dish and amount for the price though. 

As I took it to go, it was served in a black plastic container with a clear lid. I believe these are microwavable. Good quality take out containers. 

Braised Pork Belly Buns (2 Pieces) comes with pickled cucumbers and carrots with a sweet soy reduction. The pork belly buns was nice to have the pickled cucumbers and carrots as it helps bring some acidity and brightness to the buns. Unfortunately the pork belly isnt as soft as I had hoped. Though it may have been because I did take it to go. Comes with a few of those shrimp crackers on the side too XD 

Overall, ok place. Good to know there's a chinese place nearby thats decent where i don't have to travel down to Chinatown for. 2 noodle dishes and appetizer for less than 20 bucks.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,5,2,3,Udgl_7BXNooJ87PgF9kk7A

Anyhow, their weekend Menu Hainan chicken was as good as Flock and Fowl and neighbor Nuro. And more reasonably priced. Their potstickers are good with special dark sticky soy sauce which I have never seen anywhere else. Vegetables egg rolls were hot for long time. Singapore noodle were decent and could have add even more curry powder.

We started with some appetizers like the pork bun with teriyaki sauce was good, their calamari has a good seasoned breadings and the one that I truly enjoyed was their peanut sauce from their dancing tofu. I kid you not, their peanut sauce is amazing and I asked for an extra sauce so I can just dip my calamari and pork bun as well. 

Aside from the appetizers I ordered their Laksa soup and hubby tried their Miso Ramen. In their Ramen soup you have the option to combine the chicken and pork so we did that and my husband told me that he liked it better with just the pork. I had their Laksa soup and it was truly delicious and such a comforting bowl of soup. 

I honestly told one of the server that I'll probably need a to go box for my soup because we've ordered 3 appetizers and mostly I ate all of them. But boy I was wrong because as soon as start eating and enjoying my Laksa I didn't realize that my bowl was already empty. Hahaha!

However their Laksa here is very different. The Laksa we ordered here did not resemble any Laksa I have ever tasted which was a big letdown for my sister and a and huge disappointment for my mom considering she was born in Malaysia and has been to lots of different parts of Asia eating Laksa so she had high hopes. Instead, they used a broth that was very similar to Thai curry as it had a very strong coconut taste and used rice noodles which is uncommon but still one of the two noodle choices that traditional Laksa uses which is either rice noodle or vermicelli. If you're used to the traditional Malaysian Laksa and want to give this one a try I would give it chance. There's not much in it aside from rice noodles, a sweet coconut heavy flavored broth, slices of fish cake , and some bean sprouts. However, they do also have some other dishes that are worth trying. 

Appetizers: 

Shaking Chicken
- Almost like popcorn chicken as it is fried, crispy, and seasoned with salt and pepper.

Entrees:

Laksa
- Was told that it is Singaporean Laksa but tasted like Thai curry with an overwhelmingly amount of coconut milk with rice noodles, fish cake, bean sprouts and half an egg.

Fried Fish noodle soup
-nothing special, just fried fish fillets in a thick broth

Tempura Udon (for to-go)
-messed up our order and gave us pork belly buns. The pork belly buns were okay. The sauce seemed to overwhelm the taste of the pork belly as it is very sweet.

Overall, I would give this place a 3 out of 5 stars because they messed up our to-go order even though there was only a total of three tables and took a total of half an hour for our order to come out. The servers seemed new but I could see that they were trying and I hope that this place can improve on their service and not mess up orders as I see potential in this place considering the place is very clean and looks upscale, just needs to work on service.

NOTE: If you're a fan of shrimp crackers they come with every order!",hMwPqwbNQV94fWSBhM4QaQ,1,0,3,I0diXMtLGYIrJcheRuJWKQ

Walked in, small restaurant....sat ourselves down on an empty table that was open. Place is clean. Looking over yelp reviews to see what's good to order. 

We started with drinks. I got a Thai ice tea that had alot of milk in it but it was the usual taste like the can ones. My husband got regular ice tea since there was no sweet tea available. He ask for a simple syrup and the waitress gave him a clear coconut flavored syrup...lol...now his tea tasted like coconut water but that didn't ruin it. It wasnt bad either....hehe

Appetizers: yelp reviews said to order the pork braised buns that came with 2 and 2 shrimp chips on the side. That was good but i think I could have used some hoisin sauce in it. Also, the sweet and not so spicy wings...perfectly cooked and crisp on the outside. Not a wow factor but it was tasty. 

Entree: I ordered the spicy rice bowl with shrimp. It had green onions, bell peppers, and onions in it. Loved the flavor but they should have cut down a little on the sauce. It was too much. I wonder if i can have it on the side and mixed it to my liking. 

My husband had the same thing. It was called Signature rice bowl (?) but not as spicy and with teriyaki sauce and vegetables. He loved it. He would choose sweet over spicy btw.

Lastly, desserts...warm sticky rice with mango and coconut milk on the side. We had to take it to go and we ordered an extra one for my mother in law. Got home, ate it....oh, my...that was good but portion is small but worth it. 

Definitely be back!! Thanks Yelpers for helping us out on food choices. Happy Eats!!!",Jtoi5k9Pw_L4MOP4SfJTNg,1,1,5,C-K4TYQdgUrgIWr-Zrhhyw

The restaurant is so clean and look grand new. The atmosphere is calm and nice but it would be better if they play some music in the restaurant. 

There were two different menus, one with picture and one with only words, I like the one with more picture since it easy and make me have faster decision on my choice of food. We ordered Dancing tofu, crispy noodle, chicken satay, lychee curry and lychee grass jelly for drink. The price is pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get. 

Food Review:
Dancing tofu: the tofu is soft and the sauce is sweet and creamy but kinda not mixing together with the taste
Crispy noodle: it look good and the texture is perfectly crispy but a little bit salty for my taste. 
Chicken satay: grilled to perfection, the sauce for this dish is very similar or maybe the same with the dancing tofu sauce. Cucumber and red onion come with it kinda not go good together with the chicken satay in some way. 
Lychee house curry: taste great, creamy and crunchy at the same time (roasted peanut) the best dish of my order
Lychee grass jelly: taste very similar with my hometown dessert which i really like it, sweet but not too much. The lady also gave me extra sugar in case I want it more sweet.


Customer service: the lady who served us is very friendly and nice, always checking on us. I would say they really care about customer.",r3yAJG0lCmi2MMe0UejRMg,0,0,4,wkOu-Fvr6yOOgDWcfrdHKA

I went with the laksa soup as it's the only time I've seen this dish in Vegas.  Really nice milky taste and spicy after adding peppers and their house spicy sauce.  The meat was fresh, though the egg a little undercooked.  The owner came around constantly to ask how the meal was and was extremely nice.  

Take out seemed to be the best mode of meal at Sweet & Sour, however.  Always taking calls and ready for orders in about 15 minutes or less.  Meal comes out fast and hot.

-calamari
-lychee massaman curry

-mango pudding

The ramen had absolutely no taste to it. It was really watered down. No flavor whatsoever. The pork in the ramen tasted weird too. It was very thick and a little rough to eat. The calamari was just okay. It was very small and not really worth it. Didn't have a lot of flavor either. Lychee massaman curry was bland. Also no flavor. Braised pork bun was decent but the buns were overly soggy and they didnt put enough of sauce in the bun. The grass jelly is by far the worst ive ever had. You can buy can grass jelly from an asian market and make it home and it would taste better than the one here. Last item we ordered was the mango pudding and that was also lacking in flavor.

It's a little thing, but it's one of the few Asian places that have ""free refill fountain drinks."" Just a nice touch, and I appreciate it. 

I had the Spicy and Sweet Noodle, and I would order it again. I did not care for the Calamari, but otherwise, I was fine with the food. She knew I was not happy with the Calamari, and provided us with a homemade dessert as her way of saying, ""thank you, and I hope you will return"".

Mama Lee recommended choices and you could not have asked for a sweeter, or kinder hostess. She took an interest in everyone's satisfaction with their meals, and that is the mark of courtesy and good management.

This is one of those places that you wish the owners the best of success, and you hope they will succeed.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,2,1,3,C0wmvGUOVcTsNAQuvcdrZQ

Laksa Noodles: coconut curry based noodles. Tasted like watered down yellow curry. The description says rich, but it had a very watery texture. 
Dan dan noodles: sichuan chinese noodles. Minced pork, spicy sauce is on the side. It has enough taste on its own, so if you're afraid of the spicy you can still have it.

4484730,2018-01-23,4,NXcV1HuXbfus0QNdI6UpOA,"Found out about this new little place from Terri R. and Mel C., and I'm so glad we followed their suggestion. It's a gem!

We were greeted so warmly, first by our waiter, Chris, then Mama Lee, the owner, and then finally by her husband, Patrick, who was helping out on his day off. What wasn't so warm was the temperature - we were freezing (the thermostat said 66°), but they cheerfully raised it, plus offered us complimentary hot jasmine tea to warm us up, which Mama Lee refilled constantly.

The menu isn't ordinary Chinese but, since Mama is from Singapore, the food reflects the eclectic nature of that country's cuisine: there's something for everyone.

There's a small cup of fresh edamame on the table to snack on while you're looking at the menu.  We started with an appetizer of Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. Since I had told Patrick that I like to try to ""eat healthy,"" he thoughtfully left off the oil and served the sauce on the side, which I appreciated.

We ordered Singapore noodles and Shoyu ramen to share. The ramen broth was very tasty, and the Singapore noodles were chock full of shrimp, chicken, and egg. Not as spicy as some I've had, but there's stuff on the table to add as much fire as you like. It was fine for me. Next time I'll probably try some of the Thai options.

What made this place our new go-to for Asian food was not just the quality of food, the cleanliness, the modern decor, and the low, low prices - it was the unbelievable friendliness of Mama, Patrick, and Chris, who kept checking on us and exuding a warmth unlike any other place of this kind. Maybe not every diner appreciates it when an owner sits down at the next table to have a chat, but for us it makes us feel like valued guests. I wish more owners would recognize that genuine friendliness goes a long way to creating loyal customers. 

You can do take-out, of course, but for Mama Lee and Patrick, they'd rather you sit down and stay a while. That what ""people"" people do!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,15,11,5,IBnQy-BMN8bz6kPbMO8pBA

The laksa was tasty but there were a lot of hard stems from the basil and something else so I had to remove them from my mouth. That made enjoying my food a little harder. They were out of shrimp so we couldn't get the shrimp udon. The miso ramen had a very strong wine taste and wasn't like any of the dozen ramen places we've been to. The pork was super thinly sliced and not very good either. I think it was because the broth was so weird tasting. The Chinese broccoli was really tasty as a side dish. It was fresh and the gravy was nicely flavored. The pork buns were good, but not the best. The pork was thin and underwhelming. I could see one of the cooks in the kitchen doing something that looked like smelling how fresh some of the ingredients were before using it. That kind of worried me. When he saw me looking, he moved so I couldn't see him. The tables were not super clean and though they were not at all busy, they left tables dirty with dishes for quite some time after people left. I want to come back to try some of their small plates but I'm not sure the wide range of Asian dishes is doing them any favors because they don't specialize and make the specialty shine.

She's been here 13 years from Singapore so she knows a thing or two about laksa. 

The kitchen accommodated our request for half pan fried potstickers and half fried potstickers when we ordered their Homemade Little Dumplings. We also ordered the Braised Pork Belly Buns, Poached Broccoli, Sweet & Spicy Wings and Crispy Egg Noodle. They were all good but my favorite was the Braised Pork Belly Buns. It's a must order here.
