Last time my only choice was a chicken shawarma. Or gyro. But not a beef shawarma. 
The worst part was being charged for pita bread when I ordered hummus. She asked if I wanted to purchase the pita for the hummus. I asked ""I have to pay for that?!"" yes.

320446,2016-05-14,0,bjllusUsLq9zE4yZnLpOzg,"More like ""Gyro Plus""

I'm beginning to think I'm unlucky because, unlike most reviewers, I know what real Shawarma is, and this ain't it. Whenever I'm in a new city, I try to look for real Shawarma. Outside of CA and MI, I always fail because reviewers insist they had great Shawarma that was actually mediocre Gyro.

The similarities are that both are cooked on a vertical rotisserie, and both are typically served as wraps. Here are the key differences:

- Gyro: A Greek wrap made with processed meat (deli luncheon meat). Typical toppings are COLD tomatoes, cucumbers, Tzatziki sauce, and possibly onions. The sandwich is generally cold and shaped like a cone.
- Shawarma: A middle-eastern wrap made with actual meat (beef and/or lamb) with special seasoning, and nice blob of fat on top that melts as the meat is slow-cooked. When ordered, the Shawarma is sliced down onto the griddle where it's mixed with HOT veggies (tomatoes, onions, parsley), tahini sauce, and possibly garlic sauce. The sandwich is cylindrical and is served hot.
- Abomination: Some hybrid of the two made by taking a gyro and making a small substitution such as tahini instead of Tzatziki. It's typically cylindrical like a Shawarma.

Sadly, Gyro is more well-known than Shawarma, and much cheaper/easier to make (processed meat, cold ingredients). As a result, when a place advertises Shawarma (even in its name), it is typically serving either Gyro or Abomination. Some places start out serving both Shawarma and Gyro, but end up downgrading to Abomination to save time/money. The only places that serve real Shawarma are in communities where a lot of middle eastern or Armenian people live because they know the difference.

Yelp reviewers: I have nothing against those of you who fall for the fake Shawarma. I hope you read this and start to recognize the real thing. I'd love to be able to rely on Yelp to find real Shawarma one day.",dmzHtNzjJh4iXGsAERNOTA,4,1,2,LJo2F2YmWMfucsRakHpwqg

/I deleted my other good review as it unfortunately does not hold anymore./
This place has changed and gone through new management of some sort, food quality and customer service does not meet my standards anymore. I will not elaborate on the food in this review, only the customer service to make it shorter.
I went there today, ordered my usual with a side salad. The new owner/manager served me.  
I asked for the usual ""toppings"" for my salad: cucumbers, onions, olives and feta cheese.  When he got to the olives, he said it would be $1 extra (which, btw, is not displayed anywhere). I told him it used to be free as any other items there since you make your own salad, he didn't seem to care (I thought to myself he's probably having a bad day or something) so I let it go and went on to the next one, feta cheese. He sprinkled a tiny amount (which is ridiculous for a Greek salad), so I asked for a bit more (this has NEVER been an issue before).
He then flipped out, walked to the register and tried to change the order, he said I would have to pay for a medium salad which is like $2-3 more.   I told him I didn't want a medium salad and I'm good with the small side salad. and I was ready to leave after I got my main dish. This guy got so angry, he raised his voice and started preaching about ""what am I thinking, who am I, everything is free here??"" etc..  I politely told him that I just want my salad and go and that I thought his attitude was VERY inappropriate. He just kept going and turned red, other customers were watching the whole thing (bad for business). I couldn't believe what I've just experienced - I haven't seen anything like it in a long long time. 
Needless to say, I felt offended and asked for a refund, then left.  This guy had no manners nor customer service skills.
Long story short, I will NOT go to this place again and will not recommend it to anyone anymore. There are at least a dozen other Kebab places around anyway that treat you as a person and not just $$$.",6v4ZkzsDaMaKpXtvm5fDFw,4,0,1,PvnNtuXvR1b6A8mesXdaEQ

We just came from a massage and my Mom had a very bad therapist and didn't even care for Mediterranean food at the time. She left the massage place stressed out. My poor Mommy, but her filet mignon beef kebab made up for it :) Naji (sp?) was awesome. He greeted us with such positive vibe. Gave us a history of how he evolved with the Filipino community.  The rest of us ordered chicken shawarma and some chicken moussaka. The Rose water Iced Tea was the highlight of my meal. Baklava was also good.

I've been to quite a few places in vegas that have similar things on their menu. That, however, is the end of the similarities. The food here is outstanding. If you are looking to get your ""zankou"" cravings satisfied (for all you so-cal folks) please believe, naji's food is of a much higher quality and the flavors are a cut above any other restaurants that share similar options. 

Get the garlic sauce. Put it on everything. Buy a gallon, and use it at home, you won't be sorry. 

Give this place a shot next time you are headed west on the 215. Even if you think you don't enjoy this type of food, you're wrong. Grab a kebab. Try the filet mignon one. You like steak don't you? No red meat? Get chicken. You are vegan?? Well, I'm sure there is something for you too. You won't be disappointed. I'm serious.",HJobwEhsfFXjHNOPyCrK7Q,2,0,5,bN3HnfU5drekBzACLFgYHg

I eat a lot of Mediterranean and Greek food.
I was excited to try the food here.

I ordered the chicken skewers plate and the lentil soup.
There was one girl working behind the counter and she seemed nice and knowledgeable about the menu items.

The lentil soup was served first, as I requested. It is not a usual lentils soup. The lentils are actually pureed, you won't find whole lentil pieces. That's not bad, just an observation. There was a nice puree type of liquid, def some vinegar and lightly salted. Overall a great soup. Try it if you like lentils soup.

After 7, 8 minutes my plate was served. First, one minor issue - the girl forgot to add a fork. So I had to go back to the counter and ask for one.

The plate included numerous items - 2 chicken skewers, small salad, yellow rice, nicely baked whole tomato, baked and cut whole jalapeño pepper, and some kind of white cheese puree in the middle and also humus and pita bread.
I personally think there should be no jalapeños in any greek or Mediterranean food. So I removed it. The rice and humus were very good, the salad and tomato, also. But one of the chicken skewers was not cooked all the way, 3 of 4 pieses were a bit chewy. Def needed another 2 minutes on the grill.

The chicken was nicely seasoned and the good skewer tasted amazing. 

Also, the place is very clean, it's not small, there's plenty of room inside. There are napkins and some condiments on each table.

Overall I rate it 4 starts and I recommend it to anyone!

THIS place however makes it soooooo good! I had the special, which was $1 off that day. It was a chicken shawarma sandwich on what looked like a grilled flatbread wrap. Was so juicy and tasty. Also, I had the rosewater sweet tea and it was amazing! My friend had the chicken kabob plate and it was $4 off that day. One grilled chicken skewer and one of ground chicken. They were both very tasty. The service was excellent as well and they offered samples to taste. The falafal was a bit dry but it would certainly not detur me from going back.

She is very argumentative. I ordered chicken shawarma wrap without tomatoes, my husband doesn't like them. I also ordered the shawarma pizza without them. 

My order comes out and I notice my pizza has tomatoes. So instantly check my husbands order, sure enough it had tomatoes. 

I take it up to her and tell her I asked for no tomatoes and she claims I never told her no tomatoes on pizza, and that the wrap -doesn't have tomatoes- the epic part was when I told her ""really it doesn't"" as I proceeded to pull out tomatoes from  the wrap. Then she without apologising turned and started speaking to the chef. They replaced the wrap. Anyways doesn't make you want to dine at this place. But the food is really extremely good. They just need someone else working the tables.

Last night I broke fast and had the vegetarian platter, which reminded me of the mezza platter I used eat in Dubai, except everything is on one plate.  The hummus and babaganoush was amazing, as well as the grape leaves stuffed with eggplant.  The flavors were tangy and fresh and the portions are big. I was full of yummy veggie goodness.  They also have meats such as lamb, beef and chicken kabobs.

This is a great place for vegetarians as well as vegans and meat eaters.  They also have a good selection of ready made Arabic/Lebanese food to take home.  

Best of all are the home made sweets which are made there fresh. I always leave with a box of fresh baklava.   

I have tried the falafel wrap and its's huge, the combo comes with fries and a drink.

This is a good casual place for breakfast, lunch and dinner, prices are good and food is always fresh.

The staff was helpful in helping me decide what to order. Since it was my first visit and I live on the other side of town, I ordered 2 meals. What can I say? Mediterranean meals are usually health conscious to begin with anyway :)

Sides: 4/5
I ordered a side of tabbouleh and it was fantastic! It was fresh and had a great balance of flavor to it. The lentil with rice was mixed in with tomatoes and grilled onions. I wish they can balance out the ratio. It was too much lentil for my taste, and the flavor was just okay. 

Gyro beef/lamb sandwich: 3/5
This sandwich came in wrapped like a burrito. The meat was thinly sliced with a mild spice to it. It came in with the traditional veggies - tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, etc. The garlic creamy white sauce was mild. I wasn't a fan of the thin pita wrapper used. To me it was dry and was served not as warm as I would like it to be despite of the nice grilled marks on it. 

2 combo choice: 5/5
Oh my! This was my first try of moussaka and it was delicious! It has a great combination of lamb, spices, cheese and the custard sauce on it was the cherry on top for me! So good! 
The other choice was the stuffed zucchini with beef and rice filling. This was also delicious with a mild spice marinara sauce.

I would be a returning customer for sure. They have a decent menu to choose from and I can't wait to try their deserts!",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,5,8,4,K71QLhe-uQkWjH9RaTHbVA

I went to the location on Decatur and all I can say is OMG....did anyone taste the food?  I took a bite of their ""lasagna"" and all I got was salt and cinnamon.  Eewwwww. I do not like cinnamon in my savory food and I wished the lady at the covet would've told me about the cinnamon as if I knew I would not have gotten it.

The pita bread is too thin leaving the gyro more of a cruncy feel. The chicken I had was good, but my boyfriend said its too bland. The feta cheese was placed more in one area of the gyro making it too strong. And gyro was rolled like a burrito. Not mu cup of tea. The fries were good because the oil was good. They are thin fries with the lowery type of seasoning. They the white yogurt looking wauce, but it was made very liquidy. Again not my cup of tea, its too drippy, not good duppong sauce. My boyfriends gyro was beef and lamb. I dont like lamb and when I tried it, I didnt taste the lamb. Thats why my boyfriend disnt like his gyro. He said no flavor and you dont taste the lamb, which he loves. The rice was good, but it was a bit dry. Still I loved rice and hard to screw up.

It's juicy and flavorful and comes with the most delicious garlic sauce. You can get it in a pita as a sandwich or on a plate, but just be sure to get that delicous sauce. You're welcome. :) 

Although the chicken is my usual go to, I decided to try something different on my most recent visit. I went with the lamb shawarma plate and it was really delicous and filling. It had a generous helping of gyro meat, hummus, pita, tzatziki sauce and salad all on one plate. Think bento box. The price, $12.99, does not include a drink and one will set you back another $1.99. I think the price is right for the amount of food you get, but I wish it included a drink. 

Once you order you get a number and they call you when it's ready. I was mildly annoyed when I realized that to-go orders were being sent out before dine in orders, regardless of who was there first. My buddies and I waited about 15 minutes for our food. Not a huge deal for me, but my coworker only gets a 30 minute lunch so he had to scarf it down. I am wondering what the hold up is with this place and why they are so slow in getting orders out. The meal I ordered was not anything that had to be cooked. I guess I'll file this under questions I'll never get the answers to. Oh and they have this big ass fan in the dining room, it's really called big ass fan. Anyway I was looking at it cause it's cool how big it is, and I noticed the blades are caked in dust. Not very appealing considering its in a restaurant and that dust could fall onto the tables into the food. I think someone needs to get a big ass ladder and a big ass duster and take care of that.

I love my greek/mediterranean food. My usually go spot little farther away from home so was hoping that found one just as good. Shawarma only down the road for me.  I only had the Shawarma Beef Sandwich on this visit. It was awesome! I was unsure whether to get the plate or sandwich. I came for lunch went with the sandwich, All the sandwich choices you can make combo with fries/soda for $2.99. The fries really nothing special but wanted drink so like combo me up. The sandwich itself nice size so really no need for fries. Just me. The sandwich had choice between beef or lamb went with the beef. The pita bread that grilled (the bread of the sandwich) that could eat by itself with some of the hummus (one things no doubt look forward too coming back trying or take some to go). You add the beef, Tahini Sauce, Tomato, Parsley, Pickles, Onions, Sumac. All these fresh ingredients. Eat bite taste the crunch of fresh pickles, nice slices of tomato, and the sauce brings it all together. It was one of the best pita bread roll up ever for me. 

The interior talk about kind of all over the place between the cartoonist logo, four arcades games spread out in the restaurant (pac-man good choice classic that never gets odd), couple widescreen up top can catch whatever spots game is on, and then have salad bar area (you can build your own salad; I saw lot of fresh great looking items choose from), hot area again you can build your own, great display of authentic greek dessert from the CLASSIC baklava and knafeh (I have no idea that this is but looked just as good as the baklava), and top it all grab-n-go area cold items like hummus to tabouleh can take home. Not in huge sizes so that nice cause just right amount not go to waste. I like that have options for everyone. They even have vegetarian dishes (not many restaurant have on there set menus).

Each a la cart skewer was $3.99 but each skewer had only 4 dice-sized squares of meat with tiny, almost unrecognizable veggies wedged in between--and all on top of a shallow bed of shredded lettuce and perhaps salad dressing?  My 14-year old son did NOT enjoy these because he wanted them plain.  (4) My husband's ""plate"" was served in a wide, cafeteria-style tray with little compartments.  It included hummus, salad, main, garlic sauce.  Portions were small but spread out by the compartments.  We were not fooled or amused.  4) it seemed like there was 1 man to take orders, make food, AND deliver to our table--service was very slow. Perhaps that's why he kept trying to persuade us to order food from their Panda Express-like display.  

Overall I can only give 2 stars because while some of the food was passable, the service, portion size, and value were lacking.",Ey_-rzkcVOSL4_C2wZzmMA,0,0,2,kZjN6CAX0PZ8ZSn5-QOccQ

My husband told me about Shawarma Plus and I was skeptical until I tried the food. I had a Shawarma sandwhich and omg it was so delicious. 

I tried the garlic sauce (which is always a must) and it was fresh and you can tell that it's homemade. 

I don't always eat Baklava because it's usually too sweet for my liking, the Baklava here gets 5 stars also. 

To top it all off, the owner and everyone else are super nice and welcoming.

The restaurant environment is casual, clean, and relaxed. The light atmosphere is enhanced by three old-school arcade machines, which is nice to have if kids are dining in with you. The menu offers the standard variety of food you expect from a place called Shawarma Plus. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate. It was okay. I think the chicken could have been juicier and more flavorful, but it was decent and certainly no where near bad. I didn't care for the side garlic sauce, which was disappointing because I have had it elsewhere and loved it. I asked for a side of gyro sauce, and it also wasn't up to par as far as my taste standards go- a little on the watered down side. However, all-in-all, the meal was good, and I will definitely return.  I think the weekend hours are not great; people in Vegas want to eat in places like Shawarma Plus after 7 p.m. on the weekend.  Closing at 7 is almost a slap in the face lol. This place does deliver, and it is worth the delivery fee.

I chose this place today because of the 4.5 stars and the fact that I love schwarmas.  After reading all the mix reviews I placed my order to be delivered.   Once again eat24 failed me and I had to call in my order.  I ordered a chicken schwarma, a kabob plate with steak and chicken, a beef gyro and a side of falafel.  My order was taken quickly and was told to meet at the hotel lobby in 15-20 minutes for pickup. They didn't deliver till 35 minutes later but that was no biggie. 
We immediately opened our bag and in it were 3 wraps and 1 Styrofoam container.  Note:  they messed up on my side order of falafel and gave me a falafel wrap.  No problem.  Ate it anyways.  It was good, but nothing wow.  The falafel wasn't crunchy like I'm used to.  Maybe because it got soften from being in a wrap.  I liked how they had a sticker to label each wrap.  We unwrapped all three wrap and noticed they all looked identical.  I expected my shwarma to be wrapped up in a different type of wrap I'm used to, instead of the pita wrap. It didn't look any different than the gyro, in fact it was exactly like the beef gyro.  So maybe they messed up and gave me a chicken gyro?? Although the sticker on the wrap said schwarma. My husband's gyro was ok.  He said the wrap was too hard, too crunchy. He was disappointed there wasn't a side of tzatziki sauce.
 My chicken ""schwarma"" was ok.  The meat was flavorful but kinda salty for my taste.  There was definitely garlic in it.  I have a favorite gyro place in my hometown, and their schwarmas are THE BEST.  The meats are marinaded and sliced off and then tossed and cooked before being placed in a warm wrap.   This one on the other hand had a different type of chicken meat.  It looked like just plain chicken with garlic seasoning.  And it was a bit dry. And all our wraps were falling apart as we ate because the wrap got soggy from the inside.  The kabob plate was decent.  Both beef and and chicken were tender.  Could use a bit more flavor though.  But i just dipped the meats into the very delicious hummus.  Their hummus is on point.  I would come again only for the hummus.",IRyIguNlHptFCC4JZEkg4w,0,0,3,BR1Zj7p0KgRZixubIbuxfg

Now, this review is just for the shawarma sandwich that I got - it came in a very thin tortilla wrap. I wasn't a fan of it, nor did I like the meager amount of meat and veg that was in it.

There were like 3 people in front of me and the lady behind the counter was doing her best as a couple of the people were asking all sorts of questions and taking FOREVER. She was knowledgable and patient though. It was almost my turn but then a lady came up to the counter asking for Togo boxes and started complaining that the chicken was dry. The lady behind the counter apologized and told the cook in back who informed her that the chicken was fresh. The customer lady continued to waste everyone's time by stating that her husbands chicken was dry too. Come on. You obviously ate it though. Calm down. She basically yelled how dry it was and stormed off. So needless to say by the time I got up to the counter I could tell the girl was over it lol don't blame her what so ever. 

I ordered the gyro beef/lamb sandwich combo and asked to sub a salad instead of fries and was told I could do so without an up charge. Yes!

And honestly I did think $40 was even a tad expensive for two combos with extra skewer.. but once I saw how much came in the bag I was like holy moly ok I get it! They give you enough for two meals.

I decided to get a chicken shawarma wrap. I have high standards for shawarma since I've had them all over the world. Most places I go the garlic sauce is watery and not very flavorful. This place had it all, the pickled beets, the nice rich garlic sauce that wrecks your breath for the rest of the day and the juicy chicken. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice quick lunch. The only thing I didn't like was the owner was a little pushy. Kept trying to get me to buy more when all I wanted was a wrap. Do you want sides, NO I just want the wrap, do you want a platter, NO I just want a wrap, do you want a drink, NO I just want a wrap.

3535481,2016-02-05,1,bjllusUsLq9zE4yZnLpOzg,"My friends and I came here for a quick lunch the other day. Shawarma House is a take-out style type of place with no fancy plates or silverware. That said, it actually has a pretty comfortable vibe to it. 

The prices are more than reasonable, most of them between $6 and $12. I got the Chicken Shawarma Plate for $12, and it included vegetables, rice/fries/salad, chicken, hummus, and bread. What a deal! 

My chicken tasted great. It was seasoned just right, didn't have too much sauce, and was still warm. The bread was thin, crispy, and oven fresh. I loved it. Overall, the food served here is much healthier than a lot of other to-go foods, and the portion sizes are great for lunch. I'm quite pleased. 

The dessert is not that great. When I bought the pre-made Baklava at the counter, I was expecting it to have more of a fluffy consistency like the Turkish Baklava I have had in Germany, but it turned out to be more of a brownie-cookie consistency, more crunchy and packed rather than fluffy and light. I'm not sure if that was just a cultural difference between dishes, but one of the pieces was so hard that I had issues stabbing it with my fork. Not a fan.
 
I would recommend this place for healthy and affordable food-to-go or a casual lunch, but I probably wouldn't get Baklava again.",lYdIJrjX-QgOhQfsvTQlOg,2,2,4,_w_qFTzp5VugPxe239hQCA

3969035,2015-06-02,3,bjllusUsLq9zE4yZnLpOzg,"I really REALLY wanted to like the food here. The owner is very nice & the place looks nice & is clean, but the food is TERRIBLE.

I'm well versed in REAL Middle Eastern food, plus I'm a foodie. I believe that the guy I saw who came out of the kitchen to put something on a plate is the cook & he is LATINO!

People, you NEVER trust a different ethnic background to cook the ethnic food you are eating. That's cooking 101. Not unless he's a to die for real chef.

I haven't tried the lentil soup yet, so maybe it will be good, but I doubt it. 

Here is what I did try:

1. Grape leaves - while the vegetable one was better than the rice one, it's not traditional. I've never had a vegetable one in my life & I've been eating grape leaves since the 80's. Even the can one I buy at Trader Joe's (called Dolmades for the Greeks) is better . 

I bought 4 rice & 1 veggie. They were bland & I ended up giving it to my friend, so there was $4 down the drain.

2. The $9.99 plate consisted of moussaka & the eggplant with beef, which if I had to choose the best dish, that was it, but it was over cooked, dry & very little flavor. 

The moussaka (get this) was made with CHICKEN & had pasta in it. WTH??? It was also bland.

The best moussaka I have found in all my years is at a place across from the University. Shocked me too. Expensive, but very good.

The side dish of gluten or whatever that was, was also bland. I ate most of these dishes only because I was starving & on the road, but then I felt sick afterward because I always feel sick after I eat food that isn't good.

3. The tabbouleh was disgusting. It didn't even look green, NO TASTE, no lemon, no salt, nothing. It also looked like it had been sitting there wilting for hours.

I'm a HUGE Tabbouleh lover when it's prepared properly. This isn't an easy dish to prepare, but even the box mix of Tabbouleh I used to buy was better than this.

When a Middle Eastern place is selling chicken nuggets & burgers, that's warning enough they don't know what they are doing. I of course didn't know this until I got there. 

Even the pickled turnips weren't good enough for me to eat.

Why people give this place 4-5 stars is beyond me, other than to say they've never had REAL Middle Eastern Lebanese food or their sense of quality is very low.

I mean no disrespect to the REAL reviewers here (everyone knows that most reviews are fake). If you love this food, go for it, for people like me who know what good food is, you will have expectations.

I'm not trying to be a snob, but nothing irks me more than when I waste my hard earned money on food that is so bad I have to throw or give most of it away.",0LHevpOrufWaU8pBiTc4gQ,3,0,1,TX4_RiSzWI6o7QtZxpp9_Q

I have been in three times now for lunch, and I don't think I will be returning as I find the pricing too high for the flavor and quality of the food. The employees (owners?) constantly try to upsell as well, which is off putting.

On my first visit I got a combo platter for $8.99 as well as a side of tabouli salad for $3.99. The food was pretty good, especially the chicken with rice, which I found myself craving it a few weeks later...  Sadly, on my next visit the chicken was rather dry and the rice was very bland.

On my most recent visit I had chicken skewers, which came with salad, rice and hummus. It was the special for the day, at $9.99.

Let's first start off with the most important thing.... the name of the place is SHAWERMA plus.  As you know, there are many types of shawerma. I ordered the BEEF shawerma. The girl informed me that it is a combo beef/lamb. If you are familiar with middle eastern or Mediterranean food, then you know beef/lamb meat is actually a GYRO, not shawerma! I wanted to give it a chance so I ordered it. And, of course the meat in my sandwich was gyro meat. Don't get me wrong, if you want gyro meat, then it was really good. I, on the other hand, was looking for an actual shawerma sandwich. 
My family member also ordered shawerma, but with chicken. Her sandwich was good, but was with garlic sauce. A correctly made shawerma sandwich is with tahini sauce. So although both sandwiches were good and full, they weren't what we were looking for. Being of middle eastern descent, I know what shawerma is. 
It's funny to me that the place is called shawerma plus, but they don't make a correct shawerma sandwich. 
We also ordered a side of hummus. The girl asked if we wanted pita bread with it. Of course we want pita bread, how else were we gonna eat the hummus?! And, I was charged for the pita bread. If I had asked for extra bread, then of course I should be charged, but to be charged for the regular order is ridiculous!!!!
I won't even mention how expensive this place is!!! 
I'm sorry to say that although the food tasted ok, it sucks that this is what they are serving people. If your menu states beef, then it should be beef. And if you call yourself an authentic shawerma place, then make actual shawerma!!",Mbhc0vjze4eER5QqtMxoaw,2,0,2,p2GWrYaULLKS4A4YtqwiDQ

The small salad that comes in the plate has a nice tasting dressing and I won't complain about more veggies! Not necessary since the meats are already great, but they provide a garlic sauce that is delicious for dipping the meats.

My husband and I placed an order for delivery, it added up to nearly $70 (delivery was an additional 12 or so) (money is not the issue)   - the chicken was completely dried out and the lamb wraps tasted terrible, the wrap itself was also stale and the garlic sauce was indescribably strong.  

My husband called back to complain as we felt the quality of food should not warrant a price tag like this. It was the worst delivered quality food and we weren't happy, everything about it was BAD. It was the principle. 

Anyway, I am posting this not only because of the quality of food but because the manager went absolutely insane when we called in to complained, he told my husband (in the most aggressive, threatening and disgusting tone) that he was F***** CHEAP, that he SHOULD NEVER CALL again, then he accused him of being  a LIAR and that he was STUPID for ordering SO much as we knew the price. He then hung up on him without any resolution!!! 

Its too bad because we just moved into a new neighborhood and we order for delivery quite often.  (I'd like to believe we help contribute to our local restaurant owners)

Words cannot describe just how horrible this man was, pure aggression, and I cannot imagine having to deal with this level of customer service face to face. The thought of this man holding a sharp objects while simultaneously dealing with a dissatisfied customer sends shivers down my spine.

Service was good. Pretty much self serve. You order at the front then food is served to you when ready.(you do have to get your own utensils near the drink fountain). Very spacious place, clean, and quite busy depending on. 

So what was ordered is the gyro with beef and lamb, gyro with chicken, cabbage stuffed rice, and  baklava. The beef and lamb were really good(would recommend for anyone)  as for the chicken it was okay. I do think it was how the chicken was made. Then again I can't really compare it to anything since it is my first time trying it out. I have tried the grape leaves stuffed with rice from a coworker, thinking that it will be the same as the cabbage stuffed rice. Nope, not at all. I can't say that I hate it but I also didn't like it either. Haha finally onto dessert. I liked it a lot. The only thing that got to me was the syrup that was added on top. It was sweet but the scent and taste of rose petal just threw me off guard. I'm not saying that it was bad, it just confused my taste buds for a bit.

The owner, a Lebanese salesman ripped right out of a jewelry store in Beirut, works the register on occasion. He pushes the kabob platter like it's going out of business, and will sell you a combo meal on anything you order by default. (be sure to speak up before hand if you prefer a' la carte)....but for real, this guy is slick. Be on your A-game when you walk in, or else you'll wake up in the next day in a shopping cart full of baklava. 

Also, rose water tastes like the smell of foot powder masked by an old woman's perfume... However, the rose water iced-tea here I really enjoy. I actually get it every time I go, whether I want it or not.

The interior of the establishment has a partial arcade circa 1992,  a point of purchase counter filled with baked goods for up sell, and some newly added self-serve margarita machines.

It's in a corner I never look at, and the font they use for their sign is thin. They do have a lot of food pictures plastered in the front of their restaurant. Can't see the inside because of it. 

When I went inside, they had premade food already to be served and made into a combo for, I believe $10.99. This place seems like it's great for lunch or people on the go. I love that!  Everything looked very delicious, but I was on the hunt for kabobs! 

I went to get the lamb and beef kabobs plate. It was $11.99, and it came with rice pilaf, lots of vegetables, hummus, and some pita bread. 
The garlic butter it came with was intense in taste! So, I used that very lightly. The pita was warm when I got my tray, the hummus had some lemon tang kick to it that made me lick the plate, the rice was light, the salad had some sort of dressing I wasn't familiar with but was still addicting, and the best part of the whole plate were the kabobs! Both the lamb and the beef were moist, and super tender! It was cooked to perfection!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! lol. SO GOOD. 

I'm going to admit, I may go here after work! I need to try other things in the menu. Thank god for closing at 9pm! 

I will recommend this place to everyone!

The owner called us personally to explain why we didn't get fries with our gyro. He was very nice, personable and understanding. This is a man who cares about his business. 

I only gave it 3 stars because the food itself was just ok. I ordered a shawarma salad and added chicken. It came in a clear container with a ""Best Buy"" date sticker and a label stating what kind of salad and a price tag so I know this was not made to order. I work in a hospital so it reminded me of the cafeteria there. Baba gnoush was packaged the same as well although that was absolutely delicious. The chicken on the salad was so hard. It was like the outer part of a store bought rotisserie kind that had been shredded off and left to sit for days in the frig. I took it all off and gave it to the dog. He was happy. The dressing and salad itself was good though. 

I think if he presented his food in a more fresh way his business could thrive. Cafeteria style is not attractive. Especially since we paid $33 for a gyro, tea, salad and baba gnoush that was low quality. He is a good guy though.

5102221,2016-04-10,1,bjllusUsLq9zE4yZnLpOzg,"Shwarma PLUS gross food EQUALS a bad stomach ache.  This place is way over rated.  

FOOD: The chicken kabobs were overly dry, the hummus and ganouche was unflavorful, and EVERYTHING had salt like crazy.  The salad, rice was super salty. and i usually love heavy tasting things, garlic,spice, soy sauce.  The meal was completely substandard.  It is a fast food type mediterannean.  Far from a gourmet mediterranean chef type food.  The panini which i ordered came on a pita bread instead of french bread.  Cant get a sandwich right??  I totally regretted not ordering the mediterranean hamburger.  But i thought hey its a mediterranean restaurant so ordering med food cant go wrong right?

PLACE: in fact the place looked and felt like a fast food restaurant.  It looked like it was converted from a pizza restaurant.  The problem is the price is completely unjustified.  Our order came out to be thirty something dollars for an order or kabobs and a panini.  Even at a restaurant the pita is free for dipping on ganouche and hummus.  Here they charge.  

THE LAW: like star wars, Stay FAR FAR FAR AWAY in the next galaxy.  For the price and the crappy food, go to a real sit down mediterranean restaurant.  Go to maza grill.  10x better.

Service was great too. The restaurant was another issue. The tables were sticky and the salt shaker was FILTHY. It was so dirty, I was afraid to touch it. There were supplies in the dining room and things were just generally messy. The kitchen looked clean, but a bit disorganized. I would have given this place a solid five stars if the dining room and tables had been cleaner. I'll be back for the schwarma, but I think I'll take it to go.

For $30 the portions were pretty small but worse than that was that it was fast food quality. Flavors were off, and the meat was dry and over cooked. On one dish the meat was very bland. And on my chicken skewers were overly sour from the marinade. Even the grilled tomato was hard and unripe.

The food looks good and next time I will try something other than the gyro plate. Ok, time out, this ""greek"" restaurant decided to americanize the name of things such as ""grape leaves"" instead of dolmades and lasagna instead of Pastitsio.  Not sure if it is so people know what things are called or because they make it different.   The plate lunches come with hummus, pita, gyro meat, and salad type fixins for the gyro plus either fries or a salad.  Not bad for 11 dollars and change.  The food was very filling.  

I was disappointed with the gyro meat.  Although they shaved it off the rotisserie machine, it was actually quite dry and crunchy.It also didn't have a lot of flavor especially on the lamb end of things.  

The sauce was decent but lacking in the minty flavor I'm used to.  The pita is a very thin pita rather than thick ones associated with american gyros.  I prefer it that way.

Hopefully, they will get the message and find a way to get their meat a bit more flavorful and moister.  Still, If you are in the area, it is nice to have choices now.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,8,5,3,srkfEhbEoWuM3CLPJL-wHw

I love that they had the option of high alkaline water that goes along way!! A Power Water! Food was very tasty. I'm big on Mediterranean food so I can be very picky with it. This place is definitely a good place to stop in for some Mediterranean food. I recommend coming here.,uz1_cds7yyehTPYnrArdYA,0,0,5,hbM6vi0ROy1Iq12iOKETMQ

Another issue, I despise them asking for tips when you pay. If I have to stand and order. Pick up my own order. Eat from from styrofoam with plastic cutlery that I have to get myself and then finally clear the table myself the PLEASE Explain what it is that I would be tipping for?????",351JBO0L-BUsRNwaHQ5Ftw,0,0,3,KtApKrFtbhsqheA5nTxqEw
5793409,2015-04-16,1,bjllusUsLq9zE4yZnLpOzg,"Had the serious displeasure of eating here this afternoon. A friend wanted to try this place on a whim and I agreed. 

If you didn't know any better, you might have thought you were walking into a 99 cent Chinese food establishment (case full of weird pre-made food) or is it Mexican? The multi colored chairs and tables scream Fiesta. And old school video games along the wall? What?! Not really sure what this place is. 

The gyro I ordered was decent sized, but it was not even a gyro. It looked like a sad burrito. The chicken inside was beyond dry and it was supposed to have tzatziki sauce in it (it didn't). It was dry and tasteless. Soggy French fries. The baklava tasted like it had been made days before, it was not fresh. Asian lady behind the counter was nice though. 

This place is NOT authentic. These were not very good Mediterranean recipes. We won't be back.",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,1,0,1,HwNfh5n00CYd1IPlNDzaJw

First time I went there, I got the gyro wrap... best gyro wrap I've ever had! The second time I went there, I got the chicken shawarma sandwich. I loved the chicken shawarma so much that the next time I went, I got it in a wrap. Loved the garlic sauce that they spread on the sandwich!! The latest thing I've tried is their Mediterranean style burger... the meat melted in my mouth. SO DELICIOUS!!! Best part is I just call ahead while I'm on the road, and the food is ready right when I get there! Awesome customer service!!

5809406,2016-04-25,1,bjllusUsLq9zE4yZnLpOzg,"Oh gosh. I did not like this place one bit. This was probably the worst Mediterranean food I have ever had. Keep in mind this post is from someone who loves salt. Everything was LOADED with salt, and I mean LOADED. I had the chicken kabob plate and the babaganoush. The rice and the salad that came with the chicken were loaded in salt. The chicken was dry and super salty. It's hard to taste the natural flavors of food when it's sooooo salty. I would never come here again. I was originally brought into this place because of their great marketing strategy. They have posters of delicious looking food all over the outside of the restaurant. It looked delicious and made me hungry. I am extremely disappointed. A total travesty.",ScwVhHmUFLZwVW9E5fvKjw,4,1,1,U_IzOEgBWQT7qeXzGMjeMg

We arrived just as they opened for lunch and the food was bland and so soft all the textures were the same.  Just a hot and soft mess. It's what happens to food that has endured several heating and reheating cycles which means it was probably days old.  We've encountered this several times.  You just have to come in when you're feeling lucky.  When you don't get leftovers, the food is good.",eRsIWgIoaVkzgdF6_bgCwA,0,0,2,xX2LqY-T5pXvgcpooiRHeg

5905076,2015-01-12,0,bjllusUsLq9zE4yZnLpOzg,"I was on my way to a meeting at a nearby office and decided to stop by.
The menu had the usual array of menu items that you'd find at a GOOD Mediterranean restaurant, and I went for the Gyros Sandwich combo (fries and drink).

The total was about $11.  
I LOVE Gyros, and I LOVE Mediterranean food.
Unfortunately I didn't like what I had here.

The Gyros meat was lukewarm and cold towards the center, and the fries were ALMOST warm.  It's pretty hard to screw up a meal like this, but they seemed to manage doing it.

The dining tables had a sticky film on 'em too.  I guess they were cleaned, but the solvent or detergent they're using is either not the right stuff for the job or they're using old mop water to wipe the place down.
