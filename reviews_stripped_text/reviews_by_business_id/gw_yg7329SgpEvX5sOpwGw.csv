I was pleased to find the store had a solid offering of Eastern European and Russian foods.  I am not ashamed to admit that I am a Eastern European food addict.

Lucky for me, this place has the largest deli selection of any Eastern European store in Las Vegas.  The refrigerated cases have dozens of meats, salamis, sausages, cheeses, and salads.  They also offer a produce section that is refrigerated -- also a first for Las Vegas Eastern European stores (that I've seen).  They also offer baked goods from the awesome Natalia's Bakery located on Rainbow.

The packaged foods seemed mostly targeted to Russians, Bulgarians, and Hungarians.  I did see some familiar Polish stuff like Delicje and other Polish candies.   I was pleasantly surprised to find some frozen vareniki and pelmeni that I hope to try in the future.  And, dude, they have Dadu ice cream! DADU!!  It's the small things like this in life that make me happy. 

The shelves were a little bare in some places and I hope they fill them out soon with a bit more variety of packaged goods.  I'm excited by their potential but, unfortunately, they don't offer many of my ""can't-live-withouts."" I'll definitely be back to score some Dadu and to check out their progress.   Just keep opening the Euro markets and I'll keep shopping!",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,6,5,3,129wHeyK8qEB88cjfVoQ8Q

I have been shopping here for nearly three years and have always been greeted by smiling and friendly staff. This family owned shop makes amazing fresh breads, dips, kabobs, and lahmejun (Armenian meat flatbread).  Was recently inspired to write a review from this giant green salad I got along with some of my baked items.  It was huge and fresh.  The meats are great to take home for some BBQ or just have them grill the meat for only $1 more a pound.  They also have a great selection of European beers and wine you won't find anywhere else.  Some of my favorites here are the beef salamis and spicy sojouk, olives, cheeses (especially blue), carrot salad at the deli and sardines.  Yum!",PnWO1D9gnyJco9IGdRHjJQ,1,0,5,urO6R_ktzXTZAo31czMcIw

I LOVE this market!

I've only been a couple times, and have gotten several items from the meat counter and deli counter.  This place has everything Eastern European!  Home made dolmas, Vienna sausages, natural casing franks, all kinds of hard sausages and salamis, marinated meats, and every European side dish and condiment you could imagine.  I see a lot of Mediterranean and Hungarian items in there, but I'm not versed well enough in most of those cultures and languages to differentiate a lot of the items.

Needless to say, this is a gem of a Southwest find for anyone looking for those specialty items, or just some awesome goodies to throw on the grill!

Staff were present but did not offer any help. Register has a tip jar for cashiers, which I find tacky. Look for the half-off clearance cart by the front door.

If you've been to Jones Market in Chinatown, this is basically the same, except these workers here are way nicer! We got some Moscow ham and the lady asked us how thick we wanted the slices. After we told her thin, she did one slice and showed us and asked if it was ok. Not only that, instead of packing the meat in a plastic bag as most places do, she put it on a foam tray and wrapped it for us, even though we just got a measly half pound.

They also have a nice assortment of olives. :) There's also cheeses, sausages, caviar, even marinated meats and kabobs. There is a small produce section, and a lot of canned and jarred items from various countries. I was glad to find labne here. Not so hard to find in CA but didn't find any in Vegas. Also they have Dadu ice cream! I usually don't eat sweets, so I love these, not too sweet like American ice cream.

They have catered a few parties for us and delivered a few dinners too.  Our family loves their food. This evening we called to order dinner after 8:15. The woman who answered apologized very kindly and said it was too late which we totally understood since they do close at 9:00. We jumped in the car to grab fast food and before we left our driveway the woman called back and said they would be able to take our order and deliver to us.  She called their delivery driver and checked with their chef and then called us back!  THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!",4OB83KHfJ8y13mmxCiyJrg,0,0,5,R7AqB2xmrggORcktMN20pQ

Our favorite was the chicken shawarma as the flavoring was just perfect.  Everything else was just ok.  Going forward I would just drive a block down and stick with stephanoes for everything else.  Check out the added pictures.

Did I mentioned the chicken shawarma, it's amazing. You'll be happy if that's all you ordered.",u2jYb3GGDT2LuQt08xA6TQ,5,4,3,3Uho02X3P8PS7tw_yNHn9Q

I was referred to Ron's by a friend of mine, who also happens to be Arab-American, so I had high hopes. 

They had a decent assortment of meats and cheeses and their selection of spices was pretty good.  I found most of the things I was looking for and the people were nice.  

Being from Michigan, where there are entire sections of town filled with Arabic food stores, I wasn't overly impressed with this one.  But...considering there are few choices, I'm sure I'll be back here.  

I saw they have a restaurant as well, so next time I'll order some food and try it out.",ABrS2sgtZA1hSH3YTmNFPA,4,4,4,z0ZBUQ2xzDhaM18mqkMcog
4699333,2018-04-14,6,gw_yg7329SgpEvX5sOpwGw,"What a great find for my Eastern European food goodies! The store is very clean and the gentleman at the deli/meat counter is very helpful and knowledgeable. The cashier and workers are friendly too, but I think you just have to say hi first. Once they get to know you, they are so warm and helpful. 

I love the herring salad (aka herring-in-fur-coat salad) at the deli. It is a layered salad that has smoked herring on the bottom, shredded beets, shredded carrots, potato salad, diced eggs, and topped with a sprig of fresh dill. The gentleman informed me it is a traditional Russian salad that is usually served during New Year's Eve and served with vodka and beer. Luckily I don't have to wait until New Year's Eve for this yummy dish! The blinis are very tasty too. There is one that has a sweet cheese filling with is great cold or warmed up. The meat filled one is delicious. The ground meat filling is well seasoned. Not too salty or heavy on garlic. He advised me to warm it up on the pan and eat it with some sour cream and a sprinkle of pepper. I took his advice and loved it! The baba ganush and eggplant dip are good choices to keep in the fridge for snacking or a side dish too. They also have a to-go lunch area. You can order kabob and rice dishes and gyros while you do your shopping. That way you have food ready by the time you finish your grocery shopping. Yay!

They also have a good dairy selection of kefir drinks. Kefir is a type of yogurt like drink has probiotics before it was a health buzz word. Try the baked kefir if you find regular kefir too tart. It's creamy, super thick, and very filling. The baked version of kefir is called Ryazhenka-my favorite. They also have European brand bologna that I really enjoy and cannot find elsewhere since the other similar market is going under repairs. Their bakery section has a good selection of tiramisu and honey cake sold by weight. So you can get a big or small slice if you want. Lavash bread, rye bread, sweet breads, and cookies are available too. If you like pierogis, they have a freezer you can scoop out how much you want-which is also sold by weight. There is also an isle full of giftable chocolates. Be a good guest and grab one when you visit your friend or family. They will like it and you get to have some chocolate while you're visiting. Wink wink. 

All in all, I travel across town to get to these yummy delights. I can count on this place to stock up on these hard to find items and I found be the quality to be worth the drive. The prices are very reasonable and I am all for supporting local businesses. Give this place a try! You may find new favorites to add to your grocery staple!",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,16,15,5,v7DtH6IPzpic-y9UDJ_0gQ

It is divided into a restaurant and market.  I didn't have much time so I looked through the market aisles.  The market if filled with a wide variety of specialty foods for those who miss their European hometown foods or those looking to step outside their traditional meals.  I liked the deli and ability to get freshly cut meats and cheeses.  I will be going back just to continue to try new foods and expand my palate.,1PvDk9-siiBuDSt73Jgi-Q,1,2,4,UsaGaqqcNj-VUGsNJYJ7JA

The only problem is that English is obviously the second language for almost everybody who works here.  It was often very difficult to understand what folks were saying due to some very heavy Eastern European accents and I wasn't always sure they understood me.,8YaFdh5fGg-M6KPIHv7ivw,2,0,4,yyovSszS4_IRgQZb5fIukA

They seem to be offering mostly Eastern European foods which I'm not as familiar with as say German or Dutch food which is our familys culture. The one plus is the deli has some sausages and cheeses you won't find at any other grocer. 

It's far from me, but if I'm in the area, I'll definitely grab from the deli. I also saw they have European style mayo in a tube. My MIL has been looking for that and funny, but I think it would make a great stocking stuffer for her.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,4,4,n9F6KlpdugA8_9zGsZAqzQ
