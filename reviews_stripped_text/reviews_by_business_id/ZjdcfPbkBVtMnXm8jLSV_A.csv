Don't get me wrong, when I read greasy spoon, I knew I wasn't going to Hash House A Go Go... 

And I loved the out of the way location, the counter service and limited table service. I love the bustling cooks behind the counter. I loved it wasn't brand spanking new and sparkly clean...  

It felt lived in, visited, comfortable... In a wrong side of the tracks, been there forever, kind of way. Cool.
Yes, basically I wanted to LoVe this place...

But the food was on par with Denny's.  Meh.  I was hoping for something tastier.
The portions are huge.  
The pancakes had to be nine inches in diameter.  But they aren't anything special.  Think Denny's.  Nothing to write home about... and they aren't served with butter.  You get a few 'whipped spread' containers.  Boo.
The bacon was crispy decent.
The sausage was meh.
The eggs, nothing special. 
Toast came pre-spread with that whipped margarine like spread. Yuck. 
The home fried potatoes were okay.  The potatoes were my hubby's favorite part of the meal.

I did like the friendliness of the staff.
And considering the cleanliness of the diner, the restrooms were pristine.

I am surprised at the many four star reviews.  But still kinda happy this little place is in business.  :  )",0koJ8HNgTDeSoz83rxrlgw,0,0,2,Pg4Agux2HK-8aYXc2uao1g

We all had the chicken fried steak with mashed potatos and corn. This was not the ground beef made into a patty that is breaded and then fried, this was an actual steak breaded then fried! I was in HEAVEN! We all cleaned out plates with only one party foul and that was Steve dropping food on his shirt on his first bite while he was trying too hard to get it in his mouth because it smelled so dang good.

One can only imagine what this place looked like back in the day before the shadow of the Stratosphere fell upon it.  The downtown revitalization is alive and well this far south of the strip.  The one thing I am sure has not changed is the charm and character of Tiffany's.

Walking through the door and surveying the area, it has that endearing greasy spoonish feel and smell.

Basic is the menu but basic is not the taste.  I ordered up the chicken fried steak (CFS).  So tender was this amazing morsel, I could cut it with a spoon.  The gravy (obviously home made) was a dirty sort of color indicative of southern cooking I have experienced in the past. The potatoes are are not hash browns, and to home fried but special.  

The cook/breakfast chef has been cooking for fifty something years and if memory serves thirty-three years at Tiffany's.  He brought out the steak used to make the CFS and talked about the care that went into it's preparation.  They were lovely pieces of meat.

I ate here with a friend recently and made the unfortunate decision to sit at the counter.  This meant I could watch them cook my food.  The same server who poured our drinks, cleared dirty tables, wiped down countertops, etc., was the same one who touched food (sandwich components, rolls, vegetables, etc.) with her BARE hands.  Not once did we see her wash her hands.  She placed a dinner roll on a plate with her bare hands after handling cash and coins from the cash register, and then brought it to me.  She started slicing a cucumber, quit briefly to wipe a dirty table with a rag, and then went right back to the cucumber without washing her hands.

The main cook was scrubbing down the filthy stove with his bare hands, all while flipping sandwiches and burgers.  

I did see another customer wash his hands; he stepped right behind the counter to do so.  Too bad staff don't take a cue from him!

The food was inedible.  I didn't expect much from a diner inside of a drugstore in a bad neighborhood near the Strip, but really, this was awful.  The mashed potatoes were instant, gravy was cold, and the ""vegetables"" were canned carrots so overcooked they fell through my fork.  My friend didn't touch his grilled cheese or his fries.

It's not as cheap as you think.  A meal plus drink will set you back around $11 or $12, including tax but not tip.  Considering that you won't be able to eat most of it, and you'll get sick afterwards, this is not a bargain.

I don't think I could get drunk enough to eat here ever again.  The only people who eat here are ""locals"" (the kind who will ask you if you have spare change) and food snobs who read about this place in Frommer's and think they're getting something cheap and authentic.",8SN6B3cUKkonmN2WEabjyA,3,0,1,6-vBQC4HC69Lf6kZJg3OkQ

Breakfast w/ my wife and two kids was over $30.00 w/out tip, and I wouldn't of minded the price if the food was better and it wasn't hot as Hades inside the place. We kept it simple: Eggs over-easy, bacon and toast, an order of biscuits and gravy and coffee and to be honest w/ you the whole experience was a letdown.

My wife and I both agreed that the portion size was decent, but the execution of the meal itself was poor and the taste was bland, I even found the coffee to be bland. The eggs were too runny and the bacon my wife had and the sausage I had were overcooked and just seemed to be lacking.  I don't doubt that the place might have better offerings; but sadly,unless you're a regular/local I can't see venturing out of your hotel for this place being worth it.

I wanted to like Tiffany's, and it's got a lot of that old Vegas diner, beyond the Strip vibe, but there's no getting around the fact that the surrounding area leaves a lot to be desired.

-Server was fairly rude. I don't mean 'not nice', I mean condescending, unhelpful, generally void of any hospitable qualities. 

-It's hard to mess up breakfast food, so it was average. Potatoes were plain, sausage tasted funny, maybe it had been frozen? Eggs were eggs. Buttered toast was buttered toast. 

-Room temperature liquid creamer packets. Ketchup in a plastic bottle that tasted and looked unusual. 

My GF decided to just wait in the car after she sat down and got a look at the place. She's a germ-a-phoebe. Me? I'll eat half of a weird tasting sausage patty and like it the best I can.

Portion sizes are generous. We ordered the Spanish Omelet, which my boss stated tasted like an ""Italian Omelet,"" but not bad. Ham Steak and Eggs, which was reported as tasty, and the girl who ordered it wasn't able to finish it. Another girl ordered the New York Steak and Eggs, medium rare, or as she put it, ""Now, I don't want that too red, but I want a little red. But don't you go burning that steak, I don't want it charred. You take care of that steak now..."" The last girl ordered pancakes. No complaints. I ordered the corn beef has with three eggs sunny side up. So the hash was greasy spoon has, the eggs were a bit on the raw side, and the potatoes we all agreed had an interesting taste. So, we were all able to get our food down. 

In other words. It is a greasy spoon, the prices were reasonable, and they let us pay on separate checks with no trouble. That was great.

What could have been better. The floors could have been cleaner. Just because the foods greasy doesn't mean the floor has to be.

Also, our waitress was memorable not only for her kindness, but also for her strong odor that was not very well masked by her strong perfume. I had no problem with it personally, but some people might.

Finally, the prices for food are reasonable, but the drinks are pretty pricey. Three bucks for coffee? Stick to water and get a Starbucks later...

Why?  Because it's hard to find a true greasy spoon diner in Las Vegas.  Sure, there are places all over down that can put eggs on a griddle or serve up a greasy burger, but most are tucked away in a strip mall and few, if any, have a old time soda fountain counter for patrons to sit at.

The waitstaff is awesome and attentive.  The burgers aren't the greatest thing you'll ever taste, but remember this is a diner.  For a diner, they are serving up a quality burger with the just the right ratio of grease and cheese blended into the bun.  

If you've got time some morning, take a seat at the counter and have a simple, great breakfast off the griddle.  They do eggs right with some crispy bacon.  Thumbs up.

My friends and I got there around 10 one night, and we were the only customers there. We sat up at the counter, and got greeted right away. 

First thing the three of us notice? His gloves. He's wearing gloves,... but with the fingers cut off. Finger less playtex gloves. WHAT? He cooked with the gloves. He washed his hands in those gloves. Actually, 'washed' is the wrong word. He didn't even do that... he rinsed his hands. 

He SMOKED in those gloves. Yep. Keep in mind that sitting at the counter, you have a full view of the back kitchen. Right after our cook/server was done cooking our food.. he went into the back kitchen area and lit a cigarette along with some other guy, who I think was the delivery driver. WHAT?!? Who just smokes in the kitchen of a restaurant? Super unsanitary. 

Food wise, it was bleh. I got the chicken fried steak - as it's still my mission to find the best in Vegas. It was pretty tasteless and chewy - the gravy wasn't bad though. One friend got the hot pastrami. The cook took a little package out of the freezer and then proceeded to microwave it for five minutes. Threw it on the grill for a minute and put it in between a couple pieces of bread. My other friend got a burger. It was so so. Nothing special, nothing too bad. 

Would I come here again? Not if it's the same guy cooking. Smoking in the kitchen? Please. He could easily step outside to enjoy his cigarette. I like to go drinking downtown, and it's one of the few places open late. So, I'll probably end up there again - if I can get myself drunk enough.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,5,1,1,y_Ta_f6SCymOvPuvJAE8Rg

I had the chicken salad sandwich.

Hot mess.

My chicken ""salad"" was nothing more than chopped up deli meat (I don't even know if it was chicken, it kinda tasted like crab salad) swirled together with mayonaise. The sandwich was on plain wheat bread and included soggy tomatoes and white lettuce. I will never understand why restaurants put white lettuce on anything, no one wants to eat that crap!

The worst part, the menu said the sandwich came with a side of ""potato"". I assumed they meant potato chips, but they meant mashed, potato salad or home fries. I opted for the mashed potatoes. 

I was expecting a small side of mashed potatoes, a nice little single serving. Nope. They gave me a full PINT of mashed potatoes. Completely ridiculous. 

The service was about as uninspiring as the food. We specifically asked when placing our order if they take cards. We were told yes, but when the delivery driver showed up he said he's only taking cash. We told him when we ordered we said we're paying with a card and he repeated that he was only taking cash.

I stopped here for breakfast yesterday and I was glad I did.  I had been going to eat at the Huntridge, but the food operation there is permanently closed I was told.  So, off to Tiffany's for me.

I had the Spanish Omelette.  A nice omelette with jalapeño slices, green pepper, cubed tomato with cheese on top.  Accompanying that  was a generous portion of home fries and rye toast.  I added some Tabasco my server brought before bringing my breakfast, and I had a spicy and flavorful omelette.

While sitting there sipping my coffee, I noticed a sign on the wall from 2005 noting the place would be closed for a couple of weeks for the shooting of a movie.  The sign had Robert Duvall's autograph.  I asked the server what the movie was and she told me it was ""Lucky You.""  I Googled and saw it was a movie with a poker playing plot that had been shot on location in Las Vegas.  Well I knew that having breakfast at Tiffany's was not going to be the movie thing, but it turned out to be a different movie.

I'm glad I stopped in.  It's good to support a local business!

4409645,2010-09-16,6,ZjdcfPbkBVtMnXm8jLSV_A,"It was my last night in town. Since my g/f had the night off- the timeliest new statistic for unemployment- she was able to spend a lot of time with me before I had to leave. And to think we kept worrying she'd have to work thru my last request visits.

Tiffany's is actually located inside White Cross drug store. People say it's a sketchy part of the neighborhood. At least people that get custard recommendations from Craig Ferguson. (Luv It's is diagonal across the street behind the AM/PM.) There's always security walking around inside. Tiffany's used to be Liberty diner. And White Cross Drugs has been around so long, in the 50's and 60's it was known as a hangout for celebrities and showgirls after their shows. There were more businesses in the area and the residences were pretty high end back then. The Good Neighbor Pharmacy was even a bigger chain, as big as Woolworth's. I first discovered this place (and the newly opened Art Bar) when I used to live down Oakey and took this path to get to Industrial to get to the back Forum shops parking. 

Somehow, we weren't even going to go here, as it was daylight out. We usually have late night eats here, most likely on the way home from somewhere near Fremont Street. We tried Battista's for my last dinner, but we got there at an early 4:00PM and they weren't even open. We decided there was no better place to go than Breakfast at Tiffany's, mostly known as Tiffany's. I've often called it Louie's, for the chef who's there just about every night we've ever went. Everyone who's been there knows who I'm talking about. Well we were too early to see him, too. So I believe it was only the second time I had a chef that wasn't Louie. 

They have a pretty decent sized menu, breakfast 24 hours. They have nightly dinner specials listed on their chalkboard. Ask for a to go/ delivery menu, it has all the specials written on it for each night. Pictures of Tiffany's pops up quite a bit in the most of the free publications in town. At least I always recognize it when someone does a story on service, dining out, etc. They filmed a movie here too that escapes my mind, with Drew Barrymore? Never saw the movie. They have pictures of it posted up for it over the soda fountain area. You pass by a cake/ pie cooler when you walk in. We decided to go back later that night for pie, since I actually made something.

The food is always filling, there are always generous portions that seem to overflow the oval plates no matter what we get. My favorites are spaghetti, the Manhattan burger (I pay extra to add mushrooms). They have a mushroom burger, but not on sourdough. Omelets are always filling, but I can never finish the potatoes. The spaghetti is huge, I always get that knowing I want half for breakfast the next day. I've had over 2/3 the menu.  

I've had so many great times at Tiffany's. I've gone after First Fridays, which is where I must have the most drinking stories from. I've had many meals with my g/f there. They just started posting up pics of people eating there. I'm there, tough to say where. One of the paintings even has their own group I'm a member of on facebook. It's a river like scene and in the middle of it, for some unknown reason is Clint Eastwood from Josey Wales. I brought so many friends here, they have to pass some sort of initiation to be brought here. It's like a secret fishing spot, but eventually you want everyone you know to come. 

We went later that night after walking around Fremont street one more time, taking tons of pictures. We had coffee, pie and cake. We had another friend with us. We took a lot of pictures. I presented Louie with a framed picture for the restaurant that I hope he put up on the menu wall. He was a little surprised, I don't know if he took it home? Let me know if you see it. You'll know. It has a lot of meaning from there.

I've had many deep conversations dining here, with a lot of my closest friends. I've been here drunk as hell to recover. Most everyone who's been to Dino's or OG has staggered in here. I've been here when I had nowhere else to go. I've had this as my last meal before celebrating new years downtown. I've had lazy nights here with my g/f where we just sit and read the weekly's from the stands by the door. One of the reasons I loved our apartment so much was that it was about 10 minutes away. Delivery? Never even occurred to us, we wanted to go, we had to BE there. In that atmosphere.

Thank you Louie for all the great food! I'm sure my mother wants to meet the man that kept me well fed all those years.",zulBnf95Ji1_LAcQKyhi8w,6,6,5,d7NEPW8-E05tvt5VSwjl-w
4451991,2012-03-06,0,ZjdcfPbkBVtMnXm8jLSV_A,"So I've been meaning to try Tiffany's for a long time. I really was never sure where it was, although I knew from reading other reviews that it was inside the White Cross Drugs. Well, I was a bit apprehensive as I walked in the door, but there it was in all its glory - the greasy spoon diner that is Tiffany's!! Oh how I wish I had come here sooner, because in Las Vegas... how often is it you can walk into a TRUE greasy spoon diner? 

I ordered to go, and the waitress was more than happy to get me my food going real quick. It wasn't busy though, and I saw the chefs hop right on my order. I got the Tiffany burger - cheese, bacon, grilled onions, mushrooms, tomato, and lettuce. For the boyfriend I got the Mushroom burger. Both burgers came with yummy thick-cut fries. 

Luckily my house isn't TOO far from Tiffany's so when I got the burgers and fries home they were still pretty much like they just came off the line. Let me tell you - the burgers are MASSIVE! Neither my boyfriend or I could finish ours and we both had them the next day for lunch.

The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the cash only policy. I know, it's a diner, I should have been aware AND there is a sign posted on the wall - but these days it's just so weird to come across a place that won't take a card. I never, ever carry cash and had to go use the ATM inside White Cross Drugs. I also felt like a dummy for not having cash after the waitress brought me my food, but oh well. 

Will I be back? Yes, I hope so! I'd definitely like to check out their breakfast items!",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,4,RcAa9khEuXY3Wai5ua1eaw

It was a Saturday night in Vegas and I was hungry. I could always find a ramen place over off Spring Mountain but sometimes you just want good solid food. No fuss, eat and beat it type fare that fills your stomach and doesn't come with Strip pricing. Tiffany's hit the spot. 

From the outside to some it may look sketchy as it's next to White Cross Drugs which is closed. Ignore that, park and step inside to a bit of old school Vegas. I was there after midnight and had the privilege of having my food made by Louie. He's got 35 years of experience and when you park your butt at the counter and watch the man go, you know he knows what he's doing. He's a man on a mission to get your food done fast, and done right, and he's all business. 

All that aside, how's the food? Many claim to make omelets, and many suck at doing so. Not Louie, not at Tiffany's on this night. The man cranked out a Denver omelet that was perfect. I forgot to change the order from hash browns, which I hate...but his hash browns got more than a couple bites from me. I won't order them again but they certainly didn't suck. I got a choice of several kinds of bread for my toast, and the sourdough hit the spot. Top it all off with 100% Valencia orange juice, and my late night Breakfast at Tiffany's was awesome. 

I was the only one there for a few minutes, but when business picked up Louie stepped up his game and turned into a 1 man show that could flat slam out the food. And the people that came in cleaned their plates...

4 Strong Stars...I'll need a second visit to give them the coveted 5. But I will say Tiffany's has made it onto my list of late night options for good places to eat.

So much so that I kept watching the door anticipating the arrival of Arthur Fonzarelli ( Fonzi ) from Happy Days .

The burger is definitely for the burger lover .. very meaty and a good grade of beef. After chompin into the side order of fries ,  I was able to finally understand the 'greasy spoon' concept. Yes.. They don't hold back there but it was still edible and not too, too bad as far as the level of grease.

The interior was as, uh, old school as the surrounding area but when we sat down the waitress was attentive and friendly. We all really enjoyed our food - it was basic, greasy, homey food that makes for a perfect hangoer remedy. 

I got the breakfast special with two eggs, two pieces of bacon, and two pancakes - the pancakes were a perfect, just-right crispyness and golden brown and the bacon was nice and thick. I got my eggs over easy and they were cooked right as well. My boyfriend got the steak-fried chicken I believe, and the home fries looked delicious.

I left a message, and called back the following morning. He had called in sick. So I wrote them via their contact email, trying to resolve this issue. I still haven't heard back.

I can only assume that given the fact the rest of our party was taken care of, and when we asked for service they said they 'couldn't do that' and that they'd 'send someone over to help' us, that they were saying they didn't serve 'our kind'.",IR4FMen2WFlQ8RRq-i7TMA,0,1,1,-oiK8rGYG2ksNwURV6Wyhw

12 of us showed up in a staggered formation - first five, then three, then four, and the waitress was friendly and (mostly) efficient, although she did forget one of the early arrivals meals.  Fortunately, she quickly fixed the situation.

I ordered the onion rings, 21 shrimp dinner, large dinner salad, and iced tea.  The onion rings were perfect.  The shrimp tasted previously frozen, and the salad was from a diner.

I want to try to go back for the legendary pancakes!",S5PjcgOoIZ67aeV1tRoLTw,0,0,4,mLLTV9dDAesMaHWQlETTlw

The B&G were served on a stale biscuit that had been doused with oil. The gravy had almost no indication of sausage and literally tasted like nothing. The eggs were not seasoned at all and tasted as though I was licking the flat top. The trout was decent but also not seasoned and nothing to write home about. There were many bones left in as well. My BF ordered the chicken fried steak and he thought it was ok. The only way I would dine here again is if I were wasted with with a group of friends who insisted on eating here. And then I would order something like chicken strips or toast. REALLY YUCKY!",bsGdvFTKVylGoZjX1u_pCg,0,0,1,0oHj01XmsGTl00AANS2P7w

I always go there when I want corn beef hash  for breakfast! It is the absolute best. If you are local try it! You will like it.,BCvBvDBD82OFrhz8n-yGUA,0,0,4,ulspdMoo9YrKW3u2badT7A
5727225,2012-03-04,0,ZjdcfPbkBVtMnXm8jLSV_A,"I just had another yummy, greasy burger at Tiffany's. We went tonight because I heard rumors that the Drug Store it is in is closing on Monday and therefore (I assume), Tiffany's will close too! The staff inside seemed to know nothing about the impending closure, so I hope it is a false rumor! Nonetheless, I suggest you all go here quick-it wouldn't hurt! I highly recommend the Manhattan Burger or the Tiffany Burger (had the Tiffany tonight). I recommend them medium-rare-it is greasier that way, but much more delicious! Enjoy it while you can....",FhkZk24n_Dh-pVLpBKUwEw,0,0,5,A7F4hDxdWrLpygCm1qSjzw

The only thing difficult about writing this review is that I am right here right now eating the Greek omelette. It's a challenge to give props while devouring my fare of comfort foods.
The atmosphere is the metropolitan origination of a mid city diner.
According to this local: It's THE best place to bring the late night tourist crowd to see what happens in Vegas..... after hours. 
What happens at Tiffany's is Louie's good cooking!",h4X30KkTuSOX9hxmZDsNZQ,0,1,5,s0o9dJQN9aQ6QYlMvQxG6g

Yep finally made it here to check it out!

Service was awesome, we were spoiled beyond belief!

Great convo with the employees, refills galore and the most important factor...GREAT FOOD.

I got corned beef hash, 3 eggs, country potatoes and sourdough toast, $7.50 for a huge breakfast. Add coffee, mmmm and it was good, Farmer Brothers coffee!

My friend got a grilled bacon and cheese sandwich on wheat with fries, was also very good.

We had a blast sitting at the counter, talking and chowing down!

We will be back for sure!

Greasy spoon in it's glory! Love it!
