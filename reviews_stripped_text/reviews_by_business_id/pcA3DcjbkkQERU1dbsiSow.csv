I have been in Chickpeas restaurant in the past 7 months many times both for lunch and dinner. Some times with friends and relatives. We will go back whenever we have the opportunity. The restaurant is clean, very friendly atmosphere, excellent food and prices are very reasonable. Recently, they revised their menu. Excellent selection of tasty foods.
We have been there with freinds and relatives, they love to go back there too; they really have enjoyed it.
This resturant has a great menu, Pizzas, Mediterranean, and Persian dishes, as well as fresh pastries and bread that they bake every few hours. Highly recommended.",QEEhwHgUQ5pqN9CauP4vkw,0,0,5,89M55dH94FuIqHnFuAuS0g

The Cashier did not take the time or courtesy to explain to me when I ordered that the lunch special comes with one strip of kabob and to get a second one I could have paid a mere two dollars more, the only thing the cashier said was to mix and match I'd have to order off the standard menu, when I asked the cashier if I could pay the additional charge in order to get the second strip of meat as the price of $9.99 he said NO, you have to order another new order?! I was disappointed and it was not like the place was busy, the restaurant was empty around noon , the food was good but disappointed with the service and lack of care for the customer",nd9Zs0viCYCSNxw1wWl9mQ,0,0,2,9ePuZ521G1FOcRamJyCR_A

Was gonna kill the 20 min wash time with another doob so I started to walk around the strip mall, passing some random flooring place so weird bar Asian barbecue which almost tempted me but then I saw these words...


CHICKPEAS. 

Fuck yeah the best decision I made this day while barely functioning. Creamy hummus warm pita...

Served by cuties I was in heaven. College football playing...This is THE hangout spot when guys running errands and his girl and her family's is back at home and he literally has a 20 minute why cycle before he has to get back in dry the whites.

It came with a good amount of basmati rice, one grilled tomato, and a nice crisp salad with sliced tomatoes, cucumbers and red beets. I especially love their savory homemade dressing. Since then I have tried another item like their Chicken Schawarma plate, serve with a generous portion of marinated chicken, basmati rice, sliced tomatoes and cucumbers.

Yes my cheat days seem healthy to most...but we eat oil free so this was a cheat day.

We ordered a huge delivery and it was A-Ok.

Huge portions, fresh food and overall yummy tastes.

Hummus was on the oily side but it was creamy and not toooo much garlic. Don't get me wrong I love garlic, but too much in hummus can cause indigestion.

The falafel would be best not delivered but eaten fresh on site. Yes its the green kind but it seemed hand formed inside of the machine ball or tool ball way.

The tabouli salad was super yummy to me, lots of green onion, which was different. 

The baba was not as smoky as other places. Hubs normally does not like it but he tried this and liked it!

Ikra was yum, hubs didn't like the smoky flavor of it but I did!

All and all I would rank it in my top three of Vegas. Hubs said its better than Amena...but I beg to differ. Amena will always have me heart!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,8,7,3,VuftefdVfdNeT2rW2gpi0A

The food was not as good as the reviews say and the service was horrible.
First off, the salad wasn't bad tasting but it was more of an Asian flavor than middle eastern, so it didn't really go well with the kabobs. 
Second I asked for the kabobs well done, not burned, well done. The guy looked at me like I was nuts. One side was not cooked and the other side was burned. I also asked to have the tomato well and that wasn't cooked through either. If you ask to have your food cooked well done, there shouldn't be any attitude about it, especially when you're a paying customer. 
I would advice the owner to make sure his employees not give attitude to customers and for them to learn how to cook food properly.

Was in town and just had to visit this place again. Just like the last time, great service and food and doesn't disappoint. 
I ordered a greek salad on the side and the feta cheese was so fresh, moist and yummy! Which was probably fresh and UNpasteurized which unfortunately I cannot have right now. So went back inside (was sitting at the outside patio) and asked the employees. They said it should but seemed to question it themselves. As I sat back outside, one of the employees came back and said to be on the safe side, I probably shouldn't eat it and was happy to bring it back and make me a brand new one without the feta. That was awesome how careful and sweet they were. Can't wait to come back and eat it with the feta cheese next time when I finally can!

Note: Salad was yummy but not the traditional greek flavor which is more vinegary & garlicky. Instead it does have more of an asian soy saucy flavor. Still really yummy but then again, I'm asian so it prob taste yummier to me then to some people.

--------------

Was craving Mediterranean and decided to give this place a try and so glad I did! For the price you pay the portion itself is unbelievable. Most other places are pretty generic in portions and cost. The plate was $10 here so i assumed it was like most other places and my goodness the plate was enough to feed 2 people! (See pictures)

We ordered the ground beef and chicken skewer mix plate which comes with a side bowl of salad. The meat was flavorful and tender. Not dry at all. The salad was also a generous portion and their dressing was delicious! Simple yet flavorful. The rice I will have to say is the only thing that could be a little better. It wasn't flavored enough or shall I say enough butter like a lot of places do but in exchange, its much healthier that way. So I don't mind.
We also ordered the chicken shawarma plate and it was charred perfectly. They have their own tahini sauce recipe that atop the shawarma plate. By itself, it tasted a bit plain and bitter with a nutty twist to it but the sauce goes with the chicken wonderfully! I even asked for extra sauce on the side.

They also make pizza too (and they have a huge pizza oven as well) which is out of ordinary but since I didn't order any can't rate much on that. Maybe next time.

Service:
They were great. It think its a family owned operation. It does take a little time to prep your food but thats with most Mediterranean style restaurants and they were all working hard. I did hope they would have warned me how big their portions were so we could've ordered differently. 

Ambiance:
A little small shop with a little outdoor patio seating area thats pretty nice. Parking is plenty thats in a plaza. I will totally come back again!!",qpActPt-ts9RRiZvn0n2KA,1,1,5,7Cyy2xNQ5DblnJ5PzeRmVw

Menu has all the usual favorites: shwarma, tabouli, hummus, pita. Meats are available as plates, sandwiches, or (allegedly) on salads. They also offer breakfast.

I was thrilled to see Oliviet (Russian potato salad) on the menu! Unfortunately they were out of it on my most recent visit. Menu has no clear appetizers section- cashier had some difficulty adding a small order of falafel, as the menu only offers it as a plate or sandwich. Ordering ""Greek salad with chicken shwarma"" got me a side salad and a shwarma wrap, which isn't what I had in mind (salad topped with meat).

Ordering issues and new-opening kinks aside, the space is clean and organized. The falafel is soft and flavorful inside, but could be a bit crisper on the outside. It came with an ample portion of tahini sauce. The greek salad was tasty (heads up that it's pre-dressed) and the veggies were fresh.

I came in at 7:30 pm to place order to go . There was one guy waiting for his order . I ordered the Chicken Soltani Kabob plate and a Lamb Shawarma Sandwich . There were two ladies working to counter and later I saw another lady come from the back . One must have been new because you could tell she needed lots of help . Two men came in after me and sat down after ordering , then another man who came by himself , then another for a takeout . The two men got their bowl , then the one man got his plate and the lady looked at me and said mine was almost done . They then gave the other his takeout . 30 minutes and I finally got my food . When I got home , my son and I shared the food . 

The rice was very good , the chicken barg was good but not the ground chicken , and then the lamb . The lamb was overcooked and tough and I mean tough . The pita was very thick also . It came with a salad with the plate and fries with the sandwich .

However, we were pleasantly surprised by the ample portions and the very fresh taste. We ordered the kabob plate and really enjoyed them and the salad was amazing. We definitely left feeling like we had enough food after sharing one meal.

First, I can say there is no such thing as a SMALL at chickpeas.  Their servings size is great because - well - who doesn't love GREAT hummus?

And it was GREAT.  Perfect blend of chickpeas, tahini, lemon and garlic. 

I really wanted a Mazza lunch platter and 2 kebobs but found out from the web site I could not order that.  I was bummed so I ordered a Greek Salad with chicken and the Mazza and shared.  More than enough food for 3-4 people. 

The only thing they can maybe take away from me is I would love the option of a Mazza with 2 kebobs.",ks-THNW260klKVtl4-BQVQ,0,0,5,8brD-Je11Z2rhvS37EsSeg

I ended up getting the ground chicken kabob special. Talk about getting thrown for loop when I got my food. I was thinking chicken on skewer. Or for the most part all the times I have had Mediterranean food that use to. The cut of chicken may vary but it looks like chicken. Not that this kabob does not have chicken. IT does just grounded up mixed with have no idea. It form like long stick length just like kabob (no skewer deal with....plus). Odd. The flavor be honest not that bad. It nice moist, taste like chicken, and just different approach. The salad that comes with it refreshing basic salad greens tossed with house dressing. I like the fact it hearty with cucumbers, red onions, and couple nice roasted roma tomato. The rice pilaf is cooked perfect. It just plain rice not seasoned just fyi. The amount of food you get for lunch special it awesome deal! I know for under ten dollars even with drink walked out full. 

The inside is much nicer then the outside or that little shopping mall. The tables and chairs are really nice. Not what I expect of small restaurant in small shopping mall. They have nice little outdoor patio with plants around and nice outdoor weather great spot for lunch or dinner. Inside they have one nice widescreen that can watch your favorite game or am sure you can ask change the channel. The kitchen is open kitchen so if want entertainment while waiting right there. They even deliver but do charge $3-5 depending on the miles away. 

Not sure if was the owner but one of the guys in the back handed out samples of two different hummus. One was yellow and the other red. Not sure if they plan on putting it on the menu or could have been on the menu. Honestly just had my focus on the lunch specials. lol!! It was nice of the guy hand out little dixie cup samples. The yellow not fan but the red was really good. Hopefully the next time go back they have it on the menu. The whole staff was awesome. The gentlemen took my order to the guy handed out the sample and ask make sure give him feedback. I love that about small business owners. They appreciate customer feedback!!!

The falafel in the platter was very good as well as the hummus. I have had better baba ghanoush; but taste is subjective. The bread is very tasty as well and is similar to Lebanese bread or pita. 


For the lunch special the portion size is well worth the money. The rice is good and the chicken is very tender and well flavored. The lunch special also comes with a standard side salad. I just wish a different vinaigrette was offered besides balsamic. Perhaps a pomegranate molasses dressing would be a bit more tasty and compliment the chicken.

Lamb shank: straight to the trash you go. The lamb tasted very old, rubbery, dry and gamey. To make the dish even worse, they included rice that was seasoned so heavily it was like someone mowed a lawn and dumped it in their rice cooker. (How can a restaurant screw up rice?!?!)

Chicken Wing Kabob: the menu said it was ""marinated""... I have strong doubts. There was little flavor and the meat was very overcooked. Far below average, do not recommend. 

Lamb Pizza: I picked off the lamb after my encounter with the lamb shank and just ate the cheese and bread. It was acceptable. 

Greek Salad: So close to passable. The vegetables were fresh unfortunately, they didn't peel off the outer layer of the onion so I got to take out the skin before eating. Maybe they got busy?

There is little worse than cold lamb chops made to travel 30 minutes while their hummus compatriot does the opposite and gets too warm to be trustworthy. I was SO pleasantly surprised! Not only were our lamb chops and kofte delicious, they were cooked to temp per our request, and made it to my house hot and perfect. What we got for my hard earned bucks was well worth it, and the hummus was outstanding! Just the right amount of tahini, lemon, and garlic; simply yummy!

The food was mediocre - I got the beef shawarma sandwich and by sandwich i mean in a wrap. I literally had to dig for the beef. it was 98% salad 2% meat. and their salad was bland, limp and tasteless. I even deconstructed and poured tzatziki all over it. didn't help. 
My lunch date had the Lamb Shawarma. He let me try the rice which i thought was the best of what we ordered.  The portion on the plate was large again mostly the salad and the rice though you could see his lamb. 

Phat Phriendly: 
Inside comfortable seating. They have a lovely patio that comes with a HUGE honking warning sign - Furniture only holds up to 200lbs. Sit at your own risk. guess that cleared that up.

We had the tabouli, shirazi, cucumber salads, baba ganouj, hummus, tzatziki, kash-k-bademjan, as part of two Mazza plates. 

This was followed by several kabob dishes that we shared: ground beef, ground chicken, chicken  breast, and filet of beef kabob.

All dishes were freshly prepared on the grill in front of our eyes. We ate heartily, and took home leftovers, as portions are large. The meats were all tender and juicy, even the chicken breast.

Starters all are made in house and fresh (we asked). Recipes are simple and authentic. Nothing tastes pre-made or frozen here. We didn't try the pizza, but they have a legit wood stone oven like I've seen in some high end restaurants.

The place is kept clean, not like the dingy middle eastern places I'm used to. The menu is displayed on large monitors, iPad based payment system that is modern.

On our last visit, it seemed that the prices had been lowered.  That, and the absence of diners on a Saturday night, make me think that you'd better get there soon if you want to try it.  

Hubby wanted the barley soup he had last time, but they were out of it, so he got lentil instead.  Loved it.  

We ordered the mezze platter to start, and could not believe what we got for $6:  good-sized portions of hummus, babaganoush, and tzatziki, along with two falafel, tomato and cucumber salad, tons of olives, and two large stuffed grape leaves.  If we had stopped there, we would have been fine.  We did stop mid-way, because we also had ordered a ground mixed kabob, which came with salad and enough rice to feed all of Monaco.  They brought us two salads, each huge, and with tomatoes that were actually red!

Everything was fresh and delicious.  We took home so much food that we had dinner for two the next night.  That's when we had the grape leaves.  I never could stand them before, but these were incredible.

That's why receiving cold chicken was so perplexing.. Had it been sitting there already? Receiving cold chicken in a manner that fast, was akin to going into a bathroom nobody has been in, but the toilet seat is mysteriously warm.   

What's up with that?

Also, the hummus was warmer than the chicken, and was also extremely oily. Luckily I didn't order it, but they felt the need to throw some in. At first I thought it was a nice little bonus or gift, but after getting it, it's obvious they can't sell the stuff. 

Finally after an ordeal, they refunded 25% of my check.. yay.   

UPDATE:
I see the owner responded with an explanation of the cold chicken that at least makes sense. I will give this place another chance in the future, because it does seem like a lot of others are very happy with it.",6Yj3AqBD45SxXChKt35SAQ,0,0,2,iiozj6lWbzCFrbai70T4rQ

5228682,2015-11-17,2,pcA3DcjbkkQERU1dbsiSow,"We stopped in to Chickpeas early on Saturday, for a light snack before disc golfing.

The inside is simple, and clean, although a bit confusing...with the counter set up, it has the feel of a fast food joint, but the tables and chairs, and actual plates/silverwear give it a sit down restaurant feel.  

We ordered the shawarma: falafel for me, chicken for my fella.  

It came with a small, light salad;  lettuce, cucumbers, and tomato tossed in a super light dressing:  This was good.  I don't even like cucumbers and tomato, and I enjoyed this.  

The sharwarma sandwich wraps are enormous! So much for eating light!!   
The falafel was absolutely perfect.  Seasoned well, not greasy, very flavorful.  The pita was great too!
Can I mention the chicken wrap?  Because it is FULL of chicken.  Unlike other places that skimp on meat, and fill the pita with lettuce, etc, this was CHICKEN.  And its GOOD chicken too.  Tender, juicy, cooked really well...A+!!

So, if the experience was so good, why not 5 stars?  Well, service was polite, but I think we confused her...when ordering the shawarma sandwich, we wanted everything (hummus, tahini, garlic sauce, and the onions/lettuce, etc) except baba ganoush.  
We didn't get any hummus, or tahini, or garlic sauce at all on the wrap. 

It was still delicious, but we both REALLY wanted those things on the wrap.  

We'll be trying it again, for sure...I thought I saw that they deliver, so that definitely might have to happen!!

All in all, it was a great first experience...just next time remember my hummus!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,4,3,4,NJztVEuzFCt4Kmty0L7NZA

Persian food? In Vegas? No way this will be close to authentic, much less good.

Everyone here not only is happy to serve you and do their job well, the pride in their culture comes out in their food. Perfectly proportioned seasoning in every dish, giant servings, and well-informed servers who clearly want you to enjoy yourself.

Its a fast and casual restaurant where you go up to the counter to pay first and then they'll bring the food out to you. The place isn't too big but there's also patio seats outside. The place was pretty clean, also - which is always a good sign. 

As soon as we walked in the girl with glasses at the counter sort of just looked at us really quick and just went back to talking to a co-worker. -_-
We didn't get a hello or anything. Made our way to the counter to order and all she says is ""What can I get you?"" Yeah, hello to you too. I'm fine, thanks. 

She looked like she hated her job more than life itself. I ignored it because I was starving and just wanted some food. 

Ordered the ground beef kabob for dine in. I was hoping to avoid anymore contact with the girl at the counter but she brought out our food. I was hoping she would be a little nicer this time but nope! ""Here."" And then she threw our plates down on the table. ""Need anything else?"" 

It came out pretty quickly and I was amazed at the portions. It filled me up pretty well and had nice flavor to it. 

Overall, the food here is pretty good...too bad the service is shit. It disappoints me to write such a bad review based on one person - as I've seen other people that have had better service from other employees. Would I ever come back?
