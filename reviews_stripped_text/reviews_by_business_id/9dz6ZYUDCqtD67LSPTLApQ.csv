788573,2014-08-05,0,9dz6ZYUDCqtD67LSPTLApQ,"Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. I never write bad reviews but I have to let this one out. I keep coming back because it's the closest to me and I've been hoping that eventually they will get my order right, but I've gotten to the point where I would drive 10 miles for a better service. I had to drive back three times for one order one night, the drive thru takes forever, the staff never takes the right order and the food is always hit or miss. It's pretty ridiculous. I don't expect 5 star service from McDonald's but damn this place has driven me CRAZY!!! Good luck all.",ftrOgmoYbRMD6oNCB8wb7Q,0,0,1,nwHurPdMe5XRROv1As1U5g

Then he proceeded to give me an empty drink cup (which I thought was a coffee cup). Then I had to ask for cream and sugar. I went to the drink station expecting to find the coffee and there was none. Then I realized that I had a soda cup. I went back to the counter and asked for my coffee. He looked at me and took my drink cup and finally poured my coffee in a coffee cup--no apology and he had a smirk on his face.  I looked at my receipt and realized he charged me for a small soda. When I brought it to his attention he said ""oh it's the same price anyway."" I left and went to the drink station to get a coffee stirrer. There were none. Went back to to counter and had to ask for a stirrer. Again no apology. All the while the manager was at the counter in plain view and hearing range.

I made eye contact with the ""white shirt,""  I believe this was the HMFIC because they were dressed differently then everyone else.  The HMFIC failed to smile back.  I went into HM (Hater Mode) and walked out.  I made my purchases at TH and punched out.  I reevaluated my time line for the morning and decided....I needed calories.

I didn't ask for extra , just a replacement.i hope McDonald's go out of business soon.

There is always some type of situation with the late night service. It's unfortunate because it is located next to several communities. That's McDonald's for you. Not caring about service because they have you addicted. 50% of time I am disappointed with this location.,uapkyq-U_geRRps43JxkKw,0,0,1,O6rMrybO4D83lbp90_C1Xg

I drove here from Wally World and parked directly in front of the door.  There were a few people at the drive through and a few inside the McDonald's itself.

The counter person came quickly and took my order.  I paid and stood aside while she made the shake.  It was quickly given to me and it was good.  One of my few (that's a joke) bad holiday habits.

I was soon on my way happily sipping this sweet goodness and already plotting to stop for just one more before they're gone.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,2,2,4,f3d_ySHibTsH3g0OJ64NyA

So I got off of work and came to this McDonald seeing as they are always open. Always have the full menu available. Well at this time they did not, they only had the breakfast menu available. So I go ahead and order the sausage egg with cheese biscuit. The person running it, when ordering they ended up going to their fellow coworker and saying ""I'm done"". First of all I found that very disrespectful Second of all being as somebody who associate themselves with customers all day I expect nothing more then 100% regardless if you're about to go on break, if you're about to get off of work it doesn't matter to me, what matters to me is customer satisfaction. (If you are about to get off work or going on break, finish the customer who u handling and then go to break or whatever). So besides that I went home and I unwrap my sausage egg with cheese biscuit and I find myself with bottom bread, cheese and sausage with no top bread nor egg;  as you'll see in the picture I am highly disappointed in this and I doubt I will ever come back to this McDonald's. I wish I would've gotten the kids name who was disrespectful to me so I can properly talk to him but seeing as he left so quickly I wasn't able to but I will be sure to tell my fellow coworkers and friends not to come here again seeing apparently to this McDonald's customer satisfaction is not what your guys goal is to obtain.
