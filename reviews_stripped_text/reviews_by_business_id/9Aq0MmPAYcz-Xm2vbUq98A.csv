I had the Teriyaki chicken sandwich with Pineapple. As I began eating, I could taste the teriyaki right of the back. It was very delicious, but then I got to the pineapple.. The pineapple was good too, however, the combination of the teriyaki chicken and pineapple did not mix very well for me. I have eaten at Carl's Jr before and had other good meals, and don't get me wrong, this one was good, but just the combination of the pineapple and teriyaki was not a good combo!! That is why I am still giving them a 3-star... they are good. I wanna try the mushroom burgers... Plus my son tried one.

And the drive thru here always seems to take extra time and several minutes spent sorting out confusion. On my most recent (and likely last) trip here, I got that new American burger with the hot dog and potato chips. Hockey puck burger, overly tough bun, almost no potato chips, and horrible non-beef hot dog. I would actually describe it as disgusting. So sad. The jalapeno poppers were alright, but weren't actually jalapeno poppers. Instead of filling a jalapeno, they chop it up and deep fry it with some cheese. So you get a lot of cheese and very little jalapeno.

2564693,2013-11-09,0,9Aq0MmPAYcz-Xm2vbUq98A,"Absolutely the worst service I have ever seen at a fast food restaurant.  We stopped in for a quick burger.  It took us almost 5 minutes at the register to be acknowledged.  Bear in mind, there was a party of 3 who were eating, and a party of 5 who ordered at some point before us.

Ordered 2 combo meals... 18 minutes later, I walked back to the counter.  The General Manager was the woman who took  our order.. and she was ALSO COOKING THE FOOD.  A grand total of 3 employees were present on a Friday night at 5:00pm.  One was handling the drive-thru orders, the general manager was working the front registers and helping a brand new person cook the food.

We got our burgers after I waited another 2 or 3 minutes at the counter.  Mine was the wrong order.  The GENERAL MANAGER asked the brand new cook what the wrapper looked like for the one I ordered.

While all of this is going on, the party of 5 who ordered before us informed the GM that she had been waiting 22 minutes for 2 milkshakes.  The GM's reply was ""yeah, we have 15 ordered right now, we'll get to it"".  

I understand understaffing to save some money, but no apology, nothing.   And the restaurant had a total of 3 parties including us.   The GM had the personality of wallpaper and offered nothing in the way of an apology.

I ordered the Big Country burrito which came with some hash towns and a coffee. I ate three or four of the hash browns and stopped because they tasted old and stale. The burrito wasn't flavorless but the flavor it had tasted like motor oil. To finish my meal, my coffee was some of the worst swill I have ever tasted. Most truck stops have better coffee than this place.

So in closing, this fast food dispensary does nothing more than provide terrible food with mediocre service. Save your time and your taste buds, go to a 7Eleven and get a Snickers bar.",OXwmkyamQ5H6Ed0xZo_kQA,2,1,1,3D42zPJ2yc4XTHVcbGZ70w

5390958,2015-03-25,0,9Aq0MmPAYcz-Xm2vbUq98A,"I hit the drive-through late at night and I have yet to have a good experience. After two seriously bad experiences, I'm boycotting this Carl's Jr.

I rolled up at approximately 3 AM two weeks ago and this overweight black dude was working the drive-through and cooking. He looked tired and I felt kind of bad for him. I got my usual, famous star with cheese, extra onions, extra tomato, extra lettuce. It didn't come as I ordered, I just chalked it up to the fact that maybe the guy was just overworked and underpaid.

So the following week I hit the drive through at approximately 1 AM and there was a Latino dude with a powder blue shirt, I'm assuming he was a manager or something? Anyway, I placed the exact same order and I noticed the black dude was in the back cooking. He didn't look too happy and I noticed him glaring at me. When I got my food home I noticed the order was fouled up again.
Two little slivers of onion, a little bit of lettuce and a thin slice of tomato was all I got on my sandwich. The fact that it was cold really distressed me. That was the second time in two weeks that this Carl's Jr. employees screwed up my order.

I guess the kicker for me was looking through the drive-through window, seeing the cook adjust his pants and checking his cell phone after he gave me a strange look. It really grossed me out to be completely honest.

If anybody has hit the drive-through late at night and had the same experience, I'd like to read about it. I have a feeling I'm not the only one getting the orders screwed up and getting food that you have to reheat in the microwave.

-5 stars.

                 
                         *UPDATE*
So I decided to change it up a bit to see if the problem I was having was isolated to the night shift employees. I was very wrong, the hamburger was disgusting!

My buddy came in from out of town at approximately 4 AM and said he would like to eat at Carl's Jr. I explained to him that I've had some issues at this location. We rolled through the and I noticed the blonde hair white guy that was taking our order at the drive-through window on March 21, 2015 at approximately 4:30 AM sounded like he was on drugs, or possibly had a neurological problem.
He was very cold and muttering. I didn't get a receipt and the food was room temperature again! This twentysomething year-old drive-through employee with severe acne was rude.
It's unbelievable the way these night shift employees are so messed up.

My buddy was leaving yesterday, March 24, 2015 and he asked me if I could drive him to Carl's Jr. again. I figured the dayshift wouldn't get the order wrong, especially if we went into the restaurant to order the food, I was wrong yet again.
The woman that helped us at the register was very nice, but as I said, the food was wretched.
I posted photographs of my two famous stars with cheese, as well as the receipt.


This place is pathetic and sad. I could tell the people that work there are miserable and as you can see from the photographs, the food reflects their misery.

By the way, the chicken sandwich I ordered was for my better half, and that too was practically room temperature. She and I will never go back to this Carl's Jr. again.",i8fDRLkC2VBEkPnBs9EbKw,0,0,1,6DGzSSbfYj2wkADcnLR96A

The hispanic woman stationed at the drive-thru window turns around with a scowl on her face, stalks over to the partition between the cashier and the cooks where the burgers come out, leans over toward the cooks, and says in a voice loud enough for everyone in the restaurant to hear (and I quote) ""MUCHO BLAH BLAH BLAH!!""

I smiled so big when she turned around to go back to the drive-thru she winked at me.

Now that's what I call a sign of the times. :) Absolutely hilarious.
