What did stand out was that the waiter refilled our waters regularly (which Ryan really appreciates). He also refilled our chips right before we even finished! Granted, it was slow in the restaurant, but I heard that the service was rather poor... so it was nice to see that today was an exception for us.

Unfortunately, this time, they were disappointed and felt that it had gone downhill. I on the other hand had nothing to compare it to. I thought the salmon tacos were so-so; adequate after a lot of margarita, but not great. They did have corn tortillas (thank goodness) but there was no interesting sauce. I don't know if they forgot it, or...? They did make a substitution for me (grilled vegetables for the rice and beans), which was cool. Our waiter was also very friendly and attentive. The house margarita was really, really weak but tasted pretty good, so I ordered another margarita, but one of the fancier ones (the ""cowboy"" or the ""Texan"" or some kind of western name) on the rocks. On the rocks turned out to be a giant tub of booze with a few melted ice cubes swimming in it.

Like most Mexican restaurants you get complementary chips and salsa. They provide two types of salsa - a mix between mild and medium that is going to be way too hot for the strictly mild crowd, and a weak hot variety. 

Our server was very nice and attentive throughout the meal. The food here is always delicious, and made well - but it's nothing to rave about. It's your typical Mexican fare with plenty of options.

How dare you take such beautiful words as an excuse to jack the price of the buffet line when it's the same weekday food anyway!

Driving down Trop Ave I noticed the banner hanging out front proudly mentioning a ""Best of Las Vegas"" award (albeit from 2010)...but would standards change in that short a time?  Maybe this raised my expectations.

I arrived bout 11:30am & was given the lunch specials menu insert, but decided I would try some breakfast since it was still late morning.

Selection was sorta limited...there were two choices.  Chorizo & eggs & Hueveos Rancheros.  OK, not many choices, but granted they don't open til 11am, so demand for break is probably minimal.

Got the Huevos Ranch.  Just two (small to med sized) eggs on a tortilla...would it break to bank for the ownership to put large or XL eggs on a dish that costs 10 bucks w/tax?

And on the side (Wait for It!) some beans (refried) Rice? no. Sour Cream? no. Some cheese sprinkled on the pintos? no.  Maybe a lettuce & tomato garnish on the side? no.  And maybe a pipe dream of a real ranchera sauce stead of the lame canned salsa?

I told the waitress I needed some rice & she obliged...but it was kinda crunchy.  Ok guess the cook hadn't had a chance to cook some fresh stuff for the day & just grabbed what was left from the night before (albeit dried out enough that you could hurt your teeth.)

Even though she didn't charge me for brittle rice, the bill came to nearly 30 bucks w/tax & tip for the huevos, guacamole (3) coffee (3), & albondigas soup (Carrots? no. Sprig of celery? no. Mex chayote squash? pipe dream.) Granted the cook didn't have a total aversion to vegetables...the soup bowl had the equivalent of one onion ring in it.

Not that there's anything wrong w/ dropping 30 for breakfast for one(well maybe there is, but that's a different discussion) but it shouldn't have the minimal garnishments & burnt tasting coffee in one of the supposed culinary capitals of the country.",yGO7pu4aBDWBIdEmpixOEw,0,0,2,TYl4H7yTNB4HhX-dFNb5Eg

I grew up on Macayo's. My dad was a busboy there when he was a mere 15 years old in Old Vegas. I swear I wouldn't be as tall as I am today without the influence of the TCT (toasted cheese tortilla) and the bean and cheese burrito. I still haven't found an albondigas soup that even comes close to Macayo's. Plus there is nothing like their unlimited smooth salsa with tortilla chips that come at the beginning of every meal. Heck it's so good they sell the bottled salsa at your local grocery store. 

In my adult age, I have learned to enjoy a new aspect of Macayo's: the MARGARITAS. My favorite thing now is to bring my Cha-Cha margarita glass to the bar and have it refilled for $3.99 a glass. Cha-Cha is a ceramic glass in the shape of a Mexican woman and her hat serves as the receptacle for the healthy margarita refills. She originally cost $10.99 with a margarita. 

The service nowadays is a toss up. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's not. They have a pretty good happy hour with discount beers and margaritas if you don't want to go the Cha-Cha route. You have to sit in the bar to take advantage of the half off appetizers. The Shredded Beef Burro Enchilada Style is beyond amazing.

I went there twice, so I just didn't land on a bad day. They were disorganized, unfriendly, too feww waiters serving too many people. It was slow service. A take out order was also overcharged on side items, I'm sure of it. Was in a hurry & couldn't persue it. It's the closest one to my house & I'm willing to go out of my way to another one.",Jy7Jy_8O7HmdKZ3qYsrjuw,1,0,2,OfOo_6fmjyJMk7BDDbajAg
4570989,2013-12-20,1,pf3kPNPGA15kggbgL92UXg,"I am quite snarky when it comes to considering Mexican food outside of my home state of Texas.  My coworker is obsessed with Macayo's, mainly because she is a Vegas native and grew up eating here.  She is really fond of it.  The restaurant itself is very large, and boasts a UNLV discount but it does not apply to any of the specials and we only go at lunch so I am not sure if it really works.

It is located right next to Metro Pizza off Tropicana just east of Maryland so it is easy to get to from campus.  All celebrations surrounding her happen here, so I have eaten here more than I expected to ever.  There are plenty of reasonably priced, filling lunch specials - a whole large menu page of them - but I always stick with the combinations.  There is a choice of one or two items for $8.59 or $9.59 and it comes with rice and beans or double of whatever one (I get double rice), plus a small shredded lettuce and diced tomato garnish.  The choices include chile rellenos, enchiladas, tamales, tacos, and probably a few other options.  

I typically stick with the chicken enchilada and the green corn tamale covered in spicy tomatillo sauce which is quite wonderful.  These items are covered in cheese so if you are not big on cheese, let them know.  I am never wowed by the meal but it is a good average Mexican meal if you are craving one.  I can justify anything covered in green sauce and I can assure you can find something on the menu to satisfy you here.  Service is hit or miss.  Today lunch was smooth and very fast.  Complimentary chips and 2 salsas are included.  Remember, guac makes everything better but costs extra!",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,1,2,3,psESiX7f3_AqP7PWzVAPOg

Now, I'm a vegetarian, so I have to rely on what my dining partners say about their food, but I LOVE mexican food, so my friend has dragged me here twice.

My friend cannot handle spice. Seriously, once I put pepper jack in a sandwich and she almost died from heartburn or something. But she LOVES Macayos, probably for the same reason I don't like it too much - I find it bland. Enormous, and cheap ($10 gets you food to last for three meals), but bland. Although I like the salsa and free chips. My other friend liked her taco salad, because she was in a mood for crispy shells. I've had the veggie burrito with sauce (Oh, they don't tell you, but the sauce is $1 extra), the cheese enchiladas (the sides are refried beans, which aren't my fave, but the sauce wasn't very spicy or onion-y), and the veggie fajitas (not bad).

I'd come here again, but only because my best friend loves the place.",UZJZ7iq0wkCbFZiWC-wvlg,0,1,2,b4ZneOkjBrLf5V8qulcnGQ

5156339,2011-07-18,1,pf3kPNPGA15kggbgL92UXg,"It says a lot about a place when the best part of your meal was the chips and salsa. The service was very attentive, especially considering the huge party of sixteen she had to attend to (that being us).

The food, on the other hand, is comparable to a fast food chain. I split a plate of tacos with a friend. The chicken tacos, soft shell, were decent. Literally, I could have gone down the street, and gotten them for cheaper. The rice and beans were sub-standard - nothing special. Other than the chips and salsa, the TCT was another shining point. A huge quesadilla, pizza-esque creation. It was pretty delicious. Authentic on the other hand? Not so much.

In telling my brother's friends where I was headed off to for dinner, they all had the same response: ""Macayo's? Oh..."". I now understand. It's pretty much a glorified Taco Bell with a cult following.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,2,0,2,0e9PBJr2kRm2oV7G6Jlsaw

The service was terrible . . . the server took our drink order . . . and THREE bowls of chips and salsa later . . . she was back with the drinks and took our order.  Another two bowls of chips later . . . the food arrived.  Problem was . . . it was COLD and GREASY.

Saving grace was that we ate enough chips to fill up . . . we definitely not be back.",LTWwc5SMKVd5UHN7Y-sxsw,0,0,2,p0EzI6L95nYs3a9KX1jAVw

We ordered the green chili bites as an app and they were so good.  I got the baja burrito which I love because of the sauce.  I could eat that on just about anything.  

The food was fresh, hot, spiced just right and the service was swift, definitely a return visit is in order.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,0,0,4,WR7cTsFlxMJ8lciAOFlt7A

I was a little thrown off by the crazy shirts the staff wear but the place was packed and that is normally a great sign. We went with a few friends and we were seated relatively quick. 

Now to the reason that a star was lost. Our waitress came around the corner wearing her party animal shirt like everyone else which you would think would put you in an amazing mood, but instead she came around the corner like a communist leader demanding our order and being super impatient and not at all welcoming.. Once we gave Mrs. Marx our order she disappeared and did not come back until the food was ready.  
(Pow, One star Gone)

The Saving Grace here was the quality of the chicken Chimichanga that was brought to the table, first of all it was the size of a small baby and second it was probably one of the best chimichangas I have ever had. To me it says something when the food you serve can overpower the horrid service that your servers provide. 

I think we will go back from time to time I am just hoping that we dont get Cruella the waitress again.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,3,1,4,VUibYvhYLSGYG1B0LqyzUw
