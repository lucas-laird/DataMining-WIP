Starboard Tack isn't your glitzy Vegas strip establishment or your artsy downtown eclectic gathering spot, but it will be your go-to hangout for great cocktails.  The dive bar style setting is no indication of the quality that this place has to offer.  Led by two of Las Vegas' finest mixologists, the cocktails are simply spot on.  While rum is the spirit of choice, the Retroscena influence comes through with ample amaro additions to many of the signature cocktails.  From light to rich, the cocktail creations of these two genius bartenders will once again be the talk of the town.

Oh, by the way, the food was surprisingly delicious.  While the Thai mussels, oysters, and chicken skewers were quite tasty, the Mongolian cheese steak sandwich was an incredible mix of spice and texture, worthy of visit on its own.  Needless to say, I'll be back...often.",eRNdN44ygyRAdiV2OAEiZA,3,1,5,oJJYrhw1lV5xf9311J5oyA

I ordered some tapas (I'm a huge tapas fan) and found the empanadas to be excellent. They were Philippine empanadas, which are a little different from the ones I'm used to from South America. I took my mom there for lunch and she loved them. She's from Chile, so the bar is high. I also had the mussels, which were ridiculously large and delicious! The beer selection is good, the atmosphere about what you want for a bar/restaurant (dark, quiet).

Starboard Tack opened in 1971 until 2000, when it became Gilligan's Hideaway until 2016. In early 2017, new owners restored the old concept, complete with menu that features pupu platters and skewers as well as Southeast Asian fare and Caribbean.

This is one of the best dive bar around imo. The places isn't as smoky as other bars I have been. There is a spacious bar area, dining area that is well lit with music not too loud and lounge area.

Must have are their Seasonal Chi Chi Frozen Drink that is served in a cute Panda mug and their original Lucky Cat is served on a cute Cat mug. We tried most of their drinks. They have a good selection of draft beer.

We like the Poke Bowl and all the skewers and the peanut sauce that came with it were flavorful. My bf and I's bill were $85 and the price were reasonable.

It came up on a search in Google for ""Tiki drinks"" in Vegas, but in reality -- and true to it's roots, it appears -- this restaurant/bar is more nautically-themed than Tiki, with a smattering of fun Caribbean and Pacific-rim inspired food and drink offerings.

And what drink offerings they are ... clearly someone put a lot of thought into these. The Rum-Kum Cocktail was comprised of a rum blend with lime, dry curacao, with a whole kumquat garnish; the Starboard Taiquiri a fantastic daiquiri variant made with Plantation Pineapple rum, lime, sugar, and absinthe.

The Mocha Cioccolato Ya Ya is a decadent desert coffee drink spiked with Meleti Cioccolato, coffee rum, and with a coconut whipped cream float; the Poop-Poop-A-Doop another fine rum drink made with (besides the rum) gin, apricot brandy, and not-often-encountered Swedish Punsch. The Lucky Cat - an inventive blend of Kikori, Allspice Dram, and rice milk, with a hint of spice heat from Togarashi vanilla syrup, as also intriguing and delicious.

My favorite was the Atlantico on Atlantic St., a riff on the classic fizz cocktail made with Atlantico rum, creme de cassis, orgeat, lime, egg white, walnut bitters, and, as it developed in the mouth, a faint, smoky hint of scotch ... As beautiful to drink as it was to look at.

Despite their being uniformly excellent, the drinks were among the most reasonably priced we had during our whole week in Vegas, so our bill was a happy thing as well.

We had enjoyed dinner earlier in the evening, so did not get to explore the food menu as much as we might have liked, but the Vegetable Lumpia and Poke we shared were both fresh and tasty, and the service was prompt and friendly.

This place has a ""locals bar"" feel--I felt like I'd walked into the place where cool LV natives go to escape the strip. My friend and I checked it out on a Monday night and we were two of about seven people--a nice escape from the downtown crowds (and heat). I love the tiki/seafood spot feel of Starboard, especially the wallpaper and midcentury couches + rattan chairs. The food menu also looks fun--I was bummed we'd just eaten. Fish & chips, oysters, and poké felt like total vacation food. 

Since we arrived with full bellies, we dove straight into the cocktail menu. They've got ten or so  really fun and creative cocktails on their list, plus a frozen drink and a mango chi chi. I went with the mango chi chi per Taylor S's (the lovely Vegas Community Manager) suggestion--this chick knows a good cocktail. I think this was definitely the best chi chi I've ever had, and served in the cutest glass to boot. My friend had a mezcal forward drink that was half blue and half green--I'm not much of a tequila lady and found this drink to be a little strong, but the colors were absolutely gorgeous.

Our server took the time to give us a rundown on the history of the bar--make sure to check out the old photos of Starboard Tack in the 70's over by the fireplace. While not much of the decor was original (except for the wood tables), they did a great job with the retro/throwback vibe. Speaking of our server, he was fantastic. He offered to make my friend a new drink if the one she didn't love the one she ordered (she did) and checked in with us often (but not too often, if ya know what I mean). 

While I think this is definitely a five star establishment, I had to drop a star for the smoking situation. Toward the end of our visit, a guy pulled up to the bar, lit a cigarette, and proceeded to smoke the entire thing inside. I don't think that's legal here since it's not a casino, plus it's just super gross. Paired with the dry air, our eyes were burning and we decided to leave. Definitely still suggest checking this place out, though!",lt7bNHl-TXziny4FETu8nA,7,5,4,P05rirrcyC7wVMredRKY7Q

Starboard Taquiri ($8): Plantation Pineapple, Lime, Sugar, and Pernod. A little on the bitter side, but otherwise tasty.

Cherry Blossom ($8): Whistling Andy Hibiscus Rum, Lime, Fassinola, Maraschino Liqueur, and Cherry Bitters. A beautiful cocktail and lovely flavors; one of their most popular!

Longanisa Empanadas ($6): Filipino-style longanisa, green olive, egg, and roasted red pepper with chili vinegar crema. I was really surprised and pleased with this dish. I'm a big fan of longanisa, but it tends to be salty and can overwhelm a dish. This empanada was well-balanced and very delicious. It comes two to a plate, so order accordingly.

Fried Chicken Fried Rice ($12) with sunny side-up egg. The fried rice seems more Indo-influenced and we enjoyed it. The fried chicken was great, too, but I didn't care for it mixed into the rice as it took away from its crispy texture.

West Indies Fried Chicken Sandwich ($10): Walkerswood jerk aïoli, Pineapple pickles, and fries. Out of the three dishes we tried, this one was a clear winner. The chicken is unbelievably juicy with the crispiest exterior; just amazing. Our bartender recommended getting the pineapple pickles on the side and we're so glad we did! The pickles are amazing, but quite pungent, so it was nice to take a bite when we wanted. The fries were also good though a tad overdone.

Visiting Las Vegas from New York, came into Starboard Tack with a coworker and a friend on a weekday night, looking to have a lowkey night with cocktails at local spot. It's a bit out of the way from the hustle and bustle of the strip (thank god,) but this bar hit the nail on the head - tiki hut-themed, couches and chairs for intimate conversation, and a longass bar with locals playing casino games built into the counter.

The bartender was working solo that night and came out to give us menus and serve us drinks we'd order. Craving something sweet, my coworker recommended the Chi Chi and so I went for it. It was flavored with guava that night, and boy was it tasty. The best part? Served in an adorable ceramic panda mug with a straw the chest, I knocked back about 4 of them (oops.) We also ordered the Chicken Fried Rice, which came with a sunny side up egg. That definitely hit the spot.

Despite our server being the only one working that night, he was pretty attentive, super nice, and quick with my Chi Chi refills. I'm not sure how many ceramic pandas they have, but I definitely used out a good portion of the ones they have.

Everyone raves about the Chi Chi served in a panda mug and yes, it's good. You could also order the signature daiquiri and wouldn't be disappointed. The best thing about drinking late at night here is that the kitchen stays open and patrons can fill 'er up while whetting their whistle. 

The only drawback is the smoke. I forgot what it's like to stay up past midnight period. Add cigarettes into the equation and the next day is rough!

Yes, this was the spot to go to back in the 1980's and early 90's for fresh seafood and the best all you can eat salad and soup bar. Just a quick memory from me as a 30 year resident...Back in the day...
In the 80's the original Cashman Cadillac dealership used to be right next door, so we would go buy the latest and greatest new Cadillac and go for a lobster dinner.  It was our go to spot. All the cool Vegas folks were there. It was intimate, pricey and super exclusive. Even if we just wanted our car detailed for no reason we would always hang at the Starboard. Sometimes we were there so many times a month, I would get spoiled and say 'No More' 

So, after reading on Yelp that it was back up with the original name, I had to step back in time and revisit. 

Its now a cool hipster kinda bar with a different kind of vibe. Walking in felt like it did 30 years before. I felt home. It seems smaller than before, but still the same intimate feeling. 

The food is outstanding and the prices are so affordable on any budget. Ordered the chicken tempura $8, empanadas $6 and the daily poke(tuna) $10. Delicious! the chicken tempura was the best! A must! And the drinks are about 70% less price wise than you pay at at any bar close or on the strip.

Its in a very remote residential neighborhood on the east side of the Las Vegas strip, but completely safe and easy to find. Lots of free parking(private lot).

I love going back in time and revisiting old spots I used to frequent, and this is a definite gem.
Support our local businesses and give it a try. Waiting for a 'Yelp Event' in the near future...hint hint.

I heard it had a little history because it was originally Starboard Tack and then became Gilligan's Hideaway for many many years. Two young entrepreneurs who love and have massive industry experience take over and bring it back to it's roots. Alas, Starboard Tack is born again. I love a good comeback story.

The place is huge. You walk right in towards the bar but there is a giant seating area full of booths to the back right. Just to the right of the bar are a few couches as well. There is a giant projection screen that comes down for sporting events in this area, or so I'm told.

Starboard won my heart with the Mango Chi-Chi. It's frozen, tropical, refreshing, and delicious. It also comes in a ceramic panda cup, so I might order it no matter what was inside just for that. They have a great cocktail menu and a very talented bar staff. The draft beer selection is a nice mix of beers and the can/bottle variety is on point. My favorite draft they have right now is the Ballast Point Amber. I'll take two, and I have many times.

The food at Starboard is even better. My favorite menu item right now is the Mongolian Cheesesteak. I've had it several times. The meat is tender, the cheese is hot and bubbling, and the onions are caramelized to perfection. The sauce completes the sandwich, in addition to the side of fresh cut fries. Skin on. Yessssssss.
