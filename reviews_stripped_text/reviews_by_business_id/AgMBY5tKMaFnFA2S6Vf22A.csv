When the order was ready i went to the register to pay and they would not accept my payment! I had an old hundred dollar bill and they accused me that the money was FAKE!!! They stood there and compared the hundred to a current hundred dollar bill!!!! LOL!!!! Obviously there are some major differances!!! I dont see how a employee is not educated in forms of payment and does not know how to verify a old hundred dollar bill when they are still in circulation.

Being an avid lover of the ""sammich"", I rotate regularly between Subway/Jimmy John's/Port of Subs/Earl/Firehouse, but this particular location is my favorite.  The staff is always nice and courteous and not once has my order been done wrong even when phoned in.  

Over the years I've seen many of the same people working here, which is a good sign because places with heavy turnover are indicators that ownership/management cares little about the employee, which also tends to lead to poor customer service given that their ""people skills"" aren't terribly great..

There are the little things I tend to look for since I eat so many sandwiches such as the freshness of the bread, quality of the meat, or having the meal drowned in too much mayo.  They never come up short at this location.

Is the location and staff clean?  Absolutely.  There is nothing worse than seeing a worker covered in crumbs leaning to make your sandwich (which I've witnessed elsewhere at non-Capriotti's chains).  They simply do it all right here, and in fact, I'm leaving now to go get a sandwich!",Q3dYbn4k65ZCWCMVxw_iZw,0,0,5,Lvj19s9bPxgkG7td8YVuKg

The place looks very clean and orderly also. Obviously, someone is staying on top of things to make sure it stays looking so good!

- the Bobbie
- Slaw Be Jo
- Capastrami

Next they try to put a brownie in the bag with my sandwich and that threw me way off cause I am a diabetic. Truthfully at this point I had forgotten my entire fricken order! Mind you I was on a 20 minute lunch break. So I finally collected myself to know A.) I was not getting the soup I wanted and B.) I want my beloved honey BBQ bag of chips I ordered and I will gladly go. 

When I got back to my office the sandwich was totally hip but I could not taste hardly any or no cheese on it and the marinara sauce the online ordering system allows you to add was stated to be put on the side. Like in a cup on the side...wasn't in the bag and I forgot my order in the midst of the confusion at the store. Go figure... I called and Tawana answers the phone thanking me in the follwing manner. ""Thank you for calling Capritotti's on Rainbow and 215 speaking"". She bursts out an laughs and states, ""I mean Tawana speaking."" I started to ask a question about how the actual sandwich was to come cause I have never purchased this particular sandwich before. Long story short, the conversation turns into her rudely interrupting and saying. "" I asked you that cause I am trying to get you a free sandwich and I am going to get the Manager now."" She proceeds to throw down the phone and cop her plea to the poor manager on Duty that has to put up with her tude. Max who was very kind remembered me from the pick up confusion in recent apologizes for Tawana who apparently has missed some training videos in the past. I cannot stand non professional people. We all have to work co exist and get a long. Why make things harder by not caring at all right off the bat? 

I will go back in the future but I don't think it will be anytime soon.

UPDATE: I did return to the store a week later and the gentlemen who took the order apologized for everything and remade my sandwich. Great customer service review bumps up a star for sure.",gHgR3Zix2DcvGIUmwuzr7Q,1,0,3,-9jhACFWB09EnWcUtNeo4g

1. Use dry crusty turkey that tastes old and not much of it.
2. Put hardly any stuffing on it and make it so salty all you taste is salt.
3. Use a narrow bun, they used to be bigger, that is so  thick  you are mostly eating a bread sandwich.
The cranberry sauce is the only redeeming feature....and you need plenty of it to make up for the dried out bread sub.

I was out running an errand in the same area of this Capriotti's, so I called in an order to take back to work with me. In the mood for something different, I ordered a small tuna sandwich. 

When I arrived, there was quite a few customers waiting for their sandwiches so I was worried about there being a wait. I stood at the cash register for a while before I was acknowledged, despite there being a female employee wrapping sandwiches at the counter just a couple feet away. She looked over a few times but that was it. Another employee came from the back to ring me up for a small turkey sandwich. He didn't hear my order correctly over the phone, probably because of the loud music that was playing in the store. 

They were able to remake my sandwich correctly pretty quickly, and taste-wise, it did not disappoint. Next time, I will probably order from my usual Capriotti's location though.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,1,1,3,0uDVHkVJ-bMmwjCSkt7OrQ

Feb 4th, my wife purchased an online meal for pick up. I picked up her meal and came back to the wrong setting she SPECIFICALLY stated online, it was basically just substituting pastrami for chicken on the original capastrami sandwich. My wife spoke to prescilla about the issue and prescilla, store manager, and she told my wife that she would comp her next meal.

Today, March 13, 2016, I came in to get that comp meal. However, prescilla normally keeps tabs on who gets comp'd, but my wife's ticket wasn't there. No biggie, I didn't argue, but CRYSTAL went above and beyond and went to her district manager, DOUG, whom comp'd not just my wife's sandwich but also mine. I didn't ask for it, but the store is willing to definitely satisfy their customers. That's what I call 100% customer satisfaction. I'm not a personal to argue about little things but the gesture was beyond expected.

I also never take polite, friendly service for granted.

Their large sandwich is definitely enough for even three people to share.  I normally get the foot long to share with my husband and it fills us up just fine.

I have to agree with the other reviews on this location though - the food takes long to get!  I don't know what it is.  Other locations get your sammies out in an adequate time.  I found us waiting for 2 sandwiches for almost 20 minutes one time - and the place was empty!  That's why this place loses a star for me.

Anyways, if you're wondering whether or not you should try it - go for it.  The sandwiches won't disappoint.  Hopefully you won't have to wait long for it!",JHFuMHQBLuQ3TtkWwx1bmQ,0,0,4,yESM0GztOgFTwV3nSdaL4A

He and the store manager took care of the issue and then some. Absolutely wonderful customer service! Thank you so much!

I went to Capriotti's for a Bobbie to fulfill my turkey craving. And boy did it work. YUM! It made me happy:) Staff was pleasant, even though they were busy and seemed understaffed. We got our order quickly and it was perfect.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,0,1,4,T5PraR-XGEG6NQNncoPtMg

The cook was extremely helpful and attentive to our order. 

We were not the easiest order and yet she genuinely made us feel at ease! I will return and recommend to everyone.

Thank you Martha for your personal interest and the rest of the crew for your patience. 

You are an amazing team!!!",ZJDvoG6iMtYYQhrzN4POFw,0,0,5,x-67JANYqMkpCx2863JCYw

If you haven't been in to give them a try I highly suggest you do. Also, phone ahead and save yourself a little bit on the wait time.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,1,0,4,6BCrEgyORCKfy-IRPociYw

Everything tastes super fresh, and delicious! My favorite has to be tge steak abd cheese with the hot peppers, mushroom, and a little bit of mayo (it makes the hot peppers not so hot) I've also had thd Italian which was my go to sub before the steak and cheese. Salami ham provolone cheese on a fresh soft slice of bread you can't go wrong! 

You also have to try their signature sandwhich the ""bobby."" As I like to call itbits Thanksgiving in one sandwhich!  Roast turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce! Absolute heaven! I know this review if for this Capriotti's on South Rainbow, but I have never had a bad experience at any of the Capriotti's that I have been to! If you are visiting,  a local forever,  or a newcomer to the valley you must try Capriotti's!  You won't regret it!",Gek8x-Gt3NS8tfWMYjURSA,0,0,5,7Ho5za5DzQPgeTW4VEkTnQ

Last time at this location.

The salads are also well prepared and fresh.   Judging by the wild swings from 1 star claiming horrible service and skimpy sandwiches to 5 star claiming amazing service and the sensational Bobbie, I think it just depends on who is working that day as to your experience.  

I don't care for Russian roulette dining experiences so I doubt I will go there on my own.  There are some fantastic and consistent sandwich shops here in the valley to spend money at.   If we have a lunch meeting and this is what is ordered, well then I guess that is what I will eat.",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,1,1,3,NcjrwDH-6NZogKxzmEe9uQ
