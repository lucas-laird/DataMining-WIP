They have all the ethical food, GMO free, grass fed, organic, antibiotic and hormone free meat, and the rest of the buzz words needed for a feel good, great food experience, served super fast.  

Chipotle is so proud of their ""ethical"" food that they put up a sign on the menu at all locations to show it all off at the point of order (see attached photo), yeah baby! flaunt it when you got it!!!

I had my usual salad with no rice or beans, chicken, picco de gallo, grilled veggies, medium and hot sauce with a splash of lettuce for garnish all under 300 calories, I love this place, anywhere in the world! #RavingFan",ijOZLZDhQZ7nLLig5Yhdeg,1,1,5,VhOaSqAeci0K_JE-rVozWg

1812803,2015-08-22,0,wy6pYrWtiGrktOpUmsvCHQ,I love chipotle! However the service at the new Venetian location is terrible! The workers are rude. It's really loud in the food court and you aren't able to hear them very well and when ask them to repeat them self they have an attitude portions are small compared to other locations. When the girl was wrapping my burrito majority of the guacamole came out! Didn't offer to add more or apologized mind you I paid 12.00 for a burrito alone! I love their food but I don't think I will be eating there again!,-E52BPuO3UAh5Z1AAz_M3Q,0,0,2,_XjPhxYSgu9PwG6ow2NmAg

Chicken was cold and burned, they were out of new queso and Chipotle sauce, server was super stingy with portion size, and after paying for my bowl I was told the forks are all gone. The food court was one of the most overcrowded I have ever seen.",WkycCsirPU9BKNcicz2YLg,0,0,1,adG92hdEj1rebv4e9-trkQ
2340321,2017-07-15,0,wy6pYrWtiGrktOpUmsvCHQ,"I really love chipotle, I have never had a bad experience in one before. This review is from a VEGAN experience..

Today I got a bowl, white rice, pinto beans, extra grilled veggies, sofritas (vegan meat substitute- awesome protein sub.) corn, salsa, guac and lettuce on top. Absolutely delicious. The sofritas are an incredible option that is slightly salty and slightly spicey. Like all tofu it absorbs the flavor of what is put on it.

Chips and salsa make a nice addition to any meal. I personally enjoy taking a page out of my Hispanic heratige and use the bowl as a ""dip"" and eat it with chips. Call it a life hack Lol.

Highly reccomend a Chipotle near you!!",JktkPizuRAA32z-m1UCsBw,2,1,4,4FoodyAhKtWWEZBrA12V8Q

My husband seemed happy to enjoy his steak burrito, chips and salsa. 

I ordered a burrito filled with chicken, cilantro lime brown rice, pinto beans, fried tomato salsa, tomatillo green-chili salsa, cheese, chips with guacamole.  My palate did not agree.  Rice tasted heavy and made my tummy full as I was determined to finish my meal.  Chips did not appear; however, they were salty.  Guacamole tasted a day old.  

I loved to nix the rice, have chips with a dash of salt and fresh guacamole made on same day.  Pray for a pleasant experience next time.",qrs9IUi72uN9zcEs2VMWyA,0,0,2,uepy-WOitICD8G11yXZNmg
2634071,2017-04-29,0,wy6pYrWtiGrktOpUmsvCHQ,I have no complaints. This was just as good as any other Chipotle I've been to. I didn't expect that because it seems like when I go to a place in Vegas that I'm use to in California I'm always disappointed. Today I was not. The service was quick and accurate. My servers were all friendly and after I had been served I realized I had no salt in my hotel room. I asked the girl for packets but they don't have them. The girl was so sweet she got a cup they put guacamole in and put some salt in it. I was so happy. Great location and I'll go back next time I'm around here.,L4vvFA-ioy1RlopoAHYxUg,0,0,5,wXAHec386K0pJSRideNmuA
2967039,2015-09-27,0,wy6pYrWtiGrktOpUmsvCHQ,"The food & customer service were awesome as usual for a Chipotle however I give this place only 3 stars mainly for the awkward setup which is less than ideal. You walk in and it is set up like a mini food court with a panda express counter and small pizza place in the same area. Seating is very limited and the tables were all very dirty. That said, It is conveniently located on the strip and is a good option in terms of price as meals can be expensive on the strip.",lHGI9cubh0g4wG0LFt1rdA,0,0,3,1P_bOrYKEUSKZnpQXb0drQ

I understand that Las Vegas hikes its prices up, especially depending on the location. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and the taste was just as good as any other location I've been to in SoCal, but I was still charged over $7 for it??? All I got was a large tortilla, cheese and chicken - and I was charged for a whole bowl/burrito/salad! Kind of ridiculous if you ask me...

The employees were friendly so I can't complain there.",gsC0fgTGe-S6-pBW1UKpJQ,0,0,3,x1zFbPFVIXge2OWPUgdNEw

3170365,2017-01-10,0,wy6pYrWtiGrktOpUmsvCHQ,"Chipotle is great no matter where you are, but to find a fast food without the super inflated price that typically comes with the Las Vegas Strip is something special.

It costs $7 for chicken despite being located in the midst of the Grand Canal shops at the Venetian.

The service was very good even though it was packed with CES attendees. They did not give me a disgusting look when I asked for a cup of water. Quality was just as expected from Chipotle.",UzE6ox-7ksMOsV3h-ZsTEw,0,0,5,Tlp-QDkfw1yNxSc5-06dCQ
3244456,2018-05-13,0,wy6pYrWtiGrktOpUmsvCHQ,"This Chipotle is located in the Venetian food court. I was super hungry and this was the only place that I thought would guarantee a decent amount of food because everything else looked unfamiliar. 

I always like to ask for hard taco shells on the side with my burrito bowl. From my experience other Chipotles will give you 3 shells when you ask for them, this location asked for how many I wanted. Don't be surprised if they are broken because I don't think a lot of people ask for them here.

They seemed terribly understaffed when I was ordering my food. One girl seemed like she knew what she was doing and the other two looked like they were still in their training week. There was a total of 3 people working the line and after one went on break there was one at the register and one working the food.

I have seen better portions.",_utUCkYKt8zl5CVEDiO9Sg,0,0,2,PXA4jfPtsWlJIiPgSCjnhw

* Less Rice
* Less Beans
* Less Veggies

& you will want to get Double Meat to make it a normal Chipotle Meat Helping.  Then it's $9.95 for Double Chicken.

4611091,2018-06-27,0,wy6pYrWtiGrktOpUmsvCHQ,"Went here for dinner, ordered a burrito bowl. When the cashier put my bowl into the bag, the lid must not have been on all the way and a lot of my black beans, guacamole and steak poured out everywhere. The cashier hurried up and turned the bag as if to hide it from me and then wiped off the counter.  After I paid the cashier walked away.  I took my bowl out of the bag that was soaked through with black bean juice and asked for a new bag. The cashier was beyond annoyed- the bottom of the bag had started to deteriorate- my request was not unreasonable. When I sat down to eat and removed the lid it was a mess and not much was left in my bowl. 

Disappointed with the service and attitude I received here.  This place is in a good court- I would suggest you go somewhere else in this food court",Dggl8UrTR8TBgNd5JYpxpA,0,0,1,OCj3ZXuQrIo1eWQ386jDWQ

I usually dont have a problem here but it was a bleh day and i was a $1 short of my order:( so dumb but i offered to come back with the money and tip. The cashier asked her supervisor what to do and he said he'd just give it to me. But then, he rolled his eyes. I also work in retail and i know rolling your eyes at a customer is one of the worst things you could do. I felt really bad and was going to go back anyways but i didnt want to run into that supervisor again. The food didnt taste as good as usual. So, i probably will avoid this chipotle and spend my $10+ somewhere else.",t1yb5o_GzvAc2M2LHlzulg,2,0,2,mvu_adNqhfCEtpC0DvFOVQ

The approached to me of the employee is nice but the serving of her food is really messed up. I ordered two bowls. She put so little amount of the rice in both. So I asked her nicely if I can have extra rice. And she didn't bother to add. She also put little amount of meat in my orders too.

It's hard to pinpoint what it is, but my guess is the grilled veggies and tomatoes in the pico. I would definitely try other food court options first instead of just going to this chipotle location.",ptM-j1l5zuiteYnWZ69KVg,2,2,2,7rbEbXpmRH9yntA2QvUVtw
