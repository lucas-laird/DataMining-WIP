But because this one is the closest to my house, I shall review it.

I have never been told ""we're out of that"" at this location.

The two guys that run it, ""know me"" and always greet me with a ""how have you been or where have you been?."" 

They work quick and my orders are always on the mark.
They may take a lil longer to pump out the order, but thats because they dont heat lamp any of their food, so its always fresh.",ZlDBSzKymLIDJ0YTr6kIeA,3,0,5,8aN_V4d3lgt_kfMEpdVnHQ

Today I tried their new ""Sea-dog"".  Its a deep fried fish filet with lettuce and tartar sauce on a hot dog bun.  It was very good.   This restaurant also has the Tastee-Freeze ice cream for sale as well.",xzMwqspXXlpykTdv3qkHlA,1,2,4,nvpxUM05F7v8DTWh0qL9sA

Mean while they are looking at one another asking should we let them in? What great customer service.....

They have the 5 for $5 deal. Can you beat that? I don't think so!! The family and I love chili dogs, so of course we are gonna go here!! YAY for Wienerschnitzel!! This time, we went to the one that is in front of Las Vegas Outlet. YYYYYAAAAAYYYY for chili dogs!!",wYTKE9ad0qWMgYPgNCnoQA,1,1,5,mPEquvSOpYebW1VZWZsHSg

The hot dog  was good I just wish the burger was tastier ... but their customer service was good.

Anything with their chili is ok but you might pay for it. Their gourmet dogs are pretty good.

But I pretty much just come here for the corn dogs.",AolnyiEB_UMlQtD_dp5E9g,0,0,3,Amz52GwmZy7mNRg5AwpJRg

2639179,2014-06-12,2,5tTKSogU3fWO7TlnYrffbA,"Horrible and terrible customer service!  When I was just about to place my order, a customer just got a sundae and asked the cashier for just a little bit more fudge on top (this Wienerschnitzel had chintz him on the fudge), but the cashier (Yussell) sternly said, ""No"" and told him that it was cost him 27 cents more!  What a joke!

Of course, I was leery that my family would receive poor service as well.  My wife and I order their new Angus hot dogs.  About 2/3 of the way done eating, we realized that they forgot to put the crunchy onions on top.  When I approached the cashier, who summoned the cook, the cook was confused.  Apparently, the cook did not know that these crunchy onions go on top.  What can you do about this, since we were almost done with our hot dogs.  Very disappointing!",cVa8JxDJl_ax-vtibVpERg,2,0,1,hSDIgy912pj_AeQ1x3X9Ug
2639818,2013-01-27,6,5tTKSogU3fWO7TlnYrffbA,"To be honest, I only drove thru this place because a friend of mine told me they have corn dogs. 

Whaaaat?! Somewhere besides Hot Dog on a Stick that serves my beloved processed meat deep fried in a cornmeal batter?! And not having to wait for the local carnival/fair to come into town to indulge in this fare food?!  I was so there.

They have a special of 5 for $5 corn dogs and although I was so tempted, I stuck with my usual 2. It was steaming hot as I drove away and dug right in. So delicious and worth the calories. I will be going back for sure...for the corn dogs.

For anyone reading this review and wonder why this would even be helpful, so what, I like corn dogs and not getting anything else. Enjoy!",C8HJdSggJI_MC58vTDBE3g,2,2,4,imKBpPm7zZcxWiLwEZkP1w
2717941,2011-02-23,0,5tTKSogU3fWO7TlnYrffbA,Why am I writing a review for Wienerschnitzel? I guess it seemed sad that they only had three reviews to date. If you don't feel like driving all the way to Costco for a hot dog you can't really go wrong here. Keep your eye out for coupons in the weekly circular if you want a really good deal.,gJYrREnFXkESKyMq8WuH3Q,0,0,3,hhEov53CDEafS5pJOsWBIA

3140862,2016-03-23,0,5tTKSogU3fWO7TlnYrffbA,"Came here last night for the first time because my nephew was craving a hot dog and he kept seeing this goofy commercial about some pastrami hot dog special they are running. Pulled up about 20 minutes prior to closing and after ordering when we got to the window the cashier (a guy) using a monotone voice repeated my total and kind of snatched the card. Dude I get it.. you work at a hot dog joint and you probably hate your life but please get a new job because the attitude and just extra stuff I could've done without. ANYWAYS on to the food. I don't generally do hot dogs and if I did wouldn't be from here however my nephew said it was "" the bomb"" but next time let's hope we get some better service when I bring him back.",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,0,0,3,Pn12_p_uh5g7HNZqD8o-iA
3483559,2016-02-13,0,5tTKSogU3fWO7TlnYrffbA,I go to this restaurant often cause it's close to my job. Yesterday I was off but decided to stop there for lunch. Ordered my food paid with cash. Sat down and ate finished said bye to a female worker who's always there when I go. She knows my face really well and was on lunch sitting behind me when I left. After I got a little ways up the street discovered I had left my wallet. Went back and no one had seen the wallet or anyone sit down where I was sitting. I never just accuse anyone of anything but within them few minutes she was still on break but never seen anything and the manager also said he swept and cleaned the table off after I had left. I'm not crazy but both are suspects if you ask me. She would not look me in my face and the manager was very hostile about the whole situation. I talked to another worker there and she said she seen the other employee with my wallet but didn't want to be involved because she work there. They stole all my personal information social security card drivers license credit cards insurance cards and the worst 840 dollars in cash that was my bill money and grocery money! The worst day of my life because I chose to eat at that classless ass fast food place!!!! They are very dishonest people the manager even had to nerve to say why would you carry that kind of cash anyway? I normally don't but I was going to pay bills and decided to stop there. What a huge mistake! I will never eat at anyone of those franchise! Oh and FYI they have no cameras in the lobby so be extra careful if you eat there! No stars from me but you have to select one to post so my rating is fuck them heartless ass bitches that work there!!! I hope worst happens to you and your lives are cursed for ever for every dollar you spent of my hard earned money!!! I'm a single mother of three and I don't get no fucking tax return bitch!!

5020097,2017-01-06,0,5tTKSogU3fWO7TlnYrffbA,"Seriously, if there was a Wienerschnitzel close to home, I probably would knock 2 stars from my rating.  Seriously, their chili dogs are barely adequate as daily fare but when I can only enjoy ""junk food"" when I'm on the mainland, the ratings go way up.

5 chili dogs for $6 is an insane bargain (by Hawaii standards, at least).  The hot dog is tasty but small - not like the gigantic ones available elsewhere in Vegas.  The chili tastes a little better than canned chili but definitely wouldn't win any cook-offs.  But man, are they good when you're hungry.

The service is quick but honestly rather indifferent.  Parking is abundant.",kkTOV5bnE9hHb5V_zd9b9g,6,4,4,rEKp0IjCaMP_0ObwXOwP_g

I'm pleased with the food here, it is not too oily considering the cuisine. I think that the staff in the drive through are efficient and helpful, they do not try to rush you as you calculate how many HD's to get for your family.

One of the best things about this particular spot is that after the dozens and dozens of time's I've been here to eat via the drive through, they have YET to screw up our order...

This place is very clean and people are nice and when i even go thru the drive-thru they are always on point i havent got an order wrong once here.

I received a penny sized amount of chili on my hot dog and no cheese when they even charged me extra for cheese!!! I showed it to the manager who seemed to be a lady of Mexican decent... she didn't even care. She basically said too bad and wouldn't refund my money... not even replace it with the correct item I ordered!!!! Horrible customer service! The only good thing about it was the restrooms were surprisingly pretty clean... maybe they make their employees complete a training course in cleaning restrooms instead of how to make a damn hot dog!! I will NEVER return to this location. Don't be cheating your customers!! I asked for a side a of jalapeños and they only gave me four AND charged me extra!!!,bhLLAzUDsbsOryasV3MObw,0,0,1,540urUizPN_1MD5SVcjXmg
