The pulled pork sandwich was very moist and they weren't stingy withvthe meat. The coleslaw on top really brought out the flavor in the pork....I mixed the sticky red sauce with the original sauce for a sweeter taste. I had the sweet potatoe and corn on the cob for sides both really good also.
Did I mention that im fat...lol....I ended the meal with the apple crisp a la mode....it was ok.
The service was great...had a southern type feel to the place...not too pricey for the amount of food you get.....overall really good....will definitely come back.",Lct81v81KSF8wBxhgixNLA,1,0,4,Dj7PGne6HTMZmk2Wyo1ewQ

I didn't go the bbq route for fear of being disappointed again, but the chicken fried steak here is VERY good (probably the best I've had in Vegas).  The yummy fried okra did not disappoint, and the cucumber salad was delightful--a lovely summery accompaniment to any meal.  The strawberry lemonade was delicious, too...a smidgen on the sweet side for me, but a squeezed-in lemon wedge did the trick beautifully to make it pretty close to perfect!  I was coveting a cop's luscious looking banana pudding served in a mason jar a few tables over, but, alas, the meal left no room for dessert...maybe next time!",BJOLgnc5gtHlkwhBIqNW5Q,2,0,3,l1uf_LX_eiEUk7BcIeK1wg

The sauce and seasoning that sits on the table is stale and old.  The kids portion is cold and over priced.  The pulled pork sandwich is tasteless and almost cold.  They still have the prices from ten years ago.  The wait staff act like they don't have the time and have given up.

Now is this anyway to treat a restaurant that is right next to our great Military base?  You guys could make this place a legend again and pack those seats if the food and service were back to the standard the long time locals remember.  There used to be the smell of slow smoked pork and beef int he air and people would flock to that location.  Now the parking lot is mostly vacant and no BBQ smell to be found.

Guys you lost it.  Either you skimped on the ingredients or you have cooks who don't give a flip.  Management could have changed.  But this place needs to go back to the good days when the food was to die for and there was a line out the door.",eIuITpqIeMcLgMxo3KPZng,1,0,1,KHO1jTSo_0whaFLXk6fOLw

417977,2012-06-03,0,LnRn6ECHdqTeoFF0c8FKYw,"Meh. I've experienced better.

This is just a continuation of my previous review.  I had a due-out from it, so please read it as well for a total picture.

Since this was a separate visit as well, let's talk about it in brief.  A burger is something I would expect any self-respecting BBQ place to do well.  Granted, to make one, it requires grilling, and not BBQing.  I guess this establishment just considers it beneath them to care about something as benign as a burger.

It's hard to excel at a burger, but it's also hard to mess one up.  Well, let me tell you of a few ways to lead down the wrong path as demonstrated here.  First, don't ask me how I want the burger done.  Typically if a burger is cooked beyond medium, it's because they're using an inferior meat.  Secondly, burger preparation is supposed to be minimalist, but not lacking entirely.  A waft of seasoning is all that's required, but I guess that doesn't work if all the burgers are the same preformed base for each menu version.  Thirdly, don't cook the heck out of a burger.  Luckily it wasn't fast food bad, but it was definitely poor workmanship.  Definitely not worth the price.

The hushpuppies didn't strike me as fresh, and they didn't have any semblance of being hand-made.  Yet, they did provide a medium in which to test their sauces, which I forgot to do on my first visit.  Their Original is far from its name-sake as it can it.  It takes just about like ever other BBQ sauce I've had (keep in mind I'm not a fan of any though).  The Red Sticky just seems like their Original mixed with some ketchup and maybe more (brown) sugar.  I honestly can't say if it made it better or worse.  Lastly, my ""favorite"" of the three would be their Spicy.  I wouldn't call it Spicy as in picante, but Spicy as in at least they put some spices in to give it flavor.

I guess I should have ordered some of their slaw to remind me why I risked another visit in the first place..",0c0d6-jwJoAlwMVcOowEQg,3,0,2,w_b6x_Nkl2ANAQKTKmp-rw

I ordered the Beef Brisket sandwich. Meat was not good. For sides, I got the red beans and rice, along with fried okra. Red beans and rice tasted like Copenhagen Long Cut. Gross!  Fried okra was OK, but had no flavor. Also ordered fried pickles before my meal, and I was somewhat confused if it was fried pickles or fried zuccini. Do they make their own pickles here?  Also, the pickles had no flavor, were soggy, and must have been fried in old oil. The ""Magic Dust"" was not so good, and I was reluctant to try the BBQ Sauce and Texas Hot Sauce on my table, because the bottle had been refilled so many times, the wrapper was peeling off. Not sure I would return, except for the Southern Sweet Tea, which was on point!  Be prepared for sticker shock!

488562,2012-10-11,0,LnRn6ECHdqTeoFF0c8FKYw,"I had been looking for some good bbq brisket. I had the brisket, collard greens and red beans and rice, with unsweetened apple blossom tea. The meal was good but the brisket was leaner than I am used to. I like the fat that is on one side, gives the meat a extra flavor. I could taste a slight smoke flavor but seasoning was kind of boring. They had some bottled seasoning called magic dust that added some flavor but I liked it better on the potatoe salad my fiance had than on the meat. Side portions were alittle small but the meat portion was ample. It came with a dinner roll and extra cornbread muffins were .49 cents. I would have liked if the muffins came with all the meals standard. or give an option for roll or muffin. All in all it was good but not great. Maybe next time I will try baby back ribs...It was just ok...not finger licking outstanding. We shareda  slice of pecan pie. It was good, sweet, we wanted warm and got a microwaved warm piece of pie. the center was cold, I will have to say the potato salad, tea (which comes in huge mason jars), and pie were my favorites. My fiance got the catfish, which was one big fillet, he said is good but I did not try. He loves the corn muffins and tea. On second thought, I may not go back for another visit and continue my quest to another joint.",onwuDaxErEJXbN0Y5yVanw,0,0,2,Ku8MoXd2eNDK_PKKXY_-_Q
507103,2016-05-30,2,LnRn6ECHdqTeoFF0c8FKYw,"The only redeeming feature this ""barbecue"" joint had to offer, was exceptional customer service.

 I spent nearly $60 on food that's all ended up in  the garbage. I got the 'GrandChamp' plate or whatever that cubed lunch box was called. The sauce was down right nasty. The overwhelming undertones between the meats,collard greens, & mashed potatoes became so relative & assertive. I tried adding a different sauce to it at home,but the damage had been done. Perhaps it may be impossible to escape the critique from a descendent of many,many butchers; but this location should really consider throwing out their supply of liquid smoke. Tsk,Tsk.

The meat came off the bone with ease. The dry rub, Magic Dust, added a ton of flavor. The drizzle of sauce was enough to add a tang to it without drowning it. It was perfect. The red beans and rice and homemade cole slaw were great. The large homemade roll with honey butter was great. Had the banana pudding for dessert. Tasted my wife's dessert, apple crisp. Both were yum. The decor and service were comfortable and low key. Not ostentatious like other barbeque places tend to be.

We sat down in a small group to eat and were greeted by Bella our waitress.

I ordered up a Kansas City burger and had string onions added to it.

For an appetizer the group settled on some fried pickles.  I have never eaten fried pickles and though tasty my mouth as of this time can not escape the briny, greasy coating it received.

When my burger arrived it was a tad dry.  I did not mind because I would just wash it down with my sweet tea.

They were very forthright with their lunch special which I appreciate. A lot of places try to hide their specials so that you spend more money. They had a couple of menus on the counter clearly displaying their $6.99 Brown Bag lunch special. You get a choice of pulled pork, pulled chicken, or brisket sandwich with a side and a medium drink. I went with the pulled chicken with baked beans. 

The pulled chicken sandwich was very tasty. The bun was soft and felt fresh. The chicken was tender, not dry and had plenty of white meat which I appreciate. The sauce was already on the meat. It was kinda a vinegar based sauce. Possibly some mustard in it based on the light color. I eat a lot of BBQ so I am pretty dead set on the type of sauce I prefer. This one really wasn't for me. Didn't have a really rich flavor like the type of sauce I prefer. Some may love it but I just thought it was OK. 

The beans were very good. Had some kidney beans mixed in the thick tomato based sauce the beans were in. Not sweet, more savory. And very tasty. 

I've had BBQ in Memphis and I remember it a little differently. But in fairness, to give this place the most accurate rating I would probably need to try their ribs which I assume is their signature.

2716977,2015-05-09,1,LnRn6ECHdqTeoFF0c8FKYw,"Memphis Barbecue is consistently good.  While there are better places to get barbecue around the valley, if you live or work in the northeast (near Nellis Air Force Base) or southeast part of town (near Warm Springs and Eastern in the Green Valley area), Memphis is a good option when you need to scratch the barbecue itch.  This review focuses on the location on N. Las Vegas Blvd near the intersection of Craig Rd., just outside of the Nellis Air Force Base main gate.

Memphis has all the usual favorites you look for in a barbecue joint:  pork, ribs, sausage, chicken, and a variety of sauces.  Your choice of sauces is limited when compared to other places, but there's something for everyone.  They also have a tasty dry seasoning at the table called ""Magic Dust"", great for sprinkling on just about anything you order.  If you like greens and aren't a purist, sprinkle a little on yours when they come to the table.
 
Be sure to try the daily soups.  My favorites are the Mississippi Tomato and the Parmesan Potato.  And if you're visiting for the first time, a great lunchtime order is The King (sandwich).  Try it with the cole slaw on the sandwich.  Delicious!  If you're in more of a salad mood but still want some barbecue, the Barbecue Salad won't disappoint.  The salad is basic, but you'll get a respectable pile of pulled pork on top, with your choice of dressings.  The balsamic vinaigrette works well because it doesn't mask the taste of the pork.  Or you can give pass on the dressing and use your choice of barbecue sauce.

All the usual soft drinks are available.  They come in large cups and your waiter or waitress will give you a fresh and full to-go cup if you ask before you leave.  For a pleasant change of pace, be sure to try the Sweet Apple Tea.

If you're on the go, you can call in an order and pick it up at the drive thru window.  It's worth taking a lap around the parking lot first though.  There can be a rather long wait at the drive thru, even when the line appears short.  It may be faster to park and pick your order up inside.

Need consistently good barbecue?  If you're near one of the Memphis locations, grab your friends and give it a try!",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,2,0,3,1g7y9199qafMPxpNitrqKA

We were greeted and asked how we were doing.  It was a 2 way conversation that seemed to be perfectly normal. However, we were all of the sudden told that the speaker was broken and we needed to pull up to the window to place our order. 
We drove up and there was another car at the window so we had to wait. And wait. And wait. And wait some more. After waiting about 15 minutes the car in front of us got their food and drove away. We came to the window and placed our order, paid (even gave a 10% tip although in hindsight, that was a ridiculous thing to have done) and waited. We'd ordered 2 sodas and thought for sure that they would be given to us immediately (and even had a hunch, albeit an incorrect one, that we may get the drinks for free on account of the incredibly long wait due to the ""broken"" speaker). After waiting another 20 minutes (we're now up to a 35 minute wait), we were given our food. I asked if there were rolls in any of the bags and she said, ""No."" I asked her if we could have some (they come with a meal inside, why do I have to ask for them in the drive thru?). She came back with them, said thank you and started to close the window. I stopped her and reminded her that she had forgotten our drinks. She politely apologized and got us our drinks. 
After getting home and unpacking our dinner, I was nothing short of pissed to discover that the sour cream, tomatoes, green onions and jalapeños for my nachos were nowhere to be found. What's the point of nachos without these? 
I angrily called the restaurant and the manager was apologetic and offered to put my name on a comp list for a free nachos on my next visit. I appreciate them rectifying the situation but am disappointed that the entire experience was such a bust in the first place. The broken speaker made the amount of time we had to wait virtually the same amount had we gone inside to eat. I realize it's not fast food but 35 minutes plus forgotten items is unacceptable. 
I love Memphis Bar-b-que for the food but to me, good food only goes so far. The food is what brings me there, the service is what keeps me coming back. On this night, it was a failure all around.",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,0,0,2,DOE1Z1uG5vbFGdtVJ6Ttiw

Generally speaking I find most of their meats to be on the dry side and sometimes even cold-ish. Not sure if they have trouble timing thier butts and brisket or just do one batch of meat a day then keep it barely warm? The smoky flavor is always there and the sauces are good enough, just seems to be lacking freshness and expertise, cooking time wise. 
   I went for a quick lunch today with a co-worker and had the burnt ends(Smoky brisket chunks)and the fries and salad. I think I actually go here more because I like the thick-ish friesand crisp side salad and high quality blue cheese dressing more than the meat itself which is kinda sad for a BBQ place. Again the flavorful burnt ends were kinda cold and certainly been sitting a while. This is not a dish that is gonna be fresh and juicy but Ive had these at many superior BBQ places where they retain a bit more moisture.

This business probably does half or more of its business with Air Force folks, and Friday, 8-7-15, some BUM came in with a woman and proceeded to fleece some poor AF Sergeant for lunch.  
Yes, this guy, claiming to be an Army vet, asked this generous guy to buy their lunch.
This gentleman, bless his soul, bought lunch for them.
The amazing part was when the waiter was told, the restaurant did not write off the moochers lunch and accepted payment from the kind Airman.

A young woman's voice came through the speaker box.  Sadly, she spoke veryveryveryvery fast and we couldn't understand our options.  Friend had a fish sandwich.  I asked for pulled pork sandwich.  Veryveryveryvery fast talking woman said ""OK, you have two sides with that,"" so we asked for two potato sides.  

We pulled forward, paid the bill (including a tip for fast talking woman and were asked to pull to the side for a short wait while the fish sandwich was prepared.  

The food was delivered about 15 minutes later, which is fine.  We understand that certain dishes are time consuming to prepare.  

It all fell apart when we found not one, not two but three potato sides in the bag and no pulled pork sandwich.   It seemed my hunger grew huge as we inspected every single tin-foiled wrapped item.   Then we looked at the bill.  Charged for three potato based sides and no pulled pork sandwich.  

I went into the restaurant with the bill.  The manager was indifferent to the error but prepared the sandwich I'd requested.   I asked the young fast talking girl how this could have happened since she read the order back to us correctly.   She didn't know.  Well I don't know how it happened either.   But I know what I said and I know she read it back to me.

Summing it up, great barbecue, but failure to listen is a major reason for problems in the world.  A simple, ""We apologize"", would have made things so much better.",LSQYVtef08IL1Y-7yEisIQ,0,0,2,Dyzcn5phXIIk6gCVtryD6w
3889957,2018-06-11,0,LnRn6ECHdqTeoFF0c8FKYw,"Of the more well-known barbecue joints in town, this is my favorite so far. In my opinion the barbecue here is generally more flavorful than at Famous Dave's another big player in town.

Memphis Championship Barbecue used to have a restaurant on Rainbow that I would regularly visit, but this closed down several years ago. Thus, the original restaurant near Nellis AFB on North Las Vegas Boulevard is now the most conveniently located  place for me to go to get my barbecue fix.

The reliability of receiving their promised birthday promotion (buy one meal and get one free) for people on the email list is sporadic at best. In some years - such as in 2017- I received it while this year (2018) it was once again a no-show. In years gone by, it used to arrive regularly like clockwork. Perhaps, Memphis plans to eliminate this promo in the near future or already has done so?

One of my personal favorites here is the brisket as part of either a two or three-meat combo plate with pulled pork or ribs as the remaining options.

However, my top choice by far is the Grand Champion Plate (currently about $24.00 and well worth it!) which essentially let's you try a little bit of everything barbecued that Memphis has to offer. This also was the entree that I would usually purchase with the aforementioned birthday promotion.

The servers are invariably friendly and attentive and the portions are generous, so wait until you have a big appetite before coming here to make the trip worthwhile.

I also got a side of fried okra.  I'll start with the okra... tasted ok, was very light and flaky.  Honestly I prefer a little bit more crisp and breading to the okra. 

Overall the buffalo chicken salad was pretty bland. You get your choice of blue cheese or ranch dressing. I chose ranch. The salad was you're typical iceberg salad mix, topped with two onion circles, croutons, 4 cherry tomatoes, cheddar cheese, and the buffalo chicken.

The burnt ends were nothing too exciting,  and had a lot of pieces of fat. Furthermore,  they weren't burnt ends. Very little bark was visible and lacked seasoning. The pork shoulder was really tender and juicy. I did find that all of the meat was a little weak on the smoked flavor.  The greens were good,  but they do make them sweeter. The baked beans were also good. I only gave it 3 stars due to the amount of fat chunks in my burnt ends, and lack of smoke flavor with no actual burnt ends .

5152260,2014-04-14,1,LnRn6ECHdqTeoFF0c8FKYw,"Being from eastern NC, I have pretty high standards for pork barbecue.  We had been to LA and then Vegas and were seriously missing sweet tea, so they hooked us right away with the 32-oz mason jars.  We had the fried pickles and onion straws combo basket for an app, it was delicious and plentiful for 2 people, we couldn't even finish it.    I had the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and collards.  The portion of pork was large and tasty, not the best BBQ I've ever had, but it was satisfying none-the-less.  The meat is not overly-seasoned, so they add their own sauce on top.  I would have preferred that they let me choose the sauce, but BBQ cooks are picky about what they put their name on, and this was their brand, so I played along and ultimately was not disappointed.  BBQ lovers know that everyone has their own recipe and I am glad to try them all.  

Being a picky southerner, I was hesitant to order the collards, just didn't think anyone in Las Vegas could cook them, if they'd even heard of them.  While I think they may have started with canned collards, they dressed them up in bacon and I was quite surprised how good they were.  The mashed potatoes were standard.  

Service was fast and friendly, although there was one waitress constantly bitching at the kitchen staff and other servers, but she wasn't ours.  I'm guessing she is either the boss or related to the owners, as the staff seemed to be putting up with her.",kqBYZ64GslITG3IJ7Fa-EQ,1,0,3,WDqAydCoIsmb6OPqv_1SPA

The other day, after work, neither my husband nor I felt like cooking, and we REALLY didn't want to order pizza again.  

My husband remembered Memphis BBQ, and said ""Why don't we order from there?""

So, we looked at the menu, and decided to order for pickup.

We had: 
The brisket sandwich with collard greens and mac n cheese, 
The catfish sandwich with potato salad and mac n cheese.

Everything was delicious!  The fish was cooked to perfection, served with a really good tartar sauce, lemons, and a little container of their vinegar slaw.  (I put that on top of the sammich.)  
The brisket was sooooooooo tender, but a tiny bit dry...but after putting some of their incredible BBQ sauce on...my husband couldn't eat it fast enough.  I had to fight him for a bite.  

The sides were really good too.  The only thing we weren't super pleased with were the greens.  They were ok, but super super spicy.  The mac n cheese was magical, and the potato salad tasted like my aunt's.  

Prices are really good too.  $21 for 2 good sized, delicious sandwiches, and 4 sides?  I'll take it.

5293726,2015-03-10,1,LnRn6ECHdqTeoFF0c8FKYw,"Was in Vegas with some friends I knew liked BBQ. I've eaten here before and it was pretty good.

We started with some fried pickles, they were tasty, the full order is pretty big. 

2 friends ordered the mini sliders, they have a variety of choices, and you pick 2 sides. They both liked them and liked the meats they chose. The sausage was a little too hot for my friend, it was OK for me.

Another friend ordered the St. Louis ribs which she liked.

I ordered the 2 item, St. Louis ribs and burnt ends. I loved the burnt ends which are tips of the brisket. The pieces were all fresh and moist, some brisket can be dry, which I really don't like. The sauce is different on the tips. The ribs were OK, not tender as I hoped, not tough, but I think they weren't freshly cooked. I think they were maybe from the day before, the meat wasn't smoked looking and juicy like my friend's. The BBQ sauce on the tips is the sticky sauce, which we all preferred over the sauce they have on the tables, which is watery and not that flavorful. 

Our server, Dana, was very nice and spent lots of time taking a picture of our group. She checked with us regularly, but not too often, and was cheerful, like she enjoyed her work. She was helpful and could answer the questions about the menu, not very common now days.
