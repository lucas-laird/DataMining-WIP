It is not the best pizza out there , but you get humongous slices at an affordable price.",kO2S7inf7iyWGWthA3iacQ,1,2,3,XiY6Vd2sPAdEJ2wMKoYjFw

This has to be the absolute worst pizza I've ever had. The crust was soggy. I can't stress that enough. It was as if you cook something on broil and the top gets crisp but the bottom never gets cooked through or as if you microwaved a day olds pizza. Maybe they should stick to hot dogs. I ended up throwing it away.",Txio9W1UYzMZB5q1XJo8QA,1,0,1,bzgKT-faNbcnEpuGD6Tg6A

I'm not even sure it was safe to eat type of warm, but I've eaten cold pizza before so I went for it. The salad I got was good. Asked for water to drink and they only offered bottle water for a price. Service was meh. I'd go back if I was drunk and needed some filler food.",y8J7NoPHUMJq2ZzNEFfN8w,0,0,2,Pw5osQ2qaAfQS97e_FuTRQ

Cashier had no personality, said ""what do you want?"" Great customer goes a longgggggg wayyyy! None found here, EXCEPT for one employee that i encountered. Gentlemen, did not get his name was so polite and even came over to my table to let me know that i had free refill. 

He even came a second time to ask if wanted more soda. I must have appeared thirsty. Great service by him.

Might give them a second shot only if my group wants too come here again.",z1QL9pkPgw08FwLiuqLX-w,2,1,3,qTCjyyP6KRZyajCfp0Nk8w
