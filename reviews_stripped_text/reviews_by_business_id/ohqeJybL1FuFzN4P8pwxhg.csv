You could see the workers dropping bagel slices on the floor and just going around in circles. There were workers there who were just standing around not doing anything but playing with their gloves.

I got my sandwich really quick and devoured it in 3 minutes---it was that good. The garlic bagel was my favorite part; I honestly would've eaten the bagel by itself with no shmear, it was that good. ¯\_(?)_/¯ One thing that I would've changed though is asking them to toast the bagel a little longer, other than that, its a sandwich I would recommend.

Breakfast sandwiches can take time and I do realize there can be easier orders to get out quick.

Is that her responsibility I'm not sure but when an order is filled and the person doesn't respond maybe the next time you fill another order you should probably call the order that hasn't been picked up.

Taken aback by her tone, I apologetically responded ""OK, how many do you have""? She angrily points down at the case and states ""2"".

I tell her ""I will buy the last 2 plain and pick some other flavors..."" I quickly scan and notice a new pretzel bagel and ask ""does your pretzel bagel have egg in them""? The one with the attitude incredulously replies ""ALL of our bagels have egg in them"" and I say ""I checked your website and most of your bagels are not made with eggs"" she then states ""We SELL the bagels, We don't MAKE them""!

Most baskets displaying the bagels were empty, so we had to ask if certain ones were available.  I waited about five minutes before someone took my order.  I ordered two breakfast sandwiches to go and asked if they could cut the sandwich in half and wrap it like a sandwich instead of putting it in a box.  I got a look of ""are you serious"", but she went ahead and did anyway.  After waiting what seems like forever (probably 10 minutes maybe) we finally got our order and they were both wrong!!!  

My son had the Applewood bacon and cheddar breakfast sandwich.  His sandwich was cold and had just a tiny piece of bacon in it.  My sandwich wasnt cut and didnt have any schmear on it!!!  My side orders were also missing.  

When I told the guy at the register what was wrong, he turned around to the other two women and from what I could understand, told them what I was missing.  Well they looked at me like they didnt care.  You know the feeling you get when someone is talking about you, well thats what I got, because the look that I got was enought to piss me off!!!

On both of our last 2 visits, each in the last three weeks, the stores available bagel variety has been roughly 2/3 of normal. If we were visiting late in the day this wouldn't be as much an issue since I can understand not wanting a bunch of end of day waste, but this is happening in the 9:30-10:30am time frame. Ironically as I write this a couple sat down at the table next to us an immediately the husband exclamed, ""This place is a s#!t hole and walked to the restroom to get some wet paper towels to wipe the table. He then pointed put to his wife that many other tables were dirty as well. For perspective there are currently 12 total people in the store about 6 on the patio and only one of those folks are actually in line ordering. The place is far from busy. A lady from still another table just approached the counter and asked for a wet rag so she can clean her own table. A year ago I wouldn't have recommended avoiding this location but I can't say the same today. On a positive note I had a Farmhouse sandwich on an asiago bagel and it was very good.",q2b4pAo_6tP7jNFKI5Hztw,1,0,2,DwCJvbEvqFbyip0ofusKnQ

I walked in and the place was clean and somewhat  busy, although  there wasn't much of a line. I told the lady it was my first time there, she was friendly  but spacey. While making my order she was talking to another  Co worker (the conversation  didn't seem work related).  my wife  and I decided to try a few bagels w/ light cream cheese and hot tea.  I was a bit annoyed when we were ordering. I asked what type of teas they had and the girl motioned towards the teas in front the register... I said oh!  And felt kinda of silly I didn't know that,  but then again it was my first time. When we paid I sort of just stood there when the lady just placed an empty cup on the counter I wasn't  sure what to do next, we quickly understood that we had to make our own tea (which we liked that part but the lady failed to tell us where to get the hot water)and we were still  wondering  what to do .... do we wait there for our order ? Or are they going to call me?   I mean come on I told the lady it was my first time :(   a little communication would be nice.  

After we got our order and got situated I was disappointed to see that our bagels had so much cream cheese  we had to scrape so much off (maybe if the lady paid a little attention  to the customer or if your not ready to serve people try   asking  me to wait or better yet ask some one  else  to tend the customers  until your done gossiping ) aside from that the bagels were so good. Very fresh in taste, I like my bagels to be toasted but soft in the center and our bagels were just that way.  We really liked them. And the tea was good.  I gave this place a 3 out of 5 for the costumer service. 

If I judged this place off  of the food I would give it a five. We would definitely  come back but maybe at a different  time.",HaJT3TVBPe0ZKb5lkGJTwQ,1,1,3,zyskqEnHO-AhLSFwmxwsmw

When we finally ordered we decided we wanted to take half a dozen bagels and cream cheese to take home and she just seemed so bothered that we were ordering again.

The dinning area is not up kept up tables are usually dirty and desperately needing wiped off floor needing swept  or trash needing emptied staff is not professional friendly or helpful at all they really don't give a rats ass at all you either want what they have or have nothing at all and they just go onto the next customer in line. Well one day there is not going to be that next customer in line and there all going to be saying should have done this or that.

Well today was not any different in fact Today was the final straw.

I need them for a company function. She says na not right now this is what we have right now pointing to the display  case. I was completely floored I didn't just want 2 or 3 bagels I was needing 3 dozen in total here yes 36 bagels and again  the girl looks at me and says. ""Na not right now"" I go really she goes yep not right now. Would you like anything else. I told her no thanks you don't have what I'm looking for or need I'll just go somewhere else. She goes ok have a nice day and immediately starts talking to the customer behind me. I did ask to speak to a manager and was told they were busy right now and the shift leader told me there was nothing that could be done right now. WOW really It was obvious they did not care or want this order or they would have offered something to accommodate the order. So it's completely obvious there not maintaining there store and obviously they are not making enough to accommodate the customer so Im not really sure what they are really doing besides standing around talking and visiting with each other. If I was the owner of the location I'd be pissed that I was losing customers and money was walking out the door.

Customer service is always spot on. The people working are very helpful and patient (goes a long way in coffee shops with intricate/extensive orders). Be sure to order a cup of coffee and try their freshly brewed Vanilla Hazelnut. MmMmmmmm, so good!!

Female employee: You're the one with the attitude. I'm sick of yours

Male employee: You know what? Why don't you shut it for me?

All of this is going on while they are schmear bagels and prepare drinks. I really thought they were going to fight in the café!

I ignored her and moved forward in the line. As I meditated on her behavior I wondered if she was the one that male employee was fighting with. Hey! Where was he?

""She's not very nice."" The lady behind me said to her husband. Well good. At least I wasn't the only one who had noticed. The sweet elderly couple behind me ordered the Bagel box and every time the elderly lady said a type of bagel she wanted, Linda would grab the bagel and throw it into the box like a repetitive ball into a catchers mitt. CLUNK! Then without any expression, except ""I plan on tapping you out face"" she'd say, ""and what else?"" CLUNK!
WOW! The elderly couple kept repeating, ""She's not very nice."" I could tell they were scared. The kind of scared where you're too damn old now to fight someone.

Finally when my order was ready one of the girls called my name, but another customer came up to the employee and asked for something. I kept saying while the employee held my bagel, ""That's mine! That's mine!"" But she continued to hold the bag. Another customer waiting intervened and said, ""Hey, you called her name. That's hers...""
She gave me a dirty look like I was lying and reluctantly handed me my power bar. I snatched that bag out of her hand and shoved her right in her face. She fell down and started crying. I heard the crowd of customers gasp but it was too late. By then I was out for blood. I hopped over the counter and started going after Linda. I hoped she really new MMA because her ass was mine.

Well...I snapped out of it. I woke up from my little daydream and took the bag from the rude employee muttering expletives under my breath. What's wrong with this staff? Thank God I fear jail.",jwvmw22-y4eMq2rzi0wAeQ,7,4,1,3Taboscy3TuGxgcNrOS36g

Even when extreme bisy , the staff has always been friendly. The bagel selection is extremely good and I haven't had a bad bagel there. The orange juice is fresh daily and they make the coffee on the spot. Most of the people they have on coffee duty do it extremely well. Even when super busy, the service is fast. Stay frosty, Einstein's.

They also have happy hour from 3 to 5 so you know, half off bagels and drinks are kind of cool.",1hJVutieYDBwGx8INWv3IA,0,1,5,XNdu3q9EtXc4BSCcObrBWA

I like it for the convenience and the Thin-tastic breakfast bagel sandwiches, which have egg whites, spinach, and asparagus on your choice of bagel.  Service here is always friendly and the wait is not long, even if there's a line.  The majority of customers always seem to be the senior crowd from Sun City; I think they congregate here at all hours.  You can usually find a newspaper that someone has left behind if you want to read one.  There are booths, a counter by the window, as well as outside seating.  For a quick meal, stop here.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,2,2,4,246E2E7giauwxban9AWN9Q

Now for the bad. I go there about twice a week, but no longer will. The last 5 visits, they have forgotten something in my order: Fruit yesterday, cookie last week - always something. Why ask if I want something if you are not going to include it? Just let me know you are going to take my money and give me nothing. Yes, I should have checked, but when they put a pickle in a paper bag, I assumed it was the cookie because I said ""No pickle"". There is one lady that never messes it up (I will update with her name, I forgot it), so if she is there, I will wait for her. If she is not there, I will leave. I realize that some of the employees do not speak English well and I don't speak Spanish, but when you repeat the order back to me correctly, I assume you understand it.

I never have an issue at any other location.",y_BXTp8fu6wkud-eY3We8A,1,0,1,vdjvaNQZkTqvOFtAYAe9LA

I understand they're busy, and they are super short staffed. So I patiently wait, and then get our bagels. Twenty minutes, again I know it's busy but I can't believe myself I waited that long for a bagel. Then I get my French toast bagel and you can taste onions. Same with my sons bagel.

The bagels are always fresh, I love the selection of cream cheese flavors, and the thin bagel sandwiches for breakfast or lunch are now my new favorite, particularly the asparagus, mushroom, cheese, and egg whites.  Mmmm, mmm, good. I am a big fan of their iced green tea too (free refills). Whenever I eat from here, I always feel like it is a healthier alternative.
