The classic burrito ($5) is a flour tortilla filled with lettuce, cheese, salsa and the protein of your choice.  I thought the carne asada was nicely flavored.  I've had their burritos served wet with green/red sauce and cheese, which is also a tasty option.  My husband didn't think the shrimp and fish tacos were anything special.  On the night we went, the restaurant was uncomfortably warm, it was actually hotter in the restaurant than outside, and this does not bode well for the summer months!",8euCyEtOwwtPw_sJ2VEeRg,0,0,3,knp2EaNWz0SExjlsvRTv7Q

Tried the wet baja lada tacos and they were a little to wet for my liking. Stick with the fish and it hits the spot at a very decent price.,to-2EIRXGkhV3dWcwnllig,2,1,3,JIfcZyRnNehmHUwFLY1c0Q

The staff had less personality than a wet rag, the ice tea dispenser was empty and when we got home with our order (I had ordered the salmon bowl) there was no slaw on my salmon.

We went on a Wednesday night.  The place had some people but not busy.  You order from a line, not waitress service, which is fine.  The girl who took our order was not friendly and even though she could tell it was our first visit, didn't help us in any way (there are lots of ordering options here).  She got two of the 4 orders wrong.  It took over 20 minutes for us to get our food which is ridiculous considering it was nothing more than taking prepared meats and putting them in a tortilla.  They completely lost the order of the guy who ordered in front of me.  The girl who took our order and then left the order station and began running food, all the time chatting on her cellphone.  When we finally got our food, the tortillas were very tough as though they had been sitting out all day.  The fillings (meats) were pretty good.  This place has tons of potential but lacks in leadership and caring about the product they deliver.  It looks like a decent place to sit and drink though.

The girl taking my order took 5 minutes to figure out how to put the order in. I asked for no onions so the girl said she would go back to the kitchen and give them a heads up in case the ticket was confusing. When I got my order the chefs had not looked at the receipt because the order had onions. 

The girl taking the order also put the sides in wrong - something I missed until I got home. 

Wahoos isn't cheap fast food, it's moderately priced - so I expect them to not mess up the order. They messed up twice.

I got the 3 minute burrito with cajun chicken smothered in green sauce. The chicken was very good, it was at least a whole breast of chicken cut up into big squares. The problem was the green sauce. It was some sort of cilantro cream sauce which would have been good if they hadn't of used 5 lbs of cilantro to make it. It was very overpowering and had that odd taste you get when you put way too much cilantro in something. The person I was with loves cilantro and it was even too much for her to handle.

The chips were decent and the guacamole was good. The green sauce just threw me for a loop because I expected a green chili sauce or a tomatillo sauce and then got this weird cilantro packed cream sauce. I think it would have tasted good if they could cut way back on the amount of cilantro they are putting in there.",CFty6Jcr-wprzBWvd5cWKg,2,0,2,88Knj4DNXlDSdEE2oJUGCw

After I paid (it was around $8) the lady gave me my reciept and walked away. Doootadooo.... I stood there wondering if I should wait or should I find a seat???  Hm I made my way to a table to wait for my food.  While I waited I was checking out the great beachy decor.  The patio looks so amazing.  I will definitely be back for that.  Sent me right back to the laid back outdoor beach bars in California. Sigh. 

My food was brought to me and I was on my way.  The cashier yelled ""have a great day"" and that made up for leaving me in limbo afew mins ago. When I got back to the office it was on!  The tacos were great.  I couldnt tell if the tacos were spicy of the green sauce I was pouring on it was.  Love spicay!  I did notice that one taco had cheese and one didnt.  Not quite sure why or how that happened but either way they were pretty good.  BTW green sauce is fat free a huge plus. ;)  The rice and beans I had a little of but the tacos pretty much filled me up.

So yes the atmosphere is cute, laid back and fun.  I definitely will be back to get my drink on - ON the patio this time and for sure will be doing the quicky lunch on my lunch break.

When I found out they built this location down the street from me, I thought ""Cool! But will it be the same? Especially being so far inland...""

I can tell you that this place has gone above and beyond anything that the SoCal locations have going.  The food is still great and cheap! $2.50 for a taco?  WTF are you kidding me?!  Pacificos $2?! So stoked!

Great food combined with a great staff led by bartender James ""Big Poppa"" is the recipe for a great overall experience!  I've made this place my home away from home.  I'm here almost 5 times a week, it's like having my own version of Cheers in my backyard... I sit down next to Norm, and Sam Malone already has my beer poured and my food on the way.  Couldn't ask for more.

If you've never been to a Wahoos start with a Cajun Fish taco and go from there, everything is good!

Sunday Brunch is also a great deal.  $6 gets you Carnitas with Eggs and all you can drink mamosas for an hour....  Sunday Funday! Give it a go if you can get up before 11:00am.

The bar was full, but the dining area only had two other people sitting in it and they already had their food. The waitress kept walking from the cash register to the kitchen every 3-4 minutes.  She never once stopped to ask for our drink/food orders. And she never even acknowledged us or said hi. After waiting for 15 minutes, we walked to the cash register to ask her when she would be able to take our order. She told us that their policy was for the customer to order at the cash register, and if we wanted another drink or anything else we would have to get up and walk back to the cash register. My friend and I have eaten here several times, an every time there was waiting staff. We ordered a drink, walked back to our table to look at the menu, and sat down. The waitress again walked right by us to go to the kitchen. Each trip to and from the kitchen put her within inches of our table. We walked up to the cash register to order our meal, but a male employee came from the kitchen to speak with the waitress just as we got there. The waitress gave us the finger (not the bad finger, she gave us the hold on finger). The two employees began to whisper and giggle with each other.

I went to all our stops that morning informing management that we would be coming through and around which time. All places seemed happy and accomidating as best they could. Manger of Wahoo's told me to call over when we were on our way. When I called (9:30pm) the hostess said management went home?!?! Quite confused I asked to speak to who was in charge. A bartender got on the phone. I told her I spoke to a manager earlier and we were on our way 20-25ppl. (not very interested)She said ok and hung up. Upon arriving the area in which I discussed with management that morning was not ready. The restuarant area was closed off? We had a friend in a wheel chair and had no access to the patio(you had to walk through the bar and between the high tops and bar.It was too narrow). So unfortunately we could not sit out there. We had to pull our own tables together. No one came to great us or offered to help. We all stood at the end of the bar together and waited for a bartender. The bar was not that packed and had two on staff at the time. One bartender finally came to help. In stead of staying there and getting through all our orders, she would take an order, leave help some other people and come back. All the while not letting us know she would be back. The other bartender stayed on her side of the bar and just chatted with others down there. Rather than help manage the bar. I must say that we had bartenders in our group as well as most of us live with in a 3-5mi radius of Boca Park. We heard no apology, heck we were barely spoken too. After taking over 45minutes for each of us to get a drink we decided to leave. We moved onto 3 ANGRY WIVES. They were ready for us. They kept an extra bartender and server on hand just to be ready for us. Job well done!! I'm sure they made a pretty penny off of our group.

To say the least, I love this place. So I figured I'd share my love for this place with my girlfriend - we'd been saying we were going to visit this one since we moved out here a year ago because she has never been.  Finally we were on our way to Target and hungry, so it was perfect timing.  I've been hyping this place up so much you'd think I had shares in Wahoo stocks or something.

We both got burritos and she also got the tortilla soup. To my disappointment, the soup was bland. Very bland. Like less flavor than Campbell's soup. It was literally chicken broth with an overload of canned veggies and a couple chunks of chicken. Needless to say she didn't finish it. After about 20 minutes of waiting for our burritos, we're discussing about just leaving and getting out money back due to the lengthy wait and lack of patrons. It didn't make sense. 

In the midst of waiting we had the pleasure of seeing the place robbed. Literally. Some guy stole the cash drop from the cashier and ran out of there. Quite the scene, if you ask me. Not that it was the restaurants fault for that, but after seeing that, our appetites were lost. Got a refund and quickly left with our money, just like the guy who robbed the place, but legally.

Another review, for another location, mentioned how healthy, tasty, and low-cal the shrimp burritos are here, and that is what I came for.

Ordered to go. Loved the beachy atmosphere with the tiki bar area, projected surfing/ocean scenes, and chill music. This is easily a place I could hang out for a while.

Service was friendly. Waited for my order at the bar, where I was asked for my ID even though I was just waiting. Bartendress was super sweet and apologetic about it.

Got the classic shrimp burrito, total was under $7 but it's not a burrito that is a meal on it's own (for my massive appetite). Flavors were good and fresh, simple shrimp in a teriyaki-like sauce with a bit of kick to it. Cabbage slaw, cheese, and very little else kept things fresh and healthy: no rice and beans in here!
Noticed they also had signage up that they'd recently added salmon to the menu- asked what cost would be for a salmon burrito on my next visit, and price was still under $7. Not bad at all!

Very pleasantly surprised by food quality, pricing, interior decor, and service here.

I came in to meet a friend with a cold unfortunately, and and my friend recommended to try a ""hot tottie"" which is usually an inconvenience to most bar tenders. Rob didn't break a sweat and broke them out like it was no ones business. It was seriously awesome.

Came in a week later to visit the same friend and was pleased to meet Marisela! Seriously the cutest bartender I've seen in this town! Very attentive, very nice, always paying attention to her guests, making sure everyone is okay. I appreciated hearing that from a bartender in this town, it's very uncommon honestly. 

I seriously can't wait to return. I hear there's a guy called ""Fluddy"" that's supposed to be the man here. Can't wait to meet him too. Seriously this is my new spot in Boca Park!",Z9-bpDBJcgCrbHVUNPMboQ,1,1,5,g_lQOnguidz2RgORrjZhaA

2196393,2014-02-28,0,78hGCrQ6wLA2yh8zMywnmw,"Well... it was okay. I definitely had higher expectations for this place, but I'm not exactly sure why. Wahoo's is super cute, very clean and everyone was extremely friendly. I enjoyed the surf/skate motif and found it really visually appealing. I wasn't quite sure what to order, but I ended up with a shrimp soft taco and a Cajun grilled fish enchillada. It totaled just under $7. You basically place your order at the bar and then they give you a number placard and they'll bring it out to you. Self seating. 

The restaurant was pretty empty, but it did seem to take awhile for the food to finally come out. It was good, very spicy and flavorful, but not very filling at all. The taco had a LOT of cabbage on it and was really small and difficult to pick up. I gave up trying and just ate it with a knife and fork. The enchillada was pretty good, but again on the small side.

I guess Wahoo's is fine if you are craving Mexican and seafood in a nice atmosphere, but I just felt a little let down. I think I could have had a more satisfying meal elsewhere for the same amount.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,1,0,3,OGv27DJED6Hz6lf0N_UaMw

I haven't had a decent fish taco anywhere in Vegas and was really looking forward to a great weekend treat. It pains me to say that this was perhaps the worst fish taco, or food in general, I have ever had! The fish was as dry as the desert, along with the taco shells, and the entire combo entree, complete with rice and beans, was essentially flavorless. 

The ordering area had a very conveyor belt like feeling, there is no salsa bar so if you are ordering to go, as I was, you will only get hot sauce if you remember to ask. The sauces themselves definitely had heat, but again nothing particularly interesting or memorable in the flavor department. 

On the upside, the restaurant itself has a fun, open feel with lots of big screens to watch sports and a great bar and patio. I suspect if you're interested in a neighborhood cerveza hang, you will be pleased, but as for the food I'd have to say stop at the Baja Fresh across the parking lot for a fairly decent fish taco before heading to Wahoo's to meet your amigos.",nx9h_wzI8S4yIVvxq2ZDCw,3,0,1,ZCoHWBVXvg8tcGKPTKeLtA

been a fan ever since.
it's tough not to be when you're from a socal beach city.
wahoo's is pretty much a staple for we beach folk.

i've always loved the laid back, island-aloha-vibe of the place.
i love that you can throw stickers on anything...the more, the better.
the vegas locations aren't quite as ""stuck-up"" as the cali locations yet, but i'm sure they'll eventually get there.
=)
it's pretty rad that there's a bar and gaming at the vegas locations.

the food is consistently good, not great.
they've always slightly overcooked my fish.
i think i'd give them a solid 5 stars if they'd just stop overcooking the fish.
i suppose it's not great that they're called wahoo's FISH tacos and the fish is just ok.
they should probably work on that.

the onion rings are the bomb tho!
my fave.

2318082,2017-02-11,2,78hGCrQ6wLA2yh8zMywnmw,"Great location, lots of individually-cable-boxed TVs, and cheapish beer. The food? Not great, but what I refer to as ""reliable"". (Still doesn't mean it's good.) Best bet are the à la carte enchiladas (menu says 3.49/each but they actually ring up less - don't tell anyone) and if you ask for pico de gallo on top, it's free, and you get a big smother of it on your enchiladas. UPDATE (5/24/2017): The enchiladas no longer ring up less, and they charge you for pico de gallo. The squeaky wheel got the grease - sorry!

Always pass on the carne asada here (it's super minced-up and can be rubbery) but do get the carnitas and/or the spicy fish as proteins. The best in-house hot sauce is Dexter Holland's own Gringo Bandito, which is another plus. They also have the standard Tabasco, Cholula and Tapatío trifecta.

The retractable garage-door in front of the bar is always open - and this place is almost never crowded. My guess is that it sustains itself on video poker revenue? Foodwise, this store probably does 15-20% of the business that the Huntington Beach location does - at best. I hope they stick around!",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,3,2,3,gZREOeYf3r5Q9RJeU_eDaQ

It wasn't super crowded at all which was nice because we easily got the bartenders attention every time we needed it. The outside/inside vibe of the bar is pretty awesome this time of year. I hate to say it, but I really can't comment on their drink selection because I am 25 and still am not well versed in alcohol. I usually stick to what I know which is either a Moscato or a Light Beer with Lime. They have light beer and limes but not the kind with the lime built into it, and they have white wine but not Moscato. I got bartenders choice of white wine and liked it and a blue moon which was good. We had quite a fun laugh when I accidently called light beer ""diet beer"" and thoroughly embarrassed my date. 

Happy hour chips and salsa was $1 a pretty decent appetizer. My partner in crime got the nachos, and they were pretty legit. Not special as far as the ingredient deck but just a good example of well-made bar food. I got one fish taco - I honestly prefer  Rubio's so I wouldn't come here for their fish tacos. It was slightly dry and the fish had the texture of chicken. I also got their cajun fries. They were normal fries, lol, they had a little cajun seasoning but once you dipped you couldn't even taste it. 

So a fun bar with loud TV's and a good atmosphere that isn't super busy even during the game.  The food is A-OK - so three stars. I'll be back.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,1,1,3,d7z4bKq2xpemZsyr0MvPlw

Went again on another trip and tried the Kahuna Grande: selected the spicy fish taco and chicken taquitos w/guac & sour cream - very good, not greasy at all (they do not use lard), tried the white beans I like better - quite saucy with a bit of zip.

Tried the Wahoo's salad with grilled Cajun fish - this is spicily wonderful!  The fish portion was as long as the platter (not bits of meat chopped up), and the cilantro dressing quite tasty!

I'm SoCA transplant so I really like the Wahoo's locations down at or near the beach.  They just seem to have better flair and flavor.

I'll still go to Wahoo's in Vegas... but I long for the Wahoo's of SoCA.

The Summerlin location has a small patio area so when it's nice outside you can get some Vitamin D.  However the patio is like sitting in the parking lot.  They also have a bar area so you can sit and have a beer at the bar while enjoying your fish tacos.

My ""go to"" dishes at Wahoo's is always the fish tacos or the fish plate. IMO... this last Friday I ordered the Fish Plate... Grilled with White Rice and Black Beans.  The fish was dry... the rice was dry and flavorless... the black beans were ok.

I've witnessed the owner and GM personally go to each customer to see how everything was going. I've seen this on ALL of the four times I have visited. The hardest things to convey to a service staff is to anticipate guests needs and recover from mistakes. They have obviously done a great job of that. Kudos!

I love the Cajun style fish and shrimp tacos. Really fresh on perfectly soft, corn tacos. BTW, their happy hour is pretty freakin awesome to take advantage on their indoor-outdoor patio. Way more of a bargain and laid back atmosphere than Kona Grill --in the same lot.

3251930,2014-04-15,1,78hGCrQ6wLA2yh8zMywnmw,"I used to come here often...both with the kids for food and also with the guys for drinks at the bar.  Tough to beat $2 Pacificos all night long.  

We visited last Friday night for dinner at around 7pm and the restaurant was empty.  I believe there was one other table of diners and about 7-8 rowdy drinkers at the bar.  One of the reasons we stopped coming to the bar was they attract a rough crowd.  Tattoos, smoking pot in the parking lot... Not passing judgment... Just not my scene.  

So tonight we order and sit at our table.  They had one guy working the cashier.  A young guy with black spiky hair.  The same guy was also delivering food to the tables.  Even though the restaurant was empty, he provided such poor service we'll never return to a Vegas Wahoos again.  We'll just wait until we go to Huntington Beach where they do it right.  

When he delivered the first portion of our food, I asked him for the green sauce.  He gave me a look as if I was being a pain, but he returned with the sauce.  When he returned with the rest of our order, my son asked for a knife.  He literally rolled his eyes and went straight to the bathroom.  

Now I know it's annoying when guests asked for things...especially when they don't ask for them at the same time, but our whole table was shocked at his response.  We looked at each other and waited to see whether he was going to come back.  Finally my 12 year old son got up and went behind the kitchen area to get his own knife!!!   Hahaha.  Unbelievable.

When the guy returned from the bathroom, I figured he would deliver the knife.   Nope...he stood in front of the TV and watched sports!!!  Check out the photo!!!  

The founder of Wahoo's was here at the grand opening.  He should reconsider his choice for area developer.  They know nothing about customer service.",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,2,1,2,wtTN-hvT629hXTqakgDWZQ

I'll give them the fact that it was getting late in the night, but the girl who was cleaning and taking our orders at the same time seemed a little annoyed that we were here to eat.

The food was OK as well.  I wasn't impressed with the chicken breast tacos (got one grilled and one Cajun).  It is hard to compare to the awesomeness of a Roberto's Chicken Taco.

The rice and beans were OK as well.  Nothing to write home about.

It was rather loud and the fact that it has a bar in the restaurant made for some unneeded distractions when trying to sit down and have a meal.  I wouldn't take my kids here, that's for sure.

If you haven't been here yourself, go ahead and give it a try.  Otherwise, I would suggest going to a Roberto's for some Mexican food.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,0,0,3,qc-_MgCKIK26c2n5koJPKw

I order the fish taco plate, that's why I am here.  My husband orders the '3 Minute Burrito', and my kids order nachos, a steak taco and a fish taco.  $45 later, we get our number and take a seat.  We wait, and wait and wait for 28 minutes!!!  I get up to look for a manager or someone to assist me to get my food.  The runner speaks no English, neither does the kitchen staff.  Food finally arrives at the table.  It is only the 3 minute burrito, taking only 31 minutes. Then they bring the kids' plates.  The sides were wrong, the nachos looked like something I make in the microwave at home.  Not thrilled with the flavor profile of the fish taco, I have had better tacos at Rubios...

The food is tasty, but the menu is a little overwhelming.  The first time I went, I was like, ""Where are just fish tacos?""  Apparently, you pick your vehicle (taco, burrito, etc.), then you choose your innards (fish, chicken, tofu (!), mushrooms (!), etc), then you choose your rice (brown rice option (!)) and beans.  The fish tacos were a little dry and I would have liked more sauce.  I also got some sort of tofu bowl that I don't remember the name of, and it was goooood.  I prefer the Cajun white beans to the black beans (great flavor), but the rice lacks something (read: flavor).

They have a full bar and a nice happy hour special each day.  They have this nifty margarita where they stick a mini Corona in it.  It's fun and very college-Spring-Break inspired.

But I think my favorite part of the restaurant is the open patio.  The window/wall opens up from the bar area to a nice little patio with comfortable seating.  My only wish was that it didn't over look a black asphalt parking lot, but I'll take some al fresco drinking and eating any day, and I'll just imagine that the black asphalt is ocean water while I eat my fish taco and drink my beer/margarita concoction.",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,2,1,4,qgtRikaAVkVYllqR8p9jCQ

You would think the manger of all people could get an order right but didn't. He didn't even write our order down which says a lot, bc it's 50/50 if it's going to come out correct. Which at the time I placed the order I assume he was just the bartender but then finding out he himself was the manger he should of known first hand the waitress or waiter is suppose and should always write the order down. Got our order wrong the first time it was brought out then.. Sent it back.. Then had the nerve to pull the waitress aside a table over from me and tell her what I ordered, Wasnt was what I ordered casually.. Like it didn't matter.. How rude and unprofessional. 1st off I did order it the right way but probably bc he didn't write anything down it came out wrong, along with my husband order as well. Anyways we ended up leaving and pissed off... Not a happy customer and will never go back as long as he's behind the bar! #pissed!!!!!!",qhVFVjwVKJqGYpxHsTmCeg,0,0,1,JYPsAA3l_AGJZxOuiU0bmQ

When you walk in this place, it's got a really good vibe, skate gear and logos splattered from wall to wall and has a real open floor plan. The problem is that you aren't sure whether to sit down or find somewhere to place an order. If you walk to the right, you'll find the bar, and this is actually where you place your order - it's quite odd. The menu is pretty clear, and hangs on the wall. Kacie was definitely rude. I asked her what was in draft. She huffed and said ""blah blah blah Sam Adams"" I asked which Sam Adams and she replied with ""Uh...the regular one."" Service fail, Kacie.

The food was fantastic. I got the fish tacos and the husband got the shrimp tacos, we traded plates after eating one of each so we could share. Holy Moses! They were fantastic! I liked the fish better, but I had the shrimp second, so maybe that's why the tortilla was falling apart so much. It ended up being a big mess in my hand (that's what she said?). The Maui beer battered onion rings were an 'oh wow' situation. Absolutely delicious and came with ketchup and ranch. 

We'll absolutely be back for more. They're open until 2am, so a perfect spot for a late-night nosh.

I really enjoy their wet (with Green Sauce) outer reef burrito, accompanied by wahoos Mr. Lee's sauce. It's pretty enjoyable. I've given them three stars because I don't know what's happened as of late, but I feel like I'm always getting skimped when coming here. You pay up front before you've received any food, and everything cost extra. .75 for this, an extra 1.50 for that, blah blah blah. Turns out by the time you get 2 burritos, about 13 chips with salsa, plus the salsas are not something that's included,and a drink each it comes out to the best part of $40. 
Don't get me wrong I've paid it before and I'll probably pay it again, but every time I go, the fish in the burrito is smaller, what used to be refilled chips with salsa is now $3 or $4 bucks every time you want 13 more chips. The serving staff has become awkward, always on their phones, not paying attention to what's happening inside, there's a bar tender, older guy with a goatee, and other than the fact he's seen us 50 times he asks to see our ID every time, he's the only really nice personable guy there. 
I guess why it sucks is Wahoo's has always been somewhere I've been excited to go, but who wants to go to a place where they already know they're going to get screwed (not in the good way) before they even eat their meal? I'm worried of it sliding further downhill and I hope things go back to the way they were before.",-ePHYG4rJIWU-5V80uM6LQ,0,0,3,KlXiljZ9H4yukp3YSZENpw

The tacos were really pretty tasty. Fish tacos with the slaw was really good. Fish was moist and meaty, able to stand up to the toppings, but at the same time, it was light and refreshing. 

The Cajun beans were spicy, but not great, soft and mushy. The rice was also kinda soft and lacking architecture to hold the beans and the combo meal together.

4014603,2013-08-08,0,78hGCrQ6wLA2yh8zMywnmw,"Just about as good as the rest.

Whenever we used to drive to Cali for vacation, we almost always stopped at Wahoo's for some fish tacos!  Was just part of the trip.  Now...wow, we have multiple locations here in Las Vegas!  Who knew fish could swim to the desert?

All the same food available at other Wahoo's can be had here.  They are turning into quite the chain!  Please guys don't get too much bigger because I would like the quality and down-home feel to stay the same.  Don't overdo corporate!

Biggest difference here?  The ambiance.  In Cali I'm used to seeing surfers, skaters, and bums all partaking in the ritual that is a fish taco.  Now here in Vegas?  Businessmen, casino workers, and soccer moms!  What is going on?  Where is the sand?  Well we do have sand.  Where is the sun?  Well we do have sun.  Where is the smell of salt water and sun tan lotion?  It truly makes a difference.  My fish taco experience always follows with the smell of the beach and an ice cold Corona.  I do it like Vin Diesel & Paul Walker do!  It just feels off here in Las Vegas!

Luckily the food is still A-OK.  Lots of healthy and nutritious eats with decent prices.  Although I did notice the prices at this location seem a tad higher than some of it's Cali counterparts.  No matter, at least now I don't have to drive to another state for my fish taco fix!

I usually go to Wahoo's and order the same thing every time.  The combo with a fish burrito, fish taco, rice & black beans.  I love that teriyaki sauce they have so I always get a side of it for my burrito and my rice.  Asian I guess, can't get away from the soy sauce!  I love the crunch the cabbage provides on the fish taco, and I have a hard time replicating it at home.  Must be the fish I'm guessing, my damn cheap @$$ tilapia fillets aren't cutting it.  I enjoy the simple dressing on the burrito:  fish, pico de gallo, and their 'white sauce' (which I'm hoping is a sour cream concoction).  I kick that sucker up with teriyaki sauce and Tapatio....muy delicioso!  The side of rice & black beans fill my belly up to full.  Not a bad combo for around $8.  

I've had their chicken and beef before on the tacos and burritos (and it's alright), but I constantly come back to the beloved fish taco.  Seems to be my favorite staple at Wahoo's.  Yeah...hello...Wahoo's FISH TACO!  So the damn fish better be good.

This Wahoo's has a nice large bar area attached to the restaurant, and I can see that it is bustling most nights.  Probably have some happy hour specials I need to inquire about.  But the place is mainly a grab-and-go or stay for a quick meal type of place.  There's noise everywhere, so don't come here for no intimate date!

As long as the crowds come and the food stay consistent, this Wahoo's should be just fine.  But guys, stop creeping up on the prices, eh?  That's like a great white shark ruining your wave.  Or Tara Reid, surviving the onslaught that is 'Sharknado'.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,1,4,RHzqNwbUkVCiNHx8Wrczsg

I mean, disgusting, public bus station levels of dirty (see my photo). I kept hearing my Gradmama's voice in my head saying ""if the bathrooms are dirty, imagine how dirty the kitchen is,"" something she would always say. Even after I alerted three employees to the dire situation in the toilets (no paper, no hand soap -- GROSS), nobody cared to do anything about it. Because of this, I am not sure I will return because if people aren't washing their hands...well, you know what can happen! Luckily I had my emergency bottle of hand sanitizer in my handbag.

Back to the food: the chips and guacamole were really bad. Don't waste your money paying for either. The shrimp and fish tacos were tasty. Nothing great but a good alternative to steak or chicken. The low carb tacos were served in big lettuce leaves that looked and felt like you were eating a ""real"" taco shell but they were topped with so much cabbage and lettuce ""filler"" that you only got a little spoonful of protein.

The food was ok, but nothing special. We go to Mexico and Hawaii fairly often and always get fish tacos, so our bar for tasty tacos is high. The tacos here were average. We also had the steak teriyaki and it was lackluster as well. The teriyaki sauce was runny and bland. 

On top of all that, the soda machine was out. Of course we didn't know that until we got our drinks and took a swig of water and soda syrup. Yuck! We told an employee walking by and they told us that they knew about it and were trying to fix it. About 20 minutes later, we hadn't seen anyone about the soda, even though we saw them bring in soda in cans they had bought for people to have, but i didn't see any of those passed out either. We couldn't ask them to give us one because we couldn't get anyone to come over to us. Everyone seemed to be running around crazy like. I would have hoped to get sodas since we paid for them, but we never did nor did we get a refund on them. Quite disappointing. 

When we were getting ready to leave, and quite thirsty, a little boy, maybe 10 and obviously the owner's kid, came by with a sweet treat for my daughter and gave us coupons to come back.

I ordered a teriyaki bowl with chicken and it just tasted really bad. I had asked for no rice so instead I got a very messy black bean soupy salad. The whole combo was just odd to say the least. 

I think I would have preferred the beans on the side and I'm surprised that they did not pay attention to this small, but important detail. My whole dish became soggy and was not appetizing at all.

I think next time I'll order some tacos and not subtract anything and hopefully that'll be a better option. I will say that I did try their chips and salsa and those are pretty darn tasty.

It sits in the same shopping area as Target, Starbucks, Justice (yes, I have two daughters), Total Wine, Tilly's and many other great places.  

The family dined here and though kids are not allowed on the patio (which looks waaaay cool and comfortable given the right temperature and no summer winds), the inside is very cool, SoCal and beachy!  I love it!  There are TVs scattered throughout for my sports loving husband so that's always a bonus too. 

We had the chicken tacos and Wahoo salad.  The Wahoo salad was great - not amazing, but I'd definitely have it again.  Hubby had the chicken tacos which he said were really good.  No real complaints -- the menu is pretty diverse, you can order a cheeseburger if that's what your tummy desires! My daughter had the kids quesadilla which she devoured, but quesadillas aren't exactly a trick to make.

This was our first time eating at a Wahoos. We were expecting it to be just your typical fast food type of restaurant but was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is a step up from that.  It has a nice bright lay out with lots of seating. The decor is Southern California beach theme. It has a bar in the middle with an open wall to outside seating. It has a real ""vacation"" type feel to the place.
You do order at the counter  but your food is brought out to you at your table. My wife and I had the Cajun Fish Tacos and our daughter had the Cajun Shrimp Taco. The menu only offers the corn tortellia which none of us really like. But if you ask for flour tortilla when you order they do have it. They say the wahoo fish is caught out of the ocean and delivered fresh to the store daily. Our serving size was plenty big enough and all three agreed the tacos were very good. Being able to feed a family of 3 for under $20 in this town is pretty good!
The only draw back is they have some excellent outdoor seating but it is considered part of the bar area and anyone under 21 is not allowed to sit out there. It is hard to find a place to take families these days that is a fun place that offers a good economical meal. This place is certainly a great place for families.

I had the fish, shrimp, and steak with kimchi tacos; chips and salsa; cajun fries; and churro chips. I normally don't care too much for chips and salsa but their salsa was pretty good. Chunky with a good spice level.
The cajun fries could have been fried for a few extra minutes. I like my fries crispy, though their's wasn't soggy but it wasn't as crispy as I'd like my fries to be.
Churro chips are a unique spin on churros. I love churro's and wish they actually had the real deal. What they have is tortilla chips fried and sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon. 
Now the tacos I loved! Surprisingly my favorite was the kimchi steak taco. I tend to skip anything steak unless I'm at a steak house. The steak was cooked tender and I did not have any chewy pieces (I hate that), and the kimchi made it ever so flavorful. The fish and shrimp tacos had slaw on top and were delicious as well. 
Service is fast and friendly and prices are super reasonable. Tacos are about $3 a piece.

Typically I head to Rubio's if I want fish tacos, but I happened to be in the area and Wahoo's was close. Because I'm comparing the fish tacos to many, many fish tacos I have eaten in my day the rating is low. 

The inside of the restaurant is a little out-there for me - the artwork on the tables, the over-done surfer theme, etc. I get it, but it's kind of too in your face.

Service was OK. I got my food to-go so I can't comment on much besides the woman who took my order. I asked for recommendations and she couldn't really help me out, so I just said, give me fish tacos. But then I had to go through - do I want them Cajun style? Do I want a combo? Do I want cole slaw/regular dressings on them? The good thing here is - the variety.

I ended up with a 2-taco combo with brown rice and black beans. The rice was disappointing mostly because I expect rice to have a bit more flavor at joints like this, especially with the ""taco"" theme (think: spice, not: bland). Beans were well-cooked and flavorful. 

Tacos - I got one of each: one regular fish, one Cajun flavored. Believe me, get the Cajun flavored all the way. The regular fish taco was a huge let down compared to the Cajun. I also got the slaw topping, which was OK, save for the bits of CILANTRO I had to pick out of my tacos. *shakes in disgust* All in all the flavors are there, but these fish tacos were a bit on the small side IMO.

Overall I've had better fish tacos elsewhere and I will most likely be heading to Rubio's the next time I have a craving.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,2,7zA6hB7aAn-7a17M7P2l7Q

The tacos have a good heft to them, being about $3.50 per taco, it was worth the price. They also provide a good variety of hot sauces at the table and even soy sauce - if that's your thing. The balance of flavor was great. There was crunch, citrus, and spice. Most importantly, there was enough fish to stand up to the toppings.

Every taco has a nice, meaty cut of fish. No skimpy filet here! We order it Cajun, as I'm sure the regular grilled fish tastes bland or rather ordinary. The Cajun fish tacos are best with citrus slaw and is worth the few extra cents. Although the fish is inconsistent (sometimes perfectly flaky, other times, dry), I really do enjoy the flavors: the fish is spicy and flavorful, the slaw is crunchy and tangy, and the tortilla it is so delicately wrapped in is slightly sweet.

I honestly don't feel comfortable sitting here or staying too long. It doesn't look very neat. The walls are a cool shade of blue and covered in posters and signs. Coming inside, there's a bar to the right, which I assume is for sports fans who like to chomp on burritos while watching a game.

The pico was okay, it didn't have too much flavor.  The soda station was not fully stocked at all which was strange because it was not busy at all.

Ask for some limes and sauces to dress it to your liking. They have sauces they don't really mention on the menu nor ask you if you want like their green sauce, white sauce, teriyaki or the Mr. Lees which is a spicy tomato paste sauce.

The taquitos were nice and crispy, not oily like other places have. There was a really nice man, I wish I got his name. :/ He was very acommodating with lowering the volume of the music outside so hubby and I can talk to each other.

I checked all the options and saw the Fast Break burrito for $5.95 and compared to the rest of the items, it seemed favorable. 

When I went to the register my girlfriend and I ordered the Fast Break burrito. When I was ready to pay it came out higher than I expected. I asked Irany why it was higher than advertised and she argued that's how much it was. My girl friend had to go to the menu up front just to point it out. Irany and her coworker just laughed it off and said that's an old price, her manager would take it down. That got me upset. 

When I got my food, the Fast Break Cajun Chicken burrito, It was OKAY. Although the chicken had a lot of flavor, the rest of the burrito was quite bland. It was only rice and little sauce.

This place has two main attractions, dining room and the bar.

The dining room is set up in a seat yourself fashion. You first order, then you pick a place to sit, then they deliver your food to you by name.

I ordered a Wahoo (ono fished) grilled burrito wet. Both of the enchilada sauces are delightful. I asked to sample each and they let me get both (half and half). My food came out quickly and it was fresh.

The house salsa was lack luster. Nice veggie taste, but nothing special or memorable.  Mr. Lee's sauce was the business: sweet and spicy and thick. (I swear there is teriyaki in there). Get it! You'll thank me later. 

The bar has great beer specials. They have a variety (Mexican and American) on tap and they are around $2.11 a piece and half that during happy hour.

My girlfriend and I would frequent the location near the 215 and Rainbow off Sunset quite often on our lunch breaks. The staff was great and knew us by name, but it never really felt like a Wahoo's like back home. There were no windows :(

By luck we found this Wahoo's while on a work errand one day. WHAT. A. TREAT. We happened to sit down at the outside bar at just the right time of day and just the right time of the year. The breeze blowing on our backs kept us cool as the sun beat down from the sky. The tasty ice cold draft Pacifico ran down my throat and at the exact time we silently soaked in the glory, turned to look at each other and realized we had found it. It felt JUST like we were sitting on the Southern California Coast. It feels JUST like home. There is a open patio with couches and a fire pit next to the indoor/outdoor bar, and the corner location is perfect boasting floor to ceiling windowed walls. It's nice and open.

I've always been a huge fan of the Baja-ladas. Flour tortillas filled with chicken, tomatoes, spinach, and cream cheese. Pair that with a frosty draft beer and you are set.

This Wahoo's has a ""house special"" green sauce. They mix some spicy chili powder goodness into the already great green sauce. BOMB DOT COM.

The location of this Wahoo's is to-die-for. It's located right smack dab in the middle of Boca Park surrounded by great shops and minutes from Red Rock Casino.

Think of this place as the Vegas version of the little corner joint on Wilshire Blvd.  This place SO reminds me of calypso music:  the kind you listen to on an ultimate Sunday afternoon, lounging around with a glass of pina colada in your hand, getting slowly and happily drunk.  So ultimately my disappointment with the food will certainly get a chance to redeem itself the next time I go back.

Located in another ""oh, what it could have been"" place, Boca Park, you find yourself in a bright, surfing USA type setting with lots of bright color accents on white base.  The place has active but laid-back energy that fits the setting as well.  Upon walking in, there is an order counter in front, tables to the left and behind the counter, and a large bar to the right.  There are TVs everywhere including all around the large square bar, a perfect place to watch the games and drink to your delight.  You literally feel like you're at some divey surfer bar, sans the grime and sand.  

The staff is pleasant and acceptably prompt, and orders are efficiently filled although I wouldn't say it's lightening fast.  We tried carne asada, pescado, and carnitas tacos, and all were acceptable without being outstanding.  It looks delicious, but is somewhat underwhelming and that 3-star food results in the loss of a big star from the 5-star setting.  However it is certainly more than adequate for Saturday and Sunday afternoons watching football, avoiding the typical dark, cave-like settings most bars seem to think everybody wants.  So it almost is the perfect sports bar - now only if they had better food and some calypso music!

I grew up in SoCal, and embarrassingly had never eaten at Wahoo's....I mean, it's a chain fish taco place, how could it be any better than El Pescador or The Best Fish Tacos in Ensada? Well, okay, it's not.... BUT it's darn good for a grilled fresh fish taco and considering I'm in the middle of the desert, that's pretty awesome!  

I have a hard time deciding between the original style vs. the citrus slaw bc both are equally yummy in my opinion: the citrus slaw is fresh and compliments the fish well, but the green sauce is soooo good!  I always just end up ordering one of each! Problem solved!

The decor here is casual surfer/skater hangout, and they're always playing chill rock/alt that reminds me of carefree high school days in the sun. The bar always has at least 2-3 people there (even in the early weekday afternoon!), and I can only imagine it being more popular after work lets out. 

I live so close to Boca Park, I'll be back often!! Kowabunga dude!

I discovered wahoos in Cali and was so stoked that there was one so close to my job. It's not exactly hiding, but it's just in a location that very easy to not notice, at least for me, but now I always see it
What I love about wahoos is the atmosphere. When I come for lunch it's a nice quiet restaurant, when I come for happy hour it's a raucous bar that happens to serve really good food. They have tons of drink specials from $2 pacificos, $6 patron and tons of nfl specials. The bartenders are always cool and good conversation even when it gets super busy
The food is well above average, as everything is build your own so you can get fish or shrimp on anything.im always there for a reef burrito and I throw fish on it. 

TL;DR
a very good environment reminiscent of SoCal with good Mexican food and cheap alcohol",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,3,4,4,dwF-Fc9bwjkWDCHBwxGnXA

5938296,2013-06-06,0,78hGCrQ6wLA2yh8zMywnmw,"I have a major bone to pick with the management of these stores.  Had a couple of really bad customer service experiences with their server, Candi, attempted to file a complaint about it and nothing was ever done.  I have spent a ridiculous amount of time just trying to get someone to acknowledge the issue and tell me they would look into it and they couldn't even give me that.  I was a regular for several months, spent my last birthday at this location, have NEVER had an issue worth filing a complaint about in my life and they just ignore me??  GREAT customer service!  You can check out my review on the Sunset store for more details about what went down.  Just sharing here because I know the management has gone back and forth between both of these locations.  I also heard that Candi was transferred to Boca Park once or twice because of issues she was having at the Sunset location.

Bottom line, if you have a complaint these people will NOT hear you out or do anything about it.  They just don't care about the customers so, in my opinion, they shouldn't have any.  If you've ever had an issue with Candi or any other servers please have enough respect for yourself to just walk away and take your business elsewhere.  These people don't deserve your money.",dpr6pJo-OkayVuoYkmf2hA,7,2,1,7JyhhAxXFFJH4mgrKMU67A

Music army a decent level so we could talk Food was delivered to table no one every came by to check if things were fine  there are a bunch of hot sauces in a 6 pack on the table. Mine were mostly empty or filthy - I grabbed an adjacent tables 6 pack. 
Underwhelming, probably would not return",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,3,0,2,gph8sJP-ZbBOezXtfnY1kg
5985127,2017-10-08,0,78hGCrQ6wLA2yh8zMywnmw,"I randomly popped in here yesterday to catch some football and a bite, as someone who doesn't get out much I could tell as I was walking in that I made a good choice. There was a good amount of fellow football fans who had the same plan. 

You can definitely tell this place has a lot of good regulars, but if you're a newbie you aren't ignored. As someone that isn't a drinker, I get left hanging at other places after they hear my water order...NOT THE CASE AT ALL HERE. Marisela was eager to grab my water and even dropped off a menu, in the midst of her full bar of customers. 

Shortly after, my food order goes in (I'm a taco fiend so naturally that was what ordered) on a busy day like this it was out surprisingly fast, and was exactly what I hoped for. I was continuously checked on and was asked if there was anything I needed, I seriously couldn't count on both hands how many times I was checked...I love that! Even a low spending visitor is treated like something special. 

I'll definitely have to return to the place some time in the future, Sunday mornings Marisela seems to be the favorite, but I heard many GREAT things about another employee who was simply called ""Floody"". Every assumed regular I met seems to love them both. Even though I'm not much of a drinker, the employees, service and tacos are more than enough for me to return!",AtB2P0nqhJo_AwHncfs7oQ,1,1,5,NQsyhNE6fmn50EGCuicwPw
