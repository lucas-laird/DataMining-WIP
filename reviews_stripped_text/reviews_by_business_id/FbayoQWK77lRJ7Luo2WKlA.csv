It's mostly like any other Panda, except this location, like mall locations, doesn't have the fresh brewed China MIst iced tea, which is the best iced tea that I've had at any fast food locations.  Also, no free refills  =(

The food is pretty much the same, although it seems like the rice and noodles are a little more greasy and tired looking than at my Panda.  I'll keep eating there, but it's not my favorite Panda Express location.",_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ,0,0,3,5zVv3qIaVqGIQEAdVjdkFA

After staying a nice weekend there, we left our hotel at 11am, hungry. We stopped by the mall and were just buying some extra things for ourselves before go to eat. We went to the food court and I spotted Panda Express.
Man, I love orange chicken. I won't eat anything but orange chicken. I hate teriyaki, sushi and egg rolls. Only orange chicken makes me crazy.
Desperate for some, I told my boyfriend I wanted to eat there and he agree.
I ordered my favorite plate and sat with it. Mmmmm the smell....
And then, the taste. Delicious. And spicy. It was burning my throat. I started to drink water. And more, and more. The more I ate, the more I felt like not eating, and it burned more inside. My boyfriend, used to hot salsa since he was a kid, tried and said it wasn't spicy. Duh.
I am not used to freaking spicy food and I hate anything spicy.
I was soooo mad....
I can't complain of the service, but the food.... the food sucks!
2 stars for service.

ps:I wasn't smart: I thought that, perhaps, only this Panda Express had spicy orange chicken. And tried another one. Burned again.",tBldrCI2KDA_WfYNloHqsA,4,3,2,BKxL1ZayAyM4Xj2xa13_tQ

Food tasted like it had been sitting there for a while. Literally 45 minutes after eating started feeling queasy and nauseous, then BOOM! Been stuck in the hotel room ever since yesterday! I'm upstairs! Right now! cuz of that stupid motherf*#!ing squalor Buffalo Bills calls a ""restaurant"". Had to post asap to forewarn other visitors. & the sad part is that I'm a frequent buffalo bills/ primm guest :( I'm so disappointed right now.

 I'm not saying panda express is a bad place to get food but STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!",eXh5xkbvmNiOajKDi1vXwg,2,0,1,B_6eBW2WaU_6Y4Un_K4I_w

At least have the courtesy to make an announcement to the crowd when there's a line 20 people deep.


Ridiculous.",KoqgLunYF1E5Rr1Qe8v_Ng,0,0,1,8GHtske6lRATDmcsT1x4uA
