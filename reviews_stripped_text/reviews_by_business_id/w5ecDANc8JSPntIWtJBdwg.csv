1308782,2011-02-19,0,w5ecDANc8JSPntIWtJBdwg,My husband and I have tried a few local bar and grills around Las Vegas.  Putter's definitely rates as one of the best.  The breakfast items were good and they have pretty sizable portions.  Definitely worth your money.,OTIfaTzr5tT6pIyq4mu47A,0,0,4,9mPqRSp_65vkZd_NvamTpA

The manager is a disgusting pig w women, the restaurant has been a few different places, separate from the bar so you need to tip both for service. Back to putters now, still a little drug spot.",tMmCvSF1EzVjBhR1w-j1UQ,0,0,1,6lh1CqlW5g6MwHw_JSYmZQ
