Also the waitresses always have a goddamn attitude. No reply when you say thank you, and make faces as if what you're asking is a bother.  With service this bad you might as well pay the extra money and go somewhere else. They only give you stand up service when the owner is in the restaurant.",1nnOZB0hzatnJzM7G4pUqQ,2,0,1,dFqFXHqoZWa4WGczMZorQg

We're from NYC (where Colombian restaurants are abundant) and we couldn't wait.The 1 star is because the waiter was very nice and attentive. That being said, the food is awful. I wish I were the kind of person who could complain, but I've worked in restaurants so many years I can't. So we just got out as fast as we could. Arepas con Queso were maybe OK, and that's it. My Chuleta Empanizada was smaller than the palm of my hand, smelled weird and old, tasted chewy, and came with greasy fried platanos and withered salad. $12? Are you joking? Bandeja paisa? No better. Cold, weird smelling sausage, hard cooked egg, and questionable tasting meat. Bunuelos- no sauce, no dulce de leche, nothing. So disappointing. Why can't Las Vegans get decent Colombian food?

The menu states that they source from good places, which is nice to see. I don't think they serve liquor (yet) -- but if/when they do, I hope they offer a selection of Colombian beers (Club Colombia, Pilsen, Poker, Aguila). 

It would be nice if they had some music going in the place too -- when you're in Colombia it's common to mix local music with the restaurant experience -- they should do that. 

The menu is limited and certain items are only available certain days of the week, which speaks to the freshness of what you are getting and that they are new and don't want to be throwing out inventory until they get a sense of what customers want. 

All in all, a nice restaurant serving authentic Colombian food -- a rarity in Vegas. Please support them with your business, as we need more of these family owned places in town.",MsQdQikXJd5PG3FVkPo4yw,2,0,4,dNTcPyaXKoMjRVsv6Vb8Kg

She kept assisting another table and whenever we would call her (respectfully, of course) she would literally roll her eyes like if we were bothering her and keep walking to the kitchen.

We ordered our food and waited over an hour, one of the dishes I ordered (morcilla, blood sausage) was still frozen in the middle (at a good restaurant this dish shouldn't have been frozen in the first place, much less served still frozen). Which I understand, it happens, but I told her it was frozen, her first response wasn't ""sorry"" but oh would you like me to heat it up? Which didn't make sense as I had already broken it up, and was just was very low quality thing to do. I told her that I simply did not want it. Later, when we got the check, I noticed that it hadn't been removed from our order. But more than this isolated event, the food was also not very flavorful, no fresh herbs in the beans, which is centrally important for flavorful Colombian food.

3301646,2017-01-26,1,qL1YorxvE_D-xoPF9f6f8w,"From the moment I woke, I knew I needed to find a good Colombian restaurant. How would I begin such a journey? As daunting of a task as it seemed, I was devoted to learning the truth,  to finding the answer to my desire. For six sleepless nights, I tossed and I turned, yearning for the delectable treat that my appetite required. I refused to sleep until I found what I was searching for. 

If it wasn't for my dearest friend Daniela, I would not be the man I am today. I mentioned my predicament and as if by fate, she produced a 2x4 inch business card revealing the potential restaurant I would try. It was called Aracely's SAZON Colombiano. My heart skipped a beat at the sound of the name. I pictured the Jeep in the photo sweeping me off my feet to take me to this promised land. I must find out for myself. It was then that my quest took its most pivotal turn.

Conclusion: I finally made my way into the gates of Aracely's. The ambiance was warm, welcoming. I almost felt a familiar comfort the instant I set foot in the store. I was home. This must be the place. Juan helped me find a seat and gave me a menu. He asked how many people would be joining me tonight. I replied ""Only Juan."" We laughed together as old friends do. We bumped fists and he went back to let me decide on a meal. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. Never in all my years have I experienced such euphoria, such exhilarating joy. Aracely's changed my life. I will not eat anywhere else. 

Epilogue: It's been 5 years now and I still am a regular at Aracely's. Juan and I became best friends and are going to backpack Panama next week. I look at my house, my kids, my wife and dog and think how none of this would have been possible without Aracely's. Please, take my advice and go there, just once. Find out what I did. Find the truth. Find your meaning.

I ended up having bandeja paisa, mondongo, and jugo de lulo. It was too much food for one person and I had leftovers, but I wanted to try multiple dishes. The portions were decent, and prices fair though I wouldn't say inexpensive. 

As for the food, it was tasty, authentic, and reminded me of my meals in Colombia. On the menu, it says that mondongo comes with rice and fried green plantains, but I was given rice and a small arepa. When I mentioned this, the waitress brought two pieces of fried green plantains (patacones), without hesitation.

The girl promptly greeted us and told us to sit wherever we wanted. She came up to our table and took our drink order. We ordered two empanadas (1 beef, 1 chicken). The empanadas were very hot and delicious. My gringa wife loved the empanadas as I did also. I ordered the Bandeja Paisa and my wife ordered the Arroz con Pollo. Food came out quickly and looked delicious. My wife loved her meal and I enjoyed mine as well. My reason for the 4 stars is that the rice on my bandeja was a bit cold and the chicharron was cold as well. But overall the place was great and would definitely come back again.",LtBd9JCA9zwCcW-19UQyTg,0,0,4,SGSeWDUoU7UEGV57wcXpxw

Price wise its costly for the kind of food u get as well as for the quality. Another bummer is being restricted on what u can get. I came on Sunday and really wanted the Arroz con Pollo but was told no as that's only on a certain day of the week (Tuesday I think). I ordered the Sancocho de Gallina and lost my appetite as soon as I saw how greasy it was. As u can see in the picture the grease creates a nice thick film on top. Once I was able to get around the grease and actually try the soup, I found it lacking in taste and found too many tiny bones in it. I also wanted the Buñuelo and was told they were out of them as well as out of the Arroz con leche. All in all a very disappointing experience. Not sure when I'll try them again.",r-y0pCsGPbWcRHfZeEzJnw,2,0,2,FxmeUQvWiC6vq6lrwzCmNA

1. Such tasty food, welcoming atmosphere, and nice service. My family had such a nice time here!... Honestly, if you want to get a taste of Colombia, and it's ethnic goodness head over to Aracely's :) 

2. ¡Que alegría! Las Vegas necesita un lugar como este. Entrar a ""Aracely's"" es como volver a Colombia por un rato (solo que mucho más barato)! Una cosa es cocinar, pero los olores, sonidos, y calor Colombiano son cosas que no se pueden replicar. Mi familia lo disfrutó mucho.",lpYEeyUrdnvF568r7bBH4w,1,0,5,VsYRJvZ7WalhvDgqm8p5rg

Overpriced and awful.  I literally tried this place because of all the great reviews.  I love Columbian food.  I hate Aracely's.

Literally Kitchen Nightmare.  It's not an issue of authenticity or flavor preference.  It's a question of quality.  
Meat, overcooked, Dry.  
Rice, Hard.
