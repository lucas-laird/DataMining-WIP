Let's remember, it's in food court so the bar isn't set too high. 

The pizza is outstanding and I consider myself a pizza aficionado. The crust is very thing with a perfect chew , great sauce and perfect cheese to topping ratio. This trip I had a slice of cheese, pep, sausage and pep, spinach and mushroom. All were perfect.

Pizza is alright. The value is definitely not here because while it was a decent pizza, it cost me almost $20 for two slices of pizza. You can bet that there were hardly any toppings on these pizzas either.

The pizza itself was very good.  I had the meat lovers and the bbq chicken pizza.  Both were flavorful, packed with toppings and the crust was really good. I generally don't like the crust but I definitely like it at Bonanno's.

The downside of this place? Each slice was close to $7.  Yes, I said it - $7! 

I proceeded to order 4 slices - haha.

I think it would have been cheaper if I just ordered a whole pizza but who has that type of logic at 4am?

It wasn't the best pizza I've had but keep in mind it's in a food court:) It was a decent slice that hit the spot when not many other places were open and was right in the casino. The garlic knots were also pretty good too. We ate here more than once on our week long stay. The staff was helpful and friendly and they worked fast to move through the line of customers. The prices were decent too. Check this place out if you're looking for a quick bite.

I told him that I was a regular and the previous salad I ordered that day was not their usual, and he wasted no time replacing it. He even seem proud to replace it for me.

I've lived in NYC for 24 years so I have pretty high standards for what I want in a slice, and the bacon slice I got here wasn't too far off the mark!  My friend and I got the bacon slice (and a side of ranch to pour all over it) and 6 garlic knots.  The slice was actually quite heavy, cheesey, and dripping in its own oils which is a must if you're claiming that the pizza is New York style.  The garlic knots were quite delicious as well!  They were pretty huge and incredibly soft.  Could have used a bit more garlic, but the texture made up for that.  I dipped these in the ranch as well even though they do come with marinara.  While the food was satisfying, the prices were a bit too high.. I paid about 16$ for that one slice and the garlic knots.

4107426,2016-05-03,9,5uk8eUTiRS_Y5p_EjnrfkQ,"I was looking for some inexpensive late night grub when we were walking between the Linq and Flamingo. Bonanno's is located in a food court inside the Flamingo. Their menu is pretty much basic, there's of course pastas, salads, stromboli, whole pizza, and pizza by the slice. 

I ordered their pepperoni and mushroom pizza. My choice was considered gourmet topping and it was $7? With that, I ordered a large Pepsi $4. When looking for a Cheese pizza slice it's $5 and a Pepperoni slice is $6. 

I was standing in line waiting to pay, I noticed there were some confusion with a customer who was trying to pay at the cash register, then the line got held up, from there it got worst. There was a guy behind us who wanted to be out quick because all he had was one order. My party and I didn't mind him wanting to go ahead us because there were some orders that had to wait to be re-heated, so he went ahead of us. Still the line wasn't moving, that same guy got really upset and left. 

I noticed when food got prepared the employees were shuffling plates around behind the counter, I guess they were trying to figure out if everything is in order. Again, that also made service get even slower. After paying 8 minutes later I didn't get an apology about the delayed wait. By the time I got to my table I took a bite of my pizza, it got cold! I was upset, I didn't want to get back in line to ask to get it warmed up. I was like ""Forget it!"". Funny, later on that same customer who left came back and noticed he can never get helped and started complaining to other people, he cursed and went else where.

I spend so much time in this review about their service it affected others as well, and the end result I got was a cold pizza. Therefore, I didn't go banana's at Bonanno's.

First off, as a local I do have to say when reading the previous reviews, they were complaining about the price and you don't get much for what it's worth, it's the STRIP! Everywhere is like that unless you go off the strip and more into the local parts of town. And they do have prices on the menu. If it's expensive, whyd you eat there? Boggles my mind. 

Anyways, I thought the slice of Broccoli & Spinach Pizza was delicious. I've never had that combo before and it was very tasty. They even toast it again after it's been sitting under the head lamp which was nice. 

The slice was big in my opinion. The price, yeah pricey, but I expect that being in a casino on the strip. Wish I brought lunch from home, but oh well.
