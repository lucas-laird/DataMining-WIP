We tried the Tostadas de Bruja and it's worth every penny. Great big portion and flavor throughout. We will definitely be back for the dine in experience.,_XqormJhIMYQu6eLM7uN7Q,0,0,4,RVdhOx8sB8DBLOQo09BhLA

Tostastas, cocteles, molcajetes and sushi. Now let me tell u about the taste.  OMG. I WAS IMPRESSED. I'm a huge sushi fan and to be honest I didn't think I was going to like it. But it was GOOOOOOD.  The tostada? bruja was really good. The coctel de camarones was okay.  We will be back. Especially when they start selling beer lol.",SlxwDe7lU37g0pcmQGZVPQ,0,0,4,pCAB9dAD26Yg7jY4cS5rHg

However after our experience today we will not be returning! The sushi had no flavor, chips and salsa were store bought, and took them forever to bring us our food. I gave them 1 star because our waitress was kind enough to speak to her manager so we wouldn't have to pay (this was the only good part of the entire experience). I do not recommend this place for sushi!",rqivzgq007VEFGg886XhvQ,1,0,1,-vaEkAG3g9qYqS5tmMfEqA
