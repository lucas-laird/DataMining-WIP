200812,2017-02-08,0,M1-aQ3XIMoAQeCUS0xQ4Mw,This bell is like 5 min from my apartment so I've accumulated some frequent flyer miles for sure. They are consistent and the food hasn't made me sick (cause let's face it sometimes you get that sketch Taco Bell batch). The drive thru tellers are usually pretty on with accuracy too.,h7_EVs_n1JYOwFRoWDiMbQ,1,0,5,jGJpTbp2brUR1O_LWDPR_g
421571,2013-07-28,0,M1-aQ3XIMoAQeCUS0xQ4Mw,I have been going here for several years. I get picky about my order. No creamy anything! And I pretty much never have to worry about them getting it right. Which is unheard of if you frequent the border often. I have complicated orders and I feel confident every time I go to this one. The workers obviously take pride in getting orders correct.

Two nights ago I got the craving for nacho fries and my oh my, they're phenomenal. They're a mix between doritos and the ground beef flavor or taco bell beef. It was a surprising bite and the fries remained warm. If you're looking for a place to enjoy nacho fries. This is the joint.",bFc9TIM5BCtLEbbUJ7ysmw,0,0,5,AZOLiisg7UFPRcPEAznbww

I ordered a Diet Pepsi and a Mexican Pizza. The soda tasted like the line or nozzle hadn't been clean in, well, EVER. And the pizza was thrown into the box with contents hanging out and getting on the bag and napkin. I was hungry so I started eating it anyway. It tasted like plastic. Seriously. I couldn't eat it.

I went from starving to no appetite in the matter of a few seconds.

It was that bad.

If this location shared their secrets to corporate, they'd make millions off of the Taco Bell Diet: ""Try our food and lose your stomach! Literally!""",Cq0XdCjGFhzWMnVx8cb4Og,0,0,1,9LaFii093T6yBpcNgCNsCQ

I could tell she was overwhelmed with the fast paced Nature but she held on and worked her job with a smile... It gets easier over time trust me :)... I had to wait a little longer for my food but it was worth the wait my food was fresh and full of ingredients... I appreciate you for loving your job and doing it with a smile even though it can get heavy at times...

Once we left, I checked my order, and of course it was wrong. I went in the front door and requested the jalapeño honey chicken grilled taco that I ordered for a second time. And the lady told the people cooking and they say ""it's on the grill right now"" to me personally. After about ten minutes of me standing and waiting for one taco, while the rest of mine and my wife's dinner got cold, a manager finally approached the counter and asked what I was waiting for. Finally she asks the cooks and they have no idea what's going on. One cook finally double checks and says ""sorry would you like this instead?"" By this point I wasn't waiting ANOTHER ten minutes for the chicken to be cooked. So I said fine. For the next 3 minutes while I waited for THAT one to be made, I got to listen to them all laugh and goof off while my order was jacked up for a half hour. Never again will I give you the benefit of the doubt, Taco Bell. Never again. 

Find a new Taco Bell if you want decent service and dinner on time.",xyKGPFT6fnmYkHCdqL4KBA,0,1,1,EjWb0NBGpjNi9oiKTqtdxw

I was planning to order on the Breakfast menu but I came just as they flipped the menu.  Breakfast is only served before 11 am and I would have been ok if only they didn't forget my order.
Stood in front of the cashier for 10 min. and proceeded to order:

----Fiesta Potatoes:  It was amazing and so worth $1.29.  I should have ordered more.

----Beefy 5 layer burrito:   Burrito was ok, not the best but satisfying.

----Deal A- Shredded Chicken Burrito with a medium drink and doritos:  My sister Ella(10) said she liked it but was disappointing that I didn't get her breakfast.

----Deal B- Double Decker Taco with a medium drink and dritos:  My other sister Johndra(13) loved it and wondered why she's never had it befor.

Cinnamon Twists and Cinnabon(4)-  where missing.

I only realized they forgot my order on the Twists and Cinnabon once I was at home but other than that, I love Taco Bell.",DkpXOwfEB7OfrEZZPmm1Ng,1,0,4,H5oHV0okqBHD2g963LauCQ
4063487,2017-01-30,9,M1-aQ3XIMoAQeCUS0xQ4Mw,"Okay, I do understand this is a fast food place, but I do believe if you serve people, you still need to be professional and treat people right. Even though I came here several times while I lived in Vegas, I'm not a fan. I've experienced much better at other locations. If it wasn't that this spot was 2 blocks from where I lived, I probably wouldn't have ever come. 

First off, this place never seems cleaned, even when I came first thing when they opened up. Tables and chairs almost always still had sticky stuff on them. Floors at times still looked as though the person that closed up the night before, didn't even bother to sweep up. 

Depending on day and time of day, you may get someone that is nice and takes your order quickly or you may get someone that just seems so irritated that you are wanting to order from them and then take forever to make your food. If you're going to base your opinion on coming here off the staff, don't even bother. Same with the drive-thru. I've had people take my order, but they were also talking with the other workers while taking my order. Not very professional. 

As far as the food is concerned, it was the typical Taco bell quality food. Little to no meat in the burritos or tacos. Sometimes the food didn't even seem warm or fresh. When I ask for extra of something, they always forgot to put it in my burritos. Needless to say, I never went back to ask for it, as it was just a hassle to get what I had. 

Most of the time the napkins were out and I had to ask for some. Same with the hot sauces. They only put out a few at a time, so every person has to go and ask for more. Need to make sure stuff like that is kept stocked.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,14,10,2,o6qO99OWuveLmi-65Q_lzQ

4875672,2017-09-23,0,M1-aQ3XIMoAQeCUS0xQ4Mw,"I love Taco Bell, but this location needs an upgrade!

Please take note that this review is based on my experience when I lived in Vegas a year ago. As far as food is concerned, it is your normal Taco Bell food. I usually get the bean and cheese burrito, Beefy 5 layer, or the cheese quesadilla. Nothing special about them, but they are a quick meal when I don't have the time to have a sit-down meal. 

My problem with this location is the staff. No one seems to know what to do here and the lady that always took orders would be taking my order and then start talking to someone else in the middle of taking my order!! She did this every single time I came into this location. Took her two or three times longer to take order just cause she'd stop and make conversation with someone else. 

Then you have the person at the drive-thru window that would also be talking to someone else while taking your order as well. Many times I'd be confused as to who they were talking to! Not only was that a problem, but it took them forever to make your food. Drive-thru always was packed with people and the line moved very slowly. 

Needless to say, I still came back time after time just cause I like Taco Bell and this location was close to me.",zudZl2wYpmZYyoklPVhV-A,0,0,2,zbZ-43ens6pQ9gnk-URIIQ

The employees are straight out of the pinta and take no pride in their work. Which is why they are working at taco bell to begin with. After getting cold stale tacos again I had enough, I actually drove back wanting something done replace refund something. That's how fkn bad their food is all the time. It is fast food this is how incompetent these people are. I go back and as the cashier (who was actually pretty good) is helping me I have three drop outs standing there laughing like its funny I had to waste my time coming back and by the way it is this idiots fault. The cashier agreed something is wrong with the shells and all I see is three snickering failures laughing. I got some  scrawny little twerp employee who trying to stare at me just begging to be bitch slapped.Hey stupid you havent accomplished shit you dont make shit and you dont own shit fkn little bitch teenager. Seriously If you are in Vegas with your family AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS.It is in a dangerous area and it is not exceptional in any way, it is below average in every sense of the word. From the bums begging for change outside to the homeless people that will walk up to your car at night while you are in the drive thru to the non working A/ C unit in the dead of summer this place is all around fkn terrible.

Drive thru was easy peasy, nice customer service and the Chalupa was still hot after I returned home.

Honestly, I've never really been a fan of Taco Bell, but that Chalupa changed my mind. I don't know if that's good or bad, because now I'll crave it! Darn it!!!!
