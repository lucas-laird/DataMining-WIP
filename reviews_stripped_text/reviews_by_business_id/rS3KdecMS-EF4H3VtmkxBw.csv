It's located in a shopping plaza and the inside was surprisingly really spacious. There's carry-out or diners can choose to order restaurant style and sit at a booth or table. It's really more of a casual restaurant. I ordered a white pizza for the family and it was huge! Best of all, it was super cheesy and creamy. I've never described pizza as creamy, but the ricotta on the white pizza was just spectacular. There was plenty of spices and the crust was my favorite part. Nobody could stop eating this pizza!

 Angelina also offers appetizers, pastas, sandwiches, and etc. They have an online website with special deals if you want to check that out.",Y55SXa5jxkT-O6wdafenHg,1,0,4,y1IwTXUVTSJr9boIYGwl9w

Honey dipped fried chicken dinner: did not come with corn bread and the 4 pieces were tiny, about the size of wings 

8 hot wings: very dry from being overdone and did not come with the side of fries. 

Zeppolis: came with a lot which was the only positive note of the whole order. Otherwise these were hard because they were over done.",3EML6T_Bb9lMv25nWRCI-g,3,0,2,pWVbb9NjyT8hv39HJlCfPQ

This was when it was on the other side of town.  I have had it few times after from the new Charleston location and that is where the love ended.

The very last time I ever ordered from them was this summer.  The dough has changed, the taste has changed, the amount of toppings has changed, and worst of all the attitude of those who answer the phone is awful.  You hardly get a second to agree before you are placed on hold by someone who sounds like they would rather be anywhere else.

I don't know happened.  Change in management?  Cheaper ingredients?  Unhappy staff?  Whatever it is change it because the food and ultimately the customer suffers.  Sadly you will not see another dime of my money or time.  There are too many pizza joints in Vegas to not stay top notch against the competition.",eIuITpqIeMcLgMxo3KPZng,0,0,1,swBRlUW2GT7kBp_CHJh8DA

I kept hoping additional bites may taste better the more I get towards the middle. I've had better and dessert was a disappointment. The Greek pizza was good however I didn't think I'd have a layer of olive oil under the entire pizza. The onion rings were ok they were greasy and not as crispy but that may have been from the drive time?

Coming from an Italian family on the East Coast, I have high standards when it comes to Italian staples. While it does seem like there is something missing (more black pepper? Oregano? not sure), the Pasta Fagiole was incredible otherwise. Perhaps it was the creaming was of the broth that reminded me of Manhattan Clam Chowder (also love.)

The Caprese salad was large and well, was more of a salad-salad than what I was expecting. Usually, a Caprese salad is a slice of mozzarella, a thick slice of tomato (no seeds), and a basil leaf. I didn't want an Italian style garden salad but that's what I got. Probably won't order this again.",y9vss4aVUULf6Zc86MCbvw,0,0,3,FbPM90nqrxTFJbj1WwTceA

I've been there and wanted to give them 5 stars and then felt the complete opposite on other visits. The service is usually decent, good if you get the cute Russian chick with the accent- she's always on point.  I've had better experiences with their dine in over their delivery. And as many have said, it's true, the pizza is just so-so. 
A couple of my choice options are as followed: The Diablo pasta. With or without added chicken or sausage this dish is by far my favorite. It's linguini with a spicy red sauce with chunks of all types of onions and peppers. It's not for the people who order mild wings. This dish (if done right) usually has me sweating and downing the nearest liquid. Now I say if done right because again I must stress the inconstancy. I've had it unbearable hot, and then I've had it where I'm wondering if I ordered the right dish. 
Another plus on this menu is the salads. I enjoy them. Greek or buffalo chicken to be exact. Good dressings and ingredients. My last fav is the cheese fries add jalapeño. This channels my inner fat kid and I find myself getting full sometimes after I realized I ate an entire order before a meal. 
I'd pass on their Alfredo, it's not bad just I've had and made better. Also I prefer their hot subs over the cold. As much as I want to be mad at this place when they screw up, I continuously find myself coming back. Again, and again.

Their ingredients are always fresh (you can tell!) and that's something you just can't get from Little Caesars or Pizza Hut.
On the East side at least, this is the best place to go for pizza. I can't speak for eating in, but every time we've ordered food or picked up from this location, our order was hot and ready to go! We order out usually about once a week (pizza is a staple for my family when my dad goes on business trips) and the food has always made it to our home within the 45 minute-1 hour window given by the restaurant. Our usual go-to is two orders of garlic balls (FYI those things are sinfully delicious) and a large vegetarian pizza with pineapple, basil, onions, spinach and jalapeños. We almost always have food left over, so whatever we've got left we just throw in the freezer- everything freezes extremely well and is just as delicious later as it is the first time around. We will continue to frequent this location so long as it continues to live up to the amazing standard it has set for the last three years. You guys have some pretty loyal customers on your hands! :)


Update: The cannoli's are absolutely delicious! You can definitely tell that they're homemade. I'd highly recommend them for anyone who likes desserts. They are best when picked up though- if they're delivered, normally the inside is a little runny because they've been near heat for too long.

I've been here about 6 times. Mostly take out and one dine in occasion.

I've never had one of those experiences where I notice someone order AFTER me and still get their food first. Until here! 

I remember that occasion. We ordered a pizza, and two appetizers. Our pizza came out literally 45 minutes after ordering it, they bring the one appetizer another 5 minutes later, and then the second appetizer just about the hour mark. One of those that's it I'm leaving moments but I stuck it out. We were in there when there were maybe 2 other small parties were there so I just didn't understand. They had a lot of workers but we maybe got one refill when we asked after we ate. 

There was never a ""sorry out kitchens baked up"" or even a just plain ""sorry it's taking so long"". That tells me they don't see a problem.

How hard is it to fry up some garlic balls to bring out as an appetizer? How about wings? That should have come out first to freaking offset the pizza wait! Restaurant and service 101!

Our entire meal took almost an hour and a half. 

Granted the take out line started getting busy we still ordered way before it got busy.

Then tonight I went and took a take out order and our crust was burnt on our pizza. 

Sorry but that was the last straw. I just can't see myself eating here again.

Yes their garlic balls are good and cheap but I'll go elsewhere at all costs. 

Their ordering sucks. You call and automatically get placed on hold. WHY?! I was in there and both girls did that. WHY?! They weren't even doing anything that couldn't wait!

Also the staff sucks.

Customer service and personality go along way. I don't see how that girl works there. She must be related or own the place. Dark hairs girl that is a little pale. Sorry to put her out there but she just sucks. One time she gave me a free ranch with my order but I left a tip larger than the cost of the ranch so that doesn't make up for it. 

There's no appreciation of the customer. I'd rather eat where they have good service and good food as opposed to bad service and great food. 

They don't give a good name to local businesses and I'd much rather eat at a big corporate chain as opposed to this place.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,8,3,1,Dx3Y8x62Bb8bYAPqHIv5sg

I've had their sandwiches a couple of times too.  Pretty good.  I've had better.  They are filling though.  What I love most is the build your own stromboli.  You get your choice of three toppings.  I always order the small and it is enough for at least two meals.  It comes out buttery and garlic-y with parmasean cheese dusting the top.  You get a cup of sauce for dipping.  It is good sauce but never quite enough.  I like to order the 'boli with spinach, mushroom and artichoke.  Or sometimes pepperoni, olive and mushroom.  Really any three toppings you want are a good choice.  An amazing stromboli.

I have never ordered for delivery so I cannot speak of the complaints of taking too long.  I can tell you it does take usually 20-30 minutes when you order in house.  It is worth the wait though.

Even though I knew the food started to taste pretty bad I kept going back here and there thinking it was just a fluke. Well, big mistake on my part because I do not enjoy heart burn or feeling sick immediately after eating. 
My last and final experience I decided to order a pepperoni, sausage, and extra cheese pizza for take out. They told me it would take an hour so I took my time driving assuming the place would be packed. When I got inside it was empty and the lady at the counter never acknowledged me but instead kept talking on the phone until I finally said something. I'm pretty sure that pissed her off because she abruptly ended her phone call and practically shot laser beams at me with her eyes lol...
I gave her my name and paid and she went back to get it. She didn't come back out for another 5min maybe longer. Finally got my food and headed home. I really wished I would have opened the pizza box before I left because I would have given it back. First off, I had grease that seeped from the pizza thru the box and got all over my car seat. Not happy about that! And then when I checked the pizza it was hardly cooked and you could still pull the dough apart. What gets me was all the grease...it was covered in pools of dripping nasty grease. Where the hell did all that come from? Threw it away and didn't even bother trying to call for another one or to get my money back because I didn't really want to deal with the lady again. 
I really hope the owners read some of these reviews. It used to be a delicious place to eat but after my last experience I will not be back nor recommend it.",jgaEUrQtOnLwbm05zyoA0w,4,2,1,78RRvSRVomYc9bV98AOqsw

The small stromboli could have fed 3 or 4 people, so it lasted for 3 meals for me, and it was way yummy with the pizza sauce to dip it in.

If the staff make a mistake (and it happens from time to time) they tend to get surly rather than just fix the problem.

I've had their pizza a few times, and each time I've been happy with it. It's not great pizza, but it's not bad either. There aren't very many good pizza places nearby, and this is one of the few places that stays open late.

They have a very good Philly cheesesteak, probably the best in the area. My wife gets this every time we are here and has always  loved it. It's always juicy, well seasoned and cheesy. It seems like a lot of places have trouble making a good Philly but Angelina's is not one of them. Their ranch jalapeño burger is also fantastic, and is the best burger I've ever had from a pizza place.

Their fries are seasoned and very good. They also have very good garlic dough balls which are greasy in that good way. You know they are bad for you but can't stop eating them.

I've never had them deliver so I can't comment on that. I usually order to go and wait at the Putters bar next door. I typically wait about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad. Their prices are also pretty average.

If your in the area and want a good sandwich or burger, or maybe it's late at night and you want pizza, then stop by here and you shouldn't be disappointed.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,0,0,4,5YGfN9LAIF_eFT74rDAaKQ

Let me start off with the cheese fries because I ate those first. The fries are excellent, they give off a real taste of a potato unlike other restaurants. The seasonings are all there and the cheese was a good addition. One thing to know is that the cheese can get solid fast and it's a little thick but overall the cheese fries are great.

Now the personal pizza is good and I liked the flavors made present especially the crust. The crust is crispy and the toppings were delicious but I do have to say that the pizza needed more sauce. No doubt the pizza was juicy and had a crisp bite but the sauce needs improving. For a pizza that size needs to be at par with the regular sizes of their pizza.

Angelina's isn't to far from my place, and it's located in a decent strip mall, where an Albertson's resides.  So, I would usually place an order, hit up Albertson's for sides and drinks, then grab my grub from Angelina's.  Very convenient!!!  But, something happened and I stopped coming here for a while.

I usually go for a Double Bacon Cheeseburger with a side of fries.  Filling and tasty.  So, I decided to come back and order one.  Here is my experience from this trip:

I call in my order for my Double Bacon Cheeseburger and make the trek out to Angelina's.  

*Side Note: The trip would be faster if they would open a road that goes between Vegas Valley and Sahara.  It would take a few miles off of my trip.

Anyhow, I get to Angelina's and get to the counter and pay for my order.  They told me that it would be a couple of minutes before it was ready.  No problem, I don't mind waiting.  A few minutes go by and up comes my order.  They put it in a plastic bag filled with napkins and ketchup packets.  Nice!!!

I get home and get ready to chow down on my burger.  I look and what is this... they forgot my bacon.  What???? I have a total love affair with bacon.  I mean, I order a side of bacon with my bacon.  I'm a little disappointed but, I'll get by - barely.  The burger is seasoned nicely, the tomatoes were fresh and the lettuce was crispy.  I also like the toasted bun.  A nice touch.  I could have used a little more fries but, whatever.  So, I say, decent job but took off a couple of stars for forgetting my bacon.  But, I'll be back!!!

Frankly, I'm not sure where to start. I order delivery from them fairly often, and usually order the same thing for myself, The Philly Cheesesteak with fries. It's usually sub-par at best but I sacrifice quality for convenience. Burnt meat, soggy flavorless fries, missing ingredients was the norm. Never again. Recently it's gone way below sub-par to disgusting. A handful of times now my fries have tasted like dish water and my meat had a sandy sort of grit to it. Still I never wrote any reviews and stopped bringing it back, because I'm of the admittedly pessimistic opinion that reporting dissatisfaction to this restaurant does absolutely nothing to improve things, as has been shown in the past when the few times I did call or go to Angelinas, to inform them they forgot parts of my order, I was met with horrible attitudes and just felt extremely uncomfortable, like I was somehow in the wrong. 

Why did I continue to order their food? Because it's convenient and they used to be great and I guess I just wanted to give them a chance(or numerous chances) to get their stuff together. Also, I'm an idiot apparently.

Another point I'd like to add: if you eat in, the food is significantly better. Doesn't taste off and doesn't show signs of the staff just not giving a damn, probably because you're right there to complain about it. This tells me it's not a question of someone just being a bad cook, but that they take advantage of being able to skimp and screw over take out orders because people(like myself) usually won't take the trip to bring it back in lieu of just putting up with bad food or throwing it away. That's just my take on that, though.

I'm gonna wrap this up with a summary of today's order. Gritty meat, dishwater fries, and after a few bites felt a giant hard chunk that squeaked when I bit into it, similar to glass or hard plastic. I instantly felt nauseous and my stomach contracted, and I had to run to the toilet where I vomited so forcefully, there were traces of blood in it(excuse the gory details). I'm irate at this point. Not sure if I will go up there later to personally speak with a manager as that may be irrelevant at this point; I will never ever order food from there again so there won't be much they could do to repair the situation. Very sad to say Angelinas is permanently removed from my list of regular eating spots. They used to be fantastic.",8dT2vOTzNoW-uI0U53jwNA,4,0,1,aXtHp1hJc8fTDNsy05VSrg
