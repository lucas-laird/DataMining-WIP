The first time my wife took me here the waiter / bartender took probably 20 minutes of his time to go over all of the different sauces with us explain the benefits of each one as it compares to chicken or pork and let us taste a number of them before we decided which sauce we wanted to put on our food. He also gave us his personal recommendations about mixing a couple of the sauces together. He was extremely friendly and very professional. This first visit is one of the reasons that Wingnutz has become one of my favorite places to eat up here in the North Area. I have and will continue to recommend them to friends and family.",u0pTztUvCOUIpDop7cHT7Q,0,0,5,z1oOe8hZ6IBc141VW-s7Og

The food was not good, it took almost 30 minutes to get (only three tables had guests) food and when we got it they did not bring out our entire order. Our buffalo chips (frys) came almost 15 minutes before the wings. The wings had very little sauce and were extremely dry.

1103012,2015-03-24,0,w_Cw1-80276SAhHw2LJqFQ,"We were looking for a new wing spot close to the Centennial area. We checked out the reviews on yelp and the yelp community gave this new restaurant four stars. 

We had high hopes for this restaurant but it epically failed. 

When you are wanting and craving wings,  you are expecting deep fried and crunchy smothered with tons of yummy sauce. This restaurant does not have any deep fryers in it at all. EVERYTHING IS BAKED! 

When you cook everything in an oven, sometimes food drips off the pan and winds up on the bottom of the oven. This causes the drippings to burn and creates a lot of burnt smoke in the oven... just like if you were cooking at home. 

So... basically almost everything tasted burnt! 

We were the only ones there and it took 45 minutes for our food. I ordered the regular french fries/chips and the grilled southwest chicken wrap. My boyfriend ordered the regular boneless wings and the pork wings.

Honestly my wrap was really good. The wings lacked flavor and didn't have that nice crunch to it that wings that are deep fried have. All of our french fries had that burnt taste smell and the server even brought us new ones... but nothing changed. 

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",n2HyyuQ18NnsB2slsxt37Q,6,2,2,BEcv0_qbSp2gDAxi33UAnw

1424150,2015-10-25,1,w_Cw1-80276SAhHw2LJqFQ,"""A"" for effort. Not impressed with the food. They tried...honestly some foods are just meant to be unhealthy. They don't fry anything which is fine...I wouldn't expect the same texture knowing this but none of their chicken in breaded just FYI. 

I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and normally this would come breaded anywhere else. I thought it would come breaded too...just baked. Well, the sandwich was okay. Didn't taste like buffalo sauce at all. I'm assuming because it's not breaded that it's hard to hold the flavor of the sauce. It also came with marinated tomatoes on top which were gross. 

My husband ordered the boneless wings which typically are breaded too. He said the sauces were good but the chicken was dry and also the chicken doesn't hang on to the flavor of the sauces because they aren't breaded. 

The buffalo chips were burned. The children's quesadilla pitiful and also tasted burnt probably because it was all baked together and burned together. 

The water wasn't even good. It tasted like straight from a well and not in a good way. 

The only reason we gave it 3 stars is because the service was good and friendly and there isn't a bad seat in there if you came to watch a game.

I think I've tried all of their regular menu sauces and my favorite is the Southern Lemon Hotties. Their spicy buffalo chips are a must have with your lunch and dinner. Also, if you're in a mood for something lighter and healthier than wings, they have some good salads.

I'm not a beer drinker, but everyone I go with to this place loves the Ghost Rider beer. So I recommend that one!

I go here a few times a month. They have music bingo on Friday nights (8pm) and trivia on Wed nights. I haven't tried the trivia night, but I have tried the music bingo twice. It was so much fun, and they gave out decent prizes (free beer and beer glasses). I also enjoy going here to watch football and other sports.

A young waitress came over and began service. Soon we discovered that they were out of the boneless pork wings, the featured beer and several other draft beers.. my primary reason for going there. The remaining draft selection wasn't what we were looking for.

We also ordered a large chips appetizer and got a small. The wine served was vinegarry (new word) and had clearly not been stored properly. The bone-in pork wings were well prepared nonetheless but tell me again why I am paying $22 for 10 pork wings when a full rack of pork ribs is less than $20 most places???

The first time we came and tried the chicken nachos, they were amazing, lots of sauce and toppings. The second time, they were gross, dry and pretty much just a bunch of chips with nothing on them. The wings were great, had no complaints about them.  The biggest thing that got me though, was the management. They have signs on every table advertising to download their app on your phone, so I did. On their app, they gave a coupon section with a 10% off coupon, all you have to do is scam a qr code! So when our waitress came back, I asked what qr code I needed to scan and she went on to tell me that it should have been on the flyer advertising the app, but their location hadn't received those papers yet. She continued to tell me that her manager was the lady sitting over there at the end of the bar and that she would go ask if she would be able to give the discount. Needless to say, when she came back, the manager said that they would be unable to take the coupon. Why would you advertise for something you won't even accept!? We had signed up for your loyalty program, downloaded the app, and had planned on making this our new place to go for wings, yet you're willing to lose customers over poor customer service and not giving a tiny discount.

1971593,2015-10-28,0,w_Cw1-80276SAhHw2LJqFQ,"This is my first time writing a review on Yelp. But I couldn't choose a better place to rant and rave about for my first review. To start off, this isn't my first visit, and I have meant to post on here before, but leaving always having such a great experience I keep forgetting! 

The first thing on my list is customer service. Coming from the industry myself, this either makes or breaks whether or not I will return. My first trip was about four months ago, and walking in was pleasantly surprised by the large bar, outside seating and two large tv's for FOOTBALL!!! Kevin was the first bartender that helped me. Not only was he able to make a friend and I laugh the whole time, but he also handled all other guests as well. I was impressed. The second trip was with Lindsy, and she was equally impressive! Both Lindsy (correct spelling btw)  and Kevin remember my group and my names and drinks and past orders. This is awesome! If I forget the combo of sauces they remember for me. No they don't have to ask if I want ranch or blue cheese, they know I want the blue cheese!!! They also have a great bartender/cook/server...he does it all, John. He is wonderful every time as well. All three of the lovely people do it all as well. 

Now for the food. Not if the service wasn't great enough, the food just tops off the whole experience! First of all, I am working of changing out my diet and eating healthier. This is not the first reason I came in here. A friend said it was great and I tagged along. But they bake all of their wings, they do not use any fry oil. Which is awesome. Anyways, the food, first time I came in I got the oink and cluck, which is a mix of wings, pork shanks and your choice of side. I'm not going to lie, I have had the same thing of just wings every time because they are so good! My friends have eaten the burgers or wraps and I've had a bite and it's always awesome. The buffalo chips are hand cut potatoes, in either spicy buffalo or plain and I get a mix of both. Kevin helped me with my first order of picking sauces. The sauce options are endless and they are all made on location. I have had all different kinds of sauces, but my favorites now are lemon hotties on the wings and a mix of jalapeño honey bbq and raspberry chipotle, they call it Halle Berry.  

I could go on about this place for days, but all I can say is...try this place out. If you like wings and great craft beer choices, liquor, amazing food and service you will be happy! I know I was, and am!

I was greeted promptly by the server that eventually took my order, however I did have to wait a while for my order to actually be taken ! Though they weren't very busy, it was some time before my single order to go was brought out ! 
  I briefly spoke to a gentleman that appeared to be working there. (I later found out he was the manager's husband) He was very short with his responses to my questions almost as if I was bothering him ! 
   Though the majority of the reviews I had read indicated the food was remarkable, on my visit this was not the case ! I ordered the ""oink & cluck"" dinner. This dinner was comprised of 5 wing ""sections"", 2 hog shanks, (obviously from a very small hogs) and a portion of ""buffalo chips"" ! 
   I proceeded home (5 minutes away) and immediately sat down to enjoy my first dinner at Wing Nutz ! The dinner was cold ! The wings at maybe room temperature and the small portions of hog shank slightly warmer ! The buffalo chips were cold and obviously cooked at separate times with half being slightly burnt and dried out and the other half only cooked half way and limp !! 
   At Wing Nutz they charge a whopping $1.00 per wing ""section"" ala carte !!! That is higher than anywhere I have experienced in the country ! The plate I ordered above was $12.87 with the tax !!

Despite what you may think about baked wings, the food here was delicious. 
We decided to have the WingNutz sampler, which consisted of 6 bone-in wings, 6 boneless, 4 hog wings, and a double order of their chips. 
The baked chips were delicious. Crispy on the outside, yet still soft on the inside. With great seasoning.

For me, the wings were good. Not spectacular blow the competition away good, but they were good. What was super delicious though was the hog wings. They were so good.

Our service was great, but then there were only 4 other tables, so I'd have to wait to pass judgment on that until I can see how they are at a busier time.

One of favorites is the Double Hop IPA super potent and can contain +9% alcohol content for one beer.  Its like drinking to Budwiser at once.  POW! Lets get the night started.  

They also have a point system that you can earn if you enroll in the text loyalty program.  After 1000 points you get your own personal mug for future visits.  Lets see if we can earn a mug tonight. Who wants to go. I got the first round!

We got an appetizer to start they advertise fresh everything so what better way to test this theory then the southwest chips and salsa loaded with fresh veggies. I must say it was great had just enough kick and boy was it fresh yum yum!!! Beside the hot wings which we obviously got we also wanted to try the hog wings (pork shanks). We got them in the southern honey BBQ sauce. The meat was cooked to perfection, juicy and tender. For the wings I got bone in the two flavors I chose were southern hottie's and Jamaican Jerk. The jerk was like a typically jerk except not as sweet as your average buffalo wild wings sauce. Alo the southern hotties sauce was a traditional franks hot sauce but with more flavor and tasted peppery. The chicken was delicious, again for bake I was surprised at how juicy it was. Also the chicken wings were a decent size. The only change I would make would be extra sauce; even just on the side as there's was a tad thin.

We used to frequent WingNutz on a pretty much weekly basis but have fallen off. Last night we decided to give them a try again. I ordered the chicken nachos, just like in my last review. Our server came back and mentioned that I could get the cheese nachos from the happy hour menu for cheaper, and I said no because I wanted all the toppings. But this time, there was no chicken on my nachos. I ate them anyway because I was starving and our sever didn't come back. My drink ran empty and our server never came to offer us refills. In fact we didn't see her again until she brought the bill. The service has definitely gone down hill, and I remembered why we haven't been back. The restaurant wasn't busy at all so there wasn't an excuse as to why our table would have been neglected. Another thing is that they have a rewards system and you are supposed to put your phone number on the receipt. We have done this every time, and like I said we used to come here weekly. We never seemed to gather any rewards for all the times we visited. Last night my husband even said that he wasn't going to bother putting his number on it because we never got rewards.

So, all in all, the wings were the BOMB, sauces were the BOMB, blue cheese was creamy and delish. Only issue: we got like 15 chips (counted) with the salsa. Huge bummer, I must admit. But, other than that, we had an awesome, awesome, spontaneous and late night treat. Thank you Wing Nutz!! :)",-SWRw9-1ARVKLAWE0Sxw1Q,0,1,5,yoH_gTvdT8XLJgTsTa_5KQ

As an out of towner I came in for lunch and was greeted instantly.  The bar had lots of flat screens and cleverly decorated.  I choose to sit at the bar and was able to get some tips from the bar tender.  

I ended up getting sharing the sampler with traditional legendary wings, southern lemon hottie boneless wings, jalepeño honey bbq hog wings (pork), and a side of buffalo chips.  Everything absolutely awesome.  I love the variety of sauces.  The wings were cooked to perfection - baked wings so the wings aren't fried and greasy.  And the hogs wings were absolutely surprisingly delicious.  The buffalo chips had a tasty seasoning with a kick to it.  I washed it down with their signature Nut Job Beer, Over the Moon White Belgium.  It is great if you are looking for something light and smooth but tasty to wash down the spice.

This place as way more variety and flavor than you average/common wing spot.  If you are looking for fattening deep fried, greasy wings, this place isn't for you.  If you are looking for delicious wings to tickle and spice your taste buds and a great atmosphere to have a meal, give this place a try.",hKg2RKN2P0hnaH5Gd9tQ_A,0,0,5,oG25vdEa2gVY6LDxCNGfLw

I ordered a family meal for three, we only get two (tiny) ranches and they want to charge us for another. I can name 50 chicken wing resturaunts  that are cheaper and better, (my kids said the Costco frozen ones were better). In addition they barely put any sauce in the wings. Almost as if they are already pinching pennies to stay open. What a waste of $50. ( for a total of 25 wings and 1lb of potato fries).

We ordered one of their sampler platters that gave us 2 different choices of wings (1 sauce for the bone in and 1 sauce choice for the boneless), 'hog wings' and buffalo chips.

The server was very patient with us as this was our first time there. Definitely appreciate that. He was a cool guy who kept my beers coming and her water cup filled. 

The food was very good. These aren't your average fried wings. They're baked so the flavor of the sauce reslly sticks to the wing.

My traditional wings were very good but can't say I cared for my girlfriend's lemon pepper boneless wings. The flavor on those was very overpowering. 

Buffalo chips were delicious and the pork shanks aka hog wings tasted like yummy pork belly.

Came here on a Tuesday afternoon, visiting Vegas from out of town, and ordered 12 wings (Jamaican jerk and raspberry chipotle) , mixed chips, and chips and salsa.

Wings - very good. Raspberry chipotle was nice and our favorites. Jamaican jerk could have used more kick.

Chips - nice crunch, soft on the inside like a fry. Never had anything like it before

Chips and salads - good, salsa was nice but kind of skimpy on the chips ($1.50 for a refill? Yeah right!)

Customer service - waiter was prompt and nice.

The good:
Service was quick 
Food was good
Huge flat screen TVs 

The not so good:
Buffalo chips (sort of fries, sort of not) were all burnt.
Menu choices were pretty lackluster
No condiments on the table- no salt, pepper, ketchup, nothing. 
Wings didn't appear to be tossed in the dressing, so the dressing was just poured over the top of them.

The buffalo chicken wrap that I got was really good, but the side of chips were burnt, so I'd probably go here again but get a different side next time. My husband was not impressed with his boneless wings and his chips initially had no seasoning on them at all, so since there was nothing on the table to put on them, he had to wait for them to come back to us, take it to the back, and bring it back to the table.

They brought us the fries and then came back 15 minutes later and asked how it was going.. uh still waiting for wings ?. 


We will probably give them another try, but if the service is the same, not worth our time.

Editing to add, I just saw posted pictures of the ""buffalo chips"" ours must have been seriously underdone. They were completely white heh.",0w8g19qidryKHoYTcb0tFw,0,0,3,adpjxtgEzMpqvbK9Fstwrg

5278262,2015-03-16,2,w_Cw1-80276SAhHw2LJqFQ,"Disclaimer: I'm a vegetarian reviewing a wings restaurant, so you might want to keep that in mind. My wing eating husband wanted to give this place 4 stars, but I told him he can write his own review. 

We came in on a Tuesday night because we were in the mood for something new. WingNutz just opened and is ""Hot & New"". Why not?

SUPREME QUESADILLAS ($6.99): Not impressed. Lacking a sufficient amount of cheese and does not come with sour cream. Huh? A side of sour cream costs $1. The quesadillas, weirdly enough, also came with pico de gallo INSIDE. I'm not used to that. 2/5

BUFFALO CHIPS ($2.99): I got mine spicy. These were just okay. Wish they were warmer. 3/5

8 WINGS ($8.99): Husband got 4 bone-in with Chili Garlic sauce and 4 boneless wings with Raspberry Chipotle. The boneless with the raspberry sauce were the favored wings. 4/5

VIBE: The restaurant was pretty crowded for a Tuesday night. I liked the openness of the place and the fact that they had outdoor dining seating. Music was perfect for that type of establishment, which was a mix of Top 40, Alternative, and EDM. Lots of large TV screens, making for an awesome game viewing hangout. 4/5

SERVICE: Average 3/5 

Worth a return visit?
Yes, but I'll get the nachos next time. WingNutz isn't a replacement to BWW's (which has better vegetarian options), but a welcome addition.

The service was poor. Our food came out about 20 minutes - really? For chicken wings, carrots and celery???

We tried the mango, garlic chili and chipotle lime wings. We also got half regular chips and half buffalo chips. Nothing was spectacular. We saw the 4-star review and there was nothing 4-star about the food/service/ambiance. There was too much sauce so the chicken wings were soggy. The sauces the wings were drenched with were sweet.

5517528,2015-11-13,0,w_Cw1-80276SAhHw2LJqFQ,"Hubby and I come here later in the night whenever family is in town. Love the lighting and the patio seating ambiance. I also love that it is quiet. Something I cherish when raising an 8, 6, 2, and 6month old BOYS. Enough about those gremlins, let's talk about the chicken...

They really aren't all that bad. Each time we have gone our chicken has come out super fresh. The flavor options are great as well. I mean, you're getting chicken wings that aren't deep fried. They bake them. So if you're a little on the healthy but not so healthy conscience side...you've found your place.

The only turn off I have (hence the 3 stars) is please explain whhhyyyyyyyy is the service frickin slow? The food coming out...not so great. But because husband and I have come here for quick late night dates...it didn't bother us. I used to think it was because we come later in the night as the reason for the delay, but we have come during the day with the whole fam and a few others...same thing. It has gotten to the point where you look to check other folks' face to discover they're all thinking the same thing you are, ""where the hell is our food at"". The waitresses we have had when we have arrived earlier in the day sucked at simply touching base about our order. Almost like they are avoiding you because they already know your stomach is probably growling. Also, our buffalo chips have been brought to us more on the burnt tasting side. 

However, it is a place worth the shot especially if you're in the vicinity and are in the mood for chicken. But, be prepared to wait. It has been about 7 months since we have last gone...maybe times have changed?

Definitely kid and stroller friendly.",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,2,0,3,YqjoENCD4hzAcnWkjRCTnw

5578175,2015-03-15,0,w_Cw1-80276SAhHw2LJqFQ,"Service: 5; Had 3 separate individuals warmly greet us and let us know to sit where ever. Was promptly asked about drinks and then checked on by another waiter to ensure we had been taken care of. Wasn't over burdened by being waited on too much (i.e. you know when they visit and you literally have a wing sticking outta your mouth...), and wasn't forgotten about either (empty glass for the entire meal :/). Service was perfect.

Food: 5; Hands down the best wings I've had in Vegas. My new favorite is the Parmesan Curry (Purgatory-level). I also had the traditional (hot) and those were your standard traditional flavored wings. The fact you can select from a large host of flavors and then adjust the heat to what you can handle was nice. We sat outdoors and enjoyed the environment and all. There were one or two gnats but that's to be expected...outdoors...

Cleanliness: 4; The restaurant was clean, the bathroom could've used a little attention but I have a feeling the kids who visited it 100 times were at fault. Tables were cleaned quickly and patrons serviced as fast as we were. 

This place has earned my continued patronage; it being close to home, friendly staff, and absolutely delicious has made it the new family favorite. I'm looking forward to enjoying the list of flavors available...oh and according to some of the other reviews their beer is pretty good. No disagreements there. I came for the wings however, and did not leave disappointed.",u2XLb8EaCfqLZZXl2z2vog,1,0,5,TSswTzN4w4ZFj9jFEtik-Q

Food: 4 stars - We choose take out, ordered 12 wings traditional, 10 pork shanks, chips & Salsa, and Spicy chips. All the food was great, everything was individually packaged and labeled nicely. For Takeout they didn't not provide utensils, or napkins so that was a let down.

Cleanliness & Atmosphere: 2 stars - The place had large TV's throughout, and had me questioning whether they wanted to be a sports bar that had wings or a good restaurant. The place was well taken care of and looked brand new. My only other concern was the owners:managers had Yorkishire Terriers at the bar laying down, with their paperworks and computers splayed about... this can't be sanitary. Not to mention they didn't wash their hands one time while helping package or prepare food while going back and forth to their office duties.",nVNG_EGrrES_KaZx3USxZg,3,1,3,F9S__oLUHZ4ZqqahCs1x8A

For me, this place produces better wings than most outlets that fry their wings. Initially when the place opened, it was hit or miss. That does happen with new businesses. I go about once every two weeks, and I must say that the place has really hit it's stride. They have music bingo on selected nights, which really adds to the atmosphere, and it's kid friendly.
