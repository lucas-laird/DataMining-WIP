The order was filled relatively quickly and the food was hot and fresh. Nothing to wax philosophical about but all in all it was a decent visit. Status quo as far as a drive thru goes.,18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,1,2,3,0ThGq5MaqbwfvUB90LnhBw

What I especially like about this burger provider is the fact that the menu regularly changes throughout the year - year after year. 

Their television commercials have become somewhat less outlandish than they used to be, but are still quite enjoyable.

Unlike Burger King or McDonald's with their ever-present and no longer very innovative Whoppers and Big Macs, Carl's never stops  introducing a new burger with a twist of one sort or another. The current novelty at the time of this review is the Memphis barbecue burger and the one that I stopped by to try.

Carl's also regularly has two-for-one coupons and other money saving offers available to one and all in the advertising inserts that accompany the Las Vegas Review-Journal. You  can even sign up online to get their email offers. 

Burger King issues coupons at a lesser frequency, McDonald's hardly has coupons at all anymore and I can't remember when Wendy's last had any coupons available - pretty much never. It must be against Wendy's policy to do so.

In any case if you need a quick burger or chicken sandwich fix, Carl's definitely will not disappoint while simultaneously keeping that coupon clipper inside you quite content as you save a few bucks.",1aJni3g7tN1ikyCxIHnmtg,0,0,5,_UqKasSKgaqlzlLcxCBAYg

We were pretty excited to try this sandwich. Well, it looked nothing like the photo...no surprise since it is fast food, nor was it very good 

This sandwich has lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. This sandwich was drowning in sauce. It was a huge, gloppy mess. Between that and the lettuce and tomato, there was not much flavor at all. No fish sandwich taste at all. Finally, I just ate the fish filet by itself. It was actually decent. Not sure that I would get this again, but if I did I would request this without lettuce, tomato, as well as ask for less sauce. Oh, and maybe add cheese.",bnk8hI3N5tprKm_lMK4I-w,1,1,2,cpMyBSRzQDXKbwXatZ45sQ
