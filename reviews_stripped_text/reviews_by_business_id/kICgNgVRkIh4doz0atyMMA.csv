We then had the spicy prawn, black truffle duck and Asian greens with ginger. The flavour in each dish was just amazing. The banana peanut dessert was the perfect ending to the delicious meal.

7042,2013-08-24,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Boyfriend and I wanted something special, so when we saw that Hakkasan was located in the hotel we were staying at, we decided to try it out. Based on reviews, we tried their famous Duck salad with pomegranate, pine nuts, and sprouts The braised duck was super tender, but overly salty because of the sauce, but the pomegranate and pine nuts was a nice touch to the salad. The next option was the deep fried scallops with chili mango sauce which ended up being the only star dish of the night. You get a slight crispy outside with perfectly cooked scallops and the sauce was sweet and spicy. Boyfriend ordered the signature Hakkasan cocktail and that ended up being very delicious, so I would recommend it. Third dish was the pea sprouts and crab sauce which was very bland and didn't live up to it's hype. The crab sauce lacked flavor, so imagine a bland sauce on top of bland vegetables, it wasn't worth the price. The 4th dish received mixed reviews, we loved the tender and juicy fillet tenderloin, but we weren't impressed with how extremely salty it was. Supposedly their intent was to create an edible fried funnel cake like garnish under the tenderloin, but the batter was bland, hard, and inedible. When we told our server, he didn't even do anything about it or apologize! For the price we were paying, I expected better quality and service. To us, these dishes are described in an exotic way; however, if you really think about it, these are just typical Asian dishes that you can make at home. Overall, we were very disappointed with our food adventure and will only return for the scallops and drinks.",6DglCjROPLec4a883IjOrw,0,0,3,Lc08mjC1ZG8ixADkJfVSRQ

212342,2015-04-17,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"My most recent visit to Hakkasan Las Vegas was exquisite. Our server was charming and attentive, the bussing and running staff were on point and the manager, Yannick, made my friend and I feel right at home.

There are many overhyped restaurants on the Las Vegas strip, but Hakkasan is one of the few that lives up to all of the fanfare and is well worth the price tag. 

We started off with champagne and punctuated each course with warm sake. Sake always manages to lift Asian food to new heights for me. 

For our first course, we ordered the Crispy Duck Salad and the Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab. The Soft Shell Crab had the perfect bite of spice to it and the texture was phenomenal. After eating the crispy duck salad, I have concluded that it is literally the perfect appetizer. In addition to being delicious, it is refreshing, light (but not too light, thanks to the delicious morsel of Hakkasan's peking duck) and has almost every food group covered. A totally ideal way to begin a meal.

For mains, I ordered the Mongolian Beef and my friend went for the Sweet and Sour Pork. Both of these dishes get a bad rap because the food court versions of them are weak. Hakkasan's take on them were incredible. Excluding the plate garnish, there are only two ingredients in their take on Mongolian Beef: beef and peppers. Pulling off essentially a two-ingredient entree is not an easy thing to do - they did it. The marinade/sauce on the beef was equal parts sweet and smoky and the cuts they used were ideal for soaking up those flavors.

Also, their rice game is stellar. Perfectly sticky.

All of the food and drink caught up to us, so we went small for dessert and ordered some of their macaroons. They came in various colors and flavors and were as beautiful as they were tasty.

After this last visit, I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant, its food and its staff. Bravo, Hakkasan. Bravo.",wMPCencOjAXZIO8OHjF8Dg,3,3,5,Y2UnFXBlfocfuJeRZohX2w

Inside the MGM, walk to where they used to have the lions to a dark black walled dead end. This is where I said ""Where is the restaurant?"" Then you see a little black door with a sign over it that says Restaurant. Nice entrance. 

The food is different than any other Chinese Food we had ever eaten. Very upscale rendition of some favorite Chinese dishes and some new one's.

The atmosphere is elegant but inviting. The service is first class. The food is amazing. Mongolian Beef is made with Filet and that really makes a difference. Dim Sum is beyond comparison. The drinks are different and well worth a try...try a couple. I liked the Hakka.

Another thing you will notice is they are quite a bit more expensive than a typical Chinese restaurant, but well worth it.",TvZ6zamTL18AVW56Z3nSQA,4,3,5,IUeVcPo-qp0jfth0cG50Eg

- dim sum (oh yea. We needed up ordering twice)
- scallion and egg rice
- spicy sauced dishes (more schezwan than Cantonese, which is spicy)

429093,2013-05-29,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Little did I know that the original restaurant that my husband and I dined in one rainy night off of Jack the Ripper's path, in London of 2006, would become one of our favorite restaurants globally!

We dined in a Hakkasan Las Vegas for my husband's birthday on May 23. Our reservation was made through Open Table and everything went as planned. Not knowing what to expect, because of high expectations from our London experience, we proceeded with caution, not wanting to get our hopes up too high. I mean the whole vibe, music and ambiance was hard to match.

Upon finding the restaurant, which is at the very back of the MGM, we noticed the logo on the side of the wall and a very nondescript entrance, further peaking our curiosity. Our reception was swift  and we were whisked away to our table. Immediately, I recognized the music, the same feel, the ambiance. Wait! Could this be happening a 2nd time? To my delight it, it was. In a little cubby hole, a real live DJ was serving up the most magnificent sets of music!

Our server , Gerardo, was on point. Taking our drink orders and skillfully answering questions about the menu. A dirty fork, dish or glass never sat on the table long. Even the back waiters have waiters. There is so much service in this place that I started feeling unworthy of this amazing experience! 

Starting with cocktails,  I ordered a Hakka, which was exactly what my taste buds yearned for and my husband ordered an Eden, which is non alcoholic. Both were excellent!

Our first selection from the menu was the Dim Sum Platter, which is 8 pieces total (4 selections) so enough for two. We also ordered the Lobster Soup with tofu. Both were awesome and I could not wait to taste the rest of the food. Everything was perfectly flavored. No complaints at all. I ordered the Lobster XO for a main entree and my husband ordered the Stir Fry black pepper beef ribeye with Merlot. For the our sides, we ordered the Hakka Noodles (do not miss out on the Hakka Noodles!!!) and the braised pea shoots with crab meat. Everything we ate was of the highest possible quality and flavor. The portions were all perfect. I didn't feel as if I were stuffing myself, yet I was satisfied after each dish.

Just when I didn't think things could get any better than dinner, the desert menu arrived. I ordered the PB&J, which is killer, and my husband ordered the chocolate and black sesame cremeaux. I could not stop nibbling on his dessert and didn't want to share mine because it was so good!  As a pastry professional on the Las Vegas Strip, I've seen my fair share of exceptional desserts and fancy pants items created in the top pastry shops in town,  but was blown away not only by the presentation, but the flavor combinations. 

I tried to find something to nit pick about, but left the restaurant fully satisfied and anticipating my next meal at Hakkasan. If you are looking for a nice romantic meal do not miss out on a chance to blow your sweetie's mind with best thing to hit Vegas since...since....Hell, it's the best thing to hit Vegas EVER!!!",u9A0C-aFAn2y0pL7dRV0Ag,2,1,5,niF7R8dTG80fjY8pB3DXtw

441700,2016-07-08,1,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"When I first heard of Hakkasan's restaurant, the first thought that came to my mind was, ""Isn't Hakkasan a night club?"" With this pretense in mind, I was convinced that the restaurant would only offer an overpriced and mediocre menu, typical of many restaurants on the Strip. To my surprise, the menu at Hakkasan was amazing. The quality of their Cantonese food was astonishingly authentic with a twist of modern culinary flair. Our favourite dish was the crispy roasted duck with kumquat and mustard sauce. Although the portion size is relatively small for the price, the duck was prepared perfectly with the meat moist and tender and the skin perfectly crisp. The kumquat and mustard sauce was a delightfully unique combination with the duck. The Hakka steamed dim sum platter was also an interesting option. It was atypical in terms of general dim sum options but still retained the basic essence of Cantonese cuisine. Although most of the of dishes that we ordered were fairly impressive, the one thing that did not quite stand out was the Hakka noodle. Don't get me wrong, the Hakka noodle was prepared well by Asian standards, but it lacked the extra flair that you would expect for a signature dish. With this said, both the food and the ambience were well received. In particular, the interior design itself makes this place definitely worth a try!",e0NhBtOoMtS3v9GLJq5Y6Q,2,1,4,u6r0fuc95u9Y7jIzghjWRw
474761,2016-03-05,2,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"We were a party of three women from Southern California. We were really excited to eat here and then go up to the club. We had heard great reviews on both.

The staff was very friendly and service was a 10. We were seated promptly, had drinks, then ordered food.

We were very disappointed in the quality of 2 out of 3 dishes we ordered. The seared scallops were great! The chicken was very dry and tasteless. In fact we put the chile sauce from the scallops on the chicken to give it some flavor. The Hot and Sour soup was really thick, almost gel like. And not very hot.

As we were leaving and heading to the club the staff was telling us the club is probably not open tonight. Suggesting we make other plans.  Needless to say we went up to the club, it was open and in full swing.  I will never recommend Hakkasan for dinner.

585664,2013-06-03,12,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"This review is for the restaurant only.  Let me start by saying that I am not a club person.  I am much happier in the confines of a neighborhood bar or my trusty loyal couch.  The atmosphere here reminded me of a dark wizards dungeon who happened to be hosting a dinner party.  Low lighting, lots a wood and stone decor, uber trendy waitstaff, and of course ear melting brain squishingly loud music.  The food was small portioned, overpriced, and exceedingly delicious.  The sea bass was my favorite.  The drink menu is also fantastic, and priced on par with any other trendy restaurant on the strip.  

Overall, if you're looking to impress someone by how cool you are and how much money you have, this is great place to start.  But if you are simply looking for a great meal, without the laser breathing dragon show, then you should probably look elsewhere.  (Note: there is not actually a laser breathing dragon show)  This place was not for me, but if you are into the club scene, i'm sure it will be more to your liking.

The restaurant is near the lobby of the MGM Grand, and has a beautiful space with high ceilings and lots of internal dividers to create an intimate environment in a quite large space. The service experience end to end was great, just as you'd expect at this very high price point - super attentive, highly detail oriented, careful and flexible. Overall the environment was great.

The menu has a good but not huge selection of dishes. We initially thought we'd try one of the set menus (which range from $90 to $150 per person), but we couldn't find one we both loved. So we moved to a la carte, and ordered more food than we needed so we could try more dishes.

Some of the dishes were incredible, and all of them were very good. We especially liked the jasmine tea pork ribs, the wok friend lamb chops and the steamed dim sum selections. But all the dishes were really strong. The quality of the cooking and cuisine was as good as we have had.

It's pricey, but they participate in Las Vegas Restaurant Week (RW). So a couple of times a year $80, you can taste some fantastic dishes and get a sense of their menu. 

I've been back a few times since discovering them during RW a few years ago and have enjoyed it every time. Hakkasan focuses on familiar dishes done very well and often with a small twist. I'm a creature of habit and always get:

*dim sum
*hot and sour soup with chicken (delicious--I'm always on the hunt for an amazing hot and sour soup--this one is worth the trip to the strip)
*Tofu in a claypot with  black bean sauce

I dread driving to the strip to go to a restaurant. Any restaurant. There are only a handful of places that I'd brave the crowds and pay the high mark ups for. If I'm going to make the trip, the establishment has to be worth it. And, for my money, Hakkasan is worth it.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,7,0,4,um8PyzvrrlHfZeFLiG6XWQ

From the dim sum appetizers all the way to desert, everything was fantastic. The wife had a shrimp dish and I had the beef, both were beautifully presented and good to the last bite. They have it down here. My only food complaint is that the desert came with an incredibly tasty small scoop of ice cream. When I asked for extra ice cream I was told it was not possible b/c they make 'just enough' for the amount of deserts they make. 

I very much enjoyed the ambiance, it was dark and lit just right to give it a chic feel. I wish they would have a bit more of a personal touch to the service. We were sat and it took over 15 minutes for our waiter to show. even after they took my order they forgot to bring our drinks for another 10 minutes and I had to ask where the drinks were.

Despite the slightly poor service, the main reason this gets a 4 star is because of how pricey the meal was. This is ridiculously expensive Chinese food. Our bill was over $150 and we did not get alcohol. I guess it's par for the course in Vegas.",aNs-Gntd-jtudkZIjvavkQ,2,0,4,9JPJr3HcN4FbCDjpYaEmBg

This Hakkasan is on par with the other locations. Execution is solid and you won't be disappointed. Also, with dinner you get complimentary entry into the Hakkasan nightclub, considered one of the best clubs in Vegas. Can't beat that. Out of the Hakkasan restaurants I've been to, the only one that beats this location is Miami Beach. This is because the Miami Beach location utilizes the branding of Hakkasan, but has more creative control over the menu. As a result, they take the standard Hakkasan dishes and take some of them to the next level. 

Overall, Hakkasan Vegas is a great location and you shouldn't have any complaints about a night out there. Don't forget to hit the club after dinner!",dicwO9n3pld1XOak92X-ig,0,0,4,SBws_76HqtB2tiLeF1Y_0A

With the crazy lasers and the dancers looking like something from a cirque du soleil  show, it reminded me of a rave. 

The place was pretty crowded but we got bottle service at the top floor which was amazing. We had a table right at the middle so we overlooked the whole dance floor and had the dancers across from us with the lasers going crazy between us and the crowd on the main dance floor. The top floor was very spacious and although we had a large group, we had plenty of room to sit around comfortably or to dance. The top floor was much less packed and had a bathroom which not as many people were using which was also nice. 

The experience was much better since we had bottle service though. It did look quite packed on the dance floor downstairs so maybe it would have been different if we just went in with general admission.",TN2d0Nk2y8x1AnUay4RSqg,2,2,5,73gJuLsJ_NqXxkC-V6marg

We sampled a bit from all over the menu, focusing on dishes designated as their specialties, and we enjoyed each and every dish.  The Jasmine tea-smoked beef short rib from the Small Eat section was coated in a thick and savory sauce with the meat falling off the bone.  From the same menu, the Crispy duck roll came out piping hot and full of flavorful duck, a modern take on a classic fried roll.  The special Pipa duck from the Poultry menu was similar to a Peking style duck, with several slices of perfectly cooked duck meat, served with crispy skin on and a sweet sauce.  The special Spicy prawn from the Fish and Seafood menu was another favorite, with the bright colors of the curry and flower garnish drawing us into the spicy-yet-delicate curry flavor.  We still talk about that dish.

The pricing is somewhat high, but should be expected for a higher end Las Vegas restaurant.

The bar prepared balanced and tasty cocktails, and while we didn't sample from the wine menu, it looked as though they had won several accolades for their collection.

To me and my wife's great surprise, the menu says its an upscale Chinese restaurant and we decided to give it a try.
It was the decor that draws us in and it was the food that truly amazes us. The decor itself is a piece of art. Inside of the restaurant resembles traditional Chinese courtyard style with Suzhou style windows and everything.   
The menu items are fairly reasonable priced with dishes ranges from 20-50 dollars and they are all family style dishes. There is a section which they called Supreme dishes which is about 3 to 400 dollars per and they are mainly exotic seafood dishes. 
My wife ordered the Chinese mushroom soup with wolfberry. You can smell the aroma of the mushroom and the soup is very fresh and light. We ordered the Tofu, aubergine and shiitake mushroom claypot in black bean sauce, Mongolian style beef tenderloin and Chicken and salted fish fried rice for our main courses. It was three on the best dishes we've had during our trip to Vegas. The beef tenderlion was VERY tender and juicy and the toufu just melts in your mouth. 
The best part comes in the form of dessert: Coconut pudding. From its presentation to its taste, it was superb.",WZvkPogofliIw9f7hsEyOw,1,4,5,3AWI_6Yyuwp9W14PxCqG_A

Food & drinks - We had he Hakka cocktail, I normally don't like lychee but this was the best lychee cocktail I've had and probably one of the best cocktails ever. It wasn't watered down at all like most places where you're just buying ice. 
Now, the veggie dumplings were simply the best I've had ever and I've been to a really well rated dumpling place in Seattle. This was better. Unique concoction melting in the mouth. So far the Michelin star was holding up. For a Michelin star restaurant, the prices are very reasonable. About $20/entree & $15-18 for appetizers.
Tried the Hakka noodles and veggies in schezwan sauce. Now, while these were both super tasty.. They were more Americanized Chinese and not Cantonese. I have tried authentic Cantonese in China and while they do cook with spices and sauces they don't add lots of oil and sugar. These two dishes tasted more like the local PF Changs. So didn't feel that Michelin-ny here. Anyways, appreciated the several veggie options and portions were large enough. Overall great meal. 
Server was also friendly and offered good recommendations.  
The most irritating and stupid thing about hakkasan is their reservation policy. We tried to reserve for Saturday night (V-day) but they said they were overbooked. The only way was to eat at the bar. I expected a huge line and a crowded bar. 
To my surprise, the bar had seating and several large and small tables were vacant. When I asked, they just said we honor our reservations and if people don't show up, too bad! That's silly. Why would they penalize paying customers at the door to keep the no shows happy? They Should Change that.",jCEPqPBIWLCW0c9jVGbAPg,0,0,4,0YUsFUk7g2qUGCan5P9PzQ

Everything was so flavorful, and the portions were perfect for sharing (we even had left overs which I'm soon thankful for). We ordered a drink from the bar called ""the Hakka"" for us drankin' (you know how we do) and for the ones not drinking, they have a ""Virgin Hakka"" which is just as good. They had little a Lychee garnish on it and it tasted like love, so if you love Love, then you'll love this, i Super recommend this.

Now here's the Best part. For dessert we had a Gianduja, which is a Hazelnut Nut Chocolate mousse with Blood Orange sauce, it was to die for. Macaroons of all sorts of flavors, i wanted to stuff my pockets with these, and a beautiful Exotic Fruit Plater. There was fruits in there i have never tasted or even imagined myself eating. 

The servers and Host where all great, At one point we even thought that maybe our server was the manager thats why he treated us so well, but as it turned out, he wasn't, and we were treated like Celebrities!

The vibe at the restaurant is extremely cool.  Arabic chic... or should I say Sheikh? The menu is world cuisine Fusion with a fine dining edge. The wine list is off the hook with a rotating Coravin selection,  so you can try a glass  (if You just want one) from a bottle not offered by the glass.  Props to the Somm for a great selection and an amazing layout on the list.  

I was able to eat here during Chinese Golden Week when they had a special tasting menu.  I think many of the things are offered year round,  but at larger portions.  My favorites were the Spanish tortilla Dim Sum with truffle and quail egg,  and the Vegas Concord dessert.

The decor was modern and sleek looking, with shades of blue and black.  We ordered ala carte from both their regular and Chinese New Year's special menu.  All the dishes were executed perfectly, though a few really stood out.  

Hakka Cocktail is the best - imagine sake, vodka (masked by the sake), coconut, guava, and lychee and you have the ultimate Asian-themed cocktail!  The Kumquatcha was more sour and bitter - next time better to get two Hakkas.

Abalone and dry scallop fried rice is similar to the traditional Fukien-style fried rice, with this rich gravy mixed into the rice.  My palate wasn't good enough to taste the abalone, but I did like this dish.

Roasted Silver Cod with Champagne and Honey was amazing - rich, luxurious fish cooked perfectly.

Hakka Noodles - Similar to Pad Thai in texture but with a spicy afterkick.

Pak Choi with Garlic - Just a side dish but had good crunchiness and garlic flavor.

For dessert, there's the Hazelnut Mousse with blood orange that was elegant and had good contrasts in textures and flavors.  However the real winner for me was the black sesame and chocolate dumplings in Yuzu - wow who would of thought thise flavors worked so well - sweet plus bitter and a granular filling surrounded by a soft skin.  The topped each dumpling with a small bit of salt for some reason - but it was all good.

Pretty good place to splurge. Service was wonderful.  They actually card you if you order cocktails - excellent way to flatter customers!",VHjR5F6mdnLrQcCb0nqCYg,5,2,4,JxrjKlgkAbU0oVzRqyhrRA

The service was great. The food fantastic. We ordered many different dishes and each was really good. It exceeded my expectations, although I wasn't breastfed so take that for what it's worth.

I was really looking forward to this dinner as I have heard & read many good things about the restaurant. We (me, wife, daughter [age 14], mom, dad) were celebrating a couple of things: it was my dad's 79th birthday that day, and it was the 50th anniversary of my family's first trip to Las Vegas. We've been coming to Las Vegas for a long time and wanted this trip to be special.

When I booked the reservation I was asked if there was anything special about our visit and I provided the details. When I checked in for our reservation they asked me some additional questions about our special occasion - I thought this was a nice touch. More on this later.

We were escorted to our table promptly at our 6:00 p.m. reservation time. The decor of the restaurant is interesting. It is dark but I wouldn't call it intimate because the tables are fairly close together.

Our server greeted us and knew the menu and cocktails well -  so far, so good.

We placed our drink order and a few minutes later did the same with our food. Our server advised us that the entrees are very large and meant to be shared. Even with that advice we ordered five entrees for the five of us.

Not long after we ordered our food (still haven't received our drinks) I noticed that the party next to us received their food. Wow! That was fast - way too fast. They must be in a hurry, I thought.

A couple minutes later we received our drinks and they were definitely worth the wait - exceptional cocktails. My gin & tonic contained a single, long cylinder of ice that had pieces of cucumber it it. The drink was outstanding.

But not even five minutes after our drinks arrived so did our food. We have probably only been in the restaurant for 20 minutes, if that. We looked at the entrees (everything looked and smelled great) and all of us at the same time said, ""Really? These are large?"" Don't be fooled - the entrees are definitely not large. if we had ordered 3-4 entrees as was recommended then we would have left hungry.

The food was good - I had the rib eye, which is one of the house specialties. It was good - we all enjoyed the food. When it was time to order dessert we looked at the menu and just said, ""meh"". We were in and out of the restaurant in less than an hour.

And as for our celebration? Nothing. Would I go back? No, I wouldn't. There are far too many good restaurants in Las Vegas to warrant a return visit to this one.",Ult6n4oRODIS-8dT34FelA,0,0,2,G9k92yvQmSt_xxwqZlxAeQ

Oh yeah, they didn't comp the dumplings that almost killed the person.  Not even kidding.

Anyway, the food was ok.  Some good (duck salad) and some bad (dumplings, hot and sour soup and smoked short rib, which was really quite terrible).

We booked over a week in advance, and the earliest reservations we were able to get at Hakkasan were 10:30pm, but in Vegas, who cares!

The interior decor in Hakkasan was awesome, it was dark, but had a cool feeling.  Attention to detail was great, including the dragons embroidered on the cushions of the booths. 

Between 4 of us (who weren't very hungry), we ordered the crispy duck salad, Hakka steamed dim sum platter, Hakka noodle with mushrooms and Chinese chives, lamb, and braised pork belly clay pot.  All of the dishes were very good, and I would likely order them again.  The portions were perfect for sharing for 4 people, there was enough for everyone to have a taste of everything, and then some.

Standout dishes included the pork belly and the crispy duck.  Not too healthy, but super delicious!

The prices were a bit high, but the quality was great, the portions were definitely sufficient, and I think if you were on a budget, you could easily eat for $50/person, which in my opinion is definitely worth it for the Hakkasan experience!

Love the interior and exterior.  Very dark and sexy.  I think they could up the game a bit and put all the ladies in cuter dresses.  The red tulip dresses are NOT figure flattering.

Eats:
-Hakka steamed dim sum platter, good, as expected, they should provide vinegar
-Green asparagus and mountain yam salad, SO GOOD.  And vegan, what?!?!  
-Braised pea shoots and crab meat, gelatinous like old school Chinese, not great
-Braised lion head meatballs with truffle and cabbage, really tender and flavorful
-Mongolian style beef tenderloin, great meat, I didn't love the sauce

If you're celebrating something, let them know and they will bring you a steamer full of colorful macarons and a candle, all complimentary.  I liked the earl grey the most. The shell just fell apart and not as chewy as I like.

The duck of the duck salad was tender, and the pomegranate added a nice texture! The noodles were delicious and we're great with the spicyness of the prawn! I absolutely loved every second of my time there! 
We also got the exotic fruit platter and the gianduja which was Amazing. They really put love and passion into their desserts and you can definitely tell. The quality is superb and I am impressed with the pastry team!

The timing was perfect they brought out the salad first and then halfway through our salad they brought the dumplings. Both were delicious! Then for our family style entrées we had the black truffle duck and ribeye, and for our side we had the asparagus. You would think that duck for both appetizer and entree was too much but the entree had crispy skin and the broth was amazing. If you love truffle like I do then you will love the duck. The duck appetizer was cooked completely opposite which was tender and complemented the salad well. The ribeye, even though it was cut in small bite sized pieces was cooked to medium perfection! The asparagus still had a little bite to it and was cooked just right. They gave us a complimentary dessert to celebrate our anniversary which was some kind if pistachio cake, that was great too. Overall a very good meal. Ambiance is perfect if you like privacy, meaning all the sections are blocked off so that it feels like the restaurant is only as big as your section but it made it hard for me to navigate to the restroom and back to my table because it was like a maze.

2011627,2014-03-30,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Ponied up at bar before it got too busy. No one at the bar but me and a couple others. Hakkasan restaurant is UBER sexy but I was a little put off by the snotty female bartenders. Even the lady sitting at the bar next to me noticed their dismissive behavior without my saying a word. 

For starters, it took forever to be acknowledged. When she finally comes over, there was no smile. No friendly greeting. Just a plain face and a cocktail napkin put in front of me and a blank look. She eventually loosened up, but only after I made an effort to connect with her. Should be the other way around though. Just saying. The lady next to me with her BF asked the other bartender what was in a particular specialty cocktail she was making. Bartender looked at her and plainly said...vodka. Then walked away. Wow!!!

If I were giving out stars for service, I'd dole out a 2+. But the quality, creativity and showmanship of the cocktails made up for the bad behavior of a couple mean girls.  

My first cocktail was a vodka made with quinoa. It was really smooth with a sweet, clean finish.  After dinner I ordered the Smoky Negroni cocktail (Ransom Old Tom barrel aged gin, Antica Formula vermouth, Campari and Grand Marnier smoke infusion). Tasted very similar to an Old Fashioned. Classic with a twist. Very good! 

For food I ordered the Hakka braised pork belly clay pot. Very tender and full of garlic and gingery flavors. It's a little rich, so I'd recommend sharing this dish as an appetizer. 

Like most LV restaurants of this caliber, be prepared for a $$$$ experience.

While waiting for my party to arrive, I got the Bird's Eye Margarita. Chili infused mescal with agave, lime and spicy bitters...YUM. If you like your drinks with an inferno element to it, I definitely recommend this guy. My friends and I ordered quite a bit from the menu, starting off with the Vegetarian Dim Sum for the non-meat eater at our table. I only sampled the Truffle Beancurd Roll, I was very smitten by the depth of flavor from the earthy truffle. The Seared Scallops were cooked perfectly and the sweet mango and spicy chili sauce played nicely off the tongue. Our last app of Fried Soft Shell Crab with Curry Leaf and Chili was finely chopped. It was nice not having to pick apart a whole crab to get through this dish. While we were waiting for the main dishes to arrive, our sommelier picked out an exquisite bottle of Sancerre that was an excellent match to our meal. We decided to try the Pak Choi with Salted Fish off the veggie portion of the menu, it was good but didn't blow me away. Our server highly recommended the Roasted Silver Cod with Champagne and Honey. This dish was impeccable and the subtle flavors of champagne and honey were a consummate match with the cod, definitely a winner in my book. I wanted to try the Peking duck with the Russian caviar but the price point was a little too much. So we opted for the Crispy Roast Duck with Kumquats and Mustard Sauce. I have a thing for sour fruits so the kumquats in this dish made me very happy. All the noodle options sounded a bit decadent so we went with the simple Hakka Noodles with Mushrooms and Chives. We decided to end our meal on a high note with the Vanilla Panna Cotta with Strawberries, Rhubarb + a light Champagne foam. The dessert was served in a terranium type glass, I found myself just staring at the crystal like bubble not wanting to disturb this beautiful work of art. This sweet treat was very refreshing, I loved the creaminess of the panna cotta with the strawberries and rhubarb. Wow I can honestly say that this meal was the highlight of our trip.

We were a group of 14 seated in the beautiful semi-private 'cage' area where you're surrounded by golden lamps and lush dark wood carvings. My (now) husband and I are obsessed with Asian food and we wanted somewhere with the wow factor to treat our nearest and dearest after our ceremony - so Hakkasan fit the bill perfectly on both counts. My main concern was that it lived up to the hype, particularly given the steep price tag we were paying. I needn't have worried - we were treated like royalty (I think turning up in my white dress got me some extra love too hehe!) and most importantly the food was both delicious and very generously portioned. We'd chosen a set group menu of their signature dishes in advance and the only requirement was that the veggies sat together as it's all served family style for sharing. I only wish I could have managed to eat more! We got through plenty of drinks meanwhile, mostly sticking to their gorgeous cocktail menu, then splurged on some Japanese whisky flights at the end of the meal for a special treat. The staff were polite and attentive and the front of house lady in charge of our table took care of us extremely well. We hadn't quite hit our minimum spend by the end of the meal (miraculously!) so they let us continue the party at their sexy bar counter, where the highlight was my maid of honour's 5-cocktails-in 'speech'.

Food: Ordered the Tofu, aubergine and shiitake mushroom claypot in black bean sauce. Tasted fantastic. Also had the Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter, which was terrific as well. We opted for light entrees, as we were about to see Above and Beyond in the club that night.

Service: Hakkasan was kind of busy that night since it was restaurant week on a Friday, so we had to wait a bit for drinks and for our order to be taken.

Two other friends join us for a belated birthday dinner - it was great company and a great evening with great service. 

This is what we ate! 

Crispy Duck Salad with pomelo, pomegranate and pine nut: AMAAAZZZIIING!! I don't even like duck. EVER. Like i DISLIKE it. And this was SOOO damn gooooooooood!!! Holy shiet. It is a definitely MUST TRY!! 

Sesame prawn toast with foie gras: This was VERY freakin' good! Just be careful! Do NOT bite directly into this prawn ball AND when cutting into ti also be careful because it will SQUIRT!! 

Spicy prawn with lily bulb and almond: I loved the sauce with this dish! Nom nom! Just a hint of spicy heat. Loved it! 

Stir-fry udon noodle with shredded duck and XO sauce: Again, i am not a duck fan but this duck stir fried in with the noodles wasn't bad at all. 

Stir-fry black pepper beef ribeye with merlot: This was good. Rj super enjoyed it but it didn't really stand out to me. 

Scallops: I was actually cravings scallops but I was not impressed with this dish. The flavor was aiiiight but I felt the scallops were a TINY bit overcooked and I think that makes quite a big difference! 

Steamed red snapper in spicy assam sauce: This wasn't bad, but it didn't really stick out TOO much and it seemed kind of dry. 

And this is what I drank! 
The Hakka: Belvedere vodka, Masumi Okuden junmai sake, coconut, lime, passion fruit and lychee juice - It was GOOD but it was VERY sweet, The lychee was REALLY good.. Actually the whole drink tasted like Lychee... Later I switched to some Circoc Peach! 

And this is what we had for dessert! 
Chocolate & black sesame crémeux black sesame Florentine, yuzu ice cream; This was interesting. The chocolate was good and the sesame thing was kind of odd. Not at all your typical dessert! 

Ice creams and sorbets: An assortment of three different flavors. I think one of them was like a mint greek yogurt and it was BLAH! I spit it out. Sorry I'm not sorry. 

Macaroons: They brought out a little plate of these with a HAPPY BIRTHDAY sign for our friend Rj and a little candle. How sweet! 

SO after all that... My FAVORITE items were the Crispy Duck Salad and the Prawn Toast... Am I gonna be knocking down the door to come back here asap?? No way... and Yeah still FOUR Stars because that damn duck salad and prawn toast!!!! SO BOMB.",Rdt-JiAN7Qlw3dJ7UVdNtw,4,1,4,Q2LMkYsmKaCNm-YVe6L2xw

2462778,2014-12-01,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"If Hakkasan the nightclub is anything like Hakkasan the Restaurant I'll probably wait to head back. There is one very common ingredient that seperates a $10-15 entree from a $30+ one - and it has nothing to do with food. That ingredient is service. I can find a $15 steak around Las Vegas almost as easily as I can find $1 bud lights. The reason I occasionally pay $40 for a steak is because the service I get at the $40 joint vs. the $10 dive is better. The wait staff is more attentive, the ambiance is nicer, it's just a fancier experience start to finish. With all of that said, while Hakkasan does have some good grub, their service is not up to par with the other high end Strip restaurants. They are probably 4-5 stars on food and 2 stars on service, for this one I'm rounding down.

Our waitress wasn't awful, but when the dining fare is $65 a head (our bill was $130 for 2) I expect my glass to remain full, the table to remain clean, and the waitress to remain present. That wasn't a regular occurance on my latest visit to Hakkasan. The food itself was pretty solid. The Roasted Chilean Sea Bass is definitely my favorite item on the menue. Sweet and flaky, this fish is not fishy at all and is cooked to perfection. We began our meal with the steamed dumplings. Very good, you get 2 of the same flavor and four different flavors. 3 of the 4 included shrimp, the other had duck - all of them were tasty. In addition to the Sea Bass we went with a Pork Belly dish. Not sure what I was expecting, but I didn't love this. Way too fatty of a piece of meat for me, though when I did get a bite of actual pork that was very good. The sticky buns that came with the dish were also really good. Our waitress had a chronic case of RBF (urban dictionary that - you're welcome). Not her fault (I don't think), but it didn't help the cause.

For $135 there is better service and better food on the Las Vegas Strip. I can't say I'd go out of my way to dine here again, nor would I want to sway someone from trying Hakkasan.

The atmosphere is great - it's a bit dark, but this is Vegas. I had the Weapon of Choice (some cocktail I picked out of the menu without really looking) and it was pretty strong. The food is served family style, so our table ended up with vegetarian dumplings, fried rice, the vegetarian dim sum sampler, mapo tofu, and some mixed vegetables. 

The dumplings/potstickers were the best thing I ate at that meal. The mapo tofu was really not that good, but maybe it's because my parents are from Sichuan and I have some higher expectations. The mixed veggie dishes are not very inspired and kind of bland. The dim sum was pretty tasty. So I'd sayoverall, the appetizers were much better than the main meal.

Crispy duck salad is a must try as well as the dim sum platters. The wok-seared wagyu beef was so tender and full of flavors. My husband and I are duck lovers so the black truffle roasted duck with crispy skin was such a treat. The roasted silver cod in with Champagne and Chinese honey was also delicious as the fish was tender, smooth and creamy with the sauce. The lobster dish was good but did not stand out as compared to the other dishes. The desserts were okay. Overall, the portions are a bit too much for two people so we ended up with a few take out boxes (not complaining! we did snack throughout the night). The ambiance was excellent. It was quiet when we first arrived around 7pm. As the restaurant started to fill up, the music was also turned up a bit to match the noise level.

The eclectic creativity in the restuarant comes in the form of Chinese dim sum / tapas. Not necessarily all dishes are 5 stars (4 stars for sure), but perhaps I was expecting more due to the hype about the restaurant and how fabulous the nightclub is). The ""Dim Sum Platter"" is a signature dish, with your classic steamed Cantonese dim sum bites. It's beautiful to look at; meticulously prepared dim sum reminiscent of jewels sitting in a bamboo steamer. It's certainly tasty, the wrapping on the har gow and shumai wrapper is paper thin (which is what you want), but you know, although it was beautiful and delicious, it wasn't extraordinary. You've probably had dim sum just as good elsewhere. The standout of the evening was actually the fried soft shell crab. It was amazing!!!! When the dish arrives at the table, it's a little deceiving. The soft shell crab comes deconstructed....a heaping nest of fried crab threads tossed with chili and curry leaf.

Multiple people in past months have told me that Hakkasan serves some of the best food they have ever had, I had a hard time believing that until yesterday.  The food is exceptional.  My fear was that the plates were going to be small and that I would have to order a lot to get full, but quite honestly, as long as you order one small and one large entree, you should be fine.

Highlights for me (carnivore) were the duck salad and the rib eye entree.  Good lord, the duck salad does not look very appetizing when it first comes out, but oh my it was good.  It almost looks like the duck is on a bed of dry grass (looks strange), but do not worry, for a party is about to start in your mouth!!  Clean pieces of crispy duck accompanied with those greens (not really sure what kind they were) with fruit like pomegranate.  The salad was lightly dressed, didn't need help with much of a heavy dressing.  Simple, clean flavors, wow!

The rib eye, I have never had rib eye this tender in my whole life.  I need to learn how they prepare it, very exceptional dish.  

Cocktails done right!  I suggest the Broken Promise if you are into bourbon.

I ordered the Hakka cocktail and it was probably my favorite drink I had during our Vegas trip. If you love lychee, coconut, and tropical flavors this was so good! 

We started off with the steamed dim sum platter and crispy duck salad. Dim sum tasted so fresh! It was quite filling as well. Crispy duck salad was so good. There was more duck than ""salad"" though which it's probably not really a problem for most but it made the dish more filling or heavier than we wanted. For our entrees we ordered the Chilean Sea bass with chinese honey and egg and scallion fried rice to share. The sea bass was cooked perfectly. The flavor reminded me of chasu pork in a way. Unfortunately the fried rice was a bit dry for our tastes. 

We were quite surprised how large the portions were. Both tables that were next to us were complaining about it as well. Before coming I was thinking of doing one of the signature menus but now I realized we would have probably 4 times more food. We even had to take food to go!  Hubby said it's such a nice restaurant but the portions should be more refined. But you can also say you got you got your money's worth right?

This is a long overdue review which I've saved for when I have some time to sit down and write.

Vegas is known for decadence and excess, and Hakkasan is a prime example of that. This isn't your typical Chinese restaurant, so be ready to splurge some pretty pennies (make that handsome Benjamins!). Set aside your pennies for some fast food later because although the dishes here are breathtakingly beautify, the portions are less than generous, so you'll end up feeling hungry sooner than later.

Elegant, classy, upscale, and unique are some of the words to describe this establishment. As soon as you see the entrance you know you're in for an amazing experience. 

Everything from the decor (outside the restaurant, at the front desk, to the restrooms) are all luxurious and modern.

Everything we ate was flavorful, but the wow factor was definitely the presentation. From beef served in a ""nest"" made of fried noodles, to beautifully crafted ""dim sum"" dishes, and of course, the head-turning exotic fruit platter. Needless to say many pictures were taken and posted on our respective social media accounts.

I'm looking forward to my next visit, I just won't bring the entire village (we had a party of 10 or 11 last time!) :D",fy4vOa5DPVKhwyyqW6BiPw,5,3,5,Op1AoprgbJy6cwzZXAepMQ

2688577,2013-07-26,1,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"London-based Hakkasan first appeared strong on my radar when it opened in San Francisco late last year. I had heard great reviews but just couldn't fit it in while I was up there during Christmas. That location was the tenth in the worldwide chain, known for its high-end Chinese cuisine; in fact, two of its locations (NYC and London) have garnered Michelin stars, a relative rarity for a Chinese restaurant. Hakkasan's eleventh location marks its biggest splash of all, with a $100 million, 5-floor, 75,000 square-foot restaurant/nightclub. Literally and figuratively, it's Las Vegas' biggest opening this year.

Our meal began with a colorful lineup of cocktails - two alcoholic and two non-alcoholic (pictured left to right).

Eden black grapes, rose sugar, lychee juice, soda water
The Chinese Mule ketel one vodka, masumi junmai sake, cilantro, ginger, lime, ginger beer
The Hakka belvedere vodka, masumi okuden junmai sake, coconut, passion fruit, lychee juice
Mandarine Sunshine kumquats, apple, ginger, fever-tree ginger ale

We each enjoyed our drinks. I had the Chinese mule, their Asian twist on the classic. I thoroughly enjoy cocktails with savory ingredients, and this was no exception.

As with many Chinese restaurants, the menu at Hakkasan is fairly vast. We picked out one item from each section of the menu focusing in on the house specialties (signified by the Hakkasan logo).

Salt and Pepper Squid - The salt and pepper squid was a relatively simple dish not unlike one you'd get at a typical Chinese restaurant. Tender squid was covered in a crispy batter with much of the flavor coming from fried chilies and shallots. Whereas I find this dish to be somewhat inconsistently prepared across restaurants, this one was well-executed.

Crispy Duck Salad with pomegranate, pine nut and shallot - The server highly recommended this, spending a good five minutes selling us on it. The duck was pretty tasty, with a crispy skin that held up with the lightly dressed salad. A little bit of pomegranate seeds and fried lotus root added some additional texture. We all thought this was a great, well-balanced dish.

Roasted Chilean Sea Bass with Chinese honey - This was one of the best dishes of the evening, a succulent piece of fish roasted in honey. The earthiness and texture of fried mushrooms was the main accompaniment, but the real star was the rich, moist fish.

Pipa Duck - This was another highlight, simple but very well done. Thin strips of sweet duck were served with its own crisp skin. I think some of the fat was trimmed, leaving a nice balance of meat-fat-skin in these delicious pieces.

Stir-Fry Black Pepper Beef Ribeye with Merlot - The beef here was very tender, similar to a tenderloin in texture. A savory sauce didn't add a ton of flavor to the meat, but they were tasty chunks of meat nonetheless. Note to self: the woven fried noodle 'basket' isn't really edible.

Three-Style Mushroom Stir-Fry with macadamia nut, gai lan stalks and water chestnut - This dish was more interesting texturally than flavor-wise. Assorted chewy mushrooms and crunchy stalks of gai lan made for some lighter bites in between the meat and fish.

French Beans with minced pork and dried shrimp - Dried shrimp and a porky flavor stood out with these beans, cooked just enough to be tender with a firm snap to them. A very nice side dish.

Hakka Noodle with mushrooms and Chinese chives - Our primary starch component, in addition to Jasmine rice, was this dish of stir fried noodles. They were good with a light spice, though altogether unspectacular.

Upon completion of the savory dishes, we ordered a trio of sweet ones.

'PB&J' peanut butter parfait, sour cherry jam, banana and passion fruit sorbet
Chocolate and Black Sesame Cremeux sesame florentine, yuzu ice cream
Strawberries & Champagne vanilla panna cotta, organic strawberries, rhubarb, Champagne foam

Each of these were beautifully plated. My brother got the PB&J, featuring rich peanut butter and sour cherry flavors, complemented by passion fruit sorbet. My dad opted for the chocolate and black sesame dessert, with creamy flavors accented by a bright yuzu ice cream. My mother went lighter with the vanilla panna cotta topped with Harry's Berries strawberries, an interesting Champagne foam, and a crumble for texture. And me? I just got an extra spoon to sample each. My favorite was the last one.

The food was as beautiful as the decor, and just about everything was pretty tasty. The cuisine primarily stays true to traditional Chinese, not moving towards more Western fusion influences that a lot of other high-end Asian restaurants do. As a result, the food felt very comfortable in a way; but make no mistake, it was also significantly more refined than the average Chinese restaurant (and the prices reflect that).",WhCtEF8OyymlwMLDiIffMg,8,3,4,3QDkzaXxPhw-e4WweGC5Zg
2698016,2013-05-28,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"I have been hearing fabulous things about the new nightlife mecca that is Hakkasan long before it's opening this past April. My friend does PR for the brand and I grew up in Las Vegas, so any new opening  is exciting and warrants a trip home to see what all the buzz is about.  We made reservations weeks before, and had planned to eat around 8:30 on Saturday before entering the club later to see Tiesto. It is a bit tricky to find/enter the restaurant, because you have to walk through the entirety of the massive MGM casino floor to the other side, and navigate the signs and ropes that herd the club-goers into their appropriate lines to find a little opening that says ""restaurant"".  Inside, blue lights glow and 4 hostesses wait behind a lobby desk to check you in. 

The service is impeccable from the start, and although we were a few minutes late (leave about 15 minutes to walk through the MGM), we were seated right away. The restaurant takes up the first 2 floors of the 5 story Hakkasan space, and the interior is breathtaking.  While the restaurant is huge, it is broken up into intimate spaces by an endless web of intricately woven wooden panels stationed horizontally and vertically. The walls glow blue, and the dark wood decor is tasteful and elegant. The menu is vast, and is broken up into sections i.e. Meat, Fish, Veggies, Starch, etc. like a standard Chinese restaurant, but we asked our server for recommendations.  

We started with the Crispy Duck Salad which is one of their renowned items and for good reason. The duck alone is divine, it is poached and steamed in a chinese spice mixture for hours before being fried in rice flour, then added to a plum dressing mixture with greens, pine nuts, pomelos, and more mouth-watering ingredients. It was truly astonishing how amazing it was. 

Next came the Sesame Shrimp Toast w/ Foie Gras which I was most excited about, since CA has outlawed the delectable delicacy, but I was greatly disappointed. The dish was 4 hearty spheres of a solid shrimp mixture completely coated in sesame seeds.  Supposedly when we bit into them, foie gras would ooze out but that was not the case. If there was foie gras in there, we did not find it. Disappointing and bland. 

Next we ordered a cup of Hot & Sour soup, a dish my boyfriend and I both love and were curious to see how Hakkasan interpreted it. It was good, different though... it had a sweet and almost fishy flavor to the broth. 

For our larger dishes we ordered the Black Pepper Rib-eye Merlot Stir-fry which came with sauteed onions and garlic and was absolutely out of this world.  Some of the most tender steak I've had in general, and was a wonderful experience to have that flavor and texture in a stir-fry dish.  We also ordered the Sweet & Sour Pork which was fresh and very flavorful.  

We had wanted to order the fried crab appetizer and a veggie dish as well, but realized quickly we were getting very full because we foolishly had a snack at the Todd English Pub around 5:30 pm (more on that later!). I wish we could have sampled more dishes and cocktails...I only tried the Hakka which was vodka and sake mixed with passion fruit and lychee juice and was absolutely incredible. 

The menu provides plenty of options for a fantastic meal, for 2 our bill was about $137. There are also specialty dishes with abalone and caviar and some seafood dishes that can run up to $400, so clearly it depends what you order. I believe the average cocktail is $15-18, although they also offer about 5 for $120. So, you can choose what type of experience you wish to have, although dining at Hakkasan alone is absolutely an indulgent and upscale experience.

Our waitress Catalina was the most gracious, helpful, and genuinely fantastic server we have had in years, she really helped make our experience memorable. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu, hopefully I will in 3 weeks when I'm back in my home away from home!",bkcWR-bVxx4wjRkjZdUfNQ,4,1,4,_W-6zp8fyGrh-zktpVib6g

The one star review stems from a massive and embarrassing screw up with a custom cake. I called the restaurant two weeks before my reservation to inquire about a custom cake for my husband's 35th birthday. The person I spoke to suggested LV Pastry Palace (5 stars to this bakery!). The bakery confirmed delivery the day of the reservation. Hakkasan has advised that when we arrived I should discreetly advise the hostess that we had a custom cake for a surprise party. The hostess was beyond rude and screamed out that she'd been at the restaurant since 6 and there was no cake. There goes the surprise. I asked for a manager. She again told me there was 100% no cake, she would know. The manager finally came over and was also incredibly rude and again loudly told our party that there was no cake. I told him that the bakery had confirmed and again he very rudely told me that this was the bakery's faulty and not the restaurant. He stormed off. We were seated and ordered drinks. After our drink order the same manager runs by the table (mind you never breaking stride) and screams ""we found the cake!""

I was originally planning on ordering the dim sum platter but for $28 for 8 pieces (so, $3.50 a piece the size of a chicken nugget--or smaller), I couldn't justify ordering this when I know you can get 4 pieces for $2.50 at most Chinese/Asian restaurants.

Instead, I opted for the crispy duck salad for the same price and MUCH MORE BULK.... more bang for your buck for sure! AND, it was out-of-this-world-delicious! There there small chunks of crispy duck skin, pieces of pomegranate and citrus, and lots of greens. My friends kept re-dipping their forks onto my plate.

My friend and I shared the hot & sour soup and it did not disappoint. It came out steaming hot, so be careful, but the taste was perfection. Again, probably overpriced, but one of the cheapest items on the menu.

I got to try the scallops from my friend and the shot rib from my other friend... both delicious. There wasn't one bad dish that we tried. We also paired the meal with a bottle of red between the 5 of us and were all able to have at least one glass.

Employees 5/5. All the hostesses, waiters, etc. were extremely courteous and friendly. Me double likey.

Food 3.5/5. Very average. It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't great. I expected some sort of mind-blowing type of dish when I dine somewhere as fancy as Hakkasan but maybe that's because I'm a country bumpkin. No likey, no dislikey.

Price 2/5. As far as the bill goes, I wasn't surprised that it came to the amount it had. But because of the fact that the food was extremely average, it didn't justify the amount it came up to. Anywhere else, it would have been half (at least). #firstworldproblems

3107586,2015-11-27,3,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Food: Since it was my first visit here, I wanted to order the dish that I always see featured, which is their Dim Sum platter. It's eight pieces of steamed dumplings. For $29.00. Now I'm sure that they have fresh and quality ingredients, but that's really the most I've ever paid for dim sum. It was good, but it didn't wow me. We ordered other dishes, like the Tofu and Eggplant, Shrimp Fried Rice, Egg and Scallion Fried Rice, and Short Ribs. While all were okay tasting, none of these dishes really amazed me. Some of the portions of food were meant to share, and others didn't. Especially my dim sum platter. Which I ordered more out of curiosity. 

Environment/Ambiance: Upscale, classy, dark, could be romantic and intimate if it wasn't so loud. I didn't get to see the entire restaurant but it seemed like a maze and it was just so dark., much like a nightclub. 

Service: I'm a little torn about service. Starting at beginning of our visit, somehow they messed up our reservation and since our party was too big to begin with, they had initially split us up. Upon checking in for our reservation, they had somehow lost the second one. So we would be able to all eat at the same time, we had opted to check in, but also get a table for the rest of our party. They had us wait all wait at the bar for the time being and sat us not only separately, but far away from each other. Which really put a damper on the night since we were celebrating a special occasion. 

Tips: I would probably come back for a special occasion, like a date, a special birthday, or another bachelorette party. But otherwise, I would rather get my asian food elsewhere.",3J1zT17J07X5OUeFq0lgMQ,7,3,3,Ngy9C-BSmBoztDEqWNE6Jw

The decor is beautiful - very modern and maze-shaped, almost like a futuristic Alice in Asian Wonderland.  The lighting could have been a bit brighter, as the menus were a bit difficult to read in the dark and I could hardly see myself in the bathroom mirror.

Hakkasan's menu is extensive, featuring dozens of upscale Chinese cuisine options.  With so many choices, we ordered four plates and shared.  The Crispy Duck Salad was the best of the bunch, with the Braised Pork Belly a close second.  Both were some of the best Chinese dishes I've had in my life.  The Stir-Fry Udon Noodle with Shredded Duck and Fried Soft Shell Crab were both good but not amazing - of comparable quality to other high end Chinese places I've eaten at.

We finished our meal with a couple Irish Coffees.  After such a heavy meal, they were the perfect pick-me-up to send us on our way to a night of drinking and gambling.

there were 2 desserts, a coconut pudding w/ caramelized pineapple and a choc thing which looked like a kit kat bar.  again...small.

Music is loud so do not expect to have an intimate conversation. The food was excellent. Well cooked and well presented. I take umbrage at people who say the portions are small, The Cheesecake Factory this is not! People are so used to massive quantities of poor quality food that they fail to recognize a good thing when they see it. I'm not saying the place isnt pricey, it is. But the quality of food makes up for it. And the portions are just right for an individual. You dont leave the table feeling stuffed and that's how it should be. The one star I have taken off is for the dessert. It was hugely underwhelming. I ordered the Strawberries and Cream Champagne with high expectations. Dessert is a very important part of the meal and this was a huge let-down for me. I barely got through a fourth of it. The strawberries were sour, the pannacotta tasteless and the dry biscuit powder was, well, dry powder. All of this thrown carelessly in a glass was not appealing on any level.

My husband and I were celebrating our 2nd year anniversary as well as our soon to be parenthood, and we couldn't have had a better night. It started with the pleasant smiley hostess who sat us even though we were an hour early, continued with the table assistant who offered us sparking or still water, and continued on with our server, Rich. He was very knowledgable and we took every recommendation he had. Every single dish was a 10! Rich was funny, interesting, but didn't over talk to us. I have a tendency to talk too much which doesn't always please the hungry mouths around me, but Rich was quick witted and worked magic with his timing, his experience, and his passion for the amazing dishes at Hakkasan. I would definitely advise anyone and everyone to enjoy a meal at Hakkasan with Rich. The entire night was perfect, and his recommendations were better than anything I could have imagined. At the end of our meal, he surprised us with a variety of Macaroon Cookies and a Chocolate ""Happy Anniversary"" candy. I think the lime was my favorite but they were all scrumptious.
It felt like we were eating a gourmet meal at a chef's house with all of his suggestions and pairings. I just hope that when my husband and I visit the SF Hakkasan, we are greeted with the same service and food/drinks that Rich at the Las Vegas Hakkasan was able to provide.

We came to Hakkasan during Restaurant Week 2018. We each had the $50 prix fixe menu with an additional appetizer apiece.  We also began with a bourbon (big pour) and a Japanese Old Fashioned (more fruity than boozy, but very strong and tasty).  

For our meal we began with the hot and sour soup and the duck and foie gras in sesame wrap.  The hot and sour soup was just a very high scale, great rendition, but nothing surprising.  The sesame roll was fantastic.  Soft skin, crispy duck, and though only a tiny spread of foie gras, oh so delectable - a must try appetizer.

For our dinner we had the vegetarian and the Hakka dim sum platters.  Each was presented in a very instagramy way and each was prepared to perfection in a soft, thin wrap, with tons of meat inside.  The veggie platter had a fake duck and chicken that tasted like the real thing, while the Hakka, focusing more on seafood, was fresh and thick and crunchy.  Perfect opening dish.  For the entree, we had the szechuan sea bass and the rib eye.  Sea bass was the real deal.  Easy to cut and a real Chinese, upscale dish.  The rib eye, as expected, was cooked to a chewy goodness, in a very dippable merlot sauce.  The rib eye did come with some unappetizing fried noodle, but given that the fried rice accompanying the meal is fresh as you can get, I didn't worry too much.  They also had a chili dipping sauce from the dumpling that was so good and gave just enough kick, that we even kept it to use during our entrees.  The carrot cake was unexpectedly good.  A Chinese restaurant offering carrot cake was interesting to say the least, but their rendition with a coconut ice cream on the side was very good and a nice palate cleanser to end the meal.  

Restaurant Week strikes again and Hakkasan did not disappoint.  For $50, we would have definitely felt satisfied.  Adding on a few appetizers and drinks, we were stuffed.  My only complaint was that the dessert, the carrot cake, could not be substituted, although we both got Restaurant Week menus.  In the future, I think they should be able to substitute to let the entire table try other dishes if you all order the fixed menu.  The place gets quite busy on Friday and Saturday nights, so even with a reservation we had to wait another 15 minutes at the bar.

3455185,2014-03-15,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"This review is for the Spring 2014 Las Vegas Restaurant Week Menu.

Personally, I don't dine at Asian restaurants on The $trip because I can a get quick, cheap, and authentic meal in Chinatown. However, I'm making an exception for Hakkasan. I've visited twice, once for a private event and the second time for Restaurant Week. On both occasions the food and service exceeded my expectations. 

Appetizers - Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter and Stir-Fry Spicy Quail: There were four varieties of dumplings: Har Gau, Scallop Shumai, Black Pepper Duck Dumpling, and Perch Dumpling. All were delicious in their own way; though, the simple har gau with steamed shrimp wrapped in a translucent wrapper was my favorite.

As for the quail, it was nice and crispy. Plus, the spiciness was perfect. 

Main Course - Roasted Chilean Seabass With Chinese Honey and Stir-Fry Venison With Spicy Yellow Bean Sauce: The seabass was tender and flaky, and the sweet honey was a pleasant accent of flavor. 

The venison reminded me of eating Mongolian beef. I was also expecting the meat to be tenderer than it was. However, this isn't  to say it was a bad dish. 

Side Dishes (family style) -  Fried Pak Choi With Garlic, Vegetable Egg Fried Rice: Really, a meal like this wouldn't be complete without rice and a plate of greens. The pak choi was my favorite, but I thought the rice was OK. 

Dessert - Passion Fruit Panna Cotta: Sweet and tangy, it was a fun dessert to eat! Each bite I took of the panna cotta literally popped in mouth like Pop Rocks. 

Service - Hostesses and waitstaff were attentive, and our food was delivered to our table almost instantly after we were done with each of our courses. 

Overall - With excellent service and cuisine, this is one Asian restaurant on The Strip that I'll be returning to in the future.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,7,5,5,Fpf1YScY-2sG0a6FDLt98Q

Food portions are small so order maybe rice and noodles with it. 
My fiancee and I came for drinks one time and they were amazing! 
A bit on the spendy side but very worth it for food.

Atmosphere is nice and modern. Service is good, but if you want ice make sure you tell them because sometimes they just give room temp. Water.
We went with our 8 month old and server (forgot her name) was very nice.

The sweet and sour pork was so good. I mean, it really was so good. And, the tofu dish during RW was great. I usually dont like tofu. When we returned to use said GC, we ordered the S&S Pork again, as well as the snapper, duck, veggie side dish, and 2 beef dishes. The filet dish was eh. The other, a black pepper steak, was sooooo good. I liked that quite a bit.

The amazing food , to the top notch customer service, this dining/lounge/clubbing experience will not disappoint.

2 of us couples were staying in MGM, and were  looking for a nice pre-show dinner. Luckily this was only a walk through the casino for us, but even if it's not , go anyway.

Making a reservation was easy, we were sat promptly, and greeted shortly after that. Our server took our pics, suggested a few cocktails and dishes as well. 

We ordered dumplings, scallops, Chilean sea bass, fried rice, and asparagus. The portions are nice, and easy to split family style. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and well prepared. The large table next to us ordered roasted duck. They bring it out for approval before preparing; nice touch.

We loved this place so much, we came back for appetizers and drinks at the bar, the next night! Our bartender Sam was very knowledgeable and friendly, as well as Apolo the bar-back. Apolo was especially sweet, and recommended the duck salad, and we are so happy he did. This salad was delicious, and served with a generous amount of duck meat cascading over the greens. I would absolutely recommend it for an app to share, or as an entree.  

We happened to run in to the manager, Florin, while chatting at the bar. Of course we raved about our service and the restaurant thus far. He was very accommodating and social, as a manager should be. He kindly walked us to the lounge, above the restaurant, for more drinks and little dancing. What a pleasant surprise, particularly from a Vegas GM! 

I appreciated every kind gesture and delightful indulgence at Hakkasan. This is sure to be your go-to for dinner & drinks while in town!",yh25Wfh5nxW3RBCom3ueRQ,2,1,5,eAXSWrx9G2Nvf9OtMiHbsA

The restaurant is stunning!!  Beautiful decor, ambience, truly tres chic.  The service was wonderful... everyone was kind, attentive, and just great.  

The food was good.  I stop short of great.  Perhaps I had higher expectations, but some of it was just okay.  We had the duck salad - that was outstanding.  We also ordered the Jasmine Beef Short Ribs.  I really liked that too.  Very tender, flavorful. But on the flip side, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  Almost like any other bbq/teriyaki type of beef.  But it was good.  And we also ordered the Shanghai dumplings. Also tasty and good, but once again, nothing out of the ordinary.  I guess I was expecting more.  The duck salad on the other hand is a dish that isn't like something else at any other restaurant.   For our entrees, we ordered the Beef Merlot and Spicy Shrimp.  The shrimp was good.  It is not fried, it is in a curry like gravy.  It was tasty.  The beef merlot we ordered on the recommendation of many of the yelp reviews.  I wasn't really a fan of that dish.  It wasn't bad. It was tasty, but it wasn't asian fusion and it wasn't anything that I would order again.  Finally, we got the salty fish fried rice.  That was pretty good, but again, no different than something you would get at a regular Chinese restaurant.  Are you getting my drift?  To me, with prices like these and the ""style"" of restaurant, my expectations are to experience unique dishes that you can't get elsewhere.  

As for drinks, I tried the ""Chinese"" Mule... yes, Moscow mule like drink.  It had an Asian kick with ginger and something else.  It was pretty tasty. Right up my alley because I don't like the sugary sweet stuff.  But if you like the sugary stuff, do The Hakka.

The atmosphere is intimate, upscale, and modern with interesting water lighting on the far wall. I enjoyed how you could not see the rest of the restaurant except through some patterned walls.

The dishes are family-style portions, so we decided on ordering the pan-seared Shanghai dumplings, hot & sour soup, roasted chicken with satay sauce, sweet & sour pork, Hakka noodle, stir-fry French bean, and for dessert, I chose the assorted macaroons. I know that there were 2-3 other dishes that were ordered, but I can't remember what they were since I did not eat them.
I definitely enjoyed my experience at Hakkasan. I was not surprised by the price of the food since it is a fine-dining restaurant, and it is on the strip, so it is to be expected.

THE SERVICE - the staff is fantastic,they are ever-present but not hovering,very polite and approachable and are more than happy to answer any questions you might have. My favorite server is Maggie,she's waited on us a couple times before and remembers me by face - a rarity when you wait on a multitude of people. 

THE AMENITIES - everything in the place is class; they have an ice bucket in every section,so the servers can come and freshen your beverage at any time. Paper towels or hand dryers in the bathrooms? No sir,there's an attendant who hands you a warm towel to dry your hands. 

THE FOOD - oh my god. The food. If everything else in this place was sub-par,the food would still get them a 5-star rating in my book. From their starters to the custom Hakkasan cocktails they serve,everything is one of a kind. Vegetarian and gluten-free options are available on the menu as well. 

My favorite options on the menu are the crispy duck roll appetizers (well,anything duck,really) and the braised pork belly platter (literally melts in your mouth). The dim sum is superb as well,as they feature a mixed platter as part of their signature dishes which includes seafood and poultry. 

A must try,definitely.

The last few times I've visited I wanted to try a few spots that peeked my curiosity.  Hakkasan was on my ""to taste"" list, so being that there would be a good enough size group to dine with, we decided to make reservations and see what was all hubbub bub? 
First impression: beautiful and sultry. Located at the MGM (often a game changer on the strip with its constant updates) we were all dressed up and ready to indulge.
I didn't really feel comfortable snapping photos of our dishes being the only Yelper in the group and also having my phone at the table seemed a bit rude so sans photos I will do my best to list my likes and dislikes: 
I liked the dim sum platter but not as much as I loved the crispy duck salad. 
I liked the Lion's head (truffle sauced meatballs) but not as much as I loved the spicy scallops. The scallops where meaty and clean with the perfect amount of chili spice. 
Having eaten a some pretty great dim sum places in CA I felt a bit underwhelmed by what I paid for. Not bad just not better than expected. 
I like that you get free entry to the night club but I had no time to shake my buns (awww, and they are such cute buns too) anyway my group was not the club hopping type which is totally fine with me! 
I Left Hakkasan's satisfied and not overly full which was fine because we anticipated more stops on the strip that evening.

I was hoping this place would meet my expectations food-wise, but unfortunately it did not. Service and ambiance was great. But the blaring music was way too loud to talk over that it felt like I was inside the club. 

Hakka steamed dim sum- (3/5) 2pcs each of har gau, scallop shumai, Chinese dive dumpling, & black pepper duck dumpling. Well made dumplings, but not worth $29. 

Sesame prawn toast with foie gras- (5/5) the crunchiness from the buttery toast that sealed the melted juicy foie gras made the perfect sesame prawn ball. Well worth the $25. 

Crispy duck salad- (3/5) what made this salad was the pomelo and pomegranate making the duck salad lighter and fresher. But for $31, I wish the duck was the star of the dish & not the fruits. 

Chilean sea bass- (2/5) for $38 you would hope the fish would be cooked perfectly, which It Was. But unfortunately it was way too salty totally ruining the whole dish. Sadly, it was my least favorite dish and I love Chilean sea bass. They tried to be too creative with the sea bass instead of letting the flavors of the fish shine on its own.

3903915,2015-04-09,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"I write this review for the Vegas location, but I have also been to the Miami location as well, which in my opinion wasn't much better. I just don't get it. Don't get me wrong... the restaurant's interior is beautifully designed, with sleek dim blue lighting and gorgeous details such as the dividers of each section in the restaurant. But I'm sorry, what it gains in design, it lacks in taste. This has to be one of the most over-hyped, over priced restaurants I've ever dined at. And I gave it a second chance while staying in Vegas as well. Still disappointing. Moving on to the actual cuisine, if you could even call it that, I am so confused by their take on ""Cantonese"" cuisine.

 It is over-priced Chinese food. 

I can't really get into details, you will come in hungry, leave with an empty wallet and probably an empty stomach as well. Don't get the beef tenderloin ""Mongolian"" style. It was tough slices of beef with a bunch of slices of bell peppers thrown in. The hot & sour soup was okay... a little thick in my opinon. The only other thing I can remember were the shrimp dumplings which were pretty good. 

But overall, I am sadly disappointed in the food... It doesn't justify the pricey bill you will receive at the end of your experience. I really like the atmosphere in the South Beach location which is the only reason why I am giving this place 2 stars. 

Go for drinks, check out the inside of the restaurant, but seriously... save your money. 

Sorry Hakkasan :(",__pEDxwIzXiorydAFOEGaQ,0,0,2,6Rj5JTtTZpRjMwk9dqt9WA
3911378,2013-11-27,3,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Hakkasan is cray. Cray good. 

First, let's start with their cocktails. I am not a big drinker, so it was so nice and refreshing to see non-alcoholic cocktails on the menu.  The one called Eden was absolutely delicious -- rose, black grapes, lychee juice....yummmy. I think I am actually going to try to make it at home in LA myself.  I told the bartender to keep them coming (like, I said, cray. I was getting cray with the non-alcoholic cocktails, y'all).

Our dinner ended up being about 25 people, so I didn't order for myself. Someone ordered and I just ate..and ate....and ate...well, you get the picture.  The fried dim sum platter was excellent -- the duck was my favorite out of the dim sum.  Scallops in mango/chili sauce were also good, but I kept going back to the fried stuff. 

As for veggies, we only ordered the sugar snaps, and I would have liked to try something else...like the lotus root, that looked amazing.  Sugar snaps were still good if you like sugar snaps. I mean, who doesn't?

The Wagyu beef was really incredible. If you aren't used to the heavy marbleization, then it may be a bit of a shock at first, but don't worry.  You'll love it. Delish.  My favorite meat was the black pepper ribeye in merlot....so so so good. A must try.  We had other dishes that I didn't even get to try because there was so much food on the table, but everyone was raving about every single dish, so I don't think you could go wrong.

As for dessert, the coconut pudding was pretty incredible.  We kept calling it paradise in a cup.  We also had the black sesame chocolate one, which was good, but the coconut pudding was better. Loved it.

Then we went to the club for bottle service. They walked us all the way in and made sure none of us got lost. I was really happy to have a place to sit because this place is crowded.  So fun and really what Vegas is all about --- amazing food and getting cray.",Rds3cd5y083VBpo6gb9T_Q,2,1,5,QI3X4mTHbCeB3N2GGQvD9w

The food was also great. we ordered dim sum platter for appetizer, hakkasan noodle, rib eyes, duck salad for the main. Everything was ok but the portion was really small.

3970122,2014-10-12,6,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"A friend and I came here last night to have their Golden Week prix fixe menu offered during two weeks coinciding with the Golden Week in China.  Except for a service glitch, the meal was excellent!

My dining companion and I decided we'd like to try the crab and sweet corn soup as well.  This was brought first and even though we were sharing, we were not brought smaller, separate bowls so we just ate out of our communal soup bowl.  The soup was not exceptional in any way.  In fact, I tasted just like egg drop soup.  

We were not finished with this extra soup when servers brought out our small eats--the Peking duck and the steamed dim sum platter.  This was the first of two times when we were rushed by bringing out dishes when we weren't ready.  It didn't happen again when it was made clear that they should hold up on more main dishes.

The Peking duck was fantastic.  Small pieces of duck with a small amount of breast with crispy skin, a thin rectangular pancake, and some crispy cucumber.  The duck was topped by Tsar Nicoulai Reserve caviar.  The flavors of the caviar with the duck and the crispy cucumber was great.  The dim sum platter consisted of har gau, scallop shumai, a perch dumpling, and a black pepper duck dumpling.  The flavors were again wonderful!

The mains started arriving a bit too quickly and this is where we asked them to wait until we were finished with these first ones.  The three mains brought out were the braised whole sea bass in claypot, the crispy prawn, and the fried rice with diced abalone.  The crispy prawn was a spicy dish.  It had three green peppers with heat and it was served with dried chili and cashew nuts.  The sea bass was perfectly cooked and there were nice pieces of tofu with the bass.  The fried rice was very good!

After a break, we got the last two mains--spicy Szechuan rib-eye beef and the roasted crispy chicken.  The beef was a star of the meal.  The beef was in a rich sauce, not very spicy at all despite its name, and served on a bed on enoki mushrooms.  The chicken was fairly moist and the crispy skin was a delight.  The mushrooms with the chicken were wild mushrooms and the chicken was in an oyster sauce.  

For dessert, we got black sesame and chocolate dumplings with ginger/yuzu tea.  There were some small boba like lime balls on the dumplings and the dumplings were filled with a semi-sweet chocolate.  Wow!  What a way to end the meal.

We were each given a large Hakkasan bag--a takeaway gift--of two yuzu macarons with a chocolate cream filling.  They did make it home, but I ate them later.  The chocolate cream and the macarons were perfect!

This was a special meal and it's not a 5 star review for me this time because of the service.  With a meal like this, pacing should have been better and dishes not brought out before others were finished.  Our server, Leigh, was very knowledgable and very pleasant and she answered questions when we posed them.

Hakkasan remains high on my list.  It is Las Vegas Strip pricing plus, but I think it's worth the splurge now and then.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,8,4,PoLNf9BxaSHl2ExZ164r9Q

3994018,2013-06-25,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"I tried Hakkasan Vegas for the first time last Friday (6/21/13) and was a bit underwhelmed. The entrance to the restaurant is somewhat odd as it is right next to the nightclub entrance - with hoards of people lined up waiting to party, it doesn't feel very welcoming as a restaurant. When we made it inside, the hostesses were really nice. We had arrived early so we had a few drinks at the bar while we waited.

The bar is arranged pretty terribly. It is a tiny bar against the back wall probably big enough for about 10 crowded stools. Considering the number of people who probably have a drink while waiting to eat, they should have made it more spacious. The drinks, on the other hand, were a standout. We tried quite a few of the specialty cocktails and all were absolutely delicious!! (Be prepared that they are quite pricey.)

The layout of the restaurant itself is also odd. It felt like being inside of a bento box! Sets of a few tables were cordoned off with high walls so that you felt like you were walking through a maze to get to your table. I'm sure they did it to give it an intimate feel, but it took away from the high-energy club feel which I actually went there hoping for.

The food was pretty good - I give it a solid three stars. Had I not known the chef who started it had a Michelin star at his other place, I would have been pleasantly surprised by how good it was and probably given four stars. However, I went in hoping for food that was more innovative and special. Still, everything was tasty and we were really happy! We sampled 9 items from the menu (plus dessert), and the crispy duck salad appetizer was my absolute favorite.

I enjoyed it, but wouldn't be the one to suggest going back.",C2RTNSaPYu_TKvpHxN41YQ,1,0,3,hkSua8ZtOlm4WGvfmXKaNQ

In all seriousness, this was a very special night for a very special guy.  My high maintenance bougie sisters were present and Hakkasan performed..respect

Service: 5/5  We started at the bar as we waited for the crew to arrive and the mixologist bartenders were on point with friendliness and their skill sets. Once seated, the head waiter and the team took care of us throughout our hour+ dining experience.  We ordered family style and every 10-15 minutes we had multiple dishes coming out to enjoy.  Waters and drinks were kept fresh between the food rounds and during the food rounds for the power drinkers.  The flow of the food was perfect and the staff moved with a sense of urgency with friendliness.

Food: 4.5/5   The food presentation was so so pretty, but the quality and taste exceeded the expectations as well.   We ordered a lot, almost too much but I'll let the pics speak for themselves and I'll just comment on my favorites below.  
Hot & Sour Soup with Chicken: I can't believe I'm writing about soup, but yes it was great.  The thinly shredded chicken paired with the boutique soup makes this the Hot & Sour GOAT. 
Hakka Noodle: I'm a noodle guy and the mushrooms really brought this home.
Hakka Steamed Dim Sum platter: Har gau, scallop shumair, chinese chive dumpling and the black pepper duck dumpling came out looking pretty and were tasty.  The duck was my fav.
Hakka Fried dim sum platter: The roasted duck pumpkin puff was my fav,  duck pattern? =)
Spicy Lamb Lupin Wraps: I love lamb and these wraps were great.  Lamb fans get it!  
Crispy Duck Salad: Fresh salad and the duck complimenting each other hard.
Black Truffle Roast Duck:The VIP dish of the mf evening.  I love just about Truffle anything, but it can be overpowering if not paired AND prepped correctly.  It was awesome with the roast duck, writing about it now is bringing back good memories.  Highly, highly recommended.

Value: 4/5 I understand that premium prices are coming with a premium restaurant in a premium location on the Las Vegas strip.  For the service and quality of the food and drinks, Hakkasan meets my expectation.

Ambiance:  5/5 Here's one of my favorite reasons for visiting Hakkasan restaurant.  The Neo-contemporary Asian influenced design is classy and exudes sex appeal.  It looks like a straight movie scene from the Matrix.  EDM music plays in the background.  For our table, the lighting is dim with spotlights on the table to showcase the food.  This keeps the dining experience very intimate and drops inhibitions as the drinks come.  hehe =)

This is one of my favorite ""special occasion"" restaurants on the Strip.  Hakkasan has their own valet service so right from the beginning until the end you're enjoying the VIP experience.  The food, service and the ambiance puts together a great start for a special evening.  I highly recommended it for first dates and group dining for special occasions.  You leave here feeling baller af into the next venue for the evening.

We sat at a table near the bar, where we could admire their extensive collection of spirits. Blaze, our server was so on point and we appreciated the fact that they were so careful to accommodate food allergies.

My favorite was the vegetarian dim sum...so savory and delicious! If you order the prefix menu, please be prepared to eat for 10 people. The portions were so generous.

4084529,2017-09-09,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"this place is a must try whether you're local or in town. i don't know of any other place that does chinese fine dining cuisine, especially to their extent. 
when you walk in, you're automatically greeted by one of the hosts. everything from the decor to the ambience is exquisite. they pay attention to the details and it certainly pays off well. it has a romantic vibe with the low lighting and the way they set up the tables so perfectly. perfect for celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, or just feeling fancy for date night. 

i've been here three times. the most recent being on sept 5 to celebrate my birthday with a romantic date with my boyfriend. the amount of workers wishing me a happy birthday from the hosts, to servers, to manager was pretty epic having them remembered what we were celebrating. 

SERVICE: 120/100 
our server for the night was the lovely Lisa. she was so kind all throughout the night and checked up on us pretty often to make sure everything was excellent, and our needs were met even when she was working a handful of other tables with bigger parties. she managed to pull through especially while pregnant. you go girl!! i see how they run things from previous visits, so i love how for her, she asks first if she can mix our salad to plating our fried rice for us. she served us a non alcohol beverage, it was called virgin mimosa or cocktail, on the house. it was absolutely delicious. i had another guy serve me a glass of champagne on the house as well, both in celebration of the night. they really take care of their customers here. after each course, the busser ( forgot his name ) would clear out our table right away and Lisa would clean up the table before bringing us new plates for our next meal. the busser would refill our waters before we even reach the bottom of our glass; excellent. they know customer service and i applaud them to taking care of us beyond our expectations.

FOOD: 95/100
i didn't know you could make chinese food fancy, but they sure blew me away. 
Appetizer: we ordered the crispy duck salad as we always do. this is a must have dish. it is so delicious, i could eat 5 servings of it. i would come back just for this dish. the duck is crisp to perfection, and is served with pomelo, pomegranate and pine nut as well to give it that sweetness to it. 
Entrees: we ordered the crispy roasted duck with kumquat. i'll rate this a 7 out of 10. the duck was delicious but a bit bland. it could be better with a homemade sauce either on top or even on the side. 
we asked for hoisin and soy sauce, and of course, Lisa went above and beyond and also brought us chili even when we first initially said no. the duck dipped with either sauce and then the chili made it more delish. the bit of chili gave it the kick it needed. 
we also ordered the stir-fry black pepper beef ribeye with merlot. i'll rate this a 10 out of 10 from the presentation to the taste. it was one of the best entree dishes i've tried. the meat was so tender and juicy. the sauce, very yummy, brought the dish together. 
our last entree was their chicken and salted fish fried rice. we've tried this dish before, but my boyfriend doesn't really like fish, so they cut that out for us this time and brought us chicken fried rice. i'll rate this a 9/10. i'm picky with my rice. i don't like it being dry or too soft. they cooked it just the right amount of stickiness. there's not as much kick of flavor without the fish, but adding a bit of soy sauce works well. 
Dessert: for dessert, we had their homemade selection of ice cream; a scoop of vanilla, chocolate, and hazelnut. this gets a 20/10. their presentation is always on point. for anyone who's eaten the amount of ice cream i have, you can tell how good the quality of the ice cream is. their vanilla and hazelnut ice cream is to die for. i wish they had an option of buying a gallon to take home. it's that amazinggg.

Hostess: Very nice
Bartender: Very nice and recommended a few drinks for us while waiting for our table.
SERVER: 1star; Jacob gave us horrible service for upscale restaurant.

The food was below average. Our server had no personality and treated us differently comparing to other 3 tables that he had; he treated us as if he didn't want to serve us...as if we are not going to tip him or something. Despite this bad experience, we still tipped him 18%. We've said ""Thank you"" so many times but our server Jacob didn't even bother saying ""You're welcome"" or smile once throughout our time there.

I've also informed them to do something special for our anniversay; I've requested to write ""happy anniversary"" on our dessert plate.

The hostess said happy anniversary to us when we came in and when we left. However, our server didn't mention anything about it but i let it go. I'm really upset that they didn't fulfill my anniversary request. we ordered a dessert and it just came out without the writing. I was really looking forward for this to end our night.

I'm also a server and I've been serving for so many years. My boyfriend also waited tables and we know a bad service when we see one.

4151005,2013-09-20,1,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Again, an amazing dinner! 

We've dinned here last may and a few days ago. Both experiences met our expectations.

The great service starts at the moment your reservation is made. Not only asking for the occassion, but also inquiring for any special preferences and allergies.

I can't remember what we ate last may, so I'll focus on the last visit (this week). From last may I only remember that my love had something with duck (of course, he always does) and we had a nice Viognier. And, the server accidentally brought us a wrong dish. Not knowing what we could expect we started eating thinking it was the right dish. The waitress noticed it and made sure we also had the dish we ordered. Quickly. And the wrongly served dish was not charged. Nice way to make up for mistakes.

So, this week, party of three. We decided to share 2 appetizers, take 3 entrees and a side dish. But, between deciding that and determining what to take.......Pff..The Hakkasan has a very extensive menu and we had different wishes (yes/no to fish, yes/no bones) and my culinary English is (I think) pretty good but there parts of the menu that weren't completely clear like har gau. But this was no problem for the waitress, she took al the time to help me enhance my vocabulary. Finally we orderded the short ribs and the dim sum as appetizers. Bot excellent. The only thing that can be remarked is that the staff takes the meat from the bone at the table. That didn't look very professionel. They should start with given the waitresses a little bit more of practice and a sharper knife (the lady used standerd, not very sharp cutlery). I really feared that it whould end up on my dress..........

We had the Pipa Duck, the Shanghai lamb tenderloin and the beef with Merlot as entrees and the Udon Noodles with duck as a side. All entrees were excellent. Nicely presented and a normal portion. Only the pipa was not that much. We all agreed that we liked the beef with Merlot most of all. very tender meat, nicely seasoned. The pipa duck was as remarked, a very small portion. Excellent flavours, but because it resembles Peking Duck so much I think we will not order that again. The Shangai lamb was also good, altough some peoplie might think it's a little hot. One member of the party suggested a Pinot Grigio as a wine to start with. We ended up choosing one from Italy and drinking this with the entire meal.

We skipped desserts, because I remembed from last may that once you eaten real European style macarons (La Duree....to die for) American's macarons just don't match up. Not chewy enough, not enough 'macaron-blood' in their veins ;). So we just ordered coffee (and a cointreau). This was the only dissapointment of the evening. Don't order coffee. My love send his cappucino back the first time and yes, it was better the second time around, but not what you'll expect after the amazing dishes. Same thing applied for the lattes.

Sure, this luxery doesn't come cheap. But I rather pay a little bit more for a nice ambience, good service and excellent food than just fill my stomach. And if you're a little aware of the prices you can have an excellent dinner for an fair price. We ended up with a check of $330 (including gratuity) for 3 persons. Not too bad.

4175445,2014-03-12,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Went here for restaurant week.  It was a great thing I knew about it because the waiter was not going to tell my party about it otherwise.  The restaurant week deal was amazing- you spend $50 per person to each get a choice of appetizer, choice of entrée, share side dishes and get their offered dessert.  Of the $50 you spend per person $6 of that goes to charity to help local food banks.  At the end of the meal we each received a $50 gift card to go back!!!  I mean can you get a better deal then that???  I hate to say this but Tao's food is way better from what I can tell, but the drinks here were divine.  One of us ordered a negroni drink that was basically a show of fire and ice and smoke or something wild.  My girlfriend's and I loved the strawberry basil martini and lycheetini!  I tried the dim sum- can't go wrong there pretty much, and the Chilean sea bass.  The Chilean sea bass was overcooked and my spoiled @ss has had Chilean sea bass everywhere and neeever had that complaint.  So that was weird because I expected a lot from Hakkasan.  The dessert was pretty neat- not something my boyfriend or I would normally have ordered because it was fruity and not chocolately but it was absolutely a work of art in a glass with perfectly severed citrus fruits and something like green apple pop rocks.  It was a dessert worth a try and very neat but unfortunately the tart dessert is more of a palatte cleanser then a dessert to me.  I will be going back soon to use my gift card to try other items on the menu and see if I choose other foods if it can be better then Tao restaurant, but so far only the drinks are better.  I want to note that I normally don't drink alcohol and Hakkasan has a non-alcohol drink menu I should have tried, but dammit those alcohol drinks were so good and got me to have my first drink of 2014.",vepRbwKOq3KuN7VSB3PEcA,0,0,4,w18yi8xbhJPwH_6eWV_2lg

Please come here for dinner with a reservation if you would like to be treated like shit by both staff and management. In a town with hundreds of restaurants competing for business you would think they would consider customer service an important part of the customer experience. Especially since they are new here. We arrived this past Sunday evening at 9:32 PM for our 9:15 reservation for two people. Yes, we were late by 17 minutes. 
Hostess: Can I help you?
Me: Yes, reservation for David.
Hostess: What time?
Me: 9:15
Hostess: This reservation was cancelled after 15 minutes because you did not arrive on time. 
Me: OK, can we be seated still?
Hostess: I don't have anything. Just a moment.
At this point my wife says to me ""let's go"".  I take a walk back into the restaurant and see that about 25% of the tables are empty. This is a Sunday night at 9:30PM.  I come back and the hostess ignores me. I tell my wife that the hostess is a bitch and we should probably just go. We leave. 
As we enter the MGM casino a man starts yelling my name out loud. He chases us down and says he's the manager and asks why I called his hostess a bitch. Instead of being concerned that we are leaving without ever experiencing their restaurant he takes my private conversation with my wife and accuses me of calling their hostess a bitch. I would never do that and told him so. He continued to ask why I bothered his hostess. Very unprofessional, very harassing, we walked away and told him we were treated poorly and would be sharing our experience on YELP!  My wife's first intuition was to leave. I thought we would give them a chance to seat us but I was wrong. As usual my wife was correct.",g1gdLCrfKUkYwlW5j7baog,31,4,1,lagyqe3GswQiC3GXRl1ijA

They have people in front before you go in that ask how they can help you but fail to inform you that you must make reservations and allow you to go in to the restaurant where you're then greeted by a hostess who turns you away. So the next night I called and was told no need to make reservations there was plenty of tables. We get there maybe 10 minutes later and were greeted and then told the restaurant was committed to reservations that night and there was no seating. You've got to be kidding me right?! I explained I had just called and was told there was tables. She shrugged and said sorry and try later. Horrible horrible service for Vegas.

Once my group of six arrived, we went up to the hostess earlier than our scheduled reservation. Unfortunately, we were not seated until almost an hour after while we had to wait for a table along with other groups who had arrived on time as well. You may get a free drink at the bar if they know your waiting but other than that you are waiting in a small space with no chairs where all the workers are scurrying through. Once you are seated it is very hard to get someone to recognize you're there. At least three times did someone from our table have to retrieve the server. We all ordered the pre-fixed menu and if you want to take the dessert home forget it. They said it's specially made and cannot fit in a take out box. What that means I do not know. The food is very good just not worth their prices but it is Las Vegas. We had tickets to see Tiesto that night and you do not have to wait in line if you're coming from dinner. However, The servers and hosts are not on the same page about who exactly takes the group to the club area making you go back and forth.

Staff is very polite & helpful when asking questions about the menu. So this is my first experience of what I call fine dining and first experience of a Michelin star restaurant.

We arrived at the restaurant at 8pm. 8.01pm we were seated, and given the wine menu at 8.02pm we had bottled water, and by 8.05 we had our wine, tasted and poured in both glasses!
So about the wine and water, we never had to pour any into our glasses, there was always a waiter around to do this for us. Top service.

The food is only what I can class as the best I have ever had, starter, main and deserts all highly rated. I recommend the mango\duck starter and sea bass cooked in honey for the main. The wait between courses were minimal. Even though we only had a table for 2 hours, it didnt seem rushed to put away a bottle of red and 3 courses.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, warm and welcoming, as soon as you walk in you are greeted and asked for your coat and then escorted to your table. There is an ambient lighting. The tables are quite close to each other, which is always an issue to me especially when having private conversations, however on a Saturday night because the atmosphere and noise levels its not much of a problem.

Its not crazy expensive, but for me its not cheap. You could easily blow what we spent on good food on a night out, so its worth a visit if you have a special occasion.

The bamboo shoot chicken soup and the rod was the best, albeit everything was served cold and all the  food wasn't served at the same time. I think it should have been $50 per person. the dessert was horrible, it was sesame ice cream with chocolate cookie, the ice cream tasted like nothing and the cookie tasted bitter.y vegetarians friends got a fruit plate and that was def more enjoyable than or fancy dessert. again, the food was decent, just too bad they were served cold!

The service, food, and ambiance is really spectacular in the restaurant.  I have never been to a more perfect date place.  Very intimate and all the food comes out perfectly portioned for two to share.  The waiters were very professional and assisted us with ordering some phenominal dishes.  The veggie dumplings and the veggie assorted platter were perfect starters and then we got noodles and my date got a meat dish which was cooked well, and I got the sweet and sour veggies which were also spectacular.  To round out we got the PB&J which was great and new to my pallet in the way it was put together.  Highly recommended.  Its not too big so don't worry if you are full.  The drinks were tasty as well, we got one signature cocktail each.  The only quip I have (which i wouldn't even fault them for at all) was that the two appetizers came out back to back without any break inbetween.

4389267,2017-07-18,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"First the good, the food was delicious. Everyone at our table enjoyed the summer menu, which is a prix fixe menu that also includes a cocktail. No complaints here, the duck salad and dim sum were worth the visit. The salad was the overall table favorite. The entrees were balanced and had great flavor. My future Son-in-law who apparently hates green beans annihilated their stir-fried green beans, and is currently reconsidering his hatred, so that's a win! Dessert was delish and the cocktails were strong.

Soooo...the not so good. When we arrived and were perusing the menu the bus person overheard us and let us know that everything listed was included with the summer menu. (Which, by the way, the busser was about 1000x's more personable than our server) Well...when we ordered our server indicated that was not the case and that we could make one selection from each category. But that he ""would check"" to see if that was the case?? Now normally I wouldn't balk at this kind of thing. However,  when your getting ready to drop a CAR PAYMENT on dinner I feel like you can do a sister a solid and go ahead and throw in a cup and 1/2 of pork and some veggies, I mean really. Not to mention, the server should know without having to double-check. Well, we ended up getting everything, and it would have felt pretty chintzy had we not. 

The worst...as dinner was winding down, I ordered a second cocktail. I waited through the entrees, AND dessert, AND had to ask again, then completed dessert, and was getting really annoyed. I decided at that point I wasn't going to receive the drink but also was not going to pay for it!! Our server was MIA. Finally it arrives when we were pretty much ready to leave. I normally do not let these things get to me, and would remain pretty zen about it. However, at this price point I expect service to be spot on. When the cocktails cost more than MANY people make in an hour, I don't find it unreasonable to expect it to arrive in a timely manner and/or to be comped or at least an apology if was completely forgotten. None of those things happened  

If this were Applebees I would probably just shrug and say ""oh well"". But, like I said at this price point your paying for not only the food but the experience and ours was so-so.",BeRz_pTrsSEqKQsJ12X4VQ,2,0,3,FFQPUVIo1LCFf9Z4-iKTXQ

I ordered the Chilean Seabass with Honey and this time around it was mediocre.. I mean before it was nicely presented on a nicer place and the outer layer of the Sea bass was darker and richer is color.. This time it was lighter in color and tasted a bit overwhelming with oil..

I also ordered the Fried Rice (this was a hit).. I ordered the Vegetable Dumplings and this was saturated with oil as well.. to the point where you couldn't use your chopsticks to pick it up.. 

The ambience inside is amazing, the staff is young and need some more training on how to deal with customers. especially in the front (hosts)

Now the Dress attire or uniforms that the employees wear are not nice at all.. Every girl has the same red dress and I don't know who thought of it, but you want to pick a piece that can compliment each girl. Having one bright red dress that is skin tight will not work at all, and on top of that he girls wear flats (I mean this is Hakkasan, not your local diner) . Men's uniform is basic (all black).. 

Here is my issue with this place .. I wore name brand high end clothing with a ball cap and was told to take it off, I refused.. I ate anyways, they just let anyone in with shorts or a basic tee so with me wearing a hat that goes with my clothing is far superb over anyone else there.. 

I had a Asian manager last night (he was there around 10pm on 2-10-18, talking to Fergie DJ) trying to take a picture of me when I looked up he stopped.. I guess because of my hat.

Not cool.. who does this.. 

Overall the experience was good because it was my friends birthday but the dinner fell way under.. I come from a culinary background and live in LA and know how (fine dining food taste). 

The employees at this place meaning uniform does not match the quality of decor here or match up to the service that is expected when entering this type of establishment.

The flavor is there, but the techniques feel very Americanized. The portion/dish sizes are also very small for the price you pay. Depending on your party size and appetite, you could be looking at 1.5-2 dishes per person.

The menu is inspired by Cantonese and Szechuan cuisines, but feels more fusion than anything else. Don't get me wrong; you'll find some legit dishes here. But most of them have been adjusted for the American palette.

The husband took me on a date for my birthday dinner and let me just say the look and feel of the place is beautiful (even the restrooms will make you fall in love).

The ambience,food and service are all top notch.
Our server however wasn't that proficient he was polite and courteous but couldn't give us any recommendations.
The sommelier on the other hand was wonderful and had some excellent recommendations.She also asked me what kind of wine i preferred and the whole ordeal (the kind you expect at any fancy restaurant).

The food was great and every course came out looking like a work of art.
Definitely try the dimsums and the crispy prawn dumplings.
Something tells me i'm going to frequent this place more often.
Another big plus,if you have a reservation at the restaurant you can skip the whole line and someone will escort you to the entrance of the club (tiesto was playing that night so it was manic) and i couldn't be more glad that we had a table.

A big shout out to the Husband and Hakkasan.

4569475,2017-07-20,2,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"I love the ambiance and vibe at Hakkasan restaurant. It screams trendy and sexy. My group of five had dinner reservations and ran a little late due to the long walk from the casino lobby to the restaurant but they were very accommodating regardless. I noted that the restaurant was completely filled as this was a Saturday night dining experience. It was our first time dining here and the food was exceptional. We ordered the vegetarian dim sum platter and the regular dim sum platter for starters. The roasted Chilean seabass with Chinese honey was absolutely the best seabass dish we've ever had! 

The Hakka cocktail along with the fine selections of Japanese whiskey made for a great dining experience. The Japanese whiskey flights are a must if you want a sampling of the great ones that are hard to find in the retail consumer market. I recommend the ""Here to Stay"" consisting of Nikka Taketsuru, Hibiki Harmony, Yamazaki 12yr, Hakushu 12yr but if you can, splurge for the ""Elevated Experience"".  The desserts are a must since you cannot find these anywhere else.  We had the Caramel Passion and the Black Sesame and Chocolate Dumplings. You can skip the dumplings for dessert - the flavor was a little too weird for our group. 

Service was exceptional, from the hostess to the waiter as there no lag in waiting from time of ordering our food to delivery.  The cocktails seemed to take a little longer but expected since they're hand crafted.

It's in the mgm hotel through a door off the casino. Once you enter, there's a little lobby/hostess area and then you a brought into the restaurant resembling a maze. We sat in the middle of two larger parties, which was a bit odd when it was pretty empty through the restaurant. 

We ordered the dim sum platter to start as well as the chilled eggplant special. The eggplant was a bit mushy, but flavor was good. The dim sum was so hot (temperature wise) that we burned our mouths but that's our own fault for not waiting longer to eat them!! We then split the hakkasan noodles, chicken in a mango sauce and spicy prawns in a curry sauce. The chicken was cooked very well and stayed crisp on the outside but moist on the inside. The prawns weren't very flavorful and were pretty boring. The curry sauce was light and the prawns tasted like they were just steamed/boiled with no seasoning. The noodles were good, but nothing to write home about. The waiter definitely told us to order too many dishes. We easily could have gotten by with only the chicken or the prawns. 

The service was somewhat odd. The initial waiter serving us never told us his name, came over after 10 min of us sitting and just asked if we had questions/wanted to order. It felt pretty rude. Then after we did order, a different waiter came up to us asking if we were ready to order (in a much more pleasant tone). We were pretty confused, but assumed the waiters were going off/on shifts. The rest of the dinner had better service with the second waiter. 

All in all, had weird service and average food for a higher price than it was worth.",-A6ENKeDFHJfo9JEXRTh6w,0,0,3,kRuzJ--kTj4ieGfYWPaYMw

Amazing :
Crab & Corn soup - depth of flavours was great.
Crispy Duck Salad - unexpalainable.  You have to order it to get it.
Hakka Noodle - simple but so good.
Silver Cod - champagne & Chinese honey.  Really melts in your mouth.

Very Good :
Hot & Sour soup - best hot & sour soup ever
Sea Bass with Chinese honey
Rib Eye with Merlot - taste very good but I expected more.
Crispy quail

Average :
Dim Sum platter
Spicy Prawns - it was not what I expected as this is a green curry dish.
Chicken & Salted fish fried rice
Panna Cotta - sour but you can't stop eating

I planned this trip to Vegas after knowing I would be proposing to my man at Nobu in NYC. 
It was my fiance's first time in Vegas so I wanted him to have an exceptional experience. He happens to be a Steve Aoki fan so what are the odds that Steve Aoki would be having a party at Hakassan nightclub? The odds were definitely in our favor because he was. I wanted to make his first experience to Vegas a memorable one so I immediately went to work booking restaurants and excursions that I knew he would love. I can honestly say that the Best of the Best for him was Hakassan Restaurant and the Nightclub....he's still talking about it. The restaurant was as upscale as upscale can be. The food was pricey but pricey is not a problem especially when the food is excellent. Everything we ordered from the appetizers up was 5star.

The décor inside is interesting.. very modern Asian if that makes sense.  You will pay more for Asian food than anywhere else.. but it is Asian fusion.  Service is good.

A few things that we got and split:
- Duck Salad:  Asians don't really eat salad but this was delicious... highly recommend
- Spicy Scallops:  Also delicious.. highly recommend.
- Lions Head:  It's not lion's meat.. that's what my silly friend thought.  It is a meatball with some truffle sauce.  It was not that delicious and clearly was left behind.  Sad story.
- Pan Fried Udon Noodles:  Meh... I wouldn't go with this either.  

I was told all duck things are quite delicious.  Portions are small as you would expect from a high end restaurant.  I would go again.. but maybe narrow down on what I would get.  Seems like the pure protein dishes were best.

4744367,2013-12-31,2,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"I've been to other Asian restaurants on the strip, and they have one or more of the following issues: low quality food, sad excuses for portions, and/or overpriced dishes.  It's odd to say, but fortunately Hakkasan only suffers from that third one.

The interior is really one gigantic space, but seems like a big labyrinth with multiple rooms and halls due to the tall partitions set up throughout.  There are many dining tables and a bar tucked away in the back.  Some drinks were creative, others were easily available elsewhere, but they'll all run you $15-$20 each.

The menu has many appetizers, sides, and entrees to choose from, as well as a few tasting menus available, which require four people in your party to order.  For a party of six, we ordered four tasting menus and a few other dishes to round out our meal.  For a set menu that is meant for four, it comes with a surprising amount of food that easily filled up the six of us.  Nothing was disappointing, but the standouts for me were the crispy duck salad (they do not skimp on the portions here, if you enjoy duck, get this dish), duck with truffle oil (again, good portions), and the wagyu beef stir fry.

The food was well prepared, in generous portions, and left all of us feeling satisfied.  The part that makes Hakkasan hard to recommend is the pricing.  The tasting menu we ordered was $118 per person, and most dishes are $30 each.  Total for our meal was over $1,000, which is ridiculous for six people eating Chinese food.  Fortunately, and the main reason we came, we were able to enjoy a promotion that got us 50% off our entire bill.  In the end it was around $80 per person, which is much more reasonable, but arguably still a lot.

The pricing at Hakkasan makes it hard place to wholeheartedly recommend, but unlike other Asian restaurants on the Strip you'll actually end up with a good meal if you decide to spend the money here.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,9,2,3,OTClJ1-EgjH24i0oNORzmA

Though the restaurant is pretty sizable (it takes up the whole lower floor under the club), they break up the dining areas using wooden screens, creating a bunch of semiprivate mini dining rooms. 

The variety of dishes was awesome, starting with vegetarian dim sum and Shanghai pan fried dumplings, followed by baby book choy in a delicate sauce, a dish with a variety of mushrooms, black pepper ""chicken,"" a noodle dish, and a tofu/Japanese eggplant dish. 

Our favorites were the dim sum (because vegetarians rarely get to enjoy this sort of thing - if they can add some veggie soup dumplings I'd be in heaven), the black pepper chicken (so much flavor and amazing texture on the chicken), and the tofu/eggplant dish. The tofu in the latter had a lovely fried/chewy texture on the outside but was creamy and fresh in the middle - probably some of the best tofu we've ever eaten. 

The service was professional and really unobtrusive. They would refill water and take away dishes immediately without seeming like they were hovering at all. In short, we had an amazing time enjoying this meal. If I ate the meal every day, I'd probably make some tweaks to the dim sum fillings, to add variety and reduce the sense of too many mushrooms in the dish, but heck, that's a small criticism.",WQ96Yu_71GuBzzDhuharHQ,5,3,5,w94yM6KP_ipw_LDqphCt2Q

The wife's Smoky Negroni, while pricey at $18, was well made with top shelf ingredients (barrel aged Ransom Old Tom gin, Carpano Antica vermouth, Campari, and Grand Marnier all infused with smoke in a decanter) and possessed the expected traits of the classic original with bold, but pleasant smoky notes.  My Manhattan ($17) made with Bulleit Rye, Carpano Antica, atomized Oloroso sherry, and Angostura bitters was no less successful possessing nice nutty notes on the nose from the sherry.  Sadly, Hakkasan's cocktails were the highlight of our night. 

Rather than pick items from the dinner menu, we decided to leave it in Hakkasan's hands and ordered its $88 Signature Tasting Menu figuring it would be a well thought out sampling of its signature items.  Our meal started off with the Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter consisting of har gau, scallop shumai, perch dumplings, and black pepper duck dumplings.  The selection of dim sum was beautifully presented, flavorful, but not much different and certainly no better than what you can find being pushed on a cart in a traditional Chinese restaurant.  With the exception of the Roasted Mala Chicken with Cucumber and Cloud Ear Mushrooms, the Stir-fry Asparagus with Dried Shrimp and Preserved Vegetables and the desserts, the remaining dishes we were served were surprisingly one note in their preparation and/or flavor profiles as they were either fried (Salt and Pepper Squid, Crispy Silver Cod with Superior Soy Sauce, Crispy fried Red Snapper) or topped with a sweet and sour style sauce (Sweet and Sour Pork with Pomegranate) or a combination of both.  Taken as a whole, the tasting menu was inexplicably strange and disappointing.  Nothing tasted off or bad and it all seemed properly prepared, but the food was not appreciably better than what you could get at PF Chang's or your neighborhood Chinese take-out joint and the food definitely never came close to meriting its $88/person price tag. 

The only things that saved this from being a one-star review were the solid (albeit pricey) cocktails and the attentive service we received throughout our meal.  However, for an acclaimed restaurant brand and a Michelin-starred chef, Hakkasan and its tasting menu was easily the most disappointing and worst value meal I've ever experienced.

My friends and I sampled a few of their best menu items and the must-order was the Crispy Duck Salad it was so delicious. In fact, remembering it right now is making my mouth water. Another one of their best dishes would be the Mongolian Style Beef Tenderloin. It just melts in your mouth! Not to mention their mouth-watering cocktails of which we had The Hakka, their signature drink with coconut, passion fruit and lychee juice. Green Destiny was a very fresh cocktail with cucumber, kiwi, and apple juice and Agave No. 8 a tequila cocktail with orange, lime, and cinnamon. 

We finished off our meal with two desserts 'PB&J' which is a peanut butter parfait. It was a five-star upgrade of any peanut butter delicacy that you have had in your life. It had sour cherry jam, banana & passion fruit sorbet. What an explosion of flavors!! We also had the Exotic Fruit Platter. The plate presentation was a work of art. Too bad I was too busy eating to take pictures!!

Big thanks go to our server Jen who knew the menu inside and out and described everything intricately. Every other server who came to our table was very knowledgeable as well.

Fine enough but the Killer was that the GM was outright rude and insulting to my guests because...of a balloon hat given to the birthday boy!!!  He came over and berated us.

- $50.14 for 4-course dinner of great food at a swanky Strip eatery was a steal.
- $12 for Ketel One & seltzer was cheaper than I expected (at Hakkasan Nightclub a small bottle of Fiji water is $9).  No problem also getting free ice water (I've read on Yelp that the Nightclub bartenders won't get out free ice water).
- Last time for dinner reservations is 11:15 pm but I called too late (about 7 pm?) to book any reservation in the dining room.  I was able to do a walk-in, grab a seat at the bar and eat there.  My bartender Krista (Christa?) was really cool. 
- About 9:50 pm I had entered Hakkasan Nightclub so I could get my club stamps and have a look before using the elevator to go down to the restaurant.  After dinner (about 12:10 pm) I walked up 2 flights of stairs and entered the Ling Ling Lounge (sit anywhere you want, no bottle service mandatory).   From there I had to show my club stamps to the bouncer to continue to the Ling Ling Club and finally to the Hakkasan Nightclub.
- Bonus: Upon paying my dinner/bar tab I received a ""$50 Hakkasan Gift Voucher...Thank you for dining with us during Las Vegas Restaurant Week.""  I was flabbergasted that the meal was only $50.14 and I got a $50 ""gift voucher valid until April 10, 2014.""  I almost felt guilty accepting it.

Unfortunately combine it's Michelin one star status in London with the typical markup on anything Asian on the Strip, the prices will make you ask if they are taking the piss and leave you gobsmacked. (OK enough British slang).

Not your neighborhood Chinese.  You won't find sweet sour here.  Dishes are individual courses.  Some are meant to be shared, others not.  

On this evening, without looking at the menu, asked the server to just bring our party, some of the best dishes.  The result:

Crispy duck salad.  Incredible balance.  The richness of the duck balanced by the bitterness and acidity of pomolo, earthiness of pine nuts and texture from pomegranate seeds.  

Braised abalone with black truffles.  Soft, tender, impregnated by the sweetness of Chinese wine, the earthy flavor of the truffle the aroma enhances the sweetness of the abalone.  

Peking duck with caviar.  Not the classic Peking duck (this one has some breast meat attached) but wow, soft pancake, pungent scallion and snappy cucumber, crisp duck skin and to top it off, caviar whose oceanic flavor adds an incredible, unexpected complexity. 

A delicate, crisp quail with Chinese five spice and chili sauce, a perfectly roasted Chilean sea bass with Chinese honey whose sweet but bitter notes brings out the natural flavor of the fish, an nontraditional fried and steamed dim sum platter whose freshness, taste, and quality, will put all but the best to shame rounded out the meal.

Service is very efficient and friendly.  The wine list, well chosen.  Typical Vegas resort prices. 

So, $245 for Peking duck, $188 per order of abalone, worth it?  Elevated to this level, bloody well right.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,22,23,4,OmgrPDFt6pAEJw4AoQvrNQ

I was with a group of 5 girls. Chinese girls. That being said, the food was good, but definitely overpriced Asian food. Coming from NY, the melting pot of cultures and food, I'm able to get any Asian cuisine I want for a fraction of the cost it was sold at Hakkasan. 

We had the soft shell crab salad app which was actually very delicious and a meat app which I forgot. All the apps were very tasty, but our main dishes were slightly disappointing. I got the crispy duck and my friends got the sea bass and prawns with taro. The duck was good, but nothing different than anything I've had in Chinatown for a quarter of the price. The sea bass was bland and the ""prawns"" were medium sized shrimp that was overcooked. I guess it's hard to appreciate fancy Chinese food when you know it's not worth the cost. The flavors weren't bad, but I wouldn't pay that amount for bougie Chinese food again. 

Our food also came out at extremely different times. My two friends who ordered the sea bass got their food almost 30 mins after our main dishes came out. We were done eating and still waiting for theirs to come out. The manager apologized and gave us all free shots and a shared dessert, which was an ice gesture, but not worth the stress since we were in a hurry to get to the concert.",qJybQyJPf2OCnU0kH1DaDQ,4,0,3,R_DGVKcIY7Tt5a55SFIYcg

Derek could not have been more welcoming and even arranged my VIP entrance to the Hakkusan Night Club the ending before.

The Las Vegas location is truly on a grand scale. A maze of intimate dinning areas, all with carved see through dark wood panels. The requisite blue lighting cast a hypnoizing hue for each table. The long electric blue bar was equally spectacular with background of cascading lights, further illuminated with bright gold hanging lamps.

Service, of course, is top shelf as to be expected. The staff from the lovely host, to the mixologist, and even the restroom attendant are completely attentive. Derek, the GM, was kind enough to visit with me several times to insure my visit was a five Yelp star experience. 

I ordered the simple plates of Shanghai pan-seared pork dumplings, baby bok choy with oyster sauce, and the fried rice. 

The rice was outstanding. Consisting of Eggs and scallions mixed with fluffy rice, it was like a letter from Hong Kong.  A perfect home style meal.

I indulged a fabulous desert of Carmel passion. A beautiful presentation of passion fruit tapioca, chocolate crémeux, and honey ice cream. Incredible!

5244434,2014-08-05,1,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Words cannot describe how much the BF and I love the Hakkasan restaurants.  We were amazed by the Miami location, so we knew we had to try the Las Vegas location.  We planned to go to the Hakkasan Nightclub that evening, so it was perfect.  The restaurant and club is located in the back of the MGM Grand Hotel.  The signs made us walk through the entire casino, but you can just walk straight back and miss the twists and turns. 

The ambience and decor, like the Miami location, was beautiful and trendy, but it was way busier than I anticipated for a Thursday evening at 11pm. But hey, that's Vegas I guess!  Our server Carmen was a gem - she had a great presence and engaged with us throughout the entire experience.  

For starters we got the Crispy Duck Salad (which we had in Miami) and Seared Scallop with Fresh Mango in Chili Sauce.  The duck salad was of course amazing, with pomelo and pomegranate.  It is so fresh tasting but at the same time heaping with duck meat and crispy skin!  The scallops were good, but my amazing.  Although the mango and chili sauce was killer.  

For entrees we decided to get the Roasted Mala chicken with cucumber and cloud ear mushrooms and the Hakka noodle with mushrooms and chinese chive.  The Mala chicken was out of this world.  The portion was huge, more than enough for two people, but we kept eating because it was so darn delicious.  The chicken was tender and the skin was thin and crispy.  The sauce was flavorful, actually reminded me of a more mellow sate sauce, and complemented the chicken wonderfully.  The cucumbers were nice touch as they cooled your mouth down from the heat of the sauce.  The Hakka noodles were also amaze balls.  The noodles were a perfect texture and size (yes, I am so picky about the size of my noodles) and the mushrooms and chives tasted great mixed into the dish.  

I got the Hakka cocktail, which is vodka, sake, coconut, lime, passion fruit and lychee juice.  It was so refreshing and I love the taste of lychee juice in my cocktails.  I didn't finish it, so Carmen asked if I wanted a cup for it so I could bring it to the club.  

Side note - I am always amaze how reasonable the prices are for such a highly rated restaurant.  

Now here is the secret - if you dine at the restaurant and you want to go to the nightclub, just ask your server.  Carmen led us through a back entrance, where we went up a set up stairs and were id'd by one set of bouncers outside the Ling Ling lounge.  We then walked through the lounge and gave our restaurant bill to another set of bouncers who stamped our wrists.  After that, we walked right through a skinny hallway and then BAM, you walk right into a massive, yet intimate, wraparound club which envelopes the main DJ stage. 

Hakkasan, the restaurant and nightclub, are experiences that must be tasted and felt.  A review does not do it any justice.",fQV6uAPSIn5fTwM7nuunLw,6,2,5,GBNPvwct6FOgLdM7C6xqnQ

With Michelin stars decorating locations in New York as well as London, and a similar menu of modernized Cantonese cuisine from Chef Ho Chee Boon offered here in Las Vegas, it was only a matter of time before I visited Hakkasan at The MGM and with the 2014 ""Golden Week"" menu proposing an opportunity to experience a number of plates without investing in a $250+ Peking Duck or $35 fried rice it was with a friend that I finally sat down to dine amidst the darkened labyrinth beneath America's most lucrative club.  Grand in size, with soaring ceilings and dark woods juxtaposing white leather and signature styling, a meal at Hakkasan begins with check-in at an outer atrium and soon to be led between several dividers that serve to break the room into a series of alcoves it was expectedly the wine and cocktail list that arrived first, the upsale on from the start and continuing as the a la carte menu was presented with no mention of Golden Week to be found.  Pleasant and competent in service, despite obviously ignoring the notes in my reservation requesting the special menu and a seat with good light, it was with a single a la carte option that our meal began and with the intricate broth surprisingly vegetal to balance the sweetness of fresh crab I only wish we'd have had more time to enjoy it - the first course of dim sum and duck arriving hot on its heels with no more than two bites enjoyed.  Opting to set aside soup in order to focus on the progression of tastes it was with a sampling of the aforementioned duck that Golden Week began and essentially using the briny eggs to offset the fatty bird's sapor each bite was pure indulgence, the skin so thin it seemed razor cut and the attention to detail soon found to be duplicated in a steamer basket of dumplings from which both the spicy duck and creamy scallop shined.  Moving quickly to round two as I again attempted to enjoy the now-cool soup it was here that a trio of plates was presented and with promises that the 'rest' was soon to come I finally explained that the kitchen needed to slow down, a request thankfully met by allowing us to focus on what was present - the aromatic clay pot and fried rice loaded with tender abalone amongst the very best plates of the meal while the spicy shrimp in an admixture of peppers and nuts was the sort of thing I knew I'd regret later as beads of sweat burst forth from my brow.  At this point only fifty minutes into the meal it was thankfully after a short break that round three arrived and with both dishes using mushrooms as a base to impeccable proteins it was something of a surprise that the tender beef proved to be the best dish of the meal, a melting mouthfeel amidst innumerable spices and light acid that fully engaged the palate without coming off as 'hot' in the least.  Rounding out the evening it was in a bowl of six glutinous rice dumplings that we indulged and with melted dark chocolate bursting forth to mix with cells of finger lime and a broth of light ginger one could not help but swoon, a similar citrus and cocoa experience offered in a duo of golden macarons presented in a take-home box at the meal's end.

Decidedly expensive for a meal that lasted just ninety minutes I remain perplexed to this moment as to why the kitchen felt the need to send plates in clusters at such a rapid rate but with that issue aside I'm happy to say that both ingredients and preparation were exquisite, the opportunity to experience the duck without investing in a whole-prep particularly welcomed considering the sizable scoops of caviar while every other plate was delicious and surprisingly well portioned considering the tasting menu format.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,0,0,4,KP_UtVKieQWZ8FpiAerpVg

Although one might argue that you can get Chinese food for much less in Chinatown, do understand that their version is a bit more sophisticated. They use wagyu, truffles, abalone, etc. which aren't cheap. You're also paying for the location and ambiance.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,9,7,4,pdH4VnjGyQ8Ii-2N3RxX7Q

service is always top notch, thank you. this time, we even ordered dessert and that was one of the best decisions i made all week. the hazelnut mousse was exceptionally better than i expected and the black cherry forest treat was a delight. 

only thing i don't like is the vegas drinking water-which is out of their control. so, instead, we order bottled still water. this means i don't order their tea either because it's made with vegas water and i can taste the metal and impurities in it, blah. i guess i could ask them to boil my bottled water, but instead, i'll just order one of their many cocktails.",ZH-nYIEvpqKvQkinr_Lmpw,0,1,5,PffGlfk7NLmdO1RHjM5mQA

5373227,2013-12-28,3,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Pleasantly surprised is all I have to say about my dining experience at Hakkasan. At first, I was truly hesitant about eating at an Asian restaurant on the Strip. You know, being part of the Asian Mafia usually has us frowning upon businesses that are not located on Spring Mountain. 

A friend took the time to gather all of us here with the intention of trying it with an open mind. For our party of 6; we ordered four of the $118 tasting menus and a few supplementary items as well. It was more than enough to leave me feeling full and uncomfortable.

We started with the mixed dim sum. All of their dumplings were juicy and cooked to perfection. The crispy duck salad was next. The fact that they could call this a salad is outrageous. It was predominantly chopped up duck meat with a little arugula, pomegranate seeds, and nuts. Don't get the wrong idea. I loved it. It just caught us by surprise. Then the onslaught came. The spicy and sweet lobster was good. The sea bass with honey was odd. The wagyu beef was everything you could ever want. It melts in your mouth. The abalone dish was shaved too fine and came out like eating cartilage. The crispy duck with truffle oil was nuts. I was just craving duck something fierce, too. I left more than satisfied. The green beans dish had a nice kick and the texture of the beef/shrimp combo was good. By the time dessert came around, I was stuffed. The strawberry rhubarb dessert with champagne was lackluster. The rhubarb was undercooked and tough. The chocolate cremeux with yuzu sorbet was good. I would have eaten a whole bowl of the sorbet alone. 

The service was excellent as well. Our server was on top of everything. She was present without being overbearing and made the night. Especially after hearing some of the other experiences from friends that went a second time within the week.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,5,3,4,DjrebnQ4ryttV7aVqSJl2A

service was pretty good. at the table we ordered some dim sum, the pork belly, the udon noodles, the haka noodles and the sweet and sour pork. everything was magnificent. the pork belly just melted like butter. the noodles were perfectly seasoned and not too salty. the sweet and sour pork was crunchy and tangy. oh, and the dim sums were all amazing.

5384850,2017-06-21,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"As a Vegas local I have always wanted to try Hakkasan for dinner, and a few days ago I finally had the chance. Knowing that it is a high-end restaurant, I did have high expectations going in. I would say my experience was good, but I was certainly not blown away. I had the Ginger Smash cocktail and I really liked it, but my friend who also ordered it didn't like it at all because the ginger flavor was so intense. It honestly was, my throat was burning while sipping on this drink, but I didn't mind because I like ginger. However, it completely overpowered everything else in the cocktail. Here are the items that were memorable and my thoughts: Chilean Sea Bass entree was melt in your mouth delicious. Beef Tips in Merlot sauce were very tender. Crispy Duck salad, Shrimp in Curry Sauce, and Hakkanoodles were all decent- good but not spectacular. The Beef Ribs appetizer was way too fatty- I didn't like that at all. Unfortunately for dessert it was our friend's birthday and the waiter said he was bringing something out, but all it was was a small Macaroon and a few tiny pieces of candy or something for decoration- definitely not something we could share, so that was disappointing because I probably would have ordered my own dessert if I knew that was all we were getting. This all came with a pretty high price tag. Again, the meal was good, but none of us were blown away, including the birthday boy who absolutely loves Asian food.

Hakkasan on a service level is excellent even though I tend to weigh the quality of the food more than the service in my reviews. The decor and ambiance made me feel like I was back in the City in the Bay or some downtown Metropolitan Area. A big area with many partitions that feels private. Wood & Blue.

I don't really eat any Asian food besides Japanese and haven't fucked with Chinese food in a long time. Not a fan of hoisin or fish sauce either....Saying that, Hakkasan is probably the best tasting Chinese restaurant..fuck labels...one of the best tasting restaurants in Las Vegas!

I went with some friends I worked with and we spent a total of around $400.

These are the items we ordered in the order that they came out in:

Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter - Too fishy and not my type of dish

Crispy Duck Salad - This was great balance of duck and greens

Fried Soft Shell Crab & Curry Leaf & Chili - Out of the starters this was the best. With a little bit of rice on the side with soft shell crab...the outside was fried but with every bite, there was a blast of flavor and juices

Stir Fry Black Pepper Beef Ribeye - Very good

Mongolian Style Beef Tenderloin - Out of the two beef dishes, this was more flavorful and tasted better.

Roasted Chilean Sea Bass w/ Chinese Honey - The best dish that we had by far. Buttery, juicy, sweet goodness that seemed to just melt

Passion Fruit Panna Cotta - Perfecto

Chocolate & Black Sesame Cremeux - Not as good as the Panna Cotta but still good

Overall a great experience and highly recommended!",aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q,3,1,5,-6da8U03JkcidIW6g46R8w
5437480,2018-05-05,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Easily one of my favorite restaurants! Finally I'm writing a review after my second visit here.

First thing I'd like to highlight is the taste. The first time I was here, I was blown away by the balance of saltiness and sweetness in their simple egg fried rice. I had other menus but that was the dish I couldn't stop thinking about; simple refined taste, mild yet intriguing, taste that is pushed to the limits and standing on the fine line between disaster and being under-seasoned; it was perfect for me. That simple fried rice brought me back for a second time. It's the exact same taste! The rice was a little dry but the important thing is taste and I wasn't disappointed. 

Crispy duck with foie gras and black sesame roll was also the bomb. The duck was superb, fatty, rich and so crispy I had tears welling up. Salt and pepper squid sounded like a simple dish. But the squids were fried to perfection! And the fried garlic condiment that came with it was a nice crunchy topping for my fried rice. 

I also had the crispy chicken with mango and plum sauce topped with pomelo. I wish I had better words to describe the flavor of that but I can't! It was simply beautiful and hitting all the right notes in my mouth. There was also shrimp dish with yellow curry-like sauce. I thought it would be rich but it was just rich enough to cut the spiciness and tone it down to just the right amount. 

Now this is already too long but this is definitely not the end of my visit to here! Make sure you at least give this a try because it definitely is worth the price point.",iAEY7ToWmpJ45rMZJoGkgg,0,0,5,013iRfOz5YIGczoMm8Je1Q

5529416,2013-07-06,18,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"3.68991234 stars.  I have some serious personal issues with spending as much as I did on Chinese food for 2.  I just imagine my Taiwanese mother looking at this menu and freaking over things like $18 stir fried noodles (with no meat nonetheless) and $28 for essentially 8 dumplings (albeit very good ones) .  But alas...happy wife, happy life!  She really enjoyed the dinner and preferred this over Tao.  I disagree.  

Don't get me wrong.  There were a couple of excellent dishes but it's simply the principle of paying this much for it that endlessly irks me.  So let's start with those:

OUTSTANDING DISHES:

Crispy Duck Salad:  My Hakkasan host recommended this dish to me a week before.  The server said it was her favorite thing on the menu.  Who am I to argue?  It was the best thing we had.  The duck was cooked perfectly and combining it with greens, pomegranate, pomelo and pine nuts made for a super tasty dish.  I am pretty sure I will order this every time I dine here.  It won't be many more unless I am getting comped but this is a MUST HAVE.  

Stir-fried Black Pepper Beef Ribeye with Merlot:  Love Me Tender.  Tender is the night.  Tender Love.  Time, Love and Tenderness.  Tenderoni.  I would've included ""Try a Little Tenderness"" but there was nothing little about this.  It was A LOT of tenderness.  Every freakin morsel was juicy and delectable.  I also liked that they included big pieces of garlic mixed in.  To fully enjoy this dish, you should order a side of jasmine rice for $2.  

DECENT:

Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter:  I won't go into the names of them all but there was shrimp, fish, scallop and duck.  The fish was ground up and then secured in a black squid ink wrap.  The scallop had a little ikura on top which was a nice touch.  I chose to eat the majority of these dumplings straight without sauce to get the full taste of it.  They offered 3 sauces with them but vinegar would have been nice as Yelper Cynthia C. mentioned in her review.

The cocktails were also decent but I forget the names of them.

DON'T EVEN BOTHER:

To sum it up, go for the stuff you can't get in a regular above average Chinese restaurant. 

Four Style Vegetable in sweet Szechuan sauce:  I didn't plan on ordering this but the server recommended it.  We had also been eating a little more unhealthy than usual that week so both of us thought a few veggies would help.  This was a joke.  The sweet and spice didn't work and the medley of asparagus, shimeji mushroom, yam bean (had the consistency of apple) and tofu was weird for me.  

Hakka noodle with mushrooms and Chinese chive: I was recommended this dish before coming and I got it even though I was still skeptical.  This would've been good if it were $5 but not $18.  

The food wasn't the only thing going on here.  I liked how the tables were sectioned off to handle small and larger parties.  The atmosphere was pretty chill at the time we were there (7pm Saturday) but I imagine it might get a little more rockin later in the evening.  The service was surprisingly excellent and our main server was incredibly nice.  They also offered some tasting courses that looked pretty interesting but you had to have a minimum of 4 to do it.  

I don't regret coming here but there are a lot of better options at this price point in the MGM like Craftsteak.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,33,20,3,uSuo_Dw7zf2TIapWcusXaw

The good- Loved the lemongrass veggie dim sum, the spicy shrimp, and the birthday macarons for my girlfriend. Such a  nice complimentary treat.

The so-so- The roast chicken with satay was only okay. The flavors didn't ""wow"" 

The bad- service was a bit on the lax side, friendly but not as attentive as I would have expected for how dead it was. Our food came out quickly... but a bit before our cocktails.

The bad- unfortunately my $18 recommended tequila concoction tasted like straight tequila. I asked for more of the blood orange so we could add it to our drinks, which helped. I was charged $6 for the side!

The good- We were escorted into the nightclub. Though it was strange that at our table they asked if we were on a guest list. We were, but I figured they would have waived our cover regardless. We were each given a voucher for a free cocktail inside the club.

The good- prices really weren't as bad as I was expecting with most dishes at $20-40 for an entree. Rice and noodles are separate however. Our appetizers were only $12 and were quite large.",EwXTFlhKft8XR7rvLeLoYg,2,2,3,gvyZFKTKtSpv4rRrSlelfQ

5620232,2015-02-13,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Let me just start off by saying that I loved my experience at the Hakkasan Restaurant! I'm very glad my promoter suggested this place to dine at before clubbing at Hakkasan (Nervo was playing and the girls were AWESOME!). Prior to actually going, I yelped the restaurant and already had some dishes in mind that I wanted to try. Get ready for a pretty detailed review! :P

The food:
When I read the reviews online, I was slightly misled (at least for us). I read many reviews that stated the portions were small and that you need to order a lot to fill yourself up. As a result, I came in with the mindset that I had to order a lot and stick to proteins. However, the waitress suggested for us to ""order down"" because everyone's appetite is different. We ended up getting food from 3 different categories: 

1. Crispy duck salad $28 (under ""Small Eat"") 
2. Jasmine tea-smoked beef short rib $26 (under ""Small Eat"" as well) 
3. Stir-fry black pepper beef ribeye with merlot $37 (under ""Meat"")
4. Hakka noodle with mushrooms and Chinese chive $18 (under ""Noodles and Rice"")  

The crispy duck salad was super delicious (many Yelp reviewers will agree). And the portion was actually pretty decent for a salad. The Jasmine tea-smoked beef short rib was also pretty good. The meat was juicy, slid right off the bone and also decent size for something under ""Small Eat"". The Stir-fry black pepper beef ribeye with merlot was alright. The meat came in chunks  and were served with a- (excuse me for the lack of a better way at explaining this. Refer to my pictures) white, crispy chip in the shape of a cone.  The cone chip was actually pretty much tasteless but not so bad because 1) Chips like these are typically served slightly flavored or not at all. It just depends on personal preference. I personally like them slightly salted. But I just broke up pieces from the cone and ate them with the meat chunks to give them some flavor and they were fine this way. However, we didn't care as much for this dish as we did the others. Finally, we also got the Hakka noodle with mushrooms and Chinese chives. It was pretty good and got a kick to it (aka spicy). This dish is also decently sized. I am so glad we listened to the waitress and didn't order more because even though we only ordered 4 items on the menu, we were struggling to finish. 

*Side note: I don't normally eat large portions. So what we ordered were more than enough for me. However, the waitress reassured us that it's understandable for us to order and eat the amount we did. Some people just eat way too much and are used to the American way of dining- everything in big portions. Take her advice and ""order down"" first! You can always order more food later if you don't feel like you're full yet.

Service:
Our waitress, Leigh, was very helpful and patient. We told her it was our first time dining with the restaurant and asked many questions. However, she answered everything to the best of her ability and I'm glad we listened to her and didn't try to order more. The 4 courses were split up into two rounds. With each round, Leigh always came over and transferred the food from the dishes themselves to our own plates. We also got new plates and utensils to use prior to the second round of foods. Not going to lie- the service made us feel like we were royalties :) 

The restaurant itself & the crowd:
-It was slightly dark but not to the point where I can't see my menu or what's in front of me
-The greeters, hostess, and waitress were all very friendly
-Everyone was in their nice attires (suits & dresses)
-Crowd (from what I can see): businessman, couples, and families.

The restrooms (YES, they get their own section!):
Even before reaching the women's restroom, someone greeted me at the door and opened the door for me. I went in and LOVED how the stalls were completely ""sealed"". No more awkwardly trying to use the stalls while you see someone else's legs. I loved the privacy. When I went to the sinks and finished washing my hands, I noticed the towels to wipe your hands stacked in the shape of little pyramids. There's also hand soap and matching scents lotion at each sink. Also, there were no dirt marks left anywhere or random pieces of tissues left on the ground anywhere. Definitely very pleased with the restroom's cleanness and quality.  

Pricing: 
If you are looking for a cheap, quick place to eat at, you are in the wrong place. However, you definitely get what you paid for. The quality matched the price (and portion-wise...at least for the items we've ordered thus far). I definitely recommend people to try it at least once while they are in Vegas. I personally will gladly come again to try some other dishes because the food was that great!",VFgqOmmkNs5y_hTArqHodQ,4,2,4,XktmzlwCCSi8JapVRW7Kaw

Again, I understand #vegas pricing but it doesn't always have to be so flagrant. I will give it another try to be fair. I wasn't in the most tip top shape. The soup was very nice but very standard. They need to hire a chef from a hole in the wall #NewYork #chinesefood spot. Those Chinese are dialed in. Straight prejudice. Look it up kids.",WMVI4_zByzQFElF838WWEw,1,1,2,39d_PMQzUfUmTSC3YnX5Iw

       I was here for the Vegas Uncork'd by Bon Appetit Magazine, and the kick off party was here, so this review just for the restaurant alone, NOT the club.

      The food decor and lay out are almost as identical as any other Hakkasan NYC, Hakkasan SF, long bar, blue glass, amazing list of wines, whisky, gin, hard liquors and anything in between.

     Michelin Starred chef Ho of Hakkasan NYC was there to serve us all the delicious food:

- Caviar roasted duck
- Chilean sea bass
- Hakka steamed dim sum platter - har gau, scallop shumai, perch dumpling and black pepper duck dumpling - standard for all Hakkasan locations - always PERFECT! 
- Sesame prawn
- Crispy silver cod with superior soy sauce
- Macarons for days love!


      Everything was amazing just as I experienced in San Francisco, the food is so consistent, the service was top notch for Las Vegas; the cocktails were to die for! 

     Then we went to the club - amazing DJs line up each weekend, the space was a bit turn off for me. Since Hakkasan is the newest club in Las Vegas, it was insanely packed. We were already in, but we left after a few minutes chatting up with the press.

      So if you love authentic and exquisite Cantonese cuisine, Hakkasan is definitely a MUST TRY  spot for you in Vegas. For clubbing, I'd rather stick to Marquee, XS,  and Tryst for the ambiance and vibes!",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,7,4,4,TwQnLfyizU2f0mxTjUYRcg

(Next time we'll double order those two and call it a great dinner.) The Sweet and Sour pork was unimpressive and the French green beans good, but not great. The recommended shrimp fried rice was a total disappointment, it almost all went back to the kitchen.

The service was excellent +. We had a show deadline and they got us served and out on time...even escorting us to a side door for the taxi pickup the hailed for us. Nice ambience for being in the middle of Vegas.

We'll try them again, and with more informed experience, we may well find the next time gets them 5 stars.",tAfOSNkx4Ofp5DiN00i_Dw,1,0,4,o_eQMnw-UuL2sja0lUnAuQ

5685019,2013-09-05,6,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Having heard about Hakkasan from friends in London and Hong Kong, I was excited to dine at the restaurant with my friends. As a vegetarian, I was impressed not only by the large variety of vegetarian options at the restaurant, but also by the relative authentic flavor of the dishes. Without doubt, Hakkasan is a restaurant that is friendly to both vegetarians and carnivores. 

All my friends agreed the soup in Hakkasan are authentic and well executed, and they highly recommend the soup to Yelpers. Their favorites are chicken soup and the lobster soup. The former composes of red dates, black chicken and several Chinese medicine ingredients. According to one of my friends, she never had this soup outside of China, and was impressed by Hakkasan's effort in creating this dish. Another friend of mine also greatly enjoyed the lobster soup, which had lobster, tofu and mushroom. In her perspective, the mushroom enhances the flavor, while the tofu complexes the textures. 

For vegetarian Yelpers, I recommend the mushroom lettuce wrap, which is a refreshing alternative to the tofu lettuce wrap. While the pine nuts increases the texture of the dish, I suggest the chef increasing the ratio of mushroom to pine nuts in order to further enhance the flavor. I appreciate the waitress promptly refiling the lettuce for me. 

The vegetarian dim sum platter is a beautifully decorated dish that I would suggest sharing amongst friends. Although each dim sum was well executed, it tasted very similar to each other. All the dim sum were mainly composed of mushroom and used similar sauce. I recommend the chef increasing the variety of ingredients and sauce for the dim sum platter. 

While my friends and I greatly enjoyed the food at Hakkasan, we recommend the manager to provide more training to the waitresses. Our waitress was attentive, but she did not seem to know the menu well and asked my friend repeatedly where she saw fresh lemonade as a drink. As the lemonade was advertised as fresh, I hope Hakkasan will provide fresh juice instead of the sparkling lemonade in the future. 

I recommend Hakkasan to friends and couples, who are looking for a Chinese restaurant with well-executed food and a hip vibe.

Tip for Yelpers:
You can stop by the reception of the restaurant to make reservations throughout the day, if you are not able to reach the hostess via phone.",lXG7Mbhi6_nXaTZojpneUg,9,7,3,XifQazS1xFNz7dex4RTexQ

Also, their take on Peking Duck was seriously lacking.  It was basically two pancakes with duck skin inside them.  I'm not even sure if there was duck meat.  For 40 bucks extra that was pretty lame.  The table next to us thought so too.

5744654,2013-10-08,6,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Ummm ...seriously it will probably take me a few hours just to start this review as I am still in a food coma from Friday night when we all dined at Hakkasan.

We made a reservation and were seated immediately, cha-ching. We were all overwhelmed with the menu as honestly EVERYTHING looked spectacular. At the recommendation of our waiter as well as a friend, we ordered:

* duck salad - umm yeah so when our friend said ""oh you guys should try this"" we were all like mmm yeah...duck...about that.... None were interested to try this at all. I am NOT a fan of duck...not just like the polite ""oh no thank you"" but the like ""get that away from me"". When it arrived, I was looking over like ""should I try it? What do I do?"" Everyone else was eating it. I'm supposed to be the foodie over here...Ahh. So I caved. I went for it. Wait for it...wait for it...

Hi, I'm Melanie and I now like duck. The flavors all blended together so smoothly that no wonder this is one of their signature dishes. It's scrumptious! A must order. All of us enjoyed it (rare, but then again, it was in a salad, and my friends on the trip only ate salads...women!). I was all like ""let's get the fried dumplings"" and they're all like ""mmm what about a salad?"" NO! We are on a vacation and so dumplings we ate...with the salad of course.

* hakka steamed dim sum platter - MMMM especially the one with the scallop! AHHH I wanted to order 100 of these. 

* shanghai dumpling (which I asked them to make steamed rather than fried and they honored this request) - the dipping sauce was out of this world as were the dumplings themselves. I LOVE dumplings...like if there was a word that described love multiplied by 564376724724 to infinity and beyond, I would use that to describe my feelings toward dumplings. It's a sick obsession. Therefore, I have very strict standards of what a dumpling should taste like. Trust me on this one, these dumplings passed the test. I am still dreaming of them.

* stir-fry udon noodle with shredded duck and XO sauce (I switched the duck for shrimp which again they honored) this thing was like 12 buck$. If anyone can complain in a Yelp review on here about price and portion size, please don't ever dine at a fine dining restaurant ever again. This portion was bigger than a regular full-size dinner portion and yet was listed on the ""sides"" menu. It was more than satisfying and honestly if I just had this in itself, I would have probably been full. So it honestly ALL depends what you order and you have to pretty much get a sense of the menu to see what the bigger portions will be (or simply just ask). 

* steamed red snapper in spicy assam sauce - holy moly. Flavor order-load. You just have to experience it for yourself. Seriously. Do it.

* cod...yeah I'm just going to put cod because I can't remember which damn one we got (ugh, what a Yelper I am). Take a gamble on this one folks, you have a 50/50 chance of eating what we ate (although I'm sure the other cod dish is equally as good).

* fruit plate....yes as we were adjusting our belts (from all the food) and getting ready for a night filled with laughter and cocktails and all that heartfelt butterfly crap (aka a night on the town in Vegas), then the fruit plate came. It was like a scene out of jaws, you know the ""dun dun, dun dun"" music was playing in our ears and there it was...almost half the size of my entire body. Ok no, but you get the point. It was huge and SO well presented. I seriously did not want to eat it!!! But we did...and it was like we were so full we were about to burst and just couldn't stop eating it...I don't know what else they put in this fruit place besides, well fruit, but yuuuuuuuum! Fruit never tasted so good.

With such an extensive menu, of course you are going to have a huge range of things to order and various prices that go along with the various dishes. If you want to dine on a budget, order one main course and maybe 2 sides. There ya go and now stop complaining, geez. You can find things on the menu that are EXTREMELY expensive...if you are on a budget, here's a tip, don't order it. There are reasonable things as well. However, I wouldn't suggest dining at Hakkasan on a strict budget as you really should order many dishes to get the full experience (but it can be done). 

AMBIANCE. You just have to check it out for yourself...let's just say: amazing. 

This was definitely a meal to remember and definitely the next time we come back, our first stop will be Hakkasan.",vM1IcOZ60ULNqCuJnNwnXg,8,9,5,ISr3nLM8aj-u5Dfll4MLPg

There's no shortage of fancy, overpriced Chinese food on the Strip. I haven't dined at all of them, but Hakkasan has to be on the top of the list. I'm Chinese and grew up on Chinese food, so I know what I like as far as authentic Chinese food taste and flavors. But I also love the interpretation of food.

Hakkasan has taken some of the classic Cantonese dishes and flavors and puts a modern take and elegant twist on it. It's easier said than done, and it's the ultimate fine balance to please different palates. The menu can be overwhelming at first, but the staff does an excellent job with guidance and recommendations. As a first time Hakkasan diner, I naturally gravitated towards their signature dishes.

Dishes tried:

- Steamed dim sum platter: as an avid dim sum eater, this was more of a curiosity order than anything. Everything tasted great, though the shu mai and har gau was nothing imaginative, the black pepper duck dumpling was the highlight.

- Braised tofu, shiitake mushroom, eggplant claypot: a boring-sounding vegetarian dish, but packed with incredible flavor especially when paired with steamed jasmine rice. Practically licked the sauce clean from the pot.

- Roasted silver cod with champagne and honey: the fish was flaky, moist, and ultra delicate. Loved the subtle flavors of the champagne and honey. Just awesome and worth the splurge if you love fish.

- Stir fry black pepper beef ribeye with merlot: as a meat and ribeye eater, this was good. The cubed pieces of beef may look overcooked on the outside, but it's a perfect medium to med-rare on the inside. Tender and moist meat nuggets.

- Hakka noodles with mushroom: simple dish, but if you love noodles it's a good way to provide some carbs to compliment all of the other dishes.

Overall, all of the dishes were not oversalted and had delicate, subtle flavors -- all nicely executed. A lot of ""fancy"" Asian restaurants tend to over salt their food, but not here. Was it the best Chinese food I ever had? Of course not. But the dishes I had at Hakkasan still kept the ""soul"" of classic Cantonese cuisine. I will be back and try the rest of their menu. My wallet just won't like it.

*Thumbs down*
This is just me, but I'd rather spend the money on the food and not the dessert or drinks. There weren't any Chinese inspired desserts that looked enticing on the menu, but I ended up with the PB&J dessert and it was disappointing -- the peanut butter parfait was too frozen and dense. It tastes like something out of a hotel catering event. Dessert just doesn't seem to be a strong suit here.",KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,18,12,5,u-_NrIlt5WiMOmU58Pa3SQ

5782460,2018-04-09,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"I will preface this review by saying that Hakkasan is a totally acceptable restaurant if you are looking for fancy Asian fusion with a nice, upscale ambience. However, in my opinion, everything was way too overpriced. I would give this a 2.5 star review if I could, but overall I would say the good service and great ambience push it over the edge.

We came as a massive party of 25, of which Hakkasan was totally accommodating. They seated us in a private room on the second floor and stretched long tables back to back to seat us all. A very impressive, spacious, and quiet private room. I believe the requirement for this arrangement was that everybody needed to commit to the prix fixe Signature Menu. We ordered Signature Menu 1, which comes out to $88 per person (or so we thought).

Dinner was looong. It took us over 2 hours to get through the entire Signature Menu. The appetizers (Small Eats) were all quite good, especially the colorful dim sum and the roasted duck pumpkin puff. The main dishes I thought were pretty mediocre - standard fare you could get at most restaurants in a NYC Chinatown. The best one was the sea bass claypot, but nothing was truly that special.

Dessert was quite nice - but it's bizarre how little they provided everyone. They essentially split single dessert plates between four people. We each managed maybe half a morsel. I understand family style for the entrees, but for $88+ per person, we better be getting our own desserts. And don't get me started on the $125 ""cake cutting fee"" they imposed on a cake someone brought from outside for the host's birthday. With tip, tax, and other fees, the total ballooned to $130+ per person. 

If you really want to come to Hakkasan, know that you're paying not for the quality or even quantity of food, but the novelty of upscale Asian cuisine, good ambience, and typical Vegas upcharging.",leLMr9XF_nzEbIcE31FfhA,1,1,3,gvKfIKn696W5usKnnoLeRw

5810555,2016-04-26,1,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Hands down, the best Chinese restaurant for me in Vegas, and one of the several best Chinese restaurants across the country (the other one, Mr. Chow in Beverly Hills and also in Manhattan, and Yank Sing in SF, and perhaps the best ever in price performance, Great China in Berkeley, across the street from the Cal campus). Yes, I was already biased by the halo effect of Hakkasan in SF but, as a matter of fact, I actually liked Vegas Hakkasan better than the one in SF. 

SF Hakkasan is a hip joint catering to yuppie crowd winding down after hours, but Vegas Hakkasan is just right for an enjoyable dinner among friends and family, basically any age group. My group, 4 of us, included Lois, an 11-yr girl, and she loved sampling the taste of exotic Chinese cuisine. Above all, the food  we ordered melt in the mouth, the first bite tantalizing the taste bud with expectations for more. About $80/person, kinda pricey but worth every penny to all 4 of us. 

The bottom line for me is to forego the sickening intake of MSG at any random Chinese restaurant in the States; that's the reason why I completely stopped going to R&G in China Town in San Francisco.

Hakkasan Vegas at least knows how to bring the ever delightful taste of nature to life without bombarding our tongue with salt, pepper and chemical concoctions like MSG.",zHgJx4Q0MjKQBjJgPeN8cg,5,3,5,dvrYQZ_QaMJDkrtJqf5QoA

We ordered the pork belly, and had to send it back because it was too chewy & the fat wasn't rendered at all; kindly, our waitress removed it from our bill.  For main entrees, we had the Chilean sea bass w/ Chinese honey and Jasmine tea-smoked chicken.  The sea bass has ruined my hubby for all other sea bass dishes; the best he'd ever had.  My chicken was on the dry side, but given my sensitive stomach, I didn't mind.  Especially after two Buddha's Palm drinks -- of which I drank two & was super happy with the proper chunk of ice in my bourbon drink.  Hubby had a couple of Green Destiny drinks, also very satisfying.  All of this we topped off with pistachio semi-freddo, which was so pretty, we were afraid to put a spoon in it.

First off, the place is quite classy and elegant.  It has an upscale ambiance with seating divided into small cloistered sections by iron and wood partitions.  Cushioned half-booth seating features different colorful Chinese dragons embroidered on off-white expensive-looking fabric.

For the appetizer course, a Steamed Dim Sum Platter featured a woven basket holding big bite-size morsels of Har Gau, Scallop Shumai, Chinese Chive Dumpling, and a Black Pepper Duck Dumpling.  The fat dumplings were all very well made by hand, and delicious.  I liked each one, as well as my bite of Diane's Crispy Fried Prawn Dumpling that was rich with prawn meat, enhanced by fruity and sweet but not overpowering Plum Sauce, and decorated with Fried Rice Paper Noodles sprouting out of the prawn's top.

An add-on of Vegetarian Hot & Sour Soup was excellent, suitably spicy, and filled with delicate thin noodles.  But in retrospect, I wish I had instead ordered the Hot & Sour Soup with Chicken because I was later informed that it was identical to the vegetarian variety with chicken added, and both soups were priced the same.  To help wash everything down, I enjoyed excellent house-brewed Mint Decaf Hot Tea, with the tea leaves blocked by a tiny strainer. 

My entree of Roasted Chilean Seabass with Chinese Honey, alongside a few fried Enoki Mushrooms, was very tasty.  Sections of well-cooked moist white fish burnished by the honey flaked off nicely onto a fork.  Fine, generously portioned sides of glistening, stir-fried Pak Choy with Garlic and Egg Fried Rice rounded out and embellished this portion of the meal.

Inventive Summer Exotic Cold Watermelon Soup with assorted berries and Lychee Sorbet brought our memorable dinner to a refreshing close.  Service was exemplary throughout the night, and wet towels were produced at meal's end for a nice final touch.  It was a great Restaurant Week meal.

In sum, Hakkasan offers a very refined Cantonese dining experience that is expensive, but worth it!  Now that I have had a taste of its stellar cuisine, I will surely be back to enjoy more.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,8,5,5,xK80Ui-enHX4gJWDcvUabg

5887823,2014-01-30,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Alright.. There are a lot of positive reviews here and I think it is way overrated.  Everything was way overpriced for ""chinese fusion"".  Its like they took the sweet side of the chinese flavors and fused it with american sized portions and pricing.

We opted for a more carb-free version and shared this between 6 people:
+ crispy duck salad which had lots of sweet, salty, and fatty flavors going on.  best dish IMO
- seared scallops with fresh mango in chili sauce which was cooked well but nothing extraordinary on the flavors.
- Jasmine tea smoked beef short rib, the waitress cut it up for us but it seemed like a typical dish.
-Stir-fry lotus root with royal trumpet in sweet XO sauce was definitely on the sweet side and overwhelmed the natural flavors of the lotus root and royal trumpet
--Lobster soup with tofu and Chinese yellow chive was probably the worst soup dish ever.  for the price we paid (it was like high 20s) it was a small little bowl that barely had any lobster.  What happened to family style dishes?
-Hakka braised pork belly claypot, pork belly was melt in your mouth tender with a sweet sauce.  nothing spectacular.
+Braised lamb shank with Chinese herbs was pretty good as it was meat falling off the bone and not overseasoned.  It might be to gamey for some, but it was perfect for me.
+Roasted Chilean seabass with Chinese honey was another good one that had the fish just flaking off
-Crispy chicken in lemon sauce which reminded me of a chicken katsu covered in a lemon sauce. nothing extraordinary.

Total bill came out to about $465 with gratuity and that included a round of drinks.  

Ambiance was definitely really nice as everything was well decorated in the restaurant, hip music in the background, and dim lighting (although too dim for my friend as she could not read the menu).  Service was really good as they were very tentative and water cups were never empty.  A plus side is that they escorted us to the club afterward and we did not have to wait in line to get in.

It was the price and food portion that would deter me from coming back.  I could have gotten traditional chinese food without all the nice service and ambiance for about $100.  But its Vegas.. just roll with it sometimes.",zI9QZq47tDyrTDUY0mw6vw,0,0,2,yJcdWQ8SV-qAKIA1orbtVQ
5928635,2018-03-07,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"This is one of the best dining experiences I have had.  If your in Vegas, definitely have to try out this trendy cool restaurant.  My recommendation is to do the group sharing menu which is their signature menu.  It is like a prix fix menu by person and like this you get to try different items.  We ordered a couple of signature menu, menu 1 and 2, which is $88 and $118 a person.  So with it.  My favourites within the menu were:  Hakka steamed dim sum platter!  I usually stay away from dim sum but this platter was excellent!! So fresh and tasty!!  Spicy lamp lupin wrap was delish.  Pan seared shanghai dumpling so good!  Too many dishes to name.  The all time favourite was the Crispy Chilean Sea Bass.  This was the star of the meal.  Ive never had Sea bass like this....it was to die for!!  Great service as well, love the decor, and food out of this world.  If I'm ever back in Vegas will definitely be back.",DJhNKewgtH49pFBTDTMWDw,0,0,5,iQek_gjmo0R3g6mV8Gevkg

I had the jasmine tea smoked chicken, and it was a nice combination of sweet and savory. The skin on the chicken has a nice consistency that surprisingly worked well with the meat- my only little gripe was that for $30 I would have liked to see more come with the chicken than a side of jasmine rice.

All in all the service was fantastic, as was the food. If you've got a little extra money to spend on a nicer meal in Vegas, this is a great spot to try out.",1An9A7RVoiAvaJxvueaEsA,0,0,4,2QM7m9rSrqqUR-4XOgIPSg
5957193,2015-06-18,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"Been here twice ordered their best dishes both times.  

The one that everyone loved so much was the
Seared black cod 

The Peking duck was literally the best we have ever had. 
Instead of extra sauce they put caviar on top which makes it incredible. 
you get 16 pieces for that and its $225. so its not cheap. 

The Chief tasting menu we tried it the very next day
and the wagyu beef was everyone favorite that day.  
but you must have at least 4 people with you in order for you to order the tasting menu.  

Honestly speaking I rather not eat here again.  
The reason is everything is cantonese style. 
They use very expensive and fresh ingredients but the taste of the good quality you cannot enjoy fully because of the sauce.  
Like the lobster that came out with the tasting menu had so much sauce you cant even tell if the lobster is good quality or not. 

I enjoyed going here at least once.  It was good and I don't have much bad things to say.  Its just little bit over priced.",pGoMXo2tKe-6Tb8NOhQz6g,0,0,3,bgENhrxpMohI5Xr9sAUfAg
5979698,2015-06-06,0,kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA,"I'm very conflicted about how I should rate Hakkasan. The food was great but I'm very angry with the lady that took my reservation.

When I asked about the dress code, she told me no jeans, t-shirts, and sneakers. So we dressed up early because we had a full day. when we got to Hakkasan, there were people walking in wearing jeans, tees, and sneakers. Walking in dress shoes all day gave me blisters.

The food made up for a lot. The people that complained about the pricing have never eaten at a high end Chinese restaurant in Asia. You can pay $1,000 just for a bowl of soup.

The Chinese mushroom soup with wolfberry was excellent. The broth was rich with umami and had a simple yet sophisticated flavor.

The Peking duck with Tsar Nicoulai Reserve caviar was very decadent. The duck was traditionally prepared as you would get them in Beijing. The skin was crisp from roasting and separated from the meat. Most of the fat has rendered. They only use the skin, not the meat for the wrap. The skin was wrapped in a traditional crepe, not a bun as bastardized by the Chinese restaurants in America.

The duck meat was stir fried in XO sauce. Asians love XO sauce. It's made from dried shrimp and dried scallops. Rich in umami goodness.

This was a very authentic, traditionally prepared Peking duck accented with caviar. Many restaurants use the term ""fusion"" because of laziness. Those restaurants don't want to put in the work of traditional preparation. Not Hakkasan. You can taste the hard work in the quality.

The braised pork belly was melt in your mouth good. It's prepared Hangzhou style with a little more sweetness than the savory Southern Chinese style. The sauce was great with rice.

Definitely RTE next time I'm back in Vegas.",-kO6984fXByyZm3_6z2JYg,6,1,4,UAGmyoJBJL1wsZmZUsVwTw
