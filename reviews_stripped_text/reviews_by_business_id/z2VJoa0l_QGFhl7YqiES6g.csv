The bolognese sauce was the perfect combination of sweet and savory, the (what I'm assuming were homemade) noodles were perfectly done and were layered with just the right amount of cheese. The service staff, a young brother-sister duo, are very friendly and genuine in their care for the customers. This was far and away the best lasagna I've had in years and I will definitely be returning soon!",wKE7sfOhSoN_JVCMFkId6w,0,0,5,ksjzBR6VZmEhr5Tx1gDH-w

With fast food being the only options for breakfast or lunch in this area...I order from here quite a bit. I have ZERO complaints about the food or service...and I am very picky about where I eat, convenient or not. 

I especially enjoy their bacon & egg breakfast. The bacon comes out the way I like it: cooked. Its not greasy nor does it have uncooked edges like most places. That I can order breakfast as late as 11am is fine with me.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,1,1,5,Frv1VLgciinAYUfe78ZhXQ

992395,2012-08-09,1,z2VJoa0l_QGFhl7YqiES6g,"I was tired of the same old lunch options. I searched for a new idea and Yelp led me to Cafe Volare. It's bright Italian cafe in a industrial business park that specializes in breakfast and lunch. My first visit I had the Classic Panini ($8.95) with roasted potatoes. I preferred classic with ham, arugula and cheese to the Caprese ($7.95). Subtle difference, but I like the addition of ham next time I'll upgrade to prosciutto. These paninis remind me of those I had in Italy. They are simple, fresh and tasty. The roasted potatoes are rich with rosemary flavor and satisfying. I'm yet to try breakfast or pasta. Maybe next time?",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,1,1,4,bZ1Hu30bMmE7feCjTAvUmQ

Adorable little cafe with great food and quaint atmosphere and feel.  

I had the prosciutto sandwich with the soup of the day (vegetable puree) and both were fantastic.  My mother ordered breakfast - the eggs were perfectly scrambled, rosemary potatoes were very tasty, and the pancakes were delicious.

The meat was marinated and had a wonderful flavor. The pita bread was soft and fresh. Went with the potatoes (Fresh cut) -- they were crispy and delicious, and  the rosemary was not overpowering, yet very flavorful. (Avoided the frozen french fries). The smell wafting out of the door was yummy! Friendly wait staff too. Now, if we could just get businesses to STOP using styrofoam!

I got my order a few minutes after ordering...and when I got back to my office, I had someone else's order! Of course, I called to let the staff at the restaurant know I was given the wrong food and was on my way back. Once I got there, all I got was ""sorry"" from the guys that worked there. 

Needless to say, the food was actually pretty good. I had a Caprese panini which was amazing and it was such a big portion that I only ate half of it. I also had the Rosemary roasted potatoes which tasted good, but were drenched in oil. 

 I'll probably go back to this place eventually, but might dine-in next time and maybe I'll skip the potatoes.",_2Ay341jLkM6w8YgAxN0-w,0,0,2,gM0hhZ8zDKj-Dxh6iCkwvw

Service was good, menu options were extensive and food was prepared in the right amount of time...... Once the food was given to me the portions size was good... Food quality was weak in comparison to the pricing. I had the grilled chicken panini, the chicken was over cooked, the bread wasn't crisped up like expected from a sandwich press and the flavor was lacking something and side of rosemary potatoes...amazingness but not enough to bring me back...

Nothing over the top, not underwhelming, just right.  The decor is cute and fitting, and the staff was attentive and knowledgeable.  My only complaint (which took off a star) and this could be a deal breaker, is they had Fox News on the TV.  Like nails on a chalkboard when you're trying to enjoy something.  If this is how it always is I won't be back, however, I'll go again and find out.  Just put on a standard news and let me enjoy my meal.  I don't want to listen to those people while I eat.

Needless to say it was not what I consider a good cup of coffee. Luckily I did a bit of research before leaving and found this little place named Cafe Volare here on yelp about 1/2 a mile away. And man was I glad I did.

This place has GREAT Espresso, GREAT breakfast, GREAT atmosphere, GREAT service, not to mention free wi-fi. There was not one thing I disliked about this place. The rosemary potatoes, pancakes, french toast, and wraps were all so good. Just a great breakfast cafe. A great start to my family and I's day every morning. Never got to try any pasta myself.

Great sammi selection and some really killer soup.  The place was JAM packed and tons of take-out/phone orders coming in.  While we were there the in house crowd was close to 30 and they were banging it out with 1 front of house and 2 in the kitchen.  Bustin' some serious ass!  My ONLY knock was the sammi could use a little sauce (roast garlic aioli or basil mayo or something).  The server/hostess/cashier/I'm assuming boss said she'd try to put something together for next time.  They had mayo, just no gourmet to complete an otherwise outstanding meal.",DoGNqIcV70TVY1jy7xEDTw,0,0,5,44G8Ceq8_N-tlLzy1Bq7Kw

Fresh lentil soup, pasta e faggioli, homemade lasagna with a creamy bechamel, and chicken picatta, all have been delicious examples of lunches which reminded me of what my mom used to make. I LOVED this place and considered myself so fortunate to have such a gem close to work.  All this changed recently as they sold to new owners/partners and changed the menu to include middle eastern dishes like schwarma and falafel.  It wouldn't have bothered me so much, but the quality has declined dramatically and the prices have gone up.. Gone is my delicious spaghetti bolognese for $7.99, replaced with weird spices and overcooked chicken for $13.99. What is supposed to be hummus is some type of drywall putty. I mourn my old Cafe Volare as they now call it Mia Bella. I am so sad. I will never set foot in this place again and predict that it will shut down within 6 months. It breaks my heart. The new owners should give a course on ""how to take a fabulous business and run it into the ground"".",MjwH65PgZWVR6pKzA7tH_A,0,0,1,-BbAVwXi0L0Jz_A11TORTg

For under $10, I got the Classic Panini with Rosemary Roasted Potatoes to go.  The sandwich was fantastic with quality ingredients, and the potatoes were roasted dark and crispy, which is how I like em.  The portions were large and it was a very satisfying lunch.  I'm not usually a fan of Italian food, so I look forward to trying the falafel or shawarma specials on my next visit.  (My kingdom for some mujaddara or fuul in this neighborhood!!)  I like that it's a small business, but I think some family drama was going on backstage and it made me feel a little stressed.  I also hope they offer fountain sodas someday, since 20oz bottles are not my fave.  As i was leaving, a 20-seat work lunch arrived, so I'm glad I beat the rush!

5198970,2012-10-24,7,z2VJoa0l_QGFhl7YqiES6g,"A panini served with an Italian accent just tastes better. Cafe Volare occupies the corner of an industrial area near The Orleans, so, it's no Roma, but if you squint your eyes and listen to the Italian banter, you may feel a couple miles closer. For me, the lovability of this spot is just that.

They have free WiFi, so yes, you can set up your lap top and sip a cappuccino while busting out some work. 

I had to do a quick 20-minute lunch, so I went for something simple: grilled turkey panini. With the panini came a choice of a side, and I opted for an Italian potato salad. The result: a simple, but hearty lunch. The panini came with avocado (bonus!), and a delicious dressing, and the bread had a the ideal chewiness factor. I can't say it was the most amazing turkey I have had, but I enjoyed the sandwich. As for the potato salad, on the first bite, I thought it was too simple, but the more I ate, the more I enjoyed the pure potatoeyness of the experience. 

The menu features breakfast, salads and Italian specials as well. If you are in the area, I definitely think it is worth trying for lunch or if you need a spot to grab a snack and get some work done.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,11,13,4,Q3w6nBMIpYVvOVCuDMHdfw

Not a fan of bread, I ordered a bunless chicken sandwich with roasted rosemary potato and the soup of the day. My co-worker got a caprese sandwich. We both thought the food was sub-par. 

I repeated twice that I wanted my sandwich bunless but somehow they failed to follow the instruction. Regardless, I would not get this sandwich ever again as it was as boring and bland as can be. You get 3 pieces of chicken on some wilted lettuce and two wilting pieces of tomato slices. I thought the description said ""arugula,"" not spring mix lettuce! It came with no sauces, no cheese, no additional condiments. Blah.

The soup is also another disaster. I'm fairly certain I can make this exact same soup at home but it'd taste ten times better. Bleh! Gosh this soup is a disappointment to Italian cooking everywhere.

The chicken picatta was cooked very well, and the portion was just right.  It comes with a side, and while there are plenty of options, I kinda wished that pasta could have been one of them.  My boyfriend got a turkey panino, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was made with thick cut pieces of turkey breast, and not lunch meat.  He really enjoyed it.  His side was the potato salad.  The server explained that it wasn't the traditional mayo based kind.  It was like boiled, chopped potatoes with a bit of oil, and different herbs for seasoning.

The breakfast is solid. But nothing extraordinary. It is supposed to have an Italian flare to it but putting a sandwich in a panini press doesn't make it Italian. Or the heavy use of oregano.

My breakfast sandwich looked delicious. The cheese was all oozy and melted but it just lacked a little something for me. Flavor, maybe? The bread has a nice bite but everything in between in just didn't home for me. It wasn't bad or nasty, just not so Italian.

The potatoes that came with my breakfast had to grow on me. At first bite, I wasn't too thrilled but I will admit, they grew on me.
