Pros:  Price.  Service (5 star).  Fries, thin and crisp.  Good burger.

Cons:  No cons except it's not the best burger ever.  If I get another chance I'll have to order animal style.

It's just so sad that we do not have one on the east coast and I don't think we ever will according to my research. In and Out burger is one of the best things that the west coast offers that the best coast does not have. Maybe it's soooo good because you can actually taste the freshness and quality of the burger. Or maybe because it's not so accessible here that I find myself daydreaming of biting into a juicy burger dripping with the animal sauce. Anyway, I know you get the point. I ate here twice within my 3 day visit in Las Vegas. The line was crazyyyyyy long both times I went. Both inside and drive thru. Now you just know it's that good. The line moved rather quickly though. I really like that the menu is super simple making it easy for an indecisive person. Again, the burger is so good.

1550784,2017-09-07,0,-Bf8BQ3yMk8U2f45r2DRKw,I'm a start off by saying that in and out burgers are really good the reason I didn't give it a five star it was because when I went in to get the fries they were very salty. And they were also a little under cook. That is why I gave it a three star. Everything else was good especially for my first time. I heard this in and out is not so good but they do have different ones that are a lot better. I am yet to go try them out but I will let you guys know. Another thing I noticed is that the lines inside and the drive-through are always long. Burgers are a good decent size and will get you full. I had a strawberry milkshake and it was nice and thick.

They make your burgers just the way you want it. But they even do it for your fries. You want them animal style? No salt? You got it. How many fast food burger places do that for you with no complaints? 

Their patties and potatoes are never frozen. And they're delicious.

Just like the name, you can always expect to be in n out of this place (minus the lunch rush) and that's exactly what happened.

Only reason why this wasn't a 5/5:
- Fries were soggy. 
I always ask for fries no salt so they make it fresh, but this was a bit disappointing....

- no chopped chilies 
Asked for them and Sanja punched it in correctly but literally didn't find any chillies till the LAST BITE.

As a vegetarian, my go to is the Grilled Cheese ($2.30) off their not so secret menu and when I'm feeling healthy it is the Grilled Cheese, Protein Style.  The grilled cheese is not just cheese and buns but everything on a cheeseburger except the meat including secret sauce, tomatoes, lettuce, and fresh or grilled onions.  The cheese is melty with caramelized edges and the bun is soft and grilled to crisp on one side. The veggies are cool and fresh and together makes such a delicious meal. 

My husband orders the Double Double with Fried Mustard and Chopped Chilies.  This is a double meat and double cheese burger with the mustard grilled into the meat and green chilis chopped and pressed into the bun.

$2-3 for a burger of this quality is one of the big reasons why the chain has created a cult following.

Perfect menu for a straight forward or a secret menu for those who desire for more from here.
When you order drive thru, you LITERALLY get to see them prepare the food. My favorite thing to watch is how they make the French fries from the potatoes. They are always so busy so sometimes the drive thru line is way out on the main street. They are pretty good at moving the line along. There is someone outside taking orders way on advance. Makes me wonder if they ever stop working so hard. When I reach the moment of truth aka when I get my food, they are always great at asking what I need. If ONLY they actually listened sometimes. I always specify how many spreads,peppers I want. And they always seem to miss some. It's not a big deal for me but then I have to sacrifice my spread to the hubby. 
Dine in, is always hectic. People everywhere sometimes no wear to sit even outside. Mainly why I've been going drive thru for awhile. Now let's talk about parking and leaving.

Truly, In-N-Out itself is a west coast legend that everyone must try once. Their burgers are fresh and delicious, their process is incredibly efficient, and their restaurants are always clean. Their unlimited refills of pink lemonade are, after their burgers, one of the best things they serve here.

And this location in particular is incredible among In-N-Out locations. The staff is always friendly, the food is always excellently prepared (not poorly assembled or badly cooked like some other locations), and they always do an admirable job of cutting through the wait even when there seem to be endless people ahead of you.

I scrape a lot of the processed American cheese off and if you ask for sauce on the side, they will give you the packages of their special sauce so you can put as little (or as much) as you want.  My sister likes to put more and I like a little.  

They have fresh fries using fresh potatoes and I appreciate that.

We go to this one since it's closer to my aunt's place and we get to go to Whole Foods as well (since it's a couple of blocks away).

This location has been consistently clean, the teens working there have all been trained very well; they are polite, efficient and accommodating as much as they can be.  They smile, they greet and it's welcoming.  This location has always been busy, either the drive-thru or sit in but they work fast in the kitchen so the wait usually isn't really that long.

Their milk shakes from from a machine so it's not made to order (with milk and ice cream) so it's concentrated stuff which I'm not fond of.  So there's no way for you to ask for it to be thicker or thinner if you have a preference in your milkshake texture.  I hope that is something they will look into, having an ice cream and milk blender (I thought they did before hence the milkshakes always taking long to make) so that it goes with their motto of cooking food ""the old fashion way"".",upNep4Q2mMownruMWtUVGA,3,1,5,jy-FlBTsbQR-YNSwKsJmeQ

Seems more like ""creeper fishy"" to me, but anyways. This location is my favorite. I have been eating here since it opened and have never once had an issue. Consistency is clearly something In-N-Out Burger focuses on. The inside is always very clean as well the restrooms. The line inside as well the drive-thru can be crazy, but it's worth it. If eating inside it is best to go in with others so you have someone to order and get drinks so the other can scout out a spot to sit. The booths are hard to come by at peak times. The parking can fill up too, but recently they have added orange cones so there isn't as much congestion between the parking area and the drive-thru. 

Everybody pretty much knows the secret menu at In-N-Out Burger isn't so secret anymore. I love that the menu is so simple. When you know how to make something right, you don't need a large menu. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, shakes and drinks are what you will find here! For me this last visit (and pretty much every visit) I had a ""Grilled Cheese W/Grilled Onions"" (no lettuce) and it was perfect. Sometimes I get extra tomato, extra grilled onions or even ask that they add mustard. I also ordered ""Animal Style Fries"" and was glad hubby helped me eat them because it was a decent size. The chilies here are good and you can get them chopped on your burger or just on the side to munch on.  If you like to spoil your pooch then order a ""Flying Dutchman"" for them and they will thank you :)

But this is the first time I'm reviewing an In-N-Out, because the service here really impressed me.

I was sitting eating my order, and I noticed an elderly man and his son had sat down at the table next to us. They had finished ordering and gathering their drinks, and the son had left to go to the restroom. There was a worker, her name was Kim, who had noticed that their order was finished and was called a few times. The son wasn't there and I dont believe the elderly man had heard through the general noise. I looked up and I saw she had looked for the elderly man and went out of her way to give him his food. 

I thought this was just, genuinely really really great, especially with the general madness of how In-N-Out usually is. And ESPECIALLY considering how it was extra packed due to it being Black Friday. I don't really find or see that kind of service around, and I know it's small, but I thought it was thoughtful and great and was worth mentioning on a holiday that's become notorious for being crazy in the US (all those videos of crazy Black Friday shoppers you know). 

And as always, the food was delicious.

Five stars for this service, the service of all the other workers (everyone was genuinely nice and helpful), and for awesome food!",w3ivzZDM71x4J4zSwW_nGw,1,2,5,7IcSvmy5gz5yK6LspBTphQ

I think the most i took once was like 30 min, but when it's not busy, it's pretty quick, about 5-7 min or so. Since it is a busy location, the dining room is slightly bigger. And you'll probably see a lot of people from all over the world, since i've over heard many of them say they go straight here after the airport or that its on their to do list to come here.

My personal favorite is to just get a cheeseburger with no onions, light spread, one order of fries, all in a box with a lid. Reason being is that it seals up the moisture and makes the fries soft, that's just my personal preference, because down side is that the fries do get hard very quickly but its cuz they are made fresh.  But if you don't mind onions, i  would definately try it Animal Style. Its basically extra spread and grilled onions. You can made your fries animal style too.

Ordering from the Super Secret Menu makes for a decent burger (whole grilled onion slice is key), but they never read that it's impossible to cook good fries by frying the potato once. Lame, limp, and tasteless. Even ordering well done fries just makes sure they're not cold when you're done with the burger.

At a place where they hype the freshness of the ingredients, the milkshakes are on tap from a machine.

If you're from California, chances are that you OMG TOTALLY LOVE THIS PLACE. Put an In and Out Burger in the Midwest and you'll see it die a quick death because they're just NOT that good.

The place is quite obviously a stripped down Steak 'n Shake since they opened 15 years later.

In a prefect world, Fatburger would control every In and Out location since they are superior in every way.

If you know what real food should be, then eating here will just make you doubt mankind's superiority as the dominant species on the planet. 

If you, like the majority of Las Vegas, think that Taco Bell makes the best tacos, you'll love this place.

Also, the shakes are like 50% foam. What's up with that?

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 5 stars

Background - Originally we going to Babystacks for bunch but the hour wait was a deal breaker as we still have to drive back to Reno today.  We have never been to this In-N-Out Burger location before.

Atmosphere - Cookie cutter layout with the retro feel.  The walls and counters are done in whites and reds.  It is early and the place was very clean and had no problem finding a spot to sit, but before we left another group was sitting in our spot before we made it out the door.

Food
  Appetizer - None, do they really have any? 

  Main Course - I was going to order whole grilled onions on my cheeseburger the next time I went to In-N-Out but I forgot, looking back I was glad.  I got my normal, cheeseburger animal style.  This had to be the thickest animal style burger I have ever had. So yummy!

  Dessert - None, do they really have any?

Service - We walked up and the cashier was doing something with a credit card and the till, just strange.  He indicated he would be right with us.  But with a few seconds another cashier got his till going and took our order.  Always fast friend service.  I saw one of the oldest employees I have ever seen at any In-N-Out Burger, probably a little order then me, he was also a Mets fan, and I had a Mets t-shirt and my 59fifty 50th anniversary hat on.

I fell in love with your double patties, and double cheese as it sensually dripped from your hot fresh toasted buns. We broke up after I moved back to Oregon, but I would dream of you, and when I came back you were my first stop to satisfy my needs.

Fast forward to 2015. Over the years I have continued to visit you off and on and it has always been good. Even though my cravings for your sweet delights have grown less, I always think of you and visit when possible.

This location, off the 95 and Lake Mead...is always busy. I mean the street going into the parking lot is packed full of waiting cars. Doesn't seem to matter when, what time of day or night. Expect to wait a good 25 minutes. If I could make something happen, it would be to remove the auto parts or whatever store is there along with the Arby's so there would be ease in parking and waiting. The amount of times I've stopped by only to venture elsewhere due to the wait and lines has been numerous. In N Out, you have become a popular and naughty girl. 

This burger on this occasion (pre-Oscar night at 5pm), wasn't up to your usual standards. If felt forced, almost mechanical. Your sweet juices didn't flow into my mouth. Perhaps you are becoming too busy, and your quality isn't up to normal. I still love you, but I might have to date others.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,1,1,3,kgBH5hT4bOsXzUu-bIBNpw

The food is always fresh to order and accurate.

My only thought for improvement would be the parking lot. The bottom line is there is not enough and the configuration isn't friendly to dine in, and more designed for the drive thru..

I will still frequent the drive thru at this location. But will stay away from dinning in..",nVNG_EGrrES_KaZx3USxZg,0,0,4,Hyv5k7rJ3sA6SPFpV_wQqg

Asked for my order by ma'am or miss. Very well trained staff. Quick with the orders. And have never had a wrong order. Sooo clean. Even the parking lot is clean. I'm real big on clean. The windows and floor are cleaner then my house. This is just a well run joint.,ryqJ5re09J5u94jDVImCew,4,3,5,SALdkf3MnvJLteT1Ja6KfQ

Lucinda and I walked in just after they opened so it wasn't busy.  I wanted to glance at the menu for a moment but they were in a tremendous hurry for us to place our order.

Better know what you want in advance or stand back so they can't corral you into placing your order.  If you step up to read the menu they'll pounce.

Large fries.

We only have one size, do you want more than one?

Well, how big is it?  

Shouting in a very grating voice, the order taker repeated:  We only have one size, do you want more than one? 

She's very impatient, demanding an immediate answer.  I wanted to tell her:  Take a breath.  It's not busy yet.  Just relax and let us place our order. Allow me to ask a fucking question about the fries.

""I understand the concept of just one one size and I'm not hard of hearing.""  She didn't respond. If a customer expresses displeasure just act like you didn't hear it. Since there is no way to gauge how many fries are in an order, we asked for two servings. 

One order is plenty, it turns out.  The fries were limp and saturated with stale grease.

I asked for my double double with grilled onions.  The burgers came with no indication which had onions.  No onions.  Some fast food eateries will put a mark on the wrapping to let you know it has onions.  At In N Out it's part of the secret menu.  Whether you actually get onions when you want them is their secret.

Everyone shouts here.  Very loud, hectic, and annoying.  Very unpleasant.  They're all hurry hurry, hurry hurry.  I could understand if it were busy but the store was practically empty.

The burgers are just fair, no better than Burger King or Carl's Jr.  The ""cheese"" is not actual cheese but a glue-like product that sticks to your teeth & gums. 

You want bacon?  Forget bacon.  In N Out's secret of success is very limited choices.  And if they don't feel like it, you won't get one of the few choices they offer.

I'll be in no hurry to return.",PYnnzS_3-0oDAT3cmcfs9Q,3,1,1,vgAn6j0-r2U6A7RcLPWOKw

The Double double bread had a weird texture sort of frozen but not. The fries normally I get them cause there really great however I was really shocked no flavor places I have been to sometimes but a spice rub, this was just overly salt and pepper and lightly cooked. the shake was good. There are other really good burger joint out there but worth checking out. While I do admit this was first time being left kinda disappointed in a in and out burger place.",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,0,0,3,qMM3axiTZVx5F3QEwGM5eA
