As many others have said, the service here (albeit friendly) is slow. I can't imagine what it would be like when the place is packed. 

Food wise, my meal was really good! I got the grilled vegetable burrito, available under the speciality sandwich section - haha. Three words: more Oaxaca cheese. This is what makes the burrito people. Ask for extra, trust. At $14, it's a wallet thinner.

Since you are already spending an arm, you might as well spend a leg on their juice. The watermelon juice was very good. I would come back just for the juice.

This is was the first time I bothered to read their menu/info tablet and this place is open 24 hours. Good to know at 4 am when everything else in Aria seems to be closed.",n2xGqfJOdUXuzGqY1tCUGQ,0,0,3,v6pSZ7bBku1TDv6y1wpfzQ

Having been up since 3am to fly down here, we were starving and one of hotel guest services recommended Cafe Vettro.  We took her offer and headed down for a late breakfast.

Ordered the waffle, 2 eggs dish, cuban sandwich, and coffee.

Coffee was bold and delicious!  Waffle came with maple syrup, sweet cream, and fresh berries.  Delicious.  Portuguese sausage was yummy!

Here's the bad part.  The Potato pancakes were raw and pale looking.  The cuban sandwich was served COLD.  We told the waiter and she offered to make us a new sandwich and fix the pancakes.  

Sandwich came back piping hot but was it any good.  It was just OK.

Manager came by and comp'd the entire breakfast.  Here's the thing, she came by and asked how everything was.  We were very sincere and noted the positives and pointed out the few negatives and she thanked us in letting her know so that they could improve and fix things.  

We came with a very open mind that services might not be up to par but if you're willing to experience it, just go with it, have fun, let them know what's wrong and I'm sure they'll make you happy if you like it.",EiSdTjwv9RwFyhC08nMcgQ,0,0,2,DiZTAOvryI-I6gXouEeIYQ

59890,2014-05-20,0,TVbVii4EUQt9DG7y698zIw,"We come to Vegas every year and have mostly enjoyed the food, although it depends where you go. This morning we were looking for good breakfast. Breakfast already seems problematic here, but at 11am it is even more difficult to find a good place to eat. We came here because we were passing by and were told that they served breakfast until a later time. The jam came in individual mini jars, which were adorable and had me excited. Unfortunately that was the best part of our breakfast. I had a healthy option of egg whites with tomatoes, spinach and mushrooms, which came with a side of asparagus and brown rice. My food was super bland. There was no taste to any part of my egg whites or veggies. Asparagus is one of my favorites, and is hard to prepare wrong. This asparagus was bitter. The brown rice looked like the instant one which I have only came across once at a bachelors house. My girlfriend had 3 eggs with bacon and hash browns. How do you mess that up? The hash browns were 2 patties that resembled the ones at dunkin donuts. The eggs were greasy. Even the bacon wasn't good. I eat out a lot and maybe I have been spoiled by the many great options Chicago provides for breakfast, but this food wasn't even something we took 3 bites of. I ate toast and drank my coffee. My girlfriend struggled through 2 pieces of bacon and an egg. When the waiter came by and asked how it was, I politely told him the food was very bland. He asked me if I wanted something else, but judging by my girlfriends meal I did not believe there was anything else I would like. We asked for boxes, and I told the waiter we were going to give it away to a homeless person so that someone else can enjoy it, since he did not give me any option besides replacing my food with another plate. The check came, it was $47 and some change for 2 coffees and the two plates. I gave the waiter my debit card and he brought back a receipt that said my card was changed $59 and some change. I asked him about the discrepancy, he apologized and said he made a mistake. I told him were all human and it happens. He said hell void the other transaction and charge the correct amount. I asked him if that meant he was going to charge my card twice, because since it was debit I knew it would take 3-5 days to come back. He assured me no, and the only thing that would be charged to the card is the correct amount. I have the Chase app so I was able to log in right away at the restaurant and see that yes of course there were two charges pending. Since its debit of course it takes it out of my available balance so at this point I have paid over $100 for breakfast I did not even eat. When I showed the charges to the waiter he had nothing to say. The money did not come back until after we were done with our vacation, which thankfully for me was not a big deal, but for others $57 might have been. Overall I can not believe the terrible food and how much they are charging for it. I do not mind paying top dollar for dining out, but not when you can't even get eggs right. For the rest of the stay we had breakfast at Denny's, which in Chicago I have never even stepped a foot in, but it's a good thing we did because their skillets were 100% better then any food at Aria Caf√©.",TK8Bn3g1JDSS899Rgm8Jcw,0,0,1,pbUirbXjjASoG82PxbW1wQ

When I first met Russell in August, he was very knowledgeable about not only his restaurant but he was knowledgeable about all the buffets in Las Vegas. We spoke extensively about the buffet at Wynn and how it compares to the buffet at Caesars Palace because I wanted to know the major differences because I was planning on going to 1 of them.

The next time I saw Russell was a few months later and he remembered exactly who I was, he also let me try 1 of his desserts (on him) due to a problem I was having not related to him or any service at Aria Cafe. I had the chocolate brownie with ice cream and it was phenomenal.

I do not know Russell past these handful of personal conversations I have had with him in person at Aria Cafe, but I really do believe that he is going to be an outstanding GM of an MGM property, restaurant, or club 1 day.

No one checked in on us during our meal. They ended up throwing the check on the table and walking away without saying a word. I put my card in and tried to get our waiters attention but he passed the table multiple times without stopping. I eventually walked it to another waiter who then gave it to him. 10-15 minutes later it arrived back for me to sign. The meal was about 60 dollars. Totally not acceptable for the price.

Update: I do want to say that the Manager Tiffany was wonderful when we spoke with her on our way out of the restaurant. She was professional, took some off of our bill, and handled the situation excellently.",IWJZJ9mgW-73KdcFlQzaFQ,0,0,2,44HAcMaxxKw5A2ej6myX5Q

413562,2009-12-26,0,TVbVii4EUQt9DG7y698zIw,"My boyfriend and I decided to stop here while visiting Aria for the first time to try some appetizers and possibly desserts as well.

The decor and look of the place is amazing, very pretty, but the food and service were AWFUL!

Our server would have been better suited to working at a diner somewhere, not a restaurant charging so much for a meal. She took about 10 minutes to even greet us, and talked for another five about how she was from Boston (pretty obvious from the accent) and then told us some asinine story instead of taking our order. Our drinks took another five minutes to arrive after that.

I ordered the quail empanadas, and my boyfriend decided on the french onion soup. When the food arrived, mine was cold. The plate had two very small emapnadas on it, for $12. The flavor was entirely dominated by cheap-tasting, probably canned black olives, and I'm pretty sure the meat was chicken, not quail (hard to tell because of the overwhelming and off-putting olives) it came with wilted, warm, undressed greens and an oily sauce with some herbs in the bottom. I choked down one bite then lost my appetite.

My boyfriend's soup wasn't (soup, that is), he received a bowl of soggy brown onions (very small for the $11 price tag on soup) with a soggy crouton and paper-thin slice of cheese. When the server came back over, we told her about the problems with the food and she got the manager for us. She offered me another choice off of the menu, but the empanadas made me lose my appetite, so we asked if we could have it taken off the bill and bring out a better bowl of soup.

When the server finally arrived with the soup, it was super oily, thin, and had only a few strands of onion in it! Bf said it tasted like boillon cubes. French onion soup is a fairly easy item to make, and the restaurant couldn't even acheive the proper consistency for a bowl of soup. After one bite, we told the manager that we were not going to pay for the terrible food, gave our server a tip for her time, and left.

None of the other tables around us appeared to be having a good time, and every time I heard the server ask about the food, people either said that they didn't really like it or just ""eh"". There was also an off-putting scent of bad fish from one of the adjoining tables.

I work in the industry and was completely unsatisfied by this restaurant, as they couldn't get very basic food correct. Super over-priced, and a waste of a beautiful interior space.",9IwyoojAaRYeYMLnyF4ybA,0,0,1,lBC1FbwctHsL1KDuchpiYQ

The eggs were fine, but the toast had cooled considerably by the time it arrived, the hash brown ""block"" (shaped like a sponge) was so cold and hard I had to send it back. When I bit into the turkey bacon, I hit something hard enough to make me think I'd chipped a tooth.

Despite sending the hash browns back, my server didn't ask how the rest of my meal was when she cleared it. I told her anyway, and said that for $17 I'd expect better-quality food. By this point I felt, given the Aria's prices and glowing marketing copy, comping the meal with an apology from the manager would be appropriate. Instead, my server returned with a revised check that still charged me $9 for three eggs and $5 for the coffee -- so with tax, I still paid over $15 for a breakfast in which three of the four food items were subpar or inedible. 

I was going to have a breakfast meeting here tomorrow, but there's no way I'm subjecting a business prospect to this. We'll go elsewhere. Really disappointed.",gz7lluBQGWvMytZmBwLdOw,0,1,2,aP1E7bRM3zR-PK-uiuvfsA

There is a multitude of fine dining options at Aria Las Vegas Resort & Casino, but sometimes you just want a burger, ya know?  Cafe Vettro is the answer.  It's a beautiful space with towering floor to ceiling windows facing the front entrance of the hotel with amazing amounts of natural light.  I believe they recently installed shades for the windows because it used to be like dining while staring at the sun.  Not fun.

You'll find the typical menu items here:  burgers, salads, sandwiches, fried calamari and steaks.  The steaks are surprisingly good and a great value for the price.

I would recommend this place if you are looking for a casual, easy restaurant that is moderately priced. This casino just opened 3 weeks ago, so i'm sure that's why some people had bad experiences.",7cdF66Rp0b3Z82Q8F74bjg,0,0,5,HVoPKGbYuB3jV6VKiEOSgQ

The starkness and monochromatic palette of the place made me feel that I was eating my Chinese Chicken Salad (or other communist approved food) in an East German government building during the early days of the cold war. There is very little decoration, color or even signs that the space was meant to be inhabited by actual human beings.

With no sound-absorbing surfaces (a pet peeve of mine) the place had a hollow, utilitarian feel and was amazingly loud and reverberant for such an open space.

I will say the dour, mechanistic look is a pallet cleansing contrast to the life, energy and mayhem of the strip outside but perhaps just a hint of color...or warmth...or humanity would be welcome.

On the bright side (and most things will seem bright next to the Schutzwall grey-green used here) the food was very good and the service was provided, not as you might expect by burly East German waitresses but by warm friendly folks who seemed to enjoy their jobs. (Unlike some reviewers I had no issue with service but I was not in any hurry)

The first time I went, the bf and I just wanted to take out sandwiches to bring back to our room since it was around 2AM and we'd gotten back late. To place a take out order, you actually have to sit down at a booth/table and order through the waiter.

Our waiter the first time around was amazingly obnoxious. I didn't tip because it was, after all, a to-go order and really... no service had been rendered to deserve a tip. The waiter actually had the gall to open and look at the check when he came by to pick it up. And when he saw that I didn't tip, his face noticeably darkened.  ...Yeah, I was worried for my sandwich that night.

Thankfully, the sandwich (a BLT) was tasty and I couldn't find anything wrong with it except that I'd asked for wheat and gotten white bread. The fries did get a bit soggy by the time we walked back to our room. We also found that the bf's French Dip Roast Beef sandwich was missing the jus... so it ended up being semi-dry.

After such a meh experience, we were a bit reluctant to go back but it was our last morning and I think I still had around $80 in credit to burn. So, we went back and decided to have a crazy breakfast.

Our waiter this time was luckily very professional and nice, and our dishes were quite decent. I got Irish oats and a fruit plate, and my oatmeal came with little containers of milk, honey, and brown sugar. The fruit plate had a selection of sliced melons, strawberries, and blueberries. The bf's omelette was massive and maybe had a little too much cheese. Finally, we also ordered a watermelon juice, but it didn't taste fresh-squeezed and there were no refills for the small, nearly $7.50 glass (!!).

Overall, it's way, way overpriced and service is sketchy. Perhaps it depends on what time you go - the morning waiters were definitely better than the ones at night.

SO me and my sister decided to come by here and check this place out since it looked nice from the outside. We were immediately greeted by a very nice lady(hostess) and thought we were a couple! So she tried her best to seat us in a very quiet place and tried to put us together UNTIL I TOLD HER that we aren't a couple and that we were siblings! We both laughed about it and also told us about how she always used to get the same thing since her and her brother are really close as well. So she sat us down and asked if we were going to go clubbing anytime soon and offered us VIP passes to ARIA's HAZE night club. She gave us 7 tickets since we were with a group of friends.  Such a sweet lady, we loved her.

Anywho, we were serviced by Lisa and she was OK. We started it off with a fried calamari(my fav) and also had a Pomegranate Mojito that was pretty dam good. I also ordered the pizza there and sister ordered some sandwich. The portions were pretty good size. I wished they had mroe calamari. Pizza was really good, but looked funny. Sisters sandwich was amazingly big with a bunch of fries in the middle.

OVERALL: Place has very nice decor. Loved the way it looked, atmosphere was pretty decent. Perfect for drinks and relax. It's a bit hidden, but definitely noticeable. Food was not the best but OK at most. Price was pretty expensive for what you get, so that's the bad. Overall, I'd give it a 3, but because the hostess was so nice, I had to give it a 3.75!!!

We were seated immediately in a section where there was no one else around, so we figured our waiter would be focused on us. Apparently, that was not the case because we spent the first 5 minutes waiting for our drink order, then another 5 to get the drinks. Once the other half of our party arrived, it was the same timing to get their drinks. For only six of us, 20 minutes to get water, coffee, and juice is not acceptable. Plus, he wasn't waiting on any other tables, so it's not like he was focused on other parties.

The food was very mediocre. I personally had the shrimp and grits, and it was not very good. The shrimp were tough and overcooked, and the grits were bland. Other people in the ground just got eggs, bacon, toast, chicken and donuts. I tried a little bit of each of theirs and it was nothing I haven't made better myself at home.

I liked the beautiful floor to ceiling windows, which give a lovely view of...the parking structure and driveway.  I've heard others refer to it as airport like, and it does indeed have a ""fancy terminal"" vibe.  Nonetheless, the teal and river rock-accented decor is clean and classy, though the seats are showing wear and tear and need to be reupholstered (this seems to be a common problem).

Thankfully, the food was fantastic.  My brioche French toast was light, fluffy, chewy, and perfectly cooked.  My ($6!) side of turkey bacon was requested crispy and came out exactly that; a salty, crunchy compliment to my sweet entree.  Other family members enjoyed their food as well, including a tasty pecan waffle and fried chicken that I snuck a bite of.

The burger was so dry that it made me gag. I didn't ask for it to be extremely well done. I ended up just eating the French fries. 
The 2nd (and final) time I came when I was staying at the Aria during lunch hours. First I asked the hostess if it was possible to order from the menu and take it to go. In her most snooty tone she told me this was IMPOSSIBLE. I explained how I wanted to just order something and take it up to my room. Her reply: ""Well just order room service from your room then!"" I figured the menu at the restaurant would be more expansive during regular hours, and definitely compared to room service offerings. So I asked to be seated. I ordered soup and a sandwich and told the waiter to bring out the soup and just box the sandwich  to go. The look I received in return would make you assume I asked the waiter to kick a baby.

Overall, this place is a standard hotel cafe in vegas. Has a wide menu selection (anything form breakfast, to chinese food, to burgers).

We came here around 4:30am on a sunday morning. We were seated right away and was able to place our order quickly with our waiter. Our waiter was nice and seemed to be in a good mood, despite the time of morning it was. 

I was trying to sober up quick since I had to leave for the airport in an hour so I decided to get a burger with fries. It came out and was a standard burger, meaning nothing special about it. I usually get the burger since its greasy and will soak up the alcohol and its pretty hard to ruin a burger. when it came out, it was just like I expected. It definitely wasn't worth the $18 or whatever they charged but it was fine. 

The only issue was with the order for some of our friends who ordered through another waiter. They had already been seated when we got there and when we found out they were also there, they came over to sit with us. We told the waiter so that their food would come to our table instead. Well we all got our food before our friends who joined us did. They had placed their order at least 5-10 minutes before us. Our waiter said he tried to find their order but couldn't find out who put it in. In any case, he had the kitchen make their food right away and it was at our table within 5 minutes. 

overall this place is a 2.5-3 stars. Its just average but since its open 24 hours, its a good late night / early morning spot before heading back to your room after a long night.",V4U8GXEp4nouIt9modAU-A,0,0,3,gj9iiLsj7r6JknsW2cmoSg

Our group mostly had desserts, which were severely marked up, along with the other overpriced items on the menu. Also, an Orange Juice was $7! WTF!

The Cafe has a terrific menu with a good selection at breakfast and lunch.  I don't know why I chose eggs and limited myself from enjoying the other dishes that when served looked wonderful.  I had a bite of the club my hubby ordered and it was delicious!!!  Fries came to the table which were shared by all of us and they were perfectly cooked and very tasty.

My lunchtime omelet came with this odd looking rectangle stack, which I later found was hash browns. That was an interesting presentation.  It was good, but I am on the fence about the presentation being like it was flipped from a rectangle baking pan.

For me, I give the food taste and presentation just 3 stars, but the service was excellent, so a solid 4 stars made up for the meh food I had.  Those I dined with see it quite differently and would give it 4-5 stars for the venue type and the expectations for the food they ordered.

I stayed at Aria with a few friends and with everything in Vegas being so spread out, this was our go to place for brunch. 

I had the Cobb salad which was pretty good.  All the servings were pretty large and the service was really good.  

Nothing too standoutish about the place aside that they use natural lighting with the windows.  Any buildings in Vegas that actually lets you see outside is a plus in my books. 

Overall A-OK, but I would mainly recommend this place if you're already in the Aria hotel and want to grab a bit to eat, but not if you need to make a special trip to the hotel.",wWXcjHOsACqRyoCT6wKZEQ,1,0,3,tjoKfQoZOg7BiiZTCToS1Q

Had a late night snack with my buddy. Ordered from the late night menu (11AM to 6PM).

* Chicken Quesadilla $13 (3 of 5 )- Crispy, but nothing else special. It was actually pretty small portion for $13.  
* Chicken Fingers (chose Buffalo) $10 (2.5 of 5) - They were pretty generic looking. it was like 4 boneless pieces and fingers dipped in a really vinegarred buffalo sauce. The buffalo sauce was too sour for me.

The place is beautiful and it opens 24 hours. But the food doesn't meet the high standards I expect from Aria. I think they can present and make better cafe dishes.",B856VSGCvHAB-mil7JVprA,0,0,3,wS8i9OdYyAeqMqBunK_G3w

When we asked if we could check with the server- she responded if he had it he would have turned it in. Luckily the server was in sight so we asked anyways and he immediately knew he had it. The hostess could of cared less of a lost ID that was essential to airport travel or that she did not care enough to actually ask- not a five star resort experience on any level.

They like to personalize service and ask for your name when they seat you.  While a nice touch, it was awkward a number of times as the server tried to pronounce my name.

1741314,2010-07-02,8,TVbVii4EUQt9DG7y698zIw,"Just like my recent meal at Studio Cafe in the MGM Grand, Cafe Vettro really personifies a lot of Vegas dining.  There definitely seems to be nice restaurants in Vegas, but there are just as many restaurants that are below average.  What makes matters worse is that these restaurants can be really bad and still turn a profit.  These restaurants get so much traffic from the casinos that no matter how bad they are, they will always have customers.

This 24 hour cafe (located in Aria) is very big.  There is not much to the decor, but it is comfortable.

The menu features breakfast (served all day), sandwiches, salads and plates (including fish, beef and pasta).  The sandwiches are priced below $20; the plates go over $20.

The complimentary bread was some pretzel bread (with dried fruit).  I do not know if it was purposely served cold, but the bread definitely would have been better if served warm.

I went with the barramundi because it did look decent when I saw a waitress carrying it.  The barramundi (kind of like a sea bass) was pan seared and served over fingerling potatoes and garnished with edamame (kind of an odd pairing) and a thin cream sauce.

The fish was flaky and moist.  Mine was not as seared as the one I saw.  It was okay.  The veggies and sauce were bland and boring.  Some of the veggies were cold too.  My friends mentioned that some of their food was cold as well.

The waitress was trying hard, but the service at Cafe Vettro was not that great.  It took a while to put in the orders as well as to receive the food.  It was hard to flag down a server too because it did not seem like they had enough staff.

Cafe Vettro may have some other stuff on the menu that is better, but from what I had, I probably would not give it another shot (maybe I would try it for breakfast).  I think on my next trip to Vegas, I really need to plan out each meal (no matter how small) to avoid having another subpar (and overpriced) meal like the one we had at Cafe Vettro.",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,17,12,2,NlWufZl_1smsl9PG64pFIA

Came here last weekend in the wee morning of Sunday for some after-club munchies since it was the only place open in Aria, where we were staying at. We were seated right away by a very pleasant hostess, but after that, everything went downhill. We ordered chicken & waffles, the rib eye steak, and steak and eggs. My rib eye steak was more on the medium side than medium rare, and my girlfriend's steak was medium well rather than medium rare. She asked to have another steak made at medium rare, but the second one was also medium well. We were too hungry to wait and forced the overcooked steaks down our throats. When we paid the bill, my friend realized that her wheat toast was completely forgotten, so our server had to pack it for us.

Later that afternoon, I gave the place another shot at it. At first, I wanted some champagne, but our server had no idea which champagne I wanted. Since there was no drink menu available, I didn't know what the caf√© carried, so I was surprised that our server couldn't tell me what they had. I opted for our traditional morning/early afternoon dose of vitamins, aka Bloody Mary, which isn't on the menu, and I now see why...It lacked any garnishes and was so bitter that we couldn't make ourselves drink any more of it. I replaced them with a Hemingway, which to my relief was actually quite refreshing. The tomato basil soup was good and filled me up. The Aria burger, however, was too salty for my taste. I had to badger my friends into helping me finish it.

Now for the food... 2 stars at best. Lunch here is a disaster. Everything was bland and low quality! My Cesar salad must have been one of the most boring salads I've ever eaten. Lacking flavor and the dressing is rather watery. The nachos were ok, something I could have easily concocted in college with velveeta cheese. The spice to the nachos was good though, but I also could have been starving since my salad was so blah....

breakfast on the other hand wasn't so bad. Dreaded coming back here for breakfast after the horrible lunch we had but we were rushing and knew it obviously wouldn't have been that busy. My eggs Benedict was not bad, well cooked and the hash browns were a pleasant surprise. Still nothing amazing though for the price.

The Aria Burger was alright, nothing special. Used some poker comps. Not worth the full $18 (though I have yet to find a burger that would be). The Raspberry Iced Tea wasn't that great either ($4.50). Turkey Burger was ok. Fries were standard. Other customers didn't seem that thrilled to be there either. The only reason to eat here would be for the convenience if you're staying at the Aria, or if you got a fully comped meal. 

Aria probably assigned management to make mediocre food, as they would be competing against their own (fine dining) restaurants. Probably some kind of marketing strategy to get you to spend more in other places. Pretty standard business structure.

We ordered the Fish & Chips and the Jambalaya Pasta. I have to say that the Fish & Chips was kind of a mess with the batter being kind of soggy and the fries just kinda bland. It wasn't worth the $22 bucks that it costs except for that it was a rather large portion. The Jambalaya pasta was another large portion and was decent but again nothing overly wonderful. The chicken in it was a bit dry and it was swimming in sauce. That dish was also $22 bucks but again wasn't really worth the money.  

We finished eating and didn't even want to bother taking our left overs. So we paid and got out as quickly as possible.

First meal that i had were the 2 eggs with hashbrowns and bacon and wheat toast. Everything was good and fresh. Cannot complain about anything.

With the exception of the stock Hash Brown patties, which are shaped like small hockey pucks and are a bit 'mushy' inside. Apparently you *can* specify that they be flattened/smashed on the grill and fried up well-done, which I will try next time.

Love the Huevos Rancheros with a side of Turkey Bacon. The Huevos comes with a grilled whole Jalapeno - a delicious touch. And an entire table Thermos of coffee shows up when you order coffee.

Yes, it's never a 'cheap' meal, but the idea is that you have some sort of resort credit or players comps that you want to use here.

Fri night - Pizza, Philly sandwich, and Burger all rather tasty and they gave us extra ranch sauce to go with the breadsticks which was just as good with our food.

I wasn't too satisfied with the seaside Benedict. The dish was just too heavy. To start the crab cakes were salty, and the sauce didn't balance it out. Rather, it made it taste saltier.

This year I decided to try the Cosmopolitan, but since i was more familiar with the Aria restaurants I knew the perfect place for a late night/early morning meal. I recommended we make the short trip to Aria for the Aria Cafe (formerly Cafe Vettro).

What a disapointment!

First there were three woman at the hostess stand and they seemed too busy to acknowledge the growing line of people waiting to be seated. They had to discuss their kids, how their weekend was going, etc... before they worried about the paying customers. They eventually took down everyone's party size and we were told there was a 10 minute wait which was odd because the restaurant was 15-25% full (at the absolute most). It felt like there was no sense of urgency to provide a quality customer experience. The hostesses just walked around like they didn't really want to be there and never explained the delay in being seated. Had they been more informative regarding the delay maybe some of the people who decided to get out of the line would have stayed. I could not understand why a dang near empty restaurant had such a long wait with all of the workers I could see walking around.

Once we were seated our waiter did an excellent job of waiting on us. He was the lone bright spot during this visit. He was engaging and you could see he was hustling to make sure his tables were attended too. He alone could not save this experience though. When the food finally made it to the table it was extremely cold. I cannot understand how you can wait 20 minutes for bacon and eggs that feels like was sitting in a refrigerator.

I'm glad this cafe is open 24 hours because I plan to come back when I get a late night craving for soup or chicken tenders!  The price was reasonable for the portion and taste.

Compared to the rest of the service received during my stay at ARIA, our waitress was amazing -- friendly, fast, helpful, thoughtful and spot on.  Her name was Penny.  Ask to sit in her section when you go there.

The breakfasts were very good and tasty.  For what we paid for a less than stellar morning meal at The Wynn, this was an excellent deal.  We're in Vegas, after all.

I've been lamenting about design being chosen over function at ARIA, and unfortunately this applies to the cafe, as well.  First you walk though a Disneyland-like entry with green glass structures, and then based on where you are to be seated you walk through a Disneyland-like maze.  Tables nearest the windows -- although they provide the best view of the massive kayak/canoe piece of art (""The Big Edge"" by Nancy Rubins) -- are the farthest walk, and there is no simple, easy throughway.  So much for safety; think about how difficult this is for the servers...and the kitchen is a million miles away!  All the more reason why I want to reward the staff at Cafe Vettro and let management know that the staff here have to work harder than anywhere else to satisfy their customers.

Otherwise, it is a nice, bright and open space as far as design goes.

Note #1:  when sitting by the windows, you will have the annoying blast of floor ventilation hit your table.

Note #2:  we only ate breakfast here, but we did so three days in a row thanks to Penny.  Thanks from the ""faux-hawk"" crew in San Jose!",GpgBEengSGt1SDH67ATF8Q,0,0,4,f_F0jwFwrhIy7Wabf9FyqA

We arrived during a slow period, with only a few families in the regular line. We showed our Sky Suite pass and we were told to wait in a separate area. It took nearly twenty minutes to be seated and the line grew behind us. The women working at the hostess station were chatting amongst themselves and very slow to communicate with the people that had joined the line. They were not giving us a very good initial impression of the cafe.

The ambiance is great. The cafe is large, with high ceilings and lots of natural light. I love the desert theme, with earth tones and cactus on the patio. The wall of rocks encased in glass is very cool too.

Our server was great- warm, friendly, attentive. Service was slow, but I felt like that was a general for the entire restaurant and not a reflection of our server. 

We were starving and started with a plate of the steak nachos. It was a huge plate and the nachos were delicious. I got a club sandwich with fries and my husband had a cheeseburger. We both had iced tea. 

The food was very good, however, it was also crazy expensive for what it was. We spent around eighty dollars for our meal, that would have been fair at fifty-sixty. We live in Los Angeles, travel to Vegas frequently and have just returned from London...we are used to paying higher prices...but this was just silly.

First of all, my party of FOUR was directed to our table after a few minute wait... There were only THREE chairs and three place settings. We awkwardly stood in the middle of the restaurant until someone carried over another chair from across the room. The fact that they were so unorganized even after keeping us waiting is unacceptable for any restaurant, and very unprofessional.

I ordered the late breakfast of two eggs, sausage, and asked what their substitutions were for the hash browns and toast. This seemed a foreign concept, because our waitress had no idea. I asked if they could substitute for cottage cheese, as many other breakfast places do, and she said she'd have to ask the chef. My boyfriend ordered a hamburger minus the bun, and she couldn't perceive that idea either. Most restaurants are willing and able to make substitutions for guests. This restaurant made me feel really uncomfortable even suggesting the idea.

After all of this confusion, the service was really slow. It took ten minutes after being seated at our table for the waitress to come around to take our orders. 

The food itself was sad. My thirteen dollar meal could have been better put together by McDonald's. I tasted my BF's burger. It may have been one of the most unappetizing ground beef patties I've ever tasted. It was overcooked, hard, and bland, except for a chemically smoke taste. My poor honey suffered through that, for $15 no less. My BFF had the biscuits and gravy, and left half of her meal. She NEVER leaves half of her meal. 

I happened to remember the price of what everyone ordered (probably because it was so high for what you get), which was a good thing, because the price on the menu was not consistent with the charge on the bill. Apparently they recently changed the menus, so the prices increased, but we all ordered off of old menus. Either way, the manager was unhelpful and unapologetic fixing their mistake. That type of attitude is not what I expect in a premier Aria restaurant.

Please, Aria... PLEASE clean house in that restaurant and hire competent management, an interested head chef, and well-trained wait staff. The facility is so gorgeous and needs to be appreciated with cuisine complimenting its beauty, not distracting us from the unacceptable service and food.",JiqUeiXgugNrmvJEOx7NyA,11,5,1,fRktQJGJ-Q8DF4KRf_6q8Q

Context:  3 people
                 $60.00
                 3 breakfasts and 2 coffees

I understand, Las Vegas food can be pricey.  It is a new bougie casino, and a bougie cafe.  That price is totally reasonable.  Until you bring out McDonald's style hash brown patties with my omelette.  An omelette which has velveeta or kraft singles on it.  AND IN IT.  When a Denver Omelette costs me $17.00 dollars, you can afford to put some REAL FREAKING CHEESE ON IT.  Or you can hold the cheese. I don't care, but I didn't eat that shit when I was 7, and I am sure as hell not eating it now.  And you can make some real potatoes, or at least edible potatoes.  As a server, when two out of the three people have not taken more than 2 bites each, and are NOT looking hung over, you should ask if the food was ok, or if there was something wrong.  

We didn't eat, paid, and then proceeded to warn anyone walking in.  The only decent meal that came was fruit and yogurt, which does not say a whole lot.  Seriously, if ARIA Cafe management reads this, buy some damn cheese and potatoes.  Hire someone who makes an edible menu.  Stop being terrible, or at least charge the normal amount for fake cheese and shit potatoes, which according to my last stop at McDonald's, should cost about $5.00 for breakfast.",8nqcdY9b-zolA3DgfeHSxw,3,1,1,Q63d0ENTuiiDckM5Kwve0Q

No wait but the place was about 4/5 full. Everyone was very friendly and the service was prompt. This was the EDC weekend so every resort was full. We were hesitant to come when we checked Yelp as it said 2/5 stars. Glad we came anyway. Such a great place. Not sure about other reviewer's experiences, but we had a wonderful time. Not cheap to be sure as it is Vegas after all. Long gone are the days of cheap food to lure people to vegas

We had some great food. 

Classic eggs Benedict:  my lovely wife LOVES eggs Benny. She said it was very very good. She loved the lemon flavor which she said is the first time she has ever liked it in eggs Benny. She usually prefers a no lemon flavor Benny but loved it in this version. 


I had the Huevous Ranchero: wow this was awesome. When we checked in we ask what was the most popular items. We were wold by the very pleasant and friendly hostesses that the eggs Benedict and the huevous Ranchero were the best. They were so right. Mine was a delicious combo of over easy egg, crispy Tortillas, beans and a favorable sauce. I ate the whole thing. So, so good. 

I also had the Mixed berries: very fresh. I had some half and half with mine which really boosted it up over the top. 

Coffee: the lovely wife said 'it's fine, totally fine'

Avocado with olive oil and sea salt: my beautiful wife said 'I really liked it.'

I ordered the chicken Caesar salad (approx 15-16 dollars). The salad was actually decent, chicken was cooked perfectly for the salad. Unfortunately paying $20 (including tax and gratuity) for a salad is not on my to-do bucket list in Las Vegas.

Service was lacking especially, considering the few tables that were eating there. I saw many service employees just standing idly by doing nothing.

My friends and I decided to come here to grab a bite to eat after clubbing at XS, as this was right in our hotel and we were all too tired to go elsewhere. We got to the front of the restaurant and there was no one there (it was around 3 or 4 am but hey, it's supposed to be opened 24 hours), so we walked in and found ourselves some seats. After we sat down, one of the waiters came and told us we couldn't sit there and had to sit at the other side of the restaurant. Okay fine, even though the entire restaurant was almost empty, we move to the other side as they instructed. 

We then had to wait for a good 10 minutes before we got any service at all. We didn't even have menus so we just requested water for everyone first. Another 10 minutes pass, the waiter comes back with the menus but no water so we ask for it again. Literally yet another 20 minutes later, we finally get our water. We have all just gotten back from a night of partying and are dehydrated, so we are very annoyed at this point because we had to wait over 30 minutes JUST for a glass of water. 

Finally after scanning through the menus, we order our food. I shared one of the pastas and a pizza with two other friends (I forgot which ones they were and can't find the menu online.) The pasta wasn't too bad actually, but for $15? Not worth it. It was just pasta and sauce. Not an especially large portion either. There's an option to add meat, but it's another $3-5 dollars. The pizza was even more of a rip off. It sounded really appetizing on the menu, but when the actual pizza came, it was just a small personal sized pizza with a few pieces of chopped vegetables. Completely unsatisfying. 

When it was time for us to pay, the waiter told us that he was only able to take a maximum of 3 credit cards, so we all rummage through our purses and pockets for whatever cash we had left, and put down 3 credit cards to split the bill. The waiter then comes back and tells us that he can only take 2 credit cards because they're only allowed to 3 transactions, and cash counts as one. He didn't make this clear to us earlier and my friend straight out asks him ""do you want to get paid or not?"" but really, why is it so difficult to pay at this place? 

By the way, it took him about 10 minutes to bring us the bill after we asked for it and another 10 for him to come back and get it, and yet another 10 to bring it back to us. We pretty much just sat there waiting for 30 minutes after finishing our meal.

With the same amount of money that I spent, I would rather take a taxi to a mcdonald's off the strip and order off of the $1 menu. The service would probably be better and quicker there too.",bFTAqXR2-BcHsYoJ2O82JQ,1,0,1,2wjSTVivw6BrJWUCnO8cEw

There were five of the six girls that stuck with me after Haze. Some wanted chinatown, some wanted steak & eggs.. We ended up here because our heels were killing us, haha.

Anyway! It took us a while to find the entrance, but since we went up the escalators after Haze we saw people that were sitting in the caf√©. We walked through the back & the servers quickly told us that we went the wrong way. They directed us to the host stand, where the hostess was PRETENDiNG to be busy & clean menus. We apologized to her & tried joking around but she never lifted her head or looked at us until somebody else sat us, which was a good 3-4 minutes. Believe me people, I have been a hostess for a solid two years at a fine dining restaurant that offers late night menu on the weekends until 2am & I've had my share of working with those RUDE hostesses that are purposely give attitude or can't do your job & greet your guests. I believe that you should try to act as professional as you can, no matter how late it is or how crappy your day/night is (sorry mini rant! lol). Other than the stupid hostess, our server was perfectly fine.

The caf√© is very modern & spacious. The utensils were awesome, I wanted to take them home & blow bubbles with them! The round table we had was against the wall in the left side of the restaurant. Some of the tables in the middle of the caf√© were set higher & it almost reminded me of a fancy library :P It could be a bad thing, but I thought just about everything in the restaurant looked neat. 

Three of the girls ordered omelets, eggs benedict, philly cheesesteak (looked tasty btw) & I ordered the oriental chicken salad. The salad was a good amount for $15, I ended up taking it home because it was too much for me at 4am haha. The bill for five people was $86, so I would say most of the items in the menu are $13-20. It was what I was expecting because it is on the strip & we couldn't decide on where to eat anyway :) I'll probably be back again late at night to try out that cheesesteak! yum yum",VomrqwTbz1hxmZpL69u5XQ,1,2,3,EcK4CrJt1EbF9ZCqs78j4g

Well my husband and I returned here just last weekend and I again ordered the nachos with steak. Don't get me wrong, the nachos were really good. The steak was cooked medium rare to my liking but it didn't blow me away. I expected amazing-ness and received this message from my taste buds, ""eh, they're pretty good.""

Steak and Eggs: the steak is flat-iron grilled and can be chewy or tender depending on how one slices the meat. Medium rare came out between medium rare and medium.

I had scrambled eggs with bacon and some hash browns and my girlfriend had a grilled salmon which looked very nice and our friend ordered a tomato basil soup with a side order of sweet potato fries!

Its funny that people always complain about the prices whenever they choose to eat at any restaurant inside a hotel on the Strip. People, you know Vegas is pricey to begin with. If you are going to complain about the prices, then go eat at the McDonalds or a taco truck downtown. Seriously, Vegas is all about spending money.

It is kind of a disappointment that they don't serve all of their food options 24 hours a day like some other places, but you deal with what you have. 

The food here is pretty pricey, and I guess it is because it matches the kind of clientele the Aria caters to. I came here late night with one of my coworkers and with the amount of money we make, it kind of broke our bank with entrees ranging from 15-25 dollars, late night. Their late night menu is pretty limited and I hoped for breakfast at least so we could get their red velvet pancakes that they promote, but it wasn't available at 2am. I got their deuces wild which gave a pretty good amount of food, but it was $20 and I felt like you wouldn't get your money's worth with everything else on the menu. Everything came out as expected, except their hash browns come out in the form of little cakes and they taste different than conventional hash browns. It could get some getting use to, and I personally prefer the taste of conventional hash browns over the ones they offered here. Their pancakes were probably the best tasting item coming out nice and fluffy. 

Overall, if you are staying at the Aria, it is one of the places you have access to eat inside of the hotel, but if you aren't staying here, unless you try one of their specialty items, I don't believe it is worth coming here.

- Food came out cold: unacceptable at this caliber restaurant but since its newly opened more so that I told waiter and he pretty much just said an uncaring ""oh"" unpaired with an apology or offer to fix it
- Asked for sparking cava only one on menu and waiter said huh and had to study the menu (which only has a few wines by the glass) for several minutes
- Croque Madame: most boring tasteless white bread ever, cheese not melted, bechamel congealed and cakey (ham was good however)
- Steak frites: tiny portion and we solely ordered it for the poutine (gravy cheese fries) and only when it was being set on our table an hour layer the waiter said they don't have curds yet. Meat was just passable and gravy was all globby.

I understand the place was only 2 days old but some things like decent service shouldn't be that hard to offer especially at a locale that us aiming to be upscale. At the very least admit to the mistakes and thank guests for their patience. I doubt I'll be back.",aD-rsDe2S0e7jTkYD6ULaQ,4,3,1,JVUVxuZKfsT70fN_YHcdXQ

I had been coming to Cafe Vetro since the open in 2009. I loved it for late night snacks or when I was just feeling lazy and wanted to stay in my own hotel to eat something simple. I just came back from my trip to Vegas and was not pleased by the changes that had been made to Cafe Vetro. First of all WHY would you change the name it was a landmark. Secondly the pricing has become OUTRAGEOUS. I paid $7.50 for one glass of orange juice with 0 refills. I could not believe this. For a cup of black coffee $5.00. For a sandwich with fries $18.00. If this was an upscale restaurant I would be okay with these prices but lets face it this is robbery. Aria please lower the prices at Aria Cafe or you will not only lose me as a customer but every other sane person that might ever go back.,Ka2VMEwLf_uZuRAxGSRZlg,1,0,1,3SuaHRvU98bpVnsBCFBavQ

FOOD:
1) Salmon with saffron rice and asparagus with mango dressing
2) Sausage and mushroom pizza

The salmon was good, but not worth the price since the only tasty part of it was the mango dressing. The saffron rice was the standout of the dish.

It's definitely not an upscale dining experience, and the food was okay.

My sandwich was a bit tasteless (it might be because of my ""trying to be healthy"" intentions - but still...)  The steak&eggs was bit better, but very overpriced.

The bread was fresh and artfully presented.  My friend ordered tea to help with her hangover, and she was near obsessed with the smell of their mint tea - at least we enjoyed that part...

For the quality of the food and service, it is a tad bit overpriced.  However, the portions are fairly large.

Despite the poor Yelp reviews, we chose this place to eat as we were looking for a late-night dining spot and had Aria resort credit to blow.  I had no idea that two hours of dining could be so eventful.

Experience #1: One of the bus boys dropped an entire tray of plates, silverware, and glasses and glass went flying.  The entire restaurant went silent afterward.  They promptly cleaned it up.

Experience #2: Waiter brought every one's food except mine.  He asked me if he had forgotten something and I thought he was joking as he'd been joking around with my group the whole night.  No he really did forget to place the order for my entree.  Yikes.

Experience #3 and this takes the cake: 30 minutes or so after the loud crashing of plates came a loud thud and a blood curling scream for help.  One of the waitresses had a seizure and collapsed on the ground.  The paramedics came shortly and assisted her.  I hope she's fine.  The entire restaurant fell silent again.

Experience #4: About 15 minutes after the paramedics carried her out on a stretcher, there was sounds of breaking glass and plates AGAIN!  That same bus boy dropped every thing once more.

The food was just so so.  I ordered an omelet and it's hard to mess that up.  My other friends said the food could have been better especially for the price.  Also, the waiter had said at the beginning of the meal that he'd bring a bread basket but he didn't.  After all the events, we didn't remember until after we had paid and were walking out of the restaurants.  Ooops.....too late.

It was also ridiculously cold inside.  Yes Las Vegas may be a desert and hot outside but it's not necessary to turn us into popsicles.",-y5p3QWc-NROgfQWd9jc1Q,1,0,1,Na-625wB4ZIgMkXPODh2Pg

Wifey and I decided to grab breakfast here since we were staying at the Aria. This is one of the few times I didn't check the Yelp reviews and I should have.

First impressions were impeccable, spacious and gorgeous. The architecture was modern, open, sleek and almost looked like a club. It's nicely located in front of the hotel and you have an unobstructed view of the porte-cochere with its large glass windows. 

However, looks can be deceiving. Most of the people that were working here appeared to be on the verge of retirement and all lack life. What I mean by that is they were moody, slow and grumpy. No one smiled even when they were taking our orders and they were all just going thru the motion like robots or slaves. I guess those are harsh words, but it really felt like the staff came from a nursing home. 

So I ordered the Steak and Eggs while the Wifey had omelette with a side of coffee for the both of us. The coffee was bland and weak and my Steak and Eggs left a lot to be desired. I've had better at Denny's compared to this place. Wifey's omelette was just so-so. 

No, we weren't impressed, but what made it memorable for us was Hunter Pence. Yup, this was after they won the 2012 World Series and he was sitting behind us. We got to take a photo with him while I was wearing my Niners' gear. Funny thing was that I was all decked in Giants' gear the previous day.

First, the service:  Although the servers were trying hard and appeared sincere and willing to please, it seems like they weren't properly trained just yet. Multiple people came over to ask is what we'd like to drink so it seemed almost like there wasn't any one person responsible for getting our drinks. Then halfway through our meal our server came 3 times to tell us he was leaving his shift and that someone else was taking over and then proceeded to introduce us to the person taking over. That was fine until they stood at our table and continued to discuss how the transfer of service was going to go down. 

Food:  ordered the croque Madame. Horrible. In particular the sauce was this grainy pasty bland tasting glue, and it was all spilled over this very oily sandwich which totally turned me off. 

We may go back some day when they get things right but probably not anytime soon.

I love Las Vegas, and consider myself almost a resident there =D  I have to say that I was pretty disappointed at Cafe Vettro.

As others have pointed out, decor is great... but then again, now that I think about it, it better be as the place is new.  Everything else is mediocre at best.  Food was ""meh"", service was questionable, and price point was unattractive considering food and service qualities.

One thing they DID get right was to ask for my ID when I paid via room charge.. unlike some place over at Vdara as I had a fraudulent charge.

I suggest that you go elsewhere for food... it's a huge casino/hotel, so there are other options.",_Dd2uxnhcEKzrv0VPVnxFA,1,1,2,dxTBYg_J4WBf2Pe0wQJ-qg

Waited about 20 minutes for a table and took another 15 minutes before ordering. But I was OK with the wait since they were probably understaffed on Xmas Day but the following irked me:

Orange Juice in the menu said fresh squeezed but it was definitely Minute Maid w pulp! I did not appreciate the bait & switch especially at $7.50.

I was served coffee in a dirty cup, which the busser insisted it was the design. Then our server came and said ""oh, your cup is dirty, let me change it"" o_O I already drank out of it... 

Fish & Chips @ $22 - the fries were soggy and fish was overdone and definitely pre frozen.

The only good thing was the 3 egg breakfast & sausage. I thought it was a good value at $14 since we pay more at other places. The sausage was delicious.

For a bill of about $60, I rather eat at Bouchon or Mon Ami Gabi next time for better quality dishes and even better service.",fk0U1yLy8woJ87LpIkgU4g,0,0,1,R8Bg2EHHK3NX1JdDAi1Vqw

It's hard to say how good the food was because at that time, we all were starving and would have eaten anything placed in front of us. However, the service that we got was great. The waitress gave us extra glasses of water to help us hydrate and was attentive to us when we took a break from laughing hysterically at what happened the previous night.

My boyfriend and I decided to eat here for brunch at the end of our trip before we left Vegas. We chose this place because the Aria had a large photo of their red velvet pancakes on the wall connecting the parking structure and the hotel. The photo looked really good so I wanted to order it.

We did have to wait for 10-15 mins in line before we got seated. It is definitely a large restaurant and not really a cafe. All of the tables looked packed and there there lots of servers running around the very busy restaurant. One server promptly took our drink orders and told us that our server would be with us soon. Our server was very nice. I ordered the red velvet pancakes, eggs, and a side of hash browns. She suggested that I get the small order of pancakes since it would be a lot of food. I appreciated that she made that suggestion instead of trying to get me to order everything. 

The red velvet pancakes are really good. They were fluffy, sweet, and topped with cream cheese sauce and chocolate chips. It was REALLY rich, so rich that I couldn't finish the stack of two pancakes with my side orders.

This time, we met our out-of-town friends there for a breakfast send-off before they went to the airport. It was strange, because we had several waiters, but none of them were very attentive.

Drink-wise, this was breakfast, and that meant mimosas and bloody marys. The ""spicy bloody mary"" my wife ordered wasn't terribly spicy, and tasted mostly of the olive garnish. My mimosa would have been acceptable, except it was made with PULPY orange juice. Sick! They lose a full star for that one.

For food, I ordered the country fried steak and my wife got the huevos rancheros. Her huevos was decent - it had a great deal of avocado which is always a plus. My CFS could've stood to be more tender, and the gravy would've benefited from more flavor. The country fried steak skillet at Egg & I is way better and half the price.

What? The whole process took more than 50 mins, the food was just mediocre but the price was on the upper side, now I would imagine a place with this price point in this fancy hotel would have a decent service

THE BEST EGGS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I can't explain it, but the eggs are simply incredible. We even went back to the next morning to make sure it wasn't a fluke, and the eggs were the same level of amazing. I asked the manager if they did anything special, he said the only special thing is that they use organic eggs. 

The service was nice, the staff was very friendly and promptly refilled drinks. For the Diet Coke fans out there, who can notice the difference when Diet Coke from the fountain is good or great, this place is the best. They mix it perfectly!

As for the atmosphere, Cafe Vettro has a very earthy and open feeling to it. There are sections with smooth river rocks behind clear plastic, giving a riverbed feel, while the opposite side of this large restaurant has large vertical glass panels with water patterns flowing down.

I am so blown away by how terribly horrible this restaurant is run.
We walked in, it was not busy at all, on a Wednesday and we had to wait fifteen minutes for water ( our drinks) we almost walked out while waiting for the drinks and we should have, if only we had known how bad the food would be and the fact that we were there for an hour and a half as they messed up our meals and had to wait a ridiculous long time to have them re made.

My crab benidect was actually pretty good but it was delivered to me cold.
For a cold seafood benidect it was pretty good, well besides the sauce being congealed and my potatoes also, yes, guess what? Being raw.
After the waitress took my boyfriends cold potatoes away to be re made my boyfriend and I were beyond starving, we had been waiting an hour for our food at that point!! So we began eating my potatoes... And they were half raw too! I had terrible stomach cramps all afternoon and I'm sure it was from eating raw potatoes! I'm lucky I did not get more sick!!
It took our waitress twenty minutes at least to bring my boyfriends corn beef breakfast back to him and when she did the potatoes were all burned!
They were literally so hard we could have broken a tooth! And to make it worse there was hardly any corned beef at all!
He actually had to order toast after that because his meal was inedible!
When we complained that the food was not edible the waitress said ""Well my manager said I can comp you the toast""
Seriously? What an insult. His meal was inedible for the most part; the management should have comped his whole meal.
The manager was aware of this entire situation and he should have come by our table and apologized for the terrible food.
It is absolutely ridiculous how poorly this restaurant is managed.
If it's like this on a week day I can only imagine how terrible it would be during the week!

My husband and I stayed at Aria recently to celebrate 32 years together. We had breakfast at the Caf√© twice, and a late supper one night. 

One morning I had a Greek omelet, potatoes, toast, bacon, coffee and OJ, the other morning we both had scrambled eggs, etc ... The breakfasts were fine. 

The late supper was a Greek salad.  The salads were large and filling even without adding chicken or shrimp. There were big chunks of Feta cheese, artichoke hearts, a couple of stuffed grape leaves, and the dressing was good.  No real complaints there. 

The service was a bit on the slow side but it's always entertaining to people-watch in Vegas while waiting for your meal. I thought the atmosphere was cool. I loved the natural materials and the soaring space in front of the glass walls. It's a little pricey but not outrageously so.

It took some time to be seated just because we were a party of 12, but the overall service was great. Our drinks were constantly refilled and the food tasted great. We made two more visits there just because it was so convenient. 

Chicken Nachos: ENORMOUS and yummy. They load it with sour cream, cheese, guacamole, jalapenos, olives (could do without, not a fan of olives), salsa and chunks of chicken. Enough toppings for all the chips. Ordered this every single time.

Calamari: It was average, bland, not the best. I shouldn't have had high expectations since it was an American restaurant. A plus was they included slices of lemon and a dipping sauce. 

Southern Style Fried Chicken: Included a buttered biscuit, mashed potatoes, country gravy and corn on the cob. I'm a fried chicken type of girl, so when my dish came...I couldn't have been any happier. Chicken was juicy, biscuit melted in your mouth, the gravy complimented the mashed potatoes and the corn was sweet.

Recommend: Nachos, Fried Chicken, Tuna Melt, Angus Burger, Biscuits and Gravy, BLT

Avoid: Pasta Carbonara, Philly Cheesesteak, Meatloaf

We were told 15 minutes wait time but it was 5 minutes. Service was fantastic. Kudos to Regina who took care of our every needs and didn't push any items on us. Hubby got the steak and eggs and made me try his steak, he said it was too good to pass up and it was delicious. I got the Deuces Wild (eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, toast and pancakes) and a side of avocado. Avocado was absolutely perfect - it's hard to find a good one, am I right? I got the pancakes for my hubby who lives for them but is a huge critic. He thought they were amazing. I forgot to take pictures but we will be back before we leave and I will post then. Regina even gave us coffee to go. I guess some people think it's overpriced but considering that our bellies were HAPPILY full and it is a hotel restaurant in Vegas, I thought it was very reasonable.

Most restaurants charge an additional 'split plating fee' which is questionable, as I was expecting the worse, so if you think about it, they deliberately split the steak & eggs on separate plates, as well as the pineapple & nicely-done hash browns, wow, that's extra work.

The sirloin itself is 8 ounces, and not as good as the day before at Cafe Bellagio, but still worth eating as oppose to a buffet or a sandwich place if one isn't in the mood for it.  The cut was a bit on the thin side but hey, for $25 or whatever, not a big issue.

Decor, wow, this seemed like a zen place.  Super high ceiling, full blown glass wall, trees everywhere, and cool booth seating on the inner side.

Very modern with large windows throughout the restaurant, thus providing enough natural  lighting for most of the restaurant. The furniture is also modern like with comfortable chairs, quartz table tops, and posh benches around the booths.

Now for the food. I thinks it's mediocre at best. The first time I ordered their Deuce Breakfast. It had two of everything such as eggs, toast, sausage, and bacon, pancakes, with my coffee. I thought the breakfast was a bit on the pricey side. The quality and what was served for $16.00 plus my coffee. The food was more on the bland side. Yes, the eggs and my sausage wasn't too good. The bacon was good, but had too much fat in it. 

The second time there, I ordered their Spaghetti and Meatballs. I think that order was $20.00. Again I didn't think it was worth it. Proportion wise was fine. Enough for an individual to be content. However, the whole dish was bland. Tasteless sauce, and flavorless meatballs had me use plenty of salt and Parmesan Cheese for the spaghetti. I finished it only because I was hungry and didn't want to drink alcohol later with an empty stomach.

Overall the cafe was a really nice place. The service was decent, while the food took around fifteen minutes. The waiter and waitress kept filling our glass with water and asked if everything was okay. They were nice! But the quality of the food needs to improve.

On Monday (Labor Day), we decided to walk to Aria and check out the casino.  We stumbled upon Caf√© Vettro & decided to stop for lunch.  They weren't super busy so we were seated right away.  The hostess was friendly and so was our waitress.

My fianc√© ordered a Reuben sandwich and it came w/fries.  I had a few small bites myself. Loved it!  I admit it was sauce overload but the taste was not overpowering.  I usually ask for 'no sauce' or 'sauce on the side' with sandwiches because I don't like my bread soggy and I'm not a fan of mayo.

I ordered the Grilled Salmon which is accompanied with asparagus but I asked for a substitution so I got green beans instead.  I was very pleased w/my salmon, it was delicious and bigger than I expected. The mango salsa topped it off perfectly.

-1 star because they took forever to bring out our food but this was because the chef made my dish w/asparagus.  Our waitress said she asked him to prepare a new dish so he cooked an entirely new salmon.

+1 star because she gave us a complimentary dish of fruits.  This held us over until our meal arrived.  The meals also came with a variety of bread and breadsticks.

the caption to the two-star rating lays it out perfectly. You really would expect more out of this highly stylish and modern cafe located in the newest hotel in Vegas, Aria at citycenter.

Cafe Vettro features high ceilings with floor to ceiling glass windows. Windows were complimented with exposed steel beams, and plenty of glass and stone decor throughout. This gorgeous cafe however, is brought down by the food which i can't speak as highly about.

I came here for breakfast and ordered their $16 omelette. For double the price of an omelette (with one less ingredient choice) than that of the Grand Lux Cafe at the Venetian, I expected it to be twice as good. Unfortunately this was not the case. The omelette was lackluster to say the least.. The cheese was a single slice layed out on top which left the inside of the omelette feeling very dry and tasting rather bland.

Coffee was an extra $4.50. Double the price of what you'd pay for a Venti coffee at Starbuck's. I don't mind this, but what turned me off about this was that our waitress brought me a cup, and left the thermal pot at our table. While this had a certain level of convenience, it lacked the personal touch and required attentiveness  most cafes and diners offer when our waitress returns to inquire if we'd like a refill. 

So overall while the ambiance was easy on the eyes, my wallet had a hard time justifying the $25 price tag for a boring omelette, and a less than personal experience. Next time we're just going to go to Denny's.",w_aSpcXhoJkgSnsrakNGUg,0,0,2,5k8ibeC_Y-XCP9qq2FuNSQ

4655372,2016-06-17,6,TVbVii4EUQt9DG7y698zIw,"The Aria Cafe is the 24 hour cafe (or diner) of the Aria Hotel and City Center. It is located in the back of the casino to the left of the hotel registration. 

  I have caught Aria Cafe's act two times. The first time we ate here was in 2010 when we were staying at the Aria after my brother's laser surgery and yesterday when my brother and I met up with my New York bound Aunt who had checked out of the Aria. The common denominator of both visits was that we needed to dine by the Aria. 

   The contemporary ambiance of the Aria permeates into the Aria Cafe. So do the high prices. Considering that this is an MGM-owned restaurant it comes as no shock that the prices are inflated. The average sandwich costs $17.99 and up. This included the Philly cheese steak that I ordered. 

   Although ""aria"" means solo in an opera, here it could mean a solo menu page. The menu is only one page. The good is that deciding what to eat is not overwhelming. The bad is the want of a variety of food. 

  Throughout the dinner, the waitress was attentive and professional. She took the initiative to refill the drinks. Furthermore she did not rush us out when my brother and I were talking to our Aunt after dinner. 

  Prior to the meal, the waitress placed a bowl of complimentary house bread on the table. The Philly cheese steak was good. For $18 I expected it to be good. My picture below the review, shows a medium size sandwich overflowing with the sliced steak and melted American cheese. The picture also shows a Philly cheese steak without toppings such as onions and mushrooms. The Philly cheese steak included French fries and a pickle slice. The waitress delivered the bowl of French fries a few minutes after the sandwich. In similar style to the Philly cheese steak, it was good yet short of great. 

  When I review places on the Strip two questions come to mind. 1. Would I visit this business if it was off the Strip? 2. Is this a business that provides a unique experience? 

1. Would I visit Aria Cafe if it was off the Strip? Absolutely not. The prices are inflated. The menu is limited missing the variety of choices that a great cafe or diner offers. The Philly cheese steak was nothing special. If I want a delicious Philly cheese steak in Henderson Miller's Ale House serves them. If I want a delicious South Chicago cheese steak that is similar to Philly cheese steak in Las Vegas Chicago Brewing Pub serves a delicious one. 

2. Does the Aria Cafe provide a unique experience? Not really. I feel that if the Aria had a strong theme like Paris or Venetian, it would be a unique experience. However, if you are spending a lot of time at the Aria on a Las Vegas vacation partying, clubbing, or chilling it could be a unique experience to a Las Vegas visitor. 

  Based on my two first hand experiences at the Aria Cafe with the answers to the two above questions, I rate Aria Cafe three stars.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,16,10,3,t3zwuaq_XEmWy6l7c2oiIg

Okay, the food was decent, I give it that. But omg overpriced for what it was. 

He got 2 eggs, 2 sausage, hash browns, and orange juice and I had an omelette with the hash browns. 

Okay, so it took forever for our food to come out, the waiter made us feel uncomfortable, and even though it was nice and spacious, it ended up making us feel like we were eating in an airport. 

Our bill was $45 for breakfast. Felt robbed because the service and the food we ordered did not feel like it lived up to the $45 bill. 

The omelette was delicious though. Perfect for my hangover. But I think it's overpriced by maybe a lot.

He then came back and said the manager approved that there was a hair in her food and we would not be charged for her food. Overall, I thought steak and eggs for $18+ (i believe thats how much I paid for it) would be ""heaven"" but it was just food to hold me over to the morning. Steak was ok but a little chewy and slightly over cooked.

We have definitely run into a few bad experiences, but for the most part we have had great experiences as well, which is why I am giving it 3 stars. 

Since we go so often, we actually have a waitress that we request everytime. Her name is Beth and she is great. We HATE going to the cafe if she isn't there. Even if we stay at other hotels in Vegas, we always like to make the trip to Aria Cafe to see Beth! She is the only 5-star rating I would give! She is so personable and remembers us each time! It is always a pleasure to see her. 

The food is really good too. I can honestly say I have no issues with it. We generally only eat breakfast there...their sausages are so freaking good!!  

There have been a few bad encounters though. One time, we couldn't get seated (at 6:00am) because the nightclub people were priority?! Ridiculous. One time we were seated and forgotten completely for about 20 minutes. This was pre-Beth days. And then the waitress got mad at us for being upset that WE waited for 20 minutes!! It was so unreal.

The sandwich was good but nothing special. The choices for sides are either fries (something I'm not a huge fan of) or what I like to call ""mayonnaise salads"" - coleslaw or potato salad. Gross.

My friend ordered orange juice with her meal and they charged her $7.50 a glass! Just for juice! I don't care that it's ""fresh"", that's insane for a ""cafe"" type restaurant in Vegas.

Thank goodness we didn't read the review before going here. All of us enjoyed this place.

We all can complain about the prices but when it comes to cafes in Las Vegas the prices here at Caf√© Vettro are comparable to the Grand Lux Caf√© (very noisy), Raffles Caf√© (Mandalay Bay), the Coffee Shop (Treasure Island), the one in Wynn (forgot the name lol), etc.

The ambience and d√©cor is awesome here. The glass design is sexy haha. Too bad the view is not of the strip and this would have been awesome. You can talk to your friends/family/date easily without screaming the top of your lungs due to the casino noise. Unless, you come here and sitting near drunkards lol.

The only thing annoying was our first waitress who insisted we get the special which was steak and glasses of wine blah blah blah... The next waitress who took over was very friendly and refilled our water whenever it was close to empty.

We ended up getting chicken tenders, pepperoni sausage pizza, fish and chips and tomato soup for a party of 5. The fish and chips were amazing. I love the tartar sauce.

Caf√© Vettro and Yellowtail (Bellagio) are both the new food hot spots I enjoyed during my August stay in Vegas.

They were thick pieces of chicken, which in their favor they're not trying to skimp you as you are paying $19 for the dish (it is Vegas, after all), but almost too thick for the dish as now you have bland and thick chicken to chew down.

Attending a conference here in the Aria hotel in Las Vegas, NV I decided to stop in for breakfast at the Aria Caf√©.  The caf√© had a nice appearance, atmosphere and appeared to be well maintained.  Overall, everything was good or better except for the prices.

I had a glass of orange juice ($8) and for my breakfast entr√©e, I ordered the ""Deuces Wild"" plate ($20) which consisted of eggs, sausage, rectangular hash browns and pancakes.  The eggs were cooked perfectly as was the sausage.  The hash browns were a bit bland as well as rectangularish.  The pancakes were simply marvelous.  They were light, fluffy and just totally delicious.

When I placed my order, the waitress asked if I would like sliced strawberries or bananas on top of my pancakes.  I don't normally go for any weird or crazy stuff on my pancakes, but then I thought that since I had a choice of either that I would get the strawberries and just eat them off as a side item.  When I got the bill I was shocked to see a $4 charge for the sliced strawberries.  Outraged, I kept my anger inside and saved it for later.  I paid the $4 without complaint but I did think that the offer of the berries without being told of an extra charge nor anything on the menu to indicate such was deceptive and unwarranted.

The cafe itself looks really nice and would lead you to believe it is expensive so of course the food had to be good....not today, might have just been the afternoon chefs at the time or something they normally do to all their food, but they use a lot of oil when they cook.
I ordered the seared trout, and that thing was smothered with oil under, I had to keep drinking water, even the green beans that were on top were really oily. One of my friends had orderd some hash browns, although they came out extra crispy the way they like it, it was also drenched in oil. Onf of my friend's medium rare steak came out pretty damn well.

5038545,2013-02-07,0,TVbVii4EUQt9DG7y698zIw,"Having no breakfast plans on Sunday morning, we decided to mosey on over to Cafe Vettro from the Vdara.  From the exterior it seemed promising, and since the line was long, I figured there was a reason for its popularity.  We were in no rush so we decided to brave the line.  Unlike many other Vegas hotel cafes that are very efficient, the line moved painfully slow not to mention, the exit situation was a mess so EVERY TIME someone left, they had to maneuver through the long line.  Since the line was moving so slow, I made the (WRONG) assumption that it must be totally full and didn't get my panties in a wad.  However, after the hostess sat us, I looked around and noticed that at least 1/3 or more of the tables were totally empty and clean.  So either they were understaffed or just plain didn't know how to manage large numbers of people even though the restaurant clearly had the capacity to do so.

The environment is nice, huge windows that provide great natural lighting and a decent people watching view.  The decor is modern but already worn and somewhat haggard looking which was a surprise given how new this resort it.  

We ordered Bloody Mary's that were the equivalent of  what you would be served as a complimentary drink at the penny slots on Fremont Street, flavorless, small, and unappealing to the eye, topped with a green olive that had the taste and texture of a wet sponge.  I wouldn't have minded all that much other that they were $10 a piece!!!!  

We both ordered the huevos rancheros, not terribly bad but absolutely NOT worth $18 per order!  I was fine with the order being on the smaller side, but for $18 I expect at least a little flavor.

The next day, we dined at the Bellagio cafe for breakfast and our bill came out to be exactly the same price as our dining experience at Cafe Vettro.  We ordered similar things, 2 Bloody Mary's and two southwest omelets....The difference?  Our meal at Bellagio was fresh, tasty, and well worth the price. Not to mention, the line was twice as long and we waited less than half the time we did at Cafe Vettro.

I suggest that Cafe Vettro do one of two things...increase the quality of what you are serving or decrease your prices.  You can't get away with charging Bellagio prices without delivering Bellagio quality.",lCYC5Ei9tIFBaW1AQfRu7A,2,1,2,8HbP4UupQY0QmdhUIegS7g

I came here with my 2 young sons for dinner while mommy was out on the strip at a well known ""adult"" restaurant with our friends. First-the hostess was very pleasant and in a very good mood as she seated us. Our server Ron was spectacular! He treated my young sons with respect and paid attention to them as they ordered their own dinners. They really felt grown up having dinner with daddy because Ron treated them as adults. 

The menu is vast and almost diner like. Between us we had the cheese burger, grilled cheese and foot long hot dog (yes-it is a foot long). They were all fresh, tasted good and presented well. They came with chips or fries. The pricing was actually a little less that I would have expected from a top notch hotel restaurant even with ordinary dishes.

Bottom line-If you need a less expensive, less fancy place for a meal, this is the place.

I got Steak and Eggs which was a flatiron steak with roasted tomato and fennel, egg, and a potato galette. Okay, the flat iron was good but lacked seasoning and my whole dish was cold but I was effing hungry, had a lot to drink and tired so I didnt complain but it got past the point where it wasn't acceptable- was not warm, cold meaning room temperature...The table and the galette were the same temp.

Uncle had a soup and had to send back 3 times as it was cold. The 3rd time he said just stick it in a microwave on high and please don't bring it til it's uncomfortable to hold. 

BF got a croque madame. Pretty decent, but Bouchon's croque is the tastiest and it's hard to be objective....still it was probably the most consistent and warmest dish we had. It was on the salty side but decent enough. Fries were ok.

Stepdad had a chicken caesar and it wasnt that great dressing and dry chicken breast on top. 

4 drinks and 4 meals- $90 + not including tip. Not satisfied at all aside from filling an empty belly. It didn't hit that comfort feeling which late night eats should make you feel so you can end the day happy.

They arent ""stepping it up"" at City Center and it's gonna be a flop as none of my family and friends (I have many that visit) will stay at a pretty but subpar place...it makes ME look bad too if they dont have an amazing experience. I'm not having that....we'll hook em up at the Venetian/Palazzo instead! . I tried to sway them to not eat in Aria since we knew of spots that guaranteed would satisfy but I got handled into here for convenience. They thought I was exaggerating saying whats the worse that can happen?. Good thing the fault isn't on me on this one- visitors fault and my stepdad said I'm ""right"" for once. 

2.5 stars. The area is nice and it's right above a club so convenient location, the menus appeal is nice by reading it out loud but dismal standard control on food! 

Service was okay.  Not for his lack of trying but just how this place is laid out makes it hard to watch tables and serve....poor guy had to travel all about to get food to us from the kitchen way the hell at the other end of this place  and his section was spreadout (Cafe ""hugs"" the building....more narrow and long) . He was really trying to be helpful with us reheating the soup, apologizing and offering a different entree but the food quality is not his fault nor how it was difficult to give great service. The guy was spread thin with a large area and too many tables for one person.

Stopped by for breakfast at 10:15AM. The line to be seated was long and slow and there were plenty of open seats. After being seated it took way too long to take my order for coffee and the follow-up to take the meal order dragged on. 

I was 2/3 through my meal when the waitress checked in on me. I asked for more coffee. 10 minutes later I had to ask again. She delivered the check without me asking... THEN a server arrived to pour a refill of coffee... I signed the check... THEN another server delivered a near empty carafe of coffee. 

Las Vegas is a town that knows how to pump plane loads of people in and out of every venue. Aria Cafe is run like a restaurant that just opened and is working out the kinks vs. an establishment that has been open for several years.

I live in Los Angeles and am used to some of the best restaurants around. This place matches, if not exceeds, at so many levels.  The menus offer a diverse selection of offerings suitable for everyone in the family - whether it be vegan friendly (my son) or a hearty breakfast croissant with potatoes (me) or a simple order of pancakes (my wife). Ingredients are fresh, dishes artfully presented, and taste amazing. 

When we stay at the Aria (3-4 times per year), we eat here several times. It's easy, convenient, and quick. 

The vast majority of the reviews of this place that are negative have one common theme: price. And from that point of view, they nitpick everything else. Listen, you are in Las Vegas at a luxury casino. If you are on a tight budget, this probably isn't the place for you. Rather, there are plenty of food courts along the strip that have more affordable options. 

Five stars for food quality, freshness, menu options, and convince for those staying at the Aria.",D8k2A5_Z-ptEDo4O3fe8ow,6,0,5,8-jzkFtNn2HO8S0Gl4nAsw

Price: a BLT and a coke, plus tip, 20$. Ya that may seem steep, but this is the strip in Vegas... you're lucky to get a drink for less than $10.

I wouldn't suggest bringing a woman here on a first date, or if your looking for the glam and glits of the strip don't come.

What a miss. 

First, service was horrible. Slow and inattentive, we had to ask for several things several times.  Second, my smoked salmon lacked...salmon. I was given 4 pieces to go with a bagel and cream cheese with sliced onions and tomatoes.  I think it cost something like $14. My friends' eggs benedict was also ""whatevers"" according to them.  Third, when my friends first sat down (I joined later), the server had asked them if they'd like ""bread or pastries"".  They chose pastries...only to find out that they cost $14 instead of being free.  Nice of the waiter to let us know.

It was too early for the other restaurants to open, so that left Cafe Vettero. 

We ordered a plate of calamari, a margharita pizza for me and a chicken quesadilla for the hubs. The calamari was really good, I really liked the breading. However, the pizza was no different than what I got out of a fast food window. The quesadilla was pretty flavorless. it was all edible and did what it needed to do and that was to kill some hunger.

I have to admit that I was hoping the food would have a little less of a fast food quality. I really don't think that it is too much to ask.

The Three Egg Breakfast that the other 2 members of my party ordered came with the runniest eggs (almost raw). The hash browns were burnt and not edible. One person did get a side of fruit and it looked fried out, like it had been sitting around for a while.

Service: 2
Atmosphere: 4

This place needs some work and reimagining. This is not in line with being the namesake restaurant of the Aria hotel. Despite being a nice dining experience in terms of the atmosphere, there are numerous problems dragging this place down. We gave this cafe several chances during our stay with Aria due to convenience and having a variety of options, but it was repeatedly a disappointment. We won't be back to this cafe without big changes.

The unfortunate part is, some of the food is actually pretty good. We enjoyed our pancake (When it eventually arrived as described later). The initial lunch here was also not too bad. But these experiences are otherwise mired by bad experiences.

For starters, the breakfast potatoes that come with your meal: These need to go, replace them with something else -- even nothing at all might be better. These often came out rock hard and tasteless. One batch one morning was so terrible I'm certain I would have broken my tooth if I tried to eat them. I broke one open by hand to see the inside and it was hard as a rock and sharp like a knife.

Secondly, the breakfast items themselves are pricey and overall pretty bland and unremarkable. The one thing we did like for breakfast was the pancake, but this had issues in its own way which leads me to the next point...

Service was often terrible. We had an experience one morning while we stayed here where we ordered with our waitress and received our drinks, after which she disappeared. Our food arrived after a while (~30 minutes) by another food runner who brought some of our meal. (Missing sides and a pancake we had ordered) He acknowledged this and said, ""Be right back with the rest"" as he left. We briefly saw him at another table soon after this, and then he too disappeared for over 30 minutes with out waitress nowhere to be found all this time, either. We eventually tracked down a manager who tracked down our original waitress who apologized for the other person forgetting the rest of our food, but didn't acknowledge her own disappearance for the last hour.

On top of that, my girlfriend was drinking here water and eventually noticed the glass she had been drinking out of was absolutely filthy. It arrived in this condition, all she had done was sip from the straw then she saw how dirty the glass was. This is disgusting! Far beneath what you expect from a hotel like Aria. 

This place needs a complete overhaul with new food options, staff and management to bring this up to what you would expect from the namesake restaurant of Aria hotel. Stay away from this place until that happens.",mN8Uwrd2K6v_Gh8j6_vw0w,1,0,2,Lzriu-3wgwsNdrLSe87mcQ

I felt completely under-dressed. And the hostess kind of made me feel even worse with that ""you coming in here wearing that"" stare. But It was all good when our waitress came out. I believe her name was Victoria or Veronica (Again tired, 2am.. I cant really remember) and she had a Southern accent. Anyways she was full of energy and really pumped us up.

I just ordered mashed potatoes.. I couldn't pick anything out that I really wanted from the menu. The mashed potatoes were $7 and weren't that great.

The casino/resort itself it dazzling and new.  They clearly have gone to great lengths from the fountains to the marble and granite to produce an attractive and beckoning space.

I chose the iceberg wedge with bacon, tomatoes, and bleu cheese and added grilled shrimp.  The shrimp really enhanced the salad.  My friends got the sausage pizza and a cheeseburger.  Standard items but again tasty.

I would definitely go back for dinner and explore the menu options further.  

Another rather annoying thing was that the place was almost empty yet there was at least a 5 minute wait to see us.  

Our server was nice and didn't hassle us when we split the bill three ways (cheap! ha ha)

It's like your local restaurant, when you take residence in the Aria for 7 days!

EXCEPT it's Vegas priced.

Let's just say I wanted a filling breakfast before work (tradeshow), so I got down there early, before the masses. There was a two person wait to get in, which was super easy. There are two lines, one for the regular patrons and one for the advanced M-life members -- which is totally normal thing in Vegas casinos!

I was seated in a comfy booth, all my my lonesome. I mentioned I had to get to work so the bus person and the server were really great with timing and speediness.

I had planned to order a very basic meal, eggs, toast, and bacon, but when I saw that was $20, I figured for $8 I should just get the steak and eggs, which I did!

Before the food arrived, the server brought a whole tray of condiments -- ketchup, various jams, hot sauces, and steak sauces. It was a great little assortment of dipping goodness...most of which I didn't even use.

I was also served a carafe of coffee and a cup. A bonus was that they had soy milk, which I really didn't think they would, for my coffee. Bonus points.

It honestly felt like I was being served room service in a restaurant. Maybe it was the silver covering tray my food, before it was set before me. The steak, which was ordered medium well, was pretty well done by the time it reached it. The eggs were perfectly over easy. However, it didn't say that the hash browns come in a square brick, it just said hash browns, so I assumed it was normal breakfast style. I asked for extra crispy and it looked like they tried to make the top and bottom a little more crispy, but it was really not that good at all! The toast was not even warm, so the butter couldn't melt on it.

As I tore through the steak, I was okay with my meal. It left a lot to be desired, but it did the trick of filling me up before a long work day, with most likely no lunch. The service was great, I had no issue with the service at all.

It's like over priced room service you have to sit down to order...",Af33NzmZ2TGpwEKFxUlrlQ,6,3,2,FwvhOdd8KLNnC6mQfv985Q

5482147,2017-07-05,0,TVbVii4EUQt9DG7y698zIw,"""Cafe"" does not do this place justice--its better than most of the mid-tier dining options on the strip and priced like it, too. 

Atmosphere: love the wide open and humongous ceilings with the large packed-earth columns. The large windows face the entrance and roundabout. Lots of great natural light. The place can fit tons of patrons. It's quite elegant inside. 

Service: the service here is usually great. The few times I've had complaints are either right at change of shift or peak breakfast/lunch--and it's just service to get check or order more food, never food arrival.

Food: the options are plentiful and range from healthy dishes to decadent. Another wonderful surprise is the presentation--all the dishes are pleasantly plated with flair (e.g. Edible flowers, deconstructed, etc). All the dishes are massive and you probably don't need as many or any sides. 

Highlights--the chicken and egg salad was bright, colorful, and clean. The biscuits and gravy was rich, gorgeous, and came with three 2x1x1 inch pieces of immaculate pork belly. The sweetness of the biscuits seemed like a blasphemy at first but really worked with the richness of the dish, albeit could be a little less sweet. The parfait was a gorgeous deconstructed plate with tons of fresh peak fruit--nearly as many berries as in the side dish, didn't need to order both. All the berries were peak freshness and on point (e.g. Plump intact blueberries). The huevos rancheros were tasty. All the poached eggs came out perfect. 

Price: $15-25 for most mains. The complaints from other reviews don't hold water for me--first of all, this is Aria, if you want an inexpensive diner meal you shouldn't be eating at MGMs most expensive property. Second, the size of food is huge here and I rarely see any table that ate all their food. Third, you can pay more for a buffet at Aria or elsewhere but get the same amount of food here for less--buffet bias doesn't apply. Fourth and lastly, the quality of the food is great here. 

I'll continue to come back.",QwYUgv2fSLbtelKZd4MdAg,1,1,4,xMjAIF9VVZ6EzMbXKu8ZYA

The only drawback is the exceptionally slow service we experienced on our first time there. Breakfast should NOT take an hour and a half - we're wasting valuable pool time here!

Our first trip, we all got breakfast, along with mimosas and bloody marys. once we were seated, it took forever for a waiter to come over with menus. It took forever for him to come back to give us water -which we had to ask for, twice. It took forever for him to come take our order. It took forever for our food to get here. Are you sensing a theme here? It generally took forever.

I had the steak and eggs, which were phenomenal. I got scrambled egg whites with mine, which were cooked perfectly. The steak was seasoned nicely and cooked to my liking. The hash browns were so, SO good. I mean, I cleaned my plate. It was exactly what I had hoped for.

My friend had ordered something that had jalepenos, and asked for it without the jalepenos. What did she get? Tiny pieces of jalepenos all throughout her dish. When she mentioned it to the waiter, he mumbled something about telling the cook, and took the item off our bill since it was mostly not edible for her.

Our second experience was much better - fast service all around, no issues with the food. We all split a bunch of dishes - chicken fingers, nachos, caesar salad, and quesadillas. Everything was really, really great, except for the quesadillas. We found ourselves longing for the quesadillas we had at the pool the other day instead.

5508755,2017-06-27,2,TVbVii4EUQt9DG7y698zIw,"We came here looking for breakfast food and burgers at night and were wholesomely disappointed. 

At first glance, this restaurant is stunning -- sweeping glass walls, interesting architectural features, intimate booths -- the Aria Caf√© is a sight to behold. Which, kind of, told me that service and the food would match the settings. It took a few minutes to get drinks, which was forgivable, but it took even more time to get a hold of a real waiter to take our food order. Drinks were overpriced -- they're not on the menu, so be advised that sodas are $5. Stick with water if you're going to drink anything -- and the menu itself sits around $18 a plate, so get ready to shell out $42 for an appetizer and an entr√©e. 

On to the actual meal: The loaded tater tots were the highlight of the evening. It was chock full of lovely green onions, a nice mild cheese sauce, and thickly cut chunks of bacon. However, everything went downhill from there.  I ordered the croissant & egg sandwich with cheese, my friend ordered it without. She didn't like her sandwich much. With cheese was substantially better, but the sandwich itself wasn't great. It wasn't worth the $18 price tag, and to top it off, I almost choked inhaling the flakes off the croissant. Not a good way to start the meal. Another member of our party ordered the chicken sandwich, which was incredibly acidic and tasted almost completely like a pickle, and she wasn't able to finish it -- completely and totally unacceptable. Also, in her words, the ""potato salad tastes like soap"". 

Service was good, but wasn't very quick. The manager was kind enough to remove the check, and they might have been understaffed. However, the food was frankly inadmissible for the price. You can definitely miss the Aria Caf√© -- you'll find far better options worth the price just a few steps away.",BFl3i3oq_QMmsCZXrteA8g,2,0,2,vvrkFQ4RwMwArhDiQ8cQnA

Although, the hotels probably figure the late night crowd won't be sober enough to care.  Which, admittedly, isn't the worst bet to make in Vegas...

Located at Caf√© Vettro's old spot inside Aria, I can't say if ARIA Caf√© is just their new name or a true replacement.  Either way, it's easily the nicest 24-hour caf√© I've been to in Vegas, with its open space, huge windows, and modern d√©cor.  Service was pretty nice as well, but the kitchen is slow.  Even though it was mostly empty when my buddy and I walked in for a late lunch, it still took almost 30 minutes for our food to come out.

Wanting something light yet filling, I ordered the GRILLED CHICKEN CIABATTA, served with Pepper Jack Cheese, Poblano Chilies, Guacamole, Tomatoes, Spicy Mayonnaise, and a side of Fries ($15).  While it sounded great on the menu, the sandwich fell short.  The chicken was okay, but the relative lack of guacamole and mayo, coupled with the thick ciabatta bread, made for a dry, dry sandwich.  I ended up leaving most of the bread behind, but at least the fries weren't bad (a little salty).

Although my particular dish wasn't terribly priced, we saw several on the menu that were.  It may be The Strip, but $20 for Beef Fried Rice?  $22 for Fish n Chips?

The line was long during the 10am time, but there is a Mlife line if you are pearl and above. Hubby and I stood in the middle lane (an Mlife lane), and we didn't actually find it useful since the hostess kept seating people from the lanes on either side. I was hangry, so after about watching 6 people from each lane getting shown to there seats, I finally went up to the hostess and asked why they kept skipping our line. It was until then, we finally got sat. 

The breakfast menu is pretty small, just the basics, eggs, toast, potatoes, pancakes. Definitely overpriced, but it is the Aria after all. Hubby and I decided to keep it simple and we got the ""three egg style"", which comes with potatoes, meat (I got turkey bacon, hubby got real bacon), and toast. 

When our order's came out, room style service where it is covered and they uncover the food for you, I noticed that my ""three eggs"" was definitely in the ""one and a half egg"" territory. Hubby's egg portion was much larger than mine. If I'm paying $17 for this simple breakfast, I better damn well get my full three eggs!! I immediately called a server, who then called another server,  both saw by egg portion and they agreed that there was no way that could have been three eggs. She asked if she could take my plate away to show the chef, I said no. I'm already starving at this point, and no way was I going to let her take my food away. So she agreed to bring out another set of eggs on the side. Eggs came out about 5 minutes later, and imagine this, 3 full scrambled eggs!!

We arrived at McCarran mid-morning and headed to see the Seven Magic Mountains before checking in next door at Vdara. By that time, we were starving and Aria Cafe is a short walk from our hotel lobby. 

We were greeted and seated immediately. I opted for the fried chicken sandwich. It was the perfect welcome to Vegas meal. It was a generous sized fried chicken piece that was buttery fried chicken goodness. It was served on a potato roll with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and mayo. I asked and got tater tots instead of fries and it was great. The fried chicken was moist, had a great crust to its batter and had a hint of butteryness to it. It was a great bite to eat. Nice and tasty. The potato bread bun was the right call on this sandwich. It tasted great and held up well. And tater tots? That's always a good call. Great dipping in some ketchup... Also ordered off the specials menu was the thai bbq chicken and rice meal. It was massive. Half-chicken roasted and served in a sweet Thai glaze served with white rice. Good stuff.

The Good
Our service was great, contrary to many of the reviews.  

The Bad
Yes, this is Vegas and I expect high prices. However, I also would like the quality to be somewhat reflected in the price.  Steak and eggs ($25) had a cut of meat that was full of tendons and fat.  Half of it was not edible.  The food coloring also made me lose my appetite (to their defense I believe 90%+ of restaurants have meat with good coloring).  I think I'm becoming a vegetarian.

The Chilaquiles was drenched in Salsa Verde (which tasted like it came from a can).  It's like eating a salad drenched in dressing.  The flavors didn't come through and all I could taste was the salsa verde.  Most if it was not eaten.

Red velvet pancake was okay.  Topping was overly sweet.  Great if you are Buddy the Elf.  Being ably to customize would have been good.  This sugar overload is ""before"" adding the syrup, which did come on the side.

The fresh juice was highly recommended by the waitress.  I ordered it without questioning.  Afterwards I found out that we were charged $7 for lemonade and more for watermelon juice. The fresh squeezed element is good.  But...for that price I would rather get a fresh pressed green power juice at the Canyon Ranch Spa.  Lemon+water+sugar just doesn't seem to warrant that.  

Total bill $80+ tip for 2 adults.  We left hungry....",I4uZM6PqMKFDK3qrh_KLvA,0,0,2,62haAnq_LjinbpIdvx0KzQ
5658560,2014-09-05,0,TVbVii4EUQt9DG7y698zIw,"I rolled into the Aria cafe at 8:45 pm after seeing Zarkana. Now, first of all, 8:45 is not that late, especially for Vegas, and the fact that Zarkana just ended they should expected a bit of a rush. Apparently they didn't.

When I walked up to the first of two hostesses (seriously, two hostesses) and asked for a table she told me it would be a 5 minute wait. There was seriously nothing but open tables as far as the eye could see. I pointed out to the hostess that there were empty tables everywhere and she said they only had two servers working. 

So they literally had the same number of hostesses as servers?!?! Are you kidding me. And only 2 servers, for not that late and when the show is letting out? The manager who scheduled that should immediately be fired.

Once I finally got sat things got better, but only for a moment. They did acknowledge me immediately, as well as take my food and drink orders very quickly. I was in a breakfasty mood and opted for an omelet. 

The omelet itself was quite tasty but the hashbrowns that accompanied the omelet were horrible. The hashbrowns came in these round circles. I've seen this before in other wannabe high end restaurants. They always suck. The people at the table next to me also ordered breakfast and lady looked at her hashbrowns and said ""what the hell is this?"" She was equally unenthused by how they tasted.

I also got toast with the omelet. They serve the toast to you dry and allow you to butter it yourself. That's great in theory, but here's the problem...butter only melts on the toast when the toast is hot. By the time the toast makes it to your table it is not hot enough to melt the butter. I would much rather they butter it when the toast is still hot and the butter can melt. Even after I buttered the toast, it still tasted dry because the butter couldn't melt into the toast.

The service continued to go downhill at this point. Due to the dry toast I drank my soda pretty fast and waited for a refill. And waited, and waited, and waited. It didn't actually get refilled until AFTER I finished my meal and they dropped off the check. Argh!

Additionally, another customer ordered the fish and chips (which I will say looked amazing and had me wishing I had ordered that instead) and asked for malt vinegar to put on the fish. That is a pretty standard request for fish and chips, but the server had absolutely no idea what the customer was asking for. Seriously?

Honestly, I expected more from a restaurant in a 5-star resort.

Now, I will say, my omelet was good but nothing special, the fish and chips looked amazing and the entire space for the cafe was very nice. There is a solid base here and maybe with some better management and a couple of tweaks to the food this can be a solid restaurant, but for now it is just a huge disappointment.",pS0h-b_aWVm-drm880T01w,1,0,2,95xbBe0Gqf0Ead9bdN7DqQ

I vaguely remembered LV Restaurant Week starting the day we were arriving in Vegas. It did piqued my interest when I saw it was coincidental with the time we were here so I initially said ""I'm In!"" right away. I changed it back to Sounds Cool as I had trouble seeing any details online. 

Well once we got seated I saw that they had the menu for it! Thirty dollars per person was within reason for me plus it was my birthday Eve! I instantly decided to go with it. I asked the waiter if we both had to order from it simultaneously and he said no. Hubby went with the Asian chicken salad which was light and quite flavorful.  He also received bread and butter with his salad.

My watermelon salad was quite tasty in a unique way plus it also contained pistachios. The watermelon itself was sweet. Yay that's always a plus!!! My salmon entree appeared immediately after my initial salad. It was way better than I expected. Salmon cooked to perfection not undercooked. Skin left on top and it was crunchy. I gave that portion to my husband who enjoys that. Underneath were crushed peas and fingerling potatoes. Everything there was delish!

While I was still eating my salmon entree as I obviously eat slow because out came my creme br√ªl√©e dessert. Oh my!

5721214,2012-01-05,0,TVbVii4EUQt9DG7y698zIw,"Had an amazing long night the night before, so me and some friends woke up early and decided to grab breakfast at Aria since we were staying at Vdara.

Long line, waited for about half an hour and when we finally sat down, the initial server forgot my milk despite asking four times. Our male waiter was very polite and accommodating, but unfortunately, he left his shift mid-meal and introduced us our new waiter which we never saw again after our waiter introduced her. She came back once though, to give us our check. 

So i guess good customer service is on a waiter by waiter basis. 

Our food wasn't phenomenon, but it wasn't shit-bad. It was just... edible. Wasn't memorable at all. We had a reservation for Serendipity 3 in a few hours so we didn't want to get too full or spend too much. 

I ordered a $6 Chicken tender appetizer and $4 for a side of fries (and my milk). My other two friends both ordered the House smoked Salmon and our other friend ordered the eggs benedict.

It was the four of us and we all ate one breakfast dish (i ate an appetizer and side dish). When the check came, the tab was $120 (without tips yet). 

Ridick.
Aside from the bad service and watching the server drop the tray of food from the table behind us, what we ate was nowhere CLOSE to $100 worth. I had 3 pieces of chicken tenders and a baby basket of fries. Turns out my lukewarm pathetic excuse for cold milk was $4 and my friend's orange juice was $7. Unbelievable. If a mixed drink at TAO is $12, there's no way a plain orange juice is $7. Even in VEGAS.

Sorry, call me frugal or that I don't understand that everything is pricey in Vegas, but as someone who frequents vegas since youth with a splurgy family and someone who appreciates good ambiance and fine dining, this just didn't cut it. Nice try. But try again.

5800844,2014-12-28,0,TVbVii4EUQt9DG7y698zIw,"BY FAR the worst breakfast I've ever had in Vegas!  Firstly, we waited a the hostess desk for about 5 minutes without being greeted (we were the only ones in line on Dec24th at approx 9am).  Finally, a very pregnant gal came out and seated us.  Turns out, she was also our waitress.
She was very sweet, and we were very hungry.  My husband played it safe and ordered the french toast with a side of bacon, orange juice and coffee.
I ordered the ultimate omelette--with shrimp, spinach and goat cheese and water.
It took about 25 minutes to get our breakfast--my husband and I joked about them chasing the chickens in the back to get the eggs because it took so long for such a simple order.
When the food arrived, it was as it stated, french toast with a side of bacon, no bells and whistles.  It was ok, and the bacon was not cooked all the way thru.
My omelette came with hash browns that were molded into discs, almost the shape of a ramekin.  They were COLD and horribly greasy. Working in the food industry, I know that these were institutional food shapes, bought this way and simply deep fried and left to sit...mine unfortunately for waaay to long.  
My omelette was ok, nothing fancy for the $18 ticket price.  Halfway through, something in the omelette smelled a little off and I couldn't figure it out.  The nausea and tummy ache the rest of the day indicated something was obviously turned or perhaps beyond date.

My beef with this whole experience is this--you're listed as a 5 star hotel, with a 5 star price, serve 5 star food!!! At least please let the food be hot when it arrives, and do your best to not make your guests ill.

I like to eat whenever I am hungry - which is about every 4 hours around the clock. Thus I end up eating at places like this at 2:30 in the morning. 

The Yelp description boasts this is the largest 24/7 cafe in Las Vegas. It seems like more than half of the place is unused while they make hungry patrons wait in line to be seated. We got to skip part of the line with our M life card which was cool. 

They offer only a limited late night menu. We had a standard patty melt and club sandwich. It was good/edible but not worth coming all the way to Aria for. 

I saw another table enjoying the calamari which looked delicious. 

The patrons ranged from families with kids enjoying a late night bite to partiers looking to sober up. 

Go to Grand Luxe Cafe at the Venetian instead. Even with the cab ride over there it will be more affordable and much much tastier with more variety.",O2NNe32zlfqIFuTDL5Dyeg,0,0,2,cHu4Txr1xE1rpS4J5fyUPA

Your initial thought is that it's super open and there's tons of sunlight coming in from all the windows. Love that part.

The service was surprisingly a lot better than I expected. To be perfectly honest, I thought this place didn't stand a chance. I assumed it was an over-priced, eat-here-because-we-are-in Aria restaurant. We all know what happens when you assume (make an ass of you and me. Har har).

So much food that I'll be pretty impressed if you finished the entire meal. You get two eggs, two pancakes, two sausages, two pieces of bacon, 3 hash brown patties and 2 pieces of toast. Right??? The food was good. Nice hearty breakfast, and not ridiculously priced.

The food is satisfactory. Not bad, not great. A little overpriced for cafe food, but I guess you're paying for the ""atmosphere"" and it's Vegas, so I get it. 

The service was mediocre at best. When we arrived for an early dinner, the restaurant was nowhere near full. My group had been at a convention all day and hadn't eaten anything so everyone was starving. We ordered a salad, nachos, the meatloaf, and a sandwich. These  four items took a half hour to come out. While we waited, we noticed the waitress in the station nearby bringing baskets of bread to all of her tables. We asked the waiter why we hadn't gotten any bread, and he informed us that we needed to request it. Really? Since when is bread and butter something that you need to request, and why did every table have it but ours? 

My husband ordered their spicy Bloody Mary, which came with no garnish and not even a straw. It wasn't any better or more spicy than a Bloody Mary you'd drink at a casino bar. 

The food was... food. We had nothing to complain about and nothing to rave about. Cafe Vettro gets the job done, but don't come here looking for great food and impeccable service.",i5h0mqGsqtOerEa05ar-Vw,1,0,3,444fC_Zkk-YAZ4-Gewv44g

It was slightly more limited than the full breakfast but when I mentioned that I had really been wanted the French Toast, the waitress was kind enough to run back to the kitchen to see if the cooks would make it for me even though it wasn't on the ""all-day breakfast"" menu. They agreed and so I was one happy camper. My hubby got the steak and eggs which was a huge meal and he said it was really good. We both loved our food and the service was stellar. I also really enjoyed all the sunlight streaming in the huge floor to ceiling windows. Even though they face the front entrance of Aria, the restaurant is positioned in such a way so that there are flowers and shrubbery at eye level (rather than staring at the taxi line) and your eyes are drawn upward to the glass buildings and skyline of the strip.

Including salads French fries
Mexican food etc 
All had some kind of flour dairy nuts name it but not gluten free
For a minute was overjoyed ordered a soup
2 minute later waiter stopped us eating it ... It has a rou with flour and butter....

And the waiter tried to push sell fried chicken or grilled but when checked about if it was marinated or dipped in guess what gluten ...

On the other hand the buffet had lots of choices gluten free
But having a set
Menu similar everyday it got old and not so easy...we tried breakfast lunch brunch or dinner the price was different but not the selection for gluten dairy nuts free... So the buffet is recommended for its vegan/vegetarian and some gluten free dishes.
