First thing I noticed was they didn't give me my side salad (which came with my cheese ravioli).  The garlic bread (that came with the cheese ravioli) was soggy and I couldn't notice any garlic flavor.  The $21 (18 inch) pizza is as thin as possible and weights far less than the cheese ravioli. The pizza is bland and there are too many olives on the Mediterranean (I think) I ordered. The only thing halfway decent is the ravioli. I pretty much like all ravioli, but the sauce is very bland and is worse than store bought sauces. You can tell Romano's looks to give you small portions for big prices in order to maximize profits. I feel like the ingredients are all store-bought and none of them fresh. For $50 worth of pizza, a 2 liter, 5 jalapeno poppers, and some ravioli, you can find much better deals in this town.",_ECf30RVwPTIJiZOXvHNhQ,0,0,2,_k9qz0hkm6QK4XGaYta3MQ

What kind of customer service?? I ordered my food at 5:22pm, didn't get a call from the driver until 6:45pm asking me if I had an apartment number, when I clearly put it on my order. The food didn't get delivered until 6:54PM! And the food wasn't even that spectacular....I would've been ok if they called me to let me know they were going to be late.",L7OVxZtuP_VXnmdaCnA78g,0,0,2,5vB6iYT2mASKV8EZbZzs9w
2134588,2018-04-28,0,Igqp27BP7cm9vUu_WB0gRA,"DO NOT!!!!! Order through Romano's pizzeria. Horrific customer service. I was told that I would not be refunded my $20 order...  for my extremely cold pizza that they said was fresh out the oven. The pizza felt like it had been sitting out for a few hours ... that's absolutely disgusting.... the manager refused to refund me $20... 
I waited in my car with my 2 month old new born for almost an hour!!!! To get an extremely cold disgusting pizza. Again what horrific customer service. We had to buy an ALBOA pizza to sastify our  pizza craving...  I would highly recommend NOT ordering through this disgusting horrific cold gross pizza place. They don't care about what they serve you. & again the customer service was absolutely Terrible!!!!! My pooor new born child having to wait in the car for over an hour because they didn't have their times right. For a disgusting cold pizza that not even my dog would eat. If you want awful gross pizza then this is your place ... other then that spend your money elsewhere. Would NEVER recommend this place to ANYONE!!!!!

2243821,2017-08-27,0,Igqp27BP7cm9vUu_WB0gRA,"Great pizza! We called ahead and they had it ready. We ordered through Yelp and it kinda worked. First said that it would be ready in 15-20 mins but then it said 90 mins! We had to call back and they confirmed it would only be 10 mins. That was the only hiccup. 

The pizza itself was very good--basic cheese and pepperoni but heads and shoulders above the chains, and it was comparable in price. Nice place to visit away from the hustle of the strip. 

We found it hard to find--there are about 25 buildings at the same address, This establishment is at the far north end of the complex.",B2-wOuAUkqGuhzALvr8xcQ,0,0,4,Olnhm8k8qO18tJLNjxevcQ
2264230,2017-03-17,0,Igqp27BP7cm9vUu_WB0gRA,"The absolute worst restaurant experience ever. I work for a large company not too far from this restaurant so my coworkers and I decided to order delivery from this establishment. The first issue was that the food took much longer than expected. After finally receiving our food orders the quality was terrible and although the lunch special says 8 wings, my coworker and I only received 6 wings in each of our orders.  My other coworker's food was completely burnt and it was astonishing to see that the restaurant would actually allow that to be served to anyone. One of my coworkers called and was issued a refund, but when my other coworker called the manager was very nasty to her, told her he would issue a refund and would call her back but never did. This entire experience was horrible and our company will never EVER order anything from them again!!! The food was truly disgusting, terrible management, and horrible customer service! Save yourselves and don't bother eating here!!!

This is functional. The pizza was ok (probably translates to good for something other than a pizza snob. 

We would talk about pizza all day. It was solid average pizza. But I also got wings and chocolate cake. 

Wings were small but actually a small step above the pizza. 

Chocolate cake was a total joke.",pniz9B88I6kMrrqdi5GYDg,1,1,3,ScfDf-znmf__z9CARPnopw

The sandwich itself had great flavor.  They also took forever to deliver, an hour and they said 20 minutes.  So I would definitely try it again, but I recommend asking for plastic silverware when you get a messier sandwich like the Philly, especially when you are in a hotel room",9OOXgjjrI5sgmm5lfavvUQ,0,0,4,HdQFExg0LS8_D8v9qKBnMw

3106347,2017-08-04,0,Igqp27BP7cm9vUu_WB0gRA,"Tried this place for lunch today, had the food delivered. I had a pizza, and a slice of cheesecake. The pizza was ok, not great and not bad. The crust was pretty doughy which didn't really bother me but might bug others the cheesecake was really gritty for some reason and had that ""fridge"" taste to it. Initially they forgot the soda that came with my order but were quick to come back with it. The delivery guys were nice.

The pizza was perfectly made (reminded me of one of my favorite childhood pizzerias in Chicago) and the wings were gone within minutes.

4685945,2017-03-01,0,Igqp27BP7cm9vUu_WB0gRA,"Romano's definitely has that East Coast Pizzeria style and taste. Really delicious sandwiches, you got to try their Philly steak sandwich it's super delicious and flavorful. I ended up splitting that with my foodie friend because we were going to have a pizza! 

The pizza is made just the right temperature, with the crust and cheese melted just right in. It really just made me salivate writing about it. The kitchen seems to make a very big effort in making sure their pies come out at just the right temperature to your table. If your a big cheese pizza lover, the table next to ours ordered their Greek Pizza which looked like an explosion of mouthwatering cheeses. 

For next time I will most definitely opt to try their Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken and some garlic knots as that's what seems to a popular option that the regulars here gravitate towards. Will absolutely come back here for a lunch break again since it's so close by work. Keep up the yummy food Romano's.",ZR56RR4UwhijBnmLzgVf8Q,0,0,5,LPyRMi4Coiit83uU0JBa3w
