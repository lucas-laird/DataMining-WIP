One thing that bothered me was the amount of time it took to make the food. I like that it's fresh, but it's not a place to go to when there's a few people in front of you and there's no shade on a hot day. Though, if there's a time where the sun isn't beaming down on you, it's a great place to go get your chicken wing/tender fit.

I ordered a box deal which was $10. It's a bit pricey but that's expected for food trucks, so as a food truck fanatic I didn't mind. The box deal included wings/tenders, fries, sauce, and bread. The fries were served in a good amount and they were made the way I like (crispy outside and soft inside, but not burning inside). Sorry for the vague description of the fries. The sauce is just normal ranch served in those plastic containers. The bread was just normal to me, but more for you buck in my opinion lol. I forgot the name of the flavor of the wings, but it was fantastic.It said it was sweet and spicy, but it was majority sweet and no spice, but I eat a lot of spicy so maybe I would have to try a more spicy flavor.

I would definitely come back and I recommend it toward others.",BGMmFg6relFh0-sJEwAvbA,0,0,4,Voj8IJBRirtS5m248P7KbA

992514,2011-10-10,0,qYf3gGP4PYZlV5CcQlorwA,"I wanted to love Sin City Wings, but I didn't. They drew a large crowd during StrEATs. After lengthy wait, we had grub in hand. I don't often like chicken on the bone, so we went with tenders. We couldn't decide on a sauce so we sprung for a second sauce for 50 cents and they left them naked. Armed with Feinberg and Hot Buffalo sauce we dug in. 

The Hot Buffalo sauce was not terribly hot or tasty. After one dunk we stuck with the Feinberg, the spicy apricot was the way to go. However, while the breading is crisp is too thick. I prefer I much lighter coating. The homemade ranch is very watery and no better than most bottled versions. 

The addition of macaroni salad (watery) and bread (dry) seems like carb overkill. It seem like an afterthought, rather than a balanced combo.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,4,0,2,IEdI9wAFzF8E_GHXZ1oK6Q
1232482,2012-01-18,2,qYf3gGP4PYZlV5CcQlorwA,"Just like my last time at StrEATs, instead of going to a usual suspect like Slidin' Thru, I went for something new like last time. 

The food itself = delicious, everything else was a little bit mediocre. 

The line wasn't all that long at all, the wait for the food on the other hand was over 30 minutes. The food was pretty damn good but I don't know if I can say it was worth the wait. 

I ordered the tenders with their version of buffalo sauce (they give weird names to all of their sauces) and seasoned fries. The buffalo sauce was so hot that my nose started running because of it (that might be a little too much information, I know) and it was mild! At the same time it had a strangely sweet kick to it. I could have done without those leaves that they decorated the chicken with though (cilantro? basil? I really don't know since it didn't taste like anything). The curly fries were so skinny and greasy, I LOVED THEM.

The price was kind of steep for food truck standards, but they offered Shasta Tiki Punch and moist towelettes to wipe your hands after one is done savoring their wings.

Oh, by the way, I was finally face to face with Misti for the first time, and I probably have to thank this food truck for that! She was at the Yelp booth which was set up right next to this truck and was kind of hidden, I may have never noticed it otherwise, knowing me. 

The Final Verdict:

Pros:
Well...they're chicken wings and tenders! When are they not tasty?
Divine fries. 
They provide moist towelettes. 
Meeting Misti.

Cons:
Long wait for your food.
Rather steep for a food truck, and there was only one combo deal (which involved yucky looking macaroni salad and dry looking bread).

Suggestions: There should at least be a combo deal for chicken wings and either fries or mozzarella sticks. Although, personally if you ask me seeing that chicken takes a hell of a lot longer to cook than a burger in the first place, a chicken wing food truck isn't the best idea in the world. 

Would I return? Depends on where they are, probably not at Vegas StrEATs again though.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,2,2,3,2POGTHQMNAYfWJEZVrythA

My companion and I got some wings and our friends got fried pickles and an order of fries. Upon getting to the front of the line my companion and I were feeling something spicy, so we asked about the Buffalo Hot and the Oscar ""Ghost Chili"" Goodman sauces.

Our buddy at the truck informed us that the Buffalo Hot lets you taste the spice AND the chicken whereas the Oscar Goodman (I love the naming scheme so much) only tasted like burning fire. We ordered the buffalo hot wanting to be able to taste the interplay of flavors.

The chicken meat was tender and juicy - pretty good wings. However, I was very disappointed with the spice! There was no kick at all to these wings - they should make an intermediate 'heat' step between Oscar Goodman and Buffalo hot as an option for those who like their Thai food 7/10! The fried pickles were amazing. Surprising? Not really. Fried pickles always rock.

I ordered the Bobby Q boneless wings because that's how I roll and I enjoy most things with bbq sauce on it. The wait felt rather long, especially since I was hungry and I had plenty of studying to do. I didn't think it would fill me up, but it did and it was delicious.

They had a food truck at a community event I attended and the owner was extremely rude to me before I even got to the window to place my order.

When my food finally came out, it was not what I ordered (I ordered traditional wings and was served boneless). Instead of the owner apologizing and KINDLY explaining they ran out of traditional wings, his response was a very rude and short ""we ran out"". When I explained that he should've stated they were low on traditional wings and there could be a chance I would get boneless he stated they've been out of traditional wings for 40 minutes - which means when I placed my order, they did not have traditional wings and yet he still let me order them. I was frustrated and disappointed with the whole experience. I also witnessed him being rude to another gentleman who was also inquiring about the wait time because he had been waiting for a long time. Needless to say, I got a refund. I refuse to support ANY business that gives terrible service no matter how good the food smells or looks.

I can understand that good food takes time but this is ridiculous. It doesn't help that there's only one ""chef"" in the truck trying to pump out all the orders. 

Let's get into portion sizes -- $10.50 is a decent amount for a combo with no drink. And boy do the portions vary. Having three people order together and seeing the mad difference in the amount of food you get is a prime way to get people pissed off. 

The flavor is good though, but I don't know if the prices and the wait warrant a taste. And I don't know if it was just me, but when you're out of something, doesn't it make sense to cross it off your dry erase menu?!

Pro Tip: Pay attention to what people outside your truck are saying. When people are getting pissed when served out of order or waiting for 30 minutes, it probably means you're not doing something right.",9ZYBrsh827Wr2nhvWjQ8bg,1,0,3,d2KhXN_vjgw5UsLrlYcqPQ

But this time was just a not good at all. We got 20 wings in hopes of getting half boneless half bone in.  No luck. I don't understand why they couldn't. Had I ordered it separately it could have been done. Anywho. We ended up getting 20 boneless. We were able to get split sauces. Sweet apricot and raspberry chili.  The sauces were ok. The Raspberry chili could have been spicier. The actual pieces of chicken were nice and meaty. I did get a few pieces that were extremely smaller than the rest and were counted as one piece. We ordered a side of crinkle cut fries which were $5. That was only because we were at an event. But the amount I got was crazy small for $5.  
When we first tried this food truck we really did enjoy the food from it. It's seems now they have lost the importance in their quality. I was also kinda bummed to see that the sauces no longer had names. 
Unfortunately this will be the last time I buy food from them.",g5czf__WW0nQO_PUMHTFEA,0,0,3,V-Q9lPXmom3tBMlRTbpQLA
2140243,2013-05-19,0,qYf3gGP4PYZlV5CcQlorwA,"This truck is AMAZING. We showed up about 5 minutes before close (we thought closing was an hour later, we're not those kinds of jerks) and proceeded to order pretty much one of everything on the menu.

 I do not like pickles or sweet potatoes. Their fried pickles were delightful. Crispy, crunchy, a pickle flavor I enjoyed. The rest of the party really loved the sweet potato tots, they had a nice texture and I liked them until I tasted the sweet potato. According to my friend who is a big fan of sweet potato, these were the best she ever had. 

They also have potstickers, which sounds odd for a wings truck, but it was an awesome Asian-BBQ fusion. Imagine really good potstickers from a classy Asian restaurant  drizzled in wing sauce and I believe ranch sauce. They have mastered the crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the middle cooking style. 

And now on to the main event, the wings. Oh, dear mother of God, the wings. Before we even talk about flavor, we need to talk about the succulence of the chicken. I've never had wings so moist and tender, to the point after you start chewing it just gets better. The skin on the outside was crispy in all the right places while still having a little chewy spot. We accidentally ordered two orders of spicy instead of one spicy, one sweet, so we didn't get to try the sweet. The spicy was about a level 2.5 out of 5. It wasn't hot just for the sake of being hot, which is a big pet peeve of mine. 

The first taste of the sauce is a smokiness and then you get just a pop of heat. We were literally licking our fingers, despite the pile of napkins at our side. The prices are completely reasonable ($8 for six wings and a side of fries), the portions are generous (the chicken wings were all at least 3 inches long and meaty), a full basket of pickle slices, a side of ranch with everything. If you get a chance to try this truck out, do it.

I would happily give them 5 stars if they had a bigger social media presence, but as it stands, they update facebook and twitter maybe twice a month so it's hard to know where they are or plan on going.",4YO567yc-4bFLuvFMMX75w,3,1,4,ZtrQUboDBM6t5GjLu__JhA

2519250,2012-02-12,1,qYf3gGP4PYZlV5CcQlorwA,"So After 2 visits to this place...Once at First Friday, and once at StrEATs, I'm still not sure what I think about this place. This review is going to be an average of the two experiences.

A combo box is $8 & comes with 1 lb. of wings (usually about 6) because these are some serious chicken wings, macaroni salad, a basic dinner roll & some ranch dressing that is ridiculously good. 
The sauces are pretty amazing from my 2 experiences.

The 1st time the wings were OK, but they were breaded & fried which I'm not a fan of at all when it comes to wings. I got the Feinberg sauce, which was amazing in my opinion. Just the right balance of sweet from the apricot and spicy. If they wings had not been breaded and the consistency not so soft and full of grizzle then I may have enjoyed them a little more.
The 2nd time I had the wings i got the Buffalo Bill wings, which were perfect.They are very spicy and these wings are almost as big around as they are long. They were perfectly deep fried.
Next time I go though I'll probably just skip out on the combo box since I didn't even eat the mac salad or the dinner roll. Just the wings is $1 cheaper.

Other than the wings they have a pretty unique menu with things like:
Fried Potstickers
Fried Pickles
Mozzarella sticks
& of course the wings you can get as either regular wings or breast tenders.

I'm going to have to try this place a few more times with a few more options on the wings before I can get more of a consensus conclusion.",2DECrukmumziXTBI20idTA,4,1,4,LijOIJnF2LinbvoIMW4NJw
2639405,2011-09-18,3,qYf3gGP4PYZlV5CcQlorwA,"So I've been going consecutively every Saturday to this Food Truck Lineup at Tommy Rocker's... I have A lot of Love for these Food Trucks and the different flavors they bring. I was ecstatic to find out Sin City Wings was going to be there again and even though nobody wanted to join me... I still went! Haha something about going up to a food truck and having the curiosity of what they have to offer. That Excited me. Some will never understand this concept, but that's okay... because what does matter is that I feel that.

I walked up to Sin City Wings after a dreadful, long day at work... exhausted and starving out of my mind. Immediately, this sweet, kind lady came up to me and with a warm welcome of Hello.. how can I help you? I told her I would like the combo with wings ( you can either choose wings or fingers) She asked if I would like anything else... and then my curiosity landed my eyes on the Spicy Fries from the list of items they had. I asked if they were thick or thin... and she told me they are cut fresh daily and are thin than the thicker fries that I was hoping not to get. I gave in and ordered that too. My total for everything was $11 and left a few dollars for tip... all of a sudden I hear her scream to the window... Thunder Cat!!! I put my hands on my hips and thought.. Hmm I like the sound of that name and was thinking to myself.. does she think I'm a thunder cat?! I like it :) So I sat for a few minutes then another food truck caught my attention and wanted to check them out... then out of nowhere the sweet lady from Sin City Wings hand delivered my Spicy Fries to me, since I couldn't hear my name being called from walking away. I thanked her so kindly and proceeded to try these fries... DELICIOUS. The sauce they top the fries with tap dances on my tongue. It gives off this light Tabasco and cheese flavor that isn't heavy nor does it give off a strong bite. It was just so good... I tasted one and couldn't stop eating it!!! I fell in love again... but now their Spicy Fries!!! And oh yeah... their fries remind me of In n Out fries... that are thin and have this solid texture that I admire. Couldn't get enough of these and will definitely order it again! Never tasted anything like this before... the sauce was unique and my taste buds were tingling. It wasn't Very spicy, but you can tell its there. I enjoyed these fries so much. 

I ordered my usual wing combo with Feinberg sauce. The pasta salad was still wonderful and refreshing. The soft hawaiian bread really goes well with this meal, since it balances the spiciness and sweetiness from the sauce. And again.. I didn't even need the Ranch dressing :) My name was called out and a gentleman held my order... as I was trying to get myself up from sitting on the sidewalk and holding my fries container. He saw my hands were full and came to me to give me my wing order. He told me to not get up and he'll bring me a fork... when he came back to me, he joked around and told me.. here's your bib and handed me a long napkin. I chatted real briefly with him and he introduced himself to me as Bobby? told me if there was anything else I needed to let him know. I raved to him how delicious the fries were and I'm not a huge fan of fries at all... I was very impressed... the sauce blew me away. 

The wings were nicely done again and love the crisp crunch and tenderness of the meat. I even had two wings left over and brought it home, where it so happens my brother was there and he gave the wings a try and told me.. these are some good wings!!! Yeah you're right... wow. I replied in a modest way... I told you!!! He was tempted to go down there himself right after. 

Definitely one of my favorite Food Trucks in town... you Must try the Spicy Fries. It's an instant hit. Can't go wrong with the wings here. My face was covered with sauce and meat all stuck in between my teeth, but I didn't care... I was loving it. I left Happy as ever and even sang all the way home in my car to Lil Wayne's Mrs. Officer :) It was so worth going to even when you're riding solo. I winged it all by myself and it was Great ;)",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,7,4,5,avuM-2ml1UXmOrH0nk3-8Q
2641258,2014-06-18,0,qYf3gGP4PYZlV5CcQlorwA,"We are always looking for a wing expert that is able to surprise us with unexpected flavors and the menu offered at Sin City Wings looked promising.

They were perched up at First Friday 6/6/14 and we decided to put an order in for THE FEINBERG - ""Sweet apricot infused with spicy chilies. More sweet than heat."" Note- we are devout spice lovers and eaters, so we were really excited about the flavor combination of sweet apricot and chilies... I guess we failed to notice it state, more sweet than heat. There was no heat or chili flavor at all in the sauce (well, according to my spice and chili loving tastebuds.) The sweet apricot flavor was light and the overall flavor of the sauce was bland. We also strongly felt that the wings could of used some more salt before they were cooked and sauced. The chicken was just so bland. 

The wings were cooked well, not crispy, but moist. They also looked like meaty little guys, but they had quite a bit of fat. Unfortunately, the fatty parts made the texture of the wings mushy and unappetizing.

However, I have to disclose, the ranch sauce they gave us was absolutely delicious (we think they infused it with roasted garlic?) It took the wing from OK to better. Definitely one of the better ranches that I've tasted in my time.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,2,0,3,pbTtzoRJrFQX0WRxBKY2ng

I got popcorn chicken with the raspberry chili sauce. Popcorn chicken were good (they aren't shy with portions either). I asked what the most popular sauces were between the raspberry, the Buffalo Bill, and the Feinberg. I wanted a good balance of heat to sweet. Not too much of either one. He made it clear that the Feinberg was definitely more sweet but that the raspberry was very popular and had a little more spice. The ""BBQ"" sauce was very thick, almost like the raspberry jam that's in it. I tasted zero spice but it was still pretty good. The wait time was what I'd expect for a good truck with only two people who are making a large number of guests, a large number of orders.

I was really impressed with the wings and everyone I was with raved about how good they were as well, so I was pretty surprised to see now that they have just 3.5 stars on Yelp. We ordered 20 boneless wings: 10 BBQ, 5 mild, and 5 hot. I thought the quality of the wings was about as good as I've had. They were lightly breaded, fried perfectly, and the inside was still tender and not dried out. The BBQ sauce was as good as it gets for me. Perfect combination of sweet and smokey. The mild and hot had good but not amazing flavor. I was a little disappointed that the hot wasn't more spicy, but looking at their menu now, I see that they have a more spicy flavor than hot.  Their ranch dressing was really good. 

One negative about my experience was that they had ran out of most of their flavors, so we were more limited in our selection. They have some flavors that I'd really like to try that weren't agailabl

I really do want to give them 5 stars, but that's tough to earn, and not having all their sauces available I think bumps them down to 4 stars. They have potential to be bumped up to 5 stars if I try them out again and have a good experience. If you're in the mood for some wings though, Sin City Wings can definitely satisfy that craving.",Vct4fKoGE9k-7tNwSsY8Cw,3,0,4,J8zKB693NJNsB5Nb2Cz_tg

In my opinion, what makes Sin City Wings special is that they do everything well across the board - from ingredients to preparation and service. On the topic of ingredients, they use nice pieces of chicken. These are chicken wings afterall, but even among them, these were good sized pieces. 

Another thing Sin City Wing does well is their frying (believe me - I'm hyper critical about this stuff). The chicken was crispy on the outside, moist well cooked chicken on the inside. If you're a texture guy like I am, you'll appreciate it. 

I've also tried most of their flavors and have to tell you - THEY ARE KILLER. In fact, I've recently put on my bucket list that one day, I'd like to bath in their Raspberry Chili BBQ sauce. Yes, it is that good. I'm quite astonished that most (if not all?) of their sauces are made in-house. 

While I'm the subject of sauces, I actually want to say that I disagree with Kellee's review of their ranch. I found it to be great for dipping and the fact that it wasn't too thick let me make sure that I could taste the chicken and not just get a mouthful of salad dressing.

So who should come here? Anybody (Yes, I mean you). If you like wings, then you'll love this place. If you don't like wings and were like me (didn't care for wings), you should come here anyways. Because of Sin City Wings, I am now a believer of how good a chicken wing (or tender) can be. Of course, now I'm totally ruined unless they come up to Seattle. 

The bottom line: Eat here. Wipe your hands off. Eat here again. Do eeeeeet! 

P.S. - Get your chicken tenders breaded and forever thank me.",i5sEXnpx6_h7D-A9ZxMPDw,7,3,5,Mafg2okJ0UvaI5sg3O6QaA

I ordered that and fried pickels. I was second in line and the order took a good 10 minutes. Really? They move slower then molasses. On a high note the pickles were scorching hot when they handed them over but were swimming in grease. (Had a mini grease lake in the bottom) the potstickers came second. I was so excited to try them because of the unique flavors. The presentation was beautiful, professional and you could tell then took pride in their work. The flavors.... the buffalo sauce didn't taste like buffalo at all. It was sweet and mild. Not tangy at all. They also put some sort of cream sauce as a garnish which was good as well. I thought the pot stickers could have been cooked longer, but I'm just picky. I would go back here, but only if the sauce was a true tangy buffalo sauce. My sister LOVED them on the other hand.

I went with a wing combo with the Feinberg sauce. A while back, I remember hearing about a food truck that has a sauce named after Jason Feinberg (of Fox 5 fame), but I had forgotten which truck. There's really no reason for the association other than they wanted to name a sauce after a local personality. It's a spicy apricot concoction that is sweet with a little kick.

The wings were pretty good--nothing absolutely mind-blowing--but combined with the Great Buns bread, the surprisingly delicious mac salad, and the top quality ranch dressing, the combo came together very well and was very satisfying. (Yes, I've finally come to the realization that not all ranch dressing is created equal).

What really makes me a fan of Sin City Wings is, strangely enough, their buffalo potstickers. I never thought to put buffalo sauce on deep-fried potstickers. It's a geniously gratifying combination.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,3,5,4,s5CnzDrHuhVTj0zmti-sDA

You would think that running a hot wings truck at a fair like this for years, they would have a slight clue that since their only menu items are wings, and they are called sin  city wings, that pretty much everyone orders wings. They should have had a couple wings going at all times, so it really made no sense.

I sat there 30 minutes and watched them average maybe 1 order of wings every 5 minutes. It was beyond pathetic, and they screwed up my order and made me wait 30 minutes to watch their pathetic display of 3 men in a truck and 6 fryers that were outputting less than one wing per minute.

If you want to pay cash only and wait over 30 minutes for a dozen or ten wings go ahead. If you pay credit, be prepared for a possible mishap. I never even got my wings, and returned the order with my credit card but was still charged!

Despite the positive reviews I read and the couple of people that told me to give them a try, I have to admit I was more than disappointed with Sin City Wings. I hate writing bad or negative reviews especially for a place where the staff was friendly.

I was so excited to try them at the Vegas StrEATS festival this past weekend and I had heard that I needed to try the Buffalo Potstickers along with the chicken wings. I wasn't in the mood for wings, especially considering seating was limited and I felt like that would be a mess. So I ordered chicken tenders with the raspberry sweet and spicy sauce and the buffalo potstickers.

They advertise FRESH, NEVER FROZEN right on their sign but the door was open in the back and the cook was definitely pulling chicken and potstickers out of pre-packaged bags from the supermarket. Now, I can't say if they were frozen or not (they looked it) but they definitely were pre-packaged. Was very tempted to go ask for my money back right then and there but decided to wait it out and try the food. (Should have gone with this plan though)

The potstickers were just regular tasting potstickers with sauce poured on top that didn't go together all that well. I ate one and didn't touch anymore. The chicken tenders were tossed in the sauce (by tossed, I mean not even enough sauce to cover each each piece of chicken). The sauce was decent except it was hard to taste it considering the chicken to sauce ratio. Ended up not finishing these either and there were two of us eating them.

Very disappointed and I really do hope that I can one day update this review for the better (see: Bachi Burger), but for now, it remains one star and that is only because the staff was friendly.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,7,3,1,AKFWm56deDAomafk1ezFcA

Since I'm on campus for about 13 hours a day because of work and school, I really don't have a lot of time to make myself lunch for the next day, so the appearance of these delicious foodmobiles has been both a blessing and a curse. Sin City Wings just so happened to be one of those delicious food trucks that decided to conveniently park right next to my office on campus.

Now I am one of the biggest wing fanatics to ever walk the earth, and let me tell you, these wings are pretty darn tasty. My favorite thing to order is a box combo, which comes with wings, fries, and a drink all for $10. There's about 5 sauces to choose from, but my personal favorite would have to be the Bobby Q. The Bobby Q offers you a familiar barbecue taste, with a hint of spicy mixed it. It's delicious on the wings and their amazing fries. If you're feeling daring and love some heat, I would recommend getting their ""Oscar Goodman"" option.

The 2 trucks catered our summer employee (1000+ people) picnic 2 weeks ago at Floyd Lamb State Park. We are still receiving compliments from the employees on our choice of food. 

The menu consisted of pulled pork sandwiches, chipotle lime cole slaw and peppered corn. For those with restricted diets (or kids) there were turkey hot dogs, veggie burgers and beef hot links. The pulled pork was simply delectable. It was tender and moist and had the perfect balance of smoke and flavor. The bread tasted fresh from the bakery and the sauces that accompanied the sandwiches were all equally gratifying. The spicy BBQ sauce had some serious kick! The cole slaw was outstanding, mixing chipotle flavor into a traditional southern staple was ingenious especially when added to the sandwich! The peppered corn was so tasty and seasoned people were coming back asking for seconds. They also served 300+ pounds of the sweetest watermelon I've tasted since I left the south. 

The staff were all attentive and genial. The guy who carved all of the watermelon in the 100+ degree heat, did so with a smile on his face, never once complaining. The owner of the business has one of those personalities that belongs on a comedic stage. He socialized, danced and interacted with the employees all while overseeing the food service. I admire the fact that he wasn't afraid to get dirty, always assisting wherever he was needed. They served all 1000 of our employees in a few hours without ever having a line or a long wait. Our expectations were exceeded in every aspect and I can't wait to use them again for our next big corporate event.

Let me start by commenting that though there was quite a long line, it moved quickly and the woman taking our order was very pleasant and friendly even though I'm sure it had been a long and busy night for her.

My husband and I each ordered a box deal which includes 8 pieces of chicken (wings or tenders, your choice...we opted for tenders) in your choice of one of 5 homemade sauces, macaroni salad, a piece of bread, and a side of their amazing homemade ranch for dipping. Oh em gee was it delicious!!! 

The chicken tenders were fresh and crispy on the outside, juicy and delicious on the inside...but that's just the beginning. Lets talk about the SAUCE, which in my opinion was the highlight of the meal. Hubby had the Feinberg which was a sweet apricot sauce with just a hint of spice, and I had the Bobby Q, their signature barbeque sauce. Both were equally outstanding. To compare them would be apples and oranges because one is sweet and spicy and the other is bold and tangy, but both are awesome. 

The macaroni salad was good, but it was just macaroni salad...nothing special. The bread, while ordinary, can double as a vessel for sopping up extra wing sauce as well as the amazing ranch sauce. You're probably thinking, ""eww, ranch on bread."" But trust me, this is not Hidden Valley. The ranch is so good that you'll want to dip something in it. And though it is intended for the chicken, the sauce already on the chicken is so good that it feels a shame to guild such a succulent lily.

The truck only offers full size wings (massive), and long tenders, but no bite size nibblers that are normally common among wing establishments... No worries, just more chicken per bite :)
