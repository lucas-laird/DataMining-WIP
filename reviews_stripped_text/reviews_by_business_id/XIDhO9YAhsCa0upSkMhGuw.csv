700290,2014-08-29,0,XIDhO9YAhsCa0upSkMhGuw,"I LOVE this place. Now, I'm not too big of a fan of Karoke because I am tone deaf and feel embarassed singing in front of other people. My friends love to go, so once in a while I'll join them. I've been to Muse, Que, and now Viva Lounge. I LOVE Viva lounge because their policies are different (for now). In order to reserve the room, you would have to order x amount of food. It is unlimited singing time as long as you order enough food, which is how it is in Asian countries. It's PERFECT for me because I don't sing as much, so I get my money's worth from snacking on the food. 

Now the food is small portions, so it's not really worth it if you just order the food, but it's for food AND singing which makes it awesome! Plus the food is really good. It's way better than Muse's gross food. Their gyoza have some sort of weird sauce, but the chicken wings were so awesome! The fried food like the croquette and the calamari were perfectly fried. The batter was perfectly fried and crispy. I managed to try all the mocktails which were pretty good. There was a coconut one, a mango one, and another one. My friend asked for a honey lemon tea with less sugar, but they weren't able to do that since the drink is premixed. 

They do have a lot of English songs as well Asian songs. The karoke machine is not as easy to handle for people that aren't familiar with Chinese, but I managed it. They actually show music videos of the songs or live concert clips.  

All in all, I would go again. I do not know how long they're going to continue their pricing with ordering x amount of food. They only have 3 karoke rooms, and it doesn't really make business sense to continue with unlimited singing time when other places charge by the hour. So , we shall see!",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,2,0,5,cFXjndM-6B4oObjdwFABsQ
1120801,2016-06-27,0,XIDhO9YAhsCa0upSkMhGuw,"We had a blast at this place. It's a Chinese-style karaoke place, so many things were in Chinese. But no problem!  The nice and extremely accommodating guy working there showed us how to access things on the computer to get songs in English. They have two types of setups for karaoke. You can get a private room with a set price to include food and drinks or you can pay for the room by the hour, which is pricier. The other option, which we liked and chose, was to sing in the lobby area with a bar for free. That's if you're not shy with people around. It was comfortable with lounge chairs and two large TV monitors. We were lucky to have the whole place to ourselves, so we went crazy singing everything. The drinks were very reasonable. I would give them 5 stars if the karaoke system was more accessible to English-speaking people and if it were updated because he said it didn't have newer songs. We had no problem finding things to sing, but it's always better to have more of a selection.",y5YNzZwQuYxgE-jSDcZLxA,1,0,4,dse_PlgUXCGqwXz5DKX1IA

Inexpensive for the min charge, could get around 4 dozen of beer, had a good time, service was good. One tip is that the small room is kinda too small for 6, perfect for 2-4 person. Their fried duck tongue was really good!",vO0b1QHrL_EPt4IwGNdx8Q,0,0,4,sWNM-FOuDBjGKCKcL-kTRA
1620713,2017-08-30,0,XIDhO9YAhsCa0upSkMhGuw,"I had a blast at this karaoke spot with my friends. However there is a limit that u must spend for a room but it is also unlimited singing time so you can basically stay for as long as you want. I love that they serve food/snacks so you basically get your money's worth with food/drinks while singing. 

The only downfall would be the karaoke system. Its all in Chinese and since I am not Chinese, it is a little hard to understand/use but I managed to figure it out. They don't have as many of the new english songs that I wanted to sing but there were most. I do wish the audio was louder in the rooms tho lol. Also, I only saw about 4 rooms so if you're looking to rent a room I suggest calling them as soon as they open (8pm) to reserve a room. My group was the only one at the lounge that night so it was kind of empty but I didn't mind. 

Overall, I really like this place because its a good place to hangout until late.",kWJmfzdwmeQl3j3m6y0iEA,0,0,4,1OwLOkEHhBgGUSIT8iQ1XA

Very happy with the song selection (they helped us hook up the English, though we also went a little nuts enjoying random Korean songs and Psy). Pricing was unbelievable. Be warned, there's a little awkwardness in buying drinks etc. (these guys should hook up Square to replace their pen & paper & handheld calculator system), but could not have possibly beat the price or quality!",68LbpVsi0LpjlzBBFcabOA,1,0,5,xhoPe9kvHXcw7Ww3MPnx_A

But let me tell you about Viva Lounge. It was one of the best parties I have ever had. Every single person who came (about 15 of us) were all a bit skeptical, but after the night was done, we could not stop talking about our amazing night.

I reserved a medium private room, and wished I got the larger one! The bottle service was inexpensive, the music selection was great and fun to pick out with the touch screen TV we had, and the food was delicious.

We raged on from 10 to close (5am)!!  The manager even came in the room with us to have a few beers and belt out some tunes.

I would definitely go back again, plus recommend it to anyone who wants to have a great night with your friends.

Thank you for a memorable birthday!",XD05VM607sNjNvlg4_njUQ,3,0,5,V4BAnCZ51neYravC4Ur9gw

You can either karaoke in the main lounge, or get private rooms.. I believe there's a 120-150$ minimum you have to spend on food/services? You don't pay by per person.

There's a touch screen song selection menu, that also controls speed, subtitles, volume, etc. From Chinese, Korean, to English songs - there's quite to choose from.

I recommend ordering ""Wonderland"" - it was the best drink I've tasted from there, and not too strong.

The majority of people here were asian - just an fyi!",8RZTbznCSGLYHtAl_gXk3w,2,1,4,n9QBAeYdsbtyAxYu9VHYWg
3876813,2015-07-17,0,XIDhO9YAhsCa0upSkMhGuw,Great selection of modern Chinese songs and modern billboard songs. Great touch screen system that makes it easy to choose the songs you want. Only con is it's super expensive. 150 minimum charge for a small private room.

4554449,2017-01-01,0,XIDhO9YAhsCa0upSkMhGuw,"A group of about 8 of us came here on a Tuesday night for my friend's birthday. We were able to easily get a private room which was awesome. We were secluded to our own personal room of karaoke embossment with our own personal machine. 

They had a variety of Asian songs along with American ones. We were easily able to download anything that we wanted. We also did bottle service with grey goose, orange juice and green tea. The price ended up being under $175 which is incredibly reasonable to share between a group of people. 

This place is super fun & reasonably priced. Great for birthdays or just hanging out & having fun times with friends.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,1,2,5,WEIWEfr8rrmel4NK4-zdcQ

My favorites would be the chicken wings, gyoza, curry fish balls and the duck wings!
