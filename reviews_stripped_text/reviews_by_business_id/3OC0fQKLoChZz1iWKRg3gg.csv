It's something like $6 or $7 for them and they're a decent size and very filling. They make it for you right on the spot so it's always hot and fresh.

I also need to point out that their fries are freakin' amazing. One time my friend ordered them and I couldn't stop having ""just one more."" They really taste like In N Out fries, but a little better seasoned. 

Also, the staff is incredibly nice. I was worried since I came in the morning-time to order a lunch food that they might get annoyed, but nobody even thought twice about it. It's my favorite part of Downtown Grand.",O60kMLO3IdqRkajj75DgBQ,0,0,5,1i2RsfnXAgcTxxkazaJWeA

The soda calibration was set to more carbonation than syrup, my bun fell apart, and the fries were bottom of the barrel with so many tiny pieces and shriveled.  Take some pride in your quality of food.",plLPOMp3k7h8-B9NBDA00A,2,1,1,R1JAasP8We2bmqyOilUCSQ

The bacon was great.  Excellent turkey meat piled high, and the bread was also excellent.
I look forward to coming back again!",gyTYQo6Cn4BYB4z-McRDaA,0,0,4,isZDX8fv3UXAE8AWrKcReQ

Also, reasonably priced. Less than $10 for a sandwich. The counter people are also really friendly.",wPfO0bhqtn-20K79nUICTA,25,26,5,0L540om5LFf-u_2O036jMw
