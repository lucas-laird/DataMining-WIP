Prices are also very reasonable I don't know why other reviews are saying they're over priced. Definitely recommend going here for Korean food.,GDY4uPjkrGId-ENRtU8_WQ,0,0,5,pUtzLtnqzdKs8-ME_XUQmw

2829148,2017-12-29,0,TrVKJkWWQeMTK_ly0PMGtg,"I really wasn't aware what of this restaurant served, but I decided to give it a try. So basically, it's Korean  food. The menu had no pictures, so I had no idea what some things were. I decided to order just a standard short ribs. First off, it's way too expensive for the portions. I got two slabs of ribs for almost 19 dollars. It wasn't bad, but I can tell you it wasn't good, 19 dollars good. The servers weren't rude, but they also weren't that helpful. The other thing that bugged me was the fact that I was the only one in the restaurant. My meal took at least an hour. During that whole time, there was no other customers. I thought since this restaurant was new, I would give it a try, usually I'm very fair because I understand how hard running a new restaurant can be. Hence the reason I'm leaving a two star. I won't be back with those prices for sure",oegRUjhGbP62M18WyAL6pQ,1,1,2,lplXUqx7Ja-eb_BEnN45ZA

I had the Tofu Stew Bulgogi lunch combo. Although the portion of Bulgogi was a tad small, I thought this was a screaming deal for 12.99. The Soft Tofu Stew, to my pleasant surprise, was chock full of seafood. I was served 7 different sides. They were all delicious. I was offered refill of the sides but declined as I was too full.

In my opinion, their food and services are okay, but the price isn't just  worthy at all. That is probably why this place is unpopular. I would choose other different places which have similar Korean food. It's not like we only have a single option, right?Do less portion with cheaper price or same portion with cheaper price.

This is the place to go if you love spicy food. Usually, I go to BWW and get the Blazing which it's the last HOT level! and This place has some spicy food level 1 - 7. I can maybe eat 4? that's how spicy they make food here.
If you want to challenge yourself, go for it! Lol That's what I did. I ordered 7  at first and I could not even continue eating after one or two bite. But Spicy foods are so good!!! I like my food in level 3-4 now. lol
Price wise.. I can say it might sounds pricey but portion wise.. I am good with it. 
I highly recommended to try their food from HOT & SPICY menu, if you like spicy food. This is the place to go!",oJaGizd-tV9_CEWGcKyukw,3,3,5,qZrZ8IpXkaJ60QJjxSjWtA
4999979,2018-04-29,0,TrVKJkWWQeMTK_ly0PMGtg,"My friend had this place bookmarked for a while and we finally decided to try it. 
There was three of us on a Wednesday night at 8PM. The restaurant has a lot of tables and seating.... and it was EMPTY. Except for two grandpas sitting a few tables down from us. 

Looking over the menu, everything was overpriced. We decided on sharing two items, the kimchi pancake and kimchi pasta. 
The waiter was nice and helpful. He gave us the alcohol promotion going on and opinions when we asked for what was popular at this restaurant that didn't include pork. [My friend does not eat pork, it makes her sick].

The kimchi pancake came out first. It was good/average. The concern I had with the pancake was, in some bites there was something chewy. I assumed it was seafood bits and didn't bother to ask. But it did confuse me a little since normally kimchi pancakes don't have seafood unless you order seafood pancake.... 

The kimchi pasta came out and my friends were eating it. I took a bite and immediately only tasted bacon [not kimchi]. I looked over at my friend who was trying to pretend it was fine. I immediately called over the waiter to inquire if the pasta has pork. The waiter looked horrified and quickly took back the plate and told us he will bring out a new kimchi pasta without pork. We weren't angry or frustrated at all.
Yet, to show his sincerity, the waiter offered a free soft drink for the issue. It was a small issue, but I was thankful for customer service he offered.

TLDR; The food serviced here is overpriced. For the price, the meal quality is not equivalent. Service was great.",1FHuwBk4bpkbEq3iu3LQSg,1,2,3,VmtfrF8BVmu5WwePRVOqow

5349216,2018-01-09,0,TrVKJkWWQeMTK_ly0PMGtg,"Came here for a late dinner this past Saturday with my friends and my husband. We were originally going to Hon Pocha for dinner instead but their last call was 8:30 pm (closes at 9:00 pm) and by the time we got there, it was 8:45 pm or so. Ugh. It was super annoying because there were certain dishes that I was craving. 

We ended up at YasikNara -- it's actually a similar establishment to Hon Pocha. Both places serve pocha style foods. 

What is pocha? Pocha is short for ""pojangmacha"" which literally means covered wagon. We typically refer it as a tent nowadays and they are the terms used for street vendors. It refers more to the street vendors on the street that has a tent over them, which is really popular during the winters in Korea and typically really popular during the late nights. They serve appetizers, noodles, and soups. Different pochas will have different menus -- so pretty much like a restaurant. Whenever you eat at a pocha, there's is always liquor involved. If you've watched any Korean dramas, you have most likely seen one. It's usually the one tent place with chairs, tables, and the main actor/actress is getting drunk.There's actually not too many traditional pocha places in the big city anymore. They have mostly moved into brick and mortars now. 

Unfortunately at YasikNara, they don't have liquor available yet. I assume that they are waiting for their liquor license. Huge bummer because Korean late night foods is not the same without some beer and soju. 

YasikNara has an extensive selection on their menu. They range from your usual Korean dishes such as kimchi pancakes, ddukbokki (spicy rice cake), and fried chicken to your not-so-usual but traditional pocha dishes such as soondae (blood sausage), spicy chicken feet, and raw sea snails.  They even incorporated some fusion items like kimchi pasta into their menu. So no matter the type of Korean food you like, you'll definitely find them here. 

We decided to get an order of fried chicken $15, spicy chicken feet with fried rice $20, and stir fried chicken gizzard $15. The spicy chicken feet is located on their ""hot n spicy"" section of the menu and on this section, you are able to choose how spicy you want it, on a scale of 0-7. If you want an idea of how spicy is spicy, the waitress told us that 2 was a medium spicy. I'm an adventure go-er. If you've read my reviews, I am also a glutton for spicy pain. I can handle my heat and I will challenge the scale if you tell me your 2 is medium. But why is your scale so tilted? I asked what is the base to their spice levels -- was it gochujang (red pepper paste) or tons of peppers or what was it? She told me it was chili extracts. Well then.. from my personal experience on chili extracts, you don't want to fuck with it. My friend and I whimped out and decided to get a level 3 for it -- we weren't in the mood to have fiery butts. Keep in mind, the fried rice that you get with it uses the same sauce that the chicken feet comes in. 

The fried chicken came to the table first. They use a whole chicken for the dish and it's a pretty small chicken. It's probably the same size chickens as the ones you find at Greenland. They cut it in quarters for you, comes with shredded cabbage with thousand island, and it also has dipping salt for it. It actually reminded me of deep fried quail. The chicken itself was pretty decent and it was fried really well. However, it doesn't remind me of Korean fried chicken very much .. 

The spicy chicken feet was not boneless. There is a boneless version but it was $25 versus the $17, plus $3 for the rice. A level 3 spice is spicy. It hits you, lingers, and builds as you keep eating. I would probably compare it to a level 10 at a Thai restaurant. It was super delicious though and I wouldn't mind getting it again. However, I would prefer the boneless version but I don't think it's worth $25 for it. 

Lastly, the stir fried chicken gizzards. It came with two different types of dipping sauces: sesame oil with salt and pepper and something similar to Tabasco. The dish was okay .. I think I would have preferred it to have a bit more flavor. But then again, it could be because the chicken feet had a ton of flavor to it so everything else seemed a bit bland. 

I think YasikNara is a pretty decent place to grab some Korean dishes that you can't get anywhere else in this city. I honestly really enjoyed it. However, the only thing that is keeping me from coming back would be their price point. Their price point is entirely too high for what they are serving. I understand that they are a restaurant from LA but even for LA, those prices are a bit high. I am not sure if they're charging high prices because of how unique their dishes are but it's just not my cup of tea. I mean, they have french fries on the menu for $10, steamed egg for $10, and their sea snail dishes are $30. 

Three stars for their chicken feet and spice levels. I'll definitely come back if they can lower their prices.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,0,3,z7ZYZcJaQyBwc7jtAMUAiQ
5508646,2018-05-25,1,TrVKJkWWQeMTK_ly0PMGtg,"We ordered the kalbi, which came with 3 pieces. Even worse with no flavor. We were very surprised someone can actually make kalbi ribs this bad.... we had tofu stew which was very flavorless. We ordered pig hocks which should be a classic Korean dish. The sauce was not good and still very flavorless. I like the service and the idea of Korean tapas, but they really need to be able to make good food.
