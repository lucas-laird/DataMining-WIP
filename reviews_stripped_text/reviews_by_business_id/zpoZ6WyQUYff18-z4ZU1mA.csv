These guys really know their stuff. Friendly and knowledgeable who support local businesses/products (bon breads/artisanal foods). Their foie&....omg, definitely a must try. Rich, creamy, and indulgent. Date added extra crispy chicken skin and don't be afraid to try the same. They sometimes run out of it so get it when you can.

The fluff&nutt monte cristo style on white caters to anyone who loves sweets. Definitely another must try especially if you're wanting some dessert. Can't go wrong with the falafel or reuben-ish either. As for the le pig, I can't seem to remember much about it so it doesn't strike me as something memorable. 

Open til 1A Fri/Sat. Stop by if you happen to karaoke at Dino's, decide to check out some people in their birthday suits at OG, or are coming from bars downtown.

Tip: text their number ahead of time with your order to have it ready by the time you arrive.

The menu has had some recent changes bc I wanted to have the foie sandwich which is all over previous yelp reviews. If I were them I would always have a small stock and keep it limited for regulars or people fiending that sandwich. No where I have ever seen has a sandwich with foie gras.

Anyways I had the Cuban esque today and it's exactly what I wanted. I love that they use classic thick slices of square bread. It really gives a true homestyle feel and deli type feeling to it to. If your a fan of Cuban sandwiches then surrender bc this sandwich is the truth. Menu has is priced from 3,5,7,9 Sammies and that doesn't include chips, drinks, or add one. Josh the owner is the man very honest guy and super chill to talk to.

We also got the Cobb salad and pig of the week (don't remember the exact name). First of all, my egg salad was way too runny! It was literally falling out of my sandwich any time I held it up. I ended up splitting it and eating it like regular toast. It was supposed to have chorizo on top but it was sprinkled ever so lightly that it seemed they completely missed that step. Not only that but the actual amount of food in the sandwich was like they ran out and scraped the bottom of the bowl The Cobb salad had 5 pieces of tofu. FIVE. Otherwise it was okay--for some reason the nuts had actual sugar, it was too much. The POTW was salty but had the best flavor. 

We were also so excited to get the pickles. WHICH WASNT PUT IN MY BAG. Wow, wasted even more money than we had to. And let me say this, it was dead in there. We were the only ones ordering and there was another two people just using the WiFi. To me, it's unacceptable to miss the little stuff! We tried the chocolate cookie as well. It was okay, a little hard--don't recommend. 

Overall, would not recommend. Everything was $34 which felt like a waste of money for what we actually got (and didn't get). However, cashier was super friendly.",FmoVrFg68MeMaCeGUrmEWQ,0,0,2,5jdp61UDjNciW4Oaq2yhgg

When they were in a stand on the BLVD they were great, efficient, affordable, and fast. Now that they have a proper restaurant with 5 people cooking, two people checking you out, an expo and the owner running around, good luck getting your sandwich. i went in, ordered quickly and was given a number. There were only a couple customers before noon, so I expected the same speedy service. Instead, I waited 30 mins for two sandwiches, one of which was vegetarian. I went up to check on my food, was told ""they were checking on it,"" waited another 5 minutes only to be handed a bag that had been sitting there for 30 mins. When the owner himself handed me the bag and I told him that this bag *with my name on it* had been sitting there for 30 mins and I had checked on my order a couple times, he said, ""sorry, we didn't have your number."" He made no effort to actually make the customer service experience better by offering me anything, a drink, a refund, a voucher, anything but a shoulder shrug. Let me also say that I'm a very visibly 8 months pregnant, which makes letting me stand there for 30 mins and responding rudely if not at all that much more egregious in my mind.

The wifie and I decided to check out the Goodwich after hearing so many good things about this place. We ordered the Foie and the Le Pig. Both were excellent sandwiches and were well thought out. 

Let's start with the Le Pig. This had a great balance of both flavor and texture. The lime ginger radish\slaw went well with the rich pork and the crunchy texture of the chicharones made it all come together. It somewhat reminded me of a torta (Mexican sandwich) without the beans. 

The Foie was a little bit more interesting. The Foie pate was paired with somewhat of a cabbage jam which made it a little sweet and chicken skin which again added the crispy texture. In my opinion I would have added a few more extra pieces of chicken skin as it got masked by the strong flavor of the foie. I would recommend getting either their house pickles or their pickled beets along with this sandwich to cut through the richness of the sandwich.
 
I want to come back and try a few of their other sandwiches, maybe even create my own (fried egg with lots of chicken skin and bacon) mmmm I can feel my heart slowing down.

Owned and operated by 2 guys who say they've been in the fine dining world of F&B here in Vegas for awhile...decided to take everything they learned, and open up a unique twist on making sandwiches.

Everything is done ""monte cristo"" style(or not)...dipped in egg batter and fried. Menu items go from $3 up to $9. I really loved the sandwich with foie and crisp chicken skin! My GF thought her spanish sandwich was delicious, with just the right amount of heat! Then we split the nutella and marshmallow sandwich as dessert. 

Since both the guys were there making and serving food, the service was top notch! They said they plan on one of them being there all the time. Open lunch and dinner, including late night.

644048,2014-04-04,1,zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA,"The Goodwich should be named the Greatwich. Operating out of the stand that used to house Viva Las Arepas in the parking lot of Dino's this little stand makes excellent sandwiches. Their menu consists of four different prices $3,5,7 or $9. We shared the Le Pig and Foie&. Both were excellent. The Le Pig had bacon belly and butt, ginger, aioli, and some sort of pickled tapanade - it was rich but also had a lot of spring flavors which were refreshing and fulfilling.  I had it on rye bread, the rye wasn't a great match and was a little overpowering so I think if I were to get it again I would have it on white or wheat. The Foie& was well rich, as to be expected with a foie pate, and hot with the foie melting out of the sandwich - it would have gone well with a glass of wine. It was recommended that the Foie come on white bread, which makes sense considered it is common to serve foie with white toast points. The crispy chicken skin added a nice texture contrast.  Both sandwiches were $9 each but well worth it. The person taking our order was very friendly and came and checked on us while we sat in our car and ate our sandwiches. Also ordered the $2 house made pickles, they were sweet pickles and I really liked them but it is a small portion size for $2 and they come sliced. If I were to guess maybe a 2 oz portion so I don't think I would order those again. I would suggest that they move their menu up higher as it sits on the ground right now and I couldn't read it until I was up front as customers in line kept blocking the menu and I don't think I will be frequenting this spot, unless I get it to go, in the summer considering the heat. Also, note I attempted to walk over to the Art of Flavor after wards to top off my lunch but they are closed on Mondays.

Also, I just read Rod U.' s review, I agree this is not in the same category as Katz's or Carnegie but I think they are doing very well for a little shack that just opened in a town that isn't known for sandwiches. Also, I think it is foie - I have had a lot of foie and foie pate in my life (don't tell PETA) and it tasted like foie and not chicken liver to me. Also, I have had plenty of foie which have a mineral flavor to it, the iron as in any liver will tend to lend a mineral quality, if you do not soak the foie long enough while preparing a pate then a mineral flavor will remain so I do not agree that alone is indicative of it not being foie gras pate.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,3,4,4,or7YuRNqBEwxGPaqQ1R_Og

It's lunchtime and I've heard great things about this place from yelp. I had a feeling this place wouldn't disappoint.

My boyfriend and I ordered the falafel and the chicken club sandwiches, then split to share. Ranging from $3-$9, this is a perfect affordable lunch spot. 

There is some seating available, but I think there's only one table and a few other chairs. Great place to grab something on-the-go! 

You have a choice of white, wheat, or rye bread. There's also add-ons like fried egg ($1), chip bits ($0.50), cheese ($1), crisp chicken skin ($2), bacon ($2), and foie gras mousse ($4). I should have added chip bits to mine!

Falafel: kale slaw, cucumber, and chickpea puree between two slices of bread.
Kale slaw wasn't bitter, perfectly wilted, and worked well with the cucumber for that crispy crunch. The chickpea puree in it tied it all together. Slightly chunky and dripping with just the right amount of dill sauce (I think), it was an explosion of flavor and quite filling. Delicious.

Chicken Club: Soft chicken bits mixed with wilted veggies, provolone, bacon, tomato, and ginger. Amazing. So tasty that I'd want my boyfriend to propose to me on the spot in the backdrop of Goodwich with me cramming this sandwich into my mouth. Greasy sandwich but oh so worth it. The flavor combination was incredible. Savory, muted sweetness from the cheese, and the fresh veggies balance it out. Also filling. The ginger wasn't overpowering and complemented the other ingredients well. 

It didn't feel like there was needless ingredient in the sandwiches. All of it ""made sense."" Even their assortment of some unique sodas and chips that you wouldn't find at the grocery store was a cool touch.

The owner actually took our order. He was funny, entertaining, and incredibly patient in answering all of our questions about the menu. Listening to him talk about old Las Vegas and his Vegas-native roots was cool. While we were waiting for our sandwiches, he kept thanking us for our patience and letting us know the status of our order when it wasn't even a long wait at all! We got a sense that he truly appreciated our business and us being there. Love his '50s old-Vegas style he's got going on. 

Everything from the ingredients; the carefully wrapped wax paper with the Goodwich sticker stamped on it; and the white paper bag with the logo was well-thought out. They really put so much effort into the stand's theme. It made me feel this place is one-of-a-kind, memorable. 

The whole concept of Goodwich is something real, uncorporatized, and individual. A refreshing change from Downtown Project's approach (Container Park is just trying way too hard). It's just one block away from other amazing eats like Viva Las Arepas and Art of Flavors. (We hopped to Art of Flavors afterwards for a sweet contrast!)

I'd love to come back and pack a few sandwiches and hit the park with picnic blankets and a book. Love this sandwich shop and all that it stands for.",tQvoC8V-kvw6t0VIBbrd9A,10,7,5,ehPk40nreO1tfefBMWFX3g

With a sandwich like their Le Pig, a lot can go wrong: too much grease, too little grease, overly acidic pickled radishes, boring bread with the wrong texture, and so on. However, the Goodwich expertly combines various ingredients to create the perfectly balanced, yet flavorful sandwich.  It's hard to describe, but kind of like a well aged, 20-25 year old Ramon Allones Specially Selected or Partagas Lonsdale cigar, where a complex variety of rich, intense flavors complement one another in perfect harmony.  

The food is good, the prices are reasonable, and the proprietors not only know what they're doing, but are friendly and hospitable.  Will definitely be back.

Keep up the great work Goodwich! Slowly you'll become a Sin City lunch landmark.

If all else fails, change locations closer to the Strip, and change your name from The Goodwich to The Godwich or The Sinwich.

We ordered a pate sandwich and a Le Pig Vert and retreated to Dino's for a beer.  The sandwiches arrived at Dino's after a short wait and they were outstanding.  The pate was a bit much, though.  I had a lot of trouble getting through 1/2 a sandwich, and I'm a fat guy.  The pig sandwich was also fantastic and a bit easier to digest.  Think I'll try something different on my next visit.

The employees at the Goodwich were friendly and helpful.

Don't be afraid to go into Dino's...it's a dive bar and all, but I've been there several times just to drink and everyone is very nice.  And domestic beers are only $2.50.  So there's that.

I've got to believe the owners will move to a better location soon.  This isn't the greatest area and it's too damn hot to eat a sandwich outside.",SygwXJI8crPvG7owdPSeDA,0,0,4,qotoBnJDPiAQL_PILbsL3g
1118390,2016-04-28,0,zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA,"I'm going to go so far as to call The Goodwhich a near-complete failure. Maybe I ordered poorly . . . maybe they had a bad day . . . or maybe they just make a mediocre sandwich. I ordered the Cold Brown, which really sounds amazing (most of their sandwiches do sound great). But lets break this down from menu to reality: Pulled turkey = sliced turkey lunch meat; there was nothing ""pulled"" about this, except maybe from the bag. There was indeed bacon, though it was no different than what I'd get at Smith's, so I'm not sure what the big deal is. I asked for no tomato, but instead my sandwich came with a total of FOURTEEN slices of tomato. There was no guryere, but there was some random flat-leaf parsley and a rather gloppy mayo-like sauce, neither of which were listed as items. I would have asked for those to be left off too, but it probably wouldn't have made a difference. I also ordered some ""jalapeno"" chips . . . quotes used because I tasted nothing but salt. And lets not forget to mention just how absurdly greasy the sandwich was. Other folks in my group really liked their orders, and clearly The Goodwich has a following and history of rave reviews. Personally, I was thoroughly disappointed. At least it was a reasonably sandwich, so I'm not out a big chunk of change for mediocre food.",M_JB5tiXDnpoBTXYwzyIvQ,0,0,2,tXUiRqic1YraRpm5UtpzNQ

I was worried if one sandwich would fill me up but it was packed with savory pork, fontina cheese, rocket (which is similar to arugula), and chip bites for added texture and crunch. This business was created by guys who used to work on the Strip at places like Aureole and Prime. They use the kitchen in Dino's next door to do most of the prep work and create just about everything from scratch except the bread and some cheeses. They even make their own peanut butter! Other items are prepped and sandwiches sold from a small stand/kiosk several feet away from Dino's on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Wyoming street. This is the same kiosk that was previously occupied by a taco shop and Viva Las Arepas.

With that being said, I'm always looking for unique sandwich places and I found it! The Goodwich was kind of hard to find as my GPS was taking me around and around the block, but that's okay because when I finally did find it, I had worked up a pretty good appetite.

The shop was very clean and had sleek and modern lines. It definitely gives the surrounding area a needed facelift. We were greeted right away and the cashier was enthusiastic to go over the menu with us since it was our first time. 

The thing I like most about the Goodwich and what sets it apart are the various options. Many other sandwich shops have a menu that never ever changes, but the Goodwich changes their menu seasonally. Plus they have their base menu which offers a different taste from other shops. On top of that, there are additional topping options that you can add to most of the base sandwiches. 

We ordered the Patty, the Tomato, and the street corn sandwiches. My sandwich was the tomato, but I added pulled turkey to make it a little more meaty. The sandwich was juicy and was just the kind of different I was looking for after having 163637382 Italian sandwiches. Haha. I also had a side of potato salad, which the shop dressed up street corn style. I'm assuming that changes with the season as well. The potato salad was good and had a good crunch that set it even further apart from a traditional potato salad.

I also really like that the shop has a rewards program that automatically links to your payment card as opposed to having to keep track of a stamp card.

I really liked the Goodwich and they made an excellent first impression. I will be back.",l--K3xQWVqs93iFhAoEYag,2,3,5,n_21l9m5XAt35wYjfZAiYA

Yes that little shack right in front of Dino's Lounge. ""The Foie"" with foie gras mousse was absolutely divine! I'm still drooling over it! 
 
They sell a variety of sandwiches all made from scratch, quality ingredients, from good ol comfort food grilled cheese, corned beef made in house to gourmet ones with Foie gras.  The menu consists of 3 different sandwiches in each of the prices points of $3,5,7 & 9 dollars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-goodwich-las-vegas?select=mErnsRlLQ-9ayHB7-iUMvA#mErnsRlLQ-9ayHB7-iUMvA  For THREE DOLLARS you  get your choice of a grilled cheese, fried egg or a nutella sandwich. THREE DOLLARS!!!  You can also add a fried egg, bacon, crispy chicken skin, foie gras and make it your own style for a nominal charge. It's a regular sized sammie as well. So it's pretty filling. 
 
Love the textures and nice flavors going on with ""The Foie"" It had a whipped Foie Gras mousse spread, almonds. There subtle sweetness to it...I think raisins or some kind of fig jam?...  It was also layered with crispy chicken skin and cabbage. Toasted Rye bread was my choice for this gourmet sandwich. Like I said it was so good. Worth the nine bucks to me.
 
The guys who own and run the place are cool. We met Jake. He took our orders. Cool that he already is recognizing his returning customers. Shout out to the guy who made the sandwiches. They are delicious!  Oh also if you have the foie gras sandwich, it goes great with the Rose gelato over at Art of Flavors!

Heads up: they take both cards and cash. They're open late (1am!!!) on some nights now. It's a food stand so no dining area except for the few stylish white chairs and stools for seating. So it's basically take and go kinda spot. There is parking available since they share the same parking lot with Dino's. They mention on the menu you can call or text your order in advance.  Im so doing that  just to make sure I get the Foie, because I know that's going to be one of the hottest sandwiches and it's  gonna fly out that window!",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,15,8,5,Mb4PbkTqwOvUydCNa6z2jw

PBB&J: peanut butter + pepper jam + bacon. A bit too sweet for me but I really like the red pepper jelly. Definitely needs a glass of milk to go down.
BLTG: bacon + greens + good tomato + grits. Subbing greens for lettuce made this more mushy and less fresh than standard BLTs, but in a good way. The bacon cheddar grits really take this to the next level. 
FALAFEL: green pea falafel + chickpea puree + kale slaw + cucumber. One of the closest things to a vegan option, but I think the slaw has feta? Super tasty, super fresh, easily my go-to order. 
SIDES: Not their forte. The quinoa was okay, but the cauliflower ""tabbouli"" was just hard textures and not much flavor. I am not a chip fan, but they remained uneaten on the tables around me. 

Portions are large, service is friendly, but food took a little longer to come out than expected. Seemed like wait time was longer than at their previous, smaller location.

1702394,2014-06-11,2,zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA,"I have to say that when I first tried Goodwich I went 4 times in one week. I brought my husband, I went on my own, we drove far (verrrry far) to get there, and did anything we could to get more of those sandwiches. The next week, we came a couple times and if I could get my hubby who is not a sandwich fan to come back, I guess that means it's pretty good. 

My favorites are the ham (good as monte cristo), patty (oh so guilty after eating it but oh so good! appears to be creamed cheese mixed with hamburger meat, wow bad but tastes so good), and the reuben. The hubby loves the chicharon and keeps finding a way to sneak it on the sandwiches. Tsk tsk. 

The reuben is really outstanding. The mixture of flavors is perfect. I love the kraut they use and the bread is really top notch. I hate rye bread and this bread is out of this world. 

Both the hubby and I were not Le Pig fans, even though we both like pork belly. 

I also love homemade pickles, but for $2 I got 3 slices of a pickle (not 3 pickles, 3 slices) that is way overpriced. 

The wait for your food is long, and has been each time I come. I understand why though since there is just one cook, so I am not knocking them for it. Just expect a wait.

The location is very ""interesting."" Great place to people watch, see strippers and valet and all kinds of people from OG cross the street (legally and illegally, almost getting run over at times), homeless people, walk by customers that once they see the price they walk the other way, freaks, and more. 

There are only a couple chairs, so be ready to take it home, eat in your car, or stand in eat. Those seats were only occupied once out of the many times I have been here. I wish there was a little table next to every chair. My chair I sat at had no table and it made it difficult to eat, put your drink down,purse, etc. It would be nice to provide a small table to each set of chairs. You can also text your order ahead of time so you don't have to wait. Love that option!

What I don't like is the extra charge to use a credit card. I understand under $5 charge to use the card is pretty typical but not when you are spending way above that on a couple sandwiches. I am hoping they can find a way to not charge customers to use their card. I believe using a credit card vs. paying cash is pretty common. So beware-bring cash or you will be charged for using your card. 

What has stopped me from coming back is the greasiness/butter/sauce used. I feel so guilty eating here.

 Although if you want to indulge in tasty, unique, flavorful sandwiches this is the place to go. The owner is amazing by the way and really cool! I will def. be back on my next craving.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,3,2,4,xetNj8X8a8CAnvH7XsLBLw

I am a fan of Goodwich and admire them for being a Las Vegas hit as a food truck and now making their way to be a brick and mortar restaurant, carrying their fans with them. 

I was excited to enter. I like the simple setting. It's cozy enough but still plenty of room. The kitchen is decent size. After working in a food truck for so long, you don't need much room and can make it work anywhere else. There is a TV so you can watch the game. The floor is the shiny concrete style, which I like. 

I didn't know what to order- like usually at places. He said they added things to their menu since the food truck, which is nice. The guy was very helpful with my indecisiveness. I asked if there was anything besides beef or pork. He gave me two options, both vegetarian- the Falafel and the Tomato. I wasn't raving in my head about either but I ordered the Falafel with a side of pickled beets on the side. 

I ate half of my sandwich because it was filling but at the same time not something I was scarfing down my face. I realized that there was a fish option on the menu- Sea Smoke. That totally fit my request of something not beef or pork. And then I saw the Chix Fix with chicken. I wish he told me those options because I would've definitely ordered the Sea Smoke, but I couldn't get mad because I didn't look at the menu thoroughly. 

I noticed they forgot my side of beets with my sandwich. Luckily I didn't take my to-go order right out the door. They made it up to me and gave me a free dessert bar. That was nice of them. The beets had an interesting taste, but I probably wouldn't order it again because the portion size is really small. 

The Goodwich is perfect to stop by if you're already downtown. Easy parking in front.",w1uEa7272-ZXdiTm0aDM8A,0,0,4,ZrVc8Eo20sSiEVDbwro8EA
1941768,2017-08-19,0,zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA,"One thing I love about Goodwich is they change their menu with the foods of the season. 

Their summer vegetable based sandwich is the Street Corn Sandwich.  If you were to put two of the best foods ever conceived together (that is Mexican street corn and grilled cheese) to make a new food, it would explode brains (and tastebuds) as Goodwich has done with their Street Corn Sandwich.  Goodwich has created the most delicious food marriage here.  The corn is cut fresh off the cob and adds an amazingly sweet bite and is paired with a delicious blend of some sort of yellow melty cheese with goat ricotta for amazing creaminess. Then, there's the bread. One thing that makes Goodwich so great is how they prepare their bread... They grill it till crispy!  As with all of their sandwiches you have a choice, and for me the Marbled Rye is the go to.  The rye gives the bread a delicious touch of sour while also adding a ton of health benefits.  The Street Corn Sandwich comes with summer squash, goat cheese ricotta, ancho chile, and lime.  I highly recommend this to my fellow vegetarians. 

In the past I've ordered the Crispy Capo, which includes eggplant caponata that's breaded and fried till crispy, crispy fried cheese, arugula, and roasted perfectly ripe tomato.  It is soooo good and honestly, I recommend this one to just anyone who likes food.

The owner recommended the Reuben-ish on Marbled rye to my husband about 6 months ago, and now is the only sandwich he orders. He claims it's the best sandwich he's ever had.

The owner and team members are always extremely nice and welcoming and genuinely interested in how we're liking their food. They have a true passion for what they do.  In all our time coming here they have never been less than excellent in their customer service, which is so unexpected when walking into a sandwich shop.

It took me a few months to finally try one of their gourmet sandwiches and it makes me a little sad to know that I got to miss out on the sandwiches they had during their first 10 months, BUT I look forward to seeing what new sandwiches will be whipped up just around the corner.

So far I've had the Pulled Squash, the Radish, Fluff & Nut (Monte Cristo Style), & the Fried Egg (all on rye, minus the Fluff & Nut). The Pulled Squash has been removed from the menu since they change a few sandwiches out every two-three months and it has been replaced with the Radish. Even though I loved the Pulled Squash, the Radish has also become a regular veggie favorite of mine. Sometimes the butter can become a little overwhelming and taste a bit too salty, so proceed with caution if you don't enjoy a little too much salty taste!

Fluff & Nut monte cristo style on white has become one of my favorite go-to desserts and I always catch myself craving it again and again. Nutella, homemade marshmallow fluff, and crunchy bites? I need to figure out how to make it myself since I'm going to go broke from always buying it! But yes, get it monte cristo style. Trust.

From what I remember, the fried egg wasn't anything too spectacular for me. It's been a few weeks since I tried it out, but I remember telling myself that I probably wouldn't get again since there are other sandwiches that are really unique and packed with their own flavor.

To make things more efficient, I suggest texting their number listed on the page to get your order in ahead of time. Sandwiches usually have a prep time of 8-15 minutes depending on what you get, but it's definitely worth the wait! I don't usually eat at the location since it's a little corner spot with limited amount of seating, so I always get mine to go. Every order is put in a bag, so you don't have to ask to get it to go! Also, there's a $0.25 fee for using a credit card.",8RuySv_b1YVWVK_0mMqKOw,3,3,5,TEUX7faaYI5p3sQCRJ0MYg

It's even better cause they change their menu every season so there is always something new to try. I am always the person that sticks to what I know but here I'm willing to try everything!! I also LOVE that they have a rewards system but its linked to your card. So it's kinda rough to earn points cause my husband will pay sometimes and I'll pay with my card so they aren't linked together. It's a little pricey and the wait for the food is longer so I wouldn't assume this place to be like a fast food restaurant because the quality is worth the wait. A must try is the PB & J. You think you cant get more basic then that but this place will surprise you. Other then that try everything! The staff is so informative. And the pickles omg don't get me started!!

They had awesome sandwiches and everything we ordered was super tasty. We got the Egg Salad and Cold Brown sandwich. Both were delicious. The Cold Brown was perfectly balanced and tasted very fresh. Each component of the sandwich complimented each other. The Egg Salad was just as tasty. The sandwich had a hint of curry in it which elevated the sandwich to a whole new level and it added more complexity to the overall flavor profile. I'm a sucker for a good egg salad sandwich and this place has one of the tastiest I've ever had. Service was friendly and casual.

2074010,2014-03-27,0,zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA,"Located at the old Viva Las Arepas on Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming Avenue, this is a great place for quick lunch/dinner.  This is an outdoor stall, almost like a food truck, so seating is very limited.  TIP: Enjoy a Goodwich inside Dino's Lounge while having a cold brew.  Too bad they're only open till 1am on weekends as it'd be dope to have one or two of their sandwiches after a long night of drinking.

FOIE& (foie gras pâté, crispy chicken skin, caramelized onions, purple cabbage, almond)  One of my favorites that keeps me coming back to this place!!  Eat it on white bread and add extra crispy chicken skin for more crunch.  One of the guys actually mentioned how they let the chicken skin render in the oven instead of deep frying them.  How can a small shack outside of a dive bar afford to serve fois gras sandwiches for less than $10 bucks?!  Jake gets a great bargain from Artisanal Foods to create the pâté--two parts duck liver and one part chicken liver.  TIP: Eat this sandwich on the spot or have them put the chicken skin on the side if you plan on eating elsewhere to avoid soggy chicken skin.

REUBEN-ISH (corned beef, fennel kraut, switss, 1000 island dressing)  Definitely one of the best in the valley!!  Awesome idea for using fennel instead of cabbage since the anise flavor greatly compliments the meat as well as the marble rye bread.  Corned beef is also tender and quite tasty.  

LE PIG (pork belly, pickled radish, chicharon, vinaigrette)  This sandwich was alright.  Thought it was a little bland and needed more seasoning.  Textures were great though-moist pork belly (homemade at Dino's kitchen) with that crunchy chicharon.  Isn't as greasy as the other sandwiches on the menu.

FLUFF & NUTT (nutella, toasted marshmallow, crunch)  One of the few items on the menu that's good Monte Cristo style.  Tasted like a French toast stuffed with nutella and marshmallow.  Great for late breakfast or dessert.  Thought this was a little too sweet for my liking though.

Overall, the Goodwich is one of the best sandwich joints in Las Vegas.  Amazing food, and superb customer service.  I definitely recommend this place over any other places in town.",6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg,4,2,5,FKIEIRjvvD83m0PXEDPllg

The patty sandwich was my fave because every bite I took, the cheese would just stretch and fall perfectly away from my mouth. The bread was also toasted so perfect that the crunch felt like it was almost deep fried with butter. *eye roll*

The chips were also a must!! I tried the jalapeño chedder and curry one. I recommend both at the same time and switch it off each bite.

2178493,2014-03-26,0,zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA,"The Skinny: gourmet sandwich stand  - classic sandwich combinations with a new twist (4) Service: it's counter service, there's no restrooms and there's no tables. Oh and they charge $0.35 to use a credit card (3) Value: the reuben could have used a little more meat but other than that it's not cost:quality ratio is reasonable (4).

We stopped by the Goodwich after going on a bit of food sampling at a few places.

I opted for the Reuben-ish and the Hubs ordered the Foie&. Both sammy's were $9 and there was a $0.35 service charge for using a credit card.

Let me get this straight - you need to eat these sandwiches immediately.Even though the hubs wanted to leave due to the obvious lack of facilities (there's no tables, restrooms - it's essentially a food stall), I put my foot down on this one. A grilled hot sandwich needs to be eaten while the bread is still crunchy/warm off the grill and the cheese is still in its semi-molten state.

The foie gras was good. A nice thick layer of foie gras mousse deliciousness, the chicken skin, cabbage, and almond created a interesting blend of flavours that really worked well together. My only criticism is that this sandwich is really rich - you'll need at least 2 people to finish this delight. The hubs wished that the mousse was a little more warm because it was a little odd to have a cold layer in this otherwise toasty sandwich. However, I disagreed - mostly because if you heat up a liver mousse it would leave an odd potential curdled texture. The only way that would work is if you used a solid piece of foie and sear it. We agreed to disagree on that point.

The Reuben was great. Loved the fennel with the mild anise flavor in lieu of straight up cabbage - this marries well with beef in general. The 1000 island dressing had a nice tang with the perfect amount in there. The melty swiss min combination with the perfectly toasted bread made this a very interesting textural dish. That being said, the only criticism I have of this sandwich was the it was a little light on the corned beef. It definitely needs a little more meat in there to make a total kick ass Reuben. Considering the amount of meat in there, $9 seemed a bit pricey to the hubs.

The bread they use is great - it's Bon Bread white, whole wheat or marble rye. The only thing that would make this list of options better is if they offered Bon Bread's amazing brioche. Why? because brioche rocks my world. And there's nothing quite like the lightly sweet egg-ish bread going with foie gras. But hey! that's just me. (I also know that a loaf of the brioche is pricey too.)

The BLTG my boyfriend described was as he stated a taste of heaven, inside this masterpiece was constructed with a couple stripes of hickory smoked bacón as well as bacon grits spread on the bottom of the two breads, the addition of the egg made the sandwich even more blissful.

from the flavors to the textures, everything about this sandwich is divine.
what i appreciate most about their sandwiches is that they add a little crunchy texture to each one from pepitas to chicken skins.

Arriving a few minutes before 1am, I was just in time to place the last order of the night. Hot dog! (3)

I ordered the Fluff & Nutt on white bread, Monte Cristo style. My total was $3.78 including a $0.50 charge for the Monte Cristo preparation. I had a chance to chat with Jake, one of the owners, while the cook worked on my order. Jake and his business partner Josh are seasoned chefs who have worked in the kitchens of Michael Mina, Charlie Palmer, and Bradley Ogden, to name a few. Nearly every sandwich ingredient, from corned beef to foie gras mousse, is made fresh at The Goodwich. White, wheat, and rye sandwich breads are sourced from local artisan bakery Bon Breads.

The Fluff & Nutt includes Nutella, toasted marshmallows, and crunch (something coconutty.) Monte Cristo was a good choice, as the result was like Nutella french toast mixed with campfire s'mores. The savory options are perfect if you'll be crossing the street to Art of Flavors for gelato after (or before!) For serving a quality product at a grrr-iffic price meow meow (4), and keeping late hours to accommodate those of us who don't end our work day before midnight, I twinkle think (5) The Goodwich deserves five stars and five references to my daughter's favorite cartoons.

It not thin slice nor is it over thick but just right amount that gets perfect golden crust on flat top and still moist with every bite. Nom. NOM. I got bag of chips wanted the pickle chips but unfortunately they were out. The jalapeno bag of chips just as good with my sandwich.

I was expecting just ham and cheddar cheese but was pleasantly surprised to find the nice crunch of spring mix veggies and what appeared to be grilled diced apples. The sandwich was delicious and full of flavor and only 5 bucks!  The chips were meh and not worth the 2 bucks to me.

Located on the ground floor of the Soho Lofts in the Art District of Las Vegas (disclosure, I am NOT a Vegas person), The Goodwich recently moved to its first brick-and-mortar shop from a small kiosk in a parking lot somewhere else in town.  Very industrial-chic with exposed ac ducts and and lots of concrete.

We were there about 2:00 p.m. so it wasn't too busy (apparently they are quite a lunch destination).  The server, Will (?) was very helpful in asking us if we had any questions and explaining what some of their favorites were.  We ordered two Reben-ish, which includes house-made and cured corned beef, and one Cauliflower Goodwich, which has roasted cauliflower, sweet onion fondue, crispy rice, and curry powder.  Both were made to order and delivered cut on the diagonal and oooooooozing (let me repeat.....oooooozzzzzzzing) with cheesy goodness.  I'm surprised Instagram hasn't blown up with photos and crazy hashtags on Goodwiches.

We also ordered some house-made pickles, which were very good, plus some soda's (from a fancy Coke machine that allows you to add flavors to basic soda's like cherry, orange, lemon, etc.).

Although you order at the the counter (it's not full service), Will came by several times to check on us.  He explained they also serve breakfast and will be starting their Happy Hour offerings soon.  Plus, while it is currently BYOB, they have received their liquor license and will soon be having beers on tap.

If I was still in Vegas, I would go get a Goodwich for lunch today!",qsoKVocz-_QxB1xGDe53Xg,2,0,5,Tf3oH6eDeGeiHmUo9kC0GQ

I have nothing but great things to say about their staff and sandwiches. Everyone I have encountered there is friendly ! I will definitely be back to order my new favorite Ruben sammich and try some of their incredible looking pies, cookies and brownies!

It was the perfect size and I got the right amount of full after eating it. I also tried Patty, which had ground beef, smoked cream cheese, onion and pepperjack. Someone in my party got the patty and added egg, which got positive reviews. We also tried their dark sugar chocolate chip cookies (!!!!) so so good. It reminded of Tates cookies which are also thin and it was a great ending to the meal.

The way that they toast up that bread and just pile everything on it was delish. Its not like your any other sandwich like subway or capriottis or jimmy johns. This is legit like sandwich bread.

That Friday I had to come back for more, and so I tried the 'le pig' and must I say I was literally in heaven. Pork belly with some chicharon oh man!! What can possibly go wrong?! hahaa. And the bread is sooo good like the toppings don't make it soggy or anything. 

Location is right on the corner across from the OG. hahah good location right. But it is right in front of Dinos Lounge where you can wait and eat your sandwich in. There is a little place you can eat where they make the sandwich but since its been soo hot in Vegas nobody wants to eat outside. They also do text to order and you can pick up your order within the next 20 mins. Never tried it before but the guys told me about it. You can also actually see them make your sandwich as well which is pretty awesome.

I didn't know that they've only been there for 6 months, and that's their only location. Which is not bad since its literally down the street from my work so I cant complain.

(Half-Kidding). Trying to now be consistent about reviews, I'll break them down by: Cost, Service, Ambience, Food/Drink, Random Thoughts.

Cost: $10-$20

Service: Somewhat slow, but that's because they are individually making each sandwich, so I'll give them some leeway with that, but definitely don't come here if you're in a super rush to grab some grub. 

Ambience: None? It's a shack on a corner...BUT, unlike the Arepas place that used to use this spot, Goodwich seems to have a great relationship with Dino's (the bar they share the parking lot with). So, while you wait/eat you can go grab a seat in Dino's and buy a beer (do this!). 

Food: Also all of the sandwiches I had were fantastic. The best was probably the Turkey with Boursin cheese and crispy skin. Some great juicy turkey, fresh cheese, with hot grilled Rye bread! Can't beat it. Also great was the Cauliflower and the Peanut Butter. The Cauliflower was a tad messy (lots of sauce) but the crush of the crispy rice was a nice counterpoint to the veggie itself. I was slightly disappointed by the BLTG which, while good, was less exciting flavor wise than the others.

Ruben- This is the best sandwich here. I prefer rye bread. Expect savory corned beef with swiss and kraut oozing inbetween. You should feel guilty eating this. And don't eat this with another sandwich. Get two rubens if you have to.

PB&J- I don't think they have this anymore, but it's a simple sandwich I think about a lot. It had spicy jelly, peanut butter, and bacon. So good.

Chicken- Good sandwich, but don't eat it side by side with the ruben. It will make you think it's not that good even though it's messy and yummy. I mean it has chicken skin in it.

BLT&G- thick bacon and grits patty. Also good if you don't eat it side by side with the ruben. 

Fried Egg- I was disappointed with this one, kinda dry. To make it better get other stuff in it.

Cold Brew Coffee- Wasn't that strong, in fact it was watery and only bitter notes came through.

I suggest calling in your order or coming when the weather is nice. Make sure you have plenty of napkins. I'm usually full from one sandwich, no side. Also the men that run this shack are easy to talk to.",mxwMqra7TEZ6K4ML3DgPmA,10,9,4,U5h-RLtwrSjKT2PQre-Ccg

the Goodwich is located on Las Vegas Boulevard and Wyoming, a small free standing food shack in the Dino's parking lot.  They are billed as ""STACKED-RITE SANDWICHES"" and I agree!

I had the pleasure of trying the ""Le Pig"" and the Foie.  These are both wonderful options.   the Le Pig (or le The Porc if you prefer) is full of flavor!  It is pork belly with a truffled vinaigrette, crunchified chip pieces, and fontina. The Foie was rich for sure with some fine foie gras mousse, cabbage, carmalized (balsamic?) onions and pieces of almond for taste,and texture.

I saw a grilled cheese with a fried egg that looked inciting.  They also will do any sandwich monte cristo style for $.50.  There are lots of elevated foodie options going on here!  I hope this place does well...Dino's a great dive bar, but I'm not sure if the patrons will appreciate the more sophisticated option at the Goodwich.

It is this critics opinion, that the quality of sandwiches at Goodwich might even be better at the other sandwich place he frequented, Earl of Sandwich. This is true given the fact that Goodwich was more generous with their portions.

The only thing that truly bugged me was the fact that there was a $2.00 upcharge for pickles.

We actually came here for the ""Foie&"" madness, but unfortunately the Vegas summer heat had been way too harsh (the foie mousse was quickly melting inside of the quaint little shack), so they had to take it off the menu and replace it with Pate&. 

One thing can be equally said about all of the sammies - the white bread that was used had delicious buttery flavor. Here's what we tried:

- Pate& ($9) Pâté de campagne, radish, rocket, piccalilli. Thick slices of soft pâté with lots of refreshing, crunchy radish and rocket greens. Interesting, sophisticated and playful flavors. It's not a bad choice, it just wasn't our flavor favorite. Flavor rating: 3/5

- Fried Egg ($3) Broke yolk, sea salt, & butter. It's as simple as it sounds - a fried egg sammy! It was too simple and nothing exciting. More on the disappointing side. I would recommend this one for a picky eater or a young'n! Flavor rating: 2/5

- Roasted Carrot ($5) let me first state, I'm an avid meat eater/lover but this veggie sammy was incredible! Roasted sweet carrots with homemade house ricotta, sweet honey gastrique, crunchy pepita - so amazing! The creamy house made ricotta really tied everything together and the subtle sweetness of the honey gastrique added the extra special touch. The carrots are roasted to perfection and have a slight bite to them. The nuts added exciting texture. Not to mention it's such a vibrant and colorful sammy! Beautiful! I would order this again and again. Flavor rating: 5/5

The shack is truly charming and I adore the newly painted robot mural - super cutesy and nerdy! The perfect pop of art and color that brightens up Vegas! 

They don't really have much going on for patio seating or comfortable seating, for that matter. They are partnered up with Dino's Lounge right next door and you are encouraged to grab your sammies and head over to the bar to escape from the hot sun, the sweltering heat, grab a table, and a seat, and enjoy your Goodwich. Just make sure you don't have kids with you, it's a 21+ bar.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,11,6,4,S2upResoaTDN1KRu7nchpg

I have pretty high standards for sandwiches having been spoiled by Ike's in San Francisco for several years, Fricano's in Austin, and Naked City Sandwich Shop while it existed in Vegas. This place is on point!! My boyfriend decided to pull one of those ""I'm not hungry but I'll go with you"" moments, and being the bread and cheese aficionado that I am, I didn't care. Pulled up the menu on my phone and saw that first off, all sandwiches are either $3, $5, $7, or $9 (so amazing), and that I could text to order (so convenient). I decided to go with the Patty with a side of house pickles and I was NOT disappointed. We drove over to Dino's (Goodwich is inside), and got our order curbside right on time (15 minutes was the sandwich eta). I NEVER ever everrrr eat in my car but I truly could not wait another moment-- and this sandwich was unbelievable. Bread perfectly grilled, high quality ingredients, amazingly friendly sandwich man, delish side of pickles and beets-- it took all of 30 seconds before my boyfriend realized I probably wasn't going to share, and put in his order for a Falafel sandwich. Again-- superb. The location, service, and quality are top notch, and I will definitely be back!!

I would say that the bread was so much thicker than the filling I have seen many of the photos that seemed to have more product in the sandwich. The Le pig had a bland flavor it seemed that it needed more seasoning such as salt and pepper. 
For a 9$ sandwich, they could of put more product into the sandwich. 
The service was good and they were very accommodating. I would like to give them a higher rating but I will definitely give them another shot one day. I hope that they have the Foie the next time I visit!",M3a-hWi-D61plfrSpU5-aA,2,0,3,6vZxy15n8POM2cZFbwzUmw

2759556,2014-03-29,11,zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA,"Ok, so maybe my expectations were a bit high before I ate here. Honestly, I was just not blown away. I thought it was a decent sandwich, but for about 13 bucks, if I can get full just off of taste alone, then I would go to 4 stars at least.

What I got was the Foie on wheat Monte Cristo style. As soon as I paid 12.86 (that's 9 bucks for the sandwich with 15 percent tip, tax, and another 99 cent to make it Monte Cristo), I thought to myself, damn that better be a good sandwich for 13 bucks. So after my first bite, I thought it was decent. I wasn't blown away or anything. It just seemed like just another peanut butter and jelly sandwich which later on I was told is what it kind of tastes like. Although the nice flavor of the crispy chicken skin was good, my stomach was not satisfied. I would of gotten another sandwich but then paying 20 bucks for two sandwiches just to get satisfied is not worth it.

The service was nice. The guy who took my order explained everything to me and answered all my questions. Of course you have to wait for a bit for your order because everything is made to order. I think next time I will text my order so I don't have to wait so long especially if I have time constraints.

As for their location, they are on a the corner of S Las Vegas Blvd and W Wyoming Ave across the street from OG (Olympic Gardens, a 24 hour Strip Club). They are in a small shack type of stand where Viva Las Arepas used to be. 

In closing, maybe the Foie is not for me. Maybe I need to try some of the other sandwiches. Like I said, I don't see the justification in paying 10 bucks for a sandwich that wont fill me up. I will come back for sure and try the Le Pig and/or the Reuben-ish. If I am blown away or at least impressed a bit more than the Foie, then maybe I can bump it up to a 4. I could of easily given these guys 2 stars but I had to convince myself to come back so 3 it is for now.

This is a fun concept, in a historic location, with unique offerings.  It is run by locals with a pedigree [check out http://dtlv.com/2014/01/29/get-ready-to-meet-and-eat-the-goodwich/] and it is definitely a destination worth checking out.
I had the ""deconstructed"" falafel sandwich.  You heard me right:  falafel SANDWICH, not pita pocket.  With a falafel paddy, not falafel balls, and kale slaw on marbled RYE bread.
Definitely not your mother's take on falafel.
The cons:  even though the sandwich was made to order, it was cold when it arrived and the kale slaw was runnier than I otherwise would have liked.
The pros: Locally owned and managed, quality ingredients, intriguing location full of local history and quintessential Las Vegas neighbors such as Olympic Gardens, Dino, Clay Arts Vegas, and the Arepas restaurants that made its reputation in the same kiosk.  And this restaurant team really cares and live in the downtown Las Vegas neighborhood.
Whatever cons I experienced easily could be attributed to the fact that the restaurant is still sorting things out. It has not even opened yet officially.
And given the ingredients and unique offerings, the prices of $3-$9 for the sandwich, is a steal!!
I even talked with Josh about doing a community fundraiser in June, http://www.utwnow.org/host-utw-day-party/  ..  more on that later :)

Reminiscent of In&out styled prep and cook areas that are open and you can really watch the rite-stacking now.  Breakfast will begin in May.  Many favorites have been faithfully brought back on the menu with a few surprising new flavors.

Expect to see the Cuban-esque have lasting fame as well as the Ham'&, but also welcome new tastes such as the Hawkeye which is a giganté crisp pork cutlet served with a tangy specialty ketchup & mustard on a bun rather than the goodwich ol' toast.

After reading a few review of this place, it was easy bookmark. and I planned a visit after work from the northwest side of the valley.  I have to say, it was a very pleasant experience coming to this stand.

My first visit was 10:00 on a Saturday night, and the Goodwich was pretty busy with customers.  I wasn't sure where the line started, but the process was pretty easy because the guy who was taking the orders was on it, and kept track who got there first.   I had an idea what to order because of the raves of others, and ordered some breakfast styled sandwich and the fluff and nut, which both got Monte Cristo styled.   The entire order took only about seven minutes, then I went to work on these bad boys.

The Breakfast sandwich was good, but the fluff and nut was OUT OF THIS WORLD!   It was something about the perfect combination of nutella, marshmallow, homemade graham crackers, and the right thickness of the Monte Cristo toast that made my mouth smile.

The Goodwich brings it back to basics in a perfect way; bread, meat, and smiles. This permanent food cart in the parking lot of one of Vegas' oldest karaoke bars makes some of the best classic lunches in the Valley. 

The menu has about twelve different sandwich options with about seven different add-ons; a fried egg, cheese, jalapeños, chicharones, chip bits, bacon, and crispy chicken skin. All these tasty tidbits can be put on a Reuben, Patty Melt, or even a PBB&J - which is house peanut butter, bacon, pepper jam. Hungry?

My third time here I ordered the Cuban-Esque, which has butt & belly, ham, Swiss cheese, and pickled mustard. I added chicharones to this to get that hard crunch. Talk about a sandwich... this was like a gourmet stoner's wet dream. The pork mixed with the pickled mustard cut the salt flavor just a tad and the marble rye bread was super soft and fresh. The chicharones brought me back to the days of putting potato chips on my schoolyard sammie, very filling and addictive. 

I recommend washing this down with a Classic Coke or Squirt made with Mexican sugar, which this snack stand offers in spades. They don't sell booze, but If you're looking for a beer or cocktail, head over to Dino's which is just 15 feet away. The good people at The Goodwich will deliver your food directly to you while you enjoy the latest version of, ""Don't Stop Believing"" belted out by a local karaoke king.

Goodwich is a humble sandwich stand so successful it has grown effortlessly into its downtown restaurant location beneath the iconic Soho Lofts. I highly recommend this spot for any downtowner looking to grab a quick lunch or a casual dinner before a night out. And for all of you suburbanites looking for a local experience unique to the Arts District's flavor this is your sandwich shop. The food simply can not be beat, the vibe is chill and artistic, and unlike so many pop-up downtown businesses it is remarkably well branded. Thank you, Goodwich, for making this neighborhood proud!

* If you happen to be one of the few to grumble about price or speed please consider the following. These sandwiches are hand crafted from raw ingredients and whole foods. This is not a fast food atrocity with factory style production managed around hunks of overly-processed slabs of meat, all for the purpose of making an hourly quota. You can't beat freshly roasted meats, tenderly sliding off the bone, pilled high on locally baked slices of bread (from Bon Breads) and seasoned with handmade dressings and crisp, fresh herbs. These sandwiches are worth the wait and every penny. You'll be liking your fingers and greedily picking up every crumb.",4faGA59kzNHVfHC4dIvHaQ,1,0,5,eFTQlaMyntvtDrOjYHhwEQ

Reuben... Well done! The perfect amount of all ingredients and a crunchy marble rye is always appreciated. Only problems being the meat was a bit fatty and the bread is just soaaaked with butter/grease. Wipe your hands after every bite type grease. No bueno. 

Falafel.... another good, not great 'wich. I liked the patty style delivery of the falafel and the light cucumber and kale slaw were excellent accompaniments.  Again, this was extremely greasy. 

The grease paired with a 17min wait for a pair of sammies drops the ol' 'wich to 4-stars in my book. Still delicious and still worth a visit though.

I have only gone once in March, but was not impressed beyond the fact that they make their own pickles and it only cost a dollar. I did not feel the need to give it another try because the sandwiches were not outstanding, just kind of forgettable. 

The seating area does not make me feel secure, as there are quite a few questionable characters roaming from corner to corner and looking a little unstable and hungry. I am not willing to fight a methie for dollar pickles. 

Most disturbing was the person taking the order and processing the payment also helped to make our order, sans protection and/or hand washing.

Bonn Bakery bread, Niman ranch meat, greens fresh from Trader Joe's and unless my taste buds fool me the bread is lubed with butter.

Criticisms? House made mayo would be epic, it is such a rare thing to find. Hopefully the restauranteurs read that request!

3496283,2017-12-05,1,zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA,"I like a good meat-based sandwich as much as the next person, but to really ""get"" the Goodwich, there is no better place to start than their vegetarian options. Every time they update their already amazing menu, there is an absurdly creative, veggie heavy masterpiece available, if only you're willing to forgo the meat.

When I first walked into the brick and mortar location, I had the chance to try their beet sandwich - everything delicious about a roasted beet salad placed between two slices of toasty bread. I literally came back within a couple days to get the same thing. When the season changed and the beets were retired, an intriguing option called the Street Corn took its place. The Street Corn was the very best parts of amazing elote (roasted corn, chili-lime mayo, salty cheese), with the wonderful edition of grilled zucchini. I can't count the number of times I came back for that one.

But now the seasons have changed again, and with it, the appearance of the Pulled Squash. I ordered it today, and I literally opened this review after finishing the first half. Who thinks to put spaghetti squash on a sandwich? Who adds braised greens to that squash, then layers in some roasted mushrooms? Who realizes that gruyere is a wonderfully complex, but woefully underrepresented cheese, perfect for grilling? And who, in layering all of this complexity together, thinks to themselves, I think spiced pepitas would really round this out? And who, upon adding that final masterstroke, would be completely correct? 

The Goodwich. And seriously, it's that good.",kkYsGbpZadE9skXgf9m9lw,5,1,5,m06eiBpvExupZbDc5Zapxw

I got the falafel and it was soooo delicious. I really enjoyed the kale slaw on the sammich. Can you say yum? I also got a side of the pickled beets. They were good, but not amazing.
I tried the fluffernutter and that was so delicious, however, I couldn't and wouldn't eat that alone. It's nice to have a few bites after you've finished your sandwich.
They have crazy late hours, til 1 am, so showing up at 10:30 wasn't a problem. They make the sandwich fresh and quick. We had 5 sandwiches and 2 fluffernutter sandwich and it didn't take too long. You can watch them make the sandwiches too.

Last time I had Goodwich, it was still a tiny stall in a parking lot, cranking out some of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Two year later, it's now a full sit down restaurant with a much larger menu, but the same deliciousness and friendly service.

While memories of the original Reuben (still around), Le Pig, and the Foie Gras sandwiches still dancing through my head, the new menu had plenty of great options. One of those choices is the Pig of the Week, the 808 sandwich, paying homage to Hawaii. Mission accomplished!

The 808 is one of the tastiest sandwiches I have ever experienced. It starts with that great thick cut white bread toasted to perfection. Then, once the flavors hits your mouth, you will immediately sense the hint of heat from the shishito peppers and the sweetness from the eel sauce.  As you chew, the richness and tenderness of the pork shines through, along with that fluffy omelette. Oh how I wish Goodwich was in NYC AND NOT las Vegas.

I also had a Tomato Soup with Green Coconut Curry. It was absolutely outstanding. Creamy and zesty, combined with the earthy sweetness from the curry, made this soup an excellent complement to my sandwich. Unfortunately, my stomach could not do more, as they offer many more mouth watering selections. Btw, one of their coolest feature is the ability to add many different accompaniments (example: egg, chicharron, chicken skin, avocado, etc.) to any sandwich. Talk about overkill. Lol.

Las Vegas has grown so much over the years, and the quality of food is no exception. This restaurant is certainly a welcome addition to the ever changing cuisine landscape of this fun city. Until next time, I will have to live with trying to duplicate the 808 in my own kitchen.",zhSfihKkrixuu2i7TsbwwA,0,0,5,Vj6W1GxHp01N90LgylesWg

 Falafel( on wheat)-chickpea purée with cucumber and a kale slaw. The chickpea purée was nice and moist. Unlike some Greek places that deep fry them and dry them out. The kale slaw was creamy and the cucumbers added a crispness to the sandwich. 

 Reuben-ish(rye) - corned beef, Swiss cheese, fennel kraut and 1000 island dressing. Another success! Perfectly grilled and plenty of corned beef. Just the right amount of kraut and dressing to balance everything.

Fluff & Nutt ( white monticristo style) Nutella, toasted marshmallow and crunch. This is definitely food porn material. The bread had a French toast consistency, super moist. Them the innards, the Nutella sells itself. You can't go wrong with Nutella! Marshmallow and crunch, oh hell ya. Is it captain crunch? You'll have to go get one and find out.

They had a booth set up that was serving an awesome turkey and cream cheese sandwich with buffalo sauce.  I found their booth in the lot outside Dinos and was disappointed to find that sandwich wasn't on their regular menu. I went for a late dinner last night and this was my first visit to the new location inside Soho lofts on the ground floor.  Parking on the street was no problem but I can imagine it being at a premium on weekdays.  The open high ceiling and open kitchen give it a welcoming and spacious feel even though there are only 4 or 5 tables inside.  

I ordered the bratty, made with awesome bratwurst made by local Polish food artisan Jerry from Kings Sausage (another local spot you must check out) and it was amazing.  The bread was perfectly toasted, the cheese and meat in the sandwich melted together perfectly to create an awesome texture and flavor.

My friend ordered the Patty, which is a flavorful take on a patty melt.  Pepper jack cheese and ground beef.  I had a bite and it was just as good as my bratty.  She is a big fan of beets.  As a result of course we had to try the pickled beets which were amazing as well.  They had just a bit of tanginess but not as strong as some of the store bought jars of beets.  We also tried the bread and butter pickles which were pretty tasty as well.

Overall I think this place is going to be a fairly regular stop for me.  I would love it even more if they added their special buffalo turkey and cream cheese sandwich to the regular menu, but the rest of the menu is quite good.",gczcslKnGPvJ5xcGUThWVw,0,0,5,SACw9bp7SbteoYLew8n1zg

i wonder if the people who found the location to be scary or less than desirable ever leave their houses. It's not a resort location, but neither is it dangerous. If you feel like you're going to be accosted here, check your meds. We can get you a nice cheese sandwich and the latest issue of Oprah magazine to read poolside at the Wynn. More Goodwich for me. 

     That being said, the Sea Smoke was, simply put, one of the best sandwiches I've ever jammed into my gaping maw. The texture, between the crunch of the texas toasted/grilled  rye and crackle of the crumbled chips and the ever so satisfying yield  of the mildly intoxicating smoked white fish, was THE most perfect balance of texture I've ever experienced in a sandwich. And that's just the freakin' texture! 
      
     I'm, admittedly, a smoked fish freak. If you put your Winston Light out in a can of Chicken Of The Sea, I'd probably pay you to eat the remains. Yeah, I know, gross. But there's your perspective. 

     If I had to fathom a guess, I'd say they were smoking their own here. It was fairly mild, as far as smoked fish goes, but fit in magnificently with the acid of the  ""ES Soss"" and greens and saltiness of the chips. It just went so GD well together. 
      The service was fine. The people who worked there were friendly and accommodating and seemed genuinely interested in our satisfaction with the place. 
   The ambiance was....well, shit.......we ate in the parking lot. But you know that going in, so whatever.   No complaints here. There's a couple chairs around the little sandwich hut, which suited me fine.

It's where Viva Arepas used to be before they moved into a shop down the street.  Your scenery is the OG across the street and the black asphalt of the parking lot, but sitting on the corner of LV Blvd and Wyoming at no thang when you're grubbing on delicious sandwiches.  You might also witness an almost-car accident like we did, which was exciting.

First off, the guy who is running things at this place is super handsome and charming and friendly.  He chatted with my husband and I as we waited for our food and told us the story of how he and his friend came up with this idea and how they make everything in the kitchen behind Dinos.  He is so nice and earnest, that I just want to hug him.

Fortunately, the food speaks for itself and is a testament to their vision.  My husand got the Patty ($7), and it was a delightfully greasy, gooey, slightly spicy treat.  I got the Ham &.... which had mostarda on it to make it slightly sweet along with a cheddar cheese (I think it was cheddar...doesn't matter what it was, it was good).  It was grilled and flavorful.  And it was only $5.  Yup, $5.

We wanted to try the pickles, but they were sold out after a successful and busy Saturday.

The staff here is very friendly and worked great as a team. I do like the open kitchen with a semi-industrial look and the use of space works well for Goodwich. The option of an open patio for al fresco dinning is a plus especially whenever we have nice weather like yesterday.

On to the food, I ordered the Patty with a fried egg. From the first bite of my sandwich to end was satisfying. Each ingredient was well balanced and the ground beef was cook just right with a good amount of spices. The white bread was a perfect consistency without being dried out, too soft or soggy. My sister got the Chive Turkey and was really pleased with her order. She like the consistency and the turkey was not dried out like most places. 

We got a chance to try their Fluff 'N Nut dessert sandwich. This particular item was really good and it was on point in capturing our palate. It was like a classic take on a grownup S'more with an European flair because of the Nutella. I highly recommend everyone to try this dessert out.

For some reason the first time I try something that is good with a unique twist such as their chicken sandwich it was practically mind blowing, but today when I had it, it was good just not amazeballs status. The chicken sandwich consist of chicken, greens, and pesto. For some reason the chicken today was a bit greaser than usual, trust me I am not one to complain about a little extra grease because it does add extra flavor with a side of guilt however today there was a little puddle of grease on the paper that holds the sandwich together. But I must give them credit for the bread they use, I am not really a ran of rye bread but theirs is really good and I love the marble effect on it(refer to my picture). I've also tried Le pig and thought it was a bit fatty for my liking. I had a bite of my friend's ham and that was really good from what I can remember and it's on the $5 menu.

Remember when u were growing up and made random sandwiches with whatever ingredients u had in the fridge and there was like 3 out of 100 of those sandwiches that were just magical but u could never figure out how to replicate that magic no matter how hard u tried... well that's the Patty. Ground beef, smoked cream cheese, onion, & pepperjack (I chose white bread, basically cuz I hate bread but I gotta choose one). The beef is seasoned perfectly, and with the mix of the melted cheeses and onion, every bite is better than the last.

Yes you might be a gigantic pusillanimous yuppie if you find it dangerous here.

If you have a particular problem with eating what might be the best sandwiches from a shack downtown, then I am sure there is a Subway somewhere within driving distance you can go to. There are probably several in Summerlin or Anthem, where you belong. Adios ....

The most expensive sandwich here is $11 and the rest are about $7-8. They do offer combos or separate sides like the pickles. They were super welcoming and asked if we needed anything.

It was a little after noon but there was little wait.  My order was taken and I had a seat in the shade of the front of the stand while waiting.  During that time, it was interesting to see tourists and locals walk by on the Boulevard.  Quite a cross section of humanity going by.

The sandwich came and it was packed nicely in a bag.  It was wrapped in paper and sealed with one of their logo stickers.  The sandwich, the foie, was very good.  It was filled with ingredients.  There's no scrimping here.  The crispy chicken skin and the almond were a nice touch for texture.  I had the sandwich Monte Cristo style and it was nicely grilled.  I also had a diet soda to go with the sandwich.

This is a good place to stop but I'm not a fan of sitting nearly on the sidewalk or in my car.  Hopefully, the guys will be able to get a real shop (if that's their goal).

Foie, Le Pig, and Crispy Chicken Skin???  Honestly, none of this really appeals to me.  Thus, the reason why it took me so long to eat here.  I'm in the area frequently. No, not for OG's, but for AOF.  So, it was just a matter of time that I would finally get a chance at the Goodwich.  

You see the review rating.  So, that means that I'm no different than the previous Yelpers that reviewed this place.  The Goodwich is ""as good as it gets!"" when it comes to their sandwiches.  I got their Reuben-ish on wheat, which consist of corned beef, swiss, kraut, and 1000 Island type dressing.  Not quite sure what made this sandwich one of the best I've had in a while.  Not sure if it was because their bread was perfectly grilled, the corned beef & swiss smashed to a flavorful goodness, or the mix of toppings complimented my sandwich just right.  Regardless of what made my sandwich at the Goodwich a greatwich, they have convinced me that I've been missing out this whole time.  Whatever it was, it was good and I can't wait for another cheat meal here.

The new location is a huge upgrade from being across the street from Olympic Garden which was not only sketchy but just not inviting in the slightest. The new spot is clean, modern, and full of tasty goodness. 

Its hard to get away from the classics like the Patty, the BLTG, and that yummy Ham sandwich. But i recently tried the Falafel and the Tomato which were good but ill be looking for something new the next time around. The Falafel was refreshing and healthy-like but the flavor would get old quick for me if i had too much of it. And the Tomato is a good ""light"" sandwich and to be expected, but am i wrong to desire something a little more in it? When i eat the Patty i feel sad to take the last bite, and that's how i know its a winner with me. Next time ill venture into a Chix-Fix or  Reuben-ish in hopes of finding another heavy weight contender. 

Who doesn't like food stuffed between two pieces of bread?! Goodwich and their combinations and fresh ingredients have always been a winner since the beginning for me. Now in a nice, clean location, an expended menu (breakfast), and even some coffee options you are now gonna get tired of seeing me way too often. 

A few things to note... 
- Im not sure why your address isn't updated on Yelp yet, but you may want to do that for people using the Yelp app and aren't aware of the new location.

Pros: Avoiding the strip! Delicious sandwiches! The price is right! 

Cons: none?

We stopped here on our way out of town and were very happy with the brisk service, fresh ingredients, and  informal vibe. The place is nothing remarkable- a small counter service lunch spot with metal tables. They have their own ice tea and offer some interesting options in the way of alcoholic popsicles and ""rocket coffee"" (with butter a la Nepal?) but the real star of the show is, you guessed it, the sandwiches. 

We had their Reuben-ish and the Mrs. Prosciutto, both very delicious. The Reuben was perfectly portioned with just the right amount of finger licking gooeyness but no more. The Prosciutto (the special) was cold, crispy, with rich fig jam and brie.

One of the co-owners is a former five star chef at one of the strip casinos and this attention to the little details goes into every sandwich.  I was told they are constantly inventing new combinations.  

I would have given five stars, except for the location.  It isn't the best, it's a food shack in Dino's ""The last Las Vegas neighborhood bar"" parking lot.  You can eat your food inside the bar with a couple brews to get out of the Vegas heat.  Sandwiches of this magnitude deserve an actual brick and mortar building!

(UPDATE 5/11/16: The Chix Fix might be the best chicken sandwich ever.)

I've waited months to say these words: the Goodwich is back!

Today was their official opening at the Soho Lofts, and their new place is indeed lofty. Their entrance actually faces Hoover Ave, which explains why I haven't noticed much when driving by on Las Vegas Blvd. Seating is indoor and limited, but still vastly preferable to the inside of your car or an open-air chair at the old shack.

Their old lot outside Dino's was always easy to park in, so parking at their new brick-and-mortar was one of my more immediate concerns. I was fortunate to find street parking (free 3+ hours most spots on the nearest segment of Hoover) at the end of their lunch rush because the next closest option is a $1/hour paid lot. The street was almost empty by the end of my meal though, and Josh is trying to work with the city to allow customers validated parking. Stay tuned.

The new menu (available on their web site) has expanded in breadth and depth. In addition to sandwiches, they offer vegetarian salads (protein additional charge), several sides, and even desserts (although only the blondie and fluff 'n nut sandwich were available today). They've also added fountain drinks (and cups for water, hooray). drip coffee with beans from Henderson favorite Mothership Coffee Roasters, and ""rocket""proof coffee (bulletproof but presumably better). They'll also implement a pretty big breakfast menu and morning hours soon (targeted for early May).

That said, sandwiches have always been my main focus, so I keyed in on two of their new options. The Hawkeye ($8.50) comes on potato bread and includes a not-too-thin slab of crispy pork as well as several condiments. I loved the bread and condiments but found the pork to be a little dry and plain. My second choice was the Cold Brown ($8.00), a temperature-twisted take on a hot brown. While I haven't ever had the latter, I really enjoyed this rendition. It has large chunks of turkey (this ain't no deli sliced meat) and thick smoky bacon but is served cold, making it delicious fresh or as a to-go option. The Cold Brown is definitely a new favorite of mine.

The inevitable price hike was definitely overdue, so I wasn't too surprised that most of their sandwiches now cost at least $1 more. But their mainstays including the Reuben-ish, Patty, and Ham& are back, as are crowd favorites such as the Falafel and BLTG. They also have a rotating ""pig o'the week"" menu slot (Cuban-esque to start). Personally, I'm looking forward to the Sea Smoke, a slightly adjusted version of my favorite from the final menu of the shack. Josh assured me that I'll love it. Oh, and their happy hour menu (daily at 3-6pm) also looks really enticing, especially with the Pate Sliders.

By the way, did I mention that they're a real restaurant now? They've kept their ubiquitous to-go bags and wrapped sandwiches, but they have circular metal trays now for dine-in customers! More importantly, the trays still come with awesome food on top of them.

The Goodwich is definitely back and here to stay. This is the start of bigger and better things for a really awesome shop that's always had excellent sandwiches and now has even more to offer. They're likely to find even more steady clientele in their new, nicer neighborhood, but it's their consistent quality and constant innovation that will keep customers coming back.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,9,5,8ChcpU5OmG9AEdEvF4h1gQ

It is just my business, thank you very much. I love it, and they even have Goodwich menus inside... if you're lucky enough to be able to see them.

LE PIG VERT. Just the right amount of porky goodness, not too greasy, worked perfectly with the chile verde sauce, marbled rye bread, and chicharron. Oh yeah, did I mention chicharron? Come on now.

BLT&G. Thick, crispy bacon. Deliciously supportive wheat bread. Fresh heirloom tomatoes. And what's the G stand for? Oh yeah, freaking cheddar cheese grits. Every ingredient working together in solid harmony. So awesome.

CRUNCH BAR. Holy shiznit. How come this isn't that sweet? It's absolute, delectable perfection. It's a Rice Krispy bar made with some sort of homemade marshmallow cream (because there is NO WAY the flavor comes out that well with store bought crap), topped with melted chocolate, toasted coconut, and bottomed out with a buttery homemade graham cracker crust. WOW. Worth every penny!

And the ultimate to my five-star Goodwich love? THE OUTSIDE GUY. I'm madly in love with him. Yes, of course, he totally fits my typical love of my life profile, but I really do mean it this time. Are you single, guy? I will totally come back to Vegas right now if I stand any chance with you. LOL.

They let me know that it was their first day they were selling their new version-- el Escobar. 

I read the description. Apples, yucca chips, and pork and sat there and wondered whether I was making the right choice. 

Bejeeeeeesus. This sandwich is OFF THE HOOOOOOOOOK. The bread is toasted to perfection, and the apple was not the raw stuff I was envisioning...its poached or cooked or whatever they did to it, it's the soft kind they put in apple pies. I'm not a huge fan of yucca, but all the flavors complemented each other perfectly. 

I needed some serious caffeine and wanted iced coffee, and they offered a cold brew (which is not on the menu). It's a hefty $5, and I was a bit shocked, but, in desperate times I wasn't gonna back out and cheap it.

Thank you to my local friends, Ellen H. and Hugo M., for introducing me to this spot in Las Vegas. As a tourist, you would never think about venturing off anywhere away from the strip for food. Trust me, it's worth it. Even with a Lyft, it was around $6 from the strip to here.

Originally, I heard that the Goodwich was a little shack. By the looks of the current location, they must have done really well. There's a nice open kitchen, plenty of inside and out seating, and one of those cool freestyle coke machines.

Now, for the good stuff. The sandwiches. My ultimate favorite is the Reuben-ish on marbled rye. Packed with corn beef, sauerkraut, and thousand island grilled to perfection. They recently started a seasonal menu as well. No matter what sandwich you choose, it's a win!

For locals, you can get it delivered to your home via grubhub, but nothing beats eating the sandwich ASAP when it comes off the grill.

They no longer offer delivery through their company. If you need a sandwich delivered to you then you now need to go through postmates. I wouldn't recommend it though.

That is what possessed me to drive from Henderson to Downtown with a growling stomach looking for a unique lunch and not settle for everyday boring because my usual lunch date has stomach issues.
I get to this little shack around 12pm with normal looking people standing in line...not a weird downtown crowd at all. I didn't know what everyone meant by ""OG""...until I looked across the street and saw OG Topless Bar (good landmark)...maybe where the bad witch lives lol.
I walked up to order looking at the simple menu (with descriptions of ingredients, yay) knowing I was going to try the much talked about ""Foie"" even though I had a lot of apprehension from never having eaten foie gras in my life. I was bewitched by all the positive descriptions everyone posted about this sandwich that I had to have it...good, bad or otherwise I was going to try foie gras today. The gentleman who took my order was very reassuring that it would be a treat for me and that at $9, it was a great way for me to try it and not break the bank. I found an empty chair to eat that made me feel like I was a young student at school having my favorite sandwich at lunch.
As you can already tell, I LOVED it! Such a strange combination to put together but it all works. Foie gras mousse/terrine that had a creamy texture with light earthy, almost truffle-like hints (not at all gamey), this very crispy thick chicken skin (like when you hit the crispy skin jackpot on a perfectly roasted chicken), chopped almonds, and pickled purple cabbage that made sense as a necessity to cut the richness of the foie gras, all inside a grilled crunchy white bread that scrapes the inside of your mouth a little. Creamy, crunchy, savory...I couldn't believe this taste explosion that I enjoyed with each bite to the last. Oh yes. I finished the whole thing! I was really blown away how
 much I enjoyed this sandwich. It was life changing lol. It would be wonderful to see Goodwich occupy a space in the upcoming Galaxy Market in the Arts District...a space for artisanal foods, craft brews and aspiring restauranteurs.",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,31,26,5,WFYCzgwQHkgiQ_dFKG8X5w

I ordered the Ruban-esque, which in essence sounded like a pretty safe choice. I don't normally order rubans, but I thought I should go outside my comfort zone. I should have noted the word ""FENNEL"" in the description, as the sandwich comes with fennel-kraut -- and *shudder* I cannot stand fennel. It is the devil seed. Fennel aside I still felt as though the sandwich lacked - it was really, really greasy, and the meat was chopped really finely, I would have preferred some chunkier portions.

Wait time is a little on the long-side. I stopped by for lunch, and there were two patrons ahead of me, but I think I waited about 10-12 minutes for the sandwich to arrive. Just be aware of the wait time (and take note you'll be standing outside while waiting.)

Also, pricing is a bit steep. I paid $9 bucks for sandwich and that does not include chips or a drink, if you want those, it will be more.

Le Pig- my favorite sandwich! It has beautiful chunks of tender pork belly, arugula dressed in a truffled vinegarette, and fontina cheese. This sandwich is fan-freaking-tastic!!! The flavors of the rich pork belly cut by the dressed arugula makes a symphony in my mouth. 
 
Foie&- foie gras mousse, crispy chicken skin, caramelized cabbage, and almonds. This sandwich has flavors that I would have never thought would work, but WOW the smooth mousse with the crunchy almond are great together. 

Fluff & Nut- this sandwich put a huge smile on my face as soon as I unwrapped it. Gooey marshmallow oozing out of the monte Cristo style white bread. I am still perplexed as to what the crunch is because it was crunchy till the last bite. I ate my Le Pig first and it was still crunchy!!!! 

On my last visit I had the luck of trying their house err stand?  Made pickles and they were fresh,  sweet,  spicy,  and crisp. I've never had such a clean flavorful pickle before. They make it even better by adding some haricot vert. Jake said they're also trying out beets so look for those in the near future!

I ordered the ground beef AND the nutella-fluff one. The ground beef is chopped fine and flavored as if momma made it (delicious) The dessert-like nutella combo was decadent and reminded me of something I would make after drinking all day. That is a compliment ;) Reserving this one for when the sugar cravings are out of control.

Once I texted my order ahead, they were responsive, order was ready when promised and pick-up was very smooth. A must if you don't want to wait on the corner.",3CqbFYDUBW65TinMvd_ixA,0,0,4,-W-6L8XrKkBe7VPkelpS9w

Part of me feels bad when ordering a sandwich anywhere because I hate paying for food I feel like I could make myself. However, I'm certain that I couldn't make the sandwiches this place offers. These are delicious and creative sandwiches that I will gladly pay for. Yes, it costs more than Jimmy John's or Capriotti's, but that's comparing apples to oranges. Sometimes I want Jimmy John's because it's quick and cheaper. Sometimes I want The Goodwich because it's a gourmet sandwich that I'm willing to pay more for. As an example, the Cold Brown is made with roast turkey, bacon, tomato, gruyere fondue, and parsley. If it has gruyere fondue, then it's safe to say that it's beyond my sandwich making skills.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,2,0,4,-l2Vqx00HkfbWofZc8IFXg

Sandwiches are available on white, wheat, or marbled rye. RYE ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. I love rye so much. I ordered rye on two of the three sandwiches and the other was white bread. Delicious, beautiful white bread.

Fun Guy ($5): Roasted mushroom, sweet garlic fondue, and fried onion. Whoa, this sandwich has got it going on with so few ingredients. I like mushrooms, but I don't love mushrooms; especially when the dish is an ode to mushrooms. This sandwich has a beautiful and subtle mushroom essence with a really flavorful cheese element.

Falafel ($7): Green pea falafel, chickpea puree, cucumber, and kale slaw. This is an amazing vegetarian option with punches of flavor. It was my least favorite of the bunch, but still really solid. The falafel was delicious and I loved the crunch of cucumbers and kale slaw. 

Chicken ($7): Root veg confit, salsa verde, provolone, and crispy skin. I had to save the best for last. I want to marry this sandwich (sorry, Ruben). The flavors are INSANE. All of it. The whole sandwich was pure magic. When I did manage to speak between the muffled bites of pure bliss, all I could say was, ""OHMYGOD!"" BTW, get this sandwich on rye.

In case you don't know the drill, you can text 702-910-8681 to place an order prior to your arrival with 1) Your name, 2) The sandwich, and 3) Bread choice.

The customer service has always been amazing, everything is fresh and local and it was our go-to.  

That is until the hours changed.  I'm really perplexed why you'd go from being open on Sundays and until 11:00pm during the week to closed on Sunday's and now closing at 6:00pm on weekdays.  With being in the Ogden and knowing that people walk over from Juhl, Newport, etc it doesn't make sense.  It closes too early now to go here anymore.

But this little eatery is a reminder that size doesn't matter, it's what's inside (mainly the food they can make), that counts.

I did the ""Patty"" (minus the pepper jack cheese and bell peppers).  Although I'm a huge fan of trying things as they are listed on the menu, I went sans pepper cheese and bell peppers on this order because I was sharing with my wife (who isn't a fan of either those things).  You know what, I can't imagine this sandwich tasting ANY better WITH pepper jack cheese or bell peppers.  The meat was ground up real good and had a nice saltiness to go with that slight sweetness coming off the grilled onions (which were plentiful, and plenty appreciated)!  Add in the ""just enough"" creaminess and slight smokiness that smoked cream cheese gave to the sandwich combined with that grilled bread and I was already wishing I had ordered another ""to go.

I also ordered the ""Grill Cheese"", but did it ""Monte Cristo"" style.  They don't have a deep fryer in that little shack, so their version of the Monte Cristo is dipping the individual slices of bread in an egg wash and then grill them (kinda like a french toast). The result is thicker, fluffier bread.  I think I would have rather had the Grill Cheese on that same butter, crisp, bread that the ""Patty"" came on instead.

This place needs to stick around so I can try the ""Fried Egg"" sandwich (as well as some of the others). Til' next time Goodwich!",bmOuwh_dy0n3GIccYJpZ5g,1,1,4,HR7KSFFh3KdoboI2RP1I4g

It is such a fabulous place to go when you're in the downtown/strip area, have a car, and have no desire for a chain or a sit-down restaurant. We have a strong tendency to come grab a goodwich whenever fate smiles on us, and we get an unexpected afternoon off, or are about to spend the afternoon adventuring and want a late breakfast/early dinner.

I am a rabid, drooling fan of the Reuben-ish. Everything on it, including the kraut and the beef is made in house, and that, that just makes it taste so much better. Mt grandma still speaks German, and we have saurkraut ceramic jugs, and several of those shavey-kraut blade-cubes. So please understand me when I say this kraut is as good as my grandmothers.

The Grilled Cheese just makes a shitty day better, and pretty much any sandwich is an easy picnic in one step. Two sandwiches, two drinks, and a wander around one of the parks in the area is an easy way to win your date night, and for the price, you can't beat it. You could get a shitty sub at smith's....or a goodwich. Is that even a question!?

The owner is quite often working, and he is a phenomenal guy. Very friendly, very real. The sandwiches are well crafted and amazing, but there is nothing about this place that's pretentious or jerky. It's just really good food, really good people, and an easy, walk up style restaurant.

It was basically a fancy version of a grilled cheese, but it did melt in my mouth. It had an aioli sauce that was to die for, and made me want to figure out how I can re-create this delight at home. Ashley was super stoked to find out they had three types of pickled vegetables and was a little more adventurous than me with her choice of pickled watermelon. We were just back from a camping trip, so we couldn't pass up the s'mores dessert. It contains Nutella homemade graham cracker cracker crumb, and housemade marshmallow fluff. They sandwich this between two types of bread to make pure perfection. I could not ask for a better end to a tasty meal. The only reason they did not get five stars is because the area can be a little sketchy; the restroom is down an alley so be careful.",Np3cRSpo9dY2FIO-xSEStw,2,2,4,FC8mkob_qp88_d-5m7vyUQ

4968702,2015-05-06,4,zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA,"Sometime I wonder if some of the dope reviews patrons leave are just a matter of trend and conformity...hip new place opens up, everyone thinks its cool and different and viola! momentum is created for the new foodie item and simple, seemingly trivial components like honest service, politeness and efficiency are thrown out the window.

I mean, c'mon on. I am totally willing to wait in line for a delicious meal, even if it means standing outside on a seedy corner on the Vegas strip. I don't mind the wait times, especially if it means quality food. However, what I do mind is the promise of said food in a time-frame that couldn't be met. Here's the deal:

Friday night our party of 4 stops by the Goodwich after exploring the new Fremont street. I've been curious to stop by this place for months, having gone to the Arepa stand that used to be in its place. I've heard good things about the Fluff&Nutt and Ham sandwich with Arugula so I was excited to try the place out. What was even better was the 5-minute wait time the cashier assured me upon ordering both sandwiches and the offer to bring it to our car, all bagged up when it was ready. No one else was seemingly in line, so the prospect of eating a delicious sandwich in minutes had my mouth watering.

Sadly, it all went downhill from there. Ten minutes pass - no big deal. 5 minutes is no reason to get all worked up. Fifteen minutes pass - getting a little antsy. Twenty-five minutes pass - I walk up to the counter upon which the cashier is trying not to make eye-contact with me. Then, what I believe to be a random patron asks me if I've ordered yet as I'm trying to get the cashier's attention (keep in mind this is a TINY stand) and as I tell him I've already ordered and have been ""waiting for days"" he busts out with...

""We try to think of ourselves as somewhere between Jimmy Johns and In-n-Out, so all our orders are made from scratch...you'll need to be patient""

I told him that I'm ok with waiting for great food, but that I was simply irked by his employee's false promise and subsequent failure to acknowledge it. A big part of my dining experience out is the service - yes, I wasn't at a five-star restaurant but basic timing, let alone common courtesy, is not something that requires a michelin star to understand. What was worse was that he simply went back to his group of friends (employees, random customers? I don't know) standing to the side of the shop to hang out again, seemingly oblivious. No word to the cook, no mention to the cashier. Just a simple brush off as if I had come across the wrong side of the tracks.

Bottom line - by the time we actually received our sandwiches (which I had to come get myself despite his offer to bring it to us), I wasn't in any kind of mood to eat it. The Fluff-Nut was ok...a nice little dessert spin on the quintessential grilled-cheese, but I didn't even bother to try the Ham sandwich because of the bad taste the cashier left in my mouth. My friend said that it was good, but nothing special. 

Kind of how I was made to feel simply trying to buy a sandwich. 2 STARS",TflEE0XyySOPXbSvyznuaA,2,0,2,Fr79k0jufwMilwgBw14UMg

Our first visit we got: 

* Foie & ""foie gras mousse, crispy chicken skin, cabbage, almond"" ($9) - Rich, decadent, messy, and oh so good.  But probably best to share this one because it's a heavy sandwich for one.

* Le Pig ""belly, fontina, rocket, truffle vinagrette, chip bits"" ($9) - This has probably become one of our favorites as we've ordered this again.

* PBB&J ""peanut butter, bacon, rosemary, pepper jelly"" ($5) - I haven't had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in years.  Once you have this version, you won't be able to eat a regular PB&J sandwich again.  And bacon? Hello!

Subsequent visits:

* Span-ish ""chorizo, mortadello, manchego, olive, piquillo"" ($9) - Our picky eater, aka the Little Guy, was all over the mortadello!  As a result, he may never eat good old-fashioned bologna again!

* Chicken ""provolone, bacon, wilted greens, tomato, ginger"" ($7) - The chicken was actually still in the roaster, so they suggested using pork belly in the sandwich instead.  Pork belly, when is it not tasty?

* Grilled Cheese ""bread, american, bread"" ($3) - This was a pretty boring grilled cheese sandwich, it's literally just bread and cheese.  In retrospect, adding some bacon ($2) or foie gras ($4) probably would have taken this little sandwich to a whole new level.

What I love about the Goodwich is that it's fast food, but not.  Sure, it takes a little while to get your sandwiches made but that's okay.  We put our orders in and pay and then the food gets run out to our car.  So, we love that.  And service - I cannot say enough things about how important great customer service is and these guys know this.  They make small talk, they recognize and appreciate return customers, and they are flexible.    

And you can call or TEXT your orders in ahead of time!  How sweet is that?! 

They had a Mushroom Melt on their very first day and haven't had it since.  I've been asking and so far no luck.  But they said that if enough people ask for it, it may show up again.  Help a girl out!  Ask for the Mushroom Melt!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,15,13,5,In4HytxXUcdBzBB-DFR6wQ

The sandwiches are crafted with a unique combination of flavors and textures. They're moderately stuffed and I find them pretty filling. Order yours ""monte crisco"" style if that's your thing. I like crunchy bread so I started skipping out on the egg bath. The new version of the Le Pig was just ok. It sounded great in theory, but I wasn't a fan of the banh mi twist they put on it.

Pork belly was nice and tender with a good balance between meat and fat.  Topped with some tasty greens.  It's definitely a gourmet sandwich at a very reasonable price.  In fact, many of their sandwiches cost what you'd pay for a Subway sandwich only everything is made from scratch, fresh, and delicious.  
It's nice to eat a sandwich made by a real chef.  Highly recommended.
I ate it on the hood of my car but am told you can eat inside Dino's.  They'll even deliver it inside if you're in there having a brew or two or 8.

This place is located right in Dino's Bar's parking lot. Just a little stand with some tables and chairs. Sounds great to me! The staff really care about everything they make and put into the food. They are also super friendly and attentive. They have sandwiches ranging from $3 to $9 and you can also add stuff on if you'd like.

I love how they brought the sandwiches out all wrapped in white paper and a goodwich sticker. Very retro! Love it! Now the food. Wow! All the flavors in the Ruben melted together perfectly. Lots of meat on toasted marble rye. Joel's was oozing with cheese when he pulled it apart. The meat and cheese mmmm they sure know how to pair ingredients. 

Goodwich seriously did not disappoint. I can't wait to go back to try all their other sandwiches. I forgot to mention that you can make any sandwich a monte cristo by just asking.

As someone who waited tables and frequently got angry when fills came in at closing time, I greatly appreciate this.

This review is about the food. The Reubenish sandwich. I was impressed. I've had a ton of Reubens and this one is up there in my list now.

The bread was crisp and buttery, with a soft finish that respected the contents of the sandwich.

The sandwich had a balanced blend of kraut/cabbage, beef, cheese, and slighty spicy Russian/thousand island dressing. The ratio of the ingredients was intelligent, a bit less greasy than a classic Reuben.

The kraut on the sandwich tasted housemade. The cabbage still had a fresh crisp and proudly displayed hints of Caraway without being overpowering. 

The corned beef was seasoned well and had a fall apart bite. They chop up the meat and sear it to acheive great maillard surface area (the chef must follow Serious Eats). The balance of meat to fat was carefully thought out and added a savoury depth to the mouthfeel without overpowering the palate.

The sandwich oozes with a marriage of fully melted cheese and spicy Russian dressing. The flavors are fresh and unique.

Goodwich is definitely worth a short trip off the strip. They are serving intelligent and inventive sandwiches in a comfortable and contemporary environment.",EOajY1L3ole3gLTCZ2xw1g,6,3,5,hy_QBYz3ewYN8yDjPdbG4Q

Reuben sandwich was a basic Reuben sandwich, but adding more flavor to it with some cheese. I don't know how to explain, it was just good.
Patty sandwich is basically a sandwich that the inside is hamburger patty. They put cream cheese inside, which made the sandwich more flavorful. I really liked this sandwich the most.
Street corn sandwich was having very interesting taste. I got a recommendation from their worker, they asked us to put fried chicken add to it. Taste was really funny. I am not saying it was bad, but it really had interesting flavor. I really liked they way they toast the bread. And they had chips that they make their own seasoning, which was really good too.

We were greeted by the menu to take our order. I kinda like that someone comes out to talk to you, it's more personal that way.

The BF and I shared : 

Ham & ( thick cut ham and daily inspiration which at this time was sharp cheddar, mostarda and greens). It was a nice balance of the smoky ham, the sweet mostarda chutney, the cheese, and the herbaceous bite of the eye. For $5 this is great value too. 

Le Pig ( pork belly, fontina, rocket, truffle vinaigrette, chip bits) I like that the pork belly has been crisp up so even the fatty bits can make a lover of someone who normally stays away from it. Again, its a nice flavor balance. Loved the buttery white pan de mie style bread.

We got some chips which is bagged chips by Tims and pickles which are homemade. Kinda reminds me of bread and butter in flavor and was really good mix of pickled cucumbers and green beans. 

You can pick the bread between a white pan de mie, wheat and a marbled rye. We asked them to pick which breads were best with each instead of pick. I really say get the Ham & with rye as it adds a unexpected dimension and brings down the sweetness a little. 

So this spot is so good, we came back after cigars for a snack! We shared a PBB&J on wheat. I was one of those kids who never ate PB&J and never acquired a like for them. This was a game changer for a doubter of peanut butter sandwich magic. The peanutty flavor with the red pepper, the rosemary and the bacon was awesome. I seriously went home and saw the black forest bacon waiting to be eaten in my fridge and wished I had bread and pepper jelly. 

Their moniker is ""stacked rite sandwiches"" and it was indeed stacked just right. The amounts of everything is in the right balance as well as the flavor play in a stack that stays put. Simple things like sandwiches sometimes fail so bad as a ""elevated"" item, but these are successful and smart creations. Makes sense as Jake and Josh have worked haute cuisine which I found out while chatting with Jake. I figured they were experienced as there wasn't anything I could fault. The menu is just right, the prices are competitive, the friendly service and efficient cooking isn't at the level a 2 week old business is normally at.... They are working out having someone prep more as they are running out of things during the day, but them alone couldn't keep up so it's not a fault, but perhaps a show of a success that they run out and always have orders in the queue. 

After this I feel almost hard pressed to not make the ritual be specific to eating ONLY at the Goodwich, smoke only at Cigarbox and get gelato only at Art of Flavors. The perfect day off triangle. Either way, I am absolutely in love.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,11,6,5,WSDtc3EWjAd7lkGJhjpzNg

Unfair compression?  If you're going to charge me $3.00 for something I can make at home for $0.50 or claim to serve foie de pate for only $9.00 you better be able to compete with the big boys.

A great concept, chef inspired twist on the classics but in the end, these are greasy, unhealthy, bizarre sandwiches.

- PBB&J (peanut butter, bacon, pepper jelly and rosemary).  Bizarre but it works.  Peanut butter and bacon, a match made in heaven is complemented by the herbaceous aroma of the rosemary.

- ""Ruben-ish"" (corned beef, Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing, fennel kraut) A paltry amount of somewhat dry, corned beef that initially pairs well with the anise flavor of the kraut.  The kraut quickly becomes overpowering with each bite.

- ""Foie &"" (Foie pate, crispy chicken skin, cabbage, almonds)  Chicken skin is excellent while the sautéed cabbage adds vegetal sweetness and almonds, crunch.  I doubt their claim that they are using pate de foie gras.  French law mandates the pate be made of 80 percent foie.  The mouth feel is off and the mineral flavor leads me to think this is chicken liver pate.

Supermarket quality white, wheat or rye breads.  All becoming dry from toasting.  Making them ""Monte Cristo"" (a dip in egg before being griddled) just makes them more greasy and less appetizing.

Excessive Yelp hype aside, in the end, just an average sandwich.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,27,18,3,01GcJrTNIfzXSWef5gzIQg

Needless to say, I was disappointed after hearing all the hype and pretty irritated I paid $13 for it.",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,1,0,2,DdGPqY0jQuU_LRCgcuzvqA

I was in the area and had to see what 5 stars was about! 

Small menu, which is good. Nothing complicated. I got the Fluff&Nut and my Bf got the grilled cheese. Only 7 bucks for the two sandwiches! 

I talked to the gentleman that was taking the orders until the sandwiches were done. He was so nice and friendly. I think he was the owner? Not to sure, but I told him this business was going so far in the future. It was doing so well and I can't wait to see more sandwiches on the menu and a bigger place for them! 

The food was so good. Who would of thought that chocolate and marshmallow could work that well on a piece of buttered bread? I really want another one. I wish this place was on every corner instead of mcdonalds. It was just so simple, but had the right touch and flavor.

There's no customer seating, but plenty of parking so we sat in the car and dug in to our premium sandwiches.  These are not the sandwiches your mom makes unless she took the time to grill, deep fry, slow roast, and make almost everything from scratch.

We tried the Special of the Day which was a Pork Cutlet Sandwich with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and homemade dressing.  The sandwich had a nice crunch from the breading and was pretty mild in flavor despite having so much going on.

I was pretty excited about the Pate Sandwich because I love Vietnamese Pate Sandwiches.  The pate was course and firm and the ratio was a bit off with too much pate (did I really write that?!) and homemade pickle spread which made the sandwich a bit salty.

The hands down winner was the Reuben-ish.  We all agreed the sandwich had everything you wanted from a Reuben: tender, flavorful corned beef, and the perfect ration of cheese, kraut, and dressing.

The Owner/Order Taker is friendly, helpful and efficient and you can tell there is a passion for the food and the business.  Definitely give this place a try when you're looking for a fresh take on the humble sandwich.",Iu5isy8VNf1d81o7zDSxSQ,2,1,3,MBjSKa0e3XE0wL7m6CPtew

I first found out about The Goodwich from a friend. He tried numerous times to get me to go when they were just a stand on the corner. However, I didn't make it there until they opened in their current location. 
Upon entering you good a very welcoming vibe from everybody in the shop. Everyone that work there is so friendly and checked on my friend and I to see how we were enjoying our meal. I really like most of the decor, it is unique and fits the business
 The first time I came in, I ordered The Patty.. wholly deliciousness. This sandwich was just so good. Cheesy gooey goodness. I could totally see how this is their most popular sandwich. 
The second time I came in I ordered the Rueben-ish. I wasn't a fan of this sandwich. I felt the balance between kraut and meat and sauce was off. I could taste more of the 1000 sauce than I could of the meat and kraut. 
The third time I came in I had the Ham&... wholly deliciousness again.. this sandwich is soo good, perfectly balanced..the mostarda on it just gives it this flavor the is beyond words.. by far my favorite right up there with the Patty. 
The fourth time I came in I had the BLTG. I wasn't a fan of this sandwich much either. This was my first time having grits and I didn't particularly like them, I felt they kinda took away from the overall flavor of the sandwich... but this is a personal thing as my friend loved the sandwich. 
I will be back  as I am slowly working my way through trying each sandwich on the menu. I highly recommend this place to my friends and a lot of them have come to love it as much as I do.",LpZRg0oRGzTQTwQbfh8VSg,1,0,4,25bLmE-sLQL_OqEtEnYnJg

My wife had a falafel sandwich. It was SO very good! However, she had the marble rye. Normally, they toast all of their sandwiches. I would recommend either going with a different bread (they also have white and wheat), or getting untoasted, as the marble rye toasted is a bit hard.
I had the Pollo Cuermo sandwich. Chicken with spinach, cheese, and a bunch of fancy sounding stuffs. It was good, but alas, I had the toasted marble rye also, and it was hard.
They have a mini-Coca-Cola Freestyle machine, which is VERY cool, as well as unsweetened ice tea (free refills on both, of course). While the cups are smaller (12 ounces), they have fat straws. (The mini machine simply has fewer options than the full-fledged, such as no Mello Yello flavors)
We got a bag of their homemade chips. They have Vinegar-Curry, Sea Salt and Pepper, Dill PIckle, and Jalapeno-Sour Cream flavors. We got the jalapeno-sour cream. The texture was decent enough. For kettle chips, they weren't too hard, which is good. The flavor was very, very bland. Not quite just potato, but not much else. Certainly not spicy at all. I ate them all, but I think it was more about the crunch than the flavor.
We also had the strawberry pie. It was layered with cut up strawberries, with perhaps a little strawberry preserves holding it together (not really preserves, but homemade goo, sort of like thick strawberry shortcake goo). The pie crust was like a moist Pop Tart, but more flaky: well done. It was topped with homemade whipped cream, which was bland. Overall, the pie was good, but not very sweet, and not runny, which I prefer.
The restrooms are located next door in the lobby of the apartment building. You need a code to get in, and they were very clean, albeit slightly inconvenient. Just slightly. 
Pricewise, with two sandwiches, two drinks, a bag of chips and slice of pie, it was $32. Not horrible, but not cheap.

Truly a story of building a brand out of nothing, Joshua Clark's stint serving ""Stacked-Rite"" Sandwiches out of a shack in front of Dino's Lounge now yielding a full-scale Restaurant inside the Soho Lofts with a second location coming soon at Buffalo and Warm Springs, it was precisely on time that Ms Hegge stepped out of the elevator with everything still warm despite a twenty-five minute drive, the finishing touches added in the staff kitchen where breadcrumbs were placed atop tender elbow Noodles. 

Adding quality plates, napkins, utensils and serviceware as part of the per-head cost, all signs of a Business who knows how to impress, it was with a modest tab which even impressed the sponsor that a diverse staff eyed items carefully before digging in, the Kale one inquired ""that's what they make Green Smoothies out of, right?"" popular amongst several thanks to its light and refreshing flavor even before adding Dressing provided on the side. 

Capable of being either healthy or gluttonous, Mondays adding to The Goodwich's allure with Chef's Choice Macaroni & Cheese which this week fortunately came gooey with Pimento-Cream Cheese plus Cheddar, it was with Crumbs settling in crisp juxtaposition that all but those with a low spice tolerance were impressed, the fact that nearly two whole trays went home as someone's family dinner entirely a result of more-than-generous portioning.

Moving next to three signature Sandwiches, self-selected on two styles of toasted Bread and quartered at the Restaurant's discretion, fans of Chef Clark's Patty Melt will be thrilled to know the house-ground Beef  travels well without becoming soggy despite melted Cheese and Sauteeed Onions, the same praise equally applicable to herbaceous Falafel that eats light, crisp and healthy as well as the Kentucky-inspired ""Cold  Brown"" that is available with  or without Bacon, though anyone omitting that crispy goodness is either of a religion where Pork is forbidden or simply foolish.

Rounding out the meal with two-dozen Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies, arguably the best in town and delivered still slightly warm with a soft center, suffice it to say that anyone looking for a great spread without breaking the bank should definitely consider The Goodwich for catering, their addition to a growing monthly rotation guaranteed to be even more prominent when a location less than one mile away opens.

While it might take a little more effort and planning to cater from The Goodwich rather than Earl of Sandwich, Firehouse Subs or Panera the combination of ingredient quality, commitment and local ownership makes every extra second spent worthwhile and everyone from the well-traveled gourmand to those happy with Subway will be able to appreciate the difference",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,8,5,1U_0-nvDvwRYlhBOFOzluA

These sandwiches were like having a chef making you his afternoon snack. If you ever go into a professional kitchen the cooks make food for themselves and sometimes it's better than the food on the menu. This reminded me of sharing a great meal with the guys in the back.

I had it all planned the day before, however, I finished the climb waaaay sooner than I anticipated. I was texting my order to Jake (one of the owners of The Goodwich) while I was waiting inside Dino's Lounge. He even delivered it to me inside Dino's. Talk about service deluxe!

You can get your Sammie in white, wheat or rye. Get it done Monte Cristo-style for 50 cents. Add-ons start at 50 cents to $4: Chip bits, fried egg, bacon, crispy chicken skin and foie gras. For sides, they have: chips, pickles, pickled chips and pickled beets (not always on the menu so, ask). Drinks: water, soda, house infusions and shandy. If you're like me and want to skip lines, text your order in to 702-910-8681 and specify if you're picking up curbside or Dino's Lounge. Give them about 20 minutes to get your food ready depending on how much food you order and how busy they are. 

I was extremely hungry so I got 4 sammies: Le Pig, Foie, Span-ish and Fluff & Nut...all in wheat bread.

Le Pig:
Pork belly, rocket, fontina, truffle vinaigrette and chip bits. The pork belly chunks are fatty and the chip bits add saltiness and crunch to this sandwich. Lots of incredible flavors. My favorite out of all I've tried. 5/5

Foie:
Foie gras mousse, cabbage, crisp chicken skin and almond. Creamy and rich foie gras with a bit of texture from the cabbage and almonds. The chicken skin is crisp with a thin layer of meat. A close 2nd favorite of mine. 5/5

Span-ish:
Mortadella, manchego, chorizo, olive and piquillo. The olive and piquillo combination reminds me of giardiniera. Altogether, this sandwich resembles a muffuletta but with better ingredients and less layers. It's salty, tangy and delicious! 4/5

Fluff and Nut:
Nutella, marshmallow fluff and crunch. The marshmallow is ooey gooey. The creamy chocolate hazelnut perfection that is Nutella with a sweet-salty toffee crunch. It's sweeet. 4/5

Their hours are limited since Jake and Josh have day jobs. They're hipsters for sure. A great addition to this area. Their sandwiches are extremely amazing and it would take me a long time to get over it.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,7,8,5,K2IEG5K1IkrLweti0A6enQ

The take something seemingly so basic (sandwich bread and add a touch of class with making the interior components of a higher calibre sandwich. They're out of the league of Subway and Capriotti's. They're borderline gourmet.

I've had the Cuban, the sinfully sweet Flutter Nutrer, the Porkie, the Reuben. It's all so tasty and have complex flavor profiles. The house made pickles also the dankness. Spicy and sweet. Definitely a must try if you're a pickle fan like me.

Also stepping up their legit game-ness, they sell upgraded colas. I'm such a sucker for speciality sodas. A few flavors of Izze and a few other brands are offered. Again, kicking it up a notch.

Pate: Bomb.com...not for everyone as patte can be strange to some (mystery meat but usually cow, duck, geese, or chicken parts with fat and herbs & spices)...has a lot of flavor and is very refreshing...very herby with some tang...

PBB&J: Stands for peanut butter, bacon & jelly sandwich....surprisingly it works f'n well...similar to how that peanut butter crunch burger at 1842 is...

Fried Egg: Probably the most basic sounding sandwhich on the menu however you have to try the simple sounding food in order to gauge the quality of  work...this reminds me of some ish my mom would make and mom's are usually your favorite cooks as your growing up...it was done well..wish the egg was dobe over easy as the yolk gushing out would have been crack..

We got a little lost looking for the place but you just have to look carefully for the sign. Try to get street parking if you can! We were greeted immediately when we walked in. To the left you'll see an open kitchen and to the right are tables. I stared at the menu for the little while, looking a little lost, so the cashier gave me a brief summary about each sandwich which was pretty helpful.

We decided to go with The Patty and Sea Smoked.
The sandwiches were a bit too oily for me which sort of gave me a stomach afterwards. The flavors were good but I had expected a little more. The Patty was quite heavy and made us full really quick - I wish there was more color added to it, like some sort of veggies.


Also, their drinks are right behind the register! I hope I'm not the only one who was confused about where the drinks were. The employees were very friendly and checked up on us to see how everything was.

The Goodwich is located just outside of Dino's Lounge, and the food there is just another example of ""Sandwich Joy"", a rare place to visit, but the reception is wonderful.

The Missus and I went there for an afternoon outing, and while I can't remember what she got, the pate sandwich that I discovered was so rich and flavorful....  It was beyond good.

Best of all, Dino's allows people to sit at their bar and eat, so I brought in my food, ordered a beer, and just spent a blissful moment munching contentedly at this latest of finds.  Again, for what you get, the value is excellent.

I've become convinced that Vegas might be one of the ""Great Sandwich Capitals of America"".  There are enough excellent sandwich places here to placate all of my ""various foodstuffs between two pieces of bread"" needs.

Then, everyone followed:  the lounge, the arepas place, the gelato place, and now this sandwich stand right on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd. and Wyoming.  The Goodwich just opened so it's brand-spanking new, but word travels fast in our little town about everything and everyone, so I wanted to try this place out after hearing, yes, good things about it.  The menu is simple, with sandwiches that start from $3 (grilled cheese, fried egg) and go up to $9 (foie gras, pork belly).  Your bread choices are white, wheat, or rye, there are add-ons available for an extra charge (bacon, cheese, fried egg, foie gras, CRISPY CHICKEN SKIN) and you can ""Monte Cristo"" your sandwich for only $.50; that is, the sandwich is dipped in egg batter and then placed on the grill. 
Still kind of full from a late breakfast, I kept things simple with the grilled cheese on rye done Monte Cristo style since I've never had a sandwich prepared that way. With a bottle of water, my order came to a cheap $4.86.   Jake, the personable co-owner who looks just like Clark Kent, took our orders while his business partner manned the kitchen inside the stand.  I was there with a group of Yelp friends and as we waited for our orders on the corner in the sun, I noticed that there is quite a lot of foot traffic in that area.  There are several seats and business was brisk for a new place.  Our orders came out shortly and everyone loved their Goodwiches.

First, the location is something to be desired. I decided to wait for my meal in my car so I wouldn't be accosted while waiting. Seriously.

Second, ordering was a mess. I wanted something on the side and it was like pulling teeth for them to place it, a sauce, on the side. In the end, they forgot to even give it to me so I could try it!

Third: the sandwiches are bland. I could make a better grilled cheese with craft singles. The chicken sandwich had more flavor, but again, I didn't get to try the sauce because after asking for it on the side, I never even received it. The beef was better, but was the equivalent of a Philly cheese steak from Burger King, and was swimming in grease. I had to use four napkins to soak it all up...

Will has been the man since my first trip to the kiosk in Dino's parking lot. Not only does he break off knowledge about everything in the menu, he is a true foodie that will give you great suggestions for any culinary delights you seek in town. 

Since moving to the brick and mortar, I've seen the owners more often. These guys are world class entrepreneurs that find time to visit with the guests and are open to feedback. 

Food review portion, pretty sure I've eaten everything but here's an overview:

- Patty - my go to sandwich. I throw chopped bacon and mustard on it and get a side of dill pickles for a perfect meal. 
- Reubenish - any Reuben lover out there will appreciate this thing. 
- PBB&JJ - so cheap yet so fulfilling. They mix up the flavor of jam all the time. Get this on white.

This might just be the best sandwich I've ever had. The combo of the pork butt and belly with the ham, swiss and maystard is a must try.

We ordered the grilled cheese,  egg salad,  Patty,  Reuben'ish and the Cold Brown.  We also had to tried the sides : b&b pickles,  jalapeño chips and the beets. 
Everything was killer,  like crazy good.",6Guqa5dye4_IIjpQxvYvdg,1,0,5,nqEk5a0pLHr8MdTqlpUGvg

5862832,2016-07-04,2,zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA,"I have a soft spot for sandies.  I've been to most of the well known spots in LAS (Capriotti's, Earl's, etc), but this may be the best one so far.  What distinguishes Goodwich from other places is that they're so creative.  Grits in a BLT?  A cold hot brown?  I lurv how they're thinking!

I really, really should've just ordered one sandie to share with my husband.  We JUST had dinner.  But he doesn't eat pork (He makes up in our marriage in other ways;), and I really wanted to try the BLTG.  So I got that one, and my love got the sea smoke.

BLTG:  Never would I think to add grits to a sandie.  But make it bacon grits, and you've got the best worst-for-you sandie sauce ever.  I think that there might even be mayo...are they crazy?  The final composition was a little saucy for a sandie, but still very good.  7.5/10

Sea Smoked- Someone should tell me if this is anything like the whitefish salad in Jewish delis.  Never had it, but this is what I imagine it to taste, but smokey.  My hubs said that it was the best he's had.  The guy behind the counter rec'd it on rye.  Turns out that was very good advice.  8/10

I need to come back and try other menu items like the cold brown (highly rec'd by an employee).  Plus, the ppl here are very down to earth.  Thanks Yelpers for helping me find Goodwich!",vH8UjE__eQzUUdDRu0fUMw,1,0,4,b0SyPOcP_73y1eJnvIrsgQ
5876177,2018-03-05,7,zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA,"Every bite really is better than the last.

This food truck born, turned brick and mortar sandwich spot is one of my favorites. A few staples with a seasonal rotation of fresh bites, they make sandwiches that I won't say no to. The service is always top-notch. My recent visit even had me being served by one of the partners for this business. I love that. 

The storefront is tucked away off the hustle and bustle of downtown, but people find their way. I always manage to beat the crowds when I come, (lucky me) but I know my luck won't last. They always draw a crowd. 

The Reuben-ish is my tried and true favorite. I love the Egg-salad and most recently the RU Chicken. I'm blown away by how they squeeze so much flavor between two slices of bread. 

Their sides are a bit pricey, especially for the size, so that's the only thing I won't stand behind. That's okay though, I came for the sandwiches.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,30,20,4,w-4mWF61X7dHI2iIuMYChQ

And The ""Street Corn"" with Avo & Chicken added
With 2 small izze drinks adding up to $28 !
The chicken didn't impress me either, for that price I'd expect a slice of roasted chicken or at least shredded and seasoned.
I suppose it wasn't a bad spot to visit and try. It really wasn't bad, just decent food but not worth what I paid.",Wdm3hCNmJwD689wD6-Bb0w,1,0,3,hztDW2OIVxzzLBv7oIpHjg

5959678,2014-03-15,3,zpoZ6WyQUYff18-z4ZU1mA,"It is rare that I end up checking out a place twice before writing my first review. Well, after my first visit to The Goodwich I just couldn't resist coming back for more just two days later.

I came for lunch with some of my favorite Yelpers, one of whom is already a regular here. I shared a le pig and a foie sandwich the first time around. The sandwiches came out quickly and we settled down to eat. It was a windy afternoon and our food blew all over the place. Lesson learned for next time, if it's windy we will be taking our grub into Dino's or to go to save us the stress. There was one foie casualty during our meal, but The Goodwich guys were on top of it and a replacement sandwich was ready in no time.  The food was amazing. I'm usually 50/50 on foie gras. Sometimes I enjoy and sometimes I don't. Both sandwiches were great. The foie had a nice sweetness and crunch that definitely improved the taste and texture, taking the sandwich to a whole new level. The le pig was delicious as well. Perfectly cooked and really tasty. It was a close tie, so it's too hard for me to pick a favorite. 

Two days later, I came by with my mom to share the fluff and nutt Monte cristo style. I had heard so many good things I just couldn't resist. I actually don't normally enjoy marshmallow or Nutella but it was a nice combination with the added crunchies, making the texture very nice. There was a long line but it went quickly.

The guys who run this place are just great. They make everyone feel very welcome and are so hospitable and accommodating, it's hard not to root for them. Luckily they make a pretty darn good product on top of that so I will be back again really soon. 

Make sure to text or call to make sure they are there before you go. Even better, text your order in like we did so it's ready when you get there.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,10,7,5,N-HNLBPKQavO75Nmq3aIWg

+1 for a fantastic name that gave me a chuckle
+1 for presentation. My sandwich was wrapped so neatly and obviously with care. I imagine if they put this much effort into how a sandwich is wrapped, they must also have good customer service
+1 for a delicious sandwich that reheated fantastically in the toaster oven
+1 for benefit of the doubt.
