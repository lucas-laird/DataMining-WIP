This is my first visit to ANY Johnny Rockets. I was terribly hungry and not picky.

When you are hungry and waiting for your meal, the LAST thing you want to see is the crew out in the table area dancing to Chubby Checker.

The burger was passable, but for the price, I expected better. The Chili fries were delicious and made for good gas later that night.",0Wmo60nr13iuMYYJy77pKA,0,0,2,f_JBpBuzQLYQv7kcPkjEgQ

I understand that it was Christmas Day and the food court was busy, but this service was inexcusable! I got in a line just to order 2 shakes. Then, I proceeded to patiently wait with my family while I watched many others get their orders. However, I did notice that many other customers were also complaining about being mischarged and getting wrong orders. I observed that one of the workers had ""started"" my order by filling up a couple plastic cups with ice cream... but then left them open on the counter unfinished for the next 30 minutes!!!

After 30 long minutes (and several other customers who had ordered full meals after me had received their orders), the workers finally decided to finish my shakes with the same old ice cream that had been sitting out! Even then, I had to wait for someone who ordered 2 minutes ago to get their order before they gave me my shakes.

I would definitely say that the burger is very tasty and the fries aren't too bad although they are a little thicker than I prefer.

4655438,2017-03-30,9,7xEgy2btCKLdTe1vD14ABw,"This Johnny Rockets is all about location! location! location! and not about price! price! price! It is a concession in the Grand Canal Shops up on the second level of the Venetian. 

 Last week during a staycation on the Las Vegas Strip, we were up for a light meal. We were hanging out in the Venetian when we decided on Johnny Rockets. It won over its food court  neighbors including Chicken Connection, Panda Express, and Subway. 

 On account of the fact that this is a food court concession and not a restaurant, we ordered food at a counter that we would carry to a table. We could of sat at one of the few stool seats at the counter. At 8 o' clock on a Sunday evening, Johnny Rockets was moderately busy. Looking at the high prices on the overhead menu, it is easy to understand why. The Rocket burger with fries was $10.90. Of course, I wanted a beverage with the food. The large Pepsi that I ordered for the beverage was an additional $3.98. After paying for the food, the woman at the register presented us with a buzzer that would alert us when the food was ready. 

  The Rocket failed to blast off my taste buds. It was an ordinary burger with cheddar cheese, onions, tomatoes, and a so called special sauce. I would not go out of my way for this burger. Ditto for the fries. However, I would of gone out of my way for the Johnny Rockets egg salad sandwich if they never discontinued it. 

  Missing from this food court Johnny Rockets is the ""Happy Days"" TV show atmosphere that is prevalent in many of their restaurants. Regardless that there was a juke box at the counter the noise and activity inside the food court drowned out the soundtrack of the 50's and 60's. 

  From my experience this Johnny Rockets blasts off prices instead of taste buds into outer space. I would rather spend a few more dollars for a far better meal nearby at Ghiordano, Grimaldi's, Grand Lux Cafe, or In N Out.

5115356,2015-12-10,0,7xEgy2btCKLdTe1vD14ABw,I've had Johnny Rockets shakes before and they're great but the service and food at this particular location was not worth what I paid. The last time I went there I waited nine minutes at the front of the line before leaving for another restaurant. Today when I went there it took them a couple minutes for a manager to take my order. She didn't even smile or greet me. Then it takes over 6 minutes for my chicken fingers to arrive. They weren't even all that good. I work in the Grand Canal Shoppes and the standard of service is greater than what I received from this restaurant. I only went there today because Chipotle was having card issues. I'd rather take my chances with E. Coli than go back to Johnny Rockets.,4ylNCQOUH8ZHMBodd_clgg,0,0,2,V1vLYZODlFtWkCXUQNGsWA
5420597,2010-01-11,2,7xEgy2btCKLdTe1vD14ABw,"This Johnny Rockets restaurant is located in the Venetian Hotel and Casino's Food Court and Mall area.

I have always been a fan of the Johnny Rockets themed restaurants. Although this restaurant is different in one way only, you can only order TO GO or sit at the counter and get served by the pleasant wait staff. One thing that should be noted that if you sit up at the counter, you will always visible by any and all the wait staff....kinda' nice!

I would imagine if this restaurant were to get busy, you may get frustrated with how long the wait can get.  But I think you can rest assured that the quality of the food is the same as with the other Johnny Rockets restaurants.

During my visit to this restaurant, there were many seats available to sit at....the wait staff was quick to say hello and take our drink orders.  I ordered the Patty Melt with Onion Rings and Iced Tea...my food was up to par with other Johnny Rockets restaurants.  The food and service was excellent!

My bill came out to almost $16 with tip, which I believe is slightly higher than normal. This Johnny Rockets restaurant's higher pricing is probably due to the location at the Venetian.  But it is nice to know that the quality is the same from each of their different locations.

The chicken fingers were really really good. And my BLT was totally loaded with bacon. 

Our server was attentive yet kept his distance.",OznrIguWJMFfpQNlaNwYjg,1,1,4,yWPzk1FbvK5gfb0Akvvxjw

The omelet  was good, fresh made and a big portion size.  Will definitely stop back here if I'm staying at the Venetian and need a quick breakfast without all the wait.",hNZaMOSF0QeKn3mKoiS1LQ,0,0,4,fCCcnIVh6lPZOEy7N_KkVA

The shake... meh.

I got a straw to drink my shake.  Bad idea.  I went back for a spoon.  Bad idea.  There comes the dilemna... spoon or straw?

The shake itself was pretty much one note.  Butterfinger, butterfinger, butterfinger.  I got pretty sick of it after a whie.  Too much sucking for me.  I don't do the sucking in Vegas man, I just don't.",Jndb3IoOrN-xj1QFxvKAcA,1,2,2,fzPIvjAyYW5UKwS5eX3DOg

Service was horrible and the attitude of the staff was insane based on their response to a very unhappy customer while we ordered. I hope they didn't give me that persons contaminated burger.,oCBs6r0VWedXGQlvObXVFw,0,0,1,16pEiuQdjNzCQ4s9ERJ_Og
