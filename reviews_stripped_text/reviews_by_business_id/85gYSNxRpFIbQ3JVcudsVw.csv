Pizza is piping hot, not to mention fun desserts! Even when they are SLAMMED which is MOST of the time, they never make excuses, they just put on a smile and get the pizzas out the door! I never thought our neighborhood Pizza Hut would be our ""go to"" place for dinner, but as FAST AS THEY ARE! They deliver, before my order is complete!! Thanks Pizza Hut and all the crew working this location. It's a shitty spot but ALL OF YOU MAKE IT WORK! And for that, I just want to say thanks :) we got a pot of gold in the ghetto",Ot6rnsVs_ZlImYta_E3hfQ,0,0,5,zCH4Cjvt7CPQMR1QOh0msQ

Our thin crust pizza was horribly under cooked and was stuck to the bottom of the box. I don't give them my business anymore.",CT4sqbDLeu9CCZIgEXen-g,1,0,1,PueDVVwzADFT5CdOqZV-Aw
979804,2015-05-10,0,85gYSNxRpFIbQ3JVcudsVw,Well if I would have reviewed this restaurant about two months ago it would have been a 2.  I have somebody in my house that has issues with tomato sauce and so when we order our pizzas one always has to be without sauce.  In the past management didn't care because they usually got it wrong.  Luckily Pizza Hut now has a pizza dippers which has no sauce.  We ordered it the first day it was out and the cooks weren't use to it so made it with sauce.  Luckily we did a chicken alfredo with it and my son was able to eat that instead of the pizza.  I called the manager and he understood and gave us a credit for the pizza and we were able to order it again a few days later.  This time it was made right.  The manager seemed really apologetic and that he cared.  Not the way it used to be.  So you might want to give this location another chance.,33Jz09jA9L3ycpMG4mVsdw,1,0,4,rm-NbU35dupZLW97aF2qkQ
1255125,2018-03-12,0,85gYSNxRpFIbQ3JVcudsVw,There is nothing more infuriating than ordering pizza with crushed tomato sauce and getting NO sauce at all!!!

He was talking to himself loud put all his stuff on the table.  I'm pretty sure manager saw him sitting there but she didn't say anything.  I was very disappointed about her action & definitely will not go for dine in there anymore.   But she changed channel to football game on tv so I'll give 5 star for that.

I was honestly very nice and very patient the entire time. I have no clue why this was done to me. they couldn't have known I was black so I don't believe it was racially motivated. and I know this review won't do much, if anything, at all. but i thought I'd at least let others know of the crap going on over there.

2434922,2016-04-15,0,85gYSNxRpFIbQ3JVcudsVw,"My boyfriend and I used to order from this location at least once a week until today's experience. We definitely will not be coming back here again. 
The pizza we ordered was completely undercooked, so undercooked that the staff asked if we ordered stuffed crust. Instead of the manager asking to remake it, she was trying to justify the fact that it was soggy by saying it was because of the extra sauce. After the manager left to the back for who knows what, we specifically told the cashier that we did not want another pizza just wanted our money back. Apparently there was no communication there because the manager remade our pizza and said the cashier did not mention we wanted our money back. In the 30 minutes that we were there they managed to mess up 3 more orders. The whole situation was handled very unprofessionally and the manager refused to give us her name. She actually ended up giving us our money back and walked away with a free pizza but only after my boyfriend mentioned he was going to contact the owner.

2596841,2017-04-11,0,85gYSNxRpFIbQ3JVcudsVw,"So I ordered yesterday a large pepperoni pan pizza. Simple yes? The delivery girl was nice even though the pizza was a little late than they said, but pizza places get busy and that's fine. It happens. Whatever. When I opened the box it looked like it was a tad overdone and they barely put any cheese on it! There were spots where cheese was missing! I'm not paying to get extra cheese as a topping for them to get it right. It's ridiculous! It's a crime to leave bald tomato sauce patches on a pizza unless it's Neapolitan style pizza from a fancy pizza restaurant. 
I had to eat so I ate it anyway and it was all right, but I felt a little sick afterwards, but this was probably due to pepperoni pizza has a lot of grease that didn't agree with my stomach. This is normal for me, but I love pizza. Will not order from here again, but maybe give it time and try way later down the road. Maybe.",VRKTRO7FTzG9op6fT3e3mw,0,1,2,qqSMJG3qo9acKjhuIoMBsw

4451430,2013-03-03,0,85gYSNxRpFIbQ3JVcudsVw,"In the midst of the ghetto and streetwalkers on Boulder Highway there is a Pizza Hut. My husband wanted to go. He wanted pizza. OK.

Strangely enough the inside of the establishment looks new and polished, not run down. The front counter is clean and organized. The staff was friendly.

What I didn't like - although you can eat in this is primarily a pick-up/delivery place. The dining  area is small AND there is no pizza buffet! *gasp* That is what I always think of when I think of actually going to Pizza Hut to eat - the buffet! No buffet here.

The tables had no red pepper flakes or Parmesan cheese to sprinkle on the pizzas. Not even one of them. When I looked around to see if it was just the table we sat at I was baffled to see not one of the tables had condiments on them. Strange.

Anyway, it's an okay place to get a pizza, especially considering the location. As for food - sure, it's Pizza Hut pizza, it's hard to mess up. It's the same consistency, etc. It came out piping hot, so that was good, but we were one of three tables in the whole place. Kind of hard to mess up.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,0,3,s9GOulf9h-Pg8KxNeXbMmw

5513338,2013-04-07,2,85gYSNxRpFIbQ3JVcudsVw,"Once a week, I get to pound the carbs and I was totally jonsing for some Pizza Sliders.  I have been thinking about them for the last couple of weeks.  They look so good on the commercials.  But, I snoozed on getting them... so, now, they don't have them anymore.  But, because my buddies didn't want to drive all over ""creation"", we decided to pick up a couple of pizzas while we were here.  So, here is my review from tonight.

This Pizza Hut is on the corner of Flamingo and Boulder Hwy.  It's not in the best part of town but, all that really means is - you have to lock your car doors while you are inside.  

We walk in and that is when I heard the bad news...  ""Sorry, we stopped carrying pizza sliders a couple of weeks ago"".  After throwing a fit... just kidding... after accepting the news, We decided to order a medium thin crust  pizza with mushrooms and olives and a large thin crust with 1/2 sausage and 1/2 pepperoni..  

After we ordered we had a bit of a wait... that's what we get for not calling ahead.  We sat there and talked a while.  As we were waiting, I looked around and noticed that this place was extremely clean.  I, having a small bladder, had to use the bathroom and it too was really clean.  The only problem is you have to get the key from the counter.

I also like that they have a board up front where you can see how long you have before your order is ready.  That is a nice touch.  

So, as far as Pizza Huts go, this one gets 4 stars.  I prefer other pizza joints for better food but this place gives great service with a smile.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,1,0,4,QrCZFxB1YGCVyulItMUUfw

The first couple of times we had been to this location the pizza it was not bad that was a few years back.

This last time we went it was not the best. We ordered pizza to eat inside. 
The taste was not that good plus it seems as if they just don't put enough toppings on. Extra cheese was the same amount as if you had regular on it. The pizza don't seem to be done enough either. We like the crust to be a little crispier not too doughy. Maybe there was a new cook or something. 

The pictures that are posted with a ton of toppings is not realistic for here.

The people that work here of course different every time we have been but are always pleasant..
We gave it a few chances and I think the last time did us in. The pizza just wasn't that good.",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,4,3,2,m2rQZm1FmqRxblVQZDNXRQ

She should not be an employee of Pizza Hut she should give her position to a person that really wants the job because she is the worst employee I have ever seen at a Pizza Hut location.
