176952,2016-04-02,0,yGXKMV1omio1I_3qNLdtAA,I go here at least twice a week.  Great high quality food for a fast food place.  I have had awesome service every time I go.  The drive thru person always repeats my order and it is always correct when I get it.  The roller skate person has always been very friendly.  Drive thru does get busy but this is a busy location.  Really enjoy coming here.,95Jictl68Iq3WgifrR5HEQ,2,0,5,SXq7DaOm2KOGdO43bBd0RQ

1023031,2008-06-12,5,yGXKMV1omio1I_3qNLdtAA,"I had never been to a Sonic before. I have seen the commercials on TV and have always wanted to try them. Finally got my chance when we were driving back to the airport, our last stop before leaving Las Vegas. 

We ordered our meal through the little speaker. The kid on roller skates!! came out with our food. Roller skates!!

I ordered a cheeseburger without the burger. However it came without the cheese as well. The vanilla shake I ordered was the highlight. My husband had one of their coffee shakes, I think that was better than mine. Definitely will order that one next time! 

Ugh, but man! It was SO hot, we couldn't eat our food in the car. And sitting outside wasn't any better either!",_US19nu-bny9Vx38IHSXug,4,5,4,ddhJrYusf1xB5YK8Wt-mGg
1343388,2018-06-30,0,yGXKMV1omio1I_3qNLdtAA,"The past 2 nights I've went to this location and I've never been so disappointed. Let me start off by saying their drive thru is incredibly SLOW. I was there for 20+ minutes each night. They focus on other items instead of going in the order they came in. While sitting and waiting I see they have CHEMICALS sitting on a table they serve food on! 1. A sanitizer bucket 2. A spray bottle filled with some sort of yellow substance. I've contacted their Twitter page, & corporate but they don't seem to have a care in the world. Be careful when you eat there, you might have extra flavor in your food!",1NSjxLr0gCWYqKcKC5U8-w,0,0,1,B8iEzWE77nxqAfOsGPnm2Q
1643244,2015-04-30,0,yGXKMV1omio1I_3qNLdtAA,"We pulled in and the girl taking the order after pushing the drive in button really seemed to hate her job. 

As did the server that brought us our food. 

As did the worker who just go off and was complaining and yelling to her friends in the parking lot about how much her job sucked.


That being said, the burgers are always good for a mainstream fast food joint. And happy hour makes me happy. It's just not pleasant to be around people that clearly hate their time there.",5Q3J19sYxOMqXtQklNo50g,0,0,3,IsiFkz2gfQ_AYP07nMrr0g

The gentleman Donnie working the drive thru is always pleasant, As is everyone else I've encountered at this location. This is one of the only Sonics in Vegas that actually listens to the customer! My drink is always perfect, this rarely happens at any other location.

Occasionally I will splurge and get cheese sticks or the poppers. Decent food I guess, I keep coming back. 4 stars because no matter if they are busy or not, be prepared to get the ""sorry for your wait"" at the drive thru. A little annoying but doesn't stop me from coming back.",aiTzsWRE8wV-DodyrHHvMw,0,0,4,fRDJQ6bv31myJOp3Zypv8g
3347754,2017-05-03,0,yGXKMV1omio1I_3qNLdtAA,The worst experience I've ever had in fast food. We ordered 6 shakes and family onion rings. Took 10-15mins to get the wrong order. Then another 7-10 to get another wrong order. With no correct order in site we decided to get our money back after 30+ mins. No one seemed to care that we waisted our time to leave with nothing. The worst part is telling your kids sorry no shakes today. This is an terrible establishment and I wont be back. Thier bring back the old drive in tradition with terrible service/wrong orders and they dont care.,_FBFGIcazgiM4j700y_XVg,0,0,1,nVows23KD0abe4j1_KpmUQ
3630451,2015-03-04,1,yGXKMV1omio1I_3qNLdtAA,"Honestly, I enjoy visiting sonic drive - in's. Especially during their happy hours between 3pm to 5pm. 1/2 DRINKS with real fruit!! 

The entire deal of a sonic drive - in is you order from your parked car and eat and relax in your parked car. With no rush whatsoever. It is excellent! 

I ordered, at this location, their snickers waffle cone sundae and the chili cheese tatter tots. My boyfriend ordered the Oreo shake. Their ice cream is light and creamy while the tatter tots are salt, but both together are delicious. 

The customer service is great. The drive in was clean. 

I recommend trying their waffle cone sundaes!!",-jL7hLAAwOnCAWKQlL9Wew,1,2,5,yfnsIBT6N44KZe3OdOK0fg

3895443,2017-02-05,0,yGXKMV1omio1I_3qNLdtAA,"I love Sonic, especially the happy hour.  But this particular location just seems to keep getting worse and worse with their service.  I feel like I always wait at the drive-thru longer than going to the car hop, and whoever works at the drive-thru window always seems to hate their job, especially the women.  I understand the need for having a job to pay the bills, but jeez, make the most of it and don't be rude to people who don't deserve it.  There have also been a few times where they'll keep my loose change.  It's not much, just a few cents here and there, but that's just bad cashiering, unless they do that all day and collect it.  Either way, I avoid this location.  I'm tired of their horrible service.",dFHDc2t9sjuZ8cb-kEfrYw,0,0,2,oSZ4qkLE4qHLwJgpPG_KHQ
4224150,2016-04-03,0,yGXKMV1omio1I_3qNLdtAA,Stopped by for a quick snack and drink and as always food was hot and fresh and the limeade was very good. Things were very busy this particular afternoon and it took a little extra time but the staff was very apologetic about the situation. This review is to offset some of the bad reviews they will surely get from ungrateful impatient people that have nothing better to do than write bad reviews on Yelp. Bravo staff at Sonic you did a fine job despite your very busy day and don't pay attention to people that use social media to flog you like a dead horse because you were having a hard time keeping up.,l-7wr5ZO1Mghivkxw4BSsA,1,0,5,cgswsq9tr3M8igCYRIRRHg

4334169,2018-06-27,0,yGXKMV1omio1I_3qNLdtAA,Me and my family went here last night and ordered a whole bunch of stuff including  A chicken strip dinner when we got home we open the box and found that there was no onion rings and Texas toast was falsely advertised. So we called and the shift manager Anthony was very nice about the whole situation and gave us a free chicken strip dinner so the next day we came to come pick it up And we open the box before we left and there was only one onion ring in the box so we pull up and asked for the manager and shay came out and was acting like a complete bitch She got surprised that we were asking if it Only came with one onion she said yes with a attitude and a stank face. As we were driving off she continued to look at us with a very ugly bitch face. Like come on who wants to eat one onion ring I know she would be disappointed if she open the box and only had one. I know she was back there eating the rest of the onion rings. ANTHONY AND NICHOLAS were very good employees and SHAY needs to get fired.,fuBgc_yfVUF4kGlUBalOFA,0,0,1,pVp2N8gOkjg8cWtg7qt7Aw

4443536,2018-01-07,0,yGXKMV1omio1I_3qNLdtAA,This is the worst sonic. I am a teen myself but these teens didn't even know how to work. They messed up my order and didn't give me a drink. Then when they gave it to me they gave me the wrong size. I wouldn't go back here ever because they don't know how to cook or make anything. Then all they did was talk to each other and grab whatever they saw and put it in the bag. Then one of the girls was giving dirty looks. My food also came out cold since they cooked and made the other orders drinks. Worst sonic ever !,YkUbe8uX4fU9LyN4D25baw,0,0,1,NbRba5S6yiRha5a2iROKeg
4764552,2015-12-20,2,yGXKMV1omio1I_3qNLdtAA,"My friend I stopped at this place for a drink and a quick bite to eat, before we went tire shopping. We ordered 2 Large Slushes, a chicken sandwich, 2 corn dogs and a medium chili cheese tot.

I ate the chicken sandwich, but the chicken strips were stale. The sandwich was poor quality, even for a fast food joint. It was terribly made. It had a terrible taste too.

The corn dogs and Slushes were normal. Nothing to report there.

The chili cheese tot, however, was not normal. After I found a fork in my car, because they didn't include one in my bag, I took a couple bites of the tots. I noticed, maybe after the third bite, there was something gray on top of the chili. It looked to be an ashes from a cigarette or mold even. I was so disgusted!

I called the restaurant back and asked for the manager. The lady that answered identified herself as the manager. I said, ""I just pulled off. I ordered the Chili Cheese Tot and the other stuff. As I was eating the tots, I noticed mold or something gray on my tots."" The lady response was, ""Oh ok! Just come back in and bring your receipt and we'll give you another one or your money back. You can pull through the drive thru or car hop."" 

That was it. She showed no empathy, no emotion, no anything.
I did expect her to beg for my forgiveness or offer me free food for a year, or anything. I just wanted her to say something to let me know that the quality of food she's serving, matters to her. She could have even pretended to care about my health or well being. But nope, she didn't.

I took the tots back after about 1 hour because I was busy. I pulled to the window and told them what happened and again, no empathy. I passed the tots through the window and lady came back and asked for the receipt. She noticed I had paid with a gift card. She made a big deal about refunding my money, because I told her it would freeze my card if she issues a refund.

She told me I could contact the Area manager but there was no way for her to give me my money back. I was pissed. We had a few words and she ended up giving me 2 coupons for $2 off on food (coupon can be used at other locations). I told her that I was never coming back and she was like, Ok! Have a good day.

I'm pissed because I just lost my Drink Stop but oh well. I'm sure there's other places around. I added this place to my ""Never Again"" List.",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,2,2,1,EsDdNIiwvkMdBYgxCzCRCg
