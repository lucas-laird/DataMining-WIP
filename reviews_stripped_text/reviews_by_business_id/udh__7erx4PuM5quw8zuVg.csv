I have had bad experiences but have never left a bad review until now because I think somebody needs to deal with this employee. This just three hours ago. My husband and I stopped here to quickly grab food for our friends who had just gotten married. We called first to order, but the guy who answered said they don't take phone orders. We asked him to please make an exception but he said no. So we got there 3 min later and realized it was almost like a food cart (it made sense why they didn't accept call orders) and we got in line to place our order. 

Our turn came super fast, but long story short the employee that we spoke with on the phone (and we know it was him because  while in line we mentioned that we called and he said he had answered) was really passive aggressive and rude. He didn't even speak to us, just waved with his hand and told us to stand right next to the line and he'll come help us. Then he proceeded to make food for two other groups. We were literally standing right in front of him so it's not like he forgot - he was purposely being rude as a way of demeaning us for the phone request, even though we weren't rude and didn't insist or anything. My husband had to say to him ""excuse me, I ordered ___"" before the guy grudgingly made our food. It was a really frustrating experience especially because what should have taken 5 minutes took way longer because this guy had no manners. He was the African or African American male, darker skin, with more grown out hair than the other employee.

Edit: the owner messaged me and fully apologized, said employees have been spoken to, and that he would give us a full refund. I really appreciate his kindness and I'm glad they responded and dealt with it. Changing to a four star!",H3PXlBZsVGoI9vaRfPcRbw,1,0,4,LyEcrZTVyTBbGY_zBCv3IA

It is located in Bally's Grand Bazaar Shops with flourishing eateries nearby. The eye-catching vertical rotisserie is similar to Greek gyros and Mexican Al pastor. The short menu makes it an ideal quick fix food to go, but seats are limited within the Bazaar Shops.

When there's a gyro on the menu, it's what I usually order. I came here for lunch and they weren't quite ready. I was told to come back in 15 minutes hoping to have the freshest meat on hand. I ordered the beef and lamb combination Turkish sandwich style. You have options for the type of veggies and two different types of sauces- white and red. Their toppings are unlike your Greek Gyro version such as having pickles on gyros which I opted out. 

I was not too happy that the meat I was given was pre-sliced and overcooked. It was also hard and chewy. The seasoning and white sauce used were not as flavorful compared to what I am accustomed to with the Greek version. The beef and lamb with all the fixings still had a lot of wiggle room. The price of $9.95 with no sides included, I'll stick to my neighborhood shish kebab place for all the right reasons.",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,24,23,3,kKFUQwd2fzLsBTtDxdlDyw

The veggies were okay, except the turnips had no vinegar pop to them, nor did the pickles.  The tzatziki sauce lacked flavor and the red sauce lacked spice.

Open til 5 AM, you're going to get your appetite satisfied with their delicious gyros.  The flavors are so good, they might even measure up closely to some of the better NYC food carts.  

My choice is aways the chicken and lamb combo.  You get a hefty portion of both meats, a good portion of rice, and a whole plethora of veggies/condiments.   Their white sauce might not beat the original Halal Guy's white ""crack"" sauce, but it gets the job done.   And unlike the Halal guys ""burning hot, so hot you might die"" hot sauce, Istanbul's hot sauce is actually reasonably hot without detracting from the flavor.

I started ordering one bowl at a time on our staycations on the Strip, but when my wife started finishing up my bowl, we now order our own.   It's plenty of food but it's hard to put down once you start.  Definitely a great and cheap option when trying to locate food on the Strip.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,4,2,4,pRgK3555fitUWVe571ncbw

It's been over two months since I've had the pleasure of feasting upon their beef and lamb ""sandwich"" (gyro, doner, whatever you want to call it). Not only did they load it with shredded lettuce, a mountain of thinly sliced red onions, diced tomatoes, pickles, pickled red cabbage, and a mountain of steaming meat; they then put tzatziki, TAHINI SAUCE, and some red chili sauce on top of that. I think I shed a tear in line.

My first bite into this thing was one of the best first bites of anything I've ever eaten. The sauces mixing perfectly with the warm, salty, meat. The crisp veggies offering a satisfying crunch and fresh flavor. I think it took me twenty seconds to eat, and they were probably the best twenty seconds of my life. I walked away from Bally's with a sense of sadness and, despite being very full, a feeling of emptiness. Would a meal ever be that satisfying again? Is that spinning meat cone the true meaning of life? 

Many questions are left unanswered, but what I do know is that I am never moving away from Vegas so long as Instanbul Mediterranean is open. I feel truly blessed to live within driving distance of this place.

So my husband left to get them pasta from sbarro downstairs...and given we get to have a choice now, since we're at Bally's..this was the perfect time to try this! 

My husband had the lamb sandwich while I ordered the Chicken sandwich. Mine was a tad bit on the heavy side but the flavors were pretty packed and juicy. I can't really say too much about the lamb sandwich but lets just say...he killed it in just a few bites. They were pretty big and really filling. I'm actually a bit surprised at the quality in the pita and the meat. I would recommend this place to anyone who's down for Mediterranean food on the strip.

5190710,2018-06-17,0,udh__7erx4PuM5quw8zuVg,"Halal food on the Las Vegas strip sounds like an oxymoron. But there it is and proudly on display. I had their doner sandwich twice. The first time they had some meat already prepared. The second they cut it fresh from the spit. Oddly enough the already prepared meat was nicer but not by a lot. It just had this crispiness I really enjoyed. The meat is nicely salty, juicy, fatty, flavorful, and satisfying. I normally don't order chicken doner but it looked good and also didn't disappoint. They heat up their bread so it's soft yet chewy. Their white sauce is also very good. More on the herbal tzatziki side than the more vinegary halal guys version. So great halal food with easy access on the strip and open late. What more could you want.",8fcwEMhVjcjgFuF-QphpDQ,1,1,5,-fq73w0aM3DcmUvQkbblcA

The meat tasted like it was rubber, absolutely disgusting and was extremely salty. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money here.",9BssL2LGs_GyY89DKL0dTA,0,0,1,DIqzUPzUDlznqUboWJ3eWA

5351990,2018-07-01,0,udh__7erx4PuM5quw8zuVg,"For those comparing this place to Halal Brothers.  Relax.  This is such basic food.  The extra crispness you taste on your meat is burnt.  I got the combo plate and every bite was like swallowing chards of glass.  It was dry, the sauce masked the non -seasoned tastes of the meats, the rice tasted like it was cooked in a vat of butter. 
Very pedestrian,  very uninspired,  cannot believe all the rave reviews they've gotten but please, if you are ever in NYC, try The Halal brothers on the corner of 53rd and 6th diagonal, i repeat, diagonal from the Hilton hotel.  Stand in land and thank me later.  Istanbul...get it together!",dcqBmGnYKwWGM7exWzitmA,0,0,2,HIHuL31d6y5TokTTsxINkA

Oh my this place was tasty. I had a beef n lamb sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich was just the right size to share with my hubby. Though I think I could have finished it on my own. The meat was tender and I was really enjoying the veggies. The white sauce made this sandwich. The price was a little more than what I wanted to pay, but for this place being on the strip its a good price. Will be stopping by before the rush of people. The line got pretty long at about 5pm on sunday when we went.
This place is located in the Grand Bazaar outisde of the Bailys hotel and casino in the front near Las Vegas Blvd. You can valet, but we parked in the back of the hotel. Needed the walk after all the grubbing",15EfkL69gvmLmrvYGODDqw,35,19,5,vuAG4Qn6_3tDvU82VlOwPQ

They were fast and super friendly while making my sandwich. Definitely get all of the sauces-they add so much flavor. They have a variety of toppings for any of the sandwiches of bowls. I got them all- lettuce, red cabbage, pickles, tomatoes and red onions. My sandwich was plenty substantial for the $10 price tag. Not many places to get a meal of that size for that price tag on the Vegas strip. I wish that I had tried the baba ganoosh or even the hummus but I know where I will be going next time I'm in town.",bEXtBenbCGae5YPIPJ2B6g,0,0,5,DHXG7QzfB_jtpy-qsjzuJA
