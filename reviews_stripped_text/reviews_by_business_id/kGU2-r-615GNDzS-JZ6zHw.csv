Pizza! place :-P The prices are fairly reasonable & they have deals all the time. The pizza here is pretty greasy, but not any worse than any other pizza joint. They are definitely nice & cheesy, which I love...a lot! They also have 8 flavored crusts to choose from; original, butter, cajun, butter cheese, sesame, ranch, garlic herb, and onion. My personal fave is garlic herb. They also have the other usual suspects, breadsticks, cinna-bread, wings, subs & salads. I can't really opine on any of those, other than the cinna-bread. Not really something I would order again. But, you an judge for yourself. Also, no matter what size you order, all pizzas are sliced into 8 slices. Oh & one major downfall, IMO is that they serve that inferior cola product that has always been & will probably always be 2nd to Coke ;-)",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,1,1,4,qB3umS6MA_TwN8ZQdqIFNw

I asked why they had a system that said 60 minutes and he put me on hold.  A couple of minutes later an ""assistant manager"" picked up.  She told me that their system is wrong and sorry but ""too bad"" this is what I had to deal with.  She said actually it was going to be another 30 minutes - that is 1 hr and 40 minutes to get a pizza...because they didn't have it done and no driver was available.  This is definitely a management issue. The assistant manager did not offer to make it right in any way.

I liked the yellow and black NYC taxicab-ish theme.

I was greeted by an unfriendly, inattentive employee who took payment and left on a delivery.

The lobby was very dirty and the general maintenance was poor. Dirt and garbage everywhere, dirty, poorly maintained soda machines, and a non-operational TV adorn the interior of this joint.

The pizza was mediocre at best, on par or below the standards of similarly priced and staffed outfits. (Little Caesars, for example)

It will take some serious convincing to pass up Little Caesars for this place in my future cheap pizza excursions.",II6YjclTbesSBgsV4teGRQ,0,0,2,CQ9cTfSG0NTHvxjna1ksKw

$5.55 for a large one-topping carryout is a good deal, and the pizza is better than we expected.  The cheese is advertised as real mozzarella and is probably the highlight; next time I'll ask for extra. The flavored crust is unique in this segment.  We tried the garlic herb and it is good.  Their online menu did not list jalapenos as a topping, but they have them.  The hot wings are the same as you get at any pizza place, baked in the oven and not crispy.  The hot sauce is serviceable but not memorable.  We tried an order of the cinnamon bread and we surprised at how good it was.  Not a gourmet dish of course, but chewy with lots of cinnamon and icing; it really cures a sweet tooth.

Based on reviews prior to 04/2012 we anticipated poor service, but the nice lady who took our phone order was very patient and friendly.  My wife picked up the order and she said the place looked clean and everybody was friendly, even when she tacked on the order of cinnamon bread as an impulse buy (she smelled it when she walked into the store and had to buy it).

I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner. The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza. 

Hungry Howie's claims to be ""The Home of the Flavored Crust"" and offers 8 different types to choose from. The concept here I do like. It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place. Well, it is in my opinion. The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion. Sounds great right?

I ordered a large ""Cheese Pizza"" and a large ""1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza"" as well ""Asiago Howie Bread"" to go along with the pizza. When I first opened the pizza it looked great. I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust. I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor. Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead? The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great. Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer. Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor. The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for. The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked. I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon.

So he tells a gal in the back to which she replies ""I don't really care right now I'm to busy with this""...I think he either knew it wasn't like there was a back office or that her voice did carry because he looked embarrassed for her when he reappeared from behind the half wall.

""Are you serious""
""Yes""
so...needless to say I got to wondering if my veggie side would get tomato, would they even say anything to me that they were out?  would they just hope i didn't notice and skip the apology?  ended up being the latter. :(

I ordered the stuffed crust pizza for carry out, my order was made very quickly & I had no issues when picking it up & the pizza was delicious. I give 4 stars because the flavor of the crust (garlic herb) was a bit over the top for me & also part of the lobby was taped off & paint containers were all over the floor which I feel isn't the best thing for a business that sells food but other than that it wasn't a bad place at all.",S5Rm61sJ5VGBhuTYMnj_hg,0,0,4,kY9k--v-nubYyKO_MC-BLQ

Good Pizza and the kids actually eat the flavored crust, I love it when I don't have to eat everyone's left over crust just so we don't waste! Register and order online and you get a free medium one topping pizza! They also offer great deals online any day of the week.",ghW-kD3SR52-Nn8kkcew8A,1,2,5,uyajJiXBufmjhyK_u46JhQ

The people are jerks! Seriously, every time I order, they act like your doing them a favor to treat you like crap. I had the manager take my order this evening, Vanessa, good grief. I'm sorry for adding something to my order so I can spend more money at your establishment. Geez...
But the delivery guys are always nice :)",-CbHAhVrqoDUoJFAv6Xp-A,2,1,3,e-SR3cvZ_V6tmG_WDNEliQ
