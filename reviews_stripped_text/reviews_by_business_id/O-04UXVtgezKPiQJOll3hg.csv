364502,2013-05-17,0,O-04UXVtgezKPiQJOll3hg,"As far as subs go, my family loves Firehouse!  

My husband and I are able to share the 12 inch sandwich - which saves us some money.  The meat served at Firehouse is excellent - some of the best in town.  The sandwich comes with a lot of meat and less veggies - unlike other places in town who skimp on the meat by overloading the sandwich with veggies.

We love the Italian sub!  My husband - who LOVES HIM SOME SUBS - says the Ham at Firehouse is cooked in a special way and has a perfect sweetness to it for ham.  

We also love the Kids Specials here.  Our little one gets a turkey sandwich and a Fire Hat - what else can you ask for!  As far as Kids Menu's goes, this is one of the best in town for a quickie eatery.  

The restaurant is new and very clean and the staff are very polite and helpful.  

We also love Capriotti's - but when the little kiddo is in tow - we pick Firehouse for their family friendly restaurant setting and excellent kids menu.",JnN7fWESKk3MXR2zfD_XKw,1,2,5,nHO-a6JcgksjXhtaOqaOnA

Come on to seen in recent years along side jersey mikes and jimmy johns. Question is what they serve is it fresh and is any good.

Well I opted for a meatball and provolone with a sweet and spicy sauce . Sad to say this sub was less than pleasing . Let's 1st start off with the meat itself tasted like it came out of a bag not homemade at least from what I tasted .

 no flavor in the meat just plain bland. Second the sauce was from a can obviously and didn't have any flavor or punch to it. Have no clue what they are talking about spicy . There was no spice to this sauce whatsoever. 


And finally the provolone cheese . What little there was I couldn't even taste it. Talk about being cheap it , the cheese disintegrate as it covers the meatballs .
You can see for yourself on the picture I posted. Sorry firehouse but maybe your the founders which are fireman should stick to putting out fires and leave the sandwich making to the other guys .",ls1W6x0XuOYfLjw8CS-Ywg,0,0,1,QWr3pcrlM5CZtVlMbW0T-g

With lots of other sub options more convenient to me, I'd been telling myself, ""It's a sub sandwich... HOW much better could it really be??""  To my surprise, the answer is ALOT better!!  Upon entering, the dining area is extremely spacious and clean.  The staff greeted me promptly, asked if it was my first time visiting, and gave me a quick rundown of the menu and options.  When he mentioned all subs come toasted by default, I wasn't too impressed... with images of a toasted Subway sandwich flashing to mind... I could take it or leave it, but, in Subway's case, generally leave it.  Anyways, since is was Firehouse's default, I left it as toasted... and I'm so glad I did!  I don't know what they do differently here, but it wasn't the same sad attempt at toasting I was accustomed to - it was done to perfection.  I ordered the #4 Italian, and it came loaded with extremely flavorful meats.  I ordered the default toppings, which is referred to as ""Fully Involved"" - it was the perfect mix of veggies to add texture and flavor, but not drown out the flavors of the meats.  As for their default dressing that comes with it, it's superb and has a little kick with hints of horseradish or wasabi.

This location is really clean and it's nice of the workers to offer to take your basket when you're done. I also like their soda machine because it has soo many options and I also like that they offer a large range of hot sauces! My favorites are their smokehouse beef & cheddar brisket and their club on a sub. They offer catering and you can also order online :),Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,2,1,4,YI4tMIkzGPT382OiOlutKQ

I told the lady who was cashiering that it was my first time here and she was kind and told me how it works there (all sandwiches are served hot, etc).  Another detail I would like to point out is that it was a little chilly inside the shop and the cashier noticed me shivering and she promptly turned the air up to make me feel more comfortable.  That was incredibly nice of her.  I was impressed.  

I ordered the Turkey Bacon Ranch 8 inch sub with a bag of chips and a soda on the side.  I love the soda machine.  Wingstop has it too and some 7/11 locations and it's amazing.  ""120+ drink choices"" as advertised on their cups.  I got cherry limeade and mm mm good.  

Now to the sub.  It was smaller than I was expecting.  But that does make it any less delicious.  Because it was just that, delicious.  The quality of this sandwich surpasses anything that comes out of Subway.  Subway is good in its own way but this sandwich from firehouse subs is gourmet level.

As I sat there waiting for my sandwich, I saw many others who ordered after me getting their food. I asked the lady running the food to check on it. She said oh I think yours is on the counter. Not sure how long it had been sitting there but a hot sub sitting on the counter for any length of time is not a good idea. She brought it over and matched the order number with my receipt. I asked her what name they were calling. She said Joe? Like it was a question to me. I said my name is not Joe and why they would ask for my name if they were just going to make one up? She said to me very rudely...well you're Joe now. I said no I'm not and I don't appreciate you making fun of the situation. She walked off never to be seen again. Sub on the other was not as good as other locations.  Bread was not soft, turkey seemed dry and overall presence was lacking again compared to other locations.

This location is great. The lobby is really big, and is bright as well. My husband and I ordered the Malibu, which has turkey, spinach, tomato, onion, guacamole and spicy honey mustard sauce. We actually split a sandwich, and asked for the honey mustard on the side. My choice. It is a good sauce, but the 'spicy' in it is horseradish. Although it is a mild horseradish flavor, I am not all that fond of any kind of horseradish and didn't want to overdo it. I need not have worried. The sauce was pretty tasty, and I ended up putting on more of it that I originally thought that I would. We were given the option to 'split plates', which they gave us each our own basket and cut the sandwich in half. We each got a pickle as well. Nice!

The bread is so fresh, and really tasty. The bread really makes the sandwich. The sandwiches are not brimming with ingredients, but what they do use tastes very fresh and is flavorful. My husband is a huge fan of hot sauces, and was thrilled to bring back a few samples of their hot sauces to the table. They have small cups to use so that you are not taking the entire bottle back to your table. They are also numbered according to their heat level.

We watched a bowling tournament on tv while we were eating which we enjoyed rather then watching something usual that's on every other tv in a business you walk into. Walking distance from our place in a convenient location. Also loved that the bathroom has a motion soap and papertowel which really helps control spreading germs. Definitely not the first or the last time. Ill always support firemen, my dad hopes I carry on the family legacy and become 4th generation!",OcpafkffKgKP5Aqm2ljCJA,0,0,4,cZXbRwhy4j_FJ-3OWEFHhg
5528103,2017-10-19,0,O-04UXVtgezKPiQJOll3hg,Absolutely Delicious ! I get the Turkey Bacon Ranch sub and well worth it if you are in the Las Vegas area. The service could be a little faster I guess but well worth the few minute wait and the people that work there are always friendly. One of the best ways to knock out a lunch for 10 bucks.,Sa419P1h9y5bQb5ynGShEA,0,0,4,hEO7WwB_NX2zF89FaALvlA

5580368,2014-11-07,0,O-04UXVtgezKPiQJOll3hg,Friendly service...Fast Service...Sandwich was awesome. They have a select number of sandwiches that are under 500 calories. I've only tried one (Turkey Salsa Verde) and it was awesome. Can't wait to try the others.,j9vih1KD2r-NLlaHfZPkRA,0,0,5,L7JOOB8b_YNBjC4TAfiJDw

Went last Saturday around lunch time and decided to try something different there ( I usually get the philly cheese steak).  I got a meatball sub HOLY BALLSACKS have you ever tried a meatball sub?? IT'S AMAZING! The bread was all soft and the meatballs were hot and it was smothered in cheese.  And I got a salad and loved it as well.

We wanted to let you know that we've removed your review of Firehouse Subs. Your review was brought to our attention by the Yelp community, and we found that it fell outside our Content Guidelines because it did not provide enough detail about your customer experience. 

The best reviews provide context, detail and perhaps even a helpful tip or two. Feel free to post a new review with more information about your experience with this business. ""

This was my original review: ""Decent sandwiches. Fresh ingredients. Not wowed. M'eh. Just okay.""

And I stand by it.  The more mediocre the experience, the more mediocre and short-worded the review will be.

If I MUST extrapolate, then I will say: the brand is gorgeous.  Great marketing.  Decent space, if not a bit deep - it makes me feel like I should be ordering as it's made (ala Cafe Rio/Chipotle/Subway) but their preferred method is the whole ""tell us how you want it"".  Would I eat here, again?  No.  Probably not on my own volition, but if someone asks if I want a Hook and Ladder, sure.  I'll have one.

But I'd rather have a Jimmy John's/Subway if I have the choice.",Yi_dLDbN-iobnrt5Nmepag,2,0,2,MZFMwQKQQ3cvgIXdQ79uVQ
5840955,2015-11-23,1,O-04UXVtgezKPiQJOll3hg,"I never heard of this sandwich chain before and since I was starving after my flight, I decided to check this spot out. As I entered, the employees were super friendly and explained everything really well. Everything looked great on the menu, but I ended up getting the Engineer. This toasted sandwich comes with smoked turkey breast, swiss cheese, and sautéed mushrooms, mayo, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a kosher dill pickle on the side. The sandwich was quickly made and was perfect to satisfy my hunger. Overall, if you're looking for an upgraded sandwich experience then forget about Subway and come to Firehouse!",78c_llOEjlJ5lW35bL137w,1,2,5,iI-v0BHObm7LDCbLUyl02g
5881853,2015-10-14,0,O-04UXVtgezKPiQJOll3hg,"Great shop with good variety.  Love all the hot sauce varieties available.  Never had any problem with the service.  Friendly and open to requests.  One of the ""management"" guys stopped by the building where we've been working in town on and off for the last couple of months with coupons.  I wouldn't have known about this place otherwise so that was cool.  Sandwiches are good and ambiance is nice.  I'll be back.",jz0a_ye-afzzPZp7FI4TTg,0,0,5,w5g4hhMPY5h30HoVV5QyiA

I love the arrangement of the condiments is up front, and to the right hand corner is the soda fountain, lots of seating in the establishments and it is a decent place to relax and have a meal during lunch time.",DsVnd4PH2nkbxo8UeGW3Mw,0,0,4,_bLcRV-B0_dSf-yMKRdxpw
