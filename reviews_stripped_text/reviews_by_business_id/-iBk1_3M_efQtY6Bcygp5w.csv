My boyfriend and I were staying at the Boulder Station hotel and casino for a car show and didn't want to spend a fortune on food for the weekend. We stopped by this place for dinner real quick and it was so good! I got the taco plate with the rice and beans. All of it was delicious and super cheap! We ended up eating there again for lunch the next day right before we left Vegas. I would definitely recommend this place! Can't wait to get it again sometime.,NqfPp--F2l2j6vPwp5XdzQ,0,0,5,tiVmAAa16IxG4QOIHlagBg

Try them- you won't be disappointed. The Guacamole is also excellent!",k-K_FkBbjN42lZIY0lHkCw,0,0,5,Y-c7y3eEBEwS3XQNlAPAqg

Tried two different types of salsa as well (green and red medium) which added just the right amount of kick to my meal.  Would highly recommend",KArDHXi-SLgFufvr_7j4VA,0,0,5,DYABbTru3Ut5VVe33Y0VJg

A few weeks ago my hub and I were desperate for food that wasn't fast food or sit down. We happen to stumble upon viva salsa which has a cheap and simple menu so we decided to try it.

I ordered the chicken taco plate, which includes rice, refried beans and the usual taco fixings + drink 5.99. My hub had the burrito plate that included the same sides + drink 5.99. In a nutshell we had a really delicious and fresh hot meal for under $13 that hit the spot on hunger and wallet.

The only small down side is we waited in line for about 20 minutes till we could order, but the food came out quicker than expected. Yay! I love this little taco joint and if you give it a try I'm sure you'll love it too!",5I6-yegWr4p1mtUMwNkVtg,1,0,4,KGU3YAyHKRQzB2WxLOcUIw

My boyfriend also enjoyed their chicken nachos combo with rice and beans. Best thing in Boulder Station when it comes to take out!",TAla2wVHtYyzt3ysBJvngw,0,0,5,7nP0Ux7n3XNRr0u2S3U-GA

When we arrived, a supervisor at the casino was getting his meal and the cook Michel was handling his food like he was cooking for the Queen of England! You could see the steam off the food! I ordered what that guy had; quesadilla. This poor guy was very slow and not very personable with the public. As he was taking orders, a mean, chunky lady comes in and washes her hands and starts cooking! You would think that with her cooking your food would come out hot...NOT SO!!! Nothing was hot!!! I stood there and watched her cook!!! How can you cook food and it not be hot?!! And, the refried beans and spanish rice were not hot either! Looks like someone needs to take lessons from a solo driver at your sister casino!!! Will not be eating at this one again! And, since I am on Boulder...let me review my experience at the buffet two weeks ago....",nWQZkvuWYtFjgw9GxQL8JQ,0,0,2,kq4_SsVZ7IVpTZcLsN8kBA

We got to the restaurant and there wasn't a line at all.  Now, for those who haven't read my other reviews should know that I eat Ultra Low Carb during the week.  So, I won't eat the tortillas, chips etc...  It wasn't a problem here though.  I ended up having a tortilla-less carne asada burrito.  It was really good and filling.  My sister and her husband were raving about their burritos as well.  They liked them so much they went back and ordered two more to take home.  The atmosphere is really laid back.  A few high tables that overlook the casino and the Kixx Bar.  It's a good place to relax and people watch, if that is what you are into.  Because there are definitely a cast of characters that tend to walk around this casino.  But, that is for a different review.

*side note: I was taking a ration of crap from my relatives in tow.  They were saying ""you're not one of those guys that takes pictures of your food are you?""  So, out of my new insecurity I only got pictures of the front of the place and not my food.  So, next time I go, and there will be a next time, I'll grace you with a picture.

I say, a job well done and I'll be back as it is relatively close to home.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,0,0,4,wVqILKE8wUj4eFaQ0yqQFQ

The service was very friendly and could help you with anything.
The food is really good and not too expensive.",F2av57ztcbYiPADtT-YpdA,1,1,5,ysdFC8TBJR-SkxGPSlsCRA

We got there and the front of the restaurant looked cheap and commercial. It was not very big and we didn't see many people eating there. We started looking up and down the casino to see if something else looked better. But...

We decided to try the restaurant. Edgar, the chef, talked to us first and he said that he would be able to accommodate our wheat allergy. The food that he served us was great. I had just spent a week in San Antonio and none of those Mexican joints could hold a candle to this place. There was so much flavor, great portion size, and all three of us were stuffed for under $20. Thanks Edgar for such a great meal! Don't judge this book by its cover, get in there and let the food do the talking.",N98RJzouf9ddjekbaNHw2A,0,0,5,qVYSuI_w5qF_nnitAkHjuA
