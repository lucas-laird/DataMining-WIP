Found this via Yelp and I am so happy I did. I haven't had homemade pierogis like this since my grandmother made them over 20 years ago.  My husband and I gorged ourselves on Pierogis and polish sausage. He got the Mixed Plate. It was $14 and he got a generous piece of Polish sausage with a big piece of bread. He chose the sauerkraut and mushroom pierogis and the traditional Polish meat pierogis which the plate comes with 6 so he got 3 of each...oh and the must have caramelized onions. The pierogi filling was excellently seasoned and tasted phenomenal. The dough was a perfect flavor. Homemade all the way.  The sausage is to die for. Polska power! 
I got the Mixed Plate $14. It comes with 12 pierogis. I chose the spinach and feta cheese, the sauerkraut and mushroom, and the potato cheese and onion.  The spinach and feta was my favorite. The flavors go so well together. The taste of the dough....wow. It was a match made in heaven.  I had to try the potato cheese and onion because thats what I remember eating growing up and they were so good. Not one of the flavors overpowered the other. The mixture of the filling was perfect.  
We left so full and so happy.
The service was friendly. I think we were helped by the owner and she was very nice. 
This is located on the west side of the indoor swap meet building. It has its own entrance for when the swap meet is closed because they are open seven days a week.

Homemade pierogi (just like my moms & grandmas). Ask a real Polak if these are authentic and I'll gladly say ~ heck yes! 

We haven't had a Polish restaurant in years and this is pretty exciting for me. Pierogi (Polish dumplings) are one of the most popular dishes in Poland and this place does them very well. They are big & hearty. Full of flavor. You can choose from several different filling options like meat, potato & cheese and cabbage with mushrooms. Try them sautéed and throw on some caramelized onions & bacon and just enjoy. I also recommend some sour cream because that brings all the flavors together. 

This place also offers a lot of other traditional Polish dishes like ~ stuffed cabbage, pork cutlet, soups, sandwiches & European pastries. It's super cute inside with Polish decor and everyone who works here is Polish! I really enjoyed speaking to them & the service is on point.

1993547,2016-08-19,13,XaRLRVEAOwxQjgF1_iU_jQ,"Pierogi are a perfect food: handheld, comforting, available in a variety of flavors. Unfortunately they're not particularly good for you and difficult to find, even in this city of a million restaurants. Enter Pierogi Cafe, filling the void for Polish-food-loving citizens!

The namesake pierogis are large and stuffed with filling, with several options to choose from. Grab the mix and match plate on your first visit to try a few. The spinach and feta is my favorite, and the chef's special with white sausage was also good, but the traditional was a little dry and lackluster- which is in line with homemade versions I've had. Props for authenticity.  The wrappers were thick and doughy, in a way that my Russian-born BF did not care for and compared unfavorably to a potsticker. I still enjoyed the flavors, so given the proximity to our house, I'll probably be eating them again.

If, God forbid, you are some sort of heathen who does not like pierogi, they have other options- the Polish sandwich is an epic indulgence. Picture a small loaf of bread split in half, then served open-faced with seasoned sauteed mushrooms, onions, and a mountain of cheese. If you can stomach all the dairy, it's enough food for two, and under $10.

Location is cute and modern despite the flea market-adjacent location. Staff are super sweet, and the food quite frankly is better than it needs to be.

Pierogi (dumplings Polish style) are available fried or boiled and several filling options. I can say the potato onion and meat version are good. Don't forgot to add onion, sour cream, and applesauce for .50c each, I got all 3 but used most the applesauce on my pork chop. 

I had plenty food already but the pork chop sounded good. I'm glad I ordered it. Cooked great, thin breading. Sauerkraut on the side was good. Potatoes were okay and needed a little work, the green seasoning helped.

First time trying Polish food I think.
I don't have extensive experience with it. The restaurant, modestly decorated space is comfortable and inviting, 

I walked in and was debating what to get. The owner was very nice and mentioned there are pictures on the wall if I needed to see them.

I am not sure if I've tried a pierogi before, I was assuming they were like dumplings but they're actually very different.

I learned Pierogis are strictly steamed and the owner asked if I wanted it to be fried.

When I ate them, the dough of the pierogis was delicious and very soft! I had the Polish meat Pierogis and Spinach and Feta Cheese. I have to say my favorite was the Polish meat. The meat in it was very moist and saucy, very flavorful.",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,1,0,4,4KbDfvrP-mtpT-5QDnhYPQ

I was confused to get to this place. The door was locked to the café from the outside. I called and they told me I had to enter from the swap meat entrance on weekends. $1 to get in. 
When I found this place (turn right at isle B), I was welcomed by this nice Polish lady. She recommended me to try their Pierogi. I ordered the Mixed Plate that comes with three different kinds of Pierogi.
Pierogi was like Polish version of Gyoza. The skin is much thicker than Gyoza skin but I think the process of making them is the same.
I had Traditional Polish Meat Pierogi, Potato Cheese Pierogi and Spinach and Feta Pierogi. They were all delicious but I liked the Polish Meat one the best. They were a little too greasy to me. I think they were fried with a lot of oil. Later I found out they can also boil them. (It says ""Boiled"" on the menu but they probably meant ""Steamed"")
She said next time I should try their traditional Polish sandwich. In Poland, they sell this sandwich on all over the street (Like Pretzels in NYC? I'm guessing.)

Once inside you see the Polish ladies. Sometimes they are not up front so you will have to be patient until they make it out to you. They are attentive once they know you're there.

I really enjoyed the cabbage soup. The kielbasa and mashed potatoes and schnitzel (not sure what the Polish name of it is) were satisfying and tasty.

I got 6 potato and cheese but I got them boiled--evidently the default--instead of fried.  I added the caramelized onion for a topping.  Since I also got two of the paczki to take home, the woman who waited on my gave me a cup for some free coffee from the counter near the entrance.  I enjoyed the coffee while I waited for the pierogis.

Mentally, I did a double take when I got the dumplings because of my forgetfulness.  I took a taste of one and it was rather bland.  A little salt helped the situation.  I am also not used to having pierogi made with farmers cheese instead of a more flavorful cheese.  Frying them might have made the cheese taste more, but the potato/cheese pierogi were just OK.  The dough was OK.  I appreciated the thinness of it instead of the clunky thickness of some frozen varieties.

Perhaps they had too high a standard to meet because my mother-in-law used to make the pierogis for the family.  It was her homemade pierogi that I had in mind and to that comparison, these were disappointing.  I think I get pretty much the same quality pierogi buying frozen ones available in a specialty grocery and baking them with onions and butter.

On the other hand, the two paczki were flavorful.  They are only gotten in for a short period of time before Lent--specifically some Polish friends refer to Fat Tuesday as Paczki Day.

I know pierogi are available with a number of fillings but I am more a traditionalist and go for just the potato and cheese although my mother-in-law also made sauerkraut filled pierogi which I tried once and then ignored from then on.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,11,13,3,9mp7ouN8GdCr4e6CHGygjg

Prune Paczki
Lemon Paczki
Chocolate Frosted Custard Paczki
Raspberry Paczki

Opened in the Fantastic Indoor Swapmeet towards the end of 2016, the simple concept of Housemade Dumplings and a few Polish standards such as Sausage and Cabbage Rolls anchoring a menu that also features daily Soups and a few outsourced breakfast Pastries, Pierogi Café has been a source of intrigue due to both the concept and its location for months, recent Social Media posts about Paczki for Fat Tuesday finally the impetus for a lunch-time visit.

Owned by a Polish immigrant who moved to Las Vegas due to family health issues several years ago, it was after a long time in the healthcare field that the idea to open her own restaurant came to fruition and after a bit of decision-making the opportunity presented itself in the most unlikely of places, a store with an exterior facing door at the large shopping center on the corner of Oakey and Decatur.

Recently adding proper signage, nothing fancy but enough to do the job, it was just past 11:20a that a knock on the door listing an opening time of 10:00am was unlocked, the odd policy that all patrons must pay a buck and enter through the Swap Meet on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays no doubt a deterrent to some since the counter cannot be seen from the exterior, though it appears many regulars - all of them Polish - have already learned the trick.

Perusing the menu temporarily before placing an order, the ladies behind the counter agreeing to slightly change the Mixed Plate so that four flavors could be tasted instead of three, it was with a 50/50 split of Fried versus Boiled that the order was prepared in a small kitchen behind the scenes, the pop-n'-crackle of cooking oil heard as four Polish Doughnuts that turned out to be imported from California were packed in a Styrofoam Clamshell.

Taking a seat amidst ethnic nick-knacks, two elderly women from Chicago entering and beyond excited at the prospect of fresh Pierogis, it was not long before a plate of Dumplings was sat down with a small rectangle of Granulated Sugar at the center, instructions to dip the Sweet Cheese pockets into it happily followed after taking a bite to taste one in its natural state, the inhomogenous filling's texture a lot like Ricotta with the light sweetness of Mascarpone.

Not terribly impressed by the Potato version, neither the fried nor boiled versions flavorful at all without adding on some caramelized onions a la carte, the Pork-based meat filling was obviously more flavorful, though likely to be benefitted by a bit of Pepper or spice in the mixture while the Spinach & Feta proved an undeniable favorite that tasted great boiled, but even more textural and rich when fried.

Admittedly a bit disappointed that the Paczki were made elsewhere, the Doughnuts remembered from a Childhood in Northwest Ohio nowhere to be found in Las Vegas otherwise, the quartet served at Pierogi Café through Tuesday are hit n' miss largely as a result of the unbalanced filling process that saw little more than a teaspoon of Raspberry Gel piped into one while the traditional Prune and Custard versions were crisp on the outside, springy with Eggs amidst the crumb and densely filled.

*** 1/2Appreciating the limitations of the space, as well as those intrinsic to a place focusing on one item, Pierogi Café would be well advised to dial in the execution on everything they are doing and then expand slowly while admitting up front that many of their items are made elsewhere.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,5,3,P1B3cQMB-ygftsw1CVgWeQ

Over the yrs I've seen em on some menus, especially expensive places-- but I guess they always feel pressure to add some exotic twist to justify an exorbitant price and my $30 perogies have been disappointing. This place has what I've been looking for!   It's what you want --- authentic, home-style!   It's not a place to be fancy -- I doubt they serve liquor.  But they are the real real. Sadly, I can no longer do a side-by-side comparison with Babci's... but these serve my childhood memories extremely well... Go! Don't you want to know what authentic perogies taste like? You'll LOVE them. Plus we need to support this kind of establishment.  Give corporate chain restaurants a break, they can afford it!",Z11M5QBjRT_kwg1cl4ugKg,1,1,5,wCMoltpt6dQq2lzb-Vj7EQ

We ordered sour cream to go along but we didn't use it cause everything was amazing by itself. They were amazing!! Everything tastes homemade and made very well, you can tell they make their food with love and truly enjoy what they do. The owners are absolutely amazing, they are from Poland and are a total joy to talk to. The place is clean and the food was very fresh. I will return and highly highly recommend this place to anyone who loves homemade food and just wants something different. And I heard they will be extending their hours in the evening as well.",XZg_60BabYR1t2aGqN10PQ,1,0,5,2rXLoeRk_RGbg7Obc7iyTA
5391065,2018-01-27,1,XaRLRVEAOwxQjgF1_iU_jQ,"I am guessing that with these reviews.. the owners must have friends who work within the indoor swapmeet giving generous reviews.
We ordered the kielbasa sub, 9 pierogis which were all potato, onion, and we tried the two piece stuffed cabbage. 
Pierogis were super generic and lacked the sautéed onions and butter that is typical. They were most likely frozen and then pan fried. 
Stuffed cabbage was definitely frozen as the plate contained water under the thawed looking tomato sauce. 
Kielbasa sub was fair but the sauerkraut could have been more flavorful. 
The food was very bland and lacked the homemade feel that they show on signs. 
Now if I am wrong about any of this being microwaved and it really is homemade.. someone dropped the ball on taste and quality that I grew up on in a polish family.",bX0ZrqsZ6ZyQ_Xgxvo9-Qg,0,0,2,x49hECVKhdMZHL1ZnlElbQ

We ordered the potato and cheese pierogi with Carmalized onions and fried. The pierogi had a sour taste to it. My daughter would only eat one. It wasn't the dough but the actual filling. Brought home the left overs and my son spit it out as well. I'm assuming they used cottage cheese which is more Russian way then other cheese. Disappointed but will stick to the ones we get at glaziers super market.,fTgEneFEeQGmuK0gBetuZQ,0,0,3,FYKI8v1Ex3mtbuWrTA6SUw

The food is so delicious.  The owner is a delightful woman who took the time to explain all of the different menu items and correct my boyfriend's pronunciation of some popular Polish last names.

We had the mixed combo plate of perogies, and maybe it's because I'm from the desert Southwest, but I thought the jalapeno and cheese was probably my favorite.  We will definitely be back!

For those with a sweet tooth, try the cheesecake -- it's creamy without being overly sweet.",shBEMbvhDv2spo1o4J29Yg,2,0,5,qvjQ3i6GVrPtJXnU_dpOyw
