We order a carry out order and found a long strand of hair embedded inside between the meat and the bread, which was awfully disgusting. We have to spend extra time in driving back to the location for an explanation from the store manager name Stephen. We spoke to Stephen regarding our order and he did not try to solve this issue and simply tell an associate to make us another sub (the SAME ASSOCIATE who probably DROPPED  LONG CURLY HAIR in our sub in the first place!!). We felt unwelcome for showing him our issue on the order, His reaction showed that it has happened before and he was not surprise at all. We did not receive a formal apology from him or his associates. He was giving us bad attitudes and facial expressions, it was very disrespectful. We expect a store manager to be properly train to handle and resolve issues, but his actions showed that he does not care for his customers or opinions in improving food hygiene for this store location.  I believe his overall customer service was extremely dissatisfying. Our only reason for going back to the store was to receive an apology and explanation, not simply remaking our original order. He did not take the time to look at the sub and try to hide his mistake. At the end, we refuse his offer and got a refund. Before this first time visit, we heard great reviews and recommendations about Firehouse Sub; therefore, we did look forward to eat a high quality sub at Firehouse. However, we did not see any of the ""great reviews"" from our first visit. It was a great disappoint!",0yLsl0aRWOc-pkii3-Lzeg,1,0,1,4SVyOXe6sObWLNSQIUzJkA

I came in for my free birthday sub which upset him and he told me I had to be a reward member and download the app to discourage me from eating here. I downloaded the app, got my free sub, plus purchased another. My sub came with no vegetables. Nor did they ask if I wanted any. When my sub came out with just meat and sauce I asked the girl who took my order about vegetables. I explained I didn't know how this place worked and asked if I could get some vegetables on the side. Again the owner got annoyed that I even asked. I told him he was not friendly to me nor his employees who were clearly afraid of him and walking on eggshells. I also told him I got a free sub, but I also bought one putting money into his franchise. Of course, he didn't care.

As I was asking my stomach what it wants and also being careful not to consume anything salty due to hereditary blood pressure problems, I come across this joint....again.
Then my taste buds took over and forgot everything else besides salivating over and devouring the Smoked House Beef and Cheddar Brisket. I then Grabbed!! the 100% Pain sauce and started attacking this sandwich. As I was murdering it, I remember telling my self ""man! this is a good way to fill the void"" and at the same time the 100%pain sauce was making all my mucus membrane come out places where I never knew it could. 
I'm sure theres lots of other sandwiches thats good but everyone should atleast try the 100%pain sauce. After trying the sauce, ill guarantee youll be able to handle any other spicy food out there.

I ordered the ""Italian"" thinking it would taste like the Italian subs on the East Coast, New Jersey.  Anyway, the person taking my order asked me ""would you like everything on it"" my answer yes, thinking lettuce, tomato, onions, oregano, oil, and vinegar - that's it.  She said everything - Mayo, Mustard, oil, ....  I responded - Hell no? No mustard no mayo - not on an Italian.  I should have stopped there and left.  Anyway, they gave me their version of Italian - -- I can't even begin to say how disappointed I was.  The first bite was just God awful - like someone poured sweet sauce all over the sandwich - WTF - they used sweet vinegarette dressing, no oil  & white vinegar, no oregano, no cappicolla instead Virginia Ham, and artificial pepperoni instead of Genoa Salami.  The bread was soft and poofy - had no substance.  This was one sorry sub and even sorrier customer.  Never again.

It is a quick drive from neighboring housing developments for a quick hot or cold sandwich, but it does not taste like a typical sandwich.

I ordered the BBQ brisket & cheddar sandwich on a white bun; wheat buns are also available. For an extra $2, you can get a drink and chips. The sandwich was well toasted, with the brisket soft and flavorful. It is more of a fast food sandwich shop, but not like Subway. When you place your order, the cashier will take down your name and call it out when it is ready, bringing it to your table if you are eating in. It is decorated with all sorts of firefighter related memorabilia, giving the place is comfy feel.

I started going to Firehouse Subs after being fed up with Subway for the last time (Subway=poor service at nearly every location, unpredictable quality). I couldn't ask for more polite cashiers and staff. They all appear to be very eager to please. I guess you could say I'm boring because I've only ever ordered one item from their menu, which is the Hook & Ladder sandwich. Also, if you like soft drinks, they have one of those really cool fountain drink machines with over 150 flavors. If you're a fan of hot sauce, they have about 30 to choose from.

The decor is detailed and the restaurant always seems to be clean. My only suggestion would be to put something else on TV besides sports but I guess that's the main type of customer that Firehouse attracts. It's not enough to keep me away, though.

I ordered the medium brisket combo and honestly it tasted great. I finished the first half and picked up the second half when my wife pointed out there was a human hair that had been resting under the sandwich...left there presumably by the person who made the sandwich.

When I returned the sandwich to the counter I noted that the hair most likely came from the manager as she had long dark hair and was not wearing a hat, visor or hair net as required by law. She offered to remake my sandwich and became irritated when I asked her to have someone else make it. I then pointed out her health code violation and she replied by telling me she's not required to wear anything on her head. 

NRS 2-402.11 (A) 
Except as provided in Â¶ (B) of this section, food handlers shall wear hair restraints such as hats, hair coverings or nets, beard restraints, and clothing that covers body hair, that are designed and worn to effectively keep their hair from contacting exposed food; clean equipment, utensils, and linens; and unwrapped single-service and single-use articles.

(B) This section does not apply to food employees such as counter staff who only serve beverages and wrapped or packaged foods, hostesses, and wait staff if they present a minimal risk of contaminating exposed food; clean equipment, utensils, and linens; and unwrapped single-service and single-use articles.

Now I understand MAYBE she thinks she's exempt under sub section B so I took the trouble of looking up the definition of a Food Handler as described by the Nevada Revised Statute and found the following:

NRS 446.030 ""Food Handler"" Defined

Note: The 2010 Regulations Governing the Sanitation of Food Establishments defines food as raw, cooked or processed edible substance, ice, beverage or an ingredient used, or intended for use or for sale, in whole or in part for human consumption, or chewing gum.

""Food handler"" means any person employed in or operating a food establishment, whether that person is an employer, employee or other natural person, who handles, stores, transports, prepares, manufactures, serves or sells food, or who comes in contact with eating or cooking utensils or other equipment used in the handling, preparation, manufacture, service or sale of food.

The term does not include a person who:
Only handles, stores, transports, sells or otherwise comes in contact with food that is sealed and packaged for sale directly to the consumer;

If the food is potentially hazardous food, handles the food only occasionally and incidentally to his responsibilities or employment, and such handling is not part of his regularly scheduled responsibilities or employment; or 

Is providing services as a cashier, salesperson, stock clerk, warehouse or dockworker, delivery person or maintenance staff or providing services in a similar position with limited food-handling responsibility. [Part 1:116:1943; 1943 NCL Â§ 5319]--(NRS A 1969, 803; 2001, 1505; 2003, 595; 2007, 2175)

Bottom line - YOU MADE MY SANDWICH - YOU ARE A FOOD HANDLER - AND THE LAW APPLIES TO YOU.

As if contaminating my sandwich by violating health code wasn't bad enough, following up by lying about it makes it worse, not to mention the other employee who was openly eating in the food prep area while he observed our conversation, and the employee who replaced my sandwich not washing his hands in between changing gloves...Three health code violations in plain view in a matter of a couple minutes. Imagine how many more violations there are to be found here. 

I left my car in the parking lot and came back later after shopping. Looking in the front window I could clearly see another blonde employee making sandwiches without any hair restraint.

Enjoy your hair sandwiches if you eat here. That should be their new motto.

I'm contemplating a call to the health inspector, maybe they can get these employees sorted out because either they are unaware of proper food handling/serving methods or they just don't care. Either way my health is more important. I will NEVER visit this location again.",wJHWpXEoo4B_A6iaQ1-Z8Q,2,1,1,BbHp8sbRjpXKlTkWPIxR1Q

I had been to the Rainbow location before - and well, not just for the cool soda machine, but my sandwich was excellent - service was excellent. OK ... so, back to this BRAND NEW Durango location: sandwich - very good. staff - very good and accommodating with our special request. HOWEVER, this store is DIRTY! Maybe it was the end of the night, maybe a little of the dirt and crumbs were because of that, but there was a lot that was old. Also, on the table that holds the napkins and silverware - there was a bucket with wet towels, soaking in a cleaning solution - just sitting out in a service area.

Firehouse Subs is also known for their selection of hot sauces. They had a huge selection, including their signature sauce. Every bottle I opened to try had a crusty, dried up ring around the pour area. In otherwords, they never wipe down these bottles. Discusting.

Lastly, I had not noticed the mural on the wall until I read the previous review. This is VERY disturbing! I wish I had taken a picture of it. It is a yellow Clark County Fire Truck - a fireman holding a hose, and - wait for it ... water coming out at full force at a fox. The poor fox's body was bent in half from the force of the water! I am sure it was meant to be fun, however (and this is coming from someone who does not get easily offended), this was straight up cruelty.

I settled on getting the Firehouse Hero sub - Premium roast beef, smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, and melted provolone. It was a good sandwich and I got it with the combo (chips and a drink). The soda machine is pretty cool as well with your opportunity to customize your soda as you want.

I've always thought the service here was horrible, but today inspired me to finally write a review. A family was eating, and a child of no more than 2 spilled a drink as I was ordering. The person ringing me up was about to get off, and complained that she had to clean up the floor within my earshot. I thought this very unprofessional.

I will blame it on experience, or lack of it. Either way it was a pleasant lunch, and I'm willing to give the staff a second chance.

I wanted to go to Teriyaki Madness because it's one of my favorite lunch spots in the southwest. 

We go in and greeted by sandwich makers with this tone in their voice that sounded like they've been slaving away for hours. 
Asking us how we are doing but facing the chip rack is a little strange. At least make eye contact, what if I was a celebrity or something!! Jk


Our order came up, we ended up getting over charged for an extra sandwich. It was annoying and we didn't realize it until we were waiting that we just paid $25. We could have a nice 2 for $20 at chilis for that...

Anyway, they came out with the right sandwich and out change for the refund but it was just really bad quality for the amount of time and (lack of) effort put into the food. 
The quality was just not there. I was considering going to glaziers and getting my lunch meat special (1/2 lb meat&1/2 lb cheese) which would come out cheaper than a meal here

You take orders and call customers by their 1st names yet you only do veterans discounts for people in uniform...

I understand that not everyone does military/vet discounts and don't really expect it but the ""only in uniform"" stipulation made me think of all those I served with that may frequent your establishment with their families and not get the discount cause they are not in uniform.

A Fire Fighter certainly doesn't stop being a firefighter out of uniform, I doubt he or she would just walk by a burning house.

So how does it make sense to say a military member only gets the military discount when in uniform...the military member is on call 24/7....
