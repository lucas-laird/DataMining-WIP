During one visit there was as many as 4 bums INSIDE the restaurant at one time. I understand that the homeless people are not the fault of the Jack in the box, but the slow service is. I want to get my food and get out before some nasty bum begs me for money. Why does it take 10 minutes to make small curly fries?",RKSFq0hVVqNrT7MYXzjSIw,1,0,2,Yk3H4X-AbBMDC-6oaCLRPw

I was coming home late the other night, and figured a grilled cheese sandy from Jack in the box was the right move to make, so I pulled up to the drive thru.  

The man taking my order was cheery, pleasant, and fun.  His enthusiasm was refreshing and sincere.  When I pulled up to the window he asked how I was tonight, and we began chatting about crazy things he saw that night working the window.  (Drive-thru flashers are apparently ""in"" right now)

I can't give a fast food place 5 stars, but the service here is 5 star caliber.  It's so refreshing to meet someone who loves their job, or at least, does it with sincerity and enthusiasm.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,1,1,4,CHKwBPBkODTEYmbDUE0hGA

3140183,2014-07-18,0,duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ,Jack In the box hands down is the best after the club food lol. I'm so glad they brought back the bacon cheddar potatoe wedges! This location on rainbow isn't quite my favorite location I prefer the one on Flamingo and Durango or even the one up on Ft.Apache and Tropicana! Reason being is the late night crew that works tends to be not only slow but rude! Not a great combo when you are trying to sober up after a hard night of partying! What can I expect though from a fast food place other than the greasy unhealthy food that I will not continue to stop eating lol!

The manager Josh is very friendly, remembers me every time i see him and is always very accommodating. I love the chicken fajita pita, for the illusion of eating healthy because it's grilled chicken ;)  If you are out late and looking for a meal before your last stop Jack in the Box is not a bad choice!",C6VK9A_gg-3iMFnlNPUHWw,0,0,4,3bnRGprq7y2u9Ckpet2Lbw
3903787,2017-09-10,1,duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ,Well up until this point the food for me has always been good. But towards the end of eating my supreme croissant sandwich I find a hair in my food. OMG nothing like feeling sick to your stomach now from eating.  Then well my brothers finishing his sandwich he finds an eggshell in his. WTHeck..Even though the service was great in the drive-through and everything was fine and it always has been up until this point. Who's not wearing their hair net and being careful when they're making your food. Well I guess it will be a while before I go back to this Jack-in-the-Box. Bummed because it's so close to the house and the food has always been great. I know things happen and everyone deserves a break but I just can't imagine going back for a while. Not sure who they have cooking back there and putting sandwiches together but hopefully they start wearing a hairnet an is being more careful when making your food looking for eggshells and hair.. I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because the service was fast today an good. BUT Guess it's back to McDonald's breakfast sandwiches for a while when it's not a cooking breakfast day.,oMFeTt2Ry4m2ZIcgKKqx0A,4,0,2,420xhLPkT4-QI9wBUy-EvA

Don't believe me? Well, I've seen hell like you've never imagine. I've worked with these crews for a  short period of time...

Overload Dishes in the back...not washing it properly (containers still have soap)
Ice berg lettuce - not washing the lettuce appropriately.                                           (Keep in mind that produce is a raw product, grown in dirt) small pieces of dirt and grit fall.
Not washing their hand...
A bunch of (swing shift) stubborn kids...
More on playing than working...

Crews and Team Leaders that used to work there were gone. Handling the food strictly and know who their Boss is .....Afraid to get fired and so doing their job professionally and appropriatly.

These fuckers are not afraid to get their ass fired and so not giving a fuck handling the food that you put it in to your mouth...

5074441,2012-06-13,0,duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ,"I enjoy Jack in the Box. Probably too much for my own good. However, I will not be stopping at this location again, which is unfortunate as its the only one along my commute. I put my order in via the self ordering machine (love them!) And the gentleman before me ordered pretty much the same thing I did and had his food in hand within about 4 minutes. However, I got the wildcard of some guy walking in and ordering the same thing as me (the tacos are quite popular). Because he was 'in a rush' he got MY tacos and I got to wait a total of 11 minutes to receive my order. In no business is this okay. I guess if I do come back it'll be when I am 'in a rush' so I, too, can steal someone else'a food. The order was right and the place was clean. That's what the second star is about. The fact that I had to finish the rest of my bus/walk commute smelling of tacos and potato wedges was not the business.",XBxmubKfzh3pkDHry6kskw,0,0,2,i-ht8naB1TeTyGO0vA_0zw

5284177,2010-11-15,3,duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ,"I infrequently go to Jack in the Box. 

Don't get me wrong; Jack in the Box makes great burgers, sandwiches and sides.

But the only time I'll go to Jack's is in the wintertime, in which they featured the Pumpkin Pie Milkshake and Eggnog Milkshake. And I was craving for the Eggnog Milkshake after my dinner. 

Another piece of technology I don't see back home is the kiosk booth to place your order for your food. As a substitute of seeing the cashier, you input what you want and how you want your food(s) and/or drink(s) customized. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ?select=MkeNe_5lsNK9CkM4mqZMKg

And the large $2.99 seasonal milkshake is programmed in the machine. You can even request for extra whipped cream and extra maraschino cherry as one many options. I slide my Visa to pay for my treat and I get my receipt with the order number. 

My milkshake: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ?select=ymC0PFMYFXXeOjZgd5QH9w

After a few minutes, the clerk yelled out my number and I finally got my milkshake. 

One sip of the thick seasonal milkshake, I was instantly in the holiday spirit.

5846624,2017-12-31,5,duCjWA3EBSA-ox5LTcXbwQ,"A little out of my way, but better than the other two locations near me. It's just another typical fast food joint. 

But the only thing that sets them aside from the others, is the service and the fact that they don't mess my order up. It's happened once or twice but very minor and they are quick to fix it. I can be very picky and make changes to almost everything I order.

With it being fast food, I don't expect much. They can get busy but they are pretty quick and the food actually looks good.",3ajSADFnm71e_Zcip_igWQ,6,6,3,olal564g2ppdflBa6EKF0g
