Only problem was I ordered more than I could eat.  For the price, I expected much smaller portions but the bacon burger was huge and came with a ton of fries.  That was more than enough for my meal but adding the pizza was going overboard. It was so good that I tried my best to finish it all.  Oh well, the pizza will be a great leftover snack.

We received a flyer today for this place and decided to try it out. Terrible decision! We just wasted $35 on mediocre food.

We ordered an 18"" Supreme Pizza, a Patty Melt and Fried Mushrooms. The pizza was very burnt and had to be sawed through with a steak knife just to cut and was painful to chew. We ended up having to removed the cheese and toppings just to eat it and leave the breading behind.

The Patty Melt came on a sub roll rather than on Rye and there was little meat. Not to mention, the fries that were supposed to come with it didn't. 

The fried mushrooms were ho-hum and did not come with dipping sauce as they should have.

I WOULD NOT recommend wasting your money on this place unless you prefer disappointment.",pk4kVtaCAfhyr7QBpQnRAw,0,0,2,VX7CKEXivGxk5jAbz5HtAQ

1692142,2013-12-20,0,45513UgSlMqWV_yAPVkXrg,"Verona Pizza was the pick for lunch in the lab today because a pamphlet was thrown in the crack of the door of a friend's apartment.. 

We ordered a large pizza topped with just pineapple (a favorite of a girl in our lab, who's vegetarian), an order of chicken wings spiced medium, and a 2-liter of soda (Sierra Mist). When I arrived to pick up the order, we were greeted by a gentleman who told us that he had just called Tim (the guy who placed the order) to let him know it was done- he didn't want to take it out of the oven and let the food get cold. ""Cool!"" I thought, as I paid the man and picked up our food, which came out to about $28. So while we were carefully juggling all the food, he asked us where we worked and asked us to hand out some menus and call him after our meal to let him know how everything was. They get an A in guest service, I really appreciate when an owner cares about the guest, but the food wasn't all that special.

Pizza: The dough wasn't that bad, but the sauce was lackluster. Unfortunately, bland sauce typically means bland pizza. Cheese was adequate and there was plenty of pineapple on the pizza. It was nothing to write home about, but it wasn't terrible either. I don't know that I would come here for their $3.99 2 slice pizza special as others have come for, since I imagine that re-heated ordinary pizza is probably worse. 

Wings: The wings weren't bad. There was no spice to them at all, and they were overcooked a bit (I think the restaurant probably par-cooks them before then refries them to order to make sure everything is cooked). Although I appreciate them taking the time in serving fully cooked chicken, they would definitely be better if they were cooked completely to order. There was many more wings than I had expected, although they were small. One more bone to pick, if I must, there weren't any carrots or celery served with the wings. :(

THE RANCH HERE IS DELICIOUS!! It probably knocked the wings up from 2.5 stars to 3. 

Overall, it wouldn't be my first pick for pizza. HOWEVER, since the place is right across the street from UNLV, I imagine we will be ordering from here at least once more. I plan on calling the manager/owner tomorrow and letting him know how lunch was. Who knows, maybe they'll impress me next time. :)",lluNN1aQlFN7NQQ2BxFBUQ,3,1,3,OmSxXv6v7fvEP_HyUwkltQ

You got that great customer service by the manager, Mo, combined with super speedy delivery by the driver, Tim. This team rocks! 

But, of course the real star of the show is the food!
My staple dish is the Spinach Stromboli. What were talkin about here is well baked dough seasoned down to a science stuffed with fresh spinach, onions, fresh garlic, and loads of feta cheese juiced around in olive oil. Mo makes the calzone himself. And, it is gooood.  The portion is huge and the fresh tomato sauce is homemade.  For $8 you cant find a better deal in town. And, especially not delivered to your front door at such a low price. 

Tim, the delivery driver is fast. 
Now, this is to be expected. But, what came as an unexpected surprise to me was how clean and polite he was. His car was very clean and neat. Nobody wants food from a dirty vehicle. And, his personal appearance and demeanor were both professional and groomed. He was very polite.  It is a genuine pleasure to give him 20%+ gratuity every time he delivers to us.

So I kinda waited around before deciding to leave my folks and walk down flamingo and see what there was to eat cheap. I was starving haven't eaten since breakfasts. Busted out the yelp app and saw a donuts place nearby.  Walked towards the donut shop then changed my mine. Ended up winging it and just walked, passed Roy's and saw 9091. Ok let's do this. Aww closed. Ok what else was there, I didn't want to walk back without anything. Walked some more towards jack in a box, didn't really want to settle for them and hoped there was something on the way. A message place, a pizza place looked like they were closed, a nice dressed restaurant skipped it  i was in  shorts and slippers, walked a little more then turned around to see if the pizza place was open. Ahh Verona Pizza, a girl was cleaning the floors, chairs were up, has to be closed nope they were open. A relief, saw the $3.99 for 2 slices of cheese pizza  and a soda and got it after checking out the menu.  Sat outside, enjoyed the full moon, cool night, pizza slices and soda, fast and friendly service. Pizza was very good, made like NY style but with a better tasting dough, thinner crispy edible crust, light and not oily or greasy which helps a lot because it wasn't a sloppy and saggy mess. The owner or at least what looked like the owner seemed cool too he spotted me the tax cause I only had $4 cash and my card.  The rest of their menu was looked pretty good and at a good price, definitely coming back. 12 wings and a soda for around 6 bucks.

My night here wasn't actually over with the food, it is again Vegas on a Saturday night. During my meal, a guy asked me to use my phone, no problem looked like a local boy from Hawaii probs UNLV student who was stressing cause his friends left um there. Hawaii people can usually spot each other out and always show that aloha when needed. But if he wen dig wit my phone, my slippaz was off and ready fo run lol. Later on there was a customer who walked out of Verona swinging his carry-out pizza box in all kinds of direction and the owner looking guy ran out and nicely scolded him and told him that he was gonna mess his pizza up, probably first time having a pizza in a box lol. Also when I was about done there a guy who was walking back and forth, in and out of Verona, across the parking lot, who I thought was a regular customer waiting for pizza. But then he stood by the entrances 10 feet from me, quiatly speaking to himself, then went all out talking to himself swing his arms, shaking his pocket filled with coins, sounded like he was bragging about how much coins he had. I dunno I was already done and bailed. Pretty good night so far enjoyed my pizza and energized myself. Lol sounds more like a Facebook update then a review but I figured share my experience.

Add they have sitting indoors and outdoots. And a big menu that includes, pizzas, salads, calzones/stromboli, sandwiches, and more. Open til 2am Fri and Sat, 12 am Sun-Thurs.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,1,0,4,p4DsB0zA0Ut19G0p9z-GKA

I ordered a medium peperoni pizza to be delivered to my hotel room.  It only took 25 minutes and only cost $11.00.

Some slices had none. And it tastes like a frozen pizza. Not good.

The crust tasted like cardboard, the sauce had no flavor, and all of the toppings, which there really weren't very many toppings to begin with, were canned and gross! Seriously this is Las Vegas, how can this place stay in business? If I could figure out how to give this place 0 stars I totally would! I seriously want my money back because we are still hungry! The pizza was completely inedible and we are so disappointed.",6uJY3KLV7qHodFATKxvHsg,1,0,1,7HE1Tl0ZQAXCTIjEoLZZ0A
