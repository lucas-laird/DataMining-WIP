1268710,2016-03-24,1,7SLZwNRhc2bpUXQXLypTTg,I'd have to say this has got to be the worst location! service sucks I love BK and the whoppers so I go often every time I choose this location they mess up my order I get the same thing every time whopper not tomatoes onions or pickles not once in the last 5 times going has it been made right with out having to wait for no reason 5 mins to get a burger when there's no one in front of me is awful! And then today I had my little 4 year old daughter with me and so we were grabbing a bite on the way out of town order my usual and her a nuggets kid meal 5 mins out of town she tell me she's done with her fries but that there's no nuggets in the bag!!! Way to go Burger King thanks for charging me for a kids meal only to have my daughter star in cause she only had half a thing of fries! Needless to say it upset me a lot enough that I felt the need to call to talk to manager and let them no it was awful experience just to find the phone rings no one ever answers in the 9 times I've called and if you let it ring long enough you will get the fax machine! I'm so unhappy with how things turned out today I'll go out of my way to avoid going back to Burger King let alone this pitiful location! It's sad when you can't even get ahold of management or anyone for that matter to let them no how poorly they are doing and to give them the chance to fix there mistakes this time let alone the previous 5 times in the past 2 weeks alone!!!!! I hope the manager at this location actually reads there reviews feel free to contact me so I can tell you what I really think of your staff!,UNQ6CM76SDETccVhf9zWXQ,1,0,1,CCuYIfg_8nZ1wetECbqrkg
1287397,2014-12-11,0,7SLZwNRhc2bpUXQXLypTTg,"I'm pretty surprised by the negative reviews on here... I go here quite a bit and I've never had any major issues like the other customers are having.

Most of the time the food is fresh and tasty but there has been the occasional sandwich that was light on ketchup/mayo.

The biggest issue I've had with this location is when I ordered an Icee and they overfilled it and shoved it into my window and got it all over my car. Luckily none got in the interior but I didn't even get an apology.",QGxqWdgZLPzdzu30DhhDog,0,0,3,qTGq6HW3faEfPVol6Lcq3A

2008199,2014-08-18,1,7SLZwNRhc2bpUXQXLypTTg,"Wish I could give it 0 stars!!!!! We have been here numerous times and every time it worst than the last. This last time was the last straw. We WILL NOT be eating there anymore!

The play place room is RIDICULOUSLY scorching hot! I am in a wheelchair and have health issues. So a hot room like this makes me sick! Also my daughter almost threw up her food. So we had to pack up our food and leave earlier than we wanted to. We asked the staff if they could turn on the A/C, and their response was that they tried to tell the owners the AC was broken and they wouldn't fix it... Um okay. Not a good business move when you have a business in Las Vegas!!!

Every time I get a breakfast sandwich from here it is burnt! So annoying! There is no excuse for the cooks to deliberately wrap up a Burt sandwich and send it out. PA-Lease! Obviously you don't give a crap! 

Also every time we went through the drive thru, the person taking the order did to know the menu and didn't know how to take an order. We had to repeat ourselves countless times, and not only did we wait in the drive thru for over 20 min, when we got our order it was wrong. 

PLEASE, If you're wanting a whopper go to a different BK! This place sucks!",PJFMuTWajLGBgvUQzw0hHg,0,0,1,C4x0AKDPVfhsBaD2HGn70g

3889452,2018-04-30,0,7SLZwNRhc2bpUXQXLypTTg,"This is the most conveniently located Burger King to where I live. It's right next to the Lowe's plaza where I frequently go to shop for needed household items.

After stopping at Lowe's, this is a good place to pick up a quick bite to eat - currently the two for $6.00 special (chicken sandwich or Whopper) is a worthwhile option.

This Burger King used to have extremely slow and truly poor service not too long ago. However, my diligently filling out and complaining when submitting the provided online customer surveys at checkout appears to have worked wonders. Service is now first rate!

Regarding the question of which do you prefer - Burger King or McDonald's - I am much more a Whopper than a Big Mac person. I really can't remember the last time that I went to Mickey D's. It's been years baby.",1aJni3g7tN1ikyCxIHnmtg,0,0,4,ZAFAxOBmrmKAkhYKK5HvSA
4142594,2014-04-21,9,7SLZwNRhc2bpUXQXLypTTg,"Can anyone say, ""Hot Mess?"" This location is a disaster.  I'm not sure what was going on when we popped in for lunch.  I'm actually having a hard time thinking of nice stuff to say in this review, which is never a good thing.  Here are my notes on what needs some serious help at this location!

1. Get more staff! I was there shortly after the main lunch rush (12:45pm) and the place seemed really understaffed for the crowd.  There was only one person talking the in person orders and she was handling the drive thru and pick up window as well.  There was a lady in front of me when I walked in who had been waiting for who knows how long.  We waited for another 5 minutes before being acknowledged.   By this time, there was about 5 people in line behind me. I really only saw 4 people working while I waited.

2. Hire happier people.  I get it, you are at work and stressed out because it is busy, but you don't need to take it out on me! I didn't complain about the wait, I was polite, and i even tried to order something super easy.  Being snapped at is not pleasant, especially when I am being nice.  I felt bad for the employees until i got fussed at!  Geez Louise!

3. Clean up the place, will ya? The area where you get your soda was a mess.  There was spilled drinks and melting ice all over the place.  I know people are slobs, but that means you need to have someone clean up the area from time to time.  There was also straw wrappers all over the place and spilled ketchup near the ketchup pump area.  It was hard to find a clean place to put my tray down to get the items I needed.

4. The playground is super lacking.  First off, it is really small.  Second, it was like an oven in there.  It seemed like very little, if any air was being circulated around in there.  Third, it is definitely made for bigger kids.  The steps in the climbing area were too big for my super tall 2 year old to climb.  She was so sad in there because she couldn't play with the other kids, which is the whole reason we came here!

I can say that the food here was pretty much on par with other BKs, it just took FOREVER to come out.

Needless to say I won't be back to this Burger King any time too soon.  And please listen to my warning if you go during lunch time, otherwise you will be there a LOOOOONG time.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,8,7,1,jw4hGDY_ouYB3R8e2gUUIw

5554105,2015-06-26,3,7SLZwNRhc2bpUXQXLypTTg,"I ordered a chicken sandwich, they asked if I wanted cheese so I said sure.  They charged me extra for the cheese and then when I got my sandwich there was no cheese at all on it.  THEN I wanted a diet coke with my meal and they give it me. It tasted awful!  I asked the lady at the window if this was diet coke she gave me and she yes and disappeared before I could tell her it was bad.  I had to pull around front and wait because my food wasn't ready.  When she finally brought me the food, I told her she might want to check their diet coke because it tastes awful and she said ""yeah they just told me"" and walked off.  No ""do you need another drink"" or ""can get you something different."" Nope, just left me with a gross diet coke that would go straight in the garbage and charged me for cheese that they didn't add.  Won't go back.",SM2Z-BDWSO821pbBNleNoA,1,1,1,VMv6zbajHb_Mg9R5yz4YXg
