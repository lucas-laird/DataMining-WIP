153055,2012-09-05,0,FevycwulBfHEZt77dv2EyA,"I live right around the corner from this location and I have been here several times since they reopened. They had been closed for more than a year and I honestly didn't think they were going to come back again, but I'm really glad they did. 

From what I understand the owner sold this place & now he bought it back and it seems much improved since their reopening. I had been here once with my gf prior to their remodeling and everything seems much improved. 

I can only comment on the bar area and I've never dined in for dinner, which is why I only can give 4 stars. I'm looking forward to eating dinner there one of these nights but I usually just go into the bar to have drinks, eat small apps and play video keno. 

They are open 24/7 and i usually go in during the swing shift or late night. I've always had a really great time and the bartenders are really fun and personable which makes me feel happy about going here. I've tried their clams with both white and red sauce as well as the tiramisu. I love everything I've had so far--the food is very flavorful which is the way I like it. The broth for the clams is very savory and garlicly which is the way I love my food to taste. The tiramisu was sweet, but not overly so with a strong espresso & cocoa flavor...just the way i love it. 

The thing that keeps me coming back is the service. The people who work here are very down to earth and easy going which is important to me and keeps me coming back. 

They have a very interesting set up also where the bar is completely enclosed and the dining room seating is around it. I suppose this makes it possible for smokers to smoke in the bar area without disturbing the diners. I'm not a regular smoker so this isn't a big deal for me but I guess it allows smokers to be comfortable in the bar without disturbing the diners. 

I will update again once I go in for a complete dinner. I have a feeling I will be happy and will be able to add another star for a total of 5 stars. 

If you live around here and have been thinking about going in, give them a try. I am a big fan. I can even walk home!",WfezMJ42_X_H-Dh_NYyjNg,0,0,4,buxpJKTKHEYT3O8TW85ukA
286310,2010-04-29,1,FevycwulBfHEZt77dv2EyA,"Went on a weeknight with my sister, her husband and my nephew. There were only two other tables of two going. 

Service was awful, waited about 10 minutes until someone actually took the drink order. 

When I ordered, I got the meatball sub where the meatballs are so big, you cant eat it with your hands, you have to use a fork and knife. Well, when i came out, it was a full loaf of bread with 4 meats that weren't much bigger than a golf ball. They put so much sauce on it, the bread was soggy and the meatballs were undercooked. 

I would give them a 1, but the waitress didn't mind putting juice in my nephews bottle and the chicken fingers were good. 

I may have picked a bad day to go, but I think service and quality of food should be great Monday thru Sunday.",ZlDBSzKymLIDJ0YTr6kIeA,1,1,2,_Db46b9S3BWLr0r8xNasxQ

The waiter actually lied to us and I caught him and he knows I caught him! Everything was fine. Food was pretty good and my party and I even discussed coming back because we thought the food was good. While waiting for our food we asked for more bread. Alfredo, our waiter barely acknowledged our request but we knew he heard us. We waited and the bread never came. Our food arrives and we ask for the bread again. He barely acknowledges us again. Still no bread. We're almost done eating. Alfredo comes and says bread is being freshly made and will be about 10 minutes. We say fine. A few minutes later I catch Alfredo surreptitiously, rushing by with a basket of bread to another table! Unbelievable! Then he comes back to our table, without bread, mind you, and asks if we need anything else. I ask what the deal with the bread is and he says, of course, he'll bring it right away! I say never mind, just bring the check... I did call the GM to make her aware of what happened but we will never be going back there. Again, food was good.

The service was excellent. The food prices were average. The portions were decent sized but the food was good. I ordered the lasagna and it meaty and just enough cheese and sauce, It wasn't busy in there, and the waitress was chatty and it didn't mind at all.

Afterwards I decided to go down to the bar and have a couple of drinks and watch a baseball game. the bartender was friendly and we were talking about different teams. Overall I would go back there again!",hnG8bXruJDQGcRjVcURE4Q,0,0,4,wGmp-lB2yxYUNQ2dAerSww

1638856,2012-12-23,1,FevycwulBfHEZt77dv2EyA,Went there for lunch...hardly anyone in the place. Ask the waitress if she think we'd beable to get in and out and she replied yes. Placed our order  but it took almost 30 minutes. Finally our food comes out. I had the meatball sandwich and salad. It hardly had any sauce which was so light in color as if they ran out of tomatoes or something. Anyway I tasted a piece of the meatball and it was flavorless and mushy. I poured extra sauce hoping I could get pass the mushiness but I couldn't take a 3rd bite of that rolled up ball of pate. Tried the salad and it was wiltered. I couldn't eat any of it. Disappointed as I was so hungry. The other table of  customers had to get up to find the server as well as we did but instead got the busboy. In turn I told him the meatballs were mushy and the lettuce was wiltered...he did nothing but argue with me as if that would make it better. Wtf...this place is terrible now and it was just as bad before they were shut down.  No more chances at carmines. I should've went to subway for a $2 meatball sandwich.,GX_umbMasV-bIqN6669bBA,1,1,1,wRMgDvpjROhifNL7VOjJyw

1892262,2010-05-15,3,FevycwulBfHEZt77dv2EyA,"I came here because its very close to my work, and I had heard an ad for it on the radio claiming, ""grandmothers Italian cooking,"" or something along the lines of that.  When I pulled up I remember thinking to myself, ""Geez, I hope this isn't incredibly over-priced crappy bar food.""

It was.

Walking inside all I could hear was the announcements of a horse race, and a commercial for Prostate disorder...yumm!!

After seating us, our waiter introduced himself as Alfredo.

Immediately I looked on the menu for Fettuccine Alfredo, his name made me crave it, lol.  Was it on there? Nope. I went in hoping to get some kind of yummy Italian dish, but after looking at the menu I could tell it wasn't going to happen. 

My dear friend and I decided that nothing really caught our eye, and decided to just split the vegetarian pizza.  It was bland, and the artichoke hearts tasted horrible, I gagged on a bite of them. I gagged on a $10.00 individual pizza. For the service and the quality of the food, $10.00 should have been the price for 2 meals. Ugh, I will not be returning.

Heres what it comes down to: crappy decor, crappy atmosphere, (unless you like to watch and listen to nothing but sports, which is understandable since it is a bar) crappy service, crappy pizza, crappy prices. Crappy lunch. :/.",v5xxch_TbSV9ZTxHkd6jHQ,2,1,1,DqV7n5NgI9Dln00nbfxygA

Connie (one of the family owners/managers) is always checking on everything and on all the customers which I always enjoy seeing in any business 

Food is delicious, pasta is always cooked perfectly al dente. Greek salad is AMAZING, I don't know what they put in their dressing but yum. Shrimp on a stone appetizer, I've never seen anywhere else and it's tasty. They have a wide variety of options on their menu from bar food to Italian & they will make pretty much anything you want if it's possible. They have a good variety of beers (bottles & draft) which is great, plus plenty of TVs for game watching!

3024281,2010-05-03,1,FevycwulBfHEZt77dv2EyA,"Let me start out by saying if you go to Carmine's thinking your eating at a Mario Batali type establishment, well then sure you'll be disappointed.   if you go there however, thinking you're going to a casual, fun local bar with an Italian menu, I have no doubt you'll enjoy yourself.  

Carmines is an interesting juxtaposition of sports bar and restaurant.  I love sitting at the bar and grabbing a couple cool suds on a hot night and exploring their tasty and simple menu.  One of my absolute favorites is their greek salad.  Its nothing fancy but is chocked full of fresh veggies and tasty feta cheese.  If Im feeling a bit more ambitious, I'll sometimes venture over to sandwiches of which I really enjoy the eggplant parmigiana.  Its huge and topped with tasty marinara.  The fries are nothing amazing but always come hot and crisp, which for most restaurants is a challenge.  I also really enjoy their various pasta dishes.  The kitchen staff understands the concept of al dente and the portions are generous.  My only complaint is their pasta trends a little on the pricey side whereas I find the other sections of the menu (sandwiches, salads, pizzas) very reasonable.  

The bartenders and servers are always accommodating and as an added bonus the video poker machines at the bar seem to payout better than some other local places.  Overall, Carmine's is not reinventing italian food nor are they even claiming they have the best stuff in town.  What they do accomplish is simple, delicious Italian in a sports bar/restaurant concept that is usually dominated by the same ubiquitous fare like chicken fingers or wings.  

Im thrilled to have Carmines in the neighborhood.  Id probably be thrilled to have a Batali place in the neighborhood too, I just couldn't afford to pop in as much as I do at Carmines.",9qjLfaAqMxgfqdtTlPwRUQ,1,1,4,y9WFXCvpHyTvsLQ9ZAwm3w

3517990,2013-04-16,8,FevycwulBfHEZt77dv2EyA,"As hubby and I were debating what to have for dinner, our friend called to ask if we wanted to meet up at Carmine's. Her timing couldn't have been more perfect or the choice of grub. Just a few days before we tried going at night but after being served our drinks and placing our orders we were told that they realized they couldn't serve us because they had a cook not show up. Denied!

Upon entering Carmine's this visit we were seated right away. I wanted to start out with the ""Mozzarella Fritta"" priced at $7.95. When it arrived to our table it was obvious it had been cooked too long. I think it had potential to be tasty if it was cooked right. The sauce that came with it though was really good. 

I knew I wanted to have pizza so we ordered a ""1/2 Sausage & 1/2 Pepperoni Pizza"" priced at $9.45 and a ""Carmine's Special"" priced at $11.95. Both were good! Our friend ordered the ""Chicken Parmigiana"" priced at $14.95. She shared some of the chicken with me so I could try and I have to say that I would for sure order it. It had good flavor and lots of gooey cheese!  

I grew sort of frustrated when my drink stayed empty. One of the managers noticed my empty drink and that the others at my table needed theirs refilled too and quickly had drinks out to us. She then took the time to ask us how our meal went and seemed genuinely concerned for her customers and their happiness. The thing that stood out most was her passion for the food. I appreciate great food (who doesn't?!) but great service goes a long way too.

I almost forgot to check in on yelp and at the end of the meal I did and realized that with your first check on on yelp you get a free piece of ""Tiramisu""! Score! I showed it to the server and asked if it was too late and he said it wasn't too late at all. Before I knew it there was a piece of tiramisu big enough for us to share.  It was very delicious. Now that I have tried this piece of heaven I will more then likely get it on future visits and ask for it wrapped to have for dessert.

Carmine use to own Villa pizza which had pretty good pie so I had to try this place. Very nice restaurant...... clean, nice decor and Diane my server was really so nice and very attentive! Great service! Carmine owns Ventano's in Henderson which is a really nice place also with fresh baked bread and great food. So...... I ordered the pepperoni with fresh garlic pie as always to judge their pizza. After the pie cooled down I enjoyed it more...... Nice fresh garlic, good pepperoni, nice cheese, the sauce was not really present and the crust kinda lacked flavor but was fine. OVERALL I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VERY NICE RESTAURANT.  I'd have to say their pizza is one of the top 5 in Vegas for NY thin crust. I just wished they had more than one size...... it was about a 12"" personal size. I guess their other locations have multiple sizes. I only spotted one size, $7.95,  in the menu. IMHO the best THIN CRUST PEPPERONI AND FRESH GARLIC pie is made by BRIAN and Antonio  at New York Pizza and pasta on the North East corner of Sahara and Jones. Second place for just a cheese pizza would have to be Dom Demarco's.....3rd place so far is Broadway pizza and probably Carmine's. If you want a nice place to take a girl, Carmines will fit your needs and the pizza is fine.

5199268,2012-08-14,8,FevycwulBfHEZt77dv2EyA,"$2.99 Breakfast Special: this is what I can vouch for! With the recent departure of Del Mar (RIP), we have been stumped as to where to grab breakfast. We got a hot lead that the breakfast at Carmine's was good and clearly cheap, so we decided to go for it. The spot is freshly remodeled, so the interior is spic and span, and we received friendly, prompt service. 

The $2.99 special comes with two eggs, toast, hashbrowns and two slices of toast. Granted, it isn't super fancy, but it was executed perfectly. I wanted my eggs scrambled soft. I hate egg bricks, but 9 times out of 10 that is what I receive when I order scrambled. Here, they delivered nice, soft eggs. The hashbrowns tasted fresh, and they weren't crisped to death. (I actually prefer my browns non-crisp.)  The bacon was fine, and toast is toast. I really liked the coffee, just a nice, well-brewed java. 

We tried to go back again today, but they stop serving breakfast at noon. Travesty. Guess I will have to eat breakfast with the bankers.

The fried calamari were big, crispy and the spicy tomato dipping sauce was good.  This was a great starter.  I then tried the penne putanesca.  It is served with penne pasta, anchovies, capers, onions, with a garlic and tomato sauce.  I added chicken to the dish and it was very tender.

Overall, a good meal, great service and a nice atmosphere.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,0,0,4,NgVph-h3ab7VlJYeqRRLJg

I called and asked if the dining area was open to.children and the bartender let me know the dining area had been closed in general.but she would still let us eat there. Because of her sweet offer I was stoked. Had I had known the dining area was closed everyday because of lack of business I would NOT have eaten there. We had 2 orders of Ravioli, the fried mozzerella, the cesar salad and bread with alfredo sauce for dipping as well as marinara. The Alfredo sauce, which I used to love was a lifeless salty cream of a sauce not tasting anything like alfredo. The marinara sauce was gross too. The tomatoes tasted off beat and kind of old. The ravioli was cold in the middle leaving the cheese to be gross inside. The cesar salad was DISGUSTING. They over dressed the salad and the dressing itself was bitter and bad. The lettuce also tasted dirty. Over all it was a nighmare. We blew $50 on feeling sick and getting grossed out. From our dirty dusty table to the ghost town inside we should have known better. There was a time I used to Crave their Chicken Alfredo. Not any more. I learned the old head chef was no longer there and I think when he left he took the love in the food with him. The bartender was super sweet but as I sent back my salad in a rejection of unhappiness her probing questions told me she was upset I was not willing to pay for something I would not eat. We should have walked out and left but I suffer consequences of my poor decision making.  This is another Restaraunt Impossible waiting to happen. Heck Mr. Irving would clean up on shows from Local Vegas joints. Do not eat at Carmines's even my fried Mozzerella was.over cooked. No love in the food whatsoever",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,11,10,1,6eLkxGzWlDgkFXhr18rhDg

As soon as we walked in we saw through the bar area that the same bartender (Anthony) that helped us last time was working today as well.  As we walked in I was headed to the bar area to ask Anthony if we could possibly dine in the dining room area. Before I could make it to the bar door he was already walking out with 2 glasses of water and 2 menus and promptly offered to sit us at the same table at which we dined last time. I was glad that he had taken the initiative to great us and seat us before I asked. I have to say that this gentlemen is AWESOME he is a quality employee. 

Let me begin to explain why.... Carmines is a Restaurant and Bar. I can tell that the restaurant part is a full on restaurant given the please wait to be seated and the greeter podium. The bar part I can tell is a full on bar as it is enclosed from the dining area. It's quite obvious when entering after 12:00am that the dining area is closed as the lights are dim and there is clearly no waitress or bus boy or greeter. The bar is open though and you can tell because there have always been patrons when I've been in the establishment and there is a clear window straight to the bar where you will see a bartender manning the bar. Having been to prior establishments like this most bartenders prefer for you to dine in the bar area, this way the bartender can offer their assistance without having to leave the bar itself. Also I have always thought of it as they're bartenders not waiters so they really have no need to work the dining area. The fact that this bartender is kind enough to allow you the option to dine in the dining area or sit at the bar was FABULOUS!!!! After all I went into the bar to give him thanks for the great service and I noticed at that time that he had a full bar and was multitasking both the bar and dining area. THAT'S WHY I THINK ANTHONY IS AN AWESOME EMPLOYEE!!

Back to the review!! lol

After being seated the cook came out and remembered us from last time and said you're the man with his pregnant wife that came last time egh?! And I said ""yes"" he shook my hand and said ""we will make you great food!"" 
We ordered the eggplant parmesan with angel hair pasta and a pepperoni pizza. Once again the food was delightful. The pasta was pasta but once mixed with the eggplant it was definitely tasteful. The pepperoni pizza was delicious and filling so much that we ended up having to take half of it to go.

I highly recommend Carmines especially if you are being served by Anthony the graveyard bartender. He has a great personality and is very customer centric.",-onC-AjB6FVFY5PhZ9cpLQ,1,1,5,Z1lWRJFQ98-Tl7LzvBi_Uw

Carmine finally got his baby back and has done an amazing job with the place. The decor is perfectly Italian and the food delicious and the service is warm and friendly. Just like it was years ago. The homemade meatballs and the chicken parm is awesome. It's also nice to have the family roaming thru the restaraunt talking all the guests. Old school Italian style. Go there, you'll love it! Don't forget to have the tiramisu.",Db_aw802offDCDiPoQKgPw,1,1,5,MCLrF6B5fYbDT9cStqY_OQ
