You could have put your lame-ass menu on the door knob, it actually has a cut-out to go on the door handle. But instead, your retard employee took several minutes shoving it loudly into the door frame, so that it actually came into my motel room, waking me up.

It was bad enough that I barely got any sleep, thanks for ruining my first day in Vegas. I'll be sure to never buy anything from you Fat Moe.",SoshavyxSthKjZMB3NMvEw,0,0,1,FNyLB6sgpAS8gC9bv6nG8g

The pizza was fresh and the crust was crispy (even though I took a little longer to pick it up) the wings were amazing, I wasn't very happy about having to pay 75 cents for ranch but after seeing how big the cups of ranch were and how great it tastes I,d gladly pay $1 per cup. Also I ordered 4 (really only needed 2) and they threw in 2 more for free! Customer service was amazing, I was greeted with a big smile and greeting as soon as I walked in the door. If you're looking for pizza and wings for 2 people your best bet would be the XL one topping pizza and a half bucket of wings, chances are you won't be able to finish it and you'll have leftovers for the next day (win/win). I can honestly say that no matter where I end up in Vegas I will make the trip to Fat Moe's Pizza & Wings!",WO7B56yYDq-Yk-Sqs9XWcQ,2,0,5,4_P67TPRBjtcoUNRXfuHKw

1469995,2015-08-07,0,Yr_w9lakJrKMyEG_hI6zbA,Ordered from here just awhile ago as I was craving pizza for dinner and I saw some of the reviews about this place and about how good the wings and pizza are and I thought I'd give this place a shot today from the time I called in for the order there was kind of a miscommunication about what area to deliver the pizza at as they weren't sure about the address I gave them but it got fixed when I explained it to them. Also found out the most of the prices on the menu went up so they really need to update there menu so people who are new to ordering from a place like me will know and there regular customers will know also they told me it would be a 15 dollar delivery charge with my order which I think was ridiculous and highway robbery but companies will find away to get more money out of you one way or another. Now onto the food the driver delivers my food I pay him expect the change back and he's not sure what to give me back I think he knew just didn't want to come out of his pocket to give me the exact change but whatever I get my food pizza is really delicious probably not as good as some of the mom and pop pizza places I went to but for the quality you get it's good. The chicken wings were good a few wings were overcooked more then others but it was still good would love to try there fries but I might order them the next time I order from here overall with some of the positives and negatives I mentioned this place is not that bad and it might be better then some of the other different pizza places that I didn't have much of a good experience if they didn't charge as much as they did for the delivery charge this place and if some of the wings weren't overcooked and the other problem I mentioned with the delivery driver this place would easily get 5 stars from me but overall I see myself checking this place out again when I get a chance.,Unhr6Ut9xQowzzohevNdxg,0,0,4,7ZQcMOuRqqNskWeu8PUj2w

1550969,2014-10-23,3,Yr_w9lakJrKMyEG_hI6zbA,"Driving by I noticed a sign that said ""under new management"" so normally to me this means they are new and improved, so I stopped in to order some dinner to go.

I decided on the Gyro special they have for $5.95 which includes a Lamb and Beef Gyro, French Fries, and a drink.  So the pricing is very reasonable.  The Gyro was decent and fries were delicious and both a good size portion.

They serve a variety of food options, like pizza, burgers and wings.  The pizza actually looked really good and I saw the dough being hand stretched and tossed and you can purchase a one toping pie for 6.99  I hear the wings are awesome, so I will need to return to try these next time. 

The owner tries to be nice and accommodating and the place is nice and clean.  The place sat pretty empty while I was there with mainly takeout orders being fulfilled.  Overall this was an okay find and will definitely update my review on my next visit when I will attempt to try their wings!",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,6,6,3,zFNUed1Gq4Nf6lByqhIQfw

I live in the area and was looking for an alternative to the big chain pizza places and am so glad my boyfriend and I stumbled upon Moe's. He ordered a big man pizza with all the meats and I got a white pizza. We both loved our selections. We also shared mozzarella sticks that I'm now obsessed with along with an order of fries, which were also really delicious. The amount of money we spent would have been used on a couple pizzas and an appetizer at a big pizza chain, so the value was also good.

I gotta say, if we didn't like their pizza so much, we would have dismissed this place a long time ago. (wrote this about  month ago)

update: Ordered pizza and wings from them a week or two ago and the delivery guy showed up 2 hours after the pizza was ordered, after I had already spoken to the manager and he had offered to make a new pizza and wings if I came to pick it up. He also said they would credit my account $20 so the next time we got pizza and wings it would be free. 

today: Attempted to redeem my free pizza and wings and they guy on the phone said that we had a credit for 25% off our next order. I explained to him the situation and asked to speak to a manager. He said he would call me back. When he did, he offered a $15 minimum delivery and anything additional would be on us. HORRIBLE customer service. I'm not sure if they just have very consistent turn-over or what. But we are done trying to justify the food vs the service. I hope the owner reads this and does some serious hiring.

3576999,2011-06-05,0,Yr_w9lakJrKMyEG_hI6zbA,"I drive by here a lot and decided to stop in at random.  What an awful decision.  It was around 1 PM on a weekend and the place was deserted. 

 I got a burger, fries, and a slice of pizza.  The slice was OK.  I mean it wasn't bad but it wasn't good.  Relatively thin crust, a bit greasy but not too much.  I'd rather have Papa John's.  The fries were hot, fresh, and decent.  Seasoned a bit weird, though.  Towards the end I got a bite of a fry that had been covered in black pepper and it took a toll on my tastebuds.

The burger, though, was inexcusable.  Bun and toppings were fine, but the burger itself was disgusting and easily the worst burger I've ever been served at any restaurant.  If you're familiar with the boxes of burgers you can get at the store, like 100 frozen uncooked burgers, that's what these were.  I'm not sure if there is a ton of soy protein or what but they tasted exactly the same.  If you're not familiar, let me just say that they can be best described as ""some food"".  If you don't think about it, it has a neutral taste and a weird mouthfeel, at best.  If you do think about it, you'll start to notice the weird aftertaste as well.

I know people who grew up eating these burgers all the time, so if that's your thing then go for it.  For me, though, I'd rather eat an hour old burger from McDonalds or any other fast food place.  I ended up very sick to my stomach for the next couple of hours.

I remember seeing some other stuff on their menu like spaghetti and meatballs and joking to myself ""Ha, I wouldn't be surprised if they just cracked open a can of Chef Boyardee.""  After reading one of the other reviews below that indicated that they serve frozen lasagna it may not be as much of a joke as I thought.  

The prices are relatively cheap.  The faux burger combo was less than $5 and the slice was $1.75.  Free refills and free delivery if you're so inclined.   Service was fine and the people seemed nice enough, but the food ranges from below average to disgusting.  I'd stay away.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,4,1,2,XJstf9AVqVvNdJvcVO5oyQ

Yesterday, feeling absolutely awful, my fella decided to order in one of my favorite comfort foods: pizza. 

We didn't want to go with another chain, after having such a great experience at another Non-chain pizza place a couple weeks back.

Fat Moe's opens at 10:30am, and we called right at 10:30.  We were politely asked to call back in 5 minutes, but received a phone call within 3, saying they were sorry, and they were ready to take our order.

We ordered a 14 inch Fat Moe's Special:  Pepperoni, Sausage, Ground Beef, and ham, with onions, green peppers, olives, and mushrooms.  

We also ordered the ravioli with beef. 

35 minutes later, we had our food.

The ravioli was awesome.  Filled well, and cooked perfectly, and seasoned well.  I enjoyed them a lot, as did my fella.

The pizza was good too.  The crust could have been a touch crispier, and we definitely should have ordered extra cheese...but it was good!  The ingredients were good, and they use fresh mushrooms,not canned like some places.

The staff is even better. Preston has to be one of the nicest guys I've met! I'm definitely gonna come back and try some other stuff.",v3in4pF9w0wxtPNF09za5Q,0,0,5,qhHt-Af37lnVZfDYog1vRg

They have a special for a large 2 topping pizza, so we got that with 2 drinks totaling about $15 (not bad). The pizza was GREAT. The sauce is delicious and taste fresh, they don't skimp on cheese, ranch is extra but tell me where it's not now a days. That also taste like homemade ranch not that running crap you get at other places. The people are friendly and nice. There isn't a lot of seating inside but I'm assuming they mostly do deliveries/take out. Give it a try!",rwxIAhvgoYQZr6VNz1lvhA,0,2,5,9znj1KbNVPoNnMfd9Ohx_Q

5959243,2011-04-05,3,Yr_w9lakJrKMyEG_hI6zbA,"Well, this place popped up recently and I was curious. Good choice on my part. 

We ordered fried mushrooms, 10 piece wings (hot) and a philly cheesteak (minus the peppers). Everything was fresh, cheap and delcious. 

FIrst off, the fried mushrooms. Best thing I ate. Delicious and crispy perfection. The wings had the right amount of spice. Not super hot for hot. The owner said the garlic wings were spicier, so I might have to try those next time. The cheesesteak was my fella's favorite. I let him take the lead on that one and he was extremely satisfied. 

They have free delivery and a pretty extensive menu (hamburgers, cheesteaks, fried apps, wings, pizza, dessert and pasta). I haven't been extremely tempted to try the other menu items based on reviews, so I stick to the cheesesteaks, fried apps and wings.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,2,3,n-zbJcWmakbutnTdIoEOAQ
