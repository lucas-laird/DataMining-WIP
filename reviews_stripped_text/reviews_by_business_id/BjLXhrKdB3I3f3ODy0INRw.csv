21746,2012-04-11,0,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"Went there at 6PM on Saturday for a nice dinner before the Rod Stewart show at The Coliseum.  Place was 3/4 empty, and hostesses (there were several, all chatting with each other and genuinely uninterested in customer service) seated us at a table without setups, no glassware, no napkins.  Ten minutes later, busboy shows up - seriously, we timed it - with silverware and water glasses.  The waiters kept stopping by the hostess station, lots of arm waving and rolling eyes - not looking good. At 6:23PM - yes, that's right, TWENTY THREE MINUTES after being seated - the waiter dropped by to take a drink order.  We asked if we would be able to make the 7:30 show, and the waiter said probably not.  Wow.

We left and dropped $200 at another restaurant that was far more interested in service, had a wonderful meal, made the awesome show... And will never return to Central again.

Clearly customer service is not a priority at Central.  If you've got unlimited time and don't mind being ignored or made to feel inconsequential, this is your kind of place!",dsb8Pa_x4R-v_vMa-V1fUA,2,0,1,l84hJPAYofjESEYzikFe-Q

That name atop this new lobbyside restaurant at Caesars Palace means that you'll contribute to significant per-dish profit for things like a simple salad or a single breast of skinless boneless fried chicken with a smattering of mashed potatoes.

The food is high quality and tasty through and through, but when you're sitting in an upgraded 24-hour coffee shop environment, gazing out at a dated fluorescent lit hotel lobby, it's weird to pay $24 for a chicken breast or $15 for a cocktail.

In a very competitive Las Vegas dining scene, it's difficult to fathom how anyone thought that this space and these prices were going to find success (it was practically empty when we dined). 

Again, the food is good - they just need to better separate the dining room from the parking garage glow of the lobby and consider lowering the prices or increasing the portions.",Vwi9k9lBQrDP2tuA5igBUA,0,0,3,TysEV4qK6n45CknUMMp1cg
194140,2012-01-18,0,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"An overpriced glorified Dennys Restaurant, but Dennys has much better service. My wife and I decided to have dinner here, due to a recommendation from a friend before attending the Celine Dion show. Before dinner we both ordered drinks. My wife had a vodka martini that was just okay. I ordered a Jack Daniels and Soda. Our waiter came back with Jack Daniels and Coke. This by itself can be a simple mistake and overlooked, but in hindsight, and the only reason I mention it, is that this was the beginning of a terrible experience and completely in context with the cacophony of disastrous experiences. We knew what we wanted for dinner by checking out the menu online. However we confirmed our order after perusing the paper menu. We ordered the 26 oz Tomahawk Rib Eye for two to share for $69.The menu states that you can choose from three sauces and we chose the peppercorn. We also ordered the sautéed mushrooms, and told our waiter that we would like to put it on our steak for two. My wife was concerned about the timing, as we did not want to be late for the 8:30 Sunday night Celine Dion concert. We were seated at our reserved table at 6:30pm and ordered right away. Our waiter took the wine glasses away right after we ordered, never asked if we wanted wine with dinner. We did want wine with dinner but since we were still working on our drinks, we figured we would order wine when the Rib eye arrived. Little did we know that the Rib Eye would arrive at our table at 7:27pm! Nearly an hour later! We were hungry and eager to dig in....but there was no peppercorn sauce, there was no sautéed mushrooms....AND we did not even have plates for each of us to eat on....forget about wine! After what seemed like forever trying to locate our waiter. He appeared....there he was at the table behind us...apologizing to a customer for the medium well steak she received, instead of the rare steak she ordered. This was literally a really bad dream... a freaking nightmare! By now our steak was stone cold! In spite of our upset we kept our composure and politely asked for two plates, our peppercorn sauce and our sautéed mushrooms. Now it was 7:44pm (watching the clock) and our waiter told us that the peppercorn sauce was literally following right behind him, but not really. By the time we got the peppercorn sauce, the sautéed mushrooms and the plates to eat on, it was just after 8pm. After one and half hours later we are now finally able to rush through our meal, cold steak and all. To be honest, the food was really good! The steak was flavorful, the peppercorn sauce when arrived hot, was awesome. The sautéed mushrooms with garlic was exceptionally great. Too bad the service does not match the food. I have to think that the chefs have no clue, what literally crappy, idiotic, brain-dead, seemingly on purpose stupid service is happening when the food leaves the kitchen. 
But I am almost embarrassed to admit we went back....yes we went back after the concert for drinks at the bar as nothing else was open........ AND my wife was hungry and so we went back into the restaurant ....Stay tuned will let you know how that turned out",xx6L0bnWW_YLVouBko0BVQ,0,0,1,tU48XsN2AqvI8GvF2l1tIA
229970,2012-08-24,0,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"I just ate dinner at Central. Very nice modern bistro type of look. I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken and roasted potatoes. It also came with a nice salad. It was a good meal, just what I was looking for tonight. Also reasonably priced for Caesars and Vegas. This isn't a wow type place -- there are many of those on the strip, but it does help balance the budget with the more expensive dinners I have here. Service was excellent.

Update: I went back to Central for breakfast this morning. I had good luck the night before and when I walked by this morning it looked very bright and cheery, so I decided to forgo the walk to the Wynn for the buffet there. It was about 7:45 in the morning and the place was 70% empty. Probably 30 or more empty tables. The couple in front of me was told it would be about 5 minutes and to wait to the side. I was told the same thing. No explanation given, and the two hostesses were not very friendly. 5 minutes go by ....still not seated. Another guy comes up...he gets seated immediately.  The other couple and I keep waiting...still not seated. So I say to heck with this, if I have to wait indefinitely and get treated this way, I might as well walk over to the Wynn for the buffet. I did, had a nice walk and had an awesome breafast. I probably won't come back and if I do, if I don't get seated right away when there are open tables in plain site, I'll immediately go elsewhere.

284701,2012-02-07,1,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"If you have ever read a review of mine you are aware that my entire review can hinge on a restaurants cheese plate and wine list.  These two things are the cornerstone to my normal diet so I was excited to try Central in Caesar's Palace.  

I was impressed overall with their 5 cheese spread.  They had the piece of mind to chose cheeses that started mild and gained flavor until a nice strong blue at the end.  For people who are not great at picking cheeses, this could be a good introduction.  The pickles and dates that came with the spread also complimented the assortment well.  My only issue was that the plate came with bread instead of thin crackers.  I think that bread overpowers the cheese sometimes and would prefer something simpler.  

Thought being pregnant I could not partake, I was pretty impressed with the wine list available at Central.  My husband and I were able to identify multiple wines we were familiar with and even some wineries we had been too.  I appreciated their selection of reds, which included some quality earthy reds that I enjoy. 

I was a little disappointed in the meat plate however.  My husband and I were originally going to get the Prosciutto plate to go with our cheese, however the waiter suggested the meat assortment.  It had Prosciutto, salami, another meat that tasted like bologna to me, foie gras, and a pâté.  The Prosciutto and salami were both good, but the rest fell short for me.  The foie gras was the consistency of sour cream, that patte looked (and tasted) like cat food, and the other meat was nothing special.  Again, I have to come back to the cracker issue.  Both pate and foie gras should not be spread on bread.  

In the end I would go back for the wine and cheese, but stay away from the meat selection it was unimpressive.",UqoGuABfR5G7bbgIBzxNnQ,1,1,3,4ExaK6bR4FnVyrnwG8MkWA

Thanks to awesome east cost weather, our plane landed 4 hours later than scheduled, and instead of having a dinner and clubbing all night we ended up at the Central, which is open 24/7.

Food - it was absolutely worth its price. I had a burger with salad which I killed on the spot, since I hadn't had any food for almost 24 hours, except stupid pretzels on the plane. My gf ordered a Caesar salad which tasted so good that I ended up stealing a quarter from her.

We were all starving, so this place was fairly close. I wish I had had time to check these reviews, because the place is just crap like everyone else here seems to say. I got scrambled eggs and a freaking muffin for $10 because it was the cheapest thing I could find. If I'm spending that much, the eggs better be made of gold or something. They literally tasted like bland buffet eggs and were super runny! The overpriced food wasn't even the worst part. The service was absolutely HORRENDOUS! We waited over an HOUR for our BREAKFAST and the waiter was extremely rude. I have never been treated with such disdain before in my life. He would never check on us, and the one time he came over to fill the coffee (finally) my Mom had to catch him as he tried to saunter away without saying anything to us and asked very politely, ""how's the food looking?"" I couldn't believe what came out of his mouth, he said with so much sarcasm I thought it was dripping from his tongue, ""hopefully good..."" rolled his eyes and walked away.

So sister and I each ordered the smoked salmon plate, and an order of breakfast potatoes and of fresh fruit to share.  Seemed as ""lunchy"" as we could get.

The smoked salmon was amazing!!!  Yes it was $18 each but I think each plate included at least 5 oz (possibly more like 8 oz) of fish.  And the fish was to die for.  Melted in mouth.  Served with creme fraiche and lightly toasted slices of brioche.  Yum yum yum.  The potatoes were fingerlings and were delectable; the watermelon in the fruit plate was delicious and it's December!

For two girls who wanted lunch, we left full and very happy. Plus the coffee was delish.  And our server Rene F. was fabulous, as was the busser who assisted.

It is obvious that management does not care about the customers.  The host staff acts as though it is an inconvenience to seat you and spends a lot of time at the host station putting on make-up and checking their phones.  On our LAST visit yesterday morning, the host staff seated us right next to a table of loud drunk boys even though the restaurant was practically empty and we asked to be seated somewhere else.  We tried to tolerate it, but they kept getting louder and using profanity.  The server tried to ask them to keep it down but that only made them louder.  There was not a manager to be seen.  My husband went to the host stand and asked for the manager to be sent to the table.  The manager, Raymond came out from the back and spoke with the hostesses for 5-10 minutes looking at our table and NEVER came over to the table.  As we were getting ready to leave I asked our server for the manager on duty's name and shortly after that Raymond came to the table to ask if everything was ok.  I told him it was not ok a half hour ago and he said he was unaware of any problems.  So I said really, then why were you talking to the hostesses and looking over here?  He said he didn't want to interrupt our meal.  Seriously?  You think ignoring a problem and then lying about it is CUSTOMER SERVICE?  Caesars is a nice hotel with great customer service.

I'm giving this restaurant 1 star only because I have to give it a rating. Ideally it would get no stars, or 5 negative stars. 

We were perfectly fine eating elsewhere for breakfast for the past 2 weeks, but decided to try something new on our last day, what a mistake!

We ordered a plate of the pancakes and waffles to share, and both dishes came with a small bowl of mixed berries. Sorry, I'd specify which type of berries they were but the MOLD all over them kind of made it hard to distinguish them...perhaps raspberries, blueberries and strawberries. 

What boggles my mind is how someone in the kitchen could have not realized the blatant white patches of mold webbed around the berries that they prepared on a dish, it couldn't have been more obvious. How could the server not have realized the berries didn't look like they were supposed to when she carried the plates out? (She was nice though, her name was Barbara).

This completely ruined our appetite, and I got paranoid about what else isn't fresh in my meal. If you offer an all day breakfast item, then don't serve it if it can't stay fresh all day! Don't restaurants get shut down for such health violations? 

Our server spoke to the manager and was able to waive the cost of one of the dishes, however the manager never came over to our table to speak to us, as is custom if there are any issues ever. Even with the one dish removed, the bill was high for such mediocre food. $5 for a small glass of orange juice (most likely from a can).

The decor is modern and fresh with splashes of yellow, but really what the hell does that matter if my breakfast has mold on it! Also, it took forever to get to the place from the self-parking garage. 

Overall, the place is pretentious, overpriced, and definitely not fresh. I can't believe Chef Michel Richard put his name on this piece of crap. I will NEVER come here again, and I will also be contacting the manager of the restaurant so I can direct them to this review I left here. Maybe I wouldn't have been so harsh had you have taken your head out of your butt and come talk to us at the restaurant when this incident occurred (and no, it wasn't busy at the time this happened).

This place very much wants you in and out, and once again reinforces how all that glitters isn't gold in Vegas. Sometimes it's moldy.",ZRb3I6biU1CKAouktK4Buw,5,0,1,_x_bAR3gTQIP66SCzZ1HWw

Lunch - I had the lobster burger which, although its pricey at approx. $30, is almost all lobster and HUGE!  The little crunchy potato twilles put on top adds a lot of texture.  And I love that the burgers are served on little wooden platters.  A+++.  I also had a VERY spicy bloody mary - one of the best I've had in a while. Dessert - chocolate bar (which I would recommend for anyone; doesn't look like much but tastes like everything).

Dinner - Cheese puffs as an appetizer, which are little pastries with gruyere cheese.  DELISH.  I could've just eaten those and been a happy little lady.  For an entree I had the crab burger, and I may have actually liked this better than the lobster burger.  Again, another bloody mary, which was just as good as the previous one I tasted. For dessert, the cheesecake (which was great, nice, fluffy, filling); tried the celebration cake (a showstopper); and again the chocolate bar.

I quickly called over the manager, he was not so shocked, I knew the plastic was for pre-packaged food which pissed me off even more and he asked if I wanted anything else instead... I said let me see the menu. I ordered a sandwich because I didn't want to go wait anywhere else and a cold, mediocre Club sandwich arrived. On my bill I saw I was being charged for the sandwich and this urks me so I call over Xavier again...his manager says to me: ""Well when he asked if you want anything you did not reply so you agreed to pay for it yourself"" Seeing as how I was not one to be argued with he took the bill and I left.

I sat at the bar.  And I waited while 3 other people who showed up after me were waited on first.  I started to think the bartenders actually couldn't see me.  When I got my coffee I had to ask twice for milk.  I ordered my eggs scrambled, but they came out fried.  In the bartender's defense, I think he did ring them in correctly, this was a kitchen mistake.  When they brought the food back with scrambled eggs they were watery, probably because they threw them on the grill for 20 seconds.  The potatoes were not very well cooked, the bigger chunks didn't seem to be done all the way.

I still would have been ok with all this, if two customers hadn't come up, sat on either side of me while ordering food (as if they couldn't just ask me to move down a seat), and bumping into me.  Then while they were waiting for their food, the man starts coughing on me.  Seriously just coughing without even covering his mouth.  Disgusting.

Nothing unique on the menu except a Croque Madame sandwich, which in hindsight I should have ordered as it would have probably been hot.

When the new batch arrived they were certainly hot, but also clearly just out of a deep fryer. Greasy doesn't begin to describe them. And they tasted like the same cheap frozen & fried potatoes you'd get at any bad breakfast joint. The bacon was tasteless & limp, the ham was bland & I didn't venture into the sausage.

We tarted with some apps:

Cheesesteak sliders ($15)  steak was tender but, try to find the cheese .... fries included were crisp and tasty

Potato Nachos ($11) - this dish should be called, ""Try to find the cheese, Part II""  but i did like the chips !

Main Entrees:

Rotisserie Chicken ( $22) - includes fingerling potatoes ( they always freak me out ) and a side salad.  The highlight was the dipping au jus.  The chicken was ""mushy""

Meatloaf ( $24) - included mashed potatoes and hericot verts.  Meatloaf overcooked, potatoes good, verts - ice cold.

Short Ribs ( $38) -  very tender, flavorful.  gf ordered a side of polenta - creamy, buttery, delicious.

Rib eye steak ($39) - covered in gravy with a side of mushrooms.  Rib  eye does not swim very well in gravy !  the mushrooms were decent.

Ordered a slice of chocolate cake to go ( we were late to Smith Center for a show ) - the gf ate it on the way to the show - i had a bite.  not impressed - thick layers of a dark chocolate mouse - no frosting to speak of and it had a berry juice infused in it - didn't work for either of us.

The chicken was very good, the mashed potatoes solid, and the other dishes respectable. The service was flat. We asked four times for bread, and the bacon we ordered on the cheeseburger was conspicuously absent when the burger arrived.

I read the negative reviews for this place and was appalled.  If you order chili cheese fries from anywhere for $8 then you are definitely not a foodie.  You do not come to a place like this for fries.
I understand that this is Ceasars 24 hour spot, so you think you are going to a cafe and expecting it to be cheap.  1) you are in Vegas so nothing is cheap.  2) look at the atmosphere/ambience and the menu and then ask yourself if you walked into just a cafe.  My words/thoughts to you??? Check yo self before you wreck yo self!  Yah dig!?

Moving on.... The place is beautiful inside and out!  The customer service was wonderful!  The management came out and greeted us both nights and they were both really pleasant.  The bread and butter were warm an tasty.  We never had to ask for a refill and as soon as you finished one plate, they promptly cleaned our table after each course!

Tuna Carpaccio with a Asian soy vinagarette.  ( a huge portion ). Chilean sea Bass with fingerling potatoes in a sauce I can't even describe!  And a single pineapple upside down cake for one.

First of all, the space is amazing. Having taken over the 24 hour cafe that previously occupied this spot, Central now offers diners the pleasure of eating at any time of day, on any day of the year. This is a great place to have a late night meal, especially in Vegas.

The bad news is because it is Vegas, and because it is located in Caesars Palace, your meal will be considerably more expensive than if you ate anywhere else. Having said that, it is still completely worth it to dine here (especially if you can get it comped, which I didn't).

The food is comfort food...similar to Central in DC. Though Richard offers extravagant dining at some of his other restaurants, you aren't likely to find anything at Central that your mommy can't make at home, though at half the quality. 

Central is well worth the visit in Vegas, especially if you hit big on the craps table the night before. It's a good way to celebrate and give some of that money back to Las Vegas, before the Blackjack dealer takes it anyways!!!",2Fu4xzc4Z4SvRGDcfC0qfA,1,1,4,hkP_tkF7V9xiR90gJQg2iw

The restaurant has a bar upfront and the restaurant inside.  It's located right in the lobby of Caesar Palace, to the left when you walk thru the front door to CP.

Hubby really wanted to try this place because he noticed they had a famous fried chicken on the electronic menu in front of the restaurant.  So, one night we went in to try the food.  The place was not crowded, nor was there a line.  The ladies at the front desk all wear short, tight little black dresses, a deceptive device to draw you in as you watch them wiggle you to your seats. 

Our waiter really lacked personality.  You'd think he was working at a small town coffee shop and didn't care if you ate there or not.  We both tried the fried chicken, which consisted of 3 large pieces of panko fried chicken over whipped potatoes.  The potatoes were good, the chicken so-so.  I can easily make the chicken at home.  I tried the onion soup and it wasn't near as good as the onion soup I had at Bouchon.  Hubby's salad was pretty good.

Some of the other wait staff brought our dinner to our table and they seemed much more professional and attentive.
At close to 11PM, a line started to form for tables while the front desk ladies started to change shift.  A pair of men took so long looking over the menu trying to decide if they were going to dine there, that I noted 4 other folks in line decided not to wait and departed while the young lady managing the front desk stood there ignoring the other customers in line. She should've asked the men if it was OK for her to seat others ahead of them (tons of tables were free) while they took their time to decide. 
That's a real good way to lose business.  Someone needs to do more staff training for the front desk as well as the wait staff.",swmrfBnaqU0nyJ3pFBfNgQ,2,0,2,xaGQczViA_jmK4WzatC3OA

A restaurant with a French namesake could surely do better. 

Because we were hungry we went here in the morning for breakfast. Again, expecting something better than the crappy place that was here for years we were disappointed.  The egg in a hole was a piece of toast not just slathered in butter but perhaps saturated to the level only a fat chef serving typically fat americans could only aporeciate. There was that and a hair on the place. 

Did Richard just need some licensing money?  Surely, we wouldn't let what we experienced fly.

Unfortunately that wasn't the case.  We were seated promptly, but after that service went downhill.  None of us were looking for hearty meals and when asking the waiter how big the meals were he could not tell us.  The waiter took our food orders, but not once asked us for drinks.  Gregg M and I were thinking about a welcome to Vegas cocktail, however the waiter didn't bring us a cocktail menu when I asked for one. When I finally got their cocktail menu, he told me that none of the cocktails were available on the menu (they had run out of the ingredients).  After all this, the waiter still didn't ask anyone else at the table if they wanted something else to drink.

2907957,2013-04-15,6,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"After a weekend of drinking, gambling, and general bad behavior, we wanted to get some food before leaving town. 

My boyfriend was of the ""let's go to Sonic's"" camp, but I said I'd rather have some ""real"" food. This wasn't it.

We considered a buffet, but figured the price wouldn't be worth it for shitty food and started walking around to find an actual restaurant.

Unfortunately, we found this place and its less than buffet-quality breakfast, and ended up paying the most we paid for a meal all weekend.

$20 gets you a plate of food crammed with eggs (the scrambled eggs had no salt and tasted like the same stuff McDonald's puts on your breakfast platter), mini-pancakes, and a bunch of meat. The bacon was tiny and shriveled but it's bacon so I guess I can't complain, the sausages tasted like mushy goop encased in a really tough outer shell, and the piece of ham was on the rubbery side and looked like something you'd see a cartoon character eating. Like idiot assholes, we got 2 of these. 

$18 for a plate of corned beef hash and eggs. The over-easy eggs definitely looked like they came out of a real egg, so I was happy about that. The potatoes were fried to shit, but were fine for a hangover breakfast, and the ""corned beef hash"" was a puck of greasy deep-fried corned beef patty. Not the kind of corned beef I'd expected for the price -- this was like Hormel corned beef from a can sliced into rounds, frozen, then deep fried and oozing with grease. I'm not totally against that idea, as canned corned beef hash is kind of one of my most disgusting guilty pleasures, but this should have been wrapped in a wax paper sleeve and handed to me through my car window in exchange for $3. 

$15 more dollars for more pretend eggs and a few more of those tiny mushy sausages with another weird and greasy puck of hash browns? At least McDonald's hash brown oblongs have that deceptive potato-y shape.

$12 for a Bloody Mary served in a small juice glass which basically tasted like a V8, but did have a tiny hint of bologna. I looked at the menu and realized the bologna must have been why it's called a ""lardon"" bloody mary. I've never left alcohol on the table at a restaurant before, but this was totally called for. At $3 per sip, I figure I left about $8 behind.

The best value was the coffee and the latte, at $4 and $6, respectively. No refills on the coffee. Or, who knows, maybe you can get a refill if you can get somebody to come by your table. But by the time our server came back around, we had already raided a neighboring table for their salt and pepper, and managed to get somebody eating nearby to give us one of their tiny single-serving bottles of tabasco. Chalked the slow service up to our server not wanting to face us after we tasted our food. We finished our plates because we were hungry and paid a lot of money, but I wish we'd had enough balls to just leave. 

I'm glad I didn't realize this was a ""celebrity chef""-y place, otherwise I might have had some expectations. Before I logged on to Yelp and realized that this place has, like, a name attached to it, I was going to say that high prices and shitty food are probably kind of expected for a 24-hour place in the lobby of a hotel. But waitasec, you're telling me that it isn't wildly unreasonable to expect the food to taste better than something I cook at home while half-asleep and completely wasted in my underwear at 3am, then eat while standing up over the sink? 

Well, now I think Michael Richard owes me $112. ...And he should probably hook our waiter up, because at the end of the meal, I just felt bad that he had to hand us that check. It was probably kind of embarrassing for him.

If you have $112 burning a hole in your pocket, you should just take it to a slot machine. It's faster that way, and you're less likely to get the shits.",jud8qOqKrXvW_5vBMEnYKQ,2,1,1,J0U8cVKI5EFhxyKYp-x4uA

In depth review: Have eaten here several times and have had mixed feelings. My first occasion was sub-par from beginning to end, the second occasion was spectacular all the way around, the third occasion was 50/50. 

This review was based on the most recent visit and what we will call the ""mixed bag."" 

Was a busy Saturday at 7:30pm and all the restaurants at Ceasars were completely sat and operating off a table waiting list. We decided to try Central Michael Richard as the restaurant was half sat and we could sit right away. Not sure if that was a sign or not? Our server was attentive and very polite. Made some suggestions on the menu and took our drink order. So we ordered a beer, a mixed drink and fried calamari as our appetizer. Server came to the table several times to let us know that the drinks were n the way and apologized for the hold-up. Our fried calamari appetizer arrived and still no drinks yet? We start eating and soon after the beverages arrive. So issues with timing as drinks should never arrive after the food. Server did apologize again and blamed the bar. 

The fried calamari appetizer is served in the steel basket they use in the deep fryer and its placed on a plate. Unfortunately this was not up to par. The calamari was extremely soggy and all the breading feel off as you tried to dip it in the sauce and eat it. Were left with a wet, chewy piece of squid, a basket full of the breading and a plate full of grease. Was pretty bad.

We order two entrees - 1) the signature meatloaf and 2) the short ribs. Thought the short ribs were a little over priced at $42 for the entree. Both arrived and had really good presentation and taste. The meat loaf is wonderful and highly suggested. They melt swiss cheese in the meat and it adds some great flavor. The short rib was one of the best I have had in the city. Entrees made up for the poor appetizer. Both were big portions and very filling - good job!

Two other minor things that turned me off - these can easily be fixed by management: 1) plastic cup they serve the butter in with the fresh bread - and 2) the plastic menu covers or menu sleeves are low budget and look like what you see in a cheap diner. Get rid of them. Not a good look for what you are trying to charge - unless you want to be a diner? 

I feel once they make some minor edits, tweaks and adjustments that they can be a restaurant a big player. I will give them another shot if I am in the casino or have the urge to eat meatloaf, but I do not see myself going out of the way to make a visit.",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,2,0,3,vSmw36pmA3obHdKXOu3pkw

The side dip of honey mustard was a welcomed addition, but it didn't help this poor fried chicken from it's dismal flavorless self. To top it off, I paid a pretty penny. Oh, how I wish I used that penny to get me a bucket of (insert fast food fried chicken here) that would feed a family of 4.",N6llta3D8IVSPQ2k_rvWbA,1,1,3,D7nCvhrfw7RPFcd-Z6CMTw

We over ordered and it isn't cheap but all of us were happy. 3 mac n cheeses were great, had a nice crunchy crust and were more than enough - bigger than waiter implied. Spicy hot wings had a bit of crunch, good spice level, perfectly cooked. Goat cheese caesar salads, one with chicken, one plain. were fantastic and maybe the best presented caesar I've had yet. Meat ball burger, served with fries in a cute frier basket,  was very good, not too big and could have used a little more sauce but was still delicious and the bun held up well.  The winner for the night was the meatloaf. Very delicious. Rich hearty flavor, served with mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes. I don't think I've had better.

For breakfast I witnessed a bowl of grits be run across the dining room and immediately returned by the runner -- who appeared to have that ""what table?"" look of his face.  Then a bowl of grits appeared on our table.  Same plate?  Who knows and who cares... the question became, ""where's the rest of our meals?""  It took several minutes for the waiter to work it out and the story was that ""chef thought the runners took  the food"".  That delay didn't seem to harm the American breakfast, or the filet and eggs very much... but it transformed the sauce on the eggs benedict into a semi-solidified coating.  Now that was a very tasty coating but not much of a sauce.  Running food shouldn't be too much of a challenge but it seemed to be challenging the staff on that day.  Had the food been delievered promptly and in top-quality condition this probably would have been a 4.5 star rating!

p.s.  I'm suspecting that the following is much more complex an issue than I can imagine... but what's up with the lady wearing the brown shirt (Ceaser's uniform?)  doing hte floor cleanup?

There is also a seating area that you may take a place from the open area in the Hotel. It is like sitting at the bar without going into the restaurant itself. 

This place was so nice that over a period of a week at Caesar's we visited seven times. I was there for breakfast, lunch, and a late snack after the Celine Dion show. 

The food is good and tasty. Everything from the breakfast sausage, house potatoes that are cooked to perfection, steak salad, crab cake, burgers, turkey club, and eggs all came out at a level I expect in my home town. 

Rather than seek out other places for breakfast and lunch Central kept pulling me back in to enjoy their menu. A shout out to Nishma and to Dave who went out of their way at different times to make me feel welcome and treated us like a regular. And the Director of Service Fredi was at the top of his game in making sure we were taking care of.

Central was much cleaner than the rest of the environment - it's situated right next to the casino, though thankfully the smokiness of the casino did not penetrate the restaurant itself. The wine rooms within the restaurant were interesting to look at, and the bar itself had a simple chic vibe going for it.

Our server, Brittany, was very sweet and helpful considering she had to work on Christmas. She politely informed us that many of the dishes were out for the evening, including the side of macaroni that a couple of reviews have mentioned. My brothers ordered burgers, my father the meatloaf, and I the Chilean sea bass.

And the fact that it was open 24 hours just made me even more excited about it!  Goodbye bland Augustus Cafe hello to James Beard winning Central.

I loved what they did to the spot (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=IURHBUKYbVgd64PGcyEmOQ).  If you were ever a fan of the old Augustus Cafe, Central's decor and atmosphere will make you instantly forget about it.  The Bar outside the restaurant also makes for a great people watching area since it's in the Caesars Palace main lobby.

I took advantage of the Late Night Dining Menu and came in at around 1:30am in the morning.  One thing I definitely noticed right away...the waitresses here are hot!  I didn't really waste anytime looking at the menu because I had already heard about their famous Lobster Burger.  And that's just that I ordered.

The Lobster Burger had a very simple and elegant presentation (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=SmvLP2PF5ezpHlpvVL0rCg).  It would say it's pretty comparable to a Lobster Roll with tomato, Central Mayonnaise, Potato Tuile.  This was amazing!!  The Lobster patty was very meaty and had that Buttery Lobster flavor that I love!  It regularly comes with French Fries, but for this late night meal I opted for the Salad with vinaigrette dressing.  At $32, I'd say that it's worth the price considering the uniqueness of it being in Burger form and the fact that Lobster is not cheap.  I would definitely order this again!  The one little flaw that I unfortunately came across with the Lobster Burger was that I found a really tiny shell inside.  The good thing is that this proves that they used real Lobster for the Burger.  I showed the shell to my waitress and she definitely took note of it and mentioned it to the chef.  When she came back she told me that they really felt bad about it and they offered to pay for the whole meal.  WIN!!!  What incredible customer service!!

Because of that great service, I really felt obligated to go back again.  So I came a few days later for a late dinner and tried their Roast Chicken and Potatoes with a side of Brussel Sprouts with Bacon (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=L9zC30zKgQ2HojI0fumJLQ).  Delish again!  The Potatoes were cooked in the Chicken fat a la Roli Roti so you can taste the Chicken flavor in the Potatoes as well.  Here's a close up shot of the Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=J5yesWjEMJfLp8UTE_gC3g).  Are you drooling yet???  And the side of Brussel Spouts with Bacon complimented the Chicken very well.  It doesn't look like much in this pic (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=SWj7SBg6IJ39SnYstAtkxw) but it was packed with Bacon flavor.  YUM!!  Who doesn't like Bacon?

I've eaten at a fair share of restaurants on the Strip, and Central has definitely made a great impression on me with their amazing food and incredible service, and just shot up in my upper ranks, especially in the realm of 24 hr cafes.

And I could tell the lady was not happy with her experience. 

I ordered the Rotiserrie chicken .. it was okay .. a little dry .. potatoes weren't cooked all the way, they were a bit hard.  Seasoning of the gravy was pretty good, the description said there was garlic, did not taste a bit of garlic.  My bf ordered the burger with a side salad.  He hated the side salad and the burger was drenched in grease and oil, maybe thats just how they come.  The bacon was overly dry and very hard, he just took it out and didn't eat it. 

Overall, it was a terrible experience minus our bartender.  The place just wasn't anything special and from reading yelp I thought it was going to be a great experience .. especially b/c I couldn't wait to try the Profiteroles b/c only other place that has great profiteroles in town is Comme Ca.  But a yelp review said Central had the best.. but when I came .. Profiteroles were no where to be found on the dessert menu :(

Scattered service.   Brought out hot plates, but didn't bring food out until the plates had gotten cold.

Runners refilled our sparkling water the first time with tap, the second with tea.  Didn't replace the bottle of sparkling water that was essentially ruined. Didn't offer tap when we ran out of sparkling.  Why reorder when they'd just screw up the second bottle?  

Awful food.  So disappointed by the food that is so NOT worthy of Michel Richard's name that I actually cried.  I adore Michel.  My husband adores Michel.  We wanted this to be all we've dreamed of it being since I learned he was taking over the space and kicked ourselves for not having the idea first. 

Bar food:  Chicken wings.  Meh.   Way to messy for me.  Calamari.  Crispy but the sauces were uninspired and dull.  

Starters:   Salad with Goat Cheese.  Lovely. 

Onion and Bacon Tart.  Frozen and reheated - still cold.  Would have been delicious if it were cooked through -- but the fact that I was able to discern that it had been frozen sickened me. 

Steak Tartare - gloppy, sticky mess -- texture was not what I expected from this French chef.  Fries were delicious. Hot and crispy.   


Entrees:  Dry chicken - yes the supposedly miraculous rotisserie chicken.  Inedible.  One bite and wished I'd not taken it.  

T bone Steak  with King Crab-  sounds delicious, right?  Sadly, disgusting - oversalted because the sauce was made with base - and covered the entire steak.  Served with frozen king crab legs -- rubbery, tasteless, still frozen.  Awful.  Worst surf & turf I've had in Vegas. Period.  Hell, worst steak.  

Lamb shank with polenta.  Delicious.

Sides:  haricots verts.  Frozen.  I swear...  another tear.  Mashed potatoes could have been used for wallpaper paste.  ?!!   

Desserts:  Napoleon was Cheesecake Factory sized and actually embarrassed me.  Awful.  Hated it.

Molten Chocolate was nasty. 

We asked the server to pick his two favorite desserts.  Suffice it to say, we were completely underwhelmed...and it did not redeem the disastrous meal we'd endured.

Michel, please don't set up a restaurant like this and leave town...You've not got the right people in place to maintain consistency, quality and to operate a 24/7 operation with your name on the door.  We were there on a very slow Monday night at 8pm.  I was sad and embarrassed for you and doubly devastated that this precious rare dinner that I was able to share with my husband was so memorable for its awfulness.

Basically Central is an overpriced Peppermill or Denny's. The water they served was at room temperature and tasted horrible. I ordered $14 chips and guacamole which was really gross! The tiny guacamole bowl had avocados that weren't ripe yet and the chips were something out of a Tostitos commercial. For $14 I would expect at least a bigger dip bowl, good guacamole and some chips with flair! (Maybe even the lime or scoops kind??) At least the chips at Roberto's or Taco Bell are warm and crispy! Just sayin..

My Asian chicken salad was tiny for $16 but after eating unripe avocados and stale chips this at least hit the spot.. The chicken was flavorful with good peanut, greens and dressing ratio.

Often times when I go out to places I order an appetizer as my meal because for me personally that is more than enough food or maybe I am not as hungry whatever the case may be but that is no excuse to look treat me different than you would treat anyone else. I am still a customer even if I order a drink only.

She was polite and kind and have them the time of day. They all ordered entrees by the way.

My first problem is that they have items on their menu that they no longer serve and I'm not talking about a situation where they run out of a certain product and no longer have it at this time, they literally have items on their menu that they have not served at Central for months and have no plans on serving anytime soon.  That right there is a major issue.

The service is shotty, the waiters and what I believe to be a busboy or assistant waiter happen to know nothing about the menu.  Couldn't really answer questions and they actually contradicted each other.  I asked the waitress about the item that was on the menu that they no longer served and she said they didn't serve it anymore, two seconds later another guy claims that they do serve this item.

The food was blah, I had the meatloaf and the mashed potatoes, the mashed potatoes were way too salty. It was unbearably salty and borderline uneatable.  The meatloaf was okay, nothing special at all about it but at least it tasted like what it was suppose to be and not just salt.

The only reason I came was to try the fried chicken.  Well, I was told by my server that lunch service doesn't start until 11:30.  Not wanting to sit for 30 minutes before I could even order, I asked her if there was something that could be done.  So, she asked the chef and they accommodated me, starting to prepare the chicken immediately.  I was very appreciative of this gesture, thus the extra star.

The chicken itself had excellent crust, but lacked salt.  It was crunchy and went well with the buttery potato puree it sat upon.  You get a white piece and a dark piece, which I liked.  Most places that serve fried chicken in this setting (a nice casino) only give you white meat.  I prefer the dark, it's juicier and more flavorful, and this chicken was no different.  The sauce is a thin mayo based sauce.  It was good, but I won't be replacing cream gravy anytime soon.  The chicken is served with greens with a dressing that was too acidic for me, so I only had a couple of bites.  

The chicken is $26, which is expected given the location of Central.  Would I get this dish again?  Probably not.

We were joined by our respective families and seated promptly at a large round table in the sunny, airy dining room just off the Caesars' main lobby.  From this point on, our experience spiraled into the ground almost solely due to a series of missteps by our server.   Carol W recounted our difficulty in getting any drinks beyond water in her review.  Let me add that we got up from the table, went to the bar, and asked the bartender if she could make any cocktails regardless if they were on the list or not.  She could.  So, service strike #1.  I can say with 100% certainty that our server lost beer and alcohol sales to our party.  Since we had early evening dinner reservations for later that day, several people in our party asked how big portions were for several items on the menu.  Our server didn't impress us with his knowledge or familiarity with the menu as his estimates on portion size were dramatically off.  Service strike #2.  

I had the plain Goat Cheese Caesar ($18 for Total Rewards members/$19/add chicken $6, filet mignon $13).  It was a nice looking salad, not over-dressed or overly salty, and possessing good flavor.  However, IT WAS A SALAD without a protein on it and $18 was exorbitant for what I received.  While there wasn't a third service strike, the overall experience was hugely disappointing and not one to inspire me to return.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,3,1,2,5g9WxgDo0eo_IkClLc722w

Fresh Doughnut Holes Fried to Order with Vanilla, Chocolate, Raspberry Sauce

French Toast Crème Brulee

In a city that never sleeps where absentee landlord chefs abound Michel Richard's Central LV stands alone; a 24-Hour restaurant off the lobby of Caesar's Palace where one can theoretically order an item off any part of the menu at any time of day - at least according to the undisclosed person who answers their e-mail - though if you happen to ask for a Mille-Feuille /Napoleon at 6:15am you're certain to get a vacant look from one of the most lackadaisical and slow moving servers in all of Las Vegas followed by assertion that this dish is not on the breakfast menu.

Service, misinformation, and excessive pricing aside I will note that the two dishes I did receive after an inexplicable forty minute wait were actually quite good - the doughnut holes light and hot with each topping delicious, particularly when mixed, while the Crème Brulee French Toast was a textural masterpiece with caramelized bread sandwiching milky custard good enough to justify a ten dollar price tag, but certainly not a $17 one...even if I did save a few bucks in leaving a paltry tip for my server Alexander's total of four visits to the table during my 55 minute stay (menu drop, order, plate drop, check drop.)  Having visited both Richard's fine dining Citronelle and original Central in Washington DC I can only imagine the service at Central LV is Harrah's and not his doing; probably the pricing as well.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,0,2,NEBvKgA-sN6i6sbktVmERQ
5281964,2012-09-11,1,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"This food was nothing special...ESPECIALLY for the price!!!

I am sick and tired of places in Las Vegas making their prices astronomically high because they are in Las Vegas.  If you know Las Vegas well enough, you know better than to pay high prices for food very often because you have so many ways to get cheap or complimentary dinners.  

But Las Vegas is known to bring some of the best restaurants in the world to their city to get exposure by all of the tourists.  

Well, let the negative exposure persist for Central's by Michel Richard.  It's too bad too, considering this Chef Michael Richard put his name on a place that executes their food soo poorly.  Maybe someday I can try a dish made by him PERSONALLY and find out how amazing his dishes may be when made by only him.  

Got the croque madame, very mediocre, something I could have made myself.  Ordered a terrible cocktail with blood orange juice that was super sour, tart and lacked alcohol.

Appetizer crab cakes were plentiful and good to share between two people. The arugula on the side was a good complement.

For the entrée, he had scallops served atop some pasta and peas. 

I had the fish of the day, flounder with sautéed mushrooms and arugula. The flounder was uninspiring, a simple salt and pepper crust that was more soft than crunchy. The mushrooms and arugula were just a tad over salted. 

I probably wouldn't come back here on my own accord. There is better food for the same price. I'm not sure if I care for a $14 cocktail either. 

Service was great though... A thing I had not previously encountered: the restaurant used white napkins, but when the server saw we were wearing black, he brought us black napkins so we wouldn't get the little white threads on our clothing.

I had to flag down someone just to get some water.  FALE!

Food was moderate.  I had the spinach pesto with chicken.  It seemed like something was a bit off in how it was cooked and presented but the taste was ok.  Chicken was dry but still edible.  My friend got the salad and that looked much better and was much larger than I expected.

Then when it came time to pay we got to play the waiting game again.  I literally saw some guy at another table get equally fed up and hunt down the waiter so he could pay.  Yes... it was that bad.

To sum it up:  If you have places you need to be in a timely manner, avoid this place as time obviously doesn't apply to the wait staff here.  Food was average but nothing to write home about.

5323145,2014-01-15,2,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"I headed into Caesars, turning left into the lobby, where we grabbed a drink while waiting for some clients. The bar proved to be the facade for Central Michael Richard, where we were immediately told that they only carry two types of vodka (as opposed to Grey Goose, which we ordered) even though the shelves above the bar were laden with varieties. . .including Grey Goose. Figuring the bottles were solely accoutrements, we went about our business when our clients, famished, suggested we grab a bite at Central itself. 

It appeared to be a pseudo-upscale coffee shop, but was also empty. That, especially after the liquor snafu, should have been an indication of the without-a-soul nature of this restaurant, but we proceeded. Upon receiving the menu, I laughed audibly - French Onion soup is $19 ($18 with Caesars Total Rewards membership) and a house salad was $16 (again, a dollar off! with Rewards). My issue isn't so much with the prices; this is 'new' Vegas, and Michael Richard is a formidable chef so that's acceptable; what makes it so laughable is that a restaurant that's clearly a coffee shop - the menus are the laminated plastic like Denny's! - would charge this much for basic items. . .yet still offer a negligible discount. Very corny, very amateur.

Regardless, we ordered standard fare - burger, fries, chili cheese fries, the aforementioned salad, chicken tenders - and left with a $150 bill for six people, which included only the one drink. The food was average, but again - the inherent confusion in what they really want this restaurant to be was evident. They bring out the fries in a cute, mini grocery cart (eg Father's Office in L.A.), but accompany it with ketchup in a plastic cup. I mean, there were no porcelain ramekins? Nothing to match the cuteness of the cart? What a turnoff. 

The funniest part of the meal, though, was when they brought out the candles - it's funny that they have candles in a bright, mid-lobby venue that's clearly a coffee shop but. . .the candles were the electronic tea lights. You know, the ones that simulate flickering. How cheap/crappy can you get? And that's where those prices come in. Honestly, we were laughing over and over amongst ourselves, not least of all after finishing the tiny burger and chili cheese fries, both of which were 'small plate' portion sized.

I'm sorry, Caesars, you were my favorite hotel growing up and the new towers are passable in the modern era, but please eradicate this restaurant - or at least overhaul the place and do justice to Chef Richard - because it's a serious pockmark on what is a rapidly decaying property.",riETmgv8NnaNfTWhXc-XDA,3,1,2,CPRaePEHytssAeaPit6WSg

Currently they are only open til 4pm with the bar remaining open all hours.  Breakfast is served til 11 am and lunch til 4.  After Christmas Bistro 24 will reopen with many of the same people and a revamped menu.  

The bar is great for picking some cocktails on your way back to the room or a bottle of champagne to celebrate your winnings 

Centrally located across from the Caesars checkin. Bypass the Starbucks and have a cup of coffee and eat the stuffed French Toast which is their signature dish.

Most of the staff from Central will transfer over to Bistro 24.",vbXmCVj1RZ4civT7nrcKyw,1,0,4,EvTb6Ym56FgAueocr8oIHQ

The macaroni and cheese is so good here. Ahi tuna sandwich was excellent, and the chili cheese fries and strawberry sorbet were so good in the middle of the night. 


For breakfast we had the French toast and the All American Breakfast with scrambled eggs, potatoes and bacon. So good. Excellent service. Bar is open 24 hours for food and drink service, everything is available to go. Located right in the lobby of Caesars Palace.",H4HPzkK0pCJ3vQqZccPrag,2,0,5,6vJXn8kVNmkO3o08bO1UJQ

I came here for New Years Eve 2013 expecting to have a great time especially for what i am paying for it. to make a long story short it took close to two hours to get our meal. We got there at 10:30pm and ordered our food a few minutes later and we did not get our food until after the new years eve. We had to break our celebration to come sit down and eat a luke warm meal. i ordered a filet so unless they killed the cow there in the restaurant why would it take  two hours to get a medium steak with string beans.We addressed the manager Shanee Alexander or vice versa and she was not paying attention to our genuine complaints and had an attitude and pretty much told us our issues is not her concern. I have never seen an establishment handle customers in such manner. I will never recommend this place to anyone. You could get better service shopping in the frozen food section at walmart.",j9qiEiavSnYW-B55a8bQng,4,0,1,M7_koCH5nj0ipGQmmPPFMQ
5765771,2012-05-27,0,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"Staying at Caesars and wanted a late night meal at 2am.  This is their fancy new 24 hour restaurant that's conveniently located at the bottom of the elevator (near check in counter and Augustus/Octavian Towers).  We thought we'd just do take out as room service was going to take over 90 min estimate and nothing really looked that good anyway.  

When we got downstairs the hostess looked bored to death and pointed us to where we could order for take out. The menu looked fancy but a little pricey for a late night snack, but we ordered anyway.  We got the Denver omelet, crab cake sandwich (recommended by the bartender) fries, and mac & cheese.  It came out pretty quick, about 15 min. and took it to our room.  We were hungry, the food smelled good, and we thought the food was just mehhh.  The omelet was good, but needed salt.  It was very bland, actually.  The crab cake which was recommended wasn't that good and tasted frozen.  The texture was very rubbery, not something we'd order again.  The mac and cheese was probably the best thing ordered and we finished it off. 

I miss the old 24 hr restaurant of Caesars past.",o5PjjS1IxZ8rvBKSFZeM7Q,0,0,2,XFObQ2iaEBQErFd4pA8tgw
5767553,2012-02-04,0,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"Nicely decorated, airy and fun feeling, not dark and moody.  Great location inside Caesar's, you don't have to go through the whole labyrinth to eat and get outside.  Only sampled the appetizers, and some drinks.  So here it goes...

Gougeres, fluffy and tasty, these cheese tinged pastries were light and DE-lightful.

Bacon Onion Tartlet, like little mini-pizzas, love bacon and onion, but there was a slightly sweet white sauce on it that didn't quite complement the saltiness of the bacon, and the pastry was soggy.  Will have to give it another chance soon.

Pork Tenderloin Medallion with Corn Polenta.  This was a hit for me.  The polenta was creamy and rightly partnered with the savory, perfectly condimented pork tenderloin.  Gimme more.

With all the hoopla about pink stuff and other nasty bits in a fast food giant's chicken offering, the Fried Chicken Bites at Central Michel Richard are everything a bite-sized  morsel of chicken should be.  Croquante and light on the outside, tender flavorful chicken on the inside.  This is a sure to be popular with most anyone.  After all, how many people do you know who don't like chicken, or deep fried something?

The drinks of choice this evening were absinthe, which I must confess, I tasted more out of curiosity and the theme of the evening (going to see the show Absinthe).  Not a fan of licorice flavored anything, but putting my taste bud prejudices aside, it is smooth and goes down fairly easy.

The next drink was a pear sangria, garnished with strawberries and blueberries.  This was my choice for the evening, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Not as sweet as most sangrias, and very refreshing.  Paired perfectly with the appetizers.",btUugfufQAe-QD6gC_Ckmw,0,0,3,sj89e5V_eMDITJ4g6JsYWA
5792122,2012-02-03,0,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"I went to Central on a Tuesday morning. I was initially going to Café Lago but they were remodeling the entire place so it was out only choice for Brunch at 11am at the Caesars Palace!!

Atmosphere 2/5: Nothing special for the experience overall given to the customer. The decor is quite generic and cold inside. I was really impressed by it and I think there are better places in Las Vegas.
Food 3/5: Food was descent. I had a Croque-Madame with substitution of Salmon instead of Ham. It was good, not the best meal I ever had but it was a filler definitely. The presentation was a little bit too naive for a restaurant like that and the price was a little bit expensive for the overall experience you get out of it.
Service 0/5: The service was bad! The server brought us water after taking our orders, having our initial drink on table, after 20 min here, then he finally came back to bring us water but instead of apologizing, he asked us in a way if we still wanted water?! Really?! The food took forever to come and they were not busy. 

Overall, even if I had a better service, I would not go back at Central simply because I think that you can have way better quality food, better service on the strip for a Brunch.",L4S915BUVypnswOLWUWlYw,2,0,2,iOHeh0ZM7slwnwjAsMJowA
5838047,2014-07-15,3,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"It was after 11:00 p.m. for this dinner.  So we had to order from the more limited late night menu.  But it still has some fine choices.

This time I opened with an appetizer of Mac 'n Cheese that was okay, and a French Onion Soup with miso stock that was very tasty.  But after savoring the soup, I moved from hot and cheesy to cool and crunchy, with a big Chinese Chicken Salad that contained fried wontons, lovely strips of moist, pure white chicken meat, carrots, cabbage, and candied peanuts.  The entree salad was light and refreshing.  In fact, so much so that I ordered a second after consuming the first.  Meanwhile, Diane ate Pasta Carbonara with cheerfully provided extra Parmesan Sauce.  But she did not like the dish very much. 

I am retaining the five-star rating, because I did not sample the Pasta Carbonara; everything I ate was delicious; and service was again exemplary and accommodating.  The price for a late night meal was somewhat steep, but I largely brought this on myself by not eating enough for lunch and then ordering a really unnecessary second salad.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,3,5,2zhLD6lOqftmPamrXoetcQ

Tuesday night and very busy but we were seated immediately and iced water was quickly provided. Wow! Best meal I have had in a while , very good server , he knew everything about everything on the menu.
I had 6 oysters , served on ice with 2 sauces , beautiful. I then had a medium cooked rib eye with mushrooms . Outstanding! It's a meal fit for wearing sweatpants although the restaurant is far too nice for that comfortable attire. Wifee had Mozza ball (I'm not sure that's how it's spelled ) soup and fresh fish , flakey , perfectly cooked. Very nice cold Chardonnay and red wine with steak , lovely breads before the meal. Will I be back? You can bet your life. Oh..and Elton was brilliant , far better than the Red Piano show.

I can't believe that Cesar's is allowing this place in their hotel.  It's expensive and terrible!!! There were four of us and we all agreed.  I'm writing this sitting at the Bellagio coffee shop. We are eating breakfast here because we won't go back to Central! The breakfast at Bellagio is better and cheaper.

5892298,2014-09-20,0,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"I ordered the mushroom and Gruyere cheese omelette.  it was very filling and not too cheesy - just the right amount so it wasn't overpowering.  I asked for veggies instead of the potatoes and the only thing they would give me were sliced raw tomatoes.  if I wanted anything else (I asked for broccoli) i was going to have to pay for a full side order.  so I stuck with the tomato which was disappointing.  it also came with 2 pieces of toast and one small jar of jelly.  I hate that.  And I didn't even get to choose what kind of jelly.  they just had a jar of grape on the plate when they dropped it off.  But the omelette hit the spot and started my day off right.

The place was really busy so the service was okay but it took way too long to get the bill.  I was by myself and the hostess offered a magazine which I thought was a really nice touch.",luoidj4uPysXg2rbQCEcjQ,0,0,3,HZJ_RnAs-3Diz-ugLRhhbA

The Onion Soup is a Must!  Easily the best onion soup that I have ever had, very flavorful, and vegetarian at that!  The burger, they have  a few, but we are talking beef here, was great.   There is a crisp potato & onion concoction that tops the burger giving it a wonderful crunch and flavor.

5973626,2013-03-14,0,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"A friend and I came for the 2013 Restaurant Week menu and since there were 2 options for the appetizer, entree, and dessert- we ordered one of everything and shared.  

We started with the Roasted Beet Salad which comes with arugula and a piece of breaded goat cheese.  I love beets so I loved everything about this dish.  The other appetizer was Tuna Carpaccio with Soy Vinaigrette.  This was filled with so much flavor and topped with jicama a tiny beads of puffed rice.  

The entrees were a Pan Seared See Bass with dill fingerling potatoes and lime beurre blanc. Mmmmmm.  The sea bass was cooked perfectly and the sauce was absolutely delectable.  After I finished my half of fish and potatoes, I was tempted to grab a piece of bread to soak up every last drop of the sauce.  But I restrained myself because I had the half of the Rotisserie Chicken with vegetable stack to dig into.  My friend had eaten the breast portion, and when she passed the thigh to me, I sliced into it and noticed that it was very undercooked.  I brought this to the attention of the waitress and she apologized and had it fixed immediately.  No problem, my friend and I continued on with great conversation and I had a chance to digest the huge servings of food that I already consumed.  When the new dish came out piping hot, I was very impressed that the restaurant manager came to the table to offer his apologies as well (and a discount on that meal).  Very nice touch. 

The dessert offerings were an caramelized upside-down cake with tart cherry sauce and mango sorbet. This was perfectly sweet and delicious.  The other dessert was a caramel cheesecake with feuilletine crust.  My eyes almost popped out when I saw how huge the slice was.  I was already so full from the gastronomical adventure but managed to take a few bites of this delectable and rich dessert. If I had space I would have devoured just the crust alone, it was sooooooo good.  

Another very successful restaurant week selection! The restaurant itself is very spacious and open. I would love to return and try other items.  I also know that if I have a craving at 2 in the morning, I can always go there because it is open 24 hours! The bar area is also spacious and looks like a fun spot to grab a drink.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,2,2,4,c9skff_IGN6bI-I1hs9Bsg
5985510,2013-12-30,0,BjLXhrKdB3I3f3ODy0INRw,"Dined here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday.  There were a few tables dining also, but it wasn't super busy.  We were on a time crunch as part of the group was going to a show at 9:30pm, but dinner turned out well.  I had a very light dinner, which was the goat cheese Caesar salad.  It was very good!  Though it was structured like a wedge salad (which I am not a big fan of), the taste was incredible.  The goat cheese was a bit tart, but was also very smooth and creamy.  The flavor meshed well with the rest of the salad, and was a healthy portion, as I shared it with my bf.  (We had a very heavy lunch.)  

Good location, but can be confusing, as some people refer to it as ""Central at Caesar's"", while some call it ""Michel Richard"".  Seems to be open all day, and is conveniently located right across from Caesar Palace's hotel registration.  (It's the only eatery in the area, so getting lost is almost impossible.)",xhoo5RxotqYBIQGzmwvVPw,0,0,4,VNhxaayxR3M3WlbSjxPQig
