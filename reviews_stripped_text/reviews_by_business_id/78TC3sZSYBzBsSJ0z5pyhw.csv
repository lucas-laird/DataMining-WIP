We asked, is the soup vegetarian?  I'll check, said the waitress.

Then I watched as her fat ass basically stood around yapping with the other servers.  Meanwhile, we had no bread.  We asked, then the service came by and plopped a tiny piece of bread on each of our bread plates.  Umm, leave the basket you twit.

Then the soup (for my wife) just shows up.  I say don't eat it, I guarantee it's chicken stock.  We ask the waitress.. oh yah, oh yah, I asked.  So then I ask a clueless looking, but helpful younger busboy - he says he'll go find out.  Comes back and says, CHICKEN STOCK.

On top of all that we had to listen to the fat bitch sing some awful garbage.

My own food was only mediocre.

The hostess responsed by saying ""because you were not standing behind the rope."" I explained to her that we sat there because at the time when we first got there the line was long. The hostess was rude and instead of offering to seat us she continued to argue with us that because we were not standing behind the rope that was why we were not seated.

It took forever to get anything done- our order, our appetizers, and our main course.  I think it took at least 45 minutes to get our appetizers and another 45 minutes to get our main course.  We could see our main courses sitting under the heat lamps for at least 15 minutes and the food was consequently overcooked and terrible.  We would have eaten better food at McD's, but at $30-40 per person, this was completely atrocious.

 We had a delightful meal here after my foodie father recommended the place. We were seated immediately and our server took our drink order right away. This was quickly followed by a basket with a variety or fresh breads with and olive oil and vinegar dipping sauce. My partner and his friend opted for the pris fixe menu and had salads (one caesar, one house) and salmon. I am an occasional fish eater who has always had a dislike for salmon. I tried a bite of my partner's salmon and I must say it was the best I have ever tried. I ordered the calamari and putanesca flat bread for the table and both were delicious. The calamari was very lightly breaded and cooked to perfection. Unlike previous reviews we had mounds of calamari to  the green beans. I ordered the angel hair pomodoro and while it wasn't the best I've had, it was good. 

Our waiter was very attentive without being intrusive, and provided what I consider to be above average service. 

We only had to sit through one song performed by a waitress. While her voice was very good and I liked her song, the microphone amplified her voice too much and was too loud. Thankfully that did not go on too long and we were quickly back to our delicious meal.

The food. It was fine. Nothing great, nothing terrible. The garlic bread was OK while the accompanying marinara was bordering on unpleasant. My Rigatoni Bolognese was unremarkable, it is hard to criticize something that has no remotely defining feature whatsoever.

The wine. OK but overpriced.

The service. We came away with the vague sense that our waiter wouldn't have cared if we showed up or not. He did everything he should have, but very much by rote. 

So far this is very much a three star review. Nothing horrific but certainly nothing fantastic either. So why a one star review? Why the Yelp equivalent of 'run, run for the hills!'

But the worst of all was that the manager seen completely but completely overwhelmed with this situation. The manager never came back to the table again. All we got was credits for the food and one was still on the bill at first.

I just want to let you know that I will never go back.

My escargots were very disappointing, first of all they came without their shells (you would NEVER see escargots served without their shells in a Parisian restaurant), they seemed to be washed too quickly and were mixed in a weird over creamy sauce that made them taste even chewer...

We had the Caesar salad to start, and the dressing was really good. We decided to order the Bouillabaisse for 2. The presentation was impressive being served in a very large cauldron, but the shell fish was small and the fish was tough.

Alas, we ate here because we'd been walking for two hours in and around the Strip's hotels desperately trying to find something - anything - that could accommodate a vegetarian and a vegan. (As you may have heard, this is quite a feat in Vegas, which bewilders me since it's a major metropolitan *touristy* city, and it's effin' 2008!!! I mean would it kill these restaurants to offer one or two veggie-based dishes on their respective menus??? I'm not asking for anything fancy. You don't need to make me seitan. You don't even have to know what seitan is! But if you could get me some butterless-cheeseless vegetables either grilled, steamed, wrapped up in a tortilla, served alongside a carby-dish or as the dish *itself,* I swear, I would stop complaining and be ever-so-grateful. Oh, and stop adding meat and/or mayo to every salad. It's a SALAD, people. It's supposed to be mostly *green.*)

/tangent.

Ahh, Le Provencal.  We were so happy to see that you carried Gnocchi and Capellini Pomodoro, we didn't even care that it was total price gouging. We were *ecstatic* when we asked the waiter if the noodles had any egg and he checked and reported back ""no, you're safe."" Praise Jeebus!

....And then we waited almost 40 minutes for the plates to arrive. In the meantime a Bread Maiden (go and you'll understand) arrived with two delicately-sliced baguette morsels for our bread plates (generous, no?) and even went so far as to pour the oil and vinegar into our extra bread plate for us. Without asking. Which I hate. Hospitality is one thing, but shouldn't you ASK if we're interested in getting dipping oil? Especially if you're going to make like Exxon Valdez and fill the plate with 97% oozing oil (and only 3% vinegar). ::sigh::

Just as I was feeling faint from my overwalking and undereating, the food arrived. COVERED in shaved Parmesan cheese. This, after having no mention of cheese on the menu whatsoever. ...I swear, I almost burst into tears. I almost picked up the plate and threw it at our haughty-ultra-wannabe-French waiter in a fit of blinding rage. Luckily Justin, recognizing just by my changing expression that his girlfriend had just reverted to her 5 year-old self and was about to have a major meltdown, came to the recuse. In one swift movement he picked up two forks and pulled the top cheese-offending portion of my capellini off of my plate and onto his own, all the while murmuring ""it's ok, it's ok.... look! there, done!"" Bless my boyfriend. He saved me from having to throw down like Flava Flav's crazy reject, New York. And he also saved the waiter from receiving a serious head injury.

So why three stars and not less? Actually, I'm not sure. We spent way too much money, way too much time waiting, the order wasn't right, and I froze in the overly aggressive air conditioning. Yet it was a cute place, and once the cheese was out of sight, my pasta wasn't bad. Plus they were quick to refill our drinks. Still, unless I was well-off and desperate for something edible, I doubt I'd return. Consider my review more like 2.5 stars. And also consider me generous. And blonde.

There were 12 of us in our party for an early dinner (as were going to catch The Jersey Boys). We were seated promptly and served refreshments. Lovely. We were served warm bread and olive oil/balsamic vin for dipping. Our server had an 'accent' (although not Italiani) that added to the ambience : ). Liked the airy big room with soft bright lights that accentuated the pseudo rustic/modern look. The place seemed clutter-free, a rest for thine eyes from the busyness of the Paris mall and everywhere else in Vegas.

Our party ordered an assortment of entree ranging from salmon scampi, linguine with seafood, oxtail risotto (not crazy about that), bouillabaisse, and I ordered the roasted chicken with au jus and fingerling potatoes. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The sauce tasted like the au jus was infused with some wine reduction and awakened with some roasted garlic and garnished with some garlic slivers and micro greens. Loved it!

Now for dessert: I loved the Chocolate, Nogatine, Praline - I would go there just to get the dessert.  It was nicely done with the roasted hazelnuts, the dark chocolate masquerading the silky, creamy chocolate with ribbons of the nougat and the subtle praline in the bottom.  Yummmm!  Reminded me a bit of the Viking of Extraordinary desserts (that's another topic).  One of our friends ordered the symphony and I got to sample Le Opera torte and I thought it wasn't bad at all. Almost like what we did back in culinary school.  Bravo for the desserts I got to try.

First off, the wait was only ten minutes for a Thursday evening; fabulous! Everywhere else was at least an hour. The host was very friendly and was very prompt to seat guests. First impression: very old school fine dining French style restaurant with an open kitchen. The smells drafting through the restaurant were that of sweet bread baking at that moment. We were greeted by Francisco an Lupita with drink preferences, the evening specials, and that fresh bread I could smell baking. 
I ordered the crab cake and the lobster bisque soup over lobster ravioli for my boyfriend. When they arrived I wish I would have ordered the soup! Nothing against the crab cake because that was perfectly delicious with its crispy exterior along with a mushroom and sun- dried tomato reduction. The soup was just phenomenal! Not too salty like most tend to be. The ravioli were a great touch.  Even better with bread dipping! 
For dinner came the Veal scallopini with an asparagus-mushroom sauce over mashed potatoes. My friends had the filet Mingnon with bordelaise sauce and the king crab legs (which were completely over priced at $60 for a pound but were still good quality and taste), and sides of spaghgetti with marinara sauce. The steak was a little over cooked, more like medium  than medium rare but still delicious with the flavorful sauce. My veal was Amazing! A bit heavy on the salt for me would be my only criticism.  Perfectly satisfying!
The entire time Lupita and Francisco were there for our every need and were nothing but smiles and kindness!

My friends and I were looking for a good meal for dinner before we hit the town during Memorial Day weekend, and my buddy wanted a sit down restaurant while I wanted to grab something on the go (Le Creperie next door sounded so good). But we ended up choosing this place. 

We split the escargot and the calamari for appetizers, and I ordered the Sun-dried tomato chicken pesto flatbread with a side of penne mariana since I was told the portions here were on the small side (which is somewhat expected in Vegas). My flatbread came out what seemed like an hour after I ordered, and the it was very bland, had little flavor, and was lukewarm. I could not even taste the pesto, and the chicken itself was very dry. I figure that the pizza was left on the counter over the heating lamps for a long time before they brought it out. The side pasta dish was not that interesting either, the penne pasta was definitely overcooked and the sauce itself was very much like a canned tomato sauce with some pepper flakes added to it. Kinda made me regret coming here for dinner when it did was nothing to brag about.

Service here was very slow and almost kind of snooty. Because we were a group of college kids, we had to split our bill. Although I appreciated our waiter doing that for us, we had already tipped properly and started to leave until the waiter flagged me down and asked if we had tipped yet and reviewed the receipt with me. Of course we tip at any restaurant, why wouldn't we? Even if service was terrible, I would still tip the right amount. This really put a damper on my mood. Overall, I don't expect to come to this place anytime again, but I will definitely try the crepes next door or the buffet across from us next time I am in Paris.",WEd_LPrAnsXlzm6S8WbwKw,3,0,1,8cPKRUrf4yT6kGykw3LZ0g

Alas my Dad was dead set on going here bc of his grumbling tummy and dislike for walking anymore. Finally we get seated...scarf down the bread (which was pretty yummy - nice, soft and chewy). They had this special set menu which 2 people got (appetizer of soup or salad, entree of fish, pasta, or chicken, and a desert of sorbet and cookies). I just ordered the Nicoise salad bc I wasn't too hungry and someone else got the tuscan white bean soup and salad. The food wasn't mindblowing but the key here is I think I got exactly what I paid for - hence the A-OK. It wasn't expensive, the food was tasty (I actually really enjoyed the salad and wished it was a tad bigger, the soup was a bit salty, but the pasta was yummy and the salmon was cooked well), pretty good sized portions and service (after the line) was great.

3438003,2012-11-20,0,78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw,"We used a groupon here and figured it would be an excuse to hang out on the strip. I'm not quite sure why it's described as a ""french"" restaurant on yelp because its certainly Italian. They offer a selection of antipasti and pizza napoletano...so I think that is an error.

Anyway, we were seated immediately near a corner fountain. The interior is somewhat nice and our waitress was friendly. We decided to share one of the three course meals because we figured it would be enough food for two moderate appetites and we were indeed correct.

 They started us out with mussels simmered in a marinara flavored sauce. They were chewy and well flavored-- I really have no complaints about them other than that the sauce seemed a bit runny by the time they got to us. We gobbled them up in no time and soon were treated to the new york strip steak. 

We had chosen garlic potatoes and fettucine alfredo as our sides. Both were adequate-- I liked that the potatoes had just a hint of garlic flavor to them and weren't overpowering. The fettucine was cooked just right-- not too soggy. The sauce was a bit light but this was welcome.  As for the steak itself, it was cooked perfectly and had an even medium rare red strip throughout the body. This is typical of new york steaks of course, because the consistency of the meat does not vary appreciably throughout the cut. The seasoning was similar to what I've had when ordering steak at other italian restaurants.

The dessert however, really impressed me. We chose the Tiramisu and I honestly can't remember the last time I had some as good as this. I'm assuming they bake it in house but if not, I'd sure like to find out where they got it from.

Bottom line: We had a favorable experience here and with our groupon we were very satisfied with the value recieved. I would rate them as a 3.5--they fall just short of a 4 because I ultimately didn't feel they had a standout quality that would make me return to pay full price here. No complaints about service, food was cooked well, dessert was the highlight.

After we ordered our dishes (Mashroom risotto, calamari, escargo) it took over an HOUR (I am not exaggerating) to bring just an apetizer.

They were able to accommodate her, in that she was able to choose the items (a salad,soup, and dessert)  that weren't meat based and they would charge her the la carte price. 

The food was certainly not the best that I've had. I had their tomato soup, which was rich in texture and taste. My entree was a chicken medallion wrapped with prosciutto with other side dishes. The chicken was so dry and ruined my appetite. There was nothing on the dish that could have made it less dry so I ended up not finishing it. Their dessert was an assortment of sweets. There were macaroons, chocolate mousse cakes, and a jello type dessert. I can only comment on the mousse cake, which was delicious. It was just the amount of sweet.

The meal was OK.  For starters, they brought a bread basket with a small loaf of Italian bread and two breadsticks.  The server poured some olive oil and balsamic onto a dish for dipping.  Since I'm not a big fan of balsamic, which I think is too sweet, I liberally sprinkled my dipping mixture with salt to cut the sweetness.  The bread was fresh and tasty.

I ordered the lobster bisque for an appetizer.  It had a lobster flavor but there were no pieces of lobster to be found.  There were two ravioli on the bottom of the bowl that may have had some type of ground lobster filling but there was no flavor of lobster from the ravioli.

For the main course, I ordered the New York strip steak and frites.  I also ordered a side of wilted spinach.  I ordered the steak black and blue and I specified extra rare.  The meat was done more than that but it was acceptable.  I wish they'd just do black and blue.  You can't un-cook meat but you can heat it some more if it's too rare.  The steak was a bit tough to cut, but it was OK to eat.  Perhaps they need better steak knives?  The spinach came with lots of freshly sliced garlic and was very good.

For dessert, I ordered the crème brûlée.  It was different than I've had before.  My server told me to make sure I spooned to the bottom.  This brûlée had a layer of semi-sweet chocolate on the bottom and then the vanilla bean crème with the glazed top.  There were some blueberries and a 1/2 strawberry on top.  Dessert was very good.

Service was very good.  My server, Frank and his bus person, Umberto, were on top of things.  Iced tea was refilled without asking and Frank came often to check on how I was doing and to see if I needed anything.  I was greeted promptly at the podium and the woman asked me if I had any comp, coupon, Groupon or anything else like that.  When I said Groupon, she told me to make sure I showed it to the server.

At the end of the meal, Frank asked me if I would take a short survey they were doing.  There were at most 10 questions with an excellent to poor scale to rate various aspects of dining at Le Provençal.  It was actually a 32 gb iPod in a large case so you didn't pocket it and walk out the door.

The restaurant is a little pricey.  Comparing it to Mon Ami Gabi, I'd go with Gabi for the entire experience.  I'm glad I gave this place a try.  It was a pleasant experience and a fairly good meal.

I had the seafood linguine. I was bummed two clams weren't open. I am not of the school that will go ahead and open them anyway. I couldn't risk getting sick. But the rest of the seafood was great. I liked the three large shrimp best of the clams and mussels also in the dish. What sold me was the claim the sauce had 8 tomatoes in it. I love tomatoes and the sauce was nicely playing up the flavors of the seafood as well as the basil.

Service was great, the wait staff provided the ladies with dark napkins so we could be lint free.

It's like Max's Opera Cafe but called something else with different food.  That was an interesting and unexpected touch.  Our waitress didn't sing though, so I dunno if they all do, or just some.
The service was lukewarm but fairly efficient (we only had to ask for water once).  I started off with the bruschetta which was much sweeter than any other bruschetta I've had (clearly from the balsamico they used) and the bread was harder than diamonds.  I had to send it through a wood chipper before I could manage to bite down on it.  The bread they serve at the table is soft and delish though, so if you're thinking you want to kick your meal off with bread, I might just stick with that.
From there I moved on to the goat cheese and spinach ravioli.  Served in a yummy, tangy pink sauce, I don't know how they get away with putting spinach in the name of the dish.  It was goat cheese ravioli (I wonder if they were house made, or just under cooked - they were incredibly firm on the edges), with a few wilty pieces of spinach on top in the sauce.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but this dish was too. . . . 
??  Salty?  Intense?  Rich?  I'm not sure.  But I could only eat half, and where goat cheese is concerned that is totally unlike me.
The mamacita's minestrone also featured undercooked beans, which meant she only ate half of her meal as well.

Watch the veggies and meat there! Another reviewer got sick there 3 days before we got there. Read the yelp right here and save yourself.

We waited a surprising amount of time just to be seen and sat at a table (there was no wait) and to order our food for as small a restaurant that it is. It definitely took way too long to receive our food. There was something that didn't take long at all and that was the time it took me to get the drinks I ordered. Those came out in no time flat which I found interesting.
The staff was friendly and polite but if they ask 'Would you like me to bring some garlic bread for the table?' keep in mind that this costs money! It is not free like most Italiano restaurants. However, the bread was really yummy.
I had the ceaser salad (also very yummy and not drowning in dressing) and the proscuitto flatbread. The outer parts of the flatbread were super tough and hardly edible. The middle part - where the toppings were was cooked just fine and it was good. If I ever stay at Paris again I doubt I will go back to this place...there is just so many other options.",r30--fYnQRoGolA6pq7yUQ,0,0,2,-BRMgvI45cR4Skw6z_l6Dw

My friend and I stumbled upon Le Povencal, after visiting 5 other casino's and we were pleasantly surprised. We didnt have to wait, even though it was saturday night. The hostess greeted us warmly and was very polite.
The service was great. I wasn't expecting to have personalized service in Vegas, especially in a hotel. I can't remember our servers name, but she said she had worked there for several years. She accomodated any and all of our requests (food allergy substitutions, wine reccomendations ect..) with an upbeat, friendly, and knowledgable manner. She was an absolute delight and really made our night! To top it off, we had the pleasure of her singing with another male server. What a treat, dinner and a show!
The food was delish! The jumbo cheese ravioli with brown butter is amazing! The cheese antipast platter was perfect. The Caprese fresh and delightful! Even the house salad was great.

The ceasar salad was one half of a heart of romaine lettuce cut all the way down the middle including the core (yuck). We had to cut that off & then cut up the 'salad' to make it eatable. 45-55 minutes into the meal we get the veal we ordered as the main entree & unfortunately it had an odd taste to it so I couldn't finish mine.

I decided we should try this place out for dinner since this was located right in our hotel.

Upon arriving we were greeted by the hostess and seated immediately. We looked over the menu as we sat and waited for our server to come to take our order.

By this time we are ready to order but our server has disappeared.

Finally after about another 10-15 minutes our server arrives and finally takes our order. My wife ordered the Creamy Chicken Penne with Pesto and I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara. When the meals arrived we started eating within a few moments my wife and I began looking at each other like we had telekineses. Both understanding from our facial expressions that neither of our pastas were awesome.

After a few moments of reading each other's mind we asked each other how did we like our respective meal. My wife went first and said her pasta and the chicken was bland and only had flavor because of the pesto. I too told her that my pasta was bland and I even forgot that my dish even came with bacon because it was buried at the bottom of the dish. Sigh.

I feel that because this is an italian restaurant they should have executed the pasta meals flawlessly in taste. They did fine in presentation but not so much with the actual taste.

4 stars for the service - hostess was sweet and let us sit at the table on the ""balcony/patio"" and got it cleaned up quickly, efficient and friendly server, but minus a star for having to wait a while for the food.

2 to 3 stars for the food - while I wanted to love it, there were parts that I did and parts that I didn't. I ordered one of the fixed menus with the white bean soup, the parmesan crusted chicken with potatoes and artichokes, and coconut/raspberry sorbet. The soup had great flavor but was way too salty. I actually couldn't really eat it because it was too salty but I figured it was mass produced so it wouldn't do any good to send it back. The chicken was very good - a little greasy, but I really liked the sauce and flavor to it. What I did NOT like was the potatoes which we all agreed were undercooked and completely hard and crunchy. The sorbet was great - loved the raspberry but didn't eat the coconut. I don't love the idea of that combination but maybe it's someone else's cup of tea. The price was decent, I suppose, for 3 courses - it was $28 per person for the fixed menu. Oh, and it included a beverage - ie. a glass of wine or soda. We were going to order the chicken but saw that it was actually the same price to order the menu and get 2 additional courses so it was a good deal.

The decor - Like many others, I'm confused as I couldn't tell if this was supposed to be a French or Italian restaurant - but what we ended up ordering appeared to be ""none of the above."" I can't comment much since I don't think I stepped a foot inside since we were seated on the balcony, but I did like the balcony area.

My meal consisted of soggy fat drenched translucent french fries, an over cooked tough as leather ""new york strip"" and a wilted salad. By far the best part of the meal was the pre meal bread even though the olive oil a balsamic vinegar where substandard (bread was OK) 
Normally I would have sent my meal back, but judging form the rest of the food served at our table there would have not been much point on doing so
.I have had GREAT dining experiences in Vegas for the same price or less. Do yourself a favor and EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE",BWKltdDGXPw_s2SgOe60Hw,0,0,1,6I-NKUCKmjavauQumbmEmg

Yes, it comes off as a gourmet restaurant and does have upscale pricing on many of the menu items, but I am just going to review off our 1 sole experience.

We had Le Provencal special. $28 per person/special
Choice of Caesar Salad, Salad Le Provencal (Mixed Green Salad), or Tuscan White Bean Soup.
Choice of entree: 
Parmesan Crusted Chicken
Grilled Salmon Fillet ""Scampi""
Capellini Pomodoro
Spaghetti Carbonara
Choice of house white or red wine.
Dessert - Raspberry and Coconut sorbet.

It's supposed to be Tuscan style food. I'm not so sure of this but it was good nonetheless.

The decor was nice. We were seated by the fountain against the wall, which contributed to the atmosphere.
There was a classical guitar player that did several nice renditions of popular tunes done a la classical guitar style, nice touch.

The house wine - I can't remember the brand or year.
I had the Cabernet Sauvignon, my date had a Chardonnay.
The Cabernet was flavorful and smooth.
The Chardonnay was dry. Both were pretty decent.

The Tuscan White Bean Soup, savory and a nice portion - pretty good. 4 stars
Caesar Salad, very garlic-y and a nice portion, also good. 4 stars

Parmesan Crusted Chicken - Unlike places that bread the hell out of the chicken breast. It was nice that you could tell the chicken breast was crusted with actual parmesan. It had that nice crunch, not the kind you get with cornmeal or panko breading.
The fingerling potatoes were nice and crisp.
All covered in the artichoke and mushroom ragout -pulled the dish together as a whole. It was a very complementary dish.
Also a very large portion, you get 2 breast pieces. 3.5 stars

Grilled Salmon Fillet ""Scampi"" - Flavorful and tender salmon filet, garlic mashed potatoes and blanched asparagus. This dish was also very complementary, the mashed potatoes went perfectly with the salmon. The asparagus was a little too crunchy for me, but I know some ppl prefer that. 4 stars.

Raspberry and Coconut sorbet 
A small scoop of each with a ribbon of dark chocolate on a bed of freeze-dried ice cream?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-dried_ice_cream
I believe that's what it was, kinda chalky but melts in your mouth.
The sorbet was good and actually went really well with the chocolate. Not sure what I think of the freeze-dried ice cream but it did give it added texture.

Overview:
I'm giving this place 4 stars for the 1 time experience.
Service - 4 stars
Value - 4 stars
Ambiance - 4 stars

Lots of little morsels in a creamy sauce with a hint of licorice or anise or? Just fabulous. So we stop here when in the area for a lunch of escargot, some crusty bread and a couple glasses of crisp wine.  Don't know if they deserve the stars for this one dish...but they are heaven.",Q3Y0AjsTpuJuQ-TWZOlVzg,1,0,3,rJVfmAhd7lJ5CL1E0JI_lQ

You need to try their chocolate mousse, their prices are not bad either, we order off the prix fixe menu and were VERY surprised on how wonderful everything tasted, service was great, courteous and quick, will go back over and over.",Q3vl1Btm5DRh_GeGx132rQ,0,0,4,lOJYeglqzGzj6n3XmLlBnA
5763386,2014-04-01,0,78TC3sZSYBzBsSJ0z5pyhw,"We had a good, if somewhat overpriced meal at this restaurant. The service was very good, even considering we had a singing waiter who serenades the house a few times during our meal. I had chicken piccata, which was generously portioned. Others had steak and a pasta pesto dish, which both enjoyed. Waiters are savvy and will encourage items to increase your bill. In all an enjoyable meal at the lovely fake Paris.",-UNiI2msWREUHJ8WuJ7PsQ,0,0,3,d6Tuf9AfJnaeD3sOlHZlbQ

I visited this restaurant with my boyfriend last year after he recommended it to me.  I had the sea bass ($28) & instantly fell deeply in love with it.

This year, we visited this place again for my friend's birthday.  I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass (different from last year), which came with Gnocchi, olives, and sun-dried tomatoes - very delicious ($28).  My boyfriend got the Rib-Eye Steak - also fantastic ($38)!  The server was attentive & very friendly.  She and the other servers did a great job surprising my friend with a birthday song (opera-style) & cake.  

Also, every now & then... one or two servers will perform a wonderful opera number :)",11f-LcmU54IIf-HUqMDeBg,1,1,4,MBdoV2N5oQ83mo4WPJip1w

The portions are pretty small and their prices are very large. Service is slow but friendly. Prices are very high for the quality even by Vegas standards. Grab a slice of pizza at the place next door.",0w3mw08YAa6HJSpNKIBuvA,0,0,2,A2Q-NyIxZ9LEqSJ3cHB4vQ
