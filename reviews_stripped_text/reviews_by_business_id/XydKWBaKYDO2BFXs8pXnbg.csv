Every mcdonalds is pretty consistant but when I ate here, the bread was hard, the burger was messy, and one of the worst big mac I've ate.

I've been here a bunch of times but rarely check in, which is the case with most fast food places if & when I visit. Never been inside here, strictly drive-thru. The service is very good & the staff is always polite. Yes, I will definitely be back the next time I'm craving a Big Mac & delicious sweet tea or whenever the Mcrib is in town or during March for the shamrock shake ;b",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,0,0,3,l4deffXeKQwkPVo-JbrGug

I mean I have no expectations really for fast food, in fact my only expectation is shitty service but this place goes beyond bad. In addition the playarea is always disgusting. I saw a kid puke on the floor and they put up the yellow wet floor signs and went back to the cash register. Other times like today a table looked like a vegas buffet tornado had touched down scattering fries and chunks of burger everywhere. Hey yah know what pick up after your kids people, two minutes thats all and make your hellions help. But still even though the parents shoulda cleaned up, god knows how long its been sitting there trashed. The syrup was out on EVERYTHING, no joke! I told the manager and he did nothing.

The man was demanding they call the police.  The crew behind the counter were acting as if he wasn't even there.  The manager never came out to handle the situation. Every person needs to be treated like a human. This McDonald's crew choose to act as if this man was invisible.  The man kept on telling them to say something, stop acting like he's invisible.  This is a very sad and pathetic attitude demonstrated by this McDonald's.  Shame on the crew and the manager.",xaCbry4lT-DSksD1QBD48g,4,0,1,0zirySZ-Bt0DurnGZH4dLg

I patiently waited for 10 minutes or more for my order and another 5 for the ice cream they forgot to give me for my kid. One thing is waiting because it's busy another is poor customer service.

3529464,2016-04-28,0,XydKWBaKYDO2BFXs8pXnbg,"There are two things that make this place above average. The first is the play place. It is big and spacious but the netting makes it easy to spot kids without having to scale the thing. There is a toddler area with a separate entrance. I have toddlers and a lot of these places just have a few climbing toys at the foot of the stairs which means a lot of chances for your kid to get stepped on by bigger kids. 
The second thing, is the staff. Specifically, Meylissa. There are two kinds of fast food employees in my experience, the kind that hand you single ketchup packets and individual napkins like they have to pay for them out of pocket, and the kind that give you extra napkins because you have kids with you.  She also brought outer tray into the play area, which is really helpful when you don't want to leave your kids to grab their food.",Wvox6LO8VKmSS9ym9PEazw,0,0,4,vhuy3p7DMKdXh6MIzHGIcQ

This is the location where they are consistently friendly and the COOKIES are always warm and freshly baked!
