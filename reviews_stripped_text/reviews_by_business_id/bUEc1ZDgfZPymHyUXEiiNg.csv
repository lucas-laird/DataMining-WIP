I can't remember why I skipped this one out of my Mexican food places but now I think I remember why. It's not that great but if you like a quick Mexican fix, this'll do.  The place is simple, service is fast, and it's fairly clean and decent place to have a quick lunch. I observe a lot of people coming for to goes but the time I was here, none stayed. Maybe its me?

More like cheese tomales sprinkled with a bit of meat. Also worth noting, I ordered polo and got beef. But the worst part has to be the constant jibber jabbering & laughing in espanol while I'm waiting for food. Were they laughing at me? Probably. It's ok though. I won't lose sleep over it Mijos.

I really don't appreciate having our time wasted waiting for an order that wasn't even made. We got our money back and just left. If I didn't think he'd spit in our food I would've asked for our meal to be free but I was just upset and hangry and was over it. Terrible experience. The cashier lady had good customer service, this was all the cooks fault. He literally skipped our order and made everybody else's.

I only ate it because we were hungry, it was late and at least it's not greasy spoon fast food.  The food was not the best quality as it did not hold up well by the time my mother brought me the meal, and she was not far away from the UMC where I was.  The tacos were cold, tasteless and the tortillas fell apart too easily when eating.  The vegetables in the taco did not taste like they were not at the peak of freshness even if they were still edible.  A good quality and fresh tortilla should be warm, soft and hold its shape as you eat it.  The red sauce was milquetoast.",5GPJYhFS9h71eb2Ow7Gj5w,0,0,1,zlXSrlHqgA_3IbNOh7bqbw

I have learned to take an early lunch at 10:00 AM in order to truly beat the rush.  Ordering and seating have never been an issue when stopping by.

Ha!  Looking at my previous I see my empty threat of saying I would not return.  I AM a slave to convenience.

Every order has been deliciously accurate.

The best part has been the customer service.  My little smug cashier is no more.  She smiles, is friendly and on my most recent visit called me by my first name.  JOY!  On that same visit, they were more than helpful when coworkers later called me to field an order.  The line was long, but one of the kind ladies slaving her ass on the girl saw me, asked me what I needed, I told her and by the time I made it to the front, the chow was waiting for me.

I instead found a deal for the breakfast burrito on Tuesday.  Got myself a breakfast log and a carne asada for the coworker.  Took awhile for them to get my order out.

Back in my office, I unwrapped my log and was amazed already by the size.  Took a bite and was burnt by the hotness.  Even though it took me 5-10 mins to get back, my log was still hot!  Awesome!  I am glad they packed it full of eggs, hash, bacon bits.  Everything tasted good; mainly because I was starving.

So, know that if you come here, you have to leave your car (gasp!), but their doors will always be open (there aren't many 24hr 'fast food' joints open in this area). This particular location is clean and has about 10 tables inside. I've never seen more than 2 tables being used. Taco Tuesday is $1 beef tacos (max 12). 

That being said, it's Roberto's. It tasted just like every other Roberto's. You can find a better version of everything on their menu somewhere else in this city. The question is, can you find it at 3am...",NRGJ4IvauajqqCbhT640cw,7,9,3,h495F_4gcven36dMO-EYYA

The food is always up to par; burritos taste like burritos, quesadillas taste like quesadillas, etc. Although the food is not absolutely amazing, it all still tastes great. There is also a complimentary salsa bar. There is a huge menu with daily specials, breakfast items, and desserts as well.

On my last visit here, I had a chicken burrito plate, which consisted of a chicken burrito, a side of rice, and a side of refried beans. Everything tasted like it was supposed to. Everything came nice and hot. The amount of food for the value of the meal makes it a great buy.

There is not a lot of parking here, but there is always some place to sit. There is a 50 cent charge for any credit/debit cards as well. This place is worth a visit for some good-quality, Mexican food.",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,0,0,4,i8NAO204IZmh9SurzNl5sw

Another Roberto's that meets my standards when I ask for what I want!! After having a hard morning & my annoying body had to satisfy my empty stomach after some exercises at PT. My stomach wanted some stinky queso!

As we walked in... all the chairs were on top of the tables & we thought the place was closing or something but they were only keeping the place spotless which I LOVE. The lady invited us in when we were hesitant & said ""don't worry its ok"" as we really didn't want to step on her hard worked mopped floors. Our cashier took our order he just had one facial expression but i assume he means we'll as his ACTION showed it much better. He HOOKED IT UP!

5 ROLLED TACOS - my goto as I like it unhealthy & order it w/ no lettuce & extra cheddar & ENCHELADO that stinky one! The Bleu cheese of mexican cheese. They make their rolled tacos like the meat squished in more so it's juicer & there's that extra tortilla all crispy like chips at the ends! =]  also comes with a fountain drink for $6.50 

The mama was what made our day as we were dead tired she made us laugh... also my man was in a better mood when he saw the officer's facial expression (sitting across from me on another table) had a smirk when he caught me lickin my plate clean as my eyes came above the plate & made contact w/ his O_O *BLUSH* x2 forgot I wasn't at home.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,3,3,5,K-Els-TroEh0-RzlU7rO8A

Service was fast and friendly. The eating area was clean and tidy. The topping bar was clean and pleasant to eat from. My food came out in like 5 minutes. My partner got a very flavorful carnitas burrito, I liked it. I got 3 rolled chicken taquito tacos with cheese and sour cream on it. For $3.50 it was a solid serving and price. 

I enjoy it all the time so if you love tacos check them out. None of the meals were greasy. Most places like this you get a lot of that. I felt good later too we all know sometimes our stomach can hurt.

The chorizo burrito was hot to the touch and remained that way 'til the very last morsel. The quesadilla was hot as well and cheesier than my boss's cheesy redneck jokes. 

Avoid the traditional ""lunch hour"" here and you are good to go. It's amazing what a difference an hour can make. Between 11:00 and 12:30, you have to wait in a long line and can barely find a seat. The further you can stray from that time frame, the better your experience gets.

Family owned and operated yet part of a larger chain. Each location has its own vibe and decor, some better than others but the food is always hardy, filling and of great quality.

I ordered two burritos, Not that I could have eating two because they are huge. I saved the second one for breakfast as I knew I was not going to have a lot of time the next morning. 

One was steak and the other was Machaca which is egg, shredded beef, and typical Mexican marinated option and peppers. 

Most of the people coming in were the kind of mix that give it more character. A black family with three cute little kids, two guys in dress clothes and ties, a Hispanic family who seemed to be regulars, a couple of scary looking gangbangers who were actually polite and friendly, an older Spanish woman who seemed to not speak any english, and the Mexican staff working the counters and in back. I'm guessing mostly family and owners.

Service was relatively fast, and you actually receive your food at the counter after you order before you pay for it. Prices were relatively inexpensive, especially considering the portion sizes.

I ended up trying something that I'd never had before: machaca. It was basically stir-fried shredded beef with egg and some onions/bell peppers. I thought it was pretty tasty, and was filling given the amount of egg, plus it was served with rice, beans, shredded lettuce, and your choice of flour or corn tortillas. There is a small complimentary self-serve salsa and condiments bar on the side next to the soda fountain as well.

I also ordered an horchata to drink, and while it does not come with refills (in comparison to the fountain drinks that are located out in the dining area), it was served in a very large glass. In addition, when I asked for it without ice, they still filled up the cup all the way to the top! =)

I enjoyed my meal and while it was not a mind-blowing dining experience, Roberto's serves up solid food at affordable prices.

P.S. There are a few tables for dining in but the place is not that big if you have a large group or come during peak meal hours.

But, much like walking in on your parents in their bedroom, what I saw two days ago cannot be unseen.  The carne asada burritos used to be the very best thing on the planet, and craving one, I popped in to order one.  When the woman making my burrito moved, my jaw dropped and stomach sank. No longer is it fresh beef, or even ""we made this earlier and are warming it"" beef.  It's canned, cubed beef out of an......industrial can.  There they sat, stacked two high and two deep--huge cans with large print stating loudly, ""Canned Cube Beef"", and in front of me, my sacred burrito being made with the same.

Sadly, the taste, no matter what they may have done to it, still tasted like higher end canned dog food (it was a dare, and I needed the cash, thank you), and the aftertaste was God-awful.    It brought a tear to my eyes.

We all know what's up here. They're a taco shop. Their tacos are greasy, crunchy, and awesome. Their burritos huge and burritoey. Their food superb for that late snack when you're regretting all the booze you drank a couple hours ago. A great place for a work lunch when you just want something greasy and cheesy that isn't a burger, especially on $1.29 chicken taco Wednesdays. There are few greater comfort foods in the world.

Now, this location. 

It's easily one of my favorites, and I'm a frequent patron due to its proximity to work.

Pros of this one versus other Roberto's.

1. The staff is awesome. They're always busting butt to get the food done ASAP, and always polite when ordering. The main checker there during the day is always friendly with me and does some small talk while we ring up the order. Love it.

2. Their red sauce is fire, to an almost literal extent. Other locations have very timid, almost tomatoey red sauce. Not this place. Their red sauce takes no prisoners and will make you it's bitch if you have too much. Keep in mind that I eat super hot stuff all the time, so I'm no stranger to the wonders of capscacin.

3. The place is well maintained and they keep good tabs on the sauce/lime/carrot & jalapeno cart.

4. Those $1.29 chicken tacos. Yes, other places have them, but there's something about how they make them here that just makes them extra crunchy and greasy. Outstanding.

Cons:

1. No green onions on the condiment cart. Sad face.

2. It can get pretty stupid busy, especially on Wednesday, so plan accordingly. Not really their fault, but FYI.

3. Parking is atrocious there. That whole shopping center is a parking nightmare. Again, not their fault, but FYI.",v0QQFY3i8IkCMHtGik4rTw,0,0,5,Lf_yPF7DBhWPK2LzFCULJw

4666850,2014-02-12,0,bUEc1ZDgfZPymHyUXEiiNg,"Man how disappointed I was with quality of food with this Roberto's Taco Shop . Generally I love Roberto's especially the one closest to my house off Gibson. But I decided to try the one closest by my work which happen to be the Rancho dr one.. 

This is the second time I have tried the food at this location and was let down twice .. Normally I love the Wednesday taco deal , but the tacos at this location were a big let down . I went during the  lunch hour rush, both times and it seems like they maybe a little under staffed . Because the food I got was cold and I noticed that the had a canister full of pre cooked tacos .. I ignore this, but when  I go to eat my tacos they just fall apart because they are cold and hard .. 

I Know it's not easy to keep up with the rush hour for lunch .. But I think the food should be cooked upon ordering .. Not pre-made food that I received..  

Sorry but twice is enough for me not to return to this location ..",udvZ0urE-mfdDMvP4myZSA,0,0,2,bD0fFrgZC2IkdYW1Fk3Ywg

The facility itself is messy. The salad bar wasn't fresh AT ALL, the floor was sticky and needed sweeping, and the staff spoke very little to no English. On top of that, one of the counter personnel (I'm sorry I will not disclose who this person is nor their gender, I'm not trying to get anyone fired) came out to talk to my coworker and I about their oral health concerns (in Spanish). Now...I completely understand Spanish...but it takes me a little while still to form all the correct words in my head in order to carry a conversation in Spanish...but I responded to all the questions with English while still holding the tongues with hot carrots in them. They didn't get that I wasn't interested in that conversation. AT. ALL. Anyway that's beside the point...my point is...I'm on lunch....don't you think it's rude of you to approach anyone to talk about the pus coming out of your tooth you thought you extracted a year and a half ago?!?! I'm in the dental field...I have a strong stomach but yuck! That's not something I want to hear from a place where I'm getting my lunch! 

So now...the food :(
I ordered a chicken chimichanga and my co-worker ordered a chicken nacho plate thing with more chips than chicken. My chimichanga was full...and I mean FULL of onions...WTF where's the meat?!? I usually like onions but c'mon man! That was just too much! My co-worker's plate was full of onions too!!! She asked for more chips than chicken meat and she literally (and we counted) only had 9 chips!!!! She was pissed! 

The food was edible. That's about it...nothing to wow about. I should have driven the extra 5 or 6 miles to the other Roberto's I went to the night before.

5266009,2017-04-11,1,bUEc1ZDgfZPymHyUXEiiNg,"We stopped in before going grocery shopping (we all know how bad of an idea it is to go shopping on an empty stomach), and it was quiet. The restaurant was dirty, and the fryer oil probably hasn't been changed in a month, or longer (it's in plain view from the counter where you order). The cucumber/carrot/onion/salsa bar was definitely on the sketchy side. 

But I love me some dirty, sketchy holes in the wall. 

I ordered the carnitas burrito, and I really liked it. The pork was flavorful, and abundant. The guacamole is standard guac (nothing to complain about or write home to mom about), but it adds good flavor.  The pico de gallo was in one spot in he middle of the burrito. I had to scoop some out because it was just too overpowering in that one spot. But, overall, it was a good burro. 

Will I go there again? Maybe.  We'll see if I'm hungry the next time I go grocery shopping.",yPFB_NuRX4W_nAkxnTKxhQ,2,2,3,Ao2FOBaLIlP1s9stjpx3Gw

However, a few month ago something happened to this place, they either changed the cook, or the whole crew, but the quality is just not the same. Every other time the nachos are burned, and the burritos have more fat knots than meat.
But the last drop was when I found a piece of plastic film INSIDE my food. I'm sorry, but that's too much. I'm all for loyalty and giving second chances, but come on.
The only reason I put 2 stars (I know I ought to put 1) is I hope that some changes can be made and this place can be restored to its former quality level. It's a shame to see your favorite spots turn like that.",Mx5oPwYqbiW_j8X_6WHSEA,1,0,2,LDTKbEPwqDonlhQBx_FM_A
