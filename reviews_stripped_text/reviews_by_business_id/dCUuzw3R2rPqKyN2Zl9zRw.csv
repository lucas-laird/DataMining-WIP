The table was right by the entrance and my seat was right behind the menu where people walking by could check it out.  I didn't really like that table b/c a lot of people were walking by and then they were right next to the table looking at the menu.

Other than, that the food was excellent!  They gave us bread and olive oil, which was so good b/c we had two basket-fulls.  I ordered the sea bass and a side of potatoes and was completely stuffed.  I also had a glass of wine, which was great!

Perhaps they were slightly thinner or freshly made. I cannot be sure. It was divine and ""light"" if that word can be used to describe lasagne (again, it was the noodles). I ate there last night, December, 2017, and ordered the much anticipated lasagne. The pasta were as ""good"" as I can make at home.  Adding insult to that injury was the fact that the first two ""layers"" were simply one layer of a lasagne noodle in top of another lasagne noodle; no sauce, meat, nor cheese in between, just a doubly thick layer of that dense pasta.  The sauce, meat, and cheese tastes were all delicious and as remembered, but the pasta, nope.  Has something changed between then and now?  If so, please change it back!  Your lasagne went from ephemeral to delicious.  Service was wonderful (thank you Heidi). A pleasant experience all around.

Reading through the other comments its clear that this restaurant is engaged in misrepresenting and false claims with wine and drinks.

While attending dinner last Saturday we were told that the restaurant had 3 wine specials on the menu, Ok.... these are supposedly $200-300, BUT TODAY THEY ARE BETWEEN $100-150, so I ordered a 2013 Gaja Ca' Marcanda Promis for $127 as it was listed on the menu.

Having fun and dinner with the salty pasta and saggy salads, I took the left over bottle back to my room to discover the next day it was not a 2013, it was a 2015!  Socking and to add more salt to the dinner, the full retail price on the internet was a mere $27....thats a 500% markup...

I called the manager and told her the server lied about the wine and provided the wrong bottle vintage....oh, ok, the manager stated she will check with the vendor to see why they delivered a newer vintage, Daaaaa, its the dog ate my homework deal........

75896,2013-05-01,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"So this is an Italian restaurant located within the MGM Grand area.  It was my husband's birthday and we opted to go for Italian as he loves Italian and we don't normally get it (plus it was way cheaper than the Japanese tasting menu I was eyeing across the way).  I'm going to break down the two parts of the dining experience: food and service.

The food was okay.  We split the Spinach salad, which they thoughtfully divided for us.  However, it was just meh -- the dressing was relatively tasteless but there was a great deal of bacon in it.  Then my husband ordered the spaghetti with the Kobe beef meatballs.  I had the pasta trio tasting.  When it came out, my husband was served the orecchiette.  We sent it back to get the appropriate dish which was an excellent idea as the orecchiette was present in my trio and the pasta was just really doughy and the sauce very bland.  My trio also had a lobster gnocchi and a ravioli with some game meat.  The ravioli was actually pretty good and I ate every bite of it and almost licked up the sauce.  The gnocchi was okay, but they used a lot of lobster in what felt like compensation for the blandness of the rest of the dish.  My husband's spaghetti however was terrible.  The pasta was not cooked through -- you could still taste the dough and the sauce was also really bland.  All in all, for the food, we would've been happier being served Chef Boyardee spaghetti and meatballs which was really disappointing because my husband loves Italian.

Now for service.  We were seated and water and menus were brought out.  Great.  Ten minutes pass until our waiter comes to see us (it wasn't him that brought the water and menus).  We give him our order.  Our salads are bought out by someone who was not the waiter in about ten minutes.  Then a half hour passes before we get out entrees.  It's the wrong entree for my husband.  Fifteen minutes later and our waiter appears for the second time that evening to bring out the correct food.  We finish and our plates are cleared away by someone not a waiter.  We wait for twenty minutes looking for our waiter to order dessert, but he's nowhere to be found.  We realize that it's past 9 and we have to go because we have tickets to the 9:30 show of Ka.  We track down the manager and ask him for our check.  He actually comps the drinks which was really nice of him because my husband didn't make a scene or anything -- just walked up to him and explained that we had been waiting for 20 minutes to order dessert but now we had to go and needed the check.  After we receive the check and now waiting for the credit card slip to come back, our waiter makes an appearance for the third time that evening to ask if we want any dessert.

And during all this, the table next to us arrived about fifteen minutes after we did and got an appetizer, a pasta dish, and were just finishing on branzino dishes when we left.  The manager also stopped by during each course to see how they were doing.

Afterwards, my husband was still mad about this, so he went back to the restaurant to talk to the manager.  The manager told him that he was actually not the first person to tell him about the bad service and food *that night*.  Their reason was that they were really busy even though when we sat down the restaurant was half empty and didn't start filling up with those large groups he mentioned until we had received our entrees.

Anyway as my father later put it, ""We get these comments every night, but we don't care because this is a tourist trap and we're never going to see any of you people again anyway.""  So this place gets two stars.  But the manager who comped our drinks without request gets four stars because he knows how to try and make a client happy.",DNFX44rLbZCGlOPkEGzboQ,0,0,2,L1D0ibMG_7IiDAZdDIrXjA

100429,2006-06-16,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"An OK choice if you are in a rush to see KA (speaking of... see my review of KA).  The food is good... not great.  I had gnocchi which was little to write home about...  not that it was bad... just not great.  

We started with the waiter recommended ""POLIPO"" (a citrus grilled octopus green olive ""Olivada"" with roasted peppers).  It was a pretty good choice (4 tentacles were served which is good to share for 2 but would be a bit small for 4).  The sauce was a bit too much of a tangy red tomato sauce and the octopus had a grilled taste to it.  Good but, not great.

The portions are a decent size if you grab a salad or app before the main course.  Our waiter pushed us to add a side, so we did (we added.... Broccoli Rabe).  It was very tasty but too much food unless you are starving.  The Broccoli Rabe which is made w/ a cream, white wine sauce, ham, Broccoli Rabe, onion and maybe even pine nuts... could be a bit overwhelming  if you get a very creamy main course dish (like the gnocchi) but, it was good in any case.  Oh yea... for those who are not fans of Broccoli... it isn't your traditional broccoli... it is leafy and not stalky.

We didn't do desert, so I can't speak to that.  The service was great.  We noted our rush and they took our order and got us out in ~45min.  Prices were OK... not cheap (which Vegas never is any more) and not insane (which Vegas it now).  We got out of there for $120 (w/ 20% tip) for 1app, 2 dinners and 2 drinks.

We had some tomato and (store bought) mozzarella and after that overcooked pasta in a sauce coming from a package. 

I asked for a glass of wine and was presented Pinot Grigio (without them asking me). I do not like PG that much, so requested to know if they had something else. After 15 minutes they presented me the wine list and I choose a Sauvignon. Instaed of giving me the SB, they gave me the PG again! I should have gotten up and walked away, but because I was with a group, I couldn't.

My girlfriend order a vegetarian pasta which was one of the specials.  Given that the special was not listed on the menu, we were not aware of the price but assumed it fell into the range of $23-$35 along with the majority of the dishes on the menu.  We were surprised when we received the bill to find our that the vegetarian dish was $55!  I had the lobster gnocchi (which was delicious) for $32.  How is a vegetarian pasta more than a dish that includes lobster?  The vegetarian dish is even more expensive than their filet.

Again, the food was good but the service was average.  Additionally, we felt a little screwed by the relatively high cost of a vegetarian dish.

165825,2010-09-29,1,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"When it comes to high-end or upscale Italian food, I generally end up disappointed and underwhelmed. Ferraro's, Zefferino, Valentino, and Sirio are a few examples that come to mind. The problem I find with this type of restaurant is that it is hard to justify the expensive price tag for usually small dishes of food that are typically decent but not great. In addition, if you consider that the majority of restaurants in the Strip casinos overcharge you for mediocre food, then the odds of a satisfying experience do not appear very promising. However, I am glad to report that Fiamma is one of the few that successfully bucks that trend.

I have dined here several times, but except for weekends, it is rarely crowded. Even at peak times, it is usually a short wait for a table without a reservation. Kind of unusual for a restaurant of this caliber, but who's complaining?

Some of the appetizers I've sampled include the Mista di Campo (mixed green salad), calamari, and beef carpaccio with truffle oil. They are all very good, but the highlights are the entrees and dessert.

Here are some of our favorites:

The Cappellacci di Brasato (short rib ravioli, black truffle crema, Barbera wine reduction) is a delight: a generous serving size of al dente cooked pasta with tender short rib filling, and an intoxicating truffle aroma. Need I say more?

My wife loves gnocchi, and their Gnocchi All'Aragosta (Maine lobster, mushrooms and black truffle) is one of her favorite preparations. The pillowy soft gnocchi are cooked just right.

For the heartier appetite, their Brasato di Manzo con Risotto (braised short rib in Chianti wine with parmesan risotto and red onion marmalade crouton) is very tender, tasty, and filling.

Now on to dessert.

The Crochette (crispy amaretti and ricotta doughnuts with hazelnut, chocolate and strawberry dipping sauces) is very good and great for sharing.

The mascarpone panna cotta with white balsamic honey, dried mission figs, and marcona almonds is FANTASTIC. Actually, I don't even usually like panna cotta, but their version, my friends, is the best panna cotta I have ever had by far. A friend of mine loves it so much that a couple of times he even ordered two panna cottas for himself! As much as I wanted to let my inner glutton loose (when the occasion warrants it), one panna cotta is enough for me.

I don't mind paying a premium when the food is this good. That being said the prices are reasonable for what you get. For example, the short rib ravioli is $24 and the panna cotta is $12. Recent discounts for locals make it an even better value. In the past, many of the MGM Grand restaurants offered buy one get the second entree free. Their current locals offer is free dessert and an after dinner drink with purchase of an entree.

The combination of delicious food, very good service, reasonable value, a modern and trendy but relaxed ambience, and short wait times make this place a winner in my book. Thank you Fiamma for restoring my faith in Italian fine dining.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,2,1,4,MwqEnLR5FPjmezyFKU0s2w

We ordered KA tickets online and had to pick up the tickets an hour before the show began so we had quite a bit of time to kill.

Since we were highly disappointed w/ our $200 dinner, we didnt stay for dessert (reason for why we were so early). I kept telling my husband about how good gelato was so we decided to ask the concierge to suggest a place and he recommended Fiamma.

We sat in the bar/lounge area infront of the fireplace. This place definitely has an intimate feel with the darkened lighting and minimum noise level. We ordered their gelato which came in three scoops on three different mini bowls set on a tray- Pistachio, Chocolate & Vanilla Bean (they also have Dulce de Leche).

Now Im used to a variety of flavors swirled into one so having the typical solid flavor as chocolate, vanilla and pistachio was a little disappointing. BUT, after the first bite of each my foot was put in my mouth- it was so yummy!! My husband ate more than I did and he is NOT the dessert type.

This is the only place inside MGM that has gelato so if youre ever in the mood for one while here, check this place out- you get 3 ice cream-sized scoops for less than $11, which is pretty cheap for gelato.

Fiamma is the kind of restaurant where you remember the flavors of the food for life and you will have a meal memory--remembering exactly how the restaurant felt, who you were with, the server, etc...",gWs7Oeer3zL3wvbehkbQEg,2,2,5,x3sv8PDNm6ukgUBfop_EYQ

Chef and his staff were very catering to our party's dietary restrictions as we had a dairy allergy and a no gluten/sugar/carb diabetic diet. Chefs most notable dishes to overwhelm my attention were the Grilled Octupus, Meatballs, Burrata & Pesto, cheese and meat boards, short rib plate, steak, and broccolini. The Burrata's creamy, spreadable inside was secured by its firm outer shell. The short rib was so tender, you could cut it simply by looking at it. It was braised in the perfect balance of wine and brown veal stock. The broccolini was cooked al dente with the flavor of fresh garlic, chili flakes, and olive oil. It felt very comforting to notice Chef's table side manor with guests, making sure each dish was cooked to perfection with no room for mistakes. If you are coming to visit Las Vegas or live locally, Fiamma should be on your itinerary.

I ordered the butternut squash raviolis which were absolutely delicious. The portion was small, but I actually prefer this because I hate always taking home food. I got a Pineapple Upside Down cocktail. It was so sweet and a delicious drink!

This place is fairly expensive (for 2 people we spent around 120 with drinks) but it has a very nice atmosphere, good music and good service. 

My only complaint is when we went there, the restaurant had plenty of seating. They decided to sit us in the very front next to the open walk of the MGM grand. During our dinner, some chick was passing out club tickets and using some of the wooden divider between us and her as her desk. Then during our meal a UFC fight let out and hundreds of people just flooded the hall. They were screaming, drunk, staring at us..

The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice.  It's not overly formal, but not too casual either.  It's also not too noisy so you and your company can definitely have conversations without needing to scream into each other's ears.

The wine selection is pretty wide.  They are true to their culture and focus mostly on Italian wines, all of which have been delicious, for the ones that I have tried at least. Should definitely check out the sparkling wines or dessert wines if your pocketbook can afford it.  :-)

The food is nothing short of AMAZING!  Even something as simple as cold cuts and cheese was enough to impress me.  The ingredients are fresh and unique, nothing you'd normally find in a typical grocery market.  I think they marinated the olives and many other foods themselves, so the flavors you're getting from this place is definitely not something you can find just anywhere else!

I tried 2 or 3 different types of pasta from this location and loved each one of them.  The chefs here pair special sauces for different types of pasta, each sauce focusing on the reduction of various alcohols like brandy or vodka.  Anyone can make pasta sauce, but to make it where you can actually taste/feel out all the flavors of the ingredients and appreciate the way it complements the pasta, that is rare.  This place definitely inspired me to experiment and be more creative with my pasta sauces in the future!

I had this a few years ago, so I can't remember how to describe it, but I remember that the calamari was to die for!

The service was great!  Food came out really fast, and the servers were good about refills and clearing empty plates to make room for the next course.

Pricing is a little expensive, but it's also not outrageous.  For the quality and quantity of the food you're getting, I'd say it's fair.  Probably not somewhere you'd want to eat at everyday, but it's definitely affordable for those special dates.",cjl5W3Lh1Na5EITkxWOEqA,0,1,5,1kMKS3aNrL2iIJhPPuqzSg

Probably the best time to try this place out is during restaurant week because they have special prices on 3 course meals. It's a nice place to take a date which is why I've been here a bunch of times. 
The bar area is really nice as well if your looking to stop in and grab a drink or dine at the bar. They don't serve anything our of out the ordinary, drink wise.

We started our meal with beef carpaccio which was so good, but the best was yet to come.  Boyfriend had the seabass, me the petaluma chicken; both meals cooked to absolute perfection, they were so delicious.  We raved basically all night about how good our dinner was.

We arrived and were seated promptly on time. The decor of the restaurant was beautiful, but they seated us at the very front next to the open walkway for hotel guests and it was a little too distracting and loud for my preference. 

The waiter we had was monotone and very bland. Wasn't really interested in giving suggestions or checking in - mostly just took our orders and delivered the food. He was also quite behind on refilling waters as both of us had to ask twice. 

The food, however, was a good thing. We ordered the bleu cheese and arugula salad, which I could've eaten the entire bowl of. The parmesan crisps in the bread basket were salty and delicious to accompany our drinks.

As for the main courses, I ordered the sea bass with panzanella and my guest had the short rib ravioli. The former was just ok. The fish was cooked well, but didn't have much flavor. The salad dressing was the best thing on the plate, while the panzanella barely had any bread in it! More like a plain salad with some croutons. The ravioli, on the other hand, saved the day. The truffle sauce was maybe the best sauce I've tasted and you could taste the short ribs perfectly.

Since I was sitting at the bar, i got to talk to some bartenders.

Lobster gnocchi was a-maz-ing. Three syllables, yes and it deserves each one of them. The dish was soft and creamy but not overpowering and the flavors were just rich enough to be enjoyed. The seafood pasta also had such a rich flavor. It came with a variety of different seafoods, which was pretty nice too. Even the bread basket was exciting and quite fresh tasting.

The lighting inside was mostly definitely mood lighting. It made the entire restaurant seem quite and serene even though right outside is a brightly lit hallway with people bustling back and forth in the MGM. That made it strangely interesting to sit in the outer area of the restaurant right next to the hallway.

This past time, I waited for 45 minutes to receive my entrees, and my drinks were empty for the majority of the meal.  Other times that I have been here, the service has been attentive and friendly.

The restaurant is located in the MGM and has a beautiful dining room.  It is dimly lit and has a great atmosphere.  The server greeted us shortly after we sat down and took our order.  When I asked him for recommendations, he recommended the short ribs, the short rib raviolini and the lobster gnocchi.  We wound up ordering the Pistachio Crusted Grilled Shrimp appetizer, the Caesar Salad, the Raviolini and the Gnocchi.

The shrimp came out and were delicious, although they had a fairly scant amount of pistachios dusting them.  It was served with a delicious sauce, made of tomatoes and olives.  The shrimp were cooked through and were large and plump.  

The Caesar salad was delicious.  The dressing was garlicky and was fairly standard, but the croutons made this salad memorable.  I am not usually a crouton fan, but my companion and I fought over who got the last one.

The entrees, which took an additional ten minutes to arrive after our server said that they would be out in just a minute, were okay.  Well, one was good, and one earned my ""Never Again"" award.

The Raviolini was deceptive.  The portion looked small.  The stuffed pasta looked danty, as well as delicious.  And it was definitely delicious.  But dainty it ain't.    More like stick to your (braised short) ribs filling.  These suckers are enough to make two meals out of.  They had a delicious, intense flavor.  Their meaty goodness had me salivating over them.  I would return for these, but I am not sure that I would wait as long as I did for them again.  If you go, order this.  Don't order the atrocity that I review next.

The lobster Gnocchi, one of the proclaimed house specialties, was so disappointing, that if I had seen my waiter in the first ten minutes after the food had been delivered, I would have said something.  The gnocchi was overcooked and had the consistency of glue.  The sauce appeared to have been broken.  There was a thin layer of oil on top of what otherwise appeared to be a delicious sauce.  The menu billed it as having truffle in it, but truffle was not evident in the taste.  The five small pieces of lobster were flavorful.  I just wish there had been a little more.

When the server removed our plates, he didn't even acknowledge that apart from the lobster, my gnocchi was barely touched.

My daughter and I both spit them out and told our waiter. The shrimp were basic large shrimp. $42 Thank you.  3 of us ordered NY Steaks(quick and easy to cook). They were tasteless and tough. Truthfully, I've had better steaks from the supermarket.  I've eaten steaks in just about every major steak house in this country and these ranked dead last for taste, seasoning and tenderness.

With some difficulty, we ordered glasses of prosecco to enjoy before dinner (The waiter did not offer to take drink orders or provide us with a by-the glass menu). The prosecco failed to arrive until well after our salads, which appeared almost instantaneously.  We had only taken a few bites of our salad, and sips of our prosecco, when the entrees arrived.  Rather than returning them to the kitchen, the waiter pressured us to relinquish our less than half-eaten salads. We didn't put up too much of a fight as the caesar salad was not particularly enticing.  RIght on the waiter's heels, the sommelier appeared with the nice bottle of chardonnay that we had ordered.  It was completely unchilled. Rather than refusing it as we should have, we allowed him to talk us into pouring a small sip with the promise that he would rapidly chill the remainder.  At that point, the waiter, sommelier, and our bottle of chardonnay disappeared into oblivion while we finished our entrees, sans wine.  Only well after we had finished picking at our entrees did the waiter reappear. We had to ask him to please fetch our wine, which he did unapologetically. As you can probably guess, the wine was still completely warm.  He proceeded to pour a glass for each of us and then started to leave with the bottle in hand.  At this point, my wife nearly jumped up to tackle him, fearing that if he escaped with the bottle we would never see him or our warm wine again.

We were given a $75 dining credit with our stay so we thought we'd get our money's worth with a top notch Italian place. This was certainly not up to par with all the hype it's been given. 
We stopped by to look over the menu and it looked delicious on paper, but not in reality. I ordered the orechiette with sausage because that is one of my favorite pasta dishes and first off, our dishes came out way too quickly, it was odd, made it look like they were not cooked to order. Secondly, it did not mention in the description of my dish what type of sauce it was and I was not expecting a red cream sauce. I wish it was traditional tomato sauce. Everything was chopped in my pasta like a salad, which I didn't like. My bf's lobster gnocchi was just ok, he mentioned it was extremely rich and thought he was eating soup.  The sauce was not his favorite and he politely asked when ordering if they could do meat sauce and said ""No"". So that was that. The one yummy tasting thing was the $9 asparagus sprinkled with parmasean cheese, yea it better be for that price.
All in all, I would not return to this establishment, sorry MGM grand.",cSJljHcrO0hLCdr6FU6BqQ,0,0,3,IN4FfkpkWwEW7e-QQXyJTQ

The first time was with a group of 12 so I put the so-so experience off as the result of the group and all the dished coming out together on a busy night..  On a business trip last week, I was in the mood for Italian and thought it fair to give this eatery another go.

While the pre dinner cocktails and bartender were as good and enjoyable as they had been on my first trip, the food regrettably also matched my initial experience.  The salad I ordered had clearly been made well in advance and stored, while not uncommon it was a little too obvious in this case.  While I could live with that, I had the same entree I tried months earlier as a fair comparison.  Pappardelle is one of my absolute favorites, but this version struck out for a second time.  Many of the noodles were stuck together which is a complete no-no and the sauce, a lamb ragout, was tepid at best even as it arrived.  Considering it was only 7pm and the restaurant was maybe half full, the above is unforgivable.

With so many wonderful options in the MGM alone, this is not a destination I'll repeat.",5chkr5OMb94HdUsWndghkA,3,0,2,H9ca8jVxSabH0A-wM4KYIA

Yelped this place and so glad I did. The reviews were right on...for those that liked this place. 

My boyfriend and I were seated along the walkway of the MGM. It was good for a little people watching. And as I am not a fan of second hand cigarette smoke I can say I didn't smell any of it. 

Thursday evening before Ka meal...we did not have reservations and were seated right away.Served bread right away. The flatbread crusted with parmesan was delish. Tried the pineapple upside-down martini, it was just okay and sticky. My next martini was just the way I like it, straight up, and both were filled to the brim. 

I give it a 4 star rating because of the service, however I really want to give it a 5 star just based on my dish. The service wasn't bad it just wasn't great either. 

My boyfriend ordered the lasagna dish. He gave it 3 stars. You can tell it was fresh, down to the sauce however it was kinda of on the bland side. 

Can not wait to go back. I will be trying the short rib ravioli (as others have suggested or the new halibut dish).",3u_EzkblWCXX3ZfLKoGP2Q,0,0,4,GobI7WRnSClbktfTZ_vvOg
588445,2010-12-30,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"I'm a tough critic when it comes to dining, but if I could rate Fiamma an extra half star for a 4.5 I would.  This was my first time dining here and I will DEFINITELY be back!

I started with a glass of the Acacia Carneros 2006 Pinot Noir ($15).  I have a glass of red wine with just about every meal out that I have and this was the best I've had in a long time.  Extremely smooth, not too sweet and not too dry.  It was a perfect compliment for the food also.

For an appetizer I ordered Tomino Alla Griglia:  ""Grilled Piedmontese Cheese, Zucchini, Rocket Lettuce, Roasted Cherry Tomato, Vincotto Drizzle"" ($14).  This was absolutely amazing.  The zuccini was grilled & thinly sliced, topped with the bed of lettuce, and the bed of lettuce topped with the round of grilled cheese.  I am a huge cheese fan and this cheese was very good- grilled to perfection, not overly cooked, soft, full of flavor, and not over powering.  The roasted tomatos gave the dish an extra something that completed it.  I had to force myself to stop eating this to save room for my entree!

My entree was the famous signature Gnocci All'Aragosta:  ""Soft Potato Dumplings With Maine Lobster, Mushroom and Black Truffle"" ($31).  This was basically an orgasm in my mouth.  I can see why this is one of their signature dishes- the lobster had very good flavor & good portion (although I can always go for more lobster in dishes), gnocci perfectly done, smooth and flavorful, and mushrooms & black truffle were the perfect compliment.  Portion size of the dish in it's entirety was good, I had to force myself from finishing this dish as well since it was so good. 

A bread basket with EVOO was brought out prior to antipasti but I didn't touch it partially because I knew I had a ton of food coming, and it also did not look like anything spectacular.  It consisted of two different breads, a standard looking something or other and another that resembled ciabatta.

As for the enviroment, this would be a great place to have a romantic or special occasion dinner.  The lighting was a bit dim.  This is the first restaurant on the left after you enter the Studio Walk in MGM, so unless you are seated more towards the inner portion of the restaurant, as I was, you'll be very open to the mass amounts of foot traffic passing thru and the opening of the casino floor. 

Service was good but nothing special.  The waiter was friendly and made small talk.  One thing I did not like was the fact the GM or AGM, whatever he was, circulated the dining room a few times just kind of looking around.  I only saw him stop at two or three tables during that time, and one of them was not mine.  This, the service and enviroment are the reasons I did not give Fiamma five stars.

I took pictures but my flash was not working and it was very dim, so they would be pointless to post.

Overall, the food was amazing, I will definitely continue to recommend.  If you come here, the Lobster Gnocci is a must!",9xBDxlvOPBT8I2L9lVSqxg,1,1,4,pbf9hTUMPvkSDwl2A3Oxgg

We have reservations and were originally seated facing the front walkway at a tiny table big enough for a couple cocktails. We immediately asked to be seated in a booth thinking why would they sit anyone there who would be having more than a drink and maybe an appetizer. The decor was very nice and our waiter was very attentive. However our food reminded us of Olive Garden. The bread was mediocre, slightly stale and was nothing to rave about. I ordered the special Spaghetti Chitarra and my wife the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. The meatballs for my spaghetti were good but the pasta was extra thick and heavy. My wife's Alfredo was warm at best and lacked flavor.  The chicken was overcooked and a bit tough. 
We will say that the cucumber martini was refreshing and tasty. 
Maybe we came in on an off night being it was a Monday.  I would be willing to try it again and give  them a fair chance.",0WNotYbRNV86a6RReMSbYg,0,0,3,aV7akdMcMD6fQ_bTr0Il_Q

Same price point; way better food.  I think I can say that with conviction because I ate at Wolfgang two nights ago.

We ordered the pan seared Ahi & the traditional potato gnocchi.  Both dishes were IMO w/o fault.  Well, maybe the veggie terrine was slightly non complimentary with the ahi dish, but the flavours of everything we ordered were great.  The tuna was JUST seared leaving a lot of the flesh uncooked (just the way they should be IMO).

If I had to write my review on the gnocchi, it'd be another page.  Gnocchi, lobster, black truffles -- how can you POSSIBLY go wrong with a dish like this?

Service was excellent.  I had a flight to catch at 9pm; we sat down at 7:30 and told our server on our timeline.  We were outta the resto by 8:20 and we ate at what I'd think quite a leisurely pace.  Which means the food came out pronto.",9kp2Ut0o_2dAurXxsnjzHg,0,0,4,hCHjTGbQwa7bUeWyomf7Pw

I went back there even though they screwed up what was supposed to be vegetarian dish and fed beef to my vegetarian friend on our first visit, and we STILL go there every time we go to Vegas.

Here it is: First visit, it is my birthday, so we all decide we want a fancy schmancy dinner, here we are. Beautiful decor and a menu which appears to serve everyone's food preferences from vegetarians to carnivores who will eat anything which isn't running too fast attract us to this place.  Our waiter is incredibly attentive, polite and engaging, is sure to serve the ladies first, etc and points out all the veggie friendly dishes, and those which can be ""easily made vegetarian"".  My gnocchi is so amazing that I let it sit in my mouth because I do not want it to end! The boys order some slabs of meat which appears to be melting apart and they are in heaven because of it. My best friend is raving about her pasta marinara [sans Kobe meatballs to make it vegetarian] and how it is the best tasting sauce she has ever had. A few minutes later, we find out why when her fork strikes a large hunk of cow! We have meat sauce. This woman has not eaten beef in 10 years, and she is on the verge of tears, panicking, and it sets the whole table on edge.  We summon our waiter who apologizes profusely and within 2 minutes the manager is at our table doing the same. He lets us know that they are usually very careful to use different utensils, gloves, etc for vegetarian requests and he is profoundly sorry, offers us drinks and desserts all on the house, as well as my friend's amended meal for free. {She LOVED the veggie version just as much].The desserts will send you into a sugar coma and give you a headache too, they are that good.  

The next night, we are trying to decide what to do for dinner, and I had been craving that gnocchi all day. Everyone else admits they want to go back to Fiamma! As soon as we walk in, the manager greets us and thanks us for returning in light of the circumstances, lets us know he had a mandatory emergency staff meeting that day to discuss strict rules regarding veggie requests [our waiter later confirmed this without us mentioning it] and once again, desserts are on the house.

We enjoyed a long dinner, and they were starting to close up as we finished, at which point we saw everyone on staff go around to each table setting and hold glasses up to the light to check for spots!

In light of the mistake, the service and attention to detail here was so pristine, not to mention the amazing food, that every time we have a trip planned to Vegas, our reservation at Fiamma gets booked right after the flight and hotel.",YvhL-ZWtdXmmms_Q4-6YBQ,0,0,5,PLLJ4KZWTeUvfmiL63wskQ

We were in the mood for some good Italian food. I'm a firm believer of 'you get what you pay for'. So, the pricey menu coupled with good reviews; I had high expectations. We started with one of their specials, lobster bisque. It was served 'table side', meaning a bowl of mixed veggies with a little lobster was brought out, followed by another person with a cup of the bisque to pour it into the bowls. It was good but I've never had a chunky bisque before. Next we had the beef carpaccio. The beef was extremely tender, it was sticking to the plate and turning into mush when we tried to get with our fork. So far, everything was different but okay. For my entree, I ordered the traditional spaghetti and Kobe beef meatballs. This is how I normally rate any restaurant, by their basic dishes.  The spaghetti was terrible!!! It was worse than a can of Chef Boyardee. The noodles size and texture were like chow mien noodles. The sauce were so salty, I can feel my blood pressure rising with each noodle I ate. Yes, I had to eat my spaghetti strand by strand so I wouldn't consume so much of the 'heart attack' sauce. The meatballs were mushy, just like the meatball you would get out of the Spaghetti O's cans. I only managed to choke down a few bites. It's a good thing their portions are so small, I didn't feel bad about throwing so much food. Hubby had some kind of raviolis. He said it was ok, nothing to rave about. We spent over $100 and were still hungry. We ended up going to McDonald's for something more edible. The only reason this place even got 2 stars from me is because the service was good.

What was cool was that there was enough lasagna for both of us to share one dish.

I also had the most amazing cocktail I have ever had in my life.  It is called a pineapple upside down cake and it I have never had a better cocktail anywhere.  If you like martinis, then this is one that you should try.

I went here for my bday dinner celebration with 13 people. We waited for our table in a lounge area near the bar with an glass encased fireplace and modern couches. Had a lime martini - first one was pretty good and light on the simple syrup. The second one, not so much. Way too sweet, but was easily fixed by the bartender.

Fiamma has the multiple server thing going on, almost to the point of confusion. Hmmm who should we ask for drinks, food...??? We were presented with the ""bottled"" or ""still"" water question, to which my sister stupidly said ""still."" For a table of 13, imagine the number of dollars, ca-ching! The table bread was odd for an Italian restaurant, it was closer to an Indian naan. It was good, but just odd. The menu had so many great sounding choices, it was hard to pick! 

What 3 of us decided on:

RAVIOLINI
Short Rib Ravioli, Barbera Wine
Imported Pecorino Romano 

SPAGHETTI
Fresh Cut Chitarra Spaghetti
Kobe Meatballs, San Marzano Pomodoro 

AGNOLOTTI
Piemonte Ravioli, Imported Bufala Ricotta
Spinach, Crushed Pomodori Pelati 

Yum, yum, and yum. We sampled each other's food. Spaghetti was definitely homemade. Raviolini was great. The Agnolotti was what I ordered and it was my favorite. Being a cheeseaholic, I loved of this dish. 

We got two birthday desserts but that was disappointing. I'd ordered the CIOCCOLATO: triple chocolate cake, godiva ganache, white chocolate gelato, berry gelatina, but it never made its way to the table. Instead they delivered the CROCHETTE: crispy amaretti doughnuts, chocolate ganache, dolce di latte, cinnamon glaze, which I definitely could have left. I wasn't even hungry come dessert time, but I thought it was on the house for the birthday and I figured I'd share it.  Alas, they charged for the desserts. Ridiculous even though I hadn't even wanted those little chocolate donut holes (which were not amazing at all). But after some coaxing, the server (rightfully) removed the charge. Next time, I shall get my Cicollato!!!",qDYWRXL8jCdEdh7XahIFWA,2,1,4,Eu0Vwu-yJWnV-xIN7PMt0Q

979700,2016-03-26,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"My son and I went here while waiting for my daughter in a concert. I was really looking forward to a nice dinner at a pricey restaurant. We were seated promptly, and by the front ""window"" area. It was cool for people watching, except that they were watching you too- while you eat. The area outside of the restaurant is a non-smoking area, but unfortunately people either do not know or just don't care. We had many many people pass by while smoking and one group who stood right I front of us smoking. I would recommend asking for an interior seating area. Next is the food. Our waiter took a very long time to get to us. Yes, it was on the night of a concert, but it was during the concert and there were few other tables. We ordered an appetizer of calamari, which was pretty standard at $18. It was super quick. As in, kinda too quick. I know, I'm complaining that it was too quick, but I couldn't see how they even had time to get our order back to the kitchen and prepare it before it came out to us. The best part was the pesto dipping sauce, and the fact that there were diced peperoncinis mixed in. My son ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, and I ordered the short ribs with mushroom risotto. It took FOREVER to get our dishes. I expected a normal wait time, since the appetizer was there suspiciously quickly, but I was wrong. Oh well, we had time to kill, so it wasn't a big deal. When the food came it looked delicious. I tried the fettuccine Alfredo and it was nothing special, but my son really liked it. When I first took a bite of my food, it was really good. Our waiter came up and asked how it was and we told him it was great. Well, by my third bite I downed an entire glass of water because it was SO salty. I love salt. ""Salty"" is an adjective I love. This was excessive. I drank two more glasses of water with two more bites, and just couldn't do it. FYI- the staff refilling the water is on-point. My glass was never empty lol. So I waited for the waiter to check back in. He passes us maybe 6 times in a hurry. I faced him and looked at him waiting for him to return a glance each time. I didn't want to cause a scene, so I waited and waited and waited. He finally comes over and I apologize and tell him that it is just too salty. He was not happy. His words said ""no problem"", but his face and demeanor said otherwise. He told me he wished I would've told him sooner... Yeah that was the goal, but when you run by us with your eyes straight ahead, I would have had to jump in front of you to get your attention. He brought me a menu and I ordered the lobster gnocchi. While waiting for my new food and praying that I didn't get a spit glaze, my son bit into the hugest piece of cartilage in his chicken. Like nickel size. It was so hard he thought it was a bone. He didn't want me to say anything because the experience thus far had already been a bummer. My food came out promptly. It was..... Well I should have just eaten the bread for free. The gnocchi was so soggy that the texture threw off the great flavor of the dish. The flavor was awesome and rich, but the texture was all sorts of wrong. It had a decent amount of lobster too. Needless to say, we skipped dessert and paid. I brought my food home, and nobody will eat it. Overall, for about $110 for two dinners, an appetizer and tap water- not worth it.

Salad: Pear and blue cheese - This was a recommendation given from the waiter. I'm not a fan of blue cheese and neither were my friends. We ended up picking off the cheese. The pear added a nice subtle sweetness to the greens. The best part were the candied walnuts. 

Entrees: We decided to play it safe and order their signature dishes. 
Lobster Gnocchi - Definitely lived up to its expectations. Great dish. Very savory and just the right portion.
Short Rib Ravioli - Also very tasty. Came with about 12 raviolis, which was a perfect split between 4 ppl. i liked this one more than the Lobster Gnocchi.

At a conference at the MGM, we decide to splurge on one of the restaurants in the casino since they looked good and were convenient.  We decided on Fiamma and as it was pretty early got seated right away.  Our waiter was good and attentive.

We had some excellent cocktails. 

We were not excited by our appetizers.  I got a $16 beet salad - and the beets were uncooked.  I love beets, but I love them cooked!
My coworkers was sad that her $14 Ceasar salad was about 2 long leaves and 4 croutons. 

For our Primi dish, I shared the lobster gnocchi ($29) with a coworker.  They were great.  I'm not usually a big gnocchi fan, but these were fantastic.  Large chunks of lobster too, not just a few shreds.

For my main course (Secondi), I ordered the $28 chicken with polenta.  It was good, but not exciting.  Maybe I should have gone with the Risotto after all....

I sampled my coworkers creamed potatoes and they were delicious.

Finally I had the gelato, which was authentic tasting and seemed freshly made. (I'm a huge fan of gelato, so it's important they get it right!)  I chose pumpkin, amaretto and chocolate caramel.

summary: 
Enjoyed the martini, the gnocchi, the creamed potatoes, the gelato
Not a fan of the appetizers: beet salad, casear
Ok, but unexcited by: Pollo (Chicken)

Was it worth 82.50 (pre-tax/tip)?  I'm not sure.  I've had better Italian for cheaper, but it wasn't in Vegas where everything is overpriced.

Worth trying yourself if you can afford it, but I think next time if I'm going to spend that much I will try somewhere else, like the Italian places in the Venetian next time I'm in Vegas.

Being that I'm Italian and this was the first time I was away from family during Christmas I wanted to keep up the tradition of Italian food for my Christmas dinner. We had reservations for 7PM on Christmas Night which we were late for as always . They found our reservation and seated us right away. The restaurant is beautiful however, It's very open to the hallways of MGM Grand so you can people watch. The back of the restaurant has a fire going and a lounge to have drinks. The rest is the restaurant. The place has a great feel to it and gives a very classy feeling. Also, anyone that's been to MGM Grand knows how easy it is to find anything in there...sigh . The waitress was very nice and great company to talk to. We started out with the Wine list and they have a very large and good wine list here. I'm a wine fan and was very impressed. Since I was not alone and as I would say was ballin' on a budget we went with a cheaper wine on the menu. We ordered the Corvina which is red for anyone that has not heard of it. Here is the description per the restaurant Corvina: Medium to port like with bursting black cherry, raisin, and fig. So, ordered the Valpolicella Classico, Brigaldara, Veneto 2006. The lady brought out the wine opened it and explained to my friend the best wine openers and proper way to open wine. She always made sure our wine glass were full and almost never had to pour ourselves. The bottle was $40.00 and pretty good. I was surprised how much I liked it and would most likely get it again. After this we ordered the Calamari and OMG this was the best calamari I've ever had. Was so good and I would highly suggest to anyone that likes Calamari!!! My friend ordered the Rigatoni which looked really good and she liked a lot. I went with the Raviolini which is a short rib ravioli, Barbera wine, and Imported Pecorino Romano. Wow this was so good. The waitress said this generally this is not enough food for guys and asked if I would like a salad which I declined. I can see that for some the raviolini might not be enough food so take that in mind if you ever go. The flavor of everything I ate here was top notch and so was the location and atmosphere was the same. I highly suggest this location to anyone that wants a great wine selection and awesome food. Food by no means is cheap here and meals were about 20-22 per entree. With all we ordered our bill was around $107.00 pre tip. I loved this location and will most certainly will be going back.

From the get go our experience here was great. We decided to get the fall menu which let us choose one apetizer,one entree and came with a dessert trio from their special fall menu. 

My friend chose the fried calamari (with zucchini and deep fried pepperoncino) and I chose the calabrese salad as an appetizer. Both were delicious. The salad was fresh and the mozzarella was so soft it melted in my mouth. I have never had such a delicious calabrese salad before. The calamari was light and not the least bit greasy, and the fried peperoncino was spicy salty goodness that was absolutely addicting! 

For our entrees I chose the spinach and ricotta ravioli with a butter sage sauce, and my friend had the roasted chicken with fingerling potatoes and mushrooms. The ravioli was great. I found the sauce a bit too rich for my taste, but it was still very good. The chicken was mind blowing delicious. The BEST chicken I have ever had. Moist, tender and so flavorful! 

The dessert trio was orgasmic - tiny tiramissu,tarftufo and panna cota - Oh my! All three were great, with the panna cotta being my favorite.

It almost goes without saying that it's overpriced. With that being said, we were also paying for service and atmosphere. Fiamma delivered on both for my group of 13's recent visit.

I was worried this would be the type of restaurant that doesn't provide bread. Luckily that was not the case, as my group was thoroughly able to enjoy the sourdough olive bread and twisted rolls. The two spreads were much more exciting than butter, although I don't recall exactly what they were. 

A few us split the burrata with roasted red pepper. It's a good thing we split it because it was actually a decent portion of cheese. We had to use some of the above mentioned rolls once we depleted the supply of bread that came with the appetizer. The burrata was a little bland, but I believe that's just how burrata is by nature. 

For my main, I had the Mezzaluna. I can't believe I paid $24 for a pasta dish, but I can't say no to pesto. It was definitely unique to me, as I've never had basil filled pesto. The cherry tomato sauce was more exciting than a traditional tomato or marinara, and the aged ricotta was a nice touch. In the end of the day, it was just a ravioli dish. 

I also had a glass of ""Ronco del Cero"" Sauvignon Blanc that I didn't care for too much. That's on me for ordering a Sauv Blanc from Italy when I prefer them from New Zealand. 

We were stuffed and had a long night of drinking ahead of us so passed on the dessert.

We decided to go for the tasting menu of two appetizers, three entrees, two desserts, assuming we'd get cute little portions.  Since we loved the sound of the entire menu, this afforded a chance to try a bit more of things, and for $60 a person, seemed fair.  We had cesear salad, carpaccio, seafood risotto, rigatoni with an amazing ragu, and the shortrib, plus a chocolately dessert and a cheesecakey dessert.

The flavors were sublime.  Complex, deep flavors, with nice twists (like a bit of mushroom on the carpaccio).  Everything was cooked perfectly (including perfect al dente pasta) and presented wonderfully.  A subtle hint of lemon in the risotto, the layered seasonings on the short rib, everything to perfection.

The service was good--we told them we were in a hurry and they had no issue serving us quickly, but made it feel unrushed.  And the portions--lordie--we THOUGHT this was a tasting menu, with small portions, but I am pretty sure we had full servings of everything.  We had late night dessert and lunch the next day, and still had more leftovers.  Fiamma served up the best ratio of quantity to quality I've ever seen.

I feel Fiamma is perfect for a special occassion, but fine for a more casual night out, good for a romantic dinner, or good for friends or business.  It can be hard to find a restaurant with such a flexible style, especially in Vegas.

This Calamari is different than most because it's served with crispy Pepperoncini that gave a great tart-vinegar balance to the fried Calamari.

We were seated in a very comfortable table for four (even though we were only three) and had THE best view of Studio Walk [er, um, I mean The District]. This is significant because it's the absolute BEST people watching spot in the entire building. 

Professional service throughout. I ordered some ravioli with a side of parmessean asparagus. It was good and just filling enough.

Bread with balsamic and olive oil is served at every table with two different types of bread.

We started off with the beef carpaccio which was very good. Thinly sliced and melts in your mouth. 

My mom got a prefix meal with calamari and salmon with tiramisu as dessert. The calamari was soft and chewy nice crunchy outside, the salmon was soft and tender with grilled artichoke and half onion. Tiramisu was made with dark chocolate and had a nice balance between sweet and bitter. 

My dad got the traditional gnocchi with lobster and vegetables. I only tried a piece but it was good from what I could tell.

My boyfriend got the ribs and it came with potatoes puree and carrots. The meat was so soft it melts in your mouth.

I got the daily special linguini with white truffle oil in a cream sauce with regular  mushrooms and prosciutto. It was probably the best linguine I've ever had. I also ordered a crème brulé that came with a pistachio biscotti, a nice change from the usually almond or chocolate dipped.

1501469,2015-01-23,3,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"My friends and I came here for a birthday dinner before clubbing at Hakkasan. 8 of us total. We originally wanted to go to Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill but was not able to get a table. We ended up here by chance. The hostess got us seated right away so no problems waiting, awesome. My boyfriend and I decided to share an entree because we wanted to avoid feeling heavy at the club. We also thought the entree portions were huge enough to share after we saw other tables receive their food. Some of my friends opted for the same choice of sharing entrees too. What's wrong with sharing, right? 

Well our waitress was apparently against it. I will get straight the the point: She ruined our night and my friend's birthday celebration with her rudeness. With an attitude, she explains to my friends that the ravioli is ""only like 6 tiny pieces"" suggesting that it was not enough for the couple to share. When my friend orders the caprses salad, she replies, ""That's it?"" Once it was my turn, I confirmed that my boyfriend and I decided to share the lobster gnocchi.  My boyfriend made a joke saying he was on a diet, and she replied, ""I don't believe it one second."" She was completely rude to our whole table with her obnoxious attitude and monotonous tone. We all felt degraded and lost the appetite to eat. We can handle bad service at fast food joints but to be treated this way at a high end restaurant is not acceptable because we are also paying for service as well!

My friend who also ordered the lobster gnoochi to himself got the dish first. His entree comes in a rounded white full-sized plate. On the other hand, the lobster gnoochi that I ordered to have shared comes in a boat-shaped bowl, half the size of the full-size plate. The server hands us my portion of the entree and leaves. No one gave us the heads up that our entrees were going to be divided in advance. My boyfriend's portion of the entree has not arrived yet so of course I'm questioning what the heck happened...After a few minutes, our server comes back with my boyfriend's portion of the entree and then explains that it was spilt up by the kitchen which is not a problem; however, a notice would have been nice. Everyone at the table including myself was questioning if the server had thought we ordered the half portion.

On to the food...The lobster gnocchi was very heavy. And oh boy, I'm SO glad that I shared this plate with my boyfriend. The sauce was good but it made me feel uneasy afterwards. My friends who ordered the same entree felt the same way too. And I'd have to say that the lobster pieces were too small. It was good but not great. We also ordered the crispy yukon gold potatoes as a side and it failed us. It was dry and bland, not worth $10. I rather take that money and buy a bag of potatoes at the grocery store! I also tried their lasagna that my friend ordered and it was nothing spectacular. Our bill for the gnocchi and potatoes including gratitude was $58.01, what a big waste I tell you.

After we paid for our bill, my friends who also work for the serving industry politely pulled the manager aside to explain to him our experience. As expected, he did not show any interest, tried to defend the server, and quickly just gave us a short apology. We all left this place feeling robbed. I don't ever see myself coming back but sadly I will always remember this horrible experience when I visit the strip. AHHHHH.",Xpm2w4y25FJb-zXQjYYYdA,9,0,1,zRdiWQ-GbLNV5AGym6cR2g

We had about 25 people and they did an excellent job. My glass was always full (water, champagne, wine.. :) and service was quick and friendly. We setup the large party family style menu, so there were good sized portions and a little bit of everything. I worried the quality would not be as good as a regular dinner since it was scaled up in portion, but everything was just perfect. Some of my family is picky (and my dad decided to order outside of the menu we setup) but even they all raved that it was a great dinner.

As others said, the drinks are really pricey. The first time we came here my husband got a $12 beer I think but it was so good he started ordering them online when we got back to CA :) But if you are looking for a nice dinner out while in Vegas, definitely try this place because the food is so good. 

OH, and I almost forgot the best part. For our dessert, they asked if we wanted the standard desserts from the large party menu or a wedding cake. I opted for the wedding cake so we wouldn't have to hire another person to do that. We were so impressed with the outcome. The only input I had to give was the flavors/ colors I wanted and I showed them our wedding website and asked if they could do something like it. It was like something straight outta Cake Boss! It was so well detailed. I guess the chefs here can do anything. It looked great and tasted great too.

The sauce had just the right amount of fresh tomatoes in it.  Others in my party ordered the seafood gnocchi and the ravioli dish (butternut squash I believe) and they were not disappointed.

First, it's a little hard to make the place feel cozy when it's along the main walkway from the convention center to the hotel. With the right lighting, warm wood, and great service (minus the hosts), it pulls off that feat! It's also a pretty big restaurant so it's easy to get a reservation (or walk up) even when the hotel is inundated with convention goers.

The food is tasty, there's no question about it. It's also a pretty good value because the prices are reasonable, unlike many of the other options along this walkway. Even the wine list has a handful of relatively inexpensive Napa wines that are worth drinking.

The service was superb, fast, and very attentive.  Since everyone and their mama knew we were late for Chippendale, we were totally catered to..the meal courses were fired left and right to make sure that we didn't miss our show.....now who doesn't like to be pampered.   

Fiamma decor is of romantic-comtemp with high ceilling wall art and dimmed lighting, a great place for dates/girls & boys gathering.  We were recommended by the friendly manager to order The Chef Choice for $55 and it was way worth it because the food was just ""Excellente"".  The meal was so good couldn't put my fork down.  I'm not easily satisfied to usually give a place five stars but Fiamma warrents all five and more.  My friends and I were raving about how amazing the meal was. Right when we were seated we got comlimentary champagne :0)   

The Chef choice (CC) consisted of Chef surprise choosing for a five course dinner. Since all six of us chose CC  we were served each course family style.  The portions were way more than enough.  We still had a lot of food left over and we were stuffed.  First to come was a lightly breaded and fried calamari just how I like it with yummy creamy basil sauce along with a plate of soft mozarella balls flown in from Italy.  Second course, we had cesar salad (I'm usually not a fan of cesar salad but it was great). Third course,  we had pasta dishes consisting of gnocci and beef ravioli.  My fav of the night was the sweet chewy and flavorful gnocci. I'm not fan of ravioli but it was good.  Now just when when thought we were done, the main entree consisted of seabass, braised short ribs, steaks and polenta, daikon marsh patoto, and another fav for the night beet side dishes.  I would never imagine that beet would be so scrumptious ...sweet, crunchy, and  tender to taste. Lets just say I wiped both the gnocci and beet dishes cleaned.

When we thought the food couldn't get any better, a huge dessert plate came out.  Wow I was so estatic and floored on how great and decadent and delicious the desserts were.  Dessert platter included one my fav Tiramisu, Mascapone Panna Cotta and Cheese cake, Croquette ""donut holes"" served with spicy, chocolate ganache, and apple caramel sauce, cholocate truffle, chocolate dome filled with gelato.

Minor gliche, no bathroom inside the restaurant, but can't blame Fiamma so still deserves five stars in my book. 

When at Fiamma, the Chef Choice is defintely the way to go.  Most of my fav were in the meal, it was like the chef was reading my mind.

It was very distracting the entire night when the hostesses kept bending down under their stand to stuff their faces with McDonald's that theyhad tucked away. Very classy! 

As for the food, I had the short rib ravioli that was recommend by most and it was very good. My wife had the scallop risotto. The risotto was cooked very well and tasted great but scallops were undercooked. It was still raw in the middle. The portions are quite small, so if you're looking for a bigger meal, I'd order an appetizer as well. There were probably only 10 pieces of ravioli and the only 3 scallops with the risotto.

Hostess had an attitude problem (our dinner res was for Mon 3/5 at 7 pm and she wasn't the one that was pregnant who was actually very friendly) and then her sour mood put us in a bad mood to start off the dinner night.  We were celebrating my father's 70th bday so I got custom Sprinkles cupcakes and asked if she could take it in the back and she goes ""Sorry...unfortunately we don't do thaaaatttt..."" and walked away. W-O-W.  

Service started off non-existent for the first 15 minutes but our server, Reid, apologized because he was tending to another table and after that was pretty attentive.  I would say if it weren't for him, we probably would have walked out of the restaurant already in a sour mood from the hostess.

Drinks were UBER expensive $17-$19 ea but good cocktails.  For the $ we paid for the meals, I was expecting mind explosion but dinner tasted like something that you would get at Maggiano's.  Calamari was good but standard.  My special dish black squid ink pasta was ""meh"" and I needed parm to help it taste better.  The kid's bucatini pasta dish with one meatball was just ""ok"".  Only the cioppino was worth getting.

The server did a great job bringing out the bday dessert, but the helper who brought it out was going to give it to my husband and the server quickly diverted him to my father at the table.  When we broke out the cupcakes, the server handed our check and thanked us, but gently told us technically we weren't supposed to have outside food.  At least he was super nice about it in comparison to the bitter hostess (you can see how upset I still am from my experience with her).

Overall, hostess started our night off on the wrong foot, service started off slow but finally got better, and the food was OVERLY expensive for what we got in terms of taste and quality.  Our bill was $300+ for 5 adults and 2 toddlers.  I rather spend $550 for the AMAZING meal we had at Momofuku the night before and the service was top notch.  Won't be dining here again or at another MGM restaurant or bother staying at the hotel.  There's so much amazing food and restaurants in Vegas minus the attitude problem.

The best calamari I've ever had, and the green sauce it comes with is incredible. A little garlic and some pesto it tasted like. 
I wanted something simple but didn't see it on the menu, so I requests an angel hair pasta w pesto sauce and prawns and it was so good... But it was $35. I guess that's what you get for a Vegas hotel restaurant.

I had to leave 37 bodies Force Choked out on the ground of Fiamma as a result of my last visit  The casinos are a shining example of how fools and their money are soon parted, the little corner of the MGM was a shining example of how they are also parted from their lives when they try to mock me.

Yes, I order fruity drinks here.  Every time.  And you know what?  I'll continue to do so, because I'm comfortable enough in my masculinity (and the knowledge that this outfit buys me a lot of leeway) to accept that the mixologists at this place are the absolute best in the business, and to put my taste buds in their capable hands.  Don't you judge me!

Their lead vodka jockey, a bloke named Kerry, has apparently won more bartending awards than the amount of planets I've blown up.  Oh, don't you even start with that whole ""You only blew up 1, Darth!"" nonsense...do you have any idea how many takes had to be done before George was happy with the results?  I wasted entire solar systems....and then Pixar came around 20 years later and started making CGI that looked better than the real thing and made all my hard work for naught.

Anyways, where was I?  Oh yes, Fiamma.  So they serve a drink here called the raspberry cheesecake which might very well be the finest piece of alcohol I've ever passed through my respirator.  It was so good that I tipped hundreds of dollars just for the damn recipe.  Yes, it's pink.  No, I don't care.  The 6 of you that started joking that I should exchange my black outfit for one that made me look like the Pink Power Ranger learned that lesson the hard way.  After that drink, I typically put myself in the hands of the bartender, letting them pick the drinks.  So what if I squee'd like a little girl when they handed me one that tasted like a damn cinnamon roll?  The 16 of you who laughed at that?  I hope you had great life insurance policies.  That lemony thing that followed?  If the 11 of you who laughed at my drinking of that had instead noticed that I enjoyed it so much that I Force Blackjacked (my new Jedi trick) everybody in the casino instead of sniggering, maybe you'd still be alive right now.  And the 3 of you who decided to poke fun because I gleefully turned Yoda into the equivalent of a Tickle Me Elmo doll after Kerry pushed that red velvet cake flavoured thing in my direction, when did I give YOU permission to laugh?  Was I tickling you under your chin like I was that little green bastard?  NO.  Enjoy your after-life, morons.

So if I have all this positivity to say about this place, why the 4 star review?  Simple - the food is entirely forgettable.  Pass on it entirely.  Force Float your way to the bar (you *do* know how to Force Float, right?), sit down, decline the menu, and drink.  Then go across the hall to craftsteak for dinner.  

Some of you may have noticed the bodycount is only at 36.  Well that's because Dave from St. Paul Minnesota is reading this review right now and saying ""What a pansy that guy Darth is.  Fruity drinks?  Come on!"".  Yes, I hear you, Dave.  Say goodbye now....

I ordered the spring tasting menu which consisted of a starter, entree and dessert all for $45.  Pretty damn good deal, especially since all categories had something for me.  I picked the caesar salad for starter, which was very tasty, the beef short ribs, VERY delicious.  It was a huge portion, bone in, fell right off the bone and the meat just melted in your mouth.  For an italian place, it was up there of my list of delicious braised short ribs places.  The panna cotta for dessert was also quite good.  It was firm and not soupy, and the honey added a nice sweet surprise since panna cotta is usually not the most flavorful dessert.

Fiamma doesn't quite get it right. The sauces are a bit too heavy and thick, Our bread basket had stale -- yes, stale -- breads. Unacceptable. How about a gentle squeeze before bringing that basket out to the tables?

The meat & cheese plate was uninspired, the caesar was drenched, and the lasagna was a goopy mess. The house-made spaghetti had an odd texture, and even though the waiter insisted the San Marzano tomatoes were from the bucolic farms of San Marzano (no freakin' way), I sensed the redolence of 'can.'

1852918,2008-03-10,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"I went here with a couple of coworkers on the last night of a weeklong business trip to Vegas (which, incidentally, is about four days longer than anyone needs to be in Vegas, ever).  It was about 9:00 on a Wednesday night, and there were only a few other parties in the restaurant, so we got our server Gabriel's undivided and extremely dedicated attention, which was especially appreciated because I was being a serious pain in the behind.  A charming serious pain in the behind, but still.

To start, the three of us split the calamari appetizer.  It was perfectly fried and came with the most phenomenal basil aioli for dipping.  Entrees were slightly more complicated.  I normally have this rule where I will under no circumstances order the same thing as any of my dining companions.  I wanted the the seafood risotto, but I also sort of wanted the lobster gnocchi, and I also also sort of wanted the short ribs.   After a few minutes of consideration, I went with the risotto - no big deal, until our server came back moments later to inform my coworker that for one reason or another her chicken dish was going to take considerably longer than expected.  So she switched to the risotto, and I subsequently felt the need to debate my other options aloud for several moments before getting over it and sticking with my original choice.  I mean, it was a business dinner.  It wasn't like we were going to be eating off one another's plates (which, incidentally, is the entire motivation behind my no-duplicate-ordering philosophy).  Sadly, the risotto was just okay.  It was a little too al dente for my liking and the lobster was woefully overcooked.  My coworker who ordered it loved it though, so either she got the good one or else I've just got me one high-maintenance palate.  I'm betting on the latter.

Dessert was the most impressive part of the meal by far.  The following day was one of my coworker's birthday, and we must have offhandedly mentioned it at some point during the meal while our waiter was in earshot, because he came over with her dessert all specially plated with Happy Birthday drizzled on the plate in chocolate sauce.  It was really thoughtful.  I ordered the gelato.  They have a list of several options, from which you pick three  - I don't remember specifically what they were, but they were all phenomenal and the scoops were huge.  Then, as we were wrapping up our sweets, our waiter came back over with three glasses on Limoncello, on the house, and VIP passes to Studio 54.  It was really one of the most impressively attentive service experiences I've had in a restaurant in my life.  Not to mention, he was cute.  Like really really cute.  Like my coworkers were teasing me, all ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, cute.  Just saying.

The reviews were pretty high, so I thought the food would be delicious, I was wrong. Mostly, I'm angry over paying the price for the kind of food we received. 

One of our picks was the Sea Bass (which you have to pay extra for $$$) needless to say it was plain,   unflavored and the side (kale in some tomato sauce) was not complimentary to the main dish at all. My wife ate about 1/4, when they took it away they did not even ask if we were happy or why we had not eaten it..FAIL! They made no attempts to rectify our disappointing experience. The desserts were mediocre, presentation good, but flavor, again lacking. I ordered the chocolate bread b pudding which I was SO excited about, as I am a fan of bread pudding. Sadly nothing special, in fact it just reminded me of what you find at a lower priced restaurant. 

The plus side to our experience was the sommelier. He did a great paring with my Raviolini.  I enjoyed the choices for amazing wines available by the glass, This definitely made that entree much better.

The skirt steak with potato puree and spinach was pretty delicious though.  Cooked perfectly med rare as requested and the red wine reduction was wonderful.  The spinach was just a few raw leaves placed on top of the puree, like a garnish.  I would have liked the peppery kick of arugula instead.  The butter that came with the rolls was a very strangely sweet truffle butter.  I couldn't decide if I liked it or hated it.  I don't know that I enjoy sweet with the pungent truffle.
The panna cotta with figs was very nice.  The cool and velvety panna cotta was complemented by the rich morsels of dried figs and honey.

Service was prompt and attentive.      We got a chuckle out of the waiter who eloquently described a soup with broccoli and pecarino romano soup with a pancetta accent - when he came back and I asked about the soup again, he said ""broccoli and cheese"".    Not quite the fancy description I got the first time.    I went for it anyway and it was really, really tasty, not your average ""broccoli and cheese"" at all!

I had the scallop and prawn risotto - the seafood was done perfectly!   Alas, the risotto was not quite as good.   A bit underdone and not as creamy as I would have liked to see but the seafood was so good, I'll give them 4 starts anyway.    My husband started with a chopped salad that was huge!   He had the Bustarelle that was really, really good.

Be forewarned- if you get a salad and an entree, the salads are HUGE!

This restaurant was recommended to me by George Carlin. Yes, THE George Carlin, so we scooted over there one night and were seated promptly. 

The prices are what you'd expect for the Strip but I hadn't heard anything about the executive chef, so I wasn't expecting to have my taste buds be punched with flavor. KO.

I had the Manzo that was cooked perfectly with a side of black truffle potatoes served in an all-clad pot. My wife had the lobster Gnocchi, which she talked about for days after.

I had some coffee with dessert, which they brought out in a french press. Nice touch and great eye opener.

However, I totally loved it here! The restaurant is very pretty, the staff is nice, and the food is awesome! I did the Chef's special dinner. Basically, you pick an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $57. There are some items that have a $5-$10 upcharge, but you get your pick of the entire menu.

We got the fried calamari as an appetizer, and it was delicious!!! Large portion, great flavor, and yummy dipping sauces. The bread here is pretty good too - the tomato basil butter is the real star though! 

For my entree, I got the short-rib ravioli (Raviolini). When they brought it out, I thought, ""Hmmm, this portion is a little small."" Omg, I was wrong! It was SO dense and rich!!  I could barely finish it! Seriously delicious! And the presentation was awesome too.

I really like the feel of this place walking in. It had an upscale, but dark and cozy atmosphere. And I didn't feel strange or out-of-place being by myself and in jeans.

I settled into a spot at the bar and was attended to immediately. The bartender was very nice and friendly. He was knowledgeable about the menu and provided suggestions. And he wasn't overly chatty - allowing me to enjoy my meal without having to make constant small talk.

It may be considered a ""boring"" choice, but I knew what I was craving before I walked in - the rigatoni with Kobe beef meat sauce. And I was very pleased with it. It tasted great and was a perfect sized portion - not too small and not too big.

This is only getting 2 stars because I had the most ridiculous thing happen during my dining experience the other day.  

I will start with our drinks. We ordered two cocktails. Both dirty martini's with blue cheese stuffed olives, they were good but not the best martini I have ever had. 
Let me secondly say that the food was delicious. We ordered the beef carpaccio, and tomato caprese with shrimp. It was fantastic. 

We opted to not have dessert as the rest of our party was ready to go out so we decided to get the bill. Are you ready....,

The bill. I understand this is Vegas and food drinks are marked up. I'm totally fine with that. However, our martini's were $12 which isn't that crazy but the crazy thing is the server up charged us a total of 4 times to the tune of $4 each for our blue cheese olives. There was 2 olives in each drink. So each olive was $4. Absolutely appalling. Never would I ever pay that for olives. Unless of course they were dipped in gold. Which they certainly weren't. It became one of the jokes of our trip. That up charge took our martini total to $20 each drink. Would have even been more understandable had I had belvedere or grey goose, but I didn't. 


After talking to the manager he also agreed how absolutely ridiculous that is. He promptly removed some of the olive charges. Sure that was better but it was annoying that I had to say anything at all. I don't like to complain while out to eat. Especially about a bill. 

So all in all beware while dining and watch for ridiculous up charges that the servers or restaurant are trying to slide in there.",-pwvrcd7TGulm0tJeQzHRg,6,0,2,D-mWeuBA9AP4W6OKk0BE0g

My hubby and I planned one of our anniversary dinners at Fiamma due to rave reviews by our friends.  

That evening, we had a reservation already set but we came a little earlier.  The hostesses were able to sit us immediately despite the already long line outside.  

The table we were placed was super cramped, and the way the chairs were arranged and their proximity to the next table even made for a tighter situation.  It was quite uncomfortable to say the least.

I will say, the ambiance was very romantic, especially deeper into the restaurant, away from the big ol walkway through the MGM district.

My hubby ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, which were quite unfortunate.  He said we made better spaghetti at home, and I know he wasn't just trying to sweet talk me. I ordered the braised shortrib which was delicious and super tender.  I also got the risotto which was just ok.  

I saw a photo of crème brulee via their yelp reviews so I excitedly ordered that.  It came back not looking at all like a crème brulee. There was no torched sugar.  In fact the custard wasn't even vanilla. It wasn't a crème brulee at all yet our server assured it was , just ""different""  I wasn't a fan of that at all.

Though the romantic feel was great, we were less than impressed with our overall experience with Fiamma.",P6_r7O8zEjnxTSBkS6WYfg,15,11,3,Nb7HmunqGM2jxGqkKclQbg

Lasagna-loved how the cheeses didn't dominate the flavors. I think it's because they didn't use ricotta cheese. Simple bc it's just meat, noodles and cheese, but man was it done right.

Made a reservation that wasn't needed as this place is far too large.  Interior is nice, staff is very young.  About 10 minute wait in between seating and drink order.  This gave me time to stew over 11 dollar Peroni drafts.  I know we're in Vegas, but this pricing is absurd.

Restrooms are off-premises and standard casino fare.

Salads were nice and good sized but at 15  dollars, they should be.

Short rib ravioli was tasty but a small portion, bread ran low.  I was saved by my wife's gnocchi leftovers that were filling but overly garlicky.  Wife's mother had chicken that looked like a good portion and was reasonably priced.

There was a pre-fix meal that my guy took advantage of. For starters there were three large beautifully grilled and well seasoned jumbo prawns. Great start. Second was heart shaped, portobello-filled raviloli in a buttery lobster sauce. Just the right potion for not being too heavy, but also enough for me to have a bite. My truffle and lobster gnocchi arrived at the same time as his third course, just as it should. My pasta was unbelieably wonderful, the truffle salt was a perfect balance of saltiness to the buttery rich lobster. Plenty of lobster in the dish in terms of value and the noodles were perfectly cooked. His kobe was equally well cooked and seasoned. 

To top it off the dessert also blew us both away, a chocolate covered gnache type ball with warm sauce, and hazelnut gelatto. The second best part of the overall meal, second to the gnocchi. Our waiter was quick, respectful and pleasant.

We leveraged some of John's awesome barista skills. Our drinks were delicious. He actually let me swap in a drink for a Pinot Noir I wasn't 100% in love with. We ordered a few snacks: seafood polenta, meatballs, truffled gnocchi, and the bruschettona.

While waiting on our food, we chatted about Vegas, John's visiting relatives, Cirque du Soleil shows. It was nice talking to a Vegas survivor in a quiet setting about Out There. Out There everything moves way fast, boobie papers are handed out on the strip, and everyone's half intoxicated and somehow justified in acting stupid all damn day. We were pleased as punch not to be walking around among the throng of tourist drunkies. Not yet anyway.

Our food arrived, and our favorite was quickly established to be the seafood polenta. It melted in the mouth and caused that kind of eye-roll movement with each bite. I couldn't control it. The gnocchi we didn't know would be fried. Still, not bad, but I shied away from it. The bruschetta: yum. And the meatballs were just meatballs.

John said hey, you kids are nice, and threw in my first ever taste of Moscato. What a delicious little dessert sip that is. We decided later to get some for tubtime; it's that kind of drink.

We headed off to O, bellies happy and full, having met one of the sweetest baristas in town. Thanks for making it feel all warm and cushy, John. We almost forgot we were in Vegas.",CwBh8Fmr07jFYBKZ2p6Mqg,4,4,4,vfKsimDqmgayMA8b3nFGvA

Upon being seated my Dad mentioned that people in our group had shows to catch and that we needed to be out by a certain time. Now granted there was an hour and a half for time to be in and out it wasn't like we were giving a short window for obligations to be met or hey I'd even say don't go. Just wanted to pre start with that. The time between ordering and receiving the food did seem a bit long and all of us ended up barely getting to where we needed to go. I only mark this off because my Dad is a very easy going guy and he looked pretty disturbed ON HIS BIRTHDAY that they over promised and under delivered on saying it wouldn't be a problem meeting the time window. 

On the side of food I decided to have a gnocchi for the first time and it could possibly be the last time as well. To me it just felt like a doughy potato which maybe it should who knows, but without knowing much what I do know is it was far from the best tasting that it probably could've been.

My wife started with a wild mushroom puree soup which was a special and simply delicious. Next my wife had the ricotta and spinach ravioli which were very tasty. Full of flavor yet light and creamy. She cleaned her plate which she doesn't do very often. I had the short rib ravioli which were very good and I would have again in a second. The short rib flavor was rich and the truffle sauce and wine reduction went really nice with it. The wait staff was fine.

We both had the grilled octopus - nice and tender but maybe too grilled - lots of smoke overpowered the delicate flavor of the octopus. It was in a Lirovnese sauce - heavy tomato and oregano, again not leaving any seafood flavor. Still, not bad. Then, we both had the skirt steak, we asked for it rare because no one can ever do rare in a restaurant, so you'll probably get it medium rare. But they delivered! If anything, my steak was a little undercooked (closer to ""blue"") but my partner's was perfect. Skimpy on the accompaniments - just a little mashed potato -but the steak was delicious. One problem - it's a huge restaurant, if you cook rare meat, it doesn't get all that hot. By the time our server got to it and got it to us, it was barely warm. But I suppose that's how it's going to be in a restaurant like this. One dessert, the tartufo was delicious, but the other, the panna cotta, was really fantastic.

The ambiance was very nice, and I think the ingredients they used were definitely high quality.  But somehow, just didn't quite roll off my tongue like I would've liked.

I started off with the Arancine (beef risotto cake), and while the beef combined with the sauce were delicious, I was not a fan of the fried risotto.  The risotto lost the richness of its flavor, while the fried-ness was just not quite as delicious as say, on a fried chicken or fried okra.  The tomato-based sauce was splendid, however.  

For my entree I got the short rib raviolini. Now, I must caveat that I was disappointed with this entree because there were mushrooms (truffles I believe) in my raviolini, and I do not like mushrooms.  However, the menu didn't SAY that there would be mushrooms, and I believe that the flavor was strong enough that it should've been warned of.  With that sad, I also tried the gnocchi, the linguine, and the rigatoni.  The rigatoni was the best out of the bite that I had... overall the entrees were pretty good, but the mushroom flavored overwhelmed my taste buds a bit and I wasn't able to enjoy the rest quite as much.

While this place was reasonably good, I would definitely recommend Circo at the Bellagio over this.  Prices there were comparable from what I remember (went a few months ago), but the pastas were far more delectable.",Ek2ZL_Ydwba1Nhdp0F1mTg,0,0,3,OjsPgjCWEFKHMgpiUE5fnA

I'm here for a huge convention. Giving someone another drink, a free dessert, small discount, or comping them a glass of wine for their wait is small in comparison to unhappy customers who take to one star reviews. 

When I got back to my room, I called the front desk manager, explained my experience to him.

My family and i made a reservation over a month ago ahead of our visit to Las Vegas. At the time of placing the reservation I said we were celebrating my fathers 70th birthday. At the time of the reservation I shared that I would be bringing my family, including my two young children. Never was I asked about high chairs or the need to ""request"" these ahead of time.

When it came to the time to sit and have dinner we clearly had two young children with us. They are hard to miss. We got to the table and I asked the hostess for two high chairs. She abruptly said ""did you request them in advance "". I responded that I didn't, but I did say I was bringing 2 kids. Now I would like two high chairs. She got very snobby with me and said ""I was just asking"". 

Now we are standing at the table waiting, not a big deal, we took one of the chairs at the table and moved it. The same hostess came back over and put the chair back at the table telling us to NOT touch the chairs. This girl is a real snobby piece of work.

I did mention all this to the manager towards the end of our meal who said I'm sure it was a misunderstanding, and she has had some communication issues in the past. He would address it with her. So in conclusion, this hostess needs to be sent home. She just about ruined our evening before we were even seated, and from the sounds of it, she is a known problem.

Fiamma is located at the MGM grand. Down a hallway of some heavy foot traffic. But don't be deterred. Once inside the restaurant, you can't hear the outside hallway noise and only what's going on inside the restaurant. Interior is nicely lit and provides a very romantic atmosphere. 

Service was outstanding. Greeted kindly when we arrived. Waitress was awesome and very attentive. Food arrived in a timely manner. 

The food here overall is fantastic !

We ordered:

Calamari - our least favorite dish. Served lukewarm. The calamari wasn't crispy at all - more like soggy. Tasted like they had these out in a big pan under a heat lamp. Cooked hours ago or something.

This might have been a fluke, but the server was very uninterested in working, which really made the visit lackluster. The lobster bisque was adequate. Definitely not worth the $20 it cost. The risotto appetizer was not impressive, but maybe my expectations were too high.

2434181,2010-12-08,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"If the service had been better, this would have been a 5 star rating. Here's the scoop:

We arrived without a reservation shortly after 7PM on a Friday night. Party of five, 10-15 minutes was the quoted time for the wait. Not bad so we went back to the lounge as asked and waited. After about 20 minutes and observing another party of similar size being seated, I went to check on our status. They didn't have my name - even though I had seen them write it down. 

So the hostess says, ""It'll be about 10-15 minutes, is that OK?"" I said, ""Not really, that's the same amount of time I was told the first time I gave my name 20 minutes ago."" She said, they'd get us seated as soon as possible. That didn't happen until almost 8PM - so our wait turned out to be 50 minutes not 15. So it didn't start well.

The other small service shortfall I noted was when I asked for a recommendation between the risotto and the gnocchi. The initial response was, ""well, they're both good"" and nothing more. If I'm at a fine dining Italian restaurant, I don't want an Olive Garden response. The waiter finally said, ""the gnocchi is ordered more often"" so I went with that. I just wish he would have said that at the outset if he didn't have anything to respond to my question.

We managed to get past those obstacles to find that the food was delicious. Each of us ordered different items and found them to be quite good. Pasta was cooked al dente as it should be. The gnocchi I had with bits of lobster was fantastic - nice sauce and great flavor. Overall it was a great food experience. A little pricey - but to be expected at this type of restaurant in Las Vegas.

We had early reservations because we had a show to attend. We grabbed a few drinks at the bar before we were seated at our table. The ambiance was amazing. Very modern, sheek, a little fireplace and lighting really set the mood. The wine coinsurer introduced himself and helped my boyfriend and I pair a wonderful red wine with our meal. 

I had the ravioli special, which had mariposa cheese, veal and sausage. Lets just start by saying that was the absolute best ravioli I've ever had. My boyfriend had a simple cheese and spinach ravioli which was pretty good, but we both decided, nothing near comparison to mine. It literally melted in your mouth. I was savoring every last bite. I didn't want it to end. We also shared the grilled asparagus. It wasn't overcooked and it was seasoned very well. 

The service was amazing. Our server asked what our night looked like and we told him we had a show to attend at 7, so he made sure to have our check ready promptly by 630. He brought us complimentary dipped biscotti. 

This is the closest thing I've found to fine, authentic Italian. I'll definitely be going back. I highly recommend it to any couple looking for a nice atmosphere, a great glass of wine, and a delicious dinner.",dSg40hvzJJkK74ADrVHoBg,0,0,5,eFOcQ6R2_rnRe-vTowDB3g

We were always impressed with food, service & atmosphere and it became our daughter's favorite restaurant. When she graduated from college this past May and we celebrated with a trip to Vegas, she wanted her special celebration dinner to be here. Our family of five was seated at an uncomfortable table even though I made reservations and requested a nice one and explained it was a special occasion. They reluctantly moved us even though the place was near empty. Our waitress was pleasant but we did not see her again after we gave her our wine order. We ordered a very expensive bottle & requested it be kept cold. The waiter who now was attending to our table was from Yugoslavian, When we asked him if he was Serbian he became outraged because he didn't like Serbs. I told him we were same religion as Serbian and he began berating it saying it was phony. We could not believe he would insult our faith that way! He lied about the price of the special dish my husband ordered. When the bill came the manager would not change the price though we were misled. He never came back to pour our wine so I had to find our ice bucket near another table and pour it myself! Our daughter was sad and disappointed that it was supposed to be her graduation dinner yet we left upset. No one remembered to mention her special occasion though it was on reservation and I mentioned it when we arrived. We will never dine here again. Awful service, misleading prices, food mediocre.

Our favorites included a braised pork dish (off menu), the risotto, and the short rib ravioli.  The pork fell right off the bone, the risotto was super creamy, and the ravioli was just delicious.  The kitchen served us three different desserts, the tiramasu was my favorite.  

During the meal, Chef Pawan came out to check on our group.  He even offered to give us a tour of the kitchen which was a treat.  All of the kitchen staff smiled and greeted us which was nice.  I was half expecting them to be like ""who are these people?""  Chef Pawan educated us on all the changes that have been made in the last several months.  Today, everything is made scratch in house....from the pasta to the stocks...everything.  It was very impressive.

Thank you Chef Pawan, and the Fiamma Staff for an amazing meal.",YqXKUS8LwZVlLkErKIJXhA,1,1,5,pYatbJAV6HBUAI_IbRzrEQ

And it looked a little empty. . . .which was a little concerning but it turned out to be great! It may be because, as the server informed us, they had just did a 180 change on their menu just a couple days ago. (The menu online as of now doesn't reflect the menu we had just 2 days ago)

To start, we had a fried ball of cheese and some other goodness. Difficult to describe. . . but it was amazing! I'm sure if you want to order it you can probably just describe to them that you want a fried ball that has alfredo sauce in the middle. We imagined it to be tiny, but the portion was pretty large. 

For entrees, we had short ribs ravioli which was interesting and delicious. We were expecting about 5 or 6 raviolis, but nope, they gave a plate full and each was stuffed with lots of meat. Yum! And we also ordered the risotto with sea scallops. The risotto was cooked just right, not overly buttery or oily, and was flavorful and not too hard. 

I'd definitely recommend! :) Total bill for appetizer, 2 entrees, and 1 soft drink after tax and tip was around $75.",vOG9YFFFn_OMyItk4WEebw,1,0,5,Aybpvw77RlObzZu9uPa4UQ

Unfortunatey, Fiamma was pretty unremarkable.  Came here last summer for dinner with my family.  It's pretty casual, however, I don't think they'd allow you in without a top or shoes (i.e. if you're coming from Wet Republic).  

The food was okay... a little overpriced, and it really didn't appeal much to my palate.  I remember us ordering the calamari, a caesar salad, the braised short ribs, and some pasta dish.  There are definitely other italian joints I'd hit up before this one.  However, I do want to try the gnocchi--I hear that's pretty good. 

One thing I did like was the ginormous wine selection they had to offer.  They had a sommelier that helped us pick something out.  We ordered a bottle of pinot noir, but really didn't like it much, and he gladly exchanged it for something else.

The service is good.  Nice ambiance.  I'm glad it wasn't directly in front of the casino.

Okay, we are sitting at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and we really enjoyed talking to him. We each had a glass of red wine and decided to order the truffled gnocchi, steamed mussles and meatballs. The gnocchi was okay, I think I just didn't like that it was fried. The meatballs were enjoyable, but I guess I was expecting something a bit more special since it sounded so good on the menu. The mussels were excellent.

2622949,2018-03-14,1,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"We just returned from Vegas celebrating my husband's birthday. We travel to Vegas quite often and have been to many restaurants, in fact it is one of the things we enjoy going to Vegas to do. My husband had a list of different restaurants he was considering to celebrate his birthday dinner and we had been to Fiamma twice before, so this is were he decided he wanted to go, so a friend who was travelling with us made the reservation and made sure to let the restaurant know that we were celebrating a birthday.
When we arrived at the hostess station, that same friend asked if the hostess was aware of the birthday in our group and she said she was but not once even acknowledged my husband to say happy birthday, she actually didn't even acknowledge him at all.
This is actually the reason for the review.  Not only did the greeter not greet him with a happy birthday, neither did anyone we came into contact with on that night, including our waitress Erica.  At one point, we asked a man there, not sure of his position if he would mind please taking a picture of our group at our table as we were there for my husband's birthday, he acted like he couldn't give a shit and then just handed the camera back without even saying a word.  The fact that our own waitress did not make any mention whatsoever of it is the thing that really bothers me.  That and the fact that we hardly saw her the entire time we were there.  Being we had a late reservation, I am assuming that she was more interested in doing her clean up for the night to go home, than providing good customer service.
We were not looking for anything freebies or discounts or anything of that nature, but what we were looking for was for my husband being made to feel special on his important day.  The fact that out of hundreds of restaurants in Vegas he could have chosen, that he picked Fiamma should have said enough for the staff to make him feel good about his choice.  I celebrated my birthday recently as well and when we arrived at my chosen place to have my birthday dinner, I was treated like a queen by everyone of the staff members I came into contact with from the hostess greeting me, to the waitress, right now to the manager stopping at our table to greet me.  THAT is excellent customer service and that is how you treat someone who chooses your establishment to spend a special celebration with.
At the end of our meal, my husband and I went outside of the restaurant to wait for the rest of our group because I knew they wanted to make mention to Erica our disappointment.  I do not know what was said but I can say this, I could see them having a conversation and I could see Erica waving her hands all around and what should have been a very short conversation with her apologizing went on way too long with her doing most of the talking and hand gestures.  Was she making excuses, I don't know, but it sure seemed that way because it never should have gone on that long on her end.  It should have been acknowledged, apologized for and done with.  I can tell you this, I know for certain that we will never spend our money at Fiamma again and that is disappointing.",S4TTeoxlxEoACA0XcPrIxg,0,0,3,F18va6QXKqUJ31QHd4B8JA

If you really want to go all out and not burn your wallet, be sure to do the recommended wine pairing with the sommelier, the wine specialists, who is fantastic!

I'm not sure if she pegged us as a group that wouldn't notice, or wouldn't care based on who was paying, but it was outrageous. Thankfully management handled it, but I wonder who else she's pulled that trick on?

THE OVERVIEW.
+ Flexibility of waitstaff to add more chairs to the table on a busy night
+ Well stocked bar without too long of a wait, and stiff drinks poured all around
+ Ample portion sizes for the price (excess is everything in Vegas, isn't it)

The restaurant itself is beautiful and the service was great! It is situated at MGM Grand closer to the MGM Signature towers walkway. I am and always have been a sucker for fresh Pasta, this place definitely delivered. It was not the best that I have ever had, but it was definitely good. 

Vegas restaurants know how to create an atmosphere! Fiamma Italian kitchen would be a great place for a romantic date, or a semi-formal dinner with friends. Everything is A La Cart so be prepared to spend a little extra if you want a salad with your dish. It's a bit darker environment, but a pleasure to eat in. Wine list and drink menu was great. Services was ok, but not on par with the food. We went on a Monday night.

Located in the MGM, this fancy little Italian restaurant was our spot for my girl's bachelorette dinner.  We had reservations and everything went smoothly, staff was friendly and attentive.

I guess I just wasn't amazed by the food.  I only enjoyed one out of the 4 courses, but at least it was the entree.  Our four course prix fix meal was around 75 bucks:

*salad- looked and tasted average
*small bowl of spaghetti- basically tasted like prego or ragu over noodles
*grilled sea bass- this was good and it was actually a pretty nice portion
* dessert looked like creme brulee but was not creme brulee.  I wish I could remember the name so I could warn you all not to get it.  The waiter said there is an alcohol in it, whatever it was there was waaaay too much in it.  The dessert was awful and I could only take two bites and I was done.

The service was only matched by the quality of food. I was here during restaurant week and the restaurant offered a sampling for a great price. I opted for this along with the wine pairings. All I can say is EXCELLENT!

The raviolis were perfect as was the dessert (i cant remember the names.) The appetizer was the weakest of all the items. Some of my coworkers enjoyed their food but said it wasn't worth the price, but then again everything is overpriced in Vegas.

Oh and what Italian restaurant does not server Italian sausage year round n has an excuse that it isn't in season?  Weird cause I can get Italian sausage at the Italian market tomorrow to make my home made spaghetti sauce.  Then to top it off they gave us burnt tasting coffee.  We are never going back.

2985149,2010-11-15,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"I went to Fiamma with two groups of ten and I had some excellent food paired with some of the worst service I've ever had at any restaurant.

I get that having a group of 10 can be difficult but it can be done.  My group had an awful experience which ruined the evening while the other group had an alright experience and at least was able to get out in time to see their show.  They were able to get out in a respectable two hours while it took us about three with several people having to rush out to catch their show.

When we got there, it took the waiter about 20 minutes to simply take our drink order and maybe another 20 minutes later we had to flag the waiter down from across the room to get him to take our food order.  The food took an incredibly long time to get there and when it got there the lucky few that had warm food had good food while everyone else had luke warm to cold food.

After the food came out came more waiting.  The four people that had to get to a show again flagged the waiter down and got him to offer them dessert.  The odd thing was we were all obviously finished with our dishes yet only they were offered desserts.  Shortly after their desserts came out with their checks and then our waiter disappeared again.

One of the people left got the tasting menu and she was due dessert and all the rest of us were waiting to be offered a dessert menu (the waiter of course took the menus after taking the others orders).  Again, we sat for a really long time until we finally saw the waiter again and flagged him down.

At this point we were just ready to go so we asked for our check and reminded him that one person still had a dessert coming.  He completely ignored her, didn't say sorry or even acknowledge the mistake, he just left again.  Luckily he ended up bringing the dessert with the checks but again, no sorry whatsoever.

One final time we sit and wait with our checks until he finally took them and we were finally able to leave three hours later, an entire hour after our other group.

One important note that if you go here with a group of 11 or more people, the restaurant requires a $500 deposit and then a $125 booking fee.  It's a horrible and stupid deal, don't do it, especially seeing that the restaurant just doesn't know how to handle groups.

Even cold the food at Fiamma was really good, it's the reason I'm giving two stars and not one, but we just had some of the worst service any of us has ever had at a fine dining restaurant.  I will never go there again and with all the incredible options in Las Vegas I don't think I could recommend anyone else ever go there either.",WuEJ6lcHcNrtEAK1YgIqhA,0,0,2,nTuQ_t4MOH2qbVsCOh0G0A

The restaurants atmosphere was a bit of dim lighting, great for group dinners or a date night in vegas. We shared a few dishes and it was plenty for us to eat. For starters we ordered their CAESAR SALAD, and I kind of wished that I asked for dressing on the side. Honestly, I am not much of a dressing person so  don't take this to heart. I enjoyed the salad and it was just a bit on the dressier side for my taste. For main dishes we ordered the HOMEMADE FETTUCCINE with prawns, creamy basil pesto, and yummy toasted pine nuts. The pine nuts were a great touch to add to the basil pesto sauce, and it wasn't too creamy or heavy to eat. Our last dish we ordered their RISOTTO with SHAVED TRUFFLE. I think it was part of their season menu, and it was well worth it. Risotto was cooked perfectly, and the truffle on top was just a nice topper....

Fiamma Trattoria & Bar is one of those restaurants that could easily be lost in the shuffle of many great Vegas establishments.  Yet, this little restaurant that is tucked away behind the casino of MGM Grand can offer rich flavors like no other.

For appetizers, we order the Beef Carpaccio.  It came with thinly sliced beef tenderloin topped with arugula, mushroom, and permesan cheese. 

The popular Lobster Gnocchi came with classic Italian gnocchi that is just the right texture, not too soft or too chewy.  The lobster meat tasted fresh and cooked perfectly.  This dish definitely packs a punch of rich flavors, although it might get a little overwhelming at the end.

I also tried the Braised Short Rib.  It was very tender and again, very rich in flavor.  The rib was placed on top of mashed potato so the flavor of the rib actually got into the mashed potato, which I like.  

All in all, a very good and hearty meal, which could be hard to find on the Strip.  I can't wait to go again.",jw-67o0IfOxErq3M4C_2Qg,3,1,4,xmVii2o5XGvXat63JXX3QQ

My dinner tasted amazingly I enjoyed the calamari, my steak was cooked beautifully perfectly seared and seasoned and so juicy and pink an awesome medium rare (oh I loved it!!) and the dessert was great but I was so full by then but the chocolate ganache along with the tiramisu was great together. And all this for a great value of $45 yum! My cousin the lobster gnocchi and it was awesome, that was my second choice, and it was as good as it sounded the lobster pieces were huge very yummy I may have to order that next time. My boyfriend ordered the rigatoni and the pasta was obviously freshly made and it was so very good I enjoyed it also!

Some Negatives: Ohhh this is what killed dinner experience! The service was HORRIBLE!!!!!! It still irritates me to think about it now.

While we waited our waiter introduced himself and took our drink orders and said he'll be right back when our guest joins us. Well they came within 15 minutes and we never saw our waiter again!! We waited patiently but we were hungry so we stopped the bus boy to see what's holding up our waiter and our nice bus boy said he'd get him but I guess he was too busy so our bus boy took our order, odd I know first time experience especially at a fine dining restaurant but we dismissed it we just cared that our order was taken so that was by 1020pm lets say. Waited waited waited chatted chatted chatted by 1045 we were served our appetizer. Yummy yummy enjoyed finished by 11 something that's all we had?! By that time our patience had run out! My cousin left the dinner table to gamble while we waited that's how long we waited!! We asked our bus boy again, we asked, 'We know your not our waiter, but what's up with dinner.' and he went and took care of it 15 minutes later we got our dinner still just my boyfriend and I were the only ones at the table so we ate and enjoyed. My cousin was still gambling and 10 minutes later our bus boy noticed the food was out and they hadn't gotten back so he offered to put it back under the heaters to keep it warm. How nice is that of him. And as soon as my cousin came back he served the food to them. I was ready fro dessert and asked for it but still took a while to get it =/. And it was by dessert that our waiter had the nerve to serve us and ask how dinner was etc blah blah blah biggest BS no apologies no excuses either!! When I got my dessert we asked for our check also we wanted out by this time it was 1240!!! WTF really?! a 3+ hour dinner?! Anyway, enjoyed dessert we tipped the bus boy personally he was awesome and so helpful he still did his bussing duties while helping us and we paid tab w/ NO tip and left.

3043905,2011-07-25,1,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"Came here for my friend's bachelorette dinner pre night on the town.
Fiamma started doing a prefix menu for bachelorette and bachelor parties which includes an appetizer, entree, dessert and your choice of a round of martinis or a magnum of champagne. I think the alcohol choices for the bachelor party are different, perhaps more MANLY drinks, but I was pleased with our magnum of champagne. Between the 6 of us, we each got a few good pours.

For the money, it was a good deal; while I don't think that Fiamma has any Michelin stars, the food was flavorful and well prepared. I actually really liked the parmesan crisps served in the bread basket. Starting out I was not too sure about the cleanliness and attention to detail. After asking for a pepper shaker that turned out to be rancid (wet and clumpy) I asked for a new one hoping that they would throw the bad one away. Our server quickly brought a new shaker; problem solved. 

From the prefix menu I chose:

Insalata: tricolor, a mix of greens with yellow and red cherry tomatoes and parmesan cheese with balsamic vinegrette

Pan Seared Salmon: served with a pesto glaze and bed of spinach. this was a decent size portion and the fish was prepared well, not over cooked so the salmon flaked apart.

Tiramisu: drenched in espresso, I tasted mostly coffee and not so much Kalua or rum but it was still delicious. It had more of a substantial structure I think because of the ricotta used; I like to have more lady fingers in my tiramisu but this was still good.

All in all, damage came out to $77 per person split over 5 people since the Bride to Be of course does not get to pay! So for a nice dinner out in Vegas, magnum of champagne, I think we got a good deal on this one!",rtNeSfIpF3U20n8kaDFM_Q,2,1,4,TxLpcHomGYB6sRng24GzPw

3058910,2016-03-11,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"This restaurant has nice ambiance, great service, and ok food.  Went there for a bday dinner for six ppl. Service was pretty on point: attentive, accommodating, and prompt.  However,I don't think the table next to us had received  the same level of service as our table.  They had to ask to be served (table for four) and were already there before us. So, keep in mind that service level could be inconsistent. 
All of our food came out at the same time which is nice but execution may have suffered due to this reason.  My pasta dish came out cold and were stuck together, so sauce wasn't well coated through out.   Although flavor of the sauce was good, it took away the potential of this dish. It's an Italian restaurant so, I feel pasta should be done right.  So, the expectation to execute pasta dish will be higher than getting the steak right.  Getting the steak wrong would have been more forgivable. 
Others in my group had ordered Cioppino and Steaks.  They seemed to enjoy their dish but noted that Cioppino was more like seafood pasta.  
With so many options in Vegas, I would keep exploring for a better Italian option, especially if you actually care about the quality and execution. 

Overall, it wasn't terrible so it doesn't deserve a ""bad"" rating but certainly wasn't great.  My take away was:  it looks pretty on the outside but lacks substance, not repeat worthy.",ueFFHuEzNgexGkT80zOJjA,2,0,3,PZgTAODKyPNdhqVKRGdtWA

As we were still waiting for one person in our party, the waiter gave us a while to order. He did not seem like the most customer service oriented, but did his job. 
We started off with the Kobe meatballs and calamari to share. The five of us ordered the Pasta Sampler Trio, Mezzaluna pasta, short ribs, sea bass and the Christmas pre fixe menu (mushroom polenta, duck lasagna and a cheesecake)

The calamari was light on the batter, with a side of pesto sauce in addition to the traditional marinara, which was delicious. 
The meatballs were amazing. The seasoning matched the sauce wonderfully and the meat was fresh and not too heavy. 
The short ribs were tender and juicy. 
The sea bass was pan seared and just enough crispiness to still taste the flavor.
The ravioli in the Mezzaluna was delicious and light! 
The trio was filled with strong flavors. One was a lobster gnocchi, a sausage pasta and then a short ribs pasta. The lobster gnocchi was inundated with both the creaminess of the gnocchi, with blasts of lobster. The sausage's seasoning was a little overbearing. 

Desserts were delicious. The cheesecake was not too sweet, accompanied by a pistachio ice cream. Light and a wonderful way to end the meal. The tiramisu was a perfect tiramisu. Just enough alcohol and chocolate to justify it's tiramisu-ness. 

Overall, while the service did not necessarily get me excited, the food (especially the desserts and appetizers) definitely spoke for themselves.",MsGY2d5V19NiCTnS-8h3Tw,0,0,4,6RVkAhwCLWxog714Lsoljg

It's not cheap, but then, nothing in Las Vegas is. (I swear, I think the whole strip fails to realize that the economy is bad...)

we first got some bread w/ some incredible honey truffle butter.  honestly, this should be sold.  so addictive w/ a great balance of flavors.  for appetizer we decided to split the burrata w/ tomatoes and basil.  unreal.  the cheese was beautifully soft and the pesto vibrant.  a tad bit more salt would be nice but still a fabulous dish.

for mains, she got a custom dish which was a linguini w/ beets and broccoli in a black truffle creme sauce and i got the lobster gnocchi.  we both got white truffle shavings on our dishes.  both of our dishes were freaking good.  the lobster in my dish was cooked perfectly and the gnocchi was light and pillowy.  the beets in her dish added a beautiful sweetness and texture w/ her pasta.  both were stellar dishes.

what truly lacked in the restaurant was that we were practically forgotten about after we put in our order.  we would go long periods of time where our wine glasses would be empty (we had gotten a nice spatlese).  our waiter hardly checked in on us though he was incredibly friendly.  we were perplexed with how attentive they were before we put our order in and how non-existent they were afterwards.  we primarily decided not to have dessert due to this (that and we were pretty darn full).  only this one busboy would notice that we were looking around waiting and then call someone over.  i'll only dock one star because every other aspect of the restaurant was beautiful.  the service could be an isolated incident and i'm pretty sure others probably did not experience what we did.  if you're learned anything from this review, go to eat and enjoy some great food!",gEx19xm2RZQo4XdobKGkWQ,1,0,4,GsWuRnL3UAIpuhY3tXWPOQ

We started off with bread and the sun-dried tomato pesto. The pesto was excellent. The bread was decent. The Kobe meatballs were tender and flavorful, but the accompanying bread was too charred and overpowered any other flavors. 

For entrées, I got the gnocchi(lobster) and my girlfriend got the short rib and truffle pasta. The gnocchi was worth the price of admission. Complex and rich with velvety gnocchi. Her pasta was okay. There was not much texture change with soft noodles and short rib. The truffle and short rib gave the dish nice earthy components, but to balance it out I would add something crisp and something to brighten the flavor. Possibly thin crispy fried balsamic onions and baby peas.

We had the chocolate torta for dessert. The star was the Gelato. However the cake was on the mealy/dry side. It seemed like the dish was plated and refrigerated. The ganache on the plate had lost all viscosity.

I actually ended up eating a lot of the complimentary bread, which was a cheese baked dinner roll, which was actually pretty good. The ravioli that I had for my entree was definitely good, but I felt a bit cheated about the price.

If you're looking for a good atmosphere to bring a date (and impress them with your spending prowess), I guess this is your place.",q133OMilfh3UkGw3Ha06eA,0,0,3,9Xw--9LEU7j0waXS4YU3HA

We went with the Spring tasting menu - what a good choice. I started with the Capesante (grilled scallops, spinach, crispy onions, with a smoked bacon vinaigrette). This dish was perfect. I loved every bite and I loved the smokiness of the scallop and bacon. We also ordered the braised Kobe beef risotto cake. There were actual chunks of kobe beef rather than ground meat, which I appreciated. It tasted so good. For an entree I had the rigatoni with prosciutto, sausage bolognese and parmesan. It was delicious. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was chunky and flavorful. My wife had the gnocchi with lobster, portabello, and black truffle crema. She loved every bite of hers. We couldn't stop commenting on how good the food was. For dessert I had the tartufo--a dolce di latte gelato, with caramelized hazelnuts, a chocolate dome, and a warm chocolate sauce. It was awesome. So rich and delicious. My wife got the tiramisu and said it was one of the best she'd ever had. What a value. 

The service was spot on as well. Our meal was well paced, the ambiance was beautiful, kind of dark, a little moody, yet chic. Love the fireplace and loved the food. Great fine dining experience.",6yoLIq4bN-xo_L0GZoHu3A,0,0,5,ExuqQCTBCSXXKK97SH4CIw

Service was off the mark. We had an misunderstanding. The waiter thought we just wanted appetizers and ignored us for quite a while. I think it might have gave him alarm as we devoured lots of bread before the appetizer arrived; couldn't help it. Service was slow for a half empty dining room.

We were starving and were finally able to order. It was like he was ignoring us. His body language showed some sense of being annoyed as he cleared our entree plates away. 

I was thinking, ""Whoa there. I'm about to eat way more. You haven't seen how much I eat.""

After 10 minutes or so we finally got a hold of him again and his demeanor quickly changed when he realized we were going to drop $200 on dinner.

Regardless of the service snafu, the food was just alright. I had the lobster gnocchi. The sauce was a cream sauce cooked in olive oil and some wine i think. The lobster was a decent portion. There were several claws and it was enough to share with.

They have  Winter Tasting Menu they are offering at this time that is nice for those who may be on a vacation budget. (prix fix $45 pp; three course meal).

Hubby started out with the calamari, which were lightly battered and well seasoned, surely flavorful, it also came with a dip that I think had cilantro, mayo... and some other things, but delicious! I had a mixed salad, had crumbled blue cheese, and pistacios, absolutely yummy.

For the entrees hubby got the House Special, which was Surf and Turf! It was to die for! Juicy steak and lobster with potatoes... so tasty. As for me the I had the Spaghetti with Kobe Meatballs, and that was very flavorful as well.

Service was descent.  Wine/Alcohol options are presented on an iPad, which is unique.  Overall, it's a descent restaurant and I had a pleasurable experience.


CRISPY CALAMARI:  It met my calamari standards.  A lot of the calamari pieces came in octopus shaped pieces haha.  

KOBE BEEF MEATBALLS:  Huge meatballs that we split amongst us.  Packed with flavor and it was awesome.  It came with ciabatta bread that is perfect for dipping into the pomodoro sauce.  

SEAFOOD PLATTER: An appetizer dish that has a little bit of everything.  It comes with 4 oysters on a half shell, 4 prawns, half a lobster tail, and ahi tuna tartare.  I loved everything.  The tuna tartare had a kick to it, which was perfect for a spicy lover like me.

FIAMMA TRIO OF PASTA TASTING: This dish gives a tasting of three of the Chef's Favorite Pasta Dishes.  I don't think you'll be full as the picture I took shows the portion size.  I would suggest getting the actual dish instead.  Here were the pastas...

---TRADITIONAL POTATO GNOCCHI: This lobster gnocchi was really good.  You can taste the truffle and the gnocchi is made really fresh.  I understand its popularity!  It was the only one I think worth ordering of the three.
---AGNOLOTTI: This was beef, veal, and pork ravioli.  I didn't like the flavor of this at all. I can't even tell you what bothered me, but I just didn't enjoy it.
---ORECCHIETTE: This was broccoli and spiced sausage with tomatoes and pasta.  This was just average and came out just what I expected.

RAVIOLINI:  This was my order of the night and it was great!  Usually ravioli entrees come with three or four fat raviolis and you're left hungry.  This dish came out with a bunch and I left perfectly content.  The truffle cream is amazing and the short rib ravioli is really yummy!

HOMEMADE FETTUCCINE:  This is such a filling plate.  The fettuccine is well made and the creamy basil pesto sauce is good.  The sauce is quite dominant and strong, so a head's up to those who don't like that.  Prawns were big and scattered in the dish. 

BAROLO BRAISED SHORT RIB:  The flavor of the braised short rib was amazing.  To me it had a hint of asian seasoning and this is definitely a great choice for those who are craving meat.",GUCac_iRt07wvgwCt9Y3Fw,6,4,4,pRF2kTApQTcO7RVbtRtcEw

I love the decor. I love chic places. It was also nice to see a little reception dinner for a newly married couple. I've always contemplated a Vegas wedding. The tab would be under a grand. Nice! Anyway, dinner was awesome. The hostess brought us to our table pretty quickly and they even accommodated us when we wanted to move to a booth. The server jokingly said ""no PDA but under the table stuff is fine"". It was really romantic. A nice getaway from Christmas craziness. We ordered cocktails. The hubs had the Fiamma ""The Original"" and I had the Pineapple Upside Down Cake. The drinks were pretty tasty. Order the Caprese to share. When I order Caprese I don't expect much but some buffalo mozzarella and sliced tomatoes. When the salad came out it was colorful. Chopped up yellow and red tomatoes, strips of basil, and soft buffalo mozzarella and some awesome tasty green sauce. I ordered the Raviolini which is amazing shortrib ravioli with black truffle goodness. It was super good as the pasta was al dente. My husband ordered the Orecchiette. Both of our entrees were good tasting and totally worth it. Prior to dinner we told the server where we were from and that we were celebrating my husband's birthday (even it was a week before). We ordered the Crocchette for dessert which were little donuts made of Amaretto and Ricotta and dipping sauce. The server was so nice he brought us out glasses of champagne and even made a little Happy Birthday display with a candle for my hubs.

The service was top notch and our server was super personable. He was really attentive to us even when the restaurant was close to closing. Overall experience was fabulous.

Definitely make reservations beforehand -- there weren't too many empty tables when we were seated and I'm not sure how long the wait usually is. 

Since we were still kind of full from our brunch buffet, we decided to split two pastas: the raviolini (short rib ravioli) and the traditional potato gnocchi (lobster). The flavors of both were delicious and ridiculously heavy (esp with the cream sauces), so I'd definitely suggest splitting unless you're starving. 

And even though we were ridic full, of COURSE we had to get dessert. We ended up getting the crocchettes. They're ricotta and amaretti doughnuts with berry and chocolate dipping sauces. They're pretty good -- a bit reminiscent of beignets. 

For those who love a cup of joe after your meal, their ""1 cup"" of coffee is more like 2-3 cups cause they give you your own french press. Kind of awesome but just a heads up. And the carafe for the wine isn't really cheaper -- it costs just as much as getting 1.5 glasses of wine (which is how much is in a carafe).

I'd love to come back here for some of that raviolini (what's not to love about short rib ravioli?!) but I don't know if I'd get the traditional potato gnocchi or the crocchettes again.. mostly cause I'd love to try their other dishes!",5Tbj8y-ZVOVbK_VWgvj4pw,0,1,4,yozh6_p1O7zx_APqyDfJig

The atmosphere is lovely; sophisticated without being stuffy and with a modern look that is still warm and welcoming. We pored over the impressive wine list and chose a few great glasses (a Nero D'Avola for me, Rosés for my companions). After perusing the menu, two of us chose the Chef's Menu and another chose one of the evening's specials. I personally had a delicious burrata with heirloom tomatoes to start, and chose a short rib ravioli in a garlic cream truffle sauce as my entree. The ravioli was amazing!! The Chef's menu came with a choice of dessert and I chose an orange and chocolate creation with cilantro (yes, cilantro!) that came elegantly presented in a bowl with dry ice.

During my first visit to Fiamma I sat at the bar, had a few drinks and fell for the well seasoned, savoriness of beef topped with frisee, shaved fennel and celery salad and parmesan flakes. Those few bites had me thinking -- or hoping -- that the rest of their food was as good. A return visit a couple months later proved otherwise.

Their bread basket was full of dry and crumbly focaccia. Short rib ravioli was mushy with a sweetness from the sauce that was overpowering. A surf and turf nightly special consisted of a mediocre lobster tail and a dry-aged rib eye with a red wine demi glaze that was the highlight of the meal.

What was worse than the food was the atmosphere, or more specifically, the temperature. It was unusually cold making it one of the more uncomfortable dining experiences in a while. We were ready to head until they brought out a complimentary dessert for my wife's birthday. The tiramisu was a solid rendition, but we were in such a hurry to leave that nothing could have saved our meal.

It had all the credentials of somewhere great but it really fell short for us. 

We had their first reservations as we had to make it to KA,  so we ended up being seated in the bar for a bit while the got organized for dinner.   The bartenders here did a great job,   There were very patient while FMIL selected a wine letting her try several.  I choose a blood orange belini and it was very tasty.  I don't recall what my fiance picked but it was also really good when I stole some sips.  The drinks here were expensive.  I think the three pre diner drinks still came to a $80 tab (but that might have been after tipping) which is pricey but atleast there were good.

The food really fell flat for me.

The bread basket came out with olive oil that was stale.  We asked for a new dish but that one came back stale.  When we mentioned the oil to server he said a bunch of the kitchen tried it and said it was fine including the chef but he'd go get another dish.   The third dish was infinitely better and he said it was from a different can.   I honestly should have been concerned about the palates in the kitchen when I was told the chef couldn't taste that the oil had gone off.... but yet we stayed and ultimately paid for that choice. 

I ordered the feature minestrone soup which was under seasoned and some kind of pasta dish I barely remember (it was unremarkable).  The pasta was a bit over cooked but I liked the sauce.  The food didn't do much for the others at my table.  MY fiance found a piece of shell from the seafood (lobster perhaps..) in one of his pasta trio dishes.  We didn't have time for a remade pasta but they brought us an ice cream coffee thing as an apology for the shell which really helped make the experience a bit better. 

Although our food fell flat,  our server worked his butt off to help make it right where he could (when we felt like discussing the low points like the oil or the shell but we didn't complain about the seasoning or over cooked pasta).  From the service side I was quite pleased.  

This place is pricey but we expected it.  Unfortunately it wouldn't have been good food for even 1/3 or 1/2 the price.  For that reason I would never return and I think it's a bit over rated.  There are too many amazing Vegas spots that to have a return trip here.  Fiamma is right next to several of the better dining spots at MGM and I wimpered a little as I was leaving the restaurant  and seeing the other signs of places I could have eaten at instead.

I shall report in chronological order. First, the bread (challah and some crunchy loaf) was so soft and delicious. Came with two spreads. The tomato basil butter was so good I was tempted to lick the plate (but refrained since it was a sophisticated establishment). Second, the chianti wine was scrumptious. I could sip on that all night long. 

Next, main course. I got the filet, and let me tell you, that steak cut as easily as the tomato basil butter before it. I absolutely reveled in the taste and texture of this meat. The yukon gold potato puree (fancy mashed potatoes) were also delightful and perfect to soak up some of the extra steak juice. Oh so good. Oh my gosh I will be thinking about this steak for a while. Finally, dessert. We were just browsing, but all of them looked so delicious so I couldn't say no. I got the Tiramisu. The chocolate/mocha ice cream and whipped cream were so delicious. There was then a layer of very strong espresso, which for me was too much. It all came in a cute bittersweet chocolate cup. Again, the top part was AMAZING and I would order it again just for that part. Friends got the panna cotta (devoured), coffee-infused creme brulee, and cheesecake. All good choices, all satisfied customers. 

As for the vibe, very classy but not stuffy. We commented on the music selection and even shazamed a few songs. Love the interior decor, especially the woodwork on the wall that looks like waves. This meal was worth every penny.",8ahrzebmEdp8NASJom9Izw,4,0,5,f_LFbDoUSPmN2mchgondZw

The front podium staff is extremely accommodating!
MaryGrace was genuinely nice and understanding when I called to tell her our Saturday 6:30pm party of 10 would be 5 min late because a majority was wearing heels for a bachelorette dinner. She even took a group photo outside for us prior to leaving later that night. 

David, our waiter for the night, asked about time restrictions and never left our waters empty. He wasn't sure if they offered the wine I wanted so he sent over Caleb to answer any questions. Unfortunately, they didn't have Bigaro from Piedmont, Italy but a moscato worked just fine for our toast.

We decided to order two crispy calamari for apps. I really liked the complimentary olive bread with the tomato butter. The white bean lentil spread was ok. My entree was the short rib raviolini with black truffle cream: smaller dish than I thought but was filling due to bread/apps. Tasty, flavorful, and something I'd never had before. I would eat this again. Specials for the night included seafood risotto, surf and turf (steak & lobster), and penne with cream sauce & prosciutto. Risotto seemed popular at my table, the usual dish on the menu had a white sauce base.

I  noticed a response from Fiamma mgt (including phone number), inviting Matt to call to discuss.  That responsive customer service impresses me.  So, my wife and I decided to give them a try.  Wow, were we rewarded!  

I made same-day 6:45p Yelp reservation (3 hrs beforehand!).  Arrived 15 mins early, was greeted warmly and seated immediately.  Bread w/dipping oil and sparkling water (which we ordered) arrived approx.  7 mins later.  Wine arrived shortly thereafter and then our meals arrived (I kid you not) in about 15 mins.  Scallops and Tiger Prawn Risotto was delicious (scallops were evenly seared and tender; risotto was among the best I've ever had).  My wife had the Lobster Gnocchi.  She said it ranked up there with the best she's had, too.  Our waiter-recommended wine pairing was spot-on.  As we ate, we noticed a quiet, efficient, steady flow of orders being being delivered out of the kitchen.  What really impressed us is that we later found out that the restaurant was filled with a large contingent from a well-known computer company.  Yet, you wouldn't have suspected it by the way the restaurant was running.  Our waiter (""Ace"" was the server on our receipt) was personable, attentive, and professional (as was our server).  As we left Fiamma, I spoke to the person that had greeted us, and described how we chose his restaurant, mentioning Matt S' review and the restaurant myt's response.  ""Yes, that was me.  I remember him.""  He then explained that he reads the Yelp reviews and tries to respond to people's concerns.   And I could tell he really means it.  Then he gave me his card -- General Manager.

The menu is pretty large and balanced - plenty of appetizers, salads, pastas, and main courses to choose from (and dessert!). I settled on the special pasta for the day which was the penne in a cream truffle sauce with pancetta and peas. I thought it was really good! Could have used a touch more salt for my taste, but that's my preference, nothing to knock the dish for. My friend had the short rib ravioli and she devoured it within a few minutes (sorry if you are reading this, but, you did). My other friend got the mezzaluna, and hers was by far my favorite dish of all of ours. The cherry tomato sauce was tangy and tasty and the filling was flavorful (ricotta, basil)

I was really impressed by the extensive wine list. They have glasses ranging from $8 for the wine liker and more expensive for the wine afficionado. You can definitely find something of your taste and your budget. And they have so many wines - over 200 I would say. I would die to see their wine cellar.

Service was excellent from the moment we arrived and were greeted by the hostess, to our server, to the management who came over to ensure everything was going well. I would definitely go back the next time I am in Vegas!

While the food is quite good, you don't get the sense that the majority of the service staff really love what they do.  This all starts at the beginning - I can only assume that a raging case of bitch had broken out at some point earlier in the evening, as when I showed up with my party for our 7:15 reservation, the two hostesses not only couldn't manage a smile, but were barely able to hold back snarls.  Not sure what was up there.  

Then, they crammed our party of 5 at a table for 4 - not the most auspicious beginning.  I suspect they were pissed that we were now a party of 5, instead of 6, but come on - really?!  Had I known that our 6th diner would have gotten so sick (which would have required omniscience and a good crystal ball), I OF COURSE would have called.  Which I tried to explain but gave up given the major attitude thrown back at me.  But whatever.  Karma's a bitch, ladies.  And so were you.  

Luckily, it got better from there.  We had a pretty food savvy crowd, but no one wanted anything too high end that night, so that's how we ended up at Fiamma.  In that, the concept and food worked well for our group.  We started with an appetizer bonanza.  The Polipo was a hit - tender grilled octopus in a savory olive, caper, tomato-based sauce - as were the beef carpaccio, mozzarella salad, caesar salad, calamari (the addition of the fried pepperoncini and the flash fried basil was a good one) and the evening's special, a tuna tartare.  Pretty good stuff.

We all went with pasta dishes, despite my pleading that we share a few of the pastas and have dinners.  Oh well...around the table we ordered the rigatoni, linguini (2), the spaghetti, and the gnocchi.  I was able to sample a little of each - but did so at my own risk given the speed at which the plates were devoured.  The rigatoni I thought was kind of so-so, and I didn't really like the spaghetti - san marzano tomatoes don't really need extra sugar, and it definitely seemed sweeter to me than it had to be.  Perhaps it was an attempt to provide a balance to the Kobe meatballs, but all in all, just wasn't to my taste.  The person who ordered it really liked it, though, so that might just be me.  I had the lobster truffle gnocchi, which was a little saltier than it had to be, but so decadent that I almost didn't mind; the gnocchi were perfect little pillows.  I like a little salt, too.  The linguini was delicious - delicate and hearty at the same time - if you can imagine that.  

We finished sharing the sorbet trio (blood orange is the best of those), and enjoyed some fresh pressed coffee, which sparked us up out of our wine and food induced comas.  

The space is lovely, very warm and modern, and our server was truly a dear - almost thoroughly making up for our rather abrupt beginning to the night.  She kept our wine filled and paced the meal appropriately, and was friendly without being overly solicitous.  Portions are on the moderate size - what we ordered was perfect for us, but if we hadn't had the appetizers, I probably would have needed a little more - the pastas are intermezzi size, so that if you wanted to do a full Italian meal, you could.  So, just keep that in mind.  

For the price, you could do worse, definitely.  

The restaurant was not full the night we ate there, although I found myself noticing that the tables were fairly close together.  Wasn't a problem for us, but I think that if your luck ran a little differently, and you did have a louder table near you, it might be enough to pitch this meal south REALLY fast.",NZyZ31ozaKXkicPUychQpA,1,1,4,c1Fbwf-LduO7svD5Su33nw

The bass from the background music can be annoying.  The complimentary bread is slightly salty. This is not a good thing when paired with the two sauces which are very salty.  The goat cheese sauce was salty and goat cheesy. The tomatoey compound butter tastes salty and weird.   I'm thinking it is the metallic taste of sun dried tomatoes that isn't properly balanced out.   I would have been happier with a good olive oil and balsamic.   The linguine with clam sauce was swimming in liquid.  I'm thinking clam broth and lemon. The problem with pasta served in liquid is that it will continue to absorb the liquid and even if it was once al dente it becomes soft and mushy.  The clams were tiny and supplemented with chopped clams.  This screams CAN regardless if it isn't true.   The short rib raviolini was good.  It was filled with shredded short rib and served with a rich cream sauce.  It didn't look like much on the plate but was filling.  The pasta could have been firmer.

We ordered the Lobster Bisque, the steak bruschetta, and the chopped salad. The bisque was delicious! However, my husband's was tomato, wrong soup, and both bowls literally had soup all over the outside and on the plates, and was sloppily wiped off. It looked like someone had started eating our soup before it was brought out. With their hands.

The salad was split in two for us which was very thoughtful. But the salad maker forgot to put dressing.

We were waiting for a while and the waitress came and told us that they were remaking the steak bruschetta, because they had burned the first one.
Then it came out, and we noticed it had no gorgonzola, so we asked for it. The waitress offered to have them apply it, so it went back to the kitchen.
She came out a moment later and said the cooks told it was on there, we just didn't see it. Or taste it. So we asked for more. When it came back out, it was delicious. The meat was flavorful and tender. The waitress told us the manager was comping that dish.:)

The food is so delicious, and the service was amazing too. 
I appreciated that our server was able to tell me what was gluten free. I ended up getting the spaghetti with meatballs, and my server did tell me that there were breadcrumbs in the meatballs.

The pasta tasting trio was pretty good.  It's essentially a sampling of their signature pasta dishes.

TRADITIONAL POTATO GNOCCHI - Maine Lobster, Cremini Mushroom, Black Truffle Crema

AGNOLOTTI -Beef, Veal, and Pork Ravioli, Wild Mushroom, Veal Demi

ORECCHIETTE - Spiced Sausage, Broccoli Rabe, Hot Pepper Flakes, Sun Dried Tomatoes

I'm not sure if I would order the trio again though since my favorite of the three, the lobster gnocchi was the best tasting of the three and the only one I really enjoyed.

Service was kind of iffy though since my server would vanish on me at certain times when I needed him.  It did give me some time to just sit back and people watch from my table.  But in Vegas, time is definitely short and I was really ready to leave once I had finished my pasta.

I apologize.  For years I ignored you and assumed you were the typical tourist restaurant, overpriced and not really that good.  And besides, I typically don't enjoy Italian food all that much.  But when I went to you for my hunger needs on Monday night, I discovered why so many people are talking about you.

You were doing a $30.09 set menu for Restaurant Week... I remember it like it was yesterday, even though it was two days ago.  The crispy black tiger prawns in red pepper tocco sauce were perfect.  The carne e mare skewers had the most tender slices of beef and perfect bits of lobster.  The raviolini and agnolotti were a fantastic main course, even though I'm not a pasta guy.  The fusilli was the only thing I didn't care for, but the rest of my party liked it.

Now I know you're probably a little mad at me that I didn't finish my dessert.  How am I supposed to do that when you stuffed me earlier?  I got a bite of the tartufo, the panna cotta, and the tiramisu.  Again, not my thing, but my party liked it.

I never sleep anywhere outside of a Wynn Hotel (past / currently owned), and after attending openings at almost every single restaurant since the construction of Hard Rock ... Fiamma is my true love that has gone unmatched.  
Executive Chef Carlos Buscaglia has created a true gem within the MGM family.  The fact that Fiamma has let Chef Buscaglia slide through their fingers in recent weeks due to his call to indulge in ""bigger and better things"" is a grave mistake.  It's insane to me how the owners could allow this genius (inhuman to Culinary)  escape.  Food aside.  Fiamma is Gorgeous.

We were seated where we could watch the people walking by to/from destinations in the MGM restaurant row area. We then began a marvelous culinary evening of Chef Pinisetti's dishes.  We tried the following items:

Caprese with fresh bufala mozzarella
Grilled Mediterranean octopus
Beef carpaccio
Prosciutto with fig marmalade and bleu cheese mousse with flatbread and arugula
Raviolini--short rib filled small ravioli with vegetable confetti and black truffle cream
Morel and summer truffle carbonara with poached egg 
Maine lobster gnocchi with wild mushrooms and black truffle sauce
Branzino with rainbow chard
Kurobuta pork shank with polenta and vegetable confetti
Cioppino with calamari, Manila clams, scallops, prawns, mussels and half lobster with housemade spaghetti
Braised short rib with orange gremolata, Yukon gold potato purée, Cipollini onions, and baby carrots
Limoncello espuma
Vanilla buttermilk panna cotta with spring berry compote
Espresso ""crème brûlée""--salted caramel and vanilla whipped cream, hazelnut streusel and caramel brittle
Amarena cherry Black Forest cake
Bombolini with Nutella sauce and cranberry jam

We started with a nice bread basked of epi and focaccia served with a tomato basil butter and unslated butter rounds. Good epi and the tomato basil was rich in flavor and worthy of taking bread and wiping every last bit of it out of its holder.

The standouts for the appetizer course were the prosciutto with fig marmalade and bleu cheese mousse, and the beef carpaccio. The caprese and octopus were also top notch.

Moving on to the pastas, all three were excellent. The beef short rib raviolini was melt in your mouth good and the short rib gave the raviolini a wonderful flavor. The lobster gnocchi were as soft as can possibly be made and the morel and summer truffle carbonara were exceptional dishes.

Moving on to the meat course, the pork shank and the braised short rib were the stars. Meat coming right off the shank, tender and flavorful and the short rib was so full of flavors. Even as leftovers two days later, the dishes shone!

Finally, the limoncello espuma was my pick of a favorite. The other four were all good. What a great way to end a stunning meal.

4017641,2011-09-12,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"A truly spectacular meal.  Went in for a nice family dinner....left buzzed, full, and speaking Italian.  Ok, just kidding about the second language.

We started with a a sampling of signature cocktails.  A rye whiskey mix, a muddled blueberry ginger thingy, and a strawberry vodka balsamic martini.  I didn't taste the balsamic in the martini, but it was tasty nonetheless.  

Bread basket is lovely with crunchy sticks, a cheesy cracker, and traditional french bread.  Excellent, flavorful olive oil for dipping.

Carpaccio and calamari to start.  Carpaccio had a pungent mustard drizzled on top and was speckled with caviar - melted like butter in your mouth.  The calamari has extra crispy zucchini bits and surprisingly zingy pepperocinis mixed in with the lightly coated perfectly cooked and seasoned squid.  It was served with two dipping sauces.  A great execution of a crowd pleasing classic.  

For entrees, we had raviolini, gnocchi, sea bass, and braised short ribs.  The best gnocchi you will ever have!  The delicate pillows were enveloped in truffly lobstery goodness.  The raviolini was stuffed with the same braised beef short ribs; however, it was a good thing we also had the short rib entree.  The sauce on the raviolini overpowered the beef; it was delicious nonetheless.  The shor ribs exceeded your wildness braised beef dreams.  So meaty.  The sea bass was cooked nicely and served with potatoes and mushrooms but was forgettable.  

We finished off with warm doughnuts, lattes, and moscato.  The service was sweet, unobtrusive and attentive.  

Be sure to treat yourself to some Fiamma but be prepared for it to be a treat.  Bill was close to $300 for 4 of us.  Not overpriced for the quality of food and service but more than your average family dinner.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,0,0,5,JFQwmiZ4QKHFm_DtUGsK3A

Recently, I visited Fiamma for my fourth time and even though I had a fever of 103 and was hacking my brains out, it still was a five star experience for me. The service is excellent, I never wanted for anything for more than a few seconds before it was promptly brought to the table. The bartender even poured us a complimentary round of a nice-er champagne because it was my boyfriend's birthday. This last time I visited we had a party of 8 (most of who were 45 minutes late) and when everyone got there, we were immediately seated without trouble even though we were past our reservations by almost an hour on a Saturday night. 

Now on to the food... I had the lobster gnocchi which is as decadent and indulgent as it gets (it's pretty heavy).  The gnocchi are the prefect texture and together with the lobster just melt in your mouth. Other dishes at the table were the Fillet... super tender and juicy and served with an awesome potato side, the small rib-eye and lobster which I was told was divine, and my favorite (I might or might not have had several bites) was the Nodino... a veal shank in a Cabernet mushroom sauce. The veal was succulent and flavorful and the mushrooms were to die for. 

The ambiance is really cool too. Nice bar/waiting area with a big roaring glass fireplace and leather couches and cubes. There is a nice amber-colored glow for lighting and deep espresso wood to break up the restaurant. Very different and very calming. 

All in all, this is definitely one of my favorite Vegas haunts and I highly recommend testing it out next time you want to venture to the MGM.",c7ja4uIl009XMrPIHXPtHw,2,2,5,zN89mt83sDYl3XjJ3M8XRQ

I looked at all the restaurants in the area and I thought lets keep it local since I was getting married at the MGM.  Well did I choose wrong.  I reserved the private peanut shell of a room for 50 guest. When we got there the Tables weren't ready! They had no water and it was not set. Absolutely nothing.  We logged the room for 2 hours.. So that we could enjoy the evening..  The water took almost an hour to get.. Then the Salads took about 45 mins to get after that. Then the pasta Dish came out ( which was the only thing that came out tasting great and came in a reasonable time. Then The Main Course.... HORRIBLE.  Last time I checked when you serve a wedding party the Bride and Groom get served first.... But 4 hours into dinner services and we were the last ones to get served.  My Meat was so Raw that it was still beating.  So I sent it back. They asked if I wanted i anything else and I looked that the manager and was like, ""are you kidding me its MIDNIGHT! and you have ruined the whole evening.. Dinner should have been served at 9pm! just bring out the damn cake so we can get the hell out of here. So they bring out my cake with adorning cup cakes.. I asked for a marble cake with buttercream.. Cake Was Dry  and the buttercream was horrible! nothing had flavor.. The best that they could do to accommodate us was give us Lemon-Cello's and mine and my new husbands dinner for free... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!  another thing I just remembered.. we asked for a veggie dish to be served to some of my guest and the veggies were raw and not cooked all the way through. and I had a friend who asked for no peanuts in the salad and what do they serve Peanuts in it.. Are you trying to kill my friends... Seriously. horrible experience. 

Understand I have worked in the Restaurant Business and there is a way to handle a wedding party and how they did it was unacceptable. Thumbs down ALL THE WAY!!!  never Again!",P34ny-O0Lx_7tg_UqAUJ1A,0,0,1,0DS0z3keGmTxozgE1yk61Q
4046577,2011-01-09,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"I ate at Fiamma on Christmas Day with my parents and husband and we all very much enjoyed our meal. The ambiance of Fiamma is lovely, it's warm and inviting, modern but not overdone. Our service was very good, as well. They also had my all-time favorite wine, Leitz Dragonstone Reisling, so I really can not complain.

But on to the important stuff. The food: I went with the Fall Tasting Menu which was 3 courses for $45. For my first course, I got a Caprese Salad with buffalo mozzarella. It was light, fresh, perfectly salted and very good. My main course was chicken that was very juicy and perfectly cooked with perfectly roasted potatoes. Dessert was a trio of individual mini desserts. They were very, very good and included a creamy panna cotta, a tartufo and tiramisu. A very satisfying ending to a delicious meal.

I, of course, tried everyone elses dishes and can say that the Short Rib Ravioli are to-die-for. My dad had a special that night which was the Strip Steak. It was perfectly cooked and so flavorful, accompanied with potato croquettes and caramelized pearl onions. He probably had the winner dish out of all of us, it was so so good. Overall it was a great dining experience and I would definitely return, for the reasonable price it was on equal par to many of Vegas' fine dining restaurants.",NnSczz_889Ejm3hXrquy-Q,0,0,4,QzdAhAxUN2fD9eAFDti7aQ
4048994,2010-03-09,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"Fiamma has a create your own 4-course menu which I felt was a really good deal.  $60 bucks (add $35 for wine pairings).

Went w/ the boyfriend for his birthday and we both did the 4 course menu

1st course - Kobe beef risotto balls w/ marinara sauce and cheese.  We also got the buffata mozzarella that came with these really great sweet red bell peppers and prosciutto.  both were excellent.  The risotto balls were crisp on the outside, inside was perfect as well.  the mozzarella was fresh and melted in my mouth.

2nd course - after reading all the yelp reviews, we both got the lobster gnocchi.  it definitely lives up to the hype and surpasses it.  The sauce is amazing and not overpowering, they gave huge pieces of lobster meat and the gnochhi was perfectly cooked.

3rd course - fillet of beef and the braised short rib.  By this time the boyfriend and I were starting to feel like we were going through food coma.  the short rib was succulent and melded well with the mashed potatoes.  the flirt had a great sauce on top and was cooked perfectly.

4th course - the dessert was the standard one that's given (no choice).  It was a pana cotta with figs and a balsamic honey as well as a chocolate dome thing that had ice cream in it and chocolate and hazelnuts with it.  The pana cotta was a slight disappointment, but the balsamic honey sauce was really great.  The chocolate dessert was great though, however I felt that it didn't compare to the other 3 courses.

Service was excellent.  They were so attentive, and asked up front whether we needed to be somewhere soon.  Since we weren't seeing a show, we definitely took our time and they paced out the dinner perfectly, including the 10 minute ""breather"" my boyfriend and I needed between the main course and dessert.

All in all, if I had the money, I would go to Fiamma every time I'm in Vegas...until then I'll save it for special occasions.",CnLNC8VMErPASEq_uimDaQ,0,0,5,sZauYuI5hhYFjEwM0lnw4A

The calamari wasn't very crispy, but we haven't had much to eat all day so we quickly devoured the calamari and a bunch of free bread.

It was popped down in front of us with no explanation of the cheeses or meats.  We yelled, yes yelled, at the staff at the front of the house after waiting 10+ minutes for the staff to come back to the table, and the three of them that were there just chatted away without a care in the world to the patrons.  Finally we got the wait staff and they ended up wrongly explaining the plate, and arguing with us about what was beef and what was considered pork.  Bad!  My brother got the calamari app which was to come with fried peppercini's - but there wasn't a single one (this after the waitress told us how amazing they were).  We got the peppercini''s after showing the server there were none in the actual appetizer (and they continued to argue they were in there, but they weren't lol) , but they were not breaded/fried/or tasty.  They were soggy disgusting glop.  Server was horribly rude in pointing out everything we were eating... *those are calamari* on the calamari appeitzer.  Honey - this wasn't the first place we've eaten at.  What a bitch.  Salads were wilted and not deserving of the price at all.  Worst of all is that we felt horribly rushed.  Entree's were served with appetizers barely eaten.  We have eaten at some wonderful places where the price is expensive but worth it due to staff attention - Fiamma's  is NOT one of those places.  I gave it two stars solely because after I asked for a manager, he seemed to actually care.  We got some dessert out of it, but at the end of the day, if you want good food, and feel appreciated as a customer, skip Fiamma's.  Go to Spago's at Caesar's Palace to see what a wonderful dinner is truly about.

ETA - my brother ended up with food poisoning later that night, most likely from the calamari.    Seriously, skip this joint.  With all the wonderful and safe food offerings in Vegas, this one is not.  I put it back to one star considering my brother was sick later.  Ugh.",kfOYN1wtl3nPqvzMfiSeqA,0,0,1,FrD4AL0Z2_hDodb4P7GFDw

We arrived a bit early (about 5:20 - they open at 5:30) and was asked if we had a reservation. A bit odd to me, since we were there right when (or before) it opened so why would we need a reservation? Anyways, 15 minutes later, we were seated in the ""outside"" of the restaurant. Basically, we were still part of the hotel except that a wall-like structure with holes were separating the people walking in the hotel from us. I was slightly disappointed, as I really wanted to get away from ""being in a hotel."" Why couldn't we sit inside? Was it because we looked way too young? Or because we didn't have a reservation?

Appetizers: Mushroom puree soup (special) for me, calamari for him.
Entrees: Fruitti de mare linguine for me, Spaghetti with Kobe Beef meatballs for him
Dessert: A trio of gelato for me, a trio of sorbet for him.

Soup didn't look that great, but it was very delicious! Those were some fancy mushrooms. Calamari was about expected.

The cioppino sauce was soooo good - the best sauce (wished I had asked for it without the mussels though; the mussels made the taste not as good). I would have loved to dip more bread in the sauce if I hadn't filled myself on bread already waiting for the entrees. I didn't really care for the homemade spaghetti (a little hard) that came with it. My kids' ribeye steak and fried potatoes were excellent as well. So overall an excellent choice food wise.

So here's how it went...
Was greeted and seated, and everything looked and seemed so right. Everyone was friendly, and I just knew that it was going to be great. 
My wife got a pear martini, and I got a cucumber martini, and both were good. 
They brought out bread while we waited for our starter of calamari. The bread was refrigerator cold. Ok, no problem still feeling good. 
The calamari came out, and I was happy to see it. I took a bite, and so did my wife. The flavor of the breading was good, but the calamari was rubbery. Not a little rubbery it was like a thinly perfectly sliced Goodyear tire rubbery. 
My wife and I just kind of picked at it. Neither of us really commented on it for a while until I said ""it's a little rubbery huh""? She gave me that oh yea look. 
Onto our much anticipated dinner. My wife ordered the seasonal risotto, which was saffron risotto w crab meat (sounds really good). I ordered the braised short rib. Why did my wife's risotto not only look like a mix of oatmeal and Kraft Mac and cheese, but also taste like it? I mean it looked like an old, dry, clump of oatmeal that somehow took on a yellow color. Ok, I thought when I saw it and the look on her face, maybe it somehow tastes good. Nope. It really didn't. It tasted like what I described, along w the taste of 4 hour thawed warm crab essence. Disgusting. 
Onto their ""big deal"" braised short rib. The plate looked like I put it together trying to fancy at home. Pretty lackluster. Bit into the short rib and yea the meat texture was fine, but the flavor was like a Hormel canned pot roast. I'm kind of wondering if the people that cooked this really think that their food is good, almost like they are from an alternate universe where bad food tastes good and...well, just look at the pictures. I was trying to be in good spirits and took them thinking that maybe they would taste better than they looked. 
I'm not even trying to just pile on at this point. 
The server was nice, the restaurant looked nice, and the drinks were alright. 
The best thing that I had though, and this is no exaggeration, was the water.

After showing up at 7:29 for our 7:30 reservation, we were asked to wait on the side of the restaurant until our table was ready.  We were not seated until 7:55 for a party of 3.  After sitting, it took 15 minutes for the first attendee and all the while we were sitting without menus.  The waitresses explained that they share tables and so sometimes they would be unsure if we had already been attended too.  Horrible system.  Drinks took about 20 min after ordering to receive them.

We brought a good central coast Viognier in and the corkage was $35.00.  Wish we had brought the other bottle of wine with us and just forked out the 2nd corkage fee because we ordered a $60.00 bottle of an Italian Red...2002 Sangiovese I think and it was horrid.  With such great food, having some good wine can make all the difference and if it means bringing in something reliable, then do it....most of the decent wine is probably at least about $100/bottle although there are  bottles which are cheaper...and I guess you get what you pay for.

Anyways, more importantly, the food.  Really addicting bread with olive oil, different rustic great taste.  Ordered two appetizers for our party to share....not sure what the ladies had but the guys shared the grilled octopus which was fabulous, touch of sweetness and cooked to perfection.  Couldn't help but sop up some of the juices with the bread.

For dinner I had the lobster gnocchi which was phenomenal.  I took my time to savor every bite.  Everyone else was extremely pleased with their meals as well. 

Didn't have room for dessert but they brought out these little pumpkin cheesecake bites or something...can't remember exactly what they were but they had that sweet pumpkin spice flavor.  

We thought the dress was business casual, but you can wear nice jeans with a nice dress shirt...and we were told that dress shorts would have been okay too.  

Definitely will return when I'm in Vegas and will bring a couple of good bottles of wine....maybe three bottles.  ;-)",VPGb0N6C0pmROu2E1PDVSQ,0,0,5,rU36Y0kfPk4dbdXa6klOvg

I assumed I was going to get the more expensive item ($44 vs. $29) - and not to my surprise I did. 

The short ribs themselves were fall-off-the-bone good! The side dish was savory; and the half of glass of wine I had was also amazing. However, two hours after eating (right before KA) and 30 minutes into the show I got violently ill. It was 110 degrees out that day, I hadn't drank before dinner, and I had consumed appropriate amounts of water so I don't believe it was anything I did. But when I say I got sick, I mean really sick. None of the short rib digested and I was forced to leave the show. Not only did I lose the money I paid for KA because I had to go back to the hotel to be sick in private, but my boyfriend ended up feeling obligated to spend the night in with me instead of going out. 

Beware the short rib - I'm hoping it was just MY dish (it literally couldn't have been anything else) and that no one else got sick.",85uTz591AZkE2CzBNkjk1Q,0,0,2,6PUBnpWE3E11XegDWDKdTQ

I had to quickly finish off the last couple of peices of octopus (like I was gonna waste that!) so the server could clear my plate. 

I really don't like to be rushed when I am at a nice restaurant like this. I am paying a premium price and I like to take my time, enjoy the company and the surroundings. There were plenty of open tables so I didn't get the sense that they needed to open up space.

I was in Vegas with a friend that likes gourmet food at great prices. We both arrived famished and looking for something good, yet inexpensive. I turn to yelp and I said, ""hey, I think Fiamma at the MGM sounds like the best deal."" My friend seemed to brush my idea off, then I read him the menu being advertised on yelp about all of the appetizers under $10. 

There was a mother/daughter celebrating their birthday, and a friend of theirs who had the same idea. They both stumbled on the great food for less. They had their orders ahead of us and were able to tell us what to order. 

We ended up with the mussels, bruchettona, and truffled gnocchi. The muscles were very high quality muscles and cooked in a tomato sauce for $7. The crusted bread that went with it was great, but there was not enough. The bruchettona was $5 and came with 3 slices of bruschetta that was relatively tasty. The gnocchi for $7 was very filling. The cheese that covered the gnocchi potatoes was tasty and truffled anything seems to be delicious. 

The waitress was inattentive and was never there when we needed her, but the manager who was standing in the area must have seen that and made sure to clear our plates, ask us if we needed any other appetizers, and keep our drinks refilled.

Our meal started out a little underwhelming.  Average bread with just olive oil.  No balsalmic or salt, pretty boring.  

My wife got a drink that was pretty darn good. I love me a nice sweet drink that I could suck down 20 of and do things I'll regret the next day. 

I started with the Lobster Bisque.  I really enjoyed it.  It wasn't as creamy as I expected it to be, but it was very good.  Lots of lobster flavor in all different ways.  

I got the shrimp and scallop risotto.  This dish was perfection.  Shrimp cooked perfectly as well as the scallops.  Paying $30 for two shrimp and two scallops is kind of a kick in the teeth, but at least they were really good.  The risotto was perfect, not too heavy, not too salty, not too firm or soggy.  Just perfect.  My wife stole the rest of mine before I finished. 

My wife got the gnocchi with lobster, mushrooms and truffles.  Gnocchi is tough because if you don't accompany it with some bold flavors and textures you feel like you're eating dough.  This dish used all the qualities of the lobster and mushrooms for an amazing combination.  I stole the rest of my wife's.  No sand or shells either, however some pieces of lobster were a little over cooked.  

Overall a very good meal.  Price point was a little high, but competing in vegas is tough.",QN12UEqpcoJky1qHMQLq_Q,1,1,4,a7VL-1QXzEQM0dMhyTbXEA
4412921,2008-09-21,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"The hubby and I had dinner here 2 nights in a row.  It's THAT good!  Here are the reasons why:

1.  Ambiance - the decor dark wood furniture, along with black and dark orange color scheme is very relaxing and calming.  Perfect for a nice romantic dinner.

2. Great staff - from the hostesses to our waitress, the service was awesome.  We had no reservations, but were seated immediately.  The waitress knew it was our first time dining there and after explaining thoroughly what the specials were, she made wonderful suggestions.  She also came back on numerous occasions to check up on us which was much appreciated.

3.  The FOOD - Excellent.  I thought we had it good in SF, having some great Italian restaurants, but Fiamma totally blew us away.  We ordered the Spaghetti that featured freshly made pasta, a wonderful marinara sauce that was not over powering at all and last but not least, Kobe beef meatballs.  How can you make spaghetti out of this world?  Apparently, by using Kobe beef meatballs!!   We also ordered one of the specials of the night, Veal Ravioli.  This was very good also, with a rich, creamy sauce.  For dessert, I wanted to try the Tiramisu, just to compare to the ones we love in North Beach, SF, but the waitress suggested that we try the Crochettes instead.  As soon as she mentioned that it's made to order and comes hot, we were sold.  They are these donut hole like pieces of heaven that are sprinkled with powdered sugar and comes with 3 different dipping sauces.  One word - AMAZING!

On the second night, right before we had to go back home, we came back for dinner.  We only had one hour before having to catch the cab to the airport.  After letting the hostess know we had a time constraint, she suggested that we sit at the bar/lounge to receive faster service.  And fast they were!   We were in and out of there in 30 minutes!  I ordered the Gnochhi with lobster, which was nothing less than perfect.  I'm not a gnochii fan, but this might have converted me for life.  The hubby ordered the Ravioli stuffed with short rib and that very close to my veal ravioli.

This will be our favorite restaurant on the strip from now on!",0ENyKZB_Z1O4dDzHiv-uqQ,1,0,5,EWJI1u0S2QX76Jti88MBcQ

After seating us we were given bowls of foccacia and ciabatta bread served with a very nice olive oil.

Restaurant Week = started + main dish + dessert for $30.01! All of the portions were very generous and very delicious! I started off with the Misto Di Campo, the mixed green salad tossed with cucumber, tomato, and cianti balsamic dressing. Very Refreshing! Next on to the roasted free-range chicken served with swiss chard and fingerling potato. The skin on this roasted chicken was amazing (think crisp sucking pig skin) and the chicken itself was tender and juicy (breast, wing, thigh). The swiss chard was amazing, too.

For dessert I could not resist the Panna Cotta, made with mascarpone and surrounded by sweet figs and honey. This panna cotta is wonderful and is a great choice (especially during the summer).

Try the bellini, light and refreshing and not cloyingly sweet.

I'll leave it to my husband and friends to yelp their meals, which I have to admit, looked amazing! I did take a sample of my hubby's mozzarella caprese, it was AWESOME and the cheese was to die for

Great wine list, wonderful atmosphere, and good service. I definitely will return (as soon as I'm forgiven for the Louis V incident).",s1MgWqFhSw3vfS-POOF6AA,1,1,4,qtmVKl92P-LEnNmFPhrTXA

I've only been here three times but each time has been more impressive.

The service here consistently exceeds my expectations. I want to know what their training secret is! Their servers are so knowledgable about the menu, professional, polite, and very attentive. 10/5 for the service.

The cuisine here is Italian and very good. I would say the average check per person may be anywhere from $20-$60 depending on how much is ordered. To be honest, Italian food is a little rich for my liking in large portions, however, I can definitely recognize and appreciate excellent quality Italian food. 

I've had their short rib ravioli and their shrimp and scallop risotto. Both are phenomenal popular choices that won't disappoint! Their Grappa goes great with the food here too. Yummy! 

If you're celebrating an anniversary or a special occasion, they'll genuinely congratulate you and bring out a nice little treat. I went once for a special occasion and they brought us mini creme brûlées!

Fiamma is what Las Vegas dining should be. Elegant, Hip, Fun, and just good food overall.  The ambiance here is straight out of a James Bond movie. The lighting and astmoshpere are done just right. The service quality here is top notch. 

Made reservations and was seated right away. All of the foods had excellent plating and service quality. Most of the food portions was enough for two. The one thing I would recommend is getting the Tartoffal for all you chocolate lovers. This is a great spot to come to especially before going to see KA.  Prices are on the high side averaging about $70/per person.  But I've been to places that are far more expense and would say that's about on par for Vegas.

I started with the cucumber martini, which was actually my least favorite part of the meal. It's strangely floral, and you're probably better off sticking with the wines. 

We split the calamari and a custom penne pink sauce with shrimp. Both were fantastic! Portions are good-sized & excellent quality. Pasta is cooked a perfect al dente, and the sauce is flavorful without being heavy.

I really liked our server ((I don't remember her name, but she's a petite blonde woman.)) She was attentive & knew her stuff, but relaxed at the same time. The vibe at restaurants like Fiamma is sometimes too uptight, but our server kept it very comfortable.

We were greeted multiple times at every corner of the restaurant.  They were also really great about getting food out to us quickly since we had tickets to zoomanity in less than an hour.

My husband and I split a 3-course meal (and they very nicely split our pasta into 2 dishes for us).  Nobody at the table was a particularly big fan of the bread and sweet butter...not really what we were looking for.  But, it's ok - we had ordered enough food.  We started with the beef carpaccio, which we really enjoyed - although we didn't really taste the truffle. We ordered the ravioli filled with short-rib.  Yum yum.  Very yummy.  We ended the meal with the NY strip which was also delicious, but was definitely unevenly cooked.  We had some overcooked and some undercooked meat for our medium steak.  Still flavorful.  Did not appreciate the brussels sprouts on the plate though - they were not good eats.

Ended the meal with little hazelnut cakes from the chef.  A great small bite after a great meal.

Needless to say, if their free items were that good, I couldn't wait to try the main course. Lobster gnocchi was my choice, and at $31, it was a tough one indeed. The portions weren't that big (not what I'm used to anyway with all the other restaurants we've eaten at). Once the plate arrived, I asked myself if this is how true Italians eat--without stuffing their faces and eating themselves into comas like we Americans do. But then I asked myself why they were still so fat, so I concluded that it must be the butter. Either way, my friend got more lobster than I did, but it was still delicious. The gnocchi melts in your mouth like it should, so that was a plus.

For dessert, we had three flavors of sorbet, the doughnuts, and the tiramisu. Sorbets were a bit icy, but the doughnuts were great deep fried balls of delicious, especially when dipped in the caramel or hazelnut sauce provided.

I'm a wee bit particular about where I sit in a restaurant that I know with cost $100 for dinner for two. The staff here were more than accommodating when I wanted to sit at a table other than the one the hostess had originally seated us at. Big plus to be so chill.

We ordered the braised short rib with Parmesan risotto (I died after eating it), red onion croutons, and a wine reduction sauce. I even licked the sauce off of the dish. It. Was. So. Good.

We also got the gnocchi with lobster, mushrooms, and black truffles. I don't really care too much about truffles, but this dish was absolutely decadent. We washed it down with a great malbec off of the extensive wine list.

I actually really liked my lobster gnocchi.  The dish had plenty of delicious lobster and the gnocchi, while not the best I've ever had, was passable.  The servers were also amiable and courteous.  The reason I didn't give this restaurant 4 or 5 stars is that I ordered a simple plate of pasta with butter for my 8 year old daughter.  Yes, it was acceptable, but let's face it.  How do you mess up pasta with butter?  All was going fine until I received the bill.  For a simple plate of pasta with butter, the cost was $24!  I've worked in food service for many years as a dietitian, and also being a mom who does all the grocery shopping for my family, I know that the food cost for this dish was less than $1.  Yes, labor is much more expensive, so let's say, given rent, labor, marketing and whatever other overhead there may be, the dish cost them $10.  So charge me $15 and get a 50% profit (and yes, I've paid $15 for a simple plate of pasta and butter at fancy restaurants).  But $24?  Ridiculous.  When I complained, the server said that it was the minimum charge for a plate of pasta. For reference, my plate of gnocchi with a LOT of lobster cost $32, which was reasonable.

4598077,2010-03-09,1,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"Fiamma is an expensive place.  A part of me wants to give them 4 stars simply because they are really priced so high, but for Vegas the prices aren't too far away from the other nice restaurants' pricing, and if you can get their ""Taste"" menu, it's actually a pretty good deal, especially considering the quality you get.  Thus we stick with 5 stars. :]

Fiamma has everything they do down perfectly. My husband had the ""Winter Tasting Menu"" which gave him the Insalata (mixed baby lettuce, green apples, toasted pistachios, white balsamic), Brasato (""Piemontese"" braised beef short rib, caramelized root vegetables, potato puree), and Tartufo for dessert (dolce di latte gelato, caramelized hazelnuts, warm valrhona chocolate sauce) all for $45.  That was actually a heck of a deal, and ALL of the food was incredible.  The salad was fresh and light with enough dressing to add taste without creating soggy lettuce.  The braised short ribs fell right off the bone, were a perfect pink on the inside, and had the perfect amount of juiciness and incredible flavor.  The dessert was lovely in its presentation and flavor -- a solidly impressive and tasty three courses!

I had the Raviolini (short rib ravioli, barbera wine, melted butter, black truffle) which was a relatively small portion, but was loaded with flavor.  The sauce was rich and light (if you can even imagine that!) and complemented the ravioli itself well.  I want to venture a guess that the pasta itself was homemade.  I have an Italian aunt who only cooks with pasta she makes herself and that's what this was like.  YUM.

Our friends at the table also enjoyed the Taste menu as well as the Linguini (sautéed shrimp, scallops, crispy shallots, cortese wine), which was reportedly quite good.

The wine prices are pretty high, even by the glass.  If you like whites, they have some affordable options, but the reds start significantly higher and were frankly more than I am willing to pay for a low-end (entry level) bottle/glass.

Ambiance is nice -- dimly lit, mainly candle light, comfortable booths, etc.  It sucks to be able to smell the cigarette smoke from people outside the restaurant, but that's Vegas for you.

Service was excellent... as it should be since you're really paying enough to deserve it!

I would normally have said something to them about the service, but I had to leave right after eating and didn't get a chance to wait around for a manager.

Food - 5 star
Service - 1 star

I ordered the Tagliata (fillet, of course!), which came with a sauteed spinach and a red wine reduction. Not as good as the Craftsteak restaurant across the hall, but still very good.  Why did I order a steak here anyway, knowing that Craftsteak was across the way? Oh well.

Now of the service. The waiter brought out my menu and came back about 10 minutes later to get my food order. I placed my order and he walked away without even taking my drink order. Uh, hello, I wanted some wine.

I flagged down the hostess and asked for the wine list, which she promptly brought back to me (Thank you!). I didn't see my waiter until he brought out my food and then I had to place my drink order. I ordered a half bottle of wine. He brought it out and set it on my table and then said he would be right back and walked away. He went to another table to take their order and talk with them, then disappeared. Uh, my wine wasn't opened yet. He then came back to open my wine and pulled the same stunt again. Except this time he disappeared for about five minutes where I couldn't see him. I finally got my wine opened and forgot all about the bad service. The food was terrific.

I got called to a private party just as I was finishing my food, so I couldn't speak with a manager about this. Otherwise, I would have. That is, if I could have found one. I only saw the hostess and waiter the entire time I was there. (I was sitting in the ""patio"" area where you could see all the people walking by.) Not sure what the ""inside"" of the restaurant looked like. I put those words in quotes, because if this place was outside that is what they would have been called.

As I walked out, the hostess asked me how everything was. I told her the food was incredible, but my waiter wouldn't even do a good job as a greeter at Wal-Mart.

- Carpaccio (Thinly Sliced Prime Filet of Beef, Arugula, Parmigiano, Black Truffle): oh how i love meat. this one was simply delicious. black truffle was a nice touch

Entrees
- Raviolini (Short Rib Ravioli, Barbera Wine, Imported Pecorino Romano): flavor of this was delicious, but the short rib filling distracted from the ravioli and sauce. short rib was too...stringy for such a pasta dish
- Linguini (Sautéed Prawns, Smoked Bacon, Tomato, Basil, Roasted Garlic Butter): the texture of the linguini was insane. i couldn't get over how thin the multi-colored linguini was, and how it blended perfectly with the other flavors. yum.
- Spaghetti (Fresh Cut ""Chitarra"" Spaghetti, Kobe Meatballs, San Marzano Pomodoro): good, but tasted like your typical spaghetti. nothing fancy, couldn't tell that the meatballs were made with ground kobe beef.

Dessert
- Chocolate tiramisu: nice portion of chocolate tiramisu in a chocolate encasing, with chocolate cream on top and a spoon of delicious fudge on the side
- panna cotta with honey and figs: figs seemed a little distracting, but the texture of the panna cotta was perfect, with subtle hints of honey drizzled around. quite delicate and of course, delicious
- sorbet: like any other sorbet, three flavors, huge scoops

We also got a bottle of red wine. Three girls, too much food, we sadly did not finish everything. I was very satisfied with my dining experience here, and it didn't hurt that our waiter resembled Scott Speedman. That's beside the point though. :)",KURUGmYN2kwDpr6BcEcrRA,0,0,4,RSWhYc6vUsRdl5I8F5NAgA

We wanted on a light dinner so we decided on two appetizers, a pasta, and dessert. The Caesar salad was decent (but nothing close to the all time best Mastro's!), but the carpaccio was not good. The flavor was okay but I was so confused by the crunchy potato thing on top. It totally overwhelmed the dish, ruining the texture and flavors! I ended up just scraping it off to the side. The lobster gnocchi had a nice lobster flavor (with good lobster portions!) but the gnocchi was mushy. It was not pillowy and soft like we had hoped. With those three dishes, we decided to forego dessert and call it a night.

Meals - fettuccine pesto and ravolitini were delicious. Dessert not so much.... raspberry tartufo and tiramisu looked as if they were pre packaged resort desserts and did not taste good at all. So stick with the meals and skip the desserts. Dinner items vary from about 25-55$ a meal. Appetizers are around $15-$20.,lTmpo1flbVD70t3yBoodYQ,0,0,4,IVAVRs-KZBVxatx5MujdYg

4673934,2018-01-05,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"Our decision to eat here was driven by the resort credit attached to our reservation that had limited application.  That said, we went in with open minds.  Once seated, service seemed slow an oddly paced.  The menu looked promising each of our party of three quickly found options that suited us.  

The positive included the short rib ravioli, tender and flavorful.  However, my enjoyment was marred by the after effects of my carpaccio starter.  The carpaccio had an odd flavor which I could quite place but chalked up to the gremolata and fried Brussels sprouts on top.  This was nothing like any carpaccio I've ever had and the unpleasant flavor increased as I ate.  I tried the ""bread"" that was served on the plate and it was a cold, fried and incredibly greasy bite.  My stomach turned over.  That was the end of my favorite starter.  I couldn't get the odd flavor and greasy taste/feel out of my mouth.   The ravioli tried, but the rich sauce on top of greasy didn't quite get it done.  At least the lemon basil sorbet was cleans and fresh.   My whole party felt oil was overused.  Maybe others like oily food, but not us.  The others felt their meals (lobster angel hair and a steak) where pretty one dimensional in flavor...just oily.

The waiter was obviously in a bad mood and just plain rude and inattentive (my drink/our waters were never refilled the entire time). But that could be overlooked honestly. Its that it took him 32 minutes (we timed it) to get us a check (not a particularly busy night). Then the check was wrong - he had charged my card for over $100 of someone else's meal. Takes him another 20 minutes to get back with the right check only to tell me that now somehow their machine wasn't reading my card. Paid with a different card and finally leave after over 2 hours for a 2 person meal (entrees only) and informs me the charge won't go back onto my card for a few days likely. Are you kidding??? He doesn't even offer a free dessert or a comped app. I speak with the manager and she apologizes but again offers absolutely no resolution other than ""sorry"". I'm never one to expect free things but after I'm out $200 I was pretty upset and wanted the offer to try and make things right. At this point I ask for a dessert, which she does kindly offer on the house. Finally some kind of offer of resolution- but after I have to literally ask?? This whole experience was so disappointing.

My inner monster was beginning to emerge after not being fed in five hours, and we were happy to sit down to a nice meal. Fiamma was no disappointment! Classy and cool, this place offers a nice ambiance alongside some gooood food.

To start with, we ordered the grilled ahi tuna, which consisted of three healthy pieces of ahi drizzled with an olive puree, sitting alongside a light green salad and a slice of vegetable terrine. VERY tasty...I particularly enjoyed the spicy peppered edge of the ahi, and the rest melted in my mouth. I'd never had vegetable terrine before...it was a roll of sliced vegetables, kind of hard to describe but very interesting and very good. For our entrees my husband ordered the orecchiette and I ordered the trio of gnocchi. Everything was chock full of nice, savory flavor. Yay for my gnocchi...what an awesome way to sample three amazing dishes. I had almost ordered the full plate of lobster gnocchi, and was thrilled I hadn't because the pumpkin gnocchi was mouth-wateringly, mind-blowingly good...I mean, poppy seeds, ricotta, walnuts, and PUMPKIN? I literally haven't stopped thinking about that dish. The lobster gnocchi and bolognese gnocchi were also pretty great...and though the plate of three portions initially looked small, it was pretty filling (I guess it is gnocchi, after all). 

Dessert was the crocchete...donuts with dipping sauces! I almost died from the quantity...I normally dominate dessert, but had to convince the hubby to eat more than the one he tried to conclude the meal with in order to prevent myself from entering a donut coma or having a donut heart attack (self control is not my strong suit :/ ). I think there were about ten of the donuts in there...probably best to share with a group. The dipping sauces were fab, though :) :)

Kind of a pricey experience; our total without tip was about $140 for the appetizer, two entrees, dessert, and two glasses of wine...but we left full and very happy. My only regret? Not returning the next day for an order of pumpkin gnocchi...no joke. I may chase that gnocchi back to Vegas sooner than I'd planned...",cfNcpHJ8ALBRTzf2PpeHVw,1,1,4,GdJYU8aUScc3CoAA4dkHuQ

Ambiance:  Dark wood / dim lighting/ modern but had warmth.   People were dressed  both to the nines and also casual formal (like a country club vibe)

Drinks: I tasted The pear martini. And it was delicious! Not too sweet, strong and smooth.

Appetizers:  We ordered the calamari which had plenty of tentacles (love) and some fried zukes too. It was served with a garlicky lemon aioli sauce which was yummy! 
Then a little complimentary appetizer showed up.  Pita bread, olive, artichokes, cheese and Italian meat platter.  What a nice surprise for my daughter!  How nice!

Soup: I ordered a potato leek soup.  Creamy and I can taste both the potato and the leeks.  There were fried mozzarella balls in them. Overall, it was good but a tad heavy for me.

Entrees:  I ordered the lobster gnocchi, the parents ordered the raviolini.  My husband ordered the meat lasagna and my daughter ordered a chicken dish.  There were no children at the restaurant so, they did not have a children's menu.  They said the kitchen usually had an option for pasta.  But, our server, Gabriel asked and they decided to make her a rosemary chicken breast, mashed potatoes and a wine reduction (on the side).  Again** How thoughtful!  She would have accepted the pasta just fine but this made her feel super special.

Anyways, the chicken plate came out first, and then we waited for a while for our entrees to come out.  It was actually a long time.  Gabriel came to apologize for the delay.  I joked to the family that maybe our food got dropped/they had to run to the store to pick u some extra lasagna sheets or they had lost our ticket.  But then the managers came out to apologize as well.  After about 45 minutes of waiting, the managers brought out all of foods.

It was well worth the wait!
I'm unsure of the lasagna or the raviolini (although everyone raved about it)
but my lobster gnocchi was perfect! Soft and pillowy and lightly creamy!
While the adults were eating our entrees, they came out with a cupcake for my daughter and we quietly sang her happy birthday.  (Quietly, because this wasn't applebees or anything!)

When we finished, our tables got cleared and we were waiting for our check. But instead, Gabriel showed up with four glasses of dessert wine and my daughter got a special drink as well with cherries in the same glass as ours.  She felt like such a grown up!
While we were enjoying our little treat, Gabriel showed up again with a tri of desserts!
Crème Brulee (so delicious and creamy! A cheesecake with a marscapone whipped cream and a chocolate mouse cake with another candle to sing to my daughter!!    What did we do to deserve this besides waiting for our entrée??  

My daughter's eyes lit up and she said she felt like a princess.  We all pretty much did.  We don't go out to fancy places very often and this was such a wonderful time and meant a lot to our family.   I knew the food was going to be super, but I wasn't too sure about the service since I had read the negative reviews.  I'm so happy this wasn't the case at all!

That being said, our waiter (I think his name was George) did an awesome job that night.  He was crazy busy but did a really good job taking care of us.  

The drinks here are amazing.  I had the passion fruit Bellini and it was the best Bellini I've ever had.  I can't remember what my husband ordered but he loved it too.

I ordered the lobster bisque soup and it was really good.  Lots of big chunks of lobster in it.

For our entrees I had the penne Arrabiata and my husband had the mezzaluna.  My pasta was very tasty but the only thing was the pasta was over-cooked.  However my husband thought his pasta was very reminiscent of Chef Boyardee ravioli.  We also had a side of brussels sprouts, which were just ok.  They were also over-cooked.

For dessert we had the chocolate torte.  It was just ok.  My husband said it reminded him of the frozen chocolate cakes you can buy at Trader Joe's.  I'm inclined to agree.

Overall, I would have given them 3.5 stars.  But our service was really good and the drinks were awesome so I'm going to round up.",iFNMxjHh2K-AeLHp7I7SZg,0,0,4,-pnsuwoNer9CHbUSoMSqcw

I told my employees to get whatever they wanted and the waiter was describing some delicious white truffles which were $45 for a few shavings and how they would make any dish excellent.

Well my bonehead employees who never eat out at such a nice place and didn't know anything on the menu except the steak well done were talked into adding truffles to her entree.  Well guess what?  The next two employees said "" I will have what she's having, steak well done with truffles"".  That turned a $40 steak into a $85 steak.  I was putting it on our corporate card and said what the hell, give me truffles too.

Our entrees took a little while to come out (about a half hour), but we weren't in a hurry, so it was not that big of a deal.  They give you a very short wine list with some wines by the glass and popular bottles.  But, they have a pretty good list available, you just have to ask for it.  To start, I had the lobster bisque, which was a special that evening.  I did not care for it.  The vegetables were too crisp and the broth was more like a weak tomato sauce rather than a nice sherry broth.  But, the server took it back no questions asked and it was not on the bill.  So, even though the soup didn't work for me it didn't ruin the meal.  The wife had the caprese salad which was large.  The tomatoes were juicy and the mozzarella had a burrata quality, it was very creamy.  Also, there was a lot of fresh basil, which we love.

For dinner, the wife had the risotto with scallops and shrimp.  This dish includes 3 large shrimp and 2 scallops.  The scallops were much better than the shrimp, they were seared well and were buttery in flavor.  It's not that the shrimp were bad, but there certainly wasn't anything special about them.  The risotto was in a cream sauce, and it was cooked perfectly.  It still had a bite to it, and you get quite a bit.  Even with me helping, she didn't come close to finishing her meal.

I had the pasta special, which was fusilli with mushrooms, prosciutto, and peas in a parmesan cream sauce.  It was topped with a lot of shaved white truffles, they basically covered the entire dish.  The sauce with rich and had a lot of cheese flavor, but it could have used some pepper.  The pasta was pillowy and the sauce filled every nook and cranny.  I loved this dish, it was the best pasta I'd had in a long time.

Our server was fantastic, as was the sommelier.  They were very attentive, and when we told our server we didn't want dessert, he still brought us out a little ice cream topped with espresso and whipped cream.  We mixed them up and they were like little milkshakes.  We had excellent pasta and a wonderful evening, we absolutely recommend Fiamma.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,2,1,4,HWg3Cua4Zd5XGYkCfOX8iw
4960321,2013-01-02,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"My wife and I decided to walk around the strip and find somewhere to eat. I had read reviews on Yelp about Fiamma and had also seen in recommended on other websites as well. Normally I'm not huge on Italian, but my wife loves it and rarely gets to eat it these days. Anyway, we were walking through the MGM Grand and I see Fiamma. All I could think was that I was outrageously underdressed. I was wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and chucks. I have plenty of nice clothes with me on the trip but I was just into something more casual on this particular evening. My wife spotted a few people that were inside that also seemed to be dressed very casually. We decided to try to get in and low and behold, absolutely no problem. They even seated us directly next to the edge of the restaurant so that people walking through the casino could see us. 

What I begin to think was ""okay, so not only do you not care about how I'm dressed, but you're alright with all the other people walking around seeing that I'm underdressed which will attract more people here."" To me that is a sign that they're really not doing all that well. The restaurant does go pretty far back, so maybe this is just where they sit assholes that show up without a collared shirt. I dunno. The music blaring in the MGM Grand was also very annoying.

Our server was very lackluster, but I try as hard as I can to not put too much emphasis on service when I rate somewhere. Everyone has a very different idea of what they like in service and I know that I'm somewhat picky when it comes to what I like and what I don't like. One thing is for sure, that if I've literally taken one bite of my food and you come and ask me ""how is everything?"" you can count on me being pretty annoyed with you. Anyway, I could go off on this tangent forever.

The food! I ordered the raviolini which was literally the redemption of this place. It was outstanding! Full of flavor and cooked properly! The black truffles added a nice earthiness to the meal that was much needed to get through the sauce. Now, my wife ordered a special of the day that was some sort of pasta with a heaping number of truffles! She let me try a bite and I must say that my choice was the better one.

Fiamma is located in the MGM across from Nobu in the restaurant strip area. 

* Burrata - 4.5 stars: Uber creamy and delicious.

* Vongole - 2.5 stars: Lacked umami and the noodles were not al dente enough.
* Kale red pepper pasta - 3 stars: Decent, but dominated by the red pepper flavor. 
* Tiramisu 3.5 stars - Not the traditional presentation, served like a parfait. Was decent but I prefer more cream.
* Chocolate bread pudding - 4 stars: Was dense and rich and unlike any other bread pudding I've had. Had an addictive texture but not anything special.

I had a good feeling when the greeter told us our server would be 'Dallas', since I live in the DFW area... it was just meant to be.  Dallas was a great server, very knowledgeable about the menu - I always give servers at Italian restaurants a menu-workout since I cannot eat basil which is ubiquitous in many dishes.  But, she knew right away which dishes I would be fine with and which I should avoid.   She also gave me a great recommendation when I asked for a cocktail that was sweet and not too strong -- the pear martini was AMAZING.  It tasted like a slightly spiked pear juice.  Probably my favorite boozy drink I have had in years.  I could have drank a 32 oz. big gulp of that stuff (though I probably wouldn't have been able to walk afterwards) -- so a martini size portion was very nice.

I ordered the grilled tiger prawns for a starter and the osso buco as my entree.  Both were terrific.  The prawns appetizer comes with four good sized prawns over a bed of a puttanesca/marinara type sauce -- tomatoes & capers.  Very, succulent and tasty.  The osso buco comes in a bath of sauce with vegetables and mini gnocchi/spaetzle - I think I enjoyed the bath even more than the meat itself, though the meat was fork tender, melt in your mouth.  I think Dallas said the meat was marinated many hours in Peroni beer, but it did not have a beer taste.

There was a good delay between courses but Dallas did ask if we were in any kind of hurry, so presumably service could have been sped up if necessary, but this is the kind of meal you want to enjoy casually and not hurry.  I may try the prawn & scallop risotto next time as that sounded awfully good.  I have to go back for that pear martini though, regardless.",51Dg7npqsTegnd1ZDxVb3w,1,0,4,MDBT3GJ1yT6nk8ZrptzpLA

I usually spend some time researching all of our eating and drinking establishments in Vegas. This one took me one minute after reading the menu and some reviews on Yelp. I did make the reservations through Yelp less then a week before dinning. I thought it would be a ""good"" Italian dinner and off to see the Eagles.

Wow-did I underestimate this place! First-it is very modern and sleek. It is a bit loud and full of energy, just like a fun Vegas restaurant should be. There is a bar area where you could have dinner as well.

Our server was fine. He did all the basics but it seemed he might have had too many tables to handle that night. At one point we were looking for him but overall he was acceptable. 

Wine list was nice and I recognized a Cab. listed only by the glass. We asked and they were happy to get us a full bottle even though it was not normally served that way. It was so nice not to have a hassle when we asked about it and the wine was fantastic.

I started with the beef carpaccio. It was outstanding-some of the best I have ever had. So fresh and full of flavor. My friends each had the pear and blue cheese salad and raved about it. For a main I had the sea bass. Wow-again full of extraordinary flavor and you could taste the freshness. My friends tasted it and I believe they wished they had ordered it. Another main was the salmon and a third had the beef filet 12 oz. (yes-a big piece of meat). I tasted each and they were melt in your mouth good. We didn't have time for dessert as the Eagles were waiting for us.

I knew this would be a good experience but didn't expect a 5 star experience. I highly recommend Fiamma if you are looking for a nice long enjoyable dinner or a quick high quality meal before a show.

They start you with a basket of good focaccia  bread with a plain and flavored butter.

The clams were perfectly cooked and tender and the sauce was a little different with the addition of some cream, which I think added to the richness to the dish. It was a good plate of pasta.

The sommelier came to the table very quickly and helped us get a lovely Napa wine that wasn't too expensive. She was an expert and the best part of the visit. 

The food was good, but not the best Italian I've ever had. The best Italian makes you feel like you've just come home, it's filling, and effortlessly done. The food here is a bit pretentious, in smaller portions, and seemed like it was trying too hard. Not to mention, the prices are insane. Just like everywhere on the strip.

I had the caprese salad, which was my favorite part of the meal. It was classic Italian with a large mound of fresh mozzarella right in the middle. The tomatoes were perfect.   My entire choice was the short rib ravioli. I didn't really taste short rib at all, mostly just in your face truffle oil. It was very flavorful and rich.

The place is nice and you may think it's an arm and a leg but it's pretty affordable considering the other options, and don't worry about the dress code too much because they seem to take anyone. 

Food is what matters most and it's fantastic here. 

We started with some fried calamari that was made perfectly, not over-fried ans not too rubbery, the sauce it came with was phenomenal. 

I also had a Caesar salad for starters and loved it, shaved Parmesan over crunchy lettuce and a cream dressing, the waiter (who was quick and very attentive) topped it off with cracked pepper which make it so much better. 

For the main course i had the scallop and prawn risotto, which was real good, i had some grated cheese on top and it went perfect with the jumbo ""prawn"" which was really just regular shrimp, but I'll forgive them because their food is that good. 

Our dinner for 4 with a starter and main course plus a glass of wine was $212, which is great for a non-casual dinner spot that is semi-trendy. 

Come here and enjoy if you are staying in the MGM Grand because you will love it, just be aware you should put at least 90 minutes aside (and probably 2 hours) because they like to spread out the meal the way it's supposed to be!

For dessert they brought out an assortment of dishes.  The tiramisu was rich and creamy and the torte was the densest brick of chocolate fudge I've ever tasted.  There was an assortment of sorbets which included blood orange (delicious) and the earl gray (interesting) flavors.

Fiamma was by far the best food I had on my entire trip. I went with the surf and turf special which came with a 10oz Ribeye and two lobster tails ($85). It was prepared absolutely perfect and even the starter salad was amazing. 

At this point you are probably wondering why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Well simple, as the check came for $190 dollar tab, I explained to the waitress that my card had just started acting up on this trip. Most likely an issue with the magnetic strip, but could be entered manually (as it had been before by numerous other high end restaurants) and should be good to go. 

She said no problem and would be right back. After a couple minutes she came back and said she needed to run it at the front. A couple minutes went by again and some women who I can only assume was some type of manager (as she didn't introduce herself) walked up with the check and stated that she needed another card as she could not enter the card manually. She claimed it was to ""prevent fraud."" As a minimalist I only carry my card, ID, and maybe a 20 spot on me which obviously was not going to cover the bill. 

I had to leave the restaurant while my guest stayed at the table and I went looking for ATM in the casino. The ATM ACCEPTED my card and I was able to pull out cash to cover the bill. Now my guest was a long time friend so I wasn't really embarrassed but if I was with a client it would have been another situation. 

It just honestly felt like the restaurant thought I was trying to pull a fast one or commit some type of fraud. Maybe because I wasn't dressed as nice as I could have been? I wasn't looking like a drifter but wasn't wearing a sport coat either. It just really put a damper on an absolutely wonderful meal. If the issue didn't arise the card or should I say the restaurants handling of it, it would have received 5 stars hands down.",jQzVMl9AfvlEEiRuEVOq3Q,0,0,4,zaGCsGEgTRdsncmZNylWcQ

Let's talk dress code. We dressed up, I would say to above what they require as the dress code, so to see people walk in with super casual dress on was a little off-putting.

We did not make a reservation but we were able to get a table right away.

The ambiance of Fiamma is gorgeous. Dark, clean and sexy. The music is not too loud at all, though we were seated further to the back, so the music from the casino wasn't so obvious. Speaking of seats, we were seating at a not so great table initially, and my husband asked if we could be moved to a cozier seat. The host happily moved us, but this seemed to put our server a little out of shape.

My husband mentioned that it was my birthday and we were given glasses of prosecco on the house, which was nice. The bread basket was fine, we both really loved the cheese crispy bread (for want of a better description!). I ordered a starter of butternut squash soup, garnished with spinach and shrimp (but I held the shrimp). We got mezzaluna ravioli with a tomato sauce and a fettucini with pancetta, shaved garlic and mushrooms. The soup was smooth and a little creamy, and the spinach was a lovely addition. My husband enjoyed his ravioli, and my fettucini was delicious. I haven't had pancetta for a while so it was a little treat. The servings are pretty generous we were both satisfied with our meal.

The service - Our server did not seem happy to be there at all. He was listless and gave the appearance of being annoyed at any requests or questions. He was overly attentive, in a way. He checked on us seemingly every few minutes, but seemed to not really be invested in how we were doing, more like he was checking out of habit? He just gave me a weird vibe. We also had other managers checking on us constantly, which made actually enjoying the meal and the company of my husband a little difficult. Lastly, our server seemed annoyed that we did not want to order dessert or coffee.

We ordered the lasagna and the trio.  I could not believe how bad the trio was, all starch and hardly any meat.  It was just poorly made.  It didn't taste fresh, more like it was just heated up.  Soggy groose pasta. The lasagna was okay, nothing special but it was worth more like $15 at most.

When I saw an Italian pasta I didn't recognize, I had to try it. Fazzoletti: it's fun to say, and they are giant pasta pillows filled with spinach and ricotta. Sounded like a winner to me! Our waiter let us know it was a recent addition to the menu. I took a risk by not ordering one of the signature items: lobster gnocchi, a truffle masterpiece, or short rib ravioli.

I thought the fazzoletti were good, but not divine. The tomato sauce was on the bottom, and the 4 ginormous pillows were sitting on top. (Definitely not skimpy orders!) I found myself trying to scoop sauce onto each bite, and I wondered why they didn't put the sauce on top. I am sure there is a culinary reason, but from a practical standpoint, I thought the dish made it hard to appreciate what was truly a wonderful tomato sauce hiding underneath.

Little things make me happy, so when the overflowing plate of asparagus hit the table, my eyes lit up! Once again, a big serving, and it was not jumbo asparagus. I prefer the smaller, tender stalks, so that made me doubly pleased. Bread and water service was perfect!

The husband went for seafood, and he was happy as a bi-valve for sure. He started with mussels and ended with sea bass. He smiled the entire time, and he too was impressed with the generous portions. 

I love that they offer half bottles of wine. And, our server said he had been working there for seven years! I would say he knows his stuff, and his length of employment suggests to me that Fiamma does a lot of things right.

Catching the back-side of Autumn just a week before the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas sees many restaurants slow, Chef Pinisetti reporting several record weeks prior thanks to convention season, it was with deference to the kitchen and Fiamma's Tasting Menu option that control was turned over to the Kitchen shortly after ordering Iced Tea, Caleb Anderson as well as Chef Hamada and the restaurant's new GM all stopping by to say hello as diners conversed while enjoying the housemade Bread and Tomato-Basil Spread.

At this point a known entity with several signature dishes, MGM Grand's website dubbing the Restaurant ""Fiamma Italian Kitchen"" doing the menu no justice by only listing ""Featured Items,"" it was for the sake of time that this visit was compressed into three courses featuring sixteen total plates, appetizers once again composed of the smoky Mediterranean Octopus and Beef Meatballs in addition to Fiamma's stellar Carpaccio topped in Burgundy Truffles, the lone new dish a Frisee and Arugula Salad with crisp Vegetables, Roasted Pears, Candied Walnuts and Bleu Cheese.

Combining Pasta and Secondi into a single table-flooding course, the focus entirely on new plates including two daily specials and an impressive spiral of thin Capellini slicked with smoked Tomato Sauce and topped in Fried Lobster from the upcoming menu, it was somewhat surprising that a bowl of Linguini and Clams was this time a highlight having previously been off-putting and acidic, the substitution of Cream for Tomatoes making the dish far more comforting and creating for a nice back-and-forth with the daily special of fragrant Saffron Risotto topped in Prawns and a tangle of Pea Tendrils. 

Changing the prior Sea Bass to a generous filet of Baramundi served alongside Summer Panzanella with crispy Croutons and vibrant Heirloom Tomato Jam it was from the skilled hands of Chef Hamada that another daily special of Hunter-style Chicken was presented, the crispy Breast's perch atop soft Polenta and smothering with melted Fontina playing well off Capers and Olives amidst crushed Tomatoes and Mushrooms while both side dishes were equally well presented, the Broccolini lightly spiced and rife with Garlic while Potatoes seen prior remain crisp on the exterior and soft within amidst Cheese, fried Pork Jowl and Green Onions.

Transitioning from savory to sweet, Pastry Chef Denise Elrod recently posting pictures of upcoming items for Fiamma as well as Morimoto and Crush, it was as the dry-ice display of the Restaurant's Peach Bellini billowed forth that Pawan described two new Desserts in addition to the Triple Chocolate Bread Pudding also seen in March, the Tiramisu Parfait a bit heavy handed as both the Chocolate and Espresso were quite bitter while the Pistachio-Raspberry Tartufo excelled in its subtlety, the 'crust' thin but dense enough to give the Ice Cream some tooth while the trio of Gelato and Sorbet saw Passion Fruit predictably cloying though the Lemon-Basil and Jack Daniels-Cherry Coke were both very well executed with the latter quite boozy.

****1/2:  Understanding the need to maintain signature items and serve guests of all sorts, but with a bit less ""wow-factor"" this time than last, Fiamma nonetheless remains one of Las Vegas' best Italian Restaurants in terms of Food and service even when doing bit volume, the prix-fixe/tasting menu additionally giving guests a chance to experience a great restaurant on the Strip at a good value.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,7,5,CLqq_a7uE6-JSW0ijPPwMw

My friend and I ended up here after wandering around the MGM looking for a place to eat before the Ka show that looked good yet didn't have a huge wait. We were both pleased with our choice of Fiamma.

The space is very attractive. It is well decorated, lit dimly but no so dimly you can't read the menu without holding a candle to it (doncha hate that?) and it even has a nice modernist gas-burning fireplace. The staff is as attractive as the space, which is never a requirement but also appreciated, but only if they are competent as well as gorgeous. They seem to be here at Fiamma.

So with all that yummy before you order a thing, how's the food? Not a disappointment! In fact, it was very good. I had the spaghetti with Kobe meatballs. It was very tasty. My only complaint was that they were a bit heavy-handed with the sauce. For dessert we had something that was basically beignets, but I forgot what they called them. Doughnut-somethings? They were delicious and came with 3-4 different dipping sauces.

Finally, the prices. I feel like I say the same thing in all of my Vegas restaurant reviews.... it's a restaurant in a hotel on the Strip.

Appetizers were amazing, and so was our waiter (_____).  However, the entrees were terrible.  Lobsters were clearly not fresh (from frozen), and were deep fried and drenched in oil, as though to cover the lack of freshness and dryness of the overfrozen meat.  Capellini was also sitting in orange oil.  For $38 x 2 ($76), I am surprised Fiamma could not offer something better than oil-drenched pasta and fried frozen lobster bits.  We ate about 1/3 of each dish, and I went home with a stomach ache.  About 2 hours later, I threw up, and felt much better after doing so.   

MGM solicited my feedback and that I emailed fiamma@lv.mgmgrand.com, which I did.  Thought it was more than fair to ask for the lobster capellinis to be removed from the bill, especially since they solicited my feedback.  No one responded.

He was funny, informative and engaging. Before the presentation, we got to sample some Prosecco and Arancini (little fried balls of rice that were stuffed with beef and cheese). They were both wonderful!

5391791,2011-09-20,2,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"This was our second time experiencing Fiamma.  Both visits warrant a five-star rating.

We started with some chichi cocktails, none of which we could even pronounce. Each drink was extremely well made with fresh ingredients and reputable spirits.  The quality of the cocktails were definitely worth the price, especially considering the fact we were dining on the strip.  The restaurant could have charged more for their specialty cocktails if they really wanted to.

From there we had the Carpaccio and calamari as appetizers.  The Carpaccio was perfectly executed and a great way to start the meal.  The calamari is one of the best I've ever eaten.  Evenly coated, crispy throughout and perfectly seasoned.  Fried zucchini and pepperoncini are tossed with the calamari.  In my personal opinion the sauces served with the calamari are superfluous.  Amazing dish.

Fiamma has an excellent selection of wines by the glass, which are also priced very reasonably considering the quality that is offered.  The thing I like most about the wine selection is the different pour sizes offered.  4oz. or 6oz.  The 6 oz. pour was perfect for me and my wife to split for each course.  Standard pours can get too expensive and get you too tipsy if you're going to pair a different glass with each course. 

For entrees we seemed to have ordered the restaurants most popular items.  The Gnocchi with lobster and truffles, the Short Rib Ravioli, Braised Short Ribs, and the Mediterranean Sea Bass.  We shared everything so everyone could try the different dishes which were all excellent.  The Braised Short Ribs and the Gnocchi stood out the most and I highly recommend these two items.

Our stomachs were stuffed to capacity, but we ordered dessert anyways.  Our genius plan was to order a small dessert for the four of us to share so not to make ourselves more uncomfortable.  So we decided on the doughnuts with chocolate and caramel dipping sauce.  The portion was huge; the four of us could barely finish the dessert after that meal.  Unfortunately the doughnuts were so good, that we couldn't stand leaving any leftovers so we forced ourselves to devour every last delicious bite.",KlD2U69cqxi01TelonOtxw,1,0,5,Uf6B-1MmkX7nf48EgCGGUw

5414792,2012-07-30,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"We had tickets to Ka so we decided to just make a ""date night""-type evening by getting reservations at Fiamma. We were told by the concierge when we made the reservations that the dress code for Fiamma is supposed to be business casual - collared shirts included. We had expected to dress up for at least one meal during our Vegas stay, so we were well-prepared. However, when we showed up at Fiamma, we were surprised (and a little put-off) by the number of people that failed to adhere to the dress code, which is noted on the website as well as by the MGM staff.  There was a fair amount people in casual clothing as though they literally just walked in from sight-seeing all day in shorts and sandals. 

In any event, the Fiamma staff, and our server in particular, were stellar and very friendly. Even the managers stopped by a few times to check on us. Compared to our experience at Fleur the night before, the Fiamma staff definitely was better and more attentive. The staff was also very knowledgeable about the menu and food in general and based upon their explanations and questioning, I'm guessing they get a fair amount of guests that aren't really that knowledgeable about food and wine. 

This evening, we ordered/tried:

- Crispy calamari: This came with a lot more tentacles than the ""rings"", which doesn't bother me, but important to note in case you are with diners that won't eat calamari tentacles. Generally speaking, the batter was light and crispy, and the tiny fried pieces of zucchini and pepperoncini were unexpected but tasty. The tomato aioli is a great accompaniment and we preferred that over the marinara. 

- Traditional potato gnocchi with lobster, mushrooms and black truffles: If you like black truffles and mushrooms, this is definitely the dish for you. The sauce is literally a powerhouse of mushrooms and truffles. The lobster bites themselves are tasty but generally speaking, the mushroom sauce takes center stage. The gnocchi is definitely housemade and pillow-y with a slight bite. 

- Scallops and prawns risotto: This came with three large bay scallops and three huge wild prawns. The scallops were cooked well, though I personally prefer a little more caramelization than this. The prawns were very fresh and cooked perfectly through. The risotto was cooked with just enough moisture left in it that it didn't turn into a paste as it cooled. Too often, risotto is served without enough moisture and it congeals into an unappetizing mess. Here, the risotto remained consistent and ""smooth"". 

- Torta al cioccolato: We went with the recommendation of the server, who said this is one of the signature desserts at Fiamma. Maybe it is because I was really full at this point, but I didn't love it as much as I thought I would. I prefer a more gooey, rich chocolate cake and this one was more cakey than gooey. I think it needed more ganache and mousse. This came with chocolate gelato, which tasted very much like a fudgsicle. 

- Fiamma ""The Original"" (cocktail): My husband really liked this one (enough to order multiples of it). It wasn't sweet at all, which is probably why I wasn't personally a fan. 

- Kerry's Strawberry Balsamic (cocktail): This was much sweeter than ""The Original"" and I liked it a lot. There was a hint of the berry which worked with the white balsamic. Nothing overpowered the other so it all blended together quite harmoniously. 

- Moscato D'Asti (Tintero): Our server treated us to this as a palette cleanser before the dessert and it was actually quite good. I'm generally quite fond of sparkling wines (especially the very sweet ones) and this definitely was on the sweet side (more so than the cocktails actually).

- Complimentary bread basket: Okay, so I don't normally review the bread basket, but I really liked the cheese cracker/flatbread that arrived. It was light and crunchy with just the right amount of cheese. The olive oil that came with the bread basket was nice too, with just a hint of olive versus a ""bam, in your face"" olive flavor.

I think the food is more of a 4 star, but the service was impeccable and very friendly, so that bumped it up to a 5 star rating for me.",PMT94wJvyAQdG9YGZerYAw,4,3,5,LRhCb3dIzJ0gREIep12SJQ

The meatballs were a great starter, I loved eating it with the bread. I think we even ate all the marinara sauce that came with the dish since we used it as a dip for the bread that came with the table. I had the lobster gnocchi, which was good, but not great. What I did like about that dish though was that it had a lot of lobster in it, but overall it was just too heavy and creamy for my taste. 

The highlight of the night was the seafood risotto! It was spicy, creamy, tomato-y all in one dish, with lots of seafood on top. It made me wish that we had ordered two of those instead of the lobster gnocchi.

Started off with some appetizers and then our entrees plus sides. 
Everything tasted so good.

CRISPY CALAMARI
Pepperoncini, Zucchini, Marinara, Tomato Aioli

This was really good,2nd best I have had, not a expert, but tasted good to me.

BEEF CARPACCIO
Thinly Sliced Tenderloin of Beef, Arugula and Seasonal Mushroom Salad, Parmesan Flakes, Truffle Pearls

Wonderful, first time and it will not be my last, that is for sure.

RAVIOLINI
Short Rib Ravioli, Black Truffle Crema
Red Wine Reduction

Tasted so good.

Traditional Potato: Maine Lobster,
Cremini Mushrooms, Black Truffle Crema

Was good but after a while it was a bit boring, I think the Trio is calling me.

GRILLED ASPARAGUS
Parmesan Sprinkle

Crispy and Tasty

CRISPY YUKON GOLD POTATOES
Parmesan Cheese

Had better, would not order them again.

2 free dinners consisting of the seasonal menu course.  I've only been to the one in NYC years ago.  Kinda crazy we've never gone to this one after living here for quite some time.  

My wife and I just shared everything and it went down like this:

Antipasti:

Caprese w/ Imported Buffalo Mozzarella, Baby Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil: 

The creamiest buffalo mozzarella I've EVER had.  It almost had a cream cheese quality to it.  Incredible!

Crispy Calamari, Peperoncini, Zucchini, Fresh Lemon, Parsley:

I really liked how the deep fried all the ingredients (sans lemon) with the calamari.  Gave it a unique flavor..the fried parsley really works.


Secondi:

Ravioli alla Fiorentina filled with Fresh Ricotta and Spinach, Butter and Sage Sauce:

I'm usually not into cream sauces for pasta but this was excellent.

Organic Free-Range Chicken, Wild Mushrooms. Fingerling Potatoes, Natural Chicken Jus:

I have a hard time ever justifying paying more than $10 for any chicken dish anywhere but we got this since it came highly recommended by the waiter.  Outstanding!!  I would actually pay $20 for this dish.  And I usually peel the skin off chicken for health reasons but it was a must eat for this dish.  I'm salivating just thinking about the flavor of this dish.   

Dolci:

Pastry Chef's Dessert Sampler:

I was honestly high from chicken at this point so I don't know exactly what the trio was but one was like a chocolate ice cream bon bon, some kinda flan and tiramisu.  It was truly struggle to finish dessert since we were so stuffed but we managed somehow, some way :)

Couple of glasses of wine and cucumber martinis really put the bow on this dinner.  The regular menu looked incredible and might be back next week!!!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,11,7,5,pYU_tn0J5_STEPvdaKuevw

I had the black cod, which I've never had before, so I don't have much to compare to, but I've had fish before, and this was a yummy piece of fish.

5557484,2009-08-10,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"Swayed by my overwhelming compulsion to be FRUGAL as possible in Vegas, I convinced my girlfriends to have dinner @ Fiamma, prior to our KA showing @ 9.30 pm on a Wednesday night. 

Making a reservation for four a week ahead seemed silly, especially when in every restaurant, it's never full to capacity!  WTF would any one have to wait any more than 5 minutes, I can't tell you, but it beats just standing and doing nothing.  

Four girls from Louisiana and we get David as our server, from Louisiana as well.  What are the odds, eh???  Anyhoo, we all opted for the summer tasting menu - three courses for $45, or with wine pairings, an extra $25 on top.  We didn't do the wine pairing, but I did get the Bellini.  I heart sweet alcoholic drinks and this was delicious!  The champagne wasn't too dry and the peach syrup was refreshing.

For starters, the girls had Caesar salad and I had the grilled octopus with a tomato and olive and capers type of chutney/sauce.  The octopus was really char-grilled, and at times it overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the protein, but not at all was it chewy or rubbery.  Delicious and tender!  

Entree - the girls had the grilled skirt steak and I had the salmon.  WOW was the steak delicious.  One of the girls commented how this was the best steak ever - tender, juicy, not too salty, just tasty.  And when I bit into it, I almost regretted getting the salmon - it was tasty!!!

The salmon was fresh and delicious.  It was barely seasoned as the pancetta provided enough saltiness and the corn ragu added a touch of sweetness....mmmmm.....I had to force myself to finish the last bite - still bracing the fact that we had dessert coming as well.

Four choices of desserts and four girls = sharing all dessert!!!  Hands down, our favorite was the chocolate tarfuto - the hazelnuts and dark chocolate poured over the caramel gelato...MMMMM. 

The sorbet trio was fantastic - cantaloupe tasted exactly like one!  Next favorite was the tiramisu - we found the espresso powder covering the delicate dessert to be overpowering, but still tasting.  And the least favorite was the panna cotta.  I think the girls were turned off by the figs, but the almonds and honey really brought out the marscapone in the panna cotta.

Not to mention that David's fellow server, Brian was really hamming it up with us.  Prior to dessert, he sent over some miscotti or dessert wine.  It was SOOO delicious, that one of the girls took my glass and promptly finished it off.  Of course we had to thank Brian for his generosity, and even took a picture with him.  

Anyhoo, Service here was fantastic, the food very tasty.  I appreciated the fact that David asked if we were on a time frame, and even though we didn't make it out in time, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.",T6zcfyO8eR2Py9V_bK_K4w,0,0,4,wVOV_2SaRR8mXCR5u-Lacw

5674606,2012-09-17,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"Simply AMAZING! From the start, the hostess was super friendly and I loved the atmosphere/ambiance of the restaurant. It is dimly lit, with a bar/lounge to the right and a dining room to the left. In the back of the lounge there is a fireplace as well.

We started out with a bottle of Chianti, recommended by the Sommelier (don't remember the name of the wine, but it was delicious). We also had a salad, with greens, garbanzo beans and a bunch of other stuff tossed in a super light sauvignon dressing. SO good.

The main courses were the short rib ravioli and the lobster gnocchi. I mustve died and gone to heaven, because both were absolutely to die for! I preferred the gnocchi, I thought that there was the perfect amount of lobster and that the gnocchi themselves were perfect little pillows of doughy deliciousicity....but my party all really loved the raviolis as well, and they were super good. The short rib filling was really tasty, as was the sauce.

For dessert, I am fairly certain that we went overboard and had just about everything on the menu. I am not sure where I found a place for these sweets to go, but somehow managed. The tiramisu was light and fluffy and very well done. We had a sampling of 3 ice creams (choc, vanilla and nutella) and 3 sorbets (cantaloupe - yum, honeydew - kinda bland, could be due to all of the other rich items we had, and berry). We also had some sort of crazy layered chocolate cake, which was chocolate overload and included like 6 different types of chocolates from Europe. There was a cheesecake sampler (this is ridiculous, I know), which was beyond amazing. I can't remember what they were called, but we also had the Italian version of beignets, with chocolate sauce and berry sauce (these were better than any beignets I've ever had!). Shoot, I am leaving a few things out. Seriously, it was a smorgasbord of gourmet proportions!

FiAMMA may have easily become my new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. They have been doing what they do, quietly, for years inside the MGM Grand. And they are damn good at it. I have been telling all of my friends about how great the food and the service was, but you should go see for yourself! I will be dreaming of those lobster gnocchis tonight!

Decided to skip the salad for a vegetable side (sautéed spinach) with our entrees: lobster gnocchi (after much internal debate between this and the sea bass) and the mezzaluna (pesto filled half moon ravioli with a red vodka cream sauce).

Complimentary bread, butter and roasted red pepper cheese spread was served. A braided roll was included and it was hot and delish with the cheese spread. The Italian bread was crusty with an herbed soft inside. The bread arrived quickly and so did out entrees. We were stunned at how quick our entrees arrived. I barely had time to butter my bread.

The spinach was heaping, one of the largest sides of veggies I've ever received at any restaurant. It was sautéed in garlic, seasoned just right. Piping hot but not overcooked. The lobster ravioli was to die for. We're from the east coast so lobsters are my specialty and this dish was spot on. Plenty of lobster pieces, tender gnocchi and flavorful sauce. The hubby enjoyed his mezzaluna, tasty but not over-filling.

We were going to skip dessert given the late hour but were tempted to see the menu. We shared the creme brûlée and it was equally as pleasing as our meal. Glad we decided to share as it was plenty for two.

The risotto was amazing (if you read my reviews you know by now that I HEART risotto) and the cucumber martini (another fave) was delicious.  

I was not incredibly impressed with the veal ravioli, but the gnocchi was pretty damn impressive.

The Mezzaluna on the other hand had a very refreshing taste to it.  The cherry tomatoes were the best part about it and honestly it might have been my yearning for fresh food the entire weekend that made this dish taste so good.

After being seated about 7:30 p.m. we were given water and menus right away, and that's where anything I could call service ended.  20 or 25 minutes passed, and someone in our group had to hail down the server to take our orders- they hadn't even come by for drink orders.

Our food took a very long time, was lukewarm when it came out, and was extremely skimpy on the portions that matter.  I ordered the shrimp risotto with jumbo sea scallops, and while there was a decent amount of risotto, there were no more than 5 dime-sized shrimp all on one side of the dish, and the scallops were medium size- about the size of a quarter.  Worse yet, they had cut them in half putting the bronzed side up to make it look like more, so the three scallops I was looking at were only 1.5 scallops, and weren't even as thick as my pinky finger.  What was there tasted good even lukewarm, which is why I've given two stars rather than one, but the menu was a complete overstatement of the dish.

The couple in our group that had ordered the prix menu had to hail the waiter over to get their dessert and check so that they could make their 10 pm show, the rest of us, clearly also ready, had to hail him again after he disappeared after taking care of them (they did make their show, but missed some of the pre-show).  The other thing that really bugs me is that we were seated there over 2 and a half hours, saw a manager around, but they never approached our table for the standard ""how is everything"".

If you insist on going to this restaurant (and with so many wonderful options in Vegas, I don't know why you would), do NOT go with 6+ people- it was very apparent from the evening that the servers were guaranteed their 18% automatic tip for groups, and thus completely blew us off.",P7Gzueku0UJHfN5pBciDeg,0,0,2,k1K9zwMdBPD7nYk2_eJiug

the hostess was on the phone when we arrived for our reservations, but didn't acknowledge us with eye contact or any form of accommodation. then she seated us in the section closest to the throng of casino goers and sloppy drunk coeds with their yard margaritas in tow, trailing the smell of cloves and cigarettes as they pass. fortunately, our request to be reseated was granted.

i had a cucumber martini that was really sweet. not bad, but not good- mediocre, at best. i loved my lobster/mushroom/black truffle gnocchi- i could've eaten two servings. a tad on the salty side, but the pillowy texture of the gnocchi was great. the SO's short rib plate came out room temp and asked them to reheat it; they replaced it with a hotter whole new plate (though i think she wanted it even hotter).

herb butter tasted exactly like tony roma's: very salty and seemed like they didn't use fresh herbs (schillings?). complimentary bread looked and tasted like a stale version of the par-baked il fornaio rolls you can buy at trader joe's.

our server, reed, was professional, thorough, and responsive. the surprise birthday dessert made me smile like a geek, and it was quite good. tip: they have a special tasting menu for $45/person, which includes app, main, and dessert. though it looked tempting, we opted for a la carte instead.

overall, it was a good experience. a pretty nifty pre-birthday meal. :)",fQuLe-KuojSco4DRbcFpGw,1,1,3,l3z8G6DfaL2Uibiaa14Usw

Our service was pretty good, I never had to wait very long for anything. I sort of made my own entree. I wasn't looking for anything very heavy. I was eying the ""Spaghetti Chitarra"" but thought the prawns sounded good on the Fettuccine with pesto sauce. I ended up with the Chitarra with prawns instead of meatballs. The pasta was delicious. It definitely tasted homemade. The prawns were some of the best I've had - super fresh and perfectly cooked.

For dessert I really wanted the Crochette, but unfortunately they were out. We ended up going with the semifreddo al terrone, which was like a frozen meringue. Great flavor and not at all heavy.

I definitely thought this place was way better than Shibuya across the hall. We didn't have reservations when we showed up at 6pm on a Sunday night before a concert, but they had a long wait when we tried to come on Saturday so I recommend reservations if possible!",5uwsIgJFakD6AJ_wji6ThA,2,1,4,xf8xH6mCEHZoKsBblOti7w

The food was the most disappointing, however, especially considering the price. The octopus tasted like it was well past it's sell-by date, and the pasta tasted frozen. Sauces were bland

This time, the food was amazing, the service friendly and attentive.  I had the boar ragu gnocchi and the caprese salad.  Both were superb!   Paired with a Super Tuscan from the appreciated wine list (not that their cellar is Spartan...they have both a short and long list from which to choose), it was one of the best meals I can remember!

5931871,2015-03-12,0,dCUuzw3R2rPqKyN2Zl9zRw,"This was my third time at Fiamma. I really like this place it's just that they are not hitting on all the marks. The bartender was friendly, I like the decor but the food is just ok. Not bad but just not great.  I'll start with the bread. two kinds, one was soft with a nice crust. I'm not sure what the other was but it seemed stale with no flavor at all. It was a braid of some sort. The tomato butter that it was served with was just short of not even palatable. This is just my opinion but it was like putting tomato paste on bread
I started with the octopus. The octopus was cooked perfectly and you could taste the char.  The salad, tomatoes and beans it was over would have been great if they were not swimming in dressing.
I then had the gnocchi with lobster and truffles. This was a good solid dish but not a wow dish. I found it a little heavy with the sauce making it unable to taste the lobster. Their was however a lot of lobster in this dish. Again it was good just not great. They used to have a mushroom gnocchi with truffles that was mind blowing. This was not that dish which may be unfair as I'm comparing it to that.",gHXMDGaz7JDPtsKRE4W0yA,0,0,3,3Uowq0r9ftczU9v1-SJuiQ

We arrived without a reservation just as the dinner rush was beginning one night during March Madness. The dining room was full with reservations, but they informed us that all tables in the lounge + bar were first come first serve...and there are a ton of them, so we had no problem finding a seat! A short while later, the place was packed, but they seemed fully capable to keep up with the demand. They have a separate lounge menu, but they also serve the full dinner menu there, which is fantastic (because a lot of places don't). So on to the food...

My friend and I had trouble deciding what to get, so we each selected an entree and shared. They make their own gnocchi from scratch, so we decided to try one of their specials: Pesto and Pine Nut Gnocchi. It was easily the best gnocchi I've had at a restaurant, but it was the Scallop and Prawn Risotto that won my heart...it was absolutely to die for!

On a side note, a few nights earlier when we were at a bar across the hall, we ordered limoncello, but they didn't have it. So, our bartender walked over to Fiamma since he figured an Italian bar would have it. They did, and they were gracious enough to give it to him so he could fulfill our request.

Most of the pasta options were around $22 - $25 so we thought this would fit the bill.  The waiter shared the specials with us and 3 of us opted for the pasta special with truffles.  While we expected they would be more expensive than the regular pasta dishes we were stunned when the bill arrived and we saw they were $69 each!!!  If you're going to have a special that's almost 3 times the cost of your regular dishes you should tell your guests up front.  After our meal we noticed someone hovering around our table.  A few minutes later we were asked to move to the bar area so they could seat anther group.  While it was nice that they bought us each a drink I still think it's pretty tacky to ask your guests to move.",u21tdty27BT447Xrq7Opsw,0,0,1,EkMAUxSaE61FGzSQvc_g_w

My husband wanted steak. At just under 50.00 the steak was pretty good.  Prices in Vegas always surprise me, but steaks are expensive any place. 
Ordered medium rare, the steak was cooked perfectly.
I ordered seafood linguine, one of my favorite Italian inspired dishes, and the sauce was a bit too mild for moi, but the 



seafood was REALLY fresh and linguine tasted home made.

I really tried to stay away from the bread but noteworthy is the fresh flavored  garlic butter, tomato butter,  that can fill me up and satisfy any day before the entrees are served.",P1JqTh13dpAZ16U1ZPw_IA,6,6,3,3O37F6xM-slHCpbgOKwlTQ

The service, however, was so disappointing.  We had reservations but still waited over 15 minutes for our table. Granted we came on a very busy night- right before the Rolling Stones concert, however our server could have cracked a smile, or even introduced himself.  But, no...and unfortunately that put a damper on the entire meal.  Also, because it opens into the casino/walkway- it  reeked of cigarette smoke and every once in a while, you would hear cheers/grunts/yelling from drunk passerbys.  We asked to be moved because I am very sensitive to the smoke- but it was a full house and no other tables were available.  

If I ignore the service and the table location- the meal was actually quite delicious.  We started with the beef carpaccio appetizer, and it was good, although not the best I have ever had.  Not even close.  We also ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell because the seafood platter that they were offering looked really unappetizing.  In fact, the table next to us were very upset with their sad looking platter- it had 2 oysters, a few scrawny shrimp cocktail, and 2 skinny crab legs- they refused to pay for it and asked for the manager.  I ordered the Lobster Gnocchi and cannot speak highly enough about this dish. Every bite was bursting with flavor.  My husband ordered the Risotto and it came with perfectly cooked scallops and prawns.  

By the time we looked at the dessert menu, the smell of smoke was really irritating me and so was our waiter's attitude. So we asked for the check, and bought dessert elsewhere.

Normally gnocchi for me is comfort italian food because it is so simple and hard to mess up, but the gnocchi here was phenomenal, it had such an amazing amount of flavor.  For starters i had the calamari and sample the mozzarella from my friends plate, the former was very typical and nothing really great, the mozzarella on the other hand tasted like it was made minutes before i arrived and that the tomatoes were flown in that evening and placed onto my place.  I loved this place and we also got a free dessert from our server, so overall it was a great experience.

I had a ""quick"" dinner here before the Stevie Wonder concert.  I ordered the penne arrabbiata with wagyu meatballs. The dish came piping hot (45 minutes later - and just past al dente) and was adequately spicy. The meatballs were tasty, if a bit on the mushy side. 

As this was not a cheap eat ($30 for a pasta dish), I expected the service to be great, which it was not. If there is one thing worth complaining about, it is that the server did just enough for us not to complain too much, but not enough to make the meal anything special.  He willingly came to our table three times - once to take our order, a second time to ask us if our food was ok (someone else delivered our order) and a third time to get the bill. We called him over once to follow up our order and he very brusquely answered, ""They're plating it now.""

While waiting, we overheard a man at the table next to us complaining to the server about how his lamb was undercooked and that his wife's pasta was mushy. The server's response was, ""I don't cook the food, but I'll tell the kitchen."" After hearing that, we got out of there as quickly as possible!",60OhUP904CWpFUOWKdI1gg,1,1,2,FkEtoHLOBxyFTSvUzsHMiw
