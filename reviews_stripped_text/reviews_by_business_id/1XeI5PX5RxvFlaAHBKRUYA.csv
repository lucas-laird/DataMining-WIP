I have a certain acai bowl order including apples, cinnamon, granola, and honey that I get every time back at home. Unfortunately this location didn't offer that bowl. Usually a business would have told me ""so sorry, but we don't make that bowl etc"" but these people were AMAZING and went above and beyond with great customer service. They not only called other locations for the ingredients necessary but made it perfectly and for free! The people behind this company are amazing and this locations customer service surpassed anything I've witnessed before.

1095373,2015-10-07,1,1XeI5PX5RxvFlaAHBKRUYA,"There's something about when an owner works their own business that really stands out to me, and it's evident in the quality of their product. That's exactly how it is at Bowl of Heaven. The gentleman even noticed me standing outside waiting for them to open one day, and opened early for me so I could make it to class on time! 

One thing great about this above other ""Jamba Juice"" and ""Tropical Smoothie"" places is they don't load sugar into everything and claim it's healthy. You know exactly what's going into every thing you order which is very important to me and other health conscious people. 

I've been to Bowl of Heaven on multiple occasions, it's located directly across from UNLV next to Cafe Rio so it's very convenient for students or anyone who works in the area. 

They offer acai bowls (which seem to be the most popular), fresh juices, and smoothies. 

For Acai Bowls, I've tried: 

North shore Original- Organic Acai, Strawberries, Bananas, Blueberries, Apple Juice & Topped with hemp, sliced banana and honey. DELICIOUS. Refreshing.

Peanut butter bowl- My absolute favorite (I'm a huge peanut butter fan). Essentially the same ingredients I believe but with peanut butter and chocolate almond milk instead of apple juice. This one is richer, but still very refreshing. 

I love the bowls so much, I never planned on venturing out, but the owner kindly invited me back to try the fresh juice on the house for my repeat business. 

For juice, I tried the the Green Glory which has Kale, Spinach, Lemon, Cucumber, Celery, Parsley and Apple. I could drink this everyday. It's not harsh (for the beginning juicers) but they put the perfect amount of Apple to add a slight sweetness. 

One day I was on the go and they said they could make any bowl into a smoothie, so I decided to try the Popeye blast. It had the Organic Acai, strawberries, pineapple, blueberries, apple juice, bananas, fresh kale and spinach. Hands down one of the best smoothies I've ever had. 

You really can't go wrong with anything you try here, so if you're unsure, definitely ask the employees. I have several times and they always steer me in the right direction based on my taste buds and what I'm craving!",eMOpOLfR1Zz5tfHUlzMp_w,4,1,5,quixtnay3Pp02zYg0yfSYA

My other friend ordered the berry good. It's toppings were strawberries and blueberries. I can't wait to come back and try other bowls.

I avoid bottled/pre-packaged fruit juices as they're loaded with sugar even if they claim to be organic/ natural/ healthy and what have you - fresh is where it's at. They also have vegan cookies, granola bars, MAQ 7 juice (7 super fruits: maqui, Siberian pineapple, cili, goji berries, acai, Alaskan blueberry, and gac), Bowl of Heaven mercy such as caps and shirts. What they don't have is nutrition facts - not even on their website. Their protein is plant-based (pea, hemp, chia seeds and rice).

North Shore Acai Bowl:
Acai, strawberries, bananas, granola, honey, MAQ7 juice, apple juice, blueberries, hemp and flax seeds. Great flavor and texture combination. I love the granola they use because they're crispy and not the typical crunchy-but-chewy-stick-to-your-teeth granola texture. 4/5

Peanut Butter Acai Bowl: 
Peanut butter, acai, bananas, granola, honey, MAQ7 juice, chocolate almond milk, strawberries, blueberries, hemp and flax seeds. I added chocolate protein powder (you can add 11g or 22g of vanilla or chocolate protein powder to anything).  I typically hate chocolate + peanut butter combo so, I'm not sure what I was thinking for getting this. But oh my, was it delicious! This would probably be the menu item with the highest calorie content. I would guess the regular bowl I got was at least 800 calories - perfect for those who are bulking or those that have a crazy metabolism like me. 5/5

Clean and spacious interior. They have tables and chairs as well as bar/counter top area with plugging stations. There's free wifi - just ask them for the code.

I noticed that they currently have only 2 sizes for the bowls: regular and large ($2 difference but portions aren't that much different) and they're not set up for online ordering and rewards program yet. However, they've only been open for 2 days so, calm down. They're giving out free samples, pens and fridge magnet clippy things.

I'm just happy that we have a nutritious option around campus. We can have fruits, veggies, protein, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents served deliciously in a bowl or cup instead of lard slapped onto carbs!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,10,9,4,LKACax6dNFpAmvps8xdOnA

So unless you have an hour to spare to order and wait for your order, don't come here. They really need to put more than one person working at a time.",xUxsQPflG-uY77SoDx5Ygw,0,0,2,gt-Ydjj4tcpBLGt92FUvDA

Now Vegas has another place for acai lovers to worship and it's located right across from UNLV on Maryland Parkway.  Thanks to Ms. Fitness Cathy C. for her review and letting us know they're open for biz. 
I had the small Popeye bowl and it had a nice, thick consistency with great acai flavor; I could see little pieces of green from the spinach and kale.  Did I just feel my muscles grow?

Being from Hawaii, I have high expectations for how my acai tastes. I would rate the acai a 2.5 just because it taste exactly like a jamba juice smoothie with granola and bananas on top.  It doesn't even taste like acai! Not that great. If you want good acai in vegas, I recommended Acai to the T!",wdQpDnfhZaDuZVM4pvF2xg,9,3,3,mRoLQWAR1K4Tb4Rv5lAzLg

For what you pay, you SHOULD get more fruits. Oh and that ball of peanut butter on top costed me an extra $2. It's the size of a melon baller. Probably won't be back unless I'm passing by.
