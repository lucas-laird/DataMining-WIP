Ordering for four people and having the food being delivered to the table within five minutes, i think  was a good indication of food quality. Awesome service! although i asked for a pint of beer and was instead handed a 12oz bottle and told that they don't have beer on tap, despite the draft beer section of the drinks menu clearly stating what draft beers were on tap... at a different location. Friendly people with really bad food. Comparable to taco bell.",akuPXxBorNu0-NX7r-9kEQ,0,0,2,TswgSrET9zMuqCMMgculKQ

They give free chips & salsa. The salsa is a little watery but very tastey, and the chips come out nice and warm. They have quite the selection when it comes to their menu. Its really hard to find a mexican food place that serves albondigas. Needless to say, that's what I ordered with a sour cream green chicken enchilada and rice + beans. They a very generous with their cheese. Overall, it was delicious and I pretty much ate until I nearly popped.
Our server's name was Tryon and he was a pretty friendly fellow. Not overly in your face, but tentive and smiley. My boyfriend's order came out wrong (the reason for the four stars), but we didn't complain because it was still awesome.

445998,2017-08-06,2,9ehTNgvu0vZgHjWkQqF6KQ,"Let me start off by saying this is definitely not my first choice for Mexican food but when you have family members come to town and they request to go to Macayo's you oblige. I must say, their green corn tamales are delicious and the only reason to ever eat here. That is literally the only positive I can say about this visit. We have been here numerous times and it generally has always been with a large group but we've never had such bad service. 
     We had a party of 15 for dinner and our server's name was Andrew. He was extremely rude and a terrible server. Everyone was drinking either water or Dr. Pepper with the exception of one iced tea yet everyone's drinks were always empty. After asking twice for refills they came around with the pitchers of soda and water and filled everyone's drinks up except for the iced tea. After an additional 10 minutes of waiting, the guest nicely asked again for a refill of her tea and Andrew preceded to tell her that he will get her more tea and he only has two hands. I don't know if he is always this terrible at his job or if it was because he knew he was going to be adding gratuity to the check so his service wouldn't have mattered. I did complain to the manager as we were walking out which I have never done because it was that bad.
     I worked and managed restaurants for many years and the way our party was treated was unacceptable. Honestly, I don't think that I will ever come back to this establishment. Hopefully the management looks into this situation. Sorry Andrew, maybe you should be transferred to the back of house so you don't have direct contact with any customers....",YTx0xPz-wz-owWvirMITpw,0,0,1,7bkdUKZjrrwEz80kLJN02g

2306565,2011-10-26,8,9ehTNgvu0vZgHjWkQqF6KQ,"Ok.

Let me just start out by saying that this is a great Mexican Food Restaurant.

If you loathe Mexican food.

Best thing about eating lunch here? It was out of me less than two hours later!

Explosively.

Really. I swear.

My bud had a 2 for 1 coupon and asked me to join him to talk biz ,so, being cheap, fat and hungry, I said, ""sure'. I knew where the place was ( who hasn't bought street drugs at some point in their lives? Don't judge me!) and made it there only to enter 1981 Mexico. The ""decor"" is barely that. Some frescoes of someone's idea of Mexico could have used a Silkwood shower and the tables looked like ,well, nothing.

The first bad sign? Stale, tasteless chips and some sort of salsa juice. WTF? I mean this set up was so bad even my friend (who will eat anything.) only finished 1/4 of them.

The menu is very typical White suburbia version of Mexican ""Combinacciones Platos"". I was actually in the mood for that. It's like you know it's not real Mexican food but you love it anyway. 

And then I made a mistake that would cause our waitress, Surlyrella, to decide that she and I were NOT going to be Freunden. 

Not.

""You know what? I'll have a cheese taco as well as my Enchiladas"", I gamely said to the looming rock of hate. ""CHEESE TACO?', she hissed. 

We stared at each other like two mean Wildebeest about to go all Wild Kingdom on each other. Being Gay, I was not about to back down.

""It's a TACO WITH CHEESE"", I looked her gaze right back at her now beady steely eyes.

""Hmph"", she shot back in a way that said, ""screw you and your mother for letting you down the birth canal!""

So.

The ""food"" came.

As did the next twenty minutes of my choking down some of the blandest globs of cheese, rice and beans that I have endured since Swanson decided to take on the Mexican TV tray market. 

It came, but it didn't went fast enough for me.

Fast forward to me back at work breaking my cardinal rule, ""No number 2 at the office!' 

Explosively.

Oh yeah. That cheese taco? A hard shell with some cheese shoved in with that nasty from the bag shredded lettuce you get on clearance at Food For Less. Despicable.

I hate this place and strongly suggest you eat at , well, anywhere other than here.",wIaktmJWXbvRjzMmr_Q1Gg,2,1,1,d8HbWC3svtSq5YdPl-IX4A
2333978,2015-04-02,7,9ehTNgvu0vZgHjWkQqF6KQ,"Im very picky when it comes to Mexican food. Came here yesterday for the first time because my co-workers suggested it. Never heard of it ever in my life. Walked in and it had a Mexican feel to it, so I was like okay maybe this will be one of those hidden gems.

Sat down and it took them a while to come and ask for our drinks and to deliver us some chips and salsa. The chips and salsa are 'ehhh' they bring you 2 types, 1 is mild and 1 is spicy. The mild salsa is NOT fresh, tastes exactly like the salsa you buy from the store in the glass bottle. The spicy salsa is basically tomato sauce with some spices and wasn't even spicy. Good thing the chips were fresh! 

I ordered the steak fajita lunch meal, which came with sour cream, guacamole, beans and corn tortillas. My co-worker got a the chimichanga lunch meal and my other co-worker got the taco bowl. 

My fajitas were good, and I guess since it is from the lunch menu didn't really come with a lot of meat or veggies. Meat was tender and flavorful and the beans were delish.

I was looking around and I guess they've been there for some time because it was extremely dusty. On the light above our table, the seperators between us were very dusty and it kind of turned me off a little. I understand you've been there for a long time, but it doesn't hurt to do an annual cleaning once and a while.

Overall, food was 'OK', but I don't think I will be coming back. Since it was really dusty and the food was just 'Ok'. Luckily, I wasn't the one who paid for lunch.",eYW6HKDCOLAf1COkxhVG5g,7,4,3,Aa2wmijnBQ0kG68bymfMTg

My last 2 experiences have severely disappointed me.  The food comes out pretty fast, so fast that you question when it was cooked. 
On my most recent visit I ordered the enchilada sampler. This comes with a green spicy chicken enchilada, a ranchero enchilada, and a plain cheese classic one. 
I took a bite of each and was pretty much ready to leave. 
There is just no authenticity to this food at all. I use to come here as a kid, but I wouldn't even bring my own kid here these days. It wasn't the worst, but I think all and all this place just needs a makeover.

2962255,2015-03-30,0,9ehTNgvu0vZgHjWkQqF6KQ,"A Vegas tradition. I remember going to this and other locations (Trop and Maryland is closed! So sad!) Don't let the area or the inside of the restaurant drive you away. It's in a seedy part of town, no doubt and the inside of the restaurant is cheesy as all get out but the food is good and you can generally get out of there spending only about $25 for 2 people. 
Chips are served warm, get the guacamole dip if you want to splurge (at $8.79 it's pricey) but it's served in a mini fried tortilla shell that can be eaten if you're hungry enough to finish all the guac. The salsa is so so - nothing to write home about but it works.
I think the most popular thing here is the TCT - which is essentially just a quesadilla. You can add meat, veggies and beans to make it a little more filling but it's massive - served on a huge pizza pan over a lit candle to keep it warm. You gotta try it at least once. Most people get it as an app but if you're hungry enough, try it as your entree. 
My favorite thing on the menu is Pollo con Espinaca which is grilled chicken in a spicy cream cheese and jack cheese mixture with spinach. It's creamy, spicy, warm and so incredibly delicious. I've tried to replicate it at home but just can't get it quite right. It's served with the flour tortillas and the typical sides-beans and rice. For sure try this if you're looking for something a little more adventurous than a chimichanga (which, by the way, are pretty amazing too). 
The restaurant itself is older and not in the greatest shape. It's got lots of seating - both booths and tables and if they're busy enough they even open up the back area which is kind of a cool spot to eat.
The people are friendly - I swear a few of the ladies there have been there since I was a kid. Service is hit and miss - we had to wait a little too long for drink refills and a chip refill. Our server didn't come back to check on us until we were actually done with our meal but it wasn't a big deal cause we really didn't need anything. While the service may not be a worthy of a 5 star restaurant, it's at least friendly. 
If you've lived in Vegas for any substantial amount of time, you've definitely heard of Macayo's. If not and you're looking for a good spot for generally inexpensive good Mexican food, give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,1,0,4,2koDOf03JZItWHKHG3TBeA

3129805,2015-07-14,1,9ehTNgvu0vZgHjWkQqF6KQ,"When the craving for Mexican hits, it hits hard and nothing else will satisfy.  So I was not stopping until I had some proper Mexican food!  Some co-workers had suggested Macayo and I was pleased to find out there was a location five minutes from my work... how convenient!! I went in with a friend and we were famished, so of course we ordered close to everything on their menu!  We were greeted with warm chips and salsa, which was amazing!  We started with their appetizer sampler and their dip sampler.  Both were HUGE portions and we immediately regretted how much we ordered! The appetizer sampler was great!  It offered pretty much two of everything, which was perfect for us to split.  Their dips are all amazing. 

After sufficiently stuffing our faces with this, the rest of what we ordered showed up at our table.  Now our server definitely thought we were crazy for how much we ordered, but we hadn't been forewarned about the serving sizes! (Consider yourselves warned!  They're HUGE!)  We got a few things to split since we were new to Macayo and wanted to try as much as we could.  We got the TCT and juevos con chorizo.  I feel like we also got something else that is escaping my mind right now!  The TCT is a giant open, family style quesadilla.  It was a great way to share with my friend and put exactly what we wanted on our own quesadilla.  Brilliant in my opinion!  For example, my friend loves beans but I don't... serving the quesadilla this way lets her have what she loves without ruining the quesadilla for me, and vice versa.  

Now after spending a few months in Brazil, I am quite the chorizo enthusiast.  For this reason, I get kind of nervous when I try chorizo at a restaurant, because let's be honest how do you compare to local Brazilian chorizo?  Macayo did not disappoint! Their chorizo was delicious that I ate up every last bite! 

Now, I only tasted one very, very briefly, but from what I'm told their Margaritas are amazing.  From looking at their menu, they definitely offer a variety of flavors and types and my friend got one and they're huge!  I unfortunately don't drink tequila anymore (let's just blame one bad night in college for that one) and couldn't enjoy one of the refreshing drinks, but you should definitely get one next time you stop by Macayo!",FH4wHvhB95Yo7EBspN5Ulg,3,2,4,ZPn0egCt8No8PbHf3QjPhw

. It's been here since I can remember (and that's a mighty long time). The neighborhood around it has gone almost completely Mexican, but Macayo has not! It's still the same old quasi-mexican-style bastion of cuisine that may not be entirely autentico, but suits the cravings of gringos just fine.

 The endless bowls of hot, fresh chips and two kinds of salsa (the chunky is newer and seems to be more popular, but the smooth, more garlicky one still tastes like the 60's and makes me happy), and, of course, the crispy, cheesy, and just a little greasy TCT, are the draws that bring us back again. Never did care much for their regular tacos - too fast-food/ kind of dog-foody tasting but their deep fried shredded beef ones are sooo tasty, as are the wonderful cheesy, sour creamy enchiladas suizas.

 Now bringing the third generation here to color the exact same sombrero boy on the kid's menu.

4067497,2014-01-05,0,9ehTNgvu0vZgHjWkQqF6KQ,"I first visited this establishment back in 2008 while on vacation in Las Vegas. We have family in the area so they know the good ""local"" places to eat outside of the strip. 

My first visit was very good - coming from Texas where we get top of the line Tex-Mex, as well as authentically cooked Mexican dishes. 

My favvvvorite item on the menu is the ""Spicy Chilorio""... The words I want to use to describe the feeling I get when I wrap this creamy, cheesy mixture into a fresh flour tortilla - are not suitable for your general audience. When I tell you I dream about this dish, I am not telling a lie! It is perfectly spicy, very creamy but not overpowering like some similar dishes can be. 

On my last visit in late November - my entire table of 5 ordered the ""Spicy Chilorio"", and everyone agreed with me on how amazing the flavor is!

The service here is always great. I wish I could remember the name of our server assistant, he was white, very tall, and very attentive. He NEVER let our glasses get even close to halfway empty. The chips and salsa were constant - he was definitely better than our waitress (who was just fine, no complaints!). 

The only draw back for me, is the location! It seemed to be sort of shady, not somewhere we wanted to be late at night. 

Overall, I love this place!",UedzHJ08E6DOBeIabNFJdQ,3,0,5,3yCTiwzvoB5AJgeZ2CCBqw

I wanted something fatty and fulfilling so I went with the Mex bowl after looking at the pictures that people posted on Yelp.  My dish was a little on the big side.

 Thing is though I've been to other Macayo locations and they were very Americanized Mexican food. Being that this location is smack Dab in the middle of many other authentic (Spanish speaking only) Mexican eateries well it made me figure this Macayo may fall in the authentic Mexican category. 
Well everything is very America style from the salsas, to the enchiladas, to the taco salads. We took a few bites, got Togo boxes and gave our food to a homeless dude out front. We were really looking for the Mexican Street taco and corn vibe. That's my go to style.

This isn't the cleanest establishment and I have had to send back a glass or two due to lettuce or sauce on the rim of the glass.  The staff is friendly enough and replace the glass right away.  They have a varied menu from burritos, to tacos, enchiladas, and chimichangas.  The chimi's are very good.

They have a great salsa for dipping chips but the chips are sometimes stale tasting.  

I enjoy their faitas and they have great lunch specials.  The tortillas have the same problem as the chips as they sometimes taste stale.  Still, overall Macayo has the potential to come close to the Southern California restaurant level.

I don't eat Mexican food often though, if I had one of these places close to where I live, I would probably turn in to a burrito.

I'm talken lip smaken, melt in your mouth, wanna slap someone flippen DELICIOUS!! 

We got one order of there cheese nachos which was AMAZING!! I have not had nachos in years so, this was a major decadent explosion of cheesy goodness that feed the deep rooted cheese addict in me.   I also ordered some sort of Cheese Chicken quesadilla though, it was called something else- It was A Thick fluffy tortilla, stuffed with thick chunks of chicken with again, the most incredibly flavorful cheese I literally have ever had, all with some superbly fantabulous guacamole on the side....needless to say, I felt the size of a super burrito when I left.

This place really is addicting. I don't know what kind of flavor they add to there cheese though, it is any cheese lover's idea of heaven.

The overall appearance of the restaurant is nothing fancy and just a typical Mexican chain joint , the service is probably a hit and miss though,  the food.....you just have to try.",g5JvNSSkz6q04uvDcqSU_g,10,8,4,cxkNAX1Y9pr9LsoLz8MHQg

There have many Macayo's restaurants that have come and gone from the old, old one on Paradise Road (think when this street went two ways) to the most recent closing of the one on W. Charleston Blvd a couple of years ago (sniffle, sniffle). This leaves only three locations.

My friend and I enjoy popping in at one of the oldest locations on E. Charleston. Yeah, it is not in the greatest part of town, but it is definitely a locals place. We have a history with coming to this restaurant after partying as they were always open in the wee hours for us to get our fix. We stopped in yesterday to grab lunch and enjoyed one of the lunch specials. We didn't have anything fancy except your typical Mexican fare (tacos, burrito, frijoles, rice and tortillas). We had nothing to complain about. The food was good and the service was exceptional! Oh, and of course the chips and salsa were warm and tasty.
