The staff made perfect recommendations. They quickly assessed our preferences, and recommended the perfect drinks and cautioned us against ones they didn't believe we would
enjoy. They made truly classic cocktails right down to the block ice and care for detail. Thank you!",cnn3u_O0d9WORsEbhf0shQ,0,0,5,Gyd4KTzHfTnjz_Fbc41uiA

I had a delicious specialty cocktail called the ""Last Word"" made with gin. I didn't even like gin until I had this drink!!!

A 2oz pour in a plastic cup (Malibu & Pineapple juice) costs you $17, and a 2oz pour of Grey Goose and cranberry juice will cost you $21. However, the signature cocktails are all between $15-$18.

2231389,2016-12-21,0,u2wqrS4WenKSsuFsrLBGAA,"One of the many hidden gems in Las Vegas.  A must check out spot for any whiskey, bourbon, or cocktail enthusiast looking for an intimate location.  All of the bartenders are a plethora of alcohol knowledge, and will recommend hand crafted cocktails based off of your likings.  From the fireplace, to the stars twinkling above you sitting at the bar you're eyes are often caught looking off into the distance in the little details of this place.  A guaranteed return spot.  And if you're adventurous, I HIGHLY recommend the Comfortably Numb, house, barrel aged cocktail. It is a Delano Las Vegas exclusive woodford reserve double oaked bourbon, Goddard vinalle, and coffee bean- infused carpano.  You will not be disappointed.  The small, intimate food menu is also delicious.  I did not eat anything on this go, but the Toasted Cheese (fdr's favorite) and tomato soup is always my go to!",5VHWTXocEYwxoJe0vG1BJA,0,1,5,-PYIBy051fETiKDSPVqqcA

The bartenders have their mixology down to a science and were very cool.  The waitstaff were attentive, but the crowd did get the better of them in no time flat.  They ran out of food pretty quickly and were very slow to restock.

It is special to come to this place right before bed when you are trying to wind down from the craziness of vegas. We enjoyed it the most when we were taking a break and wanted amazing drinks. it is hard to get good drinks in vegas. they really seem to get by with making simple drinks that are just full of syrup. the people at THIS bar though were making incredible drinks that really blew me away.

3056086,2017-10-19,0,u2wqrS4WenKSsuFsrLBGAA,"This bar is so seductive. It looks amazing at night. There is a second room. All black with navy velvet furniture with starlights and elegant wall curtains and mirrors. Such a simple design yet so alluring. Very clean, crisp feeling. Very good crowd. Mostly business casual or well dressed. The drinks are not as much as you would think. Has a high class feel. Far better than the fake Bellagio with it's boring design, d--k doorman, rude bartender, $25 shots and $40 cocktails. For instance Duval Beers are normally $12-$18 but $8 each here. Frozen daquiri with quality rum was $14. Ice Bar wanted $22 for the same thing. Bar is prime location. They welcome thier customers with great service, great drinks, and a resonable strip price. They don't nickel and dime you with cheap napkins and those skinny straws like Mandalay Bay and the other strip hotels so a middle manager can brag to his bosses about ""saving money"" by nickel and diming the guests. 

The only thing that bugged, the staff in the back chatting, not working, then when I tried to sit in the second room, they lied and said it was closed. Got the feeling they wanted the bartender doing all the work. So they could talk. Other than that, a great place. 

Well designed, seductive , clean. Hopefully the employees will keep that way. The photos on Yelp do not show it at night, when it looks it's best.",gFuwuhN5RIVr38Zu4_TQig,0,0,5,fvZ28HO30qpNxn3PPibHHg

My reason for 4 stars, is the lack of domestic beers.  In a hotel, it is neat to have a scotch and burbon bar. But in my opinion, you should have a little more diverse range of products.

3761090,2018-03-17,1,u2wqrS4WenKSsuFsrLBGAA,"If I were to rate the bar on its looks and drinks then it would probably be a 3-Star because my wine and my wife's berry cocktail were both pretty good.

It's too bad though that two bartenders with poor attitudes ruin the mood because that's what happened on Friday 3/16 when my wife and I were there.  

As soon as I sat down a shaker comes flying my way with the remnants of a berry cocktail and it almost ends up in my lap.  All the guy said was ""Did I get you?""  I said no and he walked away after wiping it up.  

He then compounds it later because where we were sitting, we could clearly see that another bartender mentioned the incident to him from behind the curtains and the guy just rolls his eyes and says ""What else was I supposed to say?""  How about ""Hey, I'm sorry are you ok?""  Maybe even a ""Hey man, why don't I get your first drink since I came about an inch from ruining your outfit before you even had your first drink.""

We returned late night because we obviously are stupid and when my wife asks another bartender what champagne he recommends, he just exhales and say ""Ugh, just get the Prosecco.""  Ok, sorry to have bothered to ask your opinion on one of your options.

These two bartenders either hate their jobs or need some points of service training.  We were guests at the hotel and this somewhat reflects poorly on the Delano in my opinion.",ruqe3slVDfXdXVMPtM976g,2,1,2,asydSyrvUa26K1i90TJ2PA
4035610,2018-06-23,14,u2wqrS4WenKSsuFsrLBGAA,"The sweet sirens call made me stop in here to get a drink at the bar. Plus as I walked by I could not stop tapping my foot to the elegant sounds coming from the female singer. She is so amazing and even interacts with the audience as she sings. The Franklin bar was just a pit stop for me for a drink. Although they offer actual food I did not partake of any this trip.

The Franklin is a throw back to the wonderful lounges of the 1930s and 1940s with the female singer not dancing on the piano. Her voice is magical and she keeps the audiences attention. She even waves as guests walk by. It feels like I know her. She is very magnetic. Her band is amazing and keeps the beat wonderfully to her singing. Some of the covers that they are performing sound just as the originals, so there is so much talent that goes into this band. 

The Franklin is located in the beautiful Delano near the lobby. The band that is playing makes the entire energy of the bar and lobby area alive. Her voice carries all the way down the hall and you can hear it as you turn the corner coming from the MJ experience. One does not just hear her voice there is so much passion and energy in her singing. 

As I sit her and write this, the cocktail is so enjoyable. The whole Franklin bar is alive now because of the sirens voice that is mesmerizing. The service here at the bar is great, but the prices are a little high. With the performance from the band it does not matter. I stopped in here for a cocktail because the lure of the female singer in the band is overwhelming, plus I had some time to kill.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,27,28,5,11ArEkxZQxfTGT8yva53zA

4247816,2016-04-10,3,u2wqrS4WenKSsuFsrLBGAA,"I don't typically write reviews because I travel nine months out of the year and, unfortunately, rely on other people to serve me - but I had to review this place... 

Normally, when I research a place to see if I'd like to spend my money there, I go straight to the whiskey/bourbon/scotch lists. In that regard, this place does not disappoint.  

Here's a recap of my experience of my night out for a friend's bachelor party (we gave that bar a lot of business's): 

Me: ""I'd like an old fashioned, please.""

Bartender: ""Any preference?""

Me: ""Well, you make yours with Knob Creek, right?"" 

Bartender: *dismissively* ""I can make it with anything."" 

Me: ""Okay, I'll take a your old fashioned with some sort of Four Roses. Surprise me."" 

He proceeds to pour the remainder of a bottle of the single barrel (less than 2oz.) into a jigger. Then he pours that over rocks, adds too much simple, and a laughable amount of bitters; I think I counted 10 dashes.  He stirs this about 5 times. THEN, he takes a slice of orange and shoves it into my glass. 

At this point, I was just gonna take my $25 drink (no joke) and leave, but I asked him if I could have it without the giant orange SLICE. He looks at me, takes his fingers and grabs the orange slice out of the glass and tosses it behind his back.  I couldn't believe it. 

I asked him if he always makes a classic old fashioned this way, with a slice and now a twist (I neglected to mention improper measurements and incorrect preparation). He said this is how this bar makes their old fashioned...

Later, I learned a friend ordered an old fashioned but pointed to the menu. This one was made correctly, all be it pre-mixed.  But it had a twist and real maraschino cherries. 

There should be no reason to make an old fashioned any other way than the classic way at a bar of this caliber. The managers should consider vetting its bartenders....at all. 

If you want good liquor, this is a decent place. Don't expect a proper cocktail.",t2qNetCSNrXUZZAXtHOISQ,2,0,1,B8vifiuQ1ZSAg9-55YeEXQ
4465024,2015-12-27,0,u2wqrS4WenKSsuFsrLBGAA,"The Franklin lounge is perched near the lobby area of the hotel. The lounge is intimate and seductive with dark brown tones and dimly lit. Love the aesthetics! 

The well crafted drinks range from classics to creations to barrel aged. As for the Classics, we've selected the Basil Paloma, which was very refreshing with the added Jarritos grapefruit soda. Another selection was the the Delano daiquiri. 

As for the Creations section, the Mr. Hyde was the choice for the entire night. Other good choices were the Tea for Eleanor and Apple of my eye (literally smells and taste like apple pie). 

Keep in mind that luxury like these well crafted drinks comes at a price - you'll find drinks are poured for a premium, but they're worthy of the charge.

The one thing to keep in mind is that the lounge is fairly small and can get crowded quickly. In all, it's a very good choice if you prefer and value well crafted drinks with an intimate setting.",SmSqtDzLMOm1a8tQyvVU_Q,0,0,4,ne3b5Ba9OXWud6HUPaT9Ew

5022951,2015-07-23,5,u2wqrS4WenKSsuFsrLBGAA,"The wife and I decided to check out the Franklin for drinks.  The Franklin is a classy, upscale lobby bar in the classy, upscale Delano.  We arrived around 4pm on a Tuesday and all of the seats at the bar were taken.  We found seats on one of the couches, which were served by the obligatory attractive cocktail waitresses.  Looking over the menu, I was immediately drawn to the Comfortably Numb ($18), a barrel aged cocktail made with Woodford Reserve Double Oaked Bourbon, Giffard Vanille de Madagascar, and coffee bean-infused Carpano Antica Vermouth.  I was practically licking my chops in anticipation, until our waitress came back a few minutes later and informed me that they were out of it.  Really?  Major disappointment.   I went with my Plan B, the Jefferson Library ($15) made with Jefferson's Reserve Bourbon, lemon juice, maple syrup, Angostura, and Innis & Gunn Scottish Porter.  The Jefferson Library fell into the category of ""sometimes less is more.""  There was too much going on in the pilsner glass that it was served, which resulted in the bourbon notes being lost in the mix.  While it certainly wasn't a bad cocktail or a poorly made one, it wasn't one where I'd order another and there really wasn't anything else on the cocktail list other than the unavailable Comfortably Numb that appealed to me.
