What a restaurant, what a menu, what an exceptional treat to have the best Cheesesteak sandwich shop close to my home.

I don't know what they put in their batter but man, it was addicting and flavorful. 

It was a nice little place where you can grab a quick bite to eat and plenty of tables/chair to hang out with some friends. The customer service was excellent. Cashier was very helpful, friendly and nice. My order came out really fast.

First time I tried it, I got a green pepper, mushroom cheesesteak with American cheese (I wish they had white American but oh well). So I get home and unwrap the sandwich and the cheese on my sandwich isn't fully melted, total bummer since the cheesy goodness makes a cheesesteak. 

I tried it again the other night and got a green pepper, mushroom cheesesteak with whiz and provolone and then got a pastrami sandwich with mustard, onion, lettuce. I got home and opened the sandwiches and noticed there wasn't any whiz on the cheesesteak but saw a little yellow on the bread so figured maybe they put a tiny bit. Nope, that was mustard. They mixed up the sandwiches. So I had a cheesesteak with provolone and mustard and a pastrami sandwich with onion and lettuce, no whiz at all.

Can we talk about their special sauces?! Those were awesome. One was sweet with like an Asian twist and the other had a kick not spicy though. I wish we would've got more!! But now that we know I will ask for more! 

The place is small there was maybe 5 people that came in after us. Becomes small quick. They do have high chairs! Service was great. The lady taking our irder was helpful and super friendly! We will return for sure.

So we returned but one tiny problem how will I ever decide between a burger or the philly cheese steak. That burger was seriously ONE OF THE BEST. Grilled onions gave it an extra great taste.

Called in my order for pick up and my food was ready within 10-15. I mean, it's not fine dining so I don't have super high expectations as long as the food and service is good then I have no complaints.

It was worth the drive. Everything is super fresh and flavorful. Word of advice though, don't come in here expecting to order a specific type of cheesesteak (that you're used to or ""how it's supposed to be served""). This place has its own take on it and it's base is just close enough to traditional to make it enjoyable but you can't just get a cookie-cutter sandwich here. If you keep that in mind you'll be good. The service needs a little improvement as it is a little out of sync with the cheerful, home-like vibe and exceptional cooking.

FANTASTIC SERVICE from Tony and The COOK!!

I Had Onion Steak Sub Bookmarked On My Yelp For The Longest Time. I'm So HAPPY We Finally Gave This Shop A Try.

We all ordered something different from the cheesesteak sandwich to the cheeseburger and let's not forget my grilled chicken sandwich.

My grilled chicken sandwich was covered in melted cheese and hugged that grilled chicken perfectly, ya know the way a cheese lover would want it to. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. Seasoning was delicious and not at all salty. Thank goodness! 

Onion Rings and French Fries Were Good Too!

The cook prepares your food right there in the open space behind the counter. Very nice!

ALL of our food was cooked to perfection.

I'm already looking forward to my next delicious sandwich from Onion Steak Sub!

Seriously Consider This Place For Your Next Hot Or Cold Sandwich.

But,  you killed this one flavor,  juice and all and taste like a poor grade of beef also.. So if you want an over done,  tasteless,  rubbery burger this is your spot!
