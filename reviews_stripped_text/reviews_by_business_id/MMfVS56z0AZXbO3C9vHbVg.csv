185148,2016-04-16,0,MMfVS56z0AZXbO3C9vHbVg,I ordered two large pizzas for Pick-Up. When I got there the pizzas were just coming out of the oven. I had 6 hungry young girls and was very glad that they did not have to wait. Quick service and friendly staff.

The wait was much much longer than expected and the manager Taylor Hager was very rude to the 5 plus patrons that he told had to wait.  He was very ubrupt and rude to the entire room of patrons waiting. Taura at the counter wanted to offer a soda while we all waited but her manager Taylor showed his very,very poor customer service to all and would have nothing to do with his customers' needs. When ordering they told me a 20 wait over the phone but in the end the total experience was over an hour. I would suggest going down to one of the other local owned Pizza shops from now on.

So I walk in to pick up my order.  Immediately I was greeted with a ""Carissa?"".  Yep that's me!  He replied, ""thanks for giving us something to do"". LOL  I would imagine it would be tough at lunchtime being right next to a Tropical Smoothie, Port of Subs and a Starbucks.

The guy (I think the manager) was such a pleasant guy.  Not just because of his comment about not needing to be on a low carb diet.  haha  But it sure made my day.  I love personable people!

Got my wings back to the office.  Lots of sauce on them. Lots. Not particularly the least messiest thing to eat at work, but hey you gotta do what you gotta do under the circumstances.  The wings were flavorful and could be spicier but to the average person they were probably spicy.  It never seems hot enough for me.  

Overall customer service was amazing, the food was good and I didn't spoil my diet.  All around a winner!

1142979,2017-11-02,0,MMfVS56z0AZXbO3C9vHbVg,So it was a World Series game night and I ordered pizza by phone. The order was taken down wrong and then I received partial of the wrong order. After trying several times to call someone to no avail I went back to the store. The line was long but I waited because I wanted to see how I would be received. While waiting I opened an online account and saw my order for pizza 7.99 on monitor. The manager attended to me professionally listening to my problem and let me know how long it would be to receive the next Pizza. I decided to wait and also received the rest of the first order. I will always use my account to do all the ordering. I feel there won't be any mistakes on there part and you get points/credit for your patronage.,UWOk2frZJYHNpAuCE_DfeQ,0,0,3,tmp3nA3chxbOWbrUQZpjjw

We ordered  one large chicken supreme pizza, one large regular supreme pizza, dessert pizza and BBQ wings. Delivery was the only reason for the one star I did give them, he was courteous and on time. They got the order wrong again, gave us two of the same pizza and both were undercooked.  As I have experienced in the past a phone call to the store is useless, the manager is very short and makes you feel like it is our problem for ordering. Thus we didn't bother, we put the pizzas in the oven to finish cooking and tried the over cooked, dried out wings.  At least some were the other half of the wings were raw by the bone. We threw all of the wings in the trash- not worth getting sick over.
My recommendation, the head office at PH should take a look at their stores and close this one down. Go to Port of Subs next door!",ZdrOmqAlBzlDLozZcaGJ7A,0,0,1,NSFbv9uiQrTW6Q5ycIy1wA

5155999,2008-03-02,3,MMfVS56z0AZXbO3C9vHbVg,"Locations like this are the reason chain restaurants have such a dubious reputation. I've been several times in the last few years and there is always a problem with my order or someone else's. The service is always slow, whether the location is busy or not - how long can it take to make a pizza? Somehow it takes these people half an hour. At least.

The first sign that this place is unreliable is the fact that they quote lengthy delivery times whether it's a busy day or not. 75 minutes? To bake two pizzas and some wings and bring them the mile or so to my home? Forget it. It's easier to place the order and go pick it up. Or it should be. It would be if they didn't lose orders routinely. I'm not the only customer who's had this happen to them, I've seen other people wait an extra 25 minutes when they tried to pick up their missing order.

The pizzas have been lacking in toppings. They sure do know how to skimp on the meats. I hate to say good things about the wings and breadsticks, but I'll let them be the bright spot in my review.

Oh - they will offer you some coupons for your next order if you have issues during your pickup. But why would you want to come back?

If you absolutely must have Pizza Hut, find another location. Best choice is to go someplace else, period.",c33Z36u5N8h5JgYsnweXlw,3,1,1,GOlZaMKmYRzT9t-cTi8TzA
