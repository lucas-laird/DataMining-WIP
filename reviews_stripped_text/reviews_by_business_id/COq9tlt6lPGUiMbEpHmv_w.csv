1781464,2012-03-04,3,COq9tlt6lPGUiMbEpHmv_w,"It is an immutable fact that everything is better on a stick.  Steak?  Great.  Steak kebabs?  Awesome.  Mango lassi?  Delicious.  Mango lassi popsicles?  Amazing.  Hot dogs?  Scrumptious.  Corn dogs?  Heavenly.  Apples?  Pretty good.  Caramel apples on a stick?  Yes, please!  Jar Jar Binks?  Completely intolerable.  Jar Jar Binks impaled by an iLightsaber and propped up?  A wonderful experience.  Course, that last one might have more to do with the fact that he's dead at that point, but still...

So, Hot Dog on a Stick?  Well of course it's going to be delicious!  The hot dogs they use are full of flavour, the batter is clearly laced with Celonian huffing spices, and they're typically cooked to perfection.  Their lemonade, whilst not actually on a stick, tastes about as good as any drink possibly can without truthfully being on a stick.  Last time The Dark Side had filled me with murderous rage, Yoda just calmly handed me a corn dog and a drink from here, and suddenly everything was OK again.  That's how powerful these products are.  Earth has been spared on more than one occasion because of this place.

It's mall food, which means you never know what kind of service you're going to get.  For that, I'll dock it a point.  But otherwise?  Generally if I'm in a food court and see one, I'll make a line for it.  Unfortunately, there aren't too many of them up here where I've headquartered the New Empire, but whenever I'm in Vegas and wanting to go look at a crashed UFO and wonder why the hell the Deathstar's designers didn't take aerodynamics into consideration when creating it, I'll grab a dog on a stick and a lemonade from here.

I love that they hand dip their corn dogs (fresh never frozen!) and that they come out piping hot and delicious!! You can actually see them making the fresh lemonade (also yum!!) - it makes quite the refreshing treat after a long day at the mall/walking the strip. If you are a fan of corn dogs, you need to come here. If getting excited about corn dogs is wrong, then I don't want to be right.",KQ9TbTOBwC5PTX0HXq1Tng,0,0,5,Sd2Z6WO9pW1WZm9naFB7Fw
2261374,2014-08-26,1,COq9tlt6lPGUiMbEpHmv_w,"Absolutely love this place! The only reason I'm giving this place such a low rating though is because of a staff member. 

I completely understand that you're gonna chit chat when it's slow. But I think out of respect, you should stop when you have customers in front of you. When I was there the other day, Gabby would continue to talk. The other person she worked with greeted EVERY customer and did all of the register work while she yapped away in the background. She wasn't even having an appropriate conversation either. She was talking down about an old friend of hers and even called the person a ""dumbass"" right in front of customers.

This is not good customer service. The girl is young, but she should be taught some work ethic. She should stop talking so much when there is customers and actually work. Not just stand around.

Other than that, I enjoyed my visit.",QSBFFl-nAUIjoENyw2v4KA,0,0,2,nffyslL7h7d9kd9LslK_pQ

The main reason I started coming here was because I have been on a diet for the past 4 months, and a corn dog is one of the only things besides salad at the food court that is under 300 calories!....... And is still tasty. It's an all-turkey dog, and even with the batter, it's 250 calories total.

Most of the employees here are pleasant enough, and I KNOW the lemonade at this location is fresh because I see them churning it almost every other time I go there.

The only issues is that two separate times I have ordered a corn dog there, the inside batter has not been cooked all the way. They have no issue making you a new one, but still. Ew. 

I might have to try the fried cheese on a stick too. Apparently, it's super yummy.",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,2,3,4,N5txTPkn0DmqaiQqzNluXA

If I approach the counter, I shouldn't have to stand there and wait for someone to come out from the back room. And then it happened twice--the veggie dog was excellent as always. Where was the peel in my lemonade? That's just HDS 101. Dave's watching you, you know. Then I came back to refill my lemonade and I waited even longer for someone to appear. When I asked for a refill--not a free one--just a refill that doesn't waste another cup, the girl told me, ""That's at the full price."" Yeah...I just didn't want to waste another giant cup--I know you have to count the cups at night, but heaven forbid you're one cup over.

But they call it ""Hot Dog on a Stick"" obviously, but,  you say potato....
It is 250 calories... It is a Turkey Link, dipped in batter, deep fried to a golden, delish goodness.. .It is great. ( Not the healthiest thing you can mow on, obviously, but  hey, at least it's pretty low cal. But not if you eat 3....)
You can also get cheese on a stick, if you prefer. Or even a veggie dog.
The lemonade is pretty good, but the sugar free one, not so much. But what sugar free beverage ever is, really?
The employees are always super nice, and  pretty fast. But keep in mind for the really impatient types, they have to actually DIP the darn thing in and fry it up, and they do it only AFTER you order it. The don't have a bunch of previously fried Hot Dogs on a Stick lying around. Which is great for flavor's sake...but remember  that may take 3 to 5 minutes, so control yourselves, and try to be nice to them, especially when they have a long line.

In terms of food court choices, this place is pretty darn good.  Their lemonade is absolutely perfect, and the corn dogs are exactly what you can expect with a corn dog.

Of course every time I come here, I picture Ashley from Fresh Prince of Bel Aire in her ridiculous uniform.  Chuuuuurn, baby churn!  Yup, that's why I'm smiling when I am standing in line!
